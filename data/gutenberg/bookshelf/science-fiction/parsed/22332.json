Janifer. Their joint pen-name, derived from their middle names\n(Philip and Mark), was coined soon after their original meeting, at a\nscience-fiction convention. Both men were drunk at the time, which\nexplains a good deal, and only one has ever sobered up. A matter for\nconstant contention between the collaborators is which one.\n\nThey have been collaborating for some time now, and have devised an\ninteresting method of work: Mr. Garrett handles the verbs, the\nadverbs and the interjections, Mr. Janifer the nouns, pronouns, and\nadjectives. Conjunctions are a matter of joint decision, and in the\ncase of a tie, the entire game is replayed at Fenway Park, Boston,\nearly in the following year.\n\nBRAIN TWISTER was fifteen years in the making, of which time three\ndays were spent in the actual writing. When the book was finished,\nboth authors relaxed in the mutual pleasure of nervous breakdowns,\nfrom which it is not certain that either has ever recovered.\n\nMr. Garrett is a large, roundish fellow with a beard. He wears\nflowered vests and always carries a small talisman which no one has\never seen. Mr. Janifer is a somewhat shorter and thinner type, with a\nshorter and thinner beard. His vests are in solid colors, he wears\nhorn-rimmed glasses because he has always done so, and he is never\nfound without a souvenir subway token from the City of New York.\n\nThe personal lives of the authors differ widely. Mr. Garrett's\nhobbies, for instance, include such sports as close-order drill and\nriver pollution. Mr. Janifer, a less active type, prefers sedentary\ngames such as humming or blinking.\n\nMr. Garrett is engaged to an exotically beautiful creature, and the\ntwo plan to be married as soon as they run out of excuses. Mr.\nJanifer, on the other hand, is fascinated by women, and hopes some day\nto meet one.\n\n                            Brain Twister\n\n                            Mark Phillips\n\n       A shorter version of this work appeared in _Astounding\n       Science Fiction_ under the title of _That Sweet Little\n       Old Lady_.\n\n\n                              Prologue\n\nIn nineteen-fourteen, it was enemy aliens.\n\nIn nineteen-thirty, it was Wobblies.\n\nIn nineteen-fifty-seven, it was fellow-travelers.\n\nAnd, in nineteen seventy-one, Kenneth J. Malone rolled wearily out of\nbed wondering what the hell it was going to be now.\n\nOne thing, he told himself, was absolutely certain: it was going to be\nterrible. It always was.\n\nHe managed to stand up, although he was swaying slightly when he\nwalked across the room to the mirror for his usual morning look at\nhimself. He didn't much like staring at his own face, first thing in\nthe morning, but then, he told himself, it was part of the toughening-\nup process every FBI agent had to go through. You had to learn to\nstand up and take it when things got rough, he reminded himself. He\nblinked and looked into the mirror.\n\nHis image blinked back.\n\nHe tried a smile. It looked pretty horrible, he thought--but, then,\nthe mirror had a slight ripple in it, and the ripple distorted\neverything. Malone's face looked as if it had been gently patted with\na waffle-iron.\n\nAnd, of course, it was still early morning, and that meant he was\nhaving a little difficulty in focusing his eyes.\n\nVaguely, he tried to remember the night before. He was just ending his\nvacation, and he thought he recalled having a final farewell party for\ntwo or three lovely female types he had chanced to meet in what was\nstill the world's finest City of Opportunity, Washington, D.C. (latest\nfemale-to-male ratio, five-and-a-half to one). The party had been a\nclassic of its kind, complete with hot and cold running ideas of all\nsorts, and lots and lots of nice powerful liquor.\n\nMalone decided sadly that the ripple wasn't in the mirror, but in his\nhead. He stared at his unshaven face blearily.\n\nBlink. Ripple.\n\nQuite impossible, he told himself. Nobody could conceivably look as\nhorrible as Kenneth J. Malone thought he did. Things just couldn't be\nas bad as all that.\n\nIgnoring a still, small voice which asked persistently: \"Why not?\" he\nturned away from the mirror and set about finding his clothes. He\ndetermined to take his time about getting ready for work: after all,\nnobody could really complain if he arrived late on his first day after\nvacation. Everybody knew how tired vacations made a person.\n\nAnd, besides, there was probably nothing happening anyway. Things had,\nhe recalled with faint pleasure, been pretty quiet lately. Ever since\nthe counterfeiting gang he'd caught had been put away, crime seemed to\nhave dropped to the nice, simple levels of the 1950's and '60's.\nMaybe, he hoped suddenly, he'd be able to spend some time catching up\non his scientific techniques, or his math, or pistol practice....\n\nThe thought of pistol practice made his head begin to throb with the\nauthority of a true hangover. There were fifty or sixty small gnomes\ninside his skull, he realized, all of them with tiny little hammers.\nThey were mining for lead.\n\n\"The lead,\" Malone said aloud, \"is farther down. Not in the skull.\"\n\nThe gnomes paid him no attention. He shut his eyes and tried to relax.\nThe gnomes went right ahead with their work, and microscopic regiments\nof Eagle Scouts began marching steadily along his nerves.\n\nThere were people, Malone had always understood, who bounced out of\ntheir beds and greeted each new day with a smile. It didn't sound\npossible, but then again there were some pretty strange people. The\nhead of that counterfeiting ring, for instance: where had he got the\nidea of picking an alias like Andr\u00e9 Gide?\n\nClutching at his whirling thoughts, Malone opened his eyes, winced,\nand began to get dressed. At least, he thought, it was going to be a\npeaceful day.\n\nIt was at this second that his private intercom buzzed.\n\nMalone winced again. \"To hell with you,\" he called at the thing, but\nthe buzz went on, ignoring the code shut-off. That meant, he knew, an\nemergency call, maybe from his Chief of Section. Maybe even from\nhigher up.\n\n\"I'm not even late for work yet,\" he complained. \"I will be, but I'm\nnot yet. What are they screaming about?\"\n\nThere was, of course, only one way to find out. He shuffled painfully\nacross the room, flipped the switch and said:\n\n\"Malone here.\" Vaguely, he wondered if it were true. He certainly\ndidn't feel as if he were here. Or there. Or anywhere at all, in fact.\n\nA familiar voice came tinnily out of the receiver. \"Malone, get down\nhere right away!\"\n\nThe voice belonged to Andrew J. Burris. Malone sighed deeply and felt\ngrateful, for the fiftieth time, that he had never had a TV pickup\ninstalled in the intercom. He didn't want the FBI chief to see him\nlooking as horrible as he did now, all rippled and everything. It\nwasn't--well, it wasn't professional, that was all.\n\n\"I'll get dressed right away,\" he assured the intercom. \"I should be\nthere in--\"\n\n\"Don't bother to get dressed,\" Burris snapped. \"This is an emergency!\"\n\n\"But, Chief--\"\n\n\"And don't call me Chief!\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Malone said. \"Sure. You want me to come down in my pyjamas.\nRight?\"\n\n\"I want you to--\" Burris stopped. \"All right, Malone. If you want to\nwaste time while our country's life is at stake, you go ahead. Get\ndressed. After all, Malone, when I say something is an emergency--\"\n\n\"I won't get dressed, then,\" Malone said. \"Whatever you say.\"\n\n\"Just do something!\" Burris told him desperately. \"Your country needs\nyou. Pyjamas and all. Malone, it's a crisis!\"\n\nConversations with Burris, Malone told himself, were bound to be a\nlittle confusing. \"I'll be right down,\" he said.\n\n\"Fine,\" Burris said, and hesitated. Then he added: \"Malone, do you\nwear the tops or the bottoms?\"\n\n\"The what?\"\n\n\"Of your pyjamas,\" Burris explained hurriedly. \"The top part or the\nbottom part?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said. \"As a matter of fact, I wear both.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Burris said with satisfaction. \"I wouldn't want an agent of\nmine arrested for indecent exposure.\" He rang off.\n\nMalone blinked at the intercom for a minute, shut it off and then,\nignoring the trip-hammers in his skull and the Eagle Scouts on his\nnerves, began to get dressed. Somehow, in spite of Burris' feelings of\ncrisis, he couldn't see himself trying to flag a taxi on the streets\nof Washington in his pyjamas. Anyhow, not while he was awake. I\ndreamed I was an FBI agent, he thought sadly, in my drafty BVDs.\n\nBesides, it was probably nothing important. These things, he told\nhimself severely, have a way of evaporating as soon as a clear, cold\nintelligence got hold of them.\n\nThen he began wondering where in hell he was going to find a clear,\ncold intelligence. Or even, for that matter, what one was.\n\n\n                                  1\n\n\"They could be anywhere,\" Burris said, with an expression which\nbordered on exasperated horror. \"They could be all around us. Heaven\nonly knows.\"\n\nHe pushed his chair back from his desk and stood up, a chunky little\nman with bright blue eyes and large hands. He paced to the window and\nlooked out at Washington, and then he came back to the desk. A\npersistent office rumor held that he had become head of the FBI purely\nbecause he happened to have an initial _J_ in his name, but in his\ncase the J stood for Jeremiah. And, at the moment, his tone expressed\nall the hopelessness of that Old Testament prophet's lamentations.\n\n\"We're helpless,\" he said, looking at the young man with the crisp\nbrown hair who was sitting across the desk. \"That's what it is, we're\nhelpless.\"\n\nKenneth Malone tried to look dependable. \"Just tell me what to do,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"You're a good agent, Kenneth,\" Burris said. \"You're one of the best.\nThat's why you've been picked for this job. And I want to say that I\npicked you personally. Believe me, there's never been anything like it\nbefore.\"\n\n\"I'll do my best,\" Malone said at random. He was twenty-six, and he\nhad been an FBI agent for three years. In that time, he had, among\nother things, managed to break up a gang of smugglers, track down a\ncounterfeiting ring, and capture three kidnappers. For reasons which\nhe could neither understand nor explain, no one seemed willing to\nattribute his record to luck.\n\n\"I know you will,\" Burris said. \"And if anybody can crack this case,\nMalone, you're the man. It's just that--everything sounds so\n_impossible_. Even after all the conferences we've had.\"\n\n\"Conferences?\" Malone said vaguely. He wished the Chief would get to\nthe point. Any point. He smiled gently across the desk and tried to\nlook competent and dependable and reassuring. Burris' expression\ndidn't change.\n\n\"You'll get the conference tapes later,\" Burris said. \"You can study\nthem before you leave. I suggest you study them very carefully,\nMalone. Don't be like me. Don't get confused.\" He buried his face in\nhis hands. Malone waited patiently. After a few seconds, Burris looked\nup. \"Did you read books when you were a child?\" he asked.\n\nMalone said: \"What?\"\n\n\"Books,\" Burris said. \"When you were a child. Read them.\"\n\n\"Sure I did,\" Malone said. _\"Bomba the Jungle Boy_, and _Doctor\nDoolittle_, and _Lucky Starr_, and _Little Women_--\"\n\n_\"Little Women?\"_\n\n\"When Beth died,\" Malone said, \"I wanted to cry. But I didn't. My\nfather said big boys don't cry.\"\n\n\"And your father was right,\" Burris said. \"Why, when I was a--never\nmind. Forget about Beth and your father. Think about Lucky Starr for a\nminute. Remember him?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said. \"I liked those books. You know it's funny, but\nthe books you read when you're a kid, they kind of stay with you. Know\nwhat I mean? I can still remember that one about Venus, for instance.\nGee, that was--\"\n\n\"Never mind about Venus, too,\" Burris said sharply. \"Keep your mind on\nthe problem.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Malone said. He paused. \"What problem, sir?\" he added.\n\n\"The problem we're discussing,\" Burris said. He gave Malone a bright,\nblank stare. \"My God,\" he said. \"Just listen to me.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"All right, then.\" Burris took a deep breath. He seemed nervous. Once\nagain he stood up and went to the window. This time, he spoke without\nturning. \"Remember how everybody used to laugh about spaceships, and\norbital satellites, and life on other planets? That was just in those\nLucky Starr books. That was all just for kids, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know,\" Malone said slowly.\n\n\"Sure it was all for kids,\" Burris said. \"It was laughable. Nobody\ntook it seriously.\"\n\n\"Well, _somebody_ must--\"\n\n\"You just keep quiet and listen,\" Burris said.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Malone said.\n\nBurris nodded. His hands were clasped behind his back. \"We're not\nlaughing any more, are we, Malone?\" he said without moving.\n\nThere was silence.\n\n\"Well, are we?\"\n\n\"Did you want me to answer, sir?\"\n\n\"Of course I did!\" Burris snapped.\n\n\"You told me to keep quiet and--\"\n\n\"Never mind what I told you,\" Burris said. \"Just do what I told you.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Malone said. \"No, sir,\" he added after a second.\n\n\"No, sir, what?\" Burris asked softly.\n\n\"No, sir, we're not laughing any more,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Ah,\" Burris said. \"And why aren't we laughing any more?\"\n\nThere was a little pause. Malone said, tentatively: \"Because there's\nnothing to laugh about, sir?\"\n\nBurris whirled. \"On the head!\" he said happily. \"You've hit the nail\non the head, Kenneth. I knew I could depend on you.\" His voice grew\nserious again, and thoughtful. \"We're not laughing any more because\nthere's nothing to laugh about. We have orbital satellites, and we've\nlanded on the Moon with an atomic rocket. The planets are the next\nstep, and after that the stars. Man's heritage, Kenneth. The stars.\nAnd the stars, Kenneth, belong to Man--not to the Russians!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Malone said soberly.\n\n\"So,\" Burris said, \"we should learn not to laugh any more. But have\nwe?\"\n\n\"I don't know, sir.\"\n\n\"We haven't,\" Burris said with decision. \"Can you read my mind?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Can I read your mind?\"\n\nMalone hesitated. At last he said: \"Not that I know of, sir.\"\n\n\"Well, I can't,\" Burris snapped. \"And can any of us read each other's\nmind?\"\n\nMalone shook his head. \"No, sir,\" he said.\n\nBurris nodded. \"That's the problem,\" he said. \"That's the case I'm\nsending you out to crack.\"\n\nThis time, the silence was a long one.\n\nAt last, Malone said: \"What problem, sir?\"\n\n\"Mind reading,\" Burris said. \"There's a spy at work in the Nevada\nplant, Kenneth. And the spy is a telepath.\"\n\n                              * * * * *\n\nThe video tapes were very clear and very complete. There were a great\nmany of them, and it was long after nine o'clock when Kenneth Malone\ndecided to take a break and get some fresh air. Washington was a good\ncity for walking, even at night, and Malone liked to walk. Sometimes\nhe pretended, even to himself, that he got his best ideas while\nwalking, but he knew perfectly well that wasn't true. His best ideas\njust seemed to come to him, out of nowhere, precisely as the situation\ndemanded them.\n\nHe was just lucky, that was all. He had a talent for being lucky. But\nnobody would ever believe that. A record like his was spectacular,\neven in the annals of the FBI, and Burris himself believed that the\nrecord showed some kind of superior ability.\n\nMalone knew that wasn't true, but what could he do about it? After\nall, he didn't want to resign, did he? It was kind of romantic and\nexciting to be an FBI agent, even after three years. A man got a\nchance to travel around a lot and see things, and it was interesting.\nThe pay was pretty good, too.\n\nThe only trouble was that, if he didn't quit, he was going to have to\nfind a telepath.\n\nThe notion of telepathic spies just didn't sound right to Malone. It\nbothered him in a remote sort of way. Not that the idea of telepathy\nitself was alien to him--after all, he was even more aware than the\naverage citizen that research had been going on in that field for\nsomething over a quarter of a century, and that the research was even\nspeeding up.\n\nBut the cold fact that a telepathy-detecting device had been invented\nsomehow shocked his sense of propriety, and his notions of privacy. It\nwasn't decent, that was all.\n\nThere ought to be something sacred, he told himself angrily.\n\nHe stopped walking and looked up. He was on Pennsylvania Avenue,\nheading toward the White House.\n\nThat was no good. He went to the corner and turned off, down the\nblock. He had, he told himself, nothing at all to see the President\nabout.\n\nNot yet, anyhow.\n\nThe streets were dark and very peaceful. _I get my best ideas while\nwalking_, Malone said without convincing himself. He thought back to\nthe video tapes.\n\nThe report on the original use of the machine itself had been on one\nof the first tapes, and Malone could still see and hear it. That was\none thing he did have, he reflected; his memory was pretty good.\n\nBurris had been the first speaker on the tapes, and he'd given the\nserial and reference number in a cold, matter-of-fact voice. His face\nhad been perfectly blank, and he looked just like the head of the FBI\npeople were accustomed to seeing on their TV and newsreel screens.\nMalone wondered what had happened to him between the time the tapes\nhad been made and the time he'd sent for Malone.\n\nMaybe the whole notion of telepathy was beginning to get him, Malone\nthought.\n\nBurris recited the standard tape-opening in a rapid mumble, like a\npriest involved in the formula of the Mass: \"Any person or agent\nunauthorized for this tape please refrain from viewing further, under\npenalties as prescribed by law.\" Then he looked off, out past the\nscreen to the left, and said: \"Dr. Thomas O'Connor, of Westinghouse\nLaboratories. Will you come here, Dr. O'Connor?\"\n\nDr. O'Connor came into the lighted square of screen slowly, looking\nall around him. \"This is very fascinating,\" he said, blinking in the\nlamplight. \"I hadn't realized that you people took so many\nprecautions--\"\n\nHe was, Malone thought, somewhere between fifty and sixty, tall and\nthin with skin so transparent that he nearly looked like a living X-\nray. He had pale blue eyes and pale white hair, and, Malone thought,\nif there ever were a contest for the best-looking ghost, Dr. Thomas\nO'Connor would win it hands (or phalanges) down.\n\n\"This is all necessary for the national security,\" Burris said, a\nlittle sternly.\n\n\"Oh,\" Dr. O'Connor said quickly. \"I realize that, of course.\nNaturally. I can certainly see that.\"\n\n\"Let's go ahead, shall we?\" Burris said.\n\nO'Connor nodded. \"Certainly. Certainly.\"\n\nBurris said: \"Well, then,\" and paused. After a second he started\nagain: \"Now, Dr. O'Connor, would you please give us a sort of verbal\nrundown on this for our records?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Dr. O'Connor said. He smiled into the video cameras and\ncleared his throat. \"I take it you don't want an explanation of how\nthis machine works. I mean: you don't want a technical exposition, do\nyou?\"\n\n\"No,\" Burris said, and added: \"Not by any means. Just tell us what it\ndoes.\"\n\nDr. O'Connor suddenly reminded Malone of a professor he'd had in\ncollege for one of the law courses. He had, Malone thought, the same\nsmiling gravity of demeanor, the same condescending attitude of\nabsolute authority. It was clear that Dr. O'Connor lived in a world of\nhis own, a world that was not even touched by the common run of men.\n\n\"Well,\" he began, \"to put it very simply, the device indicates whether\nor not a man's mental--ah--processes are being influenced by outside--\nby outside influences.\" He gave the cameras another little smile. \"If\nyou will allow me, I will demonstrate on the machine itself.\"\n\nHe took two steps that carried him out of camera range, and returned\nwheeling a large heavy-looking box. Dangling from the metal covering\nwere a number of wires and attachments. A long cord led from the box\nto the floor and snaked out of sight to the left.\n\n\"Now,\" Dr. O'Connor said. He selected a single lead, apparently,\nMalone thought, at random. \"This electrode--\"\n\n\"Just a moment, Doctor,\" Burris said. He was eyeing the machine with a\ncombination of suspicion and awe. \"A while back you mentioned\nsomething about 'outside influences.' Just what, specifically, does\nthat mean?\"\n\nWith some regret, Dr. O'Connor dropped the lead. \"Telepathy,\" he said.\n\"By outside influences, I meant influences on the mind, such as\ntelepathy or mind-reading of some nature.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Burris said. \"You can detect a telepath with this machine.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid--\"\n\n\"Well, some kind of a mind-reader anyhow,\" Burris said. \"We won't\nquarrel about terms.\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" Dr. O'Connor said. The smile he turned on Burris was\nas cold and empty as the inside of Orbital Station One. \"What I meant\nwas--if you will permit me to continue--that we cannot detect any sort\nof telepathy or mind-reader with this device. To be frank, I very much\nwish that we could; it would make everything a great deal simpler.\nHowever, the laws of psionics don't seem to operate that way.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" Burris said, \"what does the thing do?\" His face wore a\nmask of confusion. Momentarily, Malone felt sorry for his chief. He\ncould remember how he'd felt, himself, when that law professor had\ncome up with a particularly baffling question in class.\n\n\"This machine,\" Dr. O'Connor said with authority, \"detects the slight\nvariations in mental activity that occur when a person's mind is\n_being_ read.\"\n\n\"You mean, if my mind were being read right now--\"\n\n\"Not right now,\" Dr. O'Connor said. \"You see, the bulk of this machine\nis in Nevada; the structure is both too heavy and too delicate for\ntransport. And there are other qualifications--\"\n\n\"I meant theoretically,\" Burris said.\n\n\"Theoretically--\" Dr. O'Connor began, and smiled\nagain--\"Theoretically, if your mind were being read, this machine\nwould detect it, supposing that the machine were in operating\ncondition and all of the other qualifications had been met. You see,\nMr. Burris, no matter how poor a telepath a man may be, he has some\nslight ability--even if only very slight--to detect the fact that his\nmind is being read.\"\n\n\"You mean, if somebody was reading my mind, I'd know it?\" Burris said.\nHis face showed, Malone realized, that he plainly disbelieved this\nstatement.\n\n\"You would know it,\" Dr. O'Connor said, \"but you would never know you\nknew it. To elucidate: in a normal person--like you, for instance, or\neven like myself--the state of having one's mind read merely results\nin a vague, almost sub-conscious feeling of irritation, something that\ncould easily be attributed to minor worries, or fluctuations in one's\nhormonal balance. The hormonal balance, Mr. Burris, is--\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" Burris said with a trace of irritation. \"I know what\nhormones are.\"\n\n\"Ah. Good,\" Dr. O'Connor said equably. \"In any case, to continue: this\nmachine interprets those specific feelings as indications that the\nmind is being--ah--'eavesdropped' upon.\"\n\nYou could almost see the quotation marks around what Dr. O'Connor\nconsidered slang dropping into place, Malone thought.\n\n\"I see,\" Burris said with a disappointed air. \"But what do you mean,\nit won't detect a telepath? Have you ever actually worked with a\ntelepath?\"\n\n\"Certainly we have,\" Dr. O'Connor said. \"If we hadn't, how would we be\nable to tell that the machine was, in fact, indicating the presence of\ntelepathy? The theoretical state of the art is not, at present,\nsufficiently developed to enable us to--\"\n\n\"I see,\" Burris said hurriedly. \"Only wait a minute.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"You mean you've actually got a real mind-reader? You've found one?\nOne that works?\"\n\nDr. O'Connor shook his head sadly. \"I'm afraid I should have said, Mr.\nBurris, that we did once have one,\" he admitted. \"He was,\nunfortunately, an imbecile, with a mental age between five and six, as\nnearly as we were ever able to judge.\"\n\n\"An imbecile?\" Burris said. \"But how were you able to--\"\n\n\"He could repeat a person's thoughts word for word,\" Dr. O'Connor\nsaid. \"Of course, he was utterly incapable of understanding the\nmeaning behind them. That didn't matter; he simply repeated whatever\nyou were thinking. Rather disconcerting.\"\n\n\"I'm sure,\" Burris said. \"But he was really an imbecile? There wasn't\nany chance of--\"\n\n\"Of curing him?\" Dr. O'Connor said. \"None, I'm afraid. We did at one\ntime feel that there had been a mental breakdown early in the boy's\nlife, and, indeed, it's perfectly possible that he was normal for the\nfirst year or so. The records we did manage to get on that period,\nhowever, were very much confused, and there was never any way of\ntelling anything at all, for certain. It's easy to see what caused the\nconfusion, of course: telepathy in an imbecile is rather an oddity--\nand any normal adult would probably be rather hesitant about admitting\nthat he was capable of it. That's why we have not found another\nsubject; we must merely sit back and wait for lightning to strike.\"\n\nBurris sighed. \"I see your problem,\" he said. \"But what happened to\nthis imbecile boy of yours?\"\n\n\"Very sad,\" Dr. O'Connor said. \"Six months ago, at the age of fifteen,\nthe boy simply died. He simply--gave up, and died.\"\n\n\"Gave up?\"\n\n\"That was as good an explanation as our medical department was able to\nprovide, Mr. Burris. There was some malfunction--but--we like to say\nthat he simply gave up. Living became too difficult for him.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Burris said after a pause. \"This telepath of yours is\ndead, and there aren't any more where he came from. Or if there are,\nyou don't know how to look for them. All right. But to get back to\nthis machine of yours: it couldn't detect the boy's ability?\"\n\nDr. O'Connor shook his head. \"No, I'm afraid not. We've worked hard on\nthat problem at Westinghouse, Mr. Burris, but we haven't yet been able\nto find a method of actually detecting telepaths.\"\n\n\"But you can detect--\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Dr. O'Connor said. \"We can detect the fact that a\nman's mind is being read.\" He stopped, and his face became suddenly\nmorose. When he spoke again, he sounded guilty, as if he were making\nan admission that pained him. \"Of course, Mr. Burris, there's nothing\nwe can do about a man's mind being read. Nothing whatever.\" He essayed\na grin that didn't look very healthy. \"But at least,\" he said, \"you\nknow you're being spied on.\"\n\nBurris grimaced. There was a little silence while Dr. O'Connor stroked\nthe metal box meditatively, as if it were the head of his beloved.\n\nAt last, Burris said: \"Dr. O'Connor, how sure can you be of all this?\"\n\nThe look he received made all the previous conversation seem as warm\nand friendly as a Christmas party by comparison. It was a look that\nfroze the air of the room into a solid chunk, Malone thought, a chunk\nyou could have chipped pieces from, for souvenirs, later, when Dr.\nO'Connor had gone and you could get into the room without any danger\nof being quick-frozen by the man's unfriendly eye.\n\n\"Mr. Burris,\" Dr. O'Connor said in a voice that matched the\ntemperature of his gaze, \"please. Remember our slogan.\"\n\n                              * * * * *\n\nMalone sighed. He fished in his pocket for a pack of cigarettes, found\none, and extracted a single cigarette. He stuck it in his mouth and\nstarted fishing in various pockets for his lighter.\n\nHe sighed again. Perfectly honestly, he preferred cigars, a habit he'd\nacquired from the days when he'd filched them from his father's cigar-\ncase. But his mental picture of a fearless and alert young FBI agent\ndidn't include a cigar. Somehow, remembering his father as neither\nfearless nor, exactly, alert--anyway, not the way the movies and the\nTV screens liked to picture the words--he had the impression that\ncigars looked out of place on FBI agents.\n\nAnd it was, in any case, a small sacrifice to make. He found his\nlighter and shielded it from the brisk wind. He looked out over water\nat the Jefferson Memorial, and was surprised that he'd managed to walk\nas far as he had. Then he stopped thinking about walking, and took a\npuff of his cigarette, and forced himself to think about the job in\nhand.\n\nNaturally, the Westinghouse gadget had been declared Ultra Top Secret\nas soon as it had been worked out. Virtually everything was, these\ndays. And the whole group involved in the machine and its workings had\nbeen transferred without delay to the United States Laboratories out\nin Yucca Flats, Nevada.\n\nOut there in the desert, there just wasn't much to do, Malone\nsupposed, except to play with the machine. And, of course, look at the\nscenery. But when you've seen one desert, Malone thought confusedly,\nyou've seen them all.\n\nSo, the scientists ran experiments on the machine, and they made a\ndiscovery of a kind they hadn't been looking for.\n\nSomebody, they discovered, was picking the brains of the scientists\nthere.\n\nNot the brains of the people working with the telepathy machine.\n\nAnd not the brains of the people working on the several other Earth-\nlimited projects at Yucca Flats.\n\nThey'd been reading the minds of some of the scientists working on the\nnew and highly classified non-rocket space drive.\n\nIn other words, the Yucca Flats plant was infested with a telepathic\nspy. And how do you go about finding a telepath? Malone sighed. Spies\nthat got information in any of the usual ways were tough enough to\nlocate. A telepathic spy was a lot tougher proposition.\n\nWell, one thing about Andrew J. Burris. He had an answer for\neverything. Malone thought of what his chief had said: \"It takes a\nthief to catch a thief. And if the Westinghouse machine won't locate a\ntelepathic spy, I know what will.\"\n\n\"What?\" Malone had asked.\n\n\"It's simple,\" Burris had said. \"Another telepath. There has to be one\naround somewhere. Westinghouse did have one, after all, and the\nRussians _still_ have one. Malone, that's your job: go out and find me\na telepath.\"\n\nBurris had an answer for everything, all right, Malone thought. But he\ncouldn't see where the answer did him very much good. After all, if it\ntakes a telepath to catch a telepath, how do you catch the telepath\nyou're going to use to catch the first telepath?\n\nMalone ran that through his mind again, and then gave it up. It\nsounded as if it should have made sense, somehow, but it just didn't,\nand that was all there was to that.\n\nHe dropped his cigarette to the ground and mashed it out with the toe\nof his shoe. Then he looked up.\n\nOut there, over the water, was the Jefferson Memorial. It stood, white\nin the floodlights, beautiful and untouchable in the darkness. Malone\nstared at it. What would Thomas Jefferson have done in a crisis like\nthis?\n\nJefferson, he told himself without much conviction, would have been\njust as confused as he was.\n\nBut he'd have had to find a telepath, Malone thought. Malone\ndetermined that he would do likewise, If Thomas Jefferson could do it,\nthe least he, Malone, could do was to give it a good try.\n\nThere was only one little problem:\n\n_Where_, Malone thought, _do I start looking?_\n\n\n                                  2\n\nEarly the next morning, Malone awoke on a plane, heading across the\ncontinent toward Nevada. He had gone home to sleep, and he'd had to\nwake up to get on the plane, and now here he was, waking up again. It\nseemed, somehow, like a vicious circle.\n\nThe engines hummed gently as they pushed the big ship through the\nmiddle stratosphere's thinly distributed molecules. Malone looked out\nat the purple-dark sky and set himself to think out his problem again.\n\nHe was still mulling things over when the ship lowered its landing\ngear and rolled to a stop on the big field near Yucca Flats. Malone\nsighed and climbed slowly out of his seat. There was a car waiting for\nhim at the airfield, though, and that seemed to presage a smooth time;\nMalone remembered calling Dr. O'Connor the night before, and\ncongratulated himself on his foresight.\n\nUnfortunately, when he reached the main gate of the high double fence\nthat surrounded the more than ninety square miles of United States\nLaboratories, he found out that entrance into that sanctum sanctorum\nof Security wasn't as easy as he'd imagined--not even for an FBI man.\nHis credentials were checked with the kind of minute care Malone had\nalways thought people reserved for disputed art masterpieces, and it\nwas with a great show of reluctance that the Special Security guards\npassed him inside as far as the office of the Chief Security Officer.\n\nThere, the Chief Security Officer himself, a man who could have\ndoubled for Torquemada, eyed Malone with ill-concealed suspicion while\nhe called Burris at FBI headquarters back in Washington.\n\nBurris identified Malone on the video screen and the Chief Security\nOfficer, looking faintly disappointed, stamped the agent's pass and\nthanked the FBI chief. Malone had the run of the place.\n\nThen he had to find a courier jeep. The Westinghouse division, it\nseemed, was a good two miles away.\n\nAs Malone knew perfectly well, the main portion of the entire Yucca\nFlats area was devoted solely to research on the new space drive which\nwas expected to make the rocket as obsolete as the blunderbuss--at\nleast as far as space travel was concerned. Not, Malone thought\nuneasily, that the blunderbuss had ever been used for space travel,\nbut--\n\nHe got off the subject hurriedly. The jeep whizzed by buildings, most\nof them devoted to aspects of the non-rocket drive. The other projects\nbased at Yucca Flats had to share what space was left--and that\nincluded, of course, the Westinghouse research project.\n\nIt turned out to be a single, rather small white building with a fence\naround it. The fence bothered Malone a little, but there was no need\nto worry; this time he was introduced at once into Dr. O'Connor's\noffice. It was paneled in wallpaper manufactured to look like pine,\nand the telepathy expert sat behind a large black desk bigger than any\nMalone had ever seen in the FBI offices. There wasn't a scrap of paper\non the desk; its surface was smooth and shiny, and behind it the\nnearly transparent Dr. Thomas O'Connor was close to invisible.\n\nHe looked, in person, just about the same as he'd looked on the FBI\ntapes. Malone closed the door of the office behind him, looked for a\nchair and didn't find one. In Dr. O'Connor's office, it was perfectly\nobvious, Dr. O'Connor sat down. You stood, and were uncomfortable.\n\nMalone took off his hat. He reached across the desk to shake hands\nwith the telepathy expert, and Dr. O'Connor gave him a limp fragile\npaw. \"Thanks for giving me a little time,\" Malone said. \"I really\nappreciate it.\" He smiled across the desk. His feet were already\nbeginning to hurt.\n\n\"Not at all,\" Dr. O'Connor said, returning the smile with one of his\nown special quick-frozen brand. \"I realize how important FBI work is\nto all of us, Mr. Malone. What can I do to help you?\"\n\nMalone shifted his feet. \"I'm afraid I wasn't very specific on the\nphone last night,\" he said. \"It wasn't anything I wanted to discuss\nover a line that might have been tapped. You see, I'm on the telepathy\ncase.\"\n\nDr. O'Connor's eyes widened the merest trifle. \"I see,\" he said.\n\"Well, I'll certainly do everything I can to help you.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" Malone said. \"Let's get right down to business, then. The\nfirst thing I want to ask you about is this detector of yours. I\nunderstand it's too big to carry around--but how about making a\nsmaller model?\"\n\n\"Smaller?\" Dr. O'Connor permitted himself a ghostly chuckle. \"I'm\nafraid that isn't possible, Mr. Malone. I would be happy to let you\nhave a small model of the machine if we had one available--more than\nhappy. I would like to see such a machine myself, as a matter of fact.\nUnfortunately, Mr. Malone--\"\n\n\"There just isn't one, right?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Correct,\" Dr. O'Connor said. \"And there are a few other factors. In\nthe first place, the person being analyzed has to be in a specially\nshielded room, such as is used in encephalographic analysis.\nOtherwise, the mental activity of the other persons around him would\ninterfere with the analysis.\" He frowned a little. \"I could wish that\nwe knew a bit more about psionic machines. The trouble with the\npresent device, frankly, is that it is partly psionic and partly\nelectronic, and we can't be entirely sure where one part leaves off\nand the other begins. Very trying. Very trying indeed.\"\n\n\"I'll bet it is,\" Malone said sympathetically, wishing he understood\nwhat Dr. O'Connor was talking about.\n\nThe telepathy expert sighed. \"However,\" he said, \"we keep working at\nit.\" Then he looked at Malone expectantly.\n\nMalone shrugged. \"Well, if I can't carry the thing around, I guess\nthat's that,\" he said. \"But here's the next question: do you happen to\nknow the maximum range of a telepath? I mean: how far away can he get\nfrom another person and still read his mind?\"\n\nDr. O'Connor frowned again. \"We don't have definite information on\nthat, I'm afraid,\" he said. \"Poor little Charlie was rather difficult\nto work with. He was mentally incapable of cooperating in any way, you\nsee.\"\n\n\"Little Charlie?\"\n\n\"Charles O'Neill was the name of the telepath we worked with,\" Dr.\nO'Connor explained.\n\n\"I remember,\" Malone said. The name had been on one of the tapes, but\nhe just hadn't associated \"Charles O'Neill\" with \"Little Charlie.\" He\nfelt as if he'd been caught with his homework undone. \"How did you\nmanage to find him, anyway?\" he said. Maybe, if he knew how\nWestinghouse had found their imbecile-telepath, he'd have some kind of\nclue that would enable him to find one, too. Anyhow, it was worth a\ntry.\n\n\"It wasn't difficult in Charlie's case,\" Dr. O'Connor said. He smiled.\n\"The child babbled all the time, you see.\"\n\n\"You mean he talked about being a telepath?\"\n\nDr. O'Connor shook his head impatiently. \"No,\" he said. \"Not at all. I\nmean that he babbled. Literally. Here: I've got a sample recording in\nmy files.\" He got up from his chair and went to the tall gray filing\ncabinet that hid in a far corner of the pine-paneled room. From a\ndrawer he extracted a spool of common audio tape, and returned to his\ndesk.\n\n\"I'm sorry we didn't get full video on this,\" he said, \"but we didn't\nfeel it was necessary.\" He opened a panel in the upper surface of the\ndesk, and slipped the spool in. \"If you like, there are other tapes--\"\n\n\"Maybe later,\" Malone said.\n\nDr. O'Connor nodded and pressed the playback switch at the side of the\ngreat desk. For a second the room was silent.\n\nThen there was the hiss of empty tape, and a brisk masculine voice\nthat overrode it:\n\n\"Westinghouse Laboratories,\" it said, \"sixteen April nineteen-seventy.\nDr. Walker speaking. The voice you are about to hear belongs to\nCharles O'Neill: chronological age fourteen years, three months;\nmental age, approximately five years. Further data on this case will\nbe found in the file _O'Neill_.\"\n\nThere was a slight pause, filled with more tape hiss.\n\nThen the voice began.\n\n\"... push the switch for record ... in the park last Wednesday ... and\nperhaps a different set of ... poor kid never makes any sense in ...\ntrees and leaves all sunny with the ... electronic components of the\nreducing stage might be ... not as predictable when others are around\nbut ... to go with Sally some night in the....\"\n\nIt was a childish, alto voice, gabbling in a monotone. A phrase would\nbe spoken, the voice would hesitate for just an instant, and then\nanother, totally disconnected phrase would come. The enunciation and\npronunciation would vary from phrase to phrase, but the tone remained\nessentially the same, drained of all emotional content.\n\n\"... in receiving psychocerebral impulses there isn't any ...\nnonsense and nothing but nonsense all the ... tomorrow or maybe\nSaturday with the girl ... tube might be replaceable only if . . .\nsomething ought to be done for the . . . Saturday would be a good time\nfor ... work on the schematics tonight if....\"\n\nThere was a click as the tape was turned off, and Dr. O'Connor looked\nup.\n\n\"It doesn't make much sense,\" Malone said. \"But the kid sure has a\nhell of a vocabulary for an imbecile.\"\n\n\"Vocabulary?\" Dr. O'Connor said softly.\n\n\"That's right,\" Malone said. \"Where'd an imbecile get words like\n'psychocerebral?' I don't think I know what that means, myself.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" Dr. O'Connor said. \"But that's not _his_ vocabulary, you see.\nWhat Charlie is doing is simply repeating the thoughts of those around\nhim. He jumps from mind to mind, simply repeating whatever he\nreceives.\" His face assumed the expression of a man remembering a bad\ntaste in his mouth. \"That's how we found him out, Mr. Malone,\" he\nsaid. \"It's rather startling to look at a blithering idiot and have\nhim suddenly repeat the very thought that's in your mind.\"\n\nMalone nodded unhappily. It didn't seem as if O'Connor's information\nwas going to be a lot of help as far as catching a telepath was\nconcerned. An imbecile, apparently, would give himself away if he were\na telepath. But nobody else seemed to be likely to do that. And\nimbeciles didn't look like very good material for catching spies with.\nThen he brightened. \"Doctor, is it possible that the spy we're looking\nfor really isn't a spy?\"\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\n\"I mean, suppose he's an imbecile, too? I doubt whether an imbecile\nwould really be a spy, if you see what I mean.\"\n\nDr. O'Connor appeared to consider the notion. After a little while he\nsaid: \"It is, I suppose, possible. But the readings on the machine\ndon't give us the same timing as they did in Charlie's case--or even\nthe same sort of timing.\"\n\n\"I don't quite follow you,\" Malone said.\n\nTruthfully, he felt about three miles behind. But perhaps everything\nwould clear up soon. He hoped so. On top of everything else, his feet\nwere now hurting a lot more.\n\n\"Perhaps if I describe one of the tests we ran,\" Dr. O'Connor said,\n\"things will be somewhat clearer.\" He leaned back in his chair. Malone\nshifted his feet again and transferred his hat from his right to his\nleft hand.\n\n\"We put one of our test subjects in the insulated room,\" Dr. O'Connor\nsaid, \"and connected him to the detector. He was to read from a book--\na book that was not too common. This was, of course, to obviate the\nchance that some other person nearby might be reading it, or might\nhave read it in the past. We picked _The Blood is the Death_ by\nHieronymus Melanchthon, which, as you may know, is a very rare book\nindeed.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said. He had never heard of the book, but he was, after\nall, willing to take Dr. O'Connor's word for it.\n\nThe telepathy expert went on: \"Our test subject read it carefully,\nscanning rather than skimming. Cameras recorded the movements of his\neyes in order for us to tell just what he was reading at any given\nmoment, in order to correlate what was going on in his mind with the\nreactions of the machine's indicators, if you follow me.\"\n\nMalone nodded helplessly.\n\n\"At the same time,\" Dr. O'Connor continued blithely, \"we had Charlie\nin a nearby room, recording his babblings. Every so often, he would\ncome out with quotations from _The Blood is the Death_, and these\nquotations corresponded exactly with what our test subject was reading\nat the time, and also corresponded with the abnormal fluctuations of\nthe detector.\"\n\nDr. O'Connor paused. Something, Malone realized, was expected of him.\nHe thought of several responses and chose one. \"I see,\" he said.\n\n\"But the important thing here,\" Dr. O'Connor said, \"is the timing. You\nsee, Charlie was incapable of continued concentration. He could not\nkeep his mind focused on another mind for very long, before he hopped\nto still another. The actual amount of time concentrated on any given\nmind at any single given period varied from a minimum of one point\nthree seconds to a maximum of two point six. The timing samples, when\nplotted graphically over a period of several months, formed a skewed\nbell curve with a mode at two point oh seconds.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" Malone said, wondering if a skewed ball curve was the same thing\nas a belled skew curve, and if not, why not?\n\n\"It was, in fact,\" Dr. O'Connor continued relentlessly, \"a sudden\nvariation in those timings which convinced us that there was another\ntelepath somewhere in the vicinity. We were conducting a second set of\nreading experiments, in precisely the same manner as the first set,\nand, for the first part of the experiment, our figures were\nsubstantially the same. But--\" He stopped.\n\n\"Yes?\" Malone said, shifting his feet and trying to take some weight\noff his left foot by standing on his right leg. Then he stood on his\nleft leg. It didn't seem to do any good.\n\n\"I should explain,\" Dr. O'Connor said, \"that we were conducting this\nseries with a new set of test subjects: some of the scientists here at\nYucca Flats. We wanted to see if the intelligence quotients of the\nsubjects affected the time of contact which Charlie was able to\nmaintain. Naturally, we picked the men here with the highest IQ's, the\ntwo men we have who are in the top echelon of the creative genius\nclass.\" He cleared his throat. \"I did not include myself, of course,\nsince I wished to remain an impartial observer, as much as possible.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Malone said without surprise.\n\n\"The other two geniuses,\" Dr. O'Connor said, \"the other two geniuses\nboth happen to be connected with the project known as Project Isle--an\noperation whose function I neither know, nor care to know, anything at\nall about.\"\n\nMalone nodded. Project Isle was the non-rocket spaceship. Classified.\nTop Secret. Ultra Secret. And, he thought, just about anything else\nyou could think of.\n\n\"At first,\" Dr. O'Connor was saying, \"our detector recorded the time\nperiods of--ah--mental invasion as being the same as before. Then, one\nday, anomalies began to appear. The detector showed that the minds of\nour subjects were being held for as long as two or three minutes. But\nthe phrases repeated by Charlie during these periods showed that his\nown contact time remained the same; that is, they fell within the same\nskewed bell curve as before, and the mode remained constant if nothing\nbut the phrase length were recorded.\"\n\n\"Hmm,\" Malone said, feeling that he ought to be saying something.\n\nDr. O'Connor didn't notice him. \"At first we thought of errors in the\ndetector machine,\" he went on. \"That worried us not somewhat, since\nour understanding of the detector is definitely limited at this time.\nWe do feel that it would be possible to replace some of the electronic\ncomponents with appropriate symbolization like that already used in\nthe purely psionic sections, but we have, as yet, been unable to\ndetermine exactly which electronic components must be replaced by what\nsymbolic components.\"\n\nMalone nodded, silently this time. He had the sudden feeling that Dr.\nO'Connor's flow of words had broken itself up into a vast sea of\nalphabet soup, and that he, Malone, was occupied in drowning in it.\n\n\"However,\" Dr. O'Connor said, breaking what was left of Malone's train\nof thought, \"young Charlie died soon thereafter, and we decided to go\non checking the machine. It was during this period that we found\nsomeone else reading the minds of our test subjects--sometimes for a\nfew seconds, sometimes for several minutes.\"\n\n\"Aha,\" Malone said. Things were beginning to make sense again.\n_Someone else._ That, of course, was the spy.\n\n\"I found,\" Dr. O'Connor said, \"on interrogating the subjects more\nclosely, that they were, in effect, thinking on two levels. They were\nreading the book mechanically, noting the words and sense, but simply\nshuttling the material directly into their memories without actually\nthinking about it. The actual thinking portions of their minds were\nconcentrating on aspects of Project Isle.\"\n\nThere was a little silence.\n\n\"In other words,\" Malone said, \"someone was spying on them for\ninformation about Project Isle?\"\n\n\"Precisely,\" Dr. O'Connor said with a frosty, teacher-to-student\nsmile. \"And whoever it was had a much higher concentration time than\nCharlie had ever attained. He seems to be able to retain contact as\nlong as he can find useful information flowing in the mind being\nread.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" Malone said. \"Wait a minute. If this spy is so\nclever, how come he didn't read _your_ mind?\"\n\n\"It is very likely that he has,\" O'Connor said. \"What does that have\nto do with it?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"if he knows you and your group are working on\ntelepathy and can detect what he's doing, why didn't he just hold off\non the minds of those geniuses when they were being tested in your\nmachine?\"\n\nDr. O'Connor frowned. \"I'm afraid that I can't be sure,\" he said, and\nit was clear from his tone that, if Dr. Thomas O'Connor wasn't sure,\nno one in the entire world was, had been, or ever would be. \"I do have\na theory, however,\" he said, brightening up a trifle.\n\nMalone waited patiently.\n\n\"He must know our limitations,\" Dr. O'Connor said at last. \"He must be\nperfectly well aware that there's not a single thing we can _do_ about\nhim. He must know that we can neither find nor stop him. Why should he\nworry? He can afford to ignore us--or even bait us. We're helpless,\nand he knows it.\"\n\nThat, Malone thought, was about the most cheerless thought he had\nheard in sometime.\n\n\"You mentioned that you had an insulated room,\" the FBI agent said\nafter a while. \"Couldn't you let your men think in there?\"\n\nDr. O'Connor sighed. \"The room is shielded against magnetic fields and\nelectro-magnetic radiation. It is perfectly transparent to psionic\nphenomena, just as it is to gravitational fields.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said. He realized rapidly that his question had been a\nlittle silly to begin with, since the insulated room had been the\nplace where all the tests had been conducted in the first place. \"I\ndon't want to take up too much of your time, Doctor,\" he said after a\npause, \"but there are a couple of other questions.\"\n\n\"Go right ahead,\" Dr. O'Connor said. \"I'm sure I'll be able to help\nyou.\"\n\nMalone thought of mentioning how little help the Doctor had been to\ndate, but decided against it. Why antagonize a perfectly good\nscientist without any reason? Instead, he selected his first question,\nand asked it. \"Have you got any idea how we might lay our hands on\nanother telepath? Preferably one that's not an imbecile, of course.\"\n\nDr. O'Connor's expression changed from patient wisdom to irritation.\n\"I wish we could, Mr. Malone. I wish we could. We certainly need one\nhere to help us here with our work--and I'm sure that your work is\nimportant, too. But I'm afraid we have no ideas at all about finding\nanother telepath. Finding little Charlie was purely fortuitous--\npurely, Mr. Malone, fortuitous.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" Malone said. \"Sure. Of course.\" He thought rapidly and\ndiscovered that he couldn't come up with one more question. As a\nmatter of fact, he'd asked a couple of questions already, and he could\nbarely remember the answers. \"Well,\" he said, \"I guess that's about\nit, then, Doctor. If you come across anything else, be sure and let me\nknow.\"\n\nHe leaned across the desk, extending a hand. \"And thanks for your\ntime,\" he added.\n\nDr. O'Connor stood up and shook his hand. \"No trouble, I assure you,\"\nhe said. \"And I'll certainly give you all the information I can.\"\n\nMalone turned and walked out. Surprisingly, he discovered that his\nfeet and legs still worked. He had thought they'd turned to stone in\nthe office long before.\n\n                              * * * * *\n\nIt was on the plane back to Washington that Malone got his first\ninkling of an idea.\n\nThe only telepath that the Westinghouse boys had been able to turn up\nwas Charles O'Neill, the youthful imbecile.\n\nAll right, then. Suppose there were another like him. Imbeciles\nweren't very difficult to locate. Most of them would be in\ninstitutions, and the others would certainly be on record. It might be\npossible to find someone, anyway, who could be handled and used as a\ntool to find a telepathic spy.\n\nAnd--happy thought!--maybe one of them would turn out to be a high-\ngrade imbecile, or even a moron.\n\nEven if they only turned up another imbecile, he thought wearily, at\nleast Dr. O'Connor would have something to work with.\n\nHe reported back to Burris when he arrived in Washington, told him\nabout the interview with Dr. O'Connor, and explained what had come to\nseem a rather feeble brainstorm.\n\n\"It doesn't seem too productive,\" Burris said, with a shade of\ndisappointment in his voice, \"but we'll try it.\"\n\nAt that, it was a better verdict than Malone had tried for. Though, of\ncourse, it meant extra work for him.\n\nOrders went out to field agents all over the United States, and,\nquietly but efficiently, the FBI went to work. Agents began to probe\nand pry and poke their noses into the files and data sheets of every\nmental institution in the fifty states--as far, at any rate, as they\nwere able.\n\nAnd Kenneth J. Malone was in the lead.\n\nThere had been some talk of his staying in Washington to collate the\nreports as they came in, but that had sounded even worse than having\nto visit hospitals. \"You don't need me to do a job like that,\" he'd\ntold Burris. \"Let's face it, Chief: if we find a telepath the agent\nwho finds him will say so. If we don't, he'll say that, too. You could\nget a chimpanzee to collate reports like that.\"\n\nBurris looked at him speculatively, and for one horrible second Malone\ncould almost hear him sending out an order to find, and hire, a\nchimpanzee (after Security clearance, of course, for whatever\norganizations a chimpanzee could join). But all he said, in what was\nalmost a mild voice, was: \"All right, Malone. And don't call me\nChief.\"\n\nThe very mildness of his tone showed how worried the man was, Malone\nrealized, and he set out for the first hospital on his own list with\ngrim determination written all over his face and a heartbeat that\nseemed to hammer at him that his country expected every man to do his\nduty.\n\n\"I find my duty hard to do today,\" he murmured under his breath. It\nwas all right to tell himself that he had to find a telepath. But how\ndid you go about it? Did you just knock on hospital doors and ask them\nif they had anybody who could read minds?\n\n\"You know,\" Malone told himself in a surprised tone, \"that isn't such\na bad idea.\" It would, at any rate, let him know whether the hospital\nhad any patients who _thought_ they could read minds. From them on, it\nwould probably be simple to apply a test, and separate the telepathic\nsheep from the psychotic goats.\n\nThe image that created in his mind was so odd that Malone, in self-\ndefense, stopped thinking altogether until he'd reached the first\nhospital, a small place situated in the shrinking countryside West of\nWashington.\n\nIt was called, he knew, the Rice Pavilion.\n\n                              * * * * *\n\nThe place was small, and white. It bore a faint resemblance to\nMonticello, but then that was true, Malone reflected, of eight out of\nten public buildings of all sorts. The front door was large and\nopaque, and Malone went up the winding driveway, climbed a short\nflight of marble steps, and rapped sharply.\n\nThe door opened instantly. \"Yes?\" said the man inside, a tall, balding\nfellow wearing doctor's whites and a sad, bloodhound-like expression.\n\n\"Yes,\" Malone said automatically. \"I mean--my name is Kenneth J.\nMalone.\"\n\n\"Mine,\" said the bloodhound, \"is Blake. Doctor Andrew Blake.\" There\nwas a brief pause. \"Is there anything we can do for you?\" the doctor\nwent on.\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"I'm looking for people who can read minds.\"\n\nBlake didn't seem at all surprised. He nodded quietly. \"Of course,\" he\nsaid. \"I understand perfectly.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Malone told him. \"You see, I thought I'd have a little trouble\nfinding--\"\n\n\"Oh, no trouble at all, I assure you,\" Blake went on, just as\nmournfully as ever. \"You've come to the right place, believe me, Mr.--\nah--\"\n\n\"Malone,\" Malone said. \"Kenneth J. Frankly, I didn't think I'd hit the\njackpot this early--I mean, you were the first on my list--\"\n\nThe doctor seemed suddenly to realize that the two of them were\nstanding out on the portico. \"Won't you come inside?\" he said, with a\nfriendly gesture. He stepped aside and Malone walked through the\ndoorway.\n\nJust inside it, three men grabbed him.\n\nMalone, surprised by this sudden reception, fought with every ounce of\nhis FBI training. But the three men had his surprise on their side,\nand three against one was heavy odds for any man, trained or not.\n\nHis neck placed firmly between one upper and lower arm, his legs\npinioned and his arms flailing wildly, Malone managed to shout: \"What\nthe hell is this? What's going on?\"\n\nDr. Blake was watching the entire operation from a standpoint a few\nfeet away. He didn't look as if his expression were ever going to\nchange.\n\n\"It's all for your own good, Mr. Malone,\" he said calmly. \"Please\nbelieve me.\"\n\n\"My God!\" Malone said. He caught somebody's face with one hand and\nthen somebody else grabbed the hand and folded it back with\nirresistible force. He had one arm free, and he tried to use it--but\nnot for long. \"You think I'm nuts!\" he shouted, as the three men\nproduced a strait-jacket from somewhere and began to cram him into it.\n\"Wait!\" he cried, as the canvas began to cramp him. \"You're wrong!\nYou're making a terrible mistake!\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Dr. Blake said. \"But if you'll just relax we'll soon be\nable to help you--\"\n\nThe strait-jacket was on. Malone sagged inside it like a rather large\nand sweaty butterfly rewrapped in a cocoon. Dimly, he realized that he\nsounded like every other nut in the world. All of them would be sure\nto tell the doctor and the attendants that they were making a mistake.\nAll of them would claim they were sane.\n\nThere was, of course, a slight difference. But how could Malone manage\nto prove it? The three men held him up.\n\n\"Now, now,\" Dr. Blake said. \"You can walk, Mr. Malone. Suppose you\njust follow me to your room--\"\n\n\"My room?\" Malone said. \"Now, you listen to me, Doctor. If you don't\ntake this stuff off me at once I promise you the President will hear\nof it. And I don't know how he'll take interference in a vital\nmission--\"\n\n\"The President?\" Blake asked quietly. \"What President, Mr. Malone?\"\n\n\"The President of the United States, damn it!\" Malone shouted.\n\n\"Hmm,\" Blake said.\n\nThat was no good, either, Malone realized. Every nut would have some\nsort of direct pipeline to the President, or God, or somebody high up.\nNuts were like that.\n\nBut he was an FBI Agent. A special agent on a vital mission.\n\nHe said so.\n\n\"Now, now, Mr. Malone,\" Blake told him. \"Let's get to your room, shall\nwe, and then we can talk things over.\"\n\n\"I can prove it!\" Malone told him. The three men picked him up. \"My\nidentification is in my pocket--\"\n\n\"Really?\" Blake said.\n\nThey started moving down the long front hall.\n\n\"All you have to do is take this thing off so I can get at my\npockets--\"\n\nMalone began.\n\nBut even he could see that this new plan wasn't going to work, either.\n\n\"Take it off?\" Blake said. \"Oh, certainly, Mr. Malone. Certainly. Just\nas soon as we have you comfortably settled.\"\n\nIt was ridiculous, Malone told himself as the men carried him away. It\ncouldn't happen: an FBI agent mistaken for a nut, wrapped in a strait-\njacket and carried to a padded cell.\n\nUnfortunately, ridiculous or not, it was happening.\n\nAnd there was absolutely nothing to do about it.\n\nMalone thought with real longing of his nice, safe desk in Washington.\nSuddenly he discovered in himself a great desire to sit around and\ncollate reports. But no--he had to be a hero. He had to go and get\nhimself involved.\n\nThis, he thought, will teach me a great lesson. The next time I get\noffered a job a chimpanzee can do, I'll start eating bananas.\n\nIt was at this point in his reflections that he reached a small door.\nDr. Blake opened it and the three men carried Malone inside. He was\ndumped carefully on the floor. Then the door clanged shut.\n\nAlone, Malone told himself bitterly, at last.\n\n                              * * * * *\n\nAfter a minute or so had gone by he began to think about getting out.\nHe could, it occurred to him, scream for help. But that would only\nbring more attendants, and very possibly Dr. Blake again, and somehow\nMalone felt that further conversation with Dr. Blake was not likely to\nlead to any very rational end.\n\nSooner or later, he knew, they would have to let him loose.\n\nAfter all, he was an FBI agent, wasn't he?\n\nAlone, in a single cheerless cell, caught up in the toils of a strait-\njacket, he began to doubt the fact. Maybe Blake was right; maybe they\nwere all right. Maybe he, Kenneth J. Malone, was totally mad.\n\nHe told himself firmly that the idea was ridiculous.\n\nBut, then, what wasn't?\n\nThe minutes ticked slowly by. After a while the three guards came\nback, opening the door and filing into the room carefully. Malone,\nfeeling more than ever like something in a cocoon, watched them with\ninterest. They shut the door carefully behind them and stood before\nhim.\n\n\"Now, then,\" one of them said. \"We're going to take the jacket off, if\nyou promise to be a good boy.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said. \"And when you take my clothing, look in the\npockets.\"\n\n\"The pockets?\"\n\n\"To find my FBI identification,\" Malone said wearily. He only half-\nbelieved the idea himself, but half a belief, he told himself\nconfusedly, was better than no mind at all. The attendants nodded\nsolemnly.\n\n\"Sure we will,\" one of them said, \"if you're a good boy and don't act\nup rough on us now. Okay?\"\n\nMalone nodded. Carefully, two of the attendants began to unbuckle him\nwhile the third stood by for reinforcements. Malone made no fuss.\n\nIn five minutes he was naked as--he told himself--a jay-bird. What\nwas so completely nude about those particular birds escaped him for\nthe moment, but it wasn't important. The three men were all holding\nvarious parts of the strait-jacket or of his clothing.\n\nThey were still watching him warily.\n\n\"Look in the pockets,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Sure,\" one said. The man holding the jacket reached into it and\ndropped it as if it were hot.\n\n\"Hey,\" he announced in a sick voice, \"the guy's carrying a gun.\"\n\n\"A gun?\" the second one asked.\n\nThe first one gestured toward the crumpled jacket on the floor. \"Look\nfor yourself,\" he said. \"A real honest-to-God gun. I could feel it.\"\n\nMalone leaned against one wall, looking as nonchalant as it was\npossible for him to look in the nude. The room being cool, he felt he\nwas succeeding reasonably well. \"Try the other pocket,\" he suggested.\n\nThe first attendant gave him a long stare. \"What've you got in there,\nbuddy?\" he asked. \"A howitzer?\"\n\n\"Jesus,\" the second attendant said, without moving toward the jacket.\n\"An armed nut. What a world.\"\n\n\"Try the pocket,\" Malone said.\n\nA second went by. The first attendant bent down slowly, picked up the\njacket and slipped his hand into the other inside pocket. He came out\nwith a wallet and flipped it open.\n\nThe others looked over his shoulder.\n\nThere was a long minute of silence.\n\n\"Jesus,\" the second attendant said, as if it were the only word left\nin the language.\n\nMalone sighed. \"There, now,\" he said. \"You see? Suppose you give me\nback my clothes and let's get down to brass tacks.\"\n\n                              * * * * *\n\nIt wasn't that simple, of course.\n\nFirst the attendants had to go and get Dr. Blake, and everybody had to\nexplain everything three or four times, until Malone was just as sick\nof being an FBI agent as he had ever been of being a padded-cell case.\nBut, at last, he stood before Dr. Blake in the corridor outside, once\nagain fully dressed. Slightly rumpled, of course, but fully dressed.\nIt did, Malone thought, make a difference, and if clothes didn't\nexactly make the man they were a long way from a hindrance.\n\n\"Mr. Malone,\" Blake was saying, \"I want to offer my apologies--\"\n\n\"Perfectly okay,\" Malone said agreeably. \"But I would like to know\nsomething. Do you treat all your visitors like this? I mean--the\nmilkman, the mailman, relatives of patients--\"\n\n\"It's not often we get someone here who claims to be from the FBI,\"\nBlake said. \"And naturally our first thought was that--well, sometimes\na patient will come in, just give himself up, so to speak. His\nunconscious mind knows that he needs help, and so he comes to us. We\ntry to help him.\"\n\nPrivately, Malone told himself that it was a hell of a way to run a\nhospital. Aloud, all he said was: \"Sure. I understand perfectly,\nDoctor.\"\n\nDr. Blake nodded. \"And now,\" he said, \"what did you want to talk to me\nabout?\"\n\n\"Just a minute.\" Malone closed his eyes. He'd told Burris he would\ncheck in, and he was late. \"Have you got a phone I can use?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" Blake said, and led him down the corridor to a small\noffice. Malone went to the phone at one end and began dialing even\nbefore Blake shut the door and left him alone.\n\nThe screen lit up instantly with Burris' face. \"Malone, where the hell\nhave you been?\" the head of the FBI roared. \"I've been trying to get\nin touch with you--\"\n\n\"Sorry,\" Malone said. \"I was tied up.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, tied up?\" Burris said. \"Do you know I was just\nabout to send out a general search order? I thought they'd got you.\"\n\n\"They?\" Malone said, interested. \"Who?\"\n\n\"How the hell would I know who?\" Burris roared.\n\n\"Well, nobody got me,\" Malone said. \"I've been investigating Rice\nPavilion, just like I'm supposed to do.\"\n\n\"Then why didn't you check in?\" Burris asked.\n\nMalone sighed. \"Because I got myself locked up,\" he said, and\nexplained. Burris listened with patience.\n\nWhen Malone was finished, Burris said: \"You're coming right on back.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"No arguments,\" Burris told him. \"If you're going to let things like\nthat happen to you you're better off here. Besides, there are plenty\nof men doing the actual searching. There's no need--\"\n\nSecretly, Malone felt relief. \"Well, all right,\" he said. \"But let me\ncheck out this place first, will you?\"\n\n\"Go ahead,\" Burris said. \"But get right on back here.\"\n\nMalone agreed and snapped the phone off. Then he turned back to find\nDr. Blake.\n\n                              * * * * *\n\nExamining hospital records was not an easy job. The inalienable right\nof a physician to refuse to disclose confidences respecting a patient\napplied even to idiots, imbecile and morons. But Malone had a slight\nedge, due to Dr. Blake's embarrassment, and he put it mercilessly to\nwork.\n\nFor all the good it did him he might as well have stayed in his cell.\nThere wasn't even the slightest suspicion in any record that any of\nthe Rice Pavilion patients were telepathic.\n\n\"Are you sure that's what you're looking for?\" Blake asked him, some\nhours later.\n\n\"I'm sure,\" Malone said. \"When you eliminate the impossible, whatever\nremains, however improbable, must be the truth.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Blake said. After a second he added: \"What does that mean?\"\n\nMalone shrugged. \"It's an old saying,\" he told the doctor. \"It doesn't\nhave to mean anything. It just sounds good.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Blake said again.\n\nAfter a while, Malone said farewell to good old Rice Pavilion, and\nheaded back to Washington. There, he told himself, everything would be\npeaceful.\n\nAnd so it was. Peaceful and dispiriting.\n\nEvery agent had problems getting reports from hospitals--and not even\nthe FBI could open the private files of a licensed and registered\npsychiatrist.\n\nBut the field agents did the best they could and, considering the\ncircumstances, their best was pretty good.\n\nMalone, meanwhile, put in two weeks sitting glumly at his Washington\ndesk and checking reports as they arrived. They were uniformly\ndepressing. The United States of America contained more sub-normal\nminds than Malone cared to think about. There seemed to be enough of\nthem to explain the results of any election you were unhappy over.\nUnfortunately, subnormal was all you could call them. Like the\npatients at Rice Pavilion, not one of them appeared to possess any\nabnormal psionic abilities whatever.\n\nThere were a couple who were reputed to be poltergeists--but in\nneither case was there a single shred of evidence to substantiate the\nclaim.\n\nAt the end of the second week, Malone was just about convinced that\nhis idea had been a total washout. He himself had been locked up in a\npadded cell, and other agents had spent a full fortnight digging up\nimbeciles, while the spy at Yucca Flats had been going right on his\nmerry way, scooping information out of the men at Project Isle as\nthough he were scooping beans out of a pot. And, very likely, laughing\nhimself silly at the feeble efforts of the FBI.\n\nWho could he be?\n\nAnyone, Malone told himself unhappily. Anyone at all. He could be the\njanitor who swept out the buildings, one of the guards at the gate,\none of the minor technicians on another project, or even some old\nprospector wandering around the desert with a scintillation counter.\n\nIs there any limit to telepathic range?\n\nThe spy could even be sitting quietly in an armchair in the Kremlin,\nprobing through several thousand miles of solid earth to peep into the\nbrains of the men on Project Isle.\n\nThat was, to say the very least, a depressing idea.\n\nMalone found he had to assume that the spy was in the United States--\nthat, in other words, there was some effective range to telepathic\ncommunication. Otherwise, there was no point in bothering to continue\nthe search.\n\nTherefore, he found one other thing to do. He alerted every agent to\nthe job of discovering how the spy was getting his information out of\nthe country.\n\nHe doubted that it would turn up anything, but it was a chance. And\nMalone hoped desperately for it, because he was beginning to be sure\nthat the field agents were never going to turn up any telepathic\nimbeciles.\n\nHe was right. They never did.\n\n\n                                  3\n\nThe telephone rang.\n\nMalone rolled over on the couch and muttered four words under his\nbreath. Was it absolutely necessary for someone to call him at seven\nin the morning?\n\nHe grabbed at the receiver with one hand, and picked up his cigar from\nthe ashtray with the other. It was bad enough to be awakened from a\nsound sleep--but when a man hadn't been sleeping at all, it was even\nworse.\n\nHe'd been sitting up since before five that morning, worrying about\nthe telepathic spy, and at the moment he wanted sleep more than he\nwanted phone calls.\n\n\"Gur?\" he said, sleepily and angrily, thankful that he'd never had a\nvisiphone installed in his apartment. A taste for blondes was\napparently hereditary. At any rate, Malone felt he had inherited it\nfrom his father, and he didn't want any visible strangers calling him\nat odd hours to interfere with his process of collection and research.\n\nHe blinked at the audio circuit, and a feminine voice said: \"Mr.\nKenneth J. Malone?\"\n\n\"Who's this?\" Malone said peevishly, beginning to discover himself\ncapable of semirational English speech.\n\n\"Long distance from San Francisco,\" the voice said.\n\n\"It certainly is,\" Malone said. \"Who's calling?\"\n\n\"San Francisco is calling,\" the voice said primly.\n\nMalone repressed a desire to tell the voice that he didn't want to\ntalk to St. Francis, not even in Spanish, and said instead: _\"Who_ in\nSan Francisco?\"\n\nThere was a momentary hiatus, and then the voice said: \"Mr. Thomas\nBoyd is calling, sir. He says this is a scramble call.\"\n\nMalone took a drag from his cigar and closed his eyes. Obviously the\ncall was a scramble. If it had been clear, the man would have dialed\ndirect, instead of going through what Malone now recognized as an\noperator.\n\n\"Mr. Boyd says he is the Agent-in-Charge of the San Francisco office\nof the FBI,\" the voice offered.\n\n\"And quite right, too,\" Malone told her. \"All right. Put him on.\"\n\n\"One moment,\" There was a pause, a click, another pause and then\nanother click. At last the operator said: \"Your party is ready, sir.\"\n\nThen there was still another pause.\n\nMalone stared at the audio receiver. He began to whistle _When Irish\nEyes Are Smiling_.\n\n_... And the sound of Irish laughter...._ \"Hello? Malone?\"\n\n\"I'm here, Tom,\" Malone said guiltily. \"This is me. What's the\ntrouble?\"\n\n\"Trouble?\" Boyd said. \"There isn't any trouble. Well, not really. Or\nmaybe it is. I don't know.\"\n\nMalone scowled at the audio receiver, and for the first time wished he\nhad gone ahead and had a video circuit put in, so that Boyd could see\nthe horrendous expression on his face.\n\n\"Look,\" he said. \"It's seven here and that's too early. Out there,\nit's four, and that's practically ridiculous. What's so important?\"\n\nHe knew perfectly well that Boyd wasn't calling him just for the fun\nof it. The man was a damned good agent. But why a call at this hour?\n\nMalone muttered under his breath. Then, self-consciously, he squashed\nout his cigar and lit a cigarette while Boyd was saying: \"Ken, I think\nwe may have found what you've been looking for.\"\n\nIt wasn't safe to say too much, even over a scrambled circuit. But\nMalone got the message without difficulty.\n\n\"Yeah?\" he said, sitting up on the edge of the couch. \"You sure?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Boyd said, \"no. Not absolutely sure. Not absolutely. But it is\nworth your taking a personal look, I think.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" Malone said cautiously. \"An imbecile?\"\n\n\"No,\" Boyd said flatly. \"Not an imbecile. Definitely not an imbecile.\nAs a matter of fact, a hell of a fat long way from an imbecile.\"\n\nMalone glanced at his watch and skimmed over the airline timetables in\nhis mind. \"I'll be there nine o'clock, your time,\" he said. \"Have a\ncar waiting for me at the field.\"\n\n                              * * * * *\n\nAs usual, Malone managed to sleep better on the plane than he'd been\nable to do at home. He slept so well, in fact, that he was still\ngroggy when he stepped into the waiting car.\n\n\"Good to see you, Ken,\" Boyd said briskly, as he shook Malone's hand.\n\n\"You, too, Tom,\" Malone said sleepily. \"Now what's all this about?\" He\nlooked around apprehensively. \"No bugs in this car, I hope?\" he said.\n\nBoyd gunned the motor and headed toward the San Francisco Freeway.\n\"Better not be,\" he said, \"or I'll fire me a technician or two.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" Malone said, relaxing against the upholstery, \"where is\nthis guy, and who is he? And how did you find him?\"\n\nBoyd looked uncomfortable. It was, somehow, both an awe-inspiring and\na slightly risible sight. Six feet one and one-half inches tall in his\nflat feet, Boyd posted around over two hundred and twenty pounds of\nbone, flesh and muscle. He swung a pot-belly of startling proportions\nunder the silk shirting he wore, and his face, with its wide nose,\nsmall eyes and high forehead, was half highly mature, half startlingly\nchildlike. In an apparent effort to erase those childlike qualities,\nBoyd sported a fringe of beard and a moustache which reminded Malone\nof somebody he couldn't quite place.\n\nBut whoever the somebody was, his hair hadn't been black, as Boyd's\nwas...\n\nHe decided it didn't make any difference. Anyhow, Boyd was speaking.\n\n\"In the first place,\" he said, \"it isn't a guy. In the second, I'm not\nexactly sure who it is. And in the third, Ken, I didn't find it.\"\n\nThere was a little silence.\n\n\"Don't tell me,\" Malone said. \"It's a telepathic horse, isn't it? Tom,\nI just don't think I could stand a telepathic horse....\"\n\n\"No,\" Boyd said hastily. \"No. Not at all. No horse. It's a dame. I\nmean a lady.\" He looked away from the road and flashed a glance at\nMalone. His eyes seemed to be pleading for something--understanding,\npossibly, Malone thought. \"Frankly,\" Boyd said, \"I'd rather not tell\nyou anything about her just yet. I'd rather you met her first. Then\nyou could make up your own mind. All right?\"\n\n\"All right,\" Malone said wearily. \"Do it your own way. How far do we\nhave to go?\"\n\n\"Just about an hour's drive,\" Boyd said. \"That's all.\"\n\nMalone slumped back in the seat and pushed his hat over his eyes.\n\"Fine,\" he said. \"Suppose you wake me up when we get there.\"\n\nBut, groggy as he was, he couldn't sleep. He wished he'd had some\ncoffee on the plane. Maybe it would have made him feel better.\n\nThen again, coffee was only coffee. True, he had never acquired his\nfather's taste for gin (and imagined, therefore, that it wasn't\nhereditary, like a taste for blondes), but there was always bourbon.\n\nHe thought about bourbon for a few minutes. It was a nice thought. It\nwarmed him and made him feel a lot better. After a while, he even felt\nawake enough to do some talking.\n\nHe pushed his hat back and struggled to a reasonable sitting position.\n\"I don't suppose you have a drink hidden away in the car somewhere?\"\nhe said tentatively. \"Or would the technicians have found that, too?\"\n\n\"Better not have,\" Boyd said in the same tone as before, \"or I'll fire\na couple of technicians.\" He grinned without turning. \"It's in the\ndoor compartment, next to the forty-five cartridges and the Tommy-\ngun.\"\n\nMalone opened the compartment in the thick door of the car and\nextracted a bottle. It was Christian Brothers Brandy instead of the\nbourbon he had been thinking about, but he discovered that he didn't\nmind at all. It went down as smoothly as milk.\n\nBoyd glanced at it momentarily as Malone screwed the top back on.\n\n\"No,\" Malone said in answer to the unspoken question. \"You're\ndriving.\" Then he settled back again and tipped his hat forward.\n\nHe didn't sleep a wink. He was perfectly sure of that. But it wasn't\nover two seconds later that Boyd said: \"We're here, Ken. Wake up.\"\n\n\"Whadyamean, wakeup,\" Malone said. \"I wasn't asleep.\" He thumbed his\nhat back and sat up rapidly. \"Where's 'here?'\"\n\n\"Bayview Neuropsychiatric Hospital,\" Boyd said. \"This is where Dr.\nHarman works, you know.\"\n\n\"No,\" Malone said. \"As a matter of fact, I don't know. You didn't tell\nme--remember? And who is Dr. Harman, anyhow?\"\n\nThe car was moving up a long, curving driveway toward a large, lawn-\nsurrounded building. Boyd spoke without looking away from the road.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"this Dr. Wilson Harman is the man who phoned us\nyesterday. One of my field agents was out here asking around about\nimbeciles and so on. Found nothing, by the way. And then this Dr.\nHarman called, later. Said he had someone here I might be interested\nin. So I came on out myself for a look, yesterday afternoon--after\nall, we had instructions to follow up every possible lead.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Malone said. \"I wrote them.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Boyd said. \"Sure. Well, anyhow, I talked to this dame. Lady.\"\n\n\"And?\"\n\n\"And I talked to her,\" Boyd said. \"I'm not entirely sure of anything\nmyself. But--well, hell. You take a look at her.\"\n\nHe pulled the car up to a parking space, slid nonchalantly into a slot\nmarked _Reserved_--_Executive Director Sutton_, and slid out from\nunder the wheel while Malone got out the other side.\n\nThey marched up the broad steps, through the doorway and into the\nglass-fronted office of the receptionist.\n\nBoyd showed her his little golden badge, and got an appropriate gasp.\n\"FBI,\" he said. \"Dr. Harman's expecting us.\"\n\nThe wait wasn't over fifteen seconds. Boyd and Malone marched down the\nhall and around a couple of corners, and came to the doctor's office.\nThe door was opaqued glass with nothing but a room number stenciled\non it. Without ceremony, Boyd pushed the door open. Malone followed\nhim inside.\n\nThe office was small but sunny. Dr. Wilson Harman sat behind a blond-\nwood desk, a little man with crew-cut blond hair and rimless\neyeglasses, who looked about thirty-two and couldn't possibly, Malone\nthought, have been anywhere near that young. On a second look, Malone\nnoticed a better age indication in the eyes and forehead, and revised\nhis first guess upward between ten and fifteen years.\n\n\"Come in, gentlemen,\" Dr. Harman called. His voice was that rarity, a\nreally loud high tenor.\n\n\"Dr. Harman,\" Boyd said, \"this is my superior, Mr. Malone. We'd like\nto have a talk with Miss Thompson, if we might.\"\n\n\"I anticipated that, sir,\" Dr. Harman said. \"Miss Thompson is in the\nnext room. Have you explained to Mr. Malone that--\"\n\n\"I haven't explained a thing,\" Boyd said quickly, and added in what\nwas obviously intended to be a casual tone: \"Mr. Malone wants to get a\npicture of Miss Thompson directly--without any preconceptions.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Dr. Harman said. \"Very well, gentlemen. Through this door.\"\n\nHe opened the door in the right-hand wall of the room, and Malone took\none look. It was a long, long look. Standing framed in the doorway,\ndressed in the starched white of a nurse's uniform, was the most\nbeautiful blonde he had ever seen.\n\nShe had curves. She definitely had curves. As a matter of fact, Malone\ndidn't really think he had ever seen curves before. These were\nsomething new and different and truly three-dimensional. But it wasn't\nthe curves, or the long straight lines of her legs, or the quiet\nbeauty of her face, that made her so special. After all, Malone had\nseen legs and bodies and faces before.\n\nAt least, he thought he had. Offhand, he couldn't remember where.\nLooking at the girl, Malone was ready to write brand-new definitions\nfor every anatomical term. Even a term like \"hands.\" Malone had never\nseen anything especially arousing in the human hand before--anyway,\nnot when the hand was just lying around, so to speak, attached to its\nwrist but not doing anything in particular. But these hands, long,\nslender and tapering, white and cool-looking....\n\nAnd yet, it wasn't just the sheer physical beauty of the girl. She had\nsomething else, something more and something different. _(Something\nborrowed_, Malone thought in a semidelirious haze, _and something\nblue.)_ Personality? Character? Soul?\n\nWhatever it was, Malone decided, this girl had it. She had enough of\nit to supply the entire human race, and any others that might exist in\nthe Universe. Malone smiled at the girl and she smiled back.\n\nAfter seeing the smile, Malone wasn't sure he could still walk evenly.\nSomehow, though, he managed to go over to her and extend his hand. The\nnotion that a telepath would turn out to be this mind-searing Epitome\nhad never crossed his mind, but now, somehow, it seemed perfectly\nfitting and proper.\n\n\"Good morning, Miss Thompson,\" he said in what he hoped was a winning\nvoice.\n\nThe smile disappeared. It was like the sun going out.\n\nThe vision appeared to be troubled. Malone was about to volunteer his\nhelp--if necessary, for the next seventy years--when she spoke.\n\n\"I'm not Miss Thompson,\" she said.\n\n\"This is one of our nurses,\" Dr. Harman put in. \"Miss Wilson, Mr.\nMalone. And Mr. Boyd. Miss Thompson, gentlemen, is over there.\"\n\nMalone turned.\n\nThere, in a corner of the room, an old lady sat. She was a small old\nlady, with apple-red cheeks and twinkling eyes. She held some knitting\nin her hands, and she smiled up at the FBI men as if they were her\ngrandsons come for tea and cookies, of a Sunday afternoon.\n\nShe had snow-white hair that shone like a crown around her old head in\nthe lights of the room. Malone blinked at her. She didn't disappear.\n\n\"You're Miss Thompson?\" he said.\n\nShe smiled sweetly. \"Oh, my, no,\" she said.\n\nThere was a long silence. Malone looked at her. Then he looked at the\nunbelievably beautiful Miss Wilson. Then he looked at Dr. Harman. And,\nat last, he looked at Boyd.\n\n\"All right,\" he said. \"I get it. _You're_ Miss Thompson.\"\n\n\"Now, wait a minute, Malone,\" Boyd began.\n\n\"Wait a minute?\" Malone said. \"There are four people here, not\ncounting me. I know I'm not Miss Thompson. I never was, not even as a\nchild. And Dr. Harman isn't, and Miss Wilson isn't, and Whistler's\nGreat-Grandmother isn't, either. So you must be. Unless she isn't\nhere. Or unless she's invisible. Or unless I'm crazy.\"\n\n\"It isn't _you_, Malone,\" Boyd said. \"What isn't me?\"\n\n\"That's crazy,\" Boyd said.\n\n\"Okay,\" Malone said. \"I'm not crazy. Then will somebody please tell\nme--\"\n\nThe little old lady cleared her throat. A silence fell. When it was\ncomplete she spoke, and her voice was as sweet and kindly as anything\nMalone had ever heard.\n\n\"You may call me Miss Thompson,\" she said. \"For the present, at any\nrate. They all do here. It's a pseudonym I have to use.\"\n\n\"A pseudonym?\" Malone said.\n\n\"You see, Mr. Malone,\" Miss Wilson began.\n\nMalone stopped her. \"Don't talk,\" he said. \"I have to concentrate and\nif you talk I can barely think.\" He took off his hat suddenly, and\nbegan twisting the brim in his hands. \"You understand, don't you?\"\n\nThe trace of a smile appeared on her face. \"I think I do,\" she said.\n\n\"Now,\" Malone said. \"You're Miss Thompson, but not really, because you\nhave to use a pseudonym.\" He blinked at the little old lady. \"Why?\"\n\n\"Well,\" she said, \"otherwise people would find out about my little\nsecret.\"\n\n\"Your little secret,\" Malone said.\n\n\"That's right,\" the little old lady said. \"I'm immortal, you see.\"\n\nMalone said: \"Oh.\" Then he kept quiet for a long time. It didn't seem\nto him that anyone in the room was breathing.\n\nHe said: \"Oh,\" again, but it didn't sound any better than it had the\nfirst time. He tried another phrase. \"You're immortal,\" he said.\n\n\"That's right,\" the little old lady agreed sweetly.\n\nThere was only one other question to ask, and Malone set his teeth\ngrimly and asked it. It came out just a trifle indistinct, but the\nlittle old lady nodded.\n\n\"My real name?\" she said. \"Elizabeth. Elizabeth Tudor, of course. I\nused to be Queen.\"\n\n\"Of England,\" Malone said faintly. \"Malone, look--\" Boyd began.\n\n\"Let me get it all at once,\" Malone told him. \"I'm strong. I can take\nit.\" He twisted his hat again and turned back to the little old lady.\n\n\"You're immortal, and you're not really Miss Thompson, but Queen\nElizabeth I?\" he said slowly.\n\n\"That's right,\" she said. \"How clever of you. Of course, after little\nJimmy--cousin Mary's boy, I mean--said I was dead and claimed the\nThrone, I decided to change my name and all. And that's what I did.\nBut I am Elizabeth Regina.\" She smiled, and her eyes twinkled merrily.\nMalone stared at her for a long minute.\n\n_Burris_, he thought, _is going to love this._\n\n\"Oh, I'm so glad,\" the little old lady said. \"Do your really think he\nwill? Because I'm sure I'll like your Mr. Burris, too. All of you FBI\nmen are so charming. Just like poor, poor Essex.\"\n\nWell, Malone told himself, that was that. He'd found himself a\ntelepath.\n\nAnd she wasn't an imbecile.\n\nOh, no. That would have been simple.\n\nInstead, she was battier than a cathedral spire.\n\n                              * * * * *\n\nThe long silence was broken by the voice of Miss Wilson.\n\n\"Mr. Malone,\" she said. \"You've been thinking.\" She stopped. \"I mean,\nyou've been so quiet.\"\n\n\"I like being quiet,\" Malone said patiently. \"Besides--\" He stopped\nand turned to the little old lady. _Can you really read my mind?_ he\nthought deliberately. After a second he added: ... _your Majesty?_\n\n\"How sweet of you, Mr. Malone,\" she said. \"Nobody's called me that for\ncenturies. But of course I can. Although it's not reading, really.\nAfter all, that would be like asking if I can read your voice. Of\ncourse I can, Mr. Malone.\"\n\n\"That does it,\" Malone said. \"I'm not a hard man to convince. And when\nI see the truth, I'm the first one to admit it, even if it makes me\nlook like a nut.\" He turned back to the little old lady. \"Begging your\npardon,\" he said.\n\n\"Oh, my,\" the little old lady said. \"I really don't mind at all.\nSticks and stones, you know, can break my bones. But being called\nnuts, Mr. Malone, can never hurt me. After all, it's been so many\nyears--so many hundreds of years--\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said easily.\n\nBoyd broke in. \"Listen, Malone,\" he said. \"Do you mind telling me what\nthe hell is going on?\"\n\n\"It's very simple,\" Malone said. \"Miss Thompson here--pardon me; I\nmean Queen Elizabeth I--really is a telepath. That's all. I think I\nwant to lie down somewhere until it goes away.\"\n\n\"Until what goes away?\" Miss Wilson said.\n\nMalone stared at her almost without seeing her, if not quite.\n\"Everything,\" he said. He closed his eyes.\n\n\"My goodness,\" the little old lady said after a second. \"Everything's\nso confused. Poor Mr. Malone is terribly shaken up by everything.\" She\nstood up, still holding her knitting, and went across the room. Before\nthe astonished eyes of the doctor and nurse, and Tom Boyd, she patted\nthe FBI agent on the shoulder. \"There, there, Mr. Malone,\" she said.\n\"It will all be perfectly all right. You'll see.\" Then she returned to\nher seat.\n\nMalone opened his eyes. \"My God,\" he said. He closed them again but\nthey flew open as if of their own accord. He turned to Dr. Harman.\n\"You called up Boyd here,\" he said, \"and told him that--er--Miss\nThompson was a telepath. How'd you know?\"\n\n\"It's all right,\" the little old lady put in from her chair. \"I don't\nmind your calling me Miss Thompson, not right now, anyhow.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" Malone said faintly.\n\nDr. Harman was blinking in a kind of befuddled astonishment. \"You mean\nshe really _is_ a--\" He stopped and brought his tenor voice to a\nsqueaking halt, regained his professional poise, and began again. \"I'd\nrather not discuss the patient in her presence, Mr. Malone,\" he said.\n\"If you'll just come into my office--\"\n\n\"Oh, _bosh_, Dr. Harman,\" the little old lady said primly. \"I do wish\nyou'd give your own Queen credit for some ability. Goodness knows you\nthink _you're_ smart enough.\"\n\n\"Now, now, Miss Thompson,\" he said in what was obviously his best\nGrade A Choice Government Inspected couchside manner. \"Don't--\"\n\n\"--upset yourself,\" she finished for him. \"Now, really, Doctor. I know\nwhat you're going to tell them.\"\n\n\"But Miss Thompson, I--\"\n\n\"You didn't honestly think I _was_ a telepath,\" the little old lady\nsaid. \"Heavens, we know that. And you're going to tell them how I used\nto say I could read minds--oh, years and years ago. And because of\nthat you thought it might be worthwhile to tell the FBI about me--\nwhich wasn't very kind of you, Doctor, before you know anything about\nwhy they wanted somebody like me.\"\n\n\"Now, now, Miss Thompson,\" Miss Wilson said, walking across the room\nto put an arm around the little old lady's shoulder. Malone wished for\none brief second that he were the little old lady. Maybe if he were a\npatient in the hospital he would get the same treatment.\n\nHe wondered if he could possibly work such a deal.\n\nThen he wondered if it would be worthwhile, being nuts. But of course\nit would. He was nuts anyhow, wasn't he?\n\nSure, he told himself. They were all nuts.\n\n\"Nobody's going to hurt you,\" Miss Wilson said. She was talking to the\nold lady. \"You'll be perfectly all right and you don't have to worry\nabout a thing.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, dear, I know that,\" the little old lady said. \"You only want\nto help me, dear. You're so kind. And these FBI men really don't mean\nany harm. But Doctor Harman didn't know that. He just thinks I'm crazy\nand that's all.\"\n\n\"Please, Miss Thompson--\" Dr. Harman began.\n\n\"Just crazy, that's all,\" the little old lady said. She turned away\nfor a second and nobody said anything.\n\nThen she turned back. \"Do you all know what he's thinking now?\" she\nsaid. Dr. Harman turned a dull purple, but she ignored him. \"He's\nwondering why I didn't take the trouble to prove all this to you years\nago. And besides that, he's thinking about--\"\n\n\"Miss Thompson,\" Dr. Harman said. His bedside manner had cracked\nthrough and his voice was harsh and strained. \"Please.\"\n\n\"Oh, all right,\" she said, a little petulantly. \"If you want to keep\nall that private.\"\n\nMalone broke in suddenly, fascinated. \"Why didn't you prove you were\ntelepathic before now?\" he said.\n\nThe little old lady smiled at him. \"Why, because you wouldn't have\nbelieved me,\" she said. She dropped her knitting neatly in her lap and\nfolded her hands over it. '\"None of you _wanted_ to believe me,\" she\nsaid, and sniffed. Miss Wilson moved nervously and she looked up. \"And\ndon't tell me it's going to be all right. I know it's going to be all\nright. I'm going to make sure of that.\"\n\nMalone felt a sudden chill. But it was obvious, he told himself, that\nthe little old lady didn't mean what she was saying. She smiled at him\nagain, and her smile was as sweet and guileless as the smile on the\nface of his very own sainted grandmother.\n\nNot that Malone remembered his grandmother; she had died before he'd\nbeen born. But if he'd had a grandmother, and if he'd remembered her,\nhe was sure she would have had the same sweet smile.\n\nSo she couldn't have meant what she'd said. Would Malone's own\ngrandmother make things difficult for him? The very idea was\nridiculous.\n\nDr. Harman opened his mouth, apparently changed his mind, and shut it\nagain. The little old lady turned to him.\n\n\"Were you going to ask why I bothered to prove anything to Mr.\nMalone?\" she said. \"Of course you were, and I shall tell you. It's\nbecause Mr. Malone wanted to believe me. He wants me. He needs me. I'm\na telepath, and that's enough for Mr. Malone. Isn't it?\"\n\n\"Gur,\" Malone said, taken by surprise. After a second he added: \"I\nguess so.\"\n\n\"You see, Doctor?\" the little old lady said.\n\n\"But you--\" Dr. Harman began.\n\n\"I read minds,\" the little old lady said. \"That's right, Doctor.\nThat's what makes me a telepath.\"\n\nMalone's brain was whirling rapidly, like a distant galaxy. Telepath\nwas a nice word, he thought. How do you telepath from a road?\n\nSimple.\n\nThe road is paved.\n\nMalone thought that was pretty funny, but he didn't laugh. He thought\nhe would never laugh again. He wanted to cry, a little, but he didn't\nthink he'd be able to manage that either.\n\nHe twisted his hat, but it didn't make him feel any better. Gradually,\nhe became aware that the little old lady was talking to Dr. Harman\nagain.\n\n\"But,\" she said, \"since it will make you feel so much better, Doctor,\nwe give you our Royal permission to retire, and to speak to Mr. Malone\nalone.\"\n\n\"Malone alone,\" Dr. Harman muttered. \"Hmm. My. Well.\" He turned and\nseemed to be surprised that Malone was actually standing near him.\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"Well. Mr. Alone--Mr. Malone--please, whoever you are,\njust come into my office, please?\"\n\nMalone looked at the little old lady. One of her eyes closed and\nopened. It was an unmistakable wink.\n\nMalone grinned at her in what he hoped was a cheerful manner. \"All\nright,\" he said to the psychiatrist, \"let's go.\" He turned with the\nbarest trace of regret, and Boyd followed him.\n\nLeaving the little old lady and, unfortunately, the startling Miss\nWilson, behind, the procession filed back into Dr. Harman's office.\n\nThe doctor closed the door, and leaned against it for a second. He\nlooked as though someone had suddenly revealed to him that the world\nwas square. But when he spoke his voice was almost even.\n\n\"Sit down, gentlemen,\" he said, and indicated chairs. \"I really--well,\nI don't know what to say. All this time, all these years, she's been\nreading my mind! My mind. She's been reading ... looking right into\nmy mind, or whatever it is.\"\n\n\"Whatever what is?\" Malone asked, sincerely interested. He had dropped\ngratefully into a chair near Boyd's, across the desk from Dr. Harman.\n\n\"Whatever my _mind_ is,\" Dr. Harmon said. \"Reading it. Oh, my.\"\n\n\"Dr. Harman,\" Malone began, but the psychiatrist gave him a bright\nblank stare.\n\n\"Don't you understand?\" he said. \"She's a telepath.\"\n\n\"We--\"\n\nThe phone on Dr. Harman's desk chimed gently. He glanced at it and\nsaid: \"Excuse me. The phone.\" He picked up the receiver and said:\n\"Hello?\"\n\nThere was no image on the screen.\n\nBut the voice was image enough. \"This is Andrew J. Burris,\" it said.\n\"Is Kenneth J. Malone there?\"\n\n\"Mr. Malone?\" the psychiatrist said. \"I mean, Mr. Burris? Mr. Malone\nis here. Yes. Oh, my. Do you want to talk to him?\"\n\n\"No, you idiot,\" the voice said. \"I just want to know if he's all\ntucked in.\"\n\n\"Tucked in?\" Dr. Harman gave the phone a sudden smile. \"A joke,\" he\nsaid. \"It is a joke, isn't it? The way things have been happening, you\nnever know whether--\"\n\n\"A joke,\" Burris' voice said. \"That's right. Yes. Am I talking to one\nof the patients?\"\n\nDr. Harman gulped, got mad, and thought better of it. At last he said,\nvery gently; \"I'm not at all sure,\" and handed the phone to Malone.\n\nThe FBI agent said: \"Hello, Chief. Things are a little confused.\"\n\nBurris' face appeared on the screen. \"Confused, sure,\" he said. \"I\nfeel confused already.\" He took a breath. \"I called the San Francisco\noffice, and they told me you and Boyd were out there. What's going\non?\"\n\nMalone said cautiously: \"We've found a telepath.\"\n\nBurris' eyes widened slightly. \"Another one?\"\n\n\"What are you talking about, another one?\" Malone said. \"We have one.\nDoes anybody else have any more?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Burris said, \"we just got a report on another one--maybe.\nBesides yours, I mean.\"\n\n\"I hope the one you've got is in better shape than the one I've got,\"\nMalone said. He took a deep breath, and then spat it all out at once:\n\"The one we've found is a little old lady. She thinks she's Queen\nElizabeth I. She's a telepath, sure, but she's nuts.\"\n\n\"Queen Elizabeth?\" Burris said. \"Of England?\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Malone said. He held his breath.\n\n\"Damn it,\" Burris exploded, \"they've already got one!\"\n\nMalone sighed. \"This is another one,\" he said. \"Or, rather, the\noriginal one. She also claims she's immortal.\"\n\n\"Lives forever?\" Burris said. \"You mean like that?\"\n\n\"Immortal,\" Malone said. \"Right.\"\n\nBurris nodded. Then he looked worried. \"Tell me, Malone,\" he said.\n\"She _isn't_, is she?\"\n\n\"Isn't immortal, you mean?\" Malone said. Burris nodded. Malone said\nconfidently: \"Of course not.\"\n\nThere was a little pause. Malone thought things over.\n\nHell, maybe she was immortal. Stranger things had happened, hadn't\nthey?\n\nHe looked over at Dr. Harman. \"How about that?\" he said. \"Could she be\nimmortal?\"\n\nThe psychiatrist shook his head decisively. \"She's been here for over\nforty years, Mr. Malone, ever since her late teens. Her records show\nall that, and her birth certificate is in perfect order. Not a\nchance.\"\n\nMalone sighed and turned back to the phone. \"Of course she isn't\nimmortal, Chief,\" he said. \"She couldn't be. Nobody is. Just a nut.\"\n\n\"I was afraid of that,\" Burris said. \"Afraid?\" Malone said.\n\nBurris nodded. \"We've got another one, or anyhow we think we have,\" he\nsaid. \"If he checks out, that is. Right here in Washington.\"\n\n\"Not at--Rice Pavilion?\" Malone asked.\n\n\"No,\" Burris said absently. \"St. Elizabeths.\"\n\nMalone sighed. \"Another nut?\"\n\n\"Strait-jacket case,\" Burris said. \"Delusions of persecution, they\ntell me, and paranoia, and a whole lot of other things that sound\nnasty as hell. I can't pronounce any of them, and that's always a bad\nsign.\"\n\n\"Can he talk?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Who knows?\" Burris told him, and shrugged. \"I'm sending him on out to\nYucca Flats anyhow, under guard. You might find a use for him.\"\n\n\"Oh, sure,\" Malone said. \"We can use him as a horrible example.\nSuppose he can't talk, or do anything? Suppose he turns violent?\nSuppose--\"\n\n\"We can't afford to overlook a thing,\" Burris said, looking stern.\n\nOnce again, Malone sighed deeply. \"I know,\" he said. \"But all the\nsame--\"\n\n\"Don't worry about a thing, Malone,\" Burris said with a palpably false\nair of confidence. \"Everything is going to be perfectly all right.\" He\nlooked like a man trying very hard to sell the Brooklyn Bridge to a\nborn New Yorker. \"You get this Queen Elizabeth of yours out of there\nand take her to Yucca Flats, too,\" he added.\n\nMalone considered the possibilities that were opening up. Maybe, after\nall, they were going to find more telepaths. And maybe all the\ntelepaths would be nuts. When he thought about it, that didn't seem at\nall unlikely. He imagined himself with a talent nobody would believe\nhe had.\n\nA thing like that, he told himself glumly, could drive you buggy in\nshort order--and then where were you?\n\nIn a loony bin, that's where you were.\n\nOr, possibly, in Yucca Flats. Malone pictured the scene: there they\nwould be, just one big happy family. Kenneth J. Malone, and a\nconvention of bats straight out of the nation's foremost loony bins.\n\nFun!\n\nMalone began to wonder why he had gone into FBI work in the first\nplace.\n\n\"Listen, Chief,\" he said. \"I--\"\n\n\"Sure, I understand,\" Burris said quickly. \"She's batty. And this new\none is batty, too. But what else can we do? Malone, don't do anything\nyou'll regret.\"\n\n\"Regret?\" Malone said. \"Like what?\"\n\n\"I mean, don't resign.\"\n\n\"Chief, how did you know--you're not telepathic too, are you?\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" Burris said. \"But that's what I'd do in your place.\"\n\n\"Well--\"\n\n\"Remember, Malone,\" Burris said. His face took on a stern, stuffed\nexpression. \"Do not ask what your country can do for you,\" he quoted\nthe youngest living ex-President. \"Ask rather what you can do for your\ncountry.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said sadly.\n\n\"Well, it's true, isn't it?\" Burris asked.\n\n\"What if it is?\" Malone said. \"It's still terrible. Everything is\nterrible. Look at the situation.\"\n\n\"I am looking,\" Burris said. \"And it's another New Frontier. Just like\nit was when President Kennedy first said those words.\"\n\n\"A New Frontier inhabited entirely by maniacs,\" Malone said.\n\"Perfectly wonderful. What a way to run a world.\"\n\n\"That,\" Burris said, \"is the way the ball bounces. Or whatever you're\nsupposed to say. Malone, don't think you haven't got my sympathy. You\nhave. I know how hard the job is you're doing.\"\n\n\"You couldn't,\" Malone told him bitterly.\n\n\"Well, anyhow,\" Burris went on, \"don't resign. Stay on the job. Don't\ngive it up, Malone. Don't desert the ship. I want you to promise me\nyou won't do it.\"\n\n\"Look, chief,\" Malone said. \"These nuts--\"\n\n\"Malone, you've done a wonderful job so far,\" Burris said. \"You'll get\na raise and a better job when all this is over. Who else would have\nthought of looking in the twitch-bins for telepaths? But you did,\nMalone, and I'm proud of you, and you're stuck with it. We've got to\nuse them now. We have to find that spy!\" He took a breath. \"On to\nYucca Flats!\" he said.\n\nMalone gave up. \"Yes, sir,\" he said. \"Anything else?\"\n\n\"Not right now,\" Burris said. \"If there is, I'll let you know.\"\n\nMalone hung up unhappily as the image vanished. He looked across at\nDr. Harman. \"Well,\" he said, \"that's that. What do I have to do to get\na release for Miss Thompson?\"\n\nHarman stared at him. \"But, Mr. Malone,\" he said, \"that just isn't\npossible. Really. Miss Thompson is a ward of the state, and we\ncouldn't possibly allow her release without a court order.\"\n\nMalone thought that over. \"Okay,\" he said at last. \"I can see that.\"\nHe turned to Boyd. \"Here's a job for you, Tom,\" he said. \"Get one of\nthe judges on the phone. You'll know which one will do us the most\ngood, fastest.\"\n\n\"Mmm,\" Boyd said. \"Say Judge Dunning,\" he said. \"Good man. Fast\nworker.\"\n\n\"I don't care who,\" Malone said. \"Just get going, and get us a release\nfor Miss Thompson.\" He turned back to the doctor. \"By the way,\" he\nsaid. \"Has she got any other name? Besides Elizabeth Tudor, I mean,\"\nhe added hurriedly.\n\n\"Her full name,\" Dr. Harman said, \"is Rose Walker Thompson. She is not\nQueen Elizabeth I, II or XXVIII, and she is not immortal.\"\n\n\"But she is,\" Malone pointed out, \"a telepath. And that's why I want\nher.\"\n\n\"She may,\" Dr. Harman said, \"be a telepath.\" It was obvious that he\nhad partly managed to forget the disturbing incidents that had\nhappened a few minutes before. \"I don't even want to discuss that part\nof it.\"\n\n\"Okay, never mind it,\" Malone said agreeably. \"Tom, get us a court\norder for Rose Walker Thompson. Effective yesterday--day before, if\npossible.\"\n\nBoyd nodded, but before he could get to the phone Dr. Harman spoke\nagain.\n\n\"Now, wait a moment, gentlemen,\" he said. \"Court order or no court\norder, Miss Thompson is definitely not a well woman, and I can't see\nmy way clear to--\"\n\n\"I'm not well myself,\" Malone said. \"I need sleep and I probably have\na cold. But I've got to work for the national security, and--\"\n\n\"This is important,\" Boyd put in.\n\n\"I don't dispute that,\" Dr. Harman said. \"Nevertheless, I--\"\n\nThe door that led into the other room burst suddenly open. The three\nmen turned to stare at Miss Wilson, who stood in the doorway for a\nlong second and then stepped into the office, closing the door quietly\nbehind her.\n\n\"I'm sorry to interrupt,\" she said.\n\n\"Not at all,\" Malone said. \"It's a pleasure to have you. Come again\nsoon.\" He smiled at her.\n\nShe didn't smile back. \"Doctor,\" she said, \"you'd really better talk\nto Miss Thompson. I'm not at all sure what I can do. It's something\nnew.\"\n\n\"New?\" he said. The worry lines on his face were increasing, but he\nspoke softly.\n\n\"The poor dear thinks she's going to get out of the hospital now,\"\nMiss Wilson said. \"For some reason, she's convinced that the FBI is\ngoing to get her released, and--\"\n\nAs she saw the expression on three faces, she stopped.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" she said.\n\n\"Miss Wilson,\" Malone said, \"we--may I call you by your first name?\"\n\n\"Of course, Mr. Malone,\" she said. There was a little silence.\n\n\"Miss Wilson,\" Malone said, \"what _is_ your first name?\"\n\nShe smiled now, very gently. Malone wanted to walk through mountains,\nor climb fire. He felt confused, but wonderful. \"Barbara,\" she said.\n\n\"Lovely,\" he said. \"Well, Barbara--and please call me Ken. It's short\nfor Kenneth.\"\n\nThe smile on her face broadened. \"I thought it might be,\" she said.\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said softly, \"it is. Kenneth. That's my name. And\nyou're Barbara.\"\n\nBoyd cleared his throat.\n\n\"Ah,\" Malone said. \"Yes. Of course. Well, Barbara--well, that's just\nwhat we intend to do. Take Miss Thompson away. We need her--badly.\"\n\nDr. Harman had said nothing at all, and had barely moved. He was\nstaring at a point on his desk. \"She couldn't possibly have heard us,\"\nhe muttered. \"That's a soundproof door. She couldn't have heard us.\"\n\n\"But you can't take Miss Thompson away,\" Miss Wilson said.\n\n\"We have to, Barbara,\" Malone said gently. \"Try to understand. It's\nfor the national security.\"\n\n\"She heard us thinking,\" Dr. Harman muttered. \"That's what; she heard\nus thinking. Behind a soundproof door. She can see inside their minds.\nShe can even see inside _my_ mind.\"\n\n\"She's a sick woman,\" Barbara said. \"But you have to understand--\"\n\n\"Vital necessity,\" Boyd put in. \"Absolutely vital.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless--\" Barbara said. \"She can read minds,\" Dr. Harman\nwhispered in an awed tone. \"She knows. Everything. She _knows_.\"\n\n\"It's out of the question,\" Barbara said. \"Whether you like it or not,\nMiss Thompson is not going to leave this hospital. Why, what could she\ndo outside these walls? She hasn't left in over forty years! And\nfurthermore, Mr. Malone--\"\n\n\"Kenneth,\" Malone put in, as the door opened again. \"I mean Ken.\"\n\nThe little old lady put her haloed head into the room. \"Now, now,\nBarbara,\" she said. \"Don't you go spoiling things. Just let these nice\nmen take me away and everything will be fine, believe me. Besides,\nI've been outside more often then you imagine.\"\n\n\"Outside?\" Barbara said.\n\n\"Of course,\" the little old lady said. \"In other people's minds. Even\nyours. I remember that nice young man--what was his name?--\"\n\n\"Never mind his name,\" Barbara said, flushing furiously.\n\nMalone felt instantly jealous of every nice young man he had ever even\nheard of. _He_ wasn't a nice young man; he was an FBI agent, and he\nliked to get drunk and smoke cigars and carouse with loose women.\nAnyway, reasonably loose women.\n\nAll nice young men, he decided, should be turned into ugly old men as\nsoon as possible. That'll fix them!\n\nHe noticed the little old lady smiling at him, and tried to change his\nthoughts rapidly. But the little old lady said nothing at all.\n\n\"At any rate,\" Barbara said, \"I'm afraid that we just can't--\"\n\nDr. Harman cleared his throat imperiously. It was a most impressive\nnoise, and everyone turned to look at him. His face was a little gray,\nbut he looked, otherwise, like a rather pudgy, blond, crew-cut Roman\nemperor.\n\n\"Just a moment,\" he said with dignity. \"I think you're doing the\nUnited States of America a grave injustice, Miss Wilson--and that\nyou're doing an injustice to Miss Thompson, too.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" she said.\n\n\"I think it would be nice for her to get away from me--I mean from\nhere,\" the psychiatrist said. \"Where did you say you were taking her?\"\nhe asked Malone.\n\n\"Yucca Flats,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Ah.\" The news seemed to please the psychiatrist. \"That's a long\ndistance from here, isn't it? It's quite a few hundred miles away.\nPerhaps even a few thousand miles away. I feel sure that will be the\nbest thing for me--I mean, of course, for Miss Thompson. I shall\nrecommend that the court so order.\"\n\n\"Doctor--\" But even Barbara saw, Malone could tell, that it was no\ngood arguing with Dr. Harman. She tried a last attack. \"Doctor, who's\ngoing to take care of her?\"\n\nA light the size and shape of North America burst in Malone's mind. He\nalmost chortled. But he managed to keep his voice under control. \"What\nshe needs,\" he said, \"is a trained psychiatric nurse.\"\n\nBarbara Wilson gave him a look that had carloads of U235 stacked away\nin it, but Malone barely minded. She'd get over it, he told himself.\n\n\"Now, wasn't that sweet of you to think of that,\" the little old lady\nsaid. Malone looked at her and was rewarded with another wink. _Good\nGod_, he thought. _She reads minds!_\n\n\"I'm certainly glad you thought of Barbara,\" the little old lady went\non. \"You will go with me, won't you, dear? I'll make you a duchess.\nWouldn't you like to be a duchess, dear?\"\n\nBarbara looked from Malone to the little old lady, and then she looked\nat Dr. Harman. Apparently what she saw failed to make her happy.\n\n\"We'll take good care of her, Barbara,\" Malone said.\n\nShe didn't even bother to give him an answer. After a second Boyd\nsaid: \"Well, I guess that settles it. If you'll let me use your phone,\nDr. Harman, I'll call Judge Dunning.\"\n\n\"Go right ahead,\" Dr. Harman said. \"Go right ahead.\"\n\nThe little old lady smiled softly without looking at anybody at all.\n\"Won't it be wonderful,\" she whispered. \"At last I've been recognized.\nMy country is about to pay me for my services. My loyal subjects....\"\nShe stopped and wiped what Malone thought was a tear from one\ncornflower-blue eye.\n\n\"Now, now, Miss Thompson,\" Barbara said.\n\n\"I'm not sad,\" the little old lady said, smiling up at her. \"I'm just\nso very happy. I am about to get my reward, my well-deserved reward at\nlast, from all of my loyal subjects. You'll see.\" She paused and\nMalone felt a faint stirring of stark, chill fear.\n\n\"Won't it be wonderful?\" said the little old lady.\n\n\n                                  4\n\n\"You're _where_?\" Andrew J. Burris said.\n\nMalone looked at the surprised face on the screen and wished he hadn't\ncalled. He had to report in, of course--but, if he'd had any sense,\nhe'd have ordered Boyd to do the job for him.\n\nOh, well, it was too late for that now. \"I'm in Las Vegas,\" he said.\n\"I tried to get you last night, but I couldn't, so I--\"\n\n\"Las Vegas,\" Burris said. \"Well, well. Las Vegas.\" His face darkened\nand his voice became very loud. \"Why aren't you in Yucca Flats?\" he\nscreamed.\n\n\"Because she insisted on it,\" Malone said. \"The old lady. Miss\nThompson. She says there's another telepath here.\"\n\nBurris closed his eyes. \"Well, that's a relief,\" he said at last.\n\"Somebody in one of the gambling houses, I suppose. Fine, Malone.\" He\nwent right on without a pause: \"The boys have uncovered two more in\nvarious parts of the nation. Not one of them is even close to sane.\"\nHe opened his eyes. \"Where's this one?\" he said.\n\nMalone sighed. \"In the looney bin,\" he said.\n\nBurris' eyes closed again. Malone waited in silence. At last Burris\nsaid: \"All right. Get him out.\"\n\n\"Right,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Tell me,\" Burris said. \"Why did Miss Thompson insist that you go to\nLas Vegas? Somebody else could have done the job. You could have sent\nBoyd, couldn't you?\"\n\n\"Chief,\" Malone said slowly, \"what sort of mental condition are those\nother telepaths in?\"\n\n\"Pretty bad,\" Burris said. \"As a matter of fact, very bad. Miss\nThompson may be off her trolley, but the others haven't even got any\ntracks.\" He paused. \"What's that got to do with it?\" he said.\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"I figured we'd better handle Miss Thompson with\nkid gloves--at least until we find a better telepath to work with.\" He\ndidn't mention Barbara Wilson. The chief, he told himself, didn't want\nto be bothered with details.\n\n\"Doggone right you'd better,\" Burris said. \"You treat that old lady as\nif she were the Queen herself, understand?\"\n\n\"Don't worry,\" Malone said unhappily. \"We are.\" He hesitated. \"She\nsays she'll help us find our spy, all right, but we've got to do it\nher way--or else she won't cooperate.\"\n\n\"Do it her way, then,\" Burris said. \"That spy--\"\n\n\"Chief, are you sure?\"\n\nBurris blinked. \"Well, then,\" he said, \"what _is_ her way?\"\n\nMalone took a deep breath. \"First,\" he said, \"we had to come here and\npick this guy up. This William Logan, who's in a private sanitarium\njust outside of Las Vegas. That's number one. Miss Thompson wants to\nget all the telepaths together, so they can hold mental conversations\nor something.\"\n\n\"And all of them batty,\" Burris said.\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said. \"A convention of nuts--and me in the middle.\nListen, Chief--\"\n\n\"Later,\" Burris said. \"When this is over we can all resign, or go\nfishing, or just plain shoot ourselves. But right now the national\nsecurity is primary, Malone. Remember that.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Malone sighed. \"Okay. But she wants all the nuts here.\"\n\n\"Go along with her,\" Burris snapped. \"Keep her happy. So far, Malone,\nshe's the only lead we have on the guy who's swiping information from\nYucca Flats. If she wants something, Malone, you do it.\"\n\n\"But, Chief--\"\n\n\"Don't interrupt me,\" Burris said. \"If she wants to be treated like a\nQueen, you treat her like one. Malone, that's an order!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Malone said sadly. \"But, Chief, she wants us to buy her\nsome new clothes.\"\n\n\"My God,\" Burris exploded. \"Is that all? New clothes? Get 'em. Put 'em\non the expense account. New clothes are a drop in the bucket.\"\n\n\"Well--she thinks we need new clothes, too.\"\n\n\"Maybe you do,\" Burris said. \"Put the whole thing on the expense\naccount. You don't think I'm going to quibble about a few dollars, do\nyou?\"\n\n\"Well--\"\n\n\"Get the clothes. Just don't bother me with details like this. Handle\nthe job yourself, Malone--you're in charge out there. And get to Yucca\nFlats as soon as possible.\"\n\nMalone gave up. \"Yes, sir,\" he said.\n\n\"All right, then,\" Burris said. \"Call me tomorrow. Meanwhile--good\nluck, Malone. Chin up.\"\n\nMalone said: \"Yes, sir,\" and reached for the switch. But Burris' voice\nstopped him.\n\n\"Just one thing,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes, Chief?\" Malone said.\n\nBurris frowned. \"Don't spend any more for the clothes than you have\nto,\" he said.\n\nMalone nodded, and cut off.\n\nWhen the Director's image had vanished, he got up and went to the\nwindow of the hotel room. Outside, a huge sign told the world, and\nMalone, that this was the Thunderbird-Hilton-Zeckendorf Hotel, but\nMalone ignored it. He didn't need a sign; he knew where he was.\n\nIn hot water, he thought. _That's_ where he was.\n\nBehind him, the door opened. Malone turned as Boyd came in.\n\n\"I found a costume shop, Ken,\" he said.\n\n\"Great,\" Malone said. \"The Chief authorized it.\"\n\n\"He did?\" Boyd's round face fell at the news.\n\n\"He said to buy her whatever she wants. He says to treat her like a\nQueen.\"\n\n\"That,\" Boyd said, \"we're doing now.\"\n\n\"I know it,\" Malone said. \"I know it altogether too well.\"\n\n\"Anyhow,\" Boyd said, brightening, \"the costume shop doesn't do us any\ngood. They've only got cowboy stuff and bullfighters' costumes and\nMexican stuff--you know, for their Helldorado Week here.\"\n\n\"You didn't give up, did you?\" Malone said.\n\nBoyd shook his head. \"Of course not,\" he said. \"Ken: this is on the\nexpense account, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Expense account,\" Malone said. \"Sure it is.\"\n\nBoyd looked relieved. \"Good,\" he said. \"Because I had the proprietor\nphone her size in, to New York.\"\n\n\"Better get two of 'em,\" Malone said. \"The Chief said anything she\nwanted, she was supposed to have.\"\n\n\"I'll go back right away. I told him we wanted the stuff on the\nafternoon plane, so--\"\n\n\"And give him Bar--Miss Wilson's size, and yours, and mine. Tell him\nto dig up something appropriate.\"\n\n\"For us?\" Boyd blanched visibly. \"For us,\" Malone said grimly.\n\nBoyd set his jaw. \"No,\" he said.\n\n\"Listen, Tom,\" Malone said, \"I don't like this any better than you do.\nBut if I can't resign, you can't either. Costumes for everybody.\"\n\n\"But,\" Boyd said, and stopped. After a second he went on: \"Malone--\nKen--FBI agents are supposed to be inconspicuous, aren't they?\"\n\nMalone nodded.\n\n\"Well, how inconspicuous are we going to be in this stuff?\"\n\n\"It's an idea,\" Malone said. \"But it isn't a very good one. Our first\njob is to keep Miss Thompson happy. And that means costumes.\"\n\nBoyd said: \"My God.\"\n\n\"And what's more,\" Malone added, \"from now on she's 'Your Majesty.'\nGot that?\"\n\n\"Ken,\" Boyd said, \"you've gone nuts.\"\n\nMalone shook his head. \"No, I haven't,\" he said. \"I just wish I had.\nIt would be a relief.\"\n\n\"Me too,\" Boyd said. He started for the door and turned. \"I wish I\ncould have stayed in San Francisco,\" he said. \"Why should she insist\non taking _me_ along?\"\n\n\"The beard,\" Malone said. \"My beard?\" Boyd recoiled.\n\n\"Right,\" Malone said. \"She says it reminds her of someone she knows.\nFrankly, it reminds me of someone, too. Only I don't know who.\"\n\nBoyd gulped. \"I'll shave it off,\" he said, with the air of a man who\ncan do no more to propitiate the Gods.\n\n\"You will not,\" Malone said firmly. \"Touch but a hair of yon black\nchin, and I'll peel off your entire skin.\"\n\nBoyd winced.\n\n\"Now,\" Malone said, \"go back to that costume shop and arrange things.\nHere.\" He fished in his pockets and came out with a crumpled slip of\npaper and handed it to Boyd. \"That's a list of my clothing sizes. Get\nanother list from B--Miss Wilson.\" Boyd nodded. Malone thought he\ndetected a strange glint in the other man's eye. \"Don't measure her\nyourself,\" he said. \"Just ask her.\"\n\nBoyd scratched his bearded chin and nodded slowly. \"All right, Ken,\"\nhe said. \"But if we just don't get anywhere, don't blame me.\"\n\n\"If you get anywhere,\" Malone said, \"I'll snatch you baldheaded. And\nI'll leave the beard.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean with Miss Wilson, Ken,\" Boyd said. \"I meant in\ngeneral.\" He left, with the air of a man whose world has betrayed him.\nHis back looked, to Malone, like the back of a man on his way to the\nscaffold or guillotine.\n\nThe door closed.\n\nNow, Malone thought, who does that beard remind me of? Who do I know\nwho knows Miss Thompson?\n\nAnd what difference does it make?\n\nNevertheless, he told himself, Boyd's beard (Beard's boyd?) was really\nan admirable fact of nature. Ever since beards had become popular\nagain in the mid-sixties, and FBI agents had been permitted to wear\nthem, Malone had thought about growing one. But, somehow, it didn't\nseem right.\n\nNow, looking at Boyd, he began to think about the prospect again.\n\nHe shrugged the notion away. There were things to do.\n\nHe picked up the phone and called Information.\n\n\"Can you give me,\" he said, \"the number of the Desert Edge\nSanatorium?\"\n\n                              * * * * *\n\nThe crimson blob of the setting sun was already painting the desert\nsky with its customary purples and oranges by the time the little\ncaravan arrived at the Desert Edge Sanatorium, a square white building\nseveral miles out of Las Vegas. Malone, in the first car, wondered\nbriefly about the kind of patients they catered to. People driven mad\nby vingt-et-un or poker-dice? Neurotic chorus ponies? Gambling czars\nwith delusions of non-persecution?\n\nSitting in the front seat next to Boyd, he watched the unhappy San\nFrancisco agent manipulating the wheel. In the back seat, Queen\nElizabeth Thompson and Lady Barbara, the nurse, were located, and Her\nMajesty was chattering away like a magpie.\n\nMalone eyed the rearview mirror to get a look at the car following\nthem and the two local FBI agents in it. They were, he thought,\nunbelievably lucky. He had to sit and listen to the Royal Personage in\nthe back seat.\n\n\"Of course, as soon as Parliament convenes and recognizes me,\" she was\nsaying, \"I shall confer personages on all of you. Right now, the best\nI could do was to knight you all, and of course that's hardly enough.\nBut I think I shall make Sir Kenneth the Duke of Columbia.\"\n\nSir Kenneth, Malone realized, was himself. He wondered how he'd like\nbeing Duke of Columbia--and wouldn't the President be surprised!\n\n\"And Sir Thomas,\" the Queen continued, \"will be the Duke of--what? Sir\nThomas?\"\n\n\"Yes, Your Majesty?\" Boyd said, trying to sound both eager and\nproperly respectful.\n\n\"What would you like to be Duke of?\" she said.\n\n\"Oh,\" Boyd said after a second's thought, \"anything that pleases Your\nMajesty.\" But apparently, his thoughts gave him away.\n\n\"You're from upstate New York?\" the Queen said. \"How very nice. Then\nyou must be made the Duke of Poughkeepsie.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Your Majesty,\" Boyd said. Malone thought he detected a\nnote of pride in the man's voice, and shot a glance at Boyd, but the\nagent was driving with a serene face and an economy of motion.\n\n_Duke of Poughkeepsie!_ Malone thought. _Hah!_\n\nHe leaned back and adjusted his fur-trimmed coat. The plume that fell\nfrom his cap kept tickling his neck, and he brushed at it without\nsuccess.\n\nAll four of the inhabitants of the car were dressed in late Sixteenth\nCentury costumes, complete with ruffs and velvet and lace filigree.\nHer Majesty and Lady Barbara were wearing the full skirts and small\nskullcaps of the era (and on Barbara, Malone thought privately, the\nlow-cut gowns didn't look at all disappointing), and Sir Thomas and\nMalone (Sir Kenneth, he thought sourly) were clad in doublet, hose and\nlong coats with fur trim and slashed sleeves. And all of them were\nloaded down, weighted down, staggeringly, with gems.\n\nNaturally, the gems were fake. But then, Malone thought, the Queen was\nmad. It all balanced out in the end.\n\nAs they approached the sanitarium, Malone breathed a thankful prayer\nthat he'd called up to tell the head physician how they'd all be\ndressed. If he hadn't....\n\nHe didn't want to think about that.\n\nHe didn't even want to pass it by hurriedly on a dark night.\n\nThe head physician, Dr. Frederic Dowson, was waiting for them on the\nsteps of the building. He was a tall, thin, cadaverous-looking man\nwith almost no hair and very deep-sunken eyes. He had the kind of face\nthat a gushing female would probably describe, Malone thought, as\n\"craggy,\" but it didn't look in the least attractive to Malone.\nInstead, it looked tough and forbidding.\n\nHe didn't turn a hair as the magnificently robed Boyd slid from the\nfront seat, opened the rear door, doffed his plumed hat, and in one\nlow sweep made a great bow. \"We are here, Your Majesty,\" Boyd said.\n\nHer Majesty got out, clutching at her voluminous skirts in a worried\nmanner, to keep from catching them on the door-jamb. \"You know, Sir\nThomas,\" she said when she was standing free of the car, \"I think we\nmust be related.\"\n\n\"Ah?\" Boyd said worriedly.\n\n\"I'm certain of it, in fact,\" Her Majesty went on. \"You look just\nexactly like my poor father. Just exactly. I dare say you come from\none of the sinister branches of the family. Perhaps you are a half-\nbrother of mine--removed, of course.\"\n\nMalone grinned, and tried to hide the expression. Boyd was looking\npuzzled, then distantly angered. Nobody had ever called him\nillegitimate in just that way before.\n\nBut Her Majesty was absolutely right, Malone thought. The agent had\nalways reminded him of someone, and now, at last, he knew exactly who.\nThe hair hadn't been black, either, but red.\n\nBoyd was, in Elizabethan costume, the deadest of dead ringers for\nHenry VIII.\n\nMalone went up the steps to where Dr. Dowson was standing.\n\n\"I'm Malone,\" he said, checking a tendency to bow. \"I called earlier\ntoday. Is this William Logan of yours ready to go? We can take him\nback with us in the second car.\"\n\nDr. Dowson compressed his lips and looked worried. \"Come in, Mr.\nMalone,\" he said. He turned just as the second carload of FBI agents\nbegan emptying itself over the hospital grounds.\n\nThe entire procession filed into the hospital office, the two local\nagents following up the rear. Since they were not a part of Her\nMajesty's personal retinue, they had not been required to wear court\ncostumes. In a way, Malone was beginning to feel sorry for them. He\nhimself cut a nice figure in the outfit, he thought--rather like Errol\nFlynn in the old black-and-white print of _The Prince and the Pauper_.\n\nBut there was no denying that the procession looked strange. File\nclerks and receptionists stopped their work to gape at the four\nbedizened walkers and their plainly dressed satellites. Malone needed\nno telepathic talent to tell what they were thinking.\n\n\"A whole roundup of nuts,\" they were thinking. \"And those two fellows\nin the back must be bringing them in--along with Dr. Dowson.\"\n\nMalone straightened his spine. Really, he didn't see why Elizabethan\ncostumes had ever gone out of style. Elizabeth was back, wasn't she--\neither Elizabeth II, on the throne, or Elizabeth I, right behind him.\nEither way you looked at it....\n\nWhen they were all inside the waiting room, Dr. Dowson said: \"Now, Mr.\nMalone, just what is all this about?\" He rubbed his long hands\ntogether. \"I fail to see the humor of the situation.\"\n\n\"Humor?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Doctor,\" Barbara Wilson began, \"let me explain. You see--\"\n\n\"These ridiculous costumes,\" Dr. Dowson said, waving a hand at them.\n\"You may feel that poking fun at insanity is humorous, Mr. Malone, but\nlet me tell you--\"\n\n\"It wasn't like that at all,\" Boyd said.\n\n\"And,\" Dr. Dowson continued in a somewhat louder voice, \"wanting to\ntake Mr. Logan away from us. Mr. Logan is a very sick man, Mr. Malone.\nHe should be properly cared for.\"\n\n\"I promise we'll take good care of him,\" Malone said earnestly. The\nElizabethan clothes were fine outdoors, but in a heated room one had a\ntendency to sweat.\n\n\"I take leave to doubt that,\" Dr. Dowson said, eyeing their costumes\npointedly.\n\n\"Miss Wilson here,\" Malone volunteered, \"is a trained psychiatric\nnurse.\"\n\nBarbara, in her gown, stepped forward. \"Dr. Dowson,\" she said, \"let me\nassure you that these costumes have their purpose. We--\"\n\n\"Not only that,\" Malone said. \"There are a group of trained men from\nSt. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington who are going to take the best\nof care of him.\" He said nothing whatever about Yucca Flats, or about\ntelepathy.\n\nWhy spread around information unnecessarily?\n\n\"But I don't understand,\" Dr. Dowson said. \"What interest could the\nFBI have in an insane man?\"\n\n\"That's none of your business,\" Malone said. He reached inside his\nfur-trimmed robe and, again suppressing a tendency to bow deeply,\nwithdrew an impressive-looking legal document. \"This,\" he said, \"is a\ncourt order, instructing you to hand over to us the person of one\nWilliam Logan, herein identified and described.\" He waved it at the\nDoctor.\n\n\"That's your William Logan,\" he said, \"only now he's ours.\"\n\nDr. Dowson took the papers and put in some time frowning at them. Then\nhe looked up again at Malone. \"I assume that I have some discretion in\nthis matter,\" he said. \"And I wonder if you realize just how ill Mr.\nLogan is? We have his case histories here, and we have worked with him\nfor some time.\"\n\nBarbara Wilson said: \"But--\"\n\n\"I might say that we are beginning to understand his illness,\" Dr.\nDowson said. \"I honestly don't think it would be proper to transfer\nthis work to another group of therapists. It might set his illness\nback--cause, as it were, a relapse. All our work could easily be\nnullified.\"\n\n\"Please, Doctor,\" Barbara Wilson began.\n\n\"I'm afraid the court order's got to stand,\" Malone said. Privately,\nhe felt sorry for Dr. Dowson, who was, obviously enough, a\nconscientious man trying to do the best he could for his patient. But-\n\n\"I'm sorry, Dr. Dowson,\" he said. \"We'll expect that you send all of\nyour data to the government psychiatrists--and, naturally, any concern\nfor the patient's welfare will be our concern also. The FBI isn't\nanxious for its workers to get the reputation of careless men.\" He\npaused, wondering what other bone he could throw the man. \"I have no\ndoubt that the St. Elizabeth's men will be happy to accept your\ncooperation,\" he said at last. \"But, I'm afraid that our duty is\nclear. William Logan goes with us.\"\n\nDr. Dowson looked at them sourly. \"Does he have to get dressed up like\na masquerade, too?\" Before Malone could answer, the psychiatrist\nadded: \"Anyhow, I don't even know you're FBI men. After all, why\nshould I comply with orders from a group of men, dressed insanely,\nwhom I don't even know?\"\n\nMalone didn't say anything. He just got up and walked to a phone on a\nsmall table, near the wall. Next to it was a door, and Malone wondered\nuncomfortably what was behind it. Maybe Dr. Dowson had a small arsenal\nthere, to protect his patients and prevent people from pirating them.\n\nHe looked back at the set and dialed Burris' private number in\nWashington. When the Director's face appeared on the screen, Malone\nsaid: \"Mr. Burris, will you please identify me to Dr. Dowson?\" He\nlooked over at Dowson. \"You recognize Mr. Andrew J. Burris, I\nsuppose?\" he said.\n\nDowson nodded. His grim face showed a faint shock. He walked to the\nphone, and Malone stepped back to let him talk with Burris.\n\n\"My name is Dowson,\" he said. \"I'm psychiatric director here at Desert\nEdge Sanatorium. And your men--\"\n\n\"My men have orders to take William Logan from your care,\" Burris\nsaid.\n\n\"That's right,\" Dowson said. \"But--\"\n\nWhile they were talking, Queen Elizabeth I sidled quietly up to Malone\nand tapped him on the shoulder.\n\n\"Sir Kenneth,\" she whispered in the faintest of voices, \"I know where\nyour telepathic spy is. And I know _who_ he is.\"\n\n\"Who?\" Malone said. \"What? Why? Where?\" He blinked and whirled. It\ncouldn't be true. They couldn't solve the case so easily.\n\nBut the Queen's face was full of a majestic assurance. \"He's right\nthere,\" she said, and she pointed.\n\nMalone followed her finger.\n\nIt was aimed directly at the glowing image of Andrew J. Burris,\nDirector of the FBI.\n\n\n                                  5\n\nMalone opened his mouth, but nothing came out. Not even air.\n\nHe wasn't breathing.\n\nHe stared at Burris for a long moment, then took a breath and looked\nagain at Her Majesty. \"The spy?\" he whispered.\n\n\"That's right,\" she said.\n\n\"But that's--\" He had to fight for control. \"That's the head of the\nFBI,\" he managed to say. \"Do you mean to say he's a spy?\"\n\nBurris was saying: \"... I'm afraid this is a matter of importance,\nDr. Dowson. We cannot tolerate delay. You have the court order. Obey\nit.\"\n\n\"Very well, Mr. Burris,\" Dowson said with an obvious lack of grace.\n\"I'll release him to Mr. Malone immediately, since you insist.\"\n\nMalone stared, fascinated. Then he turned back to the little old lady.\n\"Do you mean to tell me,\" he said, \"that Andrew J. Burris is a\ntelepathic spy?\"\n\n\"Oh, dear me,\" Her Majesty said, obviously aghast. \"My goodness\ngracious. Is that Mr. Burris on the screen?\"\n\n\"It is,\" Malone assured her. A look out of the corner of his eye told\nhim that neither Burris, in Washington, nor Dowson or any others in\nthe room, had heard any of the conversation. Malone lowered his\nwhisper some more, just in case. \"That's the head of the FBI,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"Well, then,\" Her Majesty said, \"Mr. Burris couldn't possibly be a\nspy, then, could he? Not if he's the head of the FBI. Of course not.\nMr. Burris simply isn't a spy. He isn't the type. Forget all about Mr.\nBurris.\"\n\n\"I can't,\" Malone said at random. \"I work for him.\" He closed his\neyes. The room, he had discovered, was spinning slightly. \"Now,\" he\nsaid, \"you're sure he's not a spy?\"\n\n\"Certainly I'm sure,\" she said, with her most regal tones. \"Do you\ndoubt the word of your sovereign?\"\n\n\"Not exactly,\" Malone said. Truthfully, he wasn't at all sure. Not at\nall. But why tell that to the Queen?\n\n\"Shame on you,\" she said. \"You shouldn't even think such things. After\nall, I am the Queen, aren't I?\" But there was a sweet, gentle smile on\nher face when she spoke; she didn't seem to be really irritated.\n\n\"Sure you are,\" Malone said. \"But--\"\n\n\"Malone!\" It was Burris' voice, from the phone. Malone spun around.\n\"Take Mr. Logan,\" Burris said, \"and get going. There's been enough\ndelay as it is.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Malone said. \"Right away, sir. Anything else?\"\n\n\"That's all,\" Burris said. \"Good night.\" The screen blanked.\n\nThere was a little silence.\n\n\"All right, Doctor,\" Boyd said. He looked every inch a king, and\nMalone knew exactly what king. \"Bring him out.\"\n\nDr. Dowson heaved a great sigh. \"Very well,\" he said heavily. \"But I\nwant it known that I resent this highhanded treatment, and I shall\nwrite a letter complaining of it.\" He pressed a button on an\ninstrument panel in his desk. \"Bring Mr. Logan in,\" he said.\n\nMalone wasn't in the least worried about the letter. Burris, he knew,\nwould take care of anything like that. And, besides, he had other\nthings to think about.\n\nThe door to the next room had opened almost immediately, and two\nhusky, white-clad men were bringing in a strait-jacketed figure whose\narms were wrapped against his chest, while the jacket's extra-long\nsleeves were tied behind his back. He walked where the attendants led\nhim, but his eyes weren't looking at anything in the room. They stared\nat something far away and invisible, an impalpable shifting\nnothingness somewhere in the infinite distances beyond the world.\n\nFor the first time, Malone felt the chill of panic. Here, he thought,\nwas insanity of a very real and frightening kind. Queen Elizabeth\nThompson was one thing--and she was almost funny, and likeable, after\nall. But William Logan was something else, and something that sent a\nwave of cold shivering into the room.\n\nWhat made it worse was that Logan wasn't a man, but a boy, barely\nnineteen. Malone had known that, of course--but seeing it was\nsomething different. The lanky, awkward figure wrapped in a hospital\nstrait-jacket was horrible, and the smooth, unconcerned face was,\nsomehow, worse. There was no threat in that face, no terror or anger\nor fear. It was merely--a blank.\n\nIt was not a human face. Its complete lack of emotion or expression\ncould have belonged to a sleeping child of ten--or to a member of a\ndifferent race. Malone looked at the boy, and looked away.\n\nWas it possible that Logan knew what he was thinking?\n\n_Answer me_, he thought, directly at the still boy.\n\nThere was no reply, none at all. Malone forced himself to look away.\nBut the air in the room seemed to have become much colder.\n\nThe attendants stood on either side of him, waiting. For one long\nsecond no one moved, and then Dr. Dowson reached into his desk drawer\nand produced a sheaf of papers.\n\n\"If you'll sign these for the government,\" he said, \"you may have Mr.\nLogan. There seems little else that I can do, Mr. Malone--in spite of\nmy earnest pleas--\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Malone said. After all, he _needed_ Logan, didn't he?\nAfter a look at the boy, he wasn't sure any more--but the Queen had\nsaid she wanted him, and the Queen's word was law. Or what passed for\nlaw, anyhow, at least for the moment.\n\nMalone took the papers and looked them over. There was nothing special\nabout them; they were merely standard release forms, absolving the\nstaff and management of Desert Edge Sanatorium from every conceivable\nresponsibility under any conceivable circumstances, as far as William\nLogan was concerned. Dr. Dowson gave Malone a look that said: \"Very\nwell, Mr. Malone; I will play Pilate and wash my hands of the matter--\nbut you needn't think I like it.\" It was a lot for one look to say,\nbut Dr. Dowson's dark and sunken eyes got the message across with no\nloss in transmission. As a matter of fact, there seemed to be more\ncoming--a much less printable message was apparently on the way\nthrough those glittering, sad and angry eyes.\n\nMalone avoided them nervously, and went over the papers again instead.\nAt last he signed them and handed them back. \"Thanks for your\ncooperation, Dr. Dowson,\" he said briskly, feeling ten kinds of a\ntraitor.\n\n\"Not at all,\" Dowson said bitterly. \"Mr. Logan is now in your custody.\nI must trust you to take good care of him.\"\n\n\"The best care we can,\" Malone said. It didn't seem sufficient. He\nadded: \"The best possible care, Doctor,\" and tried to look dependable\nand trustworthy, like a Boy Scout. He was aware that the effort failed\nmiserably.\n\nAt his signal, the two plainclothes FBI men took over from the\nattendants. They marched Logan out to their car, and Malone led the\nprocession back to Boyd's automobile, a procession that consisted (in\norder) of Sir Kenneth Malone, prospective Duke of Columbia, Queen\nElizabeth I, Lady Barbara, prospective Duchess of an unspecified\ncounty, and Sir Thomas Boyd, prospective Duke of Poughkeepsie. Malone\nhummed a little of the first _Pomp and Circumstance_ march as they\nwalked; somehow, he thought it was called for.\n\nThey piled into the car, Boyd at the wheel with Malone next to him,\nand the two ladies in back, with Queen Elizabeth sitting directly\nbehind Sir Thomas. Boyd started the engine and they turned and roared\noff.\n\n\"Well,\" said Her Majesty with an air of great complacence, \"that's\nthat. That makes six of us.\"\n\nMalone looked around the car. He counted the people. There were four.\nHe said, puzzled: \"Six?\"\n\n\"That's right, Sir Kenneth,\" Her Majesty said. \"You have it exactly.\nSix.\"\n\n\"You mean six telepaths?\" Sir Thomas asked in a deferent tone of\nvoice.\n\n\"Certainly I do,\" Her Majesty replied. \"We telepaths, you know, must\nstick together. That's the reason I got poor little Willie out of that\nsanatorium of his, you know--and, of course, the others will be\njoining us.\"\n\n\"Don't you think it's time for your nap, dear?\" Lady Barbara put in\nsuddenly.\n\n\"My _what_?\" It was obvious that Queen Elizabeth was Not Amused.\n\n\"Your nap, dear,\" Lady Barbara said.\n\n\"Don't call me dear,\" Her Majesty snapped.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Your Majesty,\" Barbara murmured. \"But really--\"\n\n\"My dear girl,\" Her Majesty said, \"I am not a child. I am your\nsovereign. Do try to have a little respect. Why, I remember when\nShakespeare used to say to me--but that's no matter, not now.\"\n\n\"About those telepaths--\" Boyd began.\n\n\"Telepaths,\" Her Majesty said. \"Ah, yes. We must all stick together.\nIn the hospital, you know, we had a little joke--the patients for\nInsulin Shock Therapy used to say: 'If we don't stick together, we'll\nall be stuck separately.' Do you see, Sir Thomas?\"\n\n\"But,\" Sir Kenneth Malone said, trying desperately to return to the\npoint. _\"Six?\"_ He had counted them up in his mind. Burris had\nmentioned one found in St. Elizabeths, and two more picked up later.\nWith Queen Elizabeth, and now William Logan, that made five.\n\nUnless the Queen was counting him in. There didn't seem any good\nreason why not.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" Her Majesty said with a little trill of laughter, \"not you,\nSir Kenneth. I meant Mr. Miles.\"\n\nSir Thomas Boyd asked: \"Mr. Miles?\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Her Majesty said. \"His name is Barry Miles, and your\nFBI men found him an hour ago in New Orleans. They're bringing him to\nYucca Flats to meet the rest of us; isn't that nice?\"\n\nLady Barbara cleared her throat.\n\n\"It really isn't necessary for you to try to get my attention, dear,\"\nthe Queen said. \"After all, I do know what you're thinking.\"\n\nLady Barbara blinked. \"I still want to suggest, respectfully, about\nthat nap--\" she began.\n\n\"My dear girl,\" the Queen said, with the faintest trace of impatience,\n\"I do not feel the least bit tired, and this is such an exciting day\nthat I just don't want to miss any of it. Besides, I've already told\nyou I don't want a nap. It isn't polite to be insistent to your\nQueen--no matter how strongly you feel about a matter. I'm sure you'll\nlearn to understand that, dear.\"\n\nLady Barbara opened her mouth, shut it again, and opened it once more.\n\"My goodness,\" she said.\n\n\"That's the idea,\" Her Majesty said approvingly. \"Think before you\nspeak--and then don't speak. It really isn't necessary, since I know\nwhat you're thinking.\"\n\nMalone said grimly: \"About this new telepath--this Barry Miles. Did\nthey find him--\"\n\n\"In a nut-house?\" Her Majesty said sweetly. \"Why, of course, Sir\nKenneth. You were quite right when you thought that telepaths went\ninsane because they had a sense they couldn't effectively use, and\nbecause no one believed them. How would you feel, if nobody believed\nyou could see?\"\n\n\"Strange,\" Malone admitted.\n\n\"There,\" Her Majesty said. \"You see? Telepaths do go insane--it's sort\nof an occupational disease. Of course, not all of them are insane.\"\n\n\"Not all of them?\" Malone felt the faint stirrings of hope. Perhaps\nthey would turn up a telepath yet who was completely sane and\nrational.\n\n\"There's me, of course,\" Her Majesty said.\n\nLady Barbara gulped audibly. Boyd said nothing, but gripped the wheel\nof the car more tightly.\n\nAnd Malone thought to himself: _That's right. There's Queen\nElizabeth--who says she isn't crazy._\n\nAnd then he thought of one more sane telepath. But the knowledge\ndidn't make him feel any better.\n\nIt was, of course, the spy.\n\nHow many more are going to turn up? Malone wondered.\n\n\"Oh, that's about all of us,\" the Queen said. \"There is one more, but\nshe's in a hospital in Honolulu, and your men won't find her until\ntomorrow.\"\n\nBoyd turned. \"Do you mean you can foretell the future, too?\" he asked\nin a strained voice.\n\nLady Barbara screamed: \"Keep your eyes on the wheel and your hands on\nthe road!\"\n\n\"What?\" Boyd said.\n\nThere was a terrific blast of noise, and a truck went by in the\nopposite direction. The driver, a big, ugly man with no hair on his\nhead, leaned out to curse at the quartet, but his mouth remained open.\nHe stared at the four Elizabethans and said nothing at all as he\nwhizzed by.\n\n\"What was that?\" Boyd asked faintly.\n\n\"That,\" Malone snapped, \"was a truck. And it was due entirely to the\nmercy of God that we didn't hit it. Barbara's right. Keep your eyes on\nthe wheel and your hands on the road.\" He paused and thought that\nover. Then he said: \"Does that mean anything at all?\"\n\n\"Lady Barbara was confused by the excitement,\" the Queen said calmly.\n\n\"It's all right now, dear.\"\n\nLady Barbara blinked across the seat. \"I was--afraid,\" she said.\n\n\"It's all right,\" the Queen said. \"I'll take care of you.\"\n\n\"This,\" Malone announced to no one in particular, \"is ridiculous.\"\n\nBoyd swept the car around a curve and concentrated grimly on the road.\nAfter a second the Queen said: \"Since you're still thinking about the\nquestion, I'll answer you.\"\n\n\"What question?\" Malone said, thoroughly baffled.\n\n\"Sir Thomas asked me if I could foretell the future,\" the Queen said\nequably. \"Of course I can't. That's silly. Just because I'm immortal\nand I'm a telepath, don't go hog-wild.\"\n\n\"Then how did you know the FBI agents were going to find the girl in\nHonolulu tomorrow?\" Boyd said.\n\n\"Because,\" the Queen said, \"they're thinking about looking in the\nhospital tomorrow, and when they look they'll certainly find her.\"\n\nBoyd said: \"Oh,\" and was silent.\n\nBut Malone had a grim question. \"Why didn't you tell me about these\nother telepaths before?\" he said. \"You could have saved us a lot of\nwork.\"\n\n\"Oh, heavens to Betsy, Sir Kenneth,\" Her Majesty exclaimed. \"How could\nI? After all, the proper precautions had to be taken first, didn't\nthey? I told you all the others were crazy--_really_ crazy, I mean.\nAnd they just wouldn't be safe without the proper precautions.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you ought to go back to the hospital, too,\" Barbara said, and\nadded: \"Your Majesty,\" just in time.\n\n\"But if I did, dear,\" Her Majesty said, \"you'd lose your chance to\nbecome a Duchess, and that wouldn't be at all nice. Besides, I'm\nhaving so much _fun_!\" She trilled a laugh again. \"Riding around like\nthis is just wonderful!\" she said.\n\n_And you're important for national security_, Malone said to himself.\n\n\"That's right, Sir Kenneth,\" the Queen said. \"The country needs me,\nand I'm happy to serve. That is the job of a sovereign.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" Malone said, hoping it was.\n\n\"Well, then,\" said Her Majesty, \"that settles that. We have a whole\nnight ahead of us, Sir Kenneth. What do you say we make a night of\nit?\"\n\n\"Knight who?\" Malone said. He felt confused again. It seemed as if he\nwas always feeling confused lately.\n\n\"Don't be silly, Sir Kenneth,\" Her Majesty said. \"There are times and\ntimes.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said at random. _And time and a half_, he thought.\n_Possibly for overtime._ \"What is Your Majesty thinking of?\" he asked\nwith trepidation.\n\n\"I want to take a tour of Las Vegas,\" Her Majesty said primly.\n\nLady Barbara shook her head. \"I'm afraid that's not possible, Your\nMajesty,\" she said.\n\n\"And why not, pray?\" Her Majesty said. \"No. I can see what you're\nthinking. It's not safe to let me go wandering around in a strange\ncity, and particularly if that city is Las Vegas. Well, dear, I can\nassure you that it's perfectly safe.\"\n\n\"We've got work to do,\" Boyd contributed.\n\nMalone said nothing. He stared bleakly at the hood ornament on the\ncar.\n\n\"I have made my wishes known,\" the Queen said.\n\nLady Barbara said: \"But--\"\n\nBoyd, however, knew when to give in. \"Yes, Your Majesty,\" he said.\n\nShe smiled graciously at him, and answered Lady Barbara only by a\nslight lift of her regal eyebrow.\n\nMalone had been thinking about something else. When he was sure he had\na firm grip on himself he turned. \"Your Majesty, tell me something,\"\nhe said. \"You can read my mind, right?\"\n\n\"Well, of course, Sir Kenneth,\" Her Majesty said. \"I thought I'd\nproved that to you. And, as for what you're about to ask--\"\n\n\"No,\" Malone said. \"Please. Let me ask the questions before you answer\nthem. It's less confusing that way. I'll cheerfully admit that it\nshouldn't be--but it is. Please?\"\n\n\"Certainly, Sir Kenneth, if you wish,\" the Queen said. She folded her\nhands in her lap and waited quietly.\n\n\"Okay,\" Malone said. \"Now, if you can read my mind, then you must know\nthat I don't _really_ believe that you are Queen Elizabeth of England.\nThe First, I mean.\"\n\n\"Mr. Malone,\" Barbara Wilson said suddenly. \"I--\"\n\n\"It's all right, child,\" the Queen said. \"He doesn't disturb me. And I\ndo wish you'd call him Sir Kenneth. That's his title, you know.\"\n\n\"Now that's what I mean,\" Malone said. \"Why do you want us to _act_ as\nif we believe you, when you know we don't?\"\n\n\"Because that's the way people do act,\" the Queen said calmly. \"Very\nfew people really believe that their so-called superiors _are_\nsuperior. Almost none of them do, in fact.\"\n\n\"Now wait a minute,\" Boyd began.\n\n\"No, no, it's quite true,\" the Queen said, \"and, unpleasant as it may\nbe, we must learn to face the truth. That's the path of sanity.\" Lady\nBarbara made a strangled noise but Her Majesty continued, unruffled.\n\"Nearly everybody suffers from the silly delusion that he's possibly\nequal to, but very probably superior to, everybody else--my goodness,\nwhere would we be if that were true?\"\n\nMalone felt that a comment was called for, and he made one. \"Who\nknows?\" he said.\n\n\"All the things people do toward their superiors,\" the Queen said,\n\"are done for social reasons. For instance, Sir Kenneth: you don't\nrealize fully how you feel about Mr. Burris.\"\n\n\"He's a hell of a fine guy,\" Malone said. \"I work for him. He's a good\nDirector of the FBI.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" the Queen said. \"But you believe you could do the job\njust as well, or perhaps a little better.\"\n\n\"I do not,\" Malone said angrily.\n\nHer Majesty reserved a dignified silence.\n\nAfter a while Malone said: \"And what if I do?\"\n\n\"Why, nothing,\" Her Majesty said. \"You don't think Mr. Burris is any\nsmarter or better than you are--but you treat him as if you did. All I\nam insisting on is the same treatment.\"\n\n\"But if we don't believe--\" Boyd began.\n\n\"Bless you,\" Her Majesty said, \"I can't help the way you _think_, but,\nas Queen, I do have some control over the way you _act_.\"\n\nMalone thought it over. \"You have a point there,\" he said at last.\n\nBarbara said: \"But--\"\n\n\"Yes, Sir Kenneth,\" the Queen said, \"I do.\" She seemed to be ignoring\nLady Barbara. Perhaps, Malone thought, she was still angry over the\nnap affair. \"It's not that,\" the Queen said.\n\n\"Not what?\" Boyd said, thoroughly confused.\n\n\"Not the naps,\" the Queen said.\n\n\"What naps?\" Boyd said. Malone said: \"I was thinking--\"\n\n\"Good,\" Boyd said. \"Keep it up. I'm driving. Everything's going to\nhell around me, but I'm driving.\"\n\nA red light appeared ahead. Boyd jammed on the brakes with somewhat\nmore than the necessary force, and Malone was thrown forward with a\ngrunt. Behind him there were two ladylike squeals.\n\nMalone struggled upright. \"Barbara?\" he called. \"Are you all right--\"\nThen he remembered the Queen.\n\n\"It's all right,\" Her Majesty said. \"I can understand your concern for\nLady Barbara.\" She smiled at Malone as he turned.\n\nMalone gaped at her. Of course she knew what he thought about Barbara;\nshe'd been reading his mind. And, apparently, she was on his side.\nThat was good, even though it made him slightly nervous to think\nabout.\n\n\"Now,\" the Queen said suddenly, \"what about tonight?\"\n\n\"Tonight?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course,\" the Queen said. She smiled, and put up a hand to pat\nat her white hair under the Elizabethan skullcap. \"I think I should\nlike to go to the Palace,\" she said. \"After all, isn't that where a\nQueen should be?\"\n\nBoyd said, in a kind of explosion: \"London? England?\"\n\n\"Oh, dear me....\" the Queen began, and Barbara said:\n\n\"I'm afraid that I simply can't allow anything like that. Overseas--\"\n\n\"I didn't mean overseas, dear,\" Her Majesty said. \"Sir Kenneth, please\nexplain to these people.\"\n\nThe Palace, Malone knew, was more properly known as the Golden Palace.\nIt was right in Las Vegas--convenient to all sources of money.\n\nAs a matter of fact, it was one of the biggest gambling houses along\nthe Las Vegas strip, a veritable chaos of wheels, cards, dice, chips\nand other such devices. Malone explained all this to the others,\nwondering meanwhile why Miss Thompson wanted to go there.\n\n\"Not Miss Thompson, _please_, Sir Kenneth,\" Her Majesty said.\n\n\"Not Miss Thompson what?\" Boyd said. \"What's going on anyhow?\"\n\n\"She's reading my mind,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Well, then,\" Boyd snapped, \"tell her to keep it to herself.\" The car\nstarted up again with a roar and Malone and the others were thrown\naround again, this time toward the back. There was a chorus of groans\nand squeals, and they were on their way once more.\n\n\"To reply to your question, Sir Kenneth,\" the Queen said.\n\nLady Barbara said, with some composure: \"What question--Your Majesty?\"\n\nThe Queen nodded regally at her. \"Sir Kenneth was wondering why I\nwished to go to the Golden Palace,\" she said. \"And my reply is this:\nit is none of your business why I want to go there. After all, is my\nword law, or isn't it?\"\n\nThere didn't seem to be a good enough answer to that, Malone thought\nsadly. He kept quiet and was relieved to note that the others did the\nsame. However, after a second he thought of something else.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he began carefully, \"we've got to go to Yucca Flats\ntomorrow. Remember?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" the Queen said. \"My memory is quite good, thank you. But\nthat is tomorrow morning. We have the rest of the night left. It's\nonly a little after nine, you know.\"\n\n\"Heavens,\" Barbara said. \"Is it that late?\"\n\n\"It's even later,\" Boyd said sourly. \"It's much later than you think.\"\n\n\"And it's getting later all the time,\" Malone added. \"Pretty soon the\nsun will go out and all life on earth will end. Won't that be nice and\npeaceful?\"\n\n\"I'm looking forward to it,\" Boyd said.\n\n\"I'm not,\" Barbara said. \"But I've got to get some sleep tonight, if\nI'm going to be any good at all tomorrow.\"\n\n_You're pretty good right now_, Malone thought, but he didn't say a\nword. He felt the Queen's eye on him but didn't turn around. After\nall, she was on his side--wasn't she?\n\nAt any rate, she didn't say anything.\n\n\"Perhaps it would be best,\" Barbara said, \"if you and I--Your\nMajesty--just went home and rested up. Some other time, then, when\nthere's nothing vital to do, we could--\"\n\n\"No,\" the Queen said. \"We couldn't. Really, Lady Barbara, how often\nwill I have to remind you of the duties you owe your sovereign--not\nthe least of which is obedience, as dear old Ben used to say.\"\n\n\"Ben?\" Malone said, and immediately wished he hadn't.\n\n\"Johnson, dear boy,\" the Queen said. \"Really a remarkable man--and\nsuch a good friend to poor Will. Why, did you ever hear the story of\nhow he actually paid Will's rent in London once upon a time? That was\nwhile Will and that Anne of his were having one of their arguments, of\ncourse. I didn't tell you that story, did I?\"\n\n\"No,\" Malone said truthfully, but his voice was full of foreboding.\n\"If I might remind Your Majesty of the subject,\" he added tentatively,\n\"I should like to say--\"\n\n\"Remind me of the subject!\" the Queen said, obviously delighted. \"What\na lovely pun! And how much better because purely unconscious! My, my,\nSir Kenneth, I never suspected you of a pointed sense of humor--could\nyou be a descendant of Sir Richard Greene, I wonder?\"\n\n\"I doubt it,\" Malone said. \"My ancestors were all poor but Irish.\" He\npaused. \"Or, if you prefer, Irish, but poor.\" Another pause, and then\nhe added: \"If that means anything at all. Which I doubt.\"\n\n\"In any case,\" the Queen said, her eyes twinkling, \"you were about to\nenter a new objection to our little visit to the Palace, were you\nnot?\"\n\nMalone admitted as much. \"I really think that--\"\n\nHer eyes grew suddenly cold. \"If I hear any more objections, Sir\nKenneth, I shall not only rescind your knighthood and--when I regain\nmy rightful kingdom--deny you your dukedom, but I shall refuse to\ncooperate any further in the business of Project Isle.\"\n\nMalone turned cold. His face, he knew without glancing in the mirror,\nwas white and pale. He thought of what Burris would do to him if he\ndidn't follow through on his assigned job.\n\nEven if he wasn't as good as Burris thought he was, he really liked\nbeing an FBI agent. He didn't want to be fired.\n\nAnd Burris had said: _\"Give her anything she wants.\"_\n\nHe gulped and tried to make his face look normal. \"All right,\" he\nsaid. \"Fine. We'll go to the Palace.\"\n\nHe tried to ignore the pall of apprehension that fell over the car.\n\n\n                                  6\n\nThe management of the Golden Palace had been in business for many\nlong, dreary, profitable years, and each member of the staff thought\nhe or she had seen just about everything there was to be seen. And\nthose that were new felt an obligation to _look_ as if they'd seen\neverything.\n\nTherefore, when the entourage of Queen Elizabeth I strolled into the\nmain salon, not a single eye was batted. Not a single gasp was heard.\n\nNevertheless, the staff kept a discreet eye on the crew. Drunks, rich\nmen or Arabian millionaires were all familiar. But a group out of the\nSixteenth Century was something else again.\n\nMalone almost strutted, conscious of the sidelong glances the group\nwas drawing. But it was obvious that Sir Thomas was the major\nattraction. Even if you could accept the idea of people in strange\ncostumes, the sight of a living, breathing absolute duplicate of King\nHenry VIII was a little too much to take. It has been reported that\ntwo ladies named Jane, and one named Catherine, came down with sudden\nheadaches and left the salon within five minutes of the group's\narrival.\n\nMalone felt he knew, however, why he wasn't drawing his full share of\nattention. He felt a little out of place.\n\nThe costume was one thing, and, to tell the truth, he was beginning to\nenjoy it. Even with the weight of the stuff, it was going to be a\nwrench to go back to single-breasted suits and plain white shirts. But\nhe did feel that he should have been carrying a sword.\n\nInstead, he had a .44 Magnum Colt snuggled beneath his left armpit.\n\nSomehow, a .44 Magnum Colt didn't seem as romantic as a sword. Malone\npictured himself saying: \"Take that, varlet.\" Was varlet what you\ncalled them, he wondered. Maybe it was valet.\n\n\"Take that, valet,\" he muttered. No, that sounded even worse. Oh,\nwell, he could look it up later.\n\nThe truth was that he had been born in the wrong century. He could\nimagine himself at the Mermaid Tavern, hob-nobbing with Shakespeare\nand all the rest of them. He wondered if Richard Greene would be\nthere. Then he wondered who Richard Greene was.\n\nBehind Sir Kenneth, Sir Thomas Boyd strode, looking majestic, as if he\nwere about to fling purses of gold to the citizenry. As a matter of\nfact, Malone thought, he was. They all were.\n\nPurses of good old United States of America gold.\n\nBehind Sir Thomas came Queen Elizabeth and her Lady-in-Waiting, Lady\nBarbara Wilson. They made a beautiful foursome.\n\n\"The roulette table,\" Her Majesty said with dignity. \"Precede me.\"\n\nThey pushed their way through the crowd. Most of the customers were\neither excited enough, drunk enough, or both to see nothing in the\nleast incongruous about a Royal Family of the Tudors invading the\nGolden Palace. Very few of them, as a matter of fact, seemed to notice\nthe group.\n\nThey were roulette players. They noticed nothing but the table and the\nwheel. Malone wondered what they were thinking about, decided to ask\nQueen Elizabeth, and then decided against it. He felt it would make\nhim nervous to know.\n\nHer Majesty took a handful of chips.\n\nThe handful was worth, Malone knew, exactly five thousand dollars.\nThat, he'd thought, ought to last them an evening, even in the Golden\nPalace. In the center of the strip, inside the city limits of Las\nVegas itself, the five thousand would have lasted much longer--but Her\nMajesty wanted the Palace, and the Palace it was.\n\nMalone began to smile. Since he couldn't avoid the evening, he was\ndetermined to enjoy it. It was sort of fun, in its way, indulging a\nsweet harmless old lady. And there was nothing they could do until the\nnext morning, anyhow.\n\nHis indulgent smile faded very suddenly.\n\nHer Majesty plunked the entire handful of chips--_five thousand\ndollars!_ Malone thought dazedly--onto the table. \"Five thousand,\" she\nsaid in clear, cool measured tones, \"on number one.\"\n\nThe croupier blinked only slightly. He bowed. \"Yes, Your Majesty,\" he\nsaid.\n\nMalone was briefly thankful, in the midst of his black horror, that he\nhad called the management and told them that the Queen's plays were\nbacked by the United States Government. Her Majesty was going to get\nunlimited credit--and a good deal of awed and somewhat puzzled\nrespect.\n\nMalone watched the spin begin with mixed feelings. There was five\nthousand dollars riding on the little ball. But, after all, Her\nMajesty was a telepath. Did that mean anything?\n\nHe hadn't decided by the time the wheel stopped, and by then he didn't\nhave to decide.\n\n\"Thirty-four,\" the croupier said tonelessly. \"Red, Even and High.\"\n\nHe raked in the chips with a nonchalant air.\n\nMalone felt as if he had swallowed his stomach. Boyd and Lady Barbara,\nstanding nearby, had absolutely no expressions on their faces. Malone\nneeded no telepath to tell him what they were thinking.\n\nThey were exactly the same as he was. They were incapable of thought.\n\nBut Her Majesty never batted an eyelash. \"Come, Sir Kenneth,\" she\nsaid. \"Let's go on to the poker tables.\"\n\nShe swept out. Her entourage followed her, shambling a little, and\nblank-eyed. Malone was still thinking about the five thousand dollars.\nOh, well, Burris had said to give the lady anything she wanted. _But\nmy God!_ he thought. _Did she have to play for royal stakes?_\n\n\"I am, after all, a Queen,\" she whispered back to him.\n\nMalone thought about the National Debt. He wondered if a million more\nor less would make any real difference. There would be questions asked\nin committees about it. He tried to imagine himself explaining the\nevening to a group of Congressmen. \"Well, you see, gentlemen, there\nwas this roulette wheel--\"\n\nHe gave it up.\n\nThen he wondered how much hotter the water was going to get, and he\nstopped thinking altogether in self-defense.\n\nIn the next room, there were scattered tables. At one, a poker game\nwas in full swing. Only five were playing; one, by his white-tie-and-\ntails uniform, was easily recognizable as a house dealer. The other\nfour were all men, one of them in full cowboy regalia. The Tudors\ndescended upon them with great suddenness, and the house dealer looked\nup and almost lost his cigarette.\n\n\"We haven't any money, Your Majesty,\" Malone whispered.\n\nShe smiled up at him sweetly, and then drew him aside. \"If you were a\ntelepath,\" she said, \"how would _you_ play poker?\"\n\nMalone thought about that for a minute, and then turned to look for\nBoyd. But Sir Thomas didn't even have to be given instructions.\n\"Another five hundred?\" he said.\n\nHer Majesty sniffed audibly. \"Another five thousand,\" she said\nregally.\n\nBoyd looked Malonewards. Malone looked defeated.\n\nBoyd turned with a small sigh and headed for the cashier's booth.\nThree minutes later, he was back with a fat fistful of chips.\n\n\"Five grand?\" Malone whispered to him.\n\n\"Ten,\" Boyd said. \"I know when to back a winner.\"\n\nHer Majesty went over to the table. The dealer had regained control,\nbut looked up at them with a puzzled stare.\n\n\"You know,\" the Queen said, with an obvious attempt to put the man at\nhis ease, \"I've always wanted to visit a gambling hall.\"\n\n\"Sure, lady,\" the dealer said. \"Naturally.\"\n\n\"May I sit down?\"\n\nThe dealer looked at the group. \"How about your friends?\" he said\ncautiously.\n\nThe queen shook her head. \"They would rather watch, I'm sure.\"\n\nFor once Malone blessed the woman's telepathic talent. He, Boyd and\nBarbara Wilson formed a kind of Guard of Honor around the chair which\nHer Majesty occupied. Boyd handed over the new pile of chips, and was\nfavored with a royal smile.\n\n\"This is a poker game, ma'am,\" the dealer said to her quietly.\n\n\"I know, I know,\" Her Majesty said with a trace of testiness. \"Roll\n'em.\"\n\nThe dealer stared at her popeyed. Next to her, the gentleman in the\ncowboy outfit turned. \"Ma'am, are you from around these parts?\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" the Queen said. \"I'm from England.\"\n\n\"England?\" The cowboy looked puzzled. \"You don't seem to have any\naccent, ma'am,\" he said at last.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" the Queen said. \"I've lost that; I've been over here\na great many years.\"\n\nMalone hoped fervently that Her Majesty wouldn't mention just how many\nyears. He didn't think he could stand it, and he was almost grateful\nfor the cowboy's nasal twang.\n\n\"Oil?\" he said.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" Her Majesty said. \"The Government is providing this money.\"\n\n\"The Government?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" Her Majesty said. \"The FBI, you know.\"\n\nThere was a long silence.\n\nAt last, the dealer said: \"Five-card draw your game, ma'am?\"\n\n\"If you please,\" Her Majesty said.\n\nThe dealer shrugged and, apparently, commended his soul to a gambler's\nGod. He passed the pasteboards around the table with the air of one\nwho will have nothing more to do with the world.\n\nHer Majesty picked up her hand.\n\n\"The ante's ten, ma'am,\" the dealer said softly.\n\nWithout looking, Her Majesty removed a ten-dollar chip from the pile\nbefore her and sent it spinning to the middle of the table.\n\nThe dealer opened his mouth, but said nothing. Malone, meanwhile, was\npeering over the Queen's shoulder.\n\nShe held a pair of nines, a four, a three and a Jack.\n\nThe man to the left of the dealer announced glumly: \"Can't open.\"\n\nThe next man grinned. \"Open for twenty,\" he said.\n\nMalone closed his eyes. He heard the cowboy say: \"I'm in,\" and he\nopened his eyes again. The Queen was pushing two ten-dollar chips\ntoward the center of the table.\n\nThe next man dropped, and the dealer looked round the table. \"How\nmany?\"\n\nThe man who couldn't open took three cards. The man who'd opened for\ntwenty stood pat. Malone shuddered invisibly. That, he figured, meant\na straight or better. And Queen Elizabeth Thompson was going in\nagainst at least a straight with a pair of nines, Jack high.\n\nFor the first time, it was borne in on Malone that being a telepath\ndid not necessarily mean that you were a good poker player. Even if\nyou knew what every other person at the table held, you could still\nmake a whole lot of stupid mistakes.\n\nHe looked nervously at Queen Elizabeth, but her face was serene.\nApparently she'd been following the thoughts of the poker players, and\nnot concentrating on him at all. That was a relief. He felt, for the\nfirst time in days, as if he could think freely.\n\nThe cowboy said: \"Two,\" and took them. It was Her Majesty's turn.\n\n\"I'll take two,\" she said, and threw away the three and four. It left\nher with the nine of spades and the nine of hearts, and the Jack of\ndiamonds.\n\nThese were joined, in a matter of seconds, by two bright new cards:\nthe six of clubs and the three of hearts.\n\nMalone closed his eyes. _Oh, well_, he thought.\n\nIt was only thirty bucks down the drain. Practically nothing.\n\nOf course Her Majesty dropped at once; knowing what the other players\nheld, she knew she couldn't beat them after the draw. But she did like\nto take long chances, Malone thought miserably. Imagine trying to fill\na full house on one pair!\n\nSlowly, as the minutes passed, the pile of chips before Her Majesty\ndwindled. Once Malone saw her win with two pair against a reckless man\ntrying to fill a straight on the other side of the table. But whatever\nwas going on, Her Majesty's face was as calm as if she were asleep.\n\nMalone's worked overtime. If the Queen hadn't been losing so\nobviously, the dealer might have mistaken the play of naked emotion\nacross his visage for a series of particularly obvious signals.\n\nAn hour went by. Barbara left to find a ladies' lounge where she could\nsit down and try to relax. Fascinated in a horrible sort of way, both\nMalone and Boyd stood, rooted to the spot, while hand after hand went\nby and the ten thousand dollars dwindled to half that, to a quarter,\nand even less....\n\nHer Majesty, it seemed, was a damn poor poker player.\n\nThe ante had been raised by this time.\n\nHer Majesty was losing one hundred dollars a hand, even before the\nbetting began. But she showed not the slightest indication to stop.\n\n\"We've got to get up in the morning,\" Malone announced to no one in\nparticular, when he thought he couldn't possibly stand another half-\nhour of the game.\n\n\"So we do,\" Her Majesty said with a little regretful sigh. \"Very well,\nthen. Just one more hand.\"\n\n\"It's a shame to lose you,\" the cowboy said to her, quite sincerely.\nHe had been winning steadily ever since Her Majesty sat down, and\nMalone thought that the man should, by this time, be awfully grateful\nto the United States Government. Somehow, he doubted that this\ngratitude existed.\n\nMalone wondered if she should be allowed to stay for one more hand.\nThere was, he estimated, about two thousand dollars in front of her.\nThen he wondered how he was going to stop her.\n\nThe cards were dealt.\n\nThe first man said quietly: \"Open for two hundred.\"\n\nMalone looked at the Queen's hand. It contained the Ace, King, Queen\nand ten of clubs--and the seven of spades.\n\n_Oh, no._ He thought. _She couldn't possibly be thinking of filling a\nflush._\n\nHe knew perfectly well that she was.\n\nThe second man said: \"And raise two hundred.\"\n\nThe Queen equably tossed (counting, Malone thought, the ante) five\nhundred into the pot.\n\nThe cowboy muttered to himself for a second, and finally shoved in his\nmoney.\n\n\"I think I'll raise it another five hundred,\" the Queen said calmly.\n\nMalone wanted to die of shock.\n\nUnfortunately, he remained alive and watching. He saw the last man,\nafter some debate internal, shove a total of one thousand dollars into\nthe pot.\n\n\"Cards?\" said the dealer. The first man said: \"One.\"\n\nIt was too much to hope for, Malone thought. If that first man were\ntrying to fill a straight or a flush, maybe he wouldn't make it. And\nmaybe something final would happen to all the other players. But that\nwas the only way he could see for Her Majesty to win.\n\nThe card was dealt. The second man stood pat and Malone's green tinge\nbecame obvious to the veriest dunce. The cowboy, on Her Majesty's\nright, asked for a card, received it and sat back without a trace of\nexpression.\n\nThe Queen said: \"I'll try one for size.\" She'd picked up poker lingo,\nand the basic rules of the game, Malone realized, from the other\nplayers--or possibly from someone at the hospital itself, years ago.\n\nHe wished she'd picked up something less dangerous instead, like a\nlove of big-game hunting, or stunt-flying.\n\nBut no. It had to be poker.\n\nThe Queen threw away her seven of spades, showing more sense than\nMalone had given her credit for at any time during the game. She let\nthe other card fall and didn't look at it.\n\nShe smiled up at Malone and Boyd. \"Live dangerously,\" she said gaily.\n\nMalone gave her a hollow laugh.\n\nThe last man drew one card, too, and the betting began.\n\nThe Queen's remaining thousand was gone before an eye could notice it.\nShe turned to Boyd.\n\n\"Sir Thomas,\" she said. \"Another five thousand, please. At once.\"\n\nBoyd said nothing at all, but marched off. Malone noticed, however,\nthat his step was neither as springy nor as confident as it had been\nbefore. For himself, Malone was sure that he could not walk at all.\n\nMaybe, he thought hopefully, the floor would open up and swallow them\nall. He tried to imagine explaining the loss of $20,000 to Burris and\nsome congressmen, and after that he watched the floor narrowly, hoping\nfor the smallest hint of a crack in the palazzo marble.\n\n\"May I raise the whole five thousand?\" the Queen said.\n\n\"It's okay with me,\" the dealer said. \"How about the rest of you?\"\n\nThe four grunts he got expressed a suppressed eagerness. The Queen\ntook the new chips Boyd had brought her and shoved them into the\ncenter of the table with a fine, careless gesture of her hand. She\nsmiled gaily at everybody. \"Seeing me?\" she said.\n\nEverybody was.\n\n\"Well, you see, it was this way,\" Malone muttered to himself,\nrehearsing. He half-thought that one of the others would raise again,\nbut no one did. After all, each of them must be convinced that he held\na great hand, and though raising had gone on throughout the hand, each\nmust now be afraid of going the least little bit too far and scaring\nthe others out.\n\n\"Mr. Congressman,\" Malone muttered. \"There's this game called poker.\nYou play it with cards and money. Chiefly money.\"\n\nThat wasn't any good.\n\n\"You've been called,\" the dealer said to the first man, who'd opened\nthe hand a year or so before.\n\n\"Why, sure,\" the player said, and laid down a pair of aces, a pair of\nthrees--and a four. One of the threes, and the four, were clubs. That\nreduced the already improbable chances of the Queen's coming up with a\nflush.\n\n\"Sorry,\" said the second man, and laid down a straight with a single\ngesture.\n\nThe straight was nine-high and there were no clubs in it. Malone felt\ndevoutly thankful for that.\n\nThe second man reached for the money but, under the popeyed gaze of\nthe dealer, the fifth man laid down another straight--this one ten\nhigh. The nine was a club Malone felt the odds go down, right in his\nown stomach.\n\nAnd now the cowboy put down his cards. The King of diamonds. The King\nof hearts. The Jack of diamonds. The Jack of spades. And--the Jack of\nhearts.\n\nFull house. \"Well,\" said the cowboy, \"I suppose that does it.\"\n\nThe Queen said: \"Please. One moment.\"\n\nThe cowboy stopped halfway in his reach for the enormous pile of\nchips. The Queen laid down her four clubs--Ace, King, Queen and ten--\nand for the first time flipped over her fifth card.\n\nIt was the Jack of clubs.\n\n\"My God,\" the cowboy said, and it sounded like a prayer. \"A royal\nflush.\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" the Queen said. \"What else?\"\n\nHer Majesty calmly scooped up the tremendous pile of chips. The\ncowboy's hands fell away. Five mouths were open around the table.\n\nHer Majesty stood up. She smiled sweetly at the men around the table.\n\"Thank you very much, gentlemen,\" she said. She handed the chips to\nMalone, who took them in nerveless fingers. \"Sir Kenneth,\" she said,\n\"I hereby appoint you temporary Chancellor of the Exchequer--at least\nuntil Parliament convenes.\"\n\nThere was, Malone thought, at least thirty-five thousand dollars in\nthe pile. He could think of nothing to say.\n\nSo, instead of using up words, he went and cashed in the chips. For\nonce, he realized, the Government had made money on an investment. It\nwas probably the first time since 1775.\n\nMalone thought vaguely that the government ought to make more\ninvestments like the one he was cashing in. If it did, the National\nDebt could be wiped out in a matter of days.\n\nHe brought the money back. Boyd and the Queen were waiting for him,\nbut Barbara was still in the ladies' lounge. \"She's on the way out,\"\nthe Queen informed him, and, sure enough, in a minute they saw the\nfigure approaching them. Malone smiled at her, and, tentatively, she\nsmiled back. They began the long march to the exit of the club, slowly\nand regally, though not by choice.\n\nThe crowd, it seemed, wouldn't let them go. Malone never found out,\nthen or later, how the news of Her Majesty's winnings had gone through\nthe place so fast, but everyone seemed to know about it. The Queen was\nthe recipient of several low bows and a few drunken curtsies, and,\nwhen they reached the front door at last, the doorman said in a most\nrespectful tone: \"Good evening, Your Majesty.\"\n\nThe Queen positively beamed at him. So, to his own great surprise, did\nSir Kenneth Malone.\n\nOutside, it was about four in the morning. They climbed into the car\nand headed back toward the hotel.\n\nMalone was the first to speak. \"How did you know that was a Jack of\nclubs?\" he said in a strangled sort of voice.\n\nThe little old lady said calmly: \"He was cheating.\"\n\n\"The dealer?\" Malone asked. The little old lady nodded. \"In _your_\nfavor?\"\n\n\"He couldn't have been cheating,\" Boyd said at the same instant. \"Why\nwould he want to give you all that money?\"\n\nThe little old lady shook her head. \"He didn't want to give it to me,\"\nshe said. \"He wanted to give it to the man in the cowboy's suit. His\nname is Elliott, by the way--Bernard L. Elliott. And he comes from\nWeehawken. But he pretends to be a Westerner so nobody will be\nsuspicious of him. He and the dealer are in cahoots--isn't that the\nword?\"\n\n\"Yes, Your Majesty,\" Boyd said. \"That's the word.\" His tone was awed\nand respectful, and the little old lady gave a nod and became Queen\nElizabeth I once more.\n\n\"Well,\" she said, \"the dealer and Mr. Elliott were in cahoots, and the\ndealer wanted to give the hand to Mr. Elliott. But he made a mistake,\nand dealt the Jack of clubs to me. I watched him, and, of course, I\nknew what he was thinking. The rest was easy.\"\n\n\"My God,\" Malone said. \"Easy.\" Barbara said: \"Did she win?\"\n\n\"She won,\" Malone said with what he felt was positively magnificent\nunderstatement.\n\n\"Good,\" Barbara said, and lost interest at once.\n\nMalone had seen the lights of a car in the rear-view mirror a few\nminutes before. When he looked now, the lights were still there--but\nthe fact just didn't register until, a couple of blocks later, the car\nbegan to pull around them on the left. It was a Buick, while Boyd's\nwas a new Lincoln, but the edge wasn't too apparent yet.\n\nMalone spotted the gun barrel protruding from the Buick and yelled\njust before the first shot went off.\n\nBoyd, at the wheel, didn't even bother to look. His reflexes took over\nand he slammed his foot down on the brake. The specially-built FBI\nLincoln slowed down instantly. The shotgun blast splattered the glass\nof the curved windshield all over--but none of it came into the car\nitself.\n\nMalone already had his hand on the butt of the .44 Magnum under his\nleft armpit, and he even had time to be grateful, for once, that it\nwasn't a smallsword. The women were in the back seat, frozen, and he\nyelled: \"Duck, damn it, duck!\" and felt, rather than saw, both of them\nsink down onto the floor of the car.\n\nThe Buick had slowed down, too, and the gun barrel was swiveling back\nfor a second shot. Malone felt naked and unprotected. The Buick and\nthe Lincoln were even on the road now.\n\nMalone had his revolver out. He fired the first shot without even\nrealizing fully that he'd done so, and he heard a piercing scream from\nBarbara in the back seat. He had no time to look back.\n\nA .44 Magnum is not, by any means, a small gun. As handguns go--\nrevolvers and automatics--it is about as large as a gun can get to be.\nAn ordinary car has absolutely no chance against it.\n\nMuch less the glass in an ordinary car.\n\nThe first slug drilled its way through the window glass as though it\nwere not there, and slammed its way through an even more unprotected\nobstacle, the frontal bones of the triggerman's skull. The second slug\nfrom Malone's gun followed it right away, and missed the hole the\nfirst slug had made by something less than an inch.\n\nThe big, apelike thug who was holding the shotgun had a chance to pull\nthe trigger once more, but he wasn't aiming very well. The blast\nmerely scored the paint off the top of the Lincoln.\n\nThe rear window of the Buick was open, and Malone caught sight of\nanother glint of blued steel from the corner of his eye. There was no\ntime to shift aim--not with bullets flying like swallows on the way to\nCapistrano. Malone thought faster than he had imagined himself capable\nof doing, and decided to aim for the driver.\n\nEvidently the man in the rear seat of the Buick had had the same\ninspiration. Malone blasted two more high-velocity lead slugs at the\ndriver of the big Buick, and at the same time the man in the Buick's\nrear seat fired at Boyd.\n\nBut Boyd had shifted tactics. He'd hit the brakes. Now he came down\nhard on the accelerator instead.\n\nThe chorus of shrieks from the Lincoln's back seat increased slightly\nin volume. Barbara, Malone knew, wasn't badly hurt; she hadn't even\nstopped for breath since the first shot had been fired. Anybody who\ncould scream like that, he told himself, had to be healthy.\n\nAs the Lincoln leaped ahead, Malone pulled the trigger of his .44\ntwice more. The heavy, high-speed chunks of streamlined copper-coated\nlead leaped from the muzzle of the gun and slammed into the driver of\nthe Buick without wasting any time. The Buick slewed across the\nhighway.\n\nThe two shots fired by the man in the back seat went past Malone's\nhead with a _whizz_, missing both him and Boyd by a margin too narrow\nto think about.\n\nBut those were the last shots. The only difference between the FBI and\nthe Enemy seemed to be determination and practice.\n\nThe Buick spun into a flat sideskid, swiveled on its wheels and\nslammed into the ditch at the side of the road, turning over and over,\nmaking a horrible noise, as it broke up.\n\nBoyd slowed the car again, just as there was a sudden blast of fire.\nThe Buick had burst into flame and was spitting heat and smoke and\nfire in all directions. Malone sent one more bullet after it in a last\nflurry of action--saving his last one for possible later emergencies.\n\nBoyd jammed on the brakes and the Lincoln came to a screaming halt. In\nsilence he and Malone watched the burning Buick roll over and over\ninto the desert beyond the shoulder.\n\n\"My God,\" Boyd said. \"My ears!\"\n\nMalone understood at once. The blast from his own still-smoking .44\nhad roared past Boyd's head during the gun battle. No wonder the man's\nears hurt. It was a wonder he wasn't altogether deaf.\n\nBut Boyd shook off the pain and brought out his own .44 as he stepped\nout of the car. Malone followed him, his gun trained.\n\nFrom the rear, Her Majesty said: \"It's safe to rise now, isn't it?\"\n\n\"You ought to know,\" Malone said. \"You can tell if they're still\nalive.\"\n\nThere was silence while Queen Elizabeth frowned for a moment in\nconcentration. A look of pain crossed her face, and then, as her\nexpression smoothed again, she said: \"The traitors are dead. All\nexcept one, and he's--\" She paused. \"He's dying,\" she finished. \"He\ncan't hurt you.\"\n\nThere was no need for further battle. Malone reholstered his .44 and\nturned to Boyd. \"Tom, call the State Police,\" he said. \"Get 'em down\nhere fast.\"\n\nHe waited while Boyd climbed back under the wheel and began punching\nbuttons on the dashboard. Then Malone went toward the burning Buick.\n\nHe tried to drag the men out, but it wasn't any use. The first two, in\nthe front seat, had the kind of holes in them people talked about\nthrowing elephants through. Head and chest had been hit.\n\nMalone couldn't get close enough to the fiercely blazing automobile to\nmake even a try for the men in the back seat.\n\n                              * * * * *\n\nHe was sitting quietly on the edge of the rear seat when the Nevada\nHighway Patrol cars drove up next to them. Barbara Wilson had stopped\nscreaming, but she was still sobbing on Malone's shoulder. \"It's all\nright,\" he told her, feeling ineffectual.\n\n\"I never saw anybody killed before,\" she said.\n\n\"It's all right,\" Malone said. \"Nothing's going to hurt you. I'll\nprotect you.\"\n\nHe wondered if he meant it, and found, to his surprise, that he did.\nBarbara Wilson sniffled and looked up at him. \"Mr. Malone--\"\n\n\"Ken,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" she said. \"Ken--I'm so afraid. I saw the hole in one of\nthe men's heads, when you fired--it was--\"\n\n\"Don't think about it,\" Malone said. To him, the job had been an\nunpleasant occurrence, but a job, that was all. He could see, though,\nhow it might affect people who were new to it.\n\n\"You're so brave,\" she said.\n\nMalone tightened his arm around the girl's shoulder. \"Just depend on\nme,\" he said. \"You'll be all right if you--\"\n\nThe State Trooper walked up then, and looked at them. \"Mr. Malone?\" he\nsaid. He seemed to be taken slightly aback at the costuming.\n\n\"That's right,\" Malone said. He pulled out his ID card and the little\ngolden badge. The State Patrolman looked at them, and looked back at\nMalone.\n\n\"What's with the getup?\" he said.\n\n\"FBI,\" Malone said, hoping his voice carried conviction. \"Official\nbusiness.\"\n\n\"In costume?\"\n\n\"Never mind about the details,\" Malone snapped.\n\n\"He's an FBI agent, sir,\" Barbara said. \"And what are you?\" the\nPatrolman said. \"Lady Jane Grey?\"\n\n\"I'm a nurse,\" Barbara said. \"A psychiatric nurse.\"\n\n\"For nuts?\"\n\n\"For disturbed patients.\"\n\nThe Patrolman thought that over. \"Hell, you've got the identity cards\nand stuff,\" he said at last. \"Maybe you've got a reason to dress up.\nHow would I know? I'm only a State Patrolman.\"\n\n\"Let's cut the monologue,\" Malone said savagely, \"and get to\nbusiness.\"\n\nThe Patrolman stared. Then he said: \"All right, sir. Yes, sir. I'm\nLieutenant Adams, Mr. Malone. Suppose you tell me what happened?\"\n\nCarefully and concisely, Malone told him the story of the Buick that\nhad pulled up beside them, and what happened afterward.\n\nMeanwhile, the other cops had been looking over the wreck. When Malone\nhad finished his story, Lieutenant Adams flipped his notebook shut and\nlooked over toward them. \"I guess it's okay, sir,\" he said. \"As far as\nI'm concerned, it's justifiable homicide. Self-defense. Any reason why\nthey'd want to kill you?\"\n\nMalone thought about the Golden Palace. That might be a reason--but it\nmight not. And why burden an innocent State Patrolman with the facts\nof FBI life?\n\n\"Official,\" he said. \"Your chief will get the report.\"\n\nThe Patrolman nodded. \"I'll have to take a deposition tomorrow, but--\"\n\n\"I know,\" Malone said. \"Thanks. Can we go on to our hotel now?\"\n\n\"I guess,\" the Patrolman said. \"Go ahead. We'll take care of the rest\nof this. You'll be getting a call later.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" Malone said. \"Trace those hoods, and any connections they\nmight have had. Get the information to me as soon as possible.\"\n\nLieutenant Adams nodded. \"You won't have to leave the state, will\nyou?\" he asked. \"I don't mean that you _can't_, exactly--hell, you're\nFBI. But it'd be easier--\"\n\n\"Call Burris in Washington,\" Malone said. \"He can get hold of me--and\nif the Governor wants to know where we are, or the State's Attorney,\nput them in touch with Burris too. Okay?\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Lieutenant Adams said. \"Sure.\" He blinked at Malone. \"Listen,\"\nhe said. \"About those costumes--\"\n\n\"We're trying to catch Henry VIII for the murder of Anne Boleyn,\"\nMalone said with a polite smile. \"Okay?\"\n\n\"I was only asking,\" Lieutenant Adams said. \"Can't blame a man for\nasking, now, can you?\"\n\nMalone climbed into his front seat. \"Call me later,\" he said. The car\nstarted. \"Back to the hotel, Sir Thomas,\" Malone said, and the car\nroared off.\n\n\n                                  7\n\nYucca Flats, Malone thought, certainly deserved its name. It was about\nas flat as land could get, and it contained millions upon millions of\nuseless yuccas. Perhaps they were good for something, Malone thought,\nbut they weren't good for _him_.\n\nThe place might, of course, have been called Cactus Flats, but the\ncacti were neither as big nor as impressive as the yuccas.\n\nOr was that yucci?\n\nPossibly, Malone mused, it was simply yucks.\n\nAnd whatever it was, there were millions of it. Malone felt he\ncouldn't stand the sight of another yucca. He was grateful for only\none thing.\n\nIt wasn't summer. If the Elizabethans had been forced to drive in\nclosed cars through the Nevada desert in the summertime, they might\nhave started a cult of nudity, Malone felt. It was bad enough now, in\nwhat was supposed to be winter.\n\nThe sun was certainly bright enough, for one thing. It glared through\nthe cloudless sky and glanced with blinding force off the road. Sir\nThomas Boyd squinted at it through the rather incongruous sunglasses\nhe was wearing, while Malone wondered idly if it was the sunglasses,\nor the rest of the world, that was an anachronism. But Sir Thomas kept\nhis eyes grimly on the road as he gunned the powerful Lincoln toward\nthe Yucca Flats Labs at eighty miles an hour.\n\nMalone twisted himself around and faced the women in the back seat.\nPast them, through the rear window of the Lincoln, he could see the\nsecond car. It followed them gamely, carrying the newest addition to\nSir Kenneth Malone's Collection of Bats.\n\n\"Bats?\" Her Majesty said suddenly, but gently. \"Shame on you, Sir\nKenneth. These are poor, sick people. We must do our best to help\nthem--not to think up silly names for them. For shame!\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" Malone said wearily. He sighed and, for the fifth time\nthat day, he asked: \"Does Your Majesty have any idea where our spy is\nnow?\"\n\n\"Well, really, Sir Kenneth,\" the Queen said with the slightest of\nhesitations, \"it isn't easy, you know. Telepathy has certain laws,\njust like everything else. After all, even a game has laws. Being\ntelepathic didn't help me to play poker--I still had to learn the\nrules. And telepathy has rules, too. A telepath can easily confuse\nanother telepath by using some of those rules.\"\n\n\"Oh, fine,\" Malone said. \"Well, have you got into contact with his\nmind yet?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" Her Majesty said happily. \"And my goodness, he's certainly\ndigging up a lot of information, isn't he?\"\n\nMalone moaned softly. \"But who _is_ he?\" he asked after a second.\n\nThe Queen stared at the roof of the car in what looked like\nconcentration. \"He hasn't thought of his name yet,\" she said. \"I mean,\nat least, if he has, he hasn't mentioned it to me. Really, Sir\nKenneth, you have no idea how difficult all this is.\"\n\nMalone swallowed with difficulty.\n\n_\"Where_ is he, then,\" said. \"Can you tell me that, at least? His\nlocation?\"\n\nHer Majesty looked positively desolated with sadness. \"I can't be\nsure,\" she said. \"I really can't be exactly sure just where he is. He\ndoes keep moving around, I know that. But you have to remember that he\ndoesn't want me to find him. He certainly doesn't want to be found by\nthe FBI--would you?\"\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" Malone said, \"I _am_ the FBI.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" the Queen said, \"but suppose you weren't? He's doing his best\nto hide himself, even from me. It's sort of a game he's playing.\"\n\n\"A game!\"\n\nHer Majesty looked contrite. \"Believe me, Sir Kenneth, the minute I\nknow exactly where he is, I'll tell you. I promise. Cross my heart and\nhope to die--which I can't, of course, being immortal.\" Nevertheless,\nshe made an X-mark over her left breast. \"All right?\"\n\n\"All right,\" Malone said, out of sheer necessity. \"Okay. But don't\nwaste any time telling me. Do it right away. We've _got_ to find that\nspy and isolate him somehow.\"\n\n\"Please don't worry yourself, Sir Kenneth,\" Her Majesty said. \"Your\nQueen is doing everything she can.\"\n\n\"I know that, Your Majesty,\" Malone said. \"I'm sure of it.\" Privately,\nhe wondered just how much even she could do. Then he realized--for\nperhaps the ten-thousandth time--that there was no such thing as\nwondering privately any more.\n\n\"That's quite right, Sir Kenneth,\" the Queen said sweetly. \"And it's\nabout time you got used to it.\"\n\n\"What's going on?\" Boyd said. \"More reading minds back there?\"\n\n\"That's right, Sir Thomas,\" the Queen said.\n\n\"I've about gotten used to it,\" Boyd said almost cheerfully. \"Pretty\nsoon they'll come and take me away, but I don't mind at all.\" He\nwhipped the car around a bend in the road savagely. \"Pretty soon\nthey'll put me with the other sane people and let the bats inherit the\nworld. But I don't mind at all.\"\n\n\"Sir Thomas!\" Her Majesty said in shocked tones.\n\n\"Please,\" Boyd said with a deceptive calmness. \"Just Mr. Boyd. Not\neven Lieutenant Boyd, or Sergeant Boyd. Just Mr. Boyd. Or, if you\nprefer, Tom.\"\n\n\"Sir Thomas,\" Her Majesty said, \"I really can't understand this\nsudden--\"\n\n\"Then don't understand it,\" Boyd said. \"All I know is everybody's\nnuts, and I'm sick and tired of it.\"\n\nA pall of silence fell over the company.\n\n\"Look, Tom,\" Malone began at last.\n\n\"Don't you try smoothing me down,\" Boyd snapped.\n\nMalone's eyebrows rose. \"Okay,\" he said. \"I won't smooth you down.\nI'll just tell you to shut up, to keep driving--and to show some\nrespect to Her Majesty.\"\n\n\"I--\" Boyd stopped. There was a second of silence.\n\n_\"That's_ better,\" Her Majesty said with satisfaction.\n\nLady Barbara stretched in the back seat, next to Her Majesty. \"This is\ncertainly a long drive,\" she said. \"Have we got much farther to go?\"\n\n\"Not too far,\" Malone said. \"We ought to be there soon.\"\n\n\"I--I'm sorry for the way I acted,\" Barbara said.\n\n\"What do you mean, the way you acted?\"\n\n\"Crying like that,\" Barbara said with some hesitation. \"Making an--\nabsolute idiot of myself. When that other car--tried to get us.\"\n\n\"Don't worry about it,\" Malone said. \"It was nothing.\"\n\n\"I just--made trouble for you,\" Barbara said.\n\nHer Majesty touched the girl on the shoulder. \"He's not thinking about\nthe trouble you cause him,\" she said quietly.\n\n\"Of course I'm not,\" Malone told her. \"But I--\"\n\n\"My dear girl,\" Her Majesty said, \"I believe that Sir Kenneth is, at\nleast partly, in love with you.\"\n\nMalone blinked. It was perfectly true--even if he hadn't quite known\nit himself until now. Telepaths, he was discovering, were occasionally\nhandy things to have around.\n\n\"In... love....\" Barbara said.\n\n\"And you, my dear--\" Her Majesty began.\n\n\"Please, Your Majesty,\" Lady Barbara said. \"No more. Not just now.\"\n\nThe Queen smiled, almost to herself. \"Certainly, dear,\" she said.\n\nThe car sped on. In the distance, Malone could see the blot on the\ndesert that indicated the broad expanse of Yucca Flats Labs. Just the\nfact that it could be seen, he knew, didn't mean an awful lot. Malone\nhad been able to see it for the past fifteen minutes, and it didn't\nlook as if they'd gained an inch on it. Desert distances are\ndeceptive.\n\nAt long last, however, the main gate of the laboratories hove into\nview. Boyd made a left turn off the highway and drove a full seven\nmiles along the restricted road, right up to the big gate that marked\nthe entrance of the laboratories themselves. Once again, they were\nfaced with the army of suspicious guards and security officers.\n\nThis time, suspicion was somewhat heightened by the dress of the\nvisitors. Malone had to explain about six times that the costumes were\npart of an FBI arrangement, that he had not stolen his identity cards,\nthat Boyd's cards were Boyd's, too, and in general that the four of\nthem were not insane, not spies, and not jokesters out for a lark in\nthe sunshine.\n\nMalone had expected all of that. He went through the rigmarole\nwearily but without any sense of surprise. The one thing he hadn't\nbeen expecting was the man who was waiting for him on the other side\nof the gate.\n\nWhen he'd finished identifying everybody for the fifth or sixth time,\nhe began to climb back into the car. A familiar voice stopped him\ncold.\n\n\"Just a minute, Malone,\" Andrew J. Burris said. He erupted from the\nguardhouse like an avenging angel, followed closely by a thin man,\nabout five feet ten inches in height, with brush-cut brown hair, round\nhorn-rimmed spectacles, large hands and a small Sir Francis Drake\nbeard. Malone looked at the two figures blankly.\n\n\"Something wrong, Chief?\" he said.\n\nBurris came toward the car. The thin gentleman followed him, walking\nwith an odd bouncing step that must have been acquired, Malone\nthought, over years of treading on rubber eggs. \"I don't know,\" Burris\nsaid when he'd reached the door. \"When I was in Washington, I seemed\nto know--but when I get out here in this desert, everything just goes\nhaywire.\" He rubbed at his forehead.\n\nThen he looked into the car. \"Hello, Boyd,\" he said pleasantly.\n\n\"Hello, Chief,\" Boyd said.\n\nBurris blinked. \"Boyd, you look like Henry VIII,\" he said with only\nthe faintest trace of surprise.\n\n\"Doesn't he, though?\" Her Majesty said from the rear seat. \"I've\nnoticed that resemblance myself.\"\n\nBurris gave her a tiny smile. \"Oh,\" he said. \"Hello, Your Majesty.\nI'm--\"\n\n\"Andrew J. Burris, Director of the FBI,\" the Queen finished for him.\n\"Yes, I know. It's very nice to meet you at last. I've seen you on\ntelevision, and over the video phone. You photograph badly, you know.\"\n\n\"I do?\" Burris said pleasantly. It was obvious that he was keeping\nhimself under very tight control.\n\nMalone felt remotely sorry for the man--but only remotely. Burris\nmight as well know, he thought, what they had all been going through\nthe past several days.\n\nHer Majesty was saying something about the honorable estate of\nknighthood, and the Queen's list. Malone began paying attention when\nshe came to:\"--and I hereby dub thee--\" She stopped suddenly, turned\nand said: \"Sir Kenneth, give me your weapon.\"\n\nMalone hesitated for a long, long second. But Burris' eye was on him,\nand he could interpret the look without much trouble. There was only\none thing for him to do. He pulled out his .44, ejected the cartridges\nin his palm (and reminded himself to reload the gun as soon as he got\nit back), and handed the weapon to the Queen, butt foremost.\n\nShe took the butt of the revolver in her right hand, leaned out the\nwindow of the car, and said in a fine, distinct voice: \"Kneel,\nAndrew.\"\n\nMalone watched with wide, astonished eyes as Andrew J. Burris,\nDirector of the FBI, went to one knee in a low and solemn\ngenuflection. Queen Elizabeth Thompson nodded her satisfaction.\n\nShe tapped Burris gently on each shoulder with the muzzle of the gun.\n\"I knight thee Sir Andrew,\" she said. She cleared her throat. \"My,\nthis desert air is dry.... Rise, Sir Andrew, and know that you are\nhenceforth Knight Commander of the Queen's Own FBI.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Your Majesty,\" Burris said humbly.\n\nHe rose to his feet silently. The Queen withdrew into the car again\nand handed the gun back to Malone. He thumbed the cartridges into the\nchambers of the cylinder and listened dumbly.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" Burris said, \"this is Dr. Harry Gamble, the head of\nProject Isle. Dr. Gamble, this is Her Majesty the Queen; Lady Barbara\nWilson, her--uh--her lady-in-waiting; Sir Kenneth Malone; and King--I\nmean Sir Thomas Boyd.\" He gave the four a single bright impartial\nsmile. Then he tore his eyes away from the others, and bent his gaze\non Sir Kenneth Malone. \"Come over here a minute, Malone,\" he said,\njerking his thumb over his shoulder. \"I want to talk to you.\"\n\nMalone climbed out of the car and went around to meet Burris. He felt\njust a little worried as he followed the Director away from the car.\nTrue, he had sent Burris a long telegram the night before, in code.\nBut he hadn't expected the man to show up in Yucca Flats. There didn't\nseem to be any reason for it.\n\nAnd when there isn't any reason, Malone told himself sagely, it's a\nbad one.\n\n\"What's the trouble, Chief?\" he asked.\n\nBurris sighed. \"None so far,\" he said quietly. \"I got a report from\nthe Nevada State Patrol, and ran it through R&I. They identified the\nmen you killed, all right--but it didn't do us any good. They're hired\nhoods.\"\n\n\"Who hired them?\" Malone said.\n\nBurris shrugged. \"Somebody with money,\" he said. \"Hell, men like that\nwould kill their own grandmothers if the price were right--you know\nthat. We can't trace them back any farther.\"\n\nMalone nodded. That was, he had to admit, bad news. But then, when had\nhe last had any good news?\n\n\"We're nowhere near our telepathic spy,\" Burris said. \"We haven't come\nany closer than we were when we started. Have you got anything?\nAnything at all, no matter how small?\"\n\n\"Not that I know of, sir,\" Malone said.\n\n\"What about the little old lady--what's her name? Thompson. Anything\nfrom her?\"\n\nMalone hesitated. \"She has a close fix on the spy, sir,\" he said\nslowly, \"but she doesn't seem able to identify him right away.\"\n\n\"What else does she want?\" Burris said. \"We've made her Queen and\ngiven her a full retinue in costume; we've let her play roulette and\npoker with Government money. Does she want to hold a mass execution?\nIf she does, I can supply some Congressmen, Malone. I'm sure it could\nbe arranged.\" He looked at the agent narrowly. \"I might even be able\nto supply an FBI man or two,\" he added.\n\nMalone swallowed hard. \"I'm trying the best I can, sir,\" he said.\n\"What about the others?\"\n\nBurris looked even unhappier than usual. \"Come along,\" he said. \"I'll\nshow you.\"\n\nWhen they got back to the car, Dr. Gamble was talking spiritedly with\nHer Majesty about Roger Bacon. \"Before my time, of course,\" the Queen\nwas saying, \"but I'm sure he was a most interesting man. Now when dear\nold Marlowe wrote his _Faust_, he and I had several long discussions\nabout such matters. Alchemy, Doctor--\"\n\nBurris interrupted with: \"I beg your pardon, Your Majesty, but we must\nget on. Perhaps you'll be able to continue your--ah--audience later.\"\nHe turned to Boyd. \"Sir Thomas,\" he said with an effort, \"drive\ndirectly to the Westinghouse buildings. Over that way.\" He pointed.\n\"Dr. Gamble will ride with you, and the rest of us will follow in the\nsecond car. Let's move.\"\n\nHe stepped back as the project head got into the car, and watched it\nroar off. Then he and Malone went to the second car, another FBI\nLincoln. Two agents were sitting in the back seat, with a still figure\nbetween them.\n\nWith a shock, Malone recognized William Logan and the agents he'd\ndetailed to watch the telepath. Logan's face did not seem to have\nchanged expression since Malone had seen it last, and he wondered\nwildly if perhaps it had to be dusted once a week.\n\nHe got in behind the wheel and Burris slid in next to him.\n\n\"Westinghouse,\" Burris said. \"And let's get there in a hurry.\"\n\n\"Right,\" Malone said, and started the car.\n\n\"We just haven't had a single lead,\" Burris said. \"I was hoping you'd\ncome up with something. Your telegram detailed the fight, of course,\nand the rest of what's been happening--but I hoped there'd be\nsomething more.\"\n\n\"There isn't,\" Malone was forced to admit. \"All we can do is try to\npersuade Her Majesty to tell us--\"\n\n\"Oh, I know it isn't easy,\" Burris said. \"But it seems to me....\"\n\nBy the time they'd arrived at the administrative offices of\nWestinghouse's psionics research area, Malone found himself wishing\nthat something would happen. Possibly, he thought, lightning might\nstrike, or an earthquake swallow everything up. He was, suddenly,\nprofoundly tired of the entire affair.\n\n\n                                  8\n\nFour days later, he was more than tired. He was exhausted. The six\npsychopaths--including Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth I--had been housed\nin a converted dormitory in the Westinghouse area, together with four\nhighly nervous and even more highly trained and investigated\npsychiatrists from St. Elizabeths in Washington. The Convention of\nNuts, as Malone called it privately, was in full swing.\n\nAnd it was every bit as strange as he'd thought it was going to be.\nUnfortunately, five of the six (Her Majesty being the only exception)\nwere completely out of contact with the world. The psychiatrists\nreferred to them in worried tones as \"unavailable for therapy,\" and\nspent most of their time brooding over possible ways of bringing them\nback into the real world for a while, at least far enough so that they\ncould be spoken with.\n\nMalone stayed away from the five who were completely psychotic. The\nweird babblings of fifty-year-old Barry Miles disconcerted him. They\nsounded like little Charlie O'Neill's strange semi-connected jabber,\nbut Westinghouse's Dr. O'Connor said that it seemed to represent\nanother phenomenon entirely. William Logan's blank face was a memory\nof horror, but the constant tinkling giggles of Ardith Parker, the\nstudied and concentrated way that Gordon Macklin wove meaningless\npatterns in the air with his waving fingers, and the rhythmless,\nmelodyless humming that seemed to be all there was to the personality\nof Robert Cassiday were simply too much for Malone. Taken singly, each\nwas frightening and remote; all together, they wove a picture of\ninsanity that chilled him more than he wanted to admit.\n\nWhen the seventh telepath was flown in from Honolulu, Malone didn't\neven bother to see her. He let the psychiatrists take over directly,\nand simply avoided their sessions.\n\nQueen Elizabeth I, on the other hand, he found genuinely likeable.\n\nAccording to the psych boys, she had been (as both Malone and Her\nMajesty had theorized) heavily frustrated by being the possessor of a\ntalent which no one else recognized. Beyond that, the impact of other\nminds was disturbing; there was a slight loss of identity which seemed\nto be a major factor in every case of telepathic insanity. But the\nQueen had compensated for her frustrations in the easiest possible\nway; she had simply traded her identity for another one, and had\nrationalized a single, overruling delusion: that she was Queen\nElizabeth I of England, still alive and wrongfully deprived of her\nthrone.\n\n\"It's a beautiful rationalization,\" one of the psychiatrists said with\nmore than a trace of admiration in his voice. \"Complete and thoroughly\nconsistent. She's just traded identities--and everything else she\ndoes--_everything_ else--stems logically out of her delusional\npremise. Beautiful.\"\n\nShe may have been crazy, Malone realized. But she was a long way from\nstupid.\n\nThe project was in full swing. The only trouble was that they were no\nnearer finding the telepath than they had been three weeks before.\nWith five completely blank human beings to work with, and the sixth\nQueen Elizabeth (Malone heard privately that the last telepath, the\ngirl from Honolulu, was no better than the first five; she had\napparently regressed into what one of the psychiatrists called a \"non-\nidentity childhood syndrome.\" Malone didn't know what it meant, but it\nsounded terrible.)--with that crew, Malone could see why progress was\ntheir most difficult commodity.\n\nDr. Harry Gamble, the head of Project Isle, was losing poundage by the\nhour with worry. And, Malone reflected, he could ill afford it.\n\nBurris, Malone and Boyd had set themselves up in a temporary office\nwithin the Westinghouse area. The Director had left his assistant in\ncharge in Washington. Nothing, he said over and over again, was as\nimportant as the spy in Project Isle.\n\nApparently Boyd had come to believe that, too. At any rate, though he\nwas still truculent, there were no more outbursts of rebellion.\n\nBut, on the fourth day:\n\n\"What do we do now?\" Burris asked.\n\n\"Shoot ourselves,\" Boyd said promptly.\n\n\"Now, look here--\" Malone began, but he was overruled.\n\n\"Boyd,\" Burris said levelly, \"if I hear any more of that sort of\npessimism, you're going to be an exception to the beard rule. One more\ncrack out of you, and you can go out and buy yourself a razor.\"\n\nBoyd put his hand over his chin protectively, and said nothing at all.\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" Malone said. \"Aren't there any _sane_ telepaths in\nthe world?\"\n\n\"We can't find any,\" Burris said. \"We--\"\n\nThere was a knock at the office door. \"Who's there?\" Burris called.\n\"Dr. Gamble,\" said the man's surprisingly baritone voice.\n\nBurris called: \"Come in, Doctor,\" and the door opened. Dr. Gamble's\nlean face looked almost haggard.\n\n\"Mr. Burris,\" he said, extending his arms a trifle, \"can't anything be\ndone?\" Malone had seen Gamble speaking before, and had wondered if it\nwould be possible for the man to talk with his hands tied behind his\nback. Apparently it wouldn't be. \"We feel that we are approaching a\ncritical stage in Project Isle,\" the scientist said, enclosing one\nfist within the other hand. \"If anything more gets out to the Soviets,\nwe might as well publish our findings--\" a wide, outflung gesture of\nboth arms--\"in the newspapers.\"\n\nBurris stepped back. \"We're doing the best we can, Dr. Gamble,\" he\nsaid. All things considered, his obvious try at radiating confidence\nwas nearly successful. \"After all,\" he went on, \"we know a great deal\nmore than we did four days ago. Miss Thompson has assured us that the\nspy is right here, within the compound of Yucca Flats Labs. We've\nbottled everything up in this compound, and I'm confident that no\ninformation is at present getting through to the Soviet Government.\nMiss Thompson agrees with me.\"\n\n\"Miss Thompson?\" Gamble said, one hand at his bearded chin.\n\n\"The Queen,\" Burris said.\n\nGamble nodded and two fingers touched his forehead. \"Ah,\" he said. \"Of\ncourse.\" He rubbed at the back of his neck. \"But we can't keep\neverybody who's here now locked up forever. Sooner or later we'll have\nto let them--\" His left hand described the gesture of a man tossing\naway a wad of paper--\"go.\" His hands fell to his sides. \"We're lost,\nunless we can find that spy.\"\n\n\"We'll find him,\" Burris said with a show of great confidence.\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Give her time,\" Burris said. \"Give her time. Remember her mental\ncondition.\"\n\nBoyd looked up. \"Rome,\" he said in an absent fashion, \"wasn't built in\na daze.\"\n\nBurris glared at him, but said nothing. Malone filled the\nconversational hole with what he thought would be nice, and hopeful,\nand untrue.\n\n\"We know he's someone on the reservation, so we'll catch him\neventually,\" he said. \"And as long as his information isn't getting\ninto Soviet hands, we're safe.\" He glanced at his wristwatch.\n\nDr. Gamble said: \"But--\"\n\n\"My, my,\" Malone said. \"Almost lunchtime. I have to go over and have\nlunch with Her Majesty. Maybe she's dug up something more.\"\n\n\"I hope so,\" Dr. Gamble said, apparently successfully deflected. \"I do\nhope so.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"pardon me.\" He shucked off his coat and\ntrousers. Then he proceeded to put on the doublet and hose that hung\nin the little office closet. He shrugged into the fur-trimmed, slash-\nsleeved coat, adjusted the plumed hat to his satisfaction with great\ncare, and gave Burris and the others a small bow. \"I go to an audience\nwith Her Majesty, gentlemen,\" he said in a grave, well-modulated\nvoice. \"I shall return anon.\"\n\nHe went out the door and closed it carefully behind him. When he had\ngone a few steps he allowed himself the luxury of a deep sigh.\n\nThen he went outside and across the dusty street to the barracks where\nHer Majesty and the other telepaths were housed. No one paid any\nattention to him, and he rather missed the stares he'd become used to\ndrawing. But by now, everybody was used to seeing Elizabethan\nclothing. Her Majesty had arrived at a new plateau.\n\nShe would now allow no one to have audience with her unless he was\nproperly dressed. Even the psychiatrists--whom she had, with a careful\nsense of meiosis, appointed Physicians to the Royal House--had to wear\nthe stuff.\n\nMalone went over the whole case in his mind--for about the thousandth\ntime, he told himself bitterly.\n\nWho could the telepathic spy be? It was like looking for a needle in a\nrolling stone, he thought. Or something. He did remember clearly that\na stitch in time saved nine, but he didn't know nine what, and\nsuspected it had nothing to do with his present problem.\n\nHow about Dr. Harry Gamble, Malone thought. It seemed a little\nunlikely that the head of Project Isle would be spying on his own\nmen--particularly since he already had all the information. But, on\nthe other hand, he was just as probable a spy as anybody else.\n\nMalone moved onward. Dr. Thomas O'Connor, the Westinghouse psionics\nman, was the next nominee. Before Malone had actually found Her\nMajesty, he had had a suspicion that O'Connor had cooked the whole\nthing up to throw the FBI off the trail and confuse everybody, and\nthat he'd intended merely to have the FBI chase ghosts while the real\nspy did his work undetected.\n\nBut what if O'Connor were the spy himself--a telepath? What if he were\nso confident of his ability to throw the Queen off the track that he\nhad allowed the FBI to find all the other telepaths? There was another\nargument for that: he'd had to report the findings of his machine no\nmatter what it cost him; there were too many other men on his staff\nwho knew about it.\n\nO'Connor was a perfectly plausible spy, too. But he didn't seem very\nlikely. The head of a government project is likely to be a much-\ninvestigated man. Could any tie-up with Russia--even a psionic one--\nstand up against that kind of investigation? It was possible.\nAnything, after all, was possible. You eliminated the impossible, and\nthen whatever remained, however improbable....\n\nMalone told himself morosely to shut up and think.\n\nO'Connor, he told himself, might be the spy. It would be a pleasure,\nhe realized, to go to the office of that superior scientist and arrest\nhim. \"I know your true name,\" he muttered. \"It isn't O'Connor, it's\nMoriarty.\" He wondered if the Westinghouse man had ever done any work\non the dynamics of an asteroid. Then he wondered what the dynamics of\nan asteroid were.\n\nBut if O'Connor were the spy, nothing made sense. Why would he have\ndisclosed the fact that people were having their minds read in the\nfirst place?\n\nSadly, Malone gave up the idea. But, then, there were other ideas. The\nother psychiatrists, for instance....\n\nThe only trouble with them, Malone realized, was that there seemed to\nbe neither motive nor anything else to connect them to the case. There\nwas no evidence, none in any direction.\n\nWhy, there was just as much evidence that the spy was really Kenneth\nJ. Malone, he told himself.\n\nAnd then he stopped.\n\nMaybe Tom Boyd had been thinking that way about him. Maybe Boyd\nsuspected that he, Malone, was really the spy.\n\nCertainly it worked in reverse. Boyd...\n\nNo, Malone told himself firmly. That was silly.\n\nIf he were going to consider Boyd, he realized, he might as well go\nwhole hog and think about Andrew J. Burris.\n\nAnd that really _was_ ridiculous. Absolutely ridic....\n\nWell, Queen Elizabeth had seemed pretty certain when she'd pointed him\nout in Dr. Dowson's office. And the fact that she'd apparently changed\nher mind didn't have to mean very much. After all, how much faith\ncould you place in Her Majesty at the best of times? If she'd made a\nmistake about Burris in the first place, she could just as well have\nmade a mistake in the second place. Or about the spy's being at Yucca\nFlats at all.\n\nIn which case, Malone thought sadly, they were right back where they'd\nstarted from.\n\nBehind their own goal line.\n\nOne way or another, though, Her Majesty had made a mistake. She'd\npointed Burris out as the spy, and then she'd said she'd been wrong.\nEither Burris was a spy, or else he wasn't. You couldn't have it both\nways.\n\nAnd if Burris really were the spy, Malone thought, then why had he\nstarted the investigation in the first place? You came back to the\nsame question with Burris, he realized, that you had with Dr.\nO'Connor: it didn't make sense for a man to play one hand against the\nother. Maybe the right hand sometimes didn't know what the left hand\nwas doing, but this was ridiculous.\n\nSo Burris wasn't the spy. And Her Majesty had made a mistake when\nshe'd said....\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" Malone told himself suddenly.\n\nHad she?\n\nMaybe, after all, you _could_ have it both ways. The thought occurred\nto him with a startling suddenness and he stood silent upon a peak in\nYucca Flats, contemplating it. A second went by.\n\nAnd then something Burris himself had said came back to him, something\nthat--\n\n\"I'll be damned,\" he muttered.\n\nHe came to a dead stop in the middle of the street. In one sudden\nflash of insight, all the pieces of the case he'd been looking at for\nso long fell together and formed one consistent picture. The pattern\nwas complete.\n\nMalone blinked.\n\nIn that second, he knew exactly who the spy was.\n\nA jeep honked raucously and swerved around him. The driver leaned out\nto curse and Malone waved at him, dimly recognizing a private eye he\nhad once known, a middle-aged man named Archer. Wondering vaguely what\nArcher was doing this far East, and in a jeep at that, Malone watched\nthe vehicle disappear down the street. There were more cars coming,\nbut what difference did that make? Malone didn't care about cars.\nAfter all, he had the answer, the whole answer....\n\n\"I'll be damned,\" he said again, abruptly, and wheeled around to head\nback to the offices.\n\nOn the way, he stopped in at another small office, this one inhabited\nby the two FBI men from Las Vegas. He gave a series of quick orders,\nand got the satisfaction, as he left, of seeing one of the FBI men\ngrabbing for a phone in a hurry.\n\nIt was good to be _doing_ things again, important things.\n\nBurris, Boyd and Dr. Gamble were still talking as Malone entered.\n\n\"That,\" Burris said, \"was one hell of a quick lunch. What's Her\nMajesty doing now--running a diner?\"\n\nMalone ignored the bait, and drew himself to his full height.\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said solemnly, \"Her Majesty has asked that all of us\nattend her in audience. She has information of the utmost gravity to\nimpart, and wishes this audience at once.\"\n\nDr. Gamble made a puzzled, circular gesture with one hand. \"What's the\nmatter?\" he asked. \"Is something--\"\n\nThe hand dropped--\"wrong?\"\n\nBurris barely glanced at him. A startled expression came over his\nfeatures. \"Has she--\" he began, and stopped, leaving his mouth open\nand the rest of the sentence unfinished.\n\nMalone nodded gravely and drew in a breath. Elizabethan periods were\nhard on the lungs, he had begun to realize: you needed a lot of air\nbefore you embarked on a sentence. \"I believe, gentlemen,\" he said,\n\"that Her Majesty is about to reveal the identity of the spy who has\nbeen battening on Project Isle.\"\n\nThe silence lasted no more than three seconds. Dr. Gamble didn't even\nmake a gesture during that time. Then Burris spoke.\n\n\"Let's go,\" he snapped. He wheeled and headed for the door. The others\npromptly followed.\n\n\"Gentlemen!\" Malone said, sounding, as far as he could tell, properly\nshocked and offended. \"Your dress!\"\n\n\"What?\" Dr. Gamble said, throwing up both hands.\n\n\"Oh, _no_,\" Boyd chimed in. \"Not now.\"\n\nBurris simply said: \"You're quite right. Get dressed, Boyd--I mean, of\ncourse, Sir Thomas.\"\n\nWhile they were dressing, Malone put in a call to Dr. O'Connor's\noffice. The scientist was as frosty as ever.\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Malone?\" The sound of that voice, Malone reflected, was\nenough to give anybody double revolving pneumonia with knobs on.\n\n\"Dr. O'Connor,\" he said, \"Her Majesty wants you in her court in ten\nminutes--and in full court dress.\"\n\nO'Connor merely sighed, like Boreas. \"What is this,\" he asked, \"more\ntomfoolery?\"\n\n\"I really couldn't say,\" Malone told him coyly. \"But I'd advise you to\nbe there. It might interest you.\"\n\n\"Interest me?\" O'Connor stormed. \"I've got work to do here--important\nwork. You simply do not realize, Mr. Malone--\"\n\n\"Whatever I realize,\" Malone cut in, feeling brave, \"I'm passing on\norders from Her Majesty.\"\n\n\"That insane woman,\" O'Connor stated flatly, \"is not going to order me\nabout. Good Lord, do you know what you're saying?\"\n\nMalone nodded. \"I certainly do,\" he said cheerfully. \"If you'd rather,\nI can have the orders backed up by the United States Government. But\nthat won't be necessary, will it?\"\n\n\"The United States Government,\" O'Connor said, thawing perceptibly\nabout the edges, \"ought to allow a man to do his proper work, and not\nforce him to go chasing off after the latest whims of some insane old\nlady.\"\n\n\"You will be there, now, won't you?\" Malone asked. His own voice\nreminded him of something, and in a second he had it: the cooing,\ngentle persuasion of Dr. Andrew Blake of Rice Pavilion, who had locked\nMalone in a padded cell. It was the voice of a man talking to a mental\ncase.\n\nIt sounded remarkably apt. Dr. O'Connor went slightly purple, but\ncontrolled himself magnificently. \"I'll be there,\" he said.\n\n\"Good,\" Malone told him, and snapped the phone off.\n\nThen he put in a second call to the psychiatrists from St. Elizabeths\nand told them the same thing. More used to the strange demands of\nneurotic and psychotic patients, they were readier to comply.\n\nEveryone, Malone realized with satisfaction, was now assembling.\nBurris and the others were ready to go, sparklingly dressed and\nlooking impatient. Malone put down the phone and took one great breath\nof relief.\n\nThen, beaming, he led the others out.\n\n                              * * * * *\n\nTen minutes later, there were nine men in Elizabethan costume standing\noutside the room which had been designated as the Queen's Court. Dr.\nGamble's costume did not quite fit him; his sleeve-ruffs were half way\nup to his elbows and his doublet had an unfortunate tendency to creep.\nThe St. Elizabeths men, all four of them, looked just a little like\nmoth-eaten versions of old silent pictures. Malone looked them over\nwith a somewhat sardonic eye. Not only did he have the answer to the\nwhole problem that had been plaguing them, but _his_ costume was a\nstunning, perfect fit.\n\n\"Now, I want you men to let me handle this,\" Malone said. \"I know just\nwhat I want to say, and I think I can get the information without too\nmuch trouble.\"\n\nOne of the psychiatrists spoke up. \"I trust you won't disturb the\npatient, Mr. Malone,\" he said.\n\n\"Sir Kenneth,\" Malone snapped.\n\nThe psychiatrist looked both abashed and worried. \"I'm sorry,\" he said\ndoubtfully.\n\nMalone nodded. \"That's all right,\" he said. \"I'll try not to disturb\nHer Majesty unduly.\"\n\nThe psychiatrists conferred. When they came out of the huddle one of\nthem--Malone was never able to tell them apart--said: \"Very well,\nwe'll let you handle it. But we will be forced to interfere if we feel\nyou're--ah--going too far.\"\n\nMalone said: \"That's fair enough, gentlemen. Let's go.\"\n\nHe opened the door.\n\nIt was a magnificent room. The whole place had been done over in\nplastic and synthetic fibers to look like something out of the\nSixteenth Century. It was as garish, and as perfect, as a Hollywood\nmovie set--which wasn't surprising, since two stage designers had been\nhired away from color-TV spectaculars to set it up. At the far end of\nthe room, past the rich hangings and the flaming chandeliers, was a\ngreat throne, and on it Her Majesty was seated. Lady Barbara reclined\non the steps at her feet.\n\nMalone saw the expression on Her Majesty's face. He wanted to talk to\nBarbara--but there wasn't time. Later, there might be. Now, he\ncollected his mind and drove one thought at the Queen, one single\npowerful thought:\n\n_Read me! You know by this time that I have the truth_--_but read\ndeeper!_\n\nThe expression on her face changed suddenly. She was smiling a sad,\ngentle little smile. Lady Barbara, who had looked up at the approach\nof Sir Kenneth and his entourage, relaxed again, but her eyes remained\non Malone. \"You may approach, my lords,\" said the Queen.\n\nSir Kenneth led the procession, with Sir Thomas and Sir Andrew close\nbehind him. O'Connor and Gamble came next, and bringing up the rear\nwere the four psychiatrists. They strode slowly along the red carpet\nthat stretched from the door to the foot of the throne. They came to a\nhalt a few feet from the steps leading up to the throne, and bowed in\nunison.\n\n\"You may explain, Sir Kenneth,\" Her Majesty said.\n\n\"Your Majesty understands the conditions?\" Malone asked.\n\n\"Perfectly,\" said the Queen. \"Proceed.\"\n\nNow the expression on Barbara's face changed, to wonder and a kind of\nfright. Malone didn't look at her. Instead, he turned to Dr. O'Connor.\n\n\"Dr. O'Connor, what are your plans for the telepaths who have been\nbrought here?\" He shot the question out quickly, and O'Connor was\ncaught off-balance.\n\n\"Well--ah--we would like their cooperation in further research which\nwe--ah--plan to do into the actual mechanisms of telepathy. Provided,\nof course--\" He coughed gently--\"provided that they become--ah--\naccessible. Miss--I mean, of course, Her Majesty has already been a\ngreat deal of help.\" He gave Malone an odd look. It seemed to say:\n_What's coming next?_\n\nMalone simply gave him a nod, and a \"Thank you, Doctor,\" and turned to\nBurris. He could feel Barbara's eyes on him, but he went on with his\nprepared questions. \"Chief,\" he said, \"what about you? After we nail\nour spy, what happens--to Her Majesty, I mean? You don't intend to\nstop giving her the homage due her, do you?\"\n\nBurris stared, openmouthed. After a second he managed to say: \"Why,\nno, of course not, Sir Kenneth. That is--\" and he glanced over at the\npsychiatrists--\"if the doctors think....\"\n\nThere was another hurried consultation. The four psychiatrists came\nout of it with a somewhat shaky statement to the effect that\ntreatments which had been proven to have some therapeutic value ought\nnot to be discontinued, although of course there was always the chance\nthat....\n\n\"Thank you, gentlemen,\" Malone said smoothly. He could see that they\nwere nervous, and no wonder; he could imagine how difficult it was for\na psychiatrist to talk about a patient in her presence. But they'd\nalready realized that it didn't make any difference; their thoughts\nwere an open book, anyway.\n\nLady Barbara said: \"Sir--I mean Ken--are you going to--\"\n\n\"What's this all about?\" Burris snapped.\n\n\"Just a minute, Sir Andrew,\" Malone said. \"I'd like to ask one of the\ndoctors here--or all of them, for that matter--one more question.\" He\nwhirled and faced them. \"I'm assuming that not one of these persons is\nlegally responsible for his or her actions. Is that correct?\"\n\nAnother hurried huddle. The psych boys were beginning to remind Malone\nof a semi-pro football team in rather unusual uniforms.\n\nFinally one of them said: \"You are correct. According to the latest\nstatutes, all of these persons are legally insane--including Her\nMajesty.\" He paused and gulped. \"I except the FBI, of course--and\nourselves.\" Another pause. \"And Dr. O'Connor and Dr. Gamble.\"\n\n\"And,\" said Lady Barbara, \"me.\" She smiled sweetly at them all.\n\n\"Ah,\" the psychiatrist said. \"Certainly. Of course.\" He retired into\nhis group with some confusion.\n\nMalone was looking straight at the throne. Her Majesty's countenance\nwas serene and unruffled.\n\nBarbara said suddenly: \"You don't mean--but she--\" and closed her\nmouth. Malone shot her one quick look, and then turned to the Queen.\n\n\"Well, Your Majesty?\" he said. \"You have seen the thoughts of every\nman here. How do they appear to you?\"\n\nHer voice contained both tension and relief. \"They are all good men,\nbasically--and kind men,\" she said. \"And they believe us. That's the\nimportant thing, you know. Their belief in us.... Just as you said\nthat first day we met. We've needed belief for so long ... for so\nlong....\" Her voice trailed off; it seemed to become lost in a\nconstellation of thoughts. Barbara had turned to look up at Her\nMajesty.\n\nMalone took a step forward, but Burris interrupted him. \"How about the\nspy?\" he said.\n\nThen his eyes widened. Boyd, standing next to him, leaned suddenly\nforward. \"That's why you mentioned all that about legal immunity\nbecause of insanity,\" he whispered. \"Because--\"\n\n\"No,\" Barbara said. \"No. She couldn't--she's not--\"\n\nThey were all looking at Her Majesty, now. She returned them stare for\nstare, her back stiff and straight and her white hair enhaloed in the\nroom's light. \"Sir Kenneth,\" she said--and her voice was only the\nleast bit unsteady--\"they all think _I'm_ the spy.\"\n\nBarbara stood up. \"Listen,\" she said. \"I didn't like Her Majesty at\nfirst--well, she was a patient, and that was all, and when she started\nputting on airs ... but since I've gotten to know her I do like her.\nI like her because she's good and kind herself, and because--because\nshe wouldn't be a spy. She couldn't be. No matter what any of you\nthink--even you--Sir Kenneth!\"\n\nThere was a second of silence.\n\n\"Of course she's not,\" Malone said quietly. \"She's no spy.\"\n\n\"Would I spy on my own subjects?\" she said. \"Use your reason!\"\n\n\"You mean--\" Burris began, and Boyd finished for him:\n\n\"--she isn't?\"\n\n\"No,\" Malone snapped. \"She isn't. Remember, you said it would take a\ntelepath to catch a telepath?\"\n\n\"Well--\" Burris began.\n\n\"Well, Her Majesty remembered it,\" Malone said. \"And acted on it.\"\n\nBarbara remained standing. She went to the Queen and put an arm around\nthe little old lady's shoulder. Her Majesty did not object. \"I knew,\"\nshe said. \"You couldn't have been a spy.\"\n\n\"Listen, dear,\" the Queen said. \"Your Kenneth has seen the truth of\nthe matter. Listen to him.\"\n\n\"Her Majesty not only caught the spy,\" Malone said, \"but she turned\nthe spy right over to us.\"\n\nHe turned at once and went back down the long red carpet to the door.\n_I really ought to get a sword_, he thought, and didn't see Her\nMajesty smile. He opened the door with a great flourish and said\nquietly: \"Bring him in, boys.\"\n\nThe FBI men from Las Vegas marched in. Between them was their\nprisoner, a boy with a vacuous face, clad in a straitjacket that\nseemed to make no difference at all to him. His mind was--somewhere\nelse. But his body was trapped between the FBI agents: the body of\nWilliam Logan.\n\n\"Impossible,\" one of the psychiatrists said.\n\nMalone spun on his heel and led the way back to the throne. Logan and\nhis guards followed closely.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" Malone said. \"May I present the prisoner?\"\n\n\"Perfectly correct, Sir Kenneth,\" the Queen said. \"Poor Willie is your\nspy. You won't be too hard on him, will you?\"\n\n\"I don't think so, Your Majesty,\" Malone said. \"After all--\"\n\n\"Now wait a minute,\" Burris exploded. \"How the hell did _you_ know any\nof this?\"\n\nMalone bowed to Her Majesty, and winked at Barbara. He turned to\nBurris. \"Well,\" he said, \"I had one piece of information none of the\nrest of you had. When we were in the Desert Edge Sanatorium, Dr.\nDowson called you on the phone. Remember?\"\n\n\"Sure I remember,\" Burris said. \"So?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"Her Majesty said she knew just where the spy\nwas. I asked her where--\"\n\n\"Why didn't you tell me?\" Burris screamed. \"You knew all this time and\nyou didn't tell me?\"\n\n\"Hold on,\" Malone said. \"I asked her where--and she said: 'He's right\nthere.' And she was pointing right at your image on the screen.\"\n\nBurris opened his mouth. Nothing came out. He closed it and tried\nagain. At last he managed one word.\n\n\"Me?\" he said.\n\n\"You,\" Malone said. \"But that's what I realized later. She wasn't\npointing at you. She was pointing at Logan, who was in the next room.\"\n\nBarbara whispered: \"Is that right, Your Majesty?\"\n\n\"Certainly, dear,\" the Queen said calmly. \"Would I lie to Sir\nKenneth?\"\n\nMalone was still talking. \"The thing that set me off this noon was\nsomething you said, Sir Andrew,\" he went on. \"You said there weren't\nany sane telepaths--remember?\"\n\nBurris, incapable of speech, merely nodded.\n\n\"But according to Her Majesty,\" Malone said, \"we had every telepath in\nthe United States right here. She told me that--and I didn't even see\nit!\"\n\n\"Don't blame yourself, Sir Kenneth,\" the Queen put in. \"I did do my\nbest to mislead you, you know.\"\n\n\"You sure did!\" Malone said. \"And later on, when we were driving here,\nshe said the spy was 'moving around.' That's right; he was in the car\nbehind us, going eighty miles an hour.\"\n\nBarbara stared. Malone got a lot of satisfaction out of that stare.\nBut there was still more ground to cover.\n\n\"Then,\" he said, \"she told us he was here at Yucca Flats--after we\nbrought him here! It had to be one of the other six telepaths.\"\n\nThe psychiatrist who'd muttered: \"Impossible,\" was still muttering it.\nMalone ignored him.\n\n\"And when I remembered her pointing at you,\" Malone told Burris, \"and\nremembered that she'd only said: 'He's right there,' I knew it had to\nbe Logan. You weren't there. You were only an image on a TV screen.\nLogan was there--in the room behind the phone.\"\n\nBurris had found his tongue. \"All right,\" he said. \"Okay. But what's\nall this about misleading us--and why didn't she tell us right away,\nanyhow?\"\n\nMalone turned to Her Majesty on the throne. \"I think that the Queen\nhad better explain that--if she will.\"\n\nQueen Elizabeth Thompson nodded very slowly. \"I--I only wanted you to\nrespect me,\" she said. \"To treat me properly.\" Her voice sounded\nuneven, and her eyes were glistening with unspilled tears. Lady\nBarbara tightened her arm about the Queen's shoulders once more.\n\n\"It's all right,\" she said. \"We do--respect you.\"\n\nThe Queen smiled up at her.\n\nMalone waited. After a second Her Majesty continued.\n\n\"I was afraid that as soon as you found poor Willie you'd send me back\nto the hospital,\" she said. \"And Willie couldn't tell the Russian\nagents any more once he'd been taken away. So I thought I'd just--just\nlet things stay the way they were as long as I could. That's--that's\nall.\"\n\nMalone nodded. After a second he said: \"You see that we couldn't\npossibly send you back now, don't you?\"\n\n\"You know all the State Secrets, Your Majesty,\" Malone said. \"We would\nrather that Dr. Harman in San Francisco didn't try to talk you out of\nthem. Or anyone else.\"\n\nThe Queen smiled tremulously. \"I know too much, do I?\" she said. Then\nher grin faded. \"Poor Dr. Harman,\" she said.\n\n\"Poor Dr. Harman?\"\n\n\"You'll hear about him in a day or so,\" she said. \"I--peeked inside\nhis mind. He's very ill.\"\n\n\"Ill?\" Lady Barbara asked.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" the Queen said. The trace of a smile appeared on her face.\n\"He thinks that all the patients in the hospital can see inside his\nmind.\"\n\n\"Oh, my,\" Lady Barbara said--and began to laugh. It was the nicest\nsound Malone had ever heard.\n\n\"Forget Harman,\" Burris snapped. \"What about this spy ring? How was\nLogan getting his information out?\"\n\n\"I've already taken care of that,\" Malone said. \"I had Desert Edge\nSanatorium surrounded as soon as I knew what the score was.\" He looked\nat one of the agents holding Logan.\n\n\"They ought to be in the Las Vegas jail within half an hour,\" he said\nin confirmation.\n\n\"Dr. Dowson was in on it, wasn't he, Your Majesty?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Certainly,\" the Queen said. Her eyes were suddenly very cold. \"I hope\nhe tries to escape. I hope he tries it.\"\n\nMalone knew just how she felt.\n\nOne of the psychiatrists spoke up suddenly. \"I don't understand it,\"\nhe said. \"Logan is completely catatonic. Even if he could read minds,\nhow could he tell Dowson what he'd read? It doesn't make sense.\"\n\n\"In the first place,\" the Queen said patiently, \"Willie isn't\ncatatonic. He's just _busy_, that's all. He's only a boy, and--well,\nhe doesn't much like being who he is. So he visits other people's\nminds, and that way he becomes _them_ for a while. You see?\"\n\n\"Vaguely,\" Malone said. \"But how did Dowson get his information? I had\neverything worked out but that.\"\n\n\"I know you did,\" the Queen said, \"and I'm proud of you. I intend to\naward you with the Order of the Bath for this day's work.\"\n\nUnaccountably, Malone's chest swelled with pride.\n\n\"As for Dr. Dowson,\" the Queen said, \"that traitor--_hurt_ Willie. If\nhe's hurt enough, he'll come back.\" Her eyes weren't hard any more.\n\"He didn't want to be a spy, really,\" she said, \"but he's just a boy,\nand it must have sounded rather exciting. He knew that if he told\nDowson everything he'd found out, they'd let him go--go away again.\"\n\nThere was a long silence.\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"that about wraps it up. Any questions?\"\n\nHe looked around at the men, but before any of them could speak up Her\nMajesty rose.\n\n\"I'm sure there are questions,\" she said, \"but I'm really very tired.\nMy lords, you are excused.\" She extended a hand. \"Come, Lady Barbara,\"\nshe said. \"I think I really may need that nap, now.\"\n\n                              * * * * *\n\nMalone put the cufflinks in his shirt with great care. They were great\nstones, and Malone thought that they gave his costume that necessary\nElizabethan flair.\n\nNot that he was wearing the costumes of the Queen's Court now.\nInstead, he was dressed in a tailor-proud suit of dark blue, a white-\non-white shirt and no tie. He selected one of a gorgeous peacock\npattern from his closet rack.\n\nBoyd yawned at him from the bed in the room they were sharing.\n\"Stepping out?\" he said.\n\n\"I am,\" Malone said with restraint. He whipped the tie round his neck\nand drew it under the collar.\n\n\"Anybody I know?\"\n\n\"I am meeting Lady Barbara, if you wish to know,\" Malone said.\n\n\"My God,\" Boyd said. \"Come down. Relax. Anyhow, I've got a question\nfor you. There was one little thing Her Everlovin' Majesty didn't\nexplain.\"\n\n\"Yes?\" said Malone.\n\n\"Well, about those hoods who tried to gun us down,\" Boyd said. \"Who\nhired 'em? And why?\"\n\n\"Dowson,\" Malone said. \"He wanted to kill us off, and then kidnap\nLogan from the hotel room. But we foiled his plan--by killing his\nhoods. By the time he could work up something else, we were on our way\nto Yucca Flats.\"\n\n\"Great,\" Boyd said. \"And how did you find out this startling piece of\ninformation? There haven't been any reports in from Las Vegas, have\nthere?\"\n\n\"No,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Okay,\" Boyd said. \"I give up, Mastermind.\"\n\nMalone wished Boyd would stop using that nickname. The fact was--as\nhe, and apparently nobody else, was willing to recognize--that he\nwasn't anything like a really terrific FBI agent. Even Barbara thought\nhe was something special.\n\nHe wasn't, he knew. He was just lucky.\n\n\"Her Majesty informed me,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Her--\" Boyd stood with his mouth dropped open, like a fish waiting\nfor some bait. \"You mean she knew?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"she did know the guys in the Buick weren't the\nbest in the business--and she knew all about the specially-built FBI\nLincoln. She got that from our minds.\" He knotted his tie with an air\nof great aplomb, and went slowly to the door. \"And she knew we were a\ngood team. She got that from our minds, too.\"\n\n\"But,\" Boyd said. After a second he said: \"But,\" again, and followed\nit with: \"Why didn't she tell us?\"\n\nMalone opened the door.\n\n\"Her Majesty wished to see the Queen's Own FBI in action,\" said Sir\nKenneth Malone.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Brain Twister, by\nGordon Randall Garrett and Laurence Mark Janifer\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK BRAIN TWISTER ***\n\n***** This file should be named 22332-8.txt or 22332-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/2/3/3/22332/\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
