Outwardly he was unperturbed. He handed the binoculars back\nto Rudolph's man Almon, of the eighty-ninth level, Maintainer, with a\nsmile.\n\n\"They aren't very good,\" he said.\n\nAlmon put them to his own eyes, glanced over the parapet and swore\nmildly. \"Blacker than the heart of a crazy Angel, eh? Never mind;\nhere's another pair.\"\n\nThis pair was unremarkable. Through it, Reuben studied the thousand\nsetbacks and penthouses, of Denv that ranged themselves below. He was\ntoo worried to enjoy his first sight of the vista from the eighty-ninth\nlevel, but he let out a murmur of appreciation. Now to get away from\nthis suddenly sinister fellow and try to puzzle it out.\n\n\"Could we--?\" he asked cryptically, with a little upward jerk of his\nchin.\n\n\"It's better not to,\" Almon said hastily, taking the glasses from his\nhands. \"What if somebody with stars happened to see, you know? How'd\n_you_ like it if you saw some impudent fellow peering up at you?\"\n\n\"He wouldn't dare!\" said Reuben, pretending to be stupid and indignant,\nand joined a moment later in Almon's sympathetic laughter.\n\n\"Never mind,\" said Almon. \"We are young. Some day, who knows? Perhaps\nwe shall look from the ninety-fifth level, or the hundredth.\"\n\nThough Reuben knew that the Maintainer was no friend of his, the\ngenerous words sent blood hammering through his veins; ambition for a\nmoment.\n\nHe pulled a long face and told Almon: \"Let us hope so. Thank you for\nbeing my host. Now I must return to my quarters.\"\n\nHe left the windy parapet for the serene luxury of an\neighty-ninth-level corridor and descended slow moving stairs through\ngradually less luxurious levels to his own Spartan floor. Selene was\nwaiting, smiling, as he stepped off the stairs.\n\nShe was decked out nicely--too nicely. She wore a steely hued corselet\nand a touch of scent; her hair was dressed long. The combination\nappealed to him, and instantly he was on his guard. Why had she gone to\nthe trouble of learning his tastes? What was she up to? After all, she\nwas Griffin's woman.\n\n\"Coming _down_?\" she asked, awed. \"Where have you been?\"\n\n\"The eighty-ninth, as a guest of that fellow Almon. The vista is\nimmense.\"\n\n\"I've never been....\" she murmured, and then said decisively: \"You\nbelong up there. And higher. Griffin laughs at me, but he's a fool.\nLast night in chamber we got to talking about you, I don't know how,\nand he finally became quite angry and said he didn't want to hear\nanother word.\" She smiled wickedly. \"I was revenged, though.\"\n\nBlank-faced, he said: \"You must be a good hand at revenge, Selene, and\nat stirring up the need for it.\"\n\nThe slight hardening of her smile meant that he had scored and he\nhurried by with a rather formal salutation.\n\nBurn him for an Angelo, but she was easy enough to take! The contrast\nof the metallic garment with her soft, white skin was disturbing, and\nher long hair suggested things. It was hard to think of her as scheming\nsomething or other; scheming Selene was displaced in his mind by\nSelene in chamber.\n\nBut what was she up to? Had she perhaps heard that he was to be\nelevated? Was Griffin going to be swooped on by the Maintainers? Was he\nto kill off Griffin so she could leech onto some rising third party?\nWas she perhaps merely giving her man a touch of the lash?\n\nHe wished gloomily that the binoculars-problem and the Selene-problem\nhad not come together. That trickster Almon had spoken of youth as\nthough it were something for congratulation; he hated being young and\nstupid and unable to puzzle out the faulty binoculars and the warmth of\nGriffin's woman.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe attack alarm roared through the Spartan corridor. He ducked through\nthe nearest door into a vacant bedroom and under the heavy steel table.\nSomebody else floundered under the table a moment later, and a third\nperson tried to join them.\n\nThe firstcomer roared: \"Get out and find your own shelter! I don't\npropose to be crowded out by you or to crowd you out either and see\nyour ugly blood and brains if there's a hit. Go, now!\"\n\n\"Forgive me, sir! At once, sir!\" the latecomer wailed; and scrambled\naway as the alarm continued to roar.\n\nReuben gasped at the \"sirs\" and looked at his neighbor. It was May!\nTrapped, no doubt, on an inspection tour of the level.\n\n\"Sir,\" he said respectfully, \"if you wish to be alone, I can find\nanother room.\"\n\n\"You may stay with me for company. Are you one of mine?\" There was\npower in the general's voice and on his craggy face.\n\n\"Yes, sir. May's man Reuben, of the eighty-third level, Atomist.\"\n\nMay surveyed him, and Reuben noted that there were pouches of skin\ndepending from cheekbones and the jaw line--dead-looking, coarse-pored\nskin.\n\n\"You're a well-made boy, Reuben. Do you have women?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Reuben hastily. \"One after another--I _always_ have\nwomen. I'm making up at this time to a charming thing called Selene.\nWell-rounded, yet firm, soft but supple, with long red hair and long\nwhite legs--\"\n\n\"Spare me the details,\" muttered the general. \"It takes all kinds.\nAn Atomist, you said. That has a future, to be sure. I myself was a\nController long ago. The calling seems to have gone out of fashion--\"\n\nAbruptly the alarm stopped. The silence was hard to bear.\n\nMay swallowed and went on: \"--for some reason or other. Why don't\nyoungsters elect for Controller any more? Why didn't you, for instance?\"\n\nReuben wished he could be saved by a direct hit. The binoculars,\nSelene, the raid, and now he was supposed to make intelligent\nconversation with a general.\n\n\"I really don't know, sir,\" he said miserably. \"At the time there\nseemed to be very little difference--Controller, Atomist, Missiler,\nMaintainer. We have a saying, 'The buttons are different,' which\nusually ends any conversation on the subject.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\" asked May distractedly. His face was thinly filmed with\nsweat. \"Do you suppose Ellay intends to clobber us this time?\" he\nasked almost hoarsely. \"It's been some weeks since they made a maximum\neffort, hasn't it?\"\n\n\"Four,\" said Reuben. \"I remember because one of my best Servers was\nkilled by a falling corridor roof--the only fatality and it had to\nhappen to my team!\"\n\nHe laughed nervously and realized that he was talking like a fool, but\nMay seemed not to notice.\n\nFar below them, there was a series of screaming whistles as the\ninterceptors were loosed to begin their intricate, double basketwork\nwall of defense in a towering cylinder about Denv.\n\n\"Go on, Reuben,\" said May. \"That was most interesting.\" His eyes were\nsearching the underside of the steel table.\n\nReuben averted his own eyes from the frightened face, feeling some\nawe drain out of him. Under a table with a general! It didn't seem so\nstrange now.\n\n\"Perhaps, sir, you can tell me what a puzzling thing, that happened\nthis afternoon, means. A fellow--Rudolph's man Almon, of the\neighty-ninth level--gave me a pair of binoculars that flashed in my\neyes and then went opaque. Has your wide experience--\"\n\nMay laughed hoarsely and said in a shaky voice: \"That old trick! He\nwas photographing your retinas for the blood-vessel pattern. One of\nRudolph's men, eh? I'm glad you spoke to me; I'm old enough to spot a\nrevival like that. Perhaps my good friend Rudolph plans--\"\n\nThere was a thudding volley in the air and then a faint jar. One had\ngot through, exploding, from the feel of it, far down at the foot of\nDenv.\n\nThe alarm roared again, in bursts that meant all clear; only one flight\nof missiles and that disposed of.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Atomist and the general climbed out from under the table; May's\nsecretary popped through the door. The general waved him out again and\nleaned heavily on the table, his arms quivering. Reuben hastily brought\na chair.\n\n\"A glass of water,\" said May.\n\nThe Atomist brought it. He saw the general wash down what looked like a\ntriple dose of XXX--green capsules which it was better to leave alone.\n\nMay said after a moment: \"That's better. And don't look so shocked,\nyoungster; you don't know the strain we're under. It's only a temporary\nmeasure which I shall discontinue as soon as things ease up a bit. I\nwas saying that perhaps my good friend Rudolph plans to substitute one\nof his men for one of mine. Tell me, how long has this fellow Almon\nbeen a friend of yours?\"\n\n\"He struck up an acquaintance with me only last week. I should have\nrealized--\"\n\n\"You certainly should have. One week. Time enough and more. By now\nyou've been photographed, your fingerprints taken, your voice recorded\nand your gait studied without your knowledge. Only the retinascope is\ndifficult, but one must risk it for a real double. Have you killed your\nman, Reuben?\"\n\nHe nodded; It had been a silly brawl two years ago over precedence at\nthe refectory; he disliked being reminded of it.\n\n\"Good,\" said May grimly. \"The way these things are done, your double\nkills you in a secluded spot, disposes of your body and takes over your\nrole. We shall reverse it. You will kill the double and take over _his_\nrole.\"\n\nThe powerful, methodical voice ticked off possibilities and\ncontingencies, measures, and countermeasures. Reuben absorbed them\nand felt his awe return. Perhaps May had not really been frightened\nunder the table; perhaps it had been he reading his own terror in the\ngeneral's face. May was actually talking to him of backgrounds and\npolicies. \"Up from the eighty-third level!\" he swore to himself as the\ngreat names were uttered.\n\n\"My good friend Rudolph, of course, wants the five stars. You would\nnot know this, but the man who wears the stars is now eighty years old\nand failing fast. I consider myself a likely candidate to replace him.\nSo, evidently, must Rudolph. No doubt he plans to have your double\nperpetrate some horrible blunder on the eve of the election, and the\ndiscredit would reflect on me. Now what you and I must do--\"\n\nYou and I--May's man Reuben and May--up from the eighty-third! Up from\nthe bare corridors and cheerless bedrooms to marble halls and vaulted\nchambers! From the clatter of the crowded refectory to small and\nglowing restaurants where you had your own table and servant and where\nmusic came softly from the walls! Up from the scramble to win this\nwoman or that, by wit or charm or the poor bribes you could afford,\nto the eminence from which you could calmly command your pick of the\nbeauty of Denv! From the moiling intrigue of tripping your fellow\nAtomist and guarding against him tripping you to the heroic thrust and\nparry of generals!\n\nUp from the eighty-third!\n\nThen May dismissed him with a speech whose implications were\ndeliriously exciting. \"I need an able man and a young one, Reuben.\nPerhaps I've waited too long looking for him. If you do well in this\ntouchy business, I'll consider you very seriously for an important task\nI have in mind.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLate that night, Selene came to his bedroom.\n\n\"I know you don't like me,\" she said pettishly, \"but Griffin's such a\nfool and I wanted somebody to talk to. Do you mind? What was it like up\nthere today? Did you see carpets? I wish I had a carpet.\"\n\nHe tried to think about carpets and not the exciting contrast of\nmetallic cloth and flesh.\n\n\"I saw one through an open door,\" he remembered. \"It looked odd, but I\nsuppose a person gets used to them. Perhaps I didn't see a very good\none. Aren't the good ones very thick?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"Your feet sink into them. I wish I had a _good_\ncarpet and four chairs and a small table as high as my knees to put\nthings on and as many pillows as I wanted. Griffin's such a fool. Do\nyou think I'll ever get those things? I've never caught the eye of a\ngeneral. Am I pretty enough to get one, do you think?\"\n\nHe said uneasily: \"Of course you're a pretty thing, Selene. But carpets\nand chairs and pillows--\" It made him uncomfortable, like the thought\nof peering up through binoculars from a parapet.\n\n\"I want them,\" she said unhappily. \"I like you very much, but I want so\nmany things and soon I'll be too old even for the eighty-third level,\nbefore I've been up higher, and I'll spend the rest of my life tending\nbabies or cooking in the creche or the refectory.\"\n\nShe stopped abruptly, pulled herself together and gave him a smile that\nwas somehow ghastly in the half-light.\n\n\"You bungler,\" he said, and she instantly looked at the door with the\nsmile frozen on her face. Reuben took a pistol from under his pillow\nand demanded, \"When do you expect him?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" she asked shrilly. \"Who are you talking about?\"\n\n\"My double. Don't be a fool, Selene. May and I--\" he savored it--\"May\nand I know all about it. He warned me to beware of a diversion by a\nwoman while the double slipped in and killed me. When do you expect\nhim?\"\n\n\"I really _do_ like you,\" Selene sobbed. \"But Almon promised to take\nme up there and I _knew_ when I was where they'd see me that I'd meet\nsomebody really important. I really do like you, but soon I'll be too\nold--\"\n\n\"Selene, listen to me. Listen to me! You'll get your chance. Nobody but\nyou and me will know that the substitution didn't succeed!\"\n\n\"Then I'll be spying for you on Almon, won't I?\" she asked in a choked\nvoice. \"All I wanted was a few nice things before I got too old. All\nright, I was supposed to be in your arms at 2350 hours.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was 2349. Reuben sprang from bed and stood by the door, his pistol\nsilenced and ready. At 2350 a naked man slipped swiftly into the room,\nheading for the bed as he raised a ten-centimeter poignard. He stopped\nin dismay when he realized that the bed was empty.\n\nReuben killed him with a bullet through the throat.\n\n\"But he doesn't look a bit like me,\" he said in bewilderment, closely\nexamining the face. \"Just in a general way.\"\n\nSelene said dully: \"Almon told me people always say that when they see\ntheir doubles. It's funny, isn't it? He looks just like you, really.\"\n\n\"How was my body to be disposed of?\"\n\nShe produced a small flat box. \"A shadow suit. You were to be left here\nand somebody would come tomorrow.\"\n\n\"We won't disappoint him.\" Reuben pulled the web of the shadow suit\nover his double and turned on the power. In the half-lit room, it was a\nperfect disappearance; by daylight it would be less perfect. \"They'll\nask why the body was shot instead of knifed. Tell them you shot me with\nthe gun from under the pillow. Just say I heard the double come in and\nyou were afraid there might have been a struggle.\"\n\nShe listlessly asked: \"How do you know I won't betray you?\"\n\n\"You won't, Selene.\" His voice bit. \"You're _broken_.\"\n\nShe nodded vaguely, started to say something and then went out without\nsaying it.\n\nReuben luxuriously stretched in his narrow bed. Later, his beds would\nbe wider and softer, he thought. He drifted into sleep on a half-formed\nthought that some day he might vote with other generals on the man to\nwear the five stars--or even wear them himself, Master of Denv.\n\nHe slept healthily through the morning alarm and arrived late at his\nregular twentieth-level station. He saw his superior, May's man Oscar\nof the eighty-fifth level, Atomist, ostentatiously take his name. Let\nhim!\n\nOscar assembled his crew for a grim announcement: \"We are going to even\nthe score, and perhaps a little better, with Ellay. At sunset there\nwill be three flights of missiles from Deck One.\"\n\nThere was a joyous murmur and Reuben trotted off on his task.\n\nAll forenoon he was occupied with drawing plutonium slugs from\nhyper-suspicious storekeepers in the great rock-quarried vaults, and\nseeing them through countless audits and assays all the way to Weapons\nAssembly. Oscar supervised the scores there who assembled the curved\nslugs and the explosive lenses into sixty-kilogram warheads.\n\nIn mid-afternoon there was an incident. Reuben saw Oscar step aside\nfor a moment to speak to a Maintainer whose guard fell on one of the\nAssembly Servers, and dragged him away as he pleaded innocence. He had\nbeen detected in sabotage. When the warheads were in and the Missilers\nseated, waiting at their boards, the two Atomists rode up to the\neighty-third's refectory.\n\nThe news of a near-maximum effort was in the air; it was electric.\nReuben heard on all sides in tones of self-congratulation: \"We'll\nclobber them tonight!\"\n\n\"That Server you caught,\" he said to Oscar. \"What was he up to?\"\n\nHis commander stared. \"Are you trying to learn my job? Don't try it, I\nwarn you. If my black marks against you aren't enough, I could always\narrange for some fissionable material in your custody to go astray.\"\n\n\"No, no! I was just wondering why people do something like that.\"\n\nOscar sniffed doubtfully. \"He's probably insane, like all the Angelos.\nI've heard the climate does it to them. You're not a Maintainer or a\nController. Why worry about it?\"\n\n\"They'll brainburn him, I suppose?\"\n\n\"I suppose. _Listen!_\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDeck One was firing. One, two, three, four, five, six. One, two, three,\nfour, five, six. One, two, three, four, five, six.\n\nPeople turned to one another and shook hands, laughed and slapped\nshoulders heartily. Eighteen missiles were racing through the\nstratosphere, soon to tumble on Ellay. With any luck, one or two would\nslip through the first wall of interceptors and blast close enough to\nsmash windows and topple walls in the crazy city by the ocean. It would\nserve the lunatics right.\n\nFive minutes later an exultant voice filled most of Denv.\n\n\"Recon missile report,\" it said. \"Eighteen launched, eighteen perfect\ntrajectories. Fifteen shot down by Ellay first-line interceptors, three\nshot down by Ellay second-line interceptors. Extensive blast damage\nobserved in Griffith Park area of Ellay!\"\n\nThere were cheers.\n\nAnd eight Full Maintainers marched into the refectory silently, and\nmarched out with Reuben.\n\nHe knew better than to struggle or ask futile questions. Any question\nyou asked of a Maintainer was futile. But he goggled when they marched\nhim onto an upward-bound stairway.\n\nThey rode past the eighty-ninth level and Reuben lost count, seeing\nonly the marvels of the upper reaches of Denv. He saw carpets that ran\nthe entire length of corridors, and intricate fountains, and mosaic\nwalls, stained-glass windows, more wonders than he could recognize,\nthings for which he had no name.\n\nHe was marched at last into a wood-paneled room with a great polished\ndesk and a map behind it. He saw May, and another man who must have\nbeen a general--Rudolph?--but sitting at the desk was a frail old man\nwho wore a circlet of stars on each khaki shoulder.\n\nThe old man said to Reuben: \"You are an Ellay spy and saboteur.\"\n\nReuben looked at May. Did one speak directly to the man who wore the\nstars, even in reply to such an accusation?\n\n\"Answer him, Reuben,\" May said kindly.\n\n\"I am May's man Reuben, of the eighty-third level, an Atomist,\" he said.\n\n\"Explain,\" said the other general heavily, \"if you can, why all\neighteen of the warheads you procured today failed to fire.\"\n\n\"But they did!\" gasped Reuben. \"The Recon missile report said there\nwas blast damage from the three that got through and it didn't say\nanything about the others failing to fire.\"\n\nThe other general suddenly looked sick and May looked even kindlier.\nThe man who wore the stars turned inquiringly to the chief of the\nMaintainers, who nodded and said: \"That was the Recon missile report,\nsir.\"\n\nThe general snapped: \"What I said was that he would _attempt_ to\nsabotage the attack. Evidently he failed. I also said he is a faulty\ndouble, somehow slipped with great ease into my good friend May's\norganization. You will find that his left thumb print is a clumsy\nforgery of the real Reuben's thumb print and that his hair has been\nartificially darkened.\"\n\nThe old man nodded at the chief of the Maintainers, who said: \"We have\nhis card, sir.\"\n\nReuben abruptly found himself being fingerprinted and deprived of some\nhair.\n\n\"The f.p.s check, sir,\" one Maintainer said. \"He's Reuben.\"\n\n\"Hair's natural, sir,\" said another.\n\nThe general began a rear-guard action: \"My information about his hair\nseems to have been inaccurate. But the fingerprint means only that\nEllay spies substituted his prints for Reuben's prints in the files--\"\n\n\"Enough, sir,\" said the old man with the stars. \"Dismissed. All of you.\nRudolph, I am surprised. All of you, go.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nReuben found himself in a vast apartment with May, who was bubbling and\nchuckling uncontrollably until he popped three of the green capsules\ninto his mouth hurriedly.\n\n\"This means the eclipse for years of my good friend Rudolph,\" he\ncrowed. \"His game was to have your double sabotage the attack warheads\nand so make it appear that my organization is rotten with spies. The\ndouble must have been under post-hypnotic, primed to admit everything.\nRudolph was so sure of himself that he made his accusations before the\nattack, the fool!\"\n\nHe fumbled out the green capsules again.\n\n\"Sir,\" said Reuben, alarmed.\n\n\"Only temporary,\" May muttered, and swallowed a fourth. \"But you're\nright. You leave them alone. There are big things to be done in your\ntime, not in mine. I told you I needed a young man who could claw his\nway to the top. Rudolph's a fool. He doesn't need the capsules because\nhe doesn't ask questions. Funny, I thought a coup like the double\naffair would hit me hard, but I don't feel a thing. It's not like the\nold days. I used to plan and plan, and when the trap went _snap_ it was\nbetter than this stuff. But now I don't feel a thing.\"\n\nHe leaned forward from his chair; the pupils of his eyes were black\nbullets.\n\n\"Do you want to _work_?\" he demanded. \"Do you want your world stood on\nits head and your brains to crack and do the only worthwhile job there\nis to do? Answer me!\"\n\n\"Sir, I am a loyal May's man. I want to obey your orders and use my\nability to the full.\"\n\n\"Good enough,\" said the general. \"You've got brains, you've got push.\nI'll do the spade work. I won't last long enough to push it through.\nYou'll have to follow. Ever been outside of Denv?\"\n\nReuben stiffened.\n\n\"I'm not accusing you of being a spy. It's really all right to go\noutside of Denv. I've been outside. There isn't much to see at first--a\nlot of ground pocked and torn up by shorts and overs from Ellay and us.\nFarther out, especially east, it's different. Grass, trees, flowers.\nPlaces where you could grow food.\n\n\"When I went outside, it troubled me. It made me ask questions. I\nwanted to know how we started. Yes--started. _It wasn't always like\nthis._ Somebody built Denv. Am I getting the idea across to you? _It\nwasn't always like this!_\n\n\"Somebody set up the reactors to breed uranium and make plutonium.\nSomebody tooled us up for the missiles. Somebody wired the boards to\ncontrol them. Somebody started the hydroponics tanks.\n\n\"I've dug through the archives. Maybe I found something. I saw\nmountains of strength reports, ration reports, supply reports, and yet\nI never got back to the beginning. I found a piece of paper and maybe\nI understood it and maybe I didn't. It was about the water of the\nColorado River and who should get how much of it. How can you divide\nwater in a river? But it could have been the start of Denv, Ellay, and\nthe missile attacks.\"\n\nThe general shook his head, puzzled, and went on: \"I don't see clearly\nwhat's ahead. I want to make peace between Denv and Ellay, but I don't\nknow how to start or what it will be like. I think it must mean not\nfiring, not even making any more weapons. Maybe it means that some of\nus, or a lot of us, will go out of Denv and live a different kind of\nlife. That's why I've clawed my way up. That's why I need a young man\nwho can claw with the best of them. Tell me what you think.\"\n\n\"I think,\" said Reuben measuredly, \"it's magnificent--the salvation of\nDenv. I'll back you to my dying breath if you'll let me.\"\n\nMay smiled tiredly and leaned back in the chair as Reuben tip-toed out.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhat luck, Reuben thought--what unbelievable luck to be at a fulcrum of\nhistory like this!\n\nHe searched the level for Rudolph's apartment and gained admission.\n\nTo the general, he said: \"Sir, I have to report that your friend May is\ninsane. He has just been raving to me, advocating the destruction of\ncivilization as we know it, and urging me to follow in his footsteps. I\npretended to agree--since I can be of greater service to you if I'm in\nMay's confidence.\"\n\n\"So?\" said Rudolph thoughtfully. \"Tell me about the double. How did\nthat go wrong?\"\n\n\"The bunglers were Selene and Almon. Selene because she alarmed me\ninstead of distracting me. Almon because he failed to recognize her\nincompetence.\"\n\n\"They shall be brainburned. That leaves an eighty-ninth-level vacancy\nin my organization, doesn't it?\"\n\n\"You're very kind, sir, but I think I should remain a May's\nman--outwardly. If I earn any rewards, I can wait for them. I presume\nthat May will be elected to wear the five stars.

It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\nwww.gutenberg.org\n\n\n\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Newby\n    Chief Executive and Director\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
