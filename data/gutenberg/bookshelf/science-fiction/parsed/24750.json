Bradley.\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE.\n\n\nThe narrative of Vera Zarovitch, published in the _Cincinnati\nCommercial_ in 1880 and 1881, attracted a great deal of attention. It\ncommanded a wide circle of readers, and there was much more said about\nit than is usual when works of fiction run through a newspaper in weekly\ninstallments. Quite a number of persons who are unaccustomed to\nbestowing consideration upon works of fiction spoke of it, and grew\ngreatly interested in it.\n\nI received many messages about it, and letters of inquiry, and some\nladies and gentlemen desired to know the particulars about the\nproduction of the story in book form; and were inquisitive about it and\nthe author who kept herself in concealment so closely that even her\nhusband did not know that she was the writer who was making this stir in\nour limited literary world.\n\nI was myself so much interested in it that it occurred to me to make the\nsuggestion that the story ought to have an extensive sale in book form,\nand to write to a publisher; but the lady who wrote the work seemed\nherself a shade indifferent on the subject, and it passed out of my\nhands and out of my mind.\n\nIt is safe to say that it made an impression that was remarkable, and\nwith a larger audience I do not doubt that it would make its mark as an\noriginal production wrought out with thoughtful care and literary skill,\nand take high rank.\n\n                                Yours very truly,\n\n                                    Murat Halstead.\n\n_Nov. 14th, 1889._\n\n\n\n\nPART FIRST\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\n\nHaving little knowledge of rhetorical art, and possessing but a limited\nimagination, it is only a strong sense of the duty I owe to Science and\nthe progressive minds of the age, that induces me to come before the\npublic in the character of an author. True, I have only a simple\nnarration of facts to deal with, and am, therefore, not expected to\npresent artistic effects, and poetical imagery, nor any of those flights\nof imagination that are the trial and test of genius.\n\nYet my task is not a light one. I may fail to satisfy my own mind that\nthe true merits of the wonderful and mysterious people I discovered,\nhave been justly described. I may fail to interest the public; which is\nthe one difficulty most likely to occur, and most to be regretted--not\nfor my own sake, but theirs. It is so hard to get human nature out of\nthe ruts it has moved in for ages. To tear away their present faith, is\nlike undermining their existence. Yet others who come after me will be\nmore aggressive than I. I have this consolation: whatever reception may\nbe given my narrative by the public, I know that it has been written\nsolely for its good. That wonderful civilization I met with in Mizora, I\nmay not be able to more than faintly shadow forth here, yet from it, the\npresent age may form some idea of that grand, that ideal life that is\npossible for our remote posterity. Again and again has religious\nenthusiasm pictured a life to be eliminated from the grossness and\nimperfections of our material existence. The Spirit--the Mind--that\nmental gift, by or through which we think, reason, and suffer, is by one\ntragic and awful struggle to free itself from temporal blemishes and\ndifficulties, and become spiritual and perfect. Yet, who, sweeping the\nlimitless fields of space with a telescope, glancing at myriads of\nworlds that a lifetime could not count, or gazing through a microscope\nat a tiny world in a drop of water, has dreamed that patient Science\nand practice could evolve for the living human race, the ideal life of\nexalted knowledge: the life that I found in Mizora; that Science had\nmade real and practicable. The duty that I owe to truth compels me to\nacknowledge that I have not been solicited to write this narrative by my\nfriends; nor has it been the pastime of my leisure hours; nor written to\namuse an invalid; nor, in fact, for any of those reasons which have\nprompted so many men and women to write a book. It is, on the contrary,\nthe result of hours of laborious work, undertaken for the sole purpose\nof benefiting Science and giving encouragement to those progressive\nminds who have already added their mite of knowledge to the coming\nfuture of the race. \"We owe a duty to posterity,\" says Junius in his\nfamous letter to the king. A declaration that ought to be a motto for\nevery schoolroom, and graven above every legislative hall in the world.\nIt should be taught to the child as soon as reason has begun to dawn,\nand be its guide until age has become its master.\n\nIt is my desire not to make this story a personal matter; and for that\nunavoidable prominence which is given one's own identity in relating\npersonal experiences, an indulgence is craved from whomsoever may peruse\nthese pages.\n\nIn order to explain how and why I came to venture upon a journey no\nother of my sex has ever attempted, I am compelled to make a slight\nmention of my family and nationality.\n\nI am a Russian: born to a family of nobility, wealth, and political\npower. Had the natural expectations for my birth and condition been\nfulfilled, I should have lived, loved, married and died a Russian\naristocrat, and been unknown to the next generation--and this narrative\nwould not have been written.\n\nThere are some people who seem to have been born for the sole purpose of\nbecoming the playthings of Fate--who are tossed from one condition of\nlife to another without wish or will of their own. Of this class I am an\nillustration. Had I started out with a resolve to discover the North\nPole, I should never have succeeded. But all my hopes, affections,\nthoughts, and desires were centered in another direction, hence--but my\nnarrative will explain the rest.\n\nThe tongue of woman has long been celebrated as an unruly member, and\nperhaps, in some of the domestic affairs of life, it has been\nunnecessarily active; yet no one who gives this narrative a perusal, can\njustly deny that it was the primal cause of the grandest discovery of\nthe age.\n\nI was educated in Paris, where my vacations were frequently spent with\nan American family who resided there, and with whom my father had formed\nan intimate friendship. Their house, being in a fashionable quarter of\nthe city and patriotically hospitable, was the frequent resort of many\nof their countrymen. I unconsciously acquired a knowledge and admiration\nfor their form of government, and some revolutionary opinions in regard\nto my own.\n\nHad I been guided by policy, I should have kept the latter a secret, but\non returning home, at the expiration of my school days, I imprudently\ngave expression to them in connection with some of the political\nmovements of the Russian Government--and secured its suspicion at once,\nwhich, like the virus of some fatal disease, once in the system, would\nlose its vitality only with my destruction.\n\nWhile at school, I had become attached to a young and lovely Polish\norphan, whose father had been killed at the battle of Grochow when she\nwas an infant in her mother's arms. My love for my friend, and sympathy\nfor her oppressed people, finally drew me into serious trouble and\ncaused my exile from my native land.\n\nI married at the age of twenty the son of my father's dearest friend.\nAlexis and I were truly attached to each other, and when I gave to my\ninfant the name of my father and witnessed his pride and delight, I\nthought to my cup of earthly happiness, not one more drop could be\nadded.\n\nA desire to feel the cheering air of a milder climate induced me to pay\nmy Polish friend a visit. During my sojourn with her occurred the\nanniversary of the tragedy of Grochow, when, according to custom, all\nwho had lost friends in the two dreadful battles that had been fought\nthere, met to offer prayers for their souls. At her request, I\naccompanied my friend to witness the ceremonies. To me, a silent and\nsympathizing spectator, they were impressive and solemn in the extreme.\nNot less than thirty thousand people were there, weeping and praying on\nground hallowed by patriot blood. After the prayers were said, the voice\nof the multitude rose in a mournful and pathetic chant. It was rudely\nbroken by the appearance of the Russian soldiers.\n\nA scene ensued which memory refuses to forget, and justice forbids me to\ndeny. I saw my friend, with the song of sorrow still trembling on her\ninnocent lips, fall bleeding, dying from the bayonet thrust of a Russian\nsoldier. I clasped the lifeless body in my arms, and in my grief and\nexcitement, poured forth upbraidings against the government of my\ncountry which it would never forgive nor condone. I was arrested, tried,\nand condemned to the mines of Siberia for life.\n\nMy father's ancient and princely lineage, my husband's rank, the wealth\nof both families, all were unavailing in procuring a commutation of my\nsentence to some less severe punishment. Through bribery, however, the\nco-operation of one of my jailors was secured, and I escaped in disguise\nto the frontier.\n\nIt was my husband's desire that I proceed immediately to France, where\nhe would soon join me. But we were compelled to accept whatever means\nchance offered for my escape, and a whaling vessel bound for the\nNorthern Seas was the only thing I could secure passage upon with\nsafety. The captain promised to transfer me to the first southward bound\nvessel we should meet.\n\nBut none came. The slow, monotonous days found me gliding farther and\nfarther from home and love. In the seclusion of my little cabin, my fate\nwas more endurable than the horrors of Siberia could have been, but it\nwas inexpressibly lonesome. On shipboard I sustained the character of a\nyouth, exiled for a political offense, and of a delicate constitution.\n\nIt is not necessary to the interest of this narrative to enter into the\ndetails of shipwreck and disaster, which befel us in the Northern Seas.\nOur vessel was caught between ice floes, and we were compelled to\nabandon her. The small boats were converted into sleds, but in such\nshape as would make it easy to re-convert them into boats again, should\nit ever become necessary. We took our march for the nearest Esquimaux\nsettlement, where we were kindly received and tendered the hospitality\nof their miserable huts. The captain, who had been ill for some time,\ngrew rapidly worse, and in a few days expired. As soon as the approach\nof death became apparent, he called the crew about him, and requested\nthem to make their way south as soon as possible, and to do all in their\npower for my health and comfort. He had, he said, been guaranteed a sum\nof money for my safe conduct to France, sufficient to place his family\nin independent circumstances, and he desired that his crew should do all\nin their power to secure it for them.\n\nThe next morning I awoke to find myself deserted, the crew having\ndecamped with nearly everything brought from the ship.\n\nBeing blessed with strong nerves, I stared my situation bravely in the\nface, and resolved to make the best of it. I believed it could be only a\nmatter of time when some European or American whaling vessel should\nrescue me: and I had the resolution to endure, while hope fed the flame.\n\nI at once proceeded to inure myself to the life of the Esquimaux. I\nhabited myself in a suit of reindeer fur, and ate, with compulsory\nappetite, the raw flesh and fat that form their principal food.\nAcclimated by birth to the coldest region of the temperate zone, and\nnaturally of a hardy constitution, I found it not so difficult to endure\nthe rigors of the Arctic temperature as I had supposed.\n\nI soon discovered the necessity of being an assistance to my new friends\nin procuring food, as their hospitality depends largely upon the state\nof their larder. A compass and a small trunk of instruments belonging to\nthe Captain had been either over-looked or rejected by the crew in their\nflight. I secured the esteem of the Esquimaux by using the compass to\nconduct a hunting party in the right direction when a sudden snow-storm\nhad obscured the landmarks by which they guide their course. I\ncheerfully assumed a share of their hardships, for with these poor\nchildren of the North life is a continual struggle with cold and\nstarvation. The long, rough journeys which we frequently took over ice\nand ridges of snow in quest of animal food, I found monotonously\ndestitute of everything I had experienced in former traveling, except\nfatigue. The wail of the winds, and the desolate landscape of ice and\nsnow, never varied. The coruscations of the Aurora Borealis sometimes\nlighted up the dreary waste around us, and the myriad eyes of the\nfirmament shone out with a brighter lustre, as twilight shrank before\nthe gloom of the long Arctic night.\n\nA description of the winter I spent with the Esquimaux can be of little\ninterest to the readers of this narrative. Language cannot convey to\nthose who have dwelt always in comfort the feeling of isolation, the\nstruggle with despair, that was constantly mine. We were often confined\nto our ice huts for days while the blinding fury of the wind driven snow\nwithout made the earth look like chaos. Sometimes I crept to the narrow\nentrance and looked toward the South with a feeling of homesickness too\nintense to describe. Away, over leagues of perilous travel, lay\neverything that was dear or congenial; and how many dreary months,\nperhaps years, must pass before I could obtain release from associations\nmore dreadful than solitude. It required all the courage I could command\nto endure it.\n\nThe whale-fishing opens about the first week in August, and continues\nthroughout September. As it drew near, the settlement prepared to move\nfarther north, to a locality where they claimed whales could be found\nin abundance. I cheerfully assisted in the preparations, for to meet\nsome whaling vessel was my only hope of rescue from surroundings that\nmade existence a living death.\n\nThe dogs were harnessed to sleds heavily laden with the equipments of an\nEsquimaux hut. The woman, as well as the men, were burdened with immense\npacks; and our journey begun. We halted only to rest and sleep. A few\nhours work furnished us a new house out of the ever present ice. We\nfeasted on raw meat--sometimes a freshly killed deer; after which our\njourney was resumed.\n\nAs near as I could determine, it was close to the 85\u00b0 north latitude,\nwhere we halted on the shore of an open sea. Wild ducks and game were\nabundant, also fish of an excellent quality. Here, for the first time in\nmany months, I felt the kindly greeting of a mild breeze as it hailed me\nfrom the bosom of the water. Vegetation was not profuse nor brilliant,\nbut to my long famished eyes, its dingy hue was delightfully refreshing.\n\nAcross this sea I instantly felt a strong desire to sail. I believed it\nmust contain an island of richer vegetation than the shore we occupied.\nBut no one encouraged me or would agree to be my companion. On the\ncontrary, they intimated that I should never return. I believed that\nthey were trying to frighten me into remaining with them, and declared\nmy intention to go alone. Perhaps I might meet in that milder climate\nsome of my own race. My friend smiled, and pointing to the South, said,\nas he designated an imaginary boundary:\n\n\"Across _that_ no white man's foot has ever stepped.\"\n\nSo I was alone. My resolution, however, was not shaken. A boat was\nconstructed, and bidding adieu to my humble companions, I launched into\nan unknown sea.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n\nOn and on, and on I rowed until the shore and my late companions were\nlost in the gloomy distance. On and on, and still on, until fatigued\nalmost to exhaustion; and still, no land. A feeling of uncontrollable\nlonesomeness took possession of me. Silence reigned supreme. No sound\ngreeted me save the swirl of the gently undulating waters against the\nboat, and the melancholy dip of the oars. Overhead, the familiar eyes of\nnight were all that pierced the gloom that seemed to hedge me in. My\nfeeling of distress increased when I discovered that my boat had struck\na current and was beyond my control. Visions of a cataract and\ninevitable death instantly shot across my mind. Made passive by intense\ndespair, I laid down in the bottom of the boat, to let myself drift into\nwhatever fate was awaiting me.\n\nI must have lain there many hours before I realized that I was traveling\nin a circle. The velocity of the current had increased, but not\nsufficiently to insure immediately destruction. Hope began to revive,\nand I sat up and looked about me with renewed courage. Directly before\nme rose a column of mist, so thin that I could see through it, and of\nthe most delicate tint of green. As I gazed, it spread into a curtain\nthat appeared to be suspended in mid-air, and began to sway gently back\nand forth, as if impelled by a slight breeze, while sparks of fire, like\ncountless swarms of fire-flies, darted through it and blazed out into a\nthousand brilliant hues and flakes of color that chased one another\nacross and danced merrily up and down with bewildering swiftness.\nSuddenly it drew together in a single fold, a rope of yellow mist, then\ninstantly shook itself out again as a curtain of rainbows fringed with\nflame. Myriads of tassels, composed of threads of fire, began to dart\nhither and thither through it, while the rainbow stripes deepened in hue\nuntil they looked like gorgeous ribbons glowing with intensest radiance,\nyet softened by that delicate misty appearance which is a special\nquality of all atmospheric color, and which no pencil can paint, nor the\nmost eloquent tongue adequately describe.\n\nThe swaying motion continued. Sometimes the curtain approached near\nenough, apparently, to flaunt its fiery fringe almost within my grasp.\nIt hung one instant in all its marvelous splendor of colors, then\nsuddenly rushed into a compact mass, and shot across the zenith, an arc\nof crimson fire that lit up the gloomy waters with a weird, unearthly\nglare. It faded quickly, and appeared to settle upon the water again in\na circular wall of amber mist, round which the current was hurrying me\nwith rapidly increasing speed. I saw, with alarm, that the circles were\nnarrowing A whirlpool was my instant conjecture, and I laid myself down\nin the boat, again expecting every moment to be swept into a seething\nabyss of waters. The spray dashed into my face as the boat plunged\nforward with frightful swiftness. A semi-stupor, born of exhaustion and\nterror, seized me in its merciful embrace.\n\nIt must have been many hours that I lay thus. I have a dim recollection\nof my boat going on and on, its speed gradually decreasing, until I was\namazed to perceive that it had ceased its onward motion and was gently\nrocking on quiet waters. I opened my eyes. A rosy light, like the first\nblush of a new day, permeated the atmosphere. I sat up and looked about\nme. A circular wall of pale amber mist rose behind me; the shores of a\nnew and beautiful country stretched before. Toward them, I guided my\nboat with reviving hope and strength.\n\nI entered a broad river, whose current was from the sea, and let myself\ndrift along its banks in bewildered delight. The sky appeared bluer, and\nthe air balmier than even that of Italy's favored clime. The turf that\ncovered the banks was smooth and fine, like a carpet of rich green\nvelvet. The fragrance of tempting fruit was wafted by the zephyrs from\nnumerous orchards. Birds of bright plumage flitted among the branches,\nanon breaking forth into wild and exultant melody, as if they rejoiced\nto be in so favored a clime.\n\nAnd truly it seemed a land of enchantment. The atmosphere had a peculiar\ntransparency, seemingly to bring out clearly objects at a great\ndistance, yet veiling the far horizon in a haze of gold and purple.\nOverhead, clouds of the most gorgeous hues, like precious gems converted\ninto vapor, floated in a sky of the serenest azure. The languorous\natmosphere, the beauty of the heavens, the inviting shores, produced in\nme a feeling of contentment not easily described. To add to my senses\nanother enjoyment, my ears were greeted with sounds of sweet music, in\nwhich I detected the mingling of human voices.\n\nI wondered if I had really drifted into an enchanted country, such as I\nhad read about in the fairy books of my childhood.\n\nThe music grew louder, yet wondrously sweet, and a large pleasure boat,\nshaped like a fish, glided into view. Its scales glittered like gems as\nit moved gracefully and noiselessly through the water. Its occupants\nwere all young girls of the highest type of blonde beauty. It was their\nsoft voices, accompanied by some peculiar stringed instruments they\ncarried, that had produced the music I had heard. They appeared to\nregard me with curiosity, not unmixed with distrust, for their boat\nswept aside to give me a wide berth.\n\nI uncovered my head, shook down my long black hair, and falling upon my\nknees, lifted my hands in supplication. My plea was apparently\nunderstood, for turning their boat around, they motioned me to follow\nthem. This I did with difficulty, for I was weak, and their boat moved\nwith a swiftness and ease that astonished me. What surprised me most was\nits lack of noise.\n\nAs I watched its beautiful occupants dressed in rich garments, adorned\nwith rare and costly gems, and noted the noiseless, gliding swiftness of\ntheir boat, an uncomfortable feeling of mystery began to invade my mind,\nas though I really had chanced upon enchanted territory.\n\nAs we glided along, I began to be impressed by the weird stillness. No\nsound greeted me from the ripening orchards, save the carol of birds;\nfrom the fields came no note of harvest labor. No animals were visible,\nnor sound of any. No hum of life. All nature lay asleep in voluptuous\nbeauty, veiled in a glorious atmosphere. Everything wore a dreamy look.\nThe breeze had a loving, lingering touch, not unlike to the Indian\nSummer of North America. But no Indian Summer ever knew that dark green\nverdure, like the first robe of spring. Wherever the eye turned it met\nsomething charming in cloud, or sky, or water, or vegetation. Everything\nhad felt the magical touch of beauty.\n\nOn the right, the horizon was bounded by a chain of mountains, that\nplainly showed their bases above the glowing orchards and verdant\nlandscapes. It impressed me as peculiar, that everything appeared to\nrise as it gained in distance. At last the pleasure boat halted at a\nflight of marble steps that touched the water. Ascending these, I gained\nan eminence where a scene of surpassing beauty and grandeur lay spread\nbefore me. Far, far as the eye could follow it, stretched the stately\nsplendor of a mighty city. But all the buildings were detached and\nsurrounded by lawns and shade trees, their white marble and gray granite\nwalls gleaming through the green foliage.\n\nUpon the lawn, directly before us, a number of most beautiful girls had\ndisposed themselves at various occupations. Some were reading, some\nsketching, and some at various kinds of needlework. I noticed that they\nwere all blondes. I could not determine whether their language possessed\na peculiarly soft accent, or whether it was an unusual melody of voice\nthat made their conversation as musical to the ear as the love notes of\nsome amorous wood bird to its mate.\n\nA large building of white marble crowned a slight eminence behind them.\nIts porticos were supported upon the hands of colossal statues of women,\ncarved out of white marble with exquisite art and beauty. Shade trees of\na feathery foliage, like plumes of finest moss, guarded the entrance and\nafforded homes for brilliant-plumaged birds that flew about the porticos\nand alighted on the hands and shoulders of the ladies without fear. Some\nof the trees had a smooth, straight trunk and flat top, bearing a\nstriking resemblance to a Chinese umbrella. On either side of the\nmarble-paved entrance were huge fountains that threw upward a column of\nwater a hundred feet in height, which, dissolving into spray, fell into\nimmense basins of clearest crystal. Below the rim of these basins, but\ncovered with the crystal, as with a delicate film of ice, was a wreath\nof blood red roses, that looked as though they had just been plucked\nfrom the stems and placed there for a temporary ornament. I afterward\nlearned that it was the work of an artist, and durable as granite.\n\nI supposed I had arrived at a female seminary, as not a man, or the\nsuggestion of one, was to be seen. If it were a seminary, it was for the\nwealth of the land, as house, grounds, adornments, and the ladies'\nattire were rich and elegant.\n\nI stood apart from the groups of beautiful creatures like the genus of\nanother race, enveloped in garments of fur that had seen much service. I\npresented a marked contrast. The evident culture, refinement, and\ngentleness of the ladies, banished any fear I might have entertained as\nto the treatment I should receive. But a singular silence that pervaded\neverything impressed me painfully. I stood upon the uplifted verge of an\nimmense city, but from its broad streets came no sound of traffic, no\nrattle of wheels, no hum of life. Its marble homes of opulence shone\nwhite and grand through mossy foliage; from innumerable parks the\nfountains sparkled and statues gleamed like rare gems upon a costly\nrobe; but over all a silence, as of death, reigned unbroken. The awe and\nthe mystery of it pressed heavily upon my spirit, but I could not refuse\nto obey when a lady stepped out of the group, that had doubtless been\ndiscussing me, and motioned me to follow her.\n\nShe led me through the main entrance into a lofty hall that extended\nthrough the entire building, and consisted of a number of grand arches\nrepresenting scenes in high relief of the finest sculpture. We entered a\nmagnificent salon, where a large assembly of ladies regarded me with\nunmistakable astonishment. Every one of them was a blonde. I was\npresented to one, whom I instantly took to be the Lady Superior of the\nCollege, for I had now settled it in my mind that I was in a female\nseminary, albeit one of unheard of luxury in its appointments.\n\nThe lady had a remarkable majesty of demeanor, and a noble countenance.\nHer hair was white with age, but over her features, the rosy bloom of\nyouth still lingered, as if loth to depart. She looked at me kindly and\ncritically, but not with as much surprise as the others had evinced. I\nmay here remark that I am a brunette. My guide, having apparently\nreceived some instruction in regard to me, led me upstairs into a\nprivate apartment. She placed before me a complete outfit of female\nwearing apparel, and informed me by signs that I was to put it on. She\nthen retired. The apartment was sumptuously furnished in two\ncolors--amber and lazulite. A bath-room adjoining had a beautiful\nporcelain tank with scented water, that produced a delightful feeling of\nexhilaration.\n\nHaving donned my new attire, I descended the stairs and met my guide,\nwho conducted me into a spacious dining-room. The walls were adorned\nwith paintings, principally of fruit and flowers. A large and superb\npicture of a sylvan dell in the side of a rock, was one exception. Its\ndeep, cool shadows, and the pellucid water, which a wandering sunbeam\naccidentally revealed, were strikingly realistic. Nearly all of the\npictures were upon panels of crystal that were set in the wall. The\nlight shining through them gave them an exceedingly natural effect. One\npicture that I especially admired, was of a grape vine twining around\nthe body and trunk of an old tree. It was inside of the crystal panel,\nand looked so natural that I imagined I could see its leaves and\ntendrils sway in the wind. The occupants of the dining-room were all\nladies, and again I noted the fact that they were all blondes:\nbeautiful, graceful, courteous, and with voices softer and sweeter than\nthe strains of an eolian harp.\n\nThe table, in its arrangement and decoration, was the most beautiful\none I had ever seen. The white linen cloth resembled brocaded satin. The\nknives and forks were gold, with handles of solid amber. The dishes were\nof the finest porcelain. Some of them, particularly the fruit stands,\nlooked as though composed of hoar frost. Many of the fruit stands were\nof gold filigree work. They attracted my notice at once, not so much on\naccount of the exquisite workmanship and unique design of the dishes, as\nthe wonderful fruit they contained. One stand, that resembled a huge\nAfrican lily in design, contained several varieties of plums, as large\nas hen's eggs, and transparent. They were yellow, blue and red. The\ncentre of the table was occupied by a fruit stand of larger size than\nthe others. It looked like a boat of sea foam fringed with gold moss.\nOver its outer edge hung clusters of grapes of a rich wine color, and\nclear as amethysts. The second row looked like globes of honey, the next\nwere of a pale, rose color, and the top of the pyramid was composed of\nwhite ones, the color and transparency of dew.\n\nThe fruit looked so beautiful. I thought it would be a sacrilege to\ndestroy the charm it had for the eye; but when I saw it removed by pink\ntipped fingers, whose beauty no art could represent, and saw it\ndisappear within such tempting lips. I thought the feaster worthy of the\nfeast. Fruit appeared to be the principal part of their diet, and was\nserved in its natural state. I was, however, supplied with something\nthat resembled beefsteak of a very fine quality. I afterward learned\nthat it was chemically prepared meat. At the close of the meal, a cup\nwas handed me that looked like the half of a soap bubble with all its\niridescent beauty sparkling and glancing in the light. It contained a\nbeverage that resembled chocolate, but whose flavor could not have been\nsurpassed by the fabled nectar of the gods.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\n\nI have been thus explicit in detailing the circumstances of my entrance\ninto the land of Mizora, or, in other words, the interior of the earth,\nlest some incredulous person might doubt the veracity of this narrative.\n\nIt does seem a little astonishing that a woman should have fallen by\naccident, and without intention or desire, upon a discovery that\nexplorers and scientists had for years searched for in vain. But such\nwas the fact, and, in generosity, I have endeavored to make my accident\nas serviceable to the world in general, and Science in particular, as I\ncould, by taking observations of the country, its climate and products,\nand especially its people.\n\nI met with the greatest difficulty in acquiring their language.\nAccustomed to the harsh dialect of the North, my voice was almost\nintractable in obtaining their melodious accentuation. It was,\ntherefore, many months before I mastered the difficulty sufficiently to\nconverse without embarrassment, or to make myself clearly understood.\nThe construction of their language was simple and easily understood, and\nin a short time I was able to read it with ease, and to listen to it\nwith enjoyment. Yet, before this was accomplished, I had mingled among\nthem for months, listening to a musical jargon of conversation, that I\ncould neither participate in, nor understand. All that I could therefore\ndiscover about them during this time, was by observation. This soon\ntaught me that I was not in a seminary--in our acceptance of the\nterm--but in a College of Experimental Science. The ladies--girls I had\nsupposed them to be--were, in fact, women and mothers, and had reached\nan age that with us would be associated with decrepitude, wrinkles and\nimbecility. They were all practical chemists, and their work was the\npreparation of food from the elements. No wonder that they possessed the\nsuppleness and bloom of eternal youth, when the earthy matter and\nimpurities that are ever present in our food, were unknown to theirs.\n\nI also discovered that they obtained rain artificially when needed, by\ndischarging vast quantities of electricity in the air. I discovered that\nthey kept no cattle, nor animals of any kind for food or labor. I\nobserved a universal practice of outdoor exercising; the aim seeming to\nbe to develop the greatest capacity of lung or muscle. It was\nastonishing the amount of air a Mizora lady could draw into her lungs.\nThey called it their brain stimulant, and said that their faculties were\nmore active after such exercise. In my country, a cup of strong coffee,\nor some other agreeable beverage, is usually taken into the stomach to\ninvigorate or excite the mind.\n\nOne thing I remarked as unusual among a people of such cultured taste,\nand that was the size of the ladies' waists. Of all that I measured not\none was less than thirty inches in circumference, and it was rare to\nmeet with one that small. At first I thought a waist that tapered from\nthe arm pits would be an added beauty, if only these ladies would be\ntaught how to acquire it. But I lived long enough among them to look\nupon a tapering waist as a disgusting deformity. They considered a large\nwaist a mark of beauty, as it gave a greater capacity of lung power; and\nthey laid the greatest stress upon the size and health of the lungs. One\nlittle lady, not above five feet in height, I saw draw into her lungs\ntwo hundred and twenty-five cubic inches of air, and smile proudly when\nshe accomplished it. I measured five feet and five inches in height, and\nwith the greatest effort I could not make my lungs receive more than two\nhundred cubic inches of air. In my own country I had been called an\nunusually robust girl, and knew, by comparison, that I had a much larger\nand fuller chest than the average among women.\n\nI noticed with greater surprise than anything else had excited in me,\nthe marked absence of men. I wandered about the magnificent building\nwithout hindrance or surveillance. There was not a lock or bolt on any\ndoor in it. I frequented a vast gallery filled with paintings and\nstatues of women, noble looking, beautiful women, but still--nothing but\nwomen. The fact that they were all blondes, singular as it might appear,\ndid not so much impress me. Strangers came and went, but among the\nmultitude of faces I met, I never saw a man's.\n\nIn my own country I had been accustomed to regard man as a vital\nnecessity. He occupied all governmental offices, and was the arbitrator\nof domestic life. It seemed, therefore, impossible to me for a country\nor government to survive without his assistance and advice. Besides, it\nwas a country over which the heart of any man must yearn, however\ninsensible he might be to beauty or female loveliness. Wealth was\neverywhere and abundant. The climate as delightful as the most\nfastidious could desire. The products of the orchards and gardens\nsurpassed description. Bread came from the laboratory, and not from the\nsoil by the sweat of the brow. Toil was unknown; the toil that we know,\nmenial, degrading and harassing. Science had been the magician that had\ndone away all that. Science, so formidable and austere to our untutored\nminds, had been gracious to these fair beings and opened the door to\nnature's most occult secrets. The beauty of those women it is not in my\npower to describe. The Greeks, in their highest art, never rivalled it,\nfor here was a beauty of mind that no art can represent. They enhanced\ntheir physical charms with attractive costumes, often of extreme\nelegance. They wore gems that flashed a fortune as they passed. The\nrarest was of a pale rose color, translucent as the clearest water, and\nof a brilliancy exceeding the finest diamond. Their voices, in song,\ncould only be equaled by a celestial choir. No dryad queen ever floated\nthrough the leafy aisles of her forest with more grace than they\ndisplayed in every movement. And all this was for feminine eyes\nalone--and they of the most enchanting loveliness.\n\nAmong all the women that I met during my stay in Mizora--comprising a\nperiod of fifteen years--I saw not one homely face or ungraceful form.\nIn my own land the voice of flattery had whispered in my ear praises of\nface and figure, but I felt ill-formed and uncouth beside the perfect\nsymmetry and grace of these lovely beings. Their chief beauty appeared\nin a mobility of expression. It was the divine fire of Thought that\nillumined every feature, which, while gazing upon the Aphrodite of\nPraxitiles, we must think was all that the matchless marble lacked.\nEmotion passed over their features like ripples over a stream. Their\neyes were limpid wells of loveliness, where every impulse of their\nnatures were betrayed without reserve.\n\n\"It would be a paradise for man.\"\n\nI made this observation to myself, and as secretly would I propound the\nquestion:\n\n\"Why is he not here in lordly possession?\"\n\nIn _my_ world man was regarded, or he had made himself regarded, as a\nsuperior being. He had constituted himself the Government, the Law,\nJudge, Jury and Executioner. He doled out reward or punishment as his\nconscience or judgment dictated. He was active and belligerent always in\nobtaining and keeping every good thing for himself. He was\nindispensable. Yet here was a nation of fair, exceedingly fair women\ndoing without him, and practising the arts and sciences far beyond the\nimagined pale of human knowledge and skill.\n\nOf their progress in science I will give some accounts hereafter.\n\nIt is impossible to describe the feeling that took possession of me as\nmonths rolled by, and I saw the active employments of a prosperous\npeople move smoothly and quietly along in the absence of masculine\nintelligence and wisdom. Cut off from all inquiry by my ignorance of\ntheir language, the singular absence of the male sex began to prey upon\nmy imagination as a mystery. The more so after visiting a town at some\ndistance, composed exclusively of schools and colleges for the youth of\nthe country. Here I saw hundreds of children--_and all of them were\ngirls_. Is it to be wondered at that the first inquiry I made, was:\n\n\"Where are the men?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\n\nTo facilitate my progress in the language of Mizora I was sent to their\nNational College. It was the greatest favor they could have conferred\nupon me, as it opened to me a wide field of knowledge. Their educational\nsystem was a peculiar one, and, as it was the chief interest of the\ncountry. I shall describe it before proceeding farther with this\nnarrative.\n\nAll institutions for instruction were public, as were, also, the books\nand other accessories. The State was the beneficent mother who furnished\neverything, and required of her children only their time and\napplication. Each pupil was compelled to attain a certain degree of\nexcellence that I thought unreasonably high, after which she selected\nthe science or vocation she felt most competent to master, and to that\nshe then devoted herself.\n\nThe salaries of teachers were larger than those of any other public\nposition. The Principal of the National College had an income that\nexceeded any royal one I had ever heard of; but, as education was the\nparamount interest of Mizora, I was not surprised at it. Their desire\nwas to secure the finest talent for educational purposes, and as the\nhighest honors and emoluments belonged to such a position, it could not\nbe otherwise. To be a teacher in Mizora was to be a person of\nconsequence. They were its aristocracy.\n\nEvery State had a free college provided for out of the State funds. In\nthese colleges every department of Science, Art, or Mechanics was\nfurnished with all the facilities for thorough instruction. All the\nexpenses of a pupil, including board, clothing, and the necessary\ntraveling fares, were defrayed by the State. I may here remark that all\nrailroads are owned and controlled by the General Government. The rates\nof transportation were fixed by law, and were uniform throughout the\ncountry.\n\nThe National College which I entered belonged to the General\nGovernment. Here was taught the highest attainments in the arts and\nsciences, and all industries practised in Mizora. It contained the very\ncream of learning. There the scientist, the philosopher and inventor\nfound the means and appliances for study and investigation. There the\nartist and sculptor had their finest work, and often their studios. The\nprincipals and subordinate teachers and assistants were elected by\npopular vote. The State Colleges were free to those of another State who\nmight desire to enter them, for Mizora was like one vast family. It was\nregarded as the duty of every citizen to lend all the aid and\nencouragement in her power to further the enlightenment of others,\nwisely knowing the benefits of such would accrue to her own and the\ngeneral good. The National College was open to all applicants,\nirrespective of age, the only requirements being a previous training to\nenter upon so high a plane of mental culture. Every allurement was held\nout to the people to come and drink at the public fountain where the cup\nwas inviting and the waters sweet. \"For,\" said one of the leading\ninstructors to me, \"education is the foundation of our moral elevation,\nour government, our happiness. Let us relax our efforts, or curtail the\nmeans and inducements to become educated, and we relax into ignorance,\nand end in demoralization. We know the value of free education. It is\nfrequently the case that the greatest minds are of slow development, and\nmanifest in the primary schools no marked ability. They often leave the\nschools unnoticed; and when time has awakened them to their mental\nneeds, all they have to do is to apply to the college, pass an\nexamination, and be admitted. If not prepared to enter the college, they\ncould again attend the common schools. We realize in its broadest sense\nthe ennobling influence of universal education. The higher the culture\nof a people, the more secure is their government and happiness. A\nprosperous people is always an educated one; and the freer the\neducation, the wealthier they become.\"\n\nThe Preceptress of the National College was the leading scientist of the\ncountry. Her position was more exalted than any that wealth could have\ngiven her. In fact, while wealth had acknowledged advantages, it held a\nsubordinate place in the estimation of the people. I never heard the\nexpression \"very wealthy,\" used as a recommendation of a person. It was\nalways: \"_She_ is a fine scholar, or mechanic, or artist, or musician.\n_She_ excels in landscape gardening, or domestic work. _She_ is a\nfirst-class chemist.\" But never \"_She_ is rich.\"\n\nThe idea of a Government assuming the responsibility of education, like\na parent securing the interest of its children, was all so new to me;\nand yet, I confessed to myself, the system might prove beneficial to\nother countries than Mizora. In that world, from whence I had so\nmysteriously emigrated, education was the privilege only of the rich.\nAnd in no country, however enlightened, was there a system of education\nthat would reach all. Charitable institutions were restricted, and\nbenefited only a few. My heart beat with enthusiasm when I thought of\nthe mission before me. And then I reflected that the philosophers of my\nworld were but as children in progress compared to these. Still\ntraveling in grooves that had been worn and fixed for posterity by\nbygone ages of ignorance and narrow-mindedness, it would require courage\nand resolution, and more eloquence than I possessed, to persuade them\nout of these trodden paths. To be considered the privileged class was an\nactive characteristic of human nature. Wealth, and the powerful grip\nupon the people which the organizations of society and governments gave,\nmade it hereditary. Yet in this country, nothing was hereditary but the\nprosperity and happiness of the whole people.\n\nIt was not a surprise to me that astronomy was an unknown science in\nMizora, as neither sun, moon, nor stars were visible there. \"The moon's\npale beams\" never afford material for a blank line in poetry; neither do\nscientific discussions rage on the formation of Saturn's rings, or the\nspots on the sun. They knew they occupied a hollow sphere, bounded North\nand South by impassible oceans. Light was a property of the atmosphere.\nA circle of burning mist shot forth long streamers of light from the\nNorth, and a similar phenomena occurred in the South.\n\nThe recitation of my geography lesson would have astonished a pupil from\nthe outer world. They taught that a powerful current of electricity\nexisted in the upper regions of the atmosphere. It was the origin of\ntheir atmospheric heat and light, and their change of seasons. The\nlatter appeared to me to coincide with those of the Arctic zone, in one\nparticular. The light of the sun during the Arctic summer is reflected\nby the atmosphere, and produces that mellow, golden, rapturous light\nthat hangs like a veil of enchantment over the land of Mizora for six\nmonths in the year. It was followed by six months of the shifting\niridescence of the Aurora Borealis.\n\nAs the display of the Aurora Borealis originated, and was most brilliant\nat what appeared to me to be the terminus of the pole, I believed it was\ncaused by the meeting at that point of the two great electric currents\nof the earth, the one on its surface, and the one known to the\ninhabitants of Mizora. The heat produced by the meeting of two such\npowerful currents of electricity is, undoubtedly, the cause of the open\nPolar Sea. As the point of meeting is below the vision of the\ninhabitants of the Arctic regions, they see only the reflection of the\nAurora. Its gorgeous, brilliant, indescribable splendor is known only to\nthe inhabitants of Mizora.\n\nAt the National College, where it is taught as a regular science, I\nwitnessed the chemical production of bread and a preparation resembling\nmeat. Agriculture in this wonderful land, was a lost art. No one that I\nquestioned had any knowledge of it. It had vanished in the dim past of\ntheir barbarism. With the exception of vegetables and fruit, which were\nraised in luscious perfection, their food came from the elements. A\nfamine among such enlightened people was impossible, and scarcity was\nunknown. Food for the body and food for the mind were without price. It\nwas owing to this that poverty was unknown to them, as well as disease.\nThe absolute purity of all that they ate preserved an activity of vital\npower long exceeding our span of life. The length of their year,\nmeasured by the two seasons, was the same as ours, but the women who had\nmarked a hundred of them in their lifetime, looked younger and fresher,\nand were more supple of limb than myself, yet I had barely passed my\ntwenty-second year.\n\nI wrote out a careful description of the processes by which they\nconverted food out of the valueless elements--valueless because of their\nabundance--and put it carefully away for use in my own country. There\ndrouth, or excessive rainfalls, produced scarcity, and sometimes famine.\nThe struggle of the poor was for food, to the exclusion of all other\ninterests. Many of them knew not what proper and health-giving\nnourishment was. But here in Mizora, the daintiest morsels came from the\nchemists laboratory, cheap as the earth under her feet.\n\nI now began to enjoy the advantages of conversation, which added greatly\nto my happiness and acquirements. I formed an intimate companionship\nwith the daughter of the Preceptress of the National College, and to her\nwas addressed the questions I asked about things that impressed me. She\nwas one of the most beautiful beings that it had been my lot to behold.\nHer eyes were dark, almost the purplish blue of a pansy, and her hair\nhad a darker tinge than is common in Mizora, as if it had stolen the\ngolden edge of a ripe chestnut. Her beauty was a constant charm to me.\n\nThe National College contained a large and well filled gallery. Its\npictures and statuary were varied, not confined to historical portraits\nand busts as was the one at the College of Experimental Science. Yet it\npossessed a number of portraits of women exclusively of the blonde type.\nMany of them were ideal in loveliness. This gallery also contained the\nmasterpieces of their most celebrated sculptors. They were all studies\nof the female form. I am a connoisseur in art, and nothing that I had\never seen before could compare with these matchless marbles, bewitching\nin every delicate contour, alluring in softness, but grand and majestic\nin pose and expression.\n\nBut I haunted this gallery for other reasons than its artistic\nattractions. I was searching for the portrait of a man, or something\nsuggesting his presence. I searched in vain. Many of the paintings were\non a peculiar transparent substance that gave to the subject a\nstartlingly vivid effect. I afterward learned that they were\nimperishable, the material being a translucent adamant of their own\nmanufacture. After a picture was painted upon it, another piece of\nadamant was cemented over it.\n\nEach day, as my acquaintance with the peculiar institutions and\ncharacter of the inhabitants of Mizora increased, my perplexity and a\ncertain air of mystery about them increased with it. It was impossible\nfor me not to feel for them a high degree of respect, admiration, and\naffection. They were ever gentle, tender, and kind to solicitude. To\naccuse them of mystery were a paradox; and yet they _were_ a mystery. In\nconversation, manners and habits, they were frank to singularity. It was\njust as common an occurrence for a poem to be read and commented on by\nits author, as to hear it done by another. I have heard a poetess call\nattention to the beauties of her own production, and receive praise or\nadverse criticism with the same charming urbanity.\n\nAmbition of the most intense earnestness was a natural characteristic,\nbut was guided by a stern and inflexible justice. Envy and malice were\nunknown to them. It was, doubtless, owing to their elevated moral\ncharacter that courts and legal proceedings had become unnecessary. If a\ndiscussion arose between parties involving a question of law, they\nrepaired to the Public Library, where the statute books were kept, and\nlooked up the matter themselves, and settled it as the law directed.\nShould they fail to interpret the law alike, a third party was selected\nas referee, but accepted no pay.\n\nIndolence was as much a disgrace to them as is the lack of virtue to the\nwomen of my country, hence every citizen, no matter how wealthy, had\nsome regular trade, business or profession. I found those occupations we\nare accustomed to see accepted by the people of inferior birth and\nbreeding, were there filled by women of the highest social rank, refined\nin manner and frequently of notable intellectual acquirements. It grew,\nor was the result of the custom of selecting whatever vocation they felt\nthemselves competent to most worthily fill, and as no social favor or\nignominy rested on any kind of labor, the whole community of Mizora was\none immense family of sisters who knew no distinction of birth or\nposition among themselves.\n\nThere were no paupers and no charities, either public or private, to be\nfound in the country. The absence of poverty such as I knew existed in\nall civilized nations upon the face of the earth, was largely owing to\nthe cheapness of food. But there was one other consideration that bore\nvitally upon it. The dignity and necessity of labor was early and\ndiligently impressed upon the mind. The Preceptress said to me:\n\n\"Mizora is a land of industry. Nature has taught us the duty of work.\nHad some of us been born with minds fully matured, or did knowledge come\nto some as old age comes to all, we might think that a portion was\nintended to live without effort. But we are all born equal, and labor is\nassigned to all; and the one who seeks labor is wiser than the one who\nlets labor seek her.\"\n\nCitizens, I learned, were not restrained from accumulating vast wealth\nhad they the desire and ability to do so, but custom imposed upon them\nthe most honorable processes. If a citizen should be found guilty of\nquestionable business transactions, she suffered banishment to a lonely\nisland and the confiscation of her entire estate, both hereditary and\nacquired. The property confiscated went to the public schools in the\ntown or city where she resided; but never was permitted to augment\nsalaries. I discovered this in the statute books, but not in the memory\nof any one living had it been found necessary to inflict such a\npunishment.\n\n\"Our laws,\" said Wauna, \"are simply established legal advice. No law can\nbe so constructed as to fit every case so exactly that a criminal mind\ncould not warp it into a dishonest use. But in a country like ours,\nwhere civilization has reached that state of enlightenment that needs no\nlaws, we are simply guided by custom.\"\n\nThe love of splendor and ornament was a pronounced characteristic of\nthese strange people. But where gorgeous colors were used, they were\nalways of rich quality. The humblest homes were exquisitely ornamented,\nand often displayed a luxury that, with us, would have been considered\nan evidence of wealth.\n\nThey took the greatest delight in their beauty, and were exceedingly\ncareful of it. A lovely face and delicate complexion, they averred,\nadded to one's refinement. The art of applying an artificial bloom and\nfairness to the skin, which I had often seen practiced in my own\ncountry, appeared to be unknown to them. But everything savoring of\ndeception was universally condemned. They made no concealment of the\npractice they resorted to for preserving their complexions, and so\nuniversal and effectual were they, that women who, I was informed, had\npassed the age allotted to the grandmothers in my country, had the\nsmooth brow and pink bloom of cheek that belongs to a more youthful\nperiod of life. There was, however, a distinction between youth and old\nage. The hair was permitted to whiten, but the delicate complexion of\nold age, with its exquisite coloring, excited in my mind as much\nadmiration as astonishment.\n\nI cannot explain why I hesitated to press my first inquiry as to where\nthe men were. I had put the question to Wauna one day, but she professed\nnever to have heard of such beings. It silenced me--for a time.\n\n\"Perhaps it is some extinct animal,\" she added, naively. \"We have so\nmany new things to study and investigate, that we pay but little\nattention to ancient history.\"\n\nI bided my time and put the query in another form.\n\n\"Where is your other parent?\"\n\nShe regarded me with innocent surprise. \"You talk strangely. I have but\none parent. How could I have any more?\"\n\n\"You ought to have two.\"\n\nShe laughed merrily. \"You have a queer way of jesting. I have but one\nmother, one adorable mother. How could I have two?\" and she laughed\nagain.\n\nI saw that there was some mystery I could not unravel at present, and\nfearing to involve myself in some trouble, refrained from further\nquestioning on the subject. I nevertheless kept a close observance of\nall that passed, and seized every opportunity to investigate a mystery\nthat began to harass me with its strangeness.\n\nSoon after my conversation with Wauna, I attended an entertainment at\nwhich a great number of guests were present. It was a literary festival\nand, after the intellectual delicacies were disposed of, a banquet\nfollowed of more than royal munificence. Toasts were drank, succeeded by\nmusic and dancing and all the gayeties of a festive occasion, yet none\nbut the fairest of fair women graced the scene. Is it strange,\ntherefore, that I should have regarded with increasing astonishment and\nuneasiness a country in all respects alluring to the desires of man--yet\nfound him not there in lordly possession?\n\nBeauty and intellect, wealth and industry, splendor and careful economy,\nnatures lofty and generous, gentle and loving--why has not Man claimed\nthis for himself?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\n\nThe Preceptress of the National College appointed her daughter Wanna as\na guide and instructor to me. I formed a deep and strong attachment for\nher, which, it pains me to remember, was the cause of her unhappy fate.\nIn stature she was above the medium height, with a form of the fairest\nearthly loveliness and exquisite grace. Her eyes were so deep a blue,\nthat at first I mistook them for brown. Her hair was the color of a ripe\nchestnut frosted with gold, and in length and abundance would cover her\nlike a garment. She was vivacious and fond of athletic sports. Her\nstrength amazed me. Those beautiful hands, with their tapering fingers,\nhad a grip like a vise. They had discovered, in this wonderful land,\nthat a body possessing perfectly developed muscles must, by the laws of\nnature, be symmetrical and graceful. They rode a great deal on small,\ntwo-wheeled vehicles, which they propelled themselves. They gave me one\non which I accompanied Wauna to all of the places of interest in the\nCapital city and vicinity.\n\nI must mention that Wauna's voice was exceedingly musical, even in that\nland of sweet voices, but she did not excel as a singer.\n\nThe infant schools interested me more than all the magnificence and\ngrandeur of the college buildings. The quaint courtesy, gentle manners\nand affectionate demeanor of the little ones toward one another, was a\nsurprise to me. I had visited infant schools of my own and other\ncountries, where I had witnessed the display of human nature,\nunrestrained by mature discretion and policy. Fights, quarrels, kicks,\nscreams, the unlawful seizure of toys and trinkets, and other\nmisdemeanors, were generally the principal exhibits. But here it was all\ndifferent. I thought, as I looked at them, that should a philanthropist\nfrom the outside world have chanced unknowingly upon the playground of a\nMizora infant school, he would have believed himself in a company of\nlittle angels.\n\nAt first, a kindness so universal impressed me as studied; a species of\nrefined courtesy in which the children were drilled. But time and\nobservation proved to me that it was the natural impulse of the heart,\nan inherited trait of moral culture. In _my_ world, kindness and\naffection were family possessions, extended occasionally to\nacquaintances. Beyond this was courtesy only for the great busy bustling\nmass of humanity called--\"the world.\"\n\nIt must not be understood that there was no variety of character in\nMizora. Just as marked a difference was to be found there as elsewhere;\nbut it was elevated and ennobled. Its evil tendencies had been\neliminated. There were many causes that had made this possible. The\nfirst, and probably the most influential, was the extreme cheapness of\nliving. Food and fuel were items of so small consequence, that poverty\nhad become unknown. Added to this, and to me by far the most vital\nreason, was their system of free education. In contemplating the state\nof enlightenment to which Mizora had attained, I became an enthusiast\nupon the subject of education, and resolved, should I ever again reach\nthe upper world, to devote all my energies and ability to convincing the\ngovernments of its importance. I believe it is the duty of every\ngovernment to make its schools and colleges, and everything appertaining\nto education--FREE. To be always starved for knowledge is a more pitiful\ncraving than to hunger for bread. One dwarfs the body; the other the\nmind.\n\nThe utmost care was bestowed upon the training and education of the\nchildren. There was nothing that I met with in that beautiful and happy\ncountry I longed more to bring with me to the inhabitants of my world,\nthan their manner of rearing children. The most scrupulous attention was\npaid to their diet and exercise, both mental and physical. The result\nwas plump limbs, healthy, happy faces and joyous spirits. In all the\nfifteen years that I spent in Mizora, I never saw a tear of sorrow fall\nfrom children's eyes. Admirable sanitary regulations exist in all the\ncities and villages of the land, which insures them pure air. I may\nstate here that every private-house looks as carefully to the condition\nof its atmosphere, as we do to the material neatness of ours.\n\nThe only intense feeling that I could discover among these people was\nthe love between parent and child. I visited the theater where the\ntragedy of the play was the destruction of a daughter by shipwreck in\nview of the distracted mother. The scenery was managed with wonderful\nrealism. The thunder of the surf as it beat upon the shore, the\nfrightful carnival of wind and waves that no human power could still,\nand the agony of the mother watching the vessel break to pieces upon the\nrock and her child sink into the boiling water to rise no more, was\nthrilling beyond my power to describe. I lost control of my feelings.\nThe audience wept and applauded; and when the curtain fell, I could\nscarcely believe it had only been a play. The love of Mizora women for\ntheir children is strong and deep. They consider the care of them a\nsacred duty, fraught with the noblest results of life. A daughter of\nscholarly attainments and noble character is a credit to her mother.\nThat selfish mother who looks upon her children as so many afflictions\nis unknown to Mizora. If a mother should ever feel her children as\nburdens upon her, she would never give it expression, as any dereliction\nof duty would be severely rebuked by the whole community, if not\npunished by banishment. Corporal punishment was unknown.\n\nI received an invitation from a lady prominent in literature and science\nto make her a visit. I accepted with gratification, as it would afford\nme the opportunity I coveted to become acquainted with the domestic life\nof Mizora, and perhaps penetrate its greatest mystery, for I must\nconfess that the singular dearth of anything and everything resembling\nMan, never ceased to prey upon my curiosity.\n\nThe lady was the editor and proprietor of the largest and most widely\nknown scientific and literary magazine in the country. She was the\nmother of eight children, and possessed one of the largest fortunes and\nmost magnificent residences in the country.\n\nThe house stood on an elevation, and was a magnificent structure of grey\ngranite, with polished cornices. The porch floors were of clouded\nmarble. The pillars supporting its roof were round shafts of the same\nmaterial, with vines of ivy, grape and rose winding about them, carved\nand colored into perfect representations of the natural shrubs.\n\nThe drawing-room, which was vast and imposing in size and appearance,\nhad a floor of pure white marble. The mantels and window-sills were of\nwhite onyx, with delicate vinings of pink and green. The floor was\nstrewn with richly colored mats and rugs. Luxurious sofas and chairs\ncomprised the only furniture. Each corner contained a piece of fine\nstatuary. From the centre of the ceiling depended a large gold basin of\nbeautiful design and workmanship, in which played a miniature fountain\nof perfumed water that filled the air with a delicate fragrance. The\nwalls were divided into panels of polished and unpolished granite. On\nthe unpolished panels hung paintings of scenery. The dull, gray color of\nthe walls brought out in sharp and tasteful relief the few costly and\nelegant adornments of the room: a placid landscape with mountains dimly\noutlining the distance. A water scene with a boat idly drifting,\noccupied by a solitary figure watching the play of variegated lights\nupon the tranquil waters. Then came a wild and rugged mountain scene\nwith precipices and a foaming torrent. Then a concert of birds amusingly\ntreated.\n\nThe onyx marble mantel-piece contained but a single ornament--an\norchestra. A coral vase contained a large and perfect tiger lily, made\nof gold. Each stamen supported a tiny figure carved out of ivory,\nholding a musical instrument. When they played, each figure appeared\ninstinct with life, like the mythical fairies of my childhood; and the\nmusic was so sweet, yet faint, that I readily imagined the charmed ring\nand tiny dancers keeping time to its rhythm.\n\nThe drawing-room presented a vista of arches draped in curtains of a\nrare texture, though I afterward learned they were spun glass. The one\nthat draped the entrance to the conservatory looked like sea foam with\nthe faint blush of day shining through it. The conservatory was in the\nshape of a half sphere, and entirely of glass. From its dome, more than\na hundred feet above our heads, hung a globe of white fire that gave\nforth a soft clear light. Terminating, as it did, the long vista of\narches with their transparent hangings of cobweb texture, it presented a\npicture of magnificence and beauty indescribably.\n\nThe other apartments displayed the same taste and luxury. The\nsitting-room contained an instrument resembling a grand piano.\n\nThe grounds surrounding this elegant home were adorned with natural and\nartificial beauties, Grottoes, fountains, lakes, cascades, terraces of\nflowers, statuary, arbors and foliage in endless variety, that rendered\nit a miniature paradise. In these grounds, darting in and out among the\navenues, playing hide-and-seek behind the statuary, or otherwise amusing\nthemselves, I met eight lovely children, ranging from infancy to young\nmaidenhood. The glowing cheeks and eyes, and supple limbs spoke of\nperfect health and happiness. When they saw their mother coming, they\nran to meet her, the oldest carrying the two-year old baby. The stately\nwoman greeted each with a loving kiss. She showed in loving glance and\naction how dear they all were to her. For the time being she unbent,\nand became a child herself in the interest she took in their prattle and\nmirth. A true mother and happy children.\n\nI discovered that each department of this handsome home was under the\ncare of a professional artist. I remarked to my hostess that I had\nsupposed her home was the expression of her own taste.\n\n\"So it is,\" she replied; \"but it requires an equally well educated taste\nto carry out my designs. The arrangement and ornamentation of my grounds\nwere suggested by me, and planned and executed by my landscape artist.\"\n\nAfter supper we repaired to the general sitting-room. The eldest\ndaughter had been deeply absorbed in a book before we came in. She\nclosed and left it upon a table. I watched for an opportunity to\ncarelessly pick it up and examine it. It was a novel I felt sure, for\nshe appeared to resign it reluctantly out of courtesy to her guest. I\nmight, from it, gather some clue to the mystery of the male sex. I took\nup the book and opened it. It was The Conservation of Force and The\nPhenomena of Nature. I laid it down with a sigh of discomfiture.\n\nThe next evening, my hostess gave a small entertainment, and what was my\namazement, not to say offense, to perceive the cook, the chamber-maid,\nand in fact all the servants in the establishment, enter and join in the\nconversation and amusement. The cook was asked to sing, for, with the\nexception of myself--and I tried to conceal it--no one appeared to take\numbrage at her presence. She sat down to the piano and sang a pretty\nballad in a charming manner. Her voice was cultivated and musical, as\nare all the voices in Mizora, but it was lacking in the qualities that\nmake a great singer, yet it had a plaintive sweetness that was very\nattractive.\n\nI was dumbfounded at her presumption. In my country such a thing is\nunknown as a servant entertaining guests in such a capacity, and\nespecially among people of my rank and position in the world.\n\nI repelled some advances she made me with a hauteur and coldness that it\nmortified me afterward to remember. Instead of being _my_ inferior, I\nwas her's, and she knew it; but neither by look, tone nor action did she\nbetray her consciousness of it. I had to acknowledge that her hands were\nmore delicately modeled than mine, and her bearing had a dignity and\nelegance that might have been envied by the most aristocratic dame of my\nown land. Knowing that the Mizora people were peculiar in their social\nideas, I essayed to repress my indignation at the time, but later I\nunburdened myself to Wauna who, with her usual sweetness and\ngentleness, explained to me that her occupation was a mere matter of\nchoice with her.\n\n\"She is one of the most distinguished chemists of this nation. She\nsolved the problem of making bread out of limestone of a much finer\nquality than had been in use before.\"\n\n\"Don't tell me that you gave me a stone when I asked for bread!\" I\nexclaimed.\n\n\"We have not done that,\" replied Wauna; \"but we have given you what you\ntook for bread, but which is manufactured out of limestone and the\nrefuse of the marble quarries.\"\n\nI looked at her in such inane astonishment that she hastened to add:\n\n\"I will take you to one of the large factories some day. They are always\nin the mountains where the stone is abundant. You can there see loaves\nby the thousands packed in great glass tanks for shipment to the\ndifferent markets. And they do not cost the manufacturer above one\ncentime per hundred.\"\n\n\"And what royalty does the discoverer get for this wonder of chemistry?\"\n\n\"None. Whenever anything of that kind is discovered in our country, it\nis purchased outright by the government, and then made public for the\nbenefit of all. The competition among manufacturers consists in the care\nand exactness with which they combine the necessary elements. There is\nquite a difference in the taste and quality of our bread as it comes\nfrom different factories.\"\n\n\"Why doesn't such a talented person quit working in another woman's\nkitchen and keep herself like a lady?\" I inquired, all the prejudice of\nindolent wealth against labor coming up in my thoughts.\n\n\"She has a taste for that kind of work,\" replied Wauna, \"instead of for\nmaking dresses, or carving gems, or painting. She often says she could\nnot make a straight line if she tried, yet she can put together with\nsuch nicety and chemical skill the elements that form an omelette or a\ncustard, that she has become famous. She teaches all who desire to\nlearn, but none seem to equal her. She was born with a genius for\ncooking and nothing else. Haven't you seen her with a long glass tube\ntesting the vessels of vegetables and fruit that were cooking?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I answered. \"It was from that that I supposed her occupation\nmenial.\"\n\n\"Visitors from other cities,\" continued Wauna, \"nearly always inquire\nfor her first.\"\n\nPerceiving the mistake that I had made, I ventured an apology for my\nbehavior toward her, and Wauna replied, with a frankness that nearly\ncrushed me:\n\n\"We all noticed it, but do not fear a retaliation,\" she added sweetly.\n\"We know that you are from a civilization that we look back upon as one\nof barbarism.\"\n\nI acknowledged that if any superciliousness existed in Mizora while I\nwas there, I must have had it.\n\nThe guests departed without refreshments having been served. I explained\nthe custom of entertainment in my country, which elicited expressions of\nastonishment. It would be insulting to offer refreshments of any kind to\na guest between the regular hours for dining, as it would imply a desire\non your part to impair their health. Such was the explanation of what in\nmy country would be deemed a gross neglect of duty. Their custom was\nprobably the result of two causes: an enlightened knowledge of the laws\nof health, and the extreme cheapness of all luxuries of the table which\nthe skill of the chemist had made available to every class of people in\nthe land.\n\nThe word \"servant\" did not exist in the language of Mizora; neither had\nthey an equivalent for it in the sense in which we understand and use\nthe word. I could not tell a servant--for I must use the word to be\nunderstood--from a professor in the National College. They were all\nhighly-educated, refined, lady-like and lovely. Their occupations were\nalways matters of choice, for, as there was nothing in them to detract\nfrom their social position, they selected the one they knew they had the\nability to fill. Hence those positions _we_ are accustomed to regard as\nmenial, were there filled by ladies of the highest culture and\nrefinement; consequently the domestic duties of a Mizora household moved\nto their accomplishment with the ease and regularity of fine machinery.\n\nIt was long before I could comprehend the dignity they attached to the\nhumblest vocations. They had one proverb that embraced it all: \"Labor is\nthe necessity of life.\" I studied this peculiar phase of Mizora life,\nand at last comprehended that in this very law of social equality lay\nthe foundation of their superiority. Their admirable system of adapting\nthe mind to the vocation in which it was most capable of excelling, and\nendowing that with dignity and respect, and, at the same time,\ncompelling the highest mental culture possible, had produced a nation\nin the enjoyment of universal refinement, and a higher order of\nintelligence than any yet known to the outside world.\n\nThe standard of an ordinary education was to me astonishingly high. The\nreason for it was easily understood when informed that the only\naristocracy of the country was that of intellect. Scholars, artists,\nscientists, literateurs, all those excelling in intellectual gifts or\nattainments, were alone regarded as superiors by the masses.\n\nIn all the houses that I had visited I had never seen a portrait hung in\na room thrown open to visitors. On inquiry, I was informed that it was a\nlack of taste to make a portrait conspicuous.\n\n\"You meet faces at all times,\" said my informant, \"but you cannot at all\ntimes have a variety of scenery before you. How monotonous it would be\nwith a drawing-room full of women, and the walls filled with their\npainted representatives. We never do it.\"\n\n\"Then where do you keep your family portraits?\"\n\n\"Ours is in a gallery upstairs.\"\n\nI requested to be shown this, and was conducted to a very long apartment\non the third floor, devoted exclusively to relics and portraits of\nfamily ancestry. There were over three thousand portraits of blond\nwomen, which my hostess' daughter informed me represented her\ngrandmothers for ages back. Not one word did she say about her\ngrandfathers.\n\nI may mention here that no word existed in their dictionaries that was\nequivalent to the word \"man.\" I had made myself acquainted with this\nfact as soon as I had acquired sufficient knowledge of their language.\nMy astonishment at it cannot be described. It was a mystery that became\nmore and more perplexing. Never in the closest intimacy that I could\nsecure could I obtain the slightest clue, the least suggestion relating\nto the presence of man. My friend's infant, scarcely two years old,\nprattled of everything but a father.\n\nI cannot explain a certain impressive dignity about the women of Mizora\nthat, in spite of their amiability and winning gentleness, forbade a\nclose questioning into private affairs. My hostess never spoke of her\nbusiness. It would have been a breach of etiquette to have questioned\nher about it. I could not bring myself to intrude the question of the\nmarked absence of men, when not the slightest allusion was ever made to\nthem by any citizen.\n\nSo time passed on, confirming my high opinion of them, and yet I knew\nand felt and believed that some strange and incomprehensible mystery\nsurrounded them, and when I had abandoned all hope of a solution to it,\nit solved itself in the most unexpected and yet natural manner, and I\nwas more astonished at the solution than I was at the mystery.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\n\nTheir domestic life was so harmonious and perfect that it was a\nperpetual pleasure to contemplate.\n\nHuman nature finds its sweetest pleasure, its happiest content, within\nits own home circle; and in Mizora I found no exception to the rule. The\narrangement and adornment of every house in Mizora were evidently for\nthe comfort and happiness of its inmates. To purchase anything for\nmerely outside show, or to excite the envy or jealousy of a neighbor,\nwas never thought of by an inhabitant of Mizora.\n\nThe houses that were built to rent excited my admiration quite as much\nas did the private residences. They all seemed to have been designed\nwith two special objects in view--beauty and comfort. Houses built to\nrent in large cities were always in the form of a hollow square,\ninclosing a commodious and handsomely decorated park. The back was\nadorned with an upper and lower piazza opening upon the park. The suites\nof rooms were so arranged as to exclusively separate their occupants\nfrom all others. The park was undivided. The center was occupied by a\nfountain large enough to shoot its spray as high as the uppermost\npiazza. The park was furnished with rustic seats and shade trees,\nfrequently of immense size, branched above its smooth walks and\npromenades, where baby wagons, velocipedes and hobby horses on wheels\ncould have uninterrupted sport.\n\nSuburban residences, designed for rent, were on a similar but more\namplified plan. The houses were detached, but the grounds were in\ncommon. Many private residences were also constructed on the same plan.\nFive or six acres would be purchased by a dozen families who were not\nrich enough to own large places separately. A separate residence would\nbe built for each family, but the ground would be laid off and\nornamented like a private park. Each of the dozen families would thus\nhave a beautiful view and the privilege of the whole ground. In this\nway, cascades, fountains, rustic arbors, rockeries, aquariums, tiny\nlakes, and every variety of landscape ornamenting, could be supplied at\na comparatively small cost to each family.\n\nShould any one wish to sell, they disposed of their house and\none-twelfth of the undivided ground, and a certain per cent. of the\nvalue of its ornaments. The established custom was never to remove or\nalter property thus purchased without the consent of the other\nshareholders. Where a people had been educated to regard justice and\nconscience as their law, such an arrangement could be beneficial to an\nentire city.\n\nFinancial ability does not belong to every one, and this plan of uniting\nsmall capitals gave opportunity to the less wealthy classes to enjoy all\nthe luxuries that belong to the rich. In fact some of the handsomest\nparks I saw in Mizora were owned and kept up in this manner. Sometimes\nas many as twenty families united in the purchase of an estate, and\nconstructed artificial lakes large enough to sail upon. Artificial\ncascades and fountains of wonderful size and beauty were common\nornaments in all the private and public parks of the city. I noticed in\nall the cities that I visited the beauty and charm of the public parks,\nwhich were found in all sections.\n\nThe walks were smoothly paved and shaded by trees of enormous size. They\nwere always frequented by children, who could romp and play in these\nsylvan retreats of beauty in perfect security.\n\nThe high state of culture arrived at by the Mizora people rendered a\nluxurious style of living a necessity to all. Many things that I had\nbeen brought up to regard as the exclusive privileges of the rich, were\nhere the common pleasure of every one. There was no distinction of\nclasses; no genteel-poverty people, who denied themselves necessities\nthat they might appear to have luxuries. There was not a home in Mizora\nthat I entered--and I had access to many--that did not give the\nimpression of wealth in all its appointments.\n\nI asked the Preceptress to explain to me how I might carry back to the\npeople of my country this social happiness, this equality of physical\ncomfort and luxury; and she answered me with emphasis:\n\n\"Educate them. Convince the rich that by educating the poor, they are\nproviding for their own safety. They will have fewer prisons to build,\nfewer courts to sustain. Educated Labor will work out its own salvation\nagainst Capital. Let the children of toil start in life with exactly\nthe same educational advantages that are enjoyed by the rich. Give them\nthe same physical and moral training, and let the rich pay for it by\ntaxes.\"\n\nI shook my head \"They will never submit to it,\" was my reluctant\nadmission.\n\n\"Appeal to their selfishness,\" urged the Preceptress \"Get them to open\ntheir college doors and ask all to come and be taught without money and\nwithout price. The power of capital is great, but stinted and ignorant\ntoil will rise against its oppression, and innocence and guilt will\nalike suffer from its fury. Have you never known such an occurrence?\"\n\n\"Not in my day or country,\" I answered \"But the city in which I was\neducated has such a history. Its gutters flowed with human blood, the\nblood of its nobles.\"\n\nShe inclined her head significantly. \"It will be repeated,\" she said\nsadly, \"unless you educate them. Give their bright and active minds the\npower of knowledge. They will use it wisely, for their own and their\ncountry's welfare.\"\n\nI doubted my ability to do this, to contend against rooted and inherited\nprejudice, but I resolved to try. I did not need to be told that the\nrich and powerful had a monopoly of intellect: Nature was not partial to\nthem, for the children of the poor, I well knew, were often handsomer\nand more intellectual than the offspring of wealth and aristocratic\nbirth.\n\nI have before spoken of the positions occupied by those who performed\nwhat I had been bred to regard as menial work. At first, the mere fact\nof the person who presided over the kitchen being presented to me as an\nequal, was outraging to all my hereditary dignity and pride of birth. No\none could be more pronounced in a consciousness of inherited nobility\nthan I. I had been taught from infancy to regard myself as a superior\nbeing, merely because the accident of birth had made me so, and the\narrogance with which I had treated some of my less favored schoolmates\nreverted to me with mortifying regret, when, having asked Wauna to point\nout to me the nobly born, she looked at me with her sweet expression of\ncandor and innocence and said:\n\n\"We have no nobility of birth. As I once before told you, intellect is\nour only standard of excellence. It alone occupies an exalted place and\nreceives the homage of our people.\"\n\nIn a subsequent conversation with her mother, the Preceptress, she said:\n\n\"In remote ages, great honor and deference was paid to all who were\nborn of rulers, and the designation 'noble blood,' was applied to them.\nAt one time in the history of our country they could commit any outrage\nupon society or morals without fear of punishment, simply because they\nbelonged to the aristocracy. Even a heinous murder would be unnoticed if\nperpetrated by one of them. Nature alone did not favor them Imbecile and\nimmoral minds fell to the lot of the aristocrat as often as to the lowly\nborn. Nature's laws are inflexible and swerve not for any human wish.\nThey outraged them by the admixture of kindred blood, and degeneracy was\noften the result. A people should always have for their chief ruler the\nhighest and noblest intellect among them, but in those dark ages they\nwere too often compelled to submit to the lowest, simply because it had\nbeen _born_ to the position. But,\" she added, with a sweet smile,\n\"_that_ time lies many centuries behind us, and I sometimes think we had\nbetter forget it entirely.\"\n\nMy first meeting with the domestics of my friend's house impressed me\nwith their high mental culture, refinement and elegance. Certainly no\n\"grande dame\" of my own country but would have been proud of their\nbeauty and graceful dignity.\n\nPrejudice, however deeply ingrained, could not resist the custom of a\nwhole country, and especially such a one as Mizora, so I soon found\nmyself on a familiar footing with my friend's \"artist\"--for the name by\nwhich they were designated as a class had very nearly the same meaning.\n\nCooking was an art, and one which the people of Mizora had cultivated to\nthe highest excellence. It is not strange, when their enlightenment is\nunderstood, that they should attach as much honor to it as the people of\nmy country do to sculpture, painting and literature. The Preceptress\ntold me that such would be the case with my people when education became\nuniversal and the poor could start in life with the same intellectual\nculture as the rich. The chemistry of food and its importance in\npreserving a youthful vigor and preventing disease, would then be\nunderstood and appreciated by all classes, and would receive the\ndeference it deserved.\n\n\"You will never realize,\" said the Preceptress earnestly, \"the\nincalculable benefit that will accrue to your people from educating your\npoor. Urge that Government to try it for just twenty years, long enough\nfor a generation to be born and mature. The bright and eager intellects\nof poverty will turn to Chemistry to solve the problems of cheap Light,\ncheap Fuel and cheap Food. When you can clothe yourselves from the\nfibre of the trees, and warm and light your dwellings from the water of\nyour rivers, and eat of the stones of the earth, Poverty and Disease\nwill be as unknown to your people as it is to mine.\"\n\n\"If I should preach that to them, they would call me a maniac.\"\n\n\"None but the ignorant will do so. From your description of the great\nthinkers of your country, I am inclined to believe there are minds among\nyou advanced enough to believe in it.\"\n\nI remembered how steamboats and railroads and telegraphy had been\nopposed and ridiculed until proven practicable, and I took courage and\nresolved to follow the advice of my wise counselor.\n\nI had long felt a curiosity to behold the inner workings of a domestic's\nlife, and one day ventured to ask my friend's permission to enter her\nkitchen. Surprise was manifested at such a request, when I began to\napologize and explain. But my hostess smiled and said:\n\n\"My kitchen is at all times as free to my guests as my drawing room.\"\n\nEvery kitchen in Mizora is on the same plan and conducted the same way.\nTo describe one, therefore, is to describe all. I undertook to explain\nthat in my country, good breeding forbade a guest entering the host's\nkitchen, and frequently its appearance, and that of the cook's, would\nnot conduce to gastric enjoyment of the edibles prepared in it.\n\nMy first visit happened to be on scrubbing day, and I was greatly amused\nto see a little machine, with brushes and sponges attached, going over\nthe floor at a swift rate, scouring and sponging dry as it went. Two\nvessels, one containing soap suds and the other clear water, were\nconnected by small feed pipes with the brushes. As soon as the drying\nsponge became saturated, it was lifted by an ingenious yet simple\ncontrivance into a vessel and pressed dry, and was again dropped to the\nfloor.\n\nI inquired how it was turned to reverse its progress so as to clean the\nwhole floor, and was told to watch when it struck the wall. I did so,\nand saw that the jar not only reversed the machine, but caused it to\nspring to the right about two feet, which was its width, and again begin\nwork on a new line, to be again reversed in the same manner when it\nstruck the opposite wall. Carpeted floors were swept by a similar\ncontrivance.\n\nNo wonder the \"artists\" of the kitchen had such a dainty appearance.\nThey dipped their pretty hands in perfumed water and dried them on the\nfinest and whitest damask, while machinery did the coarse work.\n\nMizora, I discovered, was a land of brain workers. In every vocation of\nlife machinery was called upon to perform the arduous physical labor.\nThe whole domestic department was a marvel of ingenious mechanical\ncontrivances. Dishwashing, scouring and cleaning of every description\nwere done by machinery.\n\nThe Preceptress told me that it was the result of enlightenment, and it\nwould become the custom in my country to make machinery perform the\nlaborious work when they learned the value of universal and advanced\nknowledge.\n\nI observed that the most exact care was given to the preparation of\nfood. Every cook was required to be a chemist of the highest excellence;\nanother thing that struck me as radically different from the custom in\nvogue in my country.\n\nEverything was cooked by hot air and under cover, so that no odor was\nperceptible in the room. Ventilating pipes conveyed the steam from\ncooking food out of doors. Vegetables and fruits appeared to acquire a\nricher flavor when thus cooked. The seasoning was done by exact weight\nand measure, and there was no stirring or tasting. A glass tube, on the\nprinciple of a thermometer, determined when each article was done. The\nperfection which they had attained as culinary chemists was a source of\nmuch gratification to me, both in the taste of food so delicious and\npalatable, and in its wholesome effect on my constitution. As to its\ndeliciousness, a meal prepared by a Mizora cook could rival the fabled\nfeasts of the gods. Its beneficial effects upon me were manifested in a\nhealthier tone of body and an an increase of animal spirits, a\npleasurable feeling of content and amiability.\n\nThe Preceptress told me that the first step toward the eradication of\ndisease was in the scientific preparation of food, and the establishment\nof schools where cooking was taught as an art to all who applied, and\nwithout charge. Placed upon a scientific basis it became respectable.\n\n\"To eliminate from our food the deleterious earthy matter is our\nconstant aim. To that alone do we owe immunity from old age far in\nadvance of that period of life when your people become decrepit and\nsenile. The human body is like a lamp-wick, which filters the oil while\nit furnishes light. In time the wick becomes clogged and useless and is\nthrown away. If the oil could be made perfectly pure, the wick would not\nfill up.\"\n\nShe gave this homely explanation with a smile and the air of a grown\nperson trying to convey to the immature mind of a child an explanation\nof some of Nature's phenomena.\n\nI reflected upon their social condition and arrived at the conviction\nthat there is no occupation in life but what has its usefulness and\nnecessity, and, when united to culture and refinement, its dignity. A\ntree has a million leaves, yet each individual leaf, insignificant as it\nmay appear, has its special share of work to perform in helping the tree\nto live and perfect its fruit. So should every citizen of a government\ncontribute to its vitality and receive a share of its benefits.\n\n\"Will the time ever come,\" I asked myself, \"when my own country will see\nthis and rise to a social, if not intellectual equality.\" And the\nadmonition of the Preceptress would recur to my mind:\n\n\"Educate them. Educate them, and enlightenment will solve for them every\nproblem in Sociology.\"\n\nMy observations in Mizora led me to believe that while Nature will\npermit and encourage the outgrowth of equality in refinement, she gives\nbirth to a more decided prominence in the leadership of intellect.\n\nThe lady who conducted me through the culinary department, and pointed\nout the machinery and explained its use and convenience, had the same\ngrace and dignity of manner as the hostess displayed when exhibiting to\nme the rare plants in her conservatory.\n\nThe laundry was a separate business. No one unconnected with it as a\nprofession had anything to do with its duties. I visited several of the\nlarge city laundries and was informed that all were conducted alike.\nSteam was employed in the cleaning process, and the drying was done by\nhot air impregnated with ozone. This removed from white fabrics every\nvestige of discoloration or stain. I saw twelve dozen fine damask\ntable-cloths cleaned, dried and ironed in thirty minutes. All done by\nmachinery. They emerged from the rollers that ironed them looking like\nnew pieces of goods, so pure was their color, and so glossy their\nfinish.\n\nI inquired the price for doing them up, and was told a cent a piece.\nTwelve cents per dozen was the established price for doing up clothes.\nTable-cloths and similar articles were ironed between rollers\nconstructed to admit their full width. Other articles of more\ncomplicated make, were ironed by machines constructed to suit them. Some\narticles were dressed by having hot air forced rapidly through them.\nLace curtains, shawls, veils, spreads, tidies and all similar articles,\nwere by this process made to look like new, and at a cost that I thought\nought certainly to reduce the establishment to beggary or insolvency.\nBut here chemistry again was the magician that had made such cheap labor\nprofitable. And such advanced knowledge of chemistry was the result of\nuniversal education.\n\nLadies sent their finest laces to be renewed without fear of having them\nreduced to shreds. In doing up the frailest laces, nothing but hot air\nimpregnated with ozone was employed. These were consecutively forced\nthrough the fabric after it was carefully stretched. Nothing was ever\nlost or torn, so methodical was the management of the work.\n\nI asked why cooking was not established as the laundry was, as a\ndistinct public business, and was told that it had been tried a number\nof times, but had always been found impracticable. One kind of work in a\nlaundry would suit everyone, but one course of cooking could not. Tastes\nand appetites differed greatly. What was palatable to one would be\ndisliked by another, and to prepare food for a large number of\ncustomers, without knowing or being able to know exactly what the demand\nwould be, had always resulted in large waste, and as the people of\nMizora were the most rigid and exacting economists, it was not to be\nwondered at that they had selected the most economical plan. Every\nprivate cook could determine accurately the amount of food required for\nthe household she prepared it for, and knowing their tastes she could\ncater to all without waste.\n\n\"We, as yet,\" said my distinguished instructor, \"derive all our fruit\nand vegetables from the soil. We have orchards and vineyards and gardens\nwhich we carefully tend, and which our knowledge of chemistry enables us\nto keep in health and productiveness. But there is always more or less\nearthy matter in all food derived from cultivating the soil, and the\nlaboratories are now striving to produce artificial fruit and vegetables\nthat will satisfy the palate and be free from deleterious matter.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\n\nOne of the most curious and pleasing sights in Mizora was the flower\ngardens and conservatories. Roses of all sizes and colors and shades of\ncolor were there. Some two feet across were placed by the side of others\nnot exceeding the fourth of an inch in order to display the disparity in\nsize.\n\nTo enter into a minute description of all the discoveries made by the\nMizora people in fruit and floriculture, would be too tedious; suffice\nto say they had laid their hands upon the beautiful and compelled nature\nto reveal to them the secret of its formation. The number of petals,\ntheir color, shape and size, were produced as desired. The only thing\nthey could neither create nor destroy was its perfume. I questioned the\nPreceptress as to the possibility of its ever being discovered? She\nreplied:\n\n\"It is the one secret of the rose that Nature refuses to reveal. I do\nnot believe we shall ever possess the power to increase or diminish the\nodor of a flower. I believe that Nature will always reserve to herself\nthe secret of its creation. The success that we enjoy in the wonderful\ncultivation of our fruits and flowers was one of our earliest scientific\nconquests.\"\n\nI learned that their orchards never failed to yield a bounteous harvest.\nThey had many fruits that were new to me, and some that were new and\ngreatly improved species of kinds that I had already seen and eaten in\nmy own or other countries. Nothing that they cultivated was ever without\nits own peculiar beauty as well as usefulness. Their orchards, when the\nfruit was ripe, presented a picture of unique charm. Their trees were\nalways trained into graceful shapes, and when the ripe fruit gleamed\nthrough the dark green foliage, every tree looked like a huge bouquet. A\ncherry tree that I much admired, and the fruit of which I found\nsurpassingly delicious, I must allow myself to describe. The cherries\nwere not surprisingly large, but were of the colors and transparency of\nhoney. They were seedless, the tree having to be propagated from slips.\nWhen the fruit was ripe the tree looked like a huge ball of pale amber\ngems hiding in the shadows of dark pointed leaves.\n\nTheir grape arbors were delightful pictures in their season of maturity.\nSome vines had clusters of fruit three feet long; but these I was told\nwere only to show what they _could_ do in grape culture. The usual and\nmarketable size of a bunch was from one to two pounds weight. The fruit\nwas always perfect that was offered for sale.\n\nScience had provided the fruit growers of Mizora with permanent\nprotections from all kinds of blight or decay.\n\nWhen I considered the wholesomeness of all kinds of food prepared for\nthe inhabitants of this favored land. I began to think they might owe a\ngoodly portion of their exceptional health to it, and a large share of\ntheir national amiability to their physical comfort. I made some such\nobservation to the Preceptress, and she admitted its correctness.\n\n\"The first step that my people made toward the eradication of disease\nwas in the preparation of healthy food; not for the rich, who could\nobtain it themselves, but for the whole nation.\"\n\nI asked for further information and she added:\n\n\"Science discovered that mysterious and complicated diseases often had\ntheir origin in adulterated food. People suffered and died, ignorant of\nwhat produced their disease. The law, in the first place, rigidly\nenforced the marketing of clean and perfect fruit, and a wholesome\nquality of all other provisions. This was at first difficult to do, as\nin those ancient days, (I refer to a very remote period of our history)\nin order to make usurious profit, dealers adulterated all kinds of food;\noften with poisonous substances. When every state took charge of its\nmarkets and provided free schools for cooking, progress took a rapid\nadvance. Do you wonder at it? Reflect then. How could I force my mind\ninto complete absorption of some new combination of chemicals, while the\ngastric juice in my stomach was battling with sour or adulterated food?\nNature would compel me to pay some attention to the discomfort of my\ndigestive organs, and it might happen at a time when I was on the verge\nof a revelation in science, which might be lost. You may think it an\ninsignificant matter to speak of in connection with the grand\nenlightenment that we possess; but Nature herself is a mass of little\nthings. Our bodies, strong and supple as they are, are nothing but a\nunion of tiny cells. It is by the investigation of little things that we\nhave reached the great ones.\"\n\nI felt a keen desire to know more about their progress toward universal\nhealth, feeling assured that the history of the extirpation of disease\nmust be curious and instructive. I had been previously made acquainted\nwith the fact that disease was really unknown to them, save in its\nhistorical existence. To cull this isolated history from their vast\nlibraries of past events, would require a great deal of patient and\nlaborious research, and the necessary reading of a great deal of matter\nthat I could not be interested in, and that could not beside be of any\nreal value to me, so I requested the Preceptress to give me an\nepitomized history of it in her own language, merely relating such facts\nas might be useful to me, and that I could comprehend, for I may as well\nbring forward the fact that, in comparison to theirs, my mind was as a\nsavages would be to our civilization.\n\nTheir brain was of a finer intellectual fiber. It possessed a wider,\ngrander, more majestic receptivity. They absorbed ideas that passed over\nme like a cloud. Their imaginations were etherealized. They reached into\nwhat appeared to be materialless space, and brought from it substances I\nhad never heard of before, and by processes I could not comprehend. They\ndivided matter into new elements and utilized them. They disintegrated\nmatter, added to it new properties and produced a different material. I\nsaw the effects and uses of their chemistry, but that was all.\n\nThere are minds belonging to my own age, as there have been to all ages,\nthat are intellectually in advance of it. They live in a mental and\nprophetic world of their own, and leave behind them discoveries,\ninventions and teachings that benefit and ennoble the generations to\ncome. Could such a mind have chanced upon Mizora, as I chanced upon it,\nit might have consorted with its intellect, and brought from the\ncompanionship ideas that I could not receive, and sciences that I can\nfind no words in my language to represent. The impression that my own\ncountry might make upon a savage, may describe my relation to Mizora.\nWhat could an uncivilized mind say of our railroads, or magnificent\ncathedrals, our palaces, our splendor, our wealth, our works of art.\nThey would be as difficult of representation as were the lofty aims, the\nunselfishness in living, the perfect love, honor and intellectual\ngrandeur, and the universal comfort and luxury found in Mizora, were to\nme. To them the cultivation of the mind was an imperative duty, that\nneither age nor condition retarded. To do good, to be approved by their\nown conscience, was their constant pleasure.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\n\nIt was during my visit at my friend's house that I first witnessed the\npeculiar manner in which the markets in Mizora are conducted.\nEverything, as usual, was fastidiously neat and clean. The fruit and\nvegetables were fresh and perfect. I examined quantities of them to\nsatisfy myself, and not a blemish or imperfection could be found on any.\nNone but buyers were attending market. Baskets of fruit, bunches of\nvegetables and, in fact, everything exhibited for sale, had the quality\nand the price labeled upon it. Small wicker baskets were near to receive\nthe change. When a buyer had selected what suited her, she dropped the\nlabel and the change in the basket. I saw one basket filled with gold\nand silver coin, yet not one would be missing when the owner came to\ncount up the sales. Sometimes a purchaser was obliged to change a large\npiece of money, but it was always done accurately.\n\nThere was one singular trait these people possessed that, in conjunction\nwith their other characteristics, may seem unnatural: they would give\nand exact the last centime (a quarter of a cent) in a trade. I noticed\nthis peculiarity so frequently that I inquired the reason for it, and\nwhen I had studied it over I decided that, like all the other rules that\nthese admirable people had established, it was wise. Said my friend:\n\n\"We set a just value on everything we prepare for sale. Anything above\nor below that, would be unjust to buyer or seller.\"\n\nThe varieties of apples, pears, peaches and other fruits had their names\nattached, with the quality, sweet, sour, or slightly acid. In no\ninstance was it found to be incorrectly stated. I came to one stall that\ncontained nothing but glass jars of butter and cream. The butter was a\nrich buff color, like very fine qualities I had seen in my own country.\nThe cream, an article I am fond of drinking, looked so tempting I longed\nto purchase a glass for that purpose. The lady whom I accompanied (my\nhostess' cook) informed me that it was artificially prepared. The butter\nand cheese were chemical productions. Different laboratories produced\narticles of varying flavor, according to the chemist's skill. Although\ntheir construction was no secret, yet some laboratories enjoyed special\nreputation for their butter and cheese owing to the accuracy with which\ntheir elements were combined.\n\nShe gave me quite a history about artificial food, also how they kept\nfruits and vegetables in their natural state for years without decaying\nor losing their flavor, so that when eaten they were nearly as fine as\nwhen freshly gathered. After hearing that the cream was manufactured, I\nresolved to taste it. Dropping my coin into the basket, I took up a\nglass and drank it. A look of disgust crossed the countenance of my\ncompanion.\n\n\"Do you not drink this?\" I asked in surprise, as I set down the empty\nvessel. \"It is truly delicious.\"\n\n\"At regular meal times we all use it, and sometimes drink it in\npreference to other beverages--but never in public. You will never see a\ncitizen of Mizora eating in public. Look all over this market and you\nwill not discover one person, either adult or child, eating or drinking,\nunless it be water.\"\n\nI could not; and I felt keenly mortified at my mistake. Yet in my own\ncountry and others that, according to our standard, are highly\ncivilized, a beverage is made from the juice of the corn that is not\nonly drank in public places, but its effects, which are always\nunbecoming, are exhibited also, and frequently without reproof. However,\nI said nothing to my companion about this beverage. It bears no\ncomparison in color or taste to that made in Mizora. I could not have\ndistinguished the latter from the finest dairy cream.\n\nThe next place of interest that I visited were their mercantile bazars\nor stores. Here I found things looking quite familiar. The goods were\npiled upon shelves behind counters, and numerous clerks were in\nattendance. It was the regular day for shopping among the Mizora ladies,\nand the merchants had made a display of their prettiest and richest\ngoods. I noticed the ladies were as elegantly dressed as if for a\nreception, and learned that it was the custom. They would meet a great\nmany friends and acquaintances, and dressed to honor the occasion.\n\nIt was my first shopping experience in Mizora, and I quite mortified\nmyself by removing my glove and rubbing and examining closely the goods\nI thought of purchasing. I entirely ignored the sweet voice of the\nclerk that was gently informing me that it was \"pure linen\" or \"pure\nwool,\" so habituated had I become in my own country to being my own\njudge of the quality of the goods I was purchasing, regardless always of\nthe seller's recommendation of it. I found it difficult, especially in\nsuch circumstances, to always remember their strict adherence to honesty\nand fair dealing. I felt rebuked when I looked around and saw the\nactions of the other ladies in buying.\n\nIn manufactured goods, as in all other things, not the slightest\ncheatery is to be found. Woolen and cotton mixtures were never sold for\npure wool. Nobody seemed to have heard of the art of glossing muslin\ncuffs and collars and selling them for pure linen.\n\nFearing that I had wounded the feelings of the lady in attendance upon\nme, I hastened to apologize by explaining the peculiar methods of trade\nthat were practiced in my own country. They were immediately pronounced\nbarbarous.\n\nI noticed that ladies in shopping examined colors and effects of\ntrimmings or combinations, but never examined the quality. Whatever the\nattendant said about _that_ was received as a fact.\n\nThe reason for the absence of attendants in the markets and the presence\nof them in mercantile houses was apparent at once. The market articles\nwere brought fresh every day, while goods were stored.\n\nTheir business houses and their manner of shopping were unlike anything\nI had ever met with before. The houses were all built in a hollow\nsquare, enclosing a garden with a fountain in the center. These were\ninvariably roofed over with glass, as was the entire building. In winter\nthe garden was as warm as the interior of the store. It was adorned with\nflowers and shrubs. I often saw ladies and children promenading in these\npretty inclosures, or sitting on their rustic sofas conversing, while\ntheir friends were shopping in the store. The arrangement gave perfect\nlight and comfort to both clerks and customers, and the display of rich\nand handsome fabrics was enhanced by the bit of scenery beyond. In\nsummer the water for the fountain was artificially cooled.\n\nEvery clerk was provided with a chair suspended by pulleys from strong\niron rods fastened above. They could be raised or lowered at will; and\nwhen not occupied, could be drawn up out of the way. After the goods\nwere purchased, they were placed in a machine that wrapped and tied them\nready for delivery.\n\nA dining-room was always a part of every store. I desired to be shown\nthis, and found it as tasteful and elegant in its appointments as a\nprivate one would be. Silver and china and fine damask made it inviting\nto the eye, and I had no doubt the cooking corresponded as well with the\ntaste.\n\nThe streets of Mizora were all paved, even the roads through the\nvillages were furnished an artificial cover, durable, smooth and\nelastic. For this purpose a variety of materials were used. Some had\nartificial stone, in the manufacture of which Mizora could surpass\nnature's production. Artificial wood they also made and used for\npavements, as well as cement made of fine sand. The latter was the least\ndurable, but possessed considerable elasticity and made a very fine\ndriving park. They were experimenting when I came away on sanded glass\nfor road beds. The difficulty was to overcome its susceptibility to\nattrition. After business hours every street was swept by a machine. The\nstreets and sidewalks, in dry weather, were as free from soil as the\nfloor of a private-house would be.\n\nAnimals and domestic fowls had long been extinct in Mizora. This was one\ncause of the weird silence that so impressed me on my first view of\ntheir capital city. Invention had superceded the usefulness of animals\nin all departments: in the field and the chemistry of food. Artificial\npower was utilized for all vehicles.\n\nThe vehicle most popular with the Mizora ladies for shopping and culling\npurposes, was a very low carriage, sometimes with two seats, sometimes\nwith one. They were upholstered with the richest fabrics, were\nexceedingly light and graceful in shape, and not above three feet from\nthe ground. They were strong and durable, though frequently not\nexceeding fifty pounds in weight. The wheel was the curious and\ningenious part of the structure, for in its peculiar construction lay\nthe delight of its motion. The spokes were flat bands of steel, curved\noutward to the tire. The carriage had no spring other than these spokes,\nyet it moved like a boat gliding down stream with the current. I was\nfortunate enough to preserve a drawing of this wheel, which I hope some\nday to introduce in my own land. The carriages were propelled by\ncompressed air or electricity; and sometimes with a mechanism that was\nsimply pressed with the foot. I liked the compressed air best. It was\nmost easily managed by me. The Mizora ladies preferred electricity, of\nwhich I was always afraid. They were experimenting with a new propelling\npower during my stay that was to be acted upon by light, but it had not\ncome into general use, although I saw some vehicles that were propelled\nby it. They moved with incredible speed, so rapid indeed, that the\nupper part of the carriage had to be constructed of glass, and securely\nclosed while in motion, to protect the occupant. It was destined, I\nheard some of their scientists say, to become universal, as it was the\nmost economical power yet discovered. They patiently tried to explain it\nto me, but my faculties were not receptive to such advanced philosophy,\nand I had to abandon the hope of ever introducing it into my own\ncountry.\n\nThere was another article manufactured in Mizora that excited my wonder\nand admiration. It was elastic glass. I have frequently mentioned the\nunique uses that they made of it, and I must now explain why. They had\ndiscovered a process to render it as pliable as rubber. It was more\nuseful than rubber could be, for it was almost indestructible. It had\nsuperceded iron in many ways. All cooking utensils were made of it. It\nentered largely into the construction and decoration of houses. All\ncisterns and cellars had an inner lining of it. All underground pipes\nwere made of it, and many things that are the necessities and luxuries\nof life.\n\nThey spun it into threads as fine and delicate as a spider's gossamer,\nand wove it into a network of clear or variegated colors that dazzled\nthe eye to behold. Innumerable were the lovely fabrics made of it. The\nfrailest lace, in the most intricate and aerial patterns, that had the\nadvantage of never soiling, never tearing, and never wearing out.\nCurtains for drawing-room arches were frequently made of it. Some of\nthem looked like woven dew drops.\n\nOne set of curtains that I greatly admired, and was a long time ignorant\nof what they were made of, were so unique, I must do myself the pleasure\nto describe them. They hung across the arch that led to the glass\nconservatory attached to my friend's handsome dwelling. Three very thin\nsheets of glass were woven separately and then joined at the edges so\ningeniously as to defy detection. The inside curtain was one solid\ncolor: crimson. Over this was a curtain of snow flakes, delicate as\nthose aerial nothings of the sky, and more durable than any fabric\nknown. Hung across the arched entrance to a conservatory, with a great\nglobe of white fire shining through it, it was lovely as the blush of\nAphrodite when she rose from the sea, veiled in its fleecy foam.\n\nThey also possessed the art of making glass highly refractive. Their\ntable-ware surpassed in beauty all that I had ever previously seen. I\nsaw tea cups as frail looking as soap bubbles, possessing the delicate\niridescence of opals. Many other exquisite designs were the product of\nits flexibility and transparency. The first article that attracted my\nattention was the dress of an actress on the stage. It was lace, made of\ngossamer threads of amber in the design of lilies and leaves, and was\nworn over black velvet.\n\nThe wonderful water scene that I beheld at the theatre was produced by\nwaves made of glass and edged with foam, a milky glass spun into tiny\nbubbles. They were agitated by machinery that caused them to roll with a\nterribly natural look. The blinding flashes of lightning had been the\ndisplay of genuine electricity.\n\nNothing in the way of artistic effect could call forth admiration or\nfavorable comment unless it was so exact an imitation of nature as to\nnot be distinguished from the real without the closest scrutiny. In\nprivate life no one assumed a part. All the acting I ever saw in Mizora\nwas done upon the stage.\n\nI could not appreciate their mental pleasures, any more than a savage\ncould delight in a nocturne of Chopin. Yet one was the intellectual\necstasy of a sublime intelligence, and the other the harmonious rapture\nof a divinely melodious soul. I must here mention that the processes of\nchemical experiment in Mizora differed materially from those I had\nknown. I had once seen and tasted a preparation called artificial cream\nthat had been prepared by a friend of my fathers, an eminent English\nchemist. It was simply a combination of the known properties of cream\nunited in the presence of gentle heat. But in Mizora they took certain\nchemicals and converted them into milk, and cream, and cheese, and\nbutter, and every variety of meat, in a vessel that admitted neither air\nnor light. They claimed that the elements of air and light exercised a\nmaterial influence upon the chemical production of foods, that they\ncould not be made successfully by artificial processes when exposed to\nthose two agents. Their earliest efforts had been unsuccessful of exact\nimitation, and a perfect result had only been obtained by closely\ncounterfeiting the processes of nature.\n\nThe cream prepared artificially that I had tasted in London, was the\nsame color and consistency as natural cream, but it lacked its relish.\nThe cream manufactured in Mizora was a perfect imitation of the finest\ndairy product.\n\nIt was the same with meats; they combined the elements, and the article\nproduced possessed no detrimental flavor. It was a more economical way\nof obtaining meat than by fattening animals.\n\nThey were equally fortunate in the manufacture of clothing. Every\nmountain was a cultivated forest, from which they obtained every variety\nof fabric; silks, satins, velvets, laces, woolen goods, and the richest\narticles of beauty and luxury, in which to array themselves, were put\nupon the market at a trifling cost, compared to what they were\nmanufactured at in my own country. Pallid and haggard women and\nchildren, working incessantly for a pittance that barely sustained\nexistence, was the ultimatum that the search after the cause of cheap\nprices arrived at in my world, but here it traveled from one bevy of\nbeautiful workwoman to another until it ended at the Laboratory where\nScience sat throned, the grand, majestic, humane Queen of this thrice\nhappy land.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\n\nWhenever I inquired:\n\n\"From whence comes the heat that is so evenly distributed throughout the\ndwellings and public buildings of Mizora?\" they invariably pointed to\nthe river. I asked in astonishment:\n\n\"From water comes fire?\"\n\nAnd they answered: \"Yes.\"\n\nI had long before this time discovered that Mizora was a nation of very\nwonderful people, individually and collectively; and as every revelation\nof their genius occurred, I would feel as though I could not be\nsurprised at any marvelous thing that they should claim to do, but I was\nreally not prepared to believe that they could set the river on fire.\nYet I found that such was, scientifically, the fact. It was one of their\nmost curious and, at the same time, useful appliances of a philosophical\ndiscovery.\n\nThey separated water into its two gases, and then, with their ingenious\nchemical skill, converted it into an economical fuel.\n\nTheir coal mines had long been exhausted, as had many other of nature's\nresources for producing artificial heat. The dense population made it\nimpracticable to cultivate forests for fuel. Its rapid increase demanded\nof Science the discovery of a fuel that could be consumed without loss\nto them, both in the matter consumed and in the expense of procuring it.\nNothing seemed to answer their purpose so admirably as water. Water,\nwhen decomposed, becomes gas. Convert the gas into heat and it becomes\nwater again. A very great heat produces only a small quantity of water:\nhence the extreme utility of water as a heat producing agent.\n\nThe heating factories were all detached buildings, and generally, if at\nall practicable, situated near a river, or other body of water. Every\nprecaution against accident was stringently observed.\n\nThere were several processes for decomposing the water explained to me,\nbut the one preferred, and almost universally used by the people of\nMizora, was electricity. The gases formed at the opposite poles of the\nelectrical current, were received in large glass reservoirs, especially\nconstructed for them.\n\nIn preparing the heat that gave such a delightful temperature to the\ndwellings and public buildings of their vast cities, glass was always\nthe material used in the construction of vessels and pipes. Glass pipes\nconveyed the separate gases of hydrogen and oxygen into an apartment\nespecially prepared for the purpose, and united them upon ignited\ncarbon. The heat produced was intense beyond description, and in the\nhands of less experienced and capable chemists, would have proved\ndestructful to life and property. The hardest rock would melt in its\nembrace; yet, in the hands of these wonderful students of Nature, it was\nunder perfect control and had been converted into one of the most\nhealthful and agreeable agents of comfort and usefulness known. It was\nregulated with the same ease and convenience with which we increase or\ndiminish the flames of a gas jet. It was conducted, by means of glass\npipes, to every dwelling in the city. One factory supplied sufficient\nheat for over half a million inhabitants.\n\nI thought I was not so far behind Mizora in a knowledge of heating with\nhot air; yet, when I saw the practical application of their method, I\ncould see no resemblance to that in use in my own world. In winter,\nevery house in Mizora had an atmosphere throughout as balmy as the\nbreath of the young summer. Country-houses and farm dwellings were all\nsupplied with the same kind of heat.\n\nIn point of economy it could not be surpassed. A city residence,\ncontaining twenty rooms of liberal size and an immense conservatory, was\nheated entire, at a cost of four hundred centimes a year. One dollar per\nannum for fuel.\n\nThere was neither smoke, nor soot, nor dust. Instead of entering a room\nthrough a register, as I had always seen heated air supplied, it came\nthrough numerous small apertures in the walls of a room quite close to\nthe floor, thus rendering its supply imperceptible, and making a draft\nof cold air impossible.\n\nThe extreme cheapness of artificial heat made a conservatory a necessary\nluxury of every dwelling. The same pipes that supplied the dwelling\nrooms with warmth, supplied the hot-house also, but it was conveyed to\nthe plants by a very different process.\n\nThey used electricity in their hot-houses to perfect their fruit, but\nin what way I could not comprehend; neither could I understand their\nmethod of supplying plants and fruits with carbonic acid gas. They\nmanufactured it and turned it into their hot-houses during sleeping\nhours. No one was permitted to enter until the carbon had been absorbed.\nThey had an instrument resembling a thermometer which gave the exact\ncondition of the atmosphere. They were used in every house, as well as\nin the conservatories. The people of Mizora were constantly\nexperimenting with those two chemical agents, electricity and carbonic\nacid gas, in their conservatories. They confidently believed that with\ntheir service, they could yet produce fruit from their hot-houses, that\nwould equal in all respects the season grown article.\n\nThey produced very fine hot-house fruit. It was more luscious than any\nartificially ripened fruit that I had ever tasted in my own country, yet\nit by no means compared with their season grown fruit. Their preserved\nfruit I thought much more natural in flavor than their hot-house fruit.\n\nMany of their private greenhouses were on a grand scale and contained\nfruit as well as flowers. A family that could not have a hot-house for\nfresh vegetables, with a few fruit trees in it, would be poor indeed.\nWhere a number of families had united in purchasing extensive grounds,\nvery fine conservatories were erected, their expense being divided among\nthe property holders, and their luxuries enjoyed in common.\n\nSo methodical were all the business plans of the Mizora people, and so\nstrictly just were they in the observance of all business and social\nduties that no ill-feeling or jealousy could arise from a combination of\ncapital in private luxuries. Such combinations were formed and carried\nout upon strictly business principles.\n\nIf the admirable economy with which every species of work was carried on\nin Mizora could be thoroughly comprehended, the universality of luxuries\nneed not be wondered at. They were drilled in economy from a very early\nperiod. It was taught them as a virtue.\n\nMachinery, with them, had become the slave of invention. I lived long\nenough in Mizora to comprehend that the absence of pauperism, genteel\nand otherwise, was largely due to the ingenious application of machinery\nto all kinds of physical labor. When the cost of producing luxuries\ndecreases, the value of the luxuries produced must decrease with it. The\nresult is they are within reach of the narrowest incomes. A life\nsurrounded by refinement must absorb some of it.\n\nI had a conversation with the Preceptress upon this subject, and she\nsaid:\n\n\"Some natures are so undecided in character that they become only what\ntheir surroundings make them. Others only partially absorb tastes and\nsentiments that form the influence about them. They maintain a decided\nindividuality; yet they are most always noticeably marked with the\ngeneral character of their surroundings. It is very, very seldom that a\nnature is fixed from infancy in one channel.\"\n\nI told her that I knew of a people whose minds from infancy to mature\nage, never left the grooves they were born in. They belonged to every\nnationality, and had palaces built for them, and attendants with\ncultivated intelligences employed to wait upon them.\n\n\"Are their minds of such vast importance to their nation? You have never\nbefore alluded to intellect so elevated as to command such royal\nhomage.\" My friend spoke with awakened interest.\n\n\"They are of no importance at all,\" I answered, humiliated at having\nalluded to them. \"Some of them have not sufficient intelligence to even\nfeed themselves.\"\n\n\"And what are they?\" she inquired anxiously.\n\n\"They are idiots; human vegetables.\"\n\n\"And you build palaces for them, and hire servants to feed and tend\nthem, while the bright, ambitious children of the poor among you,\nstruggle and suffer for mental advancement. How deplorably short-sighted\nare the wise ones of your world. Truly it were better in your country to\nbe born an idiot than a poor genius.\" She sighed and looked grave.\n\n\"What should we do with them?\" I inquired.\n\n\"What do you do with the useless weeds in your garden,\" she asked\nsignificantly. \"Do you carefully tend them, while drouth and frost and\nlack of nourishment cause your choice plants to wither and die?\"\n\n\"We are far behind you,\" I answered humbly. \"But barbarous as you think\nwe are, no epithet could be too scathing, too comprehensive of all that\nwas vicious and inhuman, to apply to a person who should dare to assail\nthe expense of those institutions, or suggest that they be converted to\nthe cultivation of intellect that _could_ be improved.\"\n\nMy friend looked thoughtful for a long time, then she resumed her\ndiscourse at the point where I had so unfortunately interrupted it.\n\n\"No people,\" she said, \"can rise to universal culture as long as they\ndepend upon hand labor to produce any of the necessities of life. The\nabsence of a demand for hand labor gives rise to an increasing demand\nfor brain labor, and the natural and inevitable result is an increased\nmental activity. The discovery of a fuel that is furnished at so small a\ncost and with really no labor but what machinery performs, marks one\ngrand era in our mental progress.\"\n\nIn mentioning the numerous uses made of glass in Mizora, I must not\nforget to give some notice to their water supply in large cities. Owing\nto their cleanly advantages, the filtering and storing of rain-water in\nglass-lined cisterns supplied many family uses. But drinking water was\nbrought to their large cities in a form that did not greatly differ from\nthose I was already familiar with, excepting in cleanliness. Their\nreservoirs were dug in the ground and lined with glass, and a perfectly\nfitting cover placed on the top. They were constructed so that the water\nthat passed through the glass feed pipes to the city should have a\nuniform temperature, that of ordinary spring water. The water in the\ncovered reservoirs was always filtered and tested before passing into\nthe distributing pipes.\n\nNo citizen of Mizora ever hied to the country for pure water and fresh\nair. Science supplied both in a densely populated city.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\n\nWhen a question as to the existence of social distinctions would be\nasked the citizens of Mizora, the invariable answer would be--there were\nnone; yet a long and intimate acquaintance with them assured me that\nthere were. They had an aristocracy; but of so peculiar and amiable a\nkind that it deserves a special mention. It took a long time for me to\ncomprehend the exact condition of their society in this respect. That\nthere were really no dividing lines between the person who superintended\nthe kitchen and the one who paid her for it, in a social point of view,\nI could plainly see; yet there were distinctions; and rather sharply\ndefined ones too.\n\nIn order to explain more lucidly the peculiar social life of Mizora, I\nwill ask you to remember some Charity Fair you have attended, perhaps\nparticipated in, and which had been gotten up and managed by women of\nthe highest social rank. If in a country where titles and social\npositions were hereditary, it then represented the highest aristocracy\nof blood. Grand dames there departed from the routine of their daily\nlives and assumed the lowlier occupations of others. They stood behind\ncounters, in booths, and sold fancy articles, or dispensed ices and\nlemonade, or waited upon customers at the refreshment tables; bringing\nin trays of eatables, gathering up and removing empty dishes; performing\nlabor that, under the ordinary circumstances of life, they would not\nperform in their own homes, and for their own kindred. It was all done\nwith the same conscious dignity and ease that characterized the\nstatelier duties of their every day life. One fact was apparent to all:\nthey were gentlewomen still. The refinement of their home education, and\nthe charm of nourished beauty were, perhaps, more prominent in contrast\nwith their assumed avocation.\n\nThe Charity Fair, with its clerks and waiter girls and flower sellers\ncalled from the highest society, was a miniature picture of the actual\nevery-day social life of Mizora. The one who ordered a dinner at their\nfinest hotel, had it served to her by one who occupied the same social\nstanding. Yet there _was_ a difference; but it was the difference of\nmind.\n\nThe student in Sociology discovers that in all grades of society,\ncongenial natures gravitate to a center. A differentiation of the\nhighest mental quality was the result of this law in Mizora, and its\nco-ordinate part, their aristocracy.\n\nThe social organism did not need legislation to increase its benefits;\nit turned to Science, and, through Science, to Nature. The Laboratory of\nthe Chemist was the focus that drew the attention of all minds. Mizora\nmight be called a great school of Nature, whose pupils studied her every\nphase, and pried into her secrets with persistent activity, and obeyed\nher instructions as an imperative duty. They observed Nature to be an\neconomist, and practiced economy with scrupulous exactness.\n\nThey had observed that in all grades of animal life, from the lowest\nform to the highest, wherever sociality had produced unity a leader was\nevolved, a superiority that differed in power according to the grade of\ndevelopment. In the earlier histories, the leaders were chosen for their\nprowess in arms. Great warriors became rulers, and soldiers were the\naristocracy of the land. As civilization progressed and learning became\nmore widely disseminated, the military retired before the more\nintellectual aristocracy of statemanship. Politics was the grand\nentrance to social eminence.\n\n\"But,\" said my friend, \"_we_ have arrived at a higher, nobler, grander\nage. The military and political supremacies lived out their usefulness\nand decayed. A new era arrived. The differentia of mind evolved an\naristocracy.\"\n\nScience has long been recognized as the greatest benefactor of our race.\nIts investigators and teachers are our only acknowledged superiors and\nleaders.\n\nGenerally the grandest intellects and those which retain their creative\npower the longest, are of exceptionally slow development. Precocity is\nshort lived, and brilliant rather than strong. This I knew to be true of\nmy own race.\n\nIn Mizora, a mind that developed late lost none of the opportunities\nthat belong exclusively to the young of my own and other countries of\nthe outer world. Their free schools and colleges were always open:\nalways free. For this reason, it was no unusual thing for a person in\nMizora to begin life at the very lowest grade and rise to its supreme\nheight. Whenever the desire awakened, there was a helping hand extended\non every side.\n\nThe distinction between the aristocracy and the lower class, or the\ngreat intellects and the less, was similar to the relative positions of\nteacher and pupil. I recognized in this social condition the great media\nof their marvelous approach to perfection. This aristocracy was never\narrogant, never supercilious, never aggressive. It was what the\nphilosophers of our world are: tolerant, humane, sublime.\n\nIn all communities of civilized nations marked musical talent will form\nsocial relations distinct from, but not superior to, other social\nrelations. The leader of a musical club might also be the leader of\nanother club devoted to exclusive literary pursuits; and both clubs\npossess equal social respect. Those who possess musical predilections,\nseek musical associations; those who are purely literary, seek their\ncongenials. This is true of all other mental endowments or tastes; that\nwhich predominates will seek its affinity; be it in science, literature,\npolitics, music, painting, or sculpture. Social organizations naturally\ngrow out of other business pursuits and vocations of all grades and\nkinds. The society of Mizora was divided only by such distinctions. The\nscientific mind had precedence of all others. In the social world, they\nfound more congenial pleasure in one another, and they mingled more\nfrequently among themselves. Other professions and vocations followed\ntheir example for the same reason. Yet neither was barred by social\ncaste from seeking society where she would. If the artisan sought social\nintercourse with a philosopher, she was expected to have prepared\nherself by mental training to be congenial. When a citizen of Mizora\nbecame ambitious to rise, she did not have to struggle with every\nspecies of opposition, and contend against rebuff and repulse. Correct\nlanguage, refined tastes, dignified and graceful manners were the common\nacquirements of all. Mental culture of so high an order--I marveled that\na lifetime should be long enough to acquire it in--was universal.\n\nUnder such conditions social barriers could not be impregnable. In a\nworld divided by poverty and opulence into all their intermediate\ngrades, wealth must inevitably be pre-eminent. It represents refined and\nluxurious environments, and, if mind be there, intellectual pre-eminence\nalso. Where wealth alone governs society it has its prerogatives.\n\nThe wealth that affords the most luxurious entertainments must be the\nwealth that rules. Its privilege--its duty rather--is to ignore all\napplicants to fraternization that cannot return what it receives. Where\nmind is the sole aristocracy it makes demands as rigid, though\ndifferent, and mind was the aristocracy of Mizora. With them education\nis never at an end. I spoke of having graduated at a renowned school for\nyoung ladies, and when I explained that to graduate meant to finish\none's education, it elicited a peal of silvery mirth.\n\n\"_We_ never graduate,\" said Wauna. \"There is my mamma's mother, two\ncenturies old, and still studying. I paid her a visit the other day and\nshe took me into her laboratory. She is a manufacturer of lenses, and\nhas been experimenting on microscopes. She has one now that possesses a\ntruly wonderful power. The leaf of a pear tree, that she had allowed to\nbecome mouldy, was under the lens, and she told me to look.\n\n\"A panorama of life and activity spread out before me in such magnitude\nthat I can only compare it to the feeling one must possess who could be\nsuspended in air and look down upon our world for a cycle of time.\n\n\"Immense plains were visible with animals grazing upon them, that fought\nwith and devoured one another. They perished and sank away and immense\nforests sprang up like magic. They were inhabited by insects and tiny\ncreatures resembling birds. A sigh of air moved the leaf and a tiny drop\nof water, scarcely discernible to the naked eye rolled over the forests\nand plains, and before it passed to the other side of the leaf a great\nlake covered the spot. My great-great-grandmother has an acute conductor\nof sound that she has invented, so exquisite in mechanism as to reveal\nthe voice of the tiniest insect. She put it to my ear, and the bellowing\nof the animals in battle, the chirp of the insects and the voices of the\nfeathered mites could be clearly heard, but attenuated like the delicate\nnote of two threads of spun glass clashed together.\"\n\n\"And what good,\" I asked, \"can all this knowledge do you? Your\ngreat-great-grandmother has condensed the learning of two centuries to\nevolve this one discovery. Is it not so?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Wauna, and her look and tone were both solemn. \"You ask\nme what good it can do? Reflect! If the history of a single leaf is so\nvast and yet ephemeral, what may not be the history of a single world?\nWhat, after all, are we when such an infinitesimal space can contain\nsuch wonderful transactions in a second of time.\"\n\nI shuddered at the thought she raised in my mind. But inherited beliefs\nare not easily dissipated, so I only sought to change the subject.\n\n\"But what is the use of studying _all_ the time. There should be some\nperiod in your lives when you should be permitted to rest from your\nlabors. It is truly irksome to me to see everybody still eager to learn\nmore. The artist of the kitchen was up to the National College yesterday\nattending a lecture on chemistry. The artist who arranges my rooms is up\nthere to-day listening to one on air. I can not understand why, having\nlearned to make beds and cook to perfection, they should not be content\nwith their knowledge and their work.\"\n\n\"If you were one of us you would know,\" said Wauna. \"It is a duty with\nus to constantly seek improvement. The culinary artist at the house\nwhere you are visiting, is a very fine chemist. She has a predilection\nfor analyzing the construction of food. She may some day discover how\n_to_ produce vegetables from the elements.\n\n\"The artist who arranges your room is attending a lecture on air because\nher vocation calls for an accurate knowledge of it. She attends to the\natmosphere in the whole house, and sees that it is in perfect health\nsustaining condition. Your hostess has a particular fondness for flowers\nand decorates all her rooms with them. All plants are not harmless\noccupants of livingrooms. Some give forth exhalations that are really\nnoxious. That artist has so accurate a knowledge of air that she can\nkeep the atmosphere of your home in a condition of perfect purity; yet\nshe knows that her education is not finished. She is constantly studying\nand advancing. The time may come when she, too, will add a grand\ndiscovery to science.\n\n\"Had my ancestors thought as you do, and rested on an inferior\neducation, I should not represent the advanced stage of development that\nI do. As it is, when my mind reaches the age of my mother's, it will\nhave a larger comprehensiveness than hers. She already discerns it. My\nchildren will have intellects of a finer grade than mine. This is our\nsystem of mind culture. The intellect is of slower development than the\nbody, and takes longer to decay. The gradations of advancement from one\nintellectual basis to another, in a social body, requires centuries to\nmark a distinct change in the earlier ages of civilization, but we have\nnow arrived at a stage when advancement is clearly perceptible between\none generation and the next.\"\n\nWauna's mother added:\n\n\"Universal education is the great destroyer of castes. It is the\nconqueror of poverty and the foundation of patriotism. It purifies and\nstrengthens national, as well as individual character. In the earlier\nhistory of our race, there were social conditions that rendered many\nlives wretched, and that the law would not and, in the then state of\ncivilization, could not reach. They were termed \"domestic miseries,\" and\ndisappeared only under the influence of our higher intellectual\ndevelopment. The nation that is wise will educate its children.\"\n\n\"Alas! alas!\" was my own silent thought. \"When will my country rise to\nso grand an idea. When will wealth open the doors of colleges,\nacademies, and schools, and make the Fountain of Knowledge as free as\nthe God-given water we drink.\"\n\nAnd there rose a vision in my mind--one of those day dreams when fancy\nupon the wing takes some definite course--and I saw in my own land a\nTemple of Learning rise, grand in proportion, complete in detail, with a\nbroad gateway, over whose wide-open majestic portal was the significant\ninscription: \"ENTER WHO WILL: NO WARDER STANDS WATCH AT THE GATE.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\n\nThe Government of Mizora not being of primary importance in the\nestimation of the people, I have not made more than a mere mention of it\nheretofore. In this respect I have conformed to the generally expressed\ntaste of the Mizora people. In my own country the government and the\naristocracy were identical. The government offices and emoluments were\nthe highest pinnacles of ambition.\n\nI mentioned the disparity of opinion between Mizora and all other\ncountries I had known in regard to this. I could not understand why\npolitics in Mizora should be of so small importance. The answer was,\nthat among an educated and highly enlightened people, the government\nwill take care of itself. Having been perfected by wise experience, the\npeople allow it to glide along in the grooves that time has made for it.\n\nIn form, the government of Mizora was a Federal Republic. The term of\noffice in no department exceeded the limit of five years. The\nPresidential term of office was for five years.\n\nThey had one peculiar--exceedingly peculiar--law in regard to politics.\nNo candidate could come before the public seeking office before having a\ncertificate from the State College to which she belonged, stating her\nexamination and qualifications to fill such an office.\n\nJust like examining for school-teachers, I thought. And why not? Making\nlaws for a State is of far more importance than making them for a few\ndozen scholars. I remembered to have heard some of my American\nacquaintances say that in their country it was not always qualifications\nthat get a candidate into office. Some of the ways were devious and not\nsuitable for publicity. Offices were frequently filled by incompetent\nmen. There had been congressmen and other offices of higher and more\nresponsible duties, filled by persons who could not correctly frame a\nsentence in their native language, who could not spell the simplest\nwords as they were spelled in the dictionary, unless it were an\naccident.\n\nTo seek the office of President, or any other position under the General\nGovernment, required an examination and certificate from the National\nCollege. The examinations were always public, and conducted in such a\nmanner that imposture was impossible. Constituents could attend if they\nchose, and decide upon the qualifications of a favorite candidate. In\nall the public schools, politics--to a certain extent--formed part of\nthe general education of every child. Beyond that, any one having a\npredilection for politics could find in the State Colleges and National\nColleges the most liberal advantages for acquiring a knowledge of\npolitical economy, political arithmetic, and the science of government.\n\nPolitical campaigns, (if such a term could be applicable to the politics\nof Mizora) were of the mildest possible character. The papers published\nthe names of the candidates and their examinations in full. The people\nread and decided upon their choice, and, when the time came, voted. And\nthat was the extent of the campaign enthusiasm.\n\nI must mention that the examinations on the science of government were\nnot conducted as are ordinary examinations in any given study that\nconsists of questions and answers. That was the preliminary part. There\nfollowed a thorough, practical test of their ability to discharge the\nduties of office with wisdom. No matter which side the sympathies or\naffections might be enlisted upon, the stern decree of justice was what\nthe Mizorean abided by. From earliest infancy their minds were trained\nin that doctrine. In the discharge of all public duties especially, it\nseemed to be the paramount consideration. Certainly no government\nmachinery ever could move with more ease, or give greater satisfaction\nto the people, than that of Mizora.\n\nThey never appeared to be excited or uneasy about the result of the\nelections. I never heard an animated political argument, such as I used\nto read about in America. I asked a politician one day what she thought\nof the probable success of the opposite party. She replied that it would\nnot make any difference to the country as both candidates were perfectly\ncompetent to fill the office.\n\n\"Do you never make disparaging statements about the opposing candidate?\"\nwas my inquiry.\n\n\"How could we?\" she asked in surprise, \"when there are none to make.\"\n\n\"You might assume a few for the time being; just to make her lose\nvotes.\"\n\n\"That would be a crime worthy of barbarians.\"\n\n\"Do you never have any party issues?\"\n\n\"No. There is never anything to make an issue of. We all work for the\ngood of the people, and the whole people. There is no greed of glory or\ngain; no personal ambition to gratify. Were I to use any artifice to\nsecure office or popularity, I should be instantly deprived of public\nesteem and notice. I do my duty conscientiously; _that_ is the aim of\npublic life. I work for the public good and my popularity comes as it is\nearned and deserved. I have no fear of being slighted or underrated.\nEvery politician feels and acts the same way.\"\n\n\"Have politicians ever bought votes with money, or offered bribes by\npromising positions that it would be in their official power to grant\nwhen elected?\"\n\n\"Never! There is not a citizen of Mizora who would not scorn an office\nobtained in such a way. The profession of politics, while not to be\ncompared in importance with the sciences, is yet not devoid of dignity.\nIt is not necessary to make new laws. They were perfected long ago, and\nwhat has been proven good we have no desire to change. We manage the\ngovernment according to a conscientious interpretation of the law. We\nhave repealed laws that were in force when our Republic was young, and\ndropped them from the statute books. They were laws unworthy of our\ncivilization. We have laws for the protection of property and to\nregulate public morals, and while our civilization is in a state of\nadvancement that does not require them, yet we think it wisdom to let\nthem remain. The people know that we have such laws and live up to them\nwithout surveillance. They would abide by the principles of justice set\nforth in them just as scrupulously if we should repeal them.\n\n\"You spoke of bribes. In remote ages, when our country was emerging from\na state of semi-barbarism, such things were in common practice.\nPolitical chicanery was a name given to various underhand and dishonest\nmaneuvers to gain office and public power. It was frequently the case\nthat the most responsible positions in the Government would be occupied\nby the basest characters, who used their power only for fraud to enrich\nthemselves and their friends by robbing the people. They deceived the\nmasses by preaching purity. They were never punished. If they were\naccused and brought to trial, the wealth they had stolen from the\ngovernment purchased their acquittal, and then they posed as martyrs.\nThe form of government was then, as now, a Federal Republic, but the\npeople had very little to do with it. They were merely the tools of\nunscrupulous politicians. In those days a sensitively honest person\nwould not accept office, because the name politician was a synonym for\nflexible principles. It was derogatory to one's character to seek\noffice.\"\n\n\"Was dishonesty more prominent in one party than another?\" I asked,\nthinking how very Americanish this history sounded.\n\n\"We, who look back upon the conditions of those times and view it with\ndispassionate judgment, can perceive corruption in both political\nparties. The real welfare of the country was the last thing considered\nby a professional politician. There was always something that was to\nbenefit the people brought forward as a party issue, and used as a means\nof working up the enthusiasm or fears of the people, and usually dropped\nafter the election.\n\n\"The candidate for election in those days might be guilty of heinous\ncrimes, yet the party covered them all, and over that covering the\npartisan newspaper spread every virtue in the calendar. A stranger to\nthe country and its customs reading one of their partisan newspapers\nduring a political campaign, might conclude that the party _it_\nadvocated was composed of only the virtues of the country, and their\nleader an epitome of the supremest excellence.\n\n\"Reading in the same paper a description of the opposing party, the\nstranger might think it composed of only the degraded and disreputable\nportion of the nation, and its leader the scum of all its depravity. If\ncuriosity should induce a perusal of some partisan paper of the other\nparty, the same thing could be read in its columns, with a change of\nnames. It would be the opposite party that was getting represented in\nthe most despicable character, and _their_ leader was the only one who\npossessed enough honesty and talent to keep the country from going to\nwreck. The other party leader was the one who was guilty of all the\ncrimes in the calendar. A vast number of people were ignorant enough to\ncling blindly to one party and to believe every word published by its\npartisan papers. This superstitious party faith was what the\nunscrupulous politicians handled dexterously for their own selfish ends.\nIt was not until education became universal, and a higher culture was\nforced upon the majority--the working classes--that politics began to\npurify itself, and put on the dignity of real virtue, and receive the\nrespect that belongs to genuine justice.\n\n\"The people became disgusted with defamatory political literature, and\nthe honorable members of both parties abjured it altogether. In such a\ngovernment as this, two great parties could not exist, where one was\naltogether bad and the other altogether good. It became apparent to the\npeople that there was good in both parties, and they began to elect it\nirrespective of party prejudice. Politicians began to work for their\ncountry instead of themselves and their party, and politics took the\nnoble position that the rights of humanity designed it for. I have been\ngiving you quite a history of our ancient politics. Our present\ncondition is far different. As the people became enlightened to a higher\ndegree, the government became more compact. It might now be compared to\na large family. There are one hundred States in the Union. There was a\ntime when every State made its own laws for its own domestic government.\nOne code of laws is now enforced in every State. In going from one State\nto another citizens now suffer no inconvenience from a confusion of\nlaws. Every State owes allegiance to the General Government. No State or\nnumber of States could set up an independent government without\nobtaining the consent and legal dissolution from the General Government.\nBut such a thing will never be thought of. We have prospered as a great\nunited Nation. Our union has been our strength, our prosperity.\"\n\nI visited with Wauna a number of the States' Capitals. In architecture\nthe Mizora people display an excellent taste. Their public buildings\nmight all be called works of art. Their government buildings,\nespecially, were on a scale of magnificent splendor. The hollow square\nseemed to be a favorite form. One very beautiful capitol building was of\ncrystal glass, with facing and cornices of marble onyx. It looked more\nlike a gigantic gem than anything I could compare it to, especially when\nlighted up by great globes of white fire suspended from every ceiling.\n\nUpon my entrance into Mizora, I was led into the belief that I had\narrived at a female seminary, because the dining and sleeping\naccommodations for the stateswoman were all in the Capitol building. I\nobserved that the State Capitols were similarly accommodated. In Mizora\nthe home is the heart of all joy, and wherever a Mizora woman goes, she\nendeavors to surround herself with its comforts and pleasures. That was\nthe reason that the splendid Capitol building had its home-like\nappointments, was a Nation of women exclusively--at least as far as I\nhad as yet been able to discover.\n\nAnother reason for the homes of all officials of the Government being\nwithin the public buildings, was because all the personal expenses,\nexcepting clothing, were paid by the Government. The salaries of\nGovernment positions were not large, compared with those of the\nsciences; but as their social and political dues were paid out of the\npublic treasury, the salaries might be considered as net profit. This\ncustom had originated many centuries in the past. In those early days,\nwhen a penurious character became an incumbent of public office, the\nsocial obligations belonging to it were often but niggardly requited.\nSometimes business embarrassments and real necessity demanded economy;\nso, at last, the Government assumed all the expenses contingent upon\nevery office, from the highest to the lowest. By this means the occupant\nof a Government office was freed from every care but those of state.\n\nThe number and style of all social entertainments that were obligatory\nof the occupant of a public office, were regulated by law. As the people\nof Mizora believed in enjoyment, the entertainments provided by the\nGovernment as the necessary social dues of its officers, were not few,\nnor scantily furnished.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\n\nThe artificial light in Mizora puzzled me longest to understand. When I\nfirst noticed it, it appeared to me to have no apparent source. At the\ntouch of a delicate hand, it blazed forth like a star in the center of\nthe ceiling. It diffused a soft and pleasing brilliancy that lent a\ncharm to everything it revealed. It was a dreamy daylight, and was\nproduced by electricity.\n\nIn large halls, like a theatre or opera house, the light fell in a soft\nand penetrating radiance from the center of the dome. Its source was not\nvisible to either audience or actresses, and, in consequence, occasioned\nno discomfort to the eyes. The light that illuminated the stage was\nsimilarly arranged. The footlights were not visible. They were in the\nrear of the stage. The light came upward like the rays of the setting\nsun, revealing the setting of the stage with vivid distinctness. I can\nbest describe the effect of this singular arrangement by calling\nattention to the appearance of the sun when declining behind a small\nelevation. How sharply every object is outlined before it? How soft and\ndelicate is the light in which everything is bathed? Every cloud that\nfloats has all of its fleecy loveliness limned with a radiant clearness.\n\nI was very desirous to know how this singular effect was produced, and\nat my request was taken to the stage. An opening in the back part of it\nwas covered with pink colored glass. Powerful electric lights from below\nthe stage were reflected through this glass upon it. The glass was\nhighly refractive and so perfectly translucent, I at first thought there\nwas none there, and when I stood upon its edge, and looked down into a\nfiery gulf below, I instinctively thought of the \"Lost People,\" who are\nsaid to wander amid torturing yet unconsumable flames. But, happily, the\nones I gazed upon were harmless ones.\n\nThe street lights of Mizora were at a considerable elevation from the\nground. They were in, or over, the center of the street, and of such\ndiffuse brilliancy as to render the city almost as light as day. They\nwere in the form of immense globes of soft, white fire, and during the\nsix months that answered to the Mizora night, were kept constantly\nburning. It was during this period that the Aurora Borealis shone with\nsuch marvelous brilliancy.\n\nGenerally, its display was heralded by an arc of delicate green-tinted\nlight, that spanned the heavens. The green tint deepened into emerald,\nassuming a delicate rose hue as it faded upward into rays that diverged\nfrom the top until the whole resembled a gigantic crown. Every ray\nbecame a panorama of gorgeous colors, resembling tiny sparks, moving\nhither and thither with inconceivable swiftness. Sometimes a veil of\nmist of delicate green hue depended from the base of the crown, and\nswayed gently back and forth. As soon as the swaying motion commenced,\nthe most gorgeous colors were revealed. Myriads of sparks, no larger\nthan snow-flakes, swarmed across the delicate green curtain in every\nconceivable color and shade, but always of that vapory, vivid softness\nthat is indescribable. The dancing colors resembled gems encased in a\nfilm of mist.\n\nOne display that I witnessed I shall attempt to describe. The arc of\ndelicate green appeared first, and shot upward diverging rays of all the\nwarm, rich hues of red. They formed a vast crown, outlined with a\ndelicate halo of fire. A veil of misty green fluttered down from its\nbase, and, instantly, tiny crowns, composed of every brilliant color,\nwith a tracery of fire defining every separate one, began to chase one\nanother back and forth with bewildering rapidity. As the veil swayed to\nand fro, it seemed to shake the crowns into skeins of fire, each thread\nstrung with countless minute globes of every conceivable color and hue.\nThose fiery threads, aerial as thistle down, wove themselves in and out\nin a tangled mass of gorgeous beauty. Suddenly the beads of color fell\nin a shower of gems, topaz and emerald, ruby and sapphire, amethyst and\npearly crystals of dew. I looked upward, where the rays of variegated\ncolors were sweeping the zenith, and high above the first crown was a\nsecond more vivid still. Myriads of rainbows, the colors broad and\nintense, fluttered from its base, the whole outlined by a halo of fire.\nIt rolled together in a huge scroll, and, in an instant, fell apart a\nshower of flakes, minute as snow, but of all the gorgeous, dazzling hues\nof earth and sky combined. They disappeared in the mystery of space to\ninstantly form into a fluttering, waving banner of delicate green mist\nand--vanish; only to repeat itself.\n\nThe display of the Aurora Borealis was always an exhibition of\nastonishing rapidity of motion of intense colors. The most glorious\nsunset--where the vapory billows of the sky have caught the bloom of the\ndying Autumn--cannot rival it. All the precious gems of earth appear to\nhave dissolved into mist, to join in a wild and aerial dance. The people\nof Mizora attributed it entirely to electricity.\n\nAlthough the sun never rose or set in Mizora, yet for six months in a\nyear, that country had the heart of a voluptuous summer. It beat with a\nstrong, warm pulse of life through all nature. The orchards budded and\nbloomed, and mellowed into perfect fruition their luscious globes. The\nfields laughed in the warm, rich light, and smiled on the harvest. I\ncould feel my own blood bound as with a new lease of life at the first\nbreath of spring.\n\nThe winters of Mizora had clouds and rain and sleet and snow, and\nsometimes, especially near the circular sea, the fury of an Arctic snow\nstorm; but so well prepared were they that it became an amusement.\nLooking into the chaos of snow flakes, driven hither and thither by\nfierce winds, the pedestrians in the street presented no painful\ncontrast to the luxury of your own room, with its balmy breath and\ncheerful flowers. You saw none but what were thoroughly clad, and you\nknew that they were hurrying to homes that were bright and attractive,\nif not as elegant as yours; where loving welcomes were sure to greet\nthem and happiness would sit with them at the feast; for the heart that\nis pure has always a kingly guest for its company.\n\nA wonderful discovery that the people of Mizora had made was the power\nto annihilate space as an impediment to conversation. They claimed that\nthe atmosphere had regular currents of electricity that were accurately\nknown to them. They talked to them by means of simply constructed\ninstruments, and the voice would be as audible and as easily recognized\nat three thousand miles distant as at only three feet. Stations were\nbuilt similar to our telegraph offices, but on high elevations. I\nunderstood that they could not be used upon the surface. Every private\nand public house, however, had communication with the general office,\nand could converse with friends at a distance whenever desirable. Public\nspeakers made constant use of it, but in connection with another\nextraordinary apparatus which I regret my inability to perfectly\ndescribe.\n\nI saw it first from the dress circle of a theater. It occupied the whole\nrear of the stage, and from where I sat, looked like a solid wall of\npolished metal. But it had a wonderful function, for immediately in\nfront of it, moving, speaking and gesturing, was the figure of a popular\npublic lecturer, so life-like in appearance that I could scarcely be\nconvinced that it was only a reflection. Yet such it was, and the\noriginal was addressing an audience in person more than a thousand miles\ndistant.\n\nIt was no common thing for a lecturer to address a dozen or more\naudiences at the same time, scattered over an area of thousands of\nmiles, and every one listening to and observing what appeared to be the\nreal speaker. In fact, public speakers in Mizora never traveled on pure\nprofessional business. It was not necessary. They prepared a room in\ntheir own dwelling with the needful apparatus, and at the time specified\ndelivered a lecture in twenty different cities.\n\nI was so interested in this very remarkable invention that I made\nvigorous mental exertions to comprehend it sufficiently to explain its\nmechanism and philosophical principles intelligently; but I can only say\nthat it was one of the wonders those people produced with electricity.\nThe mechanism was simple, but the science of its construction and\nworkings I could not comprehend. The grasp of my mind was not broad\nenough. The instrument that transmitted the voice was entirely separate.\n\nI must not neglect to mention that all kinds of public entertainments,\nsuch as operas, concerts and dramas, could be and were repeated to\naudiences at a distance from where the real transaction was taking\nplace. I attended a number of operas that were only the reflex of others\nthat were being presented to audiences far distant.\n\nThese repetitions were always marvels of accuracy of vividness.\n\nSmall reflecting apparatus were to be found in every dwelling and\nbusiness house. It is hardly necessary to state that letter-writing was\nan unknown accomplishment in Mizora. The person who desired to converse\nwith another, no matter how far distant, placed herself in communication\nwith her two instruments and signaled. Her friend appeared upon the\npolished metal surface like the figure in a mirror, and spoke to her\naudibly, and looked at her with all the naturalness of reality.\n\nI have frequently witnessed such interviews between Wauna and her\nmother, when we were visiting distant cities. It was certainly a more\nsatisfactory way of communicating than by letter. The small apparatus\nused by private families and business houses were not like those used in\npublic halls and theaters. In the former, the reflection was exactly\nsimilar to the image of a mirror; in the latter, the figure was\nprojected upon the stage. It required more complicated machinery to\nproduce, and was not practicable for small families or business houses.\nI now learned that on my arrival in Mizora I had been taken to one of\nthe largest apparatus and put in communication with it. I was informed\nby Wauna that I had been exhibited to every college and school in the\ncountry by reflex representation. She said that she and her mother had\nseen me distinctly and heard my voice. The latter had been so\nuncongenial in accent and tone that she had hesitated about becoming my\ninstructor on that account. It was my evident appreciation of my\ndeficiencies as compared to them that had enlisted her sympathy.\n\nNow, in my own country, my voice had attracted attention by its\nsmoothness and modulation, and I was greatly surprised to hear Wauna\nspeak of its unmusical tone as really annoying. But then in Mizora there\nare no voices but what are sweet enough to charm the birds.\n\nIn the journeys that Wauna and I took during the college vacation, we\nwere constantly meeting strangers, but they never appeared the least\nsurprised at my dark hair and eyes, which were such a contrast to all\nthe other hair and eyes to be met with in Mizora, that I greatly\nwondered at it until I learned of the power of the reflector. I\nrequested permission to examine one of the large ones used in a theater,\nand it was granted me. Wauna accompanied me and signaled to a friend of\nhers. As if by magic a form appeared and moved across the stage. It\nbowed to me, smiled and motioned with its hand, to all appearances a\nmaterial body. I asked Wauna to approach it, which she did, and passed\nher hand through it. There was nothing that resisted her touch, yet I\nplainly saw the figure, and recognized it as the perfect representation\nof a friend of Wauna's, an actress residing in a distant city. When I\nascended the stage, the figure vanished, and I understood that it could\nbe visible only at a certain distance from the reflector.\n\nIn traveling great distances, or even short ones where great speed was\ndesired, the Mizoraens used air ships; but only for the transportation\nof passengers and the very lightest of freight. Heavy articles could not\nbe as conveniently carried by them as by railroads. Their railroads were\nconstructed and conducted on a system so perfect that accidents were\nnever known. Every engineer had an electric signal attached to the\nengine, that could signal a train three miles distant.\n\nThe motive power for nearly all engines was compressed air. Electricity,\nwhich was recognized by Mizora scientists as a force of great\nintensity, was rarely used as a propelling power on railroads. Its use\nwas attended by possible danger, but compressed air was not. Electricity\nproduced the heat that supplied the air ships and railroads with that\nvery necessary comfort. In case there should be an accident, as a\ncollision, or thrown from the track, heat could not be a source of\ndanger when furnished by electricity. But I never heard of a railroad\naccident during the whole fifteen years that I spent in Mizora.\n\nAir-ships, however, were not exempt from danger, although the\nprecautions against it were ingenious and carefully observed. The Mizora\npeople could tell the approach of a storm, and the exact time it would\narrive. They had signal stations established for the purpose, all over\nthe country.\n\nBut, though they were skilled mechanics, and far in advance of my own\nworld, and the limits of my comprehension in their scientific\ndiscoveries and appliances, they had not yet discovered the means of\nsubduing the elements, or driving unharmed through their fury. When\nnature became convulsed with passion, they guarded themselves against\nit, but did not endeavor to thwart it.\n\nTheir air-ships were covered, and furnished with luxurious seats. The\nwhole upper part of the car was composed of very thin glass. They\ntraveled with, to me, astonishing rapidity. Towns and cities flew away\nbeneath us like birds upon the wing. I grew frightened and apprehensive,\nbut Wauna chatted away with her friends with the most charming\nunconcern.\n\nI was looking down, when I perceived, by the increasing size of objects\nbelow, that we were descending. The conductor entered almost\nimmediately, and announced that we were going down to escape an\napproaching storm. A signal had been received and the ship was at once\nlowered.\n\nI felt intensely relieved to step again on solid earth, and hoped I\nmight escape another trial of the upper regions. But after waiting until\nthe storm was over we again entered the ship. I was ashamed to refuse\nwhen everyone else showed no fear.\n\nIn waiting for the storm to pass we were delayed so long that our\njourney could have been performed almost as speedily by rail. I wondered\nwhy they had not invented some means by which they could drive through a\ntempest in perfect safety. As usual, I addressed my inquiries to Wauna.\nShe answered:\n\n\"So frail a thing as an air-ship must necessarily be, when compared with\nthe strength of a storm, is like a leaf in the wind. We have not yet\ndiscovered, and we have but little expectation of discovering, any means\nby which we can defy the storms that rage in the upper deeps.\n\n\"The electricity that we use for heat is also a source of danger during\na storm. Our policy is to evade a peril we cannot control or destroy.\nHence, when we receive a signal that a storm is approaching we get out\nof its way. Our railroad carriages, having no danger to fear from them,\nride right through the storm.\"\n\nThe people of Mizora, I perceived, possessed a remarkable acuteness of\nvision. They could see the odor emanating from flowers and fruit. They\ndescribed it to me as resembling attenuated mist. They also named other\ncolors in the solar spectrum than those known to me. When I first heard\nthem speak of them, I thought it a freak of the imagination; but I\nafterward noticed artists, and persons who had a special taste for\ncolors, always detected them with greater readiness. The presence of\nthese new colors were apparent to all with whom I spoke upon the\nsubject. When I mentioned my own inability to discern them, Wauna said\nthat it was owning to my inferior mental development.\n\n\"A child,\" she said, \"if you will observe, is first attracted by red,\nthe most glaring color known. The untutored mind will invariably select\nthe gaudiest colors for personal adornment. It is the gentle, refined\ntaste of civilization that chooses the softened hues and colors.\"\n\n\"But you, as a nation, are remarkable for rich warm colors in your\nhouses and often in your dress,\" I said.\n\n\"But they are never glaring,\" she replied. \"If you will notice, the most\nintense colors are always so arranged as to present a halo, instead of\nsharply defined brilliancy. If a gorgeous color is worn as a dress, it\nwill be covered with filmy lace. You have spoken of the splendor of the\nAurora Borealis. It is nature's most gorgeous robe, and intense as the\nprimal colors are, they are never glaring. They glow in a film of vapor.\nWe have made them our study. Art, with us, has never attempted to\nsupercede nature.\"\n\nThe sense of smell was also exceedingly sensitive with the Mizora\npeople. They detected odors so refined that I was not aware of them. I\nhave often seen a chemist take a bottle of perfumery and name its\ningredients from the sense of smell only. No one appeared surprised at\nthe bluntness of my senses. When I spoke of this Wauna tried to explain\nit.\n\n\"We are a more delicately organized race of beings than you are. Our\nintellects, and even sense that we possess, is of a higher and finer\ndevelopment. We have some senses that you do not possess, and are unable\nto comprehend their exquisite delicacy. One of them I shall endeavor to\nexplain to you by describing it as impression. We possess it in a highly\nrefined state, both mentally and physically. Our sensitiveness to\nchanges of temperature, I have noticed, is more marked than yours. It is\nacute with all of my people. For this reason, although we are free from\ndisease, our bodies could not sustain, as readily as yours could, a\nsudden and severe shock to their normal temperature, such as a marked\nchange in the atmosphere would occasion. We are, therefore, extremely\ncareful to be always appropriately clothed. That is a physical\nimpression. It is possessed by you also, but more obtusely.\n\n\"Our sensitiveness to mental pleasure and pain you would pronounce\nmorbid on account of its intensity. The happiness we enjoy in the\nsociety of those who are congenial, or near and dear to us through\nfamily ties, is inconceivable to you. The touch of my mother's hand\ncarries a thrill of rapture with it.\n\n\"We feel, intuitively, the happiness or disappointment of those we are\nwith. Our own hopes impress us with their fulfillment or frustration,\nbefore we know what will actually occur. This feeling is entirely\nmental, but it is evidence of a highly refined mentality. We could not\nbe happy unless surrounded, as we are, by cultivated and elegant\npleasures. They are real necessities to us.\n\n\"Our appreciation of music, I notice, has a more exquisite delicacy than\nyours. You desire music, but it is the simpler operas that delight you\nmost. Those fine and delicate harmonies that we so intensely enjoy, you\nappear incapable of appreciating.\"\n\nI have previously spoken of their elegance in dress, and their fondness\nfor luxury and magnificence. On occasions of great ceremony their\ndresses were furnished with very long trains. The only prominent\ndifference that I saw in their state dresses, and the rare and costly\nones I had seen in my own and other countries, was in the waist. As the\nwomen of Mizora admired a large waist, their dresses were generally\nloose and flowing. Ingenuity, however, had fashioned them into graceful\nand becoming outlines. On occasions of great state and publicity,\ncomfortably fitting girdles confined the dress at the waist.\n\nI attended the Inaugural of a Professor of Natural History in the\nNational College. The one who had succeeded to this honor was widely\ncelebrated for her erudition. It was known that the ceremony would be a\ngrand affair, and thousands attended it.\n\nI there witnessed another of these marvelous achievements in science\nthat were constantly surprising me in Mizora. The inauguration took\nplace in a large hall, the largest I had ever seen. It would accommodate\ntwo hundred thousand people, and was filled to repletion. I was seated\nfar back in the audience, and being a little short-sighted anyway, I\nexpected to be disappointed both in seeing and hearing the ceremonies.\nWhat was my astonishment then, when they began, to discover that I could\nsee distinctly every object upon the stage, and hear with perfect\naccuracy every word that was uttered.\n\nUpon expressing myself to Wauna as being greatly pleased that my\neyesight and hearing had improved so wonderfully and unexpectedly, she\nlaughed merrily, and asked me if I had noticed a curious looking band of\npolished steel that curved outward from the proscenium, and encircled\nits entire front? I had noticed it, but supposed it to be connected with\nsome different arrangement they might have made concerning the\nfootlights. Wauna informed me that I owed my improved hearing to that.\n\n\"But my eyesight,\" I asked, \"how do you account for its unusual\npenetrativeness?\"\n\n\"Have you ever noticed some seasons of the year display a noticeably\nmarked transparency of the atmosphere that revealed objects at great\ndistances with unusual clearness? Well, we possess a knowledge of air\nthat enables us to qualify it with that peculiar magnifying condition.\nOn occasions like this we make use of it. This hall was built after the\ndiscovery, and was specially prepared for its use. It is seldom employed\nin smaller halls.\"\n\nJust then a little flutter of interest upon the stage attracted my\nattention, and I saw the candidate for the professorship entering,\naccompanied by the Faculty of the National College.\n\nShe wore a sea-green velvet robe with a voluminous train. The bottom of\nthe dress was adorned with a wreath or band of water lilies, embroidered\nin seed pearls. A white lace overdress of filmiest texture fell over the\nvelvet, almost touching the wreath of lilies, and looked as though it\nwas made of sea foam. A girdle of large pink pearls confined the robe at\nthe waist. Natural flowers were on her bosom and in her hair.\n\nThe stage was superbly decorated with flowers and shells. A large chair,\nconstructed of beautiful shells and cushioned with green velvet, rested\nupon a dais of coral. It was the chair of honor. Behind it was a curtain\nof sea-moss. I afterward learned that the moss was attached to a film of\nglass too delicate to detect without handling.\n\nIn the midst of these charming surroundings stood the applicant for\nhonor. Her deep blue eyes glowed with the joy of triumph. On the\ndelicate cheek and lip burned the carmine hue of perfect health. The\ngolden hair even seemed to have caught a brighter lustre in its coiled\nmasses. The uplifted hand and arm no marble goddess could have matched,\nfor this had the color and charm of life. As she stood revealed by the\nstrong light that fell around her, every feature ennobled with the glory\nof intellect, she appeared to me a creature of unearthly loveliness, as\nsomething divine.\n\nI spoke to Wauna of the rare beauty and elegance of her dress.\n\n\"She looks like a fabled Naiad just risen from the deep,\" was my\ncriticism on her.\n\n\"Her dress,\" answered Wauna, \"is intended to be emblematical of Nature.\nThe sea-green robe, the water lilies of pearls, the foamy lace are all\nfrom Nature's Cradle of Life.\"\n\n\"How poetical!\" I exclaimed.\n\nBut then Mizora is full of that charming skill that blends into perfect\nharmony the beautiful and useful in life.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\n\nOn my return to college, after the close of vacation, I devoted myself\nexclusively to history. It began with their first President; and from\nthe evidence of history itself, I knew that the Nation was enjoying a\nhigh state of culture when its history began.\n\nNo record of a more primitive race was to be found in all the Library,\nassiduously as I searched for it. I read with absorbing interest their\nprogress toward perfect enlightenment, their laborious searchings into\nscience that had resulted in such marvelous achievements. But earnestly\nas I sought for it, and anxiously as I longed for it, I found and heard\nno mention of a race of men. From the most intimate intercourse with the\npeople of Mizora, I could discover no attempt at concealment in\nanything, yet the inquiry _would_ crowd itself upon me. \"Where are the\nmen?\" And as constantly would I be forced to the conclusion that Mizora\nwas either a land of mystery beyond the scope of the wildest and\nweirdest fancy, or else they were utterly oblivious of such a race. And\nthe last conclusion was most improbable of all.\n\nMan, in my country, was a necessity of government, law, and protection.\nHis importance, (as I viewed it from inherited ideas) was incalculable.\nIt _could_ not be possible that he had no existence in a country so\neminently adapted to his desires and ability.\n\nThe expression, \"domestic misery,\" that the Preceptress made use of one\nday in conversation with me, haunted my imagination with a persistent\nsuspicion of mystery. It had a familiar sound to me. It intimated\nknowledge of a world _I_ knew so well; where ill-nature, malice, spite,\nenvy, deceit, falsehood and dishonesty, made life a continual anxiety.\n\nLocks, bolts and bars shut out the thief who coveted your jewels; but no\nbolts nor bars, however ingeniously constructed or strongly made, could\nkeep out the thief who coveted your character. One little word from a\npretended friend might consummate the sorrow of your whole life, and be\nwitnessed by the perpetrator without a pang--nay, even with exultation.\n\nThere were other miseries I thought of that were common in my country.\nThere were those we love. Some who are woven into our lives and\naffections by the kinship of blood; who grow up weak and vacillating,\nand are won away, sometimes through vice, to estrangement. Our hearts\nache not the less painfully that they have ceased to be worthy of a\nthrob; or that they have been weak enough to become estranged, to\nbenefit some selfish alien.\n\nThere were other sorrows in that world that I had come from, that\nbrought anguish alike to the innocent and the guilty. It was the sorrow\nof premature death. Diseases of all kinds made lives wretched; or tore\nthem asunder with death. How many hearts have ached with cankering pain\nto see those who are vitally dear, wasting away slowly, but surely, with\nunrelievable suffering; and to know that life but prolongs their misery,\nand death relieves it only with inconsolable grief for the living.\n\nWho has looked into a pair of youthful eyes, so lovely that imagination\ncould not invent for them another charm, and saw the misty film of death\ngather over them, while your heart ached with regret as bitter as it was\nunavailing. The soft snows of winter have fallen--a veil of purity--over\nthe new made graves of innocence and youth, and its wild winds have been\nthe saddest requiem. The dews of summer have wept with your tears, and\nits zephyrs have sighed over the mouldering loveliness of youth.\n\nI had known no skill in my world that could snatch from death its\nunlawful prey of youth. But here, in this land so eminently blessed, no\none regarded death as a dreaded invader of their household.\n\n\"_We cannot die until we get old_,\" said Wauna, naively.\n\nAnd looking upon their bounding animal spirits, their strong supple\nframes, and the rich, red blood of perfect health, mantling their cheeks\nwith its unsurpassable bloom, one would think that disease must have\nstrong grasp indeed that could destroy them.\n\nBut these were not all the sorrows that my own country knew. Crimes,\nwith which we had no personal connection, shocked us with their horrible\ndetails. They crept, like noxious vapors, into the moral atmosphere of\nthe pure and good; tainting the weak, and annoying the strong.\n\nThere were other sorrows in my country that were more deplorable still.\nIt was the fate of those who sought to relieve the sufferings of the\nmany by an enforced government reform. Misguided, imprudent and\nfanatical they might be, but their aim at least was noble. The wrongs\nand sufferings of the helpless and oppressed had goaded them to action\nfor their relief.\n\nBut, alas! The pale and haggard faces of thousands of those patriot\nsouls faded and wasted in torturing slowness in dungeons of rayless\ngloom. Or their emaciated and rheumatic frames toiled in speechless\nagony amid the horrors of Siberia's mines.\n\nIn _this_ land they would have been recognized as aspiring natures,\nspreading their wings for a nobler flight, seeking a higher and grander\nlife. The smile of beauty would have urged them on. Hands innumerable\nwould have given them a cordial and encouraging grasp. But in the land\nthey had sought to benefit and failed, they suffered in silence and\ndarkness, and died forgotten or cursed.\n\nMy heart and my brain ached with memory, and the thought again occurred:\n\"_Could_ the Preceptress ever have known such a race of people?\"\n\nI looked at her fair, calm brow, where not a wrinkle marred the serene\nexpression of intellect, although I had been told that more than a\nhundred years had touched with increasing wisdom its broad surface. The\nsmile that dwelt in her eyes, like the mystic sprite in the fountain,\nhad not a suspicion of sadness in them. A nature so lofty as hers, where\nevery feeling had a generous and noble existence and aim, could not have\nknown without anguish the race of people _I_ knew so well. Their sorrows\nwould have tinged her life with a continual sadness.\n\nThe words of Wauna had awakened a new thought. I knew that their mental\nlife was far above mine, and that in all the relations of life, both\nbusiness and social, they exhibited a refinement never attained by my\npeople. I had supposed these qualities to be an endowment of nature, and\nnot a development sought and labored for by themselves. But my\nconversation with Wauna had given me a different impression, and the\nthought of a future for my own country took possession of me.\n\n\"Could it ever emerge from its horrors, and rise through gradual but\nearnest endeavor to such perfection? Could a higher civilization crowd\nits sufferings out of existence and, in time, memory?\"\n\nI had never thought of my country having a claim upon me other than what\nI owed to my relatives and society. But in Mizora, where the very\natmosphere seemed to feed one's brain with grander and nobler ideas of\nlife and humanity, my nature had drank the inspiration of good deeds and\nimpulses, and had given the desire to work for something beside myself\nand my own kindred. I resolved that if I should ever again behold my\nnative country, I would seek the good of all its people along with that\nof my nearest and dearest of kin. But how to do it was a matter I could\nnot arrange. I felt reluctant to ask either Wauna or her mother. The\nguileless frankness of Wauna's nature was an impassable barrier to the\nconfidence of crimes and wretchedness. One glance of horror from her\ndark, sweet eyes, would have chilled me into painful silence and\nsorrowful regret.\n\nThe mystery that had ever surrounded these lovely and noble blonde women\nhad driven me into an unnatural reserve in regard to my own people and\ncountry. I had always perceived the utter absence of my allusion to the\nmasculine gender, and conceiving that it must be occasioned by some more\nthan ordinary circumstances, I refrained from intruding my curiosity.\n\nThat the singular absence of men was connected with nothing criminal or\nignoble on their part I felt certain; but that it was associated with\nsomething weird and mysterious I had now become convinced. My efforts to\ndiscover their whereabouts had been earnest and untiring. I had visited\na number of their large cities, and had enjoyed the hospitality of many\nprivate homes. I had examined every nook and corner of private and\npublic buildings, (for in Mizora nothing ever has locks) and in no place\nhad I ever discovered a trace or suggestion of man.\n\nWomen and girls were everywhere. Their fair faces and golden heads\ngreeted me in every town and city. Sometimes a pair of unusually dark\nblue eyes, like the color of a velvet-leaved pansy, looked out from an\nexquisitely tinted face framed in flossy golden hair, startling me with\nits unnatural loveliness, and then I would wonder anew:\n\n\"Why is such a paradise for man so entirely devoid of him?\"\n\nI even endeavored to discover from the conversation of young girls some\nallusion to the male sex. But listen as attentively and discreetly as I\ncould, not one allusion did I hear made to the mysteriously absent\nbeings. I was astonished that young girls, with cheeks like the downy\nbloom of a ripe peach, should chatter and laugh merrily over every\nconversational topic but that of the lords of society. The older and the\nwiser among women might acquire a depreciating idea of their worth, but\ninnocent and inexperienced girlhood was apt to surround that name with a\nhalo of romance and fancied nobility that the reality did not always\npossess. What, then, was my amazement to find _them_ indifferent and\nwholly neglectful of that (to me) very important class of beings.\n\nConjecture at last exhausted itself, and curiosity became indifferent.\nMizora, as a nation, or an individual representative, was incapable of\ndishonor. Whatever their secret I should make no farther effort to\ndiscover it. Their hospitality had been generous and unreserved. Their\ninfluence upon my character--morally--had been an incalculable benefit.\nI had enjoyed being among them. The rhythm of happiness that swept like\na strain of sweet music through all their daily life, touched a chord in\nmy own nature that responded.\n\nAnd when I contrasted the prosperity of Mizora--a prosperity that\nreached every citizen in its vast territory--with the varied phases of\nlife that are found in my own land, it urged me to inquire if there\ncould be hope for such happiness within its borders.\n\nTo the Preceptress, whose sympathies I knew were broad as the lap of\nnature, I at last went with my desire and perplexities. A sketch of my\ncountry's condition was the inevitable prelude. I gave it without once\nalluding to the presence of Man. She listened quietly and attentively.\nHer own land lay like a charming picture before her. I spoke of its\npeaceful happiness, its perfected refinement, its universal wealth, and\nparamount to all its other blessings, its complete ignorance of social\nills. With them, love did not confine itself to families, but encircled\nthe Nation in one embrace. How dismal, in contrast, was the land that\nhad given me birth.\n\n\"But one eminent distinction exists among us as a people,\" I added in\nconclusion. \"We are not all of one race.\"\n\nI paused and looked at the Preceptress. She appeared lost in reverie.\nHer expression was one of solicitude and approached nearer to actual\npain than anything I had ever noticed upon it before. She looked up and\ncaught my eye regarding her. Then she quietly asked:\n\n\"_Are there men in your country?_\"\n\n\n\n\nPART SECOND.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\n\nI answered in the affirmative, and further added that I had a husband\nand a son.\n\nThe effect of a confession so simple, and so natural, wounded and amazed\nme.\n\nThe Preceptress started back with a look of loathing and abhorrence; but\nit was almost instantly succeeded by one of compassion.\n\n\"You have much to learn,\" she said gently, \"and I desire not to judge\nyou harshly. _You_ are the product of a people far back in the darkness\nof civilization. _We_ are a people who have passed beyond the boundary\nof what was once called Natural Law. But, more correctly, we have become\nmistresses of Nature's peculiar processes. We influence or control them\nat will. But before giving you any further explanation I will show you\nthe gallery containing the portraits of our very ancient ancestors.\"\n\nShe then conducted me into a remote part of the National College, and\nsliding back a panel containing a magnificent painting, she disclosed a\nlong gallery, the existence of which I had never suspected, although I\nknew their custom of using ornamented sliding panels instead of doors.\nInto this I followed her with wonder and increasing surprise. Paintings\non canvas, old and dim with age; paintings on porcelain, and a peculiar\ntransparent material, of which I have previously spoken, hung so thick\nupon the wall you could not have placed a hand between them. They were\nall portraits of men. Some were represented in the ancient or mediaeval\ncostumes of my own ancestry, and some in garbs resembling our modern\nstyles.\n\nSome had noble countenances, and some bore on their painted visages the\nunmistakable stamp of passion and vice. It is not complimentary to\nmyself to confess it, but I began to feel an odd kind of companionship\nin this assembly of good and evil looking men, such as I had not felt\nsince entering this land of pre-eminently noble and lovely women.\n\nAs I gazed upon them, arrayed in the armor of some stern warrior, or the\nvelvet doublet of some gay cavalier, the dark eyes of a debonair knight\nlooked down upon me with familiar fellowship. There was pride of birth,\nand the passion of conquest in every line of his haughty, sensuous face.\nI seemed to breathe the same moral atmosphere that had surrounded me in\nthe outer world.\n\n_They_ had lived among noble and ignoble deeds I felt sure. _They_ had\nbeen swayed by conflicting desires. _They_ had known temptation and\nresistance, and reluctant compliance. _They_ had experienced the\ntreachery and ingratitude of humanity, and had dealt in it themselves.\n_They_ had known joy as I had known it, and their sorrow had been as my\nsorrows. _They_ had loved as I had loved, and sinned as I had sinned,\nand suffered as I had suffered.\n\nI wept for the first time since my entrance into Mizora, the bitter\ntears of actual experience, and endeavored to convey to the Preceptress\nsome idea of the painful emotion that possessed me.\n\n\"I have noticed,\" she said, \"in your own person and the descriptions you\nhave given of your native country, a close resemblance to the people and\nhistory of our nation in ages far remote. These portraits are very old.\nThe majority of them were painted many thousands of years ago. It is\nonly by our perfect knowledge of color that we are enabled to preserve\nthem. Some have been copied by expert artists upon a material\nmanufactured by us for that purpose. It is a transparent adamant that\npossesses no refractive power, consequently the picture has all the\nadvantage of a painting on canvas, with the addition of perpetuity. They\ncan never fade nor decay.\"\n\n\"I am astonished at the existence of this gallery,\" I exclaimed. \"I have\nobserved a preference for sliding panels instead of doors, and that they\nwere often decorated with paintings of rare excellence, but I had never\nsuspected the existence of this gallery behind one of them.\"\n\n\"Any student,\" said the Preceptress, \"who desires to become conversant\nwith our earliest history, can use this gallery. It is not a secret, for\nnothing in Mizora is concealed; but we do not parade its existence, nor\nurge upon students an investigation of its history. They are so far\nremoved from the moral imbecility that dwarfed the nature of these\npeople, that no lesson can be learned from their lives; and their time\ncan be so much more profitably spent in scientific research and study.\"\n\n\"You have not, then, reached the limits of scientific knowledge?\" I\nwonderingly inquired, for, to me, they had already overstepped its\nimaginary pale.\n\n\"When we do we shall be able to create intellect at will. We govern to a\ncertain extent the development of physical life; but the formation of\nthe brain--its intellectual force, or capacity I should say--is beyond\nour immediate skill. Genius is yet the product of long cultivation.\"\n\nI had observed that dark hair and eyes were as indiscriminately mingled\nin these portraits as I had been accustomed to find them in the living\npeople of my own and other countries. I drew the Preceptress' attention\nto it.\n\n\"We believe that the highest excellence of moral and mental character is\nalone attainable by a fair race. The elements of evil belong to the dark\nrace.\"\n\n\"And were the people of this country once of mixed complexions?\"\n\n\"As you see in the portraits? Yes,\" was the reply.\n\n\"And what became of the dark complexions?\"\n\n\"We eliminated them.\"\n\nI was too astonished to speak and stood gazing upon the handsome face of\na young man in a plumed hat and lace-frilled doublet. The dark eyes had\na haughty look, like a man proud of his lineage and his sex.\n\n\"Let us leave this place,\" said the Preceptress presently. \"It always\nhas a depressing effect upon me.\"\n\n\"In what way?\" I asked.\n\n\"By the degradation of the human race that they force me to recall.\"\n\nI followed her out to a seat on one of the small porticoes.\n\nIn candidly expressing herself about the dark complexions, my companion\nhad no intention or thought of wounding my feelings. So rigidly do they\nadhere to the truth in Mizora that it is of all other things\npre-eminent, and is never supposed to give offense. The Preceptress but\ngave expression to the belief inculcated by centuries of the teachings\nand practices of her ancestors. I was not offended. It was her\nconviction. Besides, I had the consolation of secretly disagreeing with\nher. I am still of the opinion that their admirable system of\ngovernment, social and political, and their encouragement and provision\nfor universal culture of so high an order, had more to do with the\nformation of superlative character than the elimination of the dark\ncomplexion.\n\nThe Preceptress remained silent a long time, apparently absorbed in the\nbeauty of the landscape that stretched before us. The falling waters of\na fountain was all the sound we heard. The hour was auspicious. I was so\neager to develop a revelation of the mystery about these people that I\nbecame nervous over my companion's protracted silence. I felt a delicacy\nin pressing inquiries concerning information that I thought ought to be\nvoluntarily given. Inquisitiveness was regarded as a gross rudeness by\nthem, and I could frame no question that I did not fear would sound\nimpertinent. But at last patience gave way and, at the risk of\nincreasing her commiseration for my barbarous mental condition, I asked:\n\n\"Are you conversant with the history of the times occupied by the\noriginals of the portraits we have just seen?\"\n\n\"I am,\" she replied.\n\n\"And would you object to giving me a condensed recital of it?\"\n\n\"Not if it can do you any good?\"\n\n\"What has become of their descendants--of those portraits?\"\n\n\"They became extinct thousands of years ago.\"\n\nShe became silent again, lost in reverie. The agitation of my mind was\nnot longer endurable. I was too near the acme of curiosity to longer\ndelay. I threw reserve aside and not without fear and trembling faltered\nout:\n\n\"Where are the men of this country? Where do they stay?\"\n\n_\"There are none_,\" was the startling reply. \"_The race became extinct\nthree thousand years ago._\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n\nI trembled at the suggestion of my own thoughts. Was this an enchanted\ncountry? Where the lovely blonde women fairies--or some weird beings of\ndifferent specie, human only in form? Or was I dreaming?\n\n\"I do not believe I understand you,\" I said. \"I never heard of a country\nwhere there were no men. In my land they are so very, very important.\"\n\n\"Possibly,\" was the placid answer.\n\n\"And you are really a nation of women?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"And have been for the last three thousand years.\"\n\n\"Will you tell me how this wonderful change came about?\"\n\n\"Certainly. But in order to do it, I must go back to our very remote\nancestry. The civilization that I shall begin with must have resembled\nthe present condition of your own country as you describe it. Prisons\nand punishments were prevalent throughout the land.\"\n\nI inquired how long prisons and places of punishment had been abolished\nin Mizora.\n\n\"For more than two thousand years,\" she replied. \"I have no personal\nknowledge of crime. When I speak of it, it is wholly from an historical\nstandpoint. A theft has not been committed in this country for many many\ncenturies. And those minor crimes, such as envy, jealousy, malice and\nfalsehood, disappeared a long time ago. You will not find a citizen in\nMizora who possesses the slightest trace of any of them.\n\n\"Did they exist in earlier times?\"\n\n\"Yes. Our oldest histories are but records of a succession of dramas in\nwhich the actors were continually striving for power and exercising all\nof those ancient qualities of mind to obtain it. Plots, intrigues,\nmurders and wars, were the active employments of the very ancient rulers\nof our land. As soon as death laid its inactivity upon one actor,\nanother took his place. It might have continued so; and we might still\nbe repeating the old tragedy but for one singular event. In the history\nof your own people you have no doubt observed that the very thing\nplotted, intrigued and labored for, has in accomplishment proved the\nruin of its projectors. You will remark this in the history I am about\nto relate.\n\n\"Main ages ago this country was peopled by two races--male and female.\nThe male race were rulers in public and domestic life. Their supremacy\nhad come down from pre-historic time, when strength of muscle was the\nonly master. Woman was a beast of burden. She was regarded as inferior\nto man, mentally as well as physically. This idea prevailed through\ncenturies of the earlier civilization, even after enlightenment had\nbrought to her a chivalrous regard from men. But this regard was\nbestowed only upon the women of their own household, by the rich and\npowerful. Those women who had not been fortunate enough to have been\nborn in such a sphere of life toiled early and late, in sorrow and\nprivation, for a mere pittance that was barely sufficient to keep the\nflame of life from going out. Their labor was more arduous than men's,\nand their wages lighter.\n\n\"The government consisted of an aristocracy, a fortunate few, who were\ncontinually at strife with one another to gain supremacy of power, or an\nacquisition of territory. Wars, famine and pestilence were of frequent\noccurrence. Of the subjects, male and female, some had everything to\nrender life a pleasure, while others had nothing. Poverty, oppression\nand wretchedness was the lot of the many. Power, wealth and luxury the\ndower of the few.\n\n\"Children came into the world undesired even by those who were able to\nrear them, and often after an attempt had been made to prevent their\ncoming alive. Consequently numbers of them were deformed, not only\nphysically, but mentally. Under these conditions life was a misery to\nthe larger part of the human race, and to end it by self-destruction was\ntaught by their religion to be a crime punishable with eternal torment\nby quenchless fire.\n\n\"But a revolution was at hand. Stinted toil rose up, armed and wrathful,\nagainst opulent oppression. The struggle was long and tragical, and was\nwaged with such rancor and desperate persistence by the\ninsurrectionists, that their women and children began to supply the\nplaces vacated by fallen fathers, husbands and brothers. It ended in\nvictory for them. They demanded a form of government that should be the\nproperty of all. It was granted, limiting its privileges to adult male\ncitizens.\n\n\"The first representative government lasted a century. In that time\ncivilization had taken an advance far excelling the progress made in\nthree centuries previous. So surely does the mind crave freedom for its\nperfect development. The consciousness of liberty is an ennobling\nelement in human nature. No nation can become universally moral until it\nis absolutely FREE.\n\n\"But this first Republic had been diseased from its birth. Slavery had\nexisted in certain districts of the nation. It was really the remains of\na former and more degraded state of society which the new government, in\nthe exultation of its own triumphant inauguration, neglected or lacked\nthe wisdom to remedy. A portion of the country refused to admit slavery\nwithin its territory, but pledged itself not to interfere with that\nwhich had. Enmities, however, arose between the two sections, which,\nafter years of repression and useless conciliation, culminated in\nanother civil war. Slavery had resolved to absorb more territory, and\nthe free territory had resolved that it should not. The war that\nfollowed in consequence severed forever the fetters of the slave and was\nthe primary cause of the extinction of the male race.\n\n\"The inevitable effect of slavery is enervating and demoralizing. It is\na canker that eats into the vitals of any nation that harbors it, no\nmatter what form it assumes. The free territory had all the vigor,\nwealth and capacity for long endurance that self-dependence gives. It\nwas in every respect prepared for a long and severe struggle. Its forces\nwere collected in the name of the united government.\n\n\"Considering the marked inequality of the combatants the war would\nnecessarily have been of short duration. But political corruption had\ncrept into the trust places of the government, and unscrupulous\npoliticians and office-seekers saw too many opportunities to harvest\nwealth from a continuation of the war. It was to their interest to\nprolong it, and they did. They placed in the most responsible positions\nof the army, military men whose incapacity was well known to them, and\nsustained them there while the country wept its maimed and dying sons.\n\n\"The slave territory brought to the front its most capable talent. It\nwould have conquered had not the resources against which it contended\nbeen almost unlimited. Utterly worn out, every available means of supply\nbeing exhausted, it collapsed from internal weakness.\n\n\"The general government, in order to satisfy the clamors of the\ndistressed and impatient people whose sons were being sacrificed, and\nwhose taxes were increasing, to prolong the war had kept removing and\nreinstating military commanders, but always of reliable incapacity.\n\n\"A man of mediocre intellect and boundless self-conceit happened to be\nthe commander-in-chief of the government army when the insurrection\ncollapsed. The politicians, whose nefarious scheming had prolonged the\nwar, saw their opportunity for furthering their own interests by\nsecuring his popularity. They assumed him to be the greatest military\ngenius that the world had ever produced; as evidenced by his success\nwhere so many others had failed. It was known that he had never risked a\nbattle until he was assured that his own soldiers were better equipped\nand outnumbered the enemy. But the politicians asserted that such a\nprecaution alone should mark him as an extraordinary military genius.\nThe deluded people accepted him as a hero.\n\n\"The politicians exhausted their ingenuity in inventing honors for him.\nA new office of special military eminence, with a large salary attached,\nwas created for him. He was burdened with distinctions and emoluments,\nalways worked by the politicians, for their benefit. The nation,\nfollowing the lead of the political leaders, joined in their adulation.\nIt failed to perceive the dangerous path that leads to anarchy and\ndespotism--the worship of one man. It had unfortunately selected one who\nwas cautious and undemonstrative, and who had become convinced that he\nreally was the greatest prodigy that the world had ever produced.\n\n\"He was made President, and then the egotism and narrow selfishness of\nthe man began to exhibit itself. He assumed all the prerogatives of\nroyalty that his position would permit. He elevated his obscure and\nnumerous relatives to responsible offices. Large salaries were paid them\nand intelligent clerks hired by the Government to perform their official\nduties.\n\n\"Corruption spread into every department, but the nation was blind to\nits danger. The few who did perceive the weakness and presumption of the\nhero were silenced by popular opinion.\n\n\"A second term of office was given him, and then the real character of\nthe man began to display itself before the people. The whole nature of\nthe man was selfish and stubborn. The strongest mental trait possessed\nby him was cunning.\n\n\"His long lease of power and the adulation of his political\nbeneficiaries, acting upon a superlative self-conceit, imbued him with\nthe belief that he had really rendered his country a service so\ninestimable that it would be impossible for it to entirely liquidate it.\nHe exalted to unsuitable public offices his most intimate friends. They\ngrew suddenly exclusive and aristocratic, forming marriages with eminent\nfamilies.\n\n\"He traveled about the country with his entire family, at the expense of\nthe Government, to gradually prepare the people for the ostentation of\nroyalty. The cities and towns that he visited furnished fetes,\nilluminations, parades and every variety of entertainment that could be\nthought of or invented for his amusement or glorification. Lest the\nparade might not be sufficiently gorgeous or demonstrative he secretly\nsent agents to prepare the programme and size of his reception, always\nat the expense of the city he intended to honor with his presence.\n\n\"He manifested a strong desire to subvert the will of the people to his\nwill. When informed that a measure he had proposed was unconstitutional,\nhe requested that the constitution be changed. His intimate friends he\nplaced in the most important and trustworthy positions under the\nGovernment, and protected them with the power of his own office.\n\n\"Many things that were distasteful and unlawful in a free government\nwere flagrantly flaunted in the face of the people, and were followed by\nother slow, but sure, approaches to the usurpation of the liberties of\nthe Nation. He urged the Government to double his salary as President,\nand it complied.\n\n\"There had long existed a class of politicians who secretly desired to\nconvert the Republic into an Empire, that they might secure greater\npower and opulence. They had seen in the deluded enthusiasm of the\npeople for one man, the opportunity for which they had long waited and\nschemed. He was unscrupulous and ambitious, and power had become a\nnecessity to feed the cravings of his vanity.\n\n\"The Constitution of the country forbade the office of President to be\noccupied by one man for more than two terms. The Empire party proposed\nto amend it, permitting the people to elect a President for any number\nof terms, or for life if they choose. They tried to persuade the people\nthat the country owed the greatest General of all time so distinctive an\nhonor. They even claimed that it was necessary to the preservation of\nthe Government; that his popularity could command an army to sustain him\nif he called for it.\n\n\"But the people had begun to penetrate the designs of the hero, and\nbitterly denounced his resolution to seek a third term of power. The\nterrible corruptions that had been openly protected by him, had\nadvertised him as criminally unfit for so responsible an office. But,\nalas! the people had delayed too long. They had taken a young elephant\ninto the palace. They had petted and fed him and admired his bulky\ngrowth, and now they could not remove him without destroying the\nbuilding.\n\n\"The politicians who had managed the Government so long, proved that\nthey had more power than the people They succeeded, by practices that\nwere common with politicians in those days, in getting him nominated for\na third term. The people, now thoroughly alarmed, began to see their\npast folly and delusion. They made energetic efforts to defeat his\nelection. But they were unavailing. The politicians had arranged the\nballot, and when the counts were published, the hero was declared\nPresident for life. When too late the deluded people discovered that\nthey had helped dig the grave for the corpse of their civil liberty, and\nthose who were loyal and had been misled saw it buried with unavailing\nregret. The undeserved popularity bestowed upon a narrow and selfish\nnature had been its ruin. In his inaugural address he declared that\nnothing but the will of the people governed him. He had not desired the\noffice; public life was distasteful to him, yet he was willing to\nsacrifice himself for the good of his country.\n\n\"Had the people been less enlightened, they might have yielded without a\nmurmur; but they had enjoyed too long the privileges of a free\nGovernment to see it usurped without a struggle. Tumult and disorder\nprevailed over the country. Soldiers were called out to protect the new\nGovernment, but numbers of them refused to obey. The consequence was\nthey fought among themselves. A dissolution of the Government was the\nresult. The General they had lauded so greatly failed to bring order out\nof chaos; and the schemers who had foisted him into power, now turned\nupon him with the fury of treacherous natures when foiled of their prey.\nInnumerable factions sprung up all over the land, each with a leader\nambitious and hopeful of subduing the whole to his rule. They fought\nuntil the extermination of the race became imminent, when a new and\nunsuspected power arose and mastered.\n\n\"The female portion of the nation had never had a share in the\nGovernment. Their privileges were only what the chivalry or kindness of\nthe men permitted. In law, their rights were greatly inferior. The evils\nof anarchy fell with direct effect upon them. At first, they organized\nfor mutual protection from the lawlessness that prevailed. The\norganizations grew, united and developed into military power. They used\ntheir power wisely, discreetly, and effectively. With consummate skill\nand energy they gathered the reins of Government in their own hands.\n\n\"Their first aim had been only to force the country into peace. The\nanarchy that reigned had demoralized society, and they had suffered\nmost. They had long pleaded for an equality of citizenship with men, but\nhad pleaded in vain. They now remembered it, and resolved to keep the\nGovernment that their wisdom and power had restored. They had been\nhampered in educational progress. Colleges and all avenues to higher\nintellectual development had been rigorously closed against them. The\nprofessional pursuits of life were denied them. But a few, with sublime\ncourage and energy, had forced their way into them amid the revilings of\nsome of their own sex and opposition of the men. It was these brave\nspirits who had earned their liberal cultivation with so much\ndifficulty, that had organized and directed the new power. They\ngenerously offered to form a Government that should be the property of\nall intelligent adult citizens, not criminal.\n\n\"But these wise women were a small minority. The majority were ruled by\nthe remembrance of past injustice. _They_ were now the power, and\ndeclared their intention to hold the Government for a century.\n\n\"They formed a Republic, in which they remedied many of the defects that\nhad marred the Republic of men. They constituted the Nation an integer\nwhich could never be disintegrated by States' Rights ideas or the\nassumption of State sovereignty.\n\n\"They proposed a code of laws for the home government of the States,\nwhich every State in the Union ratified as their State Constitution,\nthus making a uniformity and strength that the Republic of men had never\nknown or suspected attainable.\n\n\"They made it a law of every State that criminals could be arrested in\nany State they might flee to, without legal authority, other than that\nobtained in the vicinity of the crime. They made a law that criminals,\ntried and convicted of crime, could not be pardoned without the sanction\nof seventy-five out of one hundred educated and disinterested people,\nwho should weigh the testimony and render their decision under oath. It\nis scarcely necessary to add that few criminals ever were pardoned. It\nremoved from the office of Governor the responsibility of pardoning, or\nrejecting pardons as a purely personal privilege. It abolished the\npower of rich criminals to bribe their escape from justice; a practice\nthat had secretly existed in the former Republic.\n\n\"In forming their Government, the women, who were its founders, profited\nlargely by the mistakes or wisdom displayed in the Government of men.\nNeither the General Government, nor the State Government, could be\nindependent of the other. A law of the Union could not become such until\nratified by every State Legislature. A State law could not become\nconstitutional until ratified by Congress.\n\n\"In forming the State Constitutions, laws were selected from the\ndifferent State Constitutions that had proven wise for State Government\nduring the former Republic. In the Republic of men, each State had made\nand ratified its own laws, independent of the General Government. The\nconsequence was, no two States possessed similar laws.\n\n\"To secure strength and avoid confusion was the aim of the founders of\nthe new Government. The Constitution of the National Government provided\nfor the exclusion of the male sex from all affairs and privileges for a\nperiod of one hundred years.\n\n\"_At the end of that time not a representative of the sex was in\nexistence._\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\n\nI expressed my astonishment at her revelation. Their social life existed\nunder conditions that were incredible to me. Would it be an impertinence\nto ask for an explanation that I might comprehend? Or was it really the\none secret they possessed and guarded from discovery, a mystery that\nmust forever surround them with a halo of doubt, the suggestion of\nuncanny power? I spoke as deprecatingly as I could. The Preceptress\nturned upon me a calm but penetrating gaze.\n\n\"Have we impressed you as a mysterious people?\" she asked.\n\n\"Very, very much!\" I exclaimed. \"I have at times been oppressed by it.\"\n\n\"You never mentioned it,\" she said, kindly.\n\n\"I could not find an opportunity to,\" I said.\n\n\"It is the custom in Mizora, as you have no doubt observed, never to\nmake domestic affairs a topic of conversation outside of the family, the\nonly ones who would be interested in them; and this refinement has kept\nyou from the solution of our social system. I have no hesitancy in\ngratifying your wish to comprehend it. The best way to do it is to let\nhistory lead up to it, if you have the patience to listen.\"\n\nI assured her that I was anxious to hear all she chose to tell. She then\nresumed:\n\n\"The prosperity of the country rapidly increased under the rule of the\nfemale Presidents. The majority of them were in favor of a high state of\nmorality, and they enforced it by law and practice. The arts and\nsciences were liberally encouraged and made rapid advancement. Colleges\nand schools flourished vigorously, and every branch of education was now\nopen to women.\n\n\"During the Republic of men, the government had founded and sustained a\nmilitary and naval academy, where a limited number of the youth of the\ncountry were educated at government expense. The female government\nre-organized the institutions, substituting the youth of their own sex.\nThey also founded an academy of science, which was supplied with every\nfacility for investigation and progress. None but those having a marked\npredilection for scientific research could obtain admission, and then it\nwas accorded to demonstrated ability only. This drew to the college the\nbest female talent in the country. The number of applicants was not\nlimited.\n\n\"Science had hitherto been, save by a _very_ few, an untrodden field to\nwomen, but the encouragement and rare facilities offered soon revealed\nlatent talent that developed rapidly. Scarcely half a century had\nelapsed before the pupils of the college had effected by their\ndiscoveries some remarkable changes in living, especially in the\nprevention and cure of diseases.\n\n\"However prosperous they might become, they could not dwell in political\nsecurity with a portion of the citizens disfranchised. The men were\nresolved to secure their former power. Intrigues and plots against the\ngovernment were constantly in force among them. In order to avert\nanother civil war, it was finally decided to amend the constitution, and\ngive them an equal share in the ballot. They had no sooner obtained that\nthan the old practices of the former Republic were resorted to to secure\ntheir supremacy in government affairs. The women looked forward to their\nformer subjugation as only a matter of time, and bitterly regretted\ntheir inability to prevent it. But at the crisis, a prominent scientist\nproposed to let the race die out. Science had revealed the Secret of\nLife.\"\n\nShe ceased speaking, as though I fully understood her.\n\n\"I am more bewildered than ever,\" I exclaimed. \"I cannot comprehend\nyou.\"\n\n\"Come with me,\" she said.\n\nI followed her into the Chemist's Laboratory. She bade me look into a\nmicroscope that she designated, and tell her what I saw.\n\n\"An exquisitely minute cell in violent motion,\" I answered.\n\n\"Daughter,\" she said, solemnly, \"you are now looking upon the germ of\n_all_ Life, be it animal or vegetable, a flower or a human being, it has\nthat one common beginning. We have advanced far enough in Science to\ncontrol its development. Know that the MOTHER is the only important part\nof all life. In the lowest organisms no other sex is apparent.\"\n\nI sat down and looked at my companion in a frame of mind not easily\ndescribed. There was an intellectual grandeur in her look and mien that\nwas impressive. Truth sat, like a coronet, upon her brow. The revelation\nI had so longed for, I now almost regretted. It separated me so far from\nthese beautiful, companionable beings.\n\n\"Science has instructed you how to supercede Nature,\" I said, finally.\n\n\"By no means. It has only taught us how to make her obey us. We cannot\n_create_ Life. We cannot develop it. But we can control Nature's\nprocesses of development as we will. Can you deprecate such a power?\nWould not your own land be happier without idiots, without lunatics,\nwithout deformity and disease?\"\n\n\"You will give me little hope of any radical change in my own lifetime\nwhen I inform you that deformity, if extraordinary, becomes a source of\nrevenue to its possessor.\"\n\n\"All reforms are of slow growth,\" she said. \"The moral life is the\nhighest development of Nature. It is evolved by the same slow processes,\nand like the lower life, its succeeding forms are always higher ones.\nIts ultimate perfection will be mind, where all happiness shall dwell,\nwhere pleasure shall find fruition, and desire its ecstasy.\n\n\"It is the duty of every generation to prepare the way for a higher\ndevelopment of the next, as we see demonstrated by Nature in the\nfossilized remains of long extinct animal life, a preparatory condition\nfor a higher form in the next evolution. If you do not enjoy the fruit\nof your labor in your own lifetime, the generation that follows you will\nbe the happier for it. Be not so selfish as to think only of your own\nnarrow span of life.\"\n\n\"By what means have you reached so grand a development?\" I asked.\n\n\"By the careful study of, and adherence to, Nature's laws. It was long\nyears--I should say centuries--before the influence of the coarser\nnature of men was eliminated from the present race.\n\n\"We devote the most careful attention to the Mothers of our race. No\nretarding mental or moral influences are ever permitted to reach her. On\nthe contrary, the most agreeable contacts with nature, all that can\ncheer and ennoble in art or music surround her. She is an object of\ninterest and tenderness to all who meet her. Guarded from unwholesome\nagitation, furnished with nourishing and proper diet--both mental and\nphysical--the child of a Mizora mother is always an improvement upon\nherself. With us, childhood has no sorrows. We believe, and the present\ncondition of our race proves, that a being environed from its birth with\nnone but elevating influences, will grow up amiable and intelligent\nthough inheriting unfavorable tendencies.\n\n\"On this principle we have ennobled our race and discovered the means of\nprolonging life and youthful loveliness far beyond the limits known by\nour ancestors.\n\n\"Temptation and necessity will often degrade a nature naturally inclined\nand desirous to be noble. We early recognized this fact, and that a\nnature once debased by crime would transmit it to posterity. For this\nreason we never permitted a convict to have posterity.\"\n\n\"But how have you become so beautiful?\" I asked. \"For, in all my\njourneys, I have not met an uncomely face or form. On the contrary, all\nthe Mizora women have perfect bodies and lovely features.\"\n\n\"We follow the gentle guidance of our mother, Nature. Good air and\njudicious exercise for generations and generations before us have\nhelped. Our ancestors knew the influence of art, sculpture, painting and\nmusic, which they were trained to appreciate.\"\n\n\"But has not nature been a little generous to you?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Not more so than she will be to any people who follow her laws. When\nyou first came here you had an idea that you could improve nature by\ncrowding your lungs and digestive organs into a smaller space than she,\nthe maker of them, intended them to occupy.\n\n\"If you construct an engine, and then cram it into a box so narrow and\ntight that it cannot move, and then crowd on the motive power, what\nwould you expect?\n\n\"Beautiful as you think my people, and as they really are, yet, by\ndisregarding nature's laws, or trying to thwart her intentions, in a few\ngenerations to come, perhaps even in the next, we could have coarse\nfeatures and complexions, stoop shoulders and deformity.\n\n\"It has required patience, observation and care on the part of our\nancestors to secure to us the priceless heritage of health and perfect\nbodies. Your people can acquire them by the same means.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\n     As to Physical causes, I am inclined to doubt altogether of their\n     operation in this particular; nor do I think that men owe anything\n     of their temper or genius to the air, food, or climate.--_Bacon._\n\n\nI listened with the keenest interest to this curious and instructive\nhistory; and when the Preceptress had ceased speaking. I expressed my\ngratitude for her kindness. There were many things about which I desired\ninformation, but particularly their method of eradicating disease and\ncrime. These two evils were the prominent afflictions of all the\ncivilized nations I knew. I believed that I could comprehend enough of\ntheir method of extirpation to benefit my own country. Would she kindly\ngive it?\n\n\"I shall take Disease first,\" she said, \"as it is a near relative of\nCrime. You look surprised. You have known life-long and incurable\ninvalids who were not criminals. But go to the squalid portion of any of\nyour large cities, where Poverty and Disease go hand in hand, where the\nchild receives its life and its first nourishment from a haggard and\ndiscontented mother. Starvation is her daily dread. The little\ntendernesses that make home the haven of the heart, are never known to\nher. Ill-fed, ill-clothed, ill-cherished, all that _might_ be refined\nand elevated in her nature, if properly cultivated, is choked into\nstarveling shapes by her enemy--Want.\n\n\"If you have any knowledge of nature, ask yourself if such a condition\nof birth and infancy is likely to produce a noble, healthy human being?\nDo your agriculturists expect a stunted, neglected tree to produce rare\nand luscious fruit?\"\n\nI was surprised at the Preceptress' graphic description of wretchedness,\nso familiar to all the civilized nations that I knew, and asked:\n\n\"Did such a state of society ever exist in this country?\"\n\n\"Ages ago it was as marked a social condition of this land as it is of\nyour own to-day. The first great move toward eradicating disease was in\nproviding clean and wholesome food for the masses. It required the\nutmost rigor of the law to destroy the pernicious practice of\nadulteration. The next endeavor was to crowd poverty out of the land. In\norder to do this the Labor question came first under discussion, and\nresulted in the establishment in every state of a Board of Arbitration\nthat fixed the price of labor on a per cent, of the profits of the\nbusiness. Public and private charities were forbidden by law as having\nan immoral influence upon society. Charitable institutions had long been\nnumerous and fashionable, and many persons engaged in them as much for\ntheir own benefit as that of the poor. It was not always the honest and\nbenevolent ones who became treasurers, nor were the funds always\ndistributed among the needy and destitute, or those whom they were\ncollected for. The law put a stop to the possibility of such frauds, and\nof professional impostors seeking alms. Those who needed assistance were\nsupplied with work--respectable, independent work--furnished by the city\nor town in which they resided. A love of industry, its dignity and\nindependence, was carefully instilled into every young mind. There is no\ncountry but what ought to provide for everyone of its citizens a\ncomfortable, if not luxurious, home by humane legislation on the labor\nquestion.\n\n\"The penitentiaries were reconstructed by the female government. One\nhalf the time formerly allotted to labor was employed in compulsory\neducation. Industrial schools were established in every State, where all\nthe mechanical employments were taught free. Objects of charity were\nsent there and compelled to become self supporting. These industrial\nschools finally became State Colleges, where are taught, free, all the\nknown branches of knowledge, intellectual and mechanical.\n\n\"Pauperism disappeared before the wide reaching influence of these\nindustrial schools, but universal affluence had not come. It could not\nexist until education had become universal.\n\n\"With this object in view, the Government forbade the employment of any\ncitizen under the age of twenty-one, and compelled their attendance at\nschool up to that time. At the same time a law was passed that\nauthorized the furnishing of all school-room necessaries out of the\npublic funds. If a higher education were desired the State Colleges\nfurnished it free of all expenses contingent.\n\n\"All of these measures had a marked influence in improving the\ncondition of society, but not all that was required. The necessity for\nstrict sanitary laws became obvious. Cities and towns and even farms\nwere visited, and everything that could breed malaria, or produce impure\nair, was compelled to be removed. Personal and household cleanliness at\nlast became an object of public interest, and inspectors were appointed\nwho visited families and reported the condition of their homes. All\nkinds of out-door sports and athletic exercises were encouraged and\nbecame fashionable.\n\n\"All of these things combined, made a great improvement in the health\nand vigor of our race, but still hereditary diseases lingered.\n\n\"There were many so enfeebled by hereditary disease they had not enough\nenergy to seek recuperation, and died, leaving offspring as wretched,\nwho in turn followed their parents' example.\n\n\"Statistics were compiled, and physician's reports circulated, until a\nlaw was passed prohibiting the perpetuity of diseased offspring. But,\nalthough disease became less prevalent, it did not entirely disappear.\nThe law could only reach the most deplorable afflictions, and was\neventually repealed.\n\n\"As the science of therapeutics advanced, all diseases--whether\nhereditary or acquired--were found to be associated with abnormal\nconditions of the blood. A microscopic examination of a drop of blood\nenabled the scientist to determine the character and intensity of any\ndisease, and at last to effect its elimination from the system.\n\n\"The blood is the primal element of the body. It feeds the flesh, the\nnerves, the muscles, the brain. Disease cannot exist when it is in a\nnatural condition. Countless experiments have determined the exact\nproperties of healthy blood and how to produce it. By the use of this\nknowledge we have eliminated hereditary diseases, and developed into a\nhealthy and moral people. For people universally healthy is sure of\nbeing moral. Necessity begets crime. It is the _wants_ of the ignorant\nand debased that suggests theft. It is a diseased fancy, or a mind\nignorant of the laws that govern the development of human nature, that\ncould attribute to offspring hated before birth: infancy and childhood\nneglected; starved, ill-used in every way, a disposition and character,\namiable and humane and likely to become worthy members of society. The\nreverse is almost inevitable. Human nature relapses into the lower and\nbaser instincts of its earlier existence, when neglected, ill-used and\n_ignorant_. All of those lovely traits of character which excite the\nenthusiast, such as gratitude, honor, charity are the results of\neducation only. They are not the natural instincts of the human mind,\nbut the cultivated ones.\n\n\"The most rigid laws were passed in regard to the practice of medicine.\nNo physician could become a practitioner until examined and authorized\nto do so by the State Medical College. In order to prevent favoritism,\nor the furnishing of diplomas to incompetent applicants, enormous\npenalties were incurred by any who would sign such. The profession long\nago became extinct. Every mother is a family physician. That is, she\nobeys the laws of nature in regard to herself and her children, and they\nnever need a doctor.\n\n\"Having become healthy and independent of charity, crime began to\ndecrease naturally. The conditions that had bred and fostered petty\ncrimes having ceased to exist, the natures that had inherited them rose\nabove their influence in a few generations, and left honorable\nposterity.\n\n\"But crime in its grossest form is an ineradicable hereditary taint.\nGeneration after generation may rise and disappear in a family once\ntainted with it, without displaying it, and then in a most unexpected\nmanner it will spring up in some descendant, violent and unconquerable.\n\n\"We tried to eliminate it as we had disease, but failed. It was an\ninherited molecular structure of the brain. Science could not\nreconstruct it. The only remedy was annihilation. Criminals had no\nposterity.\"\n\n\"I am surprised,\" I interrupted, \"that possessing the power to control\nthe development of the body, you should not do so with the mind.\"\n\n\"If we could we would produce genius that could discover the source of\nall life. We can control Cause and Effect, but we cannot create Cause.\nWe do not even know its origin. What the perfume is to the flower, the\nintellect is to the body; a secret that Nature keeps to herself. For a\nthousand years our greatest minds have sought to discover its source,\nand we are as far from it to-day as we were a thousand years ago.\"\n\n\"How then have you obtained your mental superiority?\" I inquired.\n\n\"By securing to our offspring perfect, physical and mental health.\nScience has taught us how to evolve intellect by following demonstrated\nlaws. I put a seed into the ground and it comes up a little green slip,\nthat eventually becomes a tree. When I planted the seed in congenial\nsoil, and watered and tended the slip, I assisted Nature. But I did not\ncreate the seed nor supply the force that made it develop into a tree,\nnor can I define that force.\"\n\n\"What has produced the exquisite refinement of your people?\"\n\n\"Like everything else, it is the result of gradual development aiming\nat higher improvement. By following strictly the laws that govern the\nevolution of life, we control the formation of the body and brain.\nStrong mental traits become intensified by cultivation from generation\nto generation and finally culminate in one glorious outburst of power,\ncalled Genius. But there is one peculiarity about mind. It resembles\nthat wonderful century plant which, after decades of developing, flowers\nand dies. Genius is the long unfolding bloom of mind, and leaves no\nposterity. We carefully prepare for the future development of Genius. We\nknow that our children will be neither deformed nor imbecile, but we\nwatch the unfolding of their intellects with the interest of a new\nrevelation. We guide them with the greatest care.\n\n\"I could take a child of your people with inherited weakness of body and\nmind. I should rear it on proper food and exercise--both mental and\nphysical--and it would have, when matured, a marked superiority to its\nparents. It is not what Nature has done for us, it is what we have done\nfor her, that makes us a race of superior people.\"\n\n\"The qualities of mind that are the general feature of your people,\" I\nremarked, \"are so very high, higher than our estimate of Genius. How was\nit arrived at?\"\n\n\"By the processes I have just explained. Genius is always a leader. A\ngenius with us has a subtlety of thought and perception beyond your\npower of appreciation. All organized social bodies move intellectually\nin a mass, with their leader just ahead of them.\"\n\n\"I have visited, as a guest, a number of your families, and found their\nhomes adorned with paintings and sculpture that would excite wondering\nadmiration in my own land as rare works of art, but here they are only\nthe expression of family taste and culture. Is that a quality of\nintellect that has been evolved, or is it a natural endowment of your\nrace?\"\n\n\"It is not an endowment, but has been arrived at by the same process of\ncareful cultivation. Do you see in those ancient portraits a variety of\nstriking colors? There is not a suggestion of harmony in any of them. On\nthe contrary, they all display violent contrasts of color. The originals\nof them trod this land thousands of years ago. Many of the colors, we\nknow, were unknown to them. Color is a faculty of the mind that is\nwholly the result of culture. In the early ages of society, it was known\nonly in the coarsest and most brilliant hues. A conception and\nappreciation of delicate harmonies in color is evidence of a superior\nand refined mentality. If you will notice it, the illiterate of your\nown land have no taste for or idea of the harmony of color. It is the\nsame with sound. The higher we rise in culture, the more difficult we\nare to please in music. Our taste becomes critical.\"\n\nI had been revolving some things in my mind while the Preceptress was\nspeaking, and I now ventured to express them. I said:\n\n\"You tell me that generations will come and go before a marked change\ncan occur in a people. What good then would it do me or mine to study\nand labor and investigate in or to teach my people how to improve? They\ncan not comprehend progress. They have not learned by contact, as I have\nin Mizora, how to appreciate it. I should only waste life and happiness\nin trying to persuade them to get out of the ruts they have traveled so\nlong; they think there are no other roads. I should be reviled, and\nperhaps persecuted. My doctrines would be called visionary and\nimpracticable. I think I had better use my knowledge for my own kindred,\nand let the rest of the world find out the best way it can.\"\n\nThe Preceptress looked at me with mild severity. I never before had seen\nso near an approach to rebuke in her grand eyes.\n\n\"What a barbarous, barbarous idea!\" she exclaimed. \"Your country will\nnever rise above its ignorance and degradation, until out of its mental\nagony shall be evolved a nature kindled with an ambition that burns for\nHumanity instead of self. It will be the nucleus round which will gather\nthe timid but anxious, and _then_ will be lighted that fire which no\nwaters can quench. It burns for the liberty of thought. Let human nature\nonce feel the warmth of its beacon fires, and it will march onward,\ndefying all obstacles, braving all perils till it be won. Human nature\nis ever reaching for the unattained. It is that little spark within us\nthat has an undying life. When we can no longer use it, it flies\nelsewhere.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\n\nI had long contemplated a trip to the extreme southern boundary of\nMizora. I had often inquired about it, and had always been answered that\nit was defined by an impassable ocean. I had asked them to describe it\nto me, for the Mizora people have a happy faculty of employing tersely\nexpressive language when necessary; but I was always met with the\nsurprising answer that no tongue in Mizora was eloquent enough to\nportray the wonders that bounded Mizora on the south. So I requested the\nPreceptress to permit Wauna to accompany me as a guide and companion; a\nrequest she readily complied with.\n\n\"Will you be afraid or uneasy about trusting her on so long a journey\nwith no companion or protector but me?\" I asked.\n\nThe Preceptress smiled at my question.\n\n\"Why should I be afraid, when in all the length and breadth of our land\nthere is no evil to befall her, or you either. Strangers are friends in\nMizora, in one sense of the word, when they meet. You will both travel\nas though among time endeared associates. You will receive every\nattention, courtesy and kindness that would be bestowed upon near and\nintimate acquaintances. No, in this land, mothers do not fear to send\ntheir daughters alone and unrecommended among strangers.\"\n\nWhen speed was required, the people of Mizora traveled altogether by air\nships. But when the pleasure of landscape viewing, and the delight and\nexhilaration of easy progress is desired, they use either railroad cars\nor carriages.\n\nWauna and I selected an easy and commodious carriage. It was propelled\nby compressed air, which Wauna said could be obtained whenever we needed\na new supply at any village or country seat.\n\nThroughout the length and breadth of Mizora the roads were artificially\nmade. Cities, towns, and villages were provided with paved streets,\nwhich the public authorities kept in a condition of perfect cleanliness.\nThe absence of all kinds of animals rendered this comparatively easy. In\nalluding to this once in the presence of the Preceptress, she startled\nme by the request that I should suggest to my people the advantage to be\nderived from substituting machinery for animal labor.\n\n\"The association of animals is degrading,\" she asserted. \"And you, who\nstill live by tilling the soil, will find a marked change economically\nin dispensing with your beasts of burden. Fully four-fifths that you\nraise on your farms is required to feed your domestic animals. If your\nagriculture was devoted entirely to human food, it would make it more\nplentiful for the poor.\"\n\nI did not like to tell her that I knew many wealthy people who housed\nand fed their domestic animals better than they did their tenants. She\nwould have been disgusted with such a state of barbarism.\n\nCountry roads in Mizora were usually covered with a cement that was\nprepared from pulverized granite. They were very durable and very hard.\nOwing to their solidity, they were not as agreeable for driving as\nanother kind of cement they manufactured. I have previously spoken of\nthe peculiar style of wheel that was used on all kinds of light\nconveyances in Mizora, and rendered their progress over any road the\nvery luxury of motion.\n\nIn our journey, Wauna took me to a number of factories, where the\nwonderful progress they had made in science continually surprised and\ndelighted me. The spider and the silkworm had yielded their secret to\nthese indefatigable searchers into nature's mysteries. They could spin a\nthread of gossamer, or of silk from their chemicals, of any width and\nlength, and with a rapidity that was magical. Like everything else of\nthat nature in Mizora, these discoveries had been purchased by the\nGovernment, and then made known to all.\n\nThey also manufactured ivory that I could not tell from the real\narticle. I have previously spoken of their success in producing various\nkinds of marble and stone. A beautiful table that I saw made out of\nartificial ivory, had a painting upon the top of it. A deep border,\ncomposed of delicate, convoluted shells, extended round the top of the\ntable and formed the shores of a mimic ocean, with coral reefs and tiny\nislands, and tangled sea-weeds and shining fishes sporting about in the\npellucid water. The surface was of highly polished smoothness, and I was\ninformed that the picture was _not_ a painting but was formed of\ncolored particles of ivory that had been worked in before the drying or\nsolidifying process had been applied. In the same way they formed main\nbeautiful combinations of marbles. The magnificent marble columns that\nsupported the portico of my friend's house were all of artificial make.\nThe delicate green leaves and creeping vines of ivy, rose, and\neglantine, with their spray-like blossoms, were colored in the\nmanufacturing process and chiseled out of the solid marble by the\nskillful hand of the artist.\n\nIt would be difficult for me to even enumerate all the beautiful arts\nand productions of arts that I saw in Mizora. Our journey was full of\nincidents of this kind.\n\nEvery city and town that we visited was like the introduction of a new\npicture. There was no sameness between any of them. Each had aimed at\npicturesqueness or stately magnificence, and neither had failed to\nobtain it. Looking back as I now do upon Mizora, it presents itself to\nme as a vast and almost limitless landscape, variegated with grand\ncities, lovely towns and villages, majestic hills and mountains crowned\nwith glittering snows, or deep, delightful valleys veiled in scented\nvines.\n\nKindness, cordiality and courtesy met us on every side. It was at first\nquite novel for me to mingle among previously unheard-of people with\nsuch sociability, but I did as Wauna did, and I found it not only\nconvenient but quite agreeable.\n\n\"I am the daughter of the Preceptress of the National College,\" said\nWauna; and that was the way she introduced herself.\n\nI noticed with what honor and high esteem the name of the Preceptress\nwas regarded. As soon as it was known that the daughter of the\nPreceptress had arrived, the citizens of whatever city we had stopped in\nhastened to extend to her every courtesy and favor possible for them to\nbestow. She was the daughter of the woman who held the highest and most\nenviable position in the Nation. A position that only great intellect\ncould secure in that country.\n\nAs we neared the goal of our journey, I noticed an increasing warmth of\nthe atmosphere, and my ears were soon greeted with a deep, reverberating\nroar like continuous thunder. I have seen and heard Niagara, but a\nthousand Niagaras could not equal that deafening sound. The heat became\noppressive. The light also from a cause of which I shall soon speak.\n\nWe ascended a promontory that jutted out from the main land a quarter of\na mile, perhaps more. Wauna conducted me to the edge of the cliff and\ntold me to look down. An ocean of whirlpools was before us. The\nmaddened dashing and thundering of the mighty waters, and the awe they\ninspired no words can paint. Across such an abyss of terrors it was\ncertain no vessel could sail. We took our glasses and scanned the\nopposite shore, which appeared to be a vast cataract as though the ocean\nwas pouring over a precipice of rock. Wauna informed me that where the\nshore was visible it was a perpendicular wall of smooth rock.\n\nOver head an arc of fire spanned the zenith from which depended curtains\nof rainbows waving and fluttering, folding and floating out again with a\nrapid and incessant motion. I asked Wauna why they had not crossed in\nair-ships, and she said they had tried it often but had always failed.\n\n\"In former times,\" she said, \"when air-ships first came into use it was\nfrequently attempted, but no voyager ever returned. We have long since\nabandoned the attempt, for now we know it to be impossible.\"\n\nI looked again at that display of uncontrollable power. As I gazed it\nseemed to me I would be drawn down by the resistless fascination of\nterror. I grasped Wauna and she gently turned my face to the smiling\nlandscape behind us. Hills and valleys, and sparkling cities veiled in\nfoliage, with their numberless parks and fountains and statues sleeping\nin the soft light, gleaming lakes and wandering rivers that glittered\nand danced in the glorious atmosphere like prisoned sunbeams, greeted us\nlike the alluring smile of love, and yet, for the first time since\nentering this lovely land, I felt myself a prisoner. Behind me was an\nimpassable barrier. Before me, far beyond this gleaming vision of\nenchantment, lay another road whose privations and dangers I dreaded to\nattempt.\n\nI felt as a bird might feel who has been brought from the free expanse\nof its wild forest-home, and placed in a golden cage where it drinks\nfrom a jeweled cup and eats daintier food than it could obtain in its\nown rude haunts. It pines for that precarious life; its very dangers and\nprivations fill its breast with desire. I began to long with unutterable\nimpatience to see once more the wild, rough scenes of my own nativity.\nMemory began to recall them with softening touches. My heart yearned for\nmy own; debased as compared with Mizora though they be, there was the\ncongeniality of blood between us. I longed to see my own little one\nwhose dimpled hands I had unclasped from my neck in that agonized\nparting. Whenever I saw a Mizora mother fondling her babe, my heart\nleapt with quick desire to once more hold my own in such loving embrace.\nThe mothers of Mizora have a devotional love for their children. Their\nsmiles and prattle and baby wishes are listened to with loving\ntenderness, and treated as matters of importance.\n\nI was sitting beside a Mizora mother one evening, listening to some\nsinging that I truly thought no earthly melody could surpass. I asked\nthe lady if ever she had heard anything sweeter, and she answered,\nearnestly:\n\n\"Yes, the voices of my own children.\"\n\nOn our homeward journey, Wauna took me to a lake from the center of\nwhich we could see, with our glasses, a green island rising high above\nthe water like an emerald in a silver setting.\n\n\"That,\" said Wauna, directing my attention to it, \"is the last vestige\nof a prison left in Mizora. Would you like to visit it?\"\n\nI expressed an eager willingness to behold so curious a sight, and\ngetting into a small pleasure boat, we started toward it. Boats are\npropelled in Mizora either by electricity or compressed air, and glide\nthrough the water with soundless swiftness.\n\nAs we neared the island I could perceive the mingling of natural and\nartificial attractions. We moored our boat at the foot of a flight of\nsteps, hewn from the solid rock. On reaching the top, the scene spread\nout like a beautiful painting. Grottos, fountains, and cascades, winding\nwalks and vine-covered bowers charmed us as we wandered about. In the\ncenter stood a medium-sized residence of white marble. We entered\nthrough a door opening on a wide piazza. Art and wealth and taste had\nadorned the interior with a generous hand. A library studded with books\nclosely shut behind glass doors had a wide window that commanded an\nenchanting view of the lake, with its rippling waters sparkling and\ndimpling in the light. On one side of the mantelpiece hung a full length\nportrait of a lady, painted with startling naturalness.\n\n\"That,\" said Wauna, solemnly, \"was the last prisoner in Mizora.\"\n\nI looked with interested curiosity at a relic so curious in this land.\nIt was a blonde woman with lighter colored eyes than is at all common in\nMizora. Her long, blonde hair hung straight and unconfined over a dress\nof thick, white material. Her attitude and expression were dejected and\nsorrowful. I had visited prisons in my own land where red-handed murder\nsat smiling with indifference. I had read in newspapers, labored\neloquence that described the stoicism of some hardened criminal as a\ntrait of character to be admired. I had read descriptions where mistaken\neloquence exerted itself to waken sympathy for a criminal who had never\nfelt sympathy for his helpless and innocent victims, and I had felt\nnothing but creeping horror for it all. But gazing at this picture of\nundeniable repentance, tears of sympathy started to my eyes. Had she\nbeen guilty of taking a fellow-creature's life?\n\n\"Is she still living?\" I asked by way of a preface.\n\n\"Oh, no, she has been dead for more than a century,\" answered Wauna.\n\n\"Was she confined here very long?\"\n\n\"For life,\" was the reply.\n\n\"I should not believe,\" I said, \"that a nature capable of so deep a\nrepentance could be capable of so dark a crime as murder.\"\n\n\"Murder!\" exclaimed Wauna in horror. \"There has not been a murder\ncommitted in this land for three thousand years.\"\n\nIt was my turn to be astonished.\n\n\"Then tell me what dreadful crime she committed.\"\n\n\"She struck her child,\" said Wauna, sadly; \"her little innocent,\nhelpless child that Nature gave her to love and cherish, and make noble\nand useful and happy.\"\n\n\"Did she inflict a permanent injury?\" I asked, with increased\nastonishment at this new phase of refinement in the Mizora character.\n\n\"No one can tell the amount of injury a blow does to a child. It may\nimmediately show an obvious physical one; it may later develop a mental\none. It may never seem to have injured it at all, and yet it may have\nshocked a sensitive nature and injured it permanently. Crime is evolved\nfrom perverted natures, and natures become perverted from ill-usage. It\nmerges into a peculiar structure of the brain that becomes hereditary.\"\n\n\"What became of the prisoner's child?\"\n\n\"It was adopted by a young lady who had just graduated at the State\nCollege of the State in which the mother resided. It was only five years\nold, and its mother's name was never mentioned to it or to anyone else.\nLong before that, the press had abolished the practice of giving any\nprominence to crime. That pernicious eloquence that in uncivilized ages\nhad helped to nourish crime by a maudlin sympathy for the criminal, had\nceased to exist. The young lady called the child daughter, and it called\nher mother.\"\n\n\"Did the real mother never want to see her child?\"\n\n\"That is said to be a true picture of her,\" said Wauna; \"and who can\nlook at it and not see sorrow and remorse.\"\n\n\"How could you be so stern?\" I asked, in wondering astonishment.\n\n\"Pity has nothing to do with crime,\" said Wauna, firmly. \"You must look\nto humanity, and not to the sympathy one person excites when you are\naiding enlightenment. That woman wandered about these beautiful grounds,\nor sat in this elegant home a lonely and unsympathized-with prisoner.\nShe was furnished with books, magazines and papers, and every physical\ncomfort. Sympathy for her lot was never offered her. Childhood is\nregarded by my people as the only period of life that is capable of\nknowing perfect happiness, and among us it is a crime greater than the\nheinousness of murder in your country, to deprive a human being of its\nchildhood--in which cluster the only unalloyed sweets of life.\n\n\"A human being who remembers only pain, rebukes treatment in childhood,\nhas lost the very flavor of existence, and the person who destroyed it\nis a criminal indeed.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\n\nThere was one peculiarity about Mizora that I noticed soon after my\narrival, but for various reasons have refrained from speaking of before\nnow. It was the absence of houses devoted to religious worship.\n\nIn architecture Mizora displayed the highest perfection. Their colleges,\nart galleries, public libraries, opera houses, and all their public\nbuildings were grand and beautiful. Never in any country, had I beheld\nsuch splendor in design and execution. Their superior skill in this\nrespect, led me to believe that their temples of worship must be on a\nscale of magnificence beyond all my conceiving. I was eager to behold\nthem. I looked often upon my first journeyings about their cities to\ndiscover them, but whenever I noticed an unusually imposing building,\nand asked what it was, it was always something else. I was frequently on\nthe point of asking them to conduct me to some church that resembled my\nown in worship, (for I was brought up in strict compliance with the\ncreeds, dogmas, and regulations of the Russo Greek Church) but I\nrefrained, hoping that in time, I should be introduced to their\nreligious ceremonies.\n\nWhen time passed on, and no invitation was extended me, and I saw no\nhouse nor preparation for religious worship, nor even heard mention of\nany, I asked Wauna for an explanation. She appeared not to comprehend\nme, and I asked the question:\n\n\"Where do you perform your religious rites and ceremonies?\"\n\nShe looked at me with surprise.\n\n\"You ask me such strange questions that sometimes I am tempted to\nbelieve you a relic of ancient mythology that has drifted down the\ncenturies and landed on our civilized shores, or else have been gifted\nwith a marvelous prolongation of life, and have emerged upon us from\nsome cavern where you have lived, or slept for ages in unchanged\npossession of your ancient superstition.\"\n\n\"Have you, then,\" I asked in astonishment, \"no religious temples\ndevoted to worship?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, we have temples where we worship daily. Do you see that\nbuilding?\" nodding toward the majestic granite walls of the National\nCollege. \"That is one of our most renowned temples, where the highest\nand the noblest in the land meet and mingle familiarly with the humblest\nin daily worship.\"\n\n\"I understand all that you wish to imply by that,\" I replied. \"But have\nyou no building devoted to divine worship; no temple that belongs\nspecially to your Deity; to the Being that created you, and to whom you\nowe eternal gratitude and homage?\"\n\n\"We have;\" she answered grandly, with a majestic wave of her hand, and\nin that mellow, musical voice that was sweeter than the chanting of\nbirds, she exclaimed:\n\n\n     \"This vast cathedral, boundless as our wonder;\n       Whose shining lamps yon brilliant mists[A] supply;\n     Its choir the winds, and waves; its organ thunder;\n       Its dome the sky.\"\n\n[Footnote A: Aurora Borealis]\n\n\"Do you worship Nature?\" I asked.\n\n\"If we did, we should worship ourselves, for we are a part of Nature.\"\n\n\"But do you not recognize an invisible and incomprehensible Being that\ncreated you, and who will give your spirit an abode of eternal bliss, or\nconsign it to eternal torments according as you have glorified and\nserved him?\"\n\n\"I am an atom of Nature;\" said Wauna, gravely. \"If you want me to answer\nyour superstitious notions of religion, I will, in one sentence,\nexplain, that the only religious idea in Mizora is: Nature is God, and\nGod is Nature. She is the Great Mother who gathers the centuries in her\narms, and rocks their children into eternal sleep upon her bosom.\"\n\n\"But how,\" I asked in bewildered astonishment, \"how can you think of\nliving without creeds, and confessionals? How can you prosper without\nprayer? How can you be upright, and honest, and true to yourselves and\nyour friends without praying for divine grace and strength to sustain\nyou? How can you be noble, and keep from envying your neighbors,\nwithout a prayer for divine grace to assist you to resist such\ntemptation?\"\n\n\"Oh, daughter of the dark ages,\" said Wauna, sadly, \"turn to the\nbenevolent and ever-willing Science. She is the goddess who has led us\nout of ignorance and superstition; out of degradation and disease, and\nevery other wretchedness that superstitious, degraded humanity has\nknown. She has lifted us above the low and the little, the narrow and\nmean in human thought and action, and has placed us in a broad, free,\nindependent, noble, useful and grandly happy life.\"\n\n\"You have been favored by divine grace,\" I reiterated, \"although you\nrefuse to acknowledge it.\"\n\nShe smiled compassionately as she answered:\n\n\"She is the divinity who never turned a deaf ear to earnest and\npersistent effort in a sensible direction. But prayers to her must be\n_work_, resolute and conscientious _work_. She teaches that success in\nthis world can only come to those who work for it. In your superstitious\nbelief you pray for benefits you have never earned, possibly do not\ndeserve, but expect to get simply because you pray for them. Science\nnever betrays such partiality. The favors she bestows are conferred only\nupon the industrious.\"\n\n\"And you deny absolutely the efficacy of prayer?\" I asked.\n\n\"If I could obtain anything by prayer alone, I would pray that my\ninventive faculty should be enlarged so that I might conceive and\nconstruct an air-ship that could cleave its way through that chaos of\nwinds that is formed when two storms meet from opposite directions. It\nwould rend to atoms one of our present make. But prayer will never\nproduce an improved air-ship. We must dig into science for it. Our\nancestors did not pray for us to become a race of symmetrically-shaped\nand universally healthy people, and expect that to effect a result. They\nwent to work on scientific principles to root out disease and crime and\nwant and wretchedness, and every degrading and retarding influence.\"\n\n\"Prayer never saved one of my ancestors from premature death,\" she\ncontinued, with a resolution that seemed determined to tear from my mind\nevery fabric of faith in the consolations of divine interposition that\nhad been a special part of my education, and had become rooted into my\nnature. \"Disease, when it fastened upon the vitals of the young and\nbeautiful and dearly-loved was stronger and more powerful than all the\nagonized prayers that could be poured from breaking hearts. But science,\nwhen solicited by careful study and experiment and investigation,\noffered the remedy. And _now_, we defy disease and have no fear of death\nuntil our natural time comes, and _then_ it will be the welcome rest\nthat the worn-out body meets with gratitude.\"\n\n\"But when you die,\" I exclaimed, \"do you not believe you have an after\nlife?\"\n\n\"When I die,\" replied Wauna, \"my body will return to the elements from\nwhence it came. Thought will return to the force which gave it. The\npower of the brain is the one mystery that surrounds life. We know that\nthe brain is a mechanical structure and acted upon by force; but how to\nanalyze that force is still beyond our reach. You see that huge engine?\nWe made it. It is a fine piece of mechanism. We know what it was made to\ndo. We turn on the motive power, and it moves at the rate of a mile a\nminute if we desire it. Why should it move? Why might it not stand\nstill? You say because of a law of nature that under the circumstances\ncompels it to move. Our brain is like that engine--a wonderful piece of\nmechanism, and when the blood drives it, it displays the effects of\nforce which we call Thought. We can see the engine move and we know what\nlaw of nature it obeys in moving. But the brain is a more mysterious\nstructure, for the force which compels it to action we cannot analyze.\nThe superstitious ancients called this mystery the soul.\"\n\n\"And do you discard that belief?\" I asked, trembling and excited to hear\nsuch sacrilegious talk from youth so beautiful and pure.\n\n\"What our future is to be after dissolution no one knows,\" replied\nWauna, with the greatest calmness and unconcern. \"A thousand theories\nand systems of religion have risen and fallen in the history of the\nhuman family, and become the superstitions of the past. The elements\nthat compose this body may construct the delicate beauty of a flower, or\nthe green robe that covers the bosom of Mother Earth, but we cannot\nknow.\"\n\n\"But that beautiful belief in a soul,\" I cried, in real anguish, \"How\ncan you discard it? How sever the hope that after death, we are again\nunited to part no more? Those who have left us in the spring time of\nlife, the bloom on their young cheeks suddenly paled by the cold touch\nof death, stand waiting to welcome us to an endless reunion.\"\n\n\"Alas, for your anguish, my friend,\" said Wauna, with pityng tenderness.\n\"Centuries ago _my_ people passed through that season of mental pain.\nThat beautiful visionary idea of a soul must fade, as youth and beauty\nfade, never to return; for Nature nowhere teaches the existence of such\na thing. It was a belief born of that agony of longing for happiness\nwithout alloy, which the children of earth in the long-ago ages hoped\nfor, but never knew. Their lot was so barren of beauty and happiness,\nand the desire for it is, now and always has been, a strong trait of\nhuman character. The conditions of society in those earlier ages\nrendered it impossible to enjoy this life perfectly, and hope and\nlonging pictured an imaginary one for an imaginary part of the body\ncalled the Soul. Progress and civilization have brought to us the ideal\nheaven of the ancients, and we receive from Nature no evidence of any\nother.\"\n\n\"But I do believe there is another,\" I declared. \"And we ought to be\nprepared for it.\"\n\nWauna smiled. \"What better preparation could you desire, then, than good\nworks in this?\" she asked.\n\n\"You should pray, and do penance for your sins,\" was my reply.\n\n\"Then,\" said Wauna, \"we are doing the wisest penance every day. We are\nstudying, investigating, experimenting in order that those who come\nafter us may be happier than we. Every day Science is yielding us some\nnew knowledge that will make living in the future still easier than\nnow.\"\n\n\"I cannot conceive,\" I said, \"how you are to be improved upon.\"\n\n\"When we manufacture fruit and vegetables from the elements, can you not\nperceive how much is to be gained? Old age and death will come later,\nand the labor of cultivation will be done away. Such an advantage will\nnot be enjoyed during my lifetime. But we will labor to effect it for\nfuture generations.\"\n\n\"Your whole aim in life, then, is to work for the future of your race,\ninstead of the eternal welfare of your own soul?\" I questioned, in\nsurprise.\n\n\"If Nature,\" said Wauna, \"has provided us a future life, if that\nmysterious something that we call Thought is to be clothed in an\netherealized body, and live in a world where decay is unknown, I have no\nfear of my reception there. Live _this_ life usefully and nobly, and no\nmatter if a prayer has never crossed your lips your happiness will be\nassured. A just and kind action will help you farther on the road to\nheaven than all the prayers that you can utter, and all the pains and\nsufferings that you can inflict upon the flesh, for it will be that much\nadded to the happiness of this world. The grandest epitaph that could be\nwritten is engraved upon a tombstone in yonder cemetery. The subject was\none of the pioneers of progress in a long-ago century, when progress\nfought its way with difficulty through ignorance and superstition. She\nsuffered through life for the boldness of her opinions, and two\ncenturies after, when they had become popular, a monument was erected to\nher memory, and has been preserved through thousands of years as a motto\nfor humanity. The epitaph is simply this: 'The world is better for her\nhaving lived in it.'\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\n\nNot long after my conversation with Wauna, mentioned in the previous\nchapter, an event happened in Mizora of so singular and unexpected a\ncharacter for that country that it requires a particular description. I\nrefer to the death of a young girl, the daughter of the Professor of\nNatural History in the National College, whose impressive inaugural\nceremonies I had witnessed with so much gratification. The girl was of a\nventuresome disposition, and, with a number of others, had gone out\nrowing. The boats they used in Mizora for that purpose were mere cockle\nshells. A sudden squall arose from which all could have escaped, but the\nreckless daring of this young girl cost her her life. Her boat was\ncapsized, and despite the exertions made by her companions, she was\ndrowned.\n\nHer body was recovered before the news was conveyed to the mother. As\nthe young companions surrounded it in the abandon of grief that tender\nand artless youth alone feels, had I not known that not a tie of\nconsanguinity existed between them, I might have thought them a band of\nsisters mourning their broken number. It was a scene I never expect and\nsincerely hope never to witness again. It made the deeper impression\nupon me because I knew the expressions of grief were all genuine.\n\nI asked Wauna if any of the dead girl's companions feared that her\nmother might censure them for not making sufficient effort to save her\nwhen her boat capsized. She looked at me with astonishment.\n\n\"Such a thought,\" she said, \"will never occur to her nor to any one else\nin Mizora. I have not asked the particulars, but I know that everything\nwas done that could have been done to save her. There must have been\nsomething extraordinarily unusual about the affair for all Mizora girls\nare expert swimmers, and there is not one but would put forth any\nexertion to save a companion.\"\n\nI afterward learned that such had really been the case.\n\nIt developed upon the Preceptress to break the news to the afflicted\nmother. It was done in the seclusion of her own home. There was no\nmanifestation of morbid curiosity among acquaintances, neighbors and\nfriends. The Preceptress and one or two others of her nearest and most\nintimate friends called at the house during the first shock of her\nbereavement.\n\nAfter permission had been given to view the remains, Wauna and I called\nat the house, but only entered the drawing-room. On a low cot, in an\nattitude of peaceful repose, lay the breathless sleeper. Her mother and\nsisters had performed for her the last sad offices of loving duty, and\nlovely indeed had they made the last view we should have of their dear\none.\n\nThere was to be no ceremony at the house, and Wauna and I were in the\ncemetery when the procession entered. As we passed through the city, I\nnoticed that every business house was closed. The whole city was\nsympathizing with sorrow. I never before saw so vast a concourse of\npeople. The procession was very long and headed by the mother, dressed\nand veiled in black. Behind her were the sisters carrying the body. It\nrested upon a litter composed entirely of white rosebuds. The sisters\nwore white, their faces concealed by white veils. Each wore a white\nrosebud pinned upon her bosom. They were followed by a long procession\nof young girls, schoolmates and friends of the dead. They were all\ndressed in white, but were not veiled. Each one carried a white rosebud.\n\nThe sisters placed the litter upon rests at the side of the grave, and\nclasping hands with their mother, formed a semicircle about it. They\nwere all so closely veiled that their features could not be seen, and no\nemotion was visible. The procession of young girls formed a circle\ninclosing the grave and the mourners, and began chanting a slow and\nsorrowful dirge. No words can paint the pathos and beauty of such a\nscene. My eye took in every detail that displayed that taste for the\nbeautiful that compels the Mizora mind to mingle it with every incident\nof life. The melody sounded like a chorus of birds chanting, in perfect\nunison, a weird requiem over some dead companion.\n\n\n                           DIRGE\n\n     She came like the Spring in its gladness\n     We received her with joy--we rejoiced in her promise\n     Sweet was her song as the bird's,\n     Her smile was as dew to the thirsty rose.\n     But the end came ere morning awakened,\n     While Dawn yet blushed in its bridal veil,\n     The leafy music of the woods was hushed in snowy shrouds.\n     Spring withered with the perfume in her hands;\n     A winter sleet has fallen upon the buds of June;\n     The ice-winds blow where yesterday zephyrs disported:\n     Life is not consummated\n     The rose has not blossomed, the fruit has perished in the flower,\n     The bird lies frozen under its mother's breast\n     Youth sleeps in round loveliness when age should lie withered and\n       weary, and full of honor.\n     Then the grave would be welcome, and our tears would fall not.\n     The grave is not for the roses of youth;\n     We mourn the early departed.\n     Youth sleeps without dreams--\n     Without an awakening.\n\n\nAt the close of the chant, the mother first and then each sister took\nfrom her bosom the white rosebud and dropped it into the grave. Then\nfollowed her schoolmates and companions who each dropped in the bud she\ncarried. A carpet of white rosebuds was thus formed, on which the body,\nstill reclining upon its pillow of flowers, was gently lowered.\n\nThe body was dressed in white, and over all fell a veil of fine white\ntulle. A more beautiful sight I can never see than that young, lovely\ngirl in her last sleep with the emblems of youth, purity and swift decay\nforming her pillow, and winding-sheet. Over this was placed a film of\nglass that rested upon the bottom and sides of the thin lining that\ncovered the bottom and lower sides of the grave. The remainder of the\nprocession of young girls then came forward and dropped their rosebuds\nupon it, completely hiding from view the young and beautiful dead.\n\nThe eldest sister then took a handful of dust and casting it into the\ngrave, said in a voice broken, yet audible: \"Mingle ashes with ashes,\nand dust with its original dust. To the earth whence it was taken,\nconsign we the body of our sister.\" Each sister then threw in a handful\nof dust, and then with their mother entered their carriage, which\nimmediately drove them home.\n\nA beautiful silver spade was sticking in the soft earth that had been\ntaken from the grave. The most intimate of the dead girls friends took a\nspadeful of earth and threw it into the open grave. Her example was\nfollowed by each one of the remaining companions until the grave was\nfilled. Then clasping hands, they chanted a farewell to their departed\ncompanion and playmate. After which they strewed the grave with flowers\nuntil it looked like a bed of beauty, and departed.\n\nI was profoundly impressed by the scene. Its solemnity, its beauty, and\nthe universal expression of sorrow it had called forth. A whole city\nmourned the premature death of gifted and lovely youth. Alas! In my own\nunhappy country such an event would have elicited but a passing phrase\nof regret from all except the immediate family of the victim; for\n_there_ sorrow is a guest at every heart, and leaves little room for\nsympathy with strangers.\n\nThe next day the mother was at her post in the National College; the\ndaughters were at their studies, all seemingly calm and thoughtful, but\nshowing no outward signs of grief excepting to the close observer. The\nmother was performing her accustomed duties with seeming cheerfulness,\nbut now and then her mind would drop for a moment in sorrowful\nabstraction to be recalled with resolute effort and be fastened once\nmore upon the necessary duty of life.\n\nThe sisters I often saw in those abstracted moods, and frequently saw\nthem wiping away silent but unobtrusive tears. I asked Wauna for the\nmeaning of such stoical reserve, and the explanation was as curious as\nwere all the other things that I met with in Mizora.\n\n\"If you notice the custom of different grades of civilization in your\nown country,\" said Wauna, \"you will observe that the lower the\ncivilization the louder and more ostentatious is the mourning. True\nrefinement is unobtrusive in everything, and while we do not desire to\nrepress a natural and inevitable feeling of sorrow, we do desire to\nconceal and conquer it, for the reason that death is a law of nature\nthat we cannot evade. And, although the death of a young person has not\noccurred in Mizora in the memory of any living before this, yet it is\nnot without precedent. We are very prudent, but we cannot guard entirely\nagainst accident. It has cast a gloom over the whole city, yet we\nrefrain from speaking of it, and strive to forget it because it cannot\nbe helped.\"\n\n\"And can you see so young, so fair a creature perish without wanting to\nmeet her again?\"\n\n\"Whatever sorrow we feel,\" replied Wauna, solemnly, \"we deeply realize\nhow useless it is to repine. We place implicit faith in the revelations\nof Nature, and in no circumstances does she bid us expect a life beyond\nthat of the body. That is a life of individual consciousness.\"\n\n\"How much more consoling is the belief of my people,\" I replied,\ntriumphantly. \"Their belief in a future reunion would sustain them\nthrough the sorrow of parting in this. It has been claimed that some\nhave lived pure lives solely in the hope of meeting some one whom they\nloved, and who had died in youth and innocence.\"\n\nWauna smiled.\n\n\"You do not all have then the same fate in anticipation for your future\nlife?\" she asked.\n\n\"Oh, no!\" I answered. \"The good and the wicked are divided.\"\n\n\"Tell me some incident in your own land that you have witnessed, and\nwhich illustrates the religious belief of your country.\"\n\n\"The belief that we have in a future life has often furnished a theme\nfor the poets of my own and other countries. And sometimes a quaint and\npretty sentiment is introduced into poetry to express it.\"\n\n\"I should like to hear some such poetry. Can you recite any?\"\n\n\"I remember an incident that gave birth to a poem that was much admired\nat the time, although I can recall but the two last stanzas of it. A\nrowing party, of which I was a member, once went out upon a lake to view\nthe sunset. After we had returned to shore, and night had fallen upon\nthe water in impenetrable darkness, it was discovered that one of the\nyoung men who had rowed out in a boat by himself was not with us. A\nstorm was approaching, and we all knew that his safety lay in getting\nashore before it broke. We lighted a fire, but the blaze could not be\nseen far in such inky darkness. We hallooed, but received no answer, and\nfinally ceased our efforts. Then one of the young ladies who possessed a\nvery high and clear soprano voice, began singing at the very top of her\npower. It reached the wanderer in the darkness, and he rowed straight\ntoward it. From that time on he became infatuated with the singer,\ndeclaring that her voice had come to him in his despair like an angel's\nstraight from heaven.\n\n\"She died in less than a year, and her last words to him were: 'Meet me\nin heaven.' He had always been recklessly inclined, but after that he\nbecame a model of rectitude and goodness. He wrote a poem that was\ndedicated to her memory. In it he described himself as a lone wanderer\non a strange sea in the darkness of a gathering storm and no beacon to\nguide him, when suddenly he hears a voice singing which guides him safe\nto shore. He speaks of the beauty of the singer and how dear she became\nto him, but he still hears the song calling him across the ocean of\ndeath.\"\n\n\"Repeat what you remember of it,\" urged Wauna.\n\n\n     \"That face and form, have long since gone\n       Beyond where the day was lifted:\n     But the beckoning song still lingers on,\n       An angels earthward drifted.\n\n     And when death's waters, around me roar\n       And cares, like the birds, are winging:\n     If I steer my bark to Heaven's shore\n       'Twill be by an angel's singing.\"\n\n\n\"Poor child of superstition,\" said Wauna, sadly. \"Your belief has\nsomething pretty in it, but for your own welfare, and that of your\npeople, you must get rid of it as we have got rid of the offspring of\nLust. Our children come to us as welcome guests through portals of the\nholiest and purest affection. That love which you speak of, I know\nnothing about. I would not know. It is a degradation which mars your\nyoung life and embitters the memories of age. We have advanced beyond\nit. There is a cruelty in life,\" she added, compassionately, \"which we\nmust accept with stoicism as the inevitable. Justice to your posterity\ndemands of you the highest and noblest effort of which your intellect is\ncapable.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\n\nThe conversation that I had with Wauna gave me so much uneasiness that I\nsought her mother. I cannot express the shock I felt at hearing such\nyouthful and innocent lips speak of the absurdity of religious forms,\nceremonies, and creeds. She regarded my belief in them as a species of\nbarbarism. But she had not convinced me. _I was resolved not to be\nconvinced._ I believed she was in error.\n\nSurely, I thought, a country so far advanced in civilization, and\npracticing such unexampled rectitude, must, according to my religious\nteaching, have been primarily actuated by religious principles which\nthey had since abandoned. My only surprise was that they had not\nrelapsed into immorality, after destroying church and creed, and I began\nto feel anxious to convince them of the danger I felt they were\nincurring in neglecting prayer and supplication at the throne to\ncontinue them in their progress toward perfection of mental and moral\nculture.\n\nI explained my feelings to the Preceptress with great earnestness and\nanxiety for their future, intimating that I believed their immunity from\ndisaster had been owing to Divine sufferance. \"For no nation,\" I added,\nquoting from my memory of religious precepts, \"can prosper without\nacknowledging the Christian religion.\"\n\nShe listened to me with great attention, and when I had finished, asked:\n\n\"How do you account for our long continuance in prosperity and progress,\nfor it is more than a thousand years since we rooted out the last\nvestige of what you term religion, from the mind. We have had a long\nimmunity from punishment. To what do you attribute it?\"\n\nI hesitated to explain what had been in my mind, but finally faltered\nout something about the absence of the male sex. I then had to explain\nthat the prisons and penitentiaries of my own land, and of all other\ncivilized lands that I knew of, were almost exclusively occupied by the\nmale sex. Out of eight hundred penitentiary prisoners, not more than\ntwenty or thirty would be women; and the majority of them could trace\n_their_ crimes to man's infidelity.\n\n\"And what do you do to reform them?\" inquired the Preceptress.\n\n\"We offer them the teachings of Christianity. All countries, however,\ndiffer widely in this respect. The government of my country is not as\ngenerous to prisoners as that of some others. In the United States every\npenitentiary is supplied with a minister who expounds the Gospel to the\nprisoners every Sunday; that is once every seven days.\"\n\n\"And what do they do the rest of the time?\"\n\n\"They work.\"\n\n\"Are they ignorant?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, indeed;\" I replied, earnestly. \"You could not find one scholar\nin ten thousand of them. Their education is either very limited, or\naltogether deficient.\"\n\n\"Do the buildings they are confined in cost a great deal?\"\n\n\"Vast sums of money are represented by them; and it often costs a\ncommunity a great deal of money to send a criminal to the penitentiary.\nIn some States the power to pardon rests entirely with the governor, and\nit frequently occurs that a desperate criminal, who has cost a county a\ngreat deal of money to get rid of him, will be pardoned by the governor,\nto please a relative, or, as it is sometimes believed, for a bribe.\"\n\n\"And do the people never think of educating their criminals instead of\nworking them?\n\n\"That would be an expense to the government,\" I replied.\n\n\"If they would divide the time, and compel them to study half a day as\nrigorously as they make them work, it would soon make a vast change in\ntheir morals. Nothing so ennobles the mind as a broad and thorough\neducation.\"\n\n\"They are all compelled to listen to religious instruction once a week,\"\nI answered. \"That surely ought to make some improvement in them. I\nremember hearing an American lady relate her attendance at chapel\nservice in a State penitentiary one Sunday. The minister's education was\nquite limited, as she could perceive from the ungrammatical language he\nused, but he preached sound orthodox doctrine. The text selected had a\nspecial application to his audience: 'Depart from me ye accursed, into\neverlasting torment prepared for the Devil and his angels.' There were\neight hundred prisoners, and the minister assured them, in plain\nlanguage, that such would surely be their sentence unless they\nrepented.\"\n\n\"And that is what you call the consolations of religion, is it?\" asked\nthe Preceptress with an expression that rather disconcerted me; as\nthough my zeal and earnestness entirely lacked the light of knowledge\nwith which she viewed it.\n\n\"That is religious instruction;\" I answered. \"The minister exhorted the\nprisoners to pray and be purged of their sins. And it was good advice.\"\n\n\"But they might aver,\" persisted the Preceptress, \"that they had prayed\nto be restrained from crime, and their prayers had not been answered.\"\n\n\"They didn't pray with enough faith, then;\" I assured her in the\nconfidence of my own belief. \"That is wherein I think my own church is\nso superior to the other religions of the world,\" I added, proudly. \"We\ncan get the priest to absolve us from sin, and then we know we are rid\nof it, when he tells us so.\"\n\n\"But what assurance have you that the priest can do so?\" asked the\nPreceptress.\n\n\"Because it is his duty to do so.\"\n\n\"Education will root out more sin than all your creeds can,\" gravely\nanswered the Preceptress. \"Educate your convicts and train them into\ncontrolling and subduing their criminal tendencies by _their own will_,\nand it will have more effect on their morals than all the prayers ever\nuttered. Educate them up to that point where they can perceive for\nthemselves the happiness of moral lives, and then you may trust them to\ntemptation without fear. The ideas you have expressed about dogmas,\ncreeds and ceremonies are not new to us, though, as a nation, we do not\nmake a study of them. They are very, very ancient. They go back to the\nfirst records of the traditionary history of man. And the farther you go\nback the deeper you plunge into ignorance and superstition.\n\n\"The more ignorant the human mind, the more abject was its slavery to\nreligion. As history progresses toward a more diffuse education of the\nmasses, the forms, ceremonies and beliefs in religion are continually\nchanging to suit the advancement of intelligence; and when intelligence\nbecomes universal, they will be renounced altogether. What is true of\nthe history of one people will be true of the history of another.\nReligions are not necessary to human progress. They are really clogs. My\nancestors had more trouble to extirpate these superstitious ideas from\nthe mind than they had in getting rid of disease and crime. There were\nseveral reasons for this difficulty. Disease and crime were self-evident\nevils, that the narrowest intelligence could perceive; but beliefs in\ncreeds and superstitions were perversions of judgment, resulting from a\nlack of thorough mental training. As soon, however, as education of a\nhigh order became universal, it began to disappear. No mind of\nphilosophical culture can adhere to such superstitions.\n\n\"Many ages the people made idols, and, decking them with rich ornaments,\nplaced them in magnificent temples specially built for them and the\nrites by which they worshipped them. There have existed many variations\nof this kind of idolatry that are marked by the progressive stages of\ncivilization. Some nations of remote antiquity were highly cultured in\nart and literature, yet worshipped gods of their own manufacture, or\nimaginary gods, for everything. Light and darkness, the seasons, earth,\nair, water, all had a separate deity to preside over and control their\nspecial services. They offered sacrifices to these deities as they\ndesired their co-operation or favor in some enterprise to be undertaken.\n\n\"In remote antiquity, we read of a great General about to set out upon\nthe sea to attack the army of another nation. In order to propitiate the\ngod of the ocean, he had a fine chariot built to which were harnessed\ntwo beautiful white horses. In the presence of a vast concourse of\npeople collected to witness the ceremony, he drove them into the sea.\nWhen they sank out of sight it was supposed that the god had accepted\nthe present, and would show his gratitude for it by favoring winds and\npeaceful weather.\n\n\"A thousand years afterward history speaks of the occurrence derisively,\nas an absurd superstition, and at the same time they believed in and\nlauded a more absurd and cruel religion. They worshipped an imaginary\nbeing who had created and possessed absolute control of everything. Some\nof the human family it had pleased him to make eminently good, while\nothers he made eminently bad. For those whom he had created with evil\ndesires, he prepared a lake of molten fire into which they were to be\ncast after death to suffer endless torture for doing what they had been\nexpressly created to do. Those who had been created good were to be\nrewarded for following out their natural inclinations, by occupying a\nplace near the Deity, where they were to spend eternity in singing\npraises to him.\n\n\"He could, however, be persuaded by prayer from following his original\nintentions. Very earnest prayer had caused him to change his mind, and\nsend rain when he had previously concluded to visit the country with\ndrouth.\n\n\"Two nations at war with each other, and believing in the same Deity,\nwould pray for a pestilence to visit their enemy. Death was universally\nregarded as a visitation of Providence for some offense committed\nagainst him instead of against the laws of nature.\n\n\"Some believed that prayer and donations to the church or priest, could\ninduce the Deity to take their relatives from the lake of torment and\nplace them in his own presence. The Deity was prayed to on every\noccasion, and for every trivial object. The poor and indolent prayed for\nhim to send them food and clothes. The sick prayed for health, the\nfoolish for wisdom, and the revengeful besought the Deity to consign all\ntheir enemies to the burning lake.\n\n\"The intelligent and humane began to doubt the necessity of such\ndreadful and needless torment for every conceivable misdemeanor, and it\nwas modified, and eventually dropped altogether. Education finally\nrooted out every phase of superstition from the minds of the people, and\nnow we look back and smile at the massive and magnificent structures\nerected to the worship of a Deity who could be coaxed to change his mind\nby prayer.\"\n\nI did not tell the Preceptress that she had been giving me a history of\nmy own ancestry; but I remarked the resemblance with the joyous hope\nthat in the future of my own unhappy country lay the possibility of a\ncivilization so glorious, the ideal heaven of which every sorrowing\nheart had dreamed. But always with the desire to believe it had a\nspiritual eternity.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\n\nI have described the peculiar ceremony attending the burial of youth in\nMizora. Old age, in some respects, had a similar ceremony, but the\nfuneral of an aged person differed greatly from what I had witnessed at\nthe grave of youth. Wauna and I attended the funeral of a very aged\nlady. Death in Mizora was the gradual failing of mental and physical\nvigor. It came slowly, and unaccompanied with pain. It was received\nwithout regret, and witnessed without tears.\n\nThe daughters performed the last labor that the mother required. They\narrayed her body for burial and bore it to the grave. If in that season\nof the year, autumn leaves hid the bier, and formed the covering and\npillow of her narrow bed. If not in the fall, full-blown roses and\nmatured flowers were substituted.\n\nThe ceremony was conducted by the eldest daughter, assisted by the\nothers. No tears were shed; no mourning worn; no sorrowful chanting. A\nsolemn dirge was sung indicative of decay. A dignified solemnity\nbefitting the farewell to a useful life was manifest in all the\nproceedings; but no demonstrations of sorrow were visible. The mourners\nwere unveiled, and performed the last services for their mother with\ncalmness. I was so astonished at the absence of mourning that I asked an\nexplanation of Wauna.\n\n\"Why should we mourn,\" was the surprising answer, \"for what is\ninevitable? Death must come, and, in this instance, it came in its\nnatural way. There is nothing to be regretted or mourned over, as there\nwas in the drowning of my young friend. Her life was suddenly arrested\nwhile yet in the promise of its fruitfulness. There was cause for grief,\nand the expressions and emblems of mourning were proper and appropriate.\nBut here, mourning would be out of place, for life has fulfilled its\npromises. Its work is done, and nature has given the worn-out body rest.\nThat is all.\"\n\nThat sympathy and regret which the city had expressed for the young\ndead was manifested only in decorum and respectful attendance at the\nfuneral. No one appeared to feel that it was an occasion for mourning.\nHow strange it all seemed to me, and yet there was a philosophy about it\nthat I could not help but admire. Only I wished that they believed as I\ndid, that all of those tender associations would be resumed beyond the\ngrave. If only they could be convinced. I again broached the subject to\nWauna. I could not relinquish the hope of converting her to my belief.\nShe was so beautiful, so pure, and I loved her so dearly. I could not\ngive up my hope of an eternal reunion. I appealed to her sympathy.\n\n\"What hope,\" I asked, \"can you offer those whose lives have been only\nsuccessive phases of unhappiness? Why should beings be created only to\nlive a life of suffering, and then die, as many, very many, of my people\ndo? If they had no hope of a spiritual life, where pain and sorrow are\nto be unknown, the burdens of this life could not be borne.\"\n\n\"You have the same consolation,\" replied Wauna, \"as the Preceptress had\nin losing her daughter. That daring spirit that cost her her life, was\nthe pride of her mother. She possessed a promising intellect, yet her\nmother accepts her death as one of the sorrowful phases of life, and\nbravely tries to subdue its pain. Long ages behind us, as my mother has\ntold you, the history of all human life was but a succession of woes.\nOur own happy state has been evolved by slow degrees out of that\nsorrowful past. Human progress is marked by blood and tears, and the\nheart's bitterest anguish. We, as a people, have progressed almost\nbeyond the reach of sorrow, but you are in the midst of it. You must\nwork for the future, though you cannot be of it.\"\n\n\"I cannot,\" I declared, \"reconcile myself to your belief. I am separated\nfrom my child. To think I am never to see it in this world, nor through\nendless ages, would drive me insane with despair. What consolation can\nyour belief offer _me_?\"\n\n\"In this life, you may yearn for your child, but after this life you\nsleep,\" answered Wauna, sententiously. \"And how sweet that sleep! No\ndreams; no waking to work and trial; no striving after perfection; no\nplanning for the morrow. It is oblivion than which there can be no\nhappier heaven.\"\n\n\"Would not meeting with those you have loved be happier?\" I asked, in\namazement.\n\n\"There would be happiness; and there would be work, too.\"\n\n\"But my religion does not believe in work in heaven,\" I answered.\n\n\"Then it has not taken the immutable laws of Nature into consideration,\"\nsaid Wauna. \"If Nature has prepared a conscious existence for us after\nthis body decays, she has prepared work for us, you may rest assured. It\nmight be a grander, nobler work; but it would be work, nevertheless.\nThen, how restful, in contrast, is our religion. It is eternal,\nundisturbable rest for both body and brain. Besides, as you say\nyourself, you cannot be sure of meeting those whom you desire to meet in\nthat other country. They may be the ones condemned to eternal suffering\nfor their sins. Think you I could enjoy myself in any surroundings, when\nI knew that those who were dear to me in this life, were enduring\ntorment that could have no end. Give me oblivion rather than such a\nheaven.\n\n\"Our punishment comes in this world; but it is not so much through sin\nas ignorance. The savages lived lives of misery, occasioned by their\nlack of intelligence. Humanity must always suffer for the mistakes it\nmakes. Misery belongs to the ignorant; happiness to the wise. That is\nour doctrine of reward and punishment.\"\n\n\"And you believe that my people will one day reject all religions?\"\n\n\"When they are advanced enough,\" she answered. \"You say you have\nscholars among you already, who preach their inconsistencies. What do\nyou call them?\"\n\n\"Philosophers,\" was my reply.\n\n\"They are your prophets,\" said Wauna. \"When they break the shackles that\nbind you to creeds and dogmas, they will have done much to advance you.\nTo rely on one's own _will_ power to do right is the only safe road to\nmorality, and your only heaven.\"\n\nI left Wauna and sought a secluded spot by the river. I was shocked\nbeyond measure at her confession. It had the earnestness, and, to me,\nthe cruelty of conviction. To live without a spiritual future in\nanticipation was akin to depravity, to crime and its penalty of prison\nlife forever. Yet here was a people, noble, exalted beyond my\nconceiving, living in the present, and obeying only a duty to posterity.\nI recalled a painting I had once seen that always possessed for me a\nhorrible fascination. In a cave, with his foot upon the corpse of a\nyouth, sat the crowned and sceptered majesty of Death. The waters of\noblivion encompassed the throne and corpse, which lay with its head and\nfeet bathed in its waters--for out of the Unknown had life come, and to\nthe Unknown had it departed. Before me, in vision, swept the mighty\nstream of human life from which I had been swept to these strange\nshores. All its sufferings, its delusions; its baffled struggles; its\nwrongs, came upon me with a sense of spiritual agony in them that\nreligion--my religion, which was their only consolation--must vanish in\nthe crucible of Science. And that Science was the magician that was to\npurify and exalt the world. To live in the Present; to die in it and\nbecome as the dust; a mere speck, a flash of activity in the far,\nlimitless expanse of Nature, of Force, of Matter in which a spiritual\nideal had no part. It was horrible to think of. The prejudices of\ninherited religious faith, the contracted forces of thought in which I\nhad been born and reared could not be uprooted or expanded without pain.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\n\nI had begun to feel an intense longing to return to my own country, but\nit was accompanied by a desire, equally as strong, to carry back to that\nwoe-burdened land some of the noble lessons and doctrines I had learned\nin this. I saw no means of doing it that seemed so available as a\ncompanion,--a being, born and bred in an atmosphere of honor and grandly\nhumane ideas and actions.\n\nMy heart and my judgment turned to Wauna. She was endeared to me by long\nand gentle association. She was self-reliant and courageous, and\npossessed a strong will. Who, of all my Mizora acquaintances, was so\nwell adapted to the service I required.\n\nWhen I broached the subject to her, Wauna expressed herself as really\npleased with the idea; but when we went to the Preceptress, she\nacknowledged a strong reluctance to the proposition. She said:\n\n\"Wauna can form no conception of the conditions of society in your\ncountry. They are far, very far, behind our own. They will, I fear,\nchafe her own nature more than she can improve theirs. Still, if I\nthought she could lead your people into a broader intelligence, and\nstart them on the way upward to enlightenment and real happiness, I\nwould let her go. The moment, however, that she desires to return she\nmust be aided to do so.\"\n\nI pledged myself to abide by any request the Preceptress might make of\nme. Wauna's own inclinations greatly influenced her mother, and finally\nwe obtained her consent. Our preparations were carefully made. The\nadvanced knowledge of chemistry in Mizora placed many advantages in our\nway. Our boat was an ingenious contrivance with a thin glass top that\ncould be removed and folded away until needed to protect us from the\nrigors of the Arctic climate.\n\nI had given an accurate description of the rapids that would oppose us,\nand our boat was furnished with a motive power sufficient to drive us\nthrough them at a higher rate of speed than what they moved at. It was\nbuilt so as to be easily converted into a sled, and runners were made\nthat could be readily adjusted. We were provided with food and clothing\nprepared expressly for the severe change to and rigors of the Arctic\nclimate through which we must pass.\n\nI was constantly dreading the terrors of that long ice-bound journey,\nbut the Preceptress appeared to be little concerned about it. When I\nspoke of its severities, she said for us to observe her directions, and\nwe should not suffer. She asked me if I had ever felt uncomfortable in\nany of the air-ship voyages I had taken, and said that the cold of the\nupper regions through which I had passed in their country was quite as\nintense as any I could meet within a lower atmosphere of my own.\n\nThe newspapers had a great deal to say about the departure of the\nPreceptress' daughter on so uncertain a mission, and to that strange\nland of barbarians which I represented. When the day arrived for our\ndeparture, immense throngs of people from all parts of the country lined\nthe shore, or looked down upon us from their anchored air-ships.\n\nThe last words of farewell had been spoken to my many friends and\nbenefactors. Wauna had bidden a multitude of associates good-bye, and\nclasped her mother's hand, which she held until the boat parted from the\nshore. Years have passed since that memorable parting, but the look of\nyearning love in that Mizora mother's eyes haunts me still. Long and\nvainly has she watched for a boat's prow to cleave that amber mist and\nbear to her arms that vision of beauty and tender love I took away from\nher. My heart saddens at the thought of her grief and long, long waiting\nthat only death will end.\n\nWe pointed the boat's prow toward the wide mysterious circle of amber\nmists, and then turned our eyes for a last look at Mizora. Wauna stood\nsilent and calm, earnestly gazing into the eyes of her mother, until the\nshore and the multitude of fair faces faded like a vision of heaven from\nour views.\n\n\"O beautiful Mizora!\" cried the voice of my heart. \"Shall I ever again\nsee a land so fair, where natures so noble and aims so lofty have their\nabiding place? Memory will return to you though my feet may never again\ntread your delightful shores. Farewell, sweet ideal land of my Soul, of\nHumanity, farewell!\"\n\nMy thoughts turned to that other world from which I had journeyed so\nlong. Would the time ever come when it, too, would be a land of\nuniversal intelligence and happiness? When the difference of nations\nwould be settled by argument instead of battle? When disease, deformity\nand premature death would be unknown? When locks, and bolts and bars\nwould be useless?\n\nI hoped so much from the personal influence of Wauna. So noble, so\nutterly unconscious of wrong, she must surely revolutionize human nature\nwhenever it came in contact with her own.\n\nI pictured to myself my own dear land--dear, despite its many phases of\nwretchedness--smiling in universal comfort and health. I imagined its\npolitical prisons yawning with emptiness, while their haggard and\ndecrepit and sorrowful occupants hobbled out into the sunshine of\nliberty, and the new life we were bringing to them. Fancy flew abroad on\nthe wings of hope, dropping the seeds of progress wherever it passed.\n\nThe poor should be given work, and justly paid for it, instead of being\nsupported by charity. The charity that had fostered indolence in its\nmistaken efforts to do good, should be employed to train poverty to\nskillful labor and economy in living. And what a world of good that one\nmeasure would produce! The poor should possess exactly the same\neducational advantages that were supplied to the rich. In this _one_\nmeasure, if I could only make it popular, I would see the golden promise\nof the future of my country. \"Educate your poor and they will work out\ntheir own salvation. Educated Labor can dictate its rights to Capital.\"\n\nHow easy of accomplishment it all seemed to me, who had seen the\npractical benefits arising to a commonwealth that had adopted these\nmottoes. I doubted not that the wiser and better of my own people would\naid and encourage me. Free education would lead to other results.\n\nRiches should be accumulated only by vast and generous industries that\nreached a helping hand to thousands of industrious poor, instead of\ngrinding them out of a few hundred of poorly-paid and over-worked\nartisans. Education in the hands of the poor would be a powerful agent\nwith which they would alleviate their own condition, and defend\nthemselves against oppression and knavery.\n\nThe prisons should be supplied with schools as well as work-rooms, where\nthe intellect should be trained and cultivated, and where moral idiocy,\nby the stern and rigorous law of Justice to Innocence, should be forced\nto deny itself posterity.\n\nNo philanthropical mind ever spread the wings of its fancy for a broader\nflight.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\n\nOur journey was a perilous one with all our precautions. The passage\nthrough the swiftest part of the current almost swamped our boat. The\ncurrent that opposed us was so strong, that when we increased our speed\nour boat appeared to be cleaving its way through a wall of waters. Wauna\nwas perfectly calm, and managed the motor with the steadiest nerves. Her\ncourage inspired me, though many a time I despaired of ever getting out\nof the rapids. When we did, and looked up at the star-gemmed canopy that\nstretches above my own world, and abroad over the dark and desolate\nwaste of waters around us, it gave me an impression of solemn and weird\nmagnificence. It was such a contrast to the vivid nights of Mizora, to\nwhich my eyes had so long been accustomed, that it came upon me like a\nnew scene.\n\nThe stars were a source of wonder and ceaseless delight to Wauna. \"It\nlooks,\" she said, \"as though a prodigal hand had strewn the top of the\natmosphere with diamonds.\"\n\nThe journey over fields of ice and snow was monotonous, but, owing to\nthe skill and knowledge of Mizora displayed in our accoutrements, it was\ndeprived of its severities. The wind whistled past us without any other\ngreeting than its melancholy sound. We looked out from our snug quarters\non the dismal hills of snow and ice without a sensation of distress. The\nAurora Borealis hung out its streamers of beauty, but they were pale\ncompared to what Wauna had seen in her own country. The Esquimaux she\npresumed were animals.\n\nWe traveled far enough south to secure passage upon a trading-vessel\nbound for civilized shores. The sun came up with his glance of fire and\nhis banners of light, laying his glorious touch on cloud and water, and\nkissing the cheek with his warmth. He beamed upon us from the zenith,\nand sank behind the western clouds with a lingering glance of beauty.\nThe moon came up like the ghost of the sun, casting a weird yet tender\nbeauty on every object. To Wauna it was a revelation of magnificence in\nnature beyond her contriving.\n\n\"How grand,\" she exclaimed, \"are the revelations of nature in your\nworld! To look upon them, it seems to me, would broaden and deepen the\nmind with the very vastness of their splendor. Nature has been more\nbountiful to you than to Mizora. The day with its heart of fire, and the\nnight with its pale beauty are grander than ours. They speak of vast and\nincomprehensible power.\"\n\nWhen I took Wauna to the observatory, and she looked upon the countless\nmultitudes of worlds and suns revolving in space so far away that a sun\nand its satellites looked like a ball of mist, she said that words could\nnot describe her sensations.\n\n\"To us,\" she said, \"the leaves of Nature's book are the winds and waves,\nthe bud and bloom and decay of seasons. But here every leaf is a world.\nA mighty hand has sprinkled the suns like fruitful seeds across the\nlimitless fields of space. Can human nature contemplate a scene so grand\nthat reaches so far beyond the grasp of mind, and not feel its own\ninsignificance, and the littleness of selfish actions? And yet you can\nbehold these myriads of worlds and systems of worlds wheeling in the dim\ninfinity of space--a spectacle awful in its vastness--and turn to the\npractice of narrow superstitions?\"\n\nAt last the shores of my native land greeted my longing eyes, and the\nfamiliar scenes of my childhood drew near. But when, after nearly twenty\nyears absence, I stood on the once familiar spot, the graves of my\nheart's dear ones were all that was mine. My little one had died soon\nafter my exile. My father had soon followed. Suspected, and finally\npersecuted by the government, my husband had fled the country, and,\nnearly as I could discover, had sought that universal asylum for the\noppressed of all nations--the United States. And thither I turned my\nsteps.\n\nIn my own country and in France, the friends who had known me in\ngirlhood were surprised at my youthful appearance. I did not explain the\ncause of it to them, nor did I mention the people or country from whence\nI had come. Wauna was my friend and a foreigner--that was all.\n\nThe impression she made was all that I had anticipated. Her unusual\nbeauty and her evident purity attracted attention wherever she went. The\nwonderful melody of her singing was much commented upon, but in Mizora\nshe had been considered but an indifferent singer. But I had made a\nmistake in my anticipation of her personal influence. The gentleness\nand delicacy of her character received the tenderest respect. None who\nlooked upon that face or met the glance of the dark soft eyes ever\ndoubted that the nature that animated them was pure and beautiful. Yet\nit was the respect felt for a character so exceptionably superior that\nimitation and emulation would be impossible.\n\n\"She is too far above the common run of human nature,\" said one\nobserver. \"I should not be surprised if her spirit were already pluming\nits wings for a heavenly flight. Such natures never stay long among us.\"\n\nThe remark struck my heart with a chill of depression. I looked at Wauna\nand wondered why I had noticed sooner the shrinking outlines of the once\nround cheek. Too gentle to show disgust, too noble to ill-treat, the\nspirit of Wauna was chafing under the trying associations. Men and women\nalike regarded her as an impossible character, and I began to realize\nwith a sickening regret that I had made a mistake. In my own country, in\nFrance and England, her beauty was her sole attraction to men. The lofty\nideal of humanity that she represented was smiled at or gently ignored.\n\n\"The world would be a paradise,\" said one philosopher, \"if such\ncharacters were common. But one is like a seed in the ocean; it cannot\ndo much good.\"\n\nWhen we arrived in the United States, its activity and evident progress\nimpressed Wauna with a feeling more nearly akin to companionship. Her\nown character received a juster appreciation.\n\n\"The time is near,\" she said, \"when the New World will be the teacher of\nthe Old in the great lesson of Humanity. You will live to see it\ndemonstrate to the world the justice and policy of giving to every child\nborn under its flag the highest mental, moral and physical training\nknown to the present age. You can hardly realize what twenty-five years\nof free education will bring to it. They are already on the right path,\nbut they are still many centuries behind my own country in civilization,\nin their government and modes of dispensing justice. Yet their free\nschools, as yet imperfect, are, nevertheless, fruitful seeds of\nprogress.\"\n\nYet here the nature of Wauna grew restless and homesick, and she at last\ngave expression to her longing for home.\n\n\"I am not suited to your world,\" she said, with a look of deep sorrow in\nher lovely eyes. \"None of my people are. We are too finely organized. I\ncannot look with any degree of calmness upon the practices of your\ncivilization. It is a common thing to see mothers ill-treat their own\nhelpless little ones. The pitiful cries of the children keep ringing in\nmy ears. Cannot mothers realize that they are whipping a mean spirit\ninto their offspring instead of out. I have heard the most enlightened\ndeny their own statements when selfishness demanded it. I cannot mention\nthe half of the things I witness daily that grates upon my feelings. I\ncannot reform them. It is not for such as I to be a reformer. Those who\nneed reform are the ones to work for it.\"\n\nSorrowfully I bade adieu to my hopes and my search for Alexis, and\nprepared to accompany Wauna's return. We embarked on a whaling vessel,\nand having reached its farthest limit, we started on our perilous\njourney north; perilous for the lack of our boat, of which we could hear\nnothing. It had been left in charge of a party of Esquimaux, and had\neither been destroyed, or was hidden. Our progress, therefore, depended\nentirely upon the Esquimaux. The tribe I had journeyed so far north with\nhad departed, and those whom I solicited to accompany us professed to be\nignorant of the sea I mentioned. Like all low natures, the Esquimaux are\nintensely selfish. Nothing could induce them to assist us but the most\napparent benefit to themselves; and this I could not assure them. The\nhomesickness, and coarse diet and savage surroundings told rapidly on\nthe sensitive nature of Wauna. In a miserable Esquimaux hut, on a pile\nof furs, I saw the flame of a beautiful and grandly noble life die out.\nMy efforts were hopeless; my anguish keen. O Humanity, what have I\nsacrificed for you!\n\n\"Oh, Wauna,\" I pleaded, as I saw the signs of dissolution approaching,\n\"shall I not pray for you?\"\n\n\"Prayers cannot avail me,\" she replied, as her thin hands reached and\nclosed over one of mine. \"I had hoped once more to see the majestic\nhills and smiling valleys of my own sweet land, but I shall not. If I\ncould only go to sleep in the arms of my mother. But the Great Mother of\nus all will soon receive me in her bosom. And oh! my friend, promise me\nthat her dust shall cover me from the sight of men. When my mother\nrocked me to slumber on her bosom, and soothed me with her gentle\nlullaby, she little dreamed that I should suffer and die first. If you\never reach Mizora, tell her only that I sleep the sleep of oblivion. She\nwill know. Let the memory of my suffering die with me.\"\n\n\"Oh, Wauna,\" I exclaimed, in anguish, \"you surely have a soul. How can\nanything so young, so pure, so beautiful, be doomed to annihilation?\"\n\n\"We are not annihilated,\" was the calm reply. \"And as to beauty, are\nthe roses not beautiful? Yet they die and you say it is the end of the\nyear's roses. The birds are harmless, and their songs make the woods\nmelodious with the joy of life, yet they die, and you say they have no\nafter life. We are like the roses, but our lives are for a century and\nmore. And when our lives are ended, the Great Mother gathers us in. We\nare the harvest of the centuries.\"\n\nWhen the dull, gray light of the Arctic morning broke, it fell gently\nupon the presence of Death.\n\nWith the assistance of the Esquimaux, a grave was dug, and a rude wooden\ncross erected on which I wrote the one word \"Wauna,\" which, in the\nlanguage of Mizora, means \"Happiness.\"\n\n\nThe world to which I have returned is many ages behind the civilization\nof Mizora.\n\nThough we cannot hope to attain their perfection in our generation, yet\nmany, very many, evils could be obliterated were we to follow their\nlaws. Crime is as hereditary as disease.\n\nNo savant now denies the transmittable taint of insanity and\nconsumption. There are some people in the world now, who, knowing the\npossibility of afflicting offspring with hereditary disease, have lived\nin ascetic celibacy. But where do we find a criminal who denies himself\noffspring, lest he endow posterity with the horrible capacity for murder\nthat lies in his blood?\n\nThe good, the just, the noble, close heart and eyes to the sweet\nallurements of domestic life, lest posterity suffer physically or\nmentally by them. But the criminal has no restraints but what the law\nenforces. Ignorance, poverty and disease, huddled in dens of\nwretchedness, where they multiply with reckless improvidence, sometimes\nfostered by mistaken charity.\n\nThe future of the world, if it be grand and noble, will be the result of\nUNIVERSAL EDUCATION, FREE AS THE GOD-GIVEN WATER WE DRINK.\n\nIn the United States I await the issue of universal liberty. In this\nrefuge for oppression, my husband found a grave. Childless, homeless and\nfriendless, in poverty and obscurity, I have written the story of my\nwanderings. The world's fame can never warm a heart already dead to\nhappiness; but out of the agony of one human life, may come a lesson for\nmany. Life is a tragedy even under the most favorable conditions.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Mizora: A Prophecy, by Mary E.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
