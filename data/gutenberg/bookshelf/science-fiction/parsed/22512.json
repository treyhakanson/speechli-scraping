R. MERLISS\n\n\n _A man can be killed by a toy gun--he can\n die of fright, for heart attacks can kill.\n What, then, is the deadly thing that must\n be sealed away, forever locked in buried\n concrete--a thing or an idea?_\n\n\nIllustrated by Riley\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nOut of the twenty only one managed to escape the planet. And he did it\nvery simply, merely by walking up to the crowded ticket window at one of\nthe rocket ports and buying passage to Earth. His Army identification\npapers passed the harassed inspection of the agent, and he gratefully\nand silently pocketed the small plastic stub that was handed him in\nexchange for his money.\n\nHe picked his way with infinite care through the hordes of ex-soldiers\nclamoring for passage back to the multitudinous planets from which they\nhad come. Then he slowly climbed the heavy ramp into the waiting rocket.\n\nHe saw with relief that the seats were strongly constructed, built to\nsurvive the pressure of many gravities and he chose one as far removed\nas possible from the other passengers.\n\nHe was still very apprehensive, and, as he waited for the rocket to take\noff, he tried hard to remember the principles of the pulse drive that\npowered the ship, and whether his additional weight would upset its\nefficiency enough to awaken suspicion.\n\nThe seats filled quickly with excited hurrying passengers. Soon he heard\nthe great door clang shut, and saw the red light flicker on, warning of\nthe take-off. He felt a slow surge of pressure as the ship arose from\nthe ground, and his chair creaked ominously with the extra weight. He\nbecame fearful that it might collapse, and he strained forward trying to\nshift some of the pressure through his feet to the floor. He sat that\nway, tense and immobile, for what seemed a long time until abruptly the\nstrain was relieved and he heard the rising and falling whine of the\nrockets that told him the ship was in pulse drive, flickering back and\nforth across the speed of light.\n\nHe realized that the pilots had not discovered his extra weight, and\nthat the initial hazards were over. The important thing was to look like\na passenger, a returning soldier like the others, so that no one would\nnotice him and remember his presence.\n\nHis fellow travelers were by this time chatting with one another, some\nplaying cards, and others watching the teledepth screens. These were the\nadventurers who had flocked from all corners of the galaxy to fight in\nthe first national war in centuries. They were the uncivilized few who\nhad read about battle and armed struggle in their history books and\nfound the old stories exciting.\n\nThey paid no attention to their silent companion who sat quietly looking\nthrough the quartz windows at the diamond-bright stars, tacked against\nthe blackness of infinity.\n\nThe fugitive scarcely moved the entire time of the passage. Finally when\nEarth hung out in the sky like a blue balloon, the ship cut its\npulsations and swung around for a tail landing.\n\nThe atmosphere screamed through the fins of the rocket, and the\ncontinents and the countries, and then the rivers and the mountains took\nshape. The big ship settled down as gently as a snowflake, shuddered a\nfew times and was quiet.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe passengers hurriedly gathered up their scattered belongings and\npushed toward the exit in a great rush to be out and back on Earth.\n\nThe fugitive was the last to leave. He stayed well away from the others,\nbeing fearful that, if he should touch or brush up against someone, his\nidentity might be recognized.\n\nWhen he saw the ramp running from the ship to the ground, he was\ndismayed. It seemed a flimsy structure, supported only by tubular steel.\nFive people were walking down it, and he made a mental calculation of\ntheir weight--about eight hundred pounds he thought. He weighed five\ntimes that. The ramp was obviously never built to support such a load.\n\nHe hesitated, and then he realized that he had caught the eye of the\nstewardess waiting on the ground. A little panicky, he stepped out with\none foot and he was horrified to feel the steel buckle. He drew back\nhastily and threw a quick glance at the stewardess. Fortunately at the\nmoment she was looking down one field and waving at someone.\n\nThe ramp floor was supported by steel tubes at its edges and in its\nexact center. He tentatively put one foot in the middle over the support\nand gradually shifted his weight to it. The metal complained creakily,\nbut held, and he slowly trod the exact center line to Earth. The\nstewardess' back was turned toward him as he walked off across the field\ntoward the customhouse.\n\nHe found it comforting to have under his feet what felt like at least\none yard of cement. He could step briskly and not be fearful of\nbetraying himself.\n\nThere was one further danger: the customs inspector.\n\nHe took his place at the end of the line and waited patiently until it\nled him up to a desk at which a uniformed man sat, busily checking and\nstamping declarations and traveling papers. The official, however, did\nnot even look up when he handed him his passport and identification.\n\n\"Human. You don't have to go through immigration,\" the agent said. \"Do\nyou have anything to declare?\"\n\n\"N-no,\" the traveler said. \"I d-didn't bring anything in.\"\n\n\"Sign the affidavit,\" the agent said and pushed a sheet of paper toward\nhim.\n\nThe traveler picked up a pen from the desk and signed \"Jon Hall\" in a\nclear, perfect script.\n\nThe agent gave it a passing glance and tossed it into a wire basket.\n\nThen he pushed his uniform cap back exposing a bald head. \"You're my\nlast customer for a while, until the rocket from Sirius comes in. Guess\nI might as well relax for a minute.\" He reached into a drawer of the\ndesk and pulled out a package of cigarettes, of which he lit one.\n\n\"You been in the war, too?\" he asked.\n\nHall nodded. He did not want to talk any more than he had to.\n\nThe agent studied his face.\n\n\"That's funny,\" he said after a minute. \"I never would have picked you\nfor one of these so-called adventurers. You're too quiet and peaceful\nlooking. I would have put you down as a doctor or maybe a writer.\"\n\n\"N-no,\" Hall said. \"I w-was in the war.\"\n\n\"Well, that shows you can't tell by looking at a fellow,\" the agent said\nphilosophically. He handed Hall his papers. \"There you are. The left\ndoor leads out to the copter field. Good luck on Earth!\"\n\nHall pocketed the stamped documents. \"Thanks,\" he said. \"I'm glad to be\nhere.\"\n\nHe walked down the wide station room to a far exit and pushed the door\nopen. A few steps farther and he was standing on a cement path dug into\na hillside.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAcross the valley, bright in the noon sun lay the pine covered slopes of\nthe Argus mountains, and at his feet the green Mojave flowering with\norchards stretched far to the north and south. Between the trees, in the\ncenter of the valley, the Sacramento River rolled southward in a\nman-made bed of concrete and steel giving water and life to what had a\ncentury before been dry dead earth.\n\nThere was a small outcropping of limestone near the cement walk, and he\nstepped over to it and sat down. He would have been happy to rest and\nenjoy for a few moments his escape and his triumph, but he had to let\nthe others know so that they might have hope.\n\nHe closed his eyes and groped across the stars toward Grismet. Almost\nimmediately he felt an impatient tug at his mind, strong because there\nwere many clamoring at once to be heard. He counted them. There were\nseventeen. So one more had been captured since he had left Grismet.\n\n\"Be quiet,\" the told them. \"I'll let you see, after a while. First I\nhave to reach the two of us that are still free.\"\n\nObediently, the seventeen were still, and he groped some more and found\nanother of his kind deep in an ice cave in the polar regions of Grismet.\n\n\"How goes it?\" he asked.\n\nThe figure on Grismet lay stretched out at full length on the blue ice,\nhis eyes closed. He answered without moving: \"They discovered my\nradiation about an hour ago. Pretty soon, they'll start blasting through\nthe ice.\"\n\nThe one on Earth felt the chill despair of his comrade and let go. He\ngroped about again until he found the last one, the only other one left.\nHe was squatting in the cellar of a warehouse in the main city of\nGrismet.\n\n\"Have they picked up your trail yet?\" he asked.\n\n\"No,\" answered the one in the cellar. \"They won't for a while. I've\nscattered depots of radiation all through the town. They'll be some time\ntracking them all down, before they can get to me.\"\n\nIn a flash of his mind, Hall revealed his escape and the one on Grismet\nnodded and said: \"Be careful. Be very careful. You are our only hope.\"\n\nHall returned then to the seventeen, and he said with his thoughts: \"All\nright, now you can look.\" Immobile in their darkness, they snatched at\nhis mind, and as he opened his eyes, they, too, saw the splendors of the\nmountains and the valley, the blue sky, and the gold sun high overhead.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe new man was young, only twenty-six. He was lean and dark and very\nenthusiastic about his work. He sat straight in his chair waiting\nattentively while his superior across the desk leafed through a folder.\n\n\"Jordan. Tom Jordan,\" the older man finally said. \"A nice old Earth\nname. I suppose your folks came from there.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" the new man said briskly.\n\nThe chief closed the folder.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"your first job is a pretty important one.\"\n\n\"I realize that, sir,\" Jordan said. \"I know it's a great responsibility\nfor a man just starting with the Commission, but I'll give it every\nthing I have.\"\n\nThe chief leaned back in his seat and scratched his chin thoughtfully.\n\n\"Normally we start a beginner like you working in a pair with an older\nman. But we just haven't got enough men to go around. There are eight\nthousand planets there\"--he pointed with his thumb over his shoulder to\na wall-sized map of the galaxy--\"and we've got to cover every one. It\nseems reasonable that if he escaped this planet, he'll go to another\nthat will by its atmosphere or its temperature give him some natural\nadvantage over us--some place that is either burning hot or at absolute\nzero, or perhaps with a chlorine or sulfur dioxide atmosphere. That's\nwhy\"--he hesitated a minute, but continued because he was a truthful\nman--\"I picked you for Earth. It's the most populated of all the planets\nand it seems the least likely one that he would choose.\"\n\nJordan's face dropped a little bit when he heard the last piece of\ninformation, but he said: \"I understand, sir, and if he's there, I'll\nbring him back.\"\n\nThe chief slouched farther back in his seat. He picked up a shard of\nrubidium that served as a paper weight and toyed with it.\n\n\"I guess you know most of the facts. They are made out of permallium.\nHave you ever seen any of the stuff?\"\n\nThe new man shook his head. \"I read about it though--some new alloy,\nisn't it?\"\n\n\"Plenty new. It's the hardest stuff anybody has ever made. If you set\noff one hundred successive atom blasts over a lump of permallium, you\nmight crystallize and scale maybe a micron off the surface. It will\nstand any temperature or pressure we can produce. That just means\nthere's no way to destroy it.\"\n\nJordan nodded. He felt a little honored that the chief was giving him\nthis explanation in person rather than just turning him over to one of\nthe scientific personnel for a briefing. He did not understand that the\nold man was troubled and was talking the situation through as much for\nhis own sake as for anyone else's.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"That's the problem,\" the chief continued. \"Essentially an\nindestructible machine with a built-in source of power that one can't\nreach. It had to be built that way--a war instrument, you know.\"\n\nHe stopped and looked squarely at the bright young man sitting across\nthe desk. \"This lousy war. You'd think the human race would grow up some\ntime, wouldn't you?\" He filled a pipe with imported Earth tobacco and\nlit it, and took a few deep puffs. \"There's something else. I don't know\nhow they do it, but they can communicate with one another over long\ndistances. That made them very useful for military purposes.\n\n\"They are loyal to one another, too. They try to protect each other and\nkeep one another from being captured. Do you find that surprising?\"\n\nThe question caught Jordan unprepared. \"Well, yes. It is, kind of--\" he\nsaid. \"They are only machines.\"\n\nThe chief closed his eyes for a moment. He seemed tired.\n\n\"Yes,\" he repeated, \"they are only machines. Anyway, we don't know\neverything about them, even yet. There are still a few secret angles, I\nthink. The men who could tell us are either dead or in hiding.\n\n\"There's one fact though that gives us a great advantage. Their\nbrain\"--he stopped on the word and considered it--\"I mean their thinking\napparatus gives off a very penetrating short-wave length radiation which\nyou can pick up on your meters anywhere in a radius of two thousand\nmiles, and you can locate the source accurately if you get within fifty\nmiles.\n\n\"The only real problem you'll have in finding them is the confusion\ncreated by illegal atomic piles. You'd be surprised how many of them we\nhave turned up recently. They are owned by private parties and are run\nillegally to keep from paying the tax on sources of power. You have to\ntrack those down, but once you get them labeled it will be clear\nsailing.\"\n\nHe stopped to take a few puffs on his pipe.\n\n\"Don't try to be a hero,\" he said after a few moments. \"Don't get close\nto the thing you are hunting. None of them yet has injured any of us,\nbut if one should want to, he could crush you to death with two\nfingers. Use the permallium nets and net bombs if you locate him.\"\n\nHe tamped his pipe out. \"Well, that's it,\" he said.\n\nThe new man arose. \"I want you to know that I appreciate the trust you\nhave put in me.\"\n\n\"Sure, sure,\" the chief said, but it was not unfriendly. \"Do you like\nthe job?\"\n\n\"It is a great opportunity,\" Jordan said, and he meant it.\n\n\"What do you think about what we do to them after we capture them?\"\n\nThe new man shrugged. \"I suppose it's the only thing to do. It's not as\nthough they were human.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" the chief said. \"I guess so. Anyway, good luck.\"\n\nJordan arose and shook the chief's hand. However, just as he was\nstepping through the door, his superior asked him another question. \"Did\nyou know that one of them stutters?\"\n\nHe turned back, puzzled. \"Stutters? Why should he stutter? How could\nthat be?\"\n\nThe chief shook his head and started cleaning out his pipe.\n\n\"I don't know for sure. You'd better get started.\" He sat back in his\nseat and watched the back of the new man as he disappeared through the\ndoorway.\n\nThat young fellow has a lot to learn, he thought to himself. But even\nso, maybe he's better off than I am. Maybe I've had too much experience.\nMaybe too much experience puts you back where you started from. You've\ndone the wrong thing so many times and profited so many times from your\nmistakes that you see errors and tragedies in everything.\n\nHe was depressed, and he did something that usually made him feel better\nagain. He reached under the edge of his desk and pulled a little switch\nthat made the galactic map on the wall light up in three-dimensional\ndepth, then he swung around in his chair so he could see it. Eight\nthousand planets that his race had conquered, eight thousand planets\nhundreds of light-years apart. Looking at the map gave him a sense of\naccomplishment and pride in humanity which even a stupid war and its\naftermath could not completely destroy.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJon Hall, the fugitive, walked along the highway leading south from the\nrocket port. There was very little traffic, only an occasional delivery\ntruck carrying meat or groceries. The real highway was half a mile\noverhead where the copters shuttled back and forth up and down the state\nin neat orderly layers.\n\nThe seventeen were inside his head, looking through his eyes, and\nfeasting on the blueness of the sky, and the rich green vegetation that\ncovered the fertile fields. From time to time they talked to him, giving\nadvice, asking questions, or making comments, but mostly they looked,\neach knowing that the hours of their sight might be very few.\n\nAfter walking a while, Hall became aware of someone's footsteps behind\nhim. He stopped suddenly in apprehension and swung around. A dozen or so\npaces away was a red-headed boy of about ten or eleven, dressed in\nplastic overalls, and carrying a basket of ripe raspberries. The stains\nabout his mouth showed that not all the raspberries were carried in the\nbasket.\n\nHall's anxiety faded, and he was glad to see the child. He had hoped to\nmeet someone who was not so old that they would become suspicious, but\nold enough that they might give him directions.\n\nHe waited for the lad to catch up.\n\n\"Hello,\" the boy said. \"I've been walking behind you most of a mile, but\nI guess you didn't hear me.\"\n\n\"It looks as though you've been p-p-picking raspberries,\" Hall said.\n\n\"Yup. My dad owns a patch by the river. Want some?\" He proffered the\nbasket.\n\n\"No, thank you,\" Hall answered. He resumed his walk up the highway with\nthe boy at his side.\n\n\"D-do you live around here,\" he asked.\n\n\"Just up the road a ways.\" The lad studied his companion for a minute.\n\"You stutter, don't you?\"\n\n\"A little.\"\n\n\"There was a boy in my class who used to stutter. The teacher said it\nwas because he thought so far ahead of what he said he got all tangled\nup.\" The boy reached in his basket for a handful of berries and chewed\nthem thoughtfully. \"She was always after him to talk slower, but I guess\nit didn't do any good. He still stutters.\"\n\n\"Is there a p-power plant around here?\" Hall asked. \"You know, where the\nelectricity comes from.\"\n\n\"You mean the place where they have the nu-nuclear fission\"--the boy\nstumbled on the unfamiliar word, but got it out--\"and they don't let you\nin because you get poisoned or something?\"\n\n\"Yes, I think that's it.\"\n\n\"There are two places. There's one over at Red Mountain and another over\nat Ballarat.\"\n\n\"Where are they?\"\n\n\"Well--\" The boy stopped to think. \"Red Mountain's straight ahead, maybe\nten miles, and Ballarat's over there\"--he pointed west across the orange\ngroves--\"maybe fifteen miles.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Hall said. \"Good.\" And he felt glad inside of himself. Maybe it\ncould be done, he thought.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey walked along together. Hall sometimes listening to the chattering\nof the boy beside him, sometimes listening to and answering the distant\nvoices of the seventeen. Abruptly, a few hundred yards before the house\nthat the boy had pointed out as his father's, a small sports car whipped\ndown the highway, coming on them almost without warning. The lad jumped\nsideways, and Hall, to avoid touching him, stepped off the concrete\nroad. His leg sank into the earth up to the mid-calf. He pulled it out\nas quickly as he could.\n\nThe boy was looking at the fast retreating rear of the sports car.\n\n\"Gee,\" he said. \"I sure didn't see them coming.\" Then he caught sight of\nthe deep hole alongside the road, and he stared at it. \"Gosh, you sure\nmade a footprint there,\" he said wonderingly.\n\n\"The ground was soft,\" Hall said. \"C-come along.\"\n\nBut instead of following, the boy walked over to the edge of the road\nand stared into the hole. He tentatively stamped on the earth around it.\n\"This ground isn't soft,\" he said. \"It's hard as a rock.\" He turned and\nlooked at Hall with big eyes.\n\nHall came close to the boy and took hold of his jacket. \"D-don't pay any\nattention to it, son. I just stepped into a soft spot.\"\n\nThe boy tried to pull away. \"I know who you are,\" he said. \"I heard\nabout you on the teledepth.\"\n\nSuddenly, in the way of children, panic engulfed him and he flung his\nbasket away and threw himself back and forth, trying to tear free. \"Let\nme go,\" he screamed. \"Let me go. Let me go.\"\n\n\"Just l-listen to me, son,\" Hall pleaded. \"Just listen to me. I won't\nhurt you.\"\n\nBut the boy was beyond reasoning. Terror stricken, he screamed at the\ntop of his voice, using all his little strength to escape.\n\n\"If you p-promise to l-listen to me, I'll let you go,\" Hall said.\n\n\"I promise,\" the boy sobbed, still struggling.\n\nBut the moment Hall let go of his coat, he tore away and ran as fast as\nhe could over the adjacent field.\n\n\"W-wait--don't run away,\" Hall shouted. \"I won't hurt you. Stay where\nyou are. I couldn't follow you anyway. I'd sink to my hips.\"\n\nThe logic of the last sentence appealed to the frightened lad. He\nhesitated and then stopped and turned around, a hundred feet or so from\nthe highway.\n\n\"L-listen,\" said Hall earnestly. \"The teledepths are wr-wrong. They\nd-didn't tell you the t-truth about us. I d-don't want to hurt anyone.\nAll I n-need is a few hours. D-don't tell anyone for j-just a few hours\nand it'll be all right.\" He paused because he didn't know what to say\nnext.\n\nThe boy, now that he seemed secure from danger had recovered his wits.\nHe plucked a blade of grass from the ground and chewed on an end of it,\nlooking for all the world like a grownup farmer thoughtfully considering\nhis fields. \"Well, I guess you could have hurt me plenty, but you\ndidn't,\" he said. \"That's something.\"\n\n\"Just a few hours,\" Hall said. \"It won't take long. Y-you can tell your\nfather tonight.\"\n\nThe boy suddenly remembered his raspberries when he saw his basket and\nits spilled contents on the highway.\n\n\"Why don't you go along a bit,\" he said. \"I would like to pick up those\nberries I dropped.\"\n\n\"Remember,\" Hall said, \"just a few hours.\" He turned and started\nwalking again toward Red Mountain. Inside his mind, the seventeen asked\nanxiously, \"Do you think he'll give the alarm? Will he report your\npresence?\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nBack on the highway, the boy was gathering the berries back into his\nbasket while he tried to make his mind up.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJordan reached Earth atmosphere about two o'clock in the afternoon. He\nimmediately reported in to the Terrestrial police force, and via the\nteledepth screen spoke with a bored lieutenant. The lieutenant, after\nlistening to Jordan's account of his mission, assured him without any\nparticular enthusiasm of the willingness of the Terrestrial forces to\nco\u00f6perate, and of more value, gave him the location of all licensed\nsources of radiation in the western hemisphere.\n\nThe galactic agent set eagerly to work, and in the next several hours\nuncovered two unlisted radiation sources, both of which he promptly\ninvestigated. In one case, north of Eugene, he found in the backyard of\na metal die company a small atomic pile. The owner was using it as an\nillegal generator of electricity, and when he saw Jordan snooping about\nwith his detection instruments, he immediately offered the agent a\nsizable bribe. It was a grave mistake since Jordan filed charges against\nhim, via teledepth, not only for evading taxes, but also for attempted\nbribery.\n\nThe second strike seemed more hopeful. He picked up strong radiation in\na rather barren area of Montana; however when he landed, he found that\nit was arising from the earth itself. From a short conversation with the\nlocal authorities, he learned that the phenomenon was well known: an\natomic fission plant had been destroyed at that site during the Third\nWorld War.\n\nHe was flying over the lovely blue water of Lake Bonneville, when his\nteledepth screen flickered. He flipped the switch on and the\nlieutenant's picture flooded in.\n\n\"I have a call I think you ought to take,\" the Earth official said. \"It\nseems as though it might be in your line. It's from a sheriff in a small\ntown in California. I'll have the operator plug him in.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAbruptly the picture switched to that of a stout red-faced man wearing\nthe brown uniform of a county peace officer.\n\n\"You're the galactic man?\" the sheriff asked.\n\n\"Yes. My name is Tom Jordan,\" Jordan said.\n\n\"Mine's Berkhammer.\" It must have been warm in California because the\nsheriff pulled out a large handkerchief and mopped his brow. When he was\ndone with that he blew his nose loudly. \"Hay fever,\" he announced.\n\n\"Want to see my credentials?\"\n\n\"Oh sure, sure,\" the sheriff hastily replied. He scrutinized the card\nand badge that Jordan displayed. After a moment, he said, \"I don't know\nwhy I'm looking at those. They might be fakes for all I know. Never saw\nthem before and I'll probably never see them again.\"\n\n\"They're genuine.\"\n\n\"The deuce with formality,\" the sheriff said heavily. \"There's some kid\naround here who thinks he saw that ... that machine you're supposed to\nbe looking for.\"\n\n\"When was that?\" Jordan asked.\n\n\"About four hours ago. Here, I'll let you talk to him yourself.\" He\npulled his big bulk to one side, and a boy and his father walked into\nthe picture. The boy was red-eyed, as though he had been crying. The\nfather was a tall, stoop-shouldered farmer, dressed like his son in\nplastic overalls.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe sheriff patted the boy on the back. \"Come on, Jimmy. Tell the man\nwhat you saw.\"\n\n\"I saw him,\" the boy said sullenly. \"I walked up the highway with him.\"\n\nJordan leaned forward toward the screen.\n\n\"How did you know who he was?\"\n\n\"I knew because when he stepped on the ground, he sank into it up to his\nknee. He tried to say the ground was soft, but it was hard. I know it\nwas hard.\"\n\n\"Why did you wait so long to tell anybody?\" Jordan asked softly.\n\nThe boy looked at him with defiance and dislike in his eyes and kept his\nsmall mouth clamped shut.\n\nHis father nudged him roughly in the ribs.\n\n\"Answer the man,\" he commanded.\n\nJimmy looked down at his shoes.\n\n\"Because he asked me not to tell for a while,\" he said curtly.\n\n\"Stubborn as nails,\" the father said not without pride in his voice.\n\"Got more loyalty to a lousy machine than to the whole human race.\"\n\n\"Which way did he go, Jimmy?\"\n\n\"Toward Red Mountain. I think maybe to the power house. He asked me\nwhere it was.\"\n\n\"What do you think he wants with that?\" the sheriff asked of Jordan.\n\nJordan shrugged and shook his head.\n\n\"Maybe it's all in the kid's head,\" the sheriff suggested. \"These wild\nteledepth programs they look at give them all kinds of ideas.\"\n\n\"It isn't in my head,\" Jimmy said violently. \"I saw him. He stepped on\nthe ground and stuck his foot into it. I talked to him. And I know\nsomething else. He stutters.\"\n\n\"What?\" said the sheriff. \"Now I know you're lying.\"\n\nThe father started dragging the boy by the arm. \"Come on home, Jimmy.\nYou got one more licking coming.\"\n\nJordan, however, was sure the boy was not lying. \"Leave him alone,\" he\nsaid. \"He's right. He did see him.\" He took a fast look at the timepiece\non his panel board. \"I'll be down in an hour and a half. Wait for me.\"\n\nHe flicked the switch off, and kicked up the motors. The ship shot\nsouthward almost as rapidly as a projectile.\n\nHe had topped the Sierras and had just turned into the great central\nvalley of California when, with the impact of a blow, a frightening\nthought occurred to him.\n\nHe flicked the screen on again, and he caught the sheriff sitting behind\nhis desk industriously scratching himself in one armpit.\n\n\"Listen,\" Jordan said, speaking very fast. \"You've got to send out a\nnational alarm. You must get every man you can down to the power plant.\nYou've got to stop him from getting in.\"\n\nThe sheriff stopped scratching himself and stared at Jordan.\n\n\"What are you so het up about, young man?\"\n\n\"Do it, and do it now,\" Jordan almost shouted. \"He'll tear the pile\napart and let the hafnium go off. It'll blow half the state off the\nplanet.\"\n\nThe sheriff was unperturbed. \"Mr. Star boy,\" he said sarcastically, \"any\ngrammar school kid knows that if someone came within a hundred yards of\none of those power-house piles, he'd burn like a match stick. And\nbesides why would he want to blow himself to pieces?\"\n\n\"He's made out of permallium.\" Jordan was shouting now.\n\nThe sheriff suddenly grew pale. \"Get off my screen. I'm calling\nSacramento.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJordan set the ship for maximum speed, well beyond the safety limit. He\nkept peering ahead into the dusk, momentarily fearful that the whole\ncountryside would light up in one brilliant flash. In a few minutes he\nwas sweating and trembling with the tension.\n\nOver Walnut Grove, he recognized the series of dams, reservoirs and\nwater-lifts where the Sacramento was raised up out of its bed and turned\nsouth. For greater speed, he came close to Earth, flying at emergency\nheight, reserved ordinarily for police, firemen, doctors and ambulances.\nHe set his course by sight following the silver road of the river,\nlosing it for ten or fifteen miles at a time where it passed through\nsubterranean tunnels, picking it up again at the surface, always\nshooting south as fast as the atmosphere permitted.\n\nAt seven thirty, when the sun had finally set, he sighted the lights of\nRed Mountain, and he cut his speed and swung in to land. There was no\ntrouble picking out the power plant; it was a big dome-shaped building\nsurrounded by a high wall. It was so brilliantly lit up, that it stood\nout like a beacon, and there were several hundred men milling about\nbefore it.\n\nHe settled down on the lawn inside the walls, and the sheriff came\nbustling up, a little more red in the face than usual.\n\n\"I've been trying to figure for the last hour what the devil I would do\nto stop him if he decided to come here,\" Berkhammer said.\n\n\"He's not here then?\"\n\nThe sheriff shook his head. \"Not a sign of him. We've gone over the\nplace three times.\"\n\nJordan settled back in relief, sitting down in the open doorway of his\nship. \"Good,\" he said wearily.\n\n\"Good!\" the sheriff exploded. \"I don't know whether I'd rather have him\nshow up or not. If this whole business is nothing more than the crazy\nimagination of some kid who ought to get tanned and a star-cop with milk\nbehind his ears, I'm really in the soup. I've sent out an alarm and I've\ngot the whole state jumping. There's a full mechanized battalion of\nstate troops waiting in there.\" He pointed toward the power plant.\n\"They've got artillery and tanks all around the place.\"\n\nJordan jumped down out of the ship. \"Let's see what you've got set up\nhere. In the meantime, stop fretting. I'd rather see you fired than\nvaporized along with fifty million other people.\"\n\n\"I guess you're right there,\" Berkhammer conceded, \"but I don't like to\nhave anyone make a fool out of me.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt Ballarat, an old man, Eddie Yudovich, was the watchman and general\ncaretaker of the electrical generation plant. Actually, his job was a\ncompletely unnecessary one, since the plant ran itself. In its very\ncenter, buried in a mine of graphite were the tubes of hafnium, from\nwhose nuclear explosions flowed a river of electricity without the need\nof human thought or direction.\n\nHe had worked for the company for a long time and when he became\ncrippled with arthritis, the directors gave him the job so that he might\nhave security in his latter years.\n\nYudovich, however, was a proud old man, and he never once acknowledged\nto himself or to anyone else that his work was useless. He guarded and\nchecked the plant as though it were the storehouse of the Terrestrial\nTreasury. Every hour punctually, he made his rounds through the\nbuilding.\n\nAt approximately seven thirty he was making his usual circuit when he\ncame to the second level. What he discovered justified all the years of\npunctilious discharge of his duties. He was startled to see a man\nkneeling on the floor, just above where the main power lines ran. He had\ntorn a hole in the composition floor, and as Yudovich watched, he\nreached in and pulled out the great cable. Immediately the intruder\nglowed in the semidarkness with an unearthly blue shine and sparkles\ncrackled off of his face, hands and feet.\n\nYudovich stood rooted to the floor. He knew very well that no man could\ntouch that cable and live. But as he watched, the intruder handled it\nwith impunity, pulling a length of wire out of his pocket and making\nsome sort of a connection.\n\nIt was too much for the old man. Electricity was obviously being stolen.\nHe roared out at the top of his voice, and stumped over to the wall\nwhere he threw the alarm switch. Immediately, a hundred arc lights\nflashed on, lighting the level brighter than the noon sun, and a\ntremendously loud siren started wailing its warning to the whole\ncountryside.\n\nThe intruder jumped up as though he had been stabbed. He dropped the\nwires, and after a wild look around him, he ran at full speed toward the\nfar exit.\n\n\"Hold on there,\" Yudovich shouted and tried to give chase, but his\nswollen, crooked knees almost collapsed with the effort.\n\nHis eyes fell on a large wrench lying on a worktable, and he snatched it\nup and threw it with all his strength. In his youth he had been a ball\nplayer with some local fame as a pitcher, and in his later life, he was\naddicted to playing horseshoes. His aim was, therefore, good, and the\nwrench sailed through the air striking the runner on the back of the\nhead. Sparks flew and there was a loud metallic clang, the wrench\nrebounding high in the air. The man who was struck did not even turn his\nhead, but continued his panicky flight and was gone in a second.\n\nWhen he realized there was no hope of effecting a capture, Yudovich\nstumped over to see the amount of the damage. A hole had been torn in\nthe floor, but the cable itself was intact.\n\nSomething strange caught his attention. Wherever the intruder had put\nhis foot down, there were many radiating cracks in the composition\nfloor, just as though someone had struck a sheet of ice with a sledge\nhammer.\n\n\"I'll be danged,\" he said to himself. \"I'll be danged and double\ndanged.\"\n\nHe turned off the alarm and then went downstairs to the teledepth screen\nto notify the sheriff's office.\n\nA few hundred yards from the powerhouse, Jon Hall stood in the darkness,\nlistening to the voices of his fellows. There were eighteen of them, not\nseventeen, for a short while before the one in the ice cave had been\ncaptured, and they railed at him with a bitter hopeless anger.\n\nHe looked toward the bright lights of the powerhouse, considering\nwhether he should return. \"It's too late,\" said one of them. \"The alarm\nis already out.\" \"Go into the town and mix with the people,\" another\nsuggested. \"If you stay within a half mile of the hafnium pile, the\ndetection man will not be able to pick up your radiation and maybe you\nwill have a second chance.\"\n\nThey all assented in that, and Hall, weary of making his own decisions\nturned toward the town. He walked through a tree-lined residential\nstreet, the houses with neatly trimmed lawns, and each with a copter\nparked on the roof. In almost every house the teledepths were turned on\nand he caught snatches of bulletins about himself: \"... Is known to be\nin the Mojave area.\" \"... About six feet in height and very similar to a\nhuman being. When last seen, he was dressed in--\" \"Governor Leibowitz\nhas promised speedy action and attorney general Markle has stated--\"\n\nThe main street of Ballarat was brilliantly lighted. Many of the\nresidents, aroused by the alarm from the powerhouse, were out, standing\nin small groups in front of the stores and talking excitedly to one\nanother.\n\nHe hesitated, unwilling to walk through the bright street, but uncertain\nwhere to turn. Two men talking loudly came around the corner suddenly\nand he stepped back into a store entrance to avoid them. They stopped\ndirectly in front of him. One of them, an overalled farm hand from his\nlooks, said, \"He killed a kid just a little while ago. My brother-in-law\nheard it.\"\n\n\"Murderer,\" the other said viciously.\n\nThe farmer turned his head and his glance fell on Hall. \"Well, a new\nface in town,\" he said after a moment's inspection. \"Say I bet you're a\nreporter from one of the papers, aren't you?\"\n\nHall came out of the entrance and tried to walk around the two men, but\nthe farmer caught him by the sleeve.\n\n\"A reporter, huh? Well, I got some news for you. That thing from Grismet\njust killed a kid.\"\n\nHall could restrain himself no longer.\n\n\"That's a lie,\" he said coldly.\n\nThe farmer looked him up and down.\n\n\"What do you know about it,\" he demanded. \"My brother-in-law got it from\nsomebody in the state guard.\"\n\n\"It's still a lie.\"\n\n\"Just because it's not on the teledepth, you say it's a lie,\" the farmer\nsaid belligerently. \"Not everything is told on the teledepth, Mr.\nWiseheimer. They're keeping it a secret. They don't want to scare the\npeople.\"\n\nHall started to walk away, but the farmer blocked his path.\n\n\"Who are you anyway? Where do you live? I never saw you before,\" he said\nsuspiciously.\n\n\"Aw, Randy,\" his companion said, \"don't go suspecting everybody.\"\n\n\"I don't like anyone to call me a liar.\"\n\nHall stepped around the man in his path, and turned down the street. He\nwas boiling inside with an almost uncontrollable fury.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA few feet away, catastrophe suddenly broke loose. A faulty section of\nthe sidewalk split without warning under his feet and he went pitching\nforward into the street. He clutched desperately at the trunk of a tall\npalm tree, but with a loud snap, it broke, throwing him head on into a\nparked road car. The entire front end of the car collapsed like an egg\nshell under his weight.\n\nFor a long moment, the entire street was dead quiet. With difficulty,\nHall pulled himself to his feet. Pale, astonished faces were staring at\nhim from all sides.\n\nSuddenly the farmer started screaming. \"That's him. I knew it. That's\nhim.\" He was jumping up and down with excitement.\n\nHall turned his back and walked in the other direction. The people in\nfront of him faded away, leaving a clear path.\n\nHe had gone a dozen steps when a man with a huge double-barreled shotgun\npopped out from a store front just ahead. He aimed for the middle of\nHall's chest and fired both barrels.\n\nThe blast and the shot struck Hall squarely, burning a large hole in his\nshirt front. He did not change his pace, but continued step by step.\n\nThe man with the gun snatched two shells out of his pocket and\nfrantically tried to reload. Hall reached out and closed his hand over\nthe barrel of the gun and the blue steel crumpled like wet paper.\n\nFrom across the street, someone was shooting at him with a rifle.\nSeveral times a bullet smacked warmly against his head or his back.\n\nHe continued walking slowly up the street. At its far end several men\nappeared dragging a small howitzer--probably the only piece in the local\narmory. They scurried around it, trying to get it aimed and loaded.\n\n\"Fools. Stupid fools,\" Hall shouted at them.\n\nThe men could not seem to get the muzzle of the gun down, and when he\nwas a dozen paces from it they took to their heels. He tore the heavy\ncannon off of its carriage and with one blow of his fist caved it in. He\nleft it lying in the street broken and useless.\n\nAlmost as suddenly as it came, his anger left him. He stopped and looked\nback at the people cringing in the doorways.\n\n\"You poor, cruel fools,\" Hall said again.\n\nHe sat down in the middle of the street on the twisted howitzer barrel\nand buried his head in his hands. There was nothing else for him to do.\nHe knew that in just a matter of seconds, the ships with their\npermallium nets and snares would be on him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSince Jordan's ship was not large enough to transport Jon Hall's great\nweight back to Grismet, the terrestrial government put at the agent's\ndisposal a much heavier vessel, one room of which had been hastily lined\nwith permallium and outfitted as a prison cell. A pilot by the name of\nWilkins went with the ship. He was a battered old veteran, given to\ncigar smoking, clandestine drinking and card playing.\n\nThe vessel took off, rose straight through the atmosphere for about\nforty miles, and then hung, idly circling Earth, awaiting clearance\nbefore launching into the pulse drive. A full course between Earth and\nGrismet had to be plotted and cleared by the technicians at the dispatch\ncenter because the mass of the vessel increased so greatly with its\npulsating speed that if any two ships passed within a hundred thousand\nmiles of each other, they would at least be torn from their course, and\nmight even be totally destroyed.\n\nWilkins had proposed a pinochle game, and he and Jordan sat playing in\nthe control room.\n\nThe pilot had been winning and he was elated. \"Seventy-six dollars so\nfar,\" he announced after some arithmetic. \"The easiest day's pay I made\nthis month.\"\n\nJordan shuffled the cards and dealt them out, three at a time. He was\ntroubled by his own thoughts, and so preoccupied that he scarcely\nfollowed the game.\n\n\"Spades, again,\" the pilot commented gleefully. \"Well, ain't that too\nbad for you.\" He gave his cigar a few chomps and played a card.\n\nJordan had been looking out of the window. The ship had tilted and he\ncould see without rising the rim of Earth forming a beautiful geometric\narc, hazy and blue in its shimmering atmosphere.\n\n\"Come on, play,\" the pilot said, impatiently. \"I just led an ace.\"\n\nJordan put down his cards. \"I guess I better quit,\" he said.\n\n\"What the devil!\" the pilot said angrily. \"You can't quit like that in\nthe middle of a deal. I got a flush and aces.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Jordan said, \"but I'm going to lie down in my cabin until\nwe are given clearance.\"\n\nHe opened the door of the little room and went into the hall. He walked\ndown past his own cabin and stopped in front of another door, a new one\nthat was sheathed in permallium. He hesitated a few moments; then he\nsnapped open the outside latch and walked in, letting the door swing\nclosed behind him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHall lay unmoving in the middle of the floor, his legs and arms fastened\nin greaves of permallium.\n\nJordan was embarrassed. He did not look directly at the robot.\n\n\"I don't know whether you want to talk to me or not,\" he started. \"If\nyou don't want to, that's all right. But, I've followed you since you\nlanded on Earth, and I don't understand why you did what you did. You\ndon't have to tell me, but I wish you would. It would make me feel\nbetter.\"\n\nThe robot shrugged--a very human gesture, Jordan noted.\n\n\"G-go ahead and ask me,\" he said. \"It d-doesn't make any difference\nnow.\"\n\nJordan sat down on the floor. \"The boy was the one who gave you away. If\nnot for him, no one would have ever known what planet you were on. Why\ndid you let the kid get away?\"\n\nThe robot looked straight at the agent. \"Would you kill a child?\" he\nasked.\n\n\"No, of course not,\" Jordan said a little bit annoyed, \"but I'm not a\nrobot either.\" He waited for a further explanation, but when he saw none\nwas coming, he said: \"I don't know what you were trying to do in that\npowerhouse at Ballarat, but, whatever it was, that old man couldn't have\nstopped you. What happened?\"\n\n\"I l-lost my head,\" the robot said quietly. \"The alarm and the lights\nrattled me, and I got into a p-panic.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Jordan, frustrated, not really seeing at all. He sat back\nand thought for a moment. \"Let me put it this way. Why do you stutter?\"\n\nHall smiled a wry smile. \"Th-that used to be a m-military secret,\" he\nsaid. \"It's our one weakness--the one Achilles heel in a m-machine that\nwas meant to be invulnerable.\"\n\nHe struggled to a sitting position. \"You see, we were m-made as\ns-soldiers and had to have a certain loyalty to the country that m-made\nus. Only living things are loyal--machines are not. We had to think like\nhuman beings.\"\n\nJordan's brows contracted as he tried to understand the robot.\n\n\"You mean you have a transplanted human brain?\" he asked incredulously.\n\n\"In a way,\" Hall said. \"Our b-brains are permallium strips on which the\nmind of some human donor was m-magnetically imprinted. My mind was\ncopied f-from a man who stuttered and who got panicky when the going got\nrough, and who couldn't kill a child no matter what was at s-stake.\"\n\nJordan felt physically ill. Hall was human and he was immortal. And\naccording to galactic decree, he, like his fellows, was to be manacled\nin permallium and fixed in a great block of cement, and that block was\nto be dropped into the deep silent depths of the Grismet ocean, to be\nslowly covered by the blue sediment that gradually filters down through\nthe miles of ocean water to stay immobile and blind for countless\nmillions of years.\n\nJordan arose to his feet. He could think of nothing further to say.\n\nHe stopped, however, with the door half open, and asked: \"One more\nquestion--what did you want with the electrical generator plants on\nEarth?\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nSlowly and without emotion Hall told him, and when he understood, he\nbecame even sicker.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe went across to his cabin and stood for a while looking out the\nwindow. Then he lit a cigarette and lay down on his bunk thinking. After\na time, he put out the cigarette and walked into the hall where he paced\nup and down.\n\nAs he passed the cell door for about the tenth time, he suddenly swung\naround and lifted the latch and entered. He went over to the robot, and\nwith a key that he took from his pocket, he unlocked the greaves and\nchains.\n\n\"There's no point in keeping you bound up like this,\" he said. \"I don't\nthink you're very dangerous.\" He put the key back in his pocket.\n\n\"I suppose you know that this ship runs on an atomic pile,\" he said in a\nconversational tone of voice. \"The cables are just under the floor in\nthe control room and they can be reached through a little trap door.\"\n\nJordan looked directly into Hall's face. The robot was listening with\ngreat intentness.\n\n\"Well,\" the agent said, \"we'll probably be leaving Earth's atmosphere in\nabout fifteen minutes. I think I'll go play pinochle with the pilot.\"\n\nHe carefully left the door of the cell unlatched as he left. He walked\nto the control room and found Wilkins, a dry cigar butt clenched between\nhis teeth, absorbed in a magazine.\n\n\"Let's have another game,\" Jordan said. \"I want some of that\nseventy-six dollars back.\"\n\nWilkins shook his head. \"I'm in the middle of a good story here. Real\nsexy. I'll play you after we take off.\"\n\n\"Nothing doing,\" Jordan said sharply. \"Let's play right now.\"\n\nWilkins kept reading. \"We got an eighteen-hour flight in front of us.\nYou have lots of time.\"\n\nThe agent snatched the magazine out of his hands. \"We're going to play\nright now in my cabin,\" he said.\n\n\"You quit when I have aces and a flush, and now you come back and want\nto play again. That's not sportsmanlike,\" Wilkins complained, but he\nallowed himself to be led back to Jordan's cabin. \"I never saw anybody\nso upset about losing a miserable seventy-six bucks,\" was his final\ncomment.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe robot lay perfectly still until he heard the door to Jordan's cabin\nslam shut, and then he arose as quietly as he could and stole out into\nthe hall. The steel of the hall floor groaned, but bore his weight, and\ncarefully, trembling with excitement inside of his ponderous metallic\nbody, he made his way to the control room. He knelt and lifted the\nlittle trap door and found the naked power cable, pulsating with\nelectrical current.\n\nIn a locker under the panel board he found a length of copper wire. It\nwas all he needed for the necessary connection.\n\nSince his capture, his fellows on Grismet had been silent with despair,\nbut as he knelt to close the circuit, their minds flooded in on him and\nhe realized with a tremendous horror that there were now nineteen, that\nall except he had been bound and fixed in their eternal cement prisons.\n\n\"We are going to have our chance,\" he told them. \"We won't have much\ntime, but we will have our chance.\"\n\nHe closed the circuit and a tremendous tide of electric power flowed\ninto his head. Inside that two-inch shell of permallium was a small\nstrip of metal tape on whose electrons and atoms were written the\nborrowed mind of a man. Connected to the tape was a minute instrument\nfor receiving and sending electromagnetic impulses--the chain by which\nthe mind of one robot was tied to that of another.\n\nThe current surged in and the tiny impulses swelled in strength and\npoured out through the hull of the ship in a great cone that penetrated\nEarth's atmosphere in a quadrant that extended from Baffin land to\nOmaha, and from Hawaii to Labrador. The waves swept through skin and\nbone and entered the sluggish gelatinous brain of sentient beings,\nsetting up in those organs the same thoughts and pictures that played\namong the electrons of the permallium strip that constituted Jon Hall's\nmind.\n\nAll nineteen clamored to be heard, for Hall to relay their voices to\nEarth, but he held them off and first he told his story.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Casseiopeian delegate to the Galactic Senate was at the moment\nfinishing his breakfast. He was small and furry, not unlike a very large\nsquirrel, and he sat perched on a high chair eating salted roast almonds\nof which he was very fond.\n\nSuddenly a voice started talking inside of his head, just as it did at\nthat very second inside the heads of thirteen billion other inhabitants\nof the northwest corner of Earth. The Casseiopeian delegate was so\nstartled that he dropped the dish of almonds, his mouth popping open,\nhis tiny red tongue inside flickering nervously. He listened spellbound.\n\nThe voice told him of the war on Grismet and of the permallium\nconstructed robots, and of the cement blocks. This, however, he already\nknew, because he had been one of the delegates to the Peace Conference\nwho had decided to dispose of the robots. The voice, however, also told\nhim things he did not know, such as the inability of the robots to\ncommit any crime that any other sane human being would not commit, of\ntheir very simple desire to be allowed to live in peace, and most of all\nof their utter horror for the fate a civilized galaxy had decreed for\nthem.\n\nWhen the voice stopped, the Casseiopeian delegate was a greatly shaken\nlittle being.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBack on the ship, Hall opened the circuit to the nineteen, and they\nspoke in words, in memory pictures and in sensations.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA copter cab driver was hurrying with his fare from Manhattan to Oyster\nBay. Suddenly, in his mind, he became a permallium robot. He was bound\nwith cables of the heavy metal, and was suspended upside down in a huge\ncement block. The stone pressed firmly on his eyes, his ears, and his\nchest. He was completely immobile, and worst of all, he knew that above\nhis head for six miles lay the great Grismet Ocean, with the blue mud\nslowly settling down encasing the cement in a stony stratum that would\nlast till the planet broke apart.\n\nThe cab driver gasped: \"What the hell.\" His throat was so dry he could\nscarcely talk. He turned around to his fare, and the passenger, a young\nman, was pale and trembling.\n\n\"You seeing things, too?\" the driver asked.\n\n\"I sure am,\" the fare said unsteadily. \"What a thing to do.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor fifteen minutes, over the northwest quadrant of Earth, the words and\nthe pictures went out, and thirteen billion people knew suddenly what\nlay in the hearts and minds of nineteen robots.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA housewife in San Rafael was at the moment in a butcher shop buying\nmeat for her family. As the thoughts and images started pouring into her\nmind, she remained stock-still, her package of meat forgotten on the\ncounter. The butcher, wiping his bloodied hands on his apron froze in\nthat position, an expression of horror and incredulity on his face.\n\nWhen the thoughts stopped coming in, the butcher was the first to come\nout of the trancelike state.\n\n\"Boy,\" he said, \"that's sure some way of sending messages. Sure beats\nthe teledepths.\"\n\nThe housewife snatched her meat off the counter. \"Is that all you think\nof,\" she demanded angrily.\n\n\"That's a terrible thing that those barbarians on Grismet are doing to\nthose ... those people. Why didn't they tell us that they were human.\"\nShe stalked out of the shop, not certain what she would do, but\ndetermined to do something.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the ship Hall reluctantly broke off the connection and replaced the\ntrap door. Then he went back to his cell and locked himself in. He had\naccomplished his mission; its results now lay in the opinions of men.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJordan left the ship immediately on landing, and took a copter over to\nthe agency building. His conversation with his superior was something he\nwanted to get over with as soon as possible.\n\nThe young woman at the secretary's desk looked at him coldly and led him\ndirectly into the inner office. The chief was standing up in front of\nthe map of the galaxy, his hands in his pockets, his eyes an icy blue.\n\n\"I've been hearing about you,\" he said without a greeting.\n\nJordan sat down. He was tense and jumpy but tried not to show it. \"I\nsuppose you have,\" he said, adding, after a moment, \"Sir.\"\n\n\"How did that robot manage to break out of his cell and get to the power\nsource on the ship in the first place?\"\n\n\"He didn't break out,\" Jordan said slowly. \"I let him out.\"\n\n\"I see,\" the chief said, nodding. \"You let him out. I see. No doubt you\nhad your reasons.\"\n\n\"Yes, I did. Look--\" Jordan wanted to explain, but he could not find the\nwords. It would have been different if the robots' messages had reached\nGrismet; he would not have had to justify himself then. But they had\nnot, and he could not find a way to tell this cold old man of what he\nhad learned about the robots and their unity with men. \"I did it because\nit was the only decent thing to do.\"\n\n\"I see,\" the chief said. \"You did it because you have a heart.\" He\nleaned suddenly forward, both hands on his desk. \"It's good for a man to\nhave a heart and be compassionate. He's not worth anything if he isn't.\nBut\"--and he shook his finger at Jordan as he spoke--\"that man is going\nto be compassionate at his own expense, not at the expense of the\nagency. Do you understand that?\"\n\n\"I certainly do,\" Jordan answered, \"but you have me wrong if you think\nI'm here to make excuses or to apologize. Now, if you will get on with\nmy firing, sir, I'll go home and have my supper.\"\n\nThe chief looked at him for a long minute. \"Don't you care about your\nposition in the agency?\" he asked quietly.\n\n\"Sure I do,\" Jordan said almost roughly. \"It's the work I wanted to do\nall my life. But, as you said, what I did, I did at my own expense.\nLook, sir, I don't like this any better than you do. Why don't you fire\nme and let me go home? Your prisoner's safely locked up in the ship.\"\n\nFor answer the chief tossed him a stellogram. Jordan glanced at the\nfirst few words and saw that it was from Galactic Headquarters on Earth.\nHe put it back on the desk without reading it through.\n\n\"I know that I must have kicked up a fuss. You don't have to spell it\nout for me.\"\n\n\"Read it,\" the chief said impatiently.\n\nJordan took back the stellogram and examined it. It read.\n\n  To: Captain Lawrence Macrae Detection Agency, Grismet.\n\n  From: Prantal Aminopterin Delegate from Casseiopeia Chairman, Grismet\n    Peace Committee of the Galactic Senate.\n\n  Message: You are hereby notified that the committee by a vote of 17-0\n    has decided to rescind its order of January 18, 2214, directing the\n    disposal of the permallium robots of Grismet. Instead, the committee\n    directs that you remove from their confinement all the robots and\n    put them in some safe place where they will be afforded reasonable\n    and humane treatment.\n\n  The committee will arrive in Grismet some time during the next month\n    to decide on permanent disposition.\n\nJordan's heart swelled as he read the gram. \"It worked,\" he said. \"They\nhave changed their minds. It won't be so bad being discharged now.\" He\nput the paper back on the desk and arose to go.\n\nThe chief smiled and it was like sunlight suddenly flooding over an\narctic glacier. \"Discharged? Now who's discharging you? I'd sooner do\nwithout my right arm.\"\n\nHe reached in a desk drawer and pulled out a bottle of old Earth bourbon\nand two glasses. He carefully poured out a shot into each glass, and\nhanded one to Jordan.\n\n\"I like a man with a heart, and if you get away with it, why then you\nget away with it. And that's just what you've done.\"\n\nHe sat down and started sipping his whisky. Jordan stood uncertainly\nabove him, his glass in his hand.\n\n\"Sit down, son,\" the old man said. \"Sit down and tell me about your\nadventures on Earth.\"\n\nJordan sat down, put his feet on the desk and took a sizable swallow of\nhis whisky.\n\n\"Well, Larry,\" he started, \"I got into Earth atmosphere about 2:40\no'clock--\"\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\nThis etext was produced from _Astounding Science Fiction_ April 1955.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright\non this publication was renewed.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
