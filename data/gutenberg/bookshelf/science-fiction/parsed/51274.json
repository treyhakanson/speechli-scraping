BADE\n\n                       Illustrated by L. WOROMAY\n\n           [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n                 Galaxy Science Fiction October 1951.\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n\n\n\n\n               To the men of the future, the scientific\n                goals of today were as incomprehensible\n               as the ancient quest for the Holy Grail!\n\n\nThere was a thump. Maitland stirred, came half awake, and opened his\neyes. The room was dark except where a broad shaft of moonlight from\nthe open window fell on the foot of his bed. Outside, the residential\nsection of the Reservation slept silently under the pale illumination\nof the full Moon. He guessed sleepily that it was about three o'clock.\n\nWhat had he heard? He had a definite impression that the sound had come\nfrom within the room. It had sounded like someone stumbling into a\nchair, or--\n\nSomething moved in the darkness on the other side of the room. Maitland\nstarted to sit up and it was as though a thousand volts had shorted his\nbrain....\n\nThis time, he awoke more normally. He opened his eyes, looked through\nthe window at a section of azure sky, listened to the singing of birds\nsomewhere outside. A beautiful day. In the middle of the process of\nstretching his rested muscles, arms extended back, legs tensed, he\nfroze, looking up--for the first time really seeing the ceiling. He\nturned his head, then rolled off the bed, wide awake.\n\n_This wasn't his room!_\n\nThe lawn outside wasn't part of the Reservation! Where the labs and\nthe shops should have been, there was deep prairie grass, then a green\nocean pushed into waves by the breeze stretching to the horizon. This\nwasn't the California desert! Down the hill, where the liquid oxygen\nplant ought to have been, a river wound across the scene, almost hidden\nbeneath its leafy roof of huge ancient trees.\n\nShock contracted Maitland's diaphragm and spread through his body.\nHis breathing quickened. _Now_ he remembered what had happened during\nthe night, the sound in the darkness, the dimly seen figure, and\nthen--what? Blackout....\n\nWhere was he? Who had brought him here? For what purpose?\n\nHe thought he knew the answer to the last of those questions. As\na member of the original atomic reaction-motor team, he possessed\ninformation that other military powers would very much like to obtain.\nIt was absolutely incredible that anyone had managed to abduct him from\nthe heavily guarded confines of the Reservation, yet someone had done\nit. How?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe pivoted to inspect the room. Even before his eyes could take in\nthe details, he had the impression that there was something wrong\nabout it. To begin with, the style was unfamiliar. There were no\nstraight lines or sharp corners anywhere. The walls were paneled in\nfeatureless blue plastic and the doors were smooth surfaces of metal,\nhalf ellipses, without knobs. The flowing lines of the chair and table,\nbuilt apparently from an aluminum alloy, somehow gave the impression\nof arrested motion. Even after allowances were made for the outlandish\ndesign, something about the room still was not right.\n\nHis eyes returned to the doors, and he moved over to study the nearer\none. As he had noticed, there was no knob, but at the right of this\none, at about waist level, a push-button projected out of the wall. He\npressed it; the door slid aside and disappeared. Maitland glanced in at\nthe disclosed bathroom, then went over to look at the other door.\n\nThere was no button beside this one, nor any other visible means of\ncausing it to open.\n\nBaffled, he turned again and looked at the large open window--and\nrealized what it was that had made the room seem so queer.\n\nIt did not look like a jail cell. There were no bars....\n\nStriding across the room, he lunged forward to peer out and violently\nbanged his forehead. He staggered back, grimacing with pain, then\nreached forward cautious fingers and discovered a hard sheet of stuff\nso transparent that he had not even suspected its presence. Not glass!\nGlass was never this clear or strong. A plastic, no doubt, but one he\nhadn't heard of. Security sometimes had disadvantages.\n\nHe looked out at the peaceful vista of river and prairie. The character\nof the sunlight seemed to indicate that it was afternoon. He became\naware that he was hungry.\n\nWhere the devil could this place be? And--muscles tightened about his\nempty stomach--what was in store for him here?\n\nHe stood trembling, acutely conscious that he was afraid and helpless,\nuntil a flicker of motion at the bottom of the hill near the river drew\nhis attention. Pressing his nose against the window, he strained his\neyes to see what it was.\n\nA man and a woman were coming toward him up the hill. Evidently they\nhad been swimming, for each had a towel; the man's was hung around his\nneck, and the woman was still drying her bobbed black hair.\n\nMaitland speculated on the possibility that this might be Sweden; he\ndidn't know of any other country where public bathing at this time\nof year was customary. However, that prairie certainly didn't look\nScandinavian....\n\nAs they came closer, he saw that both of them had dark uniform suntans\nand showed striking muscular development, like persons who had trained\nfor years with weights. They vanished below his field of view,\npresumably into the building.\n\nHe sat down on the edge of the cot and glared helplessly at the floor.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAbout half an hour later, the door he couldn't open slid aside into the\nwall. The man Maitland had seen outside, now clad in gray trunks and\nsandals, stood across the threshold looking in at him. Maitland stood\nup and stared back, conscious suddenly that in his rumpled pajamas he\nmade an unimpressive figure.\n\nThe fellow looked about forty-five. The first details Maitland noticed\nwere the forehead, which was quite broad, and the calm, clear eyes.\nThe dark hair, white at the temples, was combed back, still damp from\nswimming. Below, there was a wide mouth and a firm, rounded chin.\n\nThis man was intelligent, Maitland decided, and extremely sure of\nhimself.\n\nSomehow, the face didn't go with the rest of him. The man had the head\nof a thinker, the body of a trained athlete--an unusual combination.\n\nImpassively, the man said, \"My name is Swarts. You want to know where\nyou are. I am not going to tell you.\" He had an accent, European, but\notherwise unidentifiable. Possibly German. Maitland opened his mouth\nto protest, but Swarts went on, \"However, you're free to do all the\nguessing you want.\" Still there was no suggestion of a smile.\n\n\"Now, these are the rules. You'll be here for about a week. You'll have\nthree meals a day, served in this room. You will not be allowed to\nleave it except when accompanied by myself. You will not be harmed in\nany way, provided you cooperate. And you can forget the silly idea that\nwe want your childish secrets about rocket motors.\" Maitland's heart\njumped. \"My reason for bringing you here is altogether different. I\nwant to give you some psychological tests....\"\n\n\"Are you crazy?\" Maitland asked quietly. \"Do you realize that at this\nmoment one of the greatest hunts in history must be going on? I'll\nadmit I'm baffled as to where we are and how you got me here--but it\nseems to me that you could have found someone less conspicuous to give\nyour tests to.\"\n\nBriefly, then, Swarts did smile. \"They won't find you,\" he said. \"Now,\ncome with me.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter that outlandish cell, Swarts' laboratory looked rather\ncommonplace. There was something like a surgical cot in the center, and\na bench along one wall supported several electronics cabinets. A couple\nof them had cathode ray tube screens, and they all presented a normal\ncomplement of meters, pilot lights, and switches. Cables from them ran\nacross the ceiling and came to a focus above the high flat cot in the\ncenter of the room.\n\n\"Lie down,\" Swarts said. When Maitland hesitated, Swarts added,\n\"Understand one thing--the more you cooperate, the easier things will\nbe for you. If necessary, I will use coercion. I can get all my results\nagainst your will, if I must. I would prefer not to. Please don't make\nme.\"\n\n\"What's the idea?\" Maitland asked. \"What is all this?\"\n\nSwarts hesitated, though not, Maitland astonishedly felt, to evade an\nanswer, but to find the proper words. \"You can think of it as a lie\ndetector. These instruments will record your reactions to the tests I\ngive you. That is as much as you need to know. Now lie down.\"\n\nMaitland stood there for a moment, deliberately relaxing his tensed\nmuscles. \"Make me.\"\n\nIf Swarts was irritated, he didn't show it. \"That was the first test,\"\nhe said. \"Let me put it another way. I would appreciate it a lot if\nyou'd lie down on this cot. I would like to test my apparatus.\"\n\nMaitland shook his head stubbornly.\n\n\"I see,\" Swarts said. \"You want to find out what you're up against.\"\n\nHe moved so fast that Maitland couldn't block the blow. It was to the\nsolar plexus, just hard enough to double him up, fighting for breath.\nHe felt an arm under his back, another behind his knees. Then he was on\nthe cot. When he was able to breathe again, there were straps across\nhis chest, hips, knees, ankles, and arms, and Swarts was tightening a\nclamp that held his head immovable.\n\nPresently, a number of tiny electrodes were adhering to his temples and\nto other portions of his body, and a minute microphone was clinging to\nthe skin over his heart. These devices terminated in cables that hung\nfrom the ceiling. A sphygmomanometer sleeve was wrapped tightly around\nhis left upper arm, its rubber tube trailing to a small black box\nclamped to the frame of the cot. Another cable left the box and joined\nthe others.\n\nSo--Maitland thought--Swarts could record changes in his skin\npotential, heartbeat, and blood pressure: the involuntary responses of\nthe body to stimuli.\n\nThe question was, what were the stimuli to be?\n\n\"Your name,\" said Swarts, \"is Robert Lee Maitland. You are thirty-four\nyears old. You are an engineer, specialty heat transfer, particularly\nas applied to rocket motors.... No, Mr. Maitland, I'm not going to\nquestion you about your work; just forget about it. Your home town is\nMadison, Wisconsin....\"\n\n\"You seem to know everything about me,\" Maitland said defiantly,\nlooking up into the hanging forest of cabling. \"Why this recital?\"\n\n\"I do not know everything about you--yet. And I'm testing the\nequipment, calibrating it to your reactions.\" He went on, \"Your\nfavorite recreations are chess and reading what you term science\nfiction. Maitland, _how would you like to go to the Moon_?\"\n\nSomething eager leaped in Maitland's breast at the abrupt question, and\nhe tried to turn his head. Then he forced himself to relax. \"What do\nyou mean?\"\n\nSwarts was chuckling. \"I really hit a semantic push-button there,\ndidn't I? Maitland, I brought you here because you're a man who wants\nto go to the Moon. I'm interested in finding out _why_.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the evening a girl brought Maitland his meal. As the door slid\naside, he automatically stood up, and they stared at each other for\nseveral seconds.\n\nShe had the high cheekbones and almond eyes of an Oriental, skin that\nglowed like gold in the evening light, yet thick coiled braids of\nblonde hair that glittered like polished brass. Shorts and a sleeveless\nblouse of some thick, reddish, metallic-looking fabric clung to her\nbody, and over that she was wearing a light, ankle-length cloak of what\nseemed to be white wool.\n\nShe was looking at him with palpable curiosity and something like\nexpectancy. Maitland sighed and said, \"Hello,\" then glanced down\nself-consciously at his wrinkled green pajamas.\n\nShe smiled, put the tray of food on the table, and swept out, her cloak\nbillowing behind her. Maitland remained standing, staring at the closed\ndoor for a minute after she was gone.\n\nLater, when he had finished the steak and corn on the cob and shredded\ncarrots, and a feeling of warm well-being was diffusing from his\nstomach to his extremities, he sat down on the bed to watch the sunset\nand to think.\n\nThere were three questions for which he required answers before he\ncould formulate any plan or policy.\n\nWhere was he?\n\nWho was Swarts?\n\nWhat was the purpose of the \"tests\" he was being given?\n\nIt was possible, of course, that this was all an elaborate scheme\nfor getting military secrets, despite Swarts' protestations to the\ncontrary. Maitland frowned. This place certainly didn't have the\nappearance of a military establishment, and so far there had been\nnothing to suggest the kind of interrogation to be expected from\nforeign intelligence officers.\n\nIt might be better to tackle the first question first. He looked at\nthe Sun, a red spheroid already half below the horizon, and tried to\nthink of a region that had this kind of terrain. That prairie out there\nwas unique. Almost anywhere in the world, land like that would be\ncultivated, not allowed to go to grass.\n\nThis might be somewhere in Africa....\n\nHe shook his head, puzzled. The Sun disappeared and its blood-hued\nglow began to fade from the sky. Maitland sat there, trying to get\nhold of the problem from an angle where it wouldn't just slip away.\nAfter a while the western sky became a screen of clear luminous blue,\na backdrop for a pure white brilliant star. As always at that sight,\nMaitland felt his worry drain away, leaving an almost mystical sense of\npeace and an undefinable longing.\n\nVenus, the most beautiful of the planets.\n\nMaitland kept track of them all in their majestic paths through the\nconstellations, but Venus was his favorite. Time and time again he\nhad watched its steady climb higher and higher in the western sky,\nits transient rule there as evening star, its progression toward the\nhorizon, and loved it equally in its _alter ego_ of morning star. Venus\nwas an old friend. An old friend....\n\nSomething icy settled on the back of his neck, ran down his spine, and\ndiffused into his body. He stared at the planet unbelievingly, fists\nclenched, forgetting to breathe.\n\nLast night Venus hadn't been there.\n\nVenus was a morning star just now....\n\n_Just now!_\n\nHe realized the truth in that moment.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLater, when that jewel of a planet had set and the stars were out,\nhe lay on the bed, still warm with excitement and relief. He didn't\nhave to worry any more about military secrets, or who Swarts was.\nThose questions were irrelevant now. And now he could accept the\npsychological tests at their face value; most likely, they were what\nthey purported to be.\n\nOnly one question of importance remained:\n\nWhat year was this?\n\nHe grimaced in the darkness, an involuntary muscular expression of\njubilation and excitement. The _future_! Here was the opportunity for\nthe greatest adventure imaginable to 20th Century man.\n\nSomewhere, out there under the stars, there must be grand glittering\ncities and busy spaceports, roaring gateways to the planets.\nSomewhere, out there in the night, there must be men who had walked\nbeside the Martian canals and pierced the shining cloud mantle of\nVenus--somewhere, perhaps, men who had visited the distant luring stars\nand returned. Surely, a civilization that had developed time travel\ncould reach the stars!\n\nAnd _he_ had a chance to become a part of all that! He could spend\nhis life among the planets, a citizen of deep space, a voyager of the\nchallenging spaceways between the solar worlds.\n\n\"I'm adaptable,\" he told himself gleefully. \"I can learn fast. There'll\nbe a job for me out there....\"\n\n_If--_\n\nSuddenly sobered, he rolled over and put his feet on the floor, sat\nin the darkness thinking. Tomorrow. Tomorrow he would have to find a\nway of breaking down Swarts' reticence. He would have to make the man\nrealize that secrecy wasn't necessary in this case. And if Swarts still\nwouldn't talk, he would have to find a way of forcing the issue. The\nfellow had said that he didn't need cooperation to get his results,\nbut--\n\nAfter a while Maitland smiled to himself and went back to bed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe woke in the morning with someone gently shaking his shoulder. He\nrolled over and looked up at the girl who had brought him his meal the\nevening before. There was a tray on the table and he sniffed the smell\nof bacon. The girl smiled at him. She was dressed as before, except\nthat she had discarded the white cloak.\n\nAs he swung his legs to the floor, she started toward the door,\ncarrying the tray with the dirty dishes from yesterday. He stopped her\nwith the word, \"Miss!\"\n\nShe turned, and he thought there was something eager in her face.\n\n\"Miss, do you speak my language?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" hesitantly. She lingered too long on the hiss of the last\nconsonant.\n\n\"Miss,\" he asked, watching her face intently, \"what year is this?\"\n\nStartlingly, she laughed, a mellow peal of mirth that had nothing\nforced about it. She turned toward the door again and said over her\nshoulder, \"You will have to ask Swarts about that. I cannot tell you.\"\n\n\"Wait! You mean you don't know?\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"I cannot tell you.\"\n\n\"All right; we'll let it go at that.\"\n\nShe grinned at him again as the door slid shut.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSwarts came half an hour later, and Maitland began his planned\noffensive.\n\n\"What year is this?\"\n\nSwarts' steely eyes locked with his. \"You know what the date is,\" he\nstated.\n\n\"No, I don't. Not since yesterday.\"\n\n\"Come on,\" Swarts said patiently, \"let's get going. We have a lot to\nget through this morning.\"\n\n\"I _know_ this isn't 1950. It's probably not even the 20th Century.\nVenus was a morning star before you brought me here. Now it's an\nevening star.\"\n\n\"Never mind that. Come.\"\n\nWordlessly, Maitland climbed to his feet, preceded Swarts to the\nlaboratory, lay down and allowed him to fasten the straps and attach\nthe instruments, making no resistance at all. When Swarts started\nsaying a list of words--doubtlessly some sort of semantic reaction\ntest--Maitland began the job of integrating \"csc^3x dx\" in his head.\nIt was a calculation which required great concentration and frequent\ntracing back of steps. After several minutes, he noticed that Swarts\nhad stopped calling words. He opened his eyes to find the other man\nstanding over him, looking somewhat exasperated and a little baffled.\n\n\"What year is this?\" Maitland asked in a conversational tone.\n\n\"We'll try another series of tests.\"\n\nIt took Swarts nearly twenty minutes to set up the new apparatus. He\nlowered a bulky affair with two cylindrical tubes like the twin stacks\nof a binocular microscope over Maitland's head, so that the lenses at\nthe ends of the tubes were about half an inch from the engineer's\neyes. He attached tiny clamps to Maitland's eyelashes.\n\n\"These will keep you from holding your eyes shut,\" he said. \"You can\nblink, but the springs are too strong for you to hold your eyelids down\nagainst the tension.\"\n\nHe inserted button earphones into Maitland's ears--\n\nAnd then the show began.\n\nHe was looking at a door in a partly darkened room, and there were\nfootsteps outside, a peremptory knocking. The door flew open,\nand outlined against the light of the hall, he saw a man with a\ntwelve-gauge shotgun. The man shouted, \"Now I've got you, you\nwife-stealer!\" He swung the shotgun around and pulled the trigger.\nThere was a terrible blast of sound and the flash of smokeless\npowder--then blackness.\n\nWith a deliberate effort, Maitland unclenched his fists and tried to\nslow his breathing. Some kind of emotional reaction test--what was the\ncountermove? He closed his eyes, but shortly the muscles around them\ndeclared excruciatingly that they couldn't keep that up.\n\nNow he was looking at a girl. She....\n\nMaitland gritted his teeth and fought to use his brain; then he had it.\n\nHe thought of a fat slob of a bully who had beaten him up one day\nafter school. He remembered a talk he had heard by a politician who had\nall the intelligent social responsibility of a rogue gorilla, but no\nmore. He brooded over the damnable stupidity and short-sightedness of\nSwarts in standing by his silly rules and not telling him about this\nnew world.\n\nWithin a minute, he was in an ungovernable rage. His muscles tightened\nagainst the restraining straps. He panted, sweat came out on his\nforehead, and he began to curse. Swarts! How he hated....\n\nThe scene was suddenly a flock of sheep spread over a green hillside.\nThere was blood hammering in Maitland's temples. His face felt hot and\nswollen and he writhed against the restraint of the straps.\n\nThe scene disappeared, the lenses of the projector retreated from his\neyes and Swarts was standing over him, white-lipped. Maitland swore at\nhim for a few seconds, then relaxed and smiled weakly. His head was\nstarting to ache from the effort of blinking.\n\n\"What year is this?\" he asked.\n\n\"All right,\" Swarts said. \"A.D. 2634.\"\n\nMaitland's smile became a grin.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I really haven't the time to waste talking irrelevancies,\" Swarts said\na while later. \"Honestly. Maitland, I'm working against a time limit.\nIf you'll cooperate, I'll tell Ching to answer your questions.\"'\n\n\"Ching?\"\n\n\"Ingrid Ching is the girl who has been bringing you your meals.\"\n\nMaitland considered a moment, then nodded. Swarts lowered the projector\nto his eyes again, and this time the engineer did not resist.\n\nThat evening, he could hardly wait for her to come. Too excited to sit\nand watch the sunset, he paced interminably about the room, sometimes\nwhistling nervously, snapping his fingers, sitting down and jittering\none leg. After a while he noticed that he was whistling the same theme\nover and over: a minute's thought identified it as that exuberant\nmounting phrase which recurs in the finale of Beethoven's Ninth\nSymphony.\n\nHe forgot about it and went on whistling. He was picturing himself\naboard a ship dropping in toward Mars, making planetfall at Syrtis\nMajor; he was seeing visions of Venus and the awesome beauty of Saturn.\nIn his mind, he circled the Moon, and viewed the Earth as a huge bright\nglobe against the constellations....\n\nFinally the door slid aside and she appeared, carrying the usual tray\nof food. She smiled at him, making dimples in her golden skin and\nrevealing a perfect set of teeth, and put the tray on the table.\n\n\"I think you are wonderful,\" she laughed. \"You get everything you\nwant, even from Swarts, and I have not been able to get even a little\nof what I want from him. I want to travel in time, go back to your 20th\nCentury. And I wanted to talk with you, and he would not let me.\" She\nlaughed again, hands on her rounded hips. \"I have never seen him so\nirritated as he was this noon.\"\n\nMaitland urged her into the chair and sat down on the edge of the bed.\nEagerly he asked, \"Why the devil do you want to go to the 20th Century?\nBelieve me, I've been there, and what I've seen of this world looks a\nlot better.\"\n\nShe shrugged. \"Swarts says that I want to go back to the Dark Age of\nTechnology because I have not adapted well to modern culture. Myself,\nI think I have just a romantic nature. Far times and places look more\nexciting....\"\n\n\"How do you mean--\" Maitland wrinkled his brow--\"adapt to modern\nculture? Don't tell me _you're_ from another time!\"\n\n\"Oh, no! But my home is Aresund, a little fishing village at the head\nof a fiord in what you would call Norway. So far north, we are much\nbehind the times. We live in the old way, from the sea, speak the old\ntongue.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe looked at her golden features, such a felicitous blend of\nOriental and European characteristics, and hesitantly asked, \"Maybe\nI shouldn't.... This is a little personal, but ... you don't look\naltogether like the Norwegians of my time.\"\n\nHis fear that she would be offended proved to be completely\nunjustified. She merely laughed and said, \"There has been much\nhistory since 1950. Five hundred years ago, Europe was overrun by\nPan-Orientals. Today you could not find anywhere a 'pure' European\nor Asiatic.\" She giggled. \"Swarts' ancestors from your time must be\ncursing in their graves. His family is Afrikander all the way back, but\none of his great-grandfathers was pure-blooded Bantu. His full name is\nLassisi Swarts.\"\n\nMaitland wrinkled his brow. \"Afrikander?\"\n\n\"The South Africans.\" Something strange came into her eyes. It might\nhave been awe, or even hatred; he could not tell. \"The Pan-Orientals\neventually conquered all the world, except for North America--the\nlast remnant of the American World Empire--and southern Africa. The\nAfrikanders had been partly isolated for several centuries then, and\nthey had developed technology while the rest of the world lost it. They\nhad a tradition of white supremacy, and in addition they were terrified\nof being encircled.\" She sighed. \"They ruled the next world empire and\nit was founded on the slaughter of one and a half billion human beings.\nThat went into the history books as the War of Annihilation.\"\n\n\"So many? How?\"\n\n\"They were clever with machines, the Afrikanders. They made armies\nof them. Armies of invincible killing-machines, produced in robot\nfactories from robot-mined ores.... Very clever.\" She gave a little\nshudder.\n\n\"And yet they founded modern civilization,\" she added. \"The grandsons\nof the technicians who built the Machine Army set up our robot\nproduction system, and today no human being has to dirty his hands\nraising food or manufacturing things. It could never have been done,\neither, before the population was--reduced to three hundred million.\"\n\n\"Then the Afrikanders are still on top? Still the masters?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe shook her head. \"There are no more Afrikanders.\"\n\n\"Rebellion?\"\n\n\"No. Intermarriage. Racial blending. There was a psychology of guilt\nbehind it. So huge a crime eventually required a proportionate\nexpiation. Afrikaans is still the world language, but there is only one\nrace now. No more masters or slaves.\"\n\nThey were both silent for a moment, and then she sighed. \"Let us not\ntalk about them any more.\"\n\n\"Robot factories and farms,\" Maitland mused. \"What else? What means of\ntransportation? Do you have interstellar flight yet?\"\n\n\"Inter-what?\"\n\n\"Have men visited the stars?\"\n\nShe shook her head, bewildered.\n\n\"I always thought that would be a tough problem to crack,\" he agreed.\n\"But tell me about what men are doing in the Solar System. How is life\non Mars and Venus, and how long does it take to get to those places?\"\n\nHe waited, expectantly silent, but she only looked puzzled. \"I don't\nunderstand. Mars? What are Mars?\"\n\nAfter several seconds, Maitland swallowed. Something seemed to be the\nmatter with his throat, making it difficult for him to speak. \"Surely\nyou have space travel?\"\n\nShe frowned and shook her head. \"What does that mean--space travel?\"\n\nHe was gripping the edge of the bed now, glaring at her. \"A\ncivilization that could discover time travel and build robot factories\nwouldn't find it hard to send a ship to Mars!\"\n\n\"A _ship_? Oh, you mean something like a _vliegvlotter_. Why, no, I\ndon't suppose it would be hard. But why would anyone want to do a\nthing like that?\"\n\nHe was on his feet towering over her, fists clenched. She raised her\narms as if to shield her face if he should hit her. \"Let's get this\nperfectly clear,\" he said, more harshly than he realized. \"So far as\nyou know, no one has ever visited the planets, and no one wants to. Is\nthat right?\"\n\nShe nodded apprehensively. \"I have never heard of it being done.\"\n\nHe sank down on the bed and put his face in his hands. After a while he\nlooked up and said bitterly, \"You're looking at a man who would give\nhis life to get to Mars. I thought I would in my time. I was positive I\nwould when I knew I was in your time. And now I know I never will.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe cot creaked beside him and he felt a soft arm about his shoulders\nand fingers delicately stroking his brow. Presently he opened his eyes\nand looked at her. \"I just don't understand,\" he said. \"It seemed\nobvious to me that whenever men were able to reach the planets, they'd\ndo it.\"\n\nHer pitying eyes were on his face. He hitched himself around so that he\nwas facing her. \"I've got to understand. I've got to know _why_. What\nhappened? Why don't men want the planets any more?\"\n\n\"Honestly,\" she said, \"I did not know they ever had.\" She hesitated.\n\"Maybe you are asking the wrong question.\"\n\nHe furrowed his brow, bewildered now by her.\n\n\"I mean,\" she explained, \"maybe you should ask why people in the 20th\nCentury _did_ want to go to worlds men are not suited to inhabit.\"\n\nMaitland felt his face become hot. \"Men can go anywhere, if they want\nto bad enough.\"\n\n\"But _why_?\"\n\nDespite his sudden irrational anger toward her, Maitland tried to stick\nto logic. \"Living space, for one thing. The only permanent solution to\nthe population problem....\"\n\n\"We have no population problem. A hundred years ago, we realized that\nthe key to social stability is a limited population. Our economic\nsystem was built to take care of three hundred million people, and we\nhave held the number at that.\"\n\n\"Birth control,\" Maitland scoffed. \"How do you make it work--secret\npolice?\"\n\n\"No. Education. Each of us has the right to two children, and we\ncherish that right so much that we make every effort to see that those\ntwo are the best children we could possibly produce....\"\n\nShe broke off, looking a little self-conscious. \"You understand, what\nI have been saying applies to _most_ of the world. In some places like\nAresund, things are different. Backward. I still do not feel that I\nbelong here, although the people of the town have accepted me as one of\nthem.\"\n\n\"Even,\" he said, \"granting that you have solved the population problem,\nthere's still the adventure of the thing. Surely, somewhere, there must\nbe men who still feel that.... Ingrid, doesn't it fire something in\nyour blood, the idea of going to Mars--just to go there and see what's\nthere and walk under a new sky and a smaller Sun? Aren't you interested\nin finding out what the canals are? Or what's under the clouds of\nVenus? Wouldn't you like to see the rings of Saturn from, a distance\nof only two hundred thousand miles?\" His hands were trembling as he\nstopped.\n\nShe shrugged her shapely shoulders. \"Go into the past--yes! But go out\nthere? I still cannot see why.\"\n\n\"Has the spirit of adventure _evaporated_ from the human race, or\n_what_?\"\n\nShe smiled. \"In a room downstairs there is the head of a lion. Swarts\nkilled the beast when he was a young man. He used a spear. And time\ntraveling is the greatest adventure there is. At least, that is the\nway I feel. Listen, Bob.\" She laid a hand on his arm. \"You grew up in\nthe Age of Technology. Everybody was terribly excited about what could\nbe done with machines--machines to blow up a city all at once, or fly\naround the world, or take a man to Mars. We have had our fill of--what\nis the word?--gadgets. Our machines serve us, and so long as they\nfunction right, we are satisfied to forget about them.\n\n\"Because this is the Age of _Man_. We are terribly interested in what\ncan be done with people. Our scientists, like Swarts, are studying\nhuman rather than nuclear reactions. We are much more fascinated by the\nlife and death of cultures than by the expansion or contraction of the\nUniverse. With us, it is the people that are important, not gadgets.\"\n\nMaitland stared at her, his face blank. His mind had just manufactured\na discouraging analogy. His present position was like that of an\nearnest 12th Century crusader, deposited by some freak of nature into\nthe year 1950, trying to find a way of reanimating the anti-Mohammedan\nmovement. What chance would he have? The unfortunate knight would argue\nin vain that the atomic bomb offered a means of finally destroying the\ninfidel....\n\nMaitland looked up at the girl, who was regarding him silently with\ntroubled eyes. \"I think I'd like to be alone for a while,\" he said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the morning, Maitland was tired, though not particularly depressed.\nHe hadn't slept much, but he had come to a decision. When Ingrid woke\nhim, he gave her a cavalier smile and a cheery \"Good morning\" and\nsat down to the eggs and ham she had brought. Then, before she could\nleave, he asked, \"Last night when we were talking about spaceships, you\nmentioned some kind of vessel or vehicle. What was it?\"\n\nShe thought. \"_Vliegvlotter?_ Was that it?\"\n\nHe nodded emphatically. \"Tell me about them.\"\n\n\"Well, they are--cars, you might say, with wheels that go into the\nbody when you take off. They can do, oh, 5,000 miles an hour in the\nionosphere, 50 miles up.\"\n\n\"Fifty miles,\" Maitland mused. \"Then they're sealed tight, so the air\ndoesn't leak out?\" Ingrid nodded. \"How do they work? Rocket drive?\"\n\n\"No.\" She plucked at her lower lip. \"I do not understand it very well.\nYou could picture something that hooks into a gravity field, and pulls.\nA long way from the Earth if would not work very well, because the\nfield is so thin there.... I guess I just cannot explain it very well\nto you.\"\n\n\"That's all I need.\" Maitland licked his lips and frowned. \"On that\npoint, anyway. Another thing--Swarts told me I'd be here for about a\nweek. Is there any set procedure involved in that? Have other persons\nbeen brought to this period from the past?\"\n\nShe laughed. \"Thousands. Swarts has published nearly a hundred case\nstudies himself, and spent time adding up to years in the 19th and 20th\ncenturies.\"\n\nMaitland interrupted incredulously. \"How on Earth could he ever manage\nto keep that many disappearances quiet? Some of those people would be\nbound to talk.\"\n\nShe shook her head definitely. \"The technique was designed to avoid\njust that. There is a method of 'fading' the memories people have of\ntheir stay here. The episode is always accepted as a period of amnesia,\nin the absence of a better explanation.\"\n\n\"Still, in thousands of cases....\"\n\n\"Spread out over centuries in a total population of billions.\"\n\nHe laughed. \"You're right. But will that be done to me?\"\n\n\"I suppose so. I can't imagine Swarts letting you take your memories\nback with you.\"\n\nMaitland looked out the window at the green horizon. \"We'll see,\" he\nsaid.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMaitland removed his three-day beard with an effective depilatory cream\nhe discovered in the bathroom, and settled down to wait. When Swarts\narrived, the engineer said quietly, \"Sit down, please. I have to talk\nwith you.\"\n\nSwarts gave him the look of a man with a piece of equipment that just\nwon't function right, and remained standing. \"What is it now?\"\n\n\"Look,\" Maitland said, \"Ingrid has told me that men never reached the\nplanets. _You_ ought to know how I feel about space flight. It's my\nwhole life. Knowing that my work on rockets is going to pay off only in\nthe delivery of bombs, I don't want to go back to the 20th Century. I\nwant to stay here.\"\n\nSwarts said slowly, \"That's impossible.\"\n\n\"Now, look, if you want me to cooperate....\"\n\nThe big man made an impatient gesture. \"Not impossible because of me.\nPhysically impossible. Impossible because of the way time travel works.\"\n\nMaitland stared at him suspiciously.\n\n\"To displace a mass from its proper time takes energy,\" Swarts\nexplained, \"and it's one of the oldest general physical principles that\nhigher energy states are unstable with respect to lower ones. Are\nyou familiar with elementary quantum theory? As an analogy, you might\nregard yourself, displaced from your proper time, as an atom in an\nexcited state. The system is bound to drop back to ground state. In the\natomic case, the time which elapses before that transition occurs is a\nmatter of probabilities. In the case of time travel, it just depends on\nthe amount of mass and the number of years the mass is displaced.\n\n\"In short, the laws of nature will insist on your returning to 1950 in\njust a few days.\"\n\nMaitland looked at the floor for a while, and his shoulders sagged.\n\"Your memories of this will be faded,\" Swarts said. \"You'll forget\nabout what Ingrid has told you--forget you were ever here, and take\nup your life where you left off. You were happy working on rockets,\nweren't you?\"\n\n\"But--\" Maitland shook his head despairingly. Then he had an idea.\n\"Will you let me do one thing, before I go back? I realize now that\nour time is limited, and you have a lot of tests to give me, but I'm\nwilling to help speed things up. I want to see the stars, just once,\nfrom deep space. I know you'll make me forget it ever happened, but\nonce in my life.... You have vessels--_vliegvlotter_, Ingrid called\nthem--that can go into space. If you'd give me just a couple days to go\nout there, maybe circle the Moon...?\" There was a pleading note in his\nvoice, but he didn't care.\n\nSwarts regarded him dispassionately for a moment, then nodded. \"Sure,\"\nhe said. \"Now let's get to work.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"The Earth doesn't change much,\" Maitland mused. Sitting on the cot,\nhis arm around Ingrid's yielding waist, he was wearing the new blue\ntrunks she had given him to replace his rumpled pajamas. The room\nwas full of evening sunlight, and in that illumination she was more\nbeautiful than any other woman he could remember. This had been the\nlast day of tests; tomorrow, Swarts had promised, he would begin his\nheart-breakingly brief argosy to the Moon, with Ingrid as pilot.\n\nOver the past four days, he had been with the girl a lot. In the\nbeginning, he realized, she had been drawn to him as a symbol of an era\nshe longed, but was unable, to visit. Now she understood him better,\nknew more about him--and Maitland felt that now she liked him for\nhimself.\n\nShe had told him of her childhood in backward Aresund and of loneliness\nhere at the school in Nebraska. \"Here,\" she had said, \"parents spend\nmost of their time raising their children; at home, they just let us\ngrow. Every time one of these people looks at me I feel inferior.\"\n\nShe had confided her dream of visiting far times and places, then had\nfinished, \"I doubt that Swarts will ever let me go back. He thinks\nI am too irresponsible. Probably he is right. But it is terribly\ndiscouraging. Sometimes I think the best thing for me would be to go\nhome to the fiord....\"\n\nNow, sitting in the sunset glow, Maitland was in a philosophic mood.\n\"The color of grass, the twilight, the seasons, the stars--those things\nhaven't changed.\" He gestured out the window at the slumbering evening\nprairie. \"That scene, save for unessentials, could just as well be\n1950--or 950. It's only human institutions that change rapidly....\"\n\n\"I'll be awfully sorry when you go back,\" she sighed. \"You're the first\nperson I've met here that I can talk to.\"\n\n\"Talk to,\" he repeated, dissatisfied. \"You're just about the finest\ngirl I've ever met.\"\n\nHe kissed her, playfully, but when they separated there was nothing\nplayful left about it. Her face was flushed and he was breathing faster\nthan he had been. Savagely, he bit the inside of his cheek. \"Two days!\nA lifetime here wouldn't be long enough!\"\n\n\"Bob.\" She touched his arm and her lips were trembling. \"Bob, do you\nhave to go--out there? We could get a couple of horses tomorrow, and\nwe would have two days.\"\n\nHe leaned back and shook his head. \"Can't you see, Ingrid? This is my\nonly chance. If I don't go tomorrow, I'll never get to the Moon. And\nthen my whole life won't mean anything....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe woke with Ingrid shaking him. \"Bob! Bob!\" Her voice was an urgent\nwhisper. \"You've got to wake up quick! Bob!\"\n\nHe sat up and brushed the hair out of his eyes. \"What's the matter?\"\n\n\"I didn't really believe that Swarts would let you go into space. It\nwasn't like him. Bob, he fooled you. _Today_ is when your time runs\nout!\"\n\nMaitland swallowed hard, and his chest muscles tightened convulsively.\n\"You mean it was all a trick?\"\n\nShe nodded. \"He told me just now, while he was putting something in\nyour milk to make you sleep.\" Her face was bitter and resentful. \"He\nsaid, 'This is a lesson for you, Ching, if you ever do any work with\nindividuals like this. You have to humor them, tell them anything they\nwant to believe, in order to get your data.'\"\n\nMaitland put his feet on the floor, stood up. His face was white and he\nwas breathing fast.\n\nShe grasped his arm. \"What are you going to do?\"\n\nHe shook her hand off. \"I may not get to the Moon, but I'm going to\nteach one superman the advantage of honesty!\"\n\n\"Wait! That won't get you anywhere.\"\n\n\"He may be bigger than I am,\" Maitland gritted, \"but--\"\n\nShe squeezed his arm violently. \"You don't understand. He would not\nfight you. He'd use a gun.\"\n\n\"If I could catch him by surprise....\"\n\nShe took hold of his shoulders firmly. \"Now, listen, Bob Maitland. I\nlove you. And I think it's the most important thing in the world that\nyou get to see the stars. Swarts will never let me time travel, anyway.\"\n\n\"What are you thinking?\"\n\n\"I'll go down to the village and get a _vliegvlotter_. It won't take\ntwenty minutes. I'll come back, see that Swarts is out of the way,\nlet you out of here, and take you--\" she hesitated, but her eyes were\nsteady--\"wherever you want to go.\"\n\nHe was trembling. \"Your career. I can't let you....\"\n\nShe made as if to spit, then grinned. \"My career! It's time I went home\nto the fiord, anyway. Now you wait here!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe _vliegvlotter_ was about 50 feet long, an ellipsoid of revolution.\nMaitland and Ingrid ran hand in hand across the lawn and she pushed\nhim up through the door, then slammed it shut and screwed the pressure\nlocks tight.\n\nThey were strapping themselves into the seats, bathed in sunlight that\nflooded down through the thick plastic canopy, when she stopped, pale\nwith consternation.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Oh, Bob, I forgot! We can't do this!\"\n\n\"We're going to,\" he said grimly.\n\n\"Bob, _sometime this morning you're going to snap back to 1950_. If\nthat happens while we're up there....\"\n\nHis jaw went slack as the implication soaked in. Then he reached over\nand finished fastening the buckle on her wide seat belt.\n\n\"Bob, I can't. I would be killing you just as surely as....\"\n\n\"Never mind that. You can tell me how to run this thing and then get\nout, if you want to.\"\n\nShe reached slowly forward and threw a switch, took hold of the wheel.\nSeconds later they were plummeting into the blue dome of the sky.\n\nThe blue became darker, purplish, and stars appeared in daylight.\nMaitland gripped the edge of the seat; somewhere inside him it seemed\nthat a chorus of angels was singing the finale of Beethoven's Ninth.\n\nThere was a _ping_ and Ingrid automatically flicked a switch. A screen\nlit up and the image of Swarts was looking at them. His eyes betrayed\nsome unfamiliar emotion, awe or fear. \"Ching! Come back here at once.\nDon't you realize that--\"\n\n\"Sorry, Swarts.\" Maitland's voice resonated with triumph. \"You'll just\nhave to humor me once more.\"\n\n\"Maitland! Don't you know that you're going to snap back to the 20th\nCentury in half an hour? You'll be in space with no protection. You'll\nexplode!\"\n\n\"I know,\" Maitland said. He looked up through the viewport. \"Right now,\nI'm seeing the stars as I've never seen them before. Sorry to make you\nlose a case, Swarts, but this is better than dying of pneumonia or an\natomic bomb.\"\n\nHe reached forward and snapped the image off.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTwenty minutes later, Maitland had Ingrid cut the drive and turn the\nship, so that he could see the Earth. It was there, a huge shining\nglobe against the constellations, 10,000 miles distant, 100 times the\nsize of familiar Luna. North America was directly below, part of Canada\ncovered with a dazzling area of clouds. The polar ice-cap was visible\nin its entirety, along with the northern portions of the Eurasian land\nmass. The line of darkness cut off part of Alaska and bisected the\nPacific Ocean, and the Sun's reflection in the Atlantic was blinding.\n\nAnd there was Venus, a brilliant, white jewel against the starry\nblackness of interstellar space, and now he could see the Sun's\ncorona....\n\nThe ship was rotating slowly, and presently the Moon, at first quarter,\ncame into view, not perceptibly larger than seen from Earth. Maitland\nheaved a sigh of regret. If only this could have been but the beginning\nof a voyage....\n\nIngrid touched his arm. \"Bob.\"\n\nHe turned to look at her golden beauty.\n\n\"Bob, give me one more kiss.\"\n\nHe loosened his seat strap and put his arms around her. For a moment he\nfelt her soft lips on his....\n\nThen she was gone, and the ship had vanished. For perhaps as long as\na second, alone in space, he was looking with naked, unprotected,\nambition-sated eyes at the distant stars.\n\nThe luring white blaze of Venus was the last image he took with him\ninto the night without stars.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Ambition, by William L.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\nwww.gutenberg.org\n\n\n\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
