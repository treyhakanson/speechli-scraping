Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\n     copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n\n\n     _It's easy to find a solution when there is one--the trick is to\n     do it if there is none!_\n\n\nI glanced at the path we had made across the _Mare Serenitatis_. The\nLatin translated as \"the Sea of Serenity.\" It was well named because,\nas far as the eye could see in every direction, there was a smooth\nlayer of pumice that resembled the surface of a calm sea. Scattered\nacross the quiet sea of virgin Moon dust were occasional islands\nof rock that jutted abruptly toward the infinity of stars above.\nConsidering everything, our surroundings conveyed a sense of serenity\nlike none I had ever felt.\n\nOur bounding path across the level expanse was clearly marked. Because\nof the light gravity, we had leaped high into the air with each step\nand every time we struck the ground, the impact had raised a cloud of\ndustlike pumice. Now the clouds of dust were slowly settling in the\nlight gravity.\n\nAbove us, the stars were cold, motionless and crystal-clear.\nIndifferently, they sprayed a faint light on our surroundings ... a\ndim glow that was hardly sufficient for normal vision and was too weak\nto be reflected toward Earth.\n\nWe turned our head-lamps on the strange object before us. Five beams\nof light illuminated the smooth shape that protruded from the Moon's\nsurface.\n\nThe incongruity was so awesome that for several minutes, we remained\nmotionless and quiet. Miller broke the silence with his quavering\nvoice, \"Strange someone didn't notice it before.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nStrange? The object rose a quarter of a mile above us, a huge, curving\nhulk of smooth metal. It was featureless and yet conveyed a sense\nof _alienness_. It was alien and yet it wasn't a natural formation.\nSomething had made the thing, whatever it was. But was it strange that\nit hadn't been noticed before? Men had lived on the Moon for over a\nyear, but the Moon was vast and the _Mare Serenitatis_ covered three\nhundred and forty thousand square miles.\n\n\"What is it?\" Marie asked breathlessly.\n\nHer husband grunted his bafflement. \"Who knows? But see how it curves?\nIf it's a perfect sphere, it must be at least two miles in diameter!\"\n\n\"If it's a perfect sphere,\" Miller suggested, \"most of it must be\nbeneath the Moon's surface.\"\n\n\"Maybe it isn't a sphere,\" my wife said. \"Maybe this is all of it.\"\n\n\"Let's call Lunar City and tell the authorities about it.\" I reached\nfor the radio controls on my suit.\n\nKane grabbed my arm. \"No. Let's find out whatever we can by ourselves.\nIf we tell the authorities, they'll order us to leave it alone. If we\ndiscover something really important, we'll be famous!\"\n\nI lowered my arm. His outburst seemed faintly childish to me. And yet\nit carried a good measure of common sense. If we discovered proof of\nan alien race, we would indeed be famous. The more we discovered for\nourselves, the more famous we'd be. Fame was practically a synonym for\nprestige and wealth.\n\n\"All right,\" I conceded.\n\nMiller stepped forward, moving slowly in the bulk of his spacesuit.\nDeliberately, he removed a small torch from his side and pressed the\nbrilliant flame against the metal.\n\nA few minutes later, the elderly mineralogist gave his opinion: \"It's\nsteel ... made thousands of years ago.\"\n\nSomeone gasped over the intercom, \"Thousands of years! But wouldn't it\nbe in worse shape than this if it was that old?\"\n\nMiller pointed at the small cut his torch had made in the metal. The\nnotch was only a quarter of an inch deep. \"I say _steel_ because it's\n_similar_ to steel. Actually, it's a much stronger alloy. Besides that,\non the Moon, there's been no water or atmosphere to rust it. Not even\na wind to disturb its surface. It's _at least_ several thousand years\nold.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe slowly circled the alien structure. Several minutes later, Kane\nshouted, \"Look!\"\n\nA few feet above the ground, the structure's smooth surface was broken\nby a circular opening that yawned invitingly. Kane ran ahead and\nflashed his head-lamp into the dark recess.\n\n\"There's a small room inside,\" he told us, and climbed through the\nopening.\n\nWe waited outside and focused our lamps through the five-foot opening\nto give him as much light as possible.\n\n\"Come on in, Marie,\" he called to his wife. \"This is really something!\nIt _must_ be an alien race. There's all kinds of weird drawings on the\nwalls and gadgets that look like controls for something....\"\n\nBriefly, my lamp flickered over Marie's pale face. Her features\nstruggled with two conflicting emotions: She was frightened by the\nalienness of the thing and yet she wanted to be with her husband. She\nhesitated momentarily, then climbed through the passage.\n\n\"You want to go in?\" my wife asked.\n\n\"Do you?\"\n\n\"Let's.\"\n\nI helped Verana through the opening, climbed through myself and turned\nto help Miller.\n\nMiller was sixty years old. He was an excellent mineralogist, alert\nmentally, but with a body that was almost feeble. I reached out to help\nhim as he stepped into the passageway.\n\nFor a brief second, he was framed in the opening, a dark silhouette\nagainst the star-studded sky.\n\nThe next second, he was thrown twenty yards into the air. He gasped\nwith pain when he struck the ground. \"_Something_ pushed me!\"\n\n\"Are you all right?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nHe had fallen on a spot beyond our angle of vision. I started through\nthe passage....\n\n... and struck an invisible solid wall.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMy eyes were on the circular opening. A metal panel emerged from a\nrecess on one side and slid across the passage. The room darkened with\nthe absence of starlight.\n\n\"_What happened?_\"\n\n\"The door to this damned place closed,\" I explained.\n\n\"_What?_\"\n\nBefore we could recover from the shock, the room filled with a\nbrilliant glare. We turned off our lamps.\n\nThe room was approximately twelve feet long and nine feet wide. The\nceiling was only a few inches above our heads and when I looked at the\nsmooth, hard metal, I felt as if I were trapped in some alien vault.\n\nThe walls of the room were covered with strange drawings and\ninstruments. Here and there, kaleidoscopic lights pulsed rhythmically.\n\nKane brushed past me and beat his gloved fists against the metal door\nthat had imprisoned us.\n\n\"Miller!\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"See if you can get this thing open from the outside.\"\n\nI knelt before the door and explored its surface with my fingers. There\nwere no visible recesses or controls.\n\nOver the intercom network, everyone's breath mingled and formed a\nrough, harsh sound. I could discern the women's quick, frightened\nbreaths that were almost sobs. Kane's breath was deep and strong;\nMiller's was faltering and weak.\n\n\"Miller, get help!\"\n\n\"I'll--\" The sound of his breathing ceased. We listened intently.\n\n\"What happened to him?\"\n\n\"I'll phone Lunar City.\" My fingers fumbled at the radio controls and\ntrembled beneath the thick gloves.\n\nI turned the dials that would connect my radio with Lunar City....\n\nStatic grated against my ear drums.\n\n_Static!_\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI listened to the harsh, erratic sound and my voice was weak by\ncomparison: \"Calling Lunar City.\"\n\n\"Static!\" Kane echoed my thoughts. His frown made deep clefts between\nhis eyebrows. \"There's no static between inter-lunar radio!\"\n\nVerana's voice was small and frightened. \"That sounds like the static\nwe hear over the bigger radios when we broadcast to Earth.\"\n\n\"It does,\" Marie agreed.\n\n\"But we wouldn't have that kind of static over _our_ radio, unless--\"\nVerana's eyes widened until the pupils were surrounded by circles of\nwhite--\"unless we were in outer space!\"\n\nWe stared at the metal door that had imprisoned us, afraid even to\nspeak of our fantastic suspicion.\n\nI deactivated my radio.\n\nMarie screamed as an inner door opened to disclose a long, narrow\ncorridor beyond.\n\nSimultaneous with the opening of the second door, I felt air press\nagainst my spacesuit. Before, our suits had been puffed outward by the\npressure of air inside. Now our spacesuits were slack and dangling on\nour bodies.\n\nWe looked at each other and then at the inviting corridor beyond the\nopen door.\n\nWe went single file, first Kane, then his wife Marie. Verana followed\nnext and I was the last.\n\nWe walked slowly, examining the strange construction. The walls were\nfeatureless but still seemed alien. At various places on the walls were\nthe outlines of doors without handles or locks.\n\nKane pressed his shoulder against a door and shoved. The door was\nunyielding.\n\nI manipulated the air-vent controls of my spacesuit, allowed a small\namount of the corridor's air into my helmet and inhaled cautiously.\nIt smelled all right. I waited and nothing happened. Gradually, I\nincreased the intake, turned off the oxygenating machines and removed\nmy helmet.\n\n\"Shut off your oxy,\" I suggested. \"We might as well breathe the air in\nthis place and save our supply. We may need the oxygen in our suits\nlater.\"\n\nThey saw that I had removed my helmet and was still alive and one by\none removed their own helmets.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt the end of the corridor, Kane stopped before a blank wall. The sweat\non his face glistened dully; his chest rose and fell rapidly. Kane was\na pilot and one of the prerequisites for the job of guiding tons of\nmetal between Earth and the Moon was a good set of nerves. Kane excited\neasily, his temper was fiery, but his nerves were like steel.\n\n\"The end of the line,\" he grunted.\n\nAs though to disprove the statement, a door on his right side opened\nsoundlessly.\n\nHe went through the doorway as if shoved violently by an invisible hand.\n\nThe door closed behind him.\n\nMarie threw herself at the door and beat at the metal. \"Harry!\"\n\nVerana rushed to her side. Another door on the opposite side of the\ncorridor opened silently. The door was behind them; they didn't notice.\n\nBefore I could warn them, Marie floated across the corridor, through\nthe doorway.\n\nVerana and I stared at the darkness beyond the opening, our muscles\nfrozen by shock.\n\nThe door closed behind Marie's screaming, struggling form.\n\nVerana's face was white with fear. Apprehensively, she glanced at the\nother doors that lined the hall.\n\nI put my arms around her, held her close.\n\n\"Antigravity machines, force rays,\" I suggested worriedly.\n\nFor several minutes, we remained motionless and silent. I recalled the\npreceding events of the day, searched for a sense of normality in them.\nThe Kanes, Miller, Verana and I lived in Lunar City with hundreds of\nother people. Mankind had inhabited the Moon for over a year. Means\nof recreation were scarce. Many people explored the place to amuse\nthemselves. After supper, we had decided to take a walk. As simple as\nthat: a walk on the Moon.\n\nWe had expected only the familiar craters, chasms and weird rock\nformations. A twist of fate and here we were: imprisoned in an alien\nship.\n\nMy legs quivered with fatigue, my heart throbbed heavily, Verana's\nperfume dizzied me. No, it wasn't a dream. Despite our incredible\nsituation, there was no sensation of unreality.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI took Verana's hand and led her down the long corridor, retracing our\nsteps.\n\nWe had walked not more than two yards when the rest of the doors\nopened soundlessly.\n\nVerana's hand flew to her mouth to stifle a gasp.\n\nSix doors were now open. The only two that remained closed were the\nones that the Kanes had unwillingly entered.\n\nThis time, no invisible hand thrust us into any of the rooms.\n\nI entered the nearest one. Verana followed hesitantly.\n\nThe walls of the large room were lined with shelves containing\nthousands of variously colored boxes and bottles. A table and four\nchairs were located in the center of the green, plasticlike floor. Each\nchair had no back, only a curving platform with a single supporting\ncolumn.\n\n\"Ed!\" I joined Verana on the other side of the room. She pointed a\ntrembling finger at some crude drawings. \"The things in this room are\nfood!\"\n\nThe drawings were so simple that anyone could have understood them.\nThe first drawing portrayed a naked man and woman removing boxes and\nbottles from the shelves. The second picture showed the couple opening\nthe containers. The third showed the man eating from one of the boxes\nand the woman drinking from a bottle.\n\n\"Let's see how it tastes,\" I said.\n\nI selected an orange-colored box. The lid dissolved at the touch of my\nfingers.\n\nThe only contents were small cubes of a soft orange substance.\n\nI tasted a small piece.\n\n\"Chocolate! Just like chocolate!\"\n\nVerana chose a nearby bottle and drank some of the bluish liquid.\n\n\"Milk!\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"Perhaps we'd better look at the other rooms,\" I told her.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe next room we examined was obviously for recreation. Containers were\nfilled with dozens of strange games and books of instructions in the\nform of simple drawings. The games were foreign, but designed in such a\nfashion that they would be interesting to Earthmen.\n\nTwo of the rooms were sleeping quarters. The floors were covered with a\nspongy substance and the lights were dim and soothing.\n\nAnother room contained a small bathing pool, running water,\nwaste-disposal units and yellow cakes of soap.\n\nThe last room was an observatory. The ceiling and an entire wall were\ntransparent. Outside, the stars shone clearly for a few seconds, then\ndisappeared for an equal time, only to reappear in a different position.\n\n\"Hyper-space drive,\" Verana whispered softly. She was fascinated by\nthe movement of the stars. For years, our scientists had sought a\nhyperspatial drive to conquer the stars.\n\nWe selected a comfortable chair facing the transparent wall, lit\ncigarettes and waited.\n\nA few minutes later, Marie entered the room.\n\nI noticed with some surprise that her face was calm. If she was\nexcited, her actions didn't betray it.\n\nShe sat next to Verana.\n\n\"What happened?\" my wife asked.\n\nMarie crossed her legs and began in a rambling manner as if discussing\na new recipe, \"That was really a surprise, wasn't it? I was scared\nsilly, at first. That room was dark and I didn't know what to expect.\nSomething touched my head and I heard a telepathic voice--\"\n\n\"Telepathic?\" Verana interrupted.\n\n\"Yes. Well, this voice said not to worry and that it wasn't going to\nhurt me. It said it only wanted to learn something about us. It was\nthe _oddest_ feeling! All the time, this voice kept talking to me in\na nice way and made me feel at ease ... and at the same time, I felt\n_something_ search my mind and gather information. I could actually\n_feel_ it search my memories!\"\n\n\"What memories?\" I inquired.\n\nShe frowned with concentration. \"Memories of high school mostly. It\nseemed interested in English and history classes. And then it searched\nfor memories of our customs and lives in general....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKane stalked into the room at that moment, his face red with anger.\n\"_Do you know where we are?_\" he demanded. \"When those damned aliens\ngot me in that room, they explained what this is all about. We're\nguinea pigs!\"\n\n\"Did they use telepathy to explain?\" Verana asked. I suddenly\nremembered that she was a member of a club that investigated\nextra-sensory perception with the hope of learning how it operated. She\nwas probably sorry she hadn't been contacted telepathically.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Kane replied. \"I saw all sorts of mental pictures and they\nexplained what they did to us. Those damned aliens want us for their\nzoo!\"\n\n\"Start at the beginning,\" I suggested.\n\nHe flashed an angry glance at me, but seemed to calm somewhat. \"This\nship was made by a race from another galaxy. Thousands of years ago,\nthey came to Earth in their spaceships when men were primitives living\nin caves. They wanted to know what our civilization would be like\nwhen we developed space flight. So they put this ship on the Moon as a\nsort of booby-trap. They put it there with the idea that when we made\nspaceships and went to the Moon, sooner or later, we'd find the ship\nand enter it--_like rabbits in a snare!_\"\n\n\"And now the booby-trap is on its way home,\" I guessed.\n\n\"Yeah, this ship is taking us to their planet and they're going to keep\nus there while they study us.\"\n\n\"How long will the trip take?\" I asked.\n\n\"Six months. We'll be bottled up in this crate for six whole damned\nmonths! And when we get there, we'll be prisoners!\"\n\nMarie's hypnotic spell was fading and once more her face showed the\nterror inside her.\n\n\"Don't feel so bad,\" I told Kane. \"It could be worse. It should be\ninteresting to see an alien race. We'll have our wives with us--\"\n\n\"Maybe they'll dissect us!\" Marie gasped.\n\nVerana scoffed. \"A race intelligent enough to build a ship like this? A\nrace that was traveling between the stars when we were living in caves?\nDissection is primitive. They won't _have to_ dissect us in order to\nstudy us. They'll have more advanced methods.\"\n\n\"Maybe we can reach the ship's controls somehow,\" Kane said excitedly.\n\"We've got to try to change the ship's course and get back to the\nMoon!\"\n\n\"It's impossible. Don't waste your time.\" The voice had no visible\nsource and seemed to fill the room.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nVerana snapped her fingers. \"So that's why the aliens read Marie's\nmind! They wanted to learn our language so they could talk to us!\"\n\nKane whirled in a complete circle, glaring at each of the four walls.\n\"Where are you? _Who_ are you?\"\n\n\"I'm located in a part of the ship you can't reach. I'm a machine.\"\n\n\"Is anyone else aboard besides ourselves?\"\n\n\"No. I control the ship.\" Although the voice spoke without stilted\nphrases, the tone was cold and mechanical.\n\n\"What are your--your masters going to do with us?\" Marie asked\nanxiously.\n\n\"You won't be harmed. My masters merely wish to question and examine\nyou. Thousands of years ago, they wondered what your race would be like\nwhen it developed to the space-flight stage. They left this ship on\nyour Moon only because they were curious. My masters have no animosity\ntoward your race, only compassion and curiosity.\"\n\nI remembered the way antigravity rays had shoved Miller from the ship\nand asked the machine, \"Why didn't you let our fifth member board the\nship?\"\n\n\"The trip to my makers' planet will take six months. There are food,\noxygen and living facilities for four only of your race. I had to\nprevent the fifth from entering the ship.\"\n\n\"Come on,\" Kane ordered. \"We'll search this ship room by room and we'll\nfind some way to make it take us back to Earth.\"\n\n\"It's useless,\" the ship warned us.\n\nFor five hours, we minutely examined every room. We had no tools to\nforce our way through solid metal walls to the engine or control rooms.\nThe only things in the ship that could be lifted and carried about were\nthe containers of food and alien games. None were sufficiently heavy or\nhard enough to put even a scratch in the heavy metal.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSix rooms were open to our use. The two rooms in which the Kanes had\nbeen imprisoned were locked and there were no controls or locks to work\non.\n\nThe rooms that we could enter were without doors, except the ones that\nopened into the corridor.\n\nAfter intensive searching, we realized there was _no way_ to damage the\nship or reach any section other than our allotted space.\n\nWe gave up.\n\nThe women went to the sleeping compartments to rest and Kane I went to\nthe \"kitchen.\"\n\nAt random, we sampled the variously colored boxes and bottles and\ndiscussed our predicament.\n\n\"Trapped,\" Kane said angrily. \"Trapped in a steel prison.\" He slammed\nhis fist against the table top. \"But there must be a way to get out!\nEvery problem has a solution!\"\n\n\"You sure?\" I asked.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"_Does_ every problem have a solution? I don't believe it. Some\nproblems are too great. Take the problem of a murderer in our\ncivilization: John Doe has killed someone and his problem is to escape.\nPrimarily, a murderer's problem is the same principle as ours. A\nmurderer has to outwit an entire civilization. We have to outwit an\nentire civilization that was hundreds of times more advanced than ours\nis now when we were clubbing animals and eating the meat raw. Damned\nfew criminals get away these days, even though they've got such crowds\nto lose themselves in. All we have is a ship that we can't control. I\ndon't think we have a chance.\"\n\nMy resignation annoyed him. Each of us had reacted differently: Kane's\nwife was frightened, Verana was calm because of an inner serenity that\nfew people have, I was resigned and Kane was angry.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor several minutes, we sampled the different foods. Every one had a\ndistinctive flavor, comparable to that of a fruit or vegetable on Earth.\n\nKane lifted a brown bottle to his lips, took a huge gulp and almost\nchoked.\n\n\"Whiskey!\"\n\n\"My masters realized your race would develop intoxicants and tried to\ncreate a comparable one,\" the machine explained.\n\nI selected a brown bottle and sampled the liquid. \"A little stronger\nthan our own,\" I informed the machine.\n\nWe drank until Kane was staggering about the room, shouting insults at\nthe alien race and the mechanical voice that seemed to be everywhere.\nHe beat his fist against a wall until blood trickled from bruised\nknuckles.\n\n\"Please don't hurt yourself,\" the machine pleaded.\n\n\"_Why?_\" Kane screamed at the ceiling. \"Why should you care?\"\n\n\"My masters will be displeased with me if you arrive in a damaged\ncondition.\"\n\nKane banged his head against a bulkhead; an ugly bruise formed rapidly.\n\"Shtop me, then!\"\n\n\"I can't. My masters created no way for me to restrain or contact you\nother than use of your language.\"\n\nIt took fully fifteen minutes to drag Kane to his sleeping compartment.\n\nAfter I left Kane in his wife's care, I went to the adjoining room and\nstretched out on the soft floor beside Verana.\n\nI tried to think of some solution. We were locked in an alien ship at\nthe start of a six months' journey to a strange planet. We had no tools\nor weapons.\n\nSolution? I doubted if two dozen geniuses working steadily for years\ncould think of one!\n\nI wondered what the alien race was like. Intelligent, surely: They had\nforeseen our conquest of space flight when we hadn't even invented\nthe wheel. That thought awed me--somehow they had analyzed our brains\nthousands of years ago and calculated what our future accomplishments\nwould be.\n\nThey had been able to predict our scientific development, but they\nhadn't been able to tell how our civilization would develop. They were\ncurious, so they had left an enormously elaborate piece of bait on the\nMoon.\n\nThe aliens were incredibly more advanced than ourselves. I couldn't\nhelp thinking, _And to a rabbit in a snare, mankind must seem\nimpossibly clever_.\n\nI decided to ask the machine about its makers in the \"morning.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen I awoke, my head was throbbing painfully.\n\nI opened my eyes and blinked several times to make sure they were\nfunctioning properly. I wasn't in the compartment where I had fallen\nasleep a few hours before.\n\nI was tied to one of the chairs in the \"kitchen.\" Beside me, Verana was\nbound to a chair by strips of cloth from her skirt, and across from us,\nMarie was secured to another chair.\n\nKane staggered into the room. Although he was visibly drunk, he\nappeared more sober than the night before. His dark hair was rumpled\nand his face was flushed, but his eyes gleamed with a growing alertness.\n\n\"Awake, huh?\"\n\n\"What have you done, Harry?\" his wife screamed at him. Her eyes were\nred with tears and her lips twisted in an expression of shame when she\nlooked at him.\n\n\"Obvious, isn't it? While all of you were asleep, I conked each of you\non the head, dragged you in here and tied you up.\" He smiled crookedly.\n\"It's amazing the things a person can do when he's pickled. I'm sorry I\nhad to be so rough, but I have a plan and I knew you wouldn't agree or\ncooperate with me.\"\n\n\"What's your plan?\" I asked.\n\nHe grinned wryly and crinkled bloodshot eyes. \"I don't want to live in\na zoo on an alien planet. I want to go home and prove my theory that\nthis problem has a solution.\"\n\nI grunted my disgust.\n\n\"The solution is simple,\" he said. \"We're in a trap so strong that the\naliens didn't establish any means to control our actions. When men put\na lion in a strong cage, they don't worry about controlling the lion\nbecause the lion can't get out. We're in the same basic situation.\"\n\n\"So what?\" Verana queried in a sarcastic tone.\n\n\"The aliens want us transported to their planet so they can examine and\nquestion us. Right?\"\n\n\"Right.\"\n\n\"Ed, remember that remark the machine made last night?\"\n\n\"What remark?\"\n\n\"It said, '_My_ masters will be displeased with _me_ if you arrive in a\ndamaged condition.' What does that indicate to you?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI assumed a baffled expression. I didn't have the slightest idea of\nwhat he was driving at and I told him so.\n\n\"Ed,\" he said, \"if you could build an electronic brain capable of\nmaking decisions, how would you build it?\"\n\n\"Hell, I don't know,\" I confessed.\n\n\"Well, if I could build an electronic brain like the one running this\nship, I'd build it with a _conscience_ so it'd do its best at all\ntimes.\"\n\n\"Machines always do their best,\" I argued. \"Come on, untie us. I'm\ngetting a crick in my back!\" I didn't like the idea of being slugged\nwhile asleep. If Kane had been sober and if his wife hadn't been\npresent, I would have let him know exactly what I thought of him.\n\n\"_Our_ machines always do their best,\" he argued, \"because we punch\nbuttons and they respond in predetermined patterns. But the electronic\nbrain in this ship isn't automatic. It makes decisions and I'll bet it\neven has to decide how much energy and time to put into each process!\"\n\n\"So what?\"\n\nHe shrugged muscular shoulders. \"So this ship is operated by a\nthinking, conscientious machine. It's the first time I've encountered\nsuch a machine, but I think I know what will happen. I spent hours last\nnight figuring--\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" I interrupted. \"Are you so drunk that you\ndon't know--\"\n\n\"I'll show you, Ed.\"\n\nHe walked around the table and stood behind my chair. I felt his thick\nfingers around my throat and smelled the alcohol on his breath.\n\n\"Can you see me, machine?\" he asked the empty air.\n\n\"Yes,\" the electronic brain replied.\n\n\"Watch!\"\n\nKane tightened his fingers around my throat.\n\nVerana and Marie screamed shrilly.\n\nMy head seemed to swell like a balloon; my throat gurgled painfully.\n\n\"Please stop,\" the machine pleaded.\n\n\"What will your masters think of you if I kill all of us? You'll return\nto them with a cargo of dead people!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe machine didn't answer. I waited for the electronic brain to\ninterfere and, with a cold knot in my stomach, realized the machine had\nsaid it had no way to control our actions!\n\n\"Your purpose won't be fulfilled, will it?\" Kane demanded. \"Not if you\nreturn with dead specimens!\"\n\n\"No,\" the machine admitted.\n\n\"If you don't take us back to the Moon,\" Kane threatened, \"I'll kill\n_all of us_!\"\n\nThe alien electronic brain was silent.\n\nBy this time, I couldn't see and Kane's voice was a hollow, faraway\nthing that rang in my ears. I tugged at my bindings, but they only\ntightened as I struggled.\n\n\"If you take us back to the Moon, your masters will never know you\nfailed in your mission. They won't know you failed because you won't\nbring them proof of your failure.\"\n\nMy fading consciousness tried to envision the alien mechanical brain as\nit struggled with the problem.\n\n\"Look at it this way,\" Kane persisted. \"If you carry our corpses to\nyour masters, all your efforts will have been useless. If you return us\nto the Moon alive, you'll still have a chance to carry out your mission\nlater.\"\n\nA long silence followed. Verana and Marie screamed at Kane to let go.\nA soft darkness seemed to fill the room, blurring everything, drowning\neven their shrieks in strangling blackness.\n\n\"You win,\" the machine conceded. \"I'll return the ship to the Moon.\"\n\nKane released his grip on my throat.\n\n\"See?\" he asked. \"Didn't I tell you every problem has a solution?\"\n\nI didn't answer. I was too busy enjoying breathing again.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Snare, by Richard R.

It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\nwww.gutenberg.org\n\n\n\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\nU.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the\nmailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its\nvolunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous\nlocations.

Newby\n    Chief Executive and Director\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
