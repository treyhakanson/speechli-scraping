And where he went--_\n\n\n_In November 1809, an Englishman named Benjamin Bathurst vanished,\ninexplicably and utterly._\n\n_He was en route to Hamburg from Vienna, where he had been serving\nas his government's envoy to the court of what Napoleon had left\nof the Austrian Empire. At an inn in Perleburg, in Prussia, while\nexamining a change of horses for his coach, he casually stepped\nout of sight of his secretary and his valet. He was not seen to\nleave the inn yard. He was not seen again, ever._\n\n_At least, not in this continuum...._\n\n\n\n(From Baron Eugen von Krutz, Minister of Police, to His Excellency\nthe Count von Berchtenwald, Chancellor to His Majesty Friedrich\nWilhelm III of Prussia.)\n\n25 November, 1809\n\nYour Excellency:\n\nA circumstance has come to the notice of this Ministry, the\nsignificance of which I am at a loss to define, but, since it\nappears to involve matters of State, both here and abroad, I am\nconvinced that it is of sufficient importance to be brought to\nyour personal attention. Frankly, I am unwilling to take any\nfurther action in the matter without your advice.\n\nBriefly, the situation is this: We are holding, here at the\nMinistry of Police, a person giving his name as Benjamin Bathurst,\nwho claims to be a British diplomat. This person was taken into\ncustody by the police at Perleburg yesterday, as a result of a\ndisturbance at an inn there; he is being detained on technical\ncharges of causing disorder in a public place, and of being a\nsuspicious person. When arrested, he had in his possession a\ndispatch case, containing a number of papers; these are of such an\nextraordinary nature that the local authorities declined to assume\nany responsibility beyond having the man sent here to Berlin.\n\nAfter interviewing this person and examining his papers, I am,\nI must confess, in much the same position. This is not, I am\nconvinced, any ordinary police matter; there is something very\nstrange and disturbing here. The man's statements, taken alone,\nare so incredible as to justify the assumption that he is mad. I\ncannot, however, adopt this theory, in view of his demeanor,\nwhich is that of a man of perfect rationality, and because of the\nexistence of these papers. The whole thing is mad; incomprehensible!\n\nThe papers in question accompany, along with copies of the\nvarious statements taken at Perleburg, a personal letter to me\nfrom my nephew, Lieutenant Rudolf von Tarlburg. This last is\ndeserving of your particular attention; Lieutenant von Tarlburg\nis a very level-headed young officer, not at all inclined to be\nfanciful or imaginative. It would take a good deal to affect him\nas he describes.\n\nThe man calling himself Benjamin Bathurst is now lodged in an\napartment here at the Ministry; he is being treated with every\nconsideration, and, except for freedom of movement, accorded\nevery privilege.\n\nI am, most anxiously awaiting your advice, et cetera, et cetera,\n\nKrutz\n\n\n\n(Report of Traugott Zeller, _Oberwachtmeister_, _Staatspolizei_,\nmade at Perleburg, 25 November, 1809.)\n\nAt about ten minutes past two of the afternoon of Saturday, 25\nNovember, while I was at the police station, there entered a man\nknown to me as Franz Bauer, an inn servant employed by Christian\nHauck, at the sign of the Sword & Scepter, here in Perleburg.\nThis man Franz Bauer made complaint to _Staatspolizeikapitan_\nErnst Hartenstein, saying that there was a madman making trouble\nat the inn where he, Franz Bauer, worked. I was, therefore,\ndirected, by _Staatspolizeikapitan_ Hartenstein, to go to the\nSword & Scepter Inn, there to act at discretion to maintain the\npeace.\n\nArriving at the inn in company with the said Franz Bauer, I found\na considerable crowd of people in the common room, and, in the\nmidst of them, the innkeeper, Christian Hauck, in altercation with\na stranger. This stranger was a gentlemanly-appearing person,\ndressed in traveling clothes, who had under his arm a small\nleather dispatch case. As I entered, I could hear him, speaking in\nGerman with a strong English accent, abusing the innkeeper, the\nsaid Christian Hauck, and accusing him of having drugged his, the\nstranger's, wine, and of having stolen his, the stranger's,\ncoach-and-four, and of having abducted his, the stranger's,\nsecretary and servants. This the said Christian Hauck was loudly\ndenying, and the other people in the inn were taking the\ninnkeeper's part, and mocking the stranger for a madman.\n\nOn entering, I commanded everyone to be silent, in the king's name,\nand then, as he appeared to be the complaining party of the dispute,\nI required the foreign gentleman to state to me what was the\ntrouble. He then repeated his accusations against the innkeeper,\nHauck, saying that Hauck, or, rather, another man who resembled\nHauck and who had claimed to be the innkeeper, had drugged his wine\nand stolen his coach and made off with his secretary and his\nservants. At this point, the innkeeper and the bystanders all began\nshouting denials and contradictions, so that I had to pound on a\ntable with my truncheon to command silence.\n\nI then required the innkeeper, Christian Hauck, to answer the\ncharges which the stranger had made; this he did with a complete\ndenial of all of them, saying that the stranger had had no wine\nin his inn, and that he had not been inside the inn until a few\nminutes before, when he had burst in shouting accusations, and\nthat there had been no secretary, and no valet, and no coachman,\nand no coach-and-four, at the inn, and that the gentleman was\nraving mad. To all this, he called the people who were in the\ncommon room to witness.\n\nI then required the stranger to account for himself. He said\nthat his name was Benjamin Bathurst, and that he was a British\ndiplomat, returning to England from Vienna. To prove this, he\nproduced from his dispatch case sundry papers. One of these was\na letter of safe-conduct, issued by the Prussian Chancellery, in\nwhich he was named and described as Benjamin Bathurst. The other\npapers were English, all bearing seals, and appearing to be\nofficial documents.\n\nAccordingly, I requested him to accompany me to the police station,\nand also the innkeeper, and three men whom the innkeeper wanted to\nbring as witnesses.\n\nTraugott Zeller\n_Oberwachtmeister_\n\nReport approved,\n\nErnst Hartenstein\n_Staatspolizeikapitan_\n\n\n\n(Statement of the self-so-called Benjamin Bathurst, taken at the\npolice station at Perleburg, 25 November, 1809.)\n\nMy name is Benjamin Bathurst, and I am Envoy Extraordinary and\nMinister Plenipotentiary of the government of His Britannic Majesty\nto the court of His Majesty Franz I, Emperor of Austria, or, at\nleast, I was until the events following the Austrian surrender\nmade necessary my return to London. I left Vienna on the morning\nof Monday, the 20th, to go to Hamburg to take ship home; I was\ntraveling in my own coach-and-four, with my secretary, Mr. Bertram\nJardine, and my valet, William Small, both British subjects, and\na coachman, Josef Bidek, an Austrian subject, whom I had hired\nfor the trip. Because of the presence of French troops, whom I\nwas anxious to avoid, I was forced to make a detour west as far\nas Salzburg before turning north toward Magdeburg, where I\ncrossed the Elbe. I was unable to get a change of horses for my\ncoach after leaving Gera, until I reached Perleburg, where I\nstopped at the Sword & Scepter Inn.\n\nArriving there, I left my coach in the inn yard, and I and my\nsecretary, Mr. Jardine, went into the inn. A man, not this fellow\nhere, but another rogue, with more beard and less paunch, and\nmore shabbily dressed, but as like him as though he were his\nbrother, represented himself as the innkeeper, and I dealt with\nhim for a change of horses, and ordered a bottle of wine for\nmyself and my secretary, and also a pot of beer apiece for my\nvalet and the coachman, to be taken outside to them. Then Jardine\nand I sat down to our wine, at a table in the common room, until\nthe man who claimed to be the innkeeper came back and told us\nthat the fresh horses were harnessed to the coach and ready to\ngo. Then we went outside again.\n\nI looked at the two horses on the off side, and then walked around\nin front of the team to look at the two nigh-side horses, and as I\ndid I felt giddy, as though I were about to fall, and everything\nwent black before my eyes. I thought I was having a fainting\nspell, something I am not at all subject to, and I put out my hand\nto grasp the hitching bar, but could not find it. I am sure, now,\nthat I was unconscious for some time, because when my head\ncleared, the coach and horses were gone, and in their place was a\nbig farm wagon, jacked up in front, with the right front wheel\noff, and two peasants were greasing the detached wheel.\n\nI looked at them for a moment, unable to credit my eyes, and\nthen I spoke to them in German, saying, \"Where the devil's my\ncoach-and-four?\"\n\nThey both straightened, startled: the one who was holding the wheel\nalmost dropped it.\n\n\"Pardon, excellency,\" he said, \"there's been no coach-and-four here,\nall the time we've been here.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said his mate, \"and we've been here since just after noon.\"\n\nI did not attempt to argue with them. It occurred to me--and\nit is still my opinion--that I was the victim of some plot; that\nmy wine had been drugged, that I had been unconscious for some\ntime, during which my coach had been removed and this wagon\nsubstituted for it, and that these peasants had been put to work\non it and instructed what to say if questioned. If my arrival at\nthe inn had been anticipated, and everything put in readiness,\nthe whole business would not have taken ten minutes.\n\nI therefore entered the inn, determined to have it out with\nthis rascally innkeeper, but when I returned to the common room,\nhe was nowhere to be seen, and this other fellow, who has given\nhis name as Christian Hauck, claimed to be the innkeeper and\ndenied knowledge of any of the things I have just stated.\nFurthermore, there were four cavalrymen, Uhlans, drinking beer\nand playing cards at the table where Jardine and I had had our\nwine, and they claimed to have been there for several hours.\n\nI have no idea why such an elaborate prank, involving the\nparticipation of many people, should be played on me, except at\nthe instigation of the French. In that case, I cannot understand\nwhy Prussian soldiers should lend themselves to it.\n\nBenjamin Bathurst\n\n\n\n(Statement of Christian Hauck, innkeeper, taken at the police\nstation at Perleburg, 25 November, 1809.)\n\nMay it please your honor, my name is Christian Hauck, and I keep\nan inn at the sign of the Sword & Scepter, and have these past\nfifteen years, and my father, and his father, before me, for the\npast fifty years, and never has there been a complaint like this\nagainst my inn. Your honor, it is a hard thing for a man who\nkeeps a decent house, and pays his taxes, and obeys the laws,\nto be accused of crimes of this sort.\n\nI know nothing of this gentleman, nor of his coach, nor his\nsecretary, nor his servants; I never set eyes on him before he\ncame bursting into the inn from the yard, shouting and raving\nlike a madman, and crying out, \"Where the devil's that rogue of\nan innkeeper?\"\n\nI said to him, \"I am the innkeeper; what cause have you to\ncall me a rogue, sir?\"\n\nThe stranger replied:\n\n\"You're not the innkeeper I did business with a few minutes ago,\nand he's the rascal I want to see. I want to know what the devil's\nbeen done with my coach, and what's happened to my secretary and\nmy servants.\"\n\nI tried to tell him that I knew nothing of what he was talking\nabout, but he would not listen, and gave me the lie, saying that\nhe had been drugged and robbed, and his people kidnaped. He even\nhad the impudence to claim that he and his secretary had been\nsitting at a table in that room, drinking wine, not fifteen\nminutes before, when there had been four noncommissioned officers\nof the Third Uhlans at that table since noon. Everybody in the\nroom spoke up for me, but he would not listen, and was shouting\nthat we were all robbers, and kidnapers, and French spies, and I\ndon't know what all, when the police came.\n\nYour honor, the man is mad. What I have told you about this is the\ntruth, and all that I know about this business, so help me God.\n\nChristian Hauck\n\n\n\n(Statement of Franz Bauer, inn servant, taken at the police station\nat Perleburg, 25 November, 1809.)\n\nMay it please your honor, my name is Franz Bauer, and I am a\nservant at the Sword & Scepter Inn, kept by Christian Hauck.\n\nThis afternoon, when I went into the inn yard to empty a bucket of\nslops on the dung heap by the stables, I heard voices and turned\naround, to see this gentleman speaking to Wilhelm Beick and Fritz\nHerzer, who were greasing their wagon in the yard. He had not been\nin the yard when I had turned away to empty the bucket, and I\nthought that he must have come in from the street. This gentleman\nwas asking Beick and Herzer where was his coach, and when they\ntold him they didn't know, he turned and ran into the inn.\n\nOf my own knowledge, the man had not been inside the inn before\nthen, nor had there been any coach, or any of the people he spoke\nof, at the inn, and none of the things he spoke of happened there,\nfor otherwise I would know, since I was at the inn all day.\n\nWhen I went back inside, I found him in the common room shouting\nat my master, and claiming that he had been drugged and robbed. I\nsaw that he was mad and was afraid that he would do some mischief,\nso I went for the police.\n\nFranz Bauer\nhis (x) mark\n\n\n\n(Statements of Wilhelm Beick and Fritz Herzer, peasants, taken at\nthe police station at Perleburg, 25 November, 1809.)\n\nMay it please your honor, my name is Wilhelm Beick, and I am\na tenant on the estate of the Baron von Hentig. On this day, I\nand Fritz Herzer were sent into Perleburg with a load of potatoes\nand cabbages which the innkeeper at the Sword & Scepter had\nbought from the estate superintendent. After we had unloaded\nthem, we decided to grease our wagon, which was very dry, before\ngoing back, so we unhitched and began working on it. We took\nabout two hours, starting just after we had eaten lunch, and in\nall that time, there was no coach-and-four in the inn yard. We\nwere just finishing when this gentleman spoke to us, demanding to\nknow where his coach was. We told him that there had been no\ncoach in the yard all the time we had been there, so he turned\naround and ran into the inn. At the time, I thought that he had\ncome out of the inn before speaking to us, for I know that he\ncould not have come in from the street. Now I do not know where\nhe came from, but I know that I never saw him before that moment.\n\nWilhelm Beick\nhis (x) mark\n\nI have heard the above testimony, and it is true to my own\nknowledge, and I have nothing to add to it.\n\nFritz Herzer\nhis (x) mark\n\n\n\n(From _Staatspolizeikapitan_ Ernst Hartenstein, to His Excellency,\nthe Baron von Krutz, Minister of Police.)\n\n25 November, 1809\n\nYour Excellency:\n\nThe accompanying copies of statements taken this day will explain\nhow the prisoner, the self-so-called Benjamin Bathurst, came into\nmy custody. I have charged him with causing disorder and being a\nsuspicious person, to hold him until more can be learned about\nhim. However, as he represents himself to be a British diplomat,\nI am unwilling to assume any further responsibility, and am\nhaving him sent to your excellency, in Berlin.\n\nIn the first place, your excellency, I have the strongest doubts\nof the man's story. The statement which he made before me, and\nsigned, is bad enough, with a coach-and-four turning into a farm\nwagon, like Cinderella's coach into a pumpkin, and three people\nvanishing as though swallowed by the earth. But all this is\nperfectly reasonable and credible, beside the things he said to\nme, of which no record was made.\n\nYour excellency will have noticed, in his statement, certain\nallusions to the Austrian surrender, and to French troops in\nAustria. After his statement had been taken down, I noticed these\nallusions, and I inquired, what surrender, and what were French\ntroops doing in Austria. The man looked at me in a pitying\nmanner, and said:\n\n\"News seems to travel slowly, hereabouts; peace was concluded\nat Vienna on the 14th of last month. And as for what French\ntroops are doing in Austria, they're doing the same things\nBonaparte's brigands are doing everywhere in Europe.\"\n\n\"And who is Bonaparte?\" I asked.\n\nHe stared at me as though I had asked him, \"Who is the Lord Jehovah?\"\nThen, after a moment, a look of comprehension came into his face.\n\n\"So, you Prussians concede him the title of Emperor, and refer\nto him as Napoleon,\" he said. \"Well, I can assure you that His\nBritannic Majesty's government haven't done so, and never will;\nnot so long as one Englishman has a finger left to pull a trigger.\nGeneral Bonaparte is a usurper; His Britannic Majesty's government\ndo not recognize any sovereignty in France except the House of\nBourbon.\" This he said very sternly, as though rebuking me.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nIt took me a moment or so to digest that, and to appreciate all its\nimplications. Why, this fellow evidently believed, as a matter of\nfact, that the French Monarchy had been overthrown by some military\nadventurer named Bonaparte, who was calling himself the Emperor\nNapoleon, and who had made war on Austria and forced a surrender. I\nmade no attempt to argue with him--one wastes time arguing with\nmadmen--but if this man could believe that, the transformation of a\ncoach-and-four into a cabbage wagon was a small matter indeed. So,\nto humor him, I asked him if he thought General Bonaparte's agents\nwere responsible for his trouble at the inn.\n\n\"Certainly,\" he replied. \"The chances are they didn't know me\nto see me, and took Jardine for the minister, and me for the\nsecretary, so they made off with poor Jardine. I wonder, though,\nthat they left me my dispatch case. And that reminds me; I'll\nwant that back. Diplomatic papers, you know.\"\n\nI told him, very seriously, that we would have to check his\ncredentials. I promised him I would make every effort to locate\nhis secretary and his servants and his coach, took a complete\ndescription of all of them, and persuaded him to go into an\nupstairs room, where I kept him under guard. I did start\ninquiries, calling in all my informers and spies, but, as I\nexpected, I could learn nothing. I could not find anybody, even,\nwho had seen him anywhere in Perleburg before he appeared at the\nSword & Scepter, and that rather surprised me, as somebody should\nhave seen him enter the town, or walk along the street.\n\nIn this connection, let me remind your excellency of the\ndiscrepancy in the statements of the servant, Franz Bauer, and of\nthe two peasants. The former is certain the man entered the inn\nyard from the street; the latter are just as positive that he did\nnot. Your excellency, I do not like such puzzles, for I am sure\nthat all three were telling the truth to the best of their\nknowledge. They are ignorant common folk, I admit, but they\nshould know what they did or did not see.\n\nAfter I got the prisoner into safekeeping, I fell to examining his\npapers, and I can assure your excellency that they gave me a shock.\nI had paid little heed to his ravings about the King of France\nbeing dethroned, or about this General Bonaparte who called himself\nthe Emperor Napoleon, but I found all these things mentioned in his\npapers and dispatches, which had every appearance of being official\ndocuments. There was repeated mention of the taking, by the French,\nof Vienna, last May, and of the capitulation of the Austrian\nEmperor to this General Bonaparte, and of battles being fought all\nover Europe, and I don't know what other fantastic things. Your\nexcellency, I have heard of all sorts of madmen--one believing\nhimself to be the Archangel Gabriel, or Mohammed, or a werewolf,\nand another convinced that his bones are made of glass, or that he\nis pursued and tormented by devils--but so help me God, this is the\nfirst time I have heard of a madman who had documentary proof for\nhis delusions! Does your excellency wonder, then, that I want no\npart of this business?\n\nBut the matter of his credentials was even worse. He had papers,\nsealed with the seal of the British Foreign Office, and to every\nappearance genuine--but they were signed, as Foreign Minister, by\none George Canning, and all the world knows that Lord Castlereagh\nhas been Foreign Minister these last five years. And to cap it\nall, he had a safe-conduct, sealed with the seal of the Prussian\nChancellery--the very seal, for I compared it, under a strong\nmagnifying glass, with one that I knew to be genuine, and they\nwere identical!--and yet, this letter was signed, as Chancellor,\nnot by Count von Berchtenwald, but by Baron Stein, the Minister of\nAgriculture, and the signature, as far as I could see, appeared to\nbe genuine! This is too much for me, your excellency; I must ask\nto be excused from dealing with this matter, before I become as\nmad as my prisoner!\n\nI made arrangements, accordingly, with Colonel Keitel, of the\nThird Uhlans, to furnish an officer to escort this man into\nBerlin. The coach in which they come belongs to this police\nstation, and the driver is one of my men. He should be furnished\nexpense money to get back to Perleburg. The guard is a corporal\nof Uhlans, the orderly of the officer. He will stay with the\n_Herr Oberleutnant_, and both of them will return here at their\nown convenience and expense.\n\nI have the honor, your excellency, to be, et cetera, et cetera.\n\nErnst Hartenstein\n_Staatspolizeikapitan_\n\n\n\n(From _Oberleutnant_ Rudolf von Tarlburg, to Baron Eugen von Krutz.)\n\n26 November, 1809\n\nDear Uncle Eugen;\n\nThis is in no sense a formal report; I made that at the Ministry,\nwhen I turned the Englishman and his papers over to one of your\nofficers--a fellow with red hair and a face like a bulldog. But\nthere are a few things which you should be told, which wouldn't\nlook well in an official report, to let you know just what sort\nof a rare fish has got into your net.\n\nI had just come in from drilling my platoon, yesterday, when\nColonel Keitel's orderly told me that the colonel wanted to see\nme in his quarters. I found the old fellow in undress in his\nsitting room, smoking his big pipe.\n\n\"Come in, lieutenant; come in and sit down, my boy!\" he greeted\nme, in that bluff, hearty manner which he always adopts with his\njunior officers when he has some particularly nasty job to be\ndone. \"How would you like to take a little trip in to Berlin? I\nhave an errand, which won't take half an hour, and you can stay\nas long as you like, just so you're back by Thursday, when your\nturn comes up for road patrol.\"\n\nWell, I thought, this is the bait. I waited to see what the hook\nwould look like, saying that it was entirely agreeable with me,\nand asking what his errand was.\n\n\"Well, it isn't for myself, Tarlburg,\" he said. \"It's for this\nfellow Hartenstein, the _Staatspolizeikapitan_ here. He has\nsomething he wants done at the Ministry of Police, and I thought\nof you because I've heard you're related to the Baron von Krutz.\nYou are, aren't you?\" he asked, just as though he didn't know all\nabout who all his officers are related to.\n\n\"That's right, colonel; the baron is my uncle,\" I said. \"What\ndoes Hartenstein want done?\"\n\n\"Why, he has a prisoner whom he wants taken to Berlin and turned\nover at the Ministry. All you have to do is to take him in, in a\ncoach, and see he doesn't escape on the way, and get a receipt\nfor him, and for some papers. This is a very important prisoner;\nI don't think Hartenstein has anybody he can trust to handle him.\nThe prisoner claims to be some sort of a British diplomat, and\nfor all Hartenstein knows, maybe he is. Also, he is a madman.\"\n\n\"A madman?\" I echoed.\n\n\"Yes, just so. At least, that's what Hartenstein told me. I wanted\nto know what sort of a madman--there are various kinds of madmen,\nall of whom must be handled differently--but all Hartenstein would\ntell me was that he had unrealistic beliefs about the state of\naffairs in Europe.\"\n\n\"Ha! What diplomat hasn't?\" I asked.\n\nOld Keitel gave a laugh, somewhere between the bark of a dog and\nthe croaking of a raven.\n\n\"Yes, exactly! The unrealistic beliefs of diplomats are what\nsoldiers die of,\" he said. \"I said as much to Hartenstein, but he\nwouldn't tell me anything more. He seemed to regret having said\neven that much. He looked like a man who's seen a particularly\nterrifying ghost.\" The old man puffed hard at his famous pipe for\na while, blowing smoke through his mustache. \"Rudi, Hartenstein\nhas pulled a hot potato out of the ashes, this time, and he wants\nto toss it to your uncle, before he burns his fingers. I think\nthat's one reason why he got me to furnish an escort for his\nEnglishman. Now, look; you must take this unrealistic diplomat,\nor this undiplomatic madman, or whatever in blazes he is, in to\nBerlin. And understand this.\" He pointed his pipe at me as though\nit were a pistol. \"Your orders are to take him there and turn him\nover at the Ministry of Police. Nothing has been said about\nwhether you turn him over alive, or dead, or half one and half\nthe other. I know nothing about this business, and want to know\nnothing; if Hartenstein wants us to play gaol warders for him,\nthen he must be satisfied with our way of doing it!\"\n\nWell, to cut short the story, I looked at the coach Hartenstein\nhad placed at my disposal, and I decided to chain the left door\nshut on the outside, so that it couldn't be opened from within.\nThen, I would put my prisoner on my left, so that the only way out\nwould be past me. I decided not to carry any weapons which he\nmight be able to snatch from me, so I took off my saber and locked\nit in the seat box, along with the dispatch case containing the\nEnglishman's papers. It was cold enough to wear a greatcoat in\ncomfort, so I wore mine, and in the right side pocket, where my\nprisoner couldn't reach, I put a little leaded bludgeon, and also\na brace of pocket pistols. Hartenstein was going to furnish me a\nguard as well as a driver, but I said that I would take a servant,\nwho could act as guard. The servant, of course, was my orderly,\nold Johann; I gave him my double hunting gun to carry, with a big\ncharge of boar shot in one barrel and an ounce ball in the other.\n\nIn addition, I armed myself with a big bottle of cognac. I thought\nthat if I could shoot my prisoner often enough with that, he would\ngive me no trouble.\n\nAs it happened, he didn't, and none of my precautions--except\nthe cognac--were needed. The man didn't look like a lunatic to\nme. He was a rather stout gentleman, of past middle age, with a\nruddy complexion and an intelligent face. The only unusual thing\nabout him was his hat, which was a peculiar contraption, looking\nlike a pot. I put him in the carriage, and then offered him a\ndrink out of my bottle, taking one about half as big myself. He\nsmacked his lips over it and said, \"Well, that's real brandy;\nwhatever we think of their detestable politics, we can't\ncriticize the French for their liquor.\" Then, he said, \"I'm glad\nthey're sending me in the custody of a military gentleman,\ninstead of a confounded gendarme. Tell me the truth, lieutenant;\nam I under arrest for anything?\"\n\n\"Why,\" I said, \"Captain Hartenstein should have told you about\nthat. All I know is that I have orders to take you to the Ministry\nof Police, in Berlin, and not to let you escape on the way. These\norders I will carry out; I hope you don't hold that against me.\"\n\nHe assured me that he did not, and we had another drink on\nit--I made sure, again, that he got twice as much as I did--and\nthen the coachman cracked his whip and we were off for Berlin.\n\nNow, I thought, I am going to see just what sort of a madman this\nis, and why Hartenstein is making a State affair out of a squabble\nat an inn. So I decided to explore his unrealistic beliefs about\nthe state of affairs in Europe.\n\nAfter guiding the conversation to where I wanted it, I asked him:\n\n\"What, _Herr_ Bathurst, in your belief, is the real, underlying\ncause of the present tragic situation in Europe?\"\n\nThat, I thought, was safe enough. Name me one year, since the\ndays of Julius Caesar, when the situation in Europe hasn't been\ntragic! And it worked, to perfection.\n\n\"In my belief,\" says this Englishman, \"the whole mess is the\nresult of the victory of the rebellious colonists in North\nAmerica, and their blasted republic.\"\n\nWell, you can imagine, that gave me a start. All the world knows\nthat the American Patriots lost their war for independence from\nEngland; that their army was shattered, that their leaders were\neither killed or driven into exile. How many times, when I was a\nlittle boy, did I not sit up long past my bedtime, when old\nBaron von Steuben was a guest at Tarlburg-Schloss, listening\nopen-mouthed and wide-eyed to his stories of that gallant lost\nstruggle! How I used to shiver at his tales of the terrible\nwinter camp, or thrill at the battles, or weep as he told how he\nheld the dying Washington in his arms, and listened to his noble\nlast words, at the Battle of Doylestown! And here, this man was\ntelling me that the Patriots had really won, and set up the\nrepublic for which they had fought! I had been prepared for some\nof what Hartenstein had called unrealistic beliefs, but nothing\nas fantastic as this.\n\n\"I can cut it even finer than that,\" Bathurst continued. \"It was\nthe defeat of Burgoyne at Saratoga. We made a good bargain when\nwe got Benedict Arnold to turn his coat, but we didn't do it soon\nenough. If he hadn't been on the field that day, Burgoyne would\nhave gone through Gates' army like a hot knife through butter.\"\n\nBut Arnold hadn't been at Saratoga. I know; I have read much of\nthe American War. Arnold was shot dead on New Year's Day of 1776,\nduring the storming of Quebec. And Burgoyne had done just as\nBathurst had said; he had gone through Gates like a knife, and\ndown the Hudson to join Howe.\n\n\"But, _Herr_ Bathurst,\" I asked, \"how could that affect the\nsituation in Europe? America is thousands of miles away, across\nthe ocean.\"\n\n\"Ideas can cross oceans quicker than armies. When Louis XVI\ndecided to come to the aid of the Americans, he doomed himself\nand his regime. A successful resistance to royal authority in\nAmerica was all the French Republicans needed to inspire them. Of\ncourse, we have Louis's own weakness to blame, too. If he'd given\nthose rascals a whiff of grapeshot, when the mob tried to storm\nVersailles in 1790, there'd have been no French Revolution.\"\n\nBut he had. When Louis XVI ordered the howitzers turned on the\nmob at Versailles, and then sent the dragoons to ride down the\nsurvivors, the Republican movement had been broken. That had been\nwhen Cardinal Talleyrand, who was then merely Bishop of Autun,\nhad came to the fore and become the power that he is today in\nFrance; the greatest King's Minister since Richelieu.\n\n\"And, after that, Louis's death followed as surely as night after\nday,\" Bathurst was saying. \"And because the French had no experience\nin self-government, their republic was foredoomed. If Bonaparte\nhadn't seized power, somebody else would have; when the French\nmurdered their king, they delivered themselves to dictatorship.\nAnd a dictator, unsupported by the prestige of royalty, has no\nchoice but to lead his people into foreign war, to keep them from\nturning upon him.\"\n\nIt was like that all the way to Berlin. All these things seem\nfoolish, by daylight, but as I sat in the darkness of that\nswaying coach, I was almost convinced of the reality of what he\ntold me. I tell you, Uncle Eugen, it was frightening, as though\nhe were giving me a view of Hell. _Gott im Himmel_, the things\nthat man talked of! Armies swarming over Europe; sack and\nmassacre, and cities burning; blockades, and starvation; kings\ndeposed, and thrones tumbling like tenpins; battles in which the\nsoldiers of every nation fought, and in which tens of thousands\nwere mowed down like ripe grain; and, over all, the Satanic\nfigure of a little man in a gray coat, who dictated peace to the\nAustrian Emperor in Schoenbrunn, and carried the Pope away a\nprisoner to Savona.\n\nMadman, eh? Unrealistic beliefs, says Hartenstein? Well, give\nme madmen who drool spittle, and foam at the mouth, and shriek\nobscene blasphemies. But not this pleasant-seeming gentleman who\nsat beside me and talked of horrors in a quiet, cultured voice,\nwhile he drank my cognac.\n\nBut not all my cognac! If your man at the Ministry--the one\nwith red hair and the bulldog face--tells you that I was drunk\nwhen I brought in that Englishman, you had better believe him!\n\nRudi.\n\n\n\n(From Count von Berchtenwald, to the British Minister.)\n\n28 November, 1809\n\nHonored Sir:\n\nThe accompanying dossier will acquaint you with the problem\nconfronting this Chancellery, without needless repetition on my\npart. Please to understand that it is not, and never was, any\npart of the intentions of the government of His Majesty Friedrich\nWilhelm III to offer any injury or indignity to the government of\nHis Britannic Majesty George III. We would never contemplate\nholding in arrest the person, or tampering with the papers, of an\naccredited envoy of your government. However, we have the gravest\ndoubt, to make a considerable understatement, that this person\nwho calls himself Benjamin Bathurst is any such envoy, and we do\nnot think that it would be any service to the government of His\nBritannic Majesty to allow an impostor to travel about Europe in\nthe guise of a British diplomatic representative. We certainly\nshould not thank the government of His Britannic Majesty for\nfailing to take steps to deal with some person who, in England,\nmight falsely represent himself to be a Prussian diplomat.\n\nThis affair touches us as closely as it does your own government;\nthis man had in his possession a letter of safe-conduct, which\nyou will find in the accompanying dispatch case. It is of the\nregular form, as issued by this Chancellery, and is sealed with\nthe Chancellery seal, or with a very exact counterfeit of it.\nHowever, it has been signed, as Chancellor of Prussia, with a\nsignature indistinguishable from that of the Baron Stein, who is\nthe present Prussian Minister of Agriculture. Baron Stein was\nshown the signature, with the rest of the letter covered, and\nwithout hesitation acknowledged it for his own writing. However,\nwhen the letter was uncovered and shown to him, his surprise and\nhorror were such as would require the pen of a Goethe or a\nSchiller to describe, and he denied categorically ever having\nseen the document before.\n\nI have no choice but to believe him. It is impossible to think\nthat a man of Baron Stein's honorable and serious character would\nbe party to the fabrication of a paper of this sort. Even aside\nfrom this, I am in the thing as deeply as he; if it is signed\nwith his signature, it is also sealed with my seal, which has not\nbeen out of my personal keeping in the ten years that I have been\nChancellor here. In fact, the word \"impossible\" can be used to\ndescribe the entire business. It was impossible for the man\nBenjamin Bathurst to have entered the inn yard--yet he did. It\nwas impossible that he should carry papers of the sort found in\nhis dispatch case, or that such papers should exist--yet I am\nsending them to you with this letter. It is impossible that Baron\nvon Stein should sign a paper of the sort he did, or that it\nshould be sealed by the Chancellery--yet it bears both Stein's\nsignature and my seal.\n\nYou will also find in the dispatch case other credentials,\nostensibly originating with the British Foreign Office, of the\nsame character, being signed by persons having no connection with\nthe Foreign Office, or even with the government, but being sealed\nwith apparently authentic seals. If you send these papers to\nLondon, I fancy you will find that they will there create the same\nsituation as that caused here by this letter of safe-conduct.\n\nI am also sending you a charcoal sketch of the person who calls\nhimself Benjamin Bathurst. This portrait was taken without its\nsubject's knowledge. Baron von Krutz's nephew, Lieutenant von\nTarlburg, who is the son of our mutual friend Count von Tarlburg,\nhas a little friend, a very clever young lady who is, as you will\nsee, an expert at this sort of work: she was introduced into a\nroom at the Ministry of Police and placed behind a screen, where\nshe could sketch our prisoner's face. If you should send this\npicture to London, I think that there is a good chance that it\nmight be recognized. I can vouch that it is an excellent likeness.\n\nTo tell the truth, we are at our wits' end about this affair.\nI cannot understand how such excellent imitations of these\nvarious seals could be made, and the signature of the Baron von\nStein is the most expert forgery that I have ever seen, in thirty\nyears' experience as a statesman. This would indicate careful and\npainstaking work on the part of somebody; how, then, do we\nreconcile this with such clumsy mistakes, recognizable as such by\nany schoolboy, as signing the name of Baron Stein as Prussian\nChancellor, or Mr. George Canning, who is a member of the\nopposition party and not connected with your government, as\nBritish Foreign secretary.\n\n[Illustration: 25 NOVEMBER 1808]\n\nThese are mistakes which only a madman would make. There are those\nwho think our prisoner is mad, because of his apparent delusions\nabout the great conqueror, General Bonaparte, alias the Emperor\nNapoleon. Madmen have been known to fabricate evidence to support\ntheir delusions, it is true, but I shudder to think of a madman\nhaving at his disposal the resources to manufacture the papers you\nwill find in this dispatch case. Moreover, some of our foremost\nmedical men, who have specialized in the disorders of the mind,\nhave interviewed this man Bathurst and say that, save for his\nfixed belief in a nonexistent situation, he is perfectly sane.\n\nPersonally, I believe that the whole thing is a gigantic hoax,\nperpetrated for some hidden and sinister purpose, possibly to\ncreate confusion, and to undermine the confidence existing\nbetween your government and mine, and to set against one another\nvarious persons connected with both governments, or else as a\nmask for some other conspiratorial activity. Only a few months\nago, you will recall, there was a Jacobin plot unmasked at K\u00f6ln.\n\nBut, whatever this business may portend, I do not like it. I\nwant to get to the bottom of it as soon as possible, and I will\nthank you, my dear sir, and your government, for any assistance\nyou may find possible.\n\nI have the honor, sir, to be, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera,\n\nBerchtenwald\n\n\n\nFROM BARON VON KRUTZ, TO THE COUNT VON BERCHTENWALD. MOST URGENT;\nMOST IMPORTANT. TO BE DELIVERED IMMEDIATELY AND IN PERSON\nREGARDLESS OF CIRCUMSTANCES.\n\n28 November, 1809\n\nCount von Berchtenwald:\n\nWithin the past half hour, that is, at about eleven o'clock\ntonight, the man calling himself Benjamin Bathurst was shot and\nkilled by a sentry at the Ministry of Police, while attempting to\nescape from custody.\n\nA sentry on duty in the rear courtyard of the Ministry observed\na man attempting to leave the building in a suspicious and furtive\nmanner. This sentry, who was under the strictest orders to allow\nno one to enter or leave without written authorization, challenged\nhim; when he attempted to run, the sentry fired his musket at him,\nbringing him down. At the shot, the Sergeant of the Guard rushed\ninto the courtyard with his detail, and the man whom the sentry\nhad shot was found to be the Englishman, Benjamin Bathurst. He had\nbeen hit in the chest with an ounce ball, and died before the\ndoctor could arrive, and without recovering consciousness.\n\nAn investigation revealed that the prisoner, who was confined\non the third floor of the building, had fashioned a rope from his\nbedding, his bed cord, and the leather strap of his bell pull.\nThis rope was only long enough to reach to the window of the\noffice on the second floor, directly below, but he managed to\nenter this by kicking the glass out of the window. I am trying to\nfind out how he could do this without being heard. I can assure\nyou that somebody is going to smart for this night's work. As for\nthe sentry, he acted within his orders; I have commended him for\ndoing his duty, and for good shooting, and I assume full\nresponsibility for the death of the prisoner at his hands.\n\nI have no idea why the self-so-called Benjamin Bathurst, who,\nuntil now, was well-behaved and seemed to take his confinement\nphilosophically, should suddenly make this rash and fatal attempt,\nunless it was because of those infernal dunderheads of madhouse\ndoctors who have been bothering him. Only this afternoon they\ndeliberately handed him a bundle of newspapers--Prussian, Austrian,\nFrench, and English--all dated within the last month. They wanted\nthey said, to see how he would react. Well, God pardon them,\nthey've found out!\n\nWhat do you think should be done about giving the body burial?\n\nKrutz\n\n\n\n(From the British Minister, to the Count von Berchtenwald.)\n\nDecember 20th, 1809\n\nMy dear Count von Berchtenwald:\n\nReply from London to my letter of the 28th, which accompanied the\ndispatch case and the other papers, has finally come to hand. The\npapers which you wanted returned--the copies of the statements\ntaken at Perleburg, the letter to the Baron von Krutz from the\npolice captain, Hartenstein, and the personal letter of Krutz's\nnephew, Lieutenant von Tarlburg, and the letter of safe-conduct\nfound in the dispatch case--accompany herewith. I don't know what\nthe people at Whitehall did with the other papers; tossed them\ninto the nearest fire, for my guess. Were I in your place, that's\nwhere the papers I am returning would go.\n\nI have heard nothing, yet, from my dispatch of the 29th concerning\nthe death of the man who called himself Benjamin Bathurst, but I\ndoubt very much if any official notice will ever be taken of it.\nYour government had a perfect right to detain the fellow, and,\nthat being the case, he attempted to escape at his own risk. After\nall, sentries are not required to carry loaded muskets in order to\ndiscourage them from putting their hands in their pockets.\n\nTo hazard a purely unofficial opinion, I should not imagine that\nLondon is very much dissatisfied with this d\u00e9nouement. His Majesty's\ngovernment are a hard-headed and matter-of-fact set of gentry who do\nnot relish mysteries, least of all mysteries whose solution may be\nmore disturbing than the original problem.\n\nThis is entirely confidential, but those papers which were in\nthat dispatch case kicked up the devil's own row in London, with\nhalf the government bigwigs protesting their innocence to high\nHeaven, and the rest accusing one another of complicity in the\nhoax. If that was somebody's intention, it was literally a\nhowling success. For a while, it was even feared that there would\nbe questions in Parliament, but eventually, the whole vexatious\nbusiness was hushed.\n\nYou may tell Count Tarlburg's son that his little friend is a\nmost talented young lady; her sketch was highly commended by no\nless an authority than Sir Thomas Lawrence, and here comes the\nmost bedeviling part of a thoroughly bedeviled business. The\npicture was instantly recognized. It is a very fair likeness of\nBenjamin Bathurst, or, I should say, Sir Benjamin Bathurst, who\nis King's lieutenant governor for the Crown Colony of Georgia. As\nSir Thomas Lawrence did his portrait a few years back, he is in\nan excellent position to criticize the work of Lieutenant von\nTarlburg's young lady. However, Sir Benjamin Bathurst was known\nto have been in Savannah, attending to the duties of his office,\nand in the public eye, all the while that his double was in\nPrussia. Sir Benjamin does not have a twin brother. It has been\nsuggested that this fellow might be a half-brother, but, as far\nas I know, there is no justification for this theory.\n\nThe General Bonaparte, alias the Emperor Napoleon, who is given so\nmuch mention in the dispatches, seems also to have a counterpart\nin actual life; there is, in the French army, a Colonel of\nArtillery by that name, a Corsican who Gallicized his original\nname of Napolione Buonaparte. He is a most brilliant military\ntheoretician; I am sure some of your own officers, like General\nScharnhorst, could tell you about him. His loyalty to the French\nmonarchy has never been questioned.\n\nThis same correspondence to fact seems to crop up everywhere in\nthat amazing collection of pseudo-dispatches and pseudo-State\npapers. The United States of America, you will recall, was the\nstyle by which the rebellious colonies referred to themselves, in\nthe Declaration of Philadelphia. The James Madison who is\nmentioned as the current President of the United States is now\nliving, in exile, in Switzerland. His alleged predecessor in\noffice, Thomas Jefferson, was the author of the rebel Declaration;\nafter the defeat of the rebels, he escaped to Havana, and died,\nseveral years ago, in the Principality of Lichtenstein.\n\nI was quite amused to find our old friend Cardinal\nTalleyrand--without the ecclesiastical title--cast in the role of\nchief adviser to the usurper, Bonaparte. His Eminence, I have\nalways thought, is the sort of fellow who would land on his feet\non top of any heap, and who would as little scruple to be Prime\nMinister to His Satanic Majesty as to His Most Christian Majesty.\n\nI was baffled, however, by one name, frequently mentioned in\nthose fantastic papers. This was the English general, Wellington.\nI haven't the least idea who this person might be.\n\nI have the honor, your excellency, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera,\n\nSir Arthur Wellesley\n\n\nTHE END.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's He Walked Around the Horses, by Henry Beam Piper\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK HE WALKED AROUND THE HORSES ***\n\n***** This file should be named 18807-8.txt or 18807-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/8/8/0/18807/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, William Woods and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n*** END: FULL LICENSE ***\n"}
