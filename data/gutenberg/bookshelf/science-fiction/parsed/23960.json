After a Few Words ...\n\n                           by Seaton McKettrig\n\n                          Illustrated by Summer\n\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from \"Analog\" October 1962.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright\non this publication was renewed.]\n\n\n\n\n     This is a science-fiction story. History is a science; the other\n     part is, as all Americans know, the most fictional field we have\n     today.\n\n\n\n\nHe settled himself comfortably in his seat, and carefully put the helmet\non, pulling it down firmly until it was properly seated. For a moment,\nhe could see nothing.\n\nThen his hand moved up and, with a flick of the wrist, lifted the visor.\nAhead of him, in serried array, with lances erect and pennons flying,\nwas the forward part of the column. Far ahead, he knew, were the Knights\nTemplars, who had taken the advance. Behind the Templars rode the mailed\nknights of Brittany and Anjou. These were followed by King Guy of\nJerusalem and the host of Poitou.\n\nHe himself, Sir Robert de Bouain, was riding with the Norman and English\ntroops, just behind the men of Poitou. Sir Robert turned slightly in his\nsaddle. To his right, he could see the brilliant red-and-gold banner of\nthe lion-hearted Richard of England--_gules, in pale three lions passant\nguardant or_. Behind the standard-bearer, his great war horse moving\nwith a steady, measured pace, his coronet of gold on his steel helm\ngleaming in the glaring desert sun, the lions of England on his\nfirm-held shield, was the King himself.\n\nFurther behind, the Knights Hospitallers protected the rear, guarding\nthe column of the hosts of Christendom from harassment by the Bedouins.\n\n\"By our Lady!\" came a voice from his left. \"Three days out from Acre,\nand the accursed Saracens still elude us.\"\n\nSir Robert de Bouain twisted again in his saddle to look at the knight\nriding alongside him. Sir Gaeton de l'Arc-Tomb\u00e9 sat tall and straight in\nhis saddle, his visor up, his blue eyes narrowed against the glare of\nthe sun.\n\nSir Robert's lips formed a smile. \"They are not far off, Sir Gaeton.\nThey have been following us. As we march parallel to the seacoast, so\nthey have been marching with us in those hills to the east.\"\n\n\"Like the jackals they are,\" said Sir Gaeton. \"They assail us from the\nrear, and they set up traps in our path ahead. Our spies tell us that\nthe Turks lie ahead of us in countless numbers. And yet, they fear to\nface us in open battle.\"\n\n\"Is it fear, or are they merely gathering their forces?\"\n\n\"Both,\" said Sir Gaeton flatly. \"They fear us, else they would not dally\nto amass so fearsome a force. If, as our informers tell us, there are\nuncounted Turks to the fore, and if, as we are aware, our rear is being\ndogged by the Bedouin and the black horsemen of Egypt, it would seem\nthat Saladin has at hand more than enough to overcome us, were they all\ntruly Christian knights.\"\n\n\"Give them time. We must wait for their attack, sir knight. It were\nfoolhardy to attempt to seek them in their own hills, and yet they must\nstop us. They will attack before we reach Jerusalem, fear not.\"\n\n\"We of Gascony fear no heathen Musselman,\" Sir Gaeton growled. \"It's\nthis Hellish heat that is driving me mad.\" He pointed toward the eastern\nhills. \"The sun is yet low, and already the heat is unbearable.\"\n\nSir Robert heard his own laugh echo hollowly within his helmet. \"Perhaps\n'twere better to be mad when the assault comes. Madmen fight better than\nmen of cooler blood.\" He knew that the others were baking inside their\nheavy armor, although he himself was not too uncomfortable.\n\nSir Gaeton looked at him with a smile that held both irony and respect.\n\"In truth, sir knight, it is apparent that you fear neither men nor\nheat. Nor is your own blood too cool. True, I ride with your Normans and\nyour English and your King Richard of the Lion's Heart, but I am a\nGascon, and have sworn no fealty to him. But to side with the Duke of\nBurgundy against King Richard--\" He gave a short, barking laugh. \"I\nfear no man,\" he went on, \"but if I had to fear one, it would be Richard\nof England.\"\n\nSir Robert's voice came like a sword: steely, flat, cold, and sharp. \"My\nlord the King spoke in haste. He has reason to be bitter against Philip\nof France, as do we all. Philip has deserted the field. He has returned\nto France in haste, leaving the rest of us to fight the Saracen for the\nHoly Land leaving only the contingent of his vassal the Duke of Burgundy\nto remain with us.\"\n\n\"Richard of England has never been on the best of terms with Philip\nAugustus,\" said Sir Gaeton.\n\n\"No, and with good cause. But he allowed his anger against Philip to\ncolor his judgment when he spoke harshly against the Duke of Burgundy.\nThe Duke is no coward, and Richard Plantagenet well knows it. As I said,\nhe spoke in haste.\"\n\n\"And you intervened,\" said Sir Gaeton.\n\n\"It was my duty.\" Sir Robert's voice was stubborn. \"Could we have\npermitted a quarrel to develop between the two finest knights and\nwarleaders in Christendom at this crucial point? The desertion of Philip\nof France has cost us dearly. Could we permit the desertion of Burgundy,\ntoo?\"\n\n\"You did what must be done in honor,\" the Gascon conceded, \"but you have\nnot gained the love of Richard by doing so.\"\n\nSir Robert felt his jaw set firmly. \"My king knows I am loyal.\"\n\nSir Gaeton said nothing more, but there was a look in his eyes that\nshowed that he felt that Richard of England might even doubt the loyalty\nof Sir Robert de Bouain.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSir Robert rode on in silence, feeling the movement of the horse beneath\nhim.\n\nThere was a sudden sound to the rear. Like a wash of the tide from the\nsea came the sound of Saracen war cries and the clash of steel on steel\nmingled with the sounds of horses in agony and anger.\n\nSir Robert turned his horse to look.\n\nThe Negro troops of Saladin's Egyptian contingent were thundering down\nupon the rear! They clashed with the Hospitallers, slamming in like a\nrain of heavy stones, too close in for the use of bows. There was only\nthe sword against armor, like the sound of a thousand hammers against a\nthousand anvils.\n\n\"Stand fast! Stand fast! Hold them off!\" It was the voice of King\nRichard, sounding like a clarion over the din of battle.\n\nSir Robert felt his horse move, as though it were urging him on toward\nthe battle, but his hand held to the reins, keeping the great charger in\ncheck. The King had said \"Stand fast!\" and this was no time to disobey\nthe orders of Richard.\n\nThe Saracen troops were coming in from the rear, and the Hospitallers\nwere taking the brunt of the charge. They fought like madmen, but they\nwere slowly being forced back.\n\nThe Master of the Hospitallers rode to the rear, to the King's standard,\nwhich hardly moved in the still desert air, now that the column had\nstopped moving.\n\nThe voice of the Duke of Burgundy came to Sir Robert's ears.\n\n\"Stand fast. The King bids you all to stand fast,\" said the duke, his\nvoice fading as he rode on up the column toward the knights of Poitou\nand the Knights Templars.\n\nThe Master of the Hospitallers was speaking in a low, urgent voice to\nthe King: \"My lord, we are pressed on by the enemy and in danger of\neternal infamy. We are losing our horses, one after the other!\"\n\n\"Good Master,\" said Richard, \"it is you who must sustain their attack.\nNo one can be everywhere at once.\"\n\nThe Master of the Hospitallers nodded curtly and charged back into the\nfray.\n\nThe King turned to Sir Baldwin de Carreo, who sat ahorse nearby, and\npointed toward the eastern hills. \"They will come from there, hitting us\nin the flank; we cannot afford to amass a rearward charge. To do so\nwould be to fall directly into the hands of the Saracen.\"\n\nA voice very close to Sir Robert said: \"Richard is right. If we go to\nthe aid of the Hospitallers, we will expose the column to a flank\nattack.\" It was Sir Gaeton.\n\n\"My lord the King,\" Sir Robert heard his voice say, \"is right in all but\none thing. If we allow the Egyptians to take us from the rear, there\nwill be no need for Saladin and his Turks to come down on our flank. And\nthe Hospitallers cannot hold for long at this rate. A charge at full\ngallop would break the Egyptian line and give the Hospitallers breathing\ntime. Are you with me?\"\n\n\"Against the orders of the King?\"\n\n\"The King cannot see everything! There are times when a man must use his\nown judgment! You said you were afraid of no man. Are you with me?\"\n\nAfter a moment's hesitation, Sir Gaeton couched his lance. \"I'm with\nyou, sir knight! Live or die, I follow! Strike and strike hard!\"\n\n\"Forward then!\" Sir Robert heard himself shouting. \"Forward for St.\nGeorge and for England!\"\n\n\"St. George and England!\" the Gascon echoed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTwo great war horses began to move ponderously forward toward the battle\nlines, gaining momentum as they went. Moving in unison, the two knights,\ntheir horses now at a fast trot, lowered their lances, picking their\nSaracen targets with care. Larger and larger loomed the Egyptian\ncavalrymen as the horses changed pace to a thundering gallop.\n\nThe Egyptians tried to dodge, as they saw, too late, the approach of the\nChristian knights.\n\nSir Robert felt the shock against himself and his horse as the steel tip\nof the long ash lance struck the Saracen horseman in the chest. Out of\nthe corner of his eye, he saw that Sir Gaeton, too, had scored.\n\nThe Saracen, impaled on Sir Robert's lance, shot from the saddle as he\ndied. His lighter armor had hardly impeded the incoming spear-point, and\nnow his body dragged it down as he dropped toward the desert sand.\nAnother Moslem cavalryman was charging in now, swinging his curved\nsaber, taking advantage of Sir Robert's sagging lance.\n\nThere was nothing else to do but drop the lance and draw his heavy\nbroadsword. His hand grasped it, and it came singing from its scabbard.\n\nThe Egyptian's curved sword clanged against Sir Robert's helm, setting\nhis head ringing. In return, the knight's broadsword came about in a\nsweeping arc, and the Egyptian's horse rode on with the rider's headless\nbody.\n\nBehind him, Sir Robert heard further cries of \"St. George and England!\"\n\nThe Hospitallers, taking heart at the charge, were going in! Behind them\ncame the Count of Champagne, the Earl of Leister, and the Bishop of\nBeauvais, who carried a great warhammer in order that he might not break\nChurch Law by shedding blood.\n\nSir Robert's own sword rose and fell, cutting and hacking at the enemy.\nHe himself felt a dreamlike detachment, as though he were watching the\nbattle rather than participating in it.\n\nBut he could see that the Moslems were falling back before the Christian\nonslaught.\n\nAnd then, quite suddenly, there seemed to be no foeman to swing at.\nBreathing heavily, Sir Robert sheathed his broadsword.\n\nBeside him, Sir Gaeton did the same, saying: \"It will be a few minutes\nbefore they can regroup, sir knight. We may have routed them\ncompletely.\"\n\n\"Aye. But King Richard will not approve of my breaking ranks and\ndisobeying orders. I may win the battle and lose my head in the end.\"\n\n\"This is no time to worry about the future,\" said the Gascon. \"Rest for\na moment and relax, that you may be the stronger later. Here--have an\n_Old Kings_.\"\n\nHe had a pack of cigarettes in his gauntleted hand, which he profferred\nto Sir Robert. There were three cigarettes protruding from it, one\nslightly farther than the others. Sir Robert's hand reached out and took\nthat one.\n\n\"Thanks. When the going gets rough, I really enjoy an _Old Kings_.\"\n\nHe put one end of the cigarette in his mouth and lit the other from the\nlighter in Sir Gaeton's hand.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Sir Gaeton, after lighting his own cigarette, \"_Old\nKings_ are the greatest. They give a man real, deep-down smoking\npleasure.\"\n\n\"There's no doubt about it, _Old Kings_ are a _man's_ cigarette.\" Sir\nRobert could feel the soothing smoke in his lungs as he inhaled deeply.\n\"That's great. When I want a cigarette, I don't want just _any_\ncigarette.\"\n\n\"Nor I,\" agreed the Gascon. \"_Old Kings_ is the only real cigarette when\nyou're doing a real _man's_ work.\"\n\n\"That's for sure.\" Sir Robert watched a smoke ring expand in the air.\n\nThere was a sudden clash of arms off to their left. Sir Robert dropped\nhis cigarette to the ground. \"The trouble is that doing a real he-man's\nwork doesn't always allow you to enjoy the fine, rich tobaccos of _Old\nKings_ right down to the very end.\"\n\n\"No, but you can always light another later,\" said the Gascon knight.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKing Richard, on seeing his army moving suddenly toward the harassed\nrear, had realized the danger and had charged through the Hospitallers\nto get into the thick of the fray. Now the Turks were charging down from\nthe hills, hitting--not the flank as he had expected, but the rear!\nSaladin had expected him to hold fast!\n\nSir Robert and Sir Gaeton spurred their chargers toward the flapping\nbanner of England.\n\nThe fierce warrior-king of England, his mighty sword in hand, was\ncutting down Turks as though they were grain-stalks, but still the\nSaracen horde pressed on. More and more of the terrible Turks came\nboiling down out of the hills, their glittering scimitars swinging.\n\nSir Robert lost all track of time. There was nothing to do but keep his\nown great broadsword moving, swinging like some gigantic metronome as he\nhacked down the Moslem foes.\n\nAnd then, suddenly, he found himself surrounded by the Saracens! He was\nisolated and alone, cut off from the rest of the Christian forces! He\nglanced quickly around as he slashed another Saracen from pate to\nbreastbone. Where was Sir Gaeton? Where were the others? Where was the\nred-and-gold banner of Richard?\n\nHe caught a glimpse of the fluttering banner far to the rear and started\nto fall back.\n\nAnd then he saw another knight nearby, a huge man who swung his\nsparkling blade with power and force. On his steel helm gleamed a golden\ncoronet! Richard!\n\nAnd the great king, in spite of his prowess was outnumbered heavily and\nwould, within seconds, be cut down by the Saracen horde!\n\nWithout hesitation, Sir Robert plunged his horse toward the surrounded\nmonarch, his great blade cutting a path before him.\n\nHe saw Richard go down, falling from the saddle of his charger, but by\nthat time his own sword was cutting into the screaming Saracens and\nthey had no time to attempt any further mischief to the King. They had\ntheir hands full with Sir Robert de Bouain.\n\nHe did not know how long he fought there, holding his charger motionless\nover the inert body of the fallen king, hewing down the screaming enemy,\nbut presently he heard the familiar cry of \"For St. George and for\nEngland\" behind him. The Norman and English troops were charging in,\nbringing with them the banner of England!\n\nAnd then Richard was on his feet, cleaving the air about him with his\nown broadsword. Its bright edge, besmeared with Saracen blood, was\nbiting viciously into the foe.\n\nThe Turks began to fall back. Within seconds, the Christian knights were\nboiling around the embattled pair, forcing the Turks into retreat. And\nfor the second time, Sir Robert found himself with no one to fight.\n\nAnd then a voice was saying: \"You have done well this day, sir knight.\nRichard Plantagenet will not forget.\"\n\nSir Robert turned in his saddle to face the smiling king.\n\n\"My lord king, be assured that I would never forget my loyalty to my\nsovereign and liege lord. My sword and my life are yours whenever you\ncall.\"\n\nKing Richard's gauntleted hand grasped his own. \"If it please God, I\nshall never ask your life. An earldom awaits you when we return to\nEngland, sir knight.\"\n\nAnd then the king mounted his horse and was running full gallop after\nthe retreating Saracens.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRobert took off his helmet.\n\nHe blinked for a second to adjust his eyes to the relative dimness of\nthe studio. After the brightness of the desert that the televicarion\nhelmet had projected into his eyes, the studio seemed strangely\ncavelike.\n\n\"How'd you like it, Bob?\" asked one of the two producers of the show.\n\nRobert Bowen nodded briskly and patted the televike helmet. \"It was\nO.K.,\" he said. \"Good show. A little talky at the beginning, and it\nneeds a better fade-out, but the action scenes were fine. The sponsor\nought to like it--for a while, at least.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, 'for a while'?\"\n\nRobert Bowen sighed. \"If this thing goes on the air the way it is, he'll\nlose sales.\"\n\n\"Why? Commercial not good enough?\"\n\n\"_Too_ good! Man, I've smoked _Old Kings_, and, believe me, the real\nthing never tasted as good as that cigarette did in the commercial!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's ...After a Few Words..., by Gordon Randall Garrett\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ...AFTER A FEW WORDS... ***\n\n***** This file should be named 23960-8.txt or 23960-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/3/9/6/23960/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
