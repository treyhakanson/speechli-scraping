It was the smell of trouble. He hadn't found what the trouble\nwas yet, but he would. That was his business. He was a captain of\nguards in Estates-General Correctional Institution--better known to\nits inmates as the Jug--and if he hadn't been able to detect the scent\nof trouble brewing a cell-block away, he would never have survived to\nreach his captaincy.\n\nAnd her name, he saw, was Sue-Ann Bradley, Detainee No. WFA-656R.\n\nHe frowned at the rap sheet, trying to figure out what got a girl like\nher into a place like this. And, what was more important, why she\ncouldn't adjust herself to it, now that she was in.\n\nHe demanded: \"Why wouldn't you mop out your cell?\"\n\nThe girl lifted her head angrily and took a step forward. The block\nguard, Sodaro, growled warningly: \"Watch it, auntie!\"\n\nO'Leary shook his head. \"Let her talk, Sodaro.\" It said in the _Civil\nService Guide to Prison Administration_: \"Detainees will be permitted\nto speak in their own behalf in disciplinary proceedings.\" And O'Leary\nwas a man who lived by the book.\n\nShe burst out: \"I never got a chance! That old witch Mathias never told\nme I was supposed to mop up. She banged on the door and said, 'Slush\nup, sister!' And then, ten minutes later, she called the guards and\ntold them I refused to mop.\"\n\nThe block guard guffawed. \"Wipe talk--that's what she was telling you\nto do. Cap'n, you know what's funny about this? This Bradley is--\"\n\n\"Shut up, Sodaro.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCaptain O'leary put down his pencil and looked at the girl. She was\nattractive and young--not beyond hope, surely. Maybe she had got off\nto a wrong start, but the question was, would putting her in the\ndisciplinary block help straighten her out? He rubbed his ear and\nlooked past her at the line of prisoners on the rap detail, waiting for\nhim to judge their cases.\n\nHe said patiently: \"Bradley, the rules are you have to mop out your\ncell. If you didn't understand what Mathias was talking about, you\nshould have asked her. Now I'm warning you, the next time--\"\n\n\"Hey, Cap'n, wait!\" Sodaro was looking alarmed. \"This isn't a first\noffense. Look at the rap sheet. Yesterday she pulled the same thing in\nthe mess hall.\" He shook his head reprovingly at the prisoner. \"The\nblock guard had to break up a fight between her and another wench,\nand she claimed the same business--said she didn't understand when the\nother one asked her to move along.\" He added virtuously: \"The guard\nwarned her then that next time she'd get the Greensleeves for sure.\"\n\nInmate Bradley seemed to be on the verge of tears. She said tautly: \"I\ndon't care. I don't care!\"\n\nO'Leary stopped her. \"That's enough! Three days in Block O!\"\n\nIt was the only thing to do--for her own sake as much as for his. He\nhad managed, by strength of will, not to hear that she had omitted\nto say \"sir\" every time she spoke to him, but he couldn't keep it up\nforever and he certainly couldn't overlook hysteria. And hysteria was\nclearly the next step for her.\n\nAll the same, he stared after her as she left. He handed the rap sheet\nto Sodaro and said absently: \"Too bad a kid like her has to be here.\nWhat's she in for?\"\n\n\"You didn't know, Cap'n?\" Sodaro leered. \"She's in for conspiracy to\nviolate the Categoried Class laws. Don't waste your time with her,\nCap'n. She's a figger-lover!\"\n\nCaptain O'Leary took a long drink of water from the fountain marked\n\"Civil Service.\" But it didn't wash the taste out of his mouth, the\nsmell from his nose.\n\nWhat got into a girl to get her mixed up with that kind of dirty\nbusiness? He checked out of the cell blocks and walked across the\nyard, wondering about her. She'd had every advantage--decent Civil\nService parents, a good education, everything a girl could wish for. If\nanything, she had had a better environment than O'Leary himself, and\nlook what she had made of it.\n\nThe direction of evolution is toward specialization and Man is no\nexception, but with the difference that his is the one species that\ncreates its own environment in which to specialize. From the moment\nthat clans formed, specialization began--the hunters using the weapons\nmade by the flint-chippers, the food cooked in clay pots made by the\nceramists, over fire made by the shaman who guarded the sacred flame.\n\nCivilization merely increased the extent of specialization. From\nthe born mechanic and the man with the gift of gab, society evolved\nto the point of smaller contact and less communication between the\nspecializations, until now they could understand each other on only the\nmost basic physical necessities--and not even always then.\n\nBut this was desirable, for the more specialists, the higher the degree\nof civilization. The ultimate should be the complete segregation\nof each specialization--social and genetic measures to make them\nbreed true, because the unspecialized man is an uncivilized man,\nor at any rate he does not advance civilization. And letting the\nspecializations mix would produce genetic undesirables: clerk-laborer\nor Professional-GI misfits, for example, being only half specialized,\nwould be good at no specialization.\n\nAnd the basis of this specialization society was: \"The aptitude groups\nare the true races of mankind.\" Putting it into law was only the legal\nenforcement of a demonstrable fact.\n\n\"Evening, Cap'n.\" A bleary old inmate orderly stood up straight and\ntouched his cap as O'Leary passed by.\n\n\"Evening.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nO'Leary noted, with the part of his mind that always noted those\nthings, that the orderly had been leaning on his broom until he'd\nnoticed the captain coming by. Of course, there wasn't much to\nsweep--the spray machines and sweeperdozers had been over the\ncobblestones of the yard twice already that day. But it was an inmate's\njob to keep busy. And it was a guard captain's job to notice when they\ndidn't.\n\nThere wasn't anything wrong with that job, he told himself. It was a\nperfectly good civil-service position--better than post-office clerk,\nnot as good as Congressman, but a job you could be proud to hold. He\n_was_ proud of it. It was _right_ that he should be proud of it. He was\ncivil-service born and bred, and naturally he was proud and content to\ndo a good, clean civil-service job.\n\nIf he had happened to be born a fig--a _clerk_, he corrected\nhimself--if he had happened to be born a clerk, why, he would have been\nproud of that, too. There wasn't anything wrong with being a clerk--or\na mechanic or a soldier, or even a laborer, for that matter.\n\nGood laborers were the salt of the Earth! They weren't smart, maybe,\nbut they had a--well, a sort of natural, relaxed joy of living. O'Leary\nwas a broad-minded man and many times he had thought almost with a\ntouch of envy how _comfortable_ it must be to be a wipe--a _laborer_.\nNo responsibilities. No worries. Just an easy, slow routine of work and\nloaf, work and loaf.\n\nOf course, he wouldn't _really_ want that kind of life, because he was\nCivil Service and not the kind to try to cross over class barriers that\nweren't _meant_ to be--\n\n\"Evening, Cap'n.\"\n\nHe nodded to the mechanic inmate who was, theoretically, in charge of\nmaintaining the prison's car pool, just inside the gate.\n\n\"Evening, Conan,\" he said.\n\nConan, now--he was a big buck greaser and he would be there for the\nnext hour, languidly poking a piece of fluff out of the air filter on\nthe prison jeep. Lazy, sure. Undependable, certainly. But he kept the\ncars going--and, O'Leary thought approvingly, when his sentence was up\nin another year or so, he would go back to his life with his status\nrestored, a mechanic on the outside as he had been inside, and he\ncertainly would never risk coming back to the Jug by trying to pass as\nCivil Service or anything else. He knew his place.\n\nSo why didn't this girl, this Sue-Ann Bradley, know hers?\n\n\nII\n\nEvery prison has its Greensleeves--sometimes they are called by\ndifferent names. Old Marquette called it \"the canary;\" Louisiana State\ncalled it \"the red hats;\" elsewhere it was called \"the hole,\" \"the\nsnake pit,\" \"the Klondike.\" When you're in it, you don't much care what\nit is called; it is a place for punishment.\n\nAnd punishment is what you get.\n\nBlock O in Estates-General Correctional Institution was the\ndisciplinary block, and because of the green straitjackets its\ninhabitants wore, it was called the Greensleeves. It was a community of\nits own, an enclave within the larger city-state that was the Jug. And\nlike any other community, it had its leading citizens ... two of them.\nTheir names were Sauer and Flock.\n\nSue-Ann Bradley heard them before she reached the Greensleeves. She\nwas in a detachment of three unfortunates like herself, convoyed by an\nirritable guard, climbing the steel steps toward Block O from the floor\nbelow, when she heard the yelling.\n\n\"Owoo-o-o,\" screamed Sauer from one end of the cell block and\n\"Yow-w-w!\" shrieked Flock at the other.\n\nThe inside deck guard of Block O looked nervously at the outside deck\nguard. The outside guard looked impassively back--after all, he was on\nthe outside.\n\nThe inside guard muttered: \"Wipe rats! They're getting on my nerves.\"\n\nThe outside guard shrugged.\n\n\"Detail, _halt_!\" The two guards turned to see what was coming in as\nthe three new candidates for the Greensleeves slumped to a stop at the\nhead of the stairs. \"Here they are,\" Sodaro told them. \"Take good care\nof 'em, will you? Especially the lady--she's going to like it here,\nbecause there's plenty of wipes and greasers and figgers to keep her\ncompany.\" He laughed coarsely and abandoned his charges to the Block O\nguards.\n\nThe outside guard said sourly: \"A woman, for God's sake. Now O'Leary\nknows I hate it when there's a woman in here. It gets the others all\nriled up.\"\n\n\"Let them in,\" the inside guard told him. \"The others are riled up\nalready.\"\n\nSue-Ann Bradley looked carefully at the floor and paid them no\nattention. The outside guard pulled the switch that turned on the\ntanglefoot electronic fields that swamped the floor of the block\ncorridor and of each individual cell. While the fields were on, you\ncould ignore the prisoners--they simply could not move fast enough,\nagainst the electronic drag of the field, to do any harm. But it was a\nrule that, even in Block O, you didn't leave the tangler fields on all\nthe time--only when the cell doors had to be opened or a prisoner's\nrestraining garment removed.\n\nSue-Ann walked bravely forward through the opened gate--and fell flat\non her face. It was her first experience of a tanglefoot field. It was\nlike walking through molasses.\n\nThe guard guffawed and lifted her up by one shoulder. \"Take it easy,\nauntie. Come on, get in your cell.\" He steered her in the right\ndirection and pointed to a greensleeved straitjacket on the cell cot.\n\"Put that on. Being as you're a lady, we won't tie it up, but the rules\nsay you got to wear it and the rules--Hey. She's crying!\" He shook his\nhead, marveling. It was the first time he had ever seen a prisoner cry\nin the Greensleeves.\n\nHowever, he was wrong. Sue-Ann's shoulders were shaking, but not from\ntears. Sue-Ann Bradley had got a good look at Sauer and at Flock as she\npassed them by and she was fighting off an almost uncontrollable urge\nto retch.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSauer and Flock were what are called prison wolves. They were\nlaborers--\"wipes,\" for short--or, at any rate, they had been once.\nThey had spent so much time in prisons that it was sometimes hard even\nfor them to remember what they really were, outside. Sauer was a big,\ngrinning redhead with eyes like a water moccasin. Flock was a lithe\nfive-footer with the build of a water moccasin--and the sad, stupid\neyes of a calf.\n\nSauer stopped yelling for a moment. \"Hey, Flock!\"\n\n\"What do you want, Sauer?\" called Flock from his own cell.\n\n\"We got a lady with us! Maybe we ought to cut out this yelling so\nas not to disturb the lady!\" He screeched with howling, maniacal\nlaughter. \"Anyway, if we don't cut this out, they'll get us in trouble,\nFlock!\"\n\n\"Oh, you think so?\" shrieked Flock. \"Jeez, I wish you hadn't said that,\nSauer. You got me scared! I'm so scared, I'm gonna have to yell!\"\n\nThe howling started all over again.\n\nThe inside guard finished putting the new prisoners away and turned off\nthe tangler field once more. He licked his lips. \"Say, you want to take\na turn in here for a while?\"\n\n\"Uh-uh.\" The outside guard shook his head.\n\n\"You're yellow,\" the inside guard said moodily. \"Ah, I don't know why I\ndon't quit this lousy job. Hey, you! Pipe down or I'll come in and beat\nyour head off!\"\n\n\"Ee-ee-ee!\" screamed Sauer in a shrill falsetto. \"I'm scared!\" Then he\ngrinned at the guard, all but his water-moccasin eyes. \"Don't you know\nyou can't hurt a wipe by hitting him on the head, Boss?\"\n\n\"Shut _up_!\" yelled the inside guard.\n\nSue-Ann Bradley's weeping now was genuine. She simply could not help\nit. The crazy yowling of the hard-timers, Sauer and Flock, was getting\nunder her skin. They weren't even--even _human_, she told herself\nmiserably, trying to weep silently so as not to give the guards the\nsatisfaction of hearing her--they were animals!\n\nResentment and anger, she could understand. She told herself doggedly\nthat resentment and anger were natural and right. They were perfectly\nnormal expressions of the freedom-loving citizen's rebellion against\nthe vile and stifling system of Categoried Classes. It was _good_ that\nSauer and Flock still had enough spirit to struggle against the vicious\nsystem--\n\nBut did they have to scream so?\n\nThe senseless yelling was driving her crazy. She abandoned herself to\nweeping and she didn't even care who heard her any more. Senseless!\n\nIt never occurred to Sue-Ann Bradley that it might not be senseless,\nbecause noise hides noise. But then she hadn't been a prisoner very\nlong.\n\n\nIII\n\n\"I smell trouble,\" said O'Leary to the warden.\n\n\"Trouble? Trouble?\" Warden Schluckebier clutched his throat and his\nlittle round eyes looked terrified--as perhaps they should have. Warden\nGodfrey Schluckebier was the almighty Caesar of ten thousand inmates in\nthe Jug, but privately he was a fussy old man trying to hold onto the\nlast decent job he would have in his life.\n\n\"Trouble? _What_ trouble?\"\n\nO'Leary shrugged. \"Different things. You know Lafon, from Block A? This\nafternoon, he was playing ball with the laundry orderlies in the yard.\"\n\nThe warden, faintly relieved, faintly annoyed, scolded: \"O'Leary, what\ndid you want to worry me for? There's nothing wrong with playing ball\nin the yard. That's what recreation periods are for.\"\n\n\"You don't see what I mean, Warden. Lafon was a professional on the\noutside--an architect. Those laundry cons were laborers. Pros and wipes\ndon't mix; it isn't natural. And there are other things.\"\n\nO'Leary hesitated, frowning. How could you explain to the warden that\nit didn't _smell_ right?\n\n\"For instance--Well, there's Aunt Mathias in the women's block. She's\na pretty good old girl--that's why she's the block orderly. She's a\nlifer, she's got no place to go, she gets along with the other women.\nBut today she put a woman named Bradley on report. Why? Because she\ntold Bradley to mop up in wipe talk and Bradley didn't understand. Now\nMathias wouldn't--\"\n\nThe warden raised his hand. \"Please, O'Leary, don't bother me about\nthat kind of stuff.\" He sighed heavily and rubbed his eyes. He poured\nhimself a cup of steaming black coffee from a brewpot, reached in a\ndesk drawer for something, hesitated, glanced at O'Leary, then dropped\na pale blue tablet into the cup. He drank it down eagerly, ignoring the\nscalding heat.\n\nHe leaned back, looking suddenly happier and much more assured.\n\n\"O'Leary, you're a guard captain, right? And I'm your warden. You have\nyour job, keeping the inmates in line, and I have mine. Now your job is\njust as important as my job,\" he said piously. \"_Everybody's_ job is\njust as important as everybody else's, right? But we have to stick to\nour own jobs. We don't want to try to _pass_.\"\n\nO'Leary snapped erect, abruptly angry. Pass! What the devil way was\nthat for the warden to talk to him?\n\n\"Excuse the expression, O'Leary,\" the warden said anxiously. \"I mean,\nafter all, 'Specialization is the goal of civilization,' right?\" He was\na great man for platitudes, was Warden Schluckebier. \"_You_ know you\ndon't want to worry about _my_ end of running the prison. And _I_ don't\nwant to worry about _yours_. You see?\" And he folded his hands and\nsmiled like a civil-service Buddha.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nO'Leary choked back his temper. \"Warden, I'm telling you that there's\ntrouble coming up. I smell the signs.\"\n\n\"Handle it, then!\" snapped the warden, irritated at last.\n\n\"But suppose it's too big to handle. Suppose--\"\n\n\"It isn't,\" the warden said positively. \"Don't borrow trouble with\nall your supposing, O'Leary.\" He sipped the remains of his coffee,\nmade a wry face, poured a fresh cup and, with an elaborate show of not\nnoticing what he was doing, dropped three of the pale blue tablets into\nit this time.\n\nHe sat beaming into space, waiting for the jolt to take effect.\n\n\"Well, then,\" he said at last. \"You just remember what I've told you\ntonight, O'Leary, and we'll get along fine. 'Specialization is the--'\nOh, curse the thing.\"\n\nHis phone was ringing. The warden picked it up irritably.\n\nThat was the trouble with those pale blue tablets, thought O'Leary;\nthey gave you a lift, but they put you on edge.\n\n\"Hello,\" barked the warden, not even glancing at the viewscreen. \"What\nthe devil do you want? Don't you know I'm--What? You did _what_?\nYou're going to WHAT?\"\n\nHe looked at the viewscreen at last with a look of pure horror.\nWhatever he saw on it, it did not reassure him. His eyes opened like\nclamshells in a steamer.\n\n\"O'Leary,\" he said faintly, \"my mistake.\"\n\nAnd he hung up--more or less by accident; the handset dropped from his\nfingers.\n\nThe person on the other end of the phone was calling from Cell Block O.\n\nFive minutes before, he hadn't been anywhere near the phone and it\ndidn't look as if his chances of ever getting near it were very good.\nBecause five minutes before, he was in his cell, with the rest of the\nhard-timers of the Greensleeves.\n\nHis name was Flock.\n\nHe was still yelling. Sue-Ann Bradley, in the cell across from him,\nthought that maybe, after all, the man was really in pain. Maybe the\ncrazy screams were screams of agony, because certainly his face was the\nface of an agonized man.\n\nThe outside guard bellowed: \"Okay, okay. Take ten!\"\n\nSue-Ann froze, waiting to see what would happen. What actually did\nhappen was that the guard reached up and closed the switch that\nactuated the tangler fields on the floors of the cells. The prison\nrules were humanitarian, even for the dregs that inhabited the\nGreensleeves. Ten minutes out of every two hours, even the worst case\nhad to be allowed to take his hands out of the restraining garment.\n\n\"Rest period\" it was called--in the rule book. The inmates had a less\nlovely term for it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt the guard's yell, the inmates jumped to their feet.\n\nBradley was a little slow getting off the edge of the steel-slat\nbed--nobody had warned her that the eddy currents in the tangler fields\nhad a way of making metal smoke-hot. She gasped but didn't cry out.\nScore one more painful lesson in her new language course. She rubbed\nthe backs of her thighs gingerly--and slowly, slowly, for the eddy\ncurrents did not permit you to move fast. It was like pushing against\nrubber; the faster you tried to move, the greater the resistance.\n\nThe guard peered genially into her cell. \"You're okay, auntie.\" She\nproudly ignored him as he slogged deliberately away on his rounds.\nHe didn't have to untie her and practically stand over her while\nshe attended to various personal matters, as he did with the male\nprisoners. It was not much to be grateful for, but Sue-Ann Bradley was\ngrateful. At least she didn't have to live _quite_ like a fig--like an\nunderprivileged clerk, she told herself, conscience-stricken.\n\nAcross the hall, the guard was saying irritably: \"What the hell's\nthe matter with you?\" He opened the door of the cell with an\nasbestos-handled key held in a canvas glove.\n\nFlock was in that cell and he was doubled over.\n\nThe guard looked at him doubtfully. It could be a trick, maybe.\nCouldn't it? But he could see Flock's face and the agony in it was real\nenough. And Flock was gasping, through real tears: \"Cramps. I--I--\"\n\n\"Ah, you wipes always got a pain in the gut.\" The guard lumbered around\nFlock to the draw-strings at the back of the jacket. Funny smell in\nhere, he told himself--not for the first time. And imagine, some people\ndidn't believe that wipes had a smell of their own! But this time, he\nrealized cloudily, it was a rather unusual smell. Something burning.\nAlmost like meat scorching.\n\nIt wasn't pleasant. He finished untying Flock and turned away; let the\nstinking wipe take care of his own troubles. He only had ten minutes to\nget all the way around Block O and the inmates complained like crazy if\nhe didn't make sure they all got the most possible free time. He was\npretty good at snowshoeing through the tangler field. He was a little\nvain about it, even; at times he had been known to boast of his ability\nto make the rounds in two minutes, every time.\n\nEvery time but this.\n\nFor Flock moaned behind him, oddly close.\n\nThe guard turned, but not quickly enough. There was\nFlock--astonishingly, he was half out of his jacket; his arms hadn't\nbeen in the sleeves at all! And in one of the hands, incredibly, there\nwas something that glinted and smoked.\n\n\"All right,\" croaked Flock, tears trickling out of eyes nearly shut\nwith pain.\n\nBut it wasn't the tears that held the guard; it was the shining,\nsmoking thing, now poised at his throat. A shiv! It looked as though\nit had been made out of a bed-spring, ripped loose from its frame God\nknows how, hidden inside the greensleeved jacket God knows how--filed,\nfiled to sharpness over endless hours.\n\nNo wonder Flock moaned--the eddy currents in the shiv were slowly\ncooking his hand; and the blister against his abdomen, where the shiv\nhad been hidden during other rest periods, felt like raw acid.\n\n\"All right,\" whispered Flock, \"just walk out the door and you won't get\nhurt. Unless the other screw makes trouble, you won't get hurt, so tell\nhim not to, you hear?\"\n\nHe was nearly fainting with the pain.\n\nBut he hadn't let go.\n\nHe didn't let go. And he didn't stop.\n\n\nIV\n\nIt was Flock on the phone to the warden--Flock with his eyes still\nstreaming tears, Flock with Sauer standing right behind him, menacing\nthe two bound deck guards.\n\nSauer shoved Flock out of the way. \"Hey, Warden!\" he said, and the\nvoice was a cheerful bray, though the serpent eyes were cold and\nhating. \"Warden, you got to get a medic in here. My boy Flock, he hurt\nhimself real bad and he needs a doctor.\" He gestured playfully at the\nguards with the shiv. \"I tell you, Warden. I got this knife and I got\nyour guards here. Enough said? So get a medic in here quick, you hear?\"\n\nAnd he snapped the connection.\n\nO'Leary said: \"Warden, I told you I smelled trouble!\"\n\nThe warden lifted his head, glared, started feebly to speak, hesitated,\nand picked up the long-distance phone. He said sadly to the prison\noperator: \"Get me the governor--fast.\"\n\n_Riot!_\n\nThe word spread out from the prison on seven-league boots.\n\nIt snatched the city governor out of a friendly game of Seniority\nwith his manager and their wives--and just when he was holding the\nPorkbarrel Joker concealed in the hole.\n\nIt broke up the Base Championship Scramble Finals at Hap Arnold Field\nto the south, as half the contestants had to scramble in earnest to a\nRed Alert that was real.\n\nIt reached to police precinct houses and TV newsrooms and highway\ncheckpoints, and from there it filtered into the homes and lives of the\nnineteen million persons that lived within a few dozen miles of the Jug.\n\nRiot. And yet fewer than half a dozen men were involved.\n\nA handful of men, and the enormous bulk of the city-state quivered in\nevery limb and class. In its ten million homes, in its hundreds of\nthousands of public places, the city-state's people shook under the\nimpact of the news from the prison.\n\nFor the news touched them where their fears lay. Riot! And not merely\na street brawl among roistering wipes, or a bar-room fight of greasers\nrelaxing from a hard day at the plant. The riot was down among the\ncorrupt sludge that underlay the state itself. Wipes brawled with wipes\nand no one cared; but in the Jug, all classes were cast together.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nForty miles to the south, Hap Arnold Field was a blaze of light. The\nairmen tumbled out of their quarters and dayrooms at the screech of\nthe alert siren, and behind them their wives and children stretched\nand yawned and worried. An alert! The older kids fussed and complained\nand their mothers shut them up. No, there wasn't any alert scheduled\nfor tonight; no, they didn't know where Daddy was going; no, the kids\ncouldn't get up yet--it was the middle of the night.\n\nAnd as soon as they had the kids back in bed, most of the mothers\nstruggled into their own airwac uniforms and headed for the briefing\narea to hear.\n\nThey caught the words from a distance--not quite correctly. \"Riot!\"\ngasped an aircraftswoman first-class, mother of three. \"The wipes! I\n_told_ Charlie they'd get out of hand and--Alys, we aren't safe. You\nknow how they are about GI women! I'm going right home and get a club\nand stand right by the door and--\"\n\n\"Club!\" snapped Alys, radarscope-sergeant, with two children\nquerulously awake in her nursery at home. \"What in God's name is the\nuse of a club? You can't hurt a wipe by hitting him on the head. You'd\nbetter come along to Supply with me and draw a gun--you'll need it\nbefore this night is over.\"\n\nBut the airmen themselves heard the briefing loud and clear over the\nscramble-call speakers, and they knew it was not merely a matter of\ntrouble in the wipe quarters. The Jug! The governor himself had called\nthem out; they were to fly interdicting missions at such-and-such\nlevels on such-and-such flight circuits around the prison.\n\nThe rockets took off on fountains of fire; and the jets took off with a\nwhistling roar; and last of all, the helicopters took off ... and they\nwere the ones who might actually accomplish something. They took up\ntheir picket posts on the prison perimeter, a pilot and two bombardiers\nin each 'copter, stone-faced, staring grimly alert at the prison below.\n\nThey were ready for the breakout.\n\nBut there wasn't any breakout.\n\nThe rockets went home for fuel. The jets went home for fuel. The\nhelicopters hung on--still ready, still waiting.\n\nThe rockets came back and roared harmlessly about, and went away again.\nThey stayed away. The helicopter men never faltered and never relaxed.\nThe prison below them was washed with light--from the guard posts on\nthe walls, from the cell blocks themselves, from the mobile lights of\nthe guard squadrons surrounding the walls.\n\nNorth of the prison, on the long, flat, damp developments of reclaimed\nland, the matchbox row houses of the clerical neighborhoods showed\nlights in every window as the figgers stood ready to repel invasion\nfrom their undesired neighbors to the east, the wipes. In the crowded\ntenements of the laborers' quarters, the wipes shouted from window to\nwindow; and there were crowds in the bright streets.\n\n\"The whole bloody thing's going to blow up!\" a helicopter bombardier\nyelled bitterly to his pilot, above the flutter and roar of the\nwhirling blades. \"Look at the mobs in Greaserville! The first breakout\nfrom the Jug's going to start a fight like you never saw and we'll be\nright in the middle of it!\"\n\nHe was partly right. He would be right in the middle of it--for every\nman, woman and child in the city-state would be right in the middle of\nit. There was no place anywhere that would be spared. _No mixing._ That\nwas the prescription that kept the city-state alive. There's no harm in\na family fight--and aren't all mechanics a family, aren't all laborers\na clan, aren't all clerks and office workers related by closer ties\nthan blood or skin?\n\nBut the declassed cons of the Jug were the dregs of every class; and\nonce they spread, the neat compartmentation of society was pierced. The\nbreakout would mean riot on a bigger scale than any prison had ever\nknown.\n\nBut he was also partly wrong. Because the breakout wasn't seeming to\ncome.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Jug itself was coming to a boil.\n\nHonor Block A, relaxed and easy at the end of another day, found itself\nshaken alert by strange goings-on. First there was the whir and roar of\nthe Air Force overhead. _Trouble._ Then there was the sudden arrival\nof extra guards, doubling the normal complement--day-shift guards,\nsummoned away from their comfortable civil-service homes at some urgent\ncall. _Trouble for sure._\n\nHonor Block A wasn't used to trouble. A Block was as far from the\nGreensleeves of O Block as you could get and still be in the Jug. Honor\nBlock A belonged to the prison's halfbreeds--the honor prisoners, the\ntrusties who did guards' work because there weren't enough guards to go\naround. They weren't Apaches or Piutes; they were camp-following Injuns\nwho had sold out for the white man's firewater. The price of their\nservice was privilege--many privileges.\n\nItem: TV sets in every cell. Item: Hobby tools, to make gadgets for\nthe visitor trade--the only way an inmate could earn an honest dollar.\nItem: In consequence, an exact knowledge of everything the outside\nworld knew and put on its TV screens (including the grim, alarming\nreports of \"trouble at Estates-General\"), and the capacity to convert\ntheir \"hobby tools\" to--other uses.\n\nAn honor prisoner named Wilmer Lafon was watching the TV screen with an\nexpression of rage and despair.\n\nLafon was a credit to the Jug--he was a showpiece for visitors.\nPrison rules provided for prisoner training--it was a matter of\n\"rehabilitation.\" Prisoner rehabilitation is a joke and a centuries-old\none at that; but it had its serious uses, and one of them was to keep\nthe prisoners busy. It didn't much matter at what.\n\nLafon, for instance, was being \"rehabilitated\" by studying\narchitecture. The guards made a point of bringing inspection\ndelegations to his cell to show him off. There were his walls, covered\nwith pin-ups--but not of women. The pictures were sketches Lafon had\ndrawn himself; they were of buildings, highways, dams and bridges; they\nwere splendidly conceived and immaculately executed.\n\n\"Looka that!\" the guards would rumble to their guests. \"There isn't an\narchitect on the outside as good as this boy! What do you say, Wilmer?\nTell the gentlemen--how long you been taking these correspondence\ncourses in architecture? Six years! Ever since he came to the Jug.\"\n\nAnd Lafon would grin and bob his head, and the delegation would go,\nwith the guards saying something like: \"Believe me, that Wilmer could\ndesign a whole skyscraper--and it wouldn't fall down, either!\"\n\nAnd they were perfectly, provably right. Not only could Inmate Lafon\ndesign a skyscraper, but he had already done so. More than a dozen of\nthem. And none had fallen down.\n\nOf course, that was more than six years back, before he was convicted\nand sent to the Jug. He would never design another. Or if he did, it\nwould never be built. For the plain fact of the matter was that the\nJug's rehabilitation courses were like rehabilitation in every prison\nsince crime and punishment began. They kept the inmates busy. They\nmade a show of purpose for an institution that had never had a purpose\nbeyond punishment.\n\nAnd that was all.\n\nFor punishment for a crime is not satisfied by a jail sentence. How\ndoes it hurt a man to feed and clothe and house him, with the bills\npaid by the state? Lafon's punishment was that he, as an architect, was\n_through_.\n\nSavage tribes used to lop off a finger or an ear to punish a criminal.\nCivilized societies confine their amputations to bits and pieces of the\npersonality. Chop-chop, and a man's reputation comes off; chop-chop\nagain, and his professional standing is gone; chop-chop, and he has\nlost the respect and trust of his fellows.\n\nThe jail itself isn't the punishment. The jail is only the shaman's\nhatchet that performs the amputation. If rehabilitation in a jail\nworked--if it were _meant_ to work--it would be the end of jails.\n\nRehabilitation? Rehabilitation for what?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWilmer Lafon switched off the television set and silently pounded his\nfist into the wall.\n\nNever again to return to the Professional class! For, naturally, the\nconviction had cost him his membership in the Architectural Society and\n_that_ had cost him his Professional standing.\n\nBut still--just to be out of the Jug, that would be something! And his\nwhole hope of ever getting out lay not here in Honor Block A, but in\nthe turmoil of the Greensleeves, a hundred meters and more than fifty\narmed guards away.\n\nHe was a furious man. He looked into the cell next door, where a\ncon named Garcia was trying to concentrate on a game of Solitaire\nSplitfee. Once Garcia had been a Professional, too; he was the closest\nthing to a friend Wilmer Lafon had. Maybe he could now help to get\nLafon where he wanted--_needed!_--to be.\n\nLafon swore silently and shook his head. Garcia was a spineless\nmilksop, as bad as any clerk--Lafon was nearly sure there was a touch\nof the inkwell somewhere in his family. Shrewd and slippery enough,\nlike all figgers. But you couldn't rely on him in a pinch.\n\nLafon would have to do it all himself.\n\nHe thought for a second, ignoring the rustle and mumble of the other\nhonor prisoners of Block A. There was no help for it; he would have to\ndirty his hands with physical activity.\n\nOutside on the deck, the guards were grumbling to each other. Lafon\nwiped the scowl off his black face, put on a smile, rehearsed what he\nwas going to say, and politely rattled the door of his cell.\n\n\"Shut up down there!\" one of the screws bawled. Lafon recognized the\nvoice; it was the guard named Sodaro. That was all to the good. He knew\nSodaro and he had some plans for him.\n\nHe rattled the cell door again and called: \"Chief, can you come here a\nminute, please?\"\n\nSodaro yelled: \"Didn't you hear me? Shut up!\" But he came wandering by\nand looked into Lafon's tidy little cell.\n\n\"What the devil do you want?\" he growled.\n\nLafon said ingratiatingly: \"What's going on, Chief?\"\n\n\"Shut your mouth,\" Sodaro said absently and yawned. He hefted his\nshoulder holster comfortably. That O'Leary, what a production he had\nmade of getting the guards back! And here he was, stuck in Block A on\nthe night he had set aside for getting better acquainted with that\nlittle blue-eyed statistician from the Census office.\n\n\"Aw, Chief. The television says there's something going on in the\nGreensleeves. What's the score?\"\n\nSodaro had no reason not to answer him, but it was his unvarying\npractice to make a con wait before doing anything the con wanted. He\ngave Lafon a ten-second stare before he relented.\n\n\"The score? Sauer and Flock took over Block O. What about it?\"\n\nMuch, much about it! But Lafon looked away to hide the eagerness in his\neyes. Perhaps, after all, it was not too late....\n\nHe suggested humbly: \"You look a little sleepy. Do you want some\ncoffee?\"\n\n\"Coffee?\" Sodaro scratched. \"You got a cup for me?\"\n\n\"Certainly! I've got one put aside--swiped it from the messhall--not\nthe one I use myself.\"\n\n\"Um.\" Sodaro leaned on the cell door. \"You know I could toss you in the\nGreensleeves for stealing from the messhall.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Aw, chief!\" Lafon grinned.\n\n\"You been looking for trouble. O'Leary says you were messing around\nwith the bucks from the laundry detail,\" Sodaro said halfheartedly.\nBut he didn't really like picking on Lafon, who was, after all, an\nagreeable inmate to have on occasion. \"All right. Where's the coffee?\"\n\nThey didn't bother with tanglefoot fields in Honor Block A. Sodaro just\nunlocked the door and walked in, hardly bothering to look at Lafon. He\ntook three steps toward the neat little desk at the back of the cell,\nwhere Lafon had rigged up a drawing board and a table, where Lafon kept\nhis little store of luxury goods.\n\nThree steps.\n\nAnd then, suddenly aware that Lafon was very close to him, he turned,\nastonished--a little too late. He saw that Lafon had snatched up a\nmetal chair; he saw Lafon swinging it, his black face maniacal; he saw\nthe chair coming down.\n\nHe reached for his shoulder holster, but it was very much too late for\nthat.\n\n\nV\n\nCaptain O'Leary dragged the scared little wretch into the warden's\noffice. He shook the con angrily. \"Listen to this, Warden! The boys\njust brought this one in from the Shops Building. Do you know what he's\nbeen up to?\"\n\nThe warden wheezed sadly and looked away. He had stopped even answering\nO'Leary by now. He had stopped talking to Sauer on the interphone when\nthe big convict called, every few minutes, to rave and threaten and\ndemand a doctor. He had almost stopped doing everything except worry\nand weep. But--still and all, he was the warden. He was the one who\ngave the orders.\n\nO'Leary barked: \"Warden, this little greaser has bollixed up the whole\ntangler circuit for the prison. If the cons get out into the yard now,\nyou won't be able to tangle them. You know what that means? They'll\nhave the freedom of the yard, and who knows what comes next?\"\n\nThe warden frowned sympathetically. \"Tsk, tsk.\"\n\nO'Leary shook the con again. \"Come on, Hiroko! Tell the warden what you\ntold the guards.\"\n\nThe con shrank away from him. Sweat was glistening on his furrowed\nyellow forehead. \"I--I had to do it, Cap'n! I shorted the wormcan in\nthe tangler subgrid, but I had to! I got a signal--'Bollix the grid\ntonight or some day you'll be in the yard and we'll static you!' What\ncould I do, Cap'n? I didn't want to--\"\n\nO'Leary pressed: \"Who did the signal come from?\"\n\nThe con only shook his head, perspiring still more.\n\nThe warden asked faintly: \"What's he saying?\"\n\nO'Leary rolled his eyes to heaven. And this was the warden--couldn't\neven understand shoptalk from the mouths of his own inmates!\n\nHe translated: \"He got orders from the prison underground to\nshort-circuit the electronic units in the tangler circuit. They\nthreatened to kill him if he didn't.\"\n\nThe warden drummed with his fingers on the desk.\n\n\"The tangler field, eh? My, yes. That is important. You'd better get it\nfixed, O'Leary. Right away.\"\n\n\"Fixed? Warden, who's going to fix it? You know as well as I do that\nevery mechanic in the prison is a con. Even if one of the guards would\ndo a thing like that--and I'd bust him myself if he did!--he wouldn't\nknow where to start. That's mechanic work.\"\n\nThe warden swallowed. He had to admit that O'Leary was right. Naturally\nnobody but a mechanic--and a specialist electrician from a particular\nsubgroup of the greaser class at that--could fix something like the\ntangler field generators.\n\nHe said absently: \"Well, that's true enough. After all, 'Specialization\nis the goal of civilization,' you know.\"\n\nO'Leary took a deep breath. He needed it.\n\nHe beckoned to the guard at the door. \"Take this greaser out of here!\"\n\nThe con shambled out, his head hanging.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nO'Leary turned to the warden and spread his hands.\n\n\"Warden,\" he said, \"don't you see how this thing is building up? Let's\nnot just wait for the place to explode in our faces! Let me take a\nsquad into Block O before it's too late.\"\n\nThe warden pursed his lips thoughtfully and cocked his head, as though\nhe were trying to find some trace of merit in an unreasonable request.\n\nHe said at last: \"No.\"\n\nO'Leary made a passionate sound that was trying to be bad language, but\nhe was too raging mad to articulate it. He walked stiffly away from the\nlimp, silent warden and stared out the window.\n\nAt least, he told himself, _he_ hadn't gone to pieces. It was his\ndoing, not the warden's, that all the off-duty guards had been dragged\ndouble-time back to the prison, his doing that they were now ringed\naround the outer walls or scattered on extra-man patrols throughout the\nprison.\n\nIt was something, but O'Leary couldn't believe that it was enough.\nHe'd been in touch with half a dozen of the details inside the prison\non the intercom and each of them had reported the same thing. In all\nof E-G, not a single prisoner was asleep. They were talking back and\nforth between the cells and the guards couldn't shut them up. They\nwere listening to concealed radios and the guards didn't dare make a\nshakedown to find them. They were working themselves up to something.\nTo what?\n\nO'Leary didn't want ever to find out what. He wanted to go in there\nwith a couple of the best guards he could get his hands on--shoot his\nway into the Greensleeves if he had to--and clean out the infection.\n\nBut the warden said no.\n\nO'Leary stared balefully at the hovering helicopters.\n\nThe warden was the warden. He was placed in that position through\nthe meticulously careful operations of the Civil Service machinery,\nmaintained in that position year after year through the penetrating\nannual inquiries of the Reclassification Board. It was _subversive_ to\nthink that the Board could have made a mistake!\n\nBut O'Leary was absolutely sure that the warden was a scared,\nineffectual jerk.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe interphone was ringing again. The warden picked up the handpiece\nand held it bonelessly at arm's length, his eyes fixed glassily on the\nwall. It was Sauer from the Greensleeves again. O'Leary could hear his\nmaddened bray.\n\n\"I warned you, Warden!\" O'Leary could see the big con's contorted face\nin miniature, in the view screen of the interphone. The grin was broad\nand jolly, the snake's eyes poisonously cold. \"I'm going to give you\nfive minutes, Warden, you hear? Five minutes! And if there isn't a\nmedic in here in five minutes to take care of my boy Flock--your guards\nhave had it! I'm going to slice off an ear and throw it out the window,\nyou hear me? And five minutes later, another ear. And five minutes\nlater--\"\n\nThe warden groaned weakly. \"I've called for the prison medic, Sauer.\nHonestly I have! I'm sure he's coming as rapidly as he--\"\n\n\"Five minutes!\" And the ferociously grinning face disappeared.\n\nO'Leary leaned forward. \"Warden, let me take a squad in there!\"\n\nThe warden gazed at him for a blank moment \"Squad? No, O'Leary. What's\nthe use of a squad? It's a medic I have to get in there. I have a\nresponsibility to those guards and if I don't get a medic--\"\n\nA cold, calm voice from the door: \"I am here, Warden.\"\n\nO'Leary and the warden both jumped up.\n\nThe medic nodded slightly. \"You may sit down.\"\n\n\"Oh, Doctor! Thank heaven you're here!\" The warden was falling all over\nhimself, getting a chair for his guest, flustering about.\n\nO'Leary said sharply: \"Wait a minute, Warden. You can't let the doctor\ngo in alone!\"\n\n\"He isn't alone!\" The doctor's intern came from behind him, scowling\nbelligerently at O'Leary. Youngish, his beard pale and silky, he was a\nlong way from his first practice. \"I'm here to assist him!\"\n\nO'Leary put a strain on his patience. \"They'll eat you up in there,\nDoc! Those are the worst cons in the prison. They've got two hostages\nalready. What's the use of giving them two more?\"\n\nThe medic fixed him with his eyes. He was a tall man and he wore his\nbeard proudly. \"Guard, do you think you can prevent me from healing a\nsufferer?\" He folded his hands over his abdomen and turned to leave.\n\nThe intern stepped aside and bowed his head.\n\nO'Leary surrendered. \"All right, you can go. But I'm coming with\nyou--with a squad!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nInmate Sue-Ann Bradley cowered in her cell. The Greensleeves\nwas jumping. She had never--no, _never_, she told herself\nwretchedly--thought that it would be anything like this. She listened\nunbelievingly to the noise the released prisoners were making, smashing\nthe chairs and commodes in their cells, screaming threats at the bound\nguards.\n\nShe faced the thought with fear, and with the sorrow of a murdered\nbelief that was worse than fear. It was bad that she was in danger\nof dying right here and now, but what was even worse was that the\nprinciples that had brought her to the Jug were dying, too.\n\nWipes were _not_ the same as Civil-Service people!\n\nA bull's roar from the corridor and a shocking crash of glass--that was\nFlock, and apparently he had smashed the TV interphone.\n\n\"What in the world are they _doing_?\" Inmate Bradley sobbed to herself.\nIt was beyond comprehension. They were yelling words that made no sense\nto her, threatening punishments on the guards that she could barely\nimagine. Sauer and Flock were laborers; some of the other rioting cons\nwere clerks, mechanics--even Civil-Service or Professionals, for all\nshe could tell. But she could hardly understand any of them. Why was\nthe quiet little Chinese clerk in Cell Six setting fire to his bed?\n\nThere did seem to be a pattern, of sorts. The laborers were rocketing\nabout, breaking things at random. The mechanics were pleasurably\nsabotaging the electronic and plumbing installations. The white-collar\ncategories were finding their dubious joys in less direct ways--liking\nsetting fire to a bed. But what a mad pattern!\n\nThe more Sue-Ann saw of them, the less she understood.\n\nIt wasn't just that they _talked_ differently. She had spent endless\nhours studying the various patois of shoptalk and it had defeated her;\nbut it wasn't just that.\n\nIt was bad enough when she couldn't understand the words--as when that\ntrusty Mathias had ordered her in wipe shoptalk to mop out her cell.\nBut what was even worse was not understanding the thought behind the\nwords.\n\nSue-Ann Bradley had consecrated her young life to the belief that\nall men were created free and equal--and alike. Or alike in all the\nthings that mattered, anyhow. Alike in hopes, alike in motives, alike\nin virtues. She had turned her back on a decent Civil-Service family\nand a promising Civil-Service career to join the banned and despised\nAssociation for the Advancement of the Categoried Classes--\n\nScreams from the corridor outside.\n\nSue-Ann leaped to the door of her cell to see Sauer clutching at one\nof the guards. The guard's hands were tied, but his feet were free; he\nbroke loose from the clumsy clown with the serpent's eyes, almost fell,\nran toward Sue-Ann.\n\nThere was nowhere else to run. The guard, moaning and gasping, tripped,\nslid, caught himself and stumbled into her cell. \"Please!\" he begged.\n\"That crazy Sauer--he's going to cut my ear off! For heaven's sake,\nma'am--stop him!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSue-Ann stared at him, between terror and tears. Stop Sauer! If only\nshe could. The big redhead was lurching stiffly toward them--raging,\nbut not so angry that the water-moccasin eyes showed heat.\n\n\"Come here, you figger scum!\" he roared.\n\nThe epithet wasn't even close--the guard was Civil Service through and\nthrough--but it was like a reviving whip-sting to Sue-Ann Bradley.\n\n\"Watch your language, Mr. Sauer!\" she snapped incongruously.\n\nSauer stopped dead and blinked.\n\n\"Don't you dare hurt him!\" she warned. \"Don't you see, Mr. Sauer,\nyou're playing into their hands? They're trying to divide us. They\npit mechanic against clerk, laborer against armed forces. And you're\nhelping them! Brother Sauer, I beg--\"\n\nThe redhead spat deliberately on the floor.\n\nHe licked his lips, and grinned an amiable clown's grin, and said in\nhis cheerful, buffoon bray: \"Auntie, go verb your adjective adjective\nnoun.\"\n\nSue-Ann Bradley gasped and turned white. She had known such words\nexisted--but only theoretically. She had never expected to _hear_\nthem. And certainly she would never have believed she would hear them,\napplied to her, from the lips of a--a _laborer_.\n\nAt her knees, the guard shrieked and fell to the floor.\n\n\"Sauer! Sauer!\" A panicky bellow from the corridor; the red-haired\ngiant hesitated. \"Sauer, come on out here! There's a million guards\ncoming up the stairs. Looks like trouble!\"\n\nSauer said hoarsely to the unconscious guard: \"I'll take care of\n_you_.\" And he looked blankly at the girl, and shook his head, and\nhurried back outside to the corridor.\n\nGuards were coming, all right--not a million of them, but half a dozen\nor more. And leading them all was the medic, calm, bearded face looking\nstraight ahead, hands clasped before him, ready to heal the sick,\ncomfort the aged or bring new life into the world.\n\n\"Hold it!\" shrieked little Flock, crouched over the agonizing blister\non his abdomen, gun in hand, peering insanely down the steps. \"Hold it\nor--\"\n\n\"Shut up.\" Sauer called softly to the approaching group: \"Let only the\ndoc come up. Nobody else!\"\n\nThe intern faltered; the guards stopped dead; the medic said calmly: \"I\nmust have my intern with me.\" He glanced at the barred gate wonderingly.\n\nSauer hesitated. \"Well--all right. But no guards!\"\n\nA few yards away, Sue-Ann Bradley was stuffing the syncoped form of the\nguard into her small washroom.\n\nIt was time to take a stand. No more cowering, she told herself\ndesperately. No more waiting. She closed the door on the guard, still\nunconscious, and stood grimly before it. Him, at least, she would save\nif she could. They could get him, but only over her dead body.\n\nOr anyway, she thought with a sudden throbbing in her throat, over her\nbody.\n\n\nVI\n\nAfter O'Leary and the medic left, the warden tottered to a chair--but\nnot for long. His secretary appeared, eyes bulging. \"The governor!\" he\ngasped.\n\nWarden Schluckebier managed to say: \"Why, Governor! How good of you to\ncome--\"\n\nThe governor shook him off and held the door open for the men who\nhad come with him. There were reporters from all the news services,\nofficials from the township governments within the city-state. There\nwas an Air GI with major's leaves on his collar--\"Liaison, sir,\" he\nexplained crisply to the warden, \"just in case you have any orders for\nour men up there.\" There were nearly a dozen others.\n\nThe warden was quite overcome.\n\nThe governor rapped out: \"Warden, no criticism of you, of course, but\nI've come to take personal charge. I'm superseding you under Rule\nTwelve, Paragraph A, of the Uniform Civil Service Code. Right?\"\n\n\"Oh, _right_!\" cried the warden, incredulous with joy.\n\n\"The situation is bad--perhaps worse than you think. I'm seriously\nconcerned about the hostages those men have in there. And I had a call\nfrom Senator Bradley a short time ago--\"\n\n\"Senator Bradley?\" echoed the warden.\n\n\"Senator _Sebastian_ Bradley. One of our foremost civil servants,\" the\ngovernor said firmly. \"It so happens that his daughter is in Block O as\nan inmate.\"\n\nThe warden closed his eyes. He tried to swallow, but the throat muscles\nwere paralyzed.\n\n\"There is no question,\" the governor went on briskly, \"about the\npropriety of her being there. She was duly convicted of a felonious\nact, namely conspiracy and incitement to riot. But you see the\nposition.\"\n\nThe warden saw all too well.\n\n\"Therefore,\" said the governor. \"I intend to go in to Block O myself.\nSebastian Bradley is an old and personal friend--as well,\" he\nemphasized, \"as being a senior member of the Reclassification Board. I\nunderstand a medic is going to Block O. I shall go with him.\"\n\nThe warden managed to sit up straight. \"He's gone. I mean they already\nleft, Governor. But I assure you Miss Brad--Inmate Bradley--that is,\nthe young lady is in no danger. I have already taken precautions,\" he\nsaid, gaining confidence as he listened to himself talk. \"I--uh--I\nwas deciding on a course of action as you came in. See, Governor,\nthe guards on the walls are all armed. All they have to do is fire\na couple of rounds into the yard and then the 'copters could start\ndropping tear gas and light fragmentation bombs and--\"\n\nThe governor was already at the door. \"You will _not_,\" he said; and:\n\"Now which way did they go?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nO'Leary was in the yard and he was smelling trouble, loud and strong.\nThe first he knew that the rest of the prison had caught the riot fever\nwas when the lights flared on in Cell Block A.\n\n\"That Sodaro!\" he snarled, but there wasn't time to worry about that\nSodaro. He grabbed the rest of his guard detail and double-timed it\ntoward the New Building, leaving the medic and a couple of guards\nwalking sedately toward the Old. Block A, on the New Building's lowest\ntier, was already coming to life; a dozen yards, and Blocks B and C\nlighted up.\n\nAnd a dozen yards more and they could hear the yelling; and it wasn't\nmore than a minute before the building doors opened.\n\nThe cons had taken over three more blocks. How? O'Leary didn't take\ntime even to guess. The inmates were piling out into the yard. He took\none look at the rushing mob. Crazy! It was Wilmer Lafon leading the\nrioters, with a guard's gun and a voice screaming threats! But O'Leary\ndidn't take time to worry about an honor prisoner gone bad, either.\n\n\"Let's get out of here!\" he bellowed to the detachment, and they ran.\n\nJust plain ran. Cut and ran, scattering as they went.\n\n\"Wait!\" screamed O'Leary, but they weren't waiting. Cursing himself for\nletting them get out of hand, O'Leary salvaged two guards and headed on\nthe run for the Old Building, huge and dark, all but the topmost lights\nof Block O.\n\nThey saw the medic and his escort disappearing into the bulk of the Old\nBuilding and they saw something else. There were inmates between them\nand the Old Building! The Shops Building lay between--with a dozen more\ncell blocks over the workshops that gave it its name--and there was a\nmilling rush of activity around its entrance, next to the laundry shed--\n\nThe laundry shed.\n\nO'Leary stood stock still. Lafon leading the breakout from Block A. The\nlittle greaser who was a trusty in the Shops Building sabotaging the\nyard's tangler circuit. Sauer and Flock taking over the Greensleeves\nwith a manufactured knife and a lot of guts.\n\nDid it fit together? Was it all part of a plan?\n\nThat was something to find out--but not just then. \"Come on,\" O'Leary\ncried to the two guards, and they raced for the temporary safety of the\nmain gates.\n\nThe whole prison was up and yelling now.\n\nO'Leary could hear scattered shots from the beat guards on the\nwall--_Over their heads, over their heads!_ he prayed silently.\nAnd there were other shots that seemed to come from inside the\nwalls--guards shooting, or convicts with guards' guns, he couldn't\ntell which. The yard was full of convicts now, in bunches and clumps;\nbut none near the gate. And they seemed to have lost some of their\ndrive. They were milling around, lit by the searchlights from the wall,\nyelling and making a lot of noise ... but going nowhere in particular.\nWaiting for a leader, O'Leary thought, and wondered briefly what had\nbecome of Lafon.\n\n\"You Captain O'Leary?\" somebody demanded.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe turned and blinked. Good Lord, the governor! He was coming through\nthe gate, waving aside the gate guards, alone. \"You him?\" the governor\nrepeated. \"All right, glad I found you. I'm going into Block O with\nyou.\"\n\nO'Leary swallowed and waved inarticulately at the teeming cons. True,\nthere were none immediately near by--but there were plenty in the\nyard! Riots meant breaking things up; already the inmates had started\nto break up the machines in the laundry shed and the athletic equipment\nin the yard lockers. When they found a couple of choice breakables like\nO'Leary and the governor, they'd have a ball!\n\n\"But, Governor--\"\n\n\"But my foot! Can you get me in there or can't you?\"\n\nO'Leary gauged their chances. It wasn't more than fifty feet to the\nmain entrance to the Old Building--not at the moment guarded, since all\nthe guards were in hiding or on the walls, and not as yet being invaded\nby the inmates at large.\n\nHe said: \"You're the boss. Hold on a minute--\" The searchlights were\non the bare yard cobblestones in front of them; in a moment, the\nsearchlights danced away.\n\n\"Come on!\" cried O'Leary, and jumped for the entrance. The governor was\nwith him and a pair of the guards came stumbling after.\n\nThey made it to the Old Building.\n\nInside the entrance, they could hear the noise from outside and the\nyelling of the inmates who were still in their cells. But around them\nwas nothing but gray steel walls and the stairs going all the way up\nto Block O.\n\n\"Up!\" panted O'Leary, and they clattered up the steel steps.\n\nThey would have made it--if it hadn't been for the honor inmate, Wilmer\nLafon, who knew what he was after and had headed for the Greensleeves\nthrough the back way. In fact, they did make it--but not the way\nthey planned. \"Get out of the way!\" yelled O'Leary at Lafon and\nthe half-dozen inmates with him; and \"Go to hell!\" screamed Lafon,\ncharging; and it was a rough-and-tumble fight, and O'Leary's party lost\nit, fair and square.\n\nSo when they got to Block O, it was with the governor marching before\na convict-held gun, and with O'Leary cold unconscious, a lump from a\ngun-butt on the side of his head.\n\nAs they came up the stairs, Sauer was howling at the medic: \"You got to\nfix up my boy! He's dying and all you do is sit there!\"\n\nThe medic said patiently: \"My son, I've dressed his wound. He is under\nsedation and I must rest. There will be other casualties.\"\n\nSauer raged, but that was as far as it went. Even Sauer wouldn't attack\na medic. He would as soon strike an Attorney, or even a Director of\nFunerals. It wasn't merely that they were Professionals. Even among\nthe Professional class, they were special; not superior, exactly, but\n_apart_. They certainly were not for the likes of Sauer to fool with\nand Sauer knew it.\n\n\"Somebody's coming!\" bawled one of the other freed inmates.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSauer jumped to the head of the steps, saw that Lafon was leading the\ngroup, stepped back, saw whom Lafon's helpers were carrying and leaped\nforward again.\n\n\"Cap'n O'Leary!\" he roared. \"Gimme!\"\n\n\"Shut up,\" said Wilmer Lafon, and pushed the big redhead out of the\nway. Sauer's jaw dropped and the snake eyes opened wide.\n\n\"Wilmer,\" he protested feebly. But that was all the protest he made,\nbecause the snake's eyes had seen that Lafon held a gun. He stood back,\nthe big hands half outstretched toward the unconscious guard captain,\nO'Leary, and the cold eyes became thoughtful.\n\nAnd then he saw who else was with the party. \"Wilmer! You got the\ngovernor there!\"\n\nLafon nodded. \"Throw them in a cell,\" he ordered, and sat down on a\nguard's stool, breathing hard. It had been a fine fight on the steps,\nbefore he and his boys had subdued the governor and the guards, but\nWilmer Lafon wasn't used to fighting. Even six years in the Jug hadn't\nturned an architect into a laborer; physical exertion simply was not\nhis metier.\n\nSauer said coaxingly: \"Wilmer, won't you leave me have O'Leary for a\nwhile? If it wasn't for me and Flock, you'd still be in A Block and--\"\n\n\"Shut up,\" Lafon said again, gently enough, but he waved the gun\nmuzzle. He drew a deep breath, glanced around him and grinned. \"If\nit wasn't for you and Flock,\" he mimicked. \"If it wasn't for you and\nFlock! Sauer, you wipe clown, do you think it took _brains_ to file\ndown a shiv and start things rolling? If it wasn't for _me_, you and\nFlock would have beaten up a few guards, and had your kicks for half an\nhour, and then the whole prison would fall in on you! It was me, Wilmer\nLafon, who set things up and you know it!\"\n\nHe was yelling and suddenly he realized he was yelling. And what was\nthe use, he demanded of himself contemptuously, of trying to argue\nwith a bunch of lousy wipes and greasers? They'd never understand the\nlong, soul-killing hours of planning and sweat. They wouldn't realize\nthe importance of the careful timing--of arranging that the laundry\ncons would start a disturbance in the yard right after the Greensleeves\nhard-timers kicked off the riot, of getting the little greaser Hiroko\nto short-circuit the yard field so the laundry cons could start their\ndisturbances.\n\nIt took a _Professional_ to organize and plan--yes, and to make sure\nthat he himself was out of it until everything was ripe, so that if\nanything went wrong, _he_ was all right. It took somebody like Wilmer\nLafon--a _Professional_, who had spent six years too long in the Jug--\n\nAnd who would shortly be getting out.\n\n\nVII\n\nAny prison is a ticking bomb. Estates-General was in process of going\noff.\n\nFrom the Greensleeves, where the trouble had started, clear out to the\ntrusty farms that ringed the walls, every inmate was up and jumping.\nSome were still in their cells--the scared ones, the decrepit oldsters,\nthe short-termers who didn't dare risk their early discharge. But for\nevery man in his cell, a dozen were out and yelling.\n\nA torch, licking as high as the hanging helicopters, blazing up from\nthe yard--that was the laundry shed. Why burn the laundry? The cons\ncouldn't have said. It was burnable and it was there--burn it!\n\nThe yard lay open to the wrath of the helicopters, but the helicopters\nmade no move. The cobblestones were solidly covered with milling men.\nThe guards were on the walls, sighting down their guns; the helicopter\nbombardiers had their fingers on the bomb trips. There had been a few\nrounds fired over the heads of the rioters, at first.\n\nNothing since.\n\nIn the milling mob, the figures clustered in groups. The inmates from\nHonor Block A huddled under the guards' guns at the angle of the wall.\nThey had clubs--all the inmates had clubs--but they weren't using them.\n\nHonor Block A: On the outside, Civil Service and Professionals. On the\ninside, the trusties, the \"good\" cons.\n\nThey weren't the type for clubs.\n\nWith all of the inmates, you looked at them and you wondered what\ntwisted devil had got into their heads to land them in the Jug. Oh,\nperhaps you could understand it--a little bit, at least--in the\ncase of the figgers in Blocks B and C, the greasers in the Shop\nBuilding--that sort. It was easy enough for some of the Categoried\nClasses to commit a crime and thereby land in jail.\n\nWho could blame a wipe for trying to \"pass\" if he thought he could\nget away with it? But when he didn't get away with it, he wound up in\nthe Jug and that was logical enough. And greasers liked Civil-Service\nwomen--everyone knew that.\n\nThere was almost a sort of logic to it, even if it was a sort of\ninevitable logic that made decent Civil-Service people see red. You\n_had_ to enforce the laws against rape if, for instance, a greaser\nshould ask an innocent young female postal clerk for a date. But you\ncould understand what drove him to it. The Jug was full of criminals of\nthat sort. And the Jug was the place for them.\n\nBut what about Honor Block A?\n\nWhy would a Wilmer Lafon--a certified public architect, a Professional\nby category--do his own car repairs and get himself jugged for\nmalpractice? Why would a dental nurse sneak back into the laboratory at\nnight and cast an upper plate for her mother? She must have realized\nshe would be caught.\n\nBut she had done it. And she had been caught; and there she was, this\nwild night, huddled under the helicopters, uncertainly waving the\nhandle of a floor mop. It was a club.\n\nShe shivered and turned to the stocky convict next to her. \"Why don't\nthey break down the gate?\" she demanded. \"How long are we going to hang\naround here, waiting for the guards to get organized and pick us all\noff one at a time?\"\n\nThe convict next to her sighed and wiped his glasses with a beefy hand.\nOnce he had been an Income-Tax Accountant, disbarred and convicted on\nthree counts of impersonating an attorney when he took the liberty of\nmaking changes in a client's lease. He snorted: \"They expect us to do\n_their_ dirty work.\"\n\nThe two of them glared angrily and fearfully at the other convicts in\nthe yard.\n\nAnd the other convicts, huddled greaser with greaser, wipe with wipe,\nglared ragingly back. It wasn't _their_ place to plan the strategy of a\nprison break.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCaptain Liam O'Leary muttered groggily: \"They don't want to escape. All\nthey want is to make trouble. I know cons!\"\n\nHe came fully awake and sat up and focused his eyes. His head was\nhammering.\n\nThat girl, that Bradley, was leaning over him. She looked scared and\nsick. \"Sit still! Sauer is just plain crazy--listen to them yelling out\nthere!\"\n\nO'Leary sat up and looked around, one hand holding his drumming skull.\n\n\"They _do_ want to escape,\" said Sue-Ann Bradley. \"Listen to what\nthey're saying!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nO'Leary discovered that he was in a cell. There was a battle going on\noutside. Men were yelling, but he couldn't see them.\n\nHe jumped up, remembering. \"The governor!\"\n\nSue-Ann Bradley said: \"He's all right. I _think_ he is, anyway. He's in\nthe cell right next to us, with a couple guards. I guess they came up\nwith you.\" She shivered as the yells in the corridor rose. \"Sauer is\nangry at the medic,\" she explained. \"He wants him to fix Flock up so\nthey can--'crush out,' I think he said. The medic says he can't do it.\nYou see, Flock got burned pretty badly with a knife he made. Something\nabout the tanglefoot field--\"\n\n\"Eddy currents,\" said O'Leary dizzily.\n\n\"Anyway, the medic--\"\n\n\"Never mind the medic. What's Lafon doing?\"\n\n\"Lafon? The Negro?\" Sue-Ann Bradley frowned. \"I didn't know his name.\nHe started the whole thing, the way it sounds. They're waiting for\nthe mob down in the yard to break out and then they're going to make a\nbreak--\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" growled O'Leary. His head was beginning to clear.\n\"What about you? Are you in on this?\"\n\nShe hung between laughter and tears. Finally: \"Do I _look_ as if I am?\"\n\nO'Leary took stock. Somehow, somewhere, the girl had got a length of\nmetal pipe--from the plumbing, maybe. She was holding it in one hand,\nsupporting him with the other. There were two other guards in the cell,\nboth out cold--one from O'Leary's squad, the other, O'Leary guessed, a\ndesk guard who had been on duty when the trouble started.\n\n\"I wouldn't let them in,\" she said wildly. \"I told them they'd have to\nkill me before they could touch that guard.\"\n\nO'Leary said suspiciously: \"You belonged to that Double-A-C, didn't\nyou? You were pretty anxious to get in the Greensleeves, disobeying\nAuntie Mathias's orders. Are you sure you didn't know this was going\nto--\"\n\nIt was too much. She dropped the pipe, buried her head in her hands. He\ncouldn't tell if she laughed or wept, but he could tell that it hadn't\nbeen like that at all.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" he said awkwardly, and touched her helplessly on the\nshoulder.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe turned and looked out the little barred window, because he couldn't\nthink of any additional way to apologize. He heard the wavering beat\nin the air and saw them--bobbing a hundred yards up, their wide\nmetal vanes fluttering and hissing from the jets at the tips. The GI\n'copters. Waiting--as everyone seemed to be waiting.\n\nSue-Ann Bradley asked shakily: \"Is anything the matter?\"\n\nO'Leary turned away. It was astonishing, he thought, what a different\nperspective he had on those helicopter bombers from inside Block O.\nOnce he had cursed the warden for not ordering at least tear gas to be\ndropped.\n\nHe said harshly: \"Nothing. Just that the 'copters have the place\nsurrounded.\"\n\n\"Does it make any difference?\"\n\nHe shrugged. Does it make a difference? The difference between trouble\nand tragedy, or so it now seemed to Captain O'Leary. The riot was\ntrouble. They could handle it, one way or another. It was his job, any\nguard's job, to handle _prison_ trouble.\n\nBut to bring the GIs into it was to invite race riot. Not prison\nriot--race riot. Even the declassed scum in the Jug would fight back\nagainst the GIs. They were used to having the Civil-Service guards over\nthem--that was what guards were for. Civil-Service guards guarded.\nWhat else? It was their job--as clerking was a rigger's job, and\nmachines were a greaser's, and pick-and-shovel strong-arm work was a\nwipe's.\n\nBut the Armed Services--their job was to defend the country against\nforces outside--in a world that had only inside forces. The cons\nwouldn't hold still under attack from the GIs. _Race riot!_\n\nBut how could you tell that to a girl like this Bradley? O'Leary\nglanced at her covertly. She _looked_ all right. Rather nice-looking,\nif anything. But he hadn't forgotten why she was in E-G. Joining a\nterrorist organization, the Association for the Advancement of the\nCategoried Classes.\n\nActually getting up on street corners and proposing that greasers'\nchildren be allowed to go to school with GIs, that wipes inter-marry\nwith Civil Service. Good Lord, they'd be suggesting that doctors eat\nwith laymen next!\n\nThe girl said evenly: \"Don't look at me that way. I'm not a monster.\"\n\nO'Leary coughed. \"Sorry. I didn't know I was staring.\" She looked at\nhim with cold eyes. \"I mean,\" he said, \"you don't _look_ like anybody\nwho'd get mixed up in--well, miscegenation.\"\n\n\"Miscegenation!\" she blazed. \"You're all alike! You talk about the\nmission of the Categoried Classes and the rightness of segregation,\nbut it's always just the one thing that's in your minds--sex! I'll tell\nyou this, Captain O'Leary--I'd rather many a decent, hard-working clerk\nany day than the sort of Civil-Service trash I've seen around here!\"\n\nO'Leary cringed. He couldn't help it. Funny, he told himself, I thought\nI was shockproof--but this goes too far!\n\nA bull-roar from the corridor. Sauer.\n\nO'Leary spun. The big redhead was yelling: \"Bring the governor out\nhere. Lafon wants to talk to him!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nO'Leary went to the door of the cell, fast.\n\nA slim, pale con from Block A was pushing the governor down the hall,\ntoward Sauer and Lafon. The governor was a strong man, but he didn't\nstruggle. His face was as composed and remote as the medic's; if he was\nafraid, he concealed it extremely well.\n\nSue-Ann Bradley stood beside O'Leary. \"What's happening?\"\n\nHe kept his eyes on what was going on. \"Lafon is going to try to use\nthe governor as a shield, I think.\" The voice of Lafon was loud, but\nthe noises outside made it hard to understand. But O'Leary could make\nout what the dark ex-Professional was saying: \"--know damn well you\ndid something. But what? _Why don't they crush out?_\"\n\nMumble-mumble from the Governor. O'Leary couldn't hear the words.\n\nBut he could see the effect of them in Lafon's face, hear the rage\nin Lafon's voice. \"Don't call me a liar, you civvy punk! You did\nsomething. I had it all planned, do you hear me? The laundry boys were\ngoing to rush the gate, the Block A bunch would follow--and then I\nwas going to breeze right through. But you loused it up somehow. You\nmust've!\"\n\nHis voice was rising to a scream. O'Leary, watching tautly from the\ncell, thought: He's going to break. He can't hold it in much longer.\n\n\"All _right_!\" shouted Lafon, and even Sauer, looming behind him,\nlooked alarmed. \"It doesn't matter what you did. I've got you now and\n_you_ are going to get me out of here. You hear? I've got this gun and\nthe two of us are going to walk right out, through the gate, and if\nanybody tries to stop us--\"\n\n\"Hey,\" said Sauer, waking up.\n\n\"--if anybody tries to stop us, you'll get a bullet right in--\"\n\n\"_Hey!_\" Sauer was roaring loud as Lafon himself now. \"What's this talk\nabout the _two_ of you? You aren't going to leave me and Flock!\"\n\n\"Shut up,\" Lafon said conversationally, without taking his eyes off the\ngovernor.\n\nBut Sauer, just then, was not the man to say \"shut up\" to, and\nespecially he was not a man to take your eyes away from.\n\n\"That's torn it,\" O'Leary said aloud. The girl started to say something.\n\nBut he was no longer there to hear.\n\nIt looked very much as though Sauer and Lafon were going to tangle. And\nwhen they did, it was the end of the line for the governor.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCaptain O'Leary hurtled out of the sheltering cell and skidded down the\ncorridor. Lafon's face was a hawk's face, gleaming with triumph. As he\nsaw O'Leary coming toward him, the hawk sneer froze. He brought the gun\nup, but O'Leary was a fast man.\n\nO'Leary leaped on the lithe black honor prisoner. Lafon screamed and\nclutched; and O'Leary's lunging weight drove him back against the wall.\nLafon's arm smacked against the steel grating and the gun went flying.\nThe two of them clinched and fell, gouging, to the floor.\n\nGrabbing the advantage, O'Leary hammered the con's head against the\ndeck, hard enough to split a skull. And perhaps it split Lafon's,\nbecause the dark face twitched and froth appeared at the lips; and the\nbody slacked.\n\nOne down!\n\nNow Sauer was charging. O'Leary wriggled sidewise and the big redhead\nblundered crashing into the steel grate. Sauer fell and O'Leary caught\nat him. He tried hammering the head as he swarmed on top of the huge\nclown. But Sauer only roared the louder. The bull body surged under\nO'Leary and then Sauer was on top and O'Leary wasn't breathing. Not at\nall.\n\nGood-by, Sue-Ann, O'Leary said silently, without meaning to say\nanything of the kind; and even then he wondered why he was saying it.\n\nO'Leary heard a gun explode beside his head.\n\nAmazing, he thought, I'm breathing again! The choking hands were gone\nfrom his throat.\n\nIt took him a moment to realize that it was Sauer who had taken the\nbullet, not him. Sauer who now lay dead, not O'Leary. But he realized\nit when he rolled over, and looked up, and saw the girl with the gun\nstill in her hand, staring at him and weeping.\n\nHe sat up. The two guards still able to walk were backing Sue-Ann\nBradley up. The governor was looking proud as an eagle, pleased as a\nmother hen.\n\nThe Greensleeves was back in the hands of law and order.\n\nThe medic came toward O'Leary, hands folded. \"My son,\" he said, \"if\nyour throat needs--\"\n\nO'Leary interrupted him. \"I don't need a thing, Doc! I've got\neverything I want right now.\"\n\n\nVIII\n\nInmate Sue-Ann Bradley cried: \"They're coming! O'Leary, they're coming!\"\n\nThe guards who had once been hostages clattered down the steps to\nmeet the party. The cons from the Greensleeves were back in their\ncells. The medic, after finishing his chores on O'Leary himself, paced\nmeditatively out into the wake of the riot, where there was plenty to\nkeep him busy. A faintly guilty expression tinctured his carven face.\nContrary to his oath to care for all humanity in anguish, he had not\nliked Lafon or Sauer.\n\nThe party of fresh guards appeared and efficiently began re-locking the\ncells of the Greensleeves.\n\n\"Excuse me, Cap'n,\" said one, taking Sue-Ann Bradley by the arm. \"I'll\njust put this one back--\"\n\n\"I'll take care of her,\" said Liam O'Leary. He looked at her sideways\nas he rubbed the bruises on his face.\n\nThe governor tapped him on the shoulder. \"Come along,\" he said, looking\nso proud of himself, so pleased. \"Let's go out in the yard for a\nbreath of fresh air.\" He smiled contentedly at Sue-Ann Bradley. \"You,\ntoo.\"\n\nO'Leary protested instinctively: \"But she's an inmate!\"\n\n\"And I'm a governor. Come along.\"\n\nThey walked out into the yard. The air was fresh, all right. A handful\nof cons, double-guarded by sleepy and irritable men from the day shift,\nwere hosing down the rubble on the cobblestones. The yard was a mess,\nbut it was quiet now. The helicopters were still riding their picket\nline, glowing softly in the early light that promised sunrise.\n\n\"My car,\" the governor said quietly to a state policeman who appeared\nfrom nowhere. The trooper snapped a salute and trotted away.\n\n\"I killed a man,\" said Sue-Ann Bradley, looking a little ill.\n\n\"You saved a man,\" corrected the governor. \"Don't weep for that Lafon.\nHe was willing to kill a thousand men if he had to, to break out of\nhere.\"\n\n\"But he never did break out,\" said Sue-Ann.\n\nThe governor stretched contentedly. \"He never had a chance. Laborers\nand clerks join together in a breakout? It would never happen. They\ndon't even speak the same language--as you have discovered, my dear.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSue-Ann blazed: \"I still believe in the equality of Man!\"\n\n\"Oh, please do,\" the governor said, straight-faced. \"There's nothing\nwrong with that. Your father and I are perfectly willing to admit that\nmen are equal--but we can't admit that all men are the _same_. Use your\neyes! What you believe in is your business, but,\" he added, \"when your\nbeliefs extend to setting fire to segregated public lavatories as a\nprotest move, which is what got you arrested, you apparently need to be\ntaught a lesson. Well, perhaps you've learned it. You were a help here\ntonight and that counts for a lot.\"\n\nCaptain O'Leary said, face furrowed: \"What about the warden, Governor?\nThey say the category system is what makes the world go round; it fits\nthe right man to the right job and keeps him there. But look at Warden\nSchluckebier! He fell completely apart at the seams. He--\"\n\n\"Turn that statement around, O'Leary.\"\n\n\"Turn--?\"\n\nThe governor nodded. \"You've got it reversed. Not the right man for the\njob--the right job for the man! We've got Schluckebier on our hands,\nsee? He's been born; it's too late to do anything about that. He will\ngo to pieces in an emergency. So where do we put him?\"\n\nO'Leary stubbornly clamped his jaw, frowning.\n\n\"We put him,\" the governor went on gently, \"where the best thing\nto _do_ in a crisis is to go to pieces! Why, O'Leary, you get some\nhot-headed man of action in here, and every time an inmate sneezes,\nyou'll have bloodshed! And there's no harm in a prison riot. Let the\npoor devils work off steam. I wouldn't have bothered to get out of bed\nfor it--except I was worried about the hostages. So I came down to make\nsure they were protected in the best possible way.\"\n\nO'Leary's jaw dropped. \"But you were--\"\n\nThe governor nodded. \"I was a hostage myself. That's one way to protect\nthem, isn't it? By giving the cons a hostage that's worth more to them.\"\n\nHe yawned and looked around for his car. \"So the world keeps going\naround,\" he said. \"Everybody is somebody else's outgroup and maybe it's\na bad thing, but did you ever stop to realize that we don't have wars\nany more? The categories stick tightly together. Who is to say that\nthat's a bad thing?\"\n\nHe grinned. \"Reminds me of a story, if you two will pay attention to\nme long enough to listen. There was a meeting--this is an old, _old_\nstory--a neighborhood meeting of the leaders of the two biggest\nwomen's groups on the block. There were eighteen Irish ladies from\nthe Church Auxiliary and three Jewish ladies from B'nai B'rith. The\nfirst thing they did was have an election for a temporary chairwoman.\nTwenty-one votes were cast. Mrs. Grossinger from B'nai B'rith got three\nand Mrs. O'Flaherty from the Auxiliary got eighteen. So when Mrs.\nMurphy came up to congratulate Mrs. O'Flaherty after the election, she\nwhispered: 'Good for you! But isn't it terrible, the way these Jews\nstick together?'\"\n\nHe stood up and waved a signal as his long official car came poking\nhesitantly through the gate.\n\n\"Well,\" he declared professionally, \"that's that. As we politicians\nsay, any questions?\"\n\nSue-Ann hesitated. \"Yes, I guess I do have a question,\" she said.\n\"What's a Jew?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was full dawn at last. The recall signal had come and the\nhelicopters were swooping home to Hap Arnold Field.\n\nA bombardier named Novak, red-eyed and grumpy, was amusing himself\non the homeward flight by taking practice sights on the stream of\nwork-bound mechanics as they fluttered over Greaserville.\n\n\"Could pick 'em off like pigeons,\" he said sourly to his pilot, as he\ndropped an imaginary bomb on a cluster of a dozen men. \"For two cents,\nI'd do it, too. The only good greaser is a dead greaser.\"\n\nHis pilot, just as weary, said loftily: \"Leave them alone. The best way\nto handle them is to leave them alone.\"\n\nAnd the pilot was perfectly right; and that was the way the world went\nround, spinning slowly and unstoppably toward the dawn.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of My Lady Greensleeves, by Frederik Pohl\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MY LADY GREENSLEEVES ***\n\n***** This file should be named 51310.txt or 51310.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/1/3/1/51310/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\nwww.gutenberg.org\n\n\n\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Newby\n    Chief Executive and Director\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
