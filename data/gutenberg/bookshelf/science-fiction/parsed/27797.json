He sent in the haymaker.]\n\n\n    _Frankie was ready for the big test--Ten-Time Winner of the world\n    title. He was young and fit and able; also, he had Milt's cunning\n    brain to direct every feint and punch. This left only one thing in\n    doubt, the----_\n\n\nVITAL INGREDIENT\n\nBy GERALD VANCE\n\n\n\"Champ, what's with ya lately?\" Benny asked the question as they lay on\nthe beach.\n\n\"Nothing,\" Frankie answered. \"Just fight-nite miseries, I guess.\"\n\n\"No it ain't, Frankie. It's something else. You losin' confidence in\nMilt? That it? Can't you hold it one more time? You guys only need\ntonite and you got it. One more to make Ten-Time Defenders--the first\nin the game, Frankie.\"\n\n\"We won the last two on points, Benny. Points--and I'm better than that.\nI keep waiting, and waiting, for my heels to set; for Milt to send it up\nmy legs and back and let fly. But he won't do it, Benny.\"\n\n\"Look, Champ, Milt knows what he's doing. He's sending you right. You\nthink maybe you know as much as Milt?\"\n\n\"Maybe I just do, Benny. Maybe I do.\"\n\nBenny didn't have the answer to this heresy. By law this was Frankie's\nlast fight--as a fighter. If he won this one and became a Ten-Time\nDefender he would have his pick of the youngsters at the Boxing College,\njust as Milt had chosen him fifteen years before. For fifteen years he'd\nnever thrown a punch of his own in a fight ring.\n\nMaybe because it was his last fight in the ring he felt the way he did\ntoday. He understood, of course, why fighters were mentally controlled\nby proved veterans. By the time a fighter had any real experience and\nknow-how in the old days, his body was shot. Now the best bodies and\nthe best brains were teamed by mental control.\n\nBenny had an answer now. \"Champ, I think it's a good thing this is your\nlast fight. You know too much. After this one you'll have a good strong\nboy of your own and you can try some of this stuff you've been learning.\nMilt knows you're no kid anymore. That's why he has to be careful with\nyou.\"\n\n\"I still have it, Benny. My speed, my punch, my timing--all good. There\nwere a dozen times in those last two fights I could have crossed a right\nand gone home early.\"\n\n\"Two times, Frankie. Just two times. And them late in the fight. Milt\ndidn't think you had it, and I don't think you did either.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMilt, Frankie's master control, came down to the beach and strolled over\nto join them. Milt had been a Five-Time Defender in the Welter division\nbefore his fights ran out. Now he was skinny and sixty. His was the mind\nthat had directed every punch Frankie had ever thrown.\n\nHe studied the figure of Frankie lying on the sand. The\ntwo-hundred-pound fighting machine was thirty years old. Milt winced\nwhen he compared it to that of the twenty-two-year-old slugger they\nwould have to meet in a few hours.\n\nBenny said \"Hi,\" and ambled off.\n\n\"Well, boy, this one means a lot to both of us,\" Milt said.\n\n\"Sure,\" was all Frankie could answer.\n\n\"For you, the first Ten-Time Defender the heavyweight division has ever\nproduced. For me, The Hall of Boxing Fame.\"\n\n\"You want that pretty bad, don't you, Milt?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I guess I do, Frankie, but not bad enough to win it the wrong\nway.\"\n\nFrankie's head jerked up. \"What do you mean, the wrong way?\"\n\nMilt scowled and looked as though he wished he hadn't said that. He\nturned his head and stared hard at his fighter. \"There's something we\nmaybe ought to have talked about, Frankie.\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\nMilt struggled for words. \"It's just--oh, hell! Forget it. Just forget I\nsaid anything.\"\n\n\"You figure we win tonight?\"\n\n\"I think maybe we will.\"\n\n\"You don't seem very sure. On points, huh?\"\n\n\"Yeah, maybe on points.\" Milt turned his eyes back on Frankie's eager\nface. \"Frankie, boy--there's something about being a Ten-Time Defender\nthat's, well--different.\"\n\nMilt took a deep breath and was evidently ready to tell Frankie exactly\nwhat he meant. But Frankie broke in, his voice low and tense. \"Milt--\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"When I get in there tonight--turn me loose!\"\n\nMilt was startled at the words. \"Release _control_?\"\n\n\"Yeah--sure. I think I can take Nappy Gordon on my own!\"\n\n\"Nappy can stick his fist through a brick wall--all night long. And Pop\nMonroe knows all there is to know and some he makes up himself. They'd\nbe a tough pair to beat. Our big ace is that they have to beat us. We\n_got_ the Nine-Times.\"\n\n\"I can take him, Milt!\"\n\nThere was a strange light in Milt's eyes. He did not speak and Frankie\nwent on. \"Just one round, Milt! If I slip you can grab control again.\"\n\n\"You just want a try at it, huh?\"\n\nThere seemed to be disappointment in Milt's voice; something Frankie\ncouldn't understand. Milt seemed suddenly nervous, ill-at-ease. But\nFrankie was too eager to give it much attention. \"How about it,\nMilt--huh?\"\n\nMilt had been squatting on the sand. He got to his feet and looked out\nacross the water. \"All right. Maybe we'll try it.\"\n\nHe seemed sad as he walked away. Frankie, occupied with his own elation,\ndidn't notice ...\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the studio dressing room, a few hours later Milt and Frankie were\nwarming up. Frankie in the practice ring and Milt perched on a high\nchair just outside the ropes.\n\nEverything was just as it would be in the fight. Three minutes work, one\nminute rest. Frankie noticed how slowly and carefully Milt was working\nhim, and how he watched the clock.\n\nFrankie had nothing to do now but watch, as a spectator would; watch as\nMilt moved him around. Milt could control every muscle, every move and\nevery reflex of his body. It had taken them five years to perfect this\nroutine. That was the training period at the College of Boxing, and was\nprescribed by law.\n\nIn their first fight they had been at their peak. Frankie was Milt's\nsecond boy and Milt knew boxing as only a Champion Welter with thirty\nyears of experience could know it. For fifteen years he had watched and\nstudied while a good veteran had directed his body. And for another\nfifteen years he had been the guiding brain to a fine Middleweight.\n\nAs a Welterweight, Milt had learned to depend on speed and quick hands.\nIn Frankie he had found the dream of every Welter--a punch. Frankie's\nbody could really deliver the power. At first, it had been the heavy\nhitting that had won the fights; lately, Milt had relied more and more\non the speed and deception he had developed in Frankie.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFrankie felt the control ease out and knew the warm-up was over. He\nslipped on his robe and he and Milt went to join the others in the TV\nstudio.\n\nThere would be no crowd. Just the cameras, the crews and officials. The\nfight would be televised in 3-D and filmed in slow motion. If a decision\nwere needed to determine the winner, it would be given only after a\ncareful study had been made of the films.\n\nThere was little to be done in the studio and Milt had timed Frankie's\nwarm-up right to the minute. The fighters and their controllers took\ntheir positions: the controllers seated in high chairs on opposite sides\nof the ring; the fighters in opposite corners.\n\nAs the warning buzzer sounded, Frankie felt Milt take control. This one\nhe would watch closely.\n\nAt the bell Frankie rose and moved out slowly. He noticed how relaxed,\nalmost limp, Milt was keeping him. There was only a little more effort\nused than in the pre-fight warm-up. His left hand had extra speed but\nonly enough power to command respect. The pattern was just about as he\nhad expected. As the fight went along the left would add up the points.\nBut his thoughts were centered on a single question. _How is it going to\nbe on my own?_\n\nIn the early rounds he was amazed at the extreme caution Milt was\nemploying. Nappy Gordon's face was beginning to redden from the\ncontinual massage of Frankie's brisk left and occasional right. But\nFrankie felt that his own face must be getting flushed with eagerness.\nThe glory of going in and trying to do it by himself; of beating Pop\nMonroe without Milt's help. He wondered if Milt would have to clamp on\nthe controls again. He sure hoped not. But there wasn't anything to\nreally worry about. Milt could beat Pop Monroe and he wouldn't let\nFrankie take a beating by himself.\n\nFrankie's attention was caught by some odd thoughts in Milt's mind. Milt\ndidn't seem to be sending them, yet they were clear and direct: _You\nreally think you've got it, boy? That vital ingredient?_\n\n_What you talking about?_\n\n_Huh? Me? Oh, nothing. Take it easy._ But Milt's thoughts were troubled.\n\n_When you going to let me go?_\n\n_I said, take it easy. We'll see._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe sixth round came and Frankie felt no weariness. Milt was working him\nlike he was made of fragile glass. Nor was Nappy tiring so far as he\ncould notice. Pop Monroe was trying for just one solid blow to slow down\nthe Champ. So far nothing even jarring had come close to landing.\n\nIn the seventh Frankie noticed a little desperation in Monroe's tactics.\nTo win now Monroe and Gordon needed a knockout. Frankie had only to\nstay on his feet to be home safe. But when was Milt going to let him go?\nMilt had turned in a masterpiece of defensive fighting. The left had\ndeadly accuracy and now the openings were truck-sized as Monroe had come\nto ignore the light tattoo of the Champ's punches.\n\nMilt withdrew the control in the middle of the seventh round. It hit\nFrankie like a dash of cold water, the exultation of being on his own!\nHe looked over at Milt, perched rope-high in his control chair at\nringside. Milt was looking at him, his face tight and grim; almost\nhostile.\n\nFrankie circled warily, a touch of panic coming unbidden. What to do? He\nhadn't known it would be quite like this. He tried to remember how it\nwas--how it felt to move in the various ways Milt always sent him. Funny\nhow you could forget such things. The left hook--that jab--how did they\ngo?\n\nA pile driver came from somewhere and almost tore his head off his\nshoulders ...\n\nHe was looking up at the ceiling. He rolled his eyes and saw Pop\nMonroe's face--smiling a little, but also puzzled. Even with his brain\ngroggy, Frankie knew why. He'd stepped wide open in Nappy's looping\nright and Pop couldn't figure Milt doing a thing like that.\n\nPop looked over at Milt. Frankie followed Pop's eyes and saw the look\nMilt returned. Then the spark of understanding that passed between them.\nOdd, Frankie thought. What understanding could there be?\n\nHe was aware of the word seven filling the studio as the loud speaker\nblared the count. He was up at nine.\n\nNappy swarmed in now. Frankie felt the pain of hard, solid blows on his\nbody as he tried to tie up this dynamo Poppy Monroe was releasing on\nhim. He couldn't stop it, dodge it, or hide from it.\n\nBut he finally got away from it--staggering. Nappy came at him fast and\nthe left jab Frankie sent out to put him off balance didn't even slow\nthe fury a bit. Frankie took to the ropes to make Nappy shorten his\npunches. It helped some, but not enough. No man could take the jolting\neffect of those ripping punches and keep his feet under him. Frankie\ndidn't--he was down when the bell ended round nine.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn his corner the seconds worked quickly. He looked at Milt and saw a\ndead-pan expression. Milt wasn't sending him anything. Punishing him of\ncourse. Frankie took it meekly; ashamed of himself. Milt would take over\nagain when the bell sounded. Frankie knew that he couldn't stay away\nfrom Nappy for another round. Nobody could. Monroe smelled a knockout\nand Frankie was never fast enough to run away from the burst of\nviciousness that would come at him in the form of Nappy Gordon. No, Milt\nwould take over.\n\nAt the bell, Frankie moved out fast, waiting for the familiar feel of\nMilt expertly manipulating his arms and legs and body; sending out the\njabs and punches; weaving him in and out.\n\nBut Milt didn't take over and Pop sent Nappy in with a pile-driver right\nthat smashed Frankie to the floor. Frankie rolled over on his knees and\nshook his head groggily, trying to understand. Why hadn't Milt taken\nover? What was Milt trying to do to him?\n\nMilt's cold face waved into focus before Frankie's blinking eyes. _What\nwas Milt trying to do?_ Frankie heard the tolling count--six, seven,\neight. Milt wasn't even going to help him up. Sick and bewildered,\nFrankie struggled to his feet. Nappy came driving in. Frankie\nback-pedalled and took the vicious right cross while rolling away. Thus\nhe avoided being knocked out and was only floored for another\neight-count.\n\n_Milt--Milt--for God's sake--_\n\nThe round was over. Frankie staggered, sick, to his corner and slumped\ndown. The handlers worked over him. He looked at Milt. But Milt neither\nsent nor returned his gaze. Milt sat looking grimly off into space and\nseemed older and wearier than time itself.\n\nThen Frankie knew. Milt had sold him out!\n\nThe shocking truth stunned him even more than Nappy's punches. Milt had\nsold him out! There had been rare cases of such things. When money meant\nmore than honor to a veteran. But Milt!\n\nNumbed, Frankie pondered the ghastly thought. After all, Milt was old.\nOld men needed money for their later years. But how could he? How could\nhe do it?\n\nSuddenly Frankie hated. He hated Nappy and Pop and every one of the\nmillions of people looking silently on around the world. But most of\nall, he hated Milt. It was a weird, sickening thing, that hatred. But\nonly a mentally sickening thing. Physically, it seemed to make Frankie\nstronger, because when the bell rang and he got up and walked into a\nstraight right, it didn't hurt at all.\n\nHe realized he was on the floor; the gong was sounding; he was getting\nup, moving in again. There was blood, a ringing in his head.\n\nBut above all, a rage to kill. To kill.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe remembered going down several times and getting up. Not caring how he\nhad swung under Milt's control--only wanting to use his fists--to kill\nthe thing weaving in front of him.\n\nNappy. A grinning, weaving, lethal ghost.\n\nHe felt a pain in his right fist and saw Nappy go down. He saw Pop's\nface go gray as though the old man himself had felt the force of the\nblow. Saw Nappy climb erect slowly. He grinned through blood.\nFrankie--ghost-catcher. He had to get him.\n\nHe was happy; happy with a new fierceness he had never before known. The\nlust of battle was strong within him and when Pop weaved Nappy\ndesperately, Frankie laughed, waited, measured Nappy.\n\nAnd smashed him down with a single jarring right.\n\nThe bell tolled ten. Pop got wearily off his stool and walked away.\nFrankie strode grimly to his corner, ignored Milt, moved on into the\ndressing room.\n\nHe knew Milt would come and he waited for him, sitting there coldly on\nthe edge of the table. Milt walked in the door and stood quietly.\n\n\"You sold me out,\" Frankie said.\n\nThere was open pride in Milt's eyes. \"Sure--you had to think that.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, think? You didn't pick me up when Pop flattened me. I\nsaw the look between you and Pop.\"\n\n\"Sure.\" Milt's eyes were still proud. \"You had to know. That's how I\nwanted it.\"\n\n\"Milt--why did you do it?\"\n\n\"I didn't do it. I just had to make you think I did.\"\n\n\"In God's name--why?\"\n\n\"Because I'm sentimental, maybe, but I've always had my own ideas about\nthe kind of fighter who should be a Ten-Time winner. All my life I've\nkept remembering the old greats--Dempsey, Sullivan, Corbett--the men who\ndid it on their own, and I wanted you to get it right--on your own--like\na real champion.\"\n\nFrankie was confused. \"I wanted to go on my own. Why didn't you tell me\nthen?\"\n\n\"Then you'd have lost. You'd have gone down whimpering and moaning. You\nsee, Frankie, all those old fighters had a vital ingredient--the thing\nit takes to make a champion--courage.\"\n\n\"And you didn't think I had it?\"\n\n\"Sure I did. But the killer instinct is dead in fighters today and it\nhas to be ignited. It needs a trigger, so that was what I gave you--a\ntrigger.\"\n\nFrankie understood. \"You wanted me to get mad!\"\n\n\"To do it, you had to get mad--at me. You're not conditioned to get mad\nat Nappy or Pop. It's not the way we fight now. It had to be me. I had\nto make you hate me.\"\n\nFrankie marveled. \"So when Pop looked at you--\"\n\n\"He knew.\"\n\nFrankie was off the table, his arms around Milt. \"I'm--I'm so ashamed.\"\n\nMilt grinned. \"No, you're not. You're happier than you ever were in your\nlife. You're a real champion. Great feeling, isn't it? Now you know how\n_they_ felt--in the old days.\"\n\nFrankie was crying. \"You are damn right! Thanks.\"\n\nMilt looked years younger. \"Don't mention it--_champ_.\"\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ September 1956.\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
