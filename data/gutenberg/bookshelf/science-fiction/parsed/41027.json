Yet, on\n     consideration, we must realize that they are not so far-fetched.\n\n     Even in our picayune little corner of the universe, we find in the\n     insect kingdom a form of life that has survived through every\n     possible earth catastrophe in the last 40,000,000 years. With their\n     skeletons on the outside of their bodies instead of on the inside,\n     insects are able to protect their bodies from heat, cold, and from\n     accidents that would kill us. If the insect's shell were harder and\n     thicker and made of heat-resisting material, it might conceivably\n     be able to live in space without other protection.\n\n     The point is that Mr. Gallun makes his Space Men so convincing that\n     we can do nothing but believe in them. And he has woven about them\n     such a thrilling story of adventure on two worlds that one will\n     have to read and reread it, to get from it the fullest enjoyment.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was in the reading room of the Neilson-Aldebar space liner, _Ekova_,\nthat two young people came unexpectedly upon a third person who sat\nalone, absently skimming through a copy of the _Interplanetarian_. When\nthe girl caught sight of him she uttered a little acclamation of\nsurprise. \"Hekki-you!\" she cried.\n\nThe one addressed looked up. A smile of greeting came over his swarthy,\naristocratic features. \"Hello, Jan. It is I--none other,\" he said.\n\"Aren't you glad to see me?\" Here he shot a quick glance at the girl's\ncompanion.\n\n\"Why certainly I am, Hekki,\" she replied a trifle nervously. \"But how\ncan it be? A week ago you left for the deepest, most mysterious part of\nthe Taraal desert on Mars, to collect objects of ancient art, and now\nyou are here. Where have you kept yourself during the voyage?\"\n\nThe other smiled again--this time a cryptic, secretive smile.\n\"Business,\" he said mysteriously. \"It called me to Earth at the last\nmoment, and since we left the docks at Taboor, it has kept me occupied\nin my stateroom. This is but the third time I have ventured out of it.\nAlka brought me my meals.\" Hekki arched his finely penciled eyebrows\nslightly as he looked up at the lady's companion. \"And you too have had\nbusiness, Janice,\" he added. \"A new boy friend?\" There was a hint of\nsomething unpleasant in his tone, but the girl ignored it.\n\nShe nodded her golden head. \"We met on the night of the departure from\nMars, and since then, we've had a happy week together. Austin,\" she\nsaid, turning to the youth, \"I want you to know Hekalu Selba of Taboor.\nHekki, this is Austin Shelby, who hails from Chicago. You ought to get\nalong well together, because you are both so interested in mechanics,\"\nshe added. The men shook hands. For the past few moments Shelby had been\ntrying to analyze from the scanty data at hand the character of Hekki.\nHe saw the tapering, effeminate hands--one twiddled nervously a long\nMartian cigarette--the dark straight hair and fine features; the mouth,\nthat could curl so insolently; the faultless, white silk clothing.\n\nShelby decided that he did not like Hekki. The reason at first seemed\nobvious, but presently the young Earthman realized that his feeling\ntowards this child of the Red Planet was stronger than mere dislike.\nWhat was the explanation? Was it because Hekki was a friend of Janice\nDarell? Since he had met her aboard the _Ekova_ on this glorious return\nto Earth, after having spent a whole Martian year at an engineering\nschool at Taboor, Shelby had learned to know love. Was he jealous of\nthis noble of another world? A little, perhaps. But this did not account\nfor the vague, sinister aura he sensed about Hekalu Selba.\n\nSomething in Shelby's brain was trying to surge its way to the surface\nof his consciousness; he struggled with it, and it came out clear. Only\nthirty-six hours before, during the period designated for sleep, he had\nwandered into a seldom frequented passageway, high up in the hull of the\n_Ekova_. Here there were portholes through which he could see the\ncurving metal expanse of the ship's huge form, gleaming dimly under the\nstars of space. It had looked like the back of a great silver whale.\n\nFor a minute or two he had stared absently through the little circular\nwindow, and then, hearing footsteps down the corridor, he had turned to\nsee two figures some hundred feet distant moving away from him. They had\nobviously entered from a side passage and had probably not seen him. One\nhad been this very Hekalu Selba; Austin was sure of it. Beside him had\nmoved a shadow. The Earthman had not seen it clearly, for the\nilluminating globes burning here during the sleep period were dim and\nfar between.\n\nHe had but a vague fleeting impression of a huge knotty form, bent and\ngrotesque. Its arms were so long that its big hands almost dragged on\nthe floor. Its head was very large and bulbous. The pair had seemed to\ncarry something heavy between them, but Austin had not seen what it was.\nIn a moment the Martian had opened a door in the side of the passage\nand the two had vanished into it.\n\nWhen Austin had returned to his stateroom, he was not quite sure he had\nreally seen the monstrous horror. Surely nothing like it was known to\nexist within the orbit of Jupiter! Shelby had thought of reporting the\nincident to the commander of the vessel, but he had dismissed the idea\nas too pointless. Now, however, the memory of that vague black form was\nhaunting him. He knew that it was the key, in part at least, to his\nfeeling toward Hekalu Selba.\n\nThe Martian had cast his magazine aside. He was patting the soft\ncushions of the divan on which he was lounging. \"Sit here, my friends,\"\nhe said in his smooth, precise English. \"We shall talk, and then perhaps\nwe shall have a little refreshment.\" The two complied.\n\n\"It will be only for a moment,\" said the girl. \"The ship lands in an\nhour, and I haven't gathered my things together yet.\"\n\nShelby was intensely interested in this queer individual, about whose\npersonality there lingered a strangely indefinable web of mystery--of\nevil, almost.\n\n\"So you too have a passion for mechanics,\" he said. \"Somewhere I am sure\nI have heard of you before. Kelang Aggar, an instructor of mine at\nTaboor, spoke occasionally of a young Martian student--\"\n\n\"Kelang Aggar is my friend,\" Hekki broke in. \"He assisted me with\nseveral experiments. But they were nothing--a new alloy, very hard, and\nhaving a high point of fusion. The heads of the Space Ship Construction\nCompany said it was ideal for rocket nozzles, but they paid me a mere\npittance for the invention. This, and a few even lesser ones are my sole\naccomplishments in the line of mechanics.\" Hekalu Selba laughed lightly.\n\n\"Let us talk of other things, my friends,\" he continued. \"Let us allow\nour minds to ramble. See those two beautiful potted palms over\nthere--children of the deserts of Earth, and beside them the slender\ngraceful stem of the purple Kelan, dug from the marshes along the Selgur\nwaterway of my own planet. I have seen them both in their native\nhabitat, waving their fronds as though in cadence with some great silent\nsymphony of the universe. See that tapestry over yonder, with the beast\nwoven into it?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHere Janice Darell pointed up toward the flattened glass dome that\nroofed the room. \"There is old Mother Earth looking down at us, and the\nsun is peeping around her rim,\" she said. \"See how the light of Sol\nsifts through the terrestrial atmosphere. There is a streak of red, of\ngold, of opal, and beyond are the stars and the blackness of space.\"\n\n\"The contrast of the forces of darkness with those of light,\" Shelby put\nin softly.\n\nHekki was smiling absently. \"There are many contrasts,\" he mused. \"The\ncontrast of life and death, of power and weakness, of nightmare and\nreality.\"\n\nWords popped into Austin Shelby's head, and, carelessly, he uttered them\nwithout thinking: \"You often walk with your nightmares, don't you,\nHekalu?\"\n\nA hard light came into the Martian's eyes as he stared straight at the\nEarthman. \"Perhaps,\" he said, \"and you, Mr. Shelby, often walk in your\nsleep!\" But apparently the incident was immediately forgotten.\n\nAustin wondered how much the girl knew about the luxurious Hekalu. A\nquick glance of intelligence passed between them.\n\n\"I'll have to pack now,\" Janice said. \"Won't you boys walk along with me\na little ways?\" She took Austin's arm as they arose. Hekki fell in\nbeside them. At the entrance to the corridor which led to the girl's\nstateroom they paused.\n\n\"My business will occupy me tonight and tomorrow,\" said Hekalu, \"so I\nshall bid you goodbye until, let us say, the following evening, Jan, but\nif you like I shall have Alka take you home.\"\n\n\"Mr. Shelby has asked permission to perform that little service, you\nindustrious old business man,\" she replied mischievously. And again that\ndark shadow flickered momentarily on the Martian's features.\n\n\"But you will let me see you the day after tomorrow?\" he asked. \"I have\nfound a little paradise out at Oak Park patterned after the fairy\npalaces of my own planet, and besides, I have a new jewel to show you.\"\n\n\"Fie on your jewels, Hekki,\" she smiled, adopting the stiff trite speech\nthe Martians often fell into. \"But anyway, perhaps I shall favor you\nwith my incomparable company. The time you mention is still a ways away.\n_Sidi yadi_,[1] my friend. Remember I shall be expecting a view-phone\ncall from you soon.\" Then turning to Shelby: \"I'll meet you in the\nlounge right after the boat lands. Don't fail me!\"\n\n[Footnote 1: Martian farewell.]\n\n\"You needn't worry about that, Jan,\" he assured her.\n\nIn a moment she was hurrying up the corridor in the pink glow of the\nlights. As Austin gazed after her, he could not help but think how\nwonderful was this fluffy little wisp of blonde beauty. Was she for him?\nOver her he felt there lurked a dark shadow, but this only strengthened\nthe spell she had cast over him, for it gave to him the pleasure which\nvirile males experience when they know that their loved one requires\nprotection.\n\nHekki cleared his throat to attract the attention of his companion. When\nShelby turned toward him he was fumbling in one of the voluminous sleeve\npockets of his blouse. Presently he drew forth a very thin rectangle of\na substance resembling ivory, and handed it to the Earthman. Shelby\nglanced at it. It was one of the name cards commonly used by Martian\nmen. It bore the legend in the interplanetary symbols:\n\n     Hekalu Selba, Akar\n        414 Teldasa\n       Taboor, P. 4.\n\nBeneath in small letters appeared Hekki's Chicago address.\n\n\"I shall want to see you again soon, my friend,\" said the Martian\ncordially. \"There are many things at my establishment which I would like\nto show you--much that we can talk about.\"\n\nAustin Shelby accepted the card and handed Hekki his own. Here was an\nopportunity to get some first hand information on the mysterious man of\nMars and his more mysterious, perhaps sinister doings. The idea that he\nmight be placing himself in a dangerous position, Shelby gave scarcely a\nmoment's thought, for he had in him the spirit of the adventurer.\n\n\"Thank you, Akar Hekalu. I shall get in touch with you. And in the\nmeanwhile you can reach me at my address through the view-phone at\nalmost any time for I shall be working on a new mechanism there. _Sidi\nyadi._\"\n\n\"_Sidi yadi_, my friend.\"\n\nThe two men parted.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFifteen minutes later a rustling whisper was audible throughout the\n_Ekova_, above the steady purr of the forward-pointing decelerating\nrockets. It became a deep-toned soughing which rapidly increased in\nvolume to a loud roar, and then to a screeching hiss. The ship swayed\nand rocked a little. It was tearing its way into the terrestrial\natmosphere.\n\nIn the conning tower forward, the pilot and his assistant were working\ncalmly and cooly over the bewildering array of controlling mechanisms.\nGetting those thousands of tons of metal safely lowered into a space\nship's cradle on the landing stage, was a difficult task, but the\nexperience and efficiency of the two men was quite competent to cope\nwith it.\n\nFar below was a vast sea of winking lights--Chicago, its colossal\nskyscrapers looming up severe and white and beautiful in the glow.\n\nThe pilot's nimble fingers turned a small horizontal wheel at his side.\nThe liner dipped and dropped slowly earthward toward an area of white\nlight. A mass of cloud poured over the huge hull for an instant and then\npassed by. The outer shell of the great silvery whale which had been\nchilled to a degree from absolute zero, by the cold of space had been\nwarmed but slightly by the rapid passage through the atmosphere and now\ngleamed with jewel-like hoar frost.\n\nDown, down it floated until it was only three hundred feet above the\nlanding stage. A red signal light gleamed suddenly on a panel within the\ncontrol room, and the wizard of that eerie chamber shifted a tiny lever.\nThe space ship halted and hung motionless supported by its repulsion\nplates. On the ground in the glare of floodlights white-clad men hurried\nabout. Four mighty arms of metal groped upward from a mass of heavy\nframework. They clutched the craft with a grating noise, and then, with\nthe slow deliberation of a sleepy giant, they drew it gently down into\nits cradle.\n\nWithin the _Ekova_ all was abustle. Its doors, built solidly like the\nbreeches of big cannons, swung open, permitting the cool night air to\nenter the ship, which for seven days had been a world sufficient unto\nitself. Gangplanks were let down, and the passengers, jesting gaily with\none another began their leisurely descent to the ground. Customs\nofficials worked feverishly. A webby derrick arm pointing out from an\nopening in the side of the liner, was unloading mail and costly material\nand equipment sent to Earth from the Red Planet.\n\nThe routine processes of debarkation over, Shelby and Janice Darell\nentered the covered causeway which led to the great terminal building of\nthe Space Travel Company.\n\nThe two had caught but a fleeting glimpse of Hekki. He was talking\nearnestly to a white-clad official, and had not seen them; nor had they\ntried to attract his attention. Conspicuous among the Martian's numerous\npossessions was a large basket of metal wickerwork, such as were\ncommonly used to convey dogs and similiar pets from place to place. The\nsight of that basket had aroused again in Shelby's mind that peculiar\nsense of the presence of something sinister. Was the monster he had seen\nin Hekalu Selba's company hidden within that case of woven wire?\n\nWithin the causeway was a moving walk which carried Shelby and his\ncompanion to the depot. Here the intermittent whirring of pneumatic\ntube-cars operating in a vast network throughout the city was audible.\nThe young Earthian pair, and the two attendants bearing their light\nluggage entered an elevator, which carried them swiftly to the landing\nplatform for atmospheric craft on the roof of the building.\n\nShelby presented his identification tag and gave the number of his plane\nto the official in charge. The man led the way to a hangar at the side\nof the platform. Shelby had sent an order by radio to the Sutherland\nAircraft Company a few hours before, and, complying with his request, a\nbright new flier had been delivered and housed here, awaiting his\narrival.\n\nThe official closed a switch on the wall of the building, and the hangar\ndoor rolled open. While the two Earthians were entering the craft the\nattendants quickly placed the luggage into the load compartment.\n\nShelby fumbled with the destination mechanism and pressed the starting\nlever. The propellers, whirled at high speed by the soundless atomic\nmotor, thrummed softly. In a moment, the plane, unguided by human hands,\nhoisted itself almost vertically into the night and was off. Unerringly\nit would carry its occupants to their destination.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nA Strange Story\n\n\nShelby looked down at his companion. For a time she had been strangely\nquiet. Could it be that there was just a hint of a troubled look on her\nbeautiful face? The young engineer felt himself drawn to her more than\never. He wanted to know more about his new Martian acquaintance, but he\ndisliked to ask a direct question concerning him, for he feared vaguely\nthat it might give her offense.\n\n\"Jan,\" he said, \"you look worried. Is anything wrong?\"\n\nShe shook her head, slowly, absently, without looking at him. \"No, I was\njust thinking.\" She paused, and then in the same absent manner she\ncontinued: \"Only Hekalu Selba is back, and I thought I was rid of him.\"\n\nReassured somewhat by her words, but still taking care to conceal any\nhint of the menace he had sensed about the Martian, Shelby asked: \"What\npossible difference can his presence in Chicago mean to you? He seemed\nto me to be a very ordinary Martian nobleman--evidently supplied with\nplenty of money, and having no other motive in life than to enjoy\nhimself, and perhaps to help others enjoy themselves. A perfectly\nharmless individual.\"\n\nJanice's face grew serious. \"You say those things because you do not\nknow Hekki,\" she said. \"Shall I tell you about him? It would relieve me\nto share my knowledge with someone.\"\n\nThe young man nodded but made no comment.\n\n\"Two years ago,\" she began, \"I went to Taboor on Mars to study\nsculpture. Not long after my arrival at school, in the company of a\nnumber of other art students, I attended a ball given at a glorious old\npalace in the heart of the ancient Martian quarter. Our gracious host\nwas Hekalu Selba himself. I met him, danced with him, and talked with\nhim. From the first he was attracted to me and I to him, and so we were\noften together.\n\n\"Though some of his peculiar affectations were obnoxious to me, I\nthought that his good qualities far overbalanced his failings. He seemed\nalways kind and considerate in his dealings with all about him; he was\nwell informed on almost every possible subject; he painted pictures and\nplayed various musical instruments with a skill that was little short of\ngenius, and his tales of his travels and adventures in the little-known\nregion beyond the orbits of the minor planets could not fail to delight\nany listeners. Dreamer and brilliant artist--that was Hekki as I saw him\nthen. Effeminate--yes, but brave and resourceful too.\n\n\"Our intimacy grew. He made frequent proposals of marriage to me, but I\nput him off, saying that I was not sure I loved him. I informed Father\nback here in Chicago of our friendship. His next letter showed plainly\nhis enthusiasm over the idea of the possible marriage of his daughter\nwith this young noble of the ancient Martian house of Selba. 'Get him,\nJan,' he wrote. 'He'd be the catch of a lifetime. Why, his total assets\nwould make the treasure of Croesus look like a little piece of twisted\ncopper wire.' Poor practical old Dad! For once his business judgment was\nin the wrong. It was well that I did not follow his advice.\"\n\nAt this point Jan's story was interrupted by the sudden dropping of the\nplane. They had reached their destination. The craft descended\nvertically and landed with a light impact in the center of a small\nprivate roof garden at the summit of a great apartment building.\n\n\"Dad won't be home now,\" said Jan. \"He was delayed in New York, and will\nnot appear until tomorrow. There isn't anyone else around here except\nold Rufus, so we needn't go down stairs. Let's sit over there instead.\"\nShe pointed toward a quaintly wrought bench beside a splashing fountain.\nThe moon was shining, and the solitary cypress tree cast a spear-like\nshadow over the pool. There was a faint fragrance of flowers in the\nnight.\n\nJanice and Shelby seated themselves and the girl continued:\n\n\"Shortly after my meeting with Hekalu Selba rumors began to come to me.\nMen died mysteriously, and there were people who made vague hints that\nmy noble friend was responsible. An uncle of Hekki's had made him the\nprincipal heir to his fortune--shortly afterward the uncle contracted a\nvirulent disease and passed away. On both planets men that were\nobnoxious to Hekki were murdered--capable business rivals and people who\nperhaps 'knew too much.' Always the circumstances of their deaths were\npeculiar. Frequently they were found in locked rooms to which an\nassassin could scarcely have gained entrance without breaking his way.\nBut such violent methods had not been used. Never was there a shred of\nevidence to implicate the noble.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"But I was beginning to see Hekalu's true color. The lavish display of\nhis wealth--his estates and his art treasures, and the endless round of\ngood times he sought to provide, were merely an attempt to cover up his\nwickedness. One afternoon that I was with him, he was under the\ninfluence of the Elar drug. His face was red and his eyes gleamed with a\nwicked light. He proposed to me again, and when I made an angry refusal\nhe threatened me--said that if there was another whom I loved he would\ndestroy him and me too.\n\n\"That, I assured myself, was the end. Hekki tried to make up, but when\nhe found that I would have nothing to do with him he vanished. I think\nhe went off into the outer regions of the solar system again. He was\ngone for a long time, and I devoted myself entirely to my studies.\n\n\"Then suddenly, out of the blue, I received a letter from Hekki. It came\nfrom a small village far to the west of Taboor. A gift accompanied it.\nHekki informed me that in a valley far out in the unexplored Taraal\ndesert he had run across a ruined city built by the Melbar kings some\nseventy-five thousand years ago. He hoped to make an enormous fortune\nfrom the art treasures he had found there.\n\n\"The gift and the small photograph he sent me, I shall show you at the\nfirst opportunity. They are packed away now. The former is a dagger with\na flexible blade of a shiny black substance unknown to me. It does not\nseem to be metal. The hilt is a lump of platinum. It is carved to\nrepresent some strange animal with scores of coiling tentacles. Hekki\nsays that the object is one of his treasures, found on the site of the\nancient city. But I have doubted this. I know something of the art of\nthe Melbar kings, and certainly the dagger does not resemble the\nproducts of their craftsmen. The same is true of those wares of Hekki's\nwhich my friends have bought. They are strange--belonging neither to\nEarth nor Mars.\n\n\"The picture too is equally puzzling. It depicts a night scene in a\ndesert valley. Jagged hills in the distance and the nearer moon of Mars\nin the sky. The floor of the valley is in shadow and things there are\nindistinct. There are shapes there--vast shapes, odd and grotesque. And\nthere is something in the foreground which might be almost human!\n\n\"In his letter Hekki asked if he might see me again, and I immediately\nwrote and told him that I would. To you, Austin, this probably seems a\ncrazy thing to do, but like most everyone who is young, I had a genuine\nlove for intrigue and mystery, even though they might be dangerous\nthings to meddle with.\n\n\"Hekalu came to Taboor, but I saw comparatively little of him. He seemed\nalways to be tremendously busy. Sometimes he would be extravagantly\njubilant, as though he had met with some tremendous success, or again he\nwould apparently be worried almost to the point of madness. What these\nemotional changes meant, he would never tell me.\n\n\"Several times old Alka, his favorite slave, spoke to me. 'The Master is\nnot as he used to be, Miss Darell,' he would say. 'He works feverishly\nwith odd mechanisms, and every night when he is at home he stares out\ninto space toward the farther planets with his new super-telescope.\nAlways, what he sees makes his face turn white and hard; sometimes, he\nsmiles and sometimes his features look like a devil's mask.'\n\n\"And still Hekki's weird treasures continued, and still continue to come\nfrom the Taraal.\n\n\"A group of men was sent by the heads of the Place of Knowledge out into\nthe desert to investigate. They disappeared. The officials of the\nPlanetary Patrol made only a hasty and unsuccessful investigation.\n\n\"On the day of my departure from Mars, after having finished my course,\nI saw Hekki, believing that it was for the last time. He said he was\ngoing back into the Taraal. And then he popped up on the liner. And\nthat, Austin, is all I know about Hekalu Selba. What do you make of it?\nWhat is he trying to do out there in the desert?\" She placed her hand\nlightly on Shelby's arm and looked up appealingly into his face. \"Can't\nyou offer some suggestions, Austin? You know that when suspicious events\nare troubling you, a plausible explanation eases your mind even though\nyou cannot know the truth. And I am afraid, afraid that he is\ndeliberately following me to Earth!\"\n\nWhile Jan had been telling of her acquaintance with the Martian, Austin\nhad been staring at a very large Sadu moth which hovered, and leisurely\nmoved about on thrumming gorgeous wings, which spanned fully eighteen\ninches. It moved from blossom to blossom in a nearby flower bed,\ndelicately sipping nectar. Always its great luminous eyes, which glowed\nlike coals of gleaming fire, were turned toward the pair. Shelby had\nscarcely noticed it, for he was absorbed with the girl's account; but\nnow, when it edged closer towards them, and then made a sudden\nmischievous swoop not six inches above their heads, its presence could\nno longer be ignored. The girl gave an exclamation of revulsion and\nshrank involuntarily toward her companion. He leaped to his feet, and\npicking up a pebble from beside the fountain, hurled it at the night\nprowler.\n\n\"You dirty eavesdropper!\" he shouted angrily. \"The man who brought your\nkind from Mars for ornamental purposes must have been crazy!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe moth buzzed up into the cypress tree and squatted there, silently,\napparently resting. Only its eyes continued to glare fixedly, almost\nmalignantly at the occupants of the garden. But they quickly forgot\nabout its presence.\n\n\"I don't know whether I can offer a sensible explanation for Hekalu's\nactions or not, Jan,\" Shelby said. \"However, as far as his activities in\nthe Taraal are concerned, it seems quite possible that he did discover\nruins there, and is trying to keep other fortune seekers away. The ruins\nmay of course not really belong to the Melbar dynasty. They might have\nbeen built by some contemporary race. Just what he is doing among the\nminor planets, we can't any more than guess at. Probably he's just\nadventuring like a few other people. And as for his following you to\nEarth--well, I admit that you _do_ seem to be popular!\"\n\n\"You're making it sound awfully simple, Austin,\" said Jan. She paused\nand thought for a moment, and then, with seeming irrelevance she\ncontinued: \"Haven't you heard of queer clusters of luminous specks\nrecently seen by astronomers not far beyond Mars? They called them\nmeteor clusters, but they drifted about here and there, not following\ndefinite paths as meteors should do.\"\n\n\"You're trying to suggest that they are space ships, aren't you, Jan?\"\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"But they aren't,\" Shelby assured her. \"They don't polarize the\nreflected light of the sun as space ships do. Besides, where could they\nhave been built? Certainly not among the planetoids. And any place on\nthe planets, the Taraal desert for instance, would be an almost equally\nimpossible site for their construction.\n\n\"Think of the enormous crews of men and the vast supplies of food and\nwater and materials that would have to be taken out there into the\nwilderness. Undoubtedly Hekalu could back such a project financially,\nbut he would be discovered before he had made a fair start, and the\nMartian Planet Patrol would wipe him out of existence. Still, though I\ndon't think that the luminous specks are man-built vessels, I am equally\ncertain that they aren't meteors either.\"\n\n\"Then what are they?\"\n\nThe young man smiled and shrugged. \"I don't know,\" he said. The\nintuitive feeling that unknown, and not too beneficient forces were at\nwork in the ether about, was troubling him again, making his scalp\nmuscles tingle.\n\nFor a moment Shelby stared at the ground. \"Jan,\" he said, \"I didn't tell\nyou what I saw on the liner. I didn't tell anyone because I don't want\nto be called a lunatic. But I guess it's all right to let you in on this\nnow. Briefly, during the sleep period, I came upon Hekalu Selba prowling\nin a passageway aboard the _Ekova_, in the company of a vague thing that\nmay have been similar to that shape in the photograph--long arms, big\nhead, squat and muscular. If we knew what that thing was, and where it\ncame from, the snarl might be half untangled.\"\n\nJanice Darell's face took on a sudden surprised look. \"You actually saw\nwhat you say you saw?\" she cried. When her companion nodded, she\ncontinued excitedly with wide-open eyes. \"I still believe that Hekalu\nknows something about the meteor cluster. And the beast figures in\nsomewhere too. Austin,\" she cried, \"what if Hekki is trying something\nreally great? I know you don't take stock in any such idea, but just\nsupposing he is--what if--\"\n\n\"Let him try!\" the young man cut in. \"I almost wish he would! I'm afraid\nhe would get the surprise of his life.\" He was staring straight at the\nunwinking, malignant eyes of the Sadu moth.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\nShelby drew a small black case from his sleeve pocket and opened it. He\ntook from it a device which looked like a tiny pistol. There were\nseveral other odds and ends of mechanisms in the case. \"For a year I\nhave been working on a new weapon,\" he said. \"All the parts are\ncompleted, and tonight I shall finish assembling them. This little gun\nis the projector for a new ray which I have discovered--an etheric\nvibration of extremely short wavelength. A portion of the atomic energy\nin any solid or liquid substance the ray touches is instantly released.\n\n\"You doubt whether it is effective? Well, I can't give you any proof\nnow; I can only say that when I was back on Mars, fooling with my first\ncumbersome projector, which produced only the weakest of vibrations, I\nblasted a big hole in the wall of my apartment, and nearly killed the\nMartian physician who lived in the rooms next to mine. I had a devil of\na time explaining the explosion, and narrowly missed getting myself into\nserious trouble. In a few days I shall try to sell the weapon to the\nEarth Government. If they are convinced of its value, and I don't see\nhow they can help but be convinced, our friend from the Red Planet will\nhave to be very careful if he tries anything.\"\n\nShelby glanced at his wrist watch. \"Eleven thirty--my bed time,\" he said\nwith mock seriousness. \"But Jan, there's one favor I want to ask you\nbefore I go. Try not to see anymore of Hekalu Selba, Akar.\"\n\nJanice Darell made a valiant attempt to act the part of one whose pride\nand sense of freedom had been deeply outraged. \"Mr. Shelby,\" she said,\n\"what right have you to tell me what I shall or shall not do?\" But a\nlight laugh broke from her lips and spoiled her bluff.\n\n\"There are two reasons,\" replied her companion seriously. \"First,\nbecause we both believe that Hekalu Selba is dangerous; second--because\nI love you.\" He leaned closer toward her with the light of eagerness in\nhis eyes. \"Oh, I know I'm crude, Jan,\" he said passionately. \"I'm just a\nclumsy engineer, not a poet or ladies' man. What I'm trying to say to\nyou must seem awfully trite, but anyway, I want you with me always.\"\n\n\"You mean--?\"\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"All right, Austin,\" she said quietly, looking straight into his eyes.\n\nHis arms crept around her, and now he drew her gently to him.\n\nSome moments later, in the nearby pergola, the door which led to the\nrooms below opened, and an ancient negro clad in gaudy pajamas and\nbathrobe peered out into the garden. He saw the pair and recognized the\ngirl. A happy grin came over his wrinkled black face. \"Well, if dat\nain't a mos' pretty sight to look at,\" he muttered. \"My baby done come\nback at las', and dat sho' am a han'some boy she got dar!\" He turned,\nand leaving the door open and the light burning on the stair, descended.\nVery softly and wistfully he was crooning an old darky love song.\n\nIt was an hour later before Shelby's craft whirred up into the\nmoon-bathed night over the winking lights of the city. And at the same\ntime the big-eyed Sadu moth which had been crouching in the cypress\ntree, rose on its velvety wings and sped away, as though some urgent\nmission had suddenly claimed its attention.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nHekki's Proposal\n\n\nWhen Shelby reached his apartment, he immediately donned his laboratory\nsmock and set to work. But he had scarcely finished mounting a tiny coil\nof wire within the hand-grip of his weapon, when the view-phone bell\nrang insistently.\n\nThe inventor pulled off his smock and threw it over the materials on his\nwork bench, so that the person at the other end of the view-phone\nconnection, whoever it was, would not be able to see them. Then he\nsnapped the television and audio switches. The mists in the view-plate\ncleared, and there before him, as real as though he were actually in the\nroom, sat Hekalu Selba. The Martian's eyes gleamed with suppressed\nexcitement.\n\n\"Mr. Shelby,\" he was saying, \"it may seem strange that I should be\ncalling you so soon, but I have something simply colossal to talk over\nwith you. You must come up to my place immediately! I realize that you\nmay be very busy, but this _is_ important!\" And he added, \"It's nothing\nto discuss over the view-phone. Will you come?--please!\"\n\nShelby was about to make a cold reply, but he checked himself. An\nintense curiosity gripped him.\n\n\"All right, Akar Hekalu,\" he said. \"I'll be there.\" The switches\nclicked.\n\nHastily Austin changed to his street clothes, and then gathered together\nthe material for his weapon and placed them in the wall safe. Only one\nthing he selected from the jumble of apparatus--a tiny pinkish crystal,\nwithout which it was impossible to produce the Atomic Ray. This he\nsecreted in a hollow button on his sleeve.\n\nFor a long moment he stared at his automatic, which lay on his work\nbench. \"Better take you along,\" he muttered at length, \"--may need you.\"\n\nA wizened black-clad man whom Shelby surmised was the slave Alka, met\nhim at the entrance on the landing platform of a quaint Martian tower\natop a huge apartment building, and ushered him into an elevator. He was\nwhisked rapidly downward, and emerged into the central light-well which\npierced the structure from top to bottom. The barbaric tapestries upon\nthe walls of this tall cylindrical chamber, the tiling of the floor,\nwhich consisted of squares and circles and spear points of various\ncolored stone, fitted artfully together, giving an effect of pleasant\ndisorder. And most of all, the smell of strange incense in the air, told\nShelby that he had dropped into a little bit of old Pagar or Mars.\nEvidently the Prince of Selba was master of the entire tower, which, in\nitself, was by no means small.\n\nAlka led the way down a short passage, and admitted the Earthman to a\nlarge sumptuously furnished room, one end of which was softly\nilluminated by a quaintly beautiful floor lamp. The farther end of the\nroom was in complete darkness. The Pagarian architects had made it\nimitate the interior of a natural cavern, for where the light approached\nthe gloom, two glassy stalactites gleamed with a scintillant elfin\nlight.\n\nShelby had but a moment to take note of his surroundings--the dark\nhangings woven with silver threads, the embossed shield and spear of an\nancient Martian warrior mounted on the wall--before Hekalu entered. The\nyoung man saw at once that the noble had lost his air of bored languor\nwhich he had noticed about him at the time of their first meeting. His\neyes flashed with excitement and his movements were quick and cat-like.\n\n\"I see that you have come quickly, Mr. Shelby,\" said the Martian, \"and I\nam glad. Won't you sit down?\"\n\nWith scarcely a pause he continued: \"I have great wealth, my friend, and\nwhile your means do not seem to be small, I believe that it would be\nvery convenient to you to have them supplemented. Suppose I gave you\nsay, ten times as many jewels as are in the tray over on that stand?\"\nShelby looked in the direction the Martian indicated. He saw a flat\nshallow container of considerable size. At its center squatted a\nrepulsive thing about eight inches high, carved from a clear crystalline\nsubstance from which there flashed countless points of icy, wicked\nfire--a huge diamond!\n\nHeaped around it were hundreds of magnificent red _tabalti_, most prized\nof all gems. An expert appraiser had recently told Shelby that in two\nworlds only thirteen of them were known to exist. And now he was being\noffered all these stones by one who hinted that he was willing to give\nhim ten times as many--an utterly staggering fortune!\n\nHekalu's words fairly dumbfounded Shelby, but they grated upon his sense\nof pride as well. Nevertheless, his face gave no hint of what passed\nthrough his mind. An angry reply, he decided, was out of place.\n\n\"Naturally, Akar Hekalu, you want something in return for your amazing\ngenerosity,\" he said coolly. \"Of course, I could not accept your offer\nunder any other circumstances.\"\n\nThe Martian nodded. \"I have it from a reliable source, Mr. Shelby, that\nyou are the inventor of a terrible weapon--an atomic ray which might be\ndangerous in the hands of unworthy persons. Turn the weapon over to me\nas well as all information concerning its operation and construction,\nand promise to say not a word more about the weapon to anyone, and I\nwill give you the jewels at once.\"\n\nA flash of surprise passed across Shelby's face but he quickly masked\nit. So this was it! But how was it that the noble had learned of his\ninvention? Could it be that Janice Darell was playing a double\nhand?--his Jan. He dismissed the idea as preposterous and utterly\ndisloyal.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Earthman rose to his feet and addressed the Martian coldly. \"If I\nhave such a device I believe that I can place it in better hands than\nyours.\"\n\nHekalu Selba's face gave no hint of anger; in fact he seemed at the\npoint of laughing. \"You have done as I expected you would. Your refusal\nshows me how patriotic you are and gratifies me very much, Mr. Shelby,\"\nhe said blandly. \"You are as a man of Earth should be. However, there is\nanother side to the question. I have certain plans and to have you at\nlarge might endanger their fulfillment. Therefore I must ask you to\naccompany me on a little trip. That weapon of yours will be well taken\ncare of. Now, kindly raise your hands high above your head.\" The Martian\nwas pointing a bejeweled automatic straight at the chest of his visitor.\n\"You are being covered from two other points in this room so try not to\ncause any misunderstanding,\" he added.\n\nShelby saw the wisdom of obeying the order for he felt quite certain\nthat Hekalu Selba and his minions would not hesitate to shoot him down.\nWhat a colossal idiot he had been! He had sensed a trap when the noble\nhad called him over the view-phone and yet he had taken no sensible\nprecautions!\n\nHekki was searching him now. His long fingers were moving deftly from\npocket to pocket. They closed upon his automatic and drew it forth.\n\"Ah,\" the Martian breathed, \"it's as I thought. You have brought a\nsouvenir. A most worthy precaution. And, now that you are no longer in a\nposition to cause any trouble,\" he continued sneeringly, \"I may as well\ntell you about my ambition--Oh, it is simple enough; men have thought of\nit before but none had the nerve or ability to put it over. Briefly it\nis this--to become Master of both Earth and Mars! My friends are waiting\nfor me out there beyond the Red Planet--waiting for their commander. And\nthere is another little hope--there is a certain beautiful flower of\nyour race--\" Here he stopped to allow his captive to imagine the rest.\n\nA hard light came into Austin Shelby's eyes. It was the only outward\nindication of the sudden tornado of emotions and thoughts that swirled\nin his mind. This man sought to enforce his will upon the planets! The\nquestion of whether he was capable of realizing this tremendous dream or\nnot, the Earthman did not pause to debate.\n\nFifty years before, Saranov had attempted it, and as a result a score of\ngreat cities became shambles. Certainly the present foe of mankind was\nmore powerful than Saranov. The monstrous associate of Hekalu and the\nflitting specks of light far beyond Mars seemed to bear out the\nnobleman's boast. And if he somehow got possession of the Atomic Ray!\nAnd Jan--What was he going to do to Jan! Certainly it was she to whom he\nhad referred! It was this last idea which hammered on Shelby's brain\nhardest of all. A little fiend within him seemed to shriek. \"Escape!\nSend your weapon to the War Office! Kill Selba if you can, for\neverything is at stake!\" Escape, yes, but how?\n\n\"Place your wrists together behind your back now,\" Hekalu was saying. \"I\nhave a pair of magnificent manacles--careful. Do not make an abrupt\nmovement.\"\n\nA crazy idea had come into the Earthman's mind. He did not expect his\nplan to work but it was all he could do. With an air of one resigned to\nhis fate, he obeyed the order. He felt the Martian fumbling with the\nmanacles. He was evidently using only one hand. The other presumably\nstill held the automatic leveled at Shelby's back. But it was useless to\nthink of such things.\n\nA slim finger touched the young engineer's wrist. He caught it, twisted\nit back at the same time, then, summoning all the quickness and force he\ncould muster, he ducked low and hurled himself backward straight into\nthe Martian. There was a loud report. A hot pain seared into the fleshy\nfolds beneath Austin's left shoulder blade. Those hidden in the darkness\nat the farther end of the room did not dare to fire for fear of injuring\ntheir master. Now Shelby was grappling with Hekalu. He gripped the hand\nthat held the automatic.\n\nTwo more reports--ineffective, and then the two fell clawing and in a\nheap on the floor. The shaded lamp was upset and its illumination globes\nwere broken. There was darkness. Shelby heard the shuffle of running\nfeet coming across the marble pavement of the chamber. Help for Hekalu!\nHe'd have to hurry. But the Martian noble, racially much frailer than\nthe people of Earth, was no match for the athletic Shelby. In a moment\nhe was pinned, unable to move. The Earthman tore his weapon from him and\nthrust its muzzle against his recent opponent's chest. Before he fired\nhe saw the Martian's bold smile; whatever failings Hekalu Selba had,\ncowardice was not among them.\n\nOn the heels of the gun's report Shelby darted from the room and down\nthe short hallway which led back to the central light-well of the Selba\nestablishment. If he could only somehow reach his plane! He gripped the\ndoorknob and shoved fiercely, but the stout metal panels were immovable.\nHe might have known that the outer door would be locked! Oh, what an\nunutterable ass he had been!\n\nNow what? A hoarse cry of triumph caused him to turn. Alka was racing\ntoward him with leveled pistol. A spray of projectiles spread toward\nShelby but the slave's aim was bad and none of them took effect. A split\nsecond later Alka pitched to the floor with a bullet through his brain.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut there was another to be reckoned with--one who waddled along rapidly\non short powerful legs. Its arms were long and black and more powerfully\nmuscled than a gorilla's. One hand brandished a metal knob-stick, and\nthe other, a long-barreled pistol of Martian design. Silvery armor set\nwith jewels that glittered wickedly in the dim light of the hallway\ncrossed the creature's breast. Its head was bulbous, and its face, set\ndeep in plates of shining black chitin-like armor, consisted only of two\nenormous eyes and a lipless mouth. No nose at all! The horror Shelby had\nseen on the liner!\n\nThe Earthman fired at the monster. The first bullet clinked harmlessly\non his opponent's breast-plate. The second thudded full force upon its\nskull, but apparently the hard smooth skin of the creature was too tough\nto allow projectiles hurled from a pistol to penetrate it for it did no\nreal damage--only infuriated the monster. Black hard lids dropped\nprotectingly over its eyes, and its mouth worked convulsively. It\nquickened its pace and brought its own pistol into play.\n\nShelby had made a hasty survey of the hall and had noted the stairway\nbeside the door he had tried to open. He darted up this, ducking low\nbehind the stone railing to avoid his weird pursuer's bullets. Perhaps\nin the chambers above he could find a means of escape. He was leaving a\ntrail of blood on the marble steps, and his wound pained him terribly.\nHe felt sick and weak.\n\nWhen he had reached the top of the stairs, the unknown horror was\nalready halfway up. It had returned its pistol to its holster.\nApparently it had been so maddened by Shelby's shots, that only tearing\nits quarry to pieces could satisfy its lust for vengeance. And the thing\nwas gaining rapidly!\n\nBut the Earthman gritted his teeth and kept doggedly on. He fought back\nthe nauseous giddiness that was creeping upon him. He'd have to escape.\nOh God! There was too much at stake--the world and Jan--what was\nhappening to Jan? True, he had killed Selba, but certainly the Martian\nhad minions--men who could carry on without him. He could scarcely have\nbuilt up all his plans single-handed!\n\nFour flights of steps Shelby and his pursuer ascended. Was there a way\nof reaching the roof and the plane in this direction? And if there were,\ncould the Earthman reach it before the long arms of the thing so close\nbehind wrapped themselves about him? Such an event, Shelby knew could\nnot mean anything less than failure, and possibly immediate death. The\nfiend behind did not cry out or order him to halt. In fact it made no\nvocal sound at all. Not even its breathing, which should have been heavy\nand labored, was audible. Only the hurried shuffle of its unshod feet.\nIts silent relentlessness was nerve-wracking.\n\nThe engineer saw before him at the top of the stair a small doorway, and\nbeyond it a spiral runway leading upward. The light grillwork gate stood\ninvitingly open. Catching the grill with one hand as he rushed through\nthe door, Shelby sought to slam it shut and latch it. He almost had\nsucceeded, and then a huge hand closed upon the bars. One jerk, and a\nquick grab with the other immense paw and the strange flight and pursuit\nwould be at an end.\n\nBut the jerk was delayed. Shelby fired his last round. It did the\nmonster little harm, even though the distance between the two was but\nfour feet. Nevertheless it caused the armored horror to leap back a\nstep, and the moment thus provided was sufficient.\n\nAs Shelby stumbled up the dark spiral he heard the thing below tearing\nat the closed grill. He knew that it could not delay the thing for long.\nHe had just reached the trapdoor at the top of the long climb, when a\nmuffled ripping crash echoed up dimly from far beneath him. The gate was\ndown!\n\nFeverishly he struggled with the heavy trap. Normally it would not have\nbeen difficult for him to lift the rectangle of aluminum alloy; but\nwounded as he was, forcing his numbing limbs to obey him required almost\nsuper-human effort. When he had at last succeeded in hoisting it on its\nhinges, he could again hear the soft padding of hurrying feet.\n\nThe engineer found himself in a large room, one wall of which was\ncurved, conforming to the outer contour of the cylindrical tower.\nScattered illumination globes gave a dim light to the place. The room\nwas evidently a storehouse for Hekalu's laboratory supplies. Complex\nmechanisms stood about, evidently waiting to be installed. There were\nhundreds of metal drums presumably containing chemicals. There were\nbolts of heavy fabric and stacks of ingots neatly corded. Set in the\nceiling of the chamber were several circular windows through the heavy\nglass of which bright stars shone. Directly above was the roof, and but\na few paces distant, the landing stage!\n\nEscape seemed tantalizingly near, but with sinking heart, Shelby noted\nthat there was no easy means of ascent to the roof. He'd have to try to\nsmash one of those windows. But the monster hurrying up the spiral\nclaimed his immediate attention.\n\nDeeply thankful for the peculiar eccentricities of Martian architecture,\nhe hurriedly proceeded to pile ingots on the closed trapdoor. Each of\nthese ingots weighed well over a hundred and fifty pounds. Fortunately\nfor the wounded Earthman, the distance he had to carry them was only a\nfew feet.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nCapture!\n\n\nHe had transferred five to their new position before his pursuer arrived\nbeneath the trap and began to push upward mightily upon it. Shelby\ntransferred several more ingots to the pile just to make sure that the\nmonster could not enter. Then, fighting off the diaphanous veil of\nunconsciousness that was trying to drop over him, he looked about for\nsomething with which to effect his escape.\n\nA long bar of metal caught his eye. He seized it, and with all his\nstrength thrust upward at one of the ceiling windows. But the thick\nglass, crisscrossed by rods of metal, was not easily shattered.\n\nA rattling noise attracted his attention. He glanced back toward the\ntrap. His pile of ingots was trembling as if shaken by a miniature\nearthquake. The door was rising upward! It settled back and rose again.\nAn inch crack appeared, and through it Shelby could see two eyes and the\nmuzzle of a pistol. He leaped out of range just in time to avoid the\nbullet that whizzed across the room and flattened itself against the\nwall.\n\nHe darted around toward the hinged side of the trap, where he knew that\nthe black horror could not fire at him, and devoted his attention to\nanother window. He would have reinforced the barricade with more ingots,\nbut he realized that by spending his nearly exhausted strength that way\nhe would be defeating his own purpose.\n\nA dozen times he jabbed up viciously with the bar before a tiny crack\nappeared in the round pane of glass. The trapdoor behind him was being\nshaken violently. An ingot on top of the pile was jarred from its place\nand crashed to the floor. Yes, the window was giving. A small hole\nappeared in it.\n\nA pair of shiny black forearms had forced their way from under the edge\nof the trapdoor. Slowly and mightily the shoulders of the monster surged\nupward. The door was rising, and this time it did not seem that it would\nsink back.\n\nShelby had finished his task. Now, with the upper end of the bar thrust\nthrough the opening he had made in the window, and the lower end resting\nin a slight depression in the floor, he proceeded to climb it to safety.\nHis head and shoulders were through the hole when the monster at last\nburst its way into the room below. But the thing was just an instant too\nlate to hinder him.\n\nSweating and bloody, Shelby drew himself to the roof and staggered over\nto the landing stage. Yes, his plane was there.\n\nThe night air, and the flush of success was refreshing him. His\nexaltation leaped higher and higher as his plane swept him up from the\nsummit of the tower of the mysterious Selba.\n\nA wild refrain was drumming in his mind: \"Hekalu Selba is dead! I have\nkilled him!\" There was nothing more to do but notify the Municipal Air\nPatrol--an S. O. S. with his siren would accomplish that. They would\nraid the tower. If any of the Martian's fellow plotters sought to\ncontinue with the project the Earthman's new weapon would take care of\nthem.\n\nShelby was reaching for the siren button, and then a terrific explosion\nthundered up from somewhere below, and several hundred yards to his\nright. He saw the orange flash, and then, in an instant the whole city\nwent dark. Another crash came and another. Shelby saw a dark form glide\nthrough the air. From far beneath him he heard a troubled murmur mixed\nwith the din of colliding vehicles. Sirens shrieked. In the distance to\nhis right, a great plume of lurid flame blossomed in the sky.\n\nThe low purr of a machine gun sounded behind him, and he heard the\nalmost inaudible tick-tick of poisoned needle-darts piercing the\nfuselage of his craft.\n\nHe zoomed sharply upward for a thousand feet, and then glanced back.\nThere was a dim shadow out there--he was being followed. But this\ndiscovery, and the realization that the city was attacked made but a\nvague impression upon his fast-dimming mind. The warm fluid that oozed\nfrom his shoulder, making his clothing sodden and sticky, had all but\ndrained his vital energy.\n\nSomehow he began to doubt that he had killed Selba. It had been only a\ndream, and the monstrous thing that had sought his life had been a dream\ntoo. Hekalu was pursuing him now, trying to kill him! The idea took\nhold, for he could no longer distinguish fancy from reality. It brought\nto him a vague fear which would have been completely out of place with\nhim had he not been so near gone from loss of blood. It was like a\nchild's fear of the dark.\n\nHe began to fly towards home in a wild zigzag course like a dazed bat,\nbut this favored him, for it enabled him to avoid the darts from the\npursuing plane. Luckily he remembered that while under fire combat\nfliers do not make use of their automatic pilots except as a last\nresort, for these devices cannot direct the complex movements necessary\nin dodging enemy bullets. Automatically Shelby watched the guiding\ninstruments and followed their directions.\n\nSeveral times he signaled with his siren, but no one answered him.\nThousands of sirens were hooting, and the Air Patrol was very busy. The\ndarkness, the explosions and the muffled roar from the streets\ncontinued.\n\nTwo ideas now possessed Shelby's mind and he clung to them with the grim\npersistence of a wounded tiger. One was to get home, secure his weapon\nand rush it to the federal authorities. The other was to hurry to Janice\nDarell.\n\nPresently his plane bounded down awkwardly on the landing platform of\nthe building in which his apartment was located. He stumbled out, and\ndown the dark stair. The elevators were not working. Somehow he found\nhis door and unlocked it. He groped toward the wall safe. It was open,\nand the little black case which contained the unfinished atomic ray\nprojector was gone. A neat round hole had been drilled in the metal door\nof the safe.\n\nThe view-phone bell was ringing. Shelby stumbled to the instrument and\nmoved its switches. The view-plate did not work but he heard a faint\nvoice which he recognized as Jan's. \"Is that you, Austin?\" it said.\n\"Can't you help me? Something is out there. It has me cornered in my\nroom. It has killed old Rufus. The house police--\" There the connection\nsnapped.\n\nA wild surge of anger quickened the engineer's weakly beating heart. He\ntried to reach the door, and then he felt a stinging sensation in the\nback of his neck. A needle-dart charged with a sleep-producing drug had\nstruck him. He slumped to the floor.\n\nA moment later a thing of metal and fabric, fitted with drills and\ndelicate thread-like tentacles, and formed like a giant Sadu moth of\nMars, darted out from behind a curtain where it had been hiding. It flew\nup through the air-tube which had been its means of entrance to the\nroom. On the roof it met a black nightmare, and by means of signs traced\nin the air with an intelligence that was paradoxically human, it\ndirected the monster to Shelby's apartment below.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe first sensation which bore itself in upon Shelby's consciousness\nwhen he was regaining his senses was a terrific throbbing pain in his\nhead. He opened his rheum-plastered eyelids and looked about him. He was\nlying in a bunk within a small dim-lit compartment. Polished duralumin\nwalls gleamed all about. At the center of his prison was a table, and\nbeyond, built into the opposite wall, was another bunk. There was a\nblack blob of something sprawling on the mattress, but he could not see\nclearly what it was. The illumination globe in the ceiling was not\nburning, and only a faint glow filtered through the curtained, circular\nwindow. A muffled purring vibration told Shelby that he was aboard a\nspeeding space ship.\n\nAroused evidently by the stirring of its charge, the thing in the\nopposite berth arose and strode leisurely toward the Earthian. The metal\nof its harness tinkled, and sharp points of light flashed against its\nebony body, like gems sewn into a sable curtain that is being swayed by\na vagrant draft of air.\n\nThe Earthman recognized the creature immediately as his recent pursuer.\nIt had pressed the light switch now, and the illumination globe glowed\nsoftly. Then the thing bent over Shelby, and with a gentleness that was\nsurprising, it rolled him over and examined his bandaged wound briefly.\n\nThe young man conquered his revulsion sufficiently to look up into the\nmonster's face. He thought that it was odd that the sight of it did not\nterrify him. No, really it was not more hideous than the visages of\ninsects he had seen through a microscope. He studied the hard chitinous\nvisors that blinked over the monster's eyes--the hollow where its nose\nshould have been; and he searched for some hint that there was a human\npersonality within that knotted carcass but found none. The lipless\nmouth and the blankly staring eyes were without any expression that he\ncould interpret.\n\nTwo things struck Shelby as being peculiar--the fact that the monster\ndid not seem to breathe, and the icy coldness of its hands.\n\nThe thing walked to the door, unlocked it, and left the room. The\nengineer heard a grating of the key being turned when the door had been\nshut.\n\nTaking advantage of the opportunity to move about without being\nobserved, he jumped out of bed and hurried to the window. It was then\nthat he noticed that there was a metal band about his right ankle. A\nlong light chain led from it to an eyelet in the wall. Truly he _was_ a\nprisoner!\n\nA single glance through the porthole confirmed what he had known was\ntrue--the black sky and the unwinking stars of space.\n\nThere was a narrow walk beneath the window, running the full length of\nthe flier's hull. The railing of woven wire cast a checkered shadow on\nthe walk. Somewhere toward the stern a blazing sun was shining, but\nShelby could not see it.\n\nHis first thoughts concerned some means of spoiling the plans of Selba's\nband. He guessed, of course, that they were responsible for his present\nposition, and he realized that it was likely that the zero hour of their\nattack upon the planets was not far off. Could he escape?--a practical\nimpossibility.\n\nNevertheless he looked longingly at the emergency space-boat hugging\nclose to the hull of its mother ship, and fitted so admirably into her\nstreamlining. If he could get to the entrance of that boat--it was in\nsome other room farther toward the bow--he could give his captors a run\nfor their money and perhaps reach Earth. And if he did? Shelby had great\nconfidence in the Atomic Ray. He removed the top from the button where\nhe had secreted the pink crystal. It was still there.\n\nBut how could he get into the space-boat? Plainly it could not be\naccomplished now. Perhaps soon--in a few hours maybe, an opportunity\nwould present itself. And there were other things he might do. A moment\nin the engine room, and he could blow the ship to atoms, and with it,\nmost of the ringleaders of the Selba crowd. Stoically Shelby realized\nthat he too would be destroyed, but if he could serve his world, he\nwould not hesitate to make the move.\n\nBent on getting as well acquainted with his present environment as he\ncould, the Earthman proceeded to examine minutely everything that was\nwithin the range of his senses. He tested the strength of his chain, and\nbegan to fumble over each link, without having any definite idea of what\nvalue the knowledge gleaned from such a procedure would be to him.\n\nHe had reached about the tenth link when he heard a sound above the purr\nof rocket motors--voices. There were two of them. One was a man's; the\nother was soft and feminine. Shelby knew it at once--Janice Darell's! So\nshe too was aboard the space flier! He realized it with a pang of\napprehension. In vain the Earthman tried to catch the words they were\nsaying, but beyond detecting the chilly tone in the girl's voice, he\ncould get no idea of what they were talking about. Apparently they were\nin the room next to his.\n\nHe heard footsteps in the hall outside, and returned quickly to his\nbunk. Three people entered the room. The first was the black monster.\nShelby gave a gasp when he saw who followed it--Jan. She looked tired\nand worn but in her face there was no hint of fear. She smiled wanly at\nShelby. There was another behind her. It was Hekalu Selba--the man the\nEarthian thought he had killed! For once Shelby was really dumbfounded.\nHe uttered the Martian's name without thinking.\n\nThe noble grinned in Satanic amusement. \"It is I, none other, my\nfriend,\" he said. \"Aren't you glad to see me? You look as though you\nwere being visited by a ghost.\"\n\nThe Martian chuckled. \"But thanks to a breast armor I still belong to\nthis plane of existence. I admit though that you gave me a great scare\nwhen you nearly, but not quite, escaped. My four bombing fliers supplied\nan adequate diversion for the Municipal Patrol, didn't they? And my Sadu\nmoth, radio controlled automaton--it functioned perfectly!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShelby rose from the bunk and sauntered toward his captor. Hekalu made\nno move to stop him. \"Now that you have Miss Darell and me nicely\ntrapped, what do you intend to do?\" Shelby inquired coldly.\n\nThe Martian laughed. \"You have a very inquisitive nature, Mr. Shelby,\"\nhe said. \"What do you expect me to do? Continue with my plans which you\nso almost successfully spoiled, my friend.\" Here Hekki's voice became\nsuddenly excited and husky; his lips curled and his eyes took on the\nfanatical look of a megalomaniac who sees within his grasp his dream of\npower.\n\n\"Very soon,\" he lisped, \"we strike. Mars first, then your planet. I\nshall be great--greater than all the combined rulers of the millenniums\ngone by, and Janice here, will share my greatness.\" The slender arm of\nSelba stole around the waist of the girl beside him. She did not try to\ndraw away. \"That last little idea maddens you, doesn't it, Mr. Shelby?\"\nhe added with a sneer.\n\nShelby felt a flush of heat in his cheeks. What happened to Jan that she\nshould permit the noble to be so familiar with her? Had she been dazzled\nby his wealth and his promises of what stupendous things the future\nwould bring? For a fraction of a second something seemed to let go in\nthe Earthman's mind, and then he saw the fleeting look in the girl's\neyes. He checked the impulse that had urged him to send a fist crashing\ninto the face of the smirking noble. Certainly such an act of violence\ncould accomplish no good.\n\nShelby looked at the black monster. It was standing beside the table,\nand leaned forward, so that its knuckles rested ape-like upon the floor.\nIt was gazing narrowly at the Martian, and its mouth opened and closed\nnervously. There was a faint something in its almost blank face which\nsuggested to the Earthman that the bond of friendship between the Prince\nof Selba and this weird devil of the void was none too strong.\n\nHekalu withdrew his arm from about the girl. He nodded toward the\nbejeweled nightmare. \"I had almost forgotten my lieutenant here, Mr.\nShelby,\" he said. \"He is the ruler of the empire from which I am\nrecruiting my forces--my chief ally. Since his people do not employ a\nlanguage of sounds, he has no vocal name; but for the sake of\nconvenience I have christened him Alkebar, which means 'The Unknown.' He\nwas my companion on my recent trip to Earth, for he wanted very much to\nsee what a beautiful place is your world.\" There was a sinister hint in\nthese last words.\n\nHekki made a few quick signs to Alkebar with his fingers, and then\nturned to the girl. \"I must ask you two to leave us now, Jan,\" he said.\n\"Mr. Shelby and I have an important matter to discuss.\"\n\nAlkebar grasped Janice's arm with a horny paw, and hurried her through\nthe door. But nevertheless Shelby caught a fleeting glimpse of her face\nas her lips formed, but did not utter, the word--\"Wait.\" Hekki did not\nsee.\n\nThe Earthman turned upon the Martian. \"I am going to usurp your assumed\nright to start this little private conversation, Akar Hekalu,\" he told\nhim. \"There is only one thing I have to say. You are a noble, the son of\na long line of nobles who righted wrongs and avenged insults on the\nfield of honor. You have wronged me, no you have outraged me. Therefore\nI challenge you to combat. Choose your weapons. No place will suit me\nbetter than this room; no time better than now.\" But if Austin had\nexpected to nettle Hekalu into a mood for fighting, he was disappointed.\n\nThe Martian was smiling mockingly. \"Life is sweet,\" he said, \"sweeter to\nme than it has ever been before. I do not wish to die--not even by your\nhands. And you--you have certain knowledge and information which is\nvaluable to me. You must live. I was going to talk to you about what you\nknow. That weapon of yours--we are working on a projector. But something\nis evidently missing--a tiny element.\"\n\n\"What you have learned about the Atomic Ray,\" Shelby cut in, \"you\nlearned through your own efforts. If you can steal the remainder of the\nnecessary information from my brain, you are welcome. Otherwise, I\nurgently invite you to go to the devil.\"\n\nHekki's face assumed a look of infinite though make-believe sadness. It\nwas a trick such as a designing woman might use to attract some\ndesirable male.\n\n\"I am sorry to hear you talk so, Mr. Shelby,\" he said. \"But as you\nsuggest, I believe that there are ways of stealing knowledge even from\nyour mind. For instance, in an old vault beneath my palace at Taboor, I\nonce found a sealed vat containing a certain fluid. The Ancient Ones\nwere wise, for when they desired any man to talk, they thrust his arms\nor his legs, or perchance his whole body into the fluid. Very slowly,\nand with some discomfort, it ate away the tissue of his nerves. I must\nleave you now, my friend. Think well, and may the gods that rule the\nuniverse guide you on the right course.\"\n\nHe opened the door. Shelby caught a glimpse of a long hall, and at the\nfar end, the bewildering maze of control-room equipment. The panel\nclosed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nThe Race Through Space\n\n\nImmediately the Earthman set himself to the task of examining everything\nin his prison. But as he had expected, there was little or nothing to\ndiscover. The walls which his tether permitted him to reach were all\nperfectly smooth and solid. He realized with a sheepish grin that it had\nbeen foolish of him to even dare to hope that they would be otherwise.\nThe chain fastened to the fetter was quite adequate to hold him. The\nwindow, even if it might have been used as an avenue of escape, was\nsecurely fastened with bolts, so that it would have taken a man equipped\nwith a heavy set of wrenches, an hour to remove it. To shatter the\nflexible pane was next to an impossibility. The table was firmly welded\nto the floor. Beyond the table, Shelby could not go, for the chain\nprevented him. But he was quite sure that there was nothing movable in\nthe entire room massive enough to be used as a tool or weapon.\n\nHe slumped down on his bunk, and let one hand rest on a small power-pipe\nwhich ran along the wall and up to the illumination globe above. For a\nminute dejection almost got a firm grip on him. But he fought it off.\nThis was no time to give up. Why, the struggle hadn't even started yet!\n\nShelby felt a faint vibration of the power-pipe under his hand. For a\nconsiderable time the impressions had been coming to him, but they had\nscarcely penetrated into his consciousness. They seemed no more\nsignificant than the hundred and one little noises and disturbances that\ngo with the running of any space ship. Presently however, the regular\nsequence of the pulsations attracted his attention. Something made him\nthink of the almost obsolete Morse code. Then the realization came to\nhim. Someone in another room on he ship was tapping on the\npower-pipe--signaling--signaling him! He spelled the word\nout--A-u-s-t-i-n, repeated over and over again.\n\nHis first thought was of Jan. It must be she who was calling him for\nthere was no one else.\n\nQuickly, with his heavy signet ring, he tapped out an answer: \"It is I,\nJan, A. S. shoot--\"\n\nWith tensed muscles, and with fingers firmly clutching the power-pipe\nthat he might not miss a single signal, Shelby crouched, receiving the\nmessage. Somehow there was an urgency, an insistence, an appeal about\nthose hurried pulsations that no human voice could have conveyed. It was\nfantastically like communicating with one who is buried alive.\n\n\"We must escape not later than five hours from now,\" the tapping\nspelled. \"You have been unconscious for a long time--drugged. In five\nhours we land on Mars. Then escape will be impossible.\n\n\"Hekki has told me much, and I have seen much. The horrors that are\nSelba's henchmen--three times some of them came to the ship, once in a\nband of over a hundred. Hekki is worried. He has not troubled me yet.\nToo busy I suppose. I have tried to make believe that I agree to his\nplans. I thought I could control him that way. But he has been taking\nthe Elar drug.\n\n\"We must escape, Austin. We must! Can't you think of a way? I will help!\nIf they get you to the concentration base in the Taraal they will\ntorture you. And we must remember our homeland!\"\n\nThe hurrying vibrations ceased, and then, almost before he knew what he\nwas doing, Shelby was tapping out an answer promising the impossible.\n\n\"Never fear, dearest,\" he signaled. \"Just let me think for a few\nminutes.\" A moment later this phrase almost made him laugh. The sap hero\nof a comedy which had recently been broadcast over the radio-view had\nsaid almost these exact words. Think? Of what? Escape within five hours?\nHow? But Jan's appeal sent in such an odd way had an almost magical\neffect on him, and made his brain work harder almost than ever before.\nAnd then the ghost of an idea came. There was a chance that it would\nwork. He signaled to Jan, and then for half an hour, they put their\nheads together--planning.\n\nSomewhat nervous, Shelby walked to the door and hammered loudly upon it.\nA thin-faced slave whose hide was burned by desert suns to the color of\nmahogany, appeared almost immediately.\n\nShelby answered his inquiring look briefly: \"I would speak to your\nmaster,\" he said in Pagari--\"right away.\" The slave nodded and reclosed\nthe door.\n\nIn excited impatience the Earthman waited. Now and then he tapped short\nmessages of encouragement to Jan. Would Hekalu never come? The strain of\nsuspense was not exactly pleasant. Finally, unable to contain himself\nany longer, he rose from the bunk where he had been reclining in\nreadiness for the first move of the coup he was planning, and began to\npace the floor.\n\nHe chanced to glance out of the window. On the railed walk beyond, a man\nclad in space armor was bending over a small portable case which was\nsupported on a tripod. Shelby surmised correctly that this man was\nHekalu Selba.\n\nBeside him, paying close attention to whatever the Martian was doing,\nstood the black Alkebar. The Earthman frowned in puzzlement, almost in\nawe. For Hekki's weird companion wore nothing that would be of the least\nhelp in protecting him from interplanetary cold and lack of air\npressure. Not even an oxygen helmet! And yet, as the monster examined\ninterestedly, every dial and switch that Hekalu touched, he showed not\nthe slightest hint of discomfort. The airless emptiness of space seemed\nhome to him. How could such things be? A strange thrill tingled and\nvibrated along Shelby's spine when he realized how alien was Alkebar.\nThere was no kinship between him and the creatures of either Earth or\nMars.\n\nPresently Hekki looked up, and as though moved by some intuitive\nrealization that he was being watched, turned awkwardly in his\ncumbersome attire, and glanced along the row of portholes in the side of\nthe vessel. He saw the Earthman and smiled at him. Shelby felt that it\nwas the kind of smile which a tolerant father might show to his youngest\nson. Hekalu waved his hand, and his lips, behind the glazed front of the\nhelmet, formed several words which Shelby could not interpret. Then the\nMartian returned his attention to his apparatus.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen Selba entered his prisoner's room some moments later, he found him\nlounging on the bunk.\n\nThe Martian looked enquiringly at Shelby. \"You have reached some\nconclusion, my friend?\" he asked.\n\nWithout changing his position on the bunk the young man nodded. There\nwas an expression of dejection and sullen resignation on his face which\nhe was trying hard, above the intense excitement which possessed him, to\nmake realistic. Still acting the part he spoke: \"Yes, Akar Hekalu,\" he\nsaid between teeth that were apparently gritted with rage, \"I have\ndecided to reveal to you the secret of the Atomic Ray.\"\n\nA triumphant gleam came into the Martian's eyes. \"Ah, my friend,\" he\nsaid, \"you at last see the light. I knew that you would. But what has\nbeen the cause for this sudden change in attitude? The torture chamber,\nperhaps?\" There was an undercurrent of suspicion in Hekalu's voice.\n\nShelby turned his head sullenly away, feigning shame. He said nothing. A\nminute passed during which time Hekalu stared at his captive, a sardonic\nsmirk of contempt curling his thin coral lips.\n\nFinally he said, \"I will have Koo Faya bring you writing materials, and\nyou will describe in writing every detail of the manufacture of the\nmissing element.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Shelby, turning his face toward the Martian, \"I haven't\nthe ability to do that. It will be necessary for you to take me to the\nlaboratory of the ship where I can demonstrate the process to you. It is\nmuch too delicate and complicated.\"\n\nThe noble's eyes wavered slightly. \"Once,\" he said, \"you tried to trick\nme, but I warn you that I am on guard now so do not attempt it again.\"\n\nHe signed to Alkebar who had been standing silently beside the open\ndoor. The giant drew a key from a pouch at his side, and kneeling,\nunlocked the fetter fastened about Shelby's ankle. It rattled to the\nfloor. And at the same time the Earthian, leaning back on the bunk with\narms stretching over his head, tapped sharply three times with his\nsignet ring on the power-pipe. It seemed to be only an unconscious\ngesture--nervousness perhaps.\n\nImmediately there was a terrific crash from down the passage way,\nfollowed by an agonized scream. Another crash. More screams.\n\nHekalu started, and then making a hurried gesture to Alkebar which\nindicated that he was to guard the inventor of the Atomic Ray, he drew\nhis automatic and dashed down the corridor to investigate the\ndisturbance. The Earthman however, was in no mood to be guarded. No\nlonger shackled, he leaped to his feet and over to the center of the\nroom. The great voiceless beast from the stars stood before the doorway\nwith his long arms outstretched. He was not trying to capture the\nEarthman--only seeking to block his path.\n\nBut Shelby had no time to waste. Gathering himself together, he hurtled\nstraight for the ankles of his opponent. The fact that the artificial\ngravity of the ship was of the same strength as that of Mars--only a\ntrifle more than one-third that of Earth--added to the effectiveness of\nhis plunge. The mighty-muscled Alkebar, puzzled by the unheard-of\ntactics of his agile though vastly weaker foe, suddenly found himself in\na sprawling heap on the floor. Shelby leaped over him through the door,\nslammed it, and raced precipitately down the corridor.\n\nIn the meantime Hekalu Selba had reached Janice Darell's room, but when\nhe had unlocked it and had thrust his head inside to see what the matter\nwas, a heavy urn, deftly aimed, had crashed full into his face. Shelby\nsaw him sprawling in the passage badly dazed, and a split second later\nJan dashed from her cabin. She looked around, and when she saw Shelby\ncoming swiftly toward her she flashed him a quick smile of triumph.\n\nBut Alkebar had wrenched the portal of the Earthman's recent prison\nopen, and was in hot pursuit. He was tugging frantically at the pistol\nin his belt.\n\n\"Run, Jan, quick!--To the control room!\" Austin shouted.\n\nHe caught up Hekki's automatic which had dropped from the Martian's\ngrasp when he had fallen, and wheeling, fired at the black colossus. The\nbullet struck Alkebar's right hand with which he was raising his pistol.\nThe tough natural armor which covered the monster from head to foot\nprevented it from doing any serious damage, but it must have stung\nbadly, for his weapon clattered to the floor. While he was stooping to\nrecover it, Shelby hurried forward to catch up with Jan. It was but a\nfew yards to the control room. If they could get there, overcome whoever\nwas in charge and barricade themselves in, they could master the ship!\n\nTheir luck had been good, but it was not destined to be as good as that.\nThey caught but a brief glimpse of the bewildering array of switches,\ndials and levers, that constituted the brain-center of the craft.\nStanding on guard before his instrument panels was the mahogany-colored\nslave Koo Faya. He was half crouching, at bay. There was a murderous\nlight in his eyes, and he held leveled in his hands a light machine\ngun. Shelby's automatic was leveled too, and he pressed his trigger an\ninstant before the Martian. Four bullets whizzed into the control room,\nsplattering close about the thin mummy-like body of Koo Faya. A glass\nglobe that glowed redly on the top of a complicated mechanism, was\nstruck and burst with a popping sound. A rose-colored vapor floated\nceiling-ward.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSimultaneously Koo Faya's weapon began to whir. Then, even as Shelby\njerked Jan back out of danger, the wild shriek of an alarm siren mingled\nwith the discordant clashing jangle of ungoverned machinery running\namuck, rang through the ship, and the huge metal cigar pitched and\ncareened like a frightened thing.\n\nAlkebar, having recovered his pistol, was staggering down the passage\nshooting rapidly. But owing to the crazy motion of the space flier his\nmissiles were momentarily not taking effect.\n\nAustin and Jan knew that Koo Faya was leaping to a position where he\ncould shoot his poisoned darts at them again. What now? Cornered? No!\nJanice Darell wrenched open a door in the side of the passage and shoved\nShelby into the tiny room beyond.\n\nIn the opposite wall of the closet was a round dark opening. \"The\nemergency flier,\" Jan shouted. \"Into it!\"\n\nAs quickly as they could they climbed through into the submarine-like\ninterior beyond. Fighting to keep themselves erect, they slammed the\nheavy duralumin portal to and fastened it. Alkebar was already groping\non the opposite side. But he was too late.\n\nShelby leaped to the control panel and cut the electric current from the\nmagnets that held the emergency flier anchored to its mother ship. It\nfloated, free from the careening hulk. Its rocket motors roared into\nlife.\n\nThe occupants of the tiny craft looked back at the _Selba_. It had\nceased its mad motions now, and was hanging quietly in space. Evidently\nKoo Faya had succeeded in righting matters to some slight extent at\nleast. Would he be able to patch things up entirely? The red globe could\nbe replaced in half an hour. It would be that length of time at least\nbefore the _Selba_ could engage in pursuit.\n\nBut the arm of a space ship, equipped with weapons commonly used in the\nvoid, is long. Hence Austin Shelby considered it his first duty to put\nas much distance between his craft and Hekalu's ship as possible.\n\nStill four million miles away, Mars glowed--a tiny red disc; and he\nheaded toward her giving the flier full freedom to do its best. The\nfiery vapors fairly tore from the rocket nozzles.\n\nWith one hand in readiness on the control lever, which resembled in\nappearance and operation the joystick of an airplane, and his feet on\nthe bar used for steering in a lateral plane, he kept his eyes fixed on\nthe receding bulk behind. Jan had handed him one of the two pairs of\nbinoculars which she had just found in the supply compartment.\n\nAustin knew what to expect from the direction of the _Selba_, and it\ncame well within schedule. A flash of green fire spurted from the\nforedeck of the ship. It showed up with startling vividness against the\njeweled sable of the void.\n\nAbruptly Shelby drew the control lever back. In response to his movement\nthe rocket nozzles, now deflected from alignment with the central axis\nof the craft, sent it into a steep climb. The terrific angular\nacceleration seemed intent on forcing the two fugitives straight through\nthe metal floor. It drew the blood from their faces and made them grow\npale and giddy. But they escaped being struck by the torpedo.\n\nIt exploded a hundred yards beneath the flier's keel. Fragments of it\nbanged against the hull. In rapid succession other flashes darted from\nthe _Selba_, which had dwindled to a silvery speck far to the rear. But\nstill those missiles, directed by incredibly delicate sighting\nmechanisms, and hurled at almost the speed of light, continued to score\nremarkably close to their target.\n\nIf it had not been such an elusive target they most certainly would have\nblasted it to fragments. But Shelby, skilled as were most of the men of\nhis time, in the handling of small space craft, was able to endow his\nflier with much of the agility of an alarmed dragon fly. Darting,\nweaving, zigzagging, yet always keeping its general course fixed toward\nMars, it careened away. Always it was ringed by an aura of green\nflashes.\n\nHowever, good fortune is seldom perfect. The tempered duralumin plates\nof the flier managed to withstand the force of all of the torpedo\nfragments which showered them--with one exception. One dart from\nHekalu's ship exploded barely fifty feet to the right of the fugitive\ncraft, and a flying chunk of steel sent it pitching and tumbling through\nthe ether.\n\nWhen the two bruised occupants had regained their equilibrium they heard\na faint hissing above the roar of rockets. They knew that there was but\nslight chance that the _Selba_ could do them any further harm, for\nthough the torpedoes continued to come, the distance between the two\nvessels was now so great that a damaging shot was almost an\nimpossibility. Nevertheless, the present situation was serious enough. A\nleak!\n\nFixing the nose of the flier toward the Red Planet, and locking the\ncontrols, Shelby left the pilot's seat to determine the extent of the\ndamage, while Jan searched the supply compartment for something with\nwhich to repair it. There was a deep dent in one of the ceiling plates\nand a thin wriggly crack through the center of it--not an easy job to\npatch that out in space under the best of circumstances.\n\nThe young man whistled when he saw how near they had come to a hideous\ndeath. Several times he had seen the bodies of men who had been suddenly\nexposed to the pressureless airless cold of the outer void--hideous\nbloated things through whose skin the livid blood had forced its way.\n\n\"Any luck, Jan,\" he asked, looking back at his companion. \"Did you find\nsome cement?\"\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nThe Space Men Attack\n\n\nFirst stepping to the oxygen supply valve and opening it a trifle wider,\nShelby hastened to assist the girl in her quest. Their ears were\nringing. The air pressure within the hull was dropping rapidly.\nDiligently they ransacked every nook and corner, but found nothing more\nvaluable than a can of thick grease. Shelby smeared some of it over the\ncrevice; it helped but did not by any means check the flow of the\nescaping air entirely.\n\n\"It's a race with time now, Jan,\" he said quietly.\n\nShe looked at him. Her face was a trifle pale, but her lips and eyes\nwere smiling. \"Are we on our way to Mars, Captain?\" she enquired.\n\nHe nodded. \"We are, Admiral. The fuel tanks are full and if our air\nlasts we'll get there.\"\n\n\"And when we do,\" she put in, \"the best of luck to Hekki and his\nfriends!\"\n\nA vision swept through Shelby's mind--batteries of fantastic machines\nwhose maws spewed flames of faint lavender fire--blinding flashes of\nlight and world-rocking explosions: a hideous thing to dream of--hideous\nyet glorious, for the civilizations and freedom of two worlds depended\nupon it. To the Red Planet--they _must_ make it!\n\nJanice Darell had placed her hand lightly on Shelby's arm. Her\nexpression was serious, almost hard. \"Austin,\" she said, \"tell me\ntruthfully, can we really reach Mars? It is likely that we shall get\nthere before we go out?\"\n\n\"Certainly, darling,\" he replied, putting as much assurance into the\nwords and expression as was possible. \"Why do you ask?\"\n\nThere was something that suggested doubt, perhaps even displeasure in\nher answer: \"We have a duty to perform, Austin--a duty infinitely bigger\nthan our own petty existences. You have not seen what I have seen--small\nscouting patrols that came to the _Selba_ riding strange round things\nthat must have been machines of some kind. One look at those henchmen of\nAlkebar, their great black bodies, their quick nervous movements--like\neager panthers, their wicked-looking weapons which they carried with\nsuch an air of easy assurance, and you would have known what they hoped\nto do. Most of these devils are within the orbit of Mars for the first\ntime. Certainly Hekki has told you something about them?\"\n\nShelby nodded. \"Very little; but I have noticed a few of Alkebar's\nremarkable peculiarities,\" he said.\n\n\"Well,\" she continued, \"if we can't get to Taboor, there is one thing we\ncan do--destroy the _Selba_, and with it Hekki and Alkebar.\"\n\n\"Destroy the _Selba_!\" Shelby exploded, \"with what? Those toy machine\nguns on the nose of this bus? The bullets wouldn't even make noticeable\nscratches in the hide of that tough old girl.\"\n\n\"Not with the machine guns,\" Jan said slowly, \"with this flier! A little\nluck and it would work.\"\n\nThe idea flashed through Shelby's brain. Ram the _Selba_ at high speed!\nAbsolutely certain self-murder! A wave of tremendous admiration for the\ngirl came over him. She had something more in her favor than mere beauty\nand intelligence.\n\n\"Your idea is a pretty good one, Jan,\" he told her. \"But rest assured\nthat unless you can overpower me, it will never be put into execution.\nHowever, I'll tell you the truth: we have about a fifty-fifty chance of\nreaching the Red Planet alive.\"\n\nAnd so they tore on their way across the void while they watched the\ndial on the oxygen tank. They were racing with a tiny needle that crept\never nearer to the zero point that was its goal.\n\nBy allowing the pressure within the flier to drop to the lowest point\nthat they could endure, they managed to conserve considerable oxygen,\nfor then the rate of escape from the crevice the torpedo fragment had\nmade was naturally not so rapid.\n\nFrequently they examined the sky behind them, expecting momentarily to\ndiscover the tiny speck of flitting silver that would be the _Selba_.\nBut if the ship was pursuing them it had not yet come close enough to be\nseen.\n\nHowever, there was another, and perhaps greater menace which kept their\neyes turning this way and that, searching for signs of danger. Clusters\nof dully-glowing specks in any quarter of the heavens would be the first\nindications of its presence. They would grow larger, come hurtling on\nlike racing meteors in the sun's glow. Only there would be an odd wobbly\nmotion about their darting flight. Shelby tested the trips of the two\nmachine guns. Spurts of green flame plumed out of the muzzles.\n\nHe had set the radio transmitter in operation, and was sending\noccasional signals for assistance. But he knew that this was practically\na useless move. Hekalu had taken them far off the beaten track, and they\nwere still half a million miles from the Terrestro-Martian traffic lane.\nThe range of the transmitter of this craft was only ten thousand miles.\nEven if they had been much nearer the chances of their signals being\npicked up were slight.\n\nThe Martian disc was growing larger. It had become an ochre sphere\ndelicately ringed and mottled with greens and browns like a cloudy opal.\nThe flier was fairly eating up the distance.\n\nShelby had just said: \"I believe we're going to make it, Jan,\" and then\nthe signs which they had hoped would not appear came. Ahead of them and\na little to their right, a vague cluster of specks glimmered into view.\nIt wavered like a wisp of luminous smoke buffeted by a light breeze.\nThis was the one thing that distinguished it from a meteor cluster.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRapidly the individual points of light grew, becoming tiny stars that\nglowed by the reflected light of the sun. Within five minutes there was\nno longer any chance of mistaking their identity, for their flat\ndisc-like shapes and the half-human forms of the things that rode them\nwere already visible through the binoculars. They were approaching at\nterrific velocity. Both Jan and Austin knew them to be subjects of\nAlkebar. There was no mistaking their motive. Doubtless orders had been\nflashed to them from the disabled _Selba_.\n\nRealizing that these fleet space riders could easily catch up with his\nflier if they so chose, Shelby made no attempt to elude them. Instead he\nclung doggedly to the straight course toward Mars.\n\nThe twin machine guns, responding obediently to their directing\nmechanism, swung on their swivel toward the hurtling foes. Shelby peered\ninto the eye-piece of the \"sighter,\" a complicated arrangement of\nmirrors and lenses which enabled the pilot to always look directly\nthrough the ring-sights regardless of what direction the gun barrels\nwere pointing. He pressed the trips, and soundlessly, out in the vacuum\nof space, the guns went into action. Flickering green flames of\ndetonating radio-active explosive darted from their muzzles.\n\nAlmost immediately there were answering flashes among the approaching\nshapes, for the high-calibre bullets were also loaded with explosive.\nOne projectile took effect--another! Emerald flares of light, and\nnothing remained of two bold space men and their queer disc-like\nvehicles but torn fragments of flesh and metal.\n\nThe Space Men were very close now. Jan and Shelby could see the light\nflashing on their jeweled harnesses and on the weapons which they\nflourished defiantly. There must have been almost five hundred in the\nparty. Somehow their wild charge was vaguely reminiscent of a band of\nfierce Bedouin marauders, racing madly across the desert, bent on\npillage. Only it was the Arabs who suffered by this comparison, for the\ndesert of these mysterious Space Men was the whole of interstellar\nemptiness; and their forms and those of the things they rode, were the\nforms of the forces of Iblees himself.\n\nApparently these henchmen of Alkebar had some object in view other than\nthe mere destruction of the flier, for they made no move to use their\nweapons. They were pulling upon levers on their vehicles, checking their\nheadlong flight.\n\nNow they were coursing with the little craft, swarming about it, edging\nnearer, at the same time taking care to keep out of range of Shelby's\nguns.\n\nThere was a scraping against the hull and a light jolt as a talon\nsecured a hold on an eyelet ring. A black bulk dropped down on the nose\nof the craft. A pair of hands gripped the barrels of the machine guns,\nand with an easy tug, tore them from their mountings. There were\nshifting scratching sounds coming through the flier's light shell--heavy\nbodies moving about, and then a sudden ripping vibration. The control\nlever felt loose in Shelby's hand. He could no longer guide the vessel.\nAnd there was nothing either he or Jan could do except wait. The rocket\nmotors still purred evenly.\n\n\"I guess they've got us this time, Jan,\" the young man said to his\ncompanion. \"I wonder what they are going to do with us?\" He spoke as\ncasually as though this latest unfavorable turn of fortune was no more\nserious than the loss of a game of chess.\n\nJanice Darell was equally cool. \"Next time we win,\" she laughed. It is\nodd how human beings so often react to strange and terrifying\nsituations. \"I'm always ready, you see. Here I was crouching behind you\nthroughout the fight with this perfectly useless pistol in my hand,\nhoping foolishly that I might be able to use it. That's loyalty.\"\n\nThey fell to studying the two monsters which rested on the nose of the\ncraft in front of the pilot's observation window, where the guns had\nbeen. The Space Man was crouching out there trying to peer in at them.\nHe was very much like Alkebar--only not so large, and his equipment and\nadornment did not boast so many jewels.\n\nShelby felt a peculiar sense of the unreality of the creature. He looked\ninto its face and saw its eyes. Beside the left orb was a mottled area\nthat must have been a scar. It seemed as concrete as anything he had\never seen, and yet for the second time, he told himself that such a\ncreature wasn't possible!\n\nTime honored tradition had said: \"Life can exist only where there is\noxygen, water and warmth.\" And all three of the requisites were lacking\nin the void. Shelby realized that tradition might be wrong, but the\nquestion still remained: How did these creatures of space live? Whence\ncame the energy that kept their bodies functioning? If not from the\ncombustion of food with oxygen, then where? If there were no moisture in\ntheir bodies, and there certainly couldn't be, for it would have been\nfrozen in an instant and diffused through sublimation, how could vital\nfluids flow through their veins? He put these questions to Jan, but she\nshook her head.\n\n\"Hekki informed me that these people inhabited a region somewhere beyond\nMars, but he did not tell how it was that they could live in space,\" she\nsaid. \"It might be that they have had a development similar to\nterrestrial insects with the skeleton of armor enclosing their flesh.\"\n\nThe vehicles of the Space Men were even greater puzzles. How did they\nfly out here where the rocket was the only human invention that could\nmove? Many of the vehicles were visible now through the flier's windows.\nThey were disc shaped platforms of a strange lusterless metal. In the\ncenter of the top was an opening in which the Space Men sat. Projecting\nfrom the discs were a series of levers, permitting evidently simple\ncontrol. But no hint of their principle of operation was given. They\nemitted no rocket jets; no beams projected from them.\n\nAustin realized that there were many mysteries of the universe with\nwhich he was not acquainted; this was certainly one.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe sound of bodies moving about on the outer shell of the flier was\nstill audible. Presently there was a sharp explosion somewhere toward\nthe stern. The rockets immediately fell silent. The fugitives saw that\nsome of the Space Men were now busying themselves with long metal\ncables. Deftly and expertly they were looping them through the eyelet\nrings set at frequent intervals along the sides of the flier.\n\nThe other ends of the cables they fastened firmly to similar rings on\ntheir vehicles. They finished the job with all the efficiency of trained\nmilitary engineers. Then, with the small interplanetary vessel in tow,\nthe Space Men began to move off toward Mars, rapidly gaining momentum\nuntil their speed must have considerably exceeded that which most space\ncraft could equal. They deflected their course somewhat from the direct\npath to the Red Planet, probably to avoid a meeting with any wandering\nship.\n\nThroughout the fantastic voyage Shelby and Janice Darell found little to\ndo but stare dumbfounded at their weird captors and to watch the rapidly\ndropping needle of their oxygen supply-gauge. But as it proved, there\nwas little danger of suffocation, for the Space Men were making good\ntime.\n\nAnd so, after two hours of flying they came to Mars--not to Taboor\nwhich the fugitives had previously hoped to reach, but to a deep valley\nin the desert of the Taraal. The strange caravan circled around to the\nnight side of the planet, and then, slowly and carefully, but with a\nhint that they understood their work well, they proceeded to lower the\ndisabled craft through the atmosphere to the ground below.\n\nThe door of the flier was torn open like a paper thing, and a black\ngiant fully as huge and burly as Alkebar himself hustled the adventurers\nroughly out into the open.\n\nThe pock-marked face of Loo, the Martian name for their nearer moon, was\nin the sky, and by its light they could see hundreds of Space Men\ncrowding about them. Plainly this Martian colony was fairly well\npeopled, for there were many more than the five hundred who captured\nthem. The attitude of the onlookers was one of casual curiosity. For the\nmoment at least they were not showing the more brutal side of their\ncharacters.\n\nThe fugitives were given but a moment to look about, while their jailer\napparently carried on a silent conversation with one of his lieutenants.\n\nThey saw the sandy floor of the huge rectangular enclosure dotted with\nstrange mounds which must have been some kind of shelter, the encircling\nwalls crowned by square towers at regular intervals. Those walls were\namber-colored in the moonlight, and cast dense shadows that shifted\nvisibly as Loo raced in its meteoric course toward the east. Here and\nthere before the mounds huge vague shapes squatted. At the center of the\nenclosure a tall spire of silvery girders rose, supporting at its summit\na cone of a dull black substance. It looked like the creation of either\nEarthmen or Martians.\n\nBeyond the wall the rounded summits of desert hills, over which in ages\npast, a restless ocean had poured and flowed, were visible. In spite of\ntheir position the two young Earthians could not help but marvel at the\nsilent grandeur of this exotic scenery. A light though chilly desert\nwind blew refreshingly against their faces.\n\nThe black giant had kept a hand on each of his prisoners during his\nbrief conference, and now, none too gently, he guided them to the\nentrance of one of the mound dwellings. The Space Man ushered his\ncharges into a corridor, and then, fumbling with a curious lock he\nopened a heavy door and shoved them into the dim-lit room beyond. With a\nrattling clink the great stone panel closed behind them.\n\nA lump of self-luminous rock set in the stone ceiling gave a faint\nillumination to the bare interior. There was no furniture--only the\nsand-covered floor and rough rocky walls. On the floor a Space Man,\nlarger and more magnificently-muscled by far than any they had yet seen,\nsprawled. He was either unconscious or dead; they could not tell which.\nThere were hideous welts and gashes and half-healed scars all over his\nbody. The gashes were caked with a viscid purplish substance.\n\nWith the coming of the sudden Martian dawn which flashed through a\nnarrow embrasure high in the wall, the jailer returned. His first act\nwas to thrust the needle of what appeared to be a form of hypodermic\nsyringe into the arm of the unconscious Space Man. Then he led his\nEarthian captives out into the open.\n\nNeither Jan nor Austin were surprised when they saw the _Selba_\nsquatting near the base of the spire. Several Space Men, directed by the\nslave Koo Faya, moved about the ship, working the fueling pump.\n\nWalking down the gangplank which led up to the entrance of the vessel\nwas Alkebar, and beside him, Hekalu himself. The latter sauntered\nleisurely toward his captives, and the Chieftain moved off toward a\ngroup of Space Men standing some distance away.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nAnkova's Story\n\n\nThe Martian made a brief nervous sign to the jailer. \"Gently, Rega,\" he\nsaid. The Space Man relaxed his painful grip on his prisoners. The noble\nsurveyed them smiling. Defiantly, half contemptuously, Shelby was\nsmiling back.\n\nFinally, with a mocking casual air, Hekki spoke: \"There is a very\nancient saying on your planet,\" he said, \"to the effect that bad pennies\nalways return.\" The corners of his mouth twitched with sardonic\namusement. His manner grew more serious, yet still there was an\nundercurrent of sarcasm: \"Miss Darell and Mr. Shelby, I want to\ncompliment you on your remarkable cleverness and daring. Words cannot\nexpress my admiration for you. You have every right to be proud of\nyourselves.\"\n\nShelby nodded. \"We are,\" he told him drily. \"Is there anything more on\nyour mind?\" He turned away with an expression of bored contemptuous\nindifference.\n\n\"I have little to say except that we are about to continue our recently\ninterrupted journey tonight, Mr. Shelby,\" said the Martian.\n\nHe saw the Earthman and the girl casting interested glances at the disc\nvehicles that surrounded them everywhere.\n\n\"You like my people?\" Hekki inquired. \"You find them entertaining?\nPerhaps you have discovered things in their habits which you cannot\nunderstand. Shall I give you explanations?\" For the moment at least\nthere was a serious earnest ring in Hekalu's voice.\n\n\"Flag of truce, Jan. This should be interesting,\" Shelby said. His eyes\nwere full of eagerness as he turned back toward the Martian. \"How do\nthey live out there?\" he cried. \"There isn't any air or water, and it's\nalmost as cold as it can get anywhere. Why, the thing is utterly\nimpossible according to the laws of common sense!\"\n\nImmediately all of Hekalu's lazy air of careless mockery was gone, and\nthe dynamic aura of the tireless experimenter and inventor that had\nhidden beneath it showed out clear. His voice was husky with suppressed\nexcitement when he spoke:\n\n\"I too was dumbfounded when, some five Earth years ago, I first ran\nacross the Space Men out there. (He waved his hand toward the west away\nfrom the sun.) But after I had studied them for a time, I knew that\nthere was really nothing very remarkable or impossible about the nature\nof their living. It is actually quite similar to our own.\n\n\"Why do we need air? Simply because by the chemical combination of\noxygen with food we obtain the energy necessary to make our brains to\nthink, our limbs to move, and our hearts to beat. Energy is life. But\ndoesn't it occur to you that this vital thing might be obtained in some\nother manner? The Space Men do. Their principal food is the radio-active\nelement, atomic number 109, as yet undiscovered on the planets. It is a\npurplish liquid that is fairly abundant on a number of the planetoids.\nDaily, like radium, it gives off vast quantities of energy; and when in\nthe systems of the Space Men it supplies them with power more\nefficiently than food and oxygen ever could do for us.\n\n\"Why can't we survive the intense cold of space? The answer is a simple\none. The protoplasm of all forms of living things that we know of,\nincluding the Space Men themselves, is a colloidal jelly the principal\nportion of which is, and must be, a liquid. Cells must be bathed and\nnourished, and impurities washed away. Without liquids there seems to be\nno likelihood that there would be any life, unless in some manner a gas\ncould perform this fluid function. Solids would remain forever dead and\nmotionless.\n\n\"If anything happens to chill even slightly the protoplasm of any of the\nhigher forms of planetary life, the body fluid becomes sluggish and\ndeath may result. No mammals or birds that we know of can live actively\nwith their body temperatures at all approaching the freezing point of\nwater. However, in the polar seas of both planets there are creatures\nwhose systems function quite normally with their blood temperatures just\nabove this point. But beyond this deadline, zero degrees Centigrade, or\na little lower or higher, depending on the actual congealing point of\nthe water in their bodies, even they cannot go, for there, the cold\nlimit of Terrestro-Martian life has been reached.\n\n\"Why couldn't these polar fish survive the cold of space? Simply because\nthe protoplasm of their tissues, based on water, would instantly become\nsolid, and in solids as I have said, there can be no real life except\nperhaps in the form of suspended animation.\n\n\"The Space Men face no such danger, for first, their bodies are\nprotected by this heat-resisting outer covering; and second, the liquid\nin their veins freezes only at absolute zero, and since it is\nradio-active--producing heat from within itself--it cannot get that cold\neven in the void. And that, friends, is the whole stupendous, simple\nexplanation.\"\n\n\"And how do the Space Men's vehicles move?\" asked Jan.\n\nHekki shook his head. \"Except that a strange propulsive ray is involved,\nI know very little about it. I have not yet discovered how the Space Men\nmanage to produce the ray. The works of Nature ever surpass the works of\nman.\n\n\"And that is all I have time for now, my friends. Breakfast is ready\naboard ship. Enjoy my hospitality to the fullest!\" Hekki's mask of\nsmiling sardonic cruelty had dropped again. He waved something to Sega.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJanice, sensing that she was about to be separated from her lover, threw\nherself into his arms. The series of things she had gone through in the\npast twenty-four hours had frayed her nerves almost to the breaking\npoint.\n\n\"Don't let them take me away from you, Austin. Don't let them! Oh,\nHekki, please!\"\n\nHekalu's face reddened, and then Sega tore the two apart. Shelby\nstruggled but it was useless. Sega's huge muscles were quite equal to\nthe task of mastering a dozen of the best fighting men of Earth.\n\nHe dragged his captives aboard the _Selba_, and guided by the\ninscrutable Koo Faya, locked them in chambers from which escape would\nnow be definitely impossible. Jan was thrust into the room she had\noccupied before, but Shelby was put into a chamber somewhat larger than\nhis original prison.\n\nAn almost ungovernable fury had taken possession of the young Earthman.\nIf for only a moment he could get his hand on the smooth Hekalu! His\nfingers clutched and unclutched spasmodically as he hurriedly paced the\nroom. When presently, he found himself hammering on the walls with the\nfrenzy of a trapped gorilla, a realization of where he was headed came\nto him. \"Stop where you are, you fool!\" he muttered to himself.\n\nHe went to the table where an appetizing breakfast was set out. He ate a\nlittle and then waited a while. He wanted to make sure that the food was\nnot drugged. Half an hour passed and he felt no ill effects. He ate the\nrest of his breakfast. Then he made several attempts to signal Jan by\ntapping on the walls, but he was quite sure that to get a message to her\nin this way was now out of the question.\n\nFor a long time he gazed out into the sunlit valley floor from his\nwindow. Preparations of some kind were under way. It looked as though\nthe entire population, which must have numbered close to fifteen hundred\nSpace Men all told, was getting ready to move away _en masse_. Scores of\nthe strange black people were hurrying about, lugging loads of weapons\nand hundreds of large cylindrical objects into four immense box-like\nthings of dull metal. Several vehicles, resembling machines of the Space\nMen, but many times larger, were clustered together in a group.\n\nIt must have been several hours after Shelby had been taken into the\nspace ship that two of Alkebar's people came to his room, carrying\nbetween them the unconscious form of the Space Man who had been Jan's\nand his fellow prisoner during the night of their arrival on Mars. They\nthrew the limp giant down carelessly on one of the bunks, and without a\nglance at him or the Earthman, they stamped out.\n\nShelby would have liked to examine his cell mate more closely, but owing\nto the chain which had again been fastened to his ankle, it was\nimpossible to get nearer to him than four yards. Who was this creature?\nHis gorgeously bejeweled harness and his huge size seemed to indicate\nthat he had been a leader of some kind. Shelby had noticed that all\nSpace Men who had a right to command, were somewhat larger than their\nfellows.\n\nAll through the long Martian day Shelby paced the length of his tether,\npausing occasionally to look out of the window and to think. By\nnightfall he was in a state bordering upon complete dejection. Not that\nhe was weak; Shelby could face trying situations shoulder to shoulder\nwith the stubbornest and cleverest men that Earth or Mars could produce.\nBut he was human and had his limitations. Recapture after a glowing\npromise of freedom and safety for his people, his love, and himself had\nalmost crushed him.\n\nOnly half interestedly he wondered when Hekalu Selba would strike. He\nknew that it would be very soon. In vain he tried to tell himself that\nhe had no real proof of the Martian's power, but always a vision of\nthose black horrors swooping down like living thunderbolts upon Taboor\nor New York or Chicago made him realize how futile would be any\nresistance that the planets could offer.\n\nEven if there were but fifteen hundred Space Men, and Shelby was certain\nas actual knowledge that there were many more, and even if they must\nfight with their bare hands, still they would be a formidable menace.\nWithin an hour's time they could strike in a dozen different places on\nthe surface of a planet. Shelby did not know that already there were\nforces of Fate in action which neither he nor Hekalu Selba himself had\nbeen able to foresee--forces however, which boded no good for the\nworlds.\n\nKoo Faya brought the Earthman his noonday and evening meal. With each\ncame a note from Hekalu, both exactly alike: \"Remember the Atomic Ray.\"\nDoubtless the Martian sought by endless repetition of this message to\nundermine his captive's nerves to a point where he would divulge the\nsecret.\n\nAt dusk there was the sound of activity aboard the _Selba_--muffled\nshouts and the drone of generators being tuned up. Then the slow rocking\nand swaying of the vessel which told that her levitator plates were in\naction, raising her off the ground, through the atmosphere and out into\nthe void.\n\nShelby looked out of the window, saw that the stars were growing\nbrighter and the sky blacker. A searchlight was playing from somewhere\non the ship, for in the shadow of the planet it was very dark. The beams\nswung back and forth stabbing through the swarms of Space Men who flew\nin a cluster about the _Selba_. The lights lingered for several instants\non the forms of four great metal cubes that were being lifted up through\nthe gaseous envelope of Mars by a number of the larger discs the\nEarthman had seen resting beside them in the valley that day.\n\nShelby threw himself upon his bunk. He gave one quick glance at the blob\nof darkness on the other bunk at the farther end of the room, wondered\nvaguely who or what the creature could be, and then, mentally and\nphysically exhausted, went quickly to sleep.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen he awoke Shelby spent many minutes staring at his fellow prisoner.\nThere were indications that his consciousness was returning for he\nstirred frequently. Presently he who had been the Earthman's and the\nmysterious one's jailer in the hut the night before, came, bearing a\nbowl filled with a purplish radio-active liquid which served the Space\nMen as food. He also carried a hypodermic syringe and a small glass\ncontainer partially filled with a clear fluid.\n\nThese last two articles he placed upon the table, while he carried the\nbowl over to his charge. He shook the lacerated and bejeweled Space Man\nroughly and when he had aroused him to a sluggish half-consciousness,\nheld the bowl of liquid food to his lips. Mechanically the prisoner\ndrank.\n\nShelby looked at the tiny vial on the table and then at the back of the\njailer. Close beside the vial stood a glass partially filled with water.\nThe Earthman had drawn a drink from the tap shortly before going to\nbed, and had left the tumbler standing there.\n\nThe idea that had now entered his head had no real purpose. He\nrecognized it as no more than a practical joke, plain and simple; but\nthe idea was clamoring for attention. He would pour out the drug, which\nwas almost certainly meant to keep the giant captive senseless, and\nreplace it with harmless water. The jailer would not see for he was very\nbusy. A little noise, the rattling of the chain or the tinkling of the\nglass as it was set down, would not matter, for though the Space Men may\nhave possessed a very delicate touch sense capable of detecting faint\nvibrations in solid objects about them, Shelby knew by now that they had\nno real organs of hearing.\n\nAnd so, quickly the deed was done, and quickly he returned to his bed\nfeigning sleep.\n\nIt was a long time after the jailer had departed before Shelby's trick\nbore fruit. The huge prisoner rose to a sitting posture and looked\nabout, a trifle dazedly at first. He surveyed his wounds, felt over\nhimself tentatively, and then glanced at Shelby. The Earthman saw that\nthe fogginess was clearing from his big eyes. There was a questioning\nexpression in them.\n\nShelby thought that there was a slight chance that the colossus might be\nable to read his lips even though he could not hear. \"Who are you?\" he\nquestioned in Pagari.\n\nApparently the creature understood, for immediately he turned, and with\nhis forefinger slowly traced out on the wall behind him in the planetary\nsymbols: \"Friend of enemies of Black Emperor and of Man from Fourth\nWorld.\"\n\nShelby was taken aback by the Space Man's startling knowledge of things\nof which he should know nothing. \"That makes me your friend,\" he wrote,\nsmiling.\n\nThe giant nodded, and for almost a minute stared fixedly at the\nEarthman. There was a strange appeal in his eyes. Finally he turned, and\nlaboriously he traced a quaintly worded message on the wall: \"Think hard\nto know what I go say,\" he wrote.\n\nShelby had heard a good deal about telepathy and thought transference,\ndepending on etheric vibrations of some kind, supposedly originating in\nthe mind of one individual, and capable of being detected and\ninterpreted by the mind of another. Several savants of Earth and Mars\nclaimed to be adept with it, but owing to the fact that to master the\nart required a long period of intensive practice, it had not come into\ngeneral use.\n\nCould it be that this savage of the void was claiming knowledge of it?\nSensing the meaning back of the odd words, the Earthman bent every fibre\nof his will to the task of concentrating on the idea of communication.\nHe gazed fixedly at the eyes of the black mystic, and presently felt a\nslight tingling about his temples, and then, within his brain it seemed\nthat a tiny voice speaking with a queer wording and a peculiar accent,\ncame to life. It was odd to look at that blank impassive face and hear\nthose words!\n\n\"I know you to be friend of mine,\" the voice said. \"I read it in brains.\nYou free me from sleep. But where are we? What Fourth World Man do? What\nfor you here?\"\n\nBriefly Shelby outlined the events of the past few days, starting with\nhis meeting with Hekalu. However, he was careful not to make any mention\nof the Atomic Ray. Then, partially through curiosity, and partially in\nthe hope that the information might be helpful, he mentally asked his\ncompanion to tell him more about the Space Men's relations with the\nMartian.\n\n\"Everything maybe all right,\" said the giant. \"Maybe everybody happy at\nlast. Who know? But I tell you. We Star People--my people Star People.\nFor a long time, oh, for very long time, we wander out there in empty\nplaces. One million year, two million year, who know? We free. Maybe\nfind little planet--we camp there--soon go away. We fight, we hunt. Oh,\nthere very many of us! Like sand in sky!\n\n\"One day some of us find your sun. We land on little world. Stay long.\nMan from Fourth World come in ship. We frightened, but he make friends.\nBring us gifts. We give jewels and things we make. He learn our sign\nlanguage--talk with us--tell about his world. Go away but soon come\nback. Bring more gifts--want more jewels and things. He take some of us\nwith him to empty desert where nobody live. Tell us to bring jewels\nthere to trade, but always be careful no one see!\n\n\"He make friends with Black Emperor. They plan. Gather big army. But\nmany not like Black Emperor and Fourth World Man. My father, big noble,\nnot like them; I not like them. They never good to us--make our people\nwork hard, and take away our animals.\n\n\"Civil war soon--my father lead many little tribes, but Black Emperor\nand Man from Fourth World win. Have many strange weapons. Make peace for\nbig conquest war, and I am hostage on Fourth Planet.\n\n\"Mars man good to me at first. I learn languages--both Pagari and Earth\nlanguage. I learn to throw thoughts. My father learned from Mars slave.\nThen bad things happen. Fourth World Man not like me to throw thoughts\nto my father so far away. He give me sleep drug. When my father lead\nrevolt again, Mars Man torture me. Now, as you say, he take me back to\nplace where army is, on two little worlds.\"\n\nA gleam of hope came into Austin Shelby's eyes, but it passed quickly.\nHis lips curled bitterly. It was not well to base one's hope on the\nassertion of an unknown savage that he could hurl his thoughts across\nmillions of miles of space.\n\n\"By what name are you known, Man of the Void?\" he asked.\n\nThe voice in his brain spoke again: \"Mars Man call me Ankova.\" Here the\ngiant made a darting gesture with his hand. \"Mean same as so in my sign\nlanguage--Darting Meteor.\"\n\n\"I see. Can you communicate with your father now, Ankova?--get help?\"\n\nThe Space Man nodded. \"My brain clear now,\" he said. \"Sleep drug not\nbother me any more. I talk right away.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nThe Battle in Space\n\n\nHe lay back on the bunk and for several minutes stared fixedly up at\nnothing. The performance was reminiscent of the seance of an ancient\nspirit meeting. He sat up, and again his big eyes fastened themselves\nupon Shelby, and the uncanny voice spoke in the Earthman's brain:\n\n\"I get father. He on scouting expedition--very close. He bring five\nthousand men to rescue you and me. They get here maybe three, four\nhours. My father--his army same weapons as Black Emperor's. Flash,\nflash--all gone--everything gone.\"\n\nThere was the sound of movement beyond the door. Shelby waved his hand\nin a quick downward gesture which Ankova interpreted correctly. He\nslumped limply upon the bedding in a very excellent counterfeit of\nunconsciousness. And then Hekalu Selba entered. His face was white as\nchalk, and yet there was nothing in it that hinted even of a trace of\nfear--only icy calm. Behind him was Sega.\n\n\"Mr. Shelby,\" the Martian said with slow cool deliberation, \"think well.\nEither you will reveal the secret of the Atomic Ray immediately or I\nshall have you immersed in the juice of the flame flowers.\"\n\nAustin Shelby met Hekalu's chilly stare with a taunting smile. He sensed\nin the Martian's manner that his plans had met with some serious danger.\n\n\"Though I am your prisoner,\" he told him, \"I believe that I can defy\nyou. In the first place I do not fear the tortures that you might\ninflict upon me.\" Here he took a tiny glass capsule from his sleeve\npocket and placed it in his mouth. \"I do not mean by that that I am\nsuper-human, that I can endure any pain. But should the torture become\nunbearable I would crunch the poison vial which I have carried since I\njoined the Sekor fraternity back on Mars, between my teeth and bring\ndeath. That, I am not afraid of. Besides, I could give you the formulas\nfor almost any number of unknown compounds, any one of which might be\nthe missing crystal for all you might know. It would be several hours\nbefore you would discover that I had not given you the right one.\"\n\nThe Martian's face grew even whiter and harder at these words. Thoughts\nand plans flashed through his mind. Should he tell the Earthman what had\nhappened--that Alkebar, the Black Emperor, had secretly slipped through\nthe air lock into space?--that he was certainly intent upon conquering\nthe planets alone? It would not be hard to convince the Earthman that\nthe savage Alkebar would be an infinitely more terrible and ruthless\nmaster than any human being ever could be. Perhaps he could win Shelby\nto his side for as long as he needed him. He was wavering, and then,\nwith the sudden rush of inspiration a better idea came.\n\n\"I have told you many times that you are clever, my friend,\" he said\nwith some slight show of his old careless air. \"Again I compliment you.\nBut listen carefully: suppose I took the girl--put her in the gentle\nembrace of the juice of the flame flowers--told you to produce a formula\nthat would work before I released her?\"\n\nThe effect on the Earthman was electrical, but it was not quite what\nHekalu Selba had expected. The blood red haze of murder rushed before\nAustin Shelby's eyes, and with movements more suggestive of a wounded\npanther than a human being he leaped from the bunk and tore for the\nMartian with flailing fists. He gave no thought to the idea that what\nHekki had said might be only a histrionic gesture.\n\n\"Oh, God!\" he shrieked raspingly, \"You Devil! You unutterable stinking,\nrotten fiend!\" But it was a wild useless move. Hekalu was lightening\nquick and sure with the pistol. He inflicted death, or merely produced a\ndisabling wound almost at will. And so it was that Shelby sprawled\nsenseless on the floor with a nasty though not very dangerous bullet\nwound across the side of his head.\n\nSega and the Martian were bending over him, and then again the\nunexpected happened. An ebony form whose great hands and incredible\nmuscles seemed quite equal to the task of tearing a gorilla limb from\nlimb, arose from the other bunk and towered over the Prince of Selba and\nhis Space Man companion.\n\nThe former, hearing a slight sound, turned, and realizing his peril\nfired two shots at the mountainous monster. Then he darted agilely for\nthe door. He gave one quick backward look--saw the hand of Ankova\ndescending with trip-hammer force upon the skull of Sega, and then\nslammed the stout portal behind him.\n\nSega had been unfortunate, but now all his troubles were over for his\nneck was broken. Ankova transferred to his own belt the weapons of the\ncorpse--his heavy pistol--his case of atomic grenades--his bejeweled war\nclub. Then he devoted his attention to Shelby.\n\nGently he carried him to the bunk and made awkward attempts to bandage\nhis head with strips torn from the bedding. Satisfied at last with the\ncrude but effective results of his efforts, he strode to the window.\n\nFor a long time he stood there, staring. But he saw nothing that\ninterested him. The ether all about was crowded with Space Men coursing\nwith the _Selba_. Except for a gentle swaying shifting movement they\nseemed to hang perfectly motionless in the void, and yet their speed was\nmany miles a second.\n\nThe fantastic cavalcade aroused no wonder in the mind of Ankova, for to\nhim they were as prosaic and commonplace as the grass under the feet of\nany Earthian. He cocked his head on one side as though listening.\nPerhaps at that moment something was coming to him from across the\nendless regions of the etheric desert--something which only his\nincredibly refined telepathic sense could detect.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis unshod feet sensed the faint vibration in the metal floor. Someone\nwas approaching the room. First taking the precaution of tearing\nShelby's chain from the wall, he turned and waited before the door with\nready war club. He did not wait long for it banged open almost\nimmediately. A Space Man appeared. Behind him were others.\n\nAnkova did not ask their mission for he saw that they wore the insignia\nthat meant loyalty to the man from the Fourth World. Instead he leaped\nin to close quarters. His whirring war club, toothed with sharp spikes,\nripped and tore at the head and shoulders of the unfortunate warrior.\nFalteringly, the creature tried to parry the blows with his own weapon;\nbut it was useless. Before he was able to attain his fighting stride he\nwas down, the purple radio-active liquid that flowed in his veins in\nlieu of blood, dyeing the threshold. His lips curled in a grimace of\nagony, but he made no sound--mute he had lived and he died in the same\nmanner.\n\nAnkova stepped over the prostrate form and engaged the one who had stood\nbehind him. The second Space Man fared little better. He made but a\nbrief and unsuccessful defense and then he too went down. And so Ankova,\nwho before his capture had won fame among the tribes of the Star People\nas one of the mightiest fighters that their race had ever produced,\nbattled on in the narrow passage until the seven Space Men whom Hekalu\nhad sent to put him and Austin Shelby under restraint were either dying\nor dead.\n\nThe victor glanced down the corridor--saw at the farther end a small\nportion of the control room's interior. Koo Faya, the Martian, was\nthere, working with demoniac haste over switches and dials.\n\nAnkova drew his pistol, started to aim at the slave, and then thought\nbetter of it. There was a tenseness within the hull of the\n_Selba_--something which made a deep impression on Ankova's keen\nintuition. His muscles tautened and a tingling sensation rippled over\nhis ebony hide. The vibrations of the rocket motors were more noticeable\nthan usual. Evidently the ship was tearing along at the greatest speed\nit could attain. And it swayed unnaturally.\n\nAnkova knew the layout of the _Selba_ well, for he had traveled in it\noften. And now he sensed quite clearly what was happening. He hurried to\na supply room and selected a space armor from a rack. His Earthman\nfriend might need it. Then he dashed back to the room In which he and\nShelby had been imprisoned.\n\nA glance out of the window confirmed his suspicions as to what was going\non. The force of Space Men which was acting as an escort for the _Selba_\nhad arranged itself in a sort of spherical protecting network around the\ncraft. Another and superior force was attempting savagely to pierce this\nformation. The foes of Hekalu's henchmen would draw themselves into\ncone-shaped groups and rush the defenders, and the latter would swarm\nover the cones like angry and determined hornets. A hot fight was in\nprogress out there. The ether was lit with green flashes of light, and\nfragments of the bodies of Space Men and their vehicles already strewed\nthe void. In this running battle the _Selba_ was not idle. Her torpedoes\nwere exploding among the attackers with blinding glares of light.\n\nAnkova wondered who the would-be destroyers of the _Selba_ were. Clearly\nthey were not the forces of his father, for they had not yet had time to\narrive. Some stray tribe perhaps. He wished that he might see their\ninsignia, but owing to their distance from the ship and their eccentric\nmovements, this was impossible. He did not know that they were the\nminions of Alkebar who had turned enemy to Hekalu but a few hours\nbefore.\n\nThe Space Man realized that for the time being he was safe enough, but\nhe took the precaution of planning for escape from the ship should it\nbecome necessary. He eyed the heavily glazed porthole. A few deft blows\nwith his war club would shatter that. Beyond, there were a few discs\nwithout Space Men circling about. With luck it would be possible to\ncapture one. First he barricaded the door with metal bars torn from the\nbunks, and then put the space armor on the still senseless Earthman.\nThen there was nothing to do but wait.\n\nThe battle was going against the defenders. Shattering concussions of\natomic projectiles banging against the _Selba's_ hull made the hurtling\nvessel pitch and roll frightfully. The thunder of shells waxed and\nwaned.\n\nIt must have been over two hours later that a huge torpedo set in motion\nby the forces of the Black Emperor, struck the ship. The explosion\nrolled her completely over, and tore a jagged though not disabling hole\nin her side. The air puffed out from the control room compartment, but\nthe men who labored so feverishly there, were clad in heavy space armor,\nand aside from being badly bruised they were unhurt.\n\nThe torpedo was the last gesture of the Alkebarians. Ankova saw a cloud\nof luminous specks approaching from the void at terrific velocity. They\ngrew rapidly brighter. A blue and an orange star shot up from their\nmidst--the identification signal of Telaba, Ankova's father. That signal\nwas quite enough for the Black Emperor's men. Without waiting to argue\nthey turned and fled. So quickly did they go that Telaba's warriors were\nunable to identify them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe rebel tribesmen were checking their speed now, preparing to fight.\nBut still they came on apparently like hurtling comets. They swept the\nremnants of Hekalu Selba's loyalists before them in one terrific charge,\nand then they were swarming over the _Selba_ and through the rent in her\nside. There was a brief flurry of pistol shots from the crew before they\nwere captured and bound.\n\nIn a prison compartment aft, Austin Shelby had regained his senses\nsufficiently to have a vague idea of what was going on around him.\nAnkova was supporting him, and he was staggering toward the door. His\nmind took up a train of thought from where it had left off. He was\ncalling for Jan and cursing Hekalu. Cased as his head was, in an oxygen\nhelmet, his shrieking voice was magnified a dozen times, and assumed a\nweird vaulted quality that startled him back to sensibility.\n\nAnkova read his thoughts, and by telepathy replied to him: \"Your lady? I\nforget. But we find her. She all right--sure!\"\n\nThe Space Man removed the barricade and opened the door. The sudden\noutrush of air from the room almost toppled Shelby from his feet. And\nthen the Earthman heard a familiar voice in the head-phones of the radio\nwith which his helmet was equipped: \"I'm in X7, Austin. Let me out if\nyou can.\"\n\n\"Janice!\" he cried, and with new vigor hurried to the door of the room\nshe had mentioned.\n\nAnkova smashed the lock with his war club and the portal flew open. Jan\nwas standing there encased in space armor. She was trying hard to smile.\n\n\"You're safe, darling!\" Shelby cried, \"And I thought that that fiend was\ngoing to hurt you!\"\n\n\"My luck,\" she said. \"Koo Faya was thoughtful enough to bring this space\narmor, otherwise, I wouldn't have been fit to look at any more.\" She\npointed to a shattered window. \"And you--heaven's how you can yell--and\nswear! I am ashamed of you!\"\n\nHer eyes widened when she looked at Ankova, but Shelby reassured her.\n\"This is Ankova, and he is our friend--big shot, too,\" he said. \"And\nJan, I guess we're free now--really free.\"\n\nUgly Space Men, some of them gashed and wounded, crowded about as though\nbent on destroying the two feeble Earthians. But with imperious gestures\nAnkova waved them back. He conversed by signs with these warriors of his\nfather, and then took Janice Darell and Austin each by the arm.\n\n\"Big surprise,\" he told them. \"Come.\"\n\nHe led them to the control room. And there, in the grip of a black\ncolossus was Hekalu Selba--captive. The Martian nodded perfunctorily to\nthe girl and then turned his level gaze toward the man. His face showed\nno hint of anger, and it seemed that a shadow of a smile twinkled about\nhis lips.\n\n\"Here we have a contrast, Mr. Shelby,\" he said quietly, \"triumph and\ndisaster staring at each other!\"\n\nShelby told him that he should be wreaking vengeance on the noble for\nthe numerous wrongs he had done him, but the calm unflinching attitude\nof the Prince of Selba made him almost like the captive.\n\nShelby waved the Martian's captors back and he stood free. \"There is no\ncontrast now, Akar Hekalu, for an outsider could not tell which was\nwhich!\"\n\nAs Hekki's jailer led him away, Shelby, assisted by Janice Darell,\nbusied himself with the ship's controls.\n\nAnd so the battered _Selba_ escorted by five thousand Space Men set out\nfor a certain minor planet where were amassed the forces of Telaba,\ninsubordinate vassal of the Black Emperor. And on another planet was\nAlkebar, the Black Emperor himself, ready to hurl his shock troops, a\nhorde five million strong, at the planets.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nThe Revolt of Alkebar\n\n\nThe light of a shrunken sun shone down coldly and ineffectually upon a\njagged and distorted landscape. Along the horizon, which was strangely\nabrupt, twisted gray hills loomed up with harsh clearness against a\nblack starlit sky. There was no atmosphere to soften their lines, nor\nto dull the needle-like points of deepest sable that were their shadows.\n\nIn the foreground, which was a fairly level plain, were hundreds of\nhemispherical shelters hastily built from loose fragments of rock. A\nvast horde of Space Men hemmed them in. The sunlight glistened on the\nebony hides of the warriors and on their polished accouterments and\nweapons. Some of these rebels of the void were greedily drinking the\npurple radio-active liquid which meant life and strength to them, and\nattendants were hurrying about carrying large canisters of the food to\neach unit of Telaba's army. Most of the men crouched expectantly beside\ntheir discs, waiting.\n\nIn a small metal building, which the Man from the Fourth World had\nrecently had constructed for his own use, four people were gathered. Two\nwere Space Men, and two belonged to the green planet called Earth. One\nof the Space Men was talking, not with his mouth for he had no vocal\ncords, but by means of fine mental vibrations which caused a feeble\nhigh-pitched voice to speak within the minds of the Earthians.\n\n\"I owe you great debt of gratitude, Mr. Shelbee--you help to save my son\nfrom Alkebar and Fourth World Man. Telaba do not forget this. I do what\nI can. But that is little. Black Emperor start to smash Earth and Mars\nsoon. Perhaps right now. Perhaps in hour. Who know? Spy send signal any\ntime now. We outnumbered ten to one. Alkebar crush us, wipe us out like\nthat!\" He slapped his palms sharply together. \"But we do what we can,\nEarthman.\"\n\nShelby took Telaba's cold hand for a brief hearty handshake. \"Thanks,\nTelaba,\" he said simply. \"Jan and I certainly appreciate what you are\ngoing to do for us and our people, and I know that if we are successful,\nthe worlds shall be mighty grateful too. They have ways of showing their\ngratitude. But don't be so sure that we are going to fail. We have the\n_Selba_, you know, and a new weapon that has never before been used.\n\n\"Hekalu was good enough to construct an immense projector for us. Except\nfor the resoldering of a few wires, and the insertion of a tiny but\nimportant crystal which I happen to be carrying with me, it was complete\nand ready for operation.\n\n\"The ship is fueled and ready for action at any moment. When the word\ncomes and we set out, annoy the forces of Alkebar, but do not engage or\nmix with them any more than you have to. I'll be somewhere around, ready\nand glad to spray them.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, 'I'?\" Jan put in. \"It's 'we,' because I am going\nalong!\"\n\nShelby knew that the undertaking he had in mind was but an ace from\ncertain death; but he did not argue with the girl. Her cool wit and\nnerve would be very helpful, and besides there was little choice, for\ndeath was grimly in pursuit of all of them.\n\n\"Right you are, soldier,\" he said laughingly. \"My mistake!\"\n\nA red light bulb flashed on the wall, and then, without waiting for\npermission, a Space Man rushed into the room, his arms waving wildly,\nforming frantic signs of the Star People's deaf mute language. Bent in a\nhalf crouch, his great arms flexed, Ankova translated for the benefit of\nthe Earthians:\n\n\"Fourth World Man escape--in _Selba_. We are betrayed--someone help him.\nHe out of sight already. Going to help Black Emperor. And now red star\nburns in space--spy's warning--Alkebar forces start!\"\n\nTelaba rushed to a big lever and pulled it. Immediately a huge trip\nhammer began to pound ponderously on a metal plate set in the ground\noutside the building--sending vibrating pulsations out through the crust\nof the planetoid--the alarm signal which would be sensed by everyone of\nTelaba's men, telling them to be ready for instant action.\n\nThe four looked at one another. Each knew what this last move of the\nPrince of Selba meant, but no one thought for a moment of giving up the\nfight.\n\n\"It won't do any good to pursue the Martian,\" Shelby cried. \"That ray\nprojector of his--he'd blast us out of existence. All we can do is try\nto hinder Alkebar's invasion--seek to delay him. If I could only somehow\nget through to Mars with the secret of the Atomic Ray! Telaba, haven't\nyou a ship capable of carrying a large enough oxygen supply to last me\nfor the journey?\"\n\n\"Never mind!\" Ankova cut in. \"I go! Many times I been to Mars. Give me\nplans. I go right away. I get them to fight.\"\n\nShelby drew from his sleeve pocket the black case containing information\nconcerning the Atomic Ray which he had recovered from Hekalu Selba at\nthe time of the Martian's capture. He opened it, and with his stylus\nadded a brief message to the mass of notes inside, and wrote down the\nformula for a certain complex chemical compound. Then he handed the case\nto the Space Man.\n\n\"Take it to Alman Mak in the Checkald of Taboor if you can, Ankova. Good\nluck.\"\n\nThe son of the rebel chief hurried from the room with the missive in his\nhand. Shelby knew in his heart that to attempt to get Earth and Mars\ninto action in time was a useless gesture, but he could not suppress a\nthrill of admiration for this wild son of the void. There was hard\nmettle in Ankova's makeup, hard and true. And most of them were like\nthat--most of Telaba's men anyway.\n\n\"You two come with me,\" Telaba was saying. \"We fight together. Put on\nspace suits.\" He was tapping an instrument resembling a telegraph key.\nIn unison with his movements the heavy signaling hammer sounded out\norders and commands to his forces.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen the Earthians had eased themselves into their heavy protecting\nattire, Telaba led the way down a spiral stair and through an air lock,\nout into the open. Here everything was grim silent activity. Group after\ngroup of mounted Space Men poured skyward. Telaba's army was a mighty\nthing; with luck it might have beat down the resistance of either one of\nthe two planets. But when compared with Alkebar's colossal horde, it\npaled into pitiful insignificance.\n\nNearby, a space disc, which must have measured fully two hundred feet in\ndiameter, rested. The three mounted the light ladder which led to the\ninterior.\n\nIn the metal walls were mounted two heat-ray projectors of Martian\ndesign, as well as several torpedo catapults and machine guns. Two Space\nMen were inspecting them.\n\nTelaba signaled to the driver who knelt with lever in hand. The great\ndisc trembled and the propelling force which no human being had yet\nlearned how to produce, sent it and its burden hurtling toward the\nstars. The minions of the rebel chief circled and swirled about their\ncommander's ship in wild soundless salute.\n\nTelaba was operating the signaling mechanism which fired lights of\nvarious colors up through the roof of the armored coach, and in reply to\nhis flashing commands, his horde formed a monster cone which shot with\never increasing speed through the void.\n\nA sickening giddiness came over the two Earthians, for there were no\ndevices to produce artificial gravity here. It was the space nausea\nwhich had made early interplanetary travel such a nightmare. The Star\nPeople, born where gravity is almost unknown, were of course not\naffected in the least.\n\nClinging to stanchions and hand grips to keep themselves from floating\nfree, Janice Darell and Austin crept about the floor examining the\nweapons and scanning space ahead for signs of the enemy. They disliked\nto admit to each other that they were very sick; but if they thought\nthat it was possible to forget the retching pains in their stomachs by\ndiligent devotion to other things, they were mistaken.\n\nTheir suffering continued until Jan remembered that the force of this\nalmost forgotten malady could be reduced by lessening the amount of\noxygen taken into the lungs. A few turns of the intake valves of their\nhelmets accomplished this, and they soon felt much better.\n\nIt was a long time before there were any indications of the near\npresence of the enemy. Ahead, two asteroids glowed, a dull red. One was\nquite close; the other farther away. It was Shelby, peering steadily\nthrough his binoculars, who first discovered the glowing cloud, thin and\nfaint like the nebulous substance of the Milky Way, pouring up like\nghosts' hair from the rounded pate of the nearer asteroid. He knew that\nit was made up of countless points of light, too small to be detected\nindividually. Not long afterward Telaba discovered a similar cloud\ncoming from the second of the minor planets.\n\nThe rebel chief's greatest advantage, if he had any at all, was that of\nsurprise. Because of its comparatively small size his force had probably\nnot yet been discovered by the enemy.\n\nCoolly he flashed the order for long-range bombardment formation.\nInstantly the army spread out, forming a thin rectangle whose broadest\nsurface was perpendicular to the line of firing between the opposing\nhordes.\n\nA second or two later the first rocket torpedoes of the rebels went,\nspewing fire, toward their goal. In a steady swarm others followed them.\nThe missiles were not radio controlled and fitted with tiny television\napparatus as were a few of the torpedoes employed by the Interplanetary\nTraffic Lane Patrol, but since the approximate range was known, it was\neasy to set the time fuses so that the atomic charges would explode in\nthe midst of the densely-packed enemy.\n\nWithout asking anyone's permission, the Earthians had appropriated a\npair of catapults and were working them like demons. As fast as they\ncould cram the ten-pound rockets into the breeches of the tubes, the\nprojectiles streaked out in flashes of green flame toward the nearest of\nthe nebulous clouds.\n\nShelby was sweating furiously from the exertion, and the moisture\nabsorption apparatus of his space armor was putting in some tough\nservice.\n\nOccasionally he glanced at Janice working beside him. Her face, visible\nthrough the glazed front of her helmet, was white and set--almost hard.\nAnd there was boundless determination in the firm curve of her little\nrounded chin. He liked her attitude, but it was better to take it easy\nuntil the real fighting began.\n\n\"Slow up a bit, soldier,\" he remarked into his transmitter. \"Powder your\nnose!\"\n\nHer face brightened as she turned toward him. \"I wish I could powder my\nnose,\" she said, pouting. \"Only I can't reach it!\"\n\n\"Too bad. These space suits rob a girl of so many of her exquisite\nlittle tricks.\"\n\n\"Well,\" she put in, \"I can still cover up my yawns with my hand if I\nfind this pastime too much of a bore.\" They both chuckled at this little\njoke.\n\nJanice took the last missile from the case she had been emptying and\nrammed it home. She jerked the lanyard, and with a thudding jolt the\ntorpedo was on its way. Then she paused to scan the horde of Alkebar\nthrough an observation port. \"Hurrah,\" she cried, \"we're scoring!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWithout discontinuing his hurried feeding of his smoldering piece,\nShelby looked up. The cloud had grown considerably in the few moments of\naction. It had cleared the asteroid now, and the other nebulous spot\nthat marked the position of the Black Emperor's second army, was coming\nup to merge with it. In the midst of the first cloud, hundreds of minute\nspecks of light were flashing--the atomic torpedoes were exploding. The\nsight reminded Shelby of what he had so often seen through the lens of a\nspintharoscope.\n\nAlkebar's army continued to increase rapidly in apparent size. It looked\nlike a monster amoeba. But now the amoeba was beginning to writhe,\nto swell up and grow dimmer. It shot out long sinuous pseudopods that\nseemed to grope angrily. Both Earthians sensed that the fight was about\nto begin in earnest.\n\nWith renewed vigor they fell to the task of loading and discharging the\ncatapults; and close beside them the two Space Men who acted as gunners,\nlabored coolly and methodically over their weapons, but with even\ngreater efficiency, for their training had been long and thorough.\n\nTelaba worked the levers of the signaling mechanism, and a brilliant\npurple star visible to all his henchmen shot up over the back of his\nbeast. They saw it and read its meaning. Spread out to avoid enemy fire!\nAs one man they obeyed, but they were none too soon. With abrupt\nsuddenness the maelstrom of silent flashing death was upon them.\n\nIt was a pretty sight to the Earthians--those soundless globes of green\nflame that glowed dazzling for an infinitesimal instant, on the rich\njewels and polished rifle barrels of the hordesmen coursing close by.\nBut they were not deceived.\n\nA Space Man vanished, torn to tiny fragments that mixed with the cosmic\ndust of the void. A huge disc, bearing a cylindrical battle car, was\nhit, and a jagged hole torn in its side. It twisted crazily, turning\nover and over. Austin and Jan felt the vibration of shell fragments\nbanging violently against their own vehicle.\n\nThe nearer nebulous cloud had ceased to be a cloud now. It had resolved\nitself into a myriad swarm of dim specks which the Earthians knew were\nSpace Men. Plainly Alkebar's minions were charging rapidly, bent on\nwiping Telaba's smaller force out of existence at one blow.\n\nThe bombardment doubled, tripled, quadrupled in intensity until it\nseemed that all space had turned to fire. Before the withering blast the\narmy of the rebel chief was speedily being dissolved into drifting\nwreckage.\n\nAn exploding torpedo ripped several yards of armor from one side of\nTelaba's vehicle and reduced one of his black gunners to a mangled pulp\nfrom which the purple fluid spurted.\n\nThe force of the concussion turned the great disc completely over.\nBattered and blinded by the green glare, which exceeded even the sun of\nthe void in intensity the Earthians tumbled against their weapons.\nJanice Darell started to scream but managed to check it--biting her lips\nsavagely.\n\nAn explosive rifle bullet struck the huge vehicle, and it wavered.\n\nShelby spoke to Telaba who was clinging firmly to a stanchion with one\nhand and operating his signaling machine with the other. \"Turn back,\nchief,\" the Earthman advised. \"Our only motive is to annoy them and\ndelay them. To continue this charge can mean nothing but destruction for\nour entire force.\"\n\nTelaba sensed the mental vibrations that went with Shelby's words. \"To\nturn back cannot do, Earthman,\" he said. And it seemed to the young\nengineer that there was a vibrant note of sadness in his telepathic\nvoice. \"Look! You see all guns and catapults point forward only. Not\nswing to rear--same on all gun cars. If run, not possible to shoot at\nchasing enemy. Then they get us. That Alkebar's idea so his men must\ntake offensive or die. He think that make them strong.\"\n\n\"But the riflemen are not so handicapped,\" Shelby persisted. \"We can die\nhere if necessary, but someone must live to carry on. Order them back!\"\n\nThe chieftain shook his bulbous head. \"To try what you say--useless.\nThey not desert comrades or king. If I command, they disobey.\" There was\na finality in his words which neither of the Earthians tried to dispute.\n\nSo that was it! Well, there was no sense wasting time talking. Shelby\ngripped a machine gun and sent a spray of explosive bullets ripping out\ninto the ether. Janice did likewise.\n\nAs they worked their weapons they spoke rapidly to each other. \"You\nunderstood what Telaba said? You know what that means?\" Shelby asked.\n\n\"Yes. It's about the end of our tape, but that's nothing. We've been\nfairly lucky. All we can do now is hope that Ankova wins through to Mars\nin time, and fight like--like--\"\n\n\"Hell!\" Shelby's words slipped between clenched teeth, and Jan flashed\nhim a quick smile even as their tracer streams crossed in the midst of a\ngroup of hurtling Alkebarians who had pressed too close together.\n\n\"Anyway, good luck!\"\n\n\"And the very best of luck to you!\"\n\nThe opposing forces were very close together now. The first of the\nAlkebarians were plainly visible--their long guns flashing--their ebony\narms waving signals which probably passed for shouts of triumph among\ntheir ranks.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nThe Coming of the Atomic Ray\n\n\nBoth armies had cut down their velocity enormously, but still they tore\nalong at breakneck speed. And they moved like true Cossacks of the void,\ndirecting their machines by deft motions on the mysterious levers. Now\ndiving, now climbing, now swinging this way and that to avoid the\nmissiles of their opponents, they tore on. And death was everywhere.\n\nNo torpedoes were flying now, but machine guns and rifles were working\nterrible havoc. And so the horde of Alkebar closed with the forces of\nthe rebel chieftain.\n\nThe machine which bore Telaba, directed by its skillful driver, dived\nand swung and zigzagged like a mad thing; but still the bullets rattled\nagainst the metal armor of the car. Its sides had been repeatedly\nstruck, yet owing to its tough shell, had not yet been disabled.\n\nEverywhere about it, mounted horrors whirled in an inextricable tangle,\nshooting and loading, and dying by the green flashes, their vitals\nstrewing the ether.\n\nTelaba had deserted his post at the signaling machine, for further\norders were useless. For his rebels at least, it was every man for\nhimself. He too was operating a machine gun.\n\nThe stars spun dizzily about the Earthians, as the machine beneath them\ncareened in its insane fight. Every time a Space Man wearing a red\ncircle on his breast crossed their sights, a burst spat from their hot\nweapons, frequently with good results.\n\nA group of at least twenty Alkebarians sought to attack from the blind\nspot at the rear. But the driver twisted levers with a quick jerk, and\nthe luckless riflemen found themselves facing four streams of steel.\nThose that could, darted out of range and renewed the attack from a\ndifferent angle.\n\nFrequently, throughout the battle, Shelby had wondered what had happened\nto Hekalu Selba and the Atomic Ray. Why wasn't he on hand to assist his\nally, the Black Emperor? Oh, well, regardless of whether the Martian was\nthere or not the outcome would evidently be the same--only now it would\nbe more dragged out.\n\nThe Earthian was surprised therefore, when suddenly the efforts of the\nenemy to exterminate them, which had been so intense in the brief\nmoments since they had closed, suddenly lessened. Alkebarians were\ndarting hastily toward the rear. Their actions did not suggest flight;\nit seemed that they were going to meet a new and more terrible enemy.\nThe rebels could wait.\n\nAnd the people of the rebel chief for the moment did not pursue--did not\neven fire. For they too saw! To the rear, in the center of Alkebar's\nhorde, came the dazzling flares of explosions. So many and so close\ntogether were they, that they looked like a titanic conflagration of\ngreen flame. Against the light, the silhouettes of confused and\nbewildered space riders careened, like frightened pollywogs. The\nholocaust moved--swung. It was like a tapered column of fire veiled by a\nfaint bluish haze.\n\nThe Earthians, Telaba, and the two remaining Space Men, forgetful of\neverything else, were staring in awed wonder at the phenomenon through\nthe forward observation bay. It was Shelby who found the first part of\nthe explanation.\n\n\"It's the Atomic Ray!\" he almost shrieked. \"Freeing the atomic energy in\nthe materials that make up the bodies of Alkebar's men--literally\ncausing their flesh and bones to explode! But how--what the devil--!\"\n\n\"Look!\" cried Jan. She pointed far up over their heads to where the cone\nof faintly bluish light swung, free from the milling horde. Up and up to\nits apex, and there hung what appeared to be a tiny cocoon of burnished\nsilver.\n\nThe girl peered through her binoculars for a long moment. \"I see the\nname. It is the _Selba_,\" she said. \"Hekalu has made a mistake--he's\nattacking the wrong force! Or--or some ally of ours has gained control\nof the ship!\" she hazarded.\n\n\"No time to make guess now,\" said Telaba. \"To fight, much better.\" He\nhad returned to the signaling mechanism, and was working it with cool\nefficiency, rallying his battered forces.\n\nLike tigers they fell upon the Alkebarians, shattering them out of\nexistence with a steady storm of rifle bullets. They met with only a\nweak resistance for the foe seemed to realize that the fates had played\nthem false. The blue ray had been their promise, and now, like the sword\nof their ancient god of destruction, it was weaving calmly this way and\nthat, snuffing them into nothingness. The Black Emperor's horde was\ndissolving, scattering.\n\nBattalions of terrified Space Men poured past the rebel chieftain's car,\nshooting only hurried and ineffective volleys at their enemies, who\npressed fiercely upon them. And never did Jan and Shelby miss a chance\nto spray them with searing bursts of machine-gun fire.\n\nThere was a lull. The Earthians took the opportunity to look up at the\nangel of death that was the _Selba_, far above. Most of Alkebar's huge\narmy had already perished, or had dispersed in flight into the desert of\nspace from which it had been recruited. But that the space ship would\npresently be engaged in a serious fight was evident.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA determined force which must have numbered a hundred thousand, was\nhurtling up at it, surrounding the craft with a halo of bursting\ntorpedoes. At the head of the body of Space Men was a huge beast bearing\non its back a car similar to Telaba's. Veri-colored signal stars spurted\nfrom it. Alkebar himself must be in it directing operations!\n\nCoolly the guiding hand aboard the _Selba_ was swinging his dreadful\nweapon this way and that, annihilating the attackers as one might\nannihilate a swarm of mosquitoes with a blowtorch. Half of them had\nalready been reduced to those basic, intangible vibrations which\nconstitute all substance. It was terrible, it was glorious; but what\ncould it all mean? Hekalu's ship!\n\nThe still formidable remnants of the vengeance squadron was seeking to\nclose in--to grapple with the vessel. The _Selba_ was trying to dart out\nof their way, but the speed of the Space Men, a gift of Nature, was\ngreater than that of this fastest ship designed by man. Grimly, in the\nface of almost certain death, they kept on. A score or so succeeded in\nlanding on the curving hull, and, like leeches they clung to it. The\nAtomic Ray arched angrily, cutting a deep swath through those who still\nsought a hold.\n\nAnd then the gleaming form of the _Selba_ was completely hidden by the\nswarm of enraged horrors that poured over it. The Atomic Ray was snuffed\nout. The beholders saw the air lock being pried open, and the Space Men\ncrowding into the interior of the craft. For a second the _Selba_\nwobbled crazily, and then her rocket motors ceased to flame.\n\n\"What are we waiting for? We have friends up there!\" Jan cried.\n\nTelaba flashed his orders, and the entire cavalcade charged toward the\nvessel, their guns spewing flame.\n\nIt was only a matter of a minute or so before that hurtling torrent of\nrebels had swept the Alkebarians from their prey. Those of the Black\nEmperor's men who had forced their way into the ship managed to hold the\nentrance for a short time, but under the urgings of their intrepid\nchief, the zealous rebels shot and hewed their enemies down as though\nthey had been paper marionettes. The way was clear.\n\nTelaba waved an order to his driver, and the space beast drew up\nalongside the _Selba_. Expectantly eager, the Earthians clambered\naboard, followed by the chief.\n\nThe ship was a shambles. Its corridors were littered with bodies of\nSpace Men who wore on their breasts the red circle which signified\nloyalty to the Black Emperor. Telaba's followers had done well.\n\nThe three made their way to the control room. Intuitively they had\nsensed what they would find there, and so, they were not surprised at\nwhat they saw--wreckage and the carcasses of Alkebar's warriors. The\nMartian had put up a stiff fight.\n\nShelby bent over the armored form of Akar Hekalu Selba which was\nsprawling on the floor, beside the pilot seat. A gaping hole in the\ntough metal plating under his right arm, and a thin trickle of blood,\ntold clearly what had happened. \"They got him,\" the Earthman muttered.\n\"But why?\"\n\nJan's eyes had wandered to the narrow desk before the pilot seat. There\nwere the instruments and devices by means of which the ship was\ncontrolled, and there was the lever which had moved the ray projector in\nits mounting just beneath the nose of the craft. A calculating pad and a\nstylus were lying on the desk.\n\nSomething was written on the pad--a message. She called to Shelby, and\ntogether they read the brief, hastily scrawled note. It was in English:\n\n\"To Janice Darell and Austin Shelby, Greeting. Alkebar is breaking into\nthe ship, and Telaba is coming. You will be with him, I know. From among\nmy enemies I have chosen my friends. A man must have friends, and\ntraitors do not serve. Forgive me for stealing your glory, Mr. Shelby. I\nshall be grateful. _Sidi Yadi_, Hekalu Selba, Akar.\"\n\nShelby looked at Jan and then at Telaba who was standing close beside\nthem. \"So that's it,\" he said slowly. \"Nobody is totally bad.\"\n\n\"Not even Hekki,\" Jan put in. A hint of a wistful smile flickered about\nher lips. \"I guess it's the end now,\" she went on. \"A glorious\nadventure. Back to Earth!\" Her voice had taken on a dreamy exultant\nquality.\n\n\"The end, Jan?\" Austin asked. \"Haven't you forgotten something?\"\n\nShe looked puzzled, and then she laughed a brief gay little laugh which\nmade roguish dimples twinkle in her cheeks. Even her fantastic attire\ncould not hide her beauty. \"You ridiculous old dumb-bell! Of course it\nisn't the end--just the beginning--with you!\"\n\nIt was a considerable time before Shelby was able to repair the _Selba_\nsufficiently so that she could get underway for Mars but the task was\nfinished at last. Escorted by the rebel chief's fierce hordesmen, they\nset out for the Red Planet.\n\nSomehow, snatches of the ancient Bedouin song tinkled in Shelby's mind.\nHe had read old books. \"Across the desert I come to thee, On a stallion\nshod with fire....\"\n\nThat did not quite fit the situation, for Jan was with him. But his\nsteed, the _Selba_, was truly shod with fire. The rocket nozzles--and\ndamaged though she was, she behaved like a thoroughbred. And out there\nin the void beside the ship--what were those shapes?--bizarre,\nimpossible, yet real--real.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\nIn docks scattered over Earth and Mars, battleships of space and their\ncrews wait expectantly for an alarm that may never come. Telescopes comb\nthe sky. Out there the Star People, new arrivals in the solar system,\nare shifting, moving about restlessly. But the planets feel secure.\nTheir fleets could cope with the Space Men, were they a hundred times\nmore numerous. And once in a while, on the desolate Sahara, or Mohave or\nTaraal, shadows come, settling down like flecks of darkness from the\nmidnight heaven. They are Telaba's and Ankova's people. For a while--a\nday perhaps--they stay, bartering their exotic treasures for human\nwares. Then silently, mysteriously, they are gone, into the night....\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Revolt of the Star Men, by Raymond Gallun\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE REVOLT OF THE STAR MEN ***\n\n***** This file should be named 41027.txt or 41027.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/4/1/0/2/41027/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
