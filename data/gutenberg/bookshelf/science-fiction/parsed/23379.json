WILEY\n\nby\n\nGREYE LA SPINA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration: _Old Mr. Wiley and the dog came over every night ... but\nwere they real?_]\n\n\n\"He just lies here tossing and moaning until he's so weak that he sinks\ninto a kind of coma,\" said the boy's father huskily. \"There doesn't seem\nanything particular the matter with him now but weakness. Only,\" he\nchoked, \"that he doesn't care much about getting well.\"\n\nMiss Beaver kept her eyes on that thin little body outlined by the fine\nlinen sheet. She caught her breath and bit her lower lip to check its\ntrembling. So pitiful, that small scion of a long line of highly placed\naristocratic and wealthy forebears, that her cool, capable hand went out\ninvoluntarily to soothe the fevered childish brow. She wanted suddenly\nto gather the little body into her warm arms, against her kind breast.\nHer emotion, she realized, was far from professional; Frank Wiley IV had\nsomehow laid a finger on her heartstrings.\n\n\"If you can rouse him from this lethargy and help him find some interest\nin living,\" Frank Wiley III said thickly, \"you won't find me\nunappreciative, Miss Beaver.\"\n\nThe nurse contemplated that small, apathetic patient in silence. Doctor\nParris had warned her that unless the boy's interest could somehow be\nstimulated, the little fellow would die from sheer lack of incentive to\nlive. Her emotion moistened her eyes and constricted her throat muscles.\nShe had to clear her throat before she could speak.\n\n\"I can only promise to do my very best for this dear little boy,\" she\nsaid hurriedly. \"No human being can do more than his best.\"\n\n\"Doctor Parris tells me you have been uniformly successful with the\ncases he's put you on. I hope,\" the young father entreated, \"that you'll\nfollow your usual precedent.\"\n\n\"The doctor is too kind,\" murmured Miss Beaver with slightly lifted\nbrows. \"I fear he gives me more credit than I deserve.\"\n\n\"There I hope you're wrong. He calls you an intuitive psychic. It is\nupon your intuitions that I'm banking now. My affection hampers me from\nfathoming Frank's inner-most thoughts. If I were really _sure_ what he\nneeded most, I'd get it for him if it were a spotted giraffe,\" declared\nhis father passionately. \"But I'm unable to go deeply enough into his\nreal thoughts.\"\n\n\"If his own father cannot think of something he would care for enough to\nmake him want to live, how can an outsider find out what he might be\nwanting?\" argued the nurse, a touch of resentment in her voice. \"Would\nnot his own mother know what would make him want to take hold on life?\"\n\nThere was an awkward pause.\n\n\"His mother,\" began Frank Wiley III and was interrupted by a light tap\non the door panel, at which he went silent, turning away as if relieved\nto escape any explanation.\n\nThe door swung open, permitting the entrance of a young and very pretty\nwoman, one who knew exactly what a charming picture she made in jade\nnegligee over peach pajamas. About her exceedingly well-shaped head\nash-blonde hair lay in close artificial waves. She was such a\ndistinctively blonde type that Miss Beaver could not control her\nslightly startled downward glance at the dark child tossing on the bed.\nHer upward look of bewilderment was met by Frank Wiley's faint smile.\n\n\"He takes after the founder of our family,\" said he in a low, almost\nconfidential voice. \"His great-grandfather was said to have had Indian\nblood in his veins, as well as a touch of old Spain. The boy doesn't\nlook like his mother or me. He's a real throw-back.\"\n\nThe pretty woman had come across the room, pettishly lifting her silk\nclad shoulders. Through the straps of embroidered sandals red-tipped\ntoes wriggled. At the tumbled bed and its small restless occupant she\nthrew what appeared to Miss Beaver a distasteful glance, ignoring the\nnurse entirely although she had not met her previously and must have\nknown that the strange young woman was the new night nurse.\n\n\"Do come to bed, Frank,\" she urged crossly, placing a proprietary hand\non her husband's coat sleeve. \"It won't do you any good to moon around\nin here and it might disturb Francis.\"\n\nMiss Beaver stood by her patient's bed, her clear gray eyes full upon\nyoung Mrs. Wiley. The nurse experienced a kind of disgust, together with\none of those uncomfortable intuitions upon the reliability of which\nDoctor Parris was always depending. She knew, all at once, that Mrs.\nWiley was that strange type of modern woman which makes a cult of\npersonal beauty, taking wifehood lightly and submitting to maternity as\ninfrequently as possible.\n\n\"I suppose you're right, Florry,\" the father conceded, with a last\nsolicitous look at the exhausted child. \"Miss Beaver...?\"\n\nThe nurse nodded, her lips a tight red line.\n\n\"It would be better for the patient if the room were quiet and\ndarkened,\" she said with decision.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen the door had closed behind the pair, Miss Beaver busied herself\nmaking the child more comfortable for the night. She smoothed out the\ncool linen sheets, drawing them taut under the wasted little body. She\nbathed the hot face with water and alcohol. To all her ministrations the\nchild submitted in a kind of lethargy, speaking no word, making no sign\nthat he had noticed a different attendant. When she had quite finished,\nhe breathed a long sigh of relaxation; his quivering, weak little body\nwent suddenly limp, and Miss Beaver had a good scare as she bent over\nhim, trying to bring back that weary and reluctant spirit to its\nexhausted mortal domicile.\n\nIt was by then nearly half past seven. The child lay supine;\nheavy-lidded eyes half opened upon this tormentress who had somehow\nsucceeded in calling him back into the dimly lighted room from the\nshadows of Lethe's alluring banks. Miss Beaver, kneeling beside young\nFrank's bed, talked tenderly to him in a soft monotone. She made all\nmanner of gratuitous promises, if only Frank would try like a good boy\nto get well. She told him firmly that he could, if he wanted to. She\nmade her suggestions with gently persuasive voice, coloring all she said\nwith the warmth of a heart peculiarly open to the unknown needs of the\nlistless child. To those unknown needs she opened wide her spirit,\ncrying within for enlightenment and help.\n\nWhile she was thus occupied, she became aware of that sensation of being\nwatched that is so startling when one considers oneself alone. Without\nrising, she turned her face quickly from the pillow of young Frank and\nlooked across the bed. A member of the household about whom Doctor\nParris had neglected to tell her was standing there, one finger on his\nlips which, though firm, wore a reassuring smile that immediately\nconveyed his warm friendliness. He was a well preserved elderly\ngentleman of aristocratic mien, clad in a bright blue garment of odd\ncut, his neck wound about with spotlessly white linen in lieu of a\nstarched collar. His high nose, raised cheek-bones, flashing black eyes\nand olive skin contrasted in lively fashion with a heavy mane of white\nhair. His eyes as well as his lips conveyed a kindliness which Miss\nBeaver's answering smile reciprocated.\n\nTapping his lips again with admonitory forefinger, the old gentleman now\nproduced, with a broad smile, something from beneath his right arm.\nLeaning down, he set this carefully beside the listless child. As he put\nit down, it gave a whining little cry.\n\nYoung Frank's eyes widened incredulously. Miss Beaver kept him under\nintent regard as he turned his dark head on the pillow to see what it\nwas that was sitting on the bed.\n\n\"Oh!\" he cried in a kind of rapture and put one thin white hand outside\nthe covers to touch the small creature that now stood wagging a brief\ntail in friendly fashion. \"Is it mine?\"\n\nThe child looked up at the old gentleman who once more, with serious\nmien and a significant movement of his head toward the door, gestured\nfor silence. The boy's eyes blinked once or twice; then with a weak but\necstatic smile he laid a pale hand upon the furry coat of the little dog\nthat began to bounce about, licking the hand that caressed it.\n\nMiss Beaver told herself that the old gentleman had found a way to lay\nhold on young Frank's reluctant spirit. She watched color creep into the\nboy's face as he cuddled the little dog blissfully, and she drew a deep\nbreath of heart-felt relief when the heavy eyelids drooped and the boy\nslipped off into a natural sleep, nothing like the heavy coma from which\nshe had struggled so hard to bring him back earlier that night.\n\nShe looked up thankfully to meet the understanding gaze of the old\ngentleman who with that gesture of admonishment bent over and picked up\nthe dog, tucked it under his blue-sleeved arm and went across the room\nto the door. He did not speak but Miss Beaver received the vivid\nimpression that his visit would be repeated the following night; it was\nas if her sensitive intuitions could receive and register a wordless\nmessage from that other sympathetic soul.\n\nThe following morning found the lad refreshed and improved. His first\nwaking thought was for the dog and in reply to his cautiously whispered\ninquiry Miss Beaver whispered back that his grandfather (the strong\nfamily resemblance made her sure it had been the boy's wise grandfather\nwho had found a means of rousing the child from an all-but-fatal\nlethargy) had taken it with him but would bring it again that night.\nMiss Beaver wondered at herself for promising this but felt somehow sure\nthat old Mr. Wiley would bring the pup without fail. She believed that\nshe had read indomitable determination in those piercing black eyes; she\nknew inwardly that he would not rest until he had found that thing which\nwould give young Frank renewed interest in living.\n\nAlthough the child appeared, if anything, a trifle less apathetic the\nfollowing day and Miss Beaver felt that each succeeding visit of old Mr.\nWiley with the fox-terrier would give the lad another push toward\nconvalescence, yet the nurse did not feel inclined to mention openly\nthat secret visit in the dead of night. The old gentleman's finger\ntapping his gravely smiling lips was one thing that restrained her; the\nother was the irritation betrayed, ingenuously enough, by the boy's\nmother during her early morning visit to the sickroom.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nYoung Mrs. Wiley looked especially pretty in a pleated jade sports\nskirt, a white pullover sweater, a jade beret on her fair hair. Under\none arm she carried a small white Pomeranian about whose neck flared a\nmatching wide jade satin bow.\n\n\"Well, how is Francis this morning?\" she inquired briskly with the\ndetermined manner of one dutifully performing an unpleasant task. \"He\nlooks better, doesn't he?\"\n\nMiss Beaver, to whom this inquiry was addressed, nodded shortly.\n\nThe boy did not look at his pretty young mother after his first\nindifferent glance as she entered the room. He lay in silence with\nclosed eyes and compressed lips, a most unchildlike expression on his\nthin boyish face.\n\n\"Look, Francis! See how sweet Kiki looks with this big green bow!\"\n\nMrs. Wiley dropped the Pomeranian on the bed. The dog snarled and\nsnapped viciously. Frank thrust out one hand and gave the animal a\npettish push. Bestowing a hard, cold glare on her son, Mrs. Wiley\nsnatched up the growling dog in high indignation.\n\n\"There! I ask you, nurse, if that child isn't just unnatural. I thought\nboys liked dogs. Francis is queer. I believe he actually hates Kiki.\"\nShe lifted the dog against her face, permitting it to loll its pink\ntongue against her carefully rouged cheek. \"Pwecious ... Was it muvver's\nown pwecious ikkle Kiki? Francis,\" she addressed her son sharply,\n\"you'll have to get over your nasty ugliness to poor little Kiki. It's a\nshame, the way you hate dogs!\"\n\n\"But I don't hate dogs!\" cried the boy vehemently, his voice breaking\nwith indignant resentment. \"It's just Kiki. I'd love to have a little\ndog of my very own, Mother. If you'd only let me have a little dog of my\nvery own!\" The faint voice died away in a sick wail. The boy's eyelids\nclosed tightly against gushing tears.\n\nMrs. Wiley gave a short exclamation of impatience.\n\n\"Francis has the idea that a dirty mongrel would be nicer than a\nbeautiful pedigreed dog like Kiki,\" she cried disgustedly.\n\n\"But why not try letting him have a dog of his own?\" asked Miss Beaver\nill-advisedly, her interest getting the better of her. \"Perhaps it would\ngive him interest enough ...\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" snapped Mrs. Wiley sharply. \"I won't have street mutts\nwandering around the house to irritate poor little Kiki. Nasty smelly\ncommon mongrels with fleas. Indeed not. I'm surprised at you, nurse, for\nmaking the suggestion.\"\n\nWith that, young Mrs. Wiley removed her vivid presence from the room,\nleaving Miss Beaver shrugging her shoulders and raising her eyebrows.\nAnd the little boy crying softly, the sheet pulled over his dark head.\n\n\"What's all this, Frankie?\" asked the father's voice.\n\n\"_She_ won't let me have a dog of my own,\" sobbed the boy, coming out\nfrom under the concealing sheet, lips a-quiver, eyes humid.\n\nMiss Beaver's lips compressed. He called his mother \"She\" as if she were\nan outsider....\n\nFrank Wiley III stood for a moment looking at his son, then let himself\ngently down on the edge of the bed, laying one big palm on the little\nchap's hot forehead. He did not speak, just sat and stroked the fevered\nbrow with tenderness. On his face a dark look brooded. His eyes were\nabsent, unhappy.\n\n\"Daddy, why couldn't I have just a _little_ puppy of my own?\"\n\nThe father replied with obvious effort.\n\n\"You know, Frankie, we have one small dog already,\" said he with forced\nlightness.\n\n\"Oh! Kiki!\"\n\n\"Couldn't you manage to make friends with Kiki?\"\n\n\"_She_ doesn't really want Kiki to like me, Daddy.\" (Wise beyond his\nyears, marvelled Miss Beaver.) \"Kiki doesn't really like little boys.\"\n\n\"Oh, my God, Frankie, don't go to crying again! Don't you see that Daddy\ncan't quarrel with Mother over a dog? Try to get well, old man, and\nwe'll see then what we can do. How about a pony, son?\"\n\nThe little boy disappeared under the sheet, refusing to reply. Miss\nBeaver could not bear his convulsive, hardly-controlled sobs, and turned\nan accusing face upon Frank Wiley III.\n\n\"Is it possible,\" she asked icily, \"that Frank's mother would actually\nrefuse him so small a thing as a puppy, if it meant the merest chance of\nhis getting better?\"\n\nThe face turned to hers was gloomy, the voice impatient.\n\n\"Oh, good God! Was ever a man in such a damnable situation? My dear Miss\nBeaver, ask the doctor to tell you how much influence I have in this\nhousehold, before you blame me for not taking a firm stand with a woman\nas nervous and temperamental as Mrs. Wiley. I'd give my life willingly\nto bring my boy back to health but unhappily I'm not like the founders\nof our family. Some day I'll show you our family album. You'll find it\neasy to trace the strong resemblance Frankie has to his forebears. Its\nthe damnably high spirit he gets from them that is so stubbornly killing\nhim now.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe rose, wheeled about and went to the door. Paused. Still with that\nbrooding dark look on his face he turned to her again.\n\n\"If my death would make it any easier for Frank, I wouldn't hesitate a\nmoment. I'm a failure. It wouldn't matter. But I feel that by living and\nwatching over him I'm standing between my boy's development as an\nindividual, and the subtlest, softest peril that could possibly threaten\nhim. I would rather he died, if he cannot bring about what he wills for\nhis own development. As for me, I ... I am a dead man walking futilely\namong the living.\"\n\nWith that, he swung out of the room.\n\nMiss Beaver knelt by the boy's bed, murmuring persuasively to him as she\nstrove to make him check his hysterical sobs.\n\n\"Frankie, you really must stop crying. You're too big a chap to cry and\nit only makes you worse. If you're a good boy to-day and eat your food,\nI'll let your grandfather bring the little dog tonight,\" she promised\nrashly.\n\nThe sheet turned down and Frank's reddened face peered at her\nplaintively.\n\n\"That was my _great_-grandfather,\" he assured her gravely.\n\n\"Well, great or great-great, it's all the same,\" she conceded\ngood-humoredly.\n\n\"Do you really think he'll bring Spot tonight?\"\n\n\"Of course he will. But you must eat your meals, take a long nap, and\nstop crying.\"\n\n\"Oh, I promise!\" the boy cried eagerly.\n\nThe day, Miss Beaver was told later, was uneventful. She had remained\nwith the day nurse until Doctor Parris had made his visit. The doctor\nhad been much pleased to find his small patient in good spirits and\ncongratulated himself upon having put Miss Beaver on the case.\n\n\"If our young friend continues to improve like this, Miss Beaver,\" he\njoked, \"we'll have him playing football within a month.\" He lowered his\nvoice for her ear only. \"Has anything particular come under your notice\nthat might account for this agreeable change?\"\n\nMiss Beaver's forehead wrinkled slightly. She regarded the doctor from\nnarrowed, thoughtful eyes.\n\n\"Tell me, Doctor Parris, if it isn't asking too much, why Mr. Wiley is a\nMan-Afraid-of-his-Wife?\"\n\nThe doctor could not repress an involuntary chuckle.\n\n\"Come now, nurse, don't you think you're asking rather a good deal?\"\n\n\"No, I don't,\" retorted Miss Beaver shortly. \"Nor do you think so,\neither. What I'm trying to get at is, why Mr. Wiley lets Mrs. Wiley\nprevent him from giving Frank a puppy that he wants?\"\n\nThe doctor regarded her thoughtfully.\n\n\"So it's a pup the boy wants. Ha, hum!\" he uttered.\n\n\"I'm asking you,\" she repeated impatiently.\n\n\"Oh! Eh! Well! Mrs. Wiley, you have undoubtedly discerned, is one of\nthose self-centered egotists who simply cannot permit people to live any\nway but her way. She won't have another dog in the house because it\nmight interfere with the comfort of that silly damn--excuse me--Pom of\nhers. If Frank were a bit older and could feign a penchant for the Pom\nand his mother got the idea that the animal's affection might be\nalienated from her, she would at once get the child another dog, just to\nkeep him away from Kiki.\"\n\n\"All of which sounds subtle but isn't very helpful,\" decided Miss Beaver\nwith unflattering directness. \"I've told Mr. Wiley that I thought a dog\nmight interest his son and Mr. Wiley replies that his wife won't let him\nget one. There is something more behind this and it's obvious you don't\nwant to tell me.\"\n\n\"Oh, hang it, nurse! You always manage to get your own way with me,\ndon't you? I'll probably have to marry you one of these days, so I can\nkeep the upper hand,\" he grinned. \"Well, then, Wiley is a weak sister\nand oughtn't to be. He's completely under his chorus-girl wife's thumb.\nHe lost a good bit in Wall Street and what's left is in her name, so\nhe's got to watch his step until he's recouped his losses.\n\n\"If he were like his father or his grandfather ... but he isn't,\"\nsnapped the doctor vexedly. \"Now, this boy here, he's a throw-back,\nyoung Frank is. He's the spittin' image of the founder of the family and\nI'm willing to wager he's got the grit and determination that once\nendowed old Frank Wiley I.\"\n\n\"I've observed,\" murmured Miss Beaver, \"that you and his father call the\nboy Frank, while his mother refers to him as Francis.\"\n\n\"That's her hifalutin way of putting on the dog, nurse,\" Doctor Parris\ngrinned wickedly. \"His name on the birth certificate is Frank but she'd\nmake a girlish Francis of him if she had her own way. For some reason\nshe isn't getting it. Her husband sticks to the old family name of Frank\nand the boy won't answer to Francis.\n\n\"She has a healthy respect for the first old Frank Wiley. If you were to\nsee the family album, nurse, you'd be quick to catch the look in the old\nboy's eyes. Nobody ever put anything over on that lad, believe me.\"\n\n\"I've no doubt of that,\" thought Miss Beaver to herself, the indomitable\ncountenance of her midnight visitor clear before her mind's eye. It was\nastonishing, that strong family resemblance. Aloud she snapped: \"Family\nalbum, indeed! What I'm after is to get permission for this child to\nhave a pet. I'm positive it would make all the difference in the world\nto him.\"\n\n\"You won't get permission, nurse. Mrs. Frank won't have any other pets\naround to bother precious Kiki,\" he said grimly.\n\n\"Not if it's a matter of life or death?\" she persisted.\n\n\"She would laugh at your putting it just that way,\" growled the doctor,\nan absent expression stealing over his kindly face.\n\n\"Well, we'll see what we'll see,\" observed Miss Beaver cryptically, her\nmouth an ominous tight red line.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe doctor suddenly spoke close to her ear, an odd note in his voice.\n\"I'm going to prescribe something very unusual, nurse. Tomorrow night a\ncovered basket will be delivered here for you. Take it into the boy's\nroom and open it if he wakens during the night. Understand?\"\n\n\"I can't say I do, Dr. Parris.\"\n\n\"You will,\" he promised. \"I'll take that basket and its contents when I\ncome around for my morning call. Unless,\" he told her grimly, \"I can see\nmy way to make the prescription stick.\"\n\nIt was with the utmost anxiety that Miss Beaver awaited the coming that\nnight of old Mr. Wiley. The day nurse had told her that Frank had eaten\na good lunch and what for him was a hearty supper. He had agreed to\nsleep if he were awakened the moment Spot arrived, and Miss Beaver had\naccepted his whispered offer. To her relief, he fell asleep immediately,\nnatural color on his thin cheeks.\n\nMr. Wiley's light tap came on the door panel. She met his grave smile\nwith a soft exclamation of welcome. The small dog was tucked under one\narm and he paused to warn her with that admonitory touch of one finger\nto his lips that the secret of his visits must be preserved. She nodded\ncomprehension, leaned over the sleeping boy and whispered softly in his\near.\n\nHe stirred, opened drowsy eyes. Then he pulled himself up on his pillow,\nreaching thin hands out to the spotted dog which nipped playfully at\nhim.\n\n\"Isn't he wonderful? When may I have him all the time?\"\n\n\"When you're well and don't need a night nurse,\" promised Miss Beaver\nrashly and was rewarded by a broad smile from the courtly old gentleman\nwho tipped back his white-maned head and laughed silently but\nwhole-heartedly.\n\n\"I'll get well at once, nurse. Don't you think I might be well enough\ntomorrow? Or the day after? Not,\" he added politely, making Miss\nBeaver's heart ache with his childish apology, \"not that I want you to\nleave, you know.\"\n\n\"That will be for the doctor to decide, Frank. But the more you eat and\nsleep and grow happy in your heart, the faster you'll get well,\" advised\nMiss Beaver earnestly.\n\nFor a long happy hour young Frank fraternized with the fox-terrier while\nthe old gentleman sat silently observing him, a grimly humorous smile\nhovering about his firm lips. Then the boy's eyes began to cloud\nsleepily and much to Miss Beaver's surprise and pleasure Frank\nrelinquished his canine playmate and fell asleep, a blissful smile\ncurving his childish mouth as he breathed with soft regularity.\n\nThen old Mr. Wiley picked up the puppy, tucked it under one blue-clad\narm and again admonishing Miss Beaver with a finger athwart his lips,\ntiptoed from the room, closing the door behind very gently.\n\nThe nurse thought with a sigh of relief that the old gentleman had\nlooked both pleased and gratified. She herself could hardly wait for\nmorning, and for the day to pass, and was both pleased and encouraged\nherself when she went on duty the next night. Frank had asked to sit up\nfor supper and when Miss Beaver entered the room he manfully refused the\nday nurse's assistance back to bed. The day nurse's up-lifted brows\nbetrayed her astonishment at the sudden turn for the better the young\npatient had taken.\n\n\"I'm almost well,\" piped up Frank Wiley IV, the moment the door closed\nbehind the day nurse. \"Tomorrow, the doctor says, I can sit out in the\ngarden in the sun. Couldn't I have Spot then?\"\n\n\"You just leave that to me,\" said Miss Beaver determinedly. \"I may have\nmuch to say about your keeping Spot, Frank.\"\n\nIn her heart she was in reality panic-stricken for she knew that pretty\nMrs. Wiley would indifferently laugh off the idea that ownership of a\ndog could mean returned health to her little son. Upon Frank Wiley III\nMiss Beaver felt no reliance could be placed; he was an uxorious\nweakling. Her unfounded hope rested on old Mr. Wiley alone; old Mr.\nWiley whose firm mouth and implacable dark eyes made her feel that he,\nand he alone, held the key to the situation. That he had realized young\nFrank's need and had filled it, albeit in secret, gave her to believe\nthat he would also furnish such good reason for yielding to young\nFrank's boyish yearning as would make Mrs. Frank retire in disorder from\nany contest of clashing wills.\n\nBut when the old gentleman stepped into the room that night he did not\ncarry the little dog under his arm; what he had was something bulkier.\nHe stopped beside the basket which had been sent to Miss Beaver and\nwhich she had not yet opened. He leaned down and released the lid. A\nlittle fox-terrier jumped out and stood, one small paw upheld, its head\ncocked to one side.\n\nMiss Beaver drew in a quick gasping breath of admiring amazement at what\nshe realized was the doctor's unusual prescription. If only old Mr.\nWiley would stand by, to uphold it, she felt that the boy would recover.\nShe drew his attention with a gesture.\n\n\"See how nicely our patient's coming along, Mr. Wiley,\" she whispered.\n\"Oh, please, won't you make them let him keep the little dog Doctor\nParris sent him? You can. I know you can.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOld Mr. Wiley leaned over the bed, apparently taking pleased note of the\nfaint color on the boy's cheeks. He smiled with obvious satisfaction. He\nlifted his head, met Miss Beaver's pleading eyes, and nodded\nemphatically. Then he slackened his hold on whatever he had tucked under\none arm and deposited it at the foot of the bed, meeting Miss Beaver's\nquestioning eyes with a significant narrowing of his own. She looked at\nthe thing, then up at him, puzzled. What he had brought in was one of\nthose huge, plush-covered atrocities with tall ivory letters on the\nfront that proclaimed it to be a Family Album. She surmised that this\nmust be the album which the doctor had said she should look over to note\nhow closely the small boy in the bed resembled his ancestors.\n\nWith a light gesture old Mr. Wiley relegated the album to the\nbackground, his glance seeking the fox-terrier that still hesitated in\nthe middle of the room. Miss Beaver understood. She gently wakened the\nsmall patient, who sat up rubbing sleepy eyes expectantly. The dog,\nsensing a play-mate, bounded upon the bed and began lapping at Frank's\neager fingers with small whimperings.\n\n\"He loves me. Don't you, Spot? Look, nurse. He has black spots over his\neyes, bigger than I remembered them. And he seems littler tonight,\ndoesn't he? But he knows me. Gee, I wish I could keep him all the time.\"\n\nOld Mr. Wiley sat silently in a comfortable chair at the shadowy back of\nthe room as he had done on his previous visits but his severe old\nfeatures softened as he watched the happy child and the antics of the\nlittle dog. When at last Frank's eyes grew humid and heavy with sleep,\nand he began to slip down on his pillow, he clung to his canine\nplaymate, refusing to relinquish the puppy which had cuddled cosily\nagainst him.\n\nOld Mr. Wiley's heavy brows lifted into a straight line over his high\nnose. A grimly ironical smile drew up the corners of his mouth. He made\na gesture of resignation. His humorously twinkling eyes met the\nconsternation in Miss Beaver's but he appeared pleased and unmoved at\nthe prospect of the dog's remaining with the boy. He rose from his\ncomfortable chair, drew a deep breath, again touched the admonitory\nfinger to his lips and withdrew, still smiling. The door closed quietly\nbehind his stately blue-clad figure.\n\nMiss Beaver told herself agitatedly that he had no business to throw the\nonus of the whole situation onto her shoulders; but even while she\nresented this high-handed behavior she was inwardly aware with one of\nher strong intuitions that old Mr. Wiley knew indubitably what he was\nabout, and that at the psychological moment he would justify her in\npermitting the dog to remain with young Frank.\n\nShe was in no hurry the following morning to turn over her patient to\nthe day nurse and lingered on in the hope that Doctor Parris would\nappear early enough to get the dog away, as he had half hinted. That he\nwould do his best to make the prescription stick she saw immediately\nafter he took a single look at young Frank who sat up nimbly, his color\nnormal for the first time in weeks. The suppressed excitement in the\natmosphere Doctor Parris could hardly be expected to understand until\nthe boy drew back the covers to show the inquisitive black nose and\nbeady eyes hidden beneath.\n\n\"Gee, Doctor Parris, isn't he just the cutest dog you ever saw?\"\nchuckled young Frank. \"Oh, gosh, here _she_ comes!\"\n\nThe cover was whipped over the dog, whose whimpers subsided with\nuncommonly good sense. Perhaps young Mrs. Wiley might not have felt the\npuppy's presence but Kiki's sharp nose was not so easily put upon. Kiki,\nwith a shrill bark, scrambled from her arms and leaped upon the bed\nwhere he began scratching furiously at the cover which Frank was holding\ndesperately but vainly against this unexpected onslaught.\n\n\"What on earth ...\" began his mother, her eyes going from Kiki to Miss\nBeaver's harried expression. \"Oh! A nasty little dog right in Francis's\nbed! Francis, push it out! It's probably full of fleas. How did that\nnasty little mongrel get in here?\"\n\n\"This pup isn't a mongrel, Mrs. Wiley,\" snapped the doctor. \"Anyone can\nsee with half an eye it's a pedigreed animal.\"\n\nShe disregarded him. \"Frank! Come here! Nurse, you should have known\nbetter than to allow that horrid little mutt....\"\n\nFrank Wiley III almost ran into the room, obviously distressed over\nsomething quite different from his wife's trouble.\n\n\"Somebody has meddled with one of our family portraits,\" he cried with\nobvious agitation. \"It's been damaged....\"\n\n\"Oh, bother the family portraits!\" shrilled his wife, highly\nexasperated. \"Look at the nasty common dog this nurse has let Francis\nhave right in his bed! I never heard of such nerve! Call Mason! Have him\nput this dog out immediately!\"\n\n\"I'll take the dog, if it's to be put out,\" growled Doctor Parris. \"I\nknow a good dog when I see one,\" he muttered resentfully.\n\n\"Let _me_ see that dog!\" exclaimed Frank Wiley III in a strangely grave\nvoice. He pushed the frantically excited Kiki from the bed to the floor.\nHe drew back the cover from the little dog huddled apprehensively\nagainst young Frank's thin body. \"Oh, good Lord! It's incredible! It\njust isn't possible!\"\n\n\"Isn't it?\" snapped his wife, looking with distastefully wrinkled nose\nat her husband's chalky face, wide staring eyes. \"Well, here it is and\nout it goes. Ring for Mason, Frank, at once. I want this dirty little\nmongrel out!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWithout paying the slightest attention, her husband turned to Miss\nBeaver. As he did so, his staring eyes fell upon the ornate plush album\non the foot of the bed.\n\n\"How did that get here?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Old Mr. Wiley brought it last night,\" admitted Miss Beaver, who was\nfeeling a trifle indignant at the old gentleman's defection.\n\n\"Old Mr. Wiley?\" echoed Doctor Parris; stupidly, for him, Miss Beaver\nthought. \"_Old Mr. Wiley?_\"\n\nFrank Wiley III, his voice shaky, almost shouted at her.\n\n\"Do you mean to stand there and tell me that old Mr. Wiley was here and\nbrought that album?\"\n\n\"I may as well tell you now as ever,\" snapped Miss Beaver and\ndeliberately turned her back upon Mrs. Frank, addressing herself\npointedly to Doctor Parris and the boy's father. \"The old gentleman has\nbeen in here every night to see Frank since I've been on duty and he\nbrought his little dog, and in my opinion his little dog should get the\ncredit of any improvement in the patient's condition.\"\n\nFrank Wiley III picked up the bulky volume and began turning the thick\ncardboard pages. His hands trembled; his face was queerly pasty.\n\n\"Turn the pages yourself, nurse, will you? See if you can find old Mr.\nWiley's picture.\"\n\nMiss Beaver flipped the cardboard pages one after another until a\nfamiliar face looked quizzically at her from a faded old daguerrotype.\nShe put on finger triumphantly on it.\n\n\"Here he is. This is old Mr. Wiley.\"\n\nMrs. Frank tiptoed nearer, took a single look, then with a shrill scream\nfainted into Doctor Parris's convenient arms.\n\nHe muttered under his breath: \"Superstitious damsel, this.\" Of Miss\nBeaver he asked drily as he deposited his fair burden distastefully in\nthe big chair where the old gentleman had been sitting on his nightly\nvisits: \"My dear Miss Beaver, are you _very_ certain old Mr. Wiley has\nbeen dropping in of nights?\"\n\n\"Of course I am,\" declared Miss Beaver indignantly. \"Is it so\nastonishing that I recognize a face I've been seeing now for three\nconsecutive nights?\"\n\n\"This _is_ unbelievable,\" Frank Wiley III gasped.\n\nSaid the doctor gravely: \"I ask you to be so very certain, nurse,\nbecause the original of that picture has been dead for over fifteen\nyears.\"\n\nAs those astonishing words fell on Miss Beaver's ears, she turned from\nthe doctor in sheer resentment.\n\n\"I don't care for practical jokes,\" said she with dignity to the boy's\napparently stupefied father, \"and I must say I resent being made sport\nof. I tell you plainly that old Mr. Wiley, the man in this picture,\" and\nshe tapped her finger impressively on the album page, \"has spent a\ncouple of hours with Frankie and me every night since I've been on duty\nhere, and that's _that_!\"\n\n\"Then that's settled,\" exclaimed the boy's father in a loud and\ndetermined voice. \"The dog stays.\"\n\nAs if miraculously restored, Mrs. Frank sprang to her feet.\n\n\"Is that _so_? Well, my dear husband, I'm afraid you're sadly mistaken.\nThe dog goes!\" She gave her husband glare for glare, the rouge standing\nin two round spots on her white face.\n\nHis look was one of active dislike. \"We'll see about that, Florry. All\nof you, come out into the hall. I want you to see something. Then let\nanyone say Frank can't keep that dog!\"\n\nHe beckoned imperatively and they followed down the great staircase into\nthe great hall below, where he stopped under a gilt-framed oil portrait,\nlife size. His finger pointed significantly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMiss Beaver deciphered the small label at the front of the massive\nframe. The painting was a portrait of Frank Wiley I, the founder of the\nWiley family. Her eyes rose higher to really look at the picture for the\nfirst time since she had been in the house. It was the living likeness\nof old Mr. Wiley and it almost seemed to her that, as she stared, one of\nhis eyelids quivered slightly as if in recognition of her belated\nadmiration for his diplomatic procedure. Beside him on the painted table\none of his fine hands lay negligently or rather, seemed to be lying\nhigher than the table proper, resting on ... was it just bare canvas?\n\n\"Look for yourself, Florry! Where is the fox-terrier that was painted\nsitting on the table under Grandfather's hand?\"\n\nYoung Mrs. Wiley stared pallidly at the likeness of the founder of the\nWiley clan. \"White paint,\" she conjectured. Then, peering closer at the\ncanvas: \"Somebody's scraped off the paint where the dog used to be.\"\n\nStiff and grim, his own man now, her husband faced her.\n\n\"Does my boy keep that dog?\"\n\nBehind them sounded a low exclamation. At the head of the staircase\nstood young Frank, the puppy tucked securely under one arm.\n\n\"Nobody's going to take away my little dog that Great-grandfather Wiley\nbrought me,\" cried the lad stoutly, black eyes flashing, thin face\ndetermined and unyielding.\n\n\"Don't let that dog come near me!\" screamed Mrs. Frank and went into a\ngenuine attack of hysteria. \"He isn't _real_!\"\n\nDoctor Parris exchanged a look with Miss Beaver, whose face was pale but\ncontented.\n\n\"I always knew you were psychic,\" he whispered, brows drawn into a\npuzzled scowl. \"That's how the old gentleman, God rest his wilful soul,\ncould get through.\"\n\n\"I wondered that he never spoke a single word! Now that it's over, I\nthink I'm going to faint,\" decided Miss Beaver shakily.\n\n\"Nonsense,\" snapped the doctor with scant courtesy. \"But _she_ is well\nscared, thank God. I hardly think she will interfere much in future with\nyoung Frank. And by the looks of him, the boy's father has had his\nbackbone stiffened considerably.\"\n\n\"That painted dog?\" whispered Miss Beaver's tremulous lips.\n\n\"Eh? Yes. Ah, yes, the dog,\" murmured the doctor, too casually.\n\n\"You--you--dared!\" uttered Miss Beaver incoherently under her breath.\n\n\"Not altogether,\" he protested against her ear.\n\nHe pointed upward. Miss Beaver's eyes followed that gesture and met the\nadmonitory, inscrutable, but very gratified pictured eyes of old Mr.\nWiley.\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK OLD MR.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
