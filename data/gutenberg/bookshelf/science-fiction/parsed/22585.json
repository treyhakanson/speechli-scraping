The former will be meat for me. You\nwill be meat for the latter.\"\n\nRockford was smiling as he spoke; the genial, engaging smile of a fond\nold father. But the eyes, surrounded by laughter crinkles, were as\nunreadable as two disks of gray slate. They were the eyes of a poker\nplayer--or master con man.\n\n\"I don't understand, sir,\" Hunter said.\n\n\"Of course not,\" Rockford agreed. \"It's a hundred light-years back to\nEarth. Here on Vesta, to make sure there _is_ an Earth in the future,\nyou're going to do things never dreamed of by your Terran Space Patrol\ninstructors there. You'll be amazed, my boy.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nHunter said nothing but he felt a growing dislike for the condescending\nRockford. Only a few weeks ago President Diskar, himself, had said: _For\nmore than a century these truly valiant men of the Space Patrol have\nbeen our unwavering outer guard; have fought and died by legions, that\nEarth and the other worlds of the Terran Republic might remain free--_\n\n\"I suppose you know,\" Rockford said, \"that there will be no more than\nfour days in which to stop the Verdam oligarchy from achieving its\nlong-time ambition of becoming big enough to swallow the Terran\nRepublic.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Hunter answered.\n\nJardeen, Vesta's companion world, was the key. Jardeen was large and\npowerful, with a space navy unsurpassed by that of any other single\nworld. A large group of now-neutral worlds would follow Jardeen's lead\nand Jardeen's alliance with the Verdam People's Worlds would mean the\nquick end for the Terran Republic. But, if Jardeen could be persuaded to\nally with the Terran Republic, the spreading, grasping arms of the\nVerdam octopus would begin to wither away--\n\nRockford spoke again:\n\n\"Val Boran, Jardeen's Secretary of Foreign Relations, is the man who\nwill really make Jardeen's decision. I know him slightly. Since my\npublic role is that of Acting Ambassador, he agreed--reluctantly--to\ncome to Vesta so that the talks could be on a neutral world. With him\nwill be Verdam's Special Envoy Sonig; a wily little man who has been\nworking on Boran for several weeks. He seems to be succeeding quite\nwell--here's a message I received from Earth early this morning.\"\n\nRockford handed him a sheet of the green Hyperspace Communications\npaper. The message was in code, with Rockford's scribbled translation\nbeneath:\n\n_Intelligence reports Verdam forces already massed for attack in Sector\nA-13, in full expectation of Jardeen's alliance. Anti-Terran propaganda,\nstressing the New Jardeen Incident, being used in preparation for what\nwill be their claim of \"defensive action to protect innocent worlds from\nTerran aggression.\" Terran forces will be outnumbered five to one. The\nurgent necessity of immediate and conclusive counter measures by you on\nVesta is obvious._\n\nHunter handed the paper back, thinking, _It's worse than any of us\nthought_, and wondering how Supreme Command could ever have entrusted\nsuch an important task to a beer-guzzling old man from Strategic\nService--a branch so unknown that he had never even heard of it until\nhis briefing the day before he left Earth.\n\nHe saw that they had left the desert behind and were going up the long\nslope of a mountain. \"The meeting will be on this mountain?\" he asked.\n\nRockford nodded. \"The rustic Royal Retreat. Princess Lyla will be our\nhostess. Her mother and father were killed in an airplane accident a\nyear ago and she was the only child. You will also get to meet Lord Narf\nof the Sea Islands, her husband-by-proxy, who regards himself as a rare\ncombination of irresistible woman-killer and rugged man-among-men.\"\n\n\"Husband-by-proxy?\" Hunter asked.\n\n\"The king worshiped his daughter and his dying request to her was that\nshe promise to marry Lord Narf. Narf's father had been the king's\nclosest friend and the king was sure that his old friend's son would\nalways love and care for Lyla. Lyla dutifully, at once, married Narf by\nproxy, which is like a legally binding formal engagement under Vestan\nlaw. Four days from now the time limit is up and they'll be formally\nmarried. Unless she should do the unprecedented thing of renouncing the\nproxy marriage.\"\n\nRockford drained the last of the beer from the can. \"Those are the\ncharacters involved in our play. I have a plan. That's why I told Space\nPatrol to send me a brand-new second lieutenant--young, strong, fairly\nhandsome--and expendable. I hope you can be philosophical about the\nlatter.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" Hunter said, unable to keep a touch of stiffness out of his tone,\n\"it is not exactly unknown in the Space Patrol for a man to die in the\nline of duty.\"\n\n\"Ah ... yes.\" Rockford was regarding him with disturbing amusement. \"You\nare thinking, of course, of dying dramatically behind a pair of blazing\nblasters. But you will soon learn, my boy, that a soldier's duty is to\nprotect the worlds he represents by whatever actions will produce the\nbest results, no matter how unheroic those actions may be.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Attention, please.\" It was the voice of the pilot. \"We are now going to\nland.\"\n\nHunter preceded Rockford out of the helicopter and onto the green grass\nof a small valley, across which tall, red-trunked cloud trees were\nscattered. Pale gray ghost trees, with knobby, twisted limbs, grew\nthickly among the cloud trees. There was a group of rustic cabins,\nconnected by gravel paths, and a much larger building which he assumed\nwould be a meeting hall.\n\n\"Hello.\"\n\nHe turned, and looked into the brown eyes of a girl. Her green skirt and\norange blouse made a gay splash of color, her red-brown hair was\nwind-tumbled and carefree about her shoulders, in her hand was a bouquet\nof bright spring flowers.\n\nBut there was no smile of spring in the dark eyes and the snub-nosed\nlittle face was solemn and old beyond its years.\n\n\"You're Lieutenant Hunter, aren't you?\" she asked in the same low, quiet\nvoice.\n\n\"Princess Lyla!\" There seemed to be genuine delight in Rockford's\ngreeting as he hurried over. \"You're looking more like a queen every\nday!\"\n\nHer face lighted with a smile, making it suddenly young and beautiful.\n\"I'm so glad to see you again, George--\"\n\n\"Ah ... good afternoon.\"\n\nThe voice was loud, unpleasantly gravelly. They turned, and Hunter saw a\ntall, angular man of perhaps forty whose pseudogenial smile was not\ncompatible with his sour, square-jawed face and calculating little eyes.\n\nHe spoke to Rockford. \"You're Ambassador Rockford, here to represent the\nTerran Republic, I believe.\" He jerked his head toward Princess Lyla,\nwho was no longer smiling. \"My wife, Princess Lyla.\"\n\n\"Oh, she and I have been friends since she was ten, Lord Narf.\"\n\n\"And this young man\"--Narf glanced at Hunter--\"is your aide, I presume.\nLyla, did you think to send anyone after their luggage?\"\n\nA servant was already carrying their luggage--and cases of Rockford's\nbeer--out of the helicopter. Hunter followed the other toward the\ncabins. Narf, in the lead, was saying:\n\n\"... Ridiculously primitive here, now, but I'm having some decent\nfurniture and well-trained servants sent up from my Sea Island\nestates....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe cabin was large and very comfortable, as Rockford mentioned to\nPrincess Lyla.\n\n\"I'm glad you like it,\" she said. \"Val Boran and Envoy Sonig are already\nhere and we'll meet for dinner in the central hall. I thought that if we\nall got acquainted in a friendly atmosphere like that, it might help a\nlot to....\"\n\n\"That reminds me\"--Narf glanced at his watch--\"I promised this Boran he\ncould have a discussion with me--Vesta-Jardeen tariff policies. I\nsuppose he's already waiting. Come on, Lyla--it will do you no harm to\nlisten and learn a bit about interplanetary business.\"\n\nFor a long moment she looked at Narf silently, her eyes thoughtful, then\nshe said to Rockford, \"If you will excuse us, please. And be prepared\nfor Alonzo to come bounding in the minute he learns you're here.\"\n\nShe walked beside Narf to the door and out it, the top of her dark hair\ncoming just even with his shoulder.\n\n\"And that,\" Rockford said as he settled down in the largest, softest\nchair, \"was king-to-be Narf, whose business ability is such that all his\ninherited Sea Island estates are gone but the one Lyla saved for him and\nwho owes a total of ten million monetary units, to everyone from call\ngirls to yacht builders.\"\n\n\"And she is going to marry him?\" Hunter asked. \"Marry that jackass and\nlet him bankrupt her kingdom?\"\n\nRockford shrugged. \"You may have noticed that she doesn't look the least\nbit happy about it--but she is a very conscientious young lady who\nregards it as her most solemn duty to keep the promise she made to her\nfather. For her, there is no escape.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Your first duty will be to cultivate a friendship with her. I'm going\nto use her, and you, to get what I want.\"\n\n\"_Use_ us?\"\n\n\"Yes. One of the most rigid requirements of a Strategic Service man's\ncharacter is that he be completely without one.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n           *       *       *       *\n\nRockford was asleep in his chair an hour later, three empty beer cans\nbeside him. Hunter watched him, his doubt of Rockford's competence\ngrowing into a conviction. Rockford had spoken knowingly of his\nplan--and had done nothing but drink more beer. Now he was asleep while\ntime--so limited and precious--went by. He hadn't even bothered to reply\nto Hunter's suggestion that perhaps he should call on Val Boran and\ncounteract some of Envoy Sonig's anti-Terran propaganda.\n\nHunter came to a decision. If Rockford was still doing nothing when\nmorning came, he would send an urgent message to Supreme Command.\n\nHe went outside, to find a servant and learn how mail was handled.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"_Rook out!_\"\n\nGravel flew as overgrown feet tried to stop, and something like a huge\nblack dog lunged headlong around the corner and into his legs. He went\nto the ground head first over the animal, acutely aware as he went down\nof the fascinated interest on the face of a not-so-distant servant.\n\n\"I sorry, Rootenant.\"\n\nHe got up, to look down at the doglike animal. There was a concerned\nexpression in its brown eyes and an apologetic grin on its face. He\nrecognized it as one of the natives of the grim starvation world of\nAltair Four. The Altairians had emigrated to all sections of the galaxy,\nto earn a living in whatever humble capacity they could fill. Many were\nempathic.\n\n\"I run too fast to meet, Mr. Rockford, I guess. Are you hurt,\nRootenant?\"\n\nHe pulled a cloud tree needle out of his hand and looked grimly down\ninto the furry face. \"In the future, try to look where you're going.\"\n\n\"Oh, I rook, awr right. I just not see. My name is Aronzo, Rootenant,\nand I stay here awr the time and guard everything for Princess Ryra. I\nprease to meet you and I wirr run errands for you, and do things rike\nmair your retters, for candy or cookies, which I are not supposed to eat\nmuch of, but Princess Ryra say not too many wirr hurt me--\"\n\n\"Mail letters?\" Hunter's animosity vanished. \"I'm sorry I was rude,\nAlonzo--all my fault. I may write a letter to my dear old mother\ntonight, and if you would mail it for me in the morning--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRockford left ahead of Hunter and it was a minute past the appointed\ntime when Hunter reached the meeting hall. He heard Narf's loud voice\ninside:\n\n\"... Boran must have stopped to watch the sunset. Told him I wanted\neveryone here on time--\"\n\nThe low voice of Lyla said something and Narf said, \"Not necessary for\nyou to defend him, my dear. I made it plain to him.\"\n\nA new voice spoke from behind Hunter:\n\n\"It seems I have annoyed Lord Narf.\"\n\nHe was a tall, black-eyed man, with the dark, saturnine face of an\nIndian. There was a strange, indefinable air of sadness about him which\nreminded Hunter of the sombre little Princess Lyla.\n\n\"You're Val Boran, sir?\" he said. \"I'm Lieutenant Hunter--\"\n\nInside, Narf sat at the head of the table. On his left was Lyla, then\nRockford. On his right was a spidery little man of about fifty, his\nslick-back hair so tight against his skull that it gave his head the\nappearance of a weasel's. His lips were paper-thin under a long nose,\nlike those of a dry and selfish old maid, but the round little eyes\ndarting behind thick glasses were cold and shrewd and missed nothing. He\nwould be Verdam's Special Envoy Sonig. Hunter appraised him as a man\nvery dangerous in his own deceptive way.\n\nA servant showed them to their places at the table. Rockford and Val\nBoran exchanged greetings. The moment everyone was seated, Narf said,\n\"Dinner tonight will--\"\n\n\"Excuse me,\" Lyla said, \"but Mr. Sonig hasn't yet met--\"\n\n\"Oh ... the young fellow there--\" Narf gestured with his hand.\n\"Rockford's aide. Now, ring the chime, Lyla. Those forest stag steaks\nare already getting cold. I killed the beast myself, gentlemen, just\nthis morning; a long-range running shot that required a bit more than\nluck....\"\n\nThe dinner was excellent, but no one seemed to notice. Narf was absorbed\nin the story of his swift rise to eminence in the Vestan Space Guard.\nThere were humorous incidents:\n\n\"... Can't understand why, but I seem to attract women like a magnet.\nI'm strictly the masculine type of male and I approve of this but it can\nbe a blasted nuisance when you're an ensign going up fast and your\ncommander finds one of your blondes stowed away in your compartment....\"\n\nAnd there were scenes of tense drama:\n\n\"... Made a boyhood vow that I'd never settle for anything less than to\nalways be a man among men. Seem to have succeeded rather well. When I\nsaw the crew was almost to the snapping point from battle tension I knew\nthat as commander I'd have to set the example that would inspire.\"\n\nHunter recalled Rockford's words of a few hours before: \"_Narf got to be\ncommander, finally, but only because he was the son of the king's best\nfriend. His record is very mediocre._\"\n\nPrincess Lyla tried three times to start a conversation of general\ninterest and was drowned out by Narf each time. Sonig's pretense of\nbeing spellbound by Narf's stories was belied by the way his eyes kept\ndarting from Rockford to Val Boran. Val's own attention kept shifting\nfrom Narf to the silent Lyla, whose downcast eyes betrayed her\ndiscouragement. She watched Val from under her eyelashes, to look away\nwhenever their eyes met, and Hunter wondered if she was ashamed because\nNarf had given Sonig the seat of honor that should have belonged to Val.\n\nOf course, Narf's own position at the head of the table was actually\nLyla's.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"... So there's no substitute for competent, unwavering leadership,\"\nNarf was saying. \"Received a citation for that one.\"\n\nSonig nodded appreciatively. \"Your military record well illustrates the\nfact that the tensions of danger and battle can bring forth in a\ncompetent leader the highest kind of courage. But it seems to me that\nthese same circumstances, if the leader is frightened or incompetent,\ncan easily produce hysterical actions with disastrous consequences. Is\nthis true, your lordship?\"\n\nRockford was watching Sonig intently and Hunter saw that there was an\neager anticipation in Sonig's manner.\n\n\"You are quite right,\" Narf answered. \"I've always had the ability to\nremain cool in any crisis. Very important. Let a commander get rattled\nand he may give any kind of an order. Like the New Jardeen Incident.\"\n\nA frozen silence followed the last five words. Hunter thought, _So\nthat's what the little weasel was fishing for...._\n\nRockford quietly laid down his fork. Val's face turned grim. Lyla looked\nup in quick alarm and said to Narf:\n\n\"Let's not--\"\n\n\"Don't misunderstand me, gentlemen,\" Narf's loud voice went on. \"_I_\nbelieve the commander of the Terran cruiser wouldn't have ordered it to\nfire upon the Verdam cruiser over a neutral world such as New Jardeen\nif he had been his rational self. Cold-war battle nerves. So he shot\ndown the Verdam cruiser and its nuclear converters exploded when it fell\nin the center of Colony City. Force of a hydrogen bomb--forty thousand\ninnocent people gone in a microsecond. Not the commander's fault,\nreally--fault of the military system that failed to screen out its\nunstable officers.\"\n\n\"Yes, your lordship. But is it possible\"--Sonig spoke very\nthoughtfully--\"for a political power, which is of such a nature that it\nmust have a huge military force to maintain its existence, to thoroughly\nscreen all its officers? So many officers are required--Can there ever\nbe any assurance that such tragedies won't occur again and again, until\na majority of worlds combine in demanding an end to aggression and war?\"\n\nRockford spoke to the grim Val:\n\n\"I know, sir, that your sister was among the lost in Colony City. I am\nsorry. For the benefit of Mr. Sonig and Lord Narf, I would like to\nmention that the Verdam cruiser fired upon the Terran cruiser over\nneutral New Jardeen in open violation of Galactic Rule. An atmospheric\nfeedback of the Verdam cruiser's own space blasters tore out its side\nand caused it to fall. The Terran cruiser never fired.\"\n\n\"But Mr. Rockford--\" Sonig spoke very courteously. \"Isn't it true that\ncertain safety devices prevent atmospheric feedback?\"\n\n\"They do--unless accidentally or purposely disconnected.\"\n\nSonig raised his eyebrows. \"You imply a created incident, sir?\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter,\" Val Boran said. His tone was as grim as his face\nand it was obvious he did not believe Rockford's explanation. \"Colony\nCity is a field of fused glass, now, its people are gone, and no amount\nof debating can ever bring them back.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n           *       *       *       *\n\nThe dismal dinner was finally over. Rockford stopped outside the door of\ntheir cabin to fill and light his pipe.\n\n\"It was a profitable evening,\" he said to Hunter. \"I can start planning\nin detail now--after a little beer, that is.\"\n\n_He'll go to sleep after he drinks his beer_, Hunter thought, _and there\nwill never be any plan unless I--_\n\nSoft footsteps came up the path behind them. It was Princess Lyla.\n\n\"I want to apologize,\" she said, \"I just told Val ... Mr. Boran the same\nthing.\"\n\nHer face was a pale oval in the starlight, her eyes dark shadows. \"I'm\nsorry my husband mentioned the New Jardeen incident.\"\n\n\"That's all right, Lyla,\" Rockford said. \"No harm was done.\"\n\n\"He's an ex-military man, and I guess it's his nature to be more\nforthright than tactful.\"\n\n\"You certainly can't condemn him for that,\" Rockford said. \"In fact,\nhe's an extraordinary teller of entertaining stories. It was a most\nenjoyable evening.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"And, in a way, it was,\" Rockford said when she was gone and they were\nin the cabin. He was seated in the softest chair, a can of beer in his\nhand, as usual.\n\nHunter thought of the way she had looked in the starlight and said, \"Why\ndid she let that windbag sit at the head of the table and ruin the\nmeeting that she had arranged?\"\n\n\"He'll soon be her husband--I suppose she feels she should be loyal to\nhim.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"But what?\"\n\n\"Nothing. It's none of my business.\"\n\n\"Oh?\" Rockford smiled in a way Hunter did not like. \"You think so, eh?\"\n\nHunter changed the subject. \"Are you going to start talking to Boran to\nundo the damage Narf and Sonig have done?\"\n\n\"It would be a waste of time, my boy. Val Boran's mind is already made\nup.\"\n\n\"Then what are you going to do?\"\n\n\"Drink six cans of beer and go to sleep.\"\n\n\"I thought you had a plan.\"\n\n\"I have, a most excellent plan.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"You'd scream like a banshee if you knew. You'll learn--if you manage to\nlive that long.\"\n\nRockford was sound asleep an hour later, snoring gently. Hunter sat\nthinking, hearing the steady murmur of a voice coming from Val Boran's\ncabin. Sonig's voice--using every means of persuasion he could think of,\nat the moment capitalizing on the New Jardeen incident and Boran's\nwithheld grief over the sister he had lost.\n\nAnd the Terran Republic's representative was sprawled fat and mindless\nin a fog of beer fumes.\n\nHunter hesitated no longer. The fate of Earth and the Terran Republic\nhung in the balance and time was desperately limited--if there was now\nany time at all.\n\nHe took paper and pen and began the urgent message to Supreme Command,\nheaded, TOP EMERGENCY. It would be sent via Hyperspace Communications\nfrom the city and would span the hundred light-years within seconds.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was up before Rockford the next morning, and went out into the bright\nsunlight. He looked hopefully for Alonzo, not wanting to be seen mailing\nthe letter in person. Rockford, despite his drunken stupors, could be\nshrewdly observant and he might deduce the contents of the letter before\nSupreme Command ever received it.\n\nHe was some distance from the cabin when he heard the pound of padded\nfeet behind him.\n\n\"Rootenant,\" Alonzo had the grin of a genial canine idiot. \"Do you want\nme to mair your retter to your dear ore mother?\"\n\n\"Yes, I have the letter right here.\"\n\n\"O.K. I got to hurry, because the mair hericopter reaves right away. I\ncharge six fig cookies or three candy bars or--\"\n\n\"Here--take it and run--and try not to slobber all over it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey were served breakfast in the cabin. Afterward, Rockford went for a\nbrief talk with Princess Lyla. He came back and settled down in the\neasy-chair, his pipe in his hand.\n\n\"Your morning's duty won't be at all unpleasant,\" he said. \"The\nobnoxious and repulsive things will begin to happen to you later. Maybe\nthis afternoon.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"This morning you will go for a walk with Princess Lyla and discuss\nchanging the Vestan Space Guard into a force along Terran Space Patrol\nlines. Narf is still in bed, by the way.\"\n\nRockford added, \"I'll give you a bit of sage advice, for your own\ngood--try not to fall in love with her.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n           *       *       *       *\n\nHunter and Princess Lyla sat together on the high hill, their backs\nagainst the red trunk of a cloud tree. On the mountain's slope to their\nright lay the dark and junglelike Tiger Forest--he wondered if it was\ntrue that the savage tree tigers never left its borders--while the\ntoylike cabins of the camp were below them. The mountain's slope dropped\non down to the deserts, beyond which were other mountains, far away and\ntranslucent azure.\n\n\"It was George who suggested we come up here,\" she said. \"He knows I do\nthat often when the responsibilities of being queen of a world--I'm such\nan ordinary and untalented person--become too much for me. I always feel\nbetter when I sit up here and look down on the mountains and deserts.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said politely.\n\n\"A ruling princess can be so alone,\" she said. \"That's why I appreciate\nGeorge's friendship so much--it's never because of any ulterior motive\nbut because he likes me.\"\n\n_I'm going to use her, and you, to get what I want._\n\nHe looked at her, at the lines of sadness on the face that was too old\nfor its years, felt the way she was so grateful to Rockford for what was\nonly a cold-blooded pretense of friendship, and the dislike for Rockford\nincreased. He could not force himself to speak civilly of Rockford so he\nchanged the subject:\n\n\"I understand you wanted to talk to me about the Space Guard?\"\n\n\"Yes. Even a neutral world can't feel safe these days and George\nsuggested that.\"\n\n\"I'll be glad to help all I can. Of course, the change will require\ntime.\"\n\n\"I can understand that. They say you Space Patrol officers begin\ntraining at sixteen, after passing almost impossible qualification\ntests.\"\n\n\"The tests can seem extremely difficult to a farm boy from Kansas. I--\"\n\n\"Kansas?\" Her eyes lighted with interest. \"My grandmother was from\nKansas! She used to tell me about the green plains of grain in the\nspring, and how different they were from the deserts of Vesta....\"\n\nIt was almost noon when he took her hand and helped her to her feet,\nrealizing guiltily that they had talked all morning without ever getting\nback to the cold, dry facts of military efficiency.\n\n\"It was nice to talk up here this morning,\" she said. She looked down at\nthe cabins and the shadow fell again across her face. \"But nothing down\nthere has been changed by it, has it?\"\n\nHe held to her hand longer than was necessary as they went down the\nsteep part of the hill. She did not seem to mind.\n\nWhen they reached her cabin she said, \"It's still a little while until\nlunch--time enough for you to give me a rough outline of the Space Guard\nchange.\"\n\nEverything inside the cabin was feminine. None of Narf's possessions\nwere visible. There was a heavy door leading into Narf's half of the\ncabin, with a massive lock. Hunter wondered if it was left unlocked at\nnight, thought of Narf's sour face and leering little eyes, and found\nthe thought repulsive.\n\nThe answer to his conjecture came with the entrance of a servant as they\nseated themselves.\n\n\"By your leave, your highness,\" the servant said, bowing, \"I came to\nmake Lord Narf a key for that inner door.\"\n\n\"A key?\" There was alarm in her tone. \"But we're not married--not yet!\"\n\nA puzzled expression came to the man's face. \"Lord Narf told me, your\nhighness, that you had ordered the duplicate key made and given to him\nbefore evening. I found I could not do this without first borrowing your\nkey for a pattern.\"\n\nThere was a frightened look in her eyes as they went to the door and\nback to the servant. \"_No_ ... don't try to make a key!\"\n\n\"Yes, your highness.\" The servant bowed and turned away.\n\nA familiar gravelly voice spoke from behind them:\n\n\"Ah ... an unscheduled little meeting, I see!\"\n\nIt was Narf, anger on his face, already within the doorway as the\nservant went out it.\n\n\"We were going to talk about the Space Guard,\" Lyla said in an\nemotionless tone. \"Lieutenant Hunter has promised to show how Space\nPatrol methods will improve it and--\"\n\n\"By a coincidence, Sonig and I were discussing military matters only a\nfew minutes ago,\" Narf said. He looked at Hunter. \"I'm afraid that Sonig\nand I agree that the Terran Space Guard is quite out of date, now.\n_The_ fighting force of the galaxy is the Verdam's Peoples Guards.\"\n\nNarf spoke to Lyla, \"You may go ahead and talk with this lieutenant if\nyou wish to, but it's a waste of time. I'm arranging to have Sonig send\nPeoples Guards officers here to supervise the rebuilding of the Space\nGuard.\n\n\"And now\"--there was insinuation in Narf's tone as he spoke to\nHunter--\"I have to give Sonig a demonstration of my skill with weapons.\nHe insists on it--he has heard of several of my modest feats.\"\n\nNarf left the door open behind him so that by turning his head as he\nwalked, he could see the two inside.\n\n\"I suppose I might as well go,\" Hunter said.\n\nLyla did not answer. She sat motionless, staring unseeingly before her,\nand he wondered if she was thinking of how very soon Narf would be king\nand his authority as great as hers.\n\nShe did not notice when he quietly left the room.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n           *       *       *       *\n\nRockford was waiting in the cabin, still in the easy-chair.\n\n\"Well,\" Rockford said, \"what do you think of her?\"\n\nHunter tried to keep the personal dislike out of his coldly formal\nreply:\n\n\"If you refer to your suggestion that I not make love to her, sir, I can\nassure you that such a suggestion was never necessary. I happen to have\na code of ethics.\"\n\n\"I didn't say 'make love'. I said, 'fall in love'. That's quite ethical.\nDid you complete your discussion with her?\"\n\n\"Well ... no.\"\n\n\"You must do that this afternoon, then. Can't let anything as important\nas that be delayed.\"\n\nHunter stared at him, trying to find one small grain of sanity in\nRockford's actions. The Verdam empire already had Jardeen within its\ngrasp, and Vesta, and the end for Earth was inevitable. And Rockford\nslept, and drank beer, and regarded it as very important that the Vestan\nSpace Guard discussions--of a change that Narf would never permit--be\ncontinued without delay.\n\nHe walked slowly into his own room. In the nightmare situation of\nfrustration there was one single sane and stable conviction for his mind\nto cling to: Supreme Command would by now have received his message and\nshot back the reply that would relieve Rockford of his command. Perhaps\nit wasn't yet too late--\n\nThen his mind reeled as a new conviction struck it.\n\nThere was a sheet of paper on his bed--a message.\n\n_His_ message!\n\n... SITUATION EXTREMELY CRITICAL ... VAL BORAN ALREADY CONVINCED BY\nSONIG'S PROPAGANDA ... MUST REPORT ROCKFORD IS UTTERLY INCOMPETENT, HIS\nMIND AND WILL DESTROYED BY ALCOHOL ... REPEAT: ROCKFORD IS DOING\nNOTHING, HIS MIND DESTROYED BY ALCOHOL....\n\nThe words screamed up at him and he felt the sickness of one who sees\nthe last faint hope shattered and gone. All was lost, now....\n\nHe went outside, feeling a savage desire for violence rising above the\nsickness.\n\n\"Rootenant!\" Alonzo came bounding to meet him and slid to a halt with\nhis saucer feet scattering gravel and the idiotic grin on his face. \"I\nmair your retter and you owe me six fig cook--\"\n\nIt occurred to Hunter that it was not Alonzo that should be punished.\nHe, Hunter, was the one who deserved execution for ever entrusting\nanything so important as the message to an imbecilic animal.\n\nHe said with cold distinctness:\n\n\"The ... letter ... is ... inside.\"\n\n\"Oh?\" Alonzo blinked. \"I sure mair something, awr right. After Mr.\nRockford correct it.\"\n\n\"_Correct it?_\"\n\n\"Oh, sure. Mr. Rockford, he up rong before you this morning to find me\nand say you are writing a retter rast night and I must bring it by for\nhim to make awr your mistakes over again.\"\n\n_So Rockford was watching all the time, pretending to be in a drunken\nsleep...._\n\n\"Rootenant--\" Alonzo shifted his big feet impatiently. \"You stirr owe me\nsix fig--\"\n\nHunter swung around and strode away, afraid he might decide to choke the\nanimal after all. A culture of twenty worlds was the same as already\ndestroyed, and he was held in a maddening quagmire of helplessness by a\ncrafty alcoholic and a dog with the mind of a small child.\n\n\"Ah ... my boy!\" Rockford came out of the cabin, beaming as though\nnothing had ever happened. \"Look to your left, among those ghost\ntrees--Narf is demonstrating his quick-draw skill to Sonig. Narf is\nsupposed to be a very dangerous man, you know.\"\n\nHunter looked, and saw Narf whipping up the blunt, ugly spread-beam\nblaster--known to soldiers as the Coward's Special, because at short\nrange it could not miss and would always cripple and blind a man for\nlife even though it would not always kill him. Sonig was standing by,\nnodding his weasel head and smiling in open admiration.\n\n\"Of course,\" Rockford said, \"Sonig isn't mentioning the needle gun all\nVerdam envoys carry up their sleeve. He's flattering Narf's ego for a\nreason--he intends to have Vesta, as well as Jardeen, sewed up for the\nVerdam empire when he leaves here.\"\n\n\"And so far as I can see,\" Hunter said coldly, \"Sonig never is going\nto have anything vaguely resembling intelligent resistance to his\nplans.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Ah, yes ... so far as you can see,\" Rockford agreed amiably. \"But you\nobey my order to take Lyla for another walk and everything will turn out\nall right. In fact, I'll speak to her about that right now.\"\n\nHunter stared after Rockford as he walked away. There could be no\npossible shred of doubt--Rockford was insane!\n\nThe breeze shifted and the voice of Narf came:\n\n\"... Certainly no weapon for a timid man, this spread-beam blaster. Have\nto meet the enemy man-to-man at close range.\"\n\n\"In that respect, too,\" Sonig said, \"you remind me of our great General\nPaluk. His skill in hand-to-hand combat was something that--\"\n\n\"Rootenant--\"\n\nHunter quivered and steeled himself.\n\n\"Rootenant--\" Alonzo came to a flopping halt beside him. \"I terr\nPrincess Ryra and she say I are bad to be mad at you. So I not mad, even\nif you didn't give me my pay.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" Hunter said acidly. \"I was deeply disturbed by your\nresentment.\"\n\n\"Oh, I know, you don't rike me. But I think you not as mean as you act.\nBut Rord Narf--he is. I terr you, he awready mad enough to kirr you.\"\n\n\"What? Lord Narf wants to kill me?\"\n\n\"Oh, he know you hord Princess Ryra's hand awrmost awr the way down the\nhirr this morning. Mr. Sonig, he see you, and he run and terr Rord Narf\nand Mr. Boran, too.\"\n\n\"But I was only helping her down the hill.\"\n\n\"Rord Narf, he are going to say mean things about it to Princess Ryra,\ntoo. I know. He are awrways saying mean things to my Princess Ryra.\"\n\nAlonzo sighed, a sound strangely humanlike in its sadness.\n\n\"Who wirr watch over my Princess Ryra after she marry Rord Narf? He\nsaid, 'The first thing to go around here wirr be that stupid\nbrabber-mouth animar that are not worth what it costs to feed it.' I\nthink maybe he are afraid that if he ever hit my Princess Ryra, I wirr\nkirr him.\" The brown eyes looked up at Hunter, and suddenly they were\nunlike he had ever seen them; cold with deliberate decision. \"I wirr,\ntoo.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n           *       *       *       *\n\nHunter was still standing by the cabin, thinking of what Alonzo had\nsaid, when Rockford returned.\n\n\"I also stopped by to see Val Boran,\" Rockford said. \"While you're off\nwith Lyla, we'll go to the city. Lyla is giving us free access to the\nRoyal Library and the records of a neutral world carry more weight than\nanything I could say. Not that it's going to change his mind any--but\nit will give me a chance to work on him in another way.\"\n\nRockford went into the cabin as Val Boran came up the path, Princess\nLyla walking beside him. She was saying, \"... And anything we have in\nthe library is yours for the asking.\"\n\nThey were close enough for Hunter to see her expression as she looked up\nat Val and added with what seemed a touch of wistfulness, \"I'll be glad\nto go in with you and Mr. Rockford and do what I can to help if you want\nme to.\"\n\n\"Lyla\"--it was the grating voice of Narf who seemed to have the ability\nto materialize anywhere--\"I'm sure the man knows his business. Besides,\nI want to talk to you about something as soon as I have finished my\ndiscussion with Mr. Sonig.\"\n\nWith that, Narf started on toward his cabin. Sonig, close behind him,\npaused long enough to bow to Lyla and say with the meaningless smile,\n\"Good afternoon, Princess Lyla. Your husband was just demonstrating his\nmarvelous skill with weapons. I would very much dislike\"--the little\neyes darted to Hunter and back again--\"being the man who aroused his\nlordship's wrath.\"\n\nThen Sonig followed Narf, with one last flickering glance at Hunter to\nsee how the remark had fallen.\n\nRockford came out of the cabin with his brief case and said to Val, \"Are\nwe ready to go?\"\n\n\"I just told Val\"--Lyla spoke quickly--\"that I would be glad to go along\nand help any way I can.\" The words were addressed to Rockford but her\neyes were on Val, with the same wistful expression. \"Do you want me to?\"\n\nVal answered her with cool, formal courtesy: \"The librarian can find all\nthe records we will need, Princess Lyla, without our interrupting your\nschedule for the day or your discussion with your husband. Thank you\nvery much.\"\n\nFor an instant Lyla's face had the hurt expression of a child rebuffed\nwithout reason. Then she looked away and Val turned to Rockford and\nsaid, \"I'm ready when you are, sir.\"\n\nLyla watched them walk away and she was still watching when the\nhelicopter had lifted into the air and faded from sight.\n\nHunter hesitated, then spoke to her:\n\n\"I understand you want to talk more about the Space Guard, Princess\nLyla?\"\n\n\"_Princess_ Lyla!\" Her lips curled as she turned to face him and she\nseemed to spit the words at him in sudden, unexpected resentment. \"I\nlove the meaningless sound of my official figurehead title! It's so much\nbetter than being regarded as a living person with feelings that can be\nhurt!\"\n\n\"But Princ ... I mean--\" He floundered, not quite sure what had caused\nher reaction.\n\nShe made a visible effort to compose herself. \"I'm sorry,\" she said. \"I\nsuppose my ... husband ... is quite right; an immature female has no\nbusiness trying to rule a world and the sooner the marriage is\nconfirmed, the sooner a competent man can take over the job.\"\n\n\"No,\" he said. \"I think--\"\n\nHe decided that what he thought had better be left unsaid.\n\n\"I'll\"--she looked toward the cabin she shared with Narf--\"let you know\nwhen we can talk.\"\n\nShe went back toward the cabin, walking slowly. From inside Narf's half\nof it came the sound of Narf's voice as he spoke to Sonig:\n\n\"... Of course, this collection of heads is nothing compared with what I\nhave in the Sea Islands ... but some interesting stories here ... take\nthat snow fox there....\"\n\nHunter sighed, and saw that Lyla had stopped before her door, as though\ndreading to enter. Narf's voice droned on:\n\n\"... Only wounded, so I finished it with a knife. Even with its heart\nhalf cut out, it still wanted to live ... beautiful pelt ... coat for\nJanalee, the strip-tease queen ... always had a way with women--Lyla\ncould tell you that ... had my pick of hundreds but I'm letting her be\nmy choice....\"\n\nHe saw Lyla half lift her hand, as in some mute gesture of protest, then\nshe turned and walked swiftly away; up the path that led into the ghost\ntrees, and out of sight.\n\nHe waited, but she did not come back. He went into his cabin and moved\nabout restlessly, hearing again Narf's sadism-and-sex boasting and\nseeing again how she turned and almost ran from it--\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"_Rootenant!_\"\n\nAlonzo was panting, a look of frantic appeal in his eyes.\n\n\"Prease herp me ... Princess Ryra ... she wirr die!\"\n\nHe felt his heart lurch. \"She's hurt?\" he demanded, and was already on\nhis way to the door.\n\n\"She are about to cry and she are going to where the tree tigers riv.\nThey wirr kirr her--prease come with me!\"\n\nHe asked no more questions but went out the door and up the path, Alonzo\nrunning ahead of him.\n\nThe ghost trees grew thinner as they went up the mountain's slope, and\nthe blue-green fernlike trees of the tiger forest began to appear. They\ngrew thicker and thicker, until the ground was black with their shadows\nand the midday sunlight was filtered out by the foliage overhead. Alonzo\nwas trailing her, his nose to the ground, and Hunter hurried close\nbehind him, watching for the red-and-white of the clothes she was\nwearing and hoping they would not find her too late.\n\nThey were deep in the forest when they found her.\n\nShe was standing motionless in the center of a clearing, facing away\nfrom him and looking as small and alone as a lost child. She seemed to\nbe waiting....\n\nHe realized for the first time how alone she really was, with only a\ndoglike alien, Alonzo, to love her or care what might happen to her, and\nwith a future she could not bear to face. But Rockford had been wrong\nwhen he had said, _For her, there is no escape_.\n\nThere was escape for her. She had only to wait, as she was waiting now,\nand it would come in the windlike whisper of a tiger's rush through the\ngrass behind her....\n\nHe hurried to her. She turned, and he saw the stains of tears now dry on\nher face and in her eyes the darkness of utter defeat.\n\n\"I was afraid you might get hurt, Lyla--\"\n\nThen, seemingly without volition on his part, he put his arms around her\nand she was clinging to him and crying in muffled sobs and trying to say\nsomething about, \"_I didn't think anybody cared...._\"\n\nIt was some time later, when her crying was finished, that he was\nreminded of the tigers by Alonzo:\n\n\"Rootenant ... awr the time, some tigers are coming croser and croser.\nWe better get her out of here, Rootenant, before they find us.\"\n\nLyla looked down at Alonzo. \"Thank you, Alonzo, for watching over me and\n... and--\" Her voice caught and she dropped to her knees and hugged the\nshaggy head tight against her.\n\nHunter watched ahead, Lyla beside him as they went through the dense\ntrees. Alonzo walked soft-footed behind them, watching the rear. When\nthey came to the first ghost trees and the dwindling of the tiger trees,\nHunter thought it safe to walk slower and talk to her.\n\n\"I saw you go,\" he said. \"I didn't know where until Alonzo came running\nto tell me.\"\n\n\"I heard him bragging about killing, and about his women--I was weak,\nwasn't I?\"\n\n\"Weak?\"\n\n\"I was afraid to face the future, just because it isn't to be exactly\nlike I thought I wanted.\"\n\n\"What was the kind you wanted, Lyla?\"\n\n\"Oh ... I guess I wanted a husband who could see me only, and children,\nand evenings together in the flower garden, and ... well, all the silly,\nsentimental little things that mean so much to a woman.\"\n\nHe thought, _Even with its heart half cut out, it still wanted to live\n... Coat for Janalee ... the strip-tease queen...._\n\nThey passed through the last of the tiger trees and she said, \"We're\nsafe, now. The tigers never attack anyone outside their forest.\"\n\nShe was walking slowly and he said, \"We should get on back before you're\nmissed, shouldn't we?\"\n\n\"Who would miss me?\" she asked. \"So long as I remain physically intact\nfor the marriage night, who cares where or why I went away?\"\n\nThere was the cold bleakness of winter in her eyes as she spoke, and in\nher voice the first undertone of brass. He saw that this was already the\nbeginning of the change that Narf would make in her; the transformation\nof a girl young and wanting to love and be loved into a hard and cynical\nwoman.\n\nHe put his arm around her shoulder, thinking that he should tell her\nthat _he_ cared and that she must never let Narf change her.\n\n\"Lyla, I--\"\n\nHe realized how futile and foolish the words would sound. She would\nmarry Narf, he would return to Earth, and they would never meet again.\nThere were no words for him to speak on this last walk together, no way\nto tell her that he wanted to help her, to protect and care for her. No\nway to express the feeling inside him....\n\nHe did what seemed as natural under the circumstances as it had been for\nhim to put his arm around her in the clearing. He tilted up her face and\nbent his head to kiss her.\n\nAnd walked with jarring impact into the knobby elbow of a ghost tree\nlimb.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n           *       *       *       *\n\nThe sun was down and dusk was darkening the camp when they arrived back\nat her cabin.\n\n\"Thank you, Dale,\" she said. Her hand squeezed his arm. \"I didn't know I\nhad a friend ... but now we'll have to be strangers because--\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nGravel crunched loudly on one of the paths in the ghost trees and they\nlooked back, to see Narf and Sonig coming, walking swiftly. Even at the\ndistance, there was anger like a red aura about Narf.\n\n\"Well,\" Lyla said softly, \"here comes my medicine.\"\n\nSonig stopped at his own cabin, to stand just within the doorway,\nwatching. Narf strode on and stopped before Hunter and Lyla, his face\ntwisted with savage hatred as he looked at Hunter. He spoke to Lyla with\ngrating vehemence:\n\n\"You've done an excellent job of making an ass of yourself--and of\nme--haven't you? Come on in the cabin!\"\n\nNarf seized her by the arm, towering over her as he jerked her around\ntoward the door. Hunter stepped quickly forward, feeling the hot flash\nof his own anger, but there was the paleness of Lyla's face as she\nlooked back, an appeal on it that said, _No!_ He stopped, realizing that\nNarf would not physically harm the woman who would make him king of\nVesta, and that any interference on his part would only make everything\nthe harder for her.\n\nHe watched the two go into the cabin--into Lyla's half--and Narf slammed\nthe door shut behind them. There followed the quick bang of windows\nbeing closed, and then Narf's muffled tirade began: \"_... May think I'm\na fool ... I'm going to tell you a few things...._\"\n\nSonig was still standing within his doorway. Hunter knew, without seeing\nit, that the thin-lipped smile would be on Sonig's face.\n\nHe turned and walked back to his own cabin. There was nothing he could\ndo but withdraw--and listen from a distance and be ready to act if it\nseemed she was in danger.\n\nHe sat on his doorstep in the darkness, hearing occasional phrases in\nNarf's unrelenting abuse. One was: \"_So prim you had to countermand my\norder for a key to that lock--then you went out to play with that second\nlieutenant...._\"\n\nAlonzo materialized out of the darkness, coming as silently as a shadow.\nHe was no longer the bumbling clown. The idiotic grin was gone and his\neyes were green fire, slanted and catlike, his teeth flashing white in a\nsnarl as he looked back toward the sound of Narf's voice.\n\n\"She are _my_ Princess Ryra,\" Alonzo said. \"He are cursing her. If he\never hurt her, I wirr tear out his throat and his river.\"\n\n\"He won't hurt her, Alonzo,\" Hunter said, wishing he could be sure.\n\"He'll only use words on her.\"\n\n\"He never ask her _why_ she run away--he onry curse her and threaten her\nbecause she embarrass him.\"\n\n\"Embarrass him?\"\n\n\"He and Sonig, they see you coming out of the forest with your arm\naround her. They watch with high-power grasses.\"\n\n\"But there was nothing wrong in that--\"\n\n\"That are what Princess Ryra say. She say you onry put your arm around\nher because she are stirr scared of the tigers. And then he say, what\nabout the other? And he cawr her awrful bad names.\"\n\n\"What other?\"\n\n\"Oh, when you are bending down to kiss Princess Ryra and are wawrking\ninto tree.\"\n\nHe gulped. \"_They saw that?_\"\n\n\"Oh, sure. Rord Narf are so mad he want to kirr you right then but Sonig\nsay, 'Wait, I have a pran.' Then Sonig say, 'It are too bad we don't\nhave a camera--we could have made that rootenant the raffing stock of\nforty worlds.'\"\n\nThe thought made Hunter gulp again.\n\n\"What was Sonig's plan that Narf told Lyla about?\" He asked.\n\n\"Oh, he not terr _her_. I hear Sonig terr Rord Narf when I spy. Sonig\nsay, 'Tomorrow we be friendry and we ret those two go for another wawrk\nin the woods. And we have cameras with terescope rens and when they kiss\nand hug we take moving pictures.'\"\n\n\"Why, the gutter-bred rat--\"\n\n\"And Rord Narf say, 'That is what we wirr do. And then I wirr kirr him\nas soon as we have the pictures and she wirr have to toe the mark from\nthen on because if I pubricry show the pictures of what she did, she\nwirr be ashamed to show her face anywhere on Vesta.'\"\n\n\"Why, the--\" He could not think of a suitable expression.\n\n\"And then Sonig say, 'To make sure she go out tomorrow, you bawr her out\ngood so she wirr want to cry on the rootenant's shourder again.' And\nRord Narf say, 'I wirr be very grad to terr the two-timing hussy what I\nthink of her, don't worry.'\"\n\n\"Why, she was only a scared girl and that rat thinks she--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"_... Your promise to your dying father_,\" Narf's voice came in\naccusation. \"_He's gone, now, and you can betray him, too! Why don't you\ngo all the way in your deceptions ... your father will never know...._\"\n\nAlonzo said, \"I think I go back and stay croser to her cabin,\nRootenant.\"\n\nIt was an hour later, and Narf's voice had settled to a low, steady\ngrowling, when Hunter heard a helicopter settle down near the camp. A\nminute later, Val Boran was outlined momentarily in the doorway of the\ncabin he shared with Sonig. There followed the exchange of a few\nwords--interrogation in Val's tone--and then the sound of Sonig's voice\nalone, which continued for minute after minute.\n\n_Sonig is telling him all about it_, Hunter thought, _including my\nwalking into that tree. But there won't be one word in sympathy with\nLyla._\n\nSonig's story ended and Hunter saw Val leave the cabin. He came straight\nup the path toward Hunter, looming tall in the darkness as he stopped\nbefore him. There was the pale gleam of metal in Val's belt--a blaster.\nHis voice came cold and flat:\n\n\"I want to talk to you, Lieutenant.\"\n\nHunter sighed, thinking, _I suppose he wants to kill me, too_.\n\nHe got up and said, \"We'll go inside. Shut the door behind you--I don't\nwant your friend straining his ears to hear us.\"\n\nVal sat tall even in the chair, his face like a carving in a dark\ngranite and his eyes as bright and hard.\n\n\"I understand that you took Princess Lyla into the tiger forest today.\"\nVal's hand was very near the blaster. \"I understand you then played the\nrole of affectionate rescuer.\"\n\n\"Do you believe that story?\" Hunter asked.\n\n\"Do you have a different one?\"\n\n\"You might ask Lyla. Or Alonzo. Alonzo is the one who came to me for\nhelp when he saw she was going out to die.\"\n\n\"To die?\" A startled expression came into the black eyes. \"She _wanted_\nto die?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what happened,\" Hunter said, and told him the story,\nomitting only the embarrassing kissing incident and knowing that Sonig\nhad not.\n\nVal was silent for a while after Hunter finished speaking, then he said,\n\"It isn't for me to comment upon Lord Narf's character or actions. She\nis his wife by her own choice. But the thought of someone else taking\nher out and--\"\n\n\"I know. It wasn't so.\" Then Hunter added, \"You think a great deal of\nher, don't you?\"\n\nVal's face hardened and Hunter thought he would not answer. Then he\nsmiled a little, even though without humor, and said:\n\n\"Since I came here to kill you if I thought you deserved it, I suppose I\nam obligated to answer your question. My regard for Princess Lyla is the\nrespectful one that any civilized man would have for another man's\nwife.\"\n\nThere was an unintended implication in the statement and Hunter made a\nconjecture:\n\n\"You and Princess Lyla were engaged--how long ago?\"\n\nThere was surprise on Val's face, and something like pain quickly\nmasked. \"So she's already making it public information?\"\n\n\"No. I learned of it from ... other sources. I don't know, of course,\nwhy you persuaded her to break the engagement--that's none of my\nbusiness, anyway.\"\n\n\"No,\" Val said. \"It's none of your business. I'll tell you this: _I_\ndidn't ask her to break the engagement. But so long as that was what she\nwanted, I certainly wasn't going to beg her to change her mind.\"\n\nVal stood up to go. \"If you don't mind, I would rather you said nothing\nto Princess Lyla about this visit tonight. I'm afraid my misplaced surge\nof chivalry would make me look like a fool to her.\"\n\nThen, as an afterthought, Val added, \"Mr. Rockford had further business\nin the city.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n           *       *       *       *\n\nIt was late when Narf finally left Lyla's part of the cabin. He went to\nthe cabin occupied by Val and Sonig, aroused Sonig, and the two of them\nwent to the helicopter field. Hunter heard the helicopter leaving for\nthe city a few minutes later. Val's cabin remained dark and after a\nwhile, the light in Lyla's cabin went out.\n\nHe went to bed, but not to sleep. Over and over, a lonely little\nPrincess Lyla clung to him for comfort, crying, while he held her close.\nHe twisted and turned restlessly as he thought of the hours she had sat\nalone and unloved while Narf poured out his hatred and fury on her.\n\nThere was a yearning for her, a desire to hold her and always protect\nher, that would not let him sleep. And he realized the reason why.\n\nHe thought miserably, _I'm in love with her_!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRockford was in bed, snoring loudly, with six empty beer cans on the\nfloor beside him, when Hunter got up. He went outside and found Alonzo\nwaiting for him.\n\n\"They got it awr pranned to kirr you for sure today, Rootenant.\"\n\n\"How?\" he asked.\n\n\"Rast night, Rord Narf and Sonig go to the city and Rord Narf, he hire\nfour bad-rooking men with brasters, and Sonig hire four more that are\nhis countrymen, and they bring these men back and now they are hiding in\nthe woods. And they awrso bring back movie cameras with terescope\nrenses. And Rord Narf raff and say he wirr marry Princess Ryra today\nbefore your dead body is even coor.\"\n\n\"Oh?\" Hunter said. He thought of the snoring Rockford and his words of\ntwo days before: _If you manage to live that long._ How, he wondered,\ncould the lazy old drunkard have made such an accurate guess?\n\n\"And then,\" Alonzo said, \"Rord Narf wake up Princess Ryra--onry I know\nshe wasn't asreep--and he terr her he ruv her and have awready made awr\nthe arrangement for them to get married today, right after runch. And he\nterr her she is right about the Space Guard and she wirr have until\nrunch to tawrk to you about it.\"\n\nThere was the sound of Narf's door opening and closing and Alonzo said,\n\"I go now--Rord Narf might guess that I are terring you things.\"\n\nA few minutes later Narf and Sonig came down the path toward Hunter.\nBoth carried packsacks--the cameras, of course--and both carried\nlong-range rifle blasters.\n\n\"Good morning, lieutenant!\" Narf was smiling and pseudogenial again.\n\"About last night--sometimes a man has to be stern with his wife to\nimpress her. Very foolish thing she did--might have been killed. I'm\nafraid I was so badly shaken with worry over her that I didn't even\nthank you for bringing her back.\"\n\n\"A beautiful morning, lieutenant!\" Sonig was smiling, coming as close to\nbeaming as the nature of his face would permit. \"Lord Narf is going to\ntake me stag hunting this morning--I'll get some lessons from a master.\nDid you ever see his lordship's collection of heads? Amazing!\"\n\n\"But it seems a sportsman's collection is never quite complete,\" Narf\nsaid. He was still smiling but the hatred was burning like a fire in his\neyes as he looked at Hunter. \"There's one more head I must have--I\nintend to get it this morning.\"\n\nNarf and Sonig were gone when Lyla came out of her cabin, her face pale\nand drawn. Val came out of his cabin and the two spoke to each other in\ngreeting. There was a silence, in which neither seemed to know what to\nsay.\n\nFinally, awkwardly, Val said, \"I heard about yesterday, Lyla. Why did\nyou go into the tiger forest?\"\n\n\"Oh ... I was just walking, I guess, and didn't notice where.\"\n\n\"You went there to die, didn't you?\"\n\n\"I ... when you have nothing left--\" Then she lifted her head in a proud\ngesture and said, \"Should it matter to you?\"\n\nFor a moment Val had the look of a man struck. Then it was gone and he\nsaid in an emotionless voice:\n\n\"No. I was asking about something that is only your husband's business.\nI won't do it again.\"\n\nHe turned away, back to his cabin.\n\n\"Val--\" She took a quick step after him, the proud air gone and her arms\noutstretched. \"I didn't mean--\"\n\nHe turned back, his tone politely questioning.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"I only wanted--\" Then her arms dropped and the life went out of her\nvoice. \"What does it matter ... what does anything matter?\"\n\nShe hurried into her cabin and the door closed behind her.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRockford spoke from the doorway behind Hunter:\n\n\"Well, my boy, are you ready for your day's duties?\"\n\nHe followed Rockford inside, where Rockford settled down in the\neasy-chair and yawned.\n\n\"I had a rather busy night,\" he said. \"Certain events occurred yesterday\nafternoon which forced me to change my own plans to some extent. Or to\nset them ahead a day, I should say.\"\n\nHe made an effort to put the vision of Lyla from his mind and asked,\n\"Did you make any progress with Val Boran?\"\n\n\"No, I'm afraid not. Of course, I didn't expect to.\" Rockford yawned\nagain. \"There was another message from Supreme Command. The situation\nis getting worse. Which reminds me of your Duty For The Day and the fact\nthat if you can live through it, you will have it made.\"\n\n_He's my superior_, Hunter thought. _He's supposed to outrank a Space\nPatrol General--and he's amused by the situation he's here to remedy._\n\n\"Right now,\" Rockford said, \"Lyla faces a grim future and feels like she\ndoesn't have a friend in the world. She needs a shoulder to cry on. You\nwill take her for a walk and supply that shoulder.\"\n\nSomehow, even though the order had nothing to do with the Terran-Verdam\ncrisis, he did not have the heart to object. She had been crying before\nshe even reached her door. Later, after he had comforted her, he would\ndemand that Rockford get down to determined effort on the Verdam\nproblem. No more than an hour would be lost by that....\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" he said. \"But in the interests of Princess Lyla's safety, I\nhad better talk to her in her cabin. Alonzo saw Narf and Sonig bring\nback eight--\"\n\n\"Professional killers, to dispose of you,\" Rockford finished. \"I know\nall about it, and I know that Narf took time last night to spend an hour\nwith his favorite girl friend and brag even to her that he was going to\nmarry Lyla today before your dead body had time to get cool.\n\n\"But you just take Lyla for another walk and you will cause the\nbeginning of the end for the Verdam Peoples Worlds. You will go down in\nhistory, my boy, as the man who saved the Terran Republic.\"\n\nHunter went out the door, again feeling a feverish sense of unreality.\nHe was to go forth and get blasted into hamburger and by some mysterious\nprocess known only to Rockford, the Verdam empire would contritely start\ncollapsing....\n\nHe did not knock on her door. He did not think of it as a violation of\nher privacy. She would be feeling too alone and unwanted to care.\n\nShe was not crying as he had thought she would be. She was standing by\nthe window, staring down at the gray, distant desert, her eyes as\nbleakly empty as it.\n\n\"Hello, Lyla,\" he said.\n\n\"Hello, Dale. I was just thinking; this is the day that I, as a woman,\nshould always have dreamed about\"--she tried to smile, and failed, and\nthe brass came into her voice--\"my wedding day!\"\n\n\"Alonzo told me about it.\"\n\nIt seemed to him he should add something, such as to wish her\nhappiness--but such words would be meaningless and farcical and they\nwould both know it.\n\nBut there was no reason why he should endanger her by obeying Rockford's\ninsane order. He would not do it--\n\n\"Ah ... good morning, Lyla!\" Rockford loomed in the doorway, jovial as a\nSanta Claus. \"Did you know Dale wants to go for a walk in the woods\nwith you this bright spring morning--and he's no doubt too bashful to\ntell you so? Do you good to get away from camp\"--there was the\nsuggestion of a pause--\"while you're still free.\"\n\nHe turned a beaming smile on Hunter. \"Don't stand there like a dummy,\nboy--take her by the arm and let her have a last walk with someone who\ncares what happens to her.\"\n\nThere was one thing about Rockford not compatible with his air of fond\nfatherliness: his eyes were hard, gray slate as they looked into\nHunter's and there was no mistaking their expression. Rockford had not\nmade a fatherly suggestion for his own amusement. He had given an order\nthat he intended to be obeyed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n           *       *       *       *\n\nHunter and Lyla walked on through the thickets of ghost trees and arrow\nbrush, each with little to say, Hunter feeling more and more like a\nridiculous fool. They had no destination, no purpose in their walk,\nother than to abide by Rockford's desire that a total of ten assassins\nget a chance to slaughter a certain expendable second lieutenant.\n\nHe did not put his arm around Lyla as they walked. If they killed him,\nit would have to be without their having the satisfaction of the\npictures they wanted with which to blackmail her.\n\nThey came to a tiny clearing, where a cloud tree log made an inviting\nseat in the shade, and Lyla said:\n\n\"No matter how far we walk, I'll have to go back to face it. Let's stop\nhere, and rest a while.\"\n\nHe saw that the clearing was fairly well screened, but certainly not\ncompletely so. It would have to do.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nHe sat down on the log several feet away from her, not wanting to take\nthe chance of her getting hit by accident.\n\n_Not that I'm enthusiastic about getting hit by intent, myself_, he\nthought. _What a way for a Space Guard officer to die._\n\nHe wondered if Rockford would ever inform Headquarters that Lieutenant\nDale Hunter had died in the line of duty--by whatever twisted logic this\ninsane episode could be called duty--and he wondered how the\nCommemoration Roll would read for him.... _Displaying courage above and\nbeyond the call of duty, Lieutenant Hunter sat conspicuously on top of a\nhill and calmly waited for ten assassins to slaughter him...._\n\n\"It's peaceful and quiet here, isn't it?\" Lyla said.\n\nHe had been trying to watch four different directions at once and he\nrealized that the constant swiveling of his neck was causing his stiff\nblouse collar to slowly cut his throat. And he saw that it was--for the\nmoment, anyway--peaceful and quiet where they sat. The sun was warm and\ngolden before them, bright flowers sweetly scented the air, and giant\nrainbow moths were fluttering over them, their tiny voices like the\npiping of a thousand fairy flutes.\n\n\"I wish I had been born a country girl,\" Lyla said. \"I'd like to have a\nlife like this, and not--what mine will be.\"\n\nHe asked the question to which he had to have the answer:\n\n\"Once you were going to marry Val and live on Jardeen, weren't you?\"\n\n\"I ... so my foolishness is no longer a secret?\"\n\n\"Foolishness?\" he asked.\n\n\"We met two years ago when I was attending the Fine Arts university on\nJardeen. I was younger and a lot more na\u00efve then than I am now. I\nthought we were desperately in love and would get married as soon as I\nfinished school and would live happily ever after, and all that.\"\n\n\"And it didn't turn out that way?\"\n\n\"I had to make that promise to Daddy and when I wrote to Val about it,\nhe seemed to approve. He didn't suggest I renounce the proxy marriage\nwhen the time was up, or anything. He just wrote that I knew what I\nwanted to do. He seemed relieved to be free to go ahead with his\npolitical career.\"\n\n\"I see,\" he said, and then, \"you don't feel bad about it, do you, Lyla?\"\n\n\"Feel bad? I wouldn't marry Val Boran if he was the last man on Vesta!\nEven Lord Narf isn't as self-centered as _he_ is!\"\n\n\"You don't have to marry Narf either,\" he said. \"You know that.\"\n\nShe looked down at the ground and said in a dead voice, \"I made a\npromise.\"\n\n\"Rockford told me that your father never really knew Narf--that on the\nfew times they met, Narf put on the act of being a refined gentleman,\nvery respectful toward the king's daughter.\"\n\nShe did not answer and he said, \"Is that the way it was?\"\n\n\"Yes. That's the way it was. But how could I tell Daddy, as he lay\ndying?\"\n\n\"You couldn't, Lyla. But if your father could be here today and know\nwhat you know about Narf, do you think he would want you to marry him?\"\n\n\"No ... I guess not. But Lord Narf loves me in his own way, I think--and\nthat's more than anyone else does.\"\n\nThen her tone changed and she said, \"I'm so glad that you're here today,\nDale--I'm glad that there is someone who cares at least a little about\nwhat happens to me.\"\n\nOn her face was a poignant longing for someone to love and comfort her.\nIt seemed to him, now beyond any doubt, that there could never be\nanything for him in his career but loneliness. How different the warm\nlove of Lyla would be from the cold austerity of the military and its\nendless succession of weapons and killing--\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe moved, to sit beside her and put his arm around her shoulders.\n\"Lyla,\" he said, \"I want to tell you--\"\n\n\"_Dale...._\" The word was a despairing sob as her composure broke and\nshe held tightly to him, crying, her voice coming muffled as she pressed\nher face against his chest. \"Help me, Dale! How can I marry that\nsadistic beast when it's someone else I can't live without--and he\ndoesn't even know I love him!\"\n\n\"But he does!\" He hugged her closer, \"He does know, and he loves you\neven more than you love him.\"\n\n\"Are you sure?\" She raised a tear-stained face, hope like sunshine\nthrough clouds on it. \"Are you really sure Val loves me, after all?\"\n\n\"_Val?_\"\n\nThe revelation was like the stunning concussion shock of a blaster beam\npassing two inches overhead. His vision blurred and there was a hideous\nroaring in his ears. She was still holding to him for comfort and it\nseemed to him that was wrong--he should be clinging to her for\nsupport....\n\n\"_Dale_ ... what's the matter?\"\n\n\"But I thought--\" He swallowed with difficulty. \"I thought you meant\nthat I was the--\"\n\nSomething struck the top of his head; this time, for certain, the\nconcussion shock of a blaster beam passing close above it. There was a\nvicious crack as the beam split the tree beyond, then a crash and\nexplosion of wood fragments as a second beam followed the first.\n\nHe rolled from the log; taking Lyla with him. The arrow bushes shielded\nthem briefly, long enough for them to reach the temporary safety of a\nsmall swale.\n\n\"Dale!\" Her dark eyes were wide with puzzled surprise and one small foot\nwas bare from the loss of a sandal. \"Someone shot at us!\"\n\nHe thought, _So Narf got his pictures, after all_.\n\n\"Rootenant!\" Alonzo came running. \"They are _that_ way--awr spread out\nto be sure to kirr you.\"\n\nAlonzo motioned with his nose, a movement that seemed to cover all the\nhigh ground beyond them. At least, the enemy was not between them and\ncamp. Not yet.\n\nA distant shout came, an order from Narf to his men:\n\n\"_All of you--down that ridge! Get between Hunter and camp!_\"\n\n\"_It's him!_\" Her fingers gripped his arm. \"He wants them to kill you!\"\n\nThey had fired from a distance too great for his own blaster. He could\nnot defy them from where he now stood.\n\n\"I'll have to try to get within range of them,\" he said. \"I'll go\nback--\"\n\n\"_No!_\" Her grip on his arm tightened. \"Don't leave me, Dale--don't let\nhim find me here.\"\n\nHe looked down the length of the swale. At its lower end the ghost tree\nforest began, dense and concealing--but all down the length of the swale\nthe snarevines lay in thick, viciously barbed entanglements, overlying a\nbed of sharp rocks and boulders. She could never get to the safety of\nthe ghost trees in time.\n\nNarf had his pictures, now. What would he do to her in the insanity of\nhis hatred and triumph when he reached her?\n\n\"All right, Lyla,\" he said. \"I'll see that you get to the trees--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n           *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a crashing of explosions and debris leaped skyward behind them\nand along both sides of the swale. The firing continued, scattered but\nvery effectively consistent, and he said as he drew his blaster, \"I\nguess they don't want us to go away.\"\n\nHe set the regulator of the blaster at lowest intensity so that the beam\nwould not clip dangerous flying fragments from the boulders. The green,\ntough vines disintegrated reluctantly while the precious minutes sped\nby; while the unhindered assassins would be hurrying to the point where\nthe entire swale would be visible to them and under their fire.\n\nAlonzo was following along near the top of the swale's side, ignoring\nthe danger as he watched the progress of the enemy and reported it to\nHunter: \"Now they are halfway, Rootenant, hurrying faster--\"\n\nThey reached the lower end of the swale. The last of the vines\ndisintegrated and the ghost tree forest lay before them.\n\nHe touched her cheek in farewell. \"Get on to camp, as fast as you can\nrun.\"\n\nThe firing abruptly ceased as he spoke. There was an ominous silence.\nAlonzo came running, his tone almost a yelp in its urgency:\n\n\"They are awrmost where they can see us! We got to get her out of here,\nRootenant--awrfur quick!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"_Lyla!_\"\n\nIt was the voice of Val, sharp with concern for her. He came running out\nof the ghost trees, all his cold impassiveness gone. \"Are you hurt,\nHoney--are you hurt?\"\n\n\"_You came for me!_\" She whispered the words, her face radiant. Then she\nran to meet him, her arms outstretched, crying, \"_Val ... oh, Val...._\"\n\nTheir arms went around each other.\n\nThen the woods erupted as ten blasters laid down a barrage to block any\nescape to camp.\n\n\"I'll try to give you a chance to get through,\" Hunter said quickly.\n\"Be ready for it when it comes.\"\n\nHe ran toward the firing line, taking advantage of the concealment\nafforded by the first fringe of ghost trees. They should be almost\nwithin range of his own weapon, now--\n\nAgain, the firing abruptly ceased, as though by some signal. There came\nthe furious raving of Narf:\n\n\"_It's that Boran she wants! Kill him, too!_\"\n\nSonig cursed with bitter rage. \"_Jardeen is lost to Verdam if any\nwitness escapes--and we'll all hang, besides._\"\n\nThere was a second of silence, and then Narf's command:\n\n\"_Kill the woman, too!_\"\n\nThere was a roar like thunder as the firing began. The ground trembled\nand debris filled the air with flying fragments. Hunter, still running\ntoward the enemy under cover of the trees, saw Val trying to get Lyla to\nsafety and saw them both hurled to the ground as a tree exploded in\nfront of them. They would never live to rise and run again--\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe saw Rockford's plan, at last, and what his own duty would now have to\nbe. He knew why Rockford had said of this day, \"_If you can live through\nit, you will have it made._\"\n\nAnd he had a cold feeling inside him that he was not going to have it\nmade.\n\nHe took a deep breath and ran toward the enemy, out of the concealment\nof the ghost trees and in the open where they could not fail to see him,\nhis blaster firing a continuous beam that fell only a little short of\nthe enemy, that showed them he would be close enough to kill them within\nseconds if he was not stopped.\n\nThe fire concentrated upon him, giving Lyla and Val their chance for\nescape. He ran through an inferno of crashing explosions, twisting and\ndodging on ground that trembled and heaved under his feet, while\nrazor-sharp rock shrapnel filled the air with shrill, deadly screaming\nsounds.\n\nSomething ripped through his shoulder, to spin him around and send him\nrolling. He scrambled up, firing as he did so, and ran drunkenly on.\n\nSomething struck the side of his head and he went down again. He tried\nto rise and fell back, a blackness sweeping over him that he could not\nhold away despite his efforts to do so.\n\nIt seemed to him that the firing had suddenly stopped, that in its place\nwas the hoarse buzz of a police stun-beam. It seemed he saw helicopters\noverhead, bearing the bright blue insignia of the Royal Guard and then\nthere was nothing but the blackness.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a brief, dreamlike return to consciousness. He was in a Royal\nGuard helicopter and Alonzo was beside him, grinning, and saying, \"You\nbe O.K.--I grad! And my Princess Ryra--rook at her now, Rootenant!\"\n\nHe saw Lyla, her hand in Val's, and her face was glowing and beautiful\nin its new-found happiness. Then she was bending down, kissing him, and\nsaying, \"Dale ... Dale ... how can we ever thank you for what you did?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen the blackness lifted the second time he was lying, bandaged, on a\ncot in the meeting hall and the voice of Rockford was saying, \"... Ready\nto go in just a minute.\"\n\nThe hall was filled with members of the royal court who had come for the\nwedding. He saw the white robes of Church of Vesta dignitaries who had\ncome to officiate at the wedding. Then he saw the seven grim old men\nseated at the far end of the table.\n\nThe Royal Council--with the judicial power to give even death sentences\nin crimes committed against royalty.\n\nSonig, his face white and staring, was being half led, half carried,\naway from them.\n\nNarf, in the grip of another Guardsman, was standing before the Council\nand saying in a tone both incredulous and sneering:\n\n\"Is that my sentence?\"\n\n\"There is a qualification to it,\" one of the Council said. \"It seems\nonly just, in view of your crime, that you be tortured until death--\"\n\nThe rest of the words were lost as the blackness swept back. But before\nunconsciousness was complete, when all else in the hall was gone from\nhim, he heard Narf's cry; an animal-like bawl of protest, raw and hoarse\nwith anguish....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Ah ... you're coming out of it, my boy.\"\n\nRockford was standing over him. \"They gave you a Restoration shot on\nVesta forty-eight hours ago. It will be wearing off in a minute and your\nhead will clear.\"\n\nHe sat up, and the dizziness faded swiftly away. He saw that he was in\nthe compartment of an interstellar ship and he knew that it was\nEarthbound.\n\nAnd that Vesta, and brown-eyed Lyla, were now part of the past....\n\n\"Don't look so sad, my boy,\" Rockford said. \"You'll get due credit and\npromotion for the invaluable part you played in my plan.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"I know. But she was never yours. You'll find life is full of\nheartbreaks like that, son.\n\n\"And we accomplished our mission. Narf's crime neatly invalidated the\nproxy marriage. Then Lyla set a new precedent by marrying Val that very\nday. Earth has never had two such loyal and grateful friends as Val and\nLyla.\"\n\n\"You knew all about them, didn't you?\" he asked.\n\n\"Strategic Service has to know everything. And I knew they were still\nin love even though each was too proud to admit it. That's why I had to\ninsist on Val coming to Vesta. After that, it was only a matter of using\nyou to awaken Val to the fact that she did _not_ love Narf. And of\ntaking care of various little details, such as faking an official\nrequest for the helicopters to come out two hours ahead of time, getting\nVal off to find her at the proper time, and so on.\"\n\nRockford smiled at him, \"And you learned that an old man's mind can be\nmightier than the space fleets of the Verdam empire--and that the line\nof duty that produces the best results can sometimes be very devious.\"\n\nHe thought of the white-faced Sonig, and the anguished bawl he had heard\nfrom Narf.\n\n\"I suppose they were going to hang Narf and Sonig at once.\"\n\n\"The Council would have, no doubt. But Lyla was so happy that she begged\nthe Council to give them very light sentences--or just let them go free.\nSo I suggested a compromise. The Royal Council regarded it as very\nfitting.\"\n\n\"What was it?\"\n\n\"For Sonig, no punishment. The murder attempt, being news of public\ninterest, will be broadcast upon Vesta and other worlds, including a\nfactual, unbiased account of Sonig's participation in it. Shortly\nafterward, Sonig will be taken to Verdam and turned over to his own\nbenevolent government. Vesta will file no charges.\"\n\n\"But Sonig lost Jardeen for his government. They'll execute him for\nthat!\"\n\n\"Yes. I'm afraid so. Shall we call it poetic justice?\"\n\n\"What about Narf?\"\n\n\"His sentence was life-long exile on his Sea Island estate. He will be\nprovided with all the luxuries to which he has been accustomed,\nincluding a full staff of servants. He will continue to enjoy all his\npossessions there, including his gallery of nude paintings, his risqu\u00e9\nfilms, his pornographic library, and so on. In fact, since he is so\nfascinated by pornography and such a collector thereof, any pornographic\nmaterial which might become available on Vesta in the future will be\nsent to him.\"\n\n\"That's not right ... I mean, they were going to torture him to death.\"\n\n\"Not 'to death'. It was 'until death'. There's a difference.\"\n\n\"But that bawling noise he made--\"\n\n\"Ah ... that was due to the one restrictive qualification to the benign\nterms of his exile. Every woman on his estate was to be removed before\nhe reached there, leaving men servants only. Patrol boats will see to it\nthat for so long as he lives no woman shall ever set foot on the Sea\nIslands.\"\n\nRockford smiled again. \"Lord Narf succeeded beyond his wildest dreams in\nkeeping his boyhood vow of being always a man among men.\"\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note\n\nThis etext was produced from _Analog Science Fact and Fiction_ December\n1962.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
