If you walk outside,\nmaybe as far as the rocket field, you notice a difference.\n\nPast the narrow developed strip around the dome, the desert land lies\nas chilled and brittle as it did for eons before Earthmen reached\nMars. The sky is suddenly raw and cruel. You pull your furs around\nyour nose and check your oxygen mask, and wish you were _inside_\nsomething, even a thin wall of clear plastic.\n\nI like to stand here, though, and look out at it, just thinking about\nhow far those ships grope out into the dark nowadays, and about the\nmen who have gone out there on a few jets and a lot of guts. I knew a\nbunch of them ... some still out there, I guess.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThere was a time when nearly everything had to be rocketed out from\nEarth, before they organized all those chemical tricks that change the\nMartian crops to real food. Domes weren't fancy then. Adequate, of\ncourse; no sense in taking chances with lives that cost so much fuel\nto bring here. Still, the colonies kept growing. Where people go,\nothers follow to live off them, one way or another. It began to look\nlike time for the next step outward.\n\nOh, the Asteroids ... sure. Not them. I did a bit of hopping there in\nmy own time. In fact--on account of conditions beyond my choice and\ncontrol--I spent too much time on the wrong side of the hull shields.\nOne fine day, the medics told me I'd have to be a Martian for the rest\nof my life. Even the one-way hop back to Earth was \"not recommended.\"\n\nSo I used to watch the ships go out. I still remember one that almost\nmissed leaving. _The Martian Merchant._ What joker thought that would\nbe a good name for an exploring ship I can't imagine, but it always\nhappens that way.\n\nI was starting my cross-country tractor line then, and had just made\nthe run from Schiaparelli to Asaph Dome, which was not as nice as it\nis now but still pretty civilized for the time. They had eight or ten\nbars, taverns, and other amusements, and were already getting to be\nquite a city.\n\nOne of the taverns near the western airlock was named the _Stardust_,\nand I was approaching, measuring the sand in my throat, when these\nspacers came out. The first one in sight was a blocky, dark-haired\nfellow. He came rolling through the door with a man under each arm.\n\nJust as I got there, he made it to his feet somehow and cracked their\nheads together exactly hard enough to bring peace. He acted like a man\nused to handling things with precision. He glanced quickly at me out\nof a square, serious face, then plunged back through the splintered\ndoor toward the breakup inside.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn a moment, he came out again, with two friends who looked the worse\nfor wear. The tall, lean youngster wore a junior pilot's bands on the\nsleeves of his blue uniform. His untidy hair was rumpled, as if\nsomeone had been hanging onto it while in the process of giving him\nthe shiner.\n\nThe other one was shorter and a good deal neater. Even with his tunic\nripped down the front, he gave the impression of making it his life\nbusiness to be neat. He was turning gray at the temples and growing a\nlittle bulge under his belt, which lent a dignity worthy of his trim\nmustache and expression of deferential politeness. He paused briefly\nto hurl an empty bottle at someone's head.\n\n\"Better take the alley there,\" I told the blocky one, on impulse.\n\"It'll bring you out at the tractor lot and I'll give you a lift to\nyour ship.\"\n\nHe wasted no time on questions, just grabbed his friends and\ndisappeared before the crowd came out. I walked around a couple of\ncorners and back to my tractor bus. This lot was only a clear space\ninside the Number Four Airlock. At that time, two or three tractors\ncame in every day from the mines or other domes. Most of the traffic\nwas to and from the spaceport.\n\n\"Who's that?\" asked a low voice from the shadows.\n\n\"Tony Lewis,\" I answered.\n\nThe three of them moved into the dim light from the airlock guardpost.\n\n\"Thanks for the steer,\" said the blocky one, \"but we can stay till\nmorning.\"\n\nHe seemed as fresh as if he had just landed. His friends were a trifle\nworn around the edges.\n\n\"Keep playing that rough,\" I said, \"and you may not make it to\nmorning.\"\n\nHe just grinned. \"We have to,\" he said, \"or the ship can't blast off.\"\n\n\"Oh, you three make the ship go, huh?\"\n\n\"Just about. This is Hugh Konnel, the third pilot; the gent with the\ndignified air is Ron Meadows, the steward. I'm Jim Howlet, and I look\nafter the fuel system.\"\n\nI admitted that the ship could hardly do without them. Howlet's\nexpression suggested that he was searching his memory.\n\n\"Lewis ...\" he murmured. \"I've heard of Tony Lewis somewhere. You a\nspacer?\"\n\n\"Used to be,\" I told him. \"Did some piloting in the Belt.\"\n\nYoung Konnel stopped fingering his eye.\n\n\"Oh, I've heard of you,\" he said. \"Even had to read some of your\nreports.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter that, one thing led to another, with the result that I offered\nto find somewhere else to relax. We walked south from the airlock,\npast a careless assortment of buildings. In those days, there was not\nmuch detailed planning of the domes. What was necessary for safety and\nfor keeping the air thicker and warmer than outside was done right;\nthe remaining space was grabbed by the first comers.\n\nStreets tended to be narrow. As long as an emergency truck could\nsqueeze through at moderate speed, that was enough. The buildings grew\nhigher toward the center of the dome, but I stopped while they were\nstill two stories.\n\nThe outside of Jorgensen's looked like any other flimsy construction\nunder the dome. We had just passed a row of small warehouses, and the\nonly difference seemed to be the lighted sign at the front.\n\n\"We can stop at the bar inside while we order dinner,\" I said.\n\n\"Sounds good,\" said Howlet. \"I could go for a decent meal. Rations on\nan exploring ship run more to calories than taste.\"\n\nThe pilot muttered something behind us. Howlet turned his head.\n\n\"Don't worry about it, Hughie,\" he retorted. \"It'll be all over the\ndome by tomorrow anyway.\"\n\n\"But they said not to--\"\n\n\"Mr. Lewis won't say anything, and he's not the only spacer who'll\nguess it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was easy to figure out. Ships did little exploring in the Belt\nnow--plenty of untouched rocks there but nothing really unknown.\n\"Exploring\" could only mean that a hop to Jupiter was in the works at\nlast. There had already been rumors about a few wide swings outside\nthe Belt.\n\nWell, it was just about time.\n\nI would have liked to go too, and it was more than just a spacer's\ncuriosity. To my mind, man _had_ to move out in space. Being only\nhalfway in control of his own planetary system was no state to be\nfound in by the first interstellar visitors.\n\nThat is a meeting bound to happen sooner or later. It would be better\nfor the human race to be able to do the visiting, I thought.\n\nThe inside of Jorgensen's always surprised new visitors to Asaph Dome.\nIt was different from anything on Earth, and yet not too much like the\nreal Mars either. That way, Jorgensen hoped to catch both the\nsandeaters and the tourists. The latter came to rough it in local\ncolor, the former to dream of a better world.\n\n\"Hey! Look at the stars over the bar!\" exclaimed Howlet.\n\nTo begin with, the bar was of pinkish sandstone, smoothed and covered\nby a coating of plastic. Behind it, instead of less imaginative\nmirrors or bottle displays, Jorgensen had had some drifter paint a\nnight desert: all dull pink and bronze crags smothering in sand under\na black sky. The stars twinkled like glass beads, which they were.\nLights were dim enough to hide the Martian austerity of the metal\nfurnishings.\n\n\"The Earth tourists spend a lot of time here,\" I told the trio. \"Seems\nthey'd rather look at that sky than the real one outside the dome.\"\n\nThe dining room was for the souls of the locals, who could admire the\ndesert more conveniently than find a good meal. It was mostly green\nand white, with a good deal of the white being crystal. In the\ncorners stood fake pine trees which Jorgensen had repainted every\nmonth; but what drew the sandeaters was the little fountain in the\nmiddle of the room.\n\nReal water!\n\nOf course, it was the same gallon or two pumped around and around, but\nclear, flowing water is a sight on Mars. When the muddy trickles in\nthe canals began to make you feel like diving in for a swim, you\nstopped in at Jorgensen's to watch the fountain while his quiet, husky\nwaiters served your dinner most efficiently.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Say, this is a cut or two above ship chow,\" admitted Konnel when the\nfood arrived. \"What's that? Music too?\"\n\n\"They have a trio that plays now and then,\" I told him. \"Sometimes a\nsinger too, when not much is going on in the back room.\"\n\n\"Back room?\" Howlet caught up the words.\n\n\"Never mind. What would you do right now with a million? Assuming you\ncould beat the wheel or the other games in the first place.\"\n\n\"Do they use ... er ... real money?\" asked Meadows, cocking an\neyebrow.\n\n\"Real as you like,\" I assured him. \"It collects in these places. I\nguess lots of sandeaters think they might pick up a first-class fare\nback to Earth.\"\n\n\"Do they?\" inquired Konnel, chewing on his steak.\n\nThe string trio, which had been tuning up, eased into a quiet song as\nhe spoke. We listened as the question hung in the air, and I decided\nthat the funny feeling under my belt was homesickness, all the\nstranger because I owned three homes not too far from the Martian\nequator.\n\n\"As far as I know,\" I answered, \"the luck seems to run to those who\ncan't go back anyway, for one reason or another. The ones just waiting\nfor a lucky night to go home rich ... are still waiting.\"\n\nThe door to the back room opened, letting through a blend of talk and\nsmall mechanical noises. It also emitted a strikingly mismatched\ncouple.\n\nThe girl was dark-haired and graceful, though not very tall. She wore\na lavender gown that showed a good deal of trim back as she turned to\nwalk toward the musicians, and what the gown overlooked the walk\ndemonstrated. The man was fat enough to make him seem short until he\napproached. His face and baldish dome were desert-reddened, and his\neyebrows were faded to invisibility. Jorgensen.\n\nNodding casually to various diners, he noticed the new faces at our\ntable. He ambled over lightly for one of his bulk, and it became\napparent that he was far from being blubbery. His belly stuck out, but\nhe could probably knock the wind out of you with it.\n\n\"Hello, Tony!\" he said in a wheezy tenor. \"Introducing some friends to\nthe best hamburger joint on Mars?\"\n\nThen he leaned on the back of Konnel's chair and told a couple of his\nold prospecting yarns to make sure everybody was happy, while the girl\nbegan to sing with the trio. She had hardly enough voice to be heard\nover Jorgensen's stories. I noticed Konnel straining to listen.\n\nFinally, Jorgensen saw it too. Leaving Howlet and Meadows grinning at\na highly improbable adventure, he slapped the boy on the shoulder.\n\n\"I see you noticed Lilac Malone, boy. Like to buy her coffee?\"\n\n\"C-coffee?\" stuttered Konnel.\n\n\"Made with water,\" I reminded him. \"Awful waste here. Like champagne.\"\n\n\"I'll tell her she's invited,\" said Jorgensen, waggling a finger at\nher.\n\n\"The fellows are going out in the morning,\" I tried to head him off.\n\"They don't have much time--\"\n\n\"All the more reason to meet Lilac while they can!\"\n\nWe watched her finish her song. She had rhythm, and the lavender dress\nswirled cutely around her in the Martian gravity; but, of course,\nLilac would never have made a singer on Earth. Her voice was more\ngood-natured than musical.\n\nShe arrived with the coffee, said \"hello\" to me, waved good-bye to\nJorgensen's back, and set out to get acquainted with the others.\nCatching Howlet's wink, and suspecting that he was used to getting\nKonnel back to space-ships, I relaxed and offered to show Meadows the\nback room.\n\nHe muttered something about his gray hairs, but came along after an\namused glance at Lilac and Konnel.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJorgensen's gambling room was different from the bar and dining room\nas they were from each other. Decorations were simple. Drapes of\nvelvety synthetic, dyed the deep green that Martian colonists like,\ncovered the walls. Indirect lighting gave a pretty gleam to the metal\ngadgets on the tables. Because they used a heavier ball, roulette\nlooked about the same as on Earth, and the same went for the dice\ngames.\n\n\"Interesting,\" Meadows murmured, feeling in his pocket.\n\nHe pointed a thumb at the _planets_ table. It was round, with a small,\nrectangular projection for the operator's controls and calculator. In\nthe nine differently colored circular tracks, rolled little globes\nrepresenting the planets. These orbits were connected by spirals of\ncorresponding colors, symbolic of ship orbits swooping inward or\noutward to other planets.\n\n\"You pick yourself two planets,\" I explained. \"For better odds, pick a\nstart and a destination. The man throws his switch and each little\nball is kicked around its groove by a random number of electrical\nimpulses.\"\n\n\"And how do I win?\"\n\n\"Say you pick Venus-to-Saturn. See that silver spiral going out from\nVenus and around the table to the orbit of Saturn? Well, if Venus\nstops within that six-inch zone where the spiral starts _and_ if\nSaturn is near where it ends, you scoop in the stardust.\"\n\nMeadows fingered his mustache as he examined the table.\n\n\"I ... ah ... suppose the closer you come, the more you win, eh?\"\n\n\"That's the theory. Most people are glad to get anything back. It's\nhonest enough, but the odds are terrific.\"\n\nA couple of spacers made room for us, and I watched Meadows play for a\nfew minutes. The operator grinned when he saw me watching. He had a\nlean, pale face and had been an astrogator until his heart left him in\nneed of Martian gravity.\n\n\"No coaching, Tony!\" he kidded me.\n\n\"Stop making me look like a partner in the place!\" I answered.\n\n\"Thought one night you were going to be.... No winners, gentlemen.\nNext bets!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe spheres had come to rest with Pluto near one end of a lavender\nspiral and Mercury touching the inner end, but no one had had the\ninsanity to bet that way. Meadows began to play inner planet\ncombinations that occasionally paid, though at short odds. He made a\nbit on some near misses, and I decided to have a drink while he lost\nit.\n\nI found Howlet, Konnel, and Lilac Malone in the bar admiring the\nred-bronze landscape. When he heard about Meadows, Howlet smiled.\n\n\"If it isn't fixed, they better prepare to abandon,\" he laughed.\n\"People look at that face and won't believe he always collects half\nthe ship's pay.\"\n\nLilac saw a chance to do her duty, and suggested that we all go in to\nsupport Meadows. I stayed with my drink until Jorgensen drifted in to\nhave a couple with me and talk of the old days.\n\nAfter a while, one of his helpers came up and murmured something into\nhis big red ear. He shrugged and waved his hand.\n\nThe next time it happened, about twenty minutes later, I was on the\npoint of matching him with a story about a petrified ancient Martian\nthat the domers at Schiaparelli dug out of a dry canal. Jorgensen\nlowered his faded eyebrows and strode off like a bear on egg-shells,\nleaving me there with the unspoken punch line about what they were\nsupposed to have dug up with the Martian.\n\n_Well, that build-up was wasted_, I thought.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nQuite a number of sandeaters, as time passed, seemed to drift in and\nout of the back room. Finally, Howlet showed up again.\n\n\"How'd you make out?\" I asked when he had a drink in his hand.\n\n\"I left my usual deposit,\" he grinned, \"but you ought to see Meadows!\nIs he ever plugging their pipes! He ran Mercury to Pluto, and it paid\noff big.\"\n\n\"It ought to; no one ever makes it.\"\n\n\"He did it _twice_! Plus other combinations. With him making out our\ndaily menus, I'll never know why I'm not lucky too. Know what he's\ndoing?\"\n\nI lifted an eyebrow.\n\n\"He's lending money to every loafer that puts the beam on him. But the\nguy has to show a non-transferrable ticket for passage to Earth.\"\n\n\"Darn few can,\" I grunted.\n\n\"That's why he keeps sending them out with the price of one and the\npromise to stake them when they get back. I never saw such\nexpressions!\"\n\nAt that point, Jorgensen sailed through the curtained doorway between\nthe bar and back room. A craggy, desert look had settled on his red\nmoon-face. He introduced me to two men with him as if someone were\ncounting down from ten.\n\n\"Glad to meet you and Mr. Howlet,\" said the one called McNaughton.\n\nI recognized \"Mr. V'n Uh\" as Van Etten, a leading citizen of the dome\nwho had been agitating with McNaughton and others of the Operating\nCommittee to form a regular police department. Jorgensen seemed to\nhave something else on his mind.\n\n\"Howlet, how about having a word with your shipmate?\"\n\n\"What's he done wrong?\" asked Howlet blandly.\n\nJorgensen scowled at a pair of baggy-seated sandeaters who strode\nthrough the front door with pale green tickets clutched in their\nhands. They sniffed once at the bar, but followed their stubbled chins\ninto the back room at max acc.\n\n\"I don't say it's wrong,\" growled Jorgensen, glaring after the pair.\n\"It just makes the place look bad.\"\n\n\"Oh, it's good advertising, Jorgy,\" laughed McNaughton. \"People were\nforgetting that game could be beaten. Now, Mr. Howlet--\"\n\nJorgensen talked him under.\n\n\"It's not losing a little money that I mind--\"\n\nSome of the drink I was sneaking slipped down the wrong way.\n\n\"Well, it's _not_!\" bellowed Jorgensen. \"But if they all pick up the\nbroadcast that this is where to get a free ride home, I'll have just\nanother sand trap here.\"\n\nHowlet shrugged and put down his glass. Van Etten nudged me and made a\nface, so I got up first.\n\n\"Never mind,\" I said. \"Being the one that took him in there, I'll\ncheck.\"\n\nTwo more men came through the front door. The big one looked like a\nbodyguard. The one with the dazed look carried a small metal case that\ncould be unfolded into a portable desk. He went up to Jorgensen and\nasked where he could set up a temporary ticket office for Interplanet.\n\nWhile I was watching over my shoulder, three or four sandeaters coming\nout of the back room shoved me aside to get at him. The last I saw\nbefore leaving was Van Etten shushing Jorgensen while McNaughton\ngrabbed Howlet by the tunic zipper for a sales talk.\n\nInside, after getting through the crowd at the _planets_ table, I\ncould see that a number of betters were following Meadows' plays,\nmaking it that much worse for Jorgensen. Even Konnel had a small pile\nbefore him, although he seemed to be losing some of Lilac's attention\nto Meadows. While the little spheres spun in their orbits, the steward\ncounted out money into twitching palms, wrote names on slips of paper,\nand placed bets. Somehow, he hit a winner every five or six bets,\nwhich kept his stack growing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI joggled Lilac's elbow and indicated Konnel.\n\n\"How about taking him out for a drink so an old customer can squeeze\nin for a few plays?\" I said.\n\nThe money-glow faded gradually from her eyes as she focused on me. She\ntook her time deciding; but from the way she snuggled up to Konnel to\nwhisper in his ear, it looked as if she might really be stuck on him.\nHe winked at me.\n\nSuch a gasp went up as we changed places that I thought my cuff must\nhave brushed Pluto, but it was just Meadows making a long-odds hop\nfrom Earth to Uranus. The operator no longer even flinched before\npunching the distances and bet on his little computer, and groping in\nhis cash drawer to pay off.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI stood there a few minutes, wondering if the game could be fixed\nafter all. Still, the man who invented it also made encoding machines\nfor the Earth space fleet. Meadows must be having a run of blind\nluck--no time to interrupt.\n\nOn my way out, Howlet caught me at the door of the bar.\n\n\"How about some coffee?\" he asked. \"We'll have to start back soon.\nYou'll be surprised at the time. Dining room still open?\"\n\n\"Always. Okay, let's sober up and watch the fountain.\"\n\nOnly two or three women and a dozen men sat in the restaurant now. The\npart-time musicians had disappeared for a few hours of sleep before\ntheir usual jobs. We ordered a thermos pot of coffee and Howlet asked\nme about McNaughton.\n\n\"I guess it was on the level,\" he said when I described the man's\nCommittee position. \"He got a boost out of how they had to patch up\nsome troublemaker he knew, after that bar fight we had. Wanted to make\nme chief cop here.\"\n\n\"Some domes have regular police forces already,\" I confirmed.\n\n\"So he said. Claimed a lot of police chiefs have been elected as\nmayors. Then he said that someday there will be a Martian Assembly,\nand men with a start in dome politics will be ready for it, and so\non.\"\n\n\"He's exactly right,\" I admitted. \"When do you figure to start?\"\n\n\"Maybe the next time I pass through.\" He winked. \"If it's still open.\"\n\nI relaxed and grinned at him. Somehow, I liked his looks just then.\n\n\"You shouldn't be gone too long. It's a good spot to put your ladder\ndown.\"\n\nHe helped himself to more coffee and stared into his cup. I knew--the\nwatches near the end of a hop when you wondered about the dead, oily\nair, when the ones off watch kept watching the astrogator's\nexpression, when you got the idea it was time to come in out of the\ndark before you made that one slip.\n\n_How many pick their landing?_ I thought. _How many never know how\nclose they come to making their mistake, or being a statistic in\nsomebody else's?_\n\n\"Why the double trance?\" asked Meadows.\n\nHe brought with him a vague memory of departing chatter and tramping\nfeet in the background. Howlet shoved out a chair for him.\n\n\"Everything okay?\" asked Jorgensen, bustling up. \"Buy anyone a\ndrink?\"\n\n\"What have they got there ... coffee?\" asked Meadows, sniffing.\n\n\"Jimmy!\" yelled Jorgensen to a waiter. \"Pot of coffee for Ron! Hot!\"\n\nHe slapped Meadows' shoulder and took his glowing red face away.\n\n\"What makes him your buddy?\" I asked Meadows.\n\n\"In the end, I missed Mercury by ten inches and they got most of it\nback!\"\n\nThen was no answer to that. He must have been half a million ahead.\n\n\"What about the sandeaters you promised to stake?\" asked Howlet,\ngrinning like a man who has seen it happen before but still enjoys it.\n\n\"Some of them helped me lose it,\" said Meadows. \"Now they will all\njust have to use those tickets, I suppose. Where's Hughie and his\nlittle friend? Coffee all around and we'll get on course, eh?\"\n\n\"Thought he was with you,\" answered Howlet.\n\n\"I'll look in the bar,\" I volunteered, remembering the kid had left\nwith more of a roll than Meadows had now.\n\nA casual search of the bar and back room revealed both nearly empty, a\nnatural condition just before dawn. No one had seen Konnel,\napparently, so I went outside and squinted along the dim, narrow\nstreet. Four or five drunks, none tall enough to be Konnel, were\nslowly and softly singing their way home. The door slid open behind me\nand the other two came out quickly.\n\n\"Oh, there you are! I asked around too,\" said Howlet in a low voice.\n\"Can you trust that Jorgensen? They wouldn't let me in the office\nbehind the back room.\"\n\n\"He's a better sport than he looks,\" I said.\n\n\"I wonder,\" murmured Meadows. \"He looked queer when I was so far\nahead. Or maybe one of his huskies got ideas about keeping a handy\nhostage....\"\n\nHowlet suddenly looked dangerous. I gathered that he thought something\nof the boy, and was heating up to the door-smashing stage.\n\n\"Let's check one other place,\" I suggested, \"before we make a\nmistake.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMy starting off fast up the street left him the choice of coming\nquietly or staying to wonder. They both came. I could feel them\nwatching me.\n\nI turned right into a narrow street, went along it about fifty yards,\nand paused where it was crossed by a still narrower alley. Hoping I\nremembered the way, I groped along the lefthand branch of the alley. A\ntrace of light had begun to soften the sky over the dome, but had not\nyet seeped down to ground level.\n\nHowlet's soft footsteps trailed me. I knocked on what seemed to be the\nright door. There was no answer--only to be expected. I hammered\nagain.\n\n\"No one aboard, it would appear,\" murmured Meadows.\n\nIt was meant as a question. I shrugged in the darkness and banged\nlonger and louder. Finally, listening at the flimsy panel, I detected\nmuffled footsteps.\n\nThe door opened a crack.\n\n\"It's Tony Lewis, Lilac.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe black opening widened, until she must have seen the two behind me.\nShe wore a thin robe that glimmered silver in the dim light.\n\n\"Send the boy out, Lilac,\" I said.\n\n\"Why should I?\"\n\nThat much was good; she might have pretended not to have him there.\n\n\"He has to catch his ship, Lilac.\"\n\nBehind me, I heard Howlet stir uneasily. The door began to close, but\nmy foot was in the track. Howlet could not see that.\n\n\"Don't shut it, sister,\" he said, \"or we'll smash it down!\"\n\nHe could have too, in about ten seconds, the way they build on Mars.\n\n\"You wanna get yourself lynched?\" Lilac warned him.\n\n\"Over a--on account of _you_?\"\n\n\"Shut up, Howlet!\" I interrupted. \"Let me talk to the lady alone!\"\n\nHe must have understood my tone; he let Meadows pull him away a few\nsteps.\n\n\"And less of the 'lady' business outa _you_,\" said Lilac, but low\nenough to keep it private. \"We both know Mars, so let's take things\nthe way they are.\"\n\n\"That's why I came, Lilac. Taking things that way means he has to go.\"\n\n\"What're you gonna say? He has a job to do, or some such canal dust?\"\n\n\"Not exactly. They might pick up another third pilot. They might\nmanage somehow without any. But he won't like himself much, later, for\nmissing his chance.\"\n\nShe swung the edge of the door back and forth in impatient little\njerks. Finally, she took her hand off the latch and let it roll free.\nShe still blocked the opening, however, and I waited.\n\n\"Look, Tony,\" she said after a pause, \"what makes you think I couldn't\nsettle down with him? I never figured to be an ... entertainer ... all\nmy life. With the stake I already got together, we could start\nsomething. A mine, maybe, or a tractor service like yours. Mars is\ngrowing--\"\n\n\"Pull your head inside the dome and breathe right!\" I snapped at her.\n\"I don't mind your dreaming, Lilac, but there isn't any more time.\"\n\nIt was light enough now to see her stiffen. She glared at me.\n\n\"You tryin' to say I couldn't make a home here? You know better, Tony.\nSome of the best known women on Mars didn't exactly come here\nfirst-class!\"\n\nI held up my hand. She was beginning to get loud.\n\n\"It wouldn't matter if you were a princess. It's not what he'd think\nof you; it's what he'd wonder about himself, piloting a sand-buggy\ninstead of a rocket.\"\n\nIn the alley, one of the spacers shuffled his feet impatiently. I\nhurried on, hoping to clinch it before she turned stubborn.\n\n\"_You_, at least, ought to understand men better than most, Lilac.\nMaybe it doesn't make sense, but it would be smarter to grab him after\nhe's had his share of space instead of before.\"\n\nIt was hard to breathe without sounding loud in the stillness. Just as\nI had to swallow or choke, Lilac's shoulders slumped an inch or two.\n\n\"I'll wake him up,\" she said in a tired voice.\n\nFeeling as if I had struck her, I stepped back into the alley. A few\nminutes later, Konnel slipped out and shut the door behind him. No one\nsaid a word. From the set of his shoulders, it seemed that he might be\njust as glad the alley was dim; but he simply trailed along behind.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe walked back to Number Four Airlock in a silence that had me\ncounting the footsteps. When we reached the tractor parking lot, I\ncleared my throat.\n\n\"Wait a minute. I'll warm up my sand-saucer and give you a lift to\nyour ship.\"\n\n\"Maybe we won't need to impose on you any more, Tony,\" said Howlet.\n\"Looks like those machines over there are going out.\"\n\nI followed his gesture and, by luck, caught the eye of a driver I\nknew. I waved and jerked my thumb at the spacers beside me.\n\n\"Let's go!\" said Howlet as the tractor slowed. \"Thanks for everything,\nTony. Get yourself some sleep; the night watches in these domes are\nrough.\"\n\nKonnel waited until they were a few steps away. Even then, he\nhesitated.\n\n\"Forget it!\" I said. \"You aren't the first spacer they had to pump out\nof some odd corner. Look me up when you get back!\"\n\nHe shook hands and trotted after his friends. They scrambled up the\nladder to the cab. The tractor picked up speed, lumbering into the\nairlock.\n\nLater, a little after noon, I crawled out of bed and watched the flare\nof their pipes as the ship streaked up into the dark Martian sky. I\nhoped they would make it--almost as much as I wished it could have\nbeen me.\n\nWell, I still come out to the wall of whatever dome I find myself in,\nto watch the sky a while--not that I'll see _those_ boys coming down\nat this late date! They must have splattered to a puddle on Jupiter,\nor slipped back into the sun, or taken up a cold, dark orbit out where\nthey'll never bother anyone. Nobody will ever know for sure, I\nsuppose.\n\nIf I had it to do over again?\n\nNo, of course I don't feel funny about it. If they weren't the ones,\nit would have been another crew. By the law of averages, a certain\nnumber of bad tries seems to go with every new push out into space.\nMaybe there's no reason it has to be like that, but it always has.\nWhen the bad luck is used up, someone makes a new frontier.\n\nWhy say \"superstition\"? Each new orbit out from the sun has cost\nplenty in money, ships, and lives; it's the admission price.\n\nSure, it was too bad about Konnel and his little girl--who, by the\nway, later married a very important man in Asaph Dome. It would have\nbeen nice to see Meadows wind up rich, or for Howlet to become mayor\nof the dome, but what could I do? Which one should I have talked into\nstaying for the sake of love or money or power, without even being\nable to go in his place?\n\nEvery time Man pushes ahead a little, a percentage of the pushers pay\nthe fare. Still, it will be healthier if we push out of this planetary\nsystem before someone else pushes in.\n\nFor all we know, they may be on the way.\n\nTHE END\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Fee of the Frontier, by Horace Brown Fyfe\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK FEE OF THE FRONTIER ***\n\n***** This file should be named 30901.txt or 30901.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/0/9/0/30901/\n\nProduced by Sankar Viswanathan, Greg Weeks, and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
