The lazy\nswells of the ocean held the same soft color, darkened with crimson\nveins where spirals of weed drifted. A rose world bathed in soft\nsunlight, knowing only gentle winds, peace, and--sloth.\n\nRoss Murdock leaned forward over the edge of the rock ledge to peer down\nat a beach of fine sand, pale pink sand with here and there a glitter of\na crystalline \"shell\"--or were those delicate, fluted ovals shells? Even\nthe waves came in languidly. And the breeze which ruffled his hair,\nsmoothed about his sun-browned, half-bare body, caressed it, did not\nbuffet on its way inland to stir the growths which the Terran settlers\ncalled \"trees\" but which possessed long lacy fronds instead of true\nbranches.\n\nHawaika--named for the old Polynesian paradise--a world seemingly\nwithout flaw except the subtle one of being too perfect, too welcoming,\ntoo wooing. Its long, uneventful, unchanging days enticed forgetfulness,\noffered a life without effort. Except for the mystery....\n\nBecause this world was not the one pictured on the tape which had\nbrought the Terran settlement team here. A map, a directing guide, a\ndescription all in one, that was the ancient voyage tape. Ross himself\nhad helped to loot a storehouse on an unknown planet for a cargo of such\ntapes. Once they had been the space-navigation guides for a race or\nraces who had ruled the star lanes ten thousand years in his own world's\npast, a civilization which had long since sunk again into the dust of\nits beginning.\n\nThose tapes returned to Terra after their chance discovery, were\nstudied, probed, deciphered by the best brains of his time, shared out\nby lot between already suspicious Terran powers, bringing into the\nexploration of space bitter rivalries and old hatreds.\n\nSuch a tape had landed their ship on Hawaika, a world of shallow seas\nand archipelagoes instead of true continents. The settlement team had\nhad all the knowledge contained on that tape crowded into them, only to\ndiscover that much they had learned from it was false!\n\nOf course, none of them had expected to discover here still the cities,\nthe civilization the tape had projected as existing in that long-ago\nperiod. But no present island string they had visited approximated those\non the maps they had seen, and so far they had not found any trace that\nany intelligent beings had walked, built, lived, on these beautiful,\nslumberous atolls. So, what had happened to the Hawaika of the tape?\n\nRoss's right hand rubbed across the ridged scars which disfigured his\nleft one, to be carried for the rest of his life as a mark of his\nmeeting with the star voyagers in the past of his own world. He had\ndeliberately seared his own flesh to break the mental control they had\nasserted. Then the battle had gone to him. But from it he had brought\nanother scar--the unease of that old terror when Ross Murdock, fighter,\nrebel, outlaw by the conventions of his own era, Ross Murdock who\nconsidered himself an exceedingly tough individual, that toughness\nsteeled by the training for Time Agent sorties, had come up against a\npower he did not understand, instinctively hated and feared.\n\nNow he breathed deeply of the wind--the smell of the sea, the scents of\nthe land growths, strange but pleasant. So easy to relax, to drop into\nthe soft, lulling swing of this world in which they had found no fault,\nno danger, no irritant. Yet, once those others had been here--the\nblue-suited, hairless ones he called \"Baldies.\" And what had happened\nthen ... or afterward?\n\nA black head, brown shoulders, slender body, broke the sleepy slip of\nthe waves. A shimmering mask covered the face, catching glitter-fire in\nthe sun. Two hands freed a chin curved yet firmly set, a mouth made more\nfor laughter than sternness, wide dark eyes. Karara Trehern of the Alii,\nthe one-time Hawaiian god-chieftain line, was an exceedingly pretty\ngirl.\n\nBut Ross regarded her aloofly, with a coldness which bordered on\nhostility, as she flipped her mask into its pocket on top of the\ngill-pack. Below his rocky perch she came to a halt, her feet slightly\napart in the sand, an impish twist to her lips as she called mockingly:\n\n\"Why not come in? The water's fine.\"\n\n\"Perfect, like all the rest of this.\" Some of his impatience came out in\nthe sour tone. \"No luck, as usual?\"\n\n\"As usual,\" Karara conceded. \"If there ever was a civilization here,\nit's been gone so long we'll probably never find any traces. Why don't\nyou just pick out a good place to set up that time-probe and try it\nblind?\"\n\nRoss scowled. \"Because\"--his patience was exaggerated to the point of\ninsult--\"we have only one peep-probe. Once it's set we can't tear it\ndown easily for transport somewhere else, so we want to be sure there's\nsomething to look at beyond.\"\n\nShe began to wring the water out of her long hair. \"Well, as far as\nwe've explored ... nothing. Come yourself next time. Tino-rau and Taua\naren't particular; they like company.\"\n\nPutting two fingers to her mouth, Karara whistled. Twin heads popped out\nof the water, facing the shore and her. Projecting noses, mouths with\nupturned corners so they curved in a lasting pleasant grin at the\nmammals on the shore--the dolphin pair, mammals whose ancestors had\nchosen the sea, whistled back in such close counterfeit of the girl's\nsignal that they could be an echo of her call. Years earlier their\nspecies' intelligence had surprised, almost shocked, men. Experiments,\ntraining, co-operation, had developed a tie which gave the water-limited\nrace of mankind new eyes, ears, minds, to see, evaluate, and report\nconcerning an element in which the bipeds were not free.\n\nHand in hand with that co-operation had gone other experiments. Just as\nthe clumsy armored diving suits of the early twentieth century had\nallowed man to begin penetration into a weird new world, so had the\nfrog-man equipment made him still freer in the sea. And now the\ngill-pack which separated the needed oxygen from the water made even\nthat lighter burden of tanks obsolete. But there remained depths into\nwhich man could not descend, whose secrets were closed to him. There the\ndolphins operated, in a partnership of minds, equal minds--though that\nlast fact had been difficult for man to accept.\n\nRoss's irritation, unjustified as he knew it to be, did not rest on\nTino-rau or Taua. He enjoyed the hours when he buckled on gill-pack and\ntook to the sea with those two ten-foot, black-and-silver escorts\nsharing the action. But Karara ... Karara's presence was a different\nmatter altogether.\n\nThe Agents' teams had always been strictly masculine. Two men partnered\nfor an interlocking of abilities and temperaments, going through\ntraining together, becoming two halves of a strong and efficient whole.\nBefore being summarily recruited into the Project, Ross had been a\nloner--living on the ragged edges of the law, an indigestible bit for\nthe civilization which had become too ordered and \"adjusted\" to absorb\nhis kind. But in the Project he had discovered others like himself--men\nborn out of time, too ruthless, too individualistic for their own age,\nbut able to operate with ease in the dangerous paths of the Time Agents.\n\nAnd when the time search for the wrecked alien ships had succeeded and\nthe first intact ship found, used, duplicated, the Agents had come from\nforays into the past to be trained anew for travel to the stars. First\nthere had been Ross Murdock, criminal. Then there had been Ross Murdock\nand Gordon Ashe, Time Agents. Now there was still Ross and Gordon and a\nquest as perilous as any they had known. Yet this time they had to\ndepend upon Karara and the dolphins.\n\n\"Tomorrow\"--Ross was still not sorting out his thoughts, truly aware of\nthe feeling which worked upon him as a thorn in the finger--\"I will\ncome.\"\n\n\"Good!\" If she recognized his hostility for what it was, that did not\nbother her. Once more she whistled to the dolphins, waved a casual\nfarewell with one hand, and headed up the beach toward the base camp.\nRoss chose a more rugged path over the cliff.\n\nSuppose they did not find what they sought near here? Yet the old taped\nmap suggested that this was approximately the site starred upon it.\nMarking a city? A star port?\n\nAshe had volunteered for Hawaika, demanded this job after the disastrous\nTopaz affair when the team of Apache volunteers had been sent out too\nsoon to counter what might have been a Red sneak settlement. Ross was\nstill unhappy over the ensuing months when only Major Kelgarries and\nmaybe, in a lesser part, Ross had kept Gordon Ashe in the Project at\nall. That Topaz had been a failure was accepted when the settlement ship\ndid not return. And that had added to Ashe's sense of guilt for having\nrecruited and partially trained the lost team.\n\nAmong those dispatched over Ashe's vehement protests had been Travis Fox\nwho had shared with Ashe and Ross the first galactic flight in an\nage-old derelict spaceship. Travis Fox--the Apache archaeologist--had he\never reached Topaz? Or would he and his team wander forever between\nworlds? Did they set down on a planet where some inimical form of native\nlife or a Red settlement had awaited them? The very uncertainty of their\nfate continued to ride Ashe.\n\nSo he insisted on coming out with the second settlement team, the\nvolunteers of Samoan and Hawaiian descent, to carry on a yet more\nexciting and hazardous exploration. Just as the Project had probed into\nthe past of Terra, so would Ashe and Ross now attempt to discover what\nlay in the past of Hawaika, to see this world as it had been at the\nheight of the galactic civilization, and so to learn what they could\nabout their fore-runners into space. And the mystery they had dropped\ninto upon landing added to the necessity for that discovery or\ndiscoveries.\n\nTheir probe, if fortune favored them, might become a gate through time.\nThe installation was a vast improvement over these passage points they\nhad first devised. Technical information had taken a vast leap forward\nafter Terran engineers and scientists had had access to the tapes of the\nstellar empire. Adaptations and shortcuts developed, so that a new\nhybrid technology came into use, woven from the knowledge and\nexperimentation of two civilizations thousands of years apart in time.\n\nIf and when he or Ashe--or Karara and her dolphins--discovered the\nproper site, the two Agents could set up their own equipment. Both Ross\nand Ashe had had enough drill in the process. All they needed was the\nbrick of discovery; then they could build their wall. But they must find\nsome remainder of the past, the smallest trace of ancient ruin upon\nwhich to center their peep-probe. And since landing here the long days\nhad flowed into weeks with no such discovery made.\n\nRoss crossed the ridge of rock which formed a cocks-comb rise on the\nisland's spine and descended to the village. As they had been trained,\nthe Polynesian settlers adapted native products to their own heritage of\nbuilding and tools. It was necessary that they live off the land, for\ntheir transport ship had had storage space only for a limited number of\nsupplies and tools. After it took off to return home they would be\nwholly on their own for several years. Their ship, a silvery ball,\nrested on a rock ledge, its pilot and crew having lingered to learn the\nresults of Ashe's search. Four days more and they would have to lift for\nhome even if the Agents still had only negative results to report.\n\nThat disappointment was driving Ashe, the way that six months earlier\nhis outrage and guilt feelings over the Topaz affair had driven him.\nKarara's suggestion carried weight the longer Ross thought about it.\nWith more swimmers hunting, there was just that much increased chance of\nturning up some clue. So far the dolphins had not reported any dangerous\nnative sea life or any perils except the natural ones any diver always\nhad at his shoulder under the waves.\n\nThere were extra gill-packs, and all of the settlers were good swimmers.\nAn organized hunt ought to shake the Polynesians out of their present\ndo-it-tomorrow attitude. As long as they had had definite work before\nthem--the unloading of the ship, the building of the village, all the\nlabors incidental to the establishing of this base--they had shown\nenergy and enthusiasm. It was only during the last couple of weeks that\nthe languor which appeared part of the atmosphere here had crept up on\nthem, so that now they were content to live at a slower and lazier pace.\nRoss remembered Ashe's comparison made the evening before, likening\nHawaika to a legendary Terran island where the inhabitants lived a\ndrugged existence, feeding upon the seeds of a native plant. Hawaika was\nfast becoming a lotus land for Terrans.\n\n\"Through here, then westward....\" Ashe hunched over the crate table in\nthe mat-walled house. He did not look up as Ross entered. Karara's still\ndamp head was bowed until those black locks, now sleeked to her round\nskull, almost touched the man's close-cropped brown hair. They were both\nstudying a map as if they saw not lines on paper but the actual inlets\nand lagoons which that drawing represented.\n\n\"You are sure, Gordon, that this _is_ the modern point to match the site\non the tape?\" The girl brushed back straying hair.\n\nAshe shrugged. There were tight brackets about his mouth which had not\nbeen there six months ago. He moved jerkily, not with the fluid grace of\nthose old days when he had faced the vast distance of time travel with\nunruffled calm and a self-confidence to steady and support the novice\nRoss.\n\n\"The general outline of these two islands could stand for the capes on\nthis--\" He pulled a second map, this on transparent plastic, to fit over\nthe first. The capes marked on the much larger body of land did slip\nover the modern islands with a surprising fit. The once large island,\nshattered and broken, could have produced the groups of atolls and\nislets they now prospected.\n\n\"How long--\" Karara mused aloud, \"and why?\"\n\nAshe shrugged. \"Ten thousand years, five, two.\" He shook his head. \"We\nhave no idea. It's apparent that there must have been some world-wide\ncataclysm here to change the contours of the land masses so much. We may\nhave to wait on a return space flight to bring a 'copter or a hydroplane\nto explore farther.\" His hand swept beyond the boundaries of the map to\nindicate the whole of Hawaika.\n\n\"A year, maybe two, before we could hope for that,\" Ross cut in. \"Then\nwe'll have to depend on whether the Council believes this important\nenough.\" The contrariness which spiked his tongue whenever Karara was\npresent made him say that without thinking. Then the twitch of Ashe's\nlip brought home Ross's error. Gordon needed reassurance now, not a\nrecitation of the various ways their mission could be doomed.\n\n\"Look here!\" Ross came to the table, his hand sweeping past Karara, as\nhe used his forefinger for a pointer. \"We know that what we want could\nbe easily overlooked, even with the dolphins helping us to check. This\nwhole area's too big. And you know that it is certain that whatever\nmight be down there would be hidden with sea growths. Suppose ten of us\nstart out in a semi-circle from about here and go as far as this point,\nheading inland. Video-cameras here and here ... comb the whole sector\ninch by inch if we have to. After all, we have plenty of time and\nmanpower.\"\n\nKarara laughed softly. \"Manpower--always manpower, Ross? But there is\nwoman-power, too. And we have perhaps even sharper sight. But this is a\ngood idea, Gordon. Let me see--\" she began to tell off names on her\nfingers, \"PaKeeKee, Vaeoha, Hori, Liliha, Taema, Ui, Hono'ura--they are\nthe best in the water. Me ... you, Gordon, Ross. That makes ten with\nkeen eyes to look, and always there are Tino-rau and Taua. We will take\nsupplies and camp here on this island which looks so much like a finger\ncrooked to beckon. Yes, somehow that beckoning finger seems to me to\npromise better fortune. Shall we plan it so?\"\n\nSome of the tight look was gone from Ashe's face, and Ross relaxed. This\nwas what Gordon needed--not to be sitting in here going over maps,\nreports, reworking over and over their scant leads. Ashe had always been\na field man; and the settlement work had been stultifying, a laborious\nchore for him.\n\nWhen Karara had gone Ross dropped down on the bunk against the side\nwall.\n\n\"What _did_ happen here, do you think?\" Half was real interest in the\nmystery they had mulled over and over since they had landed on a Hawaika\nwhich diverged so greatly from the maps; the other half, a desire to\nkeep Ashe thinking on a subject removed from immediate worries. \"An\natomic war?\"\n\n\"Could be. There are old radiation traces. But these aliens had, I'm\nsure, progressed beyond atomics. Suppose, just suppose, they could\ntamper with the weather, with the balance of the planet's crust? We\ndon't know the extent of their powers, how they would use them. They had\na colony here once, or there would have been no guide tape. And that is\nall we are sure of.\"\n\n\"Suppose\"--Ross rolled over on his stomach, pillowed his head on his\narms--\"we could uncover some of that knowledge--\"\n\nThe twitch was back at Ashe's lips. \"That's the risk we have to run\nnow.\"\n\n\"Risk?\"\n\n\"Would you give a child one of those hand weapons we found in the\nderelict?\"\n\n\"Naturally not!\" Ross snapped and then saw the point. \"You mean--_we_\naren't to be trusted?\"\n\nThe answer was plain to read in Ashe's expression.\n\n\"Then why this whole setup, this hunt for what might mean trouble?\"\n\n\"The old pinch, the bad one. What if the Reds discover something first?\nThey drew some planets in the tape lottery, remember. It's a seesaw\nbetween us--we advance here, they there. We have to keep up the race or\nlose it. They must be combing their stellar colonies for a few answers\njust as furiously as we are.\"\n\n\"So, we go into the past to hunt if we have to. Well, I think I could do\nwithout answers such as the Baldies would know. But I will admit that I\nwould like to know what did happen here--two, five, ten thousand years\nago.\"\n\nAshe stood up and stretched. For the first time he smiled. \"Do you know,\nI rather like the idea of fishing off Karara's beckoning finger. Maybe\nshe's right about that changing our luck.\"\n\nRoss kept his face carefully expressionless as he got up to prepare\ntheir evening meal.\n\n\n\n\n2\n\nLair of Mano-Nui\n\n\nJust under the surface of the water the sea was warm, weird life showed\ncolors Ross could name, shades he could not. The corals, the animals\nmasquerading as plants, the plants disguised as animals which inhabited\nthe oceans of Terra, had their counterparts here. And the settlers had\ngiven them the familiar names, though the crabs, the fish, the anemones,\nand weeds of the shallow lagoons and reefs were not identical with\nTerran creatures. The trouble was that there was too much, such a wealth\nof life to attract the eyes, hold attention, that it was difficult to\nkeep to the job at hand--the search for what was not natural, for what\nhad no normal place here.\n\nAs the land seduced the senses and bewitched the off-worlder, so did the\nsea have its enchantment to pull one from duty. Ross resolutely skimmed\nby a forest of weaving, waving lace which varied from a green which was\nalmost black to a pale tint he could not truly identify. Among those\nwaving fans lurked ghost-fish, finned swimmers transparent enough so\nthat one could sight, through their pallid sides, the evidences of\nrecently ingested meals.\n\nThe Terrans had begun their sweep-search a half hour ago, slipping\noverboard from a ferry canoe, heading in toward the checkpoint of the\nfinger isle, forming an arc of expert divers, men and girls so at home\nin the ocean that they should be able to make the discovery Ashe\nneeded--if such did exist.\n\nMystery built upon mystery on Hawaika, Ross thought as he used his\nspear-gun to push aside a floating banner of weed in order to peer below\nits curtain. The native life of this world must always have been largely\naquatic. The settlers had discovered only a few small animals on the\nislands. The largest of which was the burrower, a creature not unlike a\nminiature monkey in that it had hind legs on which it walked erect and\nforepaws, well clawed for digging purposes, which it used with as much\nskill and dexterity as a man used hands. Its body was hairless and it\nwas able to assume, chameleon-like, the color of the soil and rocks\nwhere it denned. The head was set directly on its bowed shoulders\nwithout vestige of neck; and it had round bubbles of eyes near the top\nof its skull, a nose which was a single vertical slit, and a wide mouth\nfanged for crushing the shelled creatures on which it fed. All in all,\nto Terran eyes, it was a vaguely repulsive creature, but as far as the\nsettlers had been able to discover it was the highest form of land life.\nThe smaller rodentlike things, the two species of wingless diving birds,\nand an odd assortment of reptiles and amphibians sharing the island were\nall the burrowers' prey.\n\nA world of sea and islands, what type of native intelligent life had it\nonce supported? Or had this been only a galactic colony, with no native\npopulation before the coming of the stellar explorers? Ross hovered\nabove a dark pocket where the bottom had suddenly dipped into a\nsaucer-shaped depression. The sea growth about the rim rippled in the\nwater raggedly, but there was something about its general outline....\n\nRoss began a circumference of that hollow. Allowing for the distortion\nof the growths which had formed lumpy excrescences or reached turrets\ntoward the surface--yes, allowing for those--this was decidedly\nsomething out of the ordinary! The depression was too regular, too even,\nRoss was certain of that. With a thrill of excitement he began a descent\ninto the cup, striving to trace signs which would prove his suspicion\ncorrect.\n\nHow many years, centuries, had the slow coverage of the sea life\ngathered there, flourished, died, with other creatures to build anew on\nthe remains? Now there was only a hint that the depression had other\nthan a natural beginning.\n\nAnchoring with a one-handed grip on a spike of Hawaikan coral--smoother\nthan the Terran species--Ross aimed the butt of his spear-gun at the\nnearest wall of the saucer, striving to reach into a crevice between two\nlumps of growth and so probe into what might lie behind. The spear\nrebounded; there was no breaking that crust with such a fragile tool.\nBut perhaps he would have better luck lower down.\n\nThe depression was deeper than he had first judged. Now the light which\nexisted in the shallows vanished. Red and yellow as colors went, but\nRoss was aware of blues and greens in shades and tints which were not\nvisible above. He switched on his diving torch, and color returned\nwithin its beam. A swirl of weed, pink in the light, became darkly\nemerald beyond as if it possessed the chameleon ability of the\nburrowers.\n\nHe was distracted by that phenomenon, and so he transgressed the diver's\nrule of never becoming so absorbed in surroundings as to forget caution.\nJust when did Ross become aware of that shadow below? Was it when a\nschool of ghost-fish burst unexpectedly between weed growths, and he\nturned to follow them with the torch? Then the outer edge of his beam\ncaught the movement of a shape, a flutter in the water of the gloomy\ndepths.\n\nRoss swung around, his back to the wall of the saucer, as he aimed the\ntorch down at what was arising there. The light caught and held for a\nlong moment of horror something which might have come out of the\nnightmares of his own world. Afterward Ross knew that the monster was\nnot as large as it seemed in that endless minute of fear, perhaps no\nbigger than the dolphins.\n\nHe had had training in shark-infested seas on Terra, been carefully\nbriefed against the danger from such hunters of the deep and ocean\njungles. But this kind of thing had only existed before in the fairy\ntales of his race as the dragon of old lore. A scaled head with wide\neyes gleaming in the light beam with cold and sullen hate, a gaping\nmouth fang-filled, a horn-set muzzle, that long, undulating neck and,\nbelow it, the half-seen bulk of a monstrous body.\n\nHis spear-gun, the knife at his waist belt, neither were protection\nagainst this! Yet to turn his back on that rising head was more than\nRoss could do. He pulled himself back against the wall of the saucer.\nThe thing before him did not rush to attack. Plainly it had seen him and\nnow it moved with the leisure of a hunter having no fears concerning the\neventual outcome of the hunt. But the light appeared to puzzle it and\nRoss kept the beam shining straight into those evil eyes.\n\nThe shock of the encounter was wearing off; now Ross edged his flipper\ninto a crevice to hold him steady while his hand went to the sonic-com\nat his waist. He tapped out a distress call which the dolphins could\nrelay to the swimmers. The swaying dragon head paused, held rigid on a\nstiff, scaled column in the center of the saucer. That sonic vibration\neither surprised or bothered the hunter, made it wary.\n\nRoss tapped again. The belief that if he tried to escape, he was lost,\nthat only while he faced it so had he any chance, grew stronger. The\nhead was only inches below the level of his flippered feet as he held to\nthe weeds.\n\nAgain that weaving movement, the rise of head, a tremor along the\nserpent neck, an agitation in the depths. The dragon was on the move\nagain. Ross aimed the light directly at the head. The scales, as far as\nhe could determine, were not horny plates but lapped, silvery ovals such\nas a fish possessed. And the underparts of the monster might even be\nvulnerable to his spear. But knowing the way a Terran shark could absorb\nthe darts of that weapon and survive, Ross feared to attack except as a\nlast resort.\n\nAbove and to his left there was a small hollow where in the past some\nportion of the growths had been ripped away. If he could fit himself\ninto that crevice, perhaps he could keep the dragon at bay until help\narrived. Ross moved with all the skill he had. His hand closed upon the\nedge of the niche and he whirled himself up, just making it into that\nrefuge as the head lashed at him wickedly. His suspicion that the dragon\nwould attack anything on the run was well founded, and he knew he had no\nhope of winning to the surface above.\n\nNow he stood in the crevice, facing outward, watching the head darting\nin the water. He had switched off the torch, and the loss of light\nappeared to bewilder the reptile for some precious seconds. Ross pulled\nas far back into the niche as he could, until the point of one shoulder\ntouched a surface which was sleek, smooth, and cold. The shock of that\ncontact almost sent him hurtling out again.\n\nGripping the spear before him in his right hand, Ross cautiously felt\nbehind him with the left. His finger tips glided over a seamless surface\nwhere the growths had been torn or peeled away. Though he could not, or\ndared not, turn his head to see, he was certain that this was his proof\nthat the walls of the saucer had been fashioned and placed there by some\nintelligent creature.\n\nThe dragon had risen, hovering now in the water directly before the\nentrance to Ross's hole, its neck curled back against its bulk. It had\nwide flippers moving like planes to hold it poised. The body, sloping\nfrom a massive round of shoulders to a tapering rear, was vaguely\nfamiliar. If one provided a Terran seal with a gorgon head and scales in\nplace of fur, the effect would be similar. But Ross was assuredly not\nfacing a seal at this moment.\n\nSlight movement of the flippers kept it as stabilized as if it sprawled\non a supporting surface. With the neck flattened against the body, the\nhead curved downward until the horn on its snout pointed the tip\nstraight at Ross's middle. The Terran steadied his spear-gun. The\ndragon's eyes were its most vulnerable targets; if the creature launched\nthe attack, Ross would aim for them.\n\nBoth man and dragon were so intent upon their duel that neither was\nconscious of the sudden swirl overhead. A sleek dark shape struck down,\nskimming across the humped-back ridge of the dragon. Some of the\nsettlers had empathy with the dolphins to a high degree, but Ross's own\npowers of contact were relatively feeble.\n\nOnly now he was given an assurance of aid, and a suggestion to attack.\nThe dragon head writhed, twisted as the reptile attempted to see above\nand behind its own length. But the dolphin was only a streak fast\ndisappearing. And that writhing changed the balance the monster had\nmaintained, pushing it toward Ross.\n\nThe Terran fired too soon and without proper aim, so the dart snaked\npast the head. But the harpoon line half hooked about the neck and\nseemed to confuse the creature. Ross squirmed as far back as he could\ninto his refuge and drew his knife. Against those fangs the weapon was\nan almost useless toy, but it was all he had.\n\nAgain the dolphin dived in attack on the reptile, this time seizing in\nits mouth the floating cord of the harpoon and giving it a jerk which\njolted the dragon even more off balance, pulling it away from Ross's\nniche and out into the center of the saucer.\n\nThere were two dolphins in action now, Ross saw, playing the dragon as\nmatadors might play a bull, keeping the creature disturbed by their\nagile maneuvers. Whatever prey came naturally to the Hawaikan monster\nwas not of this type, and the creature was not prepared to deal\neffectively with their teasing, dodging tactics. Neither had touched the\nbeast, but they kept it constantly striving to get at them.\n\nThough it swam in circles attempting to face its teasers, the dragon did\nnot abandon the level before Ross's refuge, and now and then it darted\nits head at him, unwilling to give up its prey. Only one of the dolphins\nfrisked and dodged above now as the sonic on Ross's belt vibrated\nagainst his lower ribs with its message warning to be prepared for\nfurther action. Somewhere above, his own kind gathered. Hurriedly he\ntapped out in code his warning in return.\n\nTwo dolphins busy again, their last dive over the dragon pushing the\nmonster down past Ross's niche toward the saucer's depths. Then they\nflashed up and away. The dragon was rising in turn, but coming to meet\nthe Hawaikan creature was a ball giving off light, bringing sharp vision\nand color with it.\n\nRoss's arm swung up to shield his eyes. There was a flash; such\nanswering vibration carried through the waves that even his nerves, far\nless sensitive than those of the life about him, reacted. He blinked\nbehind his mask. A fish floated by, spiraling up, its belly exposed. And\nabout him growths drooped, trailed lifelessly through the water; while\nthere was a now motionless bulk sinking to the obscurity of the\ndepression floor. A weapon perfected on Terra to use against sharks and\nbarracuda had worked here to kill what could have been more formidable\nprey.\n\nThe Terran wriggled out of the niche, rose to meet another swimmer. As\nAshe descended, Ross relayed his news via the sonic. The dolphins were\nalready nosing into the depths in pursuit of their late enemy.\n\n\"Look here--\" Ross guided Ashe to the crevice which had saved him, aimed\nthe torch beam into it. He had been right! There was a long groove in\nthe covering built up by the growths; a vertical strip some six feet\nlong, of a uniform gray, showed. Ashe touched the find and then gave the\nalert via the sonic code.\n\n\"Metal or an alloy, we've found it!\"\n\nBut what did they have? Even after an hour's exploration by the full\ncompany, Ashe's expert search with his knowledge of artifacts and\nancient remains, they were still baffled. It would require labor and\ntools they did not have, to clear the whole of the saucer. They could be\nsure only of its size and shape, and the fact that its walls were of an\nunknown substance which the sea could cloak but not erode. For the\nlength of gray surface showed not the slightest pitting or time wear.\n\nDown at its centermost point they found the dragon's den, an arch coated\nwith growth, before which sprawled the body of the creature. That was\ndragged aloft with the dolphins' aid, to be taken ashore for study. But\nthe arch itself ... was that part of some old installation?\n\nTorches to the fore, they entered its shadow, only to remain baffled.\nHere and there were patches of the same gray showing in its interior.\nAshe dug the butt of his spear-gun into the sand on the flooring to\nuncover another oval depression. But what it all signified or what had\nbeen its purpose, they could not guess.\n\n\"Set up the peep-probe here?\" Ross asked.\n\nAshe's head moved in a slow negative. \"Look farther ... spread out,\" the\nsonic clicked.\n\nWithin a matter of minutes the dolphins reported new remains--two more\nsaucers, each larger than the first, set in a line on the ocean floor,\npointing directly to Karara's Finger Island. Cautiously explored, these\nwere discovered to be free of any but harmless life; they stirred up no\nmore dragons.\n\nWhen the Terrans came ashore on Finger Island to rest and eat their\nmidday meal one of the men paced along the beached dragon. Ashore it\nlost none of its frightening aspect. And seeing it, even beached and\ndead, Ross wondered at his luck in surviving the encounter without a\nscratch.\n\n\"I think that this one would be alone,\" PaKeeKee commented. \"Where there\nis an eater of this size, there is usually only one.\"\n\n\"Mano-Nui!\" The girl Taema shivered as she gave to this monster the name\nof the shark demon of her people. \"Such a one is truly king shark in\nthese waters! But why have we not sighted its like before? Tino-rau,\nTaua ... they have not reported such--\"\n\n\"Probably because, as PaKeeKee says, these things are rare,\" Ashe\nreturned. \"A carnivore of size would have to have a fairly wide hunting\nrange, yet there's evidence that this thing has laired in that den for\nsome time. Which means that it must have a defined hunting territory\nallowing no trespassing from others of its species.\"\n\nKarara nodded. \"Also it may hunt only at intervals, eat heavily, and lie\nquiet until that meal is digested. There are large snakes on Terra that\nfollow that pattern. Ross was in its front yard when it came after\nhim--\"\n\n\"From now on\"--Ashe swallowed a quarter of fruit--\"we know what to watch\nfor, and the weapon which will finish it off. Don't forget that!\"\n\nThe delicate mechanisms of their sonics had already registered the\nvibrations which would warn of a dragon's presence, and the depth globes\nwould then do the rest.\n\n\"Big skull, oversize for the body.\" PaKeeKee squatted on his heels by\nthe head lying on the sand at the end of the now fully extended neck.\n\nRoss had heretofore been more aware of the armament of that head, the\nfangs set in the powerful jaws, the horn on the snout. But PaKeeKee's\ncomment drew his attention to the fact that the scale-covered skull did\ndome up above the eye pits in a way to suggest ample brain room. Had the\nthing been intelligent? Karara put that into words:\n\n\"Rule One?\" She went over to survey the carcass.\n\nRoss resented her half question, whether it was addressed to him or mere\nthinking aloud on her part.\n\nRule One: Conserve native life to the fullest extent. Humanoid form may\nnot be the only evidence of intelligence.\n\nThere were the dolphins to prove that point right on Terra. But did Rule\nOne mean that you had to let a monster nibble at you because it might\njust be a high type of alien intelligence? Let Karara spout Rule One\nwhile backed into a crevice under water with that horn stabbing at her\nmid-section!\n\n\"Rule One does not mean to forego self-defense,\" Ashe commented mildly.\n\"This thing is a hunter, and you can't stop to apply recognition\ntechniques when you are being regarded as legitimate prey. If you are\nthe stronger, or an equal, yes--stop and think before becoming\naggressive. But in a situation like this--take no chances.\"\n\n\"Anyway, from now on,\" Karara pointed out, \"it could be possible to\nshock instead of kill.\"\n\n\"Gordon\"--PaKeeKee swung around--\"what have we found here--besides this\nthing?\"\n\n\"I can't even guess. Except that those depressions were made for a\npurpose and have been there for a long time. Whether they were\noriginally in the water, or the land sank, that we don't know either.\nBut now we have a site to set up the peep-probe.\"\n\n\"We do that right away?\" Ross wanted to know. Impatience bit at him. But\nAshe still had a trace of frown. He shook his head.\n\n\"Have to make sure of our site, very sure. I don't want to start any\nchain reaction on the other side of the time wall.\"\n\nAnd he was right, Ross was forced to admit, remembering what had\nhappened when the galactics had discovered the Red time gates and traced\nthem forward to their twentieth-century source, ruthlessly destroying\neach station. The original colonists of Hawaika had been as giants to\nTerran pygmies when it came to technical knowledge. To use even a\npeep-probe indiscreetly near one of their outposts might bring swift and\nterrible retribution.\n\n\n\n\n3\n\nThe Ancient Mariners\n\n\nAnother map spread out and this time pinned down with small stones on\nbeach gravel.\n\n\"Here, here, and here--\" Ashe's finger indicated the points marked in a\npattern which flared out from three sides of Finger Island. Each marked\na set of three undersea depressions in perfect alliance with the land\nwhich, according to the galactic map, had once been a cape on a much\nlarger land mass. Though the Terrans had found the ruins, if those\nsaucers in the sea could be so termed, the remains had no meaning for\nthe explorers.\n\n\"Do we set up here?\" Ross asked. \"If we could just get a report to send\nback....\" That might mean the difference between awakening the\nco-operation of the Project policy makers so that a flood of supplies\nand personnel would begin to head their way.\n\n\"We set up here,\" Ashe decided.\n\nHe had selected a point between two of the lines where a reef would\nprovide them with a secure base. And once that decision was made, the\nTerrans went into action.\n\nTwo days to go, to install the peep-probe and take some shots before the\nship had to clear with or without their evidence. Together Ross and Ashe\nfloated the installation out to the reef, Ui and Karara helping to tow\nthe equipment and parts, the dolphins lending pushing noses on occasion.\nThe aquatic mammals were as interested as the human beings they aided.\nAnd in water their help was invaluable. Had dolphins developed hands,\nRoss wondered fleetingly, would they have long ago wrested control of\ntheir native world--or at least of its seas--from the human kind?\n\nAll the human beings worked with practiced ease, even while masked and\nsubmerged, to set the probe in place, aiming it landward at the check\npoint of the Finger's protruding nail of rock. After Ashe made the final\nadjustments, tested each and every part of the assembly, he gestured\nthem in.\n\nKarara's swift hand movement asked a question, and Ashe's sonic\ncode-clicked in reply: \"At twilight.\"\n\nYes, dusk was the proper time for using a peep-probe. To see without\nrisk of being sighted in return was their safeguard. Here Ashe had no\nhistorical data to guide him. Their search for the former inhabitants\nmight be a long drawn-out process skipping across centuries as the\nmachine was adjusted to Terran time eras.\n\n\"When were they here?\" Back on shore Karara shook out her hair, spread\nit over her shoulders to dry. \"How many hundred years back will the\nprobe return?\"\n\n\"More likely thousands,\" Ross commented. \"Where will you start, Gordon?\"\n\nAshe brushed sand from the page of the notebook he had steadied against\none bent knee and gazed out at the reef where they had set the probe.\n\n\"Ten thousand years--\"\n\n\"Why?\" Karara wanted to know. \"Why that exact figure?\"\n\n\"We know that galactic ships crashed on Terra then. So their commerce\nand empire--if it was an empire--was far-flung at that time. Perhaps\nthey were at the zenith of their civilization; perhaps they were already\non the down slope. I do not think they were near the beginning. So that\ndate is as good a starting place as any. If we don't hit what we're\nafter, then we can move forward until we do.\"\n\n\"Do you think that there ever was a native population here?\"\n\n\"Might have been.\"\n\n\"But without any large land animals, no modern traces of any,\" she\nprotested.\n\n\"Of people?\" Ashe shrugged. \"Good answers for both. Suppose there was a\nworld-wide epidemic of proportions to wipe out a species. Or a war in\nwhich they used forces beyond our comprehension to alter the whole face\nof this planet, which did happen--the alteration, I mean. Several things\ncould have removed intelligent life. Then such species as the burrowers\ncould have developed or evolved from smaller, more primitive types.\"\n\n\"Those ape-things we found on the desert planet.\" Ross thought back to\ntheir first voyage on the homing derelict. \"Maybe they had once been men\nand were degenerating. And the winged people, they could have been less\nthan men on their way up----\"\n\n\"Ape-things ... winged people?\" Karara interrupted. \"Tell me!\"\n\nThere was something imperious in her demand, but Ross found himself\ndescribing in detail their past adventures, first on the world of sand\nand sealed structures where the derelict had rested for a purpose its\ninvoluntary passengers had never understood, and then of the Terrans'\nlimited exploration of that other planet which might have been the\ncapital world of a far-flung stellar empire. There they had made a pact\nwith a winged people living in the huge buildings of a jungle-choked\ncity.\n\n\"But you see\"--the Polynesian girl turned to Ashe when Ross had\nfinished--\"you did find them--these ape-things and the winged people.\nBut here there are only the dragons and the burrowers. Are they the\nstart or the finish? I want to know--\"\n\n\"Why?\" Ashe asked.\n\n\"Not just because I am curious, though I am that also, but because we,\ntoo, must have a beginning and an end. Did we come up from the seas,\nrise to know and feel and think, just to return to such beginning at our\nend? If your winged people were climbing and your ape-things\ndescending\"--she shook her head--\"it would be frightening to hold a cord\nof life, both ends in your hands. Is it good for us to see such things,\nGordon?\"\n\n\"Men have asked that question all their thinking lives, Karara. There\nhave been those who have said no, who have turned aside and tried to\nhalt the growth of knowledge here or there, attempted to make men stand\nstill on one tread of a stairway. Only there is that in us which will\nnot stop, ill-fitted as we may be for the climbing. Perhaps we shall be\nsafe and untroubled here on Hawaika if I do not go out to that reef\ntonight. By that action I may bring real danger down on all of us. Yet I\ncan not hold back for that. Could you?\"\n\n\"No, I do not believe that I could,\" she agreed.\n\n\"We are here because we are of those who must know--volunteers. And\nbeing of that temperament, it is in us always to take the next step.\"\n\n\"Even if it leads to a fall,\" she added in a low tone.\n\nAshe gazed at her, though her own eyes were on the sea where a lace of\nwaves marked the reef. Her words were ordinary enough, but Ross\nstraightened to match Ashe's stare. Why had he felt that odd instant of\nuneasiness as if his heart had fluttered instead of beating true?\n\n\"I know of you Time Agents,\" Karara continued. \"There were plenty of\nstories about you told while we were in training.\"\n\n\"Tall tales, I can imagine, most of them.\" Ashe laughed, but his\namusement sounded forced to Ross.\n\n\"Perhaps. Though I do not believe that many could be any taller than the\ntruth. And so also I have heard of that strict rule you follow, that you\nmust do nothing which might alter the course of history. But suppose,\nsuppose here that the course of history could be altered, that whatever\ncatastrophe occurred might be averted? If that was done, what would\nhappen to our settlement in the here and now?\"\n\n\"I don't know. That is an experiment which we have never dared to try,\nwhich we won't try--\"\n\n\"Not even if it would mean a chance of life for a whole native race?\"\nshe persisted.\n\n\"Alternate worlds then, maybe.\" Ross's imagination caught up that idea.\n\"Two worlds from a change point in history,\" he elaborated, noting her\nlook of puzzlement. \"One stemming from one decision, another from the\nalternate.\"\n\n\"I've heard of that! But, Gordon, if you could return to the time of\ndecision here and you had it in your power to say, 'Yes--live!' or\n'No--die!' to the alien natives, what would you do?\"\n\n\"I don't know. But neither do I think I shall ever be placed in that\nposition. Why do you ask?\"\n\nShe was twisting her still damp hair into a pony tail and tying it so\nwith a cord. \"Because ... because I feel.... No, I can not really put it\ninto words, Gordon. It is that feeling one has on the eve of some\nimportant event--anticipation, fear, excitement. You'll let me go with\nyou tonight, please! I want to see it--not the Hawaika that is, but that\nother world with another name, the one they saw and knew!\"\n\nAn instant protest was hot in Ross's throat, but he had no time to voice\nit. For Ashe was already nodding.\n\n\"All right. But we may have no luck at all. Fishing in time is a chancy\nthing, so don't be disappointed if we don't turn you up that other\nworld. Now, I'm going to pamper these old bones for an hour or two.\nAmuse yourselves, children.\" He lay back and closed his eyes.\n\nThe past two days had wiped half the shadows from his lean, tanned face.\nHe had dropped two years, three, Ross thought thankfully. Let them be\nlucky tonight, and Ashe's cure could be nearly complete.\n\n\"What do you think happened here?\" Karara had moved so that her back was\nnow to the wash of waves, her face more in the shadow.\n\n\"How do I know? Could be any of ten different things.\"\n\n\"And will I please shut up and leave you alone?\" she countered swiftly.\n\"Do you wish to savor the excitement then, explore a world upon world,\nor am I saying it right? We have Hawaika One which is a new world for\nus; now there is Hawaika Two which is removed in time, not distance. And\nto explore that--\"\n\n\"We won't be exploring it really,\" Ross protested.\n\n\"Why? Did your agents not spend days, weeks, even months of time in the\npast on Terra? What is to prevent your doing the same here?\"\n\n\"Training. We have no way of learning the drill.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Well, it wasn't as easy as you seem to think it was back on Terra,\" he\nbegan scornfully. \"We didn't just stroll through one of those gates and\nset up business, say, in Nero's Rome or Montezuma's Mexico. An Agent was\nphysically and psychologically fitted to the era he was to explore. Then\nhe trained, and how he trained!\" Ross remembered the weary hours spent\nlearning how to use a bronze sword, the technique of Beaker trading, the\nhypnotic instruction in a language which was already dead centuries\nbefore his own country existed. \"You learned the language, the customs,\neverything you could about your time and your cover. You were letter\nperfect before you took even a trial run!\"\n\n\"And here you would have no guides,\" Karara said, nodding. \"Yes, I can\nsee the difficulty. Then you will just use the peep-probe?\"\n\n\"Probably. Oh, maybe later on we can scout through a gate. We have the\nmaterial to set one up. But it would be a strictly limited project,\nallowing no chance of being caught. Maybe the big brains back home can\ntake peep-data and work out some basis of infiltration for us from it.\"\n\n\"But that would take years!\"\n\n\"I suppose so. Only you begin to swim in the shallows, don't you--not by\njumping off a cliff!\"\n\nShe laughed. \"True enough! However, even a look into the past might\nsolve part of the big mystery.\"\n\nRoss grunted and stretched out to follow Ashe's example. But behind his\nclosed eyes his brain was busy, and he did not cultivate the patience he\nneeded. Peep-probes were all right, but Karara had a point. You wanted\nmore than a small window into a mystery, you wanted a part in solving\nit.\n\nThe setting of the sun deepened rose to red, made a dripping wine-hued\nbanner of most of the sky, so that under it they moved in a crimson sea,\nlooked back at an island where shadows were embers instead of ashes.\nThree humans, two dolphins, and a machine mounted on a reef which might\nnot even have existed in the time they sought. Ashe made his final\nadjustments, and then his finger pressed a button and they watched the\nvista-plate no larger than the palms of two hands.\n\nNothing, a dull gray nothing! Something must have gone wrong with their\nassembly work. Ross touched Ashe's shoulder. But now there were shadows\ngathering on the plate, thickening, to sharpen into a distinct picture.\n\nIt was still the sunset hour they watched. But somehow the colors were\npaler, less red and sullen than the ones about them in the here and now.\nAnd they were not seeing the isle toward which the probe had been aimed;\nthey were looking at a rugged coastline where cliffs lifted well above\nthe beach-strand. While on those cliffs--! Ross had not realized Karara\nhad reached out to grasp his arm until her nails bit into his flesh. And\neven then he was hardly aware of the pain. Because there was a building\non the cliff!\n\nMassive walls of native rock reared in outward defenses, culminating in\ntowers. And from the high point of one tower the pointed tail of a\nbanner cracked in the wind. There was a headland of rock reaching out,\nnot toward them but to the north, and rounding that....\n\n\"War canoe!\" Karara exclaimed, but Ross had another identification:\n\n\"Longboat!\"\n\nIn reality, the vessel was neither one nor the other, not the double\ncanoe of the Pacific which had transported warriors on raid from one\nisland to another, or the shield-hung warship of the Vikings. But the\nTerrans were right in its purpose: That rakish, sharp-prowed ship had\nbeen fashioned for swift passage of the seas, for maneuverability as a\nweapon.\n\nBehind the first nosed another and a third. Their sails were dyed by the\nsun, but there were devices painted on them, and the lines of those\ndesigns glittered as if they had been drawn with a metallic fluid.\n\n\"The castle!\" Ashe's cry pulled their attention back to land.\n\nThere was movement along those walls. Then came a flash, a splash in the\nwater close enough to the lead ship to wet her deck with spray.\n\n\"They're fighting!\" Karara shouldered against Ross for a better look.\n\nThe ships were altering course, swinging away from land, out to sea.\n\n\"Moving too fast for sails alone, and I don't see any oars.\" Ross was\npuzzled. \"How do you suppose....\"\n\nThe bombardment from the castle continued but did not score any hits.\nAlready the ships were out of range, the lead vessel off the screen of\nthe peep as well. Then there was just the castle in the sunset. Ashe\nstraightened up.\n\n\"Rocks!\" he repeated wonderingly. \"They were throwing rocks!\"\n\n\"But those ships, they must have had engines. They weren't just\ndepending on sails when they retreated.\" Ross added his own cause for\nbewilderment.\n\nKarara looked from one to the other. \"There is something here you do not\nunderstand. What is wrong?\"\n\n\"Catapults, yes,\" Ashe said with a nod. \"Those would fit periods\ncorresponding from the Roman Empire into the Middle Ages. But you're\nright, Ross, those ships had power of some kind to take them offshore\nthat quickly.\"\n\n\"A technically advanced race coming up against a more backward one?\"\nhazarded the younger man.\n\n\"Could be. Let's go forward some.\" The incoming tide was washing well up\non the reef. Ashe had to don his mask as he plunged head and shoulders\nunder water to make the necessary adjustment.\n\nOnce more he pressed the button. And Ross's gasp was echoed by one from\nthe girl. The cliff again, but there was no castle dominating it, only a\nruin, hardly more than rubble. Now, above the sites of the saucer\ndepressions great pylons of silvery metal, warmed into fire brilliance\nby the sunset, raked into the sky like gaunt, skeleton fingers. There\nwere no ships, no signs of any life. Even the vegetation which had\nshowed on shore had vanished. There was an atmosphere of stark\nabandonment and death which struck the Terrans forcibly.\n\nThose pylons, Ross studied them. Something familiar in their\nconstruction teased his memory. That refuel planet where the derelict\nship had set down twice, on the voyage out and on their return. That had\nbeen a world of metal structures, and he believed he could trace a\nkinship between his memory of those and these pylons. Surely they had no\nconnection with the earlier castle on the cliff.\n\nOnce more Ashe ducked to reset the probe. And in the fast-fading light\nthey watched a third and last picture. But now they might have been\nlooking at the island of the present, save that it bore no vegetation\nand there was a rawness about it, a sharpness of rock outline now\nvanished.\n\nThose pylons, were they the key to the change which had come upon this\nworld? What were they? Who had set them there? For the last Ross thought\nhe had an answer. They were certainly the product of the galactic\nempire. And the castle ... the ships ... natives ... settlers? Two\nwidely different eras, and the mystery still, lay between them. Would\nthey ever be able to bring the key to it out of time?\n\nThey swam for the shore where Ui had a fire blazing and their supper\nprepared.\n\n\"How many years lying between those probes?\" Ross pulled broiled fish\napart with his fingers.\n\n\"That first was ten thousand years ago, the second,\" Ashe paused, \"only\ntwo hundred years later.\"\n\n\"But\"--Ross stared at his superior--\"that means----\"\n\n\"That there was a war or some drastic form of invasion, yes.\"\n\n\"You mean that the star people arrived and just took over this whole\nplanet?\" Karara asked. \"But why? And those pylons, what were they for?\nHow much later was that last picture?\"\n\n\"Five hundred years.\"\n\n\"The pylons were gone, too, then,\" Ross commented. \"But why--?\" he\nechoed Karara's question.\n\nAshe had taken up his notebook, but he did not open it. \"I think\"--there\nwas a sharp, grim note in his voice--\"we had better find out.\"\n\n\"Put up a gate?\"\n\nAshe broke all the previous rules of their service with his answer:\n\n\"Yes, a gate.\"\n\n\n\n\n4\n\nStorm Menace\n\n\n\"We have to know.\" Ashe leaned back against the crate they had just\nemptied. \"Something was done here--in two hundred years--and then, an\nempty world.\"\n\n\"Pandora's box.\" Ross drew a hand across his forehead, smearing sweat\nand fine sand into a brand.\n\nAshe nodded. \"Maybe we run that risk, loosing all the devils of the\naliens. But what if the Reds open the box first on one of their\nsettlement worlds?\"\n\nThere it was again, the old thorn which prodded them into risks and\nrecklessness. Danger ahead on both paths. Don't risk trying to learn\ngalactic secrets, but don't risk your enemy's learning them either. You\nheld a white-hot iron in both hands in this business. And Ashe was\nright, they had stumbled on something here which hinted that a whole\nworld had been altered to suit some plan. Suppose the secret of that\nalteration was discovered by their enemies?\n\n\"Were the ship and castle people natives?\" Ross wondered aloud.\n\n\"Just at a guess they were, or at least settlers who had been\nestablished here so long they had developed a local form of civilization\nwhich was about on the level of a feudal society.\"\n\n\"You mean because of the castle and the rock bombardment. But what about\nthe ships?\"\n\n\"Two separate phases of a society at war, perhaps a more progressive\nagainst a less technically advanced. American warships paying a visit to\nthe Shogun's Japan, for example.\"\n\nRoss grinned. \"Those warships didn't seem to fancy their welcome. They\nsteered out to sea fast enough when the rocks began to fall.\"\n\n\"Yes, but the ships could exist in the castle pattern; the pylons could\nnot!\"\n\n\"Which period are you aiming for first--the castle or the pylons?\"\n\n\"Castle first, I think. Then if we can't pick up any hints, we'll take\nsome jumps forward until we do connect. Only we'll be under severe\nhandicaps. If we could only plant an analyzer somewhere in the castle as\na beginning.\"\n\nRoss did not show his surprise. If Ashe was talking on those terms, then\nhe was intending to do more than just lurk around a little beyond the\ngate; he was really planning to pick up alien speech patterns,\neventually assume an alien agent identity!\n\n\"Gordon!\" Karara appeared between two of the lace trees. She came so\nhastily that the contents of the two cups she carried slopped over. \"You\nmust hear what Hori has to say--\"\n\nThe tall Samoan who trailed her spoke quickly. For the first time since\nRoss had known him he was very serious, a frown line between his eyes.\n\"There is a bad storm coming. Our instruments register it.\"\n\n\"How long away?\" Ashe was on his feet.\n\n\"A day ... maybe two....\"\n\nRoss could see no change in the sky, islands, or sea. They had had\nidyllic weather for the six weeks since their planeting, no sign of any\nsuch trouble in the Hawaikan paradise.\n\n\"It's coming,\" Hori repeated.\n\n\"The gate is half up,\" Ashe thought aloud, \"too much of it set to be\ndismantled again in a hurry.\"\n\n\"If it's completed,\" Hori wanted to know, \"would it ride out a storm?\"\n\n\"It might, behind that reef where we have it based. To finish it would\nbe a fast job.\"\n\nHori flexed his hands. \"We're more brawn than brain in these matters,\nGordon, but you've all our help, for what it's worth. What about the\nship, does it lift on schedule?\"\n\n\"Check with Rimbault about that. This storm, how will it compare to a\nPacific typhoon?\"\n\nThe Samoan shook his head. \"How do we know? We have not yet had to face\nthe local variety.\"\n\n\"The islands are low,\" Karara commented. \"Winds and water could--\"\n\n\"Yes! We'd better see Rimbault about a shelter if needed.\"\n\nIf the settlement had drowsed, now its inhabitants were busy. It was\ndecided that they could shelter in the spaceship should the storm reach\nhurricane proportions, but before its coming the gate must be finished.\nThe final fitting was left to Ashe and Ross, and the older agent\nfastened the last bolt when the waters beyond the reef were already wind\nruffled, the sky darkening fast. The dolphins swam back and forth in the\nlagoon and with them Karara, though Ashe had twice waved her to the\nshore.\n\nThere was no sunlight left, and they worked with torches. Ashe began his\ninspection of the relatively simple transfer--the two upright bars, the\nslab of opaque material forming a doorstep between them. This was only a\nskeleton of the gates Ross had used in the past. But continual\nexperimentation had produced this more easily transported installation.\n\nPiled in a net were several supply containers ready for an exploring\nrun--extra gill-packs, the analyzer, emergency rations, a medical kit,\nall the basics. Was Ashe going to try now? He had activated the\ntransfer, the rods were glowing faintly, the slab they guarded having an\neerie blue glimmer. He probably only wanted to be sure it worked.\n\nWhat happened at that moment Ross could never find any adequate words to\ndescribe, nor was he sure he could remember. The disorientation of the\npass-through he had experienced before; this time he was whirled into a\nvortex of feeling in which his body, his identity, were rift from him\nand he lost touch with all stability.\n\nInstinctively he lashed out, his reflexes more than his conscious will\nkeeping him above water in the wild rage of a storm-whipped sea. The\nlight was gone; here was only dark and beating water. Then a lightning\nflash ripped wide the heavens over Ross as his head broke the surface\nand he saw, with unbelieving eyes, that he was being thrust\nshoreward--not to the strand of Finger Island--but against a cliff where\nwater pounded an unyielding wall of rock.\n\nRoss comprehended that somehow he had been jerked through the gate, that\nhe was now fronting the land that had been somewhere beneath the heights\nsupporting the castle. Then he fought for his life to escape the hammer\nof the sea determined to crack him against the surface of the cliff.\n\nA rough surface loomed up before him, and he threw himself in that\ndirection, embracing a rock, striving to cling through the backwash of\nthe wave which had brought him there. His nails grated and broke on the\nstone, and then the fingers of his right hand caught in a hole, and he\nheld with all the strength in his gasping, beaten body. He had had no\npreparation, no warning, and only the tough survival will which had been\ntrained and bred into him saved his life.\n\nAs the water washed back, Ross strove to pull up farther on his\nanchorage, to be above the strike of the next wave. Somehow he gained a\nfoot before it came. The mask of the gill-pack saved him from being\nsmothered in that curling torrent as he clung stubbornly, resisting\nagain the pull of the retreating sea.\n\nInch by inch between waves he fought for footing and stable support.\nThen he was on the surface of the rock, out of all but the lash of\nspray. He crouched there, spent and gasping. The thunder roar of the\nsurf, and beyond it the deeper mutter of the rage in the heavens, was\ndeafening, dulling his sense as much as the ordeal through which he had\npassed. He was content to cling where he was, hardly conscious of his\nsurroundings.\n\nSparks of light along the shore to the north at last caught Ross's\nattention. They moved, some clustering along the wave line, a few strung\nup the cliff. And they were not part of the storm's fireworks. Men\nhere--why at this moment?\n\nAnother bolt of lightning showed him the answer. On the reef fringe\nwhich ran a tongue of land into the sea hung a ship--two ships--pounded\nby every hammer wave. Shipwrecks ... and those lights must mark castle\ndwellers drawn to aid the survivors.\n\nRoss crawled across his rock on his hands and knees, wavered along the\ncliff wall until he was again faced with angry water. To drop into that\nwould be a mistake. He hesitated--and now more than his own predicament\nstruck home to him.\n\nAshe! Ashe had been ahead of him at the time gate. If Ross had been\njerked through to this past, then somewhere in the water, on the shore,\nGordon was here too! But where to find him....\n\nSetting his back to the cliff and holding to the rough stone, Ross got\nto his feet, trying to see through the welter of foam and water. Not\nonly the sea poured here; now a torrential rain fell into the bargain,\nstreaming down about him, battering his head and shoulders. A chill rain\nwhich made him shiver.\n\nHe wore gill-pack, weighted belt with its sheathed tool and knife,\nflippers, and the pair of swimming trunks which had been suitable for\nthe Hawaika he knew; but this was a different world altogether. Dare he\nuse his torch to see the way out of here? Ross watched the lights to the\nnorth, deciding they were not too unlike his own beam, and took the\nchance.\n\nNow he stood on a shelf of rock pitted with depressions, all pools. To\nhis left was a drop into a boiling, whirling caldron from which points\nof stone fanged. Ross shuddered. At least he had escaped being pulled\ninto that!\n\nTo his right, northward, there was another space of sea, a narrow strip,\nand then a second ledge. He measured the distance between that and the\none on which he perched. Staying where he was would not locate Ashe.\n\nRoss stripped off his flippers, made them fast in his belt. Then he\nleaped and landed painfully, as his feet slipped and he skidded face\ndown on the northern ledge.\n\nAs he sat up, rubbing a bruised and scraped knee, he saw lights\nadvancing in his direction. And between them a shadow crawling from\nwater to shore. Ross stumbled along the ledge hastening to reach that\nfigure, who lay still now just out of the waves. Ashe?\n\nRoss's limping pace became a trot. But he was too late; the other\nlights, two of them, had reached the shadow. A man--or at least a body\nwhich was humanoid--sprawled face down. Other men, three of them,\ngathered over the exhausted swimmer.\n\nThose who held the torches were still partially in the dark, but the\nthird stooped to roll over their find. Ross caught the glint of light on\na metallic headcovering, the glisten of wet armor of some type on the\nfellow's back and shoulders as he made quick examination of the sea's\nvictim.\n\nThen.... Ross halted, his eyes wide. A hand rose and fell with expert\nprecision. There had been a blade in that hand. Already the three were\nturning away from the man so ruthlessly dispatched. Ashe? Or some\nsurvivor of the wrecked ships?\n\nRoss retreated to the end of the ledge. The narrow stream of water\ndividing it from the rock where he had won ashore washed into a cave in\nthe cliff. Dare he try to work his way into that? Masked, with the\ngill-pack, he could go under surface if he were not smashed by the waves\nagainst some wall.\n\nHe glanced back. The lights were very close to the end of his ledge. To\nwithdraw to the second rock would mean being caught in a dead end, for\nhe dared not enter the whirlpool on its far side. There was really no\nchoice: stay and be killed, or try for the cave. Ross fastened on his\nflippers and lowered his body into the narrow stream. The fact that it\nwas narrow and guarded on either side by the ledges tamed the waves a\nlittle, and Ross found the tug against him not so great as he feared it\nwould be.\n\nKeeping hand-holds on the rock, he worked along, head and shoulders\noften under the wash of rolling water, but winning steadily to the break\nin the cliff wall. Then he was through, into a space much larger than\nthe opening, water-filled but not with a wild turbulence of waves.\n\nHad he been sighted? Ross kept a handhold to the left of that narrow\nentrance, his body floating with the rise and fall of the water. He\ncould make out the gleam of light without. It might be that one of those\nhunters had leaned out over the runnel of the cave entrance, was\nflashing his torch down into the water there.\n\nBehind mask plate Ross's lips writhed in the snarl of the hunted. In\nhere he would have the advantage. Let one of them, or all three, try to\nfollow through that rock entrance and....\n\nBut if he had been sighted at the mouth of the lair, none of his\ntrackers appeared to wish to press the hunt. The light disappeared, and\nRoss was left in the dark. He counted a hundred slowly and then a second\nhundred before he dared use his own torch.\n\nFor all its slit entrance this was a good-sized hideaway he had chanced\nupon. And he discovered, when he ventured to release his wall hold and\nswim out into its middle, the bottom arose in a slope toward its rear.\n\nMoments later Ross pulled out of the water once more, to crouch\nshivering on a ledge only lapped now and then by wavelets. He had found\na temporary refuge, but his good fortune did not quiet his fears. Had\nthat been Ashe on the shore? And why had the swimmer been so summarily\nexecuted by the men who found him?\n\nThe ships caught on the reef, the castle on the cliff above his\nhead ... enemies ... ships' crews and castle men? But the callous act\nof the shore patrol argued a state of war carried to fanatic proportions,\nperhaps inter-racial conflict.\n\nHe could not hope to explore until the storm was over. To plunge back\ninto the sea would not find Ashe. And to be hunted along the shore by an\nunknown enemy was simply asking to die without achieving any good in\nreturn. No, he must remain where he was for the present.\n\nRoss unhooked the torch from his belt and used it on this higher portion\nof the cave. He was perched on a ledge which protruded into the water in\nthe form of a wedge. At his back the wall of the cave was rough, and\ntrails of weed were festooned on its projections. The smell of fishy\ndecay was strong enough to register as Ross pulled off his mask. As far\nas he could now see there was no exit except by sea.\n\nA movement in the water brought his light flashing down into the dark\nflood. Then a sleek head arose in the path of that ray. Not a man\nswimming, but one of the dolphins!\n\nRoss's exclamation of surprise was half gasp, half cry. The second\ndolphin showed for a moment and between the shadow of their bodies, just\nunder the surface, moved a third form.\n\n\"Ashe!\" Ross had no idea how the dolphins had come through the time\ngate, but that they had guided to safety a Terran he did not doubt at\nall. \"Ashe!\"\n\nBut it was not Ashe who came wading to the ledge where Ross waited with\nhand outstretched. He had been so sure of the other's identity that he\nblinked in complete bewilderment as his eyes met Karara's and she half\nstumbled, half reeled against him.\n\nHis arms about her shoulders steadied her, and her shivering body was\nclose to his as she leaned her full weight upon him. Her hands made a\nfeeble movement to her mask, and he pulled it off. Uncovered, her face\nwas pale and drawn, her eyes now closed, and her breath came in ragged,\ntearing sobs which shook her even more.\n\n\"How did you get here?\" Ross demanded even as he pushed her down on the\nledge.\n\nHer head moved slowly, in a weak gesture of negation.\n\n\"I don't know ... we were close to the gate. There was a flash of\nlight ... then--\" Her voice sealed up with a note of hysteria in it.\n\"Then ... I was here ... and Taua with me. Tino-rau came ... Ross,\nRoss ... there was a man swimming. He got ashore; he was getting to his\nfeet and--and they killed him!\"\n\nRoss's hold tightened; he stared into her face with fierce demand.\n\n\"Was it Gordon?\"\n\nShe blinked, brought her hand up to her mouth, and wiped it back and\nforth across her chin. There was a small red trickle growing between her\nfingers, dripping down her arm.\n\n\"Gordon?\" She repeated it as if she had never heard the name before.\n\n\"Yes, did they kill Gordon?\"\n\nIn his grasp she was swaying back and forth. Then, realizing he was\nshaking her, Ross got himself under control.\n\nBut a measure of understanding had come into her eyes. \"No, not Gordon.\nWhere is Gordon?\"\n\n\"You haven't seen him?\" Ross persisted, knowing it was useless.\n\n\"Not since we were at the gate.\" Her words were less slurred. \"Weren't\nyou with him?\"\n\n\"No. I was alone.\"\n\n\"Ross, where are we?\"\n\n\"Better say--when are we,\" he replied. \"We're through the gate and back\nin time. And we have to find Gordon!\" He did not want to think of what\nmight have happened out on the shore.\n\n\n\n\n5\n\nTime Wrecked\n\n\n\"Can we go back?\" Karara was herself again, her voice crisp.\n\n\"I don't know.\" Ross gave her the truth. The force which had drawn them\nthrough the gate was beyond his experience. As far as he knew, there had\nnever been such an involuntary passage by time gate, and what their trip\nmight mean he did not know.\n\nThe main concern was that Ashe must have come through, too, and that he\nwas missing. Just let the storm abate, and, with the dolphins' aid,\nRoss's chance for finding the missing agent was immeasurably better. He\nsaid so now, and Karara nodded.\n\n\"Do you suppose there is a war going on here?\" She hugged her arms\nacross her breast, her shoulders heaving in the torch light with\nshudders she could not control. The damp chill was biting, and Ross\nrealized that was also danger.\n\n\"Could be.\" He got to his feet, switched the light from the girl to the\nwalls. That seaweed, could it make them some form of protective\ncovering?\n\n\"Hold this--aim it there!\" He thrust the torch into her hands and went\nfor one of the loops of kelp.\n\nRoss reeled in lines of the stuff. It was rank-smelling but only\nslightly damp, and he piled it on the ledge in a kind of nest. At least\nin the hollow of that mound they would be sheltered after a fashion.\n\nKarara crawled into the center of the mass, and Ross followed her. The\nsmell of the stuff filled his nose, was almost like a visible cloud, but\nhe had been right, the girl stopped shivering, and he felt a measure of\nwarmth in his own shaking body. Ross snapped off the torch, and they lay\ntogether in the dark, the half-rotten pile of weed holding them.\n\nHe must have slept, Ross guessed, when he stirred, raising his head. His\nbody was stiff, aching, as he braced himself up on his hands and peered\nover the edge of their kelp nest. There was light in the cave, a pale\ngrayish wash which grew stronger toward the slit opening. It must be\nday. And that meant they could move.\n\nRoss groped in the weed, his hand falling on a curve of shoulder.\n\n\"Wake up!\" His voice was hoarse and held the snap of an order.\n\nThere was a startled gasp in answer, and the mound beside him heaved as\nthe girl stirred.\n\n\"Day out--\" Ross pointed.\n\n\"And the storm--\" she stood up, \"I think it is over.\"\n\nIt was true that the level of water within the cave had fallen, that\nwavelets no longer lapped with the same vigor. Morning ... the storm\nover ... and somewhere Ashe!\n\nRoss was about to snap his mask into place when Karara caught at his\narm.\n\n\"Be careful! Remember what I saw--last night they were killing\nswimmers!\"\n\nHe shook her off impatiently. \"I'm no fool! And with the packs on we do\nnot have to surface. Listen--\" he had another thought, one which would\nprovide an excellent excuse for keeping her safely out of his company,\nreducing his responsibility for her, \"you take the dolphins and try to\nfind the gate. We'll want out as soon as I locate Ashe.\"\n\n\"And if you do not find him soon?\"\n\nRoss hesitated. She had not said the rest. What if he could not find\nGordon at all? But he would--he had to!\n\n\"I'll be back here\"--he checked his watch, no longer an accurate\ntimekeeper, for Hawaikan days held an hour more than the Terran\ntwenty-four, but the settlers kept the off-world measurement to check on\nwork periods--\"in, say, two hours. You should know by then about the\ngate, and I'll have some idea of the situation along the shore. But\nlisten--\" Ross caught her shoulders in a taut grip, pulled her around to\nface him, his eyes hot and almost angry as they held hers, \"don't let\nyourself be seen--\" He repeated the cardinal rule of Agents in new\nterritory. \"We don't dare risk discovery.\"\n\nKarara nodded and he could see that she understood, was aware of the\nimportance of that warning. \"Do you want Tino-rau or Taua?\"\n\n\"No, I'm going to search along the shore first. Ashe would have tried\nfor that last night ... was probably driven in the way we were. He'd go\nto ground somewhere. And I have this--\" Ross touched the sonic on his\nbelt. \"I'll set it on his call; you do the same with yours. Then if we\nget within distance, he'll pick us up. Back here in two hours--\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Karara kicked free of the weed, was already wading down to where\nthe dolphins circled in the cave pool waiting for her. Ross followed,\nand the four swam for the open sea.\n\nIt could not be much after dawn, Ross thought, as he clung by one hand\nto a rock and watched Karara and the dolphins on their way. Then he\npaddled along the shore northward for his own survey of the coast. There\nwas a rose cast in the sky, warming the silver along the far reaches of\nthe horizon. And about him bobbed storm flotsam, so that he had to pick\na careful way through floating debris.\n\nOn the reef one of the wrecked ships had vanished entirely. Perhaps it\nhad been battered to death by the waves, ground to splinters against the\nrocks. The other still held, its prow well out of the now receding\nwaves, jagged holes in its sides through which spurts of water cascaded\nnow and then.\n\nThe wreck which had been driven landward was composed of planks, boxes,\nand containers rolled by the waves' force. Much of this was already free\nof the sea, and on the beach figures moved examining it. In spite of the\ndanger of chance discovery, Ross edged along rocks, seeking a vantage\npoint from which he could watch that activity.\n\nHe was flat against a sea-girt boulder, a swell of floating weed draped\nabout him, when the nearest of the foraging parties moved into good\nview.\n\nMen ... at least they had the outward appearance of men much like\nhimself, though their skin was dark and their limbs appeared\ndisproportionately long and thin. There were two groups of them, four\nwearing only a scanty loincloth, busy turning over and hunting through\nthe debris under the direction of the other two.\n\nThe workers had thick growths of hair which not only covered their\nheads, but down their spines and the outer sides of their thin arms and\nlegs to elbow and knee. The hair was a pallid yellow-white in vivid\ncontrast to their dark skins, and their chins protruded sharply,\nallowing the lower line of their faces to take on a vaguely disturbing\nlikeness to an animal's muzzle.\n\nTheir overseers were more fully clothed, wearing not only helmets on\ntheir heads, whose helms had a protective visor over the face, but also\nbreast- and back-plates molded to their bodies. Ross thought that these\ncould not be solid metal since they adapted to the movements of the\nwearers.\n\nFeet and legs were covered with casing combinations of shoe and\nleggings, colored dull red. They were armed with swords of an odd\npattern; their points curved up so that the blade resembled a fishhook.\nUnsheathed, the blades were clipped to a waist belt by catches which\nglittered in the weak morning light as if gem set.\n\nRoss could see little of their faces, for the beak visors overhung their\nfeatures. But their skins were as dusky as those of the laborers, and\ntheir arms and legs of the same unusual length ... men of the same race,\nhe deduced.\n\nUnder the orders of the armed overseers the laborers were reducing the\nbeach to order, sorting out the flotsam into two piles. Once they\ngathered about a find, and the sound of excited speech reached Ross as\nan agitated clicking. The armored men came up, surveyed the discovery.\nOne of them shrugged, and clicked an order.\n\nRoss caught only a half glimpse of the thing two of the workers dragged\naway. A body! Ashe.... The Terran was about to move closer when he saw\nthe green cloak dragging about the corpse. No, not Gordon, just another\nvictim from the wrecks.\n\nThe aliens were working their way toward Ross, and perhaps it was time\nfor him to go. He was pushing aside his well-arranged curtain of weed\nwhen he was startled by a shout. For a second he thought he might have\nbeen sighted, until resulting action on shore told him otherwise.\n\nThe furred workers shrank back against the mound to which they had just\ndragged the body. While the two guards took up a position before them,\ncurved swords, snapped from their belt hooks, ready in their hands.\nAgain that shout. Was it a warning or a threat? With the language\nbarrier Ross could only wait to see.\n\nAnother party approached along the beach from the south. In the lead was\na cloaked and hooded figure, so muffled in its covering of silver-gray\nthat Ross had no idea of the form beneath. Silvery-gray--no, now that\nhue was deepening with blue tones, darkening rapidly. By the time the\ncloaked newcomer had passed the rock which sheltered the Terran the\ncovering was a rich blue which seemed to glow.\n\nBehind the leader were a dozen armed men. They wore the same beaked\nhelmets, the supple encasing breast- and back-plates, but their leggings\nwere gray. They, too, carried curved swords, but the weapons were still\nlatched to their belts and they made no move to draw them in spite of\nthe very patent hostility of the guards before them.\n\nBlue cloak halted some three feet from the guards. The sea wind pulled\nat the cloak, wrapping it about the body beneath. But even so, the\nwearer remained well hidden. From under a flapping edge came a hand. The\nfingers, long and slender, were curled about an ivory-colored wand which\nended in a knob. Sparks flashed from it in a continuous flickering.\n\nRoss clapped his hand to his belt. To his complete amazement the sonic\ndisk he wore was reacting to those flashes, pricking sharply in perfect\nbeat to their blink-blink. The Terran cupped his scarred fingers over\nthe disk as he waited to see what was going to happen, wondering if the\nholder of that wand might, in return, pick up the broadcast of the code\nset on Ashe's call.\n\nThe hand clasping the wand was not dusky-skinned but had much of the\nsame ivory shade as the rod, so that to Ross the meeting between flesh\nand wand was hardly distinguishable. Now by one firm thrust the hand\nplanted the rod into the sand, leaving it to stand sentinel between the\ntwo parties.\n\nRetreating a step or two, the red-clad guards gave ground. But they did\nnot reclasp their swords. Their attitude, Ross judged, was that of men\nin some awe of their opponent, but men urged to defiance, either by a\nbelief in the righteousness of their cause, or strengthened by an old\nhatred.\n\nNow the cloaked one began to speak--or was that speech? Certainly the\nflow of sound had little in common with the clicking tongue Ross had\ncaught earlier. This trill of notes possessed the rise and fall of a\nchant or song which could have been a formula of greeting--or a warning.\nAnd the lines of warriors escorting the chanter stood to attention,\ntheir weapons still undrawn.\n\nRoss caught his lower lip between his teeth and bit down on it. That\nchanting--it crawled into the mind, set up a pattern! He shook his head\nvigorously and then was shocked by that recklessness. Not that any of\nthose on shore had glanced in his direction.\n\nThe chant ended on a high, broken note. It was followed by a moment of\nsilence through which sounded only the wind and the beat of wave.\n\nThen one of the laborers flung up his head and clicked a word or two. He\nand his fellows fell face down on the beach, cupping their hands to pour\nsand over their unkempt heads. One of the guards turned with a sharp\nyell to boot the nearest of the workers in the ribs.\n\nBut his companion cried out. The wand which had stood so erect when it\nwas first planted, now inclined toward the working party, its sparks\nshooting so swiftly and with such slight break between that they were\nfast making a single beam. Ross jerked his hand from contact with the\nsonic; a distinct throb of pain answered that stepping up of the\nmysterious broadcast.\n\nThe laborers broke and ran, or rather crawled on their bellies until\nthey were well away, before they got to their feet and pelted back down\nthe strand. However, the guards were of sterner stuff. They were\nwithdrawing all right, but slowly backing away, their swords held up\nbefore them as men might retreat before insurmountable odds.\n\nWhen they were well gone the robed one took up the wand. Holding it out\nbeyond, the cloaked leader of the second party approached the two piles\nof salvage the workers had heaped into rough order. There was a detailed\ninspection of both until the robed one came upon the body.\n\nAt a trilled order two of the warriors came up and laid out the corpse.\nWhen the robed one nodded they stood well back. The rod moved, the tip\nrather than the knobbed head being pointed at the body.\n\nRoss's head snapped back. That bolt of light, energy, fire--whatever it\nwas--issuing from the rod had dazzled him into momentary blindness. And\na vibration of force through the air was like a blow.\n\nWhen he was able to see once more there was nothing at all on the sand\nwhere the corpse had lain, nothing except a glassy trough from which\nsome spirals of vapor arose. Ross clung to his rock support badly\nshaken.\n\nMen with swords ... and now this--some form of controlled energy which\nargued of technical development and science. Just as the cliff castle\nhad bombarded with rocks ships sailing with a speed which argued engine\npower of an unknown type. A mixture of barbaric and advanced knowledge.\nTo assess this, he needed more experience, more knowledge than he\npossessed. Now Ashe could....\n\nAshe!\n\nRoss was jerked back to his own quest. The rod was quiet, no more sparks\nwere flung from its knob. And under Ross's touch his sonic was quiet\nalso. He snapped off the broadcast. If that device had picked up the\nflickering of the rod, the reverse could well be true.\n\nThe cloaked one chose from the pile of goods, and its escort gathered up\nthe designated boxes, a small cask or two. So laden, the party returned\nsouth the way they had come. Ross allowed his breath to expel in a sigh\nof relief.\n\nHe worked his way farther north along the coast, watching other parties\nof the furred workers and their guards. Lines of the former climbed the\ncliff, hauling their spoil, their destination the castle. But Ross saw\nno sign of Ashe, received no answer to the sonic code he had reset once\nthe strangers were out of distance. And the Terran began to realize that\nhis present search might well be fruitless, though he fought against\naccepting it.\n\nWhen he turned back to the slit cave Ross's fear was ready to be\nexpressed in anger, the anger of frustration over his own helplessness.\nWith no chance of trying to penetrate the castle, he could not learn\nwhether or not Ashe had been taken prisoner. And until the workers left\nthe beach he could not prowl there hunting the grimmer evidence his mind\nflinched from considering.\n\nKarara waited for him on the inner ledge. There was no sign of the\ndolphins and as Ross pulled out of the water, pushing aside his mask,\nher face in the thin light of the cave was deeply troubled.\n\n\"You did not find him,\" she made that a statement rather than a\nquestion.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"And I did not find it--\"\n\nRoss used a length of weed from the nest as a towel. But now he stood\nvery still.\n\n\"The gate ... no sign of it?\"\n\n\"Just this--\" She reached behind her and brought up a sealed container.\nRoss recognized one of the supply cans they had had in the cache by the\ngate. \"There are others ... scattered. Taua and Tino-rau seek them now.\nIt is as if all that was on the other side was sucked through with us.\"\n\n\"You are sure you found the right place?\"\n\n\"Is--is this not part of it?\" Again the girl sought for something on the\nledge. What she held out to him was a length of metal rod, twisted and\nbroken at one end as if a giant hand had wrenched it loose from the\ninstallation.\n\nRoss nodded dully. \"Yes,\" his voice was harsh as if the words were\npulled out of him against his will and against all hope--\"that's part of\na side bar. It--it must have been totally wrecked.\"\n\nYet, even though he held that broken length in his hands, Ross could not\nreally believe the gate was gone. He swam out once more, heading for the\nreef where the dolphins joined him as guides. There was a second piece\nof broken tube, the scattered containers of supplies, that was all. The\nTerrans were wrecked in time as surely as those ships had been wrecked\non the sea reef the night before!\n\nRoss headed once again for the cave. Their immediate needs were of major\nimportance now. The containers must be all gathered and taken into their\nhiding place, because upon their contents three human lives could\ndepend.\n\nHe paused just at the entrance to adjust the net of containers he\ntransported. And it was that slight chance which brought him knowledge\nof the intruder.\n\nOn the ledge Karara was heaping up the kelp of the nest. But to one side\nand on a level with the girl's head....\n\nRoss dared not flash his torch, thus betraying his presence. Leaving the\nnet hitched to the rock by its sling, he swam under water along the side\nof the cave by a route which should bring him out within striking\ndistance of that hunched figure perching above to watch Karara's every\nmove.\n\n\n\n\n6\n\nLoketh the Useless\n\n\nThe wash of waves covered Ross's advance until he came up against the\nwall not too far from the spy's perch. Whoever crouched there still\nleaned forward to watch Karara. And Ross's eyes, having adjusted to the\ngloom of the cavern, made out the outline of head and shoulders. The\nnext two or three minutes were the critical ones for the Terran. He must\nemerge on the ledge in the open before he could attack.\n\nKarara might almost have read his mind and given conscious help. For now\nshe went out on the point of the ledge to whistle the dolphins' summons.\nTino-rau's sleek head bobbed above water as he answered the girl with a\nbubbling squeak. Karara knelt and the dolphin came to butt against her\nout-held hand.\n\nRoss heard a gasp from the watcher, a faint sound of movement. Karara\nbegan to sing softly, her voice rippling in one of the liquid chants of\nher own people, the dolphin interjecting a note or two. Ross had heard\nthem at that before, and it made perfect cover for his move. He sprang.\n\nHis grasp tightened on flesh, fingers closed about thin wrists. There\nwas a yell of astonishment and fear from the stranger as the Terran\njerked him from his perch to the ledge. Ross had his opponent flattened\nunder him before he realized that the other had offered no struggle, but\nlay still.\n\n\"What is it?\" Karara's torch beam caught them both. Ross looked down\ninto a thin brown face not too different from his own. The wide-set eyes\nwere closed, and the mouth gaped open. Though he believed the Hawaikan\nunconscious, Ross still kept hold on those wrists as he moved from the\nsprawled body. With the girl's aid he used a length of kelp to secure\nthe captive.\n\nThe stranger wore a garment of glistening skintight material which\ncovered body, legs, and feet, but left his lanky arms bare. A belt about\nhis waist had loops for a number of objects, among them a hook-pointed\nknife which Ross prudently removed.\n\n\"Why, he is only a boy,\" Karara said. \"Where did he come from, Ross?\"\n\nThe Terran pointed to the wall crevice. \"He was up there, watching you.\"\n\nHer eyes were wide and round. \"Why?\"\n\nRoss dragged his prisoner back against the wall of the cave. After\nwitnessing the fate of those who had swum ashore from the wreck, he did\nnot like to think what motive might have brought the Hawaikan here.\nAgain Karara's thoughts must have matched his, for she added:\n\n\"But he did not even draw his knife. What are you going to do with him,\nRoss?\"\n\nThat problem already occupied the Terran. The wisest move undoubtedly\nwas to kill the native out of hand. But such ruthlessness was more than\nhe could stomach. And if he could learn anything from the stranger--gain\nsome knowledge of this new world and its ways--he would be twice winner.\nWhy, this encounter might even lead to Ashe!\n\n\"Ross ... his leg. See?\" The girl pointed.\n\nThe tight fit of the alien's clothing made the defect clear; the right\nleg of the stranger was shrunken and twisted. He was a cripple.\n\n\"What of it?\" Ross demanded sharply. This was no time for an appeal to\nthe sympathies.\n\nBut Karara did not urge any modification of the bonds as he half feared\nshe would. Instead, she sat back cross-legged, an odd, withdrawn\nexpression making her seem remote though he could have put out his hand\nto touch her.\n\n\"His lameness--it could be a bridge,\" she observed, to Ross's\nmystification.\n\n\"A bridge--what do you mean?\"\n\nThe girl shook her head. \"This is only a feeling, not a true thought.\nBut also it is important. Look, I think he is waking.\"\n\nThe lids above those large eyes were fluttering. Then with a shake of\nthe head, the Hawaikan blinked up at them. Blank bewilderment was all\nRoss could read in the stranger's expression until the alien saw Karara.\nThen a flood of clicking speech poured from his lips.\n\nHe seemed utterly astounded when they made no answer. And the fluency of\nhis first outburst took on a pleading note, while the expectancy of his\nfirst greeting faded away.\n\nKarara spoke to Ross. \"He is becoming afraid, very much afraid. At\nfirst, I think, he was pleased ... happy.\"\n\n\"But why?\"\n\nThe girl shook her head. \"I do not know; I can only feel. Wait!\" Her\nhand rose in imperious command. She did not rise to her feet, but\ncrawled on hands and knees to the edge of the ledge. Both dolphins were\nthere, raising their heads well out of the water, their actions\nexpressing unusual excitement.\n\n\"Ross!\" Karara's voice rang loudly. \"Ross, they can understand him!\nTino-rau and Taua can understand him!\"\n\n\"You mean, they understand this language?\" Ross found that fantastic,\nawesome as the abilities of the dolphins were.\n\n\"No, his mind. It's his mind, Ross. Somehow he thinks in patterns they\ncan pick up and read! They do that, you know, with a few of us, but not\nin the same way. This is more direct, clearer! They're so excited!\"\n\nRoss glanced at the prisoner. The alien had wriggled about, striving to\nraise his head against the wall as a support. His captor pulled the\nHawaikan into a sitting position, but the native accepted that aid\nalmost as if he were not even aware of Ross's hands on his body. He\nstared with a kind of horrified disbelief at the bobbing dolphin heads.\n\n\"He is afraid,\" Karara reported. \"He has never known such communication\nbefore.\"\n\n\"Can they ask him questions?\" demanded Ross. If this odd mental tie\nbetween Terran dolphin and Hawaikan did exist, then there was a chance\nto learn about this world.\n\n\"They can try. Now he only knows fear, and they must break through\nthat.\"\n\nWhat followed was the most unusual four-sided conversation Ross could\nhave ever imagined. He put a question to Karara, who relayed it to the\ndolphins. In turn, they asked it mentally of the Hawaikan and conveyed\nhis answer back via the same route.\n\nIt took some time to allay the fears of the stranger. But at last the\nHawaikan entered wholeheartedly into the exchange.\n\n\"He is the son of the lord ruling the castle above.\" Karara produced the\nfirst rational and complete answer. \"But for some reason he is not\naccepted by his own kind. Perhaps,\" she added on her own, \"it is because\nhe is crippled. The sea is his home, as he expresses it, and he believes\nme to be some mythical being out of it. He saw me swimming, masked, and\nwith the dolphins, and he is sure I change shape at will.\"\n\nShe hesitated. \"Ross, I get something odd here. He does know, or thinks\nhe knows, creatures who can appear and disappear at will. And he is\nafraid of their powers.\"\n\n\"Gods and goddesses--perfectly natural.\"\n\nKarara shook her head. \"No, this is more concrete than a religious\nbelief.\"\n\nRoss had a sudden inspiration. Hurriedly he described the cloaked figure\nwho had driven the castle people from the piles of salvage. \"Ask him\nabout that one.\"\n\nShe relayed the question. Ross saw the prisoner's head jerk around. The\nHawaikan looked from Karara to her companion, a shade of speculation in\nhis expression.\n\n\"He wants to know why you ask about the Foanna? Surely you must well\nknow what manner of beings they are.\"\n\n\"Listen--\" Ross was sure now that he had made a real discovery, though\nits importance he could not guess, \"tell him we come from where there\nare no Foanna. That we have powers and must know of their powers.\"\n\nIf he could only carry on this interrogation straight and not have to\ndepend upon a double translation! And could he even be sure his\nquestions reached the alien undistorted?\n\nWearily Ross sat back on his heels. Then he glanced at Karara with a\ntwinge of concern. If he was tired by their roundabout communication,\nshe must be doubly so. There was a droop to her shoulders, and her last\nreply had come in a voice hoarse with fatigue. Abruptly he started up.\n\n\"That's enough--for now.\"\n\nWhich was true. He had to have time for evaluation, to adjust to what\nthey had learned during the steady stream of questions passed back and\nforth. And in that moment he was conscious of his hunger, just as his\nvoice was paper dry from lack of drink. The canister of supplies he had\nleft by the cave entrance ...\n\n\"We need food and drink.\" He fumbled with his mask, but Karara motioned\nhim back from the water.\n\n\"Taua brings ... Wait!\"\n\nThe dolphin trailed the net of containers to them. Ross unscrewed one,\npulled out a bulb of fresh water. A second box yielded the dry wafers of\nemergency rations.\n\nThen, after a moment's hesitation, Ross crossed to the prisoner, cut his\nwrist bonds, and pressed both a bulb and a wafer into his hold. The\nHawaikan watched the Terrans eat before he bit into the wafer, chewing\nit with vigor, turning the bulb around in his fingers with alert\ninterest before he sucked at its contents.\n\nAs Ross chewed and swallowed, mechanically and certainly with no relish,\nhe fitted one fact to another to make a picture of this Hawaikan time\nperiod in which they were now marooned. Of course, his picture was based\non facts they had learned from their captive. Perhaps he had purposely\nmisled them or fogged some essentials. But could he have done that in a\nmental contact? Ross would simply have to accept everything with a\ncertain amount of cautious skepticism.\n\nAnyway, there were the Wreckers of the castle--petty lordlings setting\nup their holds along the coasts, preying upon the shipping which was the\nlifeblood of this island-water world. The Terrans had seen them in\naction last night and today. And if the captive's information was\ncorrect, it was not only the storm's fury which brought the waves'\nharvest. The Wreckers had some method of attracting ships to crack up on\ntheir reefs.\n\nSome method of attraction.... And that force which had pulled the\nTerrans through the time gate; could there be a connection? However,\nthere remained the Wreckers on the cliff. And their prey, the seafarers\nof the ocean, with an understandably deep enmity between them.\n\nThose two parties Ross could understand and be prepared to deal with, he\nthought. But there remained the Foanna. And, from their prisoner's\nexplanation, the Foanna were a very different matter.\n\nThey possessed a power which did not depend upon swords or ships or the\nnatural tools and weapons of men. No, they had strengths which were\nunearthly, to give them superiority in all but one way--numbers. Though\nthe Foanna had their warriors and servants, as Ross had seen on the\nbeach, they, themselves, were of another race--a very old and dying race\nof which few remained. How many, their enemies could not say, for the\nFoanna had no separate identities known to the outer world. They\nappeared, gave their orders, levied their demands, opposed or aided as\nthey wished--always just one or two at a time--always so muffled in\ntheir cloaks that even their physical appearances remained a mystery.\nBut there was no mystery about their powers. Ross gathered that no\nWrecker lord, no matter how much a leader among his own kind, how\nambitious, had yet dared to oppose actively one of the Foanna, though he\nmight make a token protest against some demand from them.\n\nAnd certainly the captive's description of those powers in action\nsuggested a supernatural origin of Foanna knowledge, or at least for its\napplication. But Ross thought that the answer might be that they\npossessed the remnants of some almost forgotten technical know-how, the\nheritage of a very old race. He had tried to learn something of the\norigin of the Foanna themselves, wondering if the robed ones could be\nfrom the galactic empire. But the answer had come that the Foanna were\nolder than recorded time, that they had lived in the great citadel\nbefore the race of the Terrans' prisoner had risen from very primitive\nsavagery.\n\n\"What do we do now?\" Karara broke in upon Ross's thoughts as she\nrefastened the containers.\n\n\"These slaves that the Wreckers take upon occasion ... Maybe Ashe....\"\nRoss was catching at very fragile straws; he had to. And the stranger\nhad said that able-bodied men who swam ashore relatively uninjured were\ntaken captive. Several had been the night before.\n\n\"Loketh.\"\n\nRoss and Karara looked around. The prisoner put down the water bulb, and\none of his hands made a gesture they could not mistake; he pointed to\nhimself and repeated that word, \"Loketh.\"\n\nThe Terran touched his own chest. \"Ross Murdock.\"\n\nPerhaps the other was as impatient as he with their roundabout method of\ncommunication and had decided to try and speed it up. The analyzer! Ashe\nhad included the analyzer with the equipment by the gate. If Ross could\nfind that ... why, then the major problem could be behind them. Swiftly\nhe explained to Karara, and with a vigorous nod of assent she called to\nTaua, ordering the rest of the salvage material from the gate be brought\nto them.\n\n\"Loketh.\" Ross pointed to the youth. \"Ross.\" That was himself. \"Karara.\"\nHe indicated the girl.\n\n\"Rosss.\" The alien made a clicking hiss of the first name. \"Karara--\" He\ndid better with the second.\n\nRoss carefully unpacked the box Taua had located. He had only slight\nknowledge of how the device worked. It was intended to record a strange\nlanguage, break it down into symbols already familiar to the Time\nAgents. But could it also be used as a translator with a totally alien\ntongue? He could only hope that the rough handling of its journey\nthrough the gate had not damaged it and that the experiment might\npossibly work.\n\nPutting the box between them, he explained what he wanted; and Karara\ntook up the small micro-disk, speaking slowly and distinctly the same\nliquid syllables she had used in the dolphin song. Ross clicked the\nlever when she was finished, and watched the small screen. The symbols\nwhich flashed there had meaning for him right enough; he could translate\nwhat she had just taped. The machine still worked to that extent.\n\nNow he pushed the box into place before Loketh and made the visibly\nreluctant Hawaikan take the disk from Karara. Then through the dolphin\nlink Ross passed on definite instructions. Would it work as well to\ntranslate a stellar tongue as it had with languages past and present of\nhis own planet?\n\nReluctantly Loketh began to talk to the disk, at first in a very rapid\nmumble and then, as there was no frightening response, with less speed\nand more confidence. There were symbol lines on the vista-plate in\naccordance, and some of them made sense! Ross was elated.\n\n\"Ask him: Can one enter the castle unseen to check on the slaves?\"\n\n\"For what reason?\"\n\nRoss was sure he had read those symbols correctly.\n\n\"Tell him--that one of our kind may be among them.\"\n\nLoketh did not reply so quickly this time. His eyes, grave and\nmeasuring, studied Ross, then Karara, then Ross again.\n\n\"There is a way ... discovered by this useless one.\"\n\nRoss did not pay attention to the odd adjective Loketh chose to describe\nhimself. He pressed to the important matter.\n\n\"Can and will he show me that way?\"\n\nAgain that long moment of appraisal on the part of Loketh before he\nanswered. Ross found himself reading the reply symbols aloud.\n\n\"If you dare, then I will lead.\"\n\n\n\n\n7\n\nWitches' Meat\n\n\nHe might be recklessly endangering all of them, Ross knew. But if Ashe\nwas immured somewhere in that rock pile over their heads, then the risk\nof trusting Loketh would be worth it. However, because Ross was chancing\nhis own neck did not mean that Karara need be drawn into immediate peril\ntoo. With the dolphins at her command and the supplies, scanty as those\nwere, she would have a good chance to hide here safely.\n\n\"Holding out for what?\" she asked quietly after Ross elaborated on this\nsubject, thus bringing him to silence.\n\nBecause her question was just. With the gate gone the Terrans were\ncommitted to this time, just as they had earlier been committed to\nHawaika when on their home world they had entered the spaceship for the\ntake-off. There was no escape from the past, which had become their\npresent.\n\n\"The Foanna,\" she continued, \"these Wreckers, the sea people--all at\nodds with one another. Do we join any, then their quarrels must also\nbecome ours.\"\n\nTaua nosed the ledge behind the girl, squeaked a demand for attention.\nKarara looked around at Loketh; her look was as searching as the one the\nnative had earlier turned on her and Ross.\n\n\"He\"--the girl nodded at the Hawaikan--\"wishes to know if you trust him.\nAnd he says to tell you this: Because the Shades chose to inflict upon\nhim a twisted leg he is not one with those of the castle, but to them a\nbroken, useless thing. Ross, I gather he thinks we have powers like the\nFoanna, and that we may be supernatural. But because we did not kill him\nout of hand and have fed him, he considers himself bound to us.\"\n\n\"Ritual of bread and salt ... could be.\" Though it might be folly to\nmatch alien customs to Terran, Ross thought of that very ancient pact on\nhis own world. Eat a man's food, become his friend, or at least declare\na truce between you. Stiff taboos and codes of behavior marked nations\non Terra, especially warrior societies, and the same might be true here.\n\n\"Ask him,\" Ross told Karara, \"what is the rule for food and drink\nbetween friends or enemies!\" The more he could learn of such customs the\nbetter protection he might be able to weave for them.\n\nLong moments for the relay of that message, and then Loketh spoke into\nthe micro-disk of the analyzer, slowly, with pauses, as if trying to\nmake sure Ross understood every word.\n\n\"To give bread into the hands of one you have taken in battle, makes him\nyour man--not as a slave to labor, but as one who draws sword at your\nbidding. When I took your bread I accepted you as cup-lord. Between such\nthere is no betrayal, for how may a man betray his lord? I, Loketh, am\nnow a sword in your hands, a man in your service. And to me this is\ndoubly good, for as a useless one I have never had a lord, nor one to\nswear to. Also, with this Sea Maid and her followers to listen to\nthoughts, how could any man speak with a double tongue were he one who\nconsorted with the Shadow and wore the Cloak of Evil?\"\n\n\"He's right,\" Karara added. \"His mind is open; he couldn't hide his\nthoughts from Taua and Tino-rau even if he wished.\"\n\n\"All right, I'll accept that.\" Ross glanced about the ledge. They had\npiled the containers at the far end. For Karara to move might be safe.\nHe said so.\n\n\"Move where?\" she asked flatly. \"Those men from the castle are still\nhunting drift out there. I don't think anyone knows of this cave.\"\n\nRoss nodded to Loketh. \"He did, didn't he? I wouldn't want you trapped\nhere. And I don't want to lose those supplies. What is in those\ncontainers may be what saves us all.\"\n\n\"We can sink those over by the wall, weight them down in a net. Then, if\nwe have to move, they will be ready. Do not worry--that is my\ndepartment.\" She smiled at him with a slightly mocking lift of lips.\n\nRoss subsided, though he was irritated because she was right. The\nmanagement of the dolphin team and sea matters were her department. And\nwhile he resented her reminder of that point he could not deny the\njustice of her retort.\n\nIn spite of his crippled leg, Loketh displayed an agility which\nsurprised Ross. Freed from his ankle bonds, he beckoned the Terran back\nto the very niche where he had hidden to watch Karara. Up he swung into\nthat and in a second had vanished from sight.\n\nRoss followed, to discover it was not a niche after all but the opening\nof a crevice, leading upward as a vent. And it had been used before as a\npassage. There was no light, but the native guided Ross's hands to the\nhollow climbing holds cut into the stone. Then Loketh pushed past and\nwent up the crude ladder into the dark.\n\nIt was difficult to judge either time or distance in this black tube.\nRoss counted the holds for some check. His agent training made one part\nof his mind sharply aware of such things; the need for memorizing a\npassage which led into the enemy's territory was apparent. What the\npurpose of this slit had originally been he did not know, but\nstrongholds on Terra had had their hidden ways in and out for use in\ntimes of siege, and he was beginning to believe that these aliens had\nmuch in common with his own kind.\n\nHe had reached twenty in his counting and his senses, alerted by\ntraining and instinct, told him there was an opening not too far above.\nBut the darkness remained so thick it fell in tangible folds about his\nsweating body. Ross almost cried out as fingers clamped about his wrist\nwhen he reached for a new hold. Then urged by that grasp, he was up and\nout, sprawling into a vertical passage. Far ahead was a gray of faint\nlight.\n\nRoss choked and then sneezed as dust puffed up from between his\nscrabbling hands. The hold which had been on his wrist shifted to his\nshoulder, and with a surprising strength Loketh hauled the Terran to his\nfeet.\n\nThe passage in which they stood was a slit extending in height well\nabove their heads, but narrow, not much wider than Ross's shoulders.\nWhether it was a natural fault or had been cut he could not tell.\n\nLoketh was ahead again, his rocking limp making the outline of his body\na jerky up-and-down shadow. Again his speed and agility amazed the\nTerran. Loketh might be lame, but he had learned to adapt to his\nhandicap very well.\n\nThe light increased and Ross marked slits in the walls to his right, no\nwider than the breadth of his two fingers. He peered out of one and was\nlooking into empty air while below he heard the murmur of the sea. This\nway must run in the cliff face above the beach.\n\nA click of impatient whisper drew him on to join Loketh. Here was a\nflight of stairs, narrow of tread and very steep. Loketh turned back and\nside against these to climb, his outspread hand flattened on the stone\nas if it possessed adhesive qualities to steady him. For the first time\nhis twisted leg was a disadvantage.\n\nRoss counted again--ten, fifteen of those steps, bringing them once more\ninto darkness. Then they emerged from a well-like opening into a\ncircular room. A sudden and dazzling flare of light made the Terran\nshade his eyes. Loketh set a pallid but glowing cone on a wall shelf,\nand the Terran discovered that the burst of light was only relative to\nthe dark of the passage; indeed it was very weak illumination.\n\nThe Hawaikan braced his body against the far wall. The strain of his\neffort, whatever its purpose, was easy to read in the contorted line of\nhis shoulders. Then the wall slid under Loketh's urging, a slow move as\nif the weight of the slab he strove to handle was almost too great for\nhis slender arms, or else the need for caution was intensified here.\n\nThey now fronted a narrow opening, and the light of the cone shone only\na few feet into the space. Loketh beckoned to Ross and they went on.\nHere the left wall was cut in many places emitting patches of light in a\nway which bore no resemblance to conventional windows. It was like\nwalking behind a pierced screen which followed no logical pattern in the\ncutaway portions. Ross gazed out and gasped.\n\nHe was standing above the center core of the castle, and the life below\nand beyond drew his attention. He had seen drawings reproducing the life\nof a feudal castle. This resembled them and yet, as Ross studied the\nscene closer, the differences between the Terran past and this became\nmore distinct.\n\nIn the first place there were those animals--or were they\nanimals?--being hooked up to a cart. They had six limbs, walking on\nfour, holding the remaining two folded under their necks. Their harness\nconsisted of a network fitted over their shoulders, anchored to the\nfolded limbs. Their grotesque heads, bobbing and weaving on lengthy\nnecks, their bodies, were sleekly scaled. Ross was startled by a\nresemblance he traced to the sea dragon he had met in the future of this\nworld.\n\nBut the creatures were subject to the men harnessing them. And the\nactivity in other respects ... Ross had to fight a wayward and\nfascinated interest in all he could see, force himself to concentrate on\nlearning what might be pertinent to his own mission. But Loketh did not\nallow him to watch for long. Instead, his hand on the Terran's arm urged\nthe other down the gallery behind the screen and once more into the bulk\nof the fortress.\n\nAnother narrow way ran through the thickness of the walls. Then a patch\nof light, not that of outer day, but a reddish gleam from an opening\nwaist high. There Loketh went awkwardly to his good knee, motioning Ross\nto follow his example.\n\nWhat lay below was a hall furnished with a barbaric rawness of color and\nglitter. There were long strips of brightly hued woven stuff on the\nwalls, touched here and there with sparkling glints which were\njewel-like. And set at intervals among the hangings were oval objects\nperhaps Ross's height on which were designs and patterns picked out in\npaint and metal. Maybe the stylized representation of native plants and\nanimals.\n\nThe whole gave an impression of clashing color, just as the garments of\nthose gathered there were garish in turn.\n\nThere were three Hawaikans on the two-step dais. All wore robes fitting\ntightly to the upper portion of their bodies, girded to their waists\nwith elaborate belts, then falling in long points to floor level, the\npoints being finished off with tassels. Their heads were covered with\ntight caps which were a latticework of decorated strips, glittering as\nthey moved. And the mixture of colors in their apparel was such as to\noffend Terran eyes with their harsh clash of shade against shade.\n\nDrawn up below the dais were two rows of guards. But the reason for the\nassembly baffled Ross, since he could not understand the clicking\nspeech.\n\nThere came a hollow echoing sound as from a gong. The three on the dais\nstraightened, turned their attention to the other end of the hall. Ross\ndid not need Loketh's gesture to know that something of importance was\nabout to begin.\n\nDown the hall was a somber note in the splash of clashing color. The\nTerran recognized the gray-blue robe of the Foanna. There were three of\nthe robed ones this time, one slightly in advance of the other two. They\ncame at a gliding pace as if they swept along above that paved flooring,\nnot by planting feet upon it. As they halted below the dais the men\nthere rose.\n\nRoss could read their reluctance to make that concession in the slowness\nof their movements. They were plainly being compelled to render\ndeference when they longed to refuse it. Then the middle one of the\ncastle lords spoke first.\n\n\"Zahur--\" Loketh breathed in Ross's ear, his pointed finger indicating\nthe speaker.\n\nRoss longed vainly for the ability to ask questions, a chance to know\nwhat was in progress. That the meeting of the two Hawaikan factions was\nimportant he did not doubt.\n\nThere was an interval of silence after the castle lord finished\nspeaking. To the Terran this spun on and on and he sensed the mounting\ntension. This must be a showdown, perhaps even a declaration of open\nhostilities between Wreckers and the older race. Or perhaps the pause\nwas a subtle weapon of the Foanna, used to throw a less-sophisticated\nenemy off balance, as a judo fighter might use an opponent's attack as\npart of his own defense.\n\nWhen the Foanna did make answer it came in the singsong of chanted\nwords. Ross felt Loketh shiver, felt the crawl of chill along his own\nspine. The words--if those were words and not just sounds intended to\nplay upon the mind and emotions of a listener--cut into one. Ross wanted\nto close his ears, thrust his fingers into them to drown out that sound,\nyet he did not have the power to raise his hands.\n\nIt seemed to him that the men on the dais were swaying now as if the\nchant were a rope leashed about them, pulling them back and forth. There\nwas a clatter; one of the guards had fallen to the floor and lay there,\nrolling, his hands to his head.\n\nA shout from the dais. The chanting reached a note so high that Ross\nfelt the torment in his ears. Below, the lines of guards had broken. A\nparty of them were heading for the end of the hall, making a wide detour\naround the Foanna. Loketh gave a small choked cry; his fingers tightened\non Ross's forearm with painful intensity as he whispered.\n\nWhat was about to happen meant something important. To Loketh or to him?\nAshe! Was this concerned with Ashe? Ross crowded against the opening,\ntried to see the direction in which the guards had disappeared.\n\nThe wait made him doubly impatient. One of the men on the dais had\ndropped on the bench there, his head forward on his hands, his shoulders\nquivering. But the one Loketh had identified as Zahur still fronted the\nFoanna spokesman, and Ross gave tribute to the strength of will which\nkept him there.\n\nThey were returning, the guards, and herded between their lines three\nmen. Two were Hawaikans, their bare dark bodies easily identifiable. But\nthe third--Ashe! Ross almost shouted his name aloud.\n\nThe Terran stumbled along and there was a bandage above his knee. He had\nbeen stripped to his swimming trunks, all his equipment taken from him.\nThere was a dark bruise on his left temple, the angry weal of a lash\nmark on neck and shoulder.\n\nRoss's hands clenched. Never in his life had he so desperately wanted a\nweapon as he did at that moment. To spray the company below with a\nmachine gun would have given him great satisfaction. But he had nothing\nbut the knife in his belt and he was as cut off from Ashe as if they\nwere in separate cells of some prison.\n\nThe caution which had been one of his inborn gifts and which had been\nfostered by his training, clamped down on his first wild desire for\naction. There was not the slightest chance of his doing Ashe any good at\nthe present. But he had this much--he knew that Gordon was alive and\nthat he was in the aliens' hands. Faced by those facts Ross could plan\nhis own moves.\n\nThe Foanna chant began again, and the three prisoners moved; the two\nHawaikans turned, set themselves on either side of Ashe, and gave him\nsupport. Their actions had a mechanical quality as if they were directed\nby a will beyond their own. Ashe gazed about him at the Wreckers and the\nrobed figures. His awareness of them both suggested to Ross that if the\nnatives had come under the control of the Foanna, the Terran resisted\ntheir influence. But Ashe did not try to escape the assistance of his\ntwo fellow prisoners, and he limped with their aid back down the hall,\nfollowing the Foanna.\n\nRoss deduced that the captives had been transferred from the lord of the\ncastle to the Foanna. Which meant Ashe was on his way to another\ndestination. The Terran was on his feet and headed back, intent on\nreturning to the sea cave and starting out after Ashe as soon as he\ncould.\n\n\"You have found Gordon!\" Karara read his news from his face.\n\n\"The Wreckers had him prisoner. Now they've turned him over to the\nFoanna--\"\n\n\"What will _they_ do with him?\" the girl demanded of Loketh.\n\nHis answer came roundabout as usual as the native squatted by the\nanalyzer and clicked his answer into it.\n\n\"They have claimed the wreck survivors for tribute. Your companion will\nbe witches' meat.\"\n\n\"Witches' meat?\" repeated Ross, uncomprehending.\n\nThen Karara drew a gagged breath which was a gasp of horror.\n\n\"Sacrifice! Ross, he must mean they are going to use Gordon for a\nsacrifice.\"\n\nRoss stiffened and then whirled to catch Loketh by the shoulders. The\ninability to question the native directly was an added disaster now.\n\n\"Where are they taking him? Where?\" He began that fiercely, and then\nforced control on himself.\n\nKarara's eyes were half closed, her head back; she was manifestly aiming\nthat inquiry at the dolphins, to be translated to Loketh.\n\nSymbols burned on the analyzer screen.\n\n\"The Foanna have their own fortress. It can be entered best by sea.\nThere is a boat ... I can show you, for it is my own secret.\"\n\n\"Tell him--yes, as soon as we can!\" Ross broke out. The old feeling that\ntime was all-important worried at him. Witches' meat ... witches' meat\n... the words were sharp as a lash.\n\n\n\n\n8\n\nThe Free Rovers\n\n\nTwilight made a gray world where one could not trace the true meeting of\nland and water, sea and sky. Surely the haze about them was more than\njust the normal dusk of coming night.\n\nRoss balanced in the middle of the skiff as it bobbed along the swell of\nwaves inside a barrier reef. To his mind the craft carrying the three of\nthem and their net of supplies was too frail, rode too high. But Karara\npaddling in the bow, Loketh at the stern seemed to be content, and Ross\ncould not, for pride's sake, question their competency. He comforted\nhimself with the knowledge that no agent was able to absorb every\nprimitive skill, and Karara's people had explored the Pacific in\nout-rigger canoes hardly more stable than their present vessel,\nnavigating by currents and stars.\n\nSmothering his feeling of helplessness and the slow anger that roused in\nhim, the Terran busied himself with study of a sort. They had had the\nlonger part of the day in the cave before Loketh would agree to venture\nout of hiding and paddle south. Ross, using the analyzer, had, with\nLoketh's aid, set about learning what he could of the native tongue.\n\nNow possessed of a working vocabulary of clicked words, he was able to\nfollow Loketh's speech so that translation through the dolphins was not\nnecessary except for complicated directions. Also, he had a more\ndetailed briefing of the present situation on Hawaika.\n\nEnough to know that they might be embarking on a mad venture. The\ncitadel of the Foanna was distinctly forbidden ground, not only for\nLoketh's people but also for the Foanna's Hawaikan followers who were\nhoused and labored in an outer ring of fortification-cum-village. Those\nnatives were, Ross gathered, a hereditary corps of servants and\nwarriors, born to that status and not recruited from the native\npopulation at large. As such, they were armored by the \"magic\" of their\nmasters.\n\n\"If the Foanna are so powerful,\" Ross had demanded, \"why do you go with\nus against them?\" To depend so heavily on the native made him uneasy.\n\nThe Hawaikan looked to Karara. One of his hands raised; his fingers\nsketched a sign toward the girl.\n\n\"With the Sea Maid and her magic I do not fear.\" He paused before\nadding, \"Always has it been said of me--and to me--that I am a useless\none, fit only to do women's tasks. No word weaver shall ever chant my\nbattle deeds in the great hall of Zahur. I who am Zahur's true son can\nnot carry my sword in any lord's train. But now you offer me one of the\ngreat to-be-remembered quests. If I go, so may I prove that I am a man,\neven if I go limpingly. There is nothing the Foanna can do to me which\nis worse than what the Shadow has already done. Choosing to follow you I\nmay stand up to face Zahur in his own hall, show him that the blood of\nhis House has not been drained from my veins because I walk crookedly!\"\n\nThere was such bitter fire, not only in the sputtering rush of Loketh's\nwords, but in his eyes, his face, the wry twist of his lips, that Ross\nbelieved him. The Terran no longer had any doubts that the castle\noutcast was willing to brave the unknown terrors of the Foanna keep, not\njust to aid Ross whom he considered himself bound to serve by the\ncustoms of his people, but because he saw in this venture a chance to\ngain what he had never had, a place in his warrior culture.\n\nShut off from the normal life of his people, he had early turned to the\nsea. His twisted leg had not proved a handicap in the water, and he\nstated with confidence that he was the best swimmer in the castle. Not\nthat the men of his father's following had taken greatly to the sea,\nwhich they looked upon merely as a way of preying upon the true sea\nrovers.\n\nThe reef on which the ships had been wrecked was a snare of sorts--first\nby the whim of nature when wind and current piled up the trading ships\nthere. Then, Ross was startled when Loketh elaborated on a later\ndevelopment of that trap.\n\n\"So Zahur returned from this meeting and set up a great magic among the\nrock, according to the spells he was taught. Now ships are drawn there\nso the wrecks have been many and Zahur becomes an even greater lord with\nmany men coming to take sword oath under him.\"\n\n\"This magic,\" asked Ross, \"of what manner is it and where did Zahur\nobtain it?\"\n\n\"It is fashioned so--\" Loketh sketched two straight lines in the air,\n\"not curved as a sword. And the color of water under a storm sky, both\nrods being as tall as a man. There was much care to set them in place,\nthat was done by a man of Glicmas.\"\n\n\"A man of Glicmas?\"\n\n\"Glicmas is now the high lord of the Iccio. He is blood kin to Zahur,\nyet Zahur must take sword oath to send to Glicmas a fourth of all his\nsea-gleanings for a year in payment for this magic.\"\n\n\"And Glicmas, where did he get it? From the Foanna?\"\n\nLoketh made an emphatic denial of that. \"No, the Foanna have spoken out\nagainst their use, making even greater ill feeling between the Old Ones\nand the coast people. It is said that Glicmas saw a great wonder in the\nsky and followed it to a high place of his own country. A mountain broke\nin twain and a voice issued forth from the rent, calling that the lord\nof the country come and stand to hear it. When Glicmas did so he was\ntold that the magic would be his. Then the mountain closed again and he\nfound many strange things upon the ground. As he uses them they make him\nakin to the Foanna in power. Some he gives to those who are his blood\nkin, and together they will be great until they close their fists not\nonly upon the sea rovers, but upon the Foanna also. This they have come\nto believe.\"\n\n\"But you do not?\" Karara asked then.\n\n\"I do not know, Sea Maid. The time is coming when perhaps they shall\nhave their chance to prove how strong is their magic. Already the Rovers\ngather in fleets as they never did before. And it seems that they, too,\nhave found a new magic, for their ships fly through the water, depending\nno longer on wind-filling sails, or upon strong arms of men at long\npaddles. There is a struggle before us. But that you must know, being\nwho and what you are, Sea Maid.\"\n\n\"And what do you think I am? What do you think Ross is?\"\n\n\"If the Foanna dwell on land and hold old knowledge and power beyond our\nreckoning in their two hands,\" he replied, \"then it is possible that the\nsame could have roots in the sea. It is my belief that you are of the\nShades, but not the Shadow. And this warrior is also of your kind--but\nperhaps in different degree, putting into action your desires and\nwishes. Thus, if you go up against the Foanna, you shall be well\nmatched, kind to kind.\"\n\nNice to be so certain of that, Ross thought. He did not share Loketh's\nconfidence on that subject.\n\n\"The Shades ... the Shadow ...\" Karara persisted. \"What are these,\nLoketh?\"\n\nAn odd expression crossed the Hawaikan's face. \"Are those not known\nto you, Sea Maid? Indeed, then you are of a breed different from the\nmen of land. The Shades are those of power who may come to the aid\nof men should it be their desire to influence the future. And the\nShadow ... the Shadow is That Which Ends All--man, hope, good. To Which\nthere is no appeal, and Which holds a vast and enduring hatred for that\nwhich has life and full substance.\"\n\n\"So Zahur has this new magic. Is it the gift of Shades or Shadow?\" Ross\nbrought them back to the subject which had sparked in him a small\nwarning signal.\n\n\"Zahur prospers mightily.\" Loketh's answer was ambiguous.\n\n\"And so the Shadow could not provide such magic?\" The Terran pushed.\n\nBut before the Hawaikan had a chance to answer, Karara added another\nquestion:\n\n\"But you believe that it did?\"\n\n\"I do not know. Only the magic has made Zahur a part of Glicmas, and\nGlicmas is now perhaps a part of that which spoke from the mountain. It\nis not well to accept gifts which tie one man to another unless there is\nfrom the first a saying of how deep that bond may run.\"\n\n\"I think you are wise in that, Loketh,\" Karara said.\n\nBut the uneasiness had grown in Ross. Alien powers, out of a mountain\nheart, passed from one lord to another. And on the other hand the\nRovers' sudden magic in turn, lending their ships wings. The two facts\nbalanced in an odd way. Back on Terra there had been those sudden and\nunaccountable jumps in technical knowledge on the part of the enemy,\njumps which had set in action the whole Time Travel service of which he\nhad become a part. And these jumps had not been the result of normal\nresearch; they had come from the looting of derelict spaceships wrecked\non his world in the far past.\n\nCould driblets of the same stellar knowledge have been here deliberately\nfed to warring communities? He asked Loketh about the possibility of\nspace-borne explorers. But to the Hawaikan that was a totally foreign\nconception. The stars, for Loketh, were the doorways and windows of the\nShades, and he treated the suggestion of space travel as perhaps natural\nto those all-powerful specters, but certainly not for beings like\nhimself. There was no hint that Hawaika had been openly visited by a\ngalactic ship. Though that did not bar such landings. The planet was,\nRoss thought, thinly populated. Whole sections of the interiors of the\nlarger islands were wilderness, and this world must be in the same state\nof only partial occupation as his own earth had been in the Bronze Age\nwhen tribes on the march had fanned out into virgin wilderness, great\nforests, and steppes unwalked by man before their coming.\n\nNow as he balanced in the canoe and tried to keep his mind off the\nqueasiness in his middle and the insecurity of the one thickness of\nsea-creature hide stretched over a bone framework which made up the\ncraft between his person and the water, Ross still mulled over what\nmight be true. Had the galactic invaders for their own purposes begun to\nmeddle here, leaking weapons or tools to upset what must be a very\ndelicate balance of power? Why? To bring on a conflict which would\noccupy the native population to the point of exhaustion or depopulation?\nSo they could win a world for their own purposes without effort or risk\non their part? Such cold-blooded fishing in carefully troubled waters\nfitted very well with the persons of the Baldies as he had known them on\nTerra.\n\nAnd he could not set aside that memory of this very coast as he had seen\nit through the peep, the castle in ruins, tall pylons reaching from the\nland into the sea. Was this the beginning of that change which would end\nin the Hawaika of his own time, empty of intelligent life, shattered\ninto a loose network of islands?\n\n\"This fog is strange.\" Karara's words startled Ross to return to the\nhere and now.\n\nThe haze he had been only half conscious of when they had put out from\nthe tiny secret bay where Loketh kept his boat, was truly a fog, piling\nup in soft billows and cutting down visibility with speed.\n\n\"The Foanna!\" Loketh's answer was sharp, a recognition of danger. \"Their\nmagic--they hide their place so! There is trouble, trouble on the move!\"\n\n\"Do we land then?\" Ross did not ascribe the present blotting out of the\nlandscape to any real manipulation of nature on the part of the\nall-powerful Foanna. Too many times the reputations of \"medicine men\"\nhad been so enhanced by coincidence. But he did doubt the wisdom of\ntrying to bore ahead blindly in this murk.\n\n\"Taua and Tino-rau can guide us,\" Karara reminded him. \"Throw out the\nrope, Ross. What is above water will not confuse them.\"\n\nHe moved cautiously, striving to adapt his actions to the swing of the\nboat. The line was ready coiled to hand and he tossed the loose end\noverboard, to feel the cord jerk taut as one of the dolphins caught it\nup.\n\nThey were being towed now, though both paddlers reinforced the forward\ntug with their efforts. The curtain gathering above the surface of the\nwater did not hamper the swimmers beneath its surface, and Ross felt\nrelief. He turned his head to speak to Loketh.\n\n\"How near are we?\"\n\nThe mist had thickened to the point that, close as the native was, the\nlines of his body blurred. His clicking answer seemed distorted, too,\nalmost as if the fog had altered not only his form but his personality.\n\n\"Maybe very soon now. We must see the sea gate before we are sure.\"\n\n\"And if we aren't able to see that?\" challenged Ross.\n\n\"The sea gate is above and below the water. Those who obey the Sea Maid,\nwho are able to speak thought to thought, will find it if we can not.\"\n\nBut they were never to reach that goal. Karara gave warning: \"There are\nships about.\"\n\nRoss knew that the dolphins had told her. He demanded in turn: \"What\nkind?\"\n\n\"Larger, much larger than this.\"\n\nThen Loketh broke in: \"A Rover Raider--three of them!\"\n\nRoss frowned. He was the cripple here. The other two, with their ability\nto communicate with the dolphins, were the sighted, he the blind. And he\nresented his handicap in a burst of bitterness which must have colored\nhis tone as he ordered, \"Head inshore--now!\"\n\nOnce on land, even in the fog, he felt that they had the advantage in\nany hide-and-seek which might ensue with this superior enemy force. But\nafloat he was helpless and vulnerable, a state Ross did not accept\neasily.\n\n\"No,\" Loketh returned as sharply. \"There is no place to land along the\ncliff.\"\n\n\"We are between two of the ships,\" Karara reported.\n\n\"Your paddles--\" Ross schooled his voice to a whisper, \"hold them--don't\nuse them. Let the dolphins take us on. In the fog, if we make no sound,\nwe may get by the ships.\"\n\n\"Right!\" Karara agreed, and he heard an assenting grunt from Loketh.\n\nThey were moving very slowly. Strong as the dolphins were, they dared\nnot expend all their strength on towing the skiff too fast. Ross thought\nfuriously. Perhaps the sea could be their way of escape if the need\narose. He had no idea why raiding ships were moving under the cover of\nfog into the vicinity of the Foanna citadel. But the Terran's knowledge\nof tactics led him to guess that this impending visit was not\nanticipated by the Foanna, nor was it a friendly one. And, as veteran\nseamen who should normally be wary of fog as thick as this, the Rovers\nthemselves must have a driving reason, or some safeguard which led them\nhere now.\n\nBut dared the three spill out of their boat, trust to their swimming\nability and that of the dolphins, and invade the Foanna sea gate so?\nCould they use the coming Rover attack as a cover for their own invasion\nof the hold? Ross considered that the odds in their favor were beginning\nto look better.\n\nHe whispered his idea and began to prepare their gear. The boat was\nstill headed for the shore the three could not see. But they could hear\nsounds out of the white cotton wall which told them how completely they\nwere boxed in by the raiders; creaks, whispers, noises, Ross could not\nreadily identify, carried across the waves.\n\nBefore leaving the cave and beginning this voyage they had introduced\nLoketh to the use of the gill-pack, made him practice in the depths of\nthe cave pool with one of the extras drawn through the gate among the\nsupplies. Now all three were equipped with the water aid, and they could\nbe gone in the sea before the trap closed.\n\n\"The supply net--\" Ross warned Karara. A moment or two later there was a\nsmall bump against the skiff at his left hand. He cautiously raised the\ncollection of containers and eased the burden into the water, knowing\nthat one of the dolphins would take charge of it.\n\nHowever, he was not prepared for what happened next. Under him the boat\nlurched first one way and then the other in sharp jerks as if the\ndolphins were trying to spill them into the sea. Ross heard Karara call\nout, her voice thin and frightened:\n\n\"Taua! Tino-rau! They have gone mad! They will not listen!\"\n\nThe boat raced in a zigag path. Loketh clutched at Ross, striving to\nsteady him, to keep the boat on an even keel.\n\n\"The Foanna--!\" Just as Loketh cried out, Karara plunged over the prow\nof the boat, whether by design or chance Ross did not know.\n\nAnd then the craft whirled about, smashed side against side with a dark\nbulk looming out of the fog. Above, Ross heard cries, knew that they had\ncrashed against one of the raiders. He fought to retain his balance, but\nhe had been knocked to the bottom of the boat against Loketh and they\nstruggled together, unable to move during a precious second or two.\n\nOut of the air over their heads dropped a mass of waving strands which\nenveloped both of them. The stuff was adhesive, slimy. Ross let out a\nchoked cry as the lines tightened about his arms and body, pinioning\nhim.\n\nThose tightened, wove a net. Now he was being drawn up out of the\nplunging skiff, a helpless captive. His flailing legs, still free of the\nslimy cords, struck against the side of the larger ship. Then he swung\nin, over the well of the deck, thudded down on that surface with\nbruising force, unable to understand anything except that he had been\ntaken prisoner by a very effective device.\n\nLoketh dropped beside him. But Karara was not brought in, and Ross held\nto that small bit of hope. Had she made it to freedom by dropping into\nthe water before the Rovers netted them? He could see men gathering\nabout him, masked and distorted in the fog. Then he was rolled across\nthe deck, boosted over the edge of a hatch and knew an instant of terror\nas he fell into the depth below.\n\nHow long was he unconscious? It could not have been very long, Ross\ndecided, as he opened his eyes on dark, heard the small sounds of the\nship. He lay very still, trying to remember, to gather his wits before\nhe tried to flex his arms. They were held tight to his sides by strands\nwhich no longer seemed slimy, but were wrinkling as they dried. There\nwas an odor from them which gagged him. But there was no loosening of\nthose loops in spite of his struggles, which grew more intense as his\nstrength returned. And at last he lay panting, knowing there was no easy\nway of escape from here.\n\n\n\n\n9\n\nBattle Test\n\n\nBabble of speech, cries, sounded muffled to Ross, made a mounting clamor\non the deck. Had the raiders' ship been boarded? Was it now under\nattack? He strove to hear and think through the pain in his head, the\nbewilderment.\n\n\"Loketh?\" He was certain that the Hawaikan had been dumped into the same\nhold.\n\nThe only answer was a low moan, a mutter from the dark. Ross began to\ninch his way in that direction. He was no seaman, but during that worm's\nprogress he realized that the ship itself had changed. The vibration\nwhich had carried through the planks on which he lay was stilled. Some\nengine shut off; one portion of his mind put that into familiar terms.\nNow the vessel rocked with the waves, did not bore through them.\n\nRoss brought up against another body.\n\n\"Loketh!\"\n\n\"Ahhhhh ... the fire ... the fire--!\" The half-intelligible answer held\nno meaning for the Terran. \"It burns in my head ... the fire--\"\n\nThe rocking of the ship rolled Ross away from his fellow prisoner toward\nthe opposite side of the hold. There was a roar of voice, bull strong\nabove the noise on deck, then the sound of feet back and forth there.\n\n\"The fire ... ahhh--\" Loketh's voice rose to a scream.\n\nRoss was now wedged between two abutments he could not see and from\nwhich his best efforts could not free him. The pitching of the ship was\nmore pronounced. Remembering the two vessels he had seen pounded to bits\non the reef, Ross wondered if the same doom loomed for this one. But\nthat disaster had occurred during a storm. And, save for the fog, this\nhad been a calm night, the sea untroubled.\n\nUnless--maybe the shaking his body had received during the past few\nmoments had sharpened his thinking--unless the Foanna had their own\nmeans of protection at the sea gate and this was the result. The\ndolphins.... What had made Tino-rau and Taua react as they did? And if\nthe Rover ship was out of control, it would be a good time to attempt\nescape.\n\n\"Loketh!\" Ross dared to call louder. \"Loketh!\" He struggled against the\ndrying strands which bound him from shoulder to mid thigh. There was no\ngive in them.\n\nMore sounds from the upper deck. Now the ship was answering to direction\nagain. The Terran heard sounds he could not identify, and the ship no\nlonger rocked so violently. Loketh moaned.\n\nAs far as Ross could judge, they were heading out to sea.\n\n\"Loketh!\" He wanted information; he must have it! To be so ignorant of\nwhat was going on was unbearable frustration. If they were now prisoners\nin a ship leaving the island behind.... The threat of that was enough to\nset Ross struggling with his bonds until he lay panting with exhaustion.\n\n\"Rossss?\" Only a Hawaikan could make that name a hiss.\n\n\"Here! Loketh?\" But of course it was Loketh.\n\n\"I am here.\" The other's voice sounded oddly weak as if it issued from a\nman drained by a long illness.\n\n\"What happened to you?\" Ross demanded.\n\n\"The fire ... the fire in my head--eating ... eating....\" Loketh's reply\ncame with long pauses between the words.\n\nThe Terran was puzzled. What fire? Loketh had certainly reacted to\nsomething beyond the unceremonious handling they had received as\ncaptives. This whole ship had reacted. And the dolphins.... But what\nfire was Loketh talking about?\n\n\"I did not feel anything,\" he stated to himself as well as to the\nHawaikan.\n\n\"Nothing burning in your head? So you could not think--\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"It must have been the Foanna magic. Fire eating so that a man is\nnothing, only that which fire feeds upon!\"\n\nKarara! Ross's thoughts flashed back to those few seconds when the\ndolphins had seemed to go crazy. Karara had then called out something\nabout the Foanna. So the dolphins must have felt this, and Karara, and\nLoketh. Whatever _it_ was. But why not Ross Murdock?\n\nKarara possessed an extra, undefinable sense which gave her contact with\nthe dolphins. Loketh had a mind which those could read in turn. But such\ncommunication was closed to Ross.\n\nAt first that realization carried with it a feeling of shame and loss.\nThat he did not have what these others possessed, a subtle power beyond\nthe body, a part of mind, was humbling. Just as he had felt shut out and\ncrippled when he had been forced to use the analyzer instead of the\nsense the others had, so did he suffer now.\n\nThen Ross laughed shortly. All right, sometimes insensitivity could be a\ndefense as it had at the sea gate. Suppose his lack could also be a\nweapon? He had not been knocked out as the others appeared to be. But\nfor the bad luck of having been captured before the raiders had\nsuccumbed, Ross could, perhaps, have been master of this ship by now. He\ndid not laugh now; he smiled sardonically at his own grandiose reaction.\nNo use thinking about what might have been, just file this fact for\nfuture reference.\n\nA creaking overhead heralded the opening of the hatch. Light lanced down\ninto the cubby, and a figure swung over and down a side ladder, coming\nto stand over Ross, feet apart for balancing, accommodating to the swing\nof the vessel with the ease of long practice.\n\nThus Ross came face to face with his first representative of the third\nparty in the Hawaikan tangle of power--a Rover.\n\nThe seaman was tall, with a heavier development of shoulder and upper\narms than the landsmen. Like the guards he wore supple armor, but this\nhad been colored or overlaid with a pearly hue in which other tints wove\nopaline lines. His head was bare except for a broad, scaled band running\nfrom the nape of his neck to the mid-point of his forehead, a band\nsupporting a sharply serrated crest not unlike the erect fin of some\nTerran fish.\n\nNow as he stood, fists planted on hips, the Rover presented a formidable\nfigure, and Ross recognized in him the air of command. This must be one\nof the ship's officers.\n\nDark eyes surveyed Ross with interest. The light from the deck focused\ndirectly across the raider's shoulder to catch the Terran in its full\nglare, and Ross fought the need for squinting. But he tried to give back\nstare for stare, confidence for self-confidence.\n\nOn Terra in the past more than one adventurer's life had been saved\nsimply because he had the will and nerve enough to face his captors\nwithout any display of anxiety. Such bravado might not hold here and\nnow, but it was the only weapon Ross had to hand and he used it.\n\n\"You--\" the Rover broke the silence first, \"you are not of the Foanna--\"\nHe paused as if waiting an answer--denial or protest. Ross provided\nneither.\n\n\"No, not of the Foanna, nor of the scum of the coast either.\" Again a\npause.\n\n\"So, what manner of fish has come to the net of Torgul?\" He called an\norder aloft. \"A rope here! We'll have this fish and its fellow out--\"\n\nLoketh and Ross were jerked up to the outer deck, dumped into the midst\nof a crowd of seamen. The Hawaikan was left to lie but, at a gesture\nfrom the officer, Ross was set on his feet. He could see the nature of\nhis bonds now, a network of dull gray strands, shriveled and stinking,\nbut not giving in the least when he made another try at moving his arms.\n\n\"Ho--\" The officer grinned. \"This fish does not like the net! You have\nteeth, fish. Use them, slash yourself free.\"\n\nA murmur of applause from the crew answered that mild taunt. Ross\nthought it time for a countermove.\n\n\"I see you do not come too close to those teeth.\" He used the most\ndefiant words his limited Hawaikan vocabulary offered.\n\nThere was a moment of silence, and then the officer clapped his hands\ntogether with a sharp explosion of sound.\n\n\"You would use your teeth, fish?\" he asked and his tone could be a\nwarning.\n\nThis was going it blind with a vengeance, but Ross took the next leap in\nthe dark. He had the feeling, which often came to him in tight quarters,\nthat he was being supplied from some hard core of endurance and\ndetermination far within him with the right words, the fortunate guess.\n\n\"On which one of you?\" He drew his lips tight, displaying those same\nteeth, wondering for one startled moment if he should take the Rover's\nquery literally.\n\n\"Vistur! Vistur!\" More than one voice called.\n\nOne of the crew took a step or two forward. Like Torgul, he was tall and\nheavy, his over-long arms well muscled. There were scars on his\nforearms, the seam of one up his jaw. He looked what he was, a very\ntough fighting man, one who was judged so by peers as seasoned and\ndangerous.\n\n\"Do you choose to prove your words on Vistur, fish?\" Again the officer\nhad a formal note in his question, as if this was all part of some\nceremony.\n\n\"If he meets with me as he stands--no other weapons.\" Ross flashed back.\n\nNow he had another reaction from them. There were some jeers, a\nsprinkling of threats as to Vistur's intentions. But Ross caught also\nthe fact that two or three of them had gone silent and were eyeing him\nin a new and more searching fashion and that Torgul was one of those.\n\nVistur laughed. \"Well said, fish. So shall it be.\"\n\nTorgul's hand came out, palm up, facing Ross. In its hollow was a small\nobject the Terran could not see clearly. A new weapon? Only the officer\nmade no move to touch it to Ross, the hand merely moved in a series of\nwaves in mid-air. Then the Rover spoke.\n\n\"He carries no unlawful magic.\"\n\nVistur nodded. \"He's no Foanna. And what need have I to fear the spells\nof any coast crawler? I am Vistur!\"\n\nAgain the yells of his supporters arose in hearty answer. The statement\nheld more complete and quiet confidence than any wordy boast.\n\n\"And I am Ross Murdock!\" The Terran matched the Rover tone for tone.\n\"But does a fish swim with its fins bound to its sides? Or does Vistur\nfear a free fish too greatly to face one?\"\n\nHis taunt brought the result Ross wanted. The ties were cut from behind,\nto flutter down as withered, useless strings. Ross flexed his arms.\nTight as those thongs had been they had not constricted circulation, and\nhe was ready to meet Vistur. The Terran did not doubt that the Rover\nchampion was a formidable fighter, but he had not had the advantage of\ngoing through one of the Agent training courses. Every trick of unarmed\nfighting known on his own world had been pounded into Ross long ago. His\nhands and feet could be as deadly weapons as any crook-bladed sword--or\ngun--provided he could get close enough to use them properly.\n\nVistur stripped off his weapon belt, put to one side his helmet, showing\nthat under it his hair was plaited into a braid coiled about the crown\nof his head to provide what must be an extra padding for that strangely\nnarrowed helm. Then he peeled off his armor, peeled it literally indeed,\ncatching the lower edge of the scaled covering with his hands and\npulling it up and over his head and shoulders as one might skin off a\nknitted garment. Now he stood facing Ross, wearing little more than the\nTerran's swimming trunks.\n\nRoss had dropped his belt and gill-pack. He moved into the circle the\ncrew had made. From above came a strong light, centering from a point on\nthe mainmast and giving him good sight of his opponent.\n\nVistur was being urged to make a quick end of the reckless challenger,\nhis supporters shouting directions and encouragement. But if the Rover\nhad confidence, he also possessed the more intelligent and valuable\ntrait of caution in the face of the unknown. He outweighed, apparently\noutmatched Ross, but he did not rush in rashly as his backers wished him\nto.\n\nThey circled, Ross studying every move of the Rover's muscles, every\nslight fraction of change in the other's balance. There would be\nsomething to telegraph an attack from the other. For he intended to\nfight purely in defense.\n\nThe charge came at last as the crew grew impatient and yelled their\nimpatience to see the prisoner taught a lesson. But Ross did not believe\nit was that which sent Vistur at him. The Hawaikan simply thought he\nknew the best way to take the Terran.\n\nRoss ducked so that a hammer blow merely grazed him. But the Terran's\nstiffened hand swept sidewise in a judo chop. Vistur gave a whooping cry\nand went to his knees and Ross swung again, sending the Rover flat to\nthe deck. It had been quick but not so vicious as it might have been.\nThe Terran had no desire to kill or even disable Vistur for more than a\nfew minutes. His victim would carry a couple of aching bruises and\nperhaps a hearty respect for a new mode of fighting from this encounter.\nHe could have as easily been dead had either of those blows landed other\nthan where Ross chose to plant them.\n\n\"Ahhhh--\"\n\nThe Terran swung around, setting his back to the foot of the mast. Had\nhe guessed wrong? With their chosen champion down, would the crew now\nrush him? He had gambled on the element of fair play which existed in a\nprimitive Terran warrior society after a man-to-man challenge. But he\ncould be wrong. Ross waited, tense. Just let one of them pull a weapon,\nand it could be his end.\n\nTwo of them were aiding Vistur to his feet. The Rover's breath whistled\nin and out of him with that same whooping, and both of his hands rose\nunsteadily to his chest. The majority of his fellows stared from him to\nthe slighter Terran as if unable to believe the evidence of their eyes.\n\nTorgul gathered up from the deck the belt and gill-pack Ross had shed in\npreparation for the fight. He turned the belt around over his forearm\nuntil the empty knife sheath was uppermost. One of the crew came forward\nand slammed back into its proper place the long diver's knife which had\nbeen there when Ross was captured. Then the Rover offered belt and\ngill-pack to Ross. The Terran relaxed. His gamble had paid off; by the\npresent signs he had won his freedom.\n\n\"And my swordsman?\" As he buckled on the belt Ross nodded at Loketh\nstill lying bound where they had pushed him at the beginning of the\nfight.\n\n\"He is sworn to you?\" Torgul asked.\n\n\"He is.\"\n\n\"Loose the coast rat then,\" the Rover ordered. \"Now--tell me, stranger,\nwhat manner of man are you? Do you come from the Foanna, after all? You\nhave a magic which is not our magic, since the Stone of Phutka did not\nreveal it on you. Are you from the Shades?\"\n\nHis fingers moved in the same sign Loketh had once made before Karara.\nRoss gave his chosen explanation.\n\n\"I am from the sea, Captain. As for the Foanna, they are no friend to\nme, since they hold captive in their keep one who is my brother-kin.\"\n\nTorgul stared him up and down. \"You say you are from the sea. I have\nbeen a Rover since I was able to stumble on my two feet across a deck,\nafter the manner and custom of my people, yet I have never seen your\nlike before. Perhaps your coming means ill to me and mine, but by the\nLaw of Battle, you have won your freedom on this ship. I swear to you,\nhowever, stranger, that if ill comes from you, then the Law will not\nhold, and you shall match your magic against the Strength of Phutka.\nThat you shall discover is another thing altogether.\"\n\n\"I will swear any oath you desire of me, Captain, that I have no ill\ntoward you and yours. There is only one wish I hold: to bring him whom I\nseek out from the Foanna hold before they make him witches' meat.\"\n\n\"That will be a task worthy of any magic you may be able to summon,\nstranger. We have tasted this night of the power of the sea gate. Though\nwe went in under the Will of Phutka, we were as weeds whirled about on\nthe waves. Who enters that gate must have more force than any we now\nknow.\"\n\n\"And you, too, then have a score to settle with the Foanna?\"\n\n\"We have a score against the Foanna, or against their magic,\" Torgul\nadmitted. \"Three ships--one island fairing--are gone as if they never\nwere! And those who went with them are of our fleet-clan. There is the\nwork of the Shadow stretching dark and heavy across the sea, new come\ninto these waters. But there remains nothing we can do this night. We\nhave been lucky to win to sea again. Now, stranger, what shall we do\nwith you? Or will you take to the sea again since you name it as home?\"\n\n\"Not here,\" Ross countered swiftly. He must gain some idea of where they\nmight be in relation to the island, how far from its shore. Karara and\nthe dolphins--what had happened to them?\n\n\"You took no other prisoners?\" Ross had to ask.\n\n\"There were more of you?\" Torgul countered.\n\n\"Yes.\" No need to say how many, Ross decided.\n\n\"We saw no others. You ... all of you--\" the Captain rounded on the\nstill-clustered crew, \"get about your work! We must raise Kyn Add by\nmorning and report to the council.\"\n\nHe walked away and Ross, determined to learn all he could, followed him\ninto the stern cabin. Here again the Terran was faced with barbaric\nsplendor in carvings, hangings, a wealth of plate and furnishing not too\ndifferent from the display he had seen in the Wreckers' castle. As Ross\nhesitated just within the doorway Torgul glanced back at him.\n\n\"You have your life and that of your man, stranger. Do not ask more of\nme, unless you have that within your hands to enforce the asking.\"\n\n\"I want nothing, save to be returned to where you took me, Captain.\"\n\nTorgul smiled grimly. \"You are the sea, you yourself said that. The sea\nis wide, but it is all one. Through it you must have your own paths.\nTake any you choose. But I do not risk my ship again into what lies in\nwait before the gates of the Foanna.\"\n\n\"Where do you go then, Captain?\"\n\n\"To Kyn Add. You have your own choice, stranger--the sea or our\nfairing.\"\n\nThere would be no way of changing the Rover's decision, Ross thought.\nAnd even with the gill-pack he could not swim back to where he had been\ntaken. There were no guideposts in the sea. But a longer acquaintance\nwith Torgul might be helpful.\n\n\"Kyn Add then, Captain.\" He made the next move to prove equality and\nestablish himself with this Rover, seating himself at the table as one\nwho had the right to share the Captain's quarters.\n\n\n\n\n10\n\nDeath at Kyn Add\n\n\nThe hour was close to dawn again and a need for sleep weighted Ross's\neyelids, was a craving as strong as hunger. Still restlessness had\nbrought him on deck, sent him to pacing, alert to this vessel and its\ncrew.\n\nHe had seen the ships of the Terran Bronze Age traders--small craft\ncompared to those of his own time, depending upon oarsmen when the wind\nfailed their sails, creeping along coasts rather than venturing too far\ninto dangerous seas, sometimes even tying up at the shore each night.\nThere had been other ships, leaner, hardier. Those had plunged into the\nunknown, touching lands beyond the sea mists, sailed and oared by men\nplagued by the need to learn what lay beyond the horizon.\n\nAnd here was such a ship, taut, well kept, larger than the Viking\nlongboats Ross had watched on the tapes of the Project's collection, yet\nmost like those far-faring Terran craft. The prow curved up in a mighty\nbowsprit where was the carved likeness of the sea dragon Ross had fought\nin the Hawaika of his own time. The eyes of that monster flashed with a\nregular blink of light which the Terran did not understand. Was it a\nsignal or merely a device to threaten a possible enemy?\n\nThere were sails, now furled as this ship bored on, answering to the\nsteady throb of what could only be an engine. And his puzzlement held. A\nViking longboat powered by motor? The mixture was incongruous.\n\nThe crew were uniform as to face. All of them wore the flexible pearly\narmor, the skull-strip helmets. Though there were individual differences\nin ornaments and the choice of weapons. The majority of the men did\ncarry curve-pointed swords, though those were broader and heavier than\nthose the Terran had seen ashore. But several had axes with\nsickle-shaped heads, whose points curved so far back that they nearly\nmet to form a circle.\n\nSpaced at regular intervals on deck were boxlike objects fronting what\nresembled gun ports. And smaller ones of the same type were on the\nraised deck at the stern and mounted in the prow, their muzzles, if the\nsquare fronts might be deemed muzzles, flanking the blinking dragon\nhead. Catapults of some type? Ross wondered.\n\n\"Rosss--\" His name was given the hiss Loketh used, but it was not the\nWrecker youth who joined him now at the stern of the ship. \"Ho ... that\nwas strong magic, that fighting knowledge of yours!\"\n\nVistur rubbed his chest reminiscently. \"You have big magic, sea man. But\nthen you serve the Maid, do you not? Your swordsman has told us that\neven the great fish understand and obey her.\"\n\n\"Some fish,\" qualified Ross.\n\n\"Such fish as that, perhaps?\" Vistur pointed to the curling wake of\nfoam.\n\nStartled, Ross stared in that direction. Torgul's command was the\ncentermost in a trio of ships, and those cruised in a line, leaving\nthree trails of troubled wave behind them. Coming up now to port in the\ncomparative calm between two wakes was a dark object. In the limited\nlight Ross could be sure of nothing save that it trailed the ships,\nappeared to rest on or only lightly in the water, and that its speed was\nless than that of the vessels it doggedly pursued.\n\n\"A fish--that?\" Ross asked.\n\n\"Watch!\" Vistur ordered.\n\nBut the Hawaikan's sight must have been keener than the Terran's. Had\nthere been a quick movement back there? Ross could not be sure.\n\n\"What happened?\" He turned to Vistur for enlightenment.\n\n\"As a salkar it leaps now and then above the surface. But that is no\nsalkar. Unless, Ross, you who say you are from the sea have servants\nunlike any finned one we have drawn in by net or line before this day.\"\n\nThe dolphins! Could Tino-rau or Taua or both be in steady pursuit of the\nships? But Karara ... Ross leaned against the rail, stared until his\neyes began to water from the strain of trying to make out the nature of\nthe black blot. No use, the distance was too great. He brought his fist\ndown against the wood, trying to control his impatience. More than half\nof him wanted to burst into Torgul's quarters, demand that the Captain\nbring the ship about to pick up or contact that trailer or trailers.\n\n\"Yours?\" again Vistur asked.\n\nRoss had tight rein on himself now. \"I do not know. It could well be.\"\n\nIt could well be also that the smart thing would be to encourage the\nRovers to believe that he had a force of sea dwellers much larger than\nthe four Time castaways. The leader of an army--or a navy--had more\nprestige in any truce discussion than a member of a lost scouting party.\nBut the thought that the dolphins could be trailing held both promise\nand worry--promise of allies, and worry over what had happened to\nKarara. Had she, too, disappeared after Ashe into the hold of the\nFoanna?\n\nThe day did not continue to lighten. Though there was no cottony mist as\nhad enclosed them the night before, there was an odd muting of sea and\nsky, limiting vision. Shortly Ross was unable to sight the follower or\nfollowers. Even Vistur admitted he had lost visual contact. Had the blot\nbeen hopelessly outdistanced, or was it still dogging the wakes of the\nRover ships?\n\nRoss shared the morning meal with Captain Torgul, a round of leathery\nsubstance with a salty, meaty flavor, and a thick mixture of what might\nbe native fruit reduced to a tart paste. Once before he had tasted alien\nfood when in the derelict spaceship it had meant eat or starve. And this\nwas a like circumstance, since their emergency ration supplies had been\nlost in the net. But though he was apprehensive, no ill effects\nfollowed. Torgul had been uncommunicative earlier; now he was looser of\ntongue, volunteering that they were almost to their port--the fairing of\nKyn Add.\n\nThe Terran had no idea how far he might question the Hawaikan, yet the\nfuller his information the better. He discovered that Torgul appeared\nwilling to accept Ross's statement that he was from a distant part of\nthe sea and that local customs differed from those he knew.\n\nLiving on and by the sea the Rovers were quick-witted, adaptive, with a\nhighly flexible if loose-knit organization of fleet-clans. Each of these\nhad control over certain islands which served them as \"fairings,\" ports\nfor refitting and anchorage between voyages, usually ruggedly wooded\nwhere the sea people could find the raw material for their ships.\nColonies of clans took to the sea, not in the slim, swift cruisers like\nthe ship Ross was now on, but in larger, deeper vessels providing living\nquarters and warehouses afloat. They lived by trade and raiding,\nspending only a portion of the year ashore to grow fast-sprouting crops\non their fairing islands and indulge in some manufacture of articles the\ninhabitants of the larger and more heavily populated islands were not\nable to duplicate.\n\nTheir main article of commerce was, however, a sea-dwelling creature\nwhose supple and well-tanned hide formed their defensive armor and\nserved manifold other uses. This could only be hunted by men trained and\nfearless enough to brave more than one danger Torgul did not explain in\ndetail. And a cargo of such skins brought enough in trade to keep a\nnormal-sized fleet-clan for a year.\n\nThere was warfare among them. Rival clans tried to jump each other's\nhunting territories, raid fairings. But until the immediate past, Ross\ngathered, such encounters were relatively bloodless affairs, depending\nmore upon craft and skillful planning to reduce the enemy to a position\nof disadvantage in which he was forced to acknowledge defeat, rather\nthan ruthless battle of no quarter.\n\nThe shore-side Wrecker lords were always considered fair game, and there\nwas no finesse in Rover raids upon them. Those were conducted with a\ncold-blooded determination to strike hard at a long-time foe. However,\nwithin the past year there had been several raids on fairings with the\nsame blood-bath result of a foray on a Wrecker port. And, since all the\nfleet-clans denied the sneak-and-strike, kill-and-destroy tactics which\nhad finished those Rover holdings, the seafarers were divided in their\nopinion as to whether the murderous raids were the work of Wreckers\nsuddenly acting out of character and taking to the sea to bring war back\nto their enemies, or whether there was a rogue fleet moving against\ntheir own kind for some purpose no Rover could yet guess.\n\n\"And you believe?\" Ross asked as Torgul finished his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the new\ndangers besetting his people.\n\nTorgul's hand, its long, slender fingers spidery to Terran eyes, rubbed\nback and forth across his chin before he answered:\n\n\"It is very hard for one who has fought them long to believe that\nsuddenly those shore rats are entrusting themselves to the waves,\nventuring out to stir us with their swords. One does not descend into\nthe depths to kick a salkar in the rump; not if one still has his wits\nsafely encased under his skull braid. As for a rogue fleet ... what\nwould turn brother against brother to the extent of slaying children and\nwomen? Raiding for a wife, yes, that is common among our youth. And\nthere have been killings over such matters. But not the killing of a\nwoman--never of a child! We are a people who have never as many women as\nthere are men who wish to bring them into the home cabin. And no clan\nhas as many children as they hope the Shades will send them.\"\n\n\"Then who?\"\n\nWhen Torgul did not answer at once Ross glanced at the Captain, and what\nthe Terran thought he saw showing for an instant in the other's eyes was\na revelation of danger. So much so that he blurted out:\n\n\"You think that I--we--\"\n\n\"You have named yourself of the sea, stranger, and you have magic which\nis not ours. Tell me this in truth: Could you not have killed Vistur\neasily with those two blows if you had wished it?\"\n\nRoss took the bold course. \"Yes, but I did not. My people kill no more\nwantonly than yours.\"\n\n\"The coast rats I know, and the Foanna, as well as any man may know\ntheir kind and ways, and my people--But you I do not know, sea stranger.\nAnd I say to you as I have said before, make me regret that I suffered\nyou to claim battle rights and I shall speedily correct that mistake!\"\n\n\"Captain!\"\n\nThat cry had come from the cabin door behind Ross. Torgul was on his\nfeet with the swift movements of a man called many times in the past for\nan instant response to emergency.\n\nThe Terran was close on the Rover's heels as they reached the deck. A\ncluster of crewmen gathered on the port side near the narrow bow. That\nodd misty quality this day held provided a murk hard to pierce, but the\nmen were gesturing at a low-riding object rolling with the waves.\n\nThat was near enough for even Ross to be able to distinguish a small\nboat akin to the one in which he, Karara, and Loketh had dared the sea\ngate of the Foanna.\n\nTorgul took up a great curved shell hanging by a thong on the mainmast.\nSetting its narrow end to his lips, he blew. A weird booming note, like\nthe coughing of a sea monster, carried over the waves. But there was no\nanswer from the drifting boat, no sign it carried any passengers.\n\n\"Hou, hou, hou--\" Torgul's signal was re-echoed by shell calls from the\nother two cruisers.\n\n\"Heave to!\" the Captain ordered. \"Wakti, Zimmon, Yoana--out and bring\nthat in!\"\n\nThree of the crew leaped to the railing, poised there for a moment, and\nthen dived almost as one into the water. A rope end was thrown, caught\nby one of them. And then they swam with powerful strokes toward the\ndrifting boat. Once the rope was made fast the small craft was drawn\ntoward Torgul's command, the crewmen swimming beside it. Ross longed to\nknow the reason for the tense expectancy of the men around him. It was\napparent the skiff had some ominous meaning for them.\n\nRoss caught a glimpse of a body huddled within the craft. Under Torgul's\norders a sling was dropped, to rise, weighted with a passenger. The\nTerran was shouldered back from the rail as the limp body was hurried\ninto the Captain's cabin. Several crewmen slid down to make an\nexamination of the boat itself.\n\nTheir heads came up, their eyes searched along the rail and centered on\nRoss. The hostility was so open the Terran braced himself to meet those\ncold stares as he would a rush from a challenger.\n\nA slight sound behind sent Ross leaping to the right, wanting to get his\nback against solid protection. Loketh came up, his limp making him\nawkward so that he clutched at the rail for support. In his other hand\nwas one of the hooked swords bared and ready.\n\n\"Get the murderers!\" Someone in the back line of the massing crew yipped\nthat.\n\nRoss drew his diver's knife. Shaken at this sudden change in the crew's\nattitude, he was warily on the defensive. Loketh was beside him now and\nthe Hawaikan nodded to the sea.\n\n\"Better go there,\" he cried. \"Over before they try to gut you!\"\n\n\"Kill!\" The word shrilled into a roar from the Rovers. They started up\nthe deck toward Ross and Loketh. Then someone leaped between, and Vistur\nfronted his own comrades.\n\n\"Stand away--\" One of the others ran forward, thrusting at the tall\nRover with a stiffened out-held arm to fend him out of their path.\n\nVistur rolled a shoulder, sending the fellow shunting away. He went down\nwhile two more, unable to halt, thudded on him. Vistur stamped on an\noutstretched hand and sent a sword spinning.\n\n\"What goes here!\" Torgul's demand was loud enough to be heard. It\nstopped a few of the crew and two more went down as the Captain struck\nout with his fists. Then he was facing Ross, and the chill in his eyes\nwas the threat the others had voiced.\n\n\"I told you, sea stranger, that if I found you were a danger to me or\nmine, you would meet the Justice of Phutka!\"\n\n\"You did,\" Ross returned. \"And in what way am I now a danger, Captain?\"\n\n\"Kyn Add has been taken by those who are not Wreckers, not Rovers, not\nthose who serve the Foanna--but strangers out of the sea!\"\n\nRoss could only stare back, confused. And then the full force of his\ndanger struck home. Who those raiding sea strangers could be, he had no\nidea, but that he was now condemned out of his own mouth was true and he\nrealized that these men were not going to listen to any argument from\nhim in their present state of mind.\n\nThe growl of the crew was that of a hungry animal. Ross saw the wisdom\nin Loketh's choice. Far better chance the open sea than the mob before\nthem.\n\nBut his time for choice had passed. Out of nowhere whirled a lacy\ngray-white net, slapping him back against a bulkhead to glue him there.\nRoss tried to twist loose, got his head around in time to see Loketh\nscramble to the top of the rail, turn as if to launch himself at the men\nspeeding for the now helpless Terran. But the Hawaikan's crippled leg\nfailed him and he toppled back overside.\n\n\"No!\" Again Torgul's shout halted the crew. \"He shall take the Black\nCurse with him when he goes to meet the Shadow--and only one can speak\nthat curse. Bring him!\"\n\nHelpless, reeling under their blows, dragged along, Ross was thrown into\nthe Captain's cabin, confronted by a figure braced up by coverings and\ncushions in Torgul's own chair.\n\nA woman, her face a drawn death's head of skin pulled tight upon bone,\nyet a fiery inner strength holding her mind above the suffering of her\nbody, looked at the Terran with narrowed eyes. She nursed a bandaged arm\nagainst her, and now and then her mouth quivered as if she could not\naltogether control some emotion or physical pain.\n\n\"Yours is the cursing, Lady Jazia. Make it heavy to bear for him as his\nkind has laid the burden of pain and remembering on all of us.\"\n\nShe brought her good hand up to her mouth, wiping its back across her\nlips as if to temper their quiver. And all the time her eyes held upon\nRoss.\n\n\"Why do you bring me this man?\" Her voice was strained, high. \"He is not\nof those who brought the Shadow to Kyn Add.\"\n\n\"What--?\" Torgul began and then schooled his voice to a more normal\ntone. \"Those were from the sea?\" He was gentle in his questioning. \"They\ncame out of the sea, using weapons against which we had no defense?\"\n\nShe nodded. \"Yes, they made very sure that only the dead remained. But I\nhad gone to the Shrine of Phutka, since it was my day of duty, and\nPhutka's power threw its shade over me. So I did not die, but I\nsaw--yes, I saw!\"\n\n\"Not those like me?\" Ross dared to speak to her directly.\n\n\"No, not those like you. There were few ... only so many--\" She spread\nout her five fingers. \"And they were all of one like as if born in one\nbirth. They had no hair on their heads, and their bodies were of this\nhue--\" She plucked at one of the coverings they had heaped around her;\nit was a lavender-blue mixture.\n\nRoss sucked in his breath, and Torgul was fast to pounce upon the\nunderstanding he read in the Terran's face.\n\n\"Not your kind--but still you know them!\"\n\n\"I know them,\" Ross agreed. \"They are the enemy!\"\n\nThe Baldies from the ancient spaceships, that wholly alien race with\nwhom he had once fought a desperate encounter on the edge of an unnamed\nsea in the far past of his own world. The galactic voyagers were\nhere--and in active, if secret, conflict with the natives!\n\n\n\n\n11\n\nWeapon from the Depths\n\n\nJazia told her story with an attention to time and detail which amazed\nRoss and won his admiration for her breed. She had witnessed the death\nand destruction of all which was her life, and yet she had the wit to\nnote and record mentally for possible future use all that she had been\nable to see of the raiders.\n\nThey had come out of the sea at dawn, walking with supreme confidence\nand lack of any fear. Axes flung when they did not reply to the\nsentries' challenges had never touched them, and a bombardment of\nheavier missiles had been turned aside. They proved invulnerable to any\nweapon the Rovers had. Men who made suicidal rushes to use sword or\nbattle ax hand-to-hand had fallen, before they were in striking\ndistance, under spraying tongues of fire from tubes the aliens carried.\n\nRovers were not fearful or easily cowed, but in the end they had fled\nfrom the five invaders, gone to ground in their halls, tried to reach\ntheir beached ships, only to die as they ran and hid. The slaughter had\nbeen remorseless and entire, leaving Jazia in the hill shrine as the\nonly survivor. She had hidden for the rest of the day, seen the killing\nof a few fugitives, and that night had stolen to the shore, launched one\nof the ship's boats which was in a cove well away from the main harbor\nof the fairing, heading out to sea in hope of meeting the homing\ncruisers with her warning.\n\n\"They stayed there on the island?\" Ross asked. That point of her story\npuzzled him. If the object of that murderous raid had been only to stir\nup trouble among the Hawaikan Rovers, perhaps turning one clan against\nthe other, as he had deduced when he had listened to Torgul's report of\nsimilar happenings, then the star men should have withdrawn as soon as\ntheir mission was complete, leaving the dead to call for vengeance in\nthe wrong direction. There would be no reason to court discovery of\ntheir true identity by lingering.\n\n\"When the boat was asea there were still lights at the fairing hall, and\nthey were not our lights, nor did the dead carry them,\" she said slowly.\n\"What have those to fear? They can not be killed!\"\n\n\"If they are still there, that we can put to the test,\" Torgul replied\ngrimly, and a murmur from his officers bore out his determination.\n\n\"And lose all the rest of you?\" Ross retorted coldly. \"I have met these\nbefore; they can will a man to obey them. Look you--\" He slammed his\nleft hand flat on the table. The ridges of scar tissue were plain\nagainst his tanned skin. He knew no better way of driving home the\ndangers of dealing with the star men than providing this graphic\nexample. \"I held my own hand in fire so that the hurt of it would work\nagainst their pull upon my thoughts, against their willing that I come\nand be easy meat for their butchering.\"\n\nJazia's fingers flickered out, smoothed across his old scars lightly as\nshe gazed into his eyes.\n\n\"This, too, is true,\" she said slowly. \"For it was also pain of body\nwhich kept me from their last snare. They stood by the hall and I saw\nPrahad, Okun, Mosaji, come out to them to be killed as if they were in a\nhold net and were drawn. And there was that which called me also so that\nI would go to them though I called upon the Power of Phutka to save. And\nthe answer to that plea came in a strange way, for I fell as I went from\nthe shrine and cut my arm on the rocks. The pain of that hurt was as a\nknife severing the net. Then I crawled for the wood and that calling did\nnot come again--\"\n\n\"If you know so much about them, tell us what weapons we may use to pull\nthem down!\" That demand came from Vistur.\n\nRoss shook his head. \"I do not know.\"\n\n\"Yet,\" Jazia mused, \"all things which live must also die sooner or\nlater. And it is in my mind that these have also a fate they dread and\nfear. Perhaps we may find and use it.\"\n\n\"They came from the sea--by a ship, then?\" Ross asked. She shook her\nhead.\n\n\"No, there was no ship; they came walking through the breaking waves as\nif they had followed some road across the sea bottom.\"\n\n\"A sub!\"\n\n\"What is that?\" Torgul demanded.\n\n\"A type of ship which goes under the waves, not through them, carrying\nair within its hull for the breathing of the crew.\"\n\nTorgul's eyes narrowed. One of the other captains who had been summoned\nfrom the two companion cruisers gave a snort of disbelief.\n\n\"There are no such ships--\" he began, to be silenced by a gesture from\nTorgul.\n\n\"We know of no such ships,\" the other corrected. \"But then we know of no\nsuch devices as Jazia saw in operation either. How does one war upon\nthese under-the-seas ships, Ross?\"\n\nThe Terran hesitated. To describe to men who knew nothing of explosives\nthe classic way of dealing with a sub via depth charges was close to\nimpossible. But he did his best.\n\n\"Among my people one imprisons in a container a great power. Then the\ncontainer is dropped near the sub and--\"\n\n\"And how,\" broke in the skeptical captain, \"do you know where such a\nship lies? Can you see it through the water?\"\n\n\"In a way--not see, but hear. There is a machine which makes for the\ncaptain of the above-seas ship a picture of where the sub lies or moves\nso that he may follow its course. Then when he is near enough he drops\nthe container and the power breaks free--to also break apart the sub.\"\n\n\"Yet the making of such containers and the imprisoning of the power\nwithin them,\" Torgul said, \"this is the result of a knowledge which is\ngreater than any save the Foanna may possess. You do not have it?\" His\nconclusion was half statement, half question.\n\n\"No. It took many years and the combined knowledge of many men among my\npeople to make such containers, such a listening device. I do not have\nit.\"\n\n\"Why then think of what we do not have?\" Torgul's return was decisive.\n\"What _do_ we have?\"\n\nRoss's head came up. He was listening, not to anything in that cabin,\nbut to a sound which had come through the port just behind his head.\nThere--it had come again! He was on his feet.\n\n\"What--?\" Vistur's hand hovered over the ax at his belt. Ross saw their\ngaze centered on him.\n\n\"We may have reinforcements now!\" The Terran was already on his way to\nthe deck.\n\nHe hurried to the rail and whistled, the thin, shrill summons he had\npracticed for weeks before he had ever begun this fantastic adventure.\n\nA sleek dark body broke water and the dolphin grin was exposed as\nTino-rau answered his call. Though Ross's communication powers with the\ntwo finned scouts was very far from Karara's, he caught the message in\npart and swung around to face the Rovers who had crowded after him.\n\n\"We have a way now of learning more about your enemies.\"\n\n\"A boat--it comes without sail or oars!\" One of the crew pointed.\n\nRoss waved vigorously, but no hand replied from the skiff. Though it\ncame steadily onward, the three cruisers its apparent goal.\n\n\"Karara!\" Ross called.\n\nThen side by side with Tino-rau were two wet heads, two masked faces\nshowing as the swimmers trod water--Karara and Loketh.\n\n\"Drop ropes!\" Ross gave that order as if he rather than Torgul\ncommanded. And the Captain himself was one of those who moved to obey.\n\nLoketh came out of the sea first and as he scrambled over the rail he\nhad his sword ready, looking from Ross to Torgul. The Terran held up\nempty hands and smiled.\n\n\"No trouble now.\"\n\nLoketh snapped up his mask. \"So the Sea Maid said the finned ones\nreported. Yet before, these thirsted for your blood on their blades.\nWhat magic have you worked?\"\n\n\"None. Just the truth has been discovered.\" Ross reached for Karara's\nhand as she came nimbly up the rope, swung her across the rail to the\ndeck where she stood unmasked, brushing back her hair and looking around\nwith a lively curiosity.\n\n\"Karara, this is Captain Torgul,\" Ross introduced the Rover commander\nwho was staring round-eyed at the girl. \"Karara is she who swims with\nthe finned ones, and they obey her.\" Ross gestured to Tino-rau. \"It is\nTaua who brings the skiff?\" he asked the Polynesian.\n\nShe nodded. \"We followed from the gate. Then Loketh came and said that\n... that....\" She paused and then added, \"But you do not seem to be in\ndanger. What has happened?\"\n\n\"Much. Listen--this is important. There is trouble at an island ahead.\nThe Baldies were there; they murdered the kin of these men. The odds are\nthey reached there by some form of sub. Send one of the dolphins to see\nwhat is happening and if they are still there....\"\n\nKarara asked no more questions, but whistled to the dolphin. With a flip\nof tail Tino-rau took off.\n\nSince they could make no concrete plan of action, the cruiser captains\nagreed to wait for Tino-rau's report and to cruise well out of sight of\nthe fairing harbor until it came.\n\n\"This belief in magic,\" Ross remarked to Karara, \"has one advantage. The\nnatives seem able to take in their stride the fact the dolphins will\nscout for us.\"\n\n\"They have lived their lives on the sea; for it they must have a vast\nrespect. Perhaps they know, as did my people, that the ocean has many\nsecrets, some of which are never revealed except to the forms of life\nwhich claim their homes there. But, even if you discover this Baldy sub,\nwhat will the Rovers be able to do about it?\"\n\n\"I don't know--yet.\" Ross could not tell why he clung to the idea that\nthey could do anything to strike back at the superior alien force. He\nonly knew that he was not yet willing to relinquish the thought that in\nsome way they could.\n\n\"And Ashe?\"\n\nYes, Ashe....\n\n\"I don't know.\" It hurt Ross to admit that.\n\n\"Back there, what really happened at the gate?\" he asked Karara. \"All at\nonce the dolphins seemed to go crazy.\"\n\n\"I think for a moment or two they did. You felt nothing?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"It was like a fire slashing through the head. Some protective device of\nthe Foanna, I think.\"\n\nA mental defense to which he was not sensitive. Which meant that he\nmight be able to breach that gate if none of the others could. But he\nhad to be there first. Suppose, just suppose Torgul could be persuaded\nthat this attack on the gutted Kyn Add was useless. Would the Rover\ncommander take them back to the Foanna keep? Or with the dolphins and\nthe skiff could Ross himself return to make the try?\n\nThat he could make it on his own, Ross doubted. Excitement and will\npower had buoyed him up throughout the past Hawaikan day and night. Now\nfatigue closed in, past his conditioning and the built-in stimulant of\nthe Terran rations, to enclose him in a groggy haze. He had been warned\nagainst this reaction, but that was just another item he had pushed out\nof his conscious mind. The last thing he remembered now was seeing\nKarara move through a fuzzy cloud.\n\nVoices argued somewhere beyond, the force of that argument carried more\nby tone than any words Ross could understand. He was pulled sluggishly\nout of a slumber too deep for any dream to trouble, and lifted heavy\neyelids to see Karara once again. There was a prick in his arm--or was\nthat part of the unreality about him?\n\n\"--four--five--six--\" she was counting, and Ross found himself joining\nin:\n\n\"--seven--eight--nine--ten!\"\n\nOn reaching \"ten\" he was fully awake and knew that she had applied the\nemergency procedure they had been drilled in using, giving him a pep\nshot. When Ross sat up on the narrow bunk there was a light in the cabin\nand no sign of day outside the porthole. Torgul, Vistur, the two other\ncruiser captains, all there ... and Jazia.\n\nRoss swung his feet to the deck. A pep-shot headache was already\nbeginning, but would wear off soon. There was, however, a concentration\nof tension in the cabin, and something must have driven Karara to use\nthe drug.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\nKarara fitted the medical kit into the compact carrying case.\n\n\"Tino-rau has returned. There _is_ a sub in the bay. It emits energy\nwaves on a shoreward beam.\"\n\n\"Then they are still there.\" Ross accepted the dolphin's report without\nquestion. Neither of the scouts would make a mistake in those matters.\nEnergy waves beamed shoreward--power for some type of unit the Baldies\nwere using? Suppose the Rovers could find a way of cutting off the\npower.\n\n\"The Sea Maid has told us that this ship sits on the bottom of the\nharbor. If we could board it--\" began Torgul.\n\n\"Yes!\" Vistur brought his fist down against the end of the bunk on which\nthe Terran still sat, jarring the dull, drug-borne pain in Ross's head.\n\"Take it--then turn it against its crew!\"\n\nThere was an eagerness in all Rover faces. For that was a game the\nHawaikan seafarers understood: Take an enemy ship and turn its armament\nagainst its companions in a fleet. But that plan would not work out.\nRoss had a healthy respect for the technical knowledge of the galactic\ninvaders. Of course he, Karara, even Loketh might be able to reach the\nsub. Whether they could then board her was an entirely different matter.\n\nNow the Polynesian girl shook her head. \"The broadcast there--Tino-rau\nrates it as lethal. There are dead fish floating in the bay. He had\nwarning at the reef entrance. Without a shield, there will be no way of\ngetting in.\"\n\n\"Might as well wish for a depth bomb,\" Ross began and then stopped.\n\n\"You have thought of something?\"\n\n\"A shield--\" Ross repeated her words. It was so wild this thought of\nhis, and one which might have no chance of working. He knew almost\nnothing about the resources of the invaders. Could that broadcast which\nprotected the sub and perhaps activated the weapons of the invaders\nashore be destroyed? A wall of fish--sea life herded in there as a\nshield ... wild, yes, even so wild it might work. Ross outlined the\nidea, speaking more to Karara than to the Rovers.\n\n\"I do not know,\" she said doubtfully. \"That would need many fish, too\nmany to herd and drive----\"\n\n\"Not fish,\" Torgul cut in, \"salkars!\"\n\n\"Salkars?\"\n\n\"You have seen the bow carving on this ship. That is a salkar. Such are\nlarger than a hundred fish! Salkars driven in ... they might even wreck\nthis undersea ship with their weight and anger.\"\n\n\"And you can find these salkars near-by?\" Ross began to take fire. That\ndragon which had hunted him--the bulk of the thing was well above any\nother sea life he had seen here. And to its ferocity he could give\ntestimony.\n\n\"At the spawning reefs. We do not hunt at this season which is the time\nof the taking of mates. Now, too, they are easily angered so they will\neven attack a cruiser. To slay them at present is a loss, for their\nskins are not good. But they would be ripe for battle were they to be\ndisturbed.\"\n\n\"And how would you get them from the spawning reefs to Kyn Add?\"\n\n\"That is not too difficult; the reef lies here.\" Torgul drew lines with\nthe point of his sword on the table top. \"And here is Kyn Add. Salkars\nhave a great hunger at this time. Show them bait and they will follow;\nespecially will they follow swimming bait.\"\n\nThere were a great many holes in the plan which had only a halfway\nchance of working. But the Rovers seized upon it with enthusiasm, and so\nit was set up.\n\nPerhaps some two hours later Ross swam toward the land mass of Kyn Add.\nGleams of light pricked on the shore well to his left. Those must mark\nthe Rover settlement. And again the Terran wondered why the invaders had\nremained there. Unless they knew that there had been three cruisers out\non a raid and for some reason they were determined to make a complete\nmop-up.\n\nKarara moved a little to his right, Taua between them, the dolphin's\nsuper senses their guide and warning. The swiftest of the cruisers had\ndeparted, Loketh on board to communicate with Tino-rau in the water.\nSince the male dolphin was the best equipped to provide a fox for salkar\nhounds, he was the bait for this weird fishing expedition.\n\n\"No farther!\" Ross's sonic pricked a warning against his body. Through\nthat he took a jolt which sent him back, away from the bay entrance.\n\n\"On the reef.\" Karara's tapped code drew him on a new course. Moments\nlater they were both out of the water, though the wash of waves over\ntheir flippered feet was constant. The rocks among which they crouched\nwere a rough harborage from which they could see the shore as a dark\nblot. But they were well away from the break in the reef through which,\nif their outlandish plan succeeded, the salkars would come.\n\n\"A one-in-a-million chance!\" Ross commented as he put up his mask.\n\n\"Was not the whole Time Agent project founded on just such chances?\"\nKarara asked the right question. This was Ross's kind of venture. Yes,\none-in-a-million chances had been pulled off by the Time Agents. Why, it\nhad been close to those odds against their ever finding what they had\nfirst sought along the back trails of time--the wrecked spaceships.\n\nJust suppose this could be a rehearsal for another attack? If the\nsalkars could be made to crack the guard of the Baldies, could they also\nbe used against the Foanna gate? Maybe.... But take one fight at a time.\n\n\"They come!\" Karara's fingers gripped Ross's shoulder. Her hand was\nhard, bar rigid. He could see nothing, hear nothing. That warning must\nhave come from the dolphins. But so far their plan was working; the\nmonsters of the Hawaikan sea were on their way.\n\n\n\n\n12\n\nBaldies\n\n\n\"Ohhhh!\" Karara clutched at Ross, her breath coming in little gasps,\ngiving vent to her fear and horror. They had not known what might come\nfrom this plan; certainly neither had foreseen the present chaos in the\nlagoon.\n\nPerhaps the broadcast energy of the enemy whipped the already\nvicious-tempered salkars into this insane fury. But now the moonlit\nwater was beaten into foam as the creatures fought there, attacking each\nother with a ferocity neither Terran had witnessed before.\n\nLights gleamed along the shore where the alien invaders must have been\ndrawn by the clamor of the fighting marine reptiles. Somewhere in the\nheights above the beach of the lagoon a picked band of Rovers should now\nbe making their way from the opposite side of Kyn Add under strict\norders not to go into attack unless signaled. Whether the independent\nsea warriors would hold to that command was a question which had worried\nRoss from the first.\n\nTino-rau and Taua in the waters to the seaward of the reef, the two\nTerrans on that barrier itself, and between them and the shore the wild\nmelee of maddened salkars. Ross started. The sonic warning which had\nbeen pulsing steadily against his skin cut off sharply. The broadcast in\nthe bay had been silenced! This was the time to move, but no swimmer\ncould last in the lagoon itself.\n\n\"Along the reef,\" Karara said.\n\nThat would be the long way round, Ross knew, but the only one possible.\nHe studied the cluster of lights ashore. Two or three figures moved\nthere. Seemingly the attention of the aliens was well centered upon the\nbattle still in progress in the lagoon.\n\n\"Stay here!\" he ordered the girl. Adjusting his mask, Ross dropped into\nthe water, cutting away from the reef and then turning to swim parallel\nwith it. Tino-rau matched him as he went, guiding Ross to a second break\nin the reef, toward the shore some distance from where the conflict of\nthe salkars still made a hideous din in the night.\n\nThe Terran waded in the shallows, stripping off his flippers and\nsnapping them to his belt, letting his mask swing free on his chest. He\nangled toward the beach where the aliens had been. At least he was\nbetter armed for this than he had been when he had fronted the Rovers\nwith only a diver's knife. From the Time Agent supplies he had taken the\nsingle hand weapon he had long ago found in the armory of the derelict\nspaceship. This could only be used sparingly, since they did not know\nhow it could be recharged, and the secret of its beam still remained\nsecret as far as Terran technicians were concerned.\n\nRoss worked his way to a curtain of underbrush from which he had a free\nview of the beach and the aliens. Three of them he counted, and they\nwere Baldies, all right--taller and thinner than his own species, their\nbald heads gray-white, the upper dome of their skulls overshadowing the\nfeatures on their pointed chinned faces. They all wore the skintight\nblue-purple-green suits of the space voyagers--suits which Ross knew of\nold were insulated and protective for their wearers, as well as a medium\nfor keeping in touch with one another. Just as he, wearing one, had once\nbeen trailed over miles of wilderness.\n\nTo him, all three of the invaders looked enough alike to have been\nstamped out from one pattern. And their movements suggested that they\nworked or went into action with drilled precision. They all faced\nseaward, holding tubes aimed at the salkar-infested lagoon. There was no\nsound of any explosion, but green spears of light struck at the scaled\nbodies plunging in the water. And where those beams struck, flesh\nseared. Methodically the trio raked the basin. But, Ross noted, those\nbeams which had been steady at his first sighting, were now interrupted\nby flickers. One of the Baldies upended his tube, rapped its butt\nagainst a rock as if trying to correct a jamming. When the alien went\ninto action once again his weapon flashed and failed. Within a matter of\nmoments the other two were also finished. The lighted rods pushed into\nthe sand, giving a glow to the scene, darkened as a fire might sink to\nembers. Power fading?\n\nAn ungainly shape floundered out of the churned water, lumbered over the\nshale of the beach, its supple neck outstretched, its horned nose down\nfor a gore-threatening charge. Ross had not realized that the salkars\ncould operate out of what he thought was their natural element, but this\nwild-eyed dragon was plainly bent on reaching its tormentors.\n\nFor a moment or two the Baldies continued to front the creature, almost,\nRoss thought, as if they could not believe that their weapons had failed\nthem. Then they broke and ran back to the fairing which they had taken\nwith such contemptuous ease. The salkar plowed along in their wake, but\nits movements grew more labored the farther it advanced, until at last\nit lay with only its head upraised, darting it back and forth, its\nfanged jaws well agape, voicing a coughing howl.\n\nIts plaint was answered from the water as a second of its kind wallowed\nashore. A terrible wound had torn skin and flesh just behind its neck;\nyet still it came on, hissing and bubbling a battle challenge. It did\nnot attack its fellow; instead it dragged its bulk past the first comer,\non its way after the Baldies.\n\nThe salkars continued to come ashore, two more, a third, a fourth,\nmangled and torn--pulling themselves as far as they could up the beach.\nTo lie, facing inland, their necks weaving, their horned heads bobbing,\ntheir cries a frightful din. What had drawn them out of their\npreoccupation of battle among themselves into this attempt to reach the\naliens, Ross could not determine. Unless the intelligence of the beasts\nwas such that they had been able to connect the searing beams which the\nBaldies had turned on them so tellingly with the men on the beach, and\nhad responded by striving to reach a common enemy.\n\nBut no desire could give them the necessary energy to pull far ashore.\nAlmost helplessly beached, they continued to dig into the yielding sand\nwith their flippers in a vain effort to pursue the aliens.\n\nRoss skirted the clamoring barrier of salkars and headed for the\nfairing. A neck snapped about; a head was lowered in his direction. He\nsmelled the rank stench of reptile combined with burned flesh. The\nnearest of the brutes must have scented the Terran in turn, as it was\nnow trying vainly to edge around to cut across Ross's path. But it was\ncompletely outclassed on land, and the man dodged it easily.\n\nThree Baldies had fled this way. Yet Jazia had reported five had come\nout of the sea to take Kyn Add. Two were missing. Where? Had they\nremained in the fairing? Were they now in the sub? And that sub--what\nhad happened to it? The broadcast had been cut off; he had seen the\nfailure of the weapons and the shore lights. Might the sub have suffered\nfrom salkar attack? Though Ross could hardly believe that the beasts\ncould wreck it.\n\nThe Terran was traveling blindly, keeping well under cover of such brush\nas he could, knowing only that he must head inland. Under his feet the\nground was rising, and he recalled the nature of this territory as\nTorgul and Jazia had pictured it for him. This had to be part of the\nridge wall of the valley in which lay the buildings of the fairing. In\nthese heights was the Shrine of Phutka where Jazia had hidden out. To\nthe west now lay the Rover village, so he had to work his way left,\ndownhill, in order to reach the hole where the Baldies had gone to\nground. Ross made that progress with the stealth of a trained scout.\n\nHawaika's moon, triple in size to Terra's companion, was up, and the\nlandscape was sharply clear, with shadows well defined. The glow, weird\nto Terran eyes, added to the effect of being abroad in a nightmare, and\nthe bellowing of the grounded salkars continued a devils' chorus.\n\nWhen the Rovers had put up the buildings of their fairing, they had\ncleared a series of small fields radiating outward from those\nstructures. All of these were now covered with crops almost ready to\nharvest. The grain, if that Terran term could be applied to this\nHawaikan product, was housed in long pods which dipped from\nshoulder-high bushes. And the pods were well equipped with horny\nprojections which tore. A single try at making his way into one of those\nfields convinced Ross of the folly of such an advance. He sat back to\nnurse his scratched hands and survey the landscape.\n\nTo go down a very tempting lane would be making himself a clear target\nfor anyone in those buildings ahead. He had seen the flamers of the\nBaldies fail on the beach, but that did not mean the aliens were now\nweaponless.\n\nHis best chance, Ross decided, was to circle north, come back down along\nthe bed of a stream. And he was at the edge of that watercourse when a\nfaint sound brought him to a frozen halt, weapon ready.\n\n\"Rosss--\"\n\n\"Loketh!\"\n\n\"And Torgul and Vistur.\"\n\nThis was the party from the opposite side of the island, gone expertly\nto earth. In the moonlight Ross could detect no sign of their presence,\nyet their voices sounded almost beside him.\n\n\"They are in there, in the great hall.\" That was Torgul. \"But no longer\nare there any lights.\"\n\n\"Now--\" An urgent exclamation drew their attention.\n\nLight below. But not the glow of the rods Ross had seen on the beach.\nThis was the warm yellow-red of honest fire, bursting up, the flames\ngrowing higher as if being fed with frantic haste.\n\nThree figures were moving down there. Ross began to believe that there\nwere only this trio ashore. He could sight no weapons in their hands,\nwhich did not necessarily mean they were unarmed. But the stream ran\nclose behind the rear wall of one of the buildings, and Ross thought its\nbed could provide cover for a man who knew what he was doing. He pointed\nout as much to Torgul.\n\n\"And if their magic works and you are drawn out to be killed?\" The Rover\ncaptain came directly to the point.\n\n\"That is a chance to be taken. But remember ... the magic of the Foanna\nat the sea gate did not work against me. Perhaps this won't either.\nOnce, earlier, I won against it.\"\n\n\"Have you then another hand to give to the fire as your defense?\" That\nwas Vistur. \"But no man has the right to order another's battle\nchallenge.\"\n\n\"Just so,\" returned Ross sharply. \"And this is a thing I have long been\ntrained to do.\"\n\nHe slid down into the stream bed. Approaching from this angle, the\nstructures of the fairing were between him and the fire. So screened he\nreached a log wall, got to his feet, and edged along it. Then he\nwitnessed a wild scene. The fire raged in great, sky-touching tongues.\nAnd already the roof of one of the Rover buildings smoldered. Why the\naliens had built up such a conflagration, Ross could not guess. A signal\ndesigned to reach some distance?\n\nHe did not doubt there was some urgent purpose. For the three were\ndragging in fuel with almost frenzied haste, bringing out of the Rover\nbuildings bales of cloth to be ripped apart and whirled into the\ndevouring flames, furniture, everything movable which would burn.\n\nThere was one satisfaction. The Baldies were so intent upon this\ndestruction that they kept no watch save that now and then one of them\nwould run to the head of the path leading to the lagoon and listen as if\nhe expected a salkar to come pounding up the slope.\n\n\"They're ... they're rattled!\" Ross could hardly believe it. The Baldies\nwho had always occupied his mind and memory as practically invincible\nsupermen were acting like badly frightened primitives! And when the\nenemy was so off balance you pushed--you pushed hard.\n\nRoss thumbed the button on the grip of the strange weapon. He sighted\nwith deliberation and fired. The blue figure at the top of the path\nwilted, and for a long moment neither of his companions noted his\ncollapse. Then one of them whirled and started for the limp body, his\ncolleague running after him. Ross allowed them to reach his first victim\nbefore he fired the second and third time.\n\nAll three lay quiet, but still Ross did not venture forth until he had\ncounted off a dozen Terran seconds. Then he slipped forward keeping to\ncover until he came up to the bodies.\n\nThe blue-clad shoulder had a flaccid feel under his hand as if the\nmuscles could not control the flesh about them. Ross rolled the alien\nover, looked down in the bright light of the fire into the Baldy's\nwide-open eyes. Amazement--the Terran thought he could read that in the\ndead stare which answered his intent gaze--and then anger, a cold and\ndeadly anger which chilled into ice.\n\n\"Kill!\"\n\nRoss slewed around, still down on one knee, to face the charge of a\nRover. In the firelight the Hawaikan's eyes were blazing with fanatical\nhatred. He had his hooked sword ready to deliver a finishing stroke. The\nTerran blocked with a shoulder to meet the Rover's knees, threw him\nback. Then Ross landed on top of the fighting crewman, trying to pin the\nfellow to earth and avoid that recklessly slashing blade.\n\n\"Loketh! Vistur!\" Ross shouted as he struggled.\n\nMore of the Rovers appeared from between the buildings, bearing down on\nthe limp aliens and the two fighting men. Ross recognized the limping\ngait of Loketh using a branch to aid him into a running scuttle across\nthe open.\n\n\"Loketh--here!\"\n\nThe Hawaikan covered the last few feet in a dive which carried him into\nRoss and the Rover. \"Hold him,\" the Terran ordered and had just time\nenough to throw himself between the Baldies and the rest of the crew.\nThere was a snarling from the Rovers; and Ross, knowing their temper,\nwas afraid he could not save the captives which they considered, fairly,\ntheir legitimate prey. He must depend upon the hope that there were one\nor two cooler heads among them with enough authority to restrain the\nwould-be avengers. Otherwise he would have to beam them into\nhelplessness.\n\n\"Torgul!\" he shouted.\n\nThere was a break in the line of runners speeding for him. The big man\nlunging straight across could only be Vistur; the other, yelling orders,\nwas Torgul. It would depend upon how much control the Captain had over\nhis men. Ross scrambled to his feet. He had clicked on the beamer to its\nlowest frequency. It would not kill, but would render its victim\ntemporarily paralyzed; and how long that state would continue Ross had\nno way of knowing. Tried on Terran laboratory animals, the time had\nvaried from days to weeks.\n\nVistur used the flat side of his war ax, clapping it against the\nforemost runners, setting his own bulk to impose a barrier. And now\nTorgul's orders appeared to be getting through, more and more of the men\nslacked, leaving a trio of hotheads, two of whom Vistur sent reeling\nwith his fists.\n\nThe Captain came up to Ross. \"They are alive then?\" He leaned over to\ninspect the Baldy the Terran had rolled on his back, assessing the\nalien's frozen stare with thoughtful measurement.\n\n\"Yes, but they can not move.\"\n\n\"Well enough.\" Torgul nodded. \"They shall meet the Justice of Phutka\nafter the Law. I think they will wish that they had been left to the\nboarding axes of angry men.\"\n\n\"They are worth more alive than dead, Captain. Do you not wish to know\nwhy they have carried war to your people, how many of them there may yet\nbe to attack--and other things? Also--\" Ross nodded at the fire now\ncatching the second building, \"why have they built up that blaze? Is it\na signal to others of their kind?\"\n\n\"Very well said. Yes, it would be well for us to learn such things. Nor\nwill Phutka be jealous of the time we take to ask questions and get\nanswers, many answers.\" He prodded the Baldy with the toe of his sea\nboot.\n\n\"How long will they remain so? Your magic has a bite in it.\"\n\nRoss smiled. \"Not my magic, Captain. This weapon was taken from one of\ntheir own ships. As to how long they will remain so--that I do not\nknow.\"\n\n\"Very well, we can take precautions.\" Under Torgul's orders the aliens\nwere draped with capture nets like those Ross and Loketh had worn. The\nsea-grown plant adhered instantly, wet strands knitting in perfect\nrestrainers as long as it was uncut.\n\nHaving seen to that, Torgul ordered the excavation of Kyn Add.\n\n\"As you say,\" he remarked to Ross, \"that fire may well be a signal to\nbring down more of their kind. I think we have had the Favor of Phutka\nin this matter, but the prudent man stretches no favor of that kind too\nfar. Also,\" he looked about him--\"we have given to Phutka and the Shades\nour dead; there is nothing for us here now but hate and sorrow. In one\nday we have been broken from a clan of pride and ships to a handful of\nstandardless men.\"\n\n\"You will join some other clan?\" Karara had come with Jazia to stand on\nthe stone ledge chipped to form a base for a column bearing a strange,\nbrooding-eyed head looking seaward. The Rover woman was superintending\nthe freeing of the head from the column.\n\nAt the Terran girl's question the Captain gazed down into the dreadful\nchaos of the valley. They could yet hear the roars of the dying salkars.\nThe reptiles that had made their way to land had not withdrawn but still\nlay, some dead now, some with weaving heads reaching inland. And the\nwhole of the fairing was ablaze with fire.\n\n\"We are now blood-sworn men, Sea Maid. For such there is no clan. There\nis only the hunting and the kill. With the magic of Phutka perhaps we\nshall have a short hunt and a good kill.\"\n\n\"There ... now ... so....\" Jazia stepped back. The head which had faced\nthe sea was lowered carefully to a wide strip of crimson-and-gold stuff\nshe had brought from Torgul's ship. With her one usable hand the Rover\nwoman drew the fabric about the carving, muffling it except for the\neyes. Those were large ovals deeply carved, and in them Ross saw a\nglitter. Jewels set there? Yet, he had a queer, shivery feeling that\nsomething more than gems occupied those sockets--that he had actually\nbeen regarded for an instant of time, assessed and dismissed.\n\n\"We go now.\" Jazia waved and Torgul sent men forward. They lifted the\nwrapped carving to a board carried between them and started downslope.\n\nKarara cried out and Ross looked around.\n\nThe pillar which had supported the head was crumbling away, breaking\ninto a rubble which cascaded across the stone ledge. Ross blinked--this\nmust be an illusion, but he was too tired to be more than dully amazed\nas he became one of the procession returning to the ships.\n\n\n\n\n13\n\nThe Sea Gate of the Foanna\n\n\nRoss raised a shell cup to his lips but hardly sipped the fiery brew it\ncontained. This was a gesture of ceremony, but he wanted a steady head\nand a quick tongue for any coming argument. Torgul, Afrukta, Ongal--the\nthree commanders of the Rover cruisers; Jazia, who represented the\nmysterious Power of Phutka; Vistur and some other subordinate officers;\nKarara; himself, with Loketh hovering behind: a council of war. But\nsummoned against whom?\n\nThe Terran had come too far afield from his own purpose--to reach Ashe\nin the Foanna keep. And to further his own plans was a task he doubted\nhis ability to perform. His attack on the Baldies had made him too\nimportant to the Rovers for them to allow him willingly to leave them on\na quest of his own.\n\n\"These star men\"--Ross set down the cup, tried to choose the most\ntelling words in his limited Hawaikan vocabulary--\"possess weapons and\npowers you can not dream of, that you have no defense against. Back at\nKyn Add we were lucky. The salkars attacked their sub and halted the\nbroadcast powering their flamers. Otherwise we could not have taken\nthem, even though we were many against their few. Now you talk of\nhunting them in their own territory--on land and in the mountains where\nthey have their base. That would be folly akin to swimming barehanded to\nfront a salkar.\"\n\n\"So--then we must sit and wait for them to eat us up?\" flared Ongal. \"I\nsay it is better to die fighting with one's blade wet!\"\n\n\"Do you not also wish to take at least one of the enemy with you when\nyou fight to that finish?\" Ross countered. \"These could kill you before\nyou came in blade range.\"\n\n\"You had no trouble with that weapon of yours,\" Afrukta spoke up.\n\n\"I have told you--this weapon was stolen from them. I have only one and\nI do not know how long it will continue to serve me, or whether they\nhave a defense against it. Those we took were naked to any force, for\ntheir broadcast had failed them. But to smash blindly against their main\nbase would be the act of madmen.\"\n\n\"The salkars opened a way for us--\" That was Torgul.\n\n\"But we can not move a pack of those inland to the mountains,\" Vistur\npointed out reasonably.\n\nRoss studied the Captain. That Torgul was groping for a plan and that it\nhad to be a shrewd one, the Terran guessed. His respect for the Rover\ncommander had been growing steadily since their first meeting. The\ncruiser-raiders had always been captained by the most daring men of the\nRover clans. But Ross was also certain that a successful cruiser\ncommander must possess a level-headed leaven of intelligence and be a\nstrategist of parts.\n\nThe Hawaikan force needed a key which would open the Baldy base as the\nsalkars had opened the lagoon. And all they had to aid them was a\nhandful of facts gained from their prisoners.\n\nOddly enough the picklock to the captives' minds had been produced by\nthe dolphins. Just as Tino-rau and Taua had formed a bridge of\ncommunication between the Terran and Loketh, so did they read and\ntranslate the thoughts of the galactic invaders. For the Baldies, among\ntheir own kind, were telepathic, vocalizing only to give orders to\ninferiors.\n\nTheir capture by these primitive \"inferiors\" had delivered the first\nshock, and the mind-probes of the dolphins had sent the \"supermen\" close\nto the edge of sanity. To accept an animal form as an equal had been\nshattering.\n\nBut the star men's thoughts and memories had been winnowed at last and\nthe result spread before this impromptu council. Rovers and Terrans were\nbriefed on the invaders' master plan for taking over a world. Why they\ndesired to do so even the dolphins had not been able to discover;\nperhaps they themselves had not been told by their superiors.\n\nIt was a plan almost contemptuous in its simplicity, as if the galactic\nforce had no reason to fear effective opposition. Except in one\ndirection--one single direction.\n\nRoss's fingers tightened on the shell cup. Had Torgul reached that\nconclusion yet, the belief that the Foanna could be their key? If so,\nthey might be able to achieve their separate purposes in one action.\n\n\"It would seem that they are wary of the Foanna,\" he suggested, alert to\nany telltale response from Torgul. But it was Jazia who answered the\nTerran's half question.\n\n\"The Foanna have a powerful magic; they can order wind and wave, man and\ncreature--if so be their will. Well might these killers fear the\nFoanna!\"\n\n\"Yet now they move against them,\" Ross pointed out, still eyeing Torgul.\n\nThe Captain's reply was a small, quiet smile.\n\n\"Not directly, as you have heard. It is all a part of their plan to set\none of us against the other, letting us fight many small wars and so use\nup our men while they take no risks. They wait the day when we shall be\nexhausted and then they will reveal themselves to claim all they wish.\nSo today they stir up trouble between the Wreckers and the Foanna,\nknowing that the Foanna are few. Also they strive in turn to anger us by\nraids, allowing us to believe that either the Wreckers or Foanna have\nattacked. Thus--\" he held up his left thumb, made a pincers of right\nthumb and forefinger to close upon it, \"they hope to catch the Foanna,\nbetween Wreckers and Rovers. Because the Foanna are those they reckon\nthe most dangerous they move against them now, using us and weakening\nour forces into the bargain. A plan which is clever, but the plan of men\nwho do not like to fight with their own blades.\"\n\n\"They are worse than the coast scum, these cowards!\" Ongal spat.\n\nTorgul smiled again. \"That is what they believe we will say, kinsman,\nand so underrate them. By our customs, yes, they are cowards. But what\ncare they for our judgments? Did we think of the salkars when we used\nthem to force the lagoon? No, they were only beasts to be our tools.\nSo now it is the same with us, except that we know what they intend.\nAnd we shall not be such obedient tools. If the Foanna are our answer,\nthen--\" He paused, gazing into his cup as if he could read some shadowy\nfuture there.\n\n\"If the Foanna are the answer, then what?\" Ross pushed.\n\n\"Instead of fighting the Foanna, we must warm, cherish, try to ally\nourselves with them. And do all that while we still have time!\"\n\n\"Just how do we do these things?\" demanded Ongal. \"The Foanna you would\nwarn, cherish, claim as allies, are already our enemies. Were we not on\nthe way to force their sea gate only days ago? There is no chance of\nseeking peace now. And have the finned ones not learned from the\nwomen-killers that already there is an army of Wreckers camped about the\ncitadel to which these sons of the Shadow plan to lend certain weapons?\nDo we throw away three cruisers--all we have left--in a hopeless fight?\nSuch is the council of one struck by loss of wits.\"\n\n\"There is a way--my way,\" Ross seized the opening. \"In the Foanna\ncitadel is my sword-lord, to whose service I am vowed. We were on our\nway to attempt his freeing when your ship picked us out of the waves. He\nis learned beyond me in the dealing with strange peoples, and if the\nFoanna are as clever as you say, they will already have discovered that\nhe is not just a slave they claimed from Lord Zahur.\"\n\nThere it was in the open, his own somewhat tattered hope that Ashe had\nbeen able to impress his captors with his knowledge and potential.\nTrained to act as contact man with other races, there was a chance that\nGordon had saved himself from whatever fate had been planned for the\nprisoners the Foanna had claimed. If that happened, Ashe could be their\nopening wedge in the Foanna stronghold.\n\n\"This also I know: That which guards the gate--which turns your minds\nwhirling and sent you back from your raid--does not affect me. I may be\nable to win inside and find my clansman, and in that doing treat with\nthe Foanna.\"\n\nThe Baldy prisoners had not underestimated the attack on the Foanna\ncitadel. As the Rover cruisers beat in under the cover of night the\nfires and torches of both besieged and besiegers made a wild glow across\nthe sky. Only on the sea side of the fortress there was no sign of\ninvolvement. Whatever guarded the gate must still be in force.\n\nRoss stood with his feet well apart to balance his body against the\nswing of the deck. His suggestion had been argued over, protested, but\nat last carried with the support of Torgul and Jazia, and now he was to\nmake his try. The sum of the Rovers' and Loketh's knowledge of the sea\ngate had been added for his benefit, but he knew that this venture must\ndepend upon himself alone. Karara, the dolphins, the Hawaikans, were all\ntoo sensitive to the barrier.\n\nTorgul moved in the faint light. \"We are close; our power is ebbing. If\nwe advance, we shall be drifting soon.\"\n\n\"It is time then.\" Ross crossed to the rope ladder, but another was\nthere before him. Karara perched on the rail. He regarded her angrily.\n\n\"You can't go.\"\n\n\"I know. But we are still safe here. Just because you are free of one\ndefense of the gate, Ross, do not believe that makes it easy.\"\n\nHe was stung by her assumption that he could be so self-assured.\n\n\"I know my business.\"\n\nRoss pushed past her, swinging down the rope ladder, pausing only above\nwater level to snap on flippers, make sure of the set of his weighted\nbelt, and slide his gill-mask over his face. There was a splash beside\nhim as the net containing spare belt, flippers, and mask hit the water\nand he caught at it. These could provide Ashe's escape from the\nfortress.\n\nThe lights on the shore made a wide arc of radiance across the sea. As\nRoss headed toward the wave-washed coast he began to hear shouting and\nother sounds which made him believe that the besiegers were in the midst\nof an all-out assault. Yet those distant fires and rocketlike blasts\ninto the sky had a wavery blur. And Ross, making his way with the\neffortless water cleaving of the diver, surfaced now and then to spot\nfilm curling up from the surface of the sea between the two standing\nrock pillars which marked the sea gate.\n\nHe was startled by a thunderous crack, rending the air above the small\nbay. Ross pulled to one of the pillars, steadied himself with one hand\nagainst it. Those twists of film rising from the surging surface were\nthickening. More tendrils grew out from parent stems to creep along\nabove the waves, raising up sprouts and branches in turn. A wall of mist\nwas building between gate and shore.\n\nAgain a thunderclap overhead. Involuntarily the Terran ducked. Then he\nturned his face up to the sky, striving to see any evidence of storm.\nWhat hung there sped the growth of the fog on the water. Yet where the\nfog was gray-white, it was a darkness spouting from the highest point of\nthe citadel. Ross could not explain how he was able to see one shade of\ndarkness against equal dusk, but he did--or did he only sense it? He\nshook his head, willing himself to look away from the finger. Only it\nwas a finger no longer; now it was a fist aimed at the stars it was fast\nblotting out. A fist rising to the heavens before it curled back,\ndescended to press the fortress and its surroundings into rock and\nearth.\n\nFog curled about Ross, spilled outward through the sea gates. He loosed\nhis grip on the pillar and dived, swimming on through the gap with the\nfortress of the Foanna before him.\n\nThere was a jetty somewhere ahead; that much he knew from Torgul's\ndescription. Those who served the Foanna sometimes took sea roads and\nthey had slim, fast cutters for such coastwise travel. Ross surfaced\ncautiously, to discover there was no visibility to wave level. Here the\nmist was thick, a smothering cover so bewildering he was confused as to\ndirection. He ducked below again and flippered on.\n\nWas his confusion born of the fog, or was it also in his head? Did he,\nafter all, have this much reaction to the gate defense? Ross ducked that\nsuspicion as he had ducked the moist blanket on the surface. He had come\nfrom the gate, which meant that the jetty must lie--there!\n\nA few moments later Ross had proof that his sense of direction had not\naltogether failed him, when his shoulder grazed against a solid\nobstruction in the water and his exploring touch told him that he had\nfound one of the jetty piles. He surfaced again and this time he heard\nnot a thunder roll but the singsong chanting of the Foanna.\n\nIt was loud, almost directly above his head, but since the cotton mist\nheld he was not afraid of being sighted. The chanter must be on the\njetty. And to Ross's right was a dark bulk which he thought was one of\nthe cutters. Was a sortie by the besieged being planned?\n\nThen, out of the night, came a dazzling beam, well above the level of\nRoss's head where he clung to the piling. It centered on the cutter,\nslicing into the substance of the vessel with the ease of steel piercing\nclay. The chanting stopped on mid-note, broken by cries of surprise and\nalarm. Ross, pressing against the pile, received a jolt from his belt\nsonic.\n\nThere must be a Baldy sub in the basin inside the gate. Perhaps the\nflame beam now destroying the cutter was to be turned on the walls of\nthe keep in turn.\n\nFoanna chant again, low and clear. Splashes from the water as those on\nthe jetty cast into the sea objects Ross could not define. The Terran's\nbody jerked, his mask smothered a cry of pain. About his legs and\nmiddle, immersed in the waves, there was cold so intense that it seared.\nFear goaded him to pull up on one of the under beams of the pier. He\nreached that refuge and rubbed his icy legs with what vigor he could\nsummon.\n\nMoments later he crept along toward the shore. The energy ray had found\nanother target. Ross paused to watch a second cutter sliced. If the\ncounter stroke of the Foanna would rout the invaders, it had not yet\nbegun to work.\n\nThe net holding the extra gear brought along in hopes of Ashe's escape\nweighed the Terran down, but he would not abandon it as he felt his way\nfrom one foot- and hand-hold to the next. The waves below gave off an\nicy exudation which made him shiver uncontrollably. And he knew that as\nlong as that effect lasted he dared not venture into the sea again.\n\nLight ... along with the cold, there was a phosphorescence on the\nwater--white patches floating, dipping, riding the waves. Some of them\ngathered under the pier, clustering about the pilings. And the fog\nthinned with their coming, as if those irregular blotches absorbed and\nfed upon the mist. The Terran could see now he had reached the land end\nof the jetty. He wedged his flippers into his belt, pulled on over his\nfeet the covers of salkar-hide Torgul had provided.\n\nSave for his belt, his trunks, and the gill-pack, Ross's body was bare\nand the cold caught at him. But, slinging the carry net over his\nshoulder, he dropped to the damp sand and stood listening.\n\nThe clamor of the attack which had carried all the way offshore to the\nRover cruisers had died away. And there were no more claps of thunder.\nInstead, there was now a thick wash of rain.\n\nNo more fire rays as he faced seaward. And the fog was lifting, so Ross\ncould distinguish the settling cutters, their bows still moored to the\njetty. There was no movement there. Had those on the pier fled?\n\nDot ... dash ... dot ...\n\nRoss did not drop the net. But he crouched back in the half protection\nof the piling. For a moment which stretched beyond Terran time measure\nhe froze so, waiting.\n\nDot ... dash ... dot ...\n\nNot the prickle induced by the enemy installations, it was a real coded\ncall picked up by his sonic, and one he knew.\n\nDon't rush, he told himself sharply--play it safe. By rights only two\npeople in this time and place would know that call. And one would have\nno reason to use it. But--a trap? This could be a trap. Awe of the\nFoanna powers had touched him a little in spite of his off-world\nskepticism. He could be lured now by someone using Ashe's call.\n\nRoss stripped for action after a fashion, bundling the net and its\ncontents into a hollow he scooped behind a pile well above water level.\nThe alien hand weapon he had left with Karara, not trusting it to the\nsea. But he had his diver's knife and his two hands which, by training,\ncould be, and had been, deadly weapons.\n\nWith the sonic against the bare skin of his middle where it would\nregister strongest, knife in hand, Ross moved into the open. The\nfloating patches did not supply much light, but he was certain the call\nhad come from the jetty.\n\nThere was movement there--a flash or two. And the sonic? Ross had to be\nsure, very sure. The broadcast was certainly stronger when he faced in\nthat direction. Dared he come into the open? Perhaps in the dark he\ncould cut Ashe away from his captors so they could swim for it together.\n\nRoss clicked a code reply. Dot ... dot ... dot ...\n\nThe answer was quick, imperative: \"Where?\"\n\nSurely no one but Ashe could have sent that! Ross did not hesitate.\n\n\"Be ready--escape.\"\n\n\"No!\" Even more imperative. \"Friends here....\"\n\nHad he guessed rightly? Had Ashe established friendly relations with the\nFoanna? But Ross kept to the caution which had been his defense and\narmor so long. There was one question he thought only Ashe could answer,\nsomething out of the past they had shared when they had made their first\njourney into time disguised as Beaker traders of the Bronze Age.\nDeliberately he tapped that question.\n\n\"What did we kill in Britain?\"\n\nTensely he waited. But when the reply came it did not pulse from the\nsonic under his fingers; instead, a well-remembered voice called out of\nthe night.\n\n\"A white wolf.\" And the words were Terran English.\n\n\"Ashe!\" Ross leaped forward, climbed toward the figure he could only\ndimly see.\n\n\n\n\n14\n\nThe Foanna\n\n\n\"Ross!\" Ashe's hands gripped his shoulders as if never intending to free\nhim again. \"Then you did come through--\"\n\nRoss understood. Gordon Ashe must have feared that he was the only one\nswept through the time door by that freak chance.\n\n\"And Karara and the dolphins!\"\n\n\"Here--now?\" In this black bowl of the citadel bay Ashe was only a\nshadow with voice and hands.\n\n\"No, out with the Rover cruisers. Ashe, do you know the Baldies are on\nHawaika? They've organized this whole thing--the attack here--trouble\nall over. Right now they have one of their subs out there. That's what\ncut those cutters to pieces. Five days ago five of them wiped out a\nwhole Rover fairing, just five of them!\"\n\n\"Gordoon.\" Unlike the hissing speech of the Hawaikans, this new voice\nmade a singing, lilting call of Ashe's name. \"This is your swordsman in\ntruth?\" Another shadow drew near them, and Ross saw the flutter of cloak\nedge.\n\n\"This is my friend.\" There was a tone of correction in Ashe's reply.\n\"Ross, this is the Guardian of the sea gate.\"\n\n\"And you come,\" the Foanna continued, \"with those who gather to feast at\nthe Shadow's table. But your Rovers will find little loot to their\nliking--\"\n\n\"No.\" Ross hesitated. How did one address the Foanna? He had claimed\nequality with Torgul. But that approach was not the proper one here;\ninstinct told him that. He fell back on the complete truth uttered\nsimply. \"We took three of the Baldy killers. From them we learned they\nmove to wipe out the Foanna first. For you,\" he addressed himself to the\ncloaked shape, \"they believe to be a threat. We heard that they urged\nthe Wreckers to this attack and so--\"\n\n\"And so the Rovers come, but not to loot? Then they are something new\namong their kind.\" The Foanna's reply was as chill as the sea bay's\nwater.\n\n\"Loot does not summon men who want a blood price for their dead kin!\"\nRoss retorted.\n\n\"No, and the Rovers are believers in the balance of hurt against hurt,\"\nthe Foanna conceded. \"Do they also believe in the balance of aid against\naid? Now that is a thought upon which depends much. Gordoon, it would\nseem that we may not take to our ships. So let us return to council.\"\n\nAshe's hand was on Ross's arm guiding him through the murk. Though the\nfog which had choked the bay had vanished, thick darkness remained and\nRoss noted that even the fires and flares were dimmed and fewer. Then\nthey were in a passage where a very faint light clung to the walls.\n\nRobed Foanna, three of them, moved ahead with that particular gliding\nprogress. Then Ashe and Ross, and bringing up the rear, a dozen of the\nmailed guards. The passageway became a ramp. Ross glanced at Ashe. Like\nthe Foanna, the Terran Agent wore a cloak of gray, but his did not shift\ncolor from time to time as did those of the Hawaikan enigmas. And now\nGordon shoved back its folds, revealing supple body armor.\n\nQuestions gathered in Ross. He wanted to know--needed desperately to\nknow--Ashe's standing with the Foanna. What had happened to raise Gordon\nfrom the status of captive in Zahur's hold to familiar companionship\nwith the most dreaded race on this planet?\n\nThe ramp's head faced blank wall with a sharp-angled turn to the right\nof a narrower passage. One of the Foanna made a slight sign to the\nguards, who turned with drilled precision to march off along the\npassage. Now the other Foanna held out their wands.\n\nWhat a moment earlier had been unbroken surface showed an opening. The\nchange had been so instantaneous that Ross had not seen any movement at\nall.\n\nBeyond that door they passed from one world to another. Ross's senses,\nalready acutely alert to his surroundings, could not supply him with any\nreason by sight, sound, or smell for his firm conviction that this hold\nwas alien as neither the Wrecker castle nor the Rover ships had been.\nSurely the Foanna were not the same race, perhaps not even the same\nspecies as the other native Hawaikans.\n\nThose robes which he had seen both silver gray and dark blue, now faded,\npearled, thinned, until each of the three still gliding before him were\nopalescent columns without definite form.\n\nAshe's grasp fell on Ross's arm once more, and his whisper reached the\nyounger man thinly. \"They are mistresses of illusion. Be prepared not to\nbelieve all that you see.\"\n\nMistresses--Ross caught that first. Women, or at least female then.\nIllusion, yes, already he was convinced that here his eyes could play\ntricks on him. He could hardly determine what was robe, what was wall,\nor if more than shades of shades swept before him.\n\nAnother blank wall, then an opening, and flowing through it to touch him\nsuch a wave of alienness that Ross felt he was buffeted by a storm wind.\nYet as he hesitated before it, reluctant in spite of Ashe's hold to go\nahead, he also knew that this did not carry with it the cold hostility\nhe had known while facing the Baldies. Alien--yes. Inimical to his\nkind--no.\n\n\"You are right, younger brother.\"\n\nSpoken those words--or forming in his mind?\n\nRoss was in a place which was sheer wonder. Under his feet dark\nblue--the blue of a Terran sky at dusk--caught up in it twinkling points\nof light as if he strode, not equal with stars, but above them!\nWalls--were there any walls here? Or shifting, swaying blue curtains on\nwhich silvery lines ran to form symbols and words which some bemused\npart of his brain almost understood, but not quite.\n\nConstant motion, no quiet, until he came to a place where those swaying\ncurtains were stilled, where he no longer strode above the sky but on\nsoft surface, a mat of gray living sod where his steps released a spicy\nfragrance. And there he really saw the Foanna for the first time.\n\nWhere had their cloaks gone? Had they tossed them away during that walk\nor drift across this amazing room, or had the substance which had formed\nthose coverings flowed away by itself? As Ross looked at the three in\nwonder he knew that he was seeing them as not even their servants and\nguards ever viewed them. And yet was he seeing them as they really were\nor as they wished him to see them?\n\n\"As we are, younger brother, as we are!\" Again an answer which Ross was\nnot sure was thought or speech.\n\nIn form they were humanoid, and they were undoubtedly women. The\nmuffling cloaks gone, they wore sleeveless garments of silver which were\ngirded at the waist with belts of blue gems. Only in their hair and\ntheir eyes did they betray alien blood. For the hair which flowed and\nwove about them, cascading down shoulders, rippling about their arms,\nwas silver, too, and it swirled, moved as if it had a separate life of\nits own. While their eyes.... Ross looked into those golden eyes and was\nlost for seconds until panic awoke in him, forcing him after sharp\nstruggle to look away.\n\nLaughter? No, he had not heard laughter. But a sense of amusement tinged\nwith respect came to him.\n\n\"You are very right, Gordoon. This one is also of your kind. He is not\nwitches' meat.\" Ross caught the distaste, the kind of haunting\nunhappiness which colored those words, remnants of an old hurt.\n\n\"These are the Foanna,\" Ashe's voice broke more of the spell. \"The Lady\nYnlan, The Lady Yngram, the Lady Ynvalda.\"\n\nThe Foanna--these three only?\n\nShe whom Ashe had named Ynlan, whose eyes had entrapped and almost held\nwhat was Ross Murdock, made a small gesture with her ivory hand. And in\nthat gesture as well as in the words witches' meat the Terran read the\nunhappiness which was as much a part of this room as the rest of its\nmystery.\n\n\"The Foanna are now but three. They have been only three for many weary\nyears, oh man from another world and time. And soon, if these enemies\nhave their way, they will not be three--but none!\"\n\n\"But--\" Ross was still startled. He knew from Loketh that the Wreckers\nhad deemed the Foanna few in number, an old and dying race. But that\nthere were only three women left was hard to believe.\n\nThe response to his unspoken wonder came clear and determined. \"We may\nbe but three; however, our power remains. And sometimes power distilled\nby time becomes the stronger. Now it would seem that time is no longer\nour servant but perhaps among our enemies. So tell us this tale of yours\nas to why the Rovers would make one with the Foanna--tell us all,\nyounger brother!\"\n\nRoss reported what he had seen, what Tino-rau and Taua had learned from\nthe prisoners taken at Kyn Add. And when he had finished, the three\nFoanna stood very still, their hands clasped one to the other. Though\nthey were only an arm's distance from him, Ross had the feeling they had\nwithdrawn from his time and world.\n\nSo complete was their withdrawal that he dared to ask Ashe one of the\nmany questions which had been boiling inside him.\n\n\"Who are they?\" But Ross knew he really meant: What are they?\n\nGordon Ashe shook his head. \"I don't really know--the last of a very old\nrace which possesses powers and knowledge different from any we have\nbelieved in for centuries. We have heard of witches. In the modern day\nwe discount the legends about them. The Foanna bring those legends\nalive. And I promise you this--if they turn those powers loose\"--he\npaused--\"it will be such a war as this world, perhaps any world has\nnever seen!\"\n\n\"That is so.\" The Foanna had returned from the place to which they had\nwithdrawn. \"And this is also the truth or one face of the truth. The\nRovers are right in their belief that we have kept some measure of\nbalance between one form of change and another on this world. If we were\nas many as we once were, then against us these invaders could not move\nat all. But we are three only and also--do we have the right to evoke\ndisaster which will strike not only the enemy but perhaps recoil upon\nthe innocent? There has been enough death here already. And those who\nare our servants shall no longer be asked to face battle to keep an\nempty shell inviolate. We would see with our own eyes these invaders,\nprobe what they would do. There is ever change in life, and if a pattern\ngrows too set, then the race caught in it may wither and die. Maybe our\npattern has been too long in its old design. We shall make no decision\nuntil we see in whose hands the future may rest.\"\n\nAgainst such finality of argument there was no appeal. These could not\nbe influenced by words.\n\n\"Gordoon, there is much to be done. Do you take with you this younger\nbrother and see to his needs. When all is in readiness we shall come.\"\n\nOne minute Ross had been standing on the carpet of living moss.\nThen ... he was in a more normal room with four walls, a floor, a\nceiling, and light which came from rods set in the corners. He gasped.\n\n\"Stunned me, too, the first time they put me through it,\" he heard Ashe\nsay. \"Here, get some of this inside you, it'll steady your head.\"\n\nThere was a cup in his hand, a beautifully carved, rose-red container\nshaped in the form of a flower. Somehow Ross brought it to his lips with\nshaking hands, gulped down a good third of its contents. The liquid was\na mixture of tart and sweet, cooling his mouth and throat, but warming\nas it went down, and that glow spread through him.\n\n\"What--how did they do that?\" he demanded.\n\nAshe shrugged. \"How do they do the hundred and one things I have seen\nhappen here? We've been teleported. How it's done I don't know any more\nthan I did the first time it happened. Simply a part of Foanna 'magic'\nas far as spectators are concerned.\" He sat down on a stool, his long\nlegs stretched out before him. \"Other worlds, other ways--even if they\nare confounded queer ones. As far as I know, there's no reason for their\npower to work, but it does. Now, have you seen the time gate? Is it in\nworking order?\"\n\nRoss put down the now empty cup and sat down opposite Ashe. As concisely\nas he could, he outlined the situation with a quick r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of all that\nhad happened to him, Karara, and the dolphins since they had been sucked\nthrough the gate. Ashe asked no questions, but his expression was that\nof the Agent Ross had known, evaluating and listing all the younger man\nhad to report. When the other was through he said only two words:\n\n\"No return.\"\n\nSo much had happened in so short a time that Ross's initial shock at the\ndestruction of the gate had faded, been well overlaid by all the demands\nmade upon his resources, skill, and strength. Even now, the fact Ashe\nvoiced seemed of little consequence balanced against the struggle in\nprogress.\n\n\"Ashe--\" Ross rubbed his hands up and down his arms, brushing away\ngrains of sand, \"remember those pylons with the empty seacoast behind\nthem? Does that mean the Baldies are going to win?\"\n\n\"I don't know. No one has ever tried to change the course of history.\nMaybe it is impossible even if we dared to try.\" Ashe was on his feet\nagain, pacing back and forth.\n\n\"Try what, Gordoon?\"\n\nRoss jerked around, Ashe halted. One of the Foanna stood there, her hair\nplaying about her shoulders as if some breeze felt only by her stirred\nthose long strands.\n\n\"Dare to try and change the course of the future,\" Ashe explained,\naccepting her materialization with the calm of one who had witnessed it\nbefore.\n\n\"Ah, yes, your traveling in time. And now you think that perhaps this\npoor world of ours has a choice as to which overlords it will welcome? I\ndo not know either, Gordoon, whether the future may be altered nor if it\nbe wise to try. But also ... well, perhaps we should see our enemy\nbefore we are set in any path. Now, it is time that we go. Younger\nbrother, how did you plan to leave this place when you accomplished your\nmission?\"\n\n\"By the sea gate. I have extra swimming equipment cached under the\njetty.\"\n\n\"And the Rover ships await you at sea?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then we shall take your way, since the cutters are sunk.\"\n\n\"There is only one extra gill-pack--and that Baldy sub is out there,\ntoo!\"\n\n\"So? Then we shall try another road, though it will sap our power\ntemporarily.\" Her head inclined slightly to the left as if she listened.\n\"Good! Our people are now in the passage which will take them to safety.\nWhat those outside will find here when they break in will be of little\naid to their plans. Secrets of the Foanna remain secrets past others'\nprying. Though they shall try, oh, how they shall try to solve them!\nThere is knowledge that only certain types of minds can hold and use,\nand to others it remains for all time unlearnable. Now--\"\n\nHer hand reached out, flattened against Ross's forehead.\n\n\"Think of your Rover ship, younger brother, see it in your mind! And see\nwell and clearly for me.\"\n\nTorgul's cruiser was there; he could picture with details he had not\nthought he knew or remembered. The deck in the dark of the night with\nonly a shaded light at the mast. The deck ...\n\nRoss gave a choked cry. He did not see this in his mind; he saw it with\nhis eyes! His hand swung out in an involuntary gesture of repudiation\nand struck painfully against wood. He was on the cruiser!\n\nA startled exclamation from behind him--then a shout. Ashe was here and\nbeyond him three cloaked figures, the Foanna. They had their own road\nindeed and had taken it.\n\n\"You ... Rosss--\" Vistur fronted them, his face a mixture of\nbewilderment and awe. \"The Foanna--\" said in a half whisper, echoed by\ncrewmen gathering around, but not too close.\n\n\"Gordon!\" Karara elbowed her way between two of the Hawaikans and ran\nacross the deck. She caught the Agent's both hands as if to assure\nherself that he was alive and there before her. Then she turned to the\nthree Foanna.\n\nThere was an odd expression on the Polynesian girl's face, first of\nmeasurement with some fear, and then of dawning wonder. From beneath the\ncloak of the middle Foanna came the rod of office with its sparking\nknob. Karara dropped Ashe's hands, took a tentative step forward and\nthen another. The knob was directly before her, breast high. She brought\nup both hands, cupping them about the knob, but not touching it\ndirectly. The sparks it emitted could have been flashing against her\nflesh, but Karara displayed no awareness of that. Instead, she lifted\nboth hands farther, palm up and cupped, as if she carried some invisible\nbounty, then flattened them, loosing what she held.\n\nThere was a sigh from the crewmen; Karara's gesture had been confident,\nas if she knew just what she was doing and why. And Ross heard Ashe draw\na deep breath also as the Terran girl turned, allying herself with the\nFoanna.\n\n\"These Great Ones stand in peace,\" she said. \"It is their will that no\nharm comes to this ship and those who sail in her.\"\n\n\"What do the Great Ones want of us?\" Torgul advanced but not too near.\n\n\"To speak concerning those who are your prisoners.\"\n\n\"So be it.\" The Captain bowed. \"The Great Ones' will is our will; let it\nbe as they wish.\"\n\n\n\n\n15\n\nReturn to the Battle\n\n\nRoss lay listening to the even breathing from across the cabin. He had\nawakened in that quick transference from sleep to consciousness which\nwas always his when on duty, but he made no attempt to move. Ashe was\nstill sleeping.\n\nAshe, whom he thought or had thought he knew as well as one man could\never know another, who had taken the place of family for Ross Murdock\nthe loner. Years--two ... four of them now since he had made half of\nthat partnership.\n\nHis head turned, though he could not see that lean body, that quiet,\ncontrolled face. Ashe still looked the same, but ... Ross's sense of\nloss was hurt and anger mingled. What had they done to Gordon, those\nthree? Bewitched? Tales Terrans had accepted as purest fantasy for\ncenturies came into his mind. Could it be that his own world once had\nits Foanna?\n\nRoss scowled. You couldn't refute their \"magic,\" call it by what\nscientific name you wished--hypnotism ... telaporting. They got results,\nand the results were impressive. Now he remembered the warning the\nFoanna themselves had delivered hours earlier to the Rovers. There were\nlimits to their abilities; because they were forced to draw on mental\nand physical energy, they could be exhausted. Thus, they had barriers,\ntoo.\n\nAgain Ross considered the subject of barriers. Karara had been able to\nmeet the aliens, if not mind-to-mind, then in a closer way even than\nAshe. The talent which tied her to the dolphins had in turn been a bond\nwith the Foanna. Ashe and Karara could enter that circle, but not Ross\nMurdock. Along with his new separation from Ashe came that feeling of\ninferiority to bite on, and the taste was sour.\n\n\"This isn't going to be easy.\"\n\nSo Ashe was awake.\n\n\"What can they do?\" Ross asked in return.\n\n\"I don't know. I don't believe that they can telaport an army into Baldy\nheadquarters the way Torgul expects. And it wouldn't do such an army\nmuch good to get there and then be outclassed by the weapons the Baldies\nmight have,\" Ashe said.\n\nRoss had a moment of warmth and comfort; he knew that tone of old. Ashe\nwas studying the problem, willing to talk out difficulties as he always\nhad before.\n\n\"No, outright assault isn't the answer. We'll have to know more about\nthe enemy. One thing puzzles me: Why have the Baldies suddenly stepped\nup their timing?\"\n\n\"What makes you think they have?\"\n\n\"Well, according to the accounts I've heard, it's been about three or\nfour planet years here since some off-world devices have been\ninfiltrating the native civilization--\"\n\n\"You mean such things as those attractors set up on the reef at Zahur's\ncastle?\" Ross remembered Loketh's story.\n\n\"Those, and other things. The refinements added to the engine power on\nthese ships.... Torgul said they spread from Rover fleet to fleet; no\none's sure where they started. The Baldies began slowly, but they are\nspeeding up now--those fairing attacks have all been recent. And this\nassault on the Foanna citadel blew up almost overnight on a flimsy\nexcuse. Why the quick push after the slow beginning?\"\n\n\"Maybe they decided the natives are easy pushovers and they no longer\nhave to worry about any real opposition,\" Ross suggested.\n\n\"Could be. Self-confidence becoming arrogance when they didn't uncover\nany opponent strong enough to matter. Or else, they may be spurred by\nsome need with a time limit. If we knew the reason for those pylons, we\nmight guess their motives.\"\n\n\"Are you going to try to change the future?\"\n\n\"That sounds arrogant, too. Can we if we wish to? We never dared to try\nit on Terra. And the risk may be worse than all our fears. Also, the\nchoice is not ours.\"\n\n\"There's one thing I don't understand,\" Ross said. \"Why did the Foanna\nwalk out of the citadel and leave it undefended for their enemies? What\nabout their guards? Did they just leave them too?\" He was willing to\nmake the most of any flaw in the aliens' character.\n\n\"Most of their people had already escaped through underground ways. The\nrest left when they knew the cutters had been sunk,\" Ashe returned. \"As\nto why they deserted the citadel, I don't know. The decision was\ntheirs.\"\n\nThere--up with the barrier between them again. But Ross refused to\naccept the cutoff this time, determined to pull Ashe back into the\nfamiliar world of the here and now.\n\n\"That keep could be a trap, about the best on this planet!\" The idea was\nmore than just a gambit to attract Ashe's attention, it was true! A\nperfect trap to catch Baldies.\n\n\"Don't you see,\" Ross sat up, slapped his feet down on the deck as he\nleaned forward eagerly. \"Don't you see ... if the Baldies know anything\nat all about the Foanna, and I'm betting they do and want to learn all\nthey can, they'll visit the citadel. They won't want to depend on\nsecond- and third-hand reports of the place, especially ones delivered\nby primitives such as the Wreckers. They had a sub there. I'll bet the\ncrew are in picking over the loot right now!\"\n\n\"If that's what they're hunting\"--there was amusement in Ashe's\ntone--\"they won't find much. The Foanna have better locks than their\nenemies have keys. You heard Ynlan before we left--any secrets left will\nremain secrets.\"\n\n\"But there's bait--bait for a trap!\" argued Ross.\n\n\"You're right!\" To the younger man's joy Ashe's enthusiasm was plain.\n\"And if the Baldies could be led to believe that what they wanted was\nobtainable with just a little more effort, or the right tools--\"\n\n\"The trap could net bigger catch than just underlings!\" Ross's thought\nmatched Ashe's. \"Why, it might even pull in the VIP directing the whole\noperation! How can we set it up, and do we have time?\"\n\n\"The trap would have to be of Foanna setting; our part would come after\nit was sprung.\" Ashe was thoughtful again. \"But it is the only move\nwhich we can make at present with any hope of success. And it will only\nwork if the Foanna are willing.\"\n\n\"Have to be done quickly,\" Ross pointed out.\n\n\"Yes, I'll see.\" Ashe was a dark figure against the thin light of the\ncompanionway as he slid back the cabin door. \"If Ynvalda agrees....\" As\nhe went out Ross was right behind him.\n\nThe Foanna had been given, by their own choice, quarters on the bow deck\nof the cruiser where sailcloth had been used to form a tent. Not that\nany of the awe-stricken Rovers would venture too near them. Ashe reached\nfor the flap of the fabric and a lilting voice called:\n\n\"You seek us, Gordoon?\"\n\n\"This is important.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is important, for the thought which brings you both has merit.\nEnter then, brothers!\"\n\nThe flap was looped aside and before them was a swirling of\nmist? ... light? ... sheets of pale color? Ross could not have described\nwhat he saw--save if the Foanna were there, he could not distinguish them\nfrom the rippling of their hair, the melting film of their robes.\n\n\"So, younger brother, you think that which was our home and our treasure\nbox has now become a trap for the confounding of those who believe we\nare a threat to them?\"\n\nSomehow Ross was not surprised that they knew about his idea before he\nhad said a word, before Ashe had given any explanations. Their\nomniscience was only a small portion of their other talents.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And why do you believe so? We swear to you that the coast folk can not\nbe driven into those parts of the castle which mean the most, any more\nthan our sea gate can be breached unless we will it so.\"\n\n\"Yet I swam through the sea gate, and the sub was there also.\" Ross knew\nagain a flash of--was it pleasure?--at being able to state this fact.\nThere _were_ chinks in the Foanna defenses.\n\n\"Again the truth. You have that within you, young brother, which is both\na lack and a shield. True also that this underseas ship entered after\nyou. Perhaps it has a shield as part of it; perhaps those from the stars\nhave their own protection. But they can not reach the heart of what they\nwish, not unless we open the doors for them. It is your belief, younger\nbrother, that they still strive to force such doors?\"\n\n\"Yes. Knowing there is something to be learned, they will try for it.\nThey will not dare not to.\" Ross was very certain on that point. His\nencounters with the Baldies had not led to any real understanding. But\nthe way they had wiped out the line of Russian time stations made him\nsure that they dealt thoroughly with any situation they considered a\nthreat.\n\nFrom the prisoners taken at Kyn Add they had learned the invaders\nbelieved the Foanna their enemies here, even though the Old Ones had not\nrepulsed them or their activities. Therefore, it followed that, having\ntaken the stronghold, the Baldies would endeavor to rip open every one\nof its secrets.\n\n\"A trap with good bait--\"\n\nRoss wondered which one of the Foanna said that. To see nothing but the\nswirls of mist-color, listen to disembodied voices from it, was\ndisconcerting. Part of the stage dressing, he decided, for building\ntheir prestige with the other races with whom they dealt. Three women\nalone would have to buttress their authority with such trappings.\n\n\"Ah, younger brother, indeed you are beginning to understand us!\"\nLaughter, soft, but unmistakable.\n\nRoss frowned. He did not feel the touch-go-touch of mental communication\nwhich the dolphins used. But he did not doubt that the Foanna read his\nthoughts, or at least a few of them.\n\n\"Some of them,\" echoed from the mist. \"Not all--not as your older\nbrother's or the maiden whose mind meets with ours. With you, younger\nbrother, it is a thought here, a thought there, and only our intuition\nto connect them into a pattern. But now, there is serious planning to be\ndone. And, knowing this enemy, you believe they will come to search for\nwhat they can not find. So you would set a trap. But they have weapons\nbeyond your weapons, have they not, younger brother? Brave as are these\nRover kind, they can not use swords against flame, their hands against a\nkiller who may stand apart and slay. What remains, Gordoon? What remains\nin our favor?\"\n\n\"You have your weapons, too,\" Ashe answered.\n\n\"Yes, we have our weapons, but long have they been used only in one\npattern, and they are atuned to another race. Did our defenses hold\nagainst you, Gordoon, when you strove to prove that you were as you\nclaimed to be? And did another repulse younger brother when he dared the\nsea gate? So can we trust them in turn against these other strangers\nwith different brains? Only at the testing shall we know, and in such\nlearning perhaps we shall also be forced to eat the sourness of defeat.\nTo risk all may be to lose all.\"\n\n\"That may be true,\" Ashe assented.\n\n\"You mean the sight you have had into our future says that this happens?\nYes, to stake all and to lose--not only for ourselves, but for all\nothers here--that is a weighty decision to make, Gordoon. But the trap\npromises. Let us think on it for a space. Do you also consult with the\nRovers if they wish to take part in what may be desperate folly.\"\n\nTorgul paced the afterdeck, well away from the tent which sheltered the\nFoanna, but with his eyes turning to it as Ross explained what might be\na good attack.\n\n\"Those women-killers would have no fear of Foanna magic, rather would\nthey come to seek it out? It would be a chance to catch leaders in a\ntrap?\"\n\n\"You have heard what the prisoners said or thought. Yes, they would seek\nout such knowledge and we would have this chance to capture them--\"\n\n\"With what?\" Torgul demanded. \"I am not Ongal to argue that it is better\nto die in pursuit of blood payment than to take an enemy or enemies with\nme! What chance have we against their powers?\"\n\n\"Ask that of them!\" Ross nodded toward the still silent tent.\n\nEven as he spoke the three cloaked Foanna emerged, pacing down to\nmid-ship where Torgul and his lieutenants, Ross and Ashe came to meet\nthem.\n\n\"We have thought on this.\" The lilting half chant which the Foanna used\nfor ordinary communication was a song in the dawn wind. \"It was in our\nminds to retreat, to wait out this troubling of the land, since we are\nfew and that which we hold within us is worth the guarding. But now,\nwhat profit such guardianship when there may be none to whom we may pass\nit after us? And if you have seen the truth, elder brother\"--the cowled\nheads swung to Ashe--\"then there may be no future for any of us. But\nstill there are our limitations. Rover,\" now they spoke directly to\nTorgul, \"we can not put your men within the citadel by desiring--not\nwithout certain aids which lie sealed there now. No, we, ourselves, must\nwin inside bodily and then ... then, perhaps, we can pull tight the\nlines of our net!\"\n\n\"To run a cruiser through the gate--\" Torgul began.\n\n\"No, not a ship, Captain. A handful of warriors in the water can risk\nthe gate, but not a ship.\"\n\nAshe broke in, \"How many gill-packs do we have?\"\n\nRoss counted hurriedly. \"I left one cached ashore. But there's mine and\nKarara's and Loketh's--also two more--\"\n\n\"To pass the gates,\" that was the Foanna, \"we ourselves shall not need\nyour underwater aids.\"\n\n\"You,\" Ross said to Ashe, \"and I with Karara's pack----\"\n\n\"For Karara!\"\n\nBoth the Terrans looked around. The Polynesian girl stood close to the\nFoanna, smiling faintly.\n\n\"This venture is mine also,\" she spoke with conviction. \"As it is\nTino-rau's and Taua's. Is that not so, Daughters of the Alii of this\nworld?\"\n\n\"Yes, Sea Maid. There are weapons of many sorts, and not all of them fit\ninto a warrior's hand or can be swung with the force of a man's arm and\nshoulder. Yes, this venture is yours, also, sister.\"\n\nRoss's protests bubbled unspoken; he had to accept the finality of the\nFoanna decree. It seemed now that the make-up of their task force\ndepended upon the whims of the three rather than the experience of those\ntrained to such risks. And Ashe was apparently willing to accept their\nleadership.\n\nSo it was an odd company that took to the water just as dawn colored the\nsky. Loketh had clung fiercely to his pack, insisted that he be one of\nthe swimmers, and the Foanna accepted him as well. Ross and Ashe,\nLoketh, and Baleku, a young under-officer of Ongal's, accorded the best\nswimmer of the fleet, Karara and the dolphins. And with them those three\nothers, shapes sliding smoothly through the water, as difficult to\ndefine in this new element as they had been in their tent. Before them\nfrisked the dolphins. Tino-rau and Taua played about the Foanna in an\necstatic joy and when all were in the sea they shot off shoreward.\n\nThat sub within the sea gate, had it unleashed the same lethal broadcast\nas the one at Kyn Add? But the dolphins could give warning if that were\nso.\n\nRoss swam easily, Ashe next, Loketh on his left, Baleku a little behind\nand Karara to the fore as if in vain pursuit of the dolphins--the Foanna\nwell to the left. A queer invasion party, even queerer when one totaled\nup the odds which might lie ahead.\n\nThere was no mist or storm this morning to hide the headlands where the\nFoanna citadel stood. And the promontories of the sea gate were starkly\nclear in the growing light. The same drive which always was a part of\nRoss when he was committed to action sustained him now, though he was\nvisited by a small prick of doubt when he thought that the leadership\ndid not lie with Ashe but with the Foanna.\n\nNo warning of any trouble ahead as they passed between the mighty,\nsea-sunk bases of the gate pillars. Ross depended upon his sonic, but\nthere was no adverse report from the sensitive recorder. The terrible\nchill of the water during the night attack had been dissipated, but here\nand there dead sea things floated, being torn and devoured by hunters of\nthe waves.\n\nThey were well past the pillars when Ross was aware that Loketh had\nchanged place in the line, spurting ahead. After him went Baleku. They\ncaught up with Karara, flashed past her.\n\nRoss looked to Ashe, on to the Foanna, but saw nothing to explain the\naction of the two Hawaikans. Then his sonic beat out a signal from Ashe.\n\n\"Danger ... follow the Foanna ... left.\"\n\nKarara had already changed course to head in that direction. Ahead of\nher he could see Loketh and Baleku both still bound for the mid-point of\nthe shore where the jetty and the sunken cutters were. Ashe passed\nbefore him, and Ross reluctantly followed orders.\n\nA shelf of rock reached out from the cliff wall, under it a dark\nopening. The Foanna sought this without hesitation, Ashe, Karara, and\nRoss following. Moments later they were out of the water where footing\nsloped back and up. Below them Tino-rau and Taua nosed the rise, their\nheads lifting out of the water as they \"spoke.\" And Karara hastened to\nreply.\n\n\"Loketh ... Baleku ...\" Ross began when he caught a mental stroke of\nanger so deadly that it was a chill lance into his brain. He faced the\nFoanna, startled and a little frightened.\n\n\"They will not come--now.\" A knob-crowned wand stretched out in the air,\npointing to the upper reaches of the slope. \"Nor can any of their\nblood--unless we win.\"\n\n\"What is wrong?\" Ashe asked.\n\n\"You were right, very right, men out of time! These invaders are not to\nbe lightly dismissed. They have turned one of our own defenses against\nus. Loketh, Baleku, all of their kind, can be made into tools for a\nmaster. They belong to the enemy now.\"\n\n\"And we have failed so early?\" Karara wanted to know.\n\nAgain that piercing thrust of anger so vivid that it was no mere emotion\nbut seemed a tangible force.\n\n\"Failed? No, not yet have we even begun to fight! You were very right;\nthis is such an evil as must be faced and fought, even if we lose all in\nbattle! Now we must do that which none of our own race has done for\ngenerations--we must open three locks, throw wide the Great Door, and\nseek out the Keeper of the Closed Knowledge!\"\n\nLight, a sharp ray sighting from the tip of the wand. And the Foanna\nfollowing that beam, the three Terrans coming after ... into the\nunknown.\n\n\n\n\n16\n\nThe Opening of the Great Door\n\n\nIt was not the general airlessness of the long-closed passage which wore\non Ross's nerves, made Karara suddenly reach out and clasp fingers about\nthe wrists of the two men she walked between; it was a crushing\nsensation of age, of a toll of years so long, so heavy, as to make time\nitself into a turgid flood which tugged at their bodies, mired their\nfeet as they trudged after the Foanna. This sense of age, of a dead and\nheavy past, was so stifling that all three Terrans breathed in gasps.\n\nKarara's breaths became sobs. Yet she matched her pace to Ashe and Ross,\nkept going. Ross himself had little idea of their surroundings, but one\nsmall portion of his brain asked answerless questions. The foremost\nbeing: Why did the past crush in on him here? He had traveled time, but\nnever before had he been beaten with the feel of countless dead and\ndying years.\n\n\"Going back--\" That hoarse whisper came from Ashe, and Ross thought he\nunderstood.\n\n\"A time gate!\" He was eager to accept such an explanation. Time gates he\ncould understand, but that the Foanna used one....\n\n\"Not our kind,\" Ashe replied.\n\nBut his words had pulled Ross out of a spell which had been as quicksand\nabout him. And he began to fight back with a determination not to be\nsucked into what filled this place. In spite of Ross's efforts, his eyes\ncould supply him with no definite impression of where they were. The\nramp had led them out of the sea, but where they walked now, linked hand\nto hand, Ross could not say. He could see the glimmer of the Foanna;\nturning his head he could see his companions as shadows, but all beyond\nthat was utter dark.\n\n\"Ahhhh--\" Karara's sobs gave way to a whisper which was half moan. \"This\nis a way of gods, old gods, gods who never dealt with men! It is not\nwell to walk the road of the gods!\"\n\nHer fear lapped to Ross. He faced that emotion as he had faced so many\ndifferent kinds of fear all his life. Sure, he felt that pressure on\nhim, not the pressure of past centuries now--but a power beyond his\nability to describe.\n\n\"Not our gods!\" Ross put his stubborn defiance into words, more as a\nshield against his own wavering. \"No power where there is no belief!\"\nFrom what half-forgotten bit of reading had he dredged that knowledge?\n\"No being without belief!\" he repeated.\n\nTo his vast amazement he heard Ashe laugh, though the sound bordered on\nhysteria.\n\n\"No belief, no power,\" the older man replied. \"You've speared the right\nfish, Ross! No gods of ours dwell here, Karara, and whatever god does\nhas no rights over us. Hold to that, girl, hold tight!\"\n\n    \"Ah, ye forty thousand gods,\n    Ye gods of sea, of sky, of woods,\n    Of mountains, of valleys,\n    Ye assemblies of gods,\n    Ye elder brothers of the gods that are,\n    Ye gods that once were,\n    Ye that whisper. Ye that watch by night,\n    Ye that show your gleaming eyes,\n    Come down, awake, stir,\n    Walk this road, walk this road!\"\n\nShe was singing, first softly and then more strongly, the liquid words\nof her own tongue repeated in English as if what she strove to call she\nwould share with her companions. Now there was triumph in her singing\nand Ross found himself echoing her, \"Walk this road!\" as a demand.\n\nIt was still there, all of it, the crushing weight of the past, and that\nwhich brooded within that past, which had reached out for them, to\npossess or to alter. Only they were free of that reaching now. And they\ncould see too! The fuzzy darkness was lighter and there were normal\nwalls about them. Ross put out his free hand and rubbed finger tips\nalong rough stone.\n\nOnce more their senses were assaulted by a stealthy attack from beyond\nthe bounds of space and time as the walls fell away and they came out\ninto a wide space whose boundaries they could not see. Here that which\nbrooded was strong, a mighty weight poised aloft to strike them down.\n\n\"Come down, awake, stir....\" Karara's pleading sank again to a whisper,\nher voice sounded hoarse as if her mouth were dry, her words formed by a\nshrunken tongue, issued from a parched throat.\n\nLight spreading in channels along the floor, making a fiery\npattern--patterns within patterns, intricate designs within designs.\nRoss jerked his eyes away from those patterns. To study them was danger,\nhe knew without being warned. Karara's nails bit into his flesh and he\nwelcomed that pain; it kept him alert, conscious of what was Ross\nMurdock, holding him safely apart from something greater than he, but\nentirely alien.\n\nThe designs and patterns were lines on a pavement. And now the three\nFoanna, swaying as if yielding to unseen winds, began to follow those\npatterns with small dancing steps. But the Terrans remained where they\nwere, holding to one another for the sustaining strength their contact\noffered.\n\nBack, forth, the Foanna danced--and once more their cloaks vanished or\nwere discarded, so their silver-bright figures advanced, retreated,\nweaving a way from one arabesque to another. First about the outer rim\nand then in, by spirals and circles. No light except the crimson glowing\nrivulets on the floor, the silver bodies of the Foanna moving back and\nforth, in and out.\n\nThen, suddenly, the three dancers halted, huddled together in an open\nspace between the designs. And Ross was startled by the impression of\nconfusion, doubt, almost despair wafted from them to the Terrans. Back\nacross the patterned floor they came, their hands clasped even as the\nTerrans stood together, and now they fronted the three out of time.\n\n\"Too few ... we are too few....\" she who was the mid one of the trio\nsaid. \"We can not open the Great Door.\"\n\n\"How many do you need?\" Karara's voice was no longer parched,\nfrightened. She might have traveled through fear to a new serenity.\n\nWhy did he think that, Ross wondered fleetingly. Was it because he, too,\nhad had the same release?\n\nThe Polynesian girl loosed her grip on her companions' hands, taking a\nstep closer to the Foanna.\n\n\"Three can be four--\"\n\n\"Or five.\" Ashe moved up beside her. \"If we suit your purpose.\"\n\nWas Gordon Ashe crazy? Or had he fallen victim to whatever filled this\nplace? Yet it was Ashe's voice, sane, serene, as Ross had always heard\nit. The younger Agent wet his lips; it was his turn to have a dry mouth.\nThis was not his game; it could not be. Yet he summoned voice enough to\nadd in turn:\n\n\"Six--\"\n\nWhen it came the Foanna answer was a warning:\n\n\"To aid us you must cast aside your shields, allow your identities to\nbecome one with our forces. Having done so, it may be that you shall\nnever be as you are now but changed.\"\n\n\"Changed....\"\n\nThe word echoed, perhaps not in the place where they stood, but in\nRoss's head. This was a risk such as he had never taken before. His\nchances in the past had been matters of action where his own strength\nand wits were matched against the problem. Here, he would open a door to\nforces he and his kind should not meet--expose himself to danger such as\ndid not exist on the plane where weapons and strength of arm could\ndecide victory or defeat.\n\nAnd this was not really his fight at all. What did it matter to Terrans\nten thousand years or so in the future what happened to Hawaikans in\nthis past? He was a fool; they were all fools to become embroiled in\nthis. The Baldies and their stellar empire--if that ever had existed as\nthe Terrans surmised--was long gone before his breed entered space.\n\n\"If you accomplish this with our aid,\" said Ashe, \"will you be able to\ndefeat the invaders?\"\n\nAgain a lengthening moment of silence before the Foanna replied:\n\n\"We can not tell. We only know that there is a force laid up here, set\nbehind certain gates in the far past, upon which we may call for some\nsupreme effort. But this much we also know: The Evil of the Shadow\nreaches out from here now, and where that darkness falls men will no\nlonger be men but things in the guise of men who obey and follow as\nmindless creatures. As yet this shadow of the Shadow is a small one. But\nit will spread, for that is the nature of those who have spawned it.\nThey have chanced upon and corrupted a thing we know. Such power feeds\nupon the will to power. Having turned it to their bidding, they will not\nbe able to resist using it, for it is so easy to do and the results\nexult the nature of those who employ it.\n\n\"You have said that you and those like you who travel the time trails\nfear to change the past. Here the first steps have been taken to alter\nthe future, but unless we complete the defense it will be ill for all of\nus.\"\n\n\"And this is your only weapon?\" Ashe asked once more.\n\n\"The only one strong enough to stand against that which is now\nunleashed.\"\n\nIn the pavement the fiery lines were bright and glowing. Even when Ross\nshut his eyes, parts of those designs were still visible against his\neyelids.\n\n\"We don't know how.\" He made a last feeble protest on the side of\nprudence. \"We couldn't move as you did.\"\n\n\"Apart, no--together, yes.\"\n\nThe silvery figures were once more swaying, the mist which was their\nhair flowing about them. Karara's hands went out, and the slender\nfingers of one of the Foanna lifted, closed about firm, brown Terran\nflesh. Ashe was doing the same!\n\nRoss thought he cried out, but he could not be sure, as he watched\nKarara's head begin to sway in concert with her Foanna partner, her\nblack hair springing out from her shoulders to rival the rippling\nstrands of the alien's. Ashe was consciously matching steps with the\ncompanion who also drew him along a flowing line of fire.\n\nIn this last instant Ross realized the time for retreat was past--there\nwas no place left to go. His hands went out, though he had to force that\ninvitation because in him there was a shrinking horror of this\nsurrender. But he could not let the others go without him.\n\nThe Foanna's touch was cool, and yet it seemed that flesh met his flesh,\nfingers as normal as his met fingers in that grasp. And when that hold\nwas complete he gave a small gasp. For his horror was wiped away; he\nknew in its place a burst of energy which could be disciplined to use as\na weapon or a tool in concentrated and complicated action. His feet so\n... and then so.... Did those directions flow without words from the\nFoanna's fingers to his and then along his nerves to his brain? He only\nknew which was the proper next step, and the next, and the next, as they\nwove their way along the pattern lines, with their going adding a\nnecessary thread to a design.\n\nForward four steps, backward one--in and out. Did Ross actually hear\nthat sweet thrumming, akin to the lilting speech of the Foanna, or was\nit a throbbing in his blood? In and out.... What had become of the\nothers he did not know; he was aware only of his own path, of the hand\nin his, of the silvery shape at his side to whom he was now tied as if\none of the Rover capture nets enclosed them both.\n\nThe fiery lines under his feet were smoking, tendrils rising and\ntwisting as the hair of the Foanna rippled and twisted. And the smoke\nclung, wreathed his body. They moved in a cocoon of smoke, thicker and\nthicker, until Ross could not even see the Foanna who accompanied him,\nwas only assured of her presence by the hand which grasped his.\n\nAnd a small part of him clung desperately to the awareness of that clasp\nas an anchorage against what might come, a tie between the world of\nreality and the place into which he was passing.\n\nHow did one find words to describe this? Ross wondered with that part of\nhim which remained stubbornly Ross Murdock, Terran Time Agent. He\nthought that he did not see with his eyes, hear with his ears but used\nother senses his own kind did not recognize nor acknowledge.\n\nSpace ... not a room ... a cave-anything made by normal nature. Space\nwhich held something.\n\nPure energy? His Terran mind strove to give name to that which was\nnameless. Perhaps it was that spark of memory and consciousness which\ngave him that instant of \"Seeing.\" Was it a throne? And on it a\nshimmering figure? He was regarded intently, measured, and--set aside.\n\nThere were questions or a question he could not hear, and perhaps an\nanswer he would never be able to understand. Or had any of this happened\nat all?\n\nRoss crouched on a cold floor, his head hanging, drained of energy, of\nall that feeling of power and well-being he had had when they had begun\ntheir dance across the symbols. About him those designs still glowed\ndully. When he looked at them too intently his head ached. He could\nalmost understand, but the struggle was so exhausting he winced at the\neffort.\n\n\"Gordon--?\"\n\nThere was no clasp on his hand; he was alone, alone between two glowing\narabesques. That loneliness struck at him with the sharpness of a blow.\nHis head came up; frantically he stared about him in search of his\ncompanions. \"Gordon!\" His plea and demand in one was answered:\n\n\"Ross?\"\n\nOn his hands and knees, Ross used the rags of his strength to crawl in\nthat direction, stopping now and then to shade his eyes with his hands,\nto peer through the cracks between his fingers for some sight of Ashe.\n\nThere he was, sitting quietly, his head up as if he were listening, or\nstriving to listen. His cheeks were sunken; he had the drained, worn\nlook of a man strained to the limit of physical energy. Yet there was a\nquiet peace in his face. Ross crawled on, put out a hand to Ashe's arm\nas if only by touching the other could he be sure he was not an\nillusion. And Ashe's fingers came up to cover the younger man's in a\ngrasp as tight as the Foanna's hold had been.\n\n\"We did it; together we did it,\" Ashe said. \"But where--why--?\"\n\nThose questions were not aimed at him, Ross knew. And at that moment the\nyounger man did not care where they had been, what they had done. It was\nenough that his terrible loneliness was gone, that Ashe was here.\n\nStill keeping his hold on Ross, Ashe turned his head and called into the\nwilderness of the symbol-glowing space about them, \"Karara?\"\n\nShe came to them, not crawling, not wrung almost dry of spirit and\nstrength, but on her two feet. About her shoulders her dark hair waved\nand spun--or was it dark now? Along those strands there seemed to be\nthreaded motes of light, giving a silvery sheen which was a faint echo\nof the Foanna's tresses. And was it only his bemused and bewildered\nsight, Ross mused, or was her skin fairer?\n\nKarara smiled down at them and held out her hands, offering one to each.\nWhen they took them Ross knew again that surge of energy he had felt\nwhen he had followed the Foanna into the maze dance.\n\n\"Come! There is much to do.\"\n\nHe could not be mistaken; her voice held the singing lilt of the Foanna.\nSomehow she had crossed some barrier to become a paler, perhaps a\nlesser, but still a copy of the three aliens. Was this what they had\nmeant when they warned of a change which might come to those who\nfollowed them into the ritual of this place?\n\nRoss looked from the girl to Ashe with searching intensity. No, he could\nsee no outward change in Gordon. And he felt none within himself.\n\n\"Come!\" Some of Karara's old impetuousness returned as she tugged at\nthem, urging them to their feet and drawing them with her. She appeared\nto know where they must go, and both men followed her guidance.\n\nOnce more they came out of the weird and alien into the normal, for here\nwere the rock walls of a passage running up at an angle which became so\nsteep they were forced to pull along by handholds hollowed in the walls.\n\n\"Where are we going?\" Ashe asked.\n\n\"To cleanse.\" Karara's answer was ambiguous, and she sped along hardly\ntouching the handholds. \"But hurry!\"\n\nThey finished their climb and were in another corridor where patches of\nsunlight came through a pierced wall to dazzle their eyes. This was\nsimilar to the way which had run beside the courtyard in Zahur's castle.\n\nRoss looked out of the first opening down into a courtyard. But where\nZahur's had held the busy life of a castle, this was silent. Silent, but\nnot deserted. There were men below, armed, helmed. He recognized the\nuniform of the Wrecker warriors, saw one or two who wore the gray of the\nFoanna servants. They stood in lines, unmoving, without speech among\nthemselves, men who might have been frozen into immobility and arranged\nso for some game in which they were the voiceless, will-less pieces.\n\nAnd their immobility was a thing to arouse fear. Were they dead and\nstill standing?\n\n\"Come!\" Karara's voice had sunk to a whisper and her hand pulled at the\nmen.\n\n\"What--?\" began Ross.\n\nAshe shook his head. Those rows below drawn up as if in order to march,\nunliving rows. They could not be alive as the Terrans knew life!\n\nRoss left his vantage point, ready to follow Karara. But he could not\nblot from his mind the picture of those lines, nor forget the terrible\nblankness which made their faces more unhuman, more frightenly alien\nthan those of the Foanna.\n\n\n\n\n17\n\nShades Against Shadow\n\n\nThe corridor ended in a narrow slit of room, and the wall before them\nwas not the worked stone of the citadel but a single slab of what\nappeared to be glass curdled into creamy ridges and depressions.\n\nHere were the Foanna, their robes once more cloaking them. Each held,\npoint out, one of the rods. They moved slowly but with the precise\ngestures of those about a demanding and very important task as they\ntraced each depression in the wall before them with the wand points.\nDown, up, around ... as their feet had moved in the dance pattern, so\nnow their wands moved to cover each line.\n\n\"Now!\"\n\nThe wands dropped points to the floor. The Foanna moved equidistant from\none another. Then, as one, the rods were lifted vertically, brought down\ntogether with a single loud tap.\n\nOn the wall the blue lines they had traced with such care darkened,\nmelted. The glassy slab shivered, shattered, fell outward in a lace of\nfragments. So the narrow room became a balcony above a large chamber.\n\nBelow a platform ran the full length of that hall, and on it were\nmounted a line of oval disks. These had been turned to different angles\nand each reflected light, a ray beam directed at them from a machine\nwhose metallic casing, projecting antennae, was oddly out of place here.\n\nOnce more the three staffs of the Foanna raised as one in the air. This\ntime, from the knobs held out over the hall blazed, not the usual whirl\nof small sparks, but strong beams of light--blue light darkening as it\npierced downward until it became thrusting lines of almost tangible\nsubstance.\n\nWhen those blue beams struck the nearest ovals they webbed with lines\nwhich cracked wide open. Shattered bits tinkled down to the platform.\nThere was a stir at the end of the hall where the machine stood. Figures\nran into plain sight. Baldies! Ross cried out a warning as he saw those\nstar men raise weapon tubes aimed at the perch on which the Foanna\nstood.\n\nFire crackling with the speed and sound of lightning lashed up at the\nbalcony. The lances of light met the spears of dark, and there was a\nflash which blinded Ross, a sound which split open the whole world.\n\nThe Terran's eyes opened, not upon darkness but on dazzling light,\nflashes of it which tore over him in great sweeping arcs. Dazed, sick,\nhe tried to press his prone body into the unyielding surface on which he\nlay. But there was no way of burrowing out of this wild storm of light\nand clashing sound. Now under him the very fabric of the floor rocked\nand quivered as if it were being shaken apart into crumbling rubble.\n\nAll the will and ability to move was gone. Ross could only lie there and\nendure. What had happened, he did not know save that what raged about\nhim now was a warring of inimical forces, perhaps both feeding on each\nother even as they strove for mastery.\n\nThe play of rays resembled sword blades crossing, fencing. Ross threw\nhis arm over his eyes to shut out the intolerable brilliance of that\nthrust and counter. His body tingled and winced as the whirlwind of\nenergy clashed and reclashed. He was beaten, stupid, as a man pinned\ndown too long under a heavy shelling.\n\nHow did it end? In one terrific thunderclap of sound and blasting power?\nAnd when did it end--hours ... days later? Time was a thing set apart\nfrom this. Ross lay in the quiet which his body welcomed thirstily. Then\nhe was conscious of the touch of wind on his face, wind carrying the\nhint of sea salt.\n\nHe opened his eyes and saw above him a patch of clouded sky. Shakily he\nlevered himself up on his elbows. There were no complete walls any more,\njust jagged points of masonry, broken teeth set in a skull's jawbone.\nOpen sky, dark clouds spattering rain.\n\n\"Gordon? Karara?\" Ross's voice was a thin whisper. He licked his lips\nand tried again:\n\n\"Gordon!\"\n\nHad there been an answering whimper? Ross crawled into a hollow between\ntwo fallen blocks. A pool of water? No, it was the cloak of one of the\nFoanna spread out across the flooring in this fragment of room. Then\nRoss saw that Ashe was there, the cloaked figure braced against the\nTerran's shoulder as he half supported, half embraced the Foanna.\n\n\"Ynvalda!\" Ashe called that with an urgency which was demanding. Now the\nFoanna moved, raising an arm in the cloak's flowing sleeve.\n\nRoss sat back on his heels.\n\n\"Ross--Ashe?\" He turned his head. Karara stood here, then came forward,\nplanting her feet with care, her hands outstretched, her eyes wide and\nunseeing. Ross pulled himself up and went to her, finding that the once\nsolid floor seemed to dip and sway under him, until he, too, must\nbalance and creep. His hands closed on her shoulders and he pulled her\nto him in mutual support.\n\n\"Gordon?\"\n\n\"Over there. You all right?\"\n\n\"I think so.\" Her voice was weak. \"The Foanna ... Ynlan ... Ynvalda--\"\nSteadying herself against him, she tried to look around.\n\nThe place which had once been a narrow room, then a balcony, was now a\nperch above stomach-turning space. The hall of the oval mirrors was\ngone, having disappeared into a hollow the depths of which were veiled\nby a vapor which boiled and bubbled as if, far below, some huge caldron\nhung above a blazing fire.\n\nKarara cried out and Ross drew her back from that drop. He was\nclearer-headed now and looked about for some way down from this doubtful\nperch. Of the other two Foanna there was no sign. Had they been sucked\nup and out in the inferno they had created with their unleashing of\nenergy against the Baldies' installation?\n\n\"Ross--look!\" Karara's cry, her upflung arm directed his attention\naloft.\n\nUnder the sullen gathering of the storm a sphere arose as a bubble might\nseek the surface of a pool before breaking. A ship--a Baldy ship taking\noff from the ruined citadel! So some of the enemy had survived that\ntrial of strength!\n\nThe globe was small, a scout used for within-atmosphere exploration,\nRoss judged. It arose first, and then moved inland, fleeing the\ngathering storm, to be out of sight in moments. Inland, where the\nmountain base of the invaders was reputed to be. Retreating? Or bound to\ngather reinforcements?\n\n\"Baldies?\" Karara asked.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nShe wiped her hand across her face, smearing dust and grime on her\ncheeks. As raindrops pattered about them, Ross drew the girl with him\ninto the alcove where Ashe sheltered with the Foanna. The cowled alien\nwas sitting up, her hand still gripping one of the wands, now a\nhalf-melted ruin.\n\nAshe glanced at them as if for the first time he remembered they might\nbe there.\n\n\"Baldy ship just took off inland,\" Ross told him. \"We didn't see either\nof the other Foanna.\"\n\n\"They have gone to do what is to be done,\" Ashe's companion replied. \"So\nsome of the enemy fled. Well, perhaps they have learned one lesson, not\nto meddle with others' devices. Ahh, so much gone which will never come\nagain! Never again--\"\n\nShe held up the half-melted wand, turning it back and forth before her,\nbefore she cast it away. It flew out, up, then dropped into the caldron\nof the hall which had been. A gust of rain, cold, chilling the lightly\nclad Terrans, swept across them.\n\nThe Foanna was helped to her feet by Ashe. For a moment she turned\nslowly, giving a lingering look to the ruins. Then she spoke: \"Broken\nstone holds no value. Take hands, my brothers, my sister, it is time we\ngo hence.\"\n\nKarara's hand in Ross's right, Ashe's in his left, and both linked to\nYnvalda in turn. Then--they were indeed elsewhere, in a courtyard where\nbodies lay flaccid under the drenching downpour of the rain. And moving\namong those bodies were the two other Foanna, bending to examine one man\nafter another. Perhaps over one in three they so inspected they held\nconsultation before a wand was used in tracing certain portions of the\nbody between them. When they were finished, that man stirred, moaned,\nshowed signs of life once more.\n\n\"Rosss--!\" From behind a tumbled wall crept a Hawaikan who did not wear\nthe guard armor of the others. Gill-pack, flippers, diver's belt, had\nbeen stripped from him. There was a bleeding gash down the side of his\nface, and he held his left arm against his body, supported by his right\nhand.\n\n\"Baleku!\"\n\nThe Rover pulled himself up to his feet and stood swaying. Ross reached\nhim quickly to catch him as he slumped forward.\n\n\"Loketh?\" the Terran asked.\n\n\"The women-killers took him.\" Somehow the Rover got that out as Ross\nhalf supported, half led him to where the Foanna were gathering those\nthey had been able to revive. \"They wanted to learn\"--Baleku was\nobviously making a great effort to tell his story--\"about ... about\nwhere we came from ... where we got the packs.\"\n\n\"So now they will know of us, or will if they get the story out of\nLoketh.\" Ashe worked with Ross to splint the Rover's broken arm. \"How\nmany of them were here, Baleku?\"\n\nThe Rover's head moved slowly from side to side. \"I do not know in\ntruth. It is--was--like a dream. I was in the water swimming through the\nsea gate. Then suddenly I was in another place where those from the\nstars waited about me. They had our packs and belts and these they\nshowed us, demanding to know whereof these were. Loketh was like one\ndeep in sleep and they left him so when they questioned me. Then there\ncame a great noise and the floor under us shook, lightning flashed\nthrough the air. Two of the women-killers ran from the room and all of\nthem were greatly excited. They took up Loketh and carried him away,\nwith him the packs and other things. And I was left alone, though I\ncould not move--as if they had left me in a net I could not see.\n\n\"More and more were the flashes. Then one of those slayers of women\nstood in the doorway. He raised his hand, and my feet were free, but I\ncould not move otherwise than to follow after him. We came along a hall\nand into this court where men stood unstirring, although stones fell\nfrom the walls upon some of them and the ground shook--\"\n\nBaleku's voice grew shriller, his words ran together. \"The one who\npulled me after him by his will--he cried out and put his hands to his\nhead. Back and forth he ran, bumping into the standing men, and once\nrunning into a wall as if he were blinded. And then he was gone and I\nwas alone. There was more falling stone and one struck my shoulder so I\nwas thrown to the ground. There I lay until you came.\"\n\n\"So few--out of many so few--\" One of the Foanna stood beside them, her\ncloak streaming with the falling rain. \"And for these\"--she faced the\nlines of those they had not revived--\"there was no chance. They died as\nhelplessly as if they went into a meeting of swords with their arms\nbound to their sides! Evil have we wrought here.\"\n\nAshe shook his head. \"Evil has been wrought here, Ynlan, but not by your\nseeking. And those who died here helplessly may be only a small portion\nof those yet to be sacrificed. Have you forgotten the slaughter at Kyn\nAdd and those other fairings where women and children were also struck\ndown to serve some purpose we do not even yet know?\"\n\n\"Lady, Great One--\" Baleku struggled to sit up and Ross slipped an arm\nbehind him in aid. \"She for whom I made a bride-cup was meat for them at\nKyn Add, along with many others. If these slayers are not put to the\nsword's edge, there will be other fairings so used. And these Shadow\nones possess a magic to draw men to them helplessly to be killed. Great\nOne, you have powers; all men know that wind and wave obey your call. Do\nyou now use your magic! It is better to fall with a power we know, than\nanswer such spells as those killers have netted about the men here!\"\n\n\"This is one weapon which they shall not use again.\" Ynvalda rose from a\nstone block where she had been sitting. \"And perhaps in its way it was\none of the most dangerous. But in defeating it we have by so much\nweakened ourselves also. And the strong place of these star men lies not\non the coast, but inland. They will be warned by those who fled this\nplace. Wind and wave, yes, those have served our purpose in the past.\nBut now perhaps we have found that which our power will not best!\nOnly--for this\"--her gesture was for the ruins of the citadel and the\ndead--\"there shall be a payment exacted--to the height of our desire!\"\n\nWhether the Foanna did have any control over the storm winds or not, the\npresent deluge appeared not to accommodate them. The dazed, injured\nsurvivors of the courtyard were brought to shelter in some of the\nunderground passages.\n\nThere appeared to be no other reminders of the Wrecker force which had\nearlier besieged the keep than those survivors. But within hours some of\nthose who had served the Foanna for generations returned. And the Foanna\nthemselves opened the sea gates so that the Rover cruisers anchored in\nthe small bay below their ruined walls.\n\nA small force, and one ill-equipped to go up against the Baldies. Some\nfive star men's bodies had been found in the citadel, but the ship had\ngone off to warn their base. To Ross's thinking the advantage still lay\nwith the invaders.\n\nBut the Hawaikans refused to accept the idea that the odds were against\nthem. As soon as the storm blew out its force Ongal's cruiser headed\nnorthwest to other clan fairings where the Rovers could claim kinship.\nAnd Afrukta sailed on the same errand south. While some of the Wreckers\nwere released to carry the warning to their lords. Just how great a\nforce could be gathered through such means and how effective it would\nbe, was a question to make the Terrans uneasy.\n\nKarara disappeared with the Foanna into the surviving inner\ncliff-burrows below the citadel. But Ashe and Ross remained with Torgul\nand his officers, striving to bring organization out of the chaos about\nthem.\n\n\"We must know just where their lair lies,\" Torgul stated the obvious.\n\"The mountains you believe, and they can fly in sky ships to and from\nthat point. Well\"--he spread out a chart--\"here are the mountains on\nthis island, running so. An army marching hither could be sighted from\nsky ships. Also, there are many mountains. Which is the one or ones we\nmust seek? It may take many tens of days to find that place, while they\nwill always know where we are, watch us from above, prepare for our\ncoming--\"\n\nAgain Ross mentally paid tribute to the Captain's quick grasp of\nessentials.\n\n\"You have a solution, Captain?\" Ashe asked.\n\n\"There is the river--here--\" Torgul said reflectively. \"Perhaps I think\nin terms of water because I am a sailor. But here it does run, and for\nthis far along it our cruisers may ascend.\" He pointed with his finger\ntip. \"This lies, however, in Glicmas's land, and he is now the mightiest\nof the Wrecker lords, his sword always drawn against us. I do not\nbelieve that we could talk him into----\"\n\n\"Glicmas!\" Ross interrupted. They both looked at him inquiringly, and he\nrepeated Loketh's story of the Wrecker lord who had had dealings with a\n\"voice from the mountain\" and so gained the wrecking devices to make him\nthe dominant lord of the district.\n\n\"So!\" Torgul exclaimed. \"That is the evil of this Shadow in the\nmountains! No, under those circumstances I do not think we shall talk\nGlicmas into furthering any raid against those who have made him great\nover his fellows. Rather will he turn against us in their cause.\"\n\n\"And if we do not use the cruisers up the river\"--Ashe conned the\nmap--\"then perhaps a small party or parties working overland could\nstrike the stream here, nearer to the uplands.\"\n\nTorgul frowned at the map. \"I do not think so. Even small parties moving\nin that direction would be sighted by Glicmas's people. The more so if\nthey headed inland. He will not wish to share his secrets with others.\"\n\n\"But, say--a party of Foanna.\"\n\nThe Captain glanced up swiftly to favor Ashe with a keen regard. \"Then\nhe would not dare. No, I am sure he would not dare to interfere. Not yet\nhas he risen high enough to turn the hook of his sword against them. But\nwould the Foanna do so?\"\n\n\"If not the Foanna, then others wearing like robes,\" Ashe said slowly.\n\n\"Others wearing like robes?\" repeated Torgul. Now his frown was heavy.\n\"No man would take on the guise of the Foanna; he would be blasted by\ntheir power for so doing. If the Foanna will lead us in their persons,\nthen we shall follow gladly, knowing that their magic will be with us.\"\n\n\"There is also this,\" Ross broke in. \"The Baldies have the gill-packs\nthey took from Baleku and Loketh, and they have Loketh. They will want\nto learn more about us. We hoped that the citadel would provide bait to\ndraw them and it did. That our plan for a trap there was spoiled was ill\nfortune. But I am sure that if the Baldies believe we are coming to\nthem, they will hold off an all-out attack against our march, hoping to\ngather us in intact. They'd risk that.\"\n\nAshe nodded. \"I agree. We are the unknown they must solve now. And this\nmuch I am sure of--the future of this world and her people balances on a\nvery narrow line of choice. It is my hope that such a choice is still to\nbe made.\"\n\nTorgul smiled thinly. \"We live in perilous times when the Shades require\nour swords to go up against the Shadow!\"\n\n\n\n\n18\n\nWorld in Doubt?\n\n\nThe day was dully overcast as all days had been since they had begun\nthis sulk-and-march penetration into the mountain territory. Ross could\nnot accept the idea that the Foanna might actually command wind and\nwave, storm and sun, as the Hawaikans firmly believed, but the gloomy\nweather _had_ favored them so far. And now they had reached the last\nbreathing point before they took the plunge into the heart of the enemy\ncountry. About the way in which they were to make that plunge, Ross had\nhis own plan. One he did not intend to share with either Ashe or Karara.\nThough he had had to outline it to the one now waiting here with him.\n\n\"This is still your mind, younger brother?\"\n\nHe did not turn his head to look at the cloaked figure. \"It is still my\nmind!\" Ross could be firm on that point.\n\nThe Terran backed out of the vantage place from which he had been\nstudying the canyonlike valley cupping the Baldy spaceship. Now he got\nto his feet and faced Ynlan, his own gray cloak billowing out in the\nwind to reveal the Rover scale armor underneath.\n\n\"You can do it for me?\" he asked in turn. During the past days the\nFoanna had admitted that the weird battle within the citadel had\nweakened and limited their \"magic.\" Last night they had detected a force\nbarrier ahead and to transport the whole party through that by\ntelaporting was impossible.\n\n\"Yes, you alone. Then my wand would be drained for a space. But what can\nyou do within their hold, save be meat for their taking?\"\n\n\"There can not be too many of them left there. That's a small ship. They\nlost five at the citadel, and the Rovers have three prisoners. No sign\nof the scout ship we know they have--so more of them must be gone in it.\nI won't be facing an army. And what they have in the way of weapons may\nbe powered by installations in the ship. A lot of damage done there. Or\neven if the ship lifted--\" He was not sure of what he could do; this was\na venture depending largely on improvisation at the last moment.\n\n\"You propose to send off the ship?\"\n\n\"I don't know whether that is possible. No, perhaps I can only attract\ntheir attention, break through the force shield so the rest may attack.\"\n\nRoss knew that he must attempt this independent action, that in order to\nremain the Ross Murdock he had always been, he must be an actor not a\nspectator.\n\nThe Foanna did not argue with him now. \"Where--?\" Her long sleeve\nrippled as she gestured to the canyon. Dull as the skies were overhead,\nthere was light here--too much of it for his purpose as the ground about\nthe ship was open. To appear there might be fatal.\n\nRoss was grasped by another and much more promising idea. The Foanna had\ntransported them all to the deck of Torgul's cruiser after asking him to\npicture it for her mentally. And to all outward appearances the Baldy\nship before them now was twin to the one which had taken him once on a\nfantastic voyage across a long-vanished stellar empire. Such a ship he\nknew!\n\n\"Can you put me in the ship?\"\n\n\"If you have a good memory of it, yes. But how know you these ships?\"\n\n\"I was in one once for many days. If these are alike, then I know it\nwell!\"\n\n\"And if this is unlike, to try such may mean your death.\"\n\nHe had to accept her warning. Yet outwardly this ship was a duplicate.\nAnd before he had voyaged on the derelict he had also explored a Wrecker\nfreighter on his own world thousands of years before his own race had\nevolved. There was one portion of both ships which had been\nidentical--save for size--and that part was the best for his purpose.\n\n\"Send me--here!\"\n\nWith closed eyes, Ross produced a mental picture of the control cabin.\nThose seats which were not really seats but webbing support swinging\nbefore banks of buttons and levers; all the other installations he had\nwatched, studied, until they were as known to him as the plate bulkheads\nof the cabin below in which he had slept. Very vivid, that memory. He\nfelt the touch of the Foanna's cool fingers on his forehead--then it was\ngone. He opened his eyes.\n\nNo more wind and gloom, he stood directly behind the pilot's web-sling,\nfacing a vista-plate and rows of controls, just as he had stood so many\ntimes in the derelict. He had made it! This was the control cabin of the\nspacer. And it was alive--the faint thrumming in the air, the play of\nlights on the boards.\n\nRoss pulled the cowl of his Foanna cloak up over his head. He had had\ndays to accustom himself to the bulk of the robe, but still its\nswathings were sometimes a hindrance rather than a help. Slowly he\nturned. There were no Baldies here, but the well door to the lower\nlevels was open, and from it came small sounds echoing up the\ncommunication ladder. The ship was occupied.\n\nNot for the first time since he had started on this venture Ross wished\nfor more complete information. Doubtless several of those buttons or\nlevers before him controlled devices which could be the greatest aid to\nhim now. But which and how he did not know. Once in just such a cabin he\nhad meddled and, in activating a long silent installation, had called\nthe attention of the Baldies to their wrecked ship, to the Terrans\nlooting it. Only by the merest chance had the vengeance of the stellar\nspacemen fallen then on the Russian investigators and not on his own\npeople.\n\nHe knew better than to touch anything before the pilot's station, but\nthe banks of controls to one side were concerned with the inner\nwell-being of the ship--and they tempted him. To go it blind was,\nhowever, more of a risk than he dared take. There was one future\nprecaution for him.\n\nFrom a very familiar case beside the pilot's seat Ross gathered up a\ncollection of disks, sorted through them hastily for one which bore a\ncertain symbol on its covering. There was only one of those. Slapping\nthe rest back into their container, Ross pressed a button on the control\nboard.\n\nAgain his guess paid off! Another disk was exposed as a small panel slid\nback. Ross clawed that out of the holder, put in its place the one he\nhad found. Now, if his choice had been correct, the crew who took off in\nthis ship, unless they checked their route tape first, would find\nthemselves heading to another primitive planet and not returning to\nbase. Perhaps exhaustion of fuel might ground them past hope of ever\nregaining their home port again. Next to damaging the ship, which he\ncould not do, this was the best thing to assure that any enemy leaving\nHawaika would not speedily return with a second expeditionary force.\n\nRoss dropped the route disk he had taken out into a pocket on his belt,\nto be destroyed when he had the chance. Now he catfooted across the deck\nto look into the well and listen.\n\nThe walls glowed with a diffused light. From here the Terran could count\nat least four levels under him, with perhaps another. The bottom two\nought to be supplies and general storage. Then the engine room, tech\nlabs above, and next to the control cabin the living quarters.\n\nThrough the fabric of the ship, shivering up his body from the soles of\nhis feet, he could feel the vibration of engines at work. One such must\ncontrol the force field which ringed this canyon, perhaps even powered\nthe weapons the invaders could turn against any assault.\n\nRoss whirled about, his Foanna cloak in a wide swing. There was one\ncontrol which he knew. Yes, again the board was the same as the one he\nwas familiar with. His hand plunged out and down, raking the lever from\none measure point to the very end of the slit in which it moved. Then he\nplanted himself with his back to the wall. Whoever came up the well\nhunting the cause for the failure would be facing the other way. Ross\ncrouched a little, pushing the cape well back on his shoulders to free\nhis arms. There was a feline suppleness in his stance just as a jungle\ncat might wait coming of its prey.\n\nWhat he heard was a shout below, the click of foot-gear on the rungs of\nthe level ladder. Ross's lips drew back in a snarl which was also\nfeline. He thought that would do it! Spacemen were ultra-sensitive to\nany failure in air flow.\n\nWhite head, bare of any hair, thin shoulders a little hunched under the\nblue-green-lavender stuff of the Baldies' uniforms.... Head turning now\nso that the eyes could see the necessary switch. An exclamation from the\nalien and--\n\nBut the Baldy never had a chance to complete that turn, look behind him.\nRoss sprang and struck with the side of his hand. The hairless head\nsnapped forward. His hands already hooked in the other's armpits, the\nTerran heaved the alien up and over onto the deck of the control cabin.\nIt was only when he was about to bind his captive that Ross discovered\nthe Baldy was dead. A blow calculated to stun the alien had been too\nsevere. Breathing a little faster, the Terran rolled the body back and\nhoisted it into the navigator's swing-seat, fastening it with the\ntake-off belts. One down--how many left?\n\nHe had little time to wonder, for before he could reach the well once\nagain there was a call from below--sharp and demanding. The Terran\nsearched his victim, but the Baldy was unarmed.\n\nAgain a shout. Then silence--too complete a silence. How could they have\nguessed trouble so quickly. Unless, unless the Baldies' mental\ncommunication had been at work ... they might even now know their fellow\nwas dead.\n\nBut not how he died. Ross was prepared to grant the Baldies super-Terran\nabilities, but he did not see how they could know what had happened\nhere. They could only suspect danger, not know the form it had taken.\nAnd sooner or later one of them must come to adjust the switch. This\ncould be a duel of patience.\n\nRoss squatted at the edge of the well, trying to make his ears supply\nhim with hints of what might be happening below. Had there been an\nalteration in the volume of vibration? He set his palm flat to the deck,\ntried to deduce the truth. But he could not be sure. That there had been\nsome slight change he was certain.\n\nThey could not wait much longer without making an attempt to reopen the\nair-supply regulator, or could they? Again Ross was hampered by lack of\ninformation. Perhaps the Baldies did not need the same amount of oxygen\nhis own kind depended upon. And if that were true, Ross could be the\nfirst to suffer in playing a waiting game. Well, air was not the only\nthing he could cut off from here, though it had been the first and most\nimportant to his mind. Ross hesitated. Two-edged weapons cut in both\ndirections. But he had to force a countermove from them. He pulled\nanother switch. The control cabin, the whole of the ship, was plunged\ninto darkness.\n\nNo sound from below this time. Ross pictured the interior layout of the\nships he had known. Two levels down to reach the engine room. Could he\ndescend undetected? There was only one way to test that--try it.\n\nHe pulled the Foanna cloak about him, was several rungs down on the\nladder when the glow in the walls came on. An emergency switch? With a\nforward scramble, Ross swung into one of the radiating side corridors.\nThe sliding-door panels along it were all closed; he could detect no\nsounds behind them. But the vibration in the ship's walls had returned\nto its steady beat.\n\nNow the Terran realized the folly of his move. He was more securely\ntrapped here than he had been in the control cabin. There was only one\nway out, up or down the ladder, and the enemy could have that under\nobservation from below. All they would need to do was to use a flamer or\na paralyzing ray such as the one he had turned over to Ashe several days\nago.\n\nRoss inched along to the stairwell. A faint pad of movement, a shadow of\nsound from the ladder. Someone on the way up. Could they mentally detect\nhim, know him for an alien intruder by the broadcast of his thoughts?\nThe Baldies had a certain respect for the Foanna and might desire to\ntake one alive. He drew the robe about him, used it to muffle his figure\ncompletely as the true wearers did.\n\nBut the figure pulling painfully up from rung to rung was no Baldy. The\nlean Hawaikan arms, the thin Hawaikan face, drawn of feature, painfully\nblank of expression--Loketh--under the same dread spell as had held the\nwarriors in the citadel courtyard. Could the aliens be using this\nHawaikan captive as a defense shield, moving up behind him?\n\nLoketh's head turned, those blank eyes regarded Ross. And their depths\nwere troubled, recognition of a sort returning. The Hawaikan threw up\none hand in a beseeching gesture and then went to his knees in the\ncorridor.\n\n\"Great One! Great One!\" The words came from his lips in a breathy hiss\nas he groveled. Then his body went flaccid, and he sprawled face down,\nhis twisted leg drawn up as if he would run but could not.\n\n\"Foanna!\" The one word came out of the walls themselves, or so it\nseemed.\n\n\"Foanna--the wise learn what lies before them when they walk alone in\nthe dark.\" The Hawaikan speech was stilted, accented, but\nunderstandable.\n\nRoss stood motionless. Had they somehow seen him through Loketh's eyes?\nOr had they been alerted merely by the Hawaikan's call? They believed he\nwas one of the Foanna. Well, he would play that role.\n\n\"Foanna!\" Sharper this time, demanding. \"You lie in our hand. Let us\nclasp the fingers tightly and you shall be naught.\"\n\nOut of somewhere the words Karara had chanted in the Foanna temple came\nto Ross--not in her Polynesian tongue but in the English she had\nrepeated. And softening his voice to his best approximation of the\nFoanna singsong Ross sang:\n\n    \"Ye forty thousand gods,\n    Ye gods of sea, of sky--of stars,\" he improvised.\n    \"Ye elders of the gods that are,\n    Ye gods that once were,\n    Ye that whisper, yet that watch by night,\n    Ye that show your gleaming eyes.\"\n\n\"Foanna!\" The summons was on the ragged edge of patience. \"Your tricks\nwill not move our mountains!\"\n\n\"Ye gods of mountains,\" Ross returned, \"of valleys, of Shades and not\nthe Shadow,\" he wove in the beliefs of this world, too. \"Walk now this\nworld, between the stars!\" His confidence was growing. And there was no\nuse in remaining pent in this corridor. He would have to chance that\nthey were not prepared to kill summarily one of the Foanna.\n\nRoss went to the well, went down the ladder slowly, keeping his robe\nabout him. Here at the next level there was a wider space about the\nopening, and three door panels. Behind one must be those he sought. He\nwas buoyed up by a curious belief in himself, almost as if wearing this\nrobe did give him in part the power attributed to the Foanna.\n\nHe laid his hand on the door to his right and sent it snapping back into\nits frame, stepped inside as if he entered here by right.\n\nThere were three Baldies. To his Terran eyes they were all superficially\nalike, but the one seated on a control stool had a cold arrogance in his\nexpression, a pitiless half smile which made Ross face him squarely. The\nTerran longed for one of the Foanna staffs and the ability to use it. To\nspray that energy about this cabin might reduce the Baldy defenses to\nnothing. But now two of the paralyzing tubes were trained on him.\n\n\"You have come to us, Foanna, what have you to offer?\" demanded the\ncommander, if that was his rank.\n\n\"Offer?\" For the first time Ross spoke. \"There is no reason for the\nFoanna to make any offer, slayer of women and children. You have come\nfrom the stars to take, but that does not mean we choose to give.\"\n\nHe felt it now, that inner pulling, twisting in his mind, the willing\nwhich was their more subtle weapon. Once they had almost bent him with\nthat willing because then he had worn their livery, a spacesuit taken\nfrom the wrecked freighter. Now he did not have that chink in his\ndefense. And all that stubborn independence and determination to be\nhimself alone resisted the influence with a fierce inner fire.\n\n\"We offer life to you, Foanna, freedom of the stars. These other dirt\ncreepers are nothing to you, why take you weapons in their cause? You\nare not of the same race.\"\n\n\"Nor are you!\" Ross's hands moved under the envelope of the robe,\nunloosing the two hidden clasps which held it. That bank of controls\nbefore which the commander sat--to silence that would cause trouble. And\nhe depended upon Ynlan. The Rovers should now be massed at either end of\nthe canyon waiting for the force field to fail and let them in.\n\nRoss steadied himself, poised for action. \"We have something for you,\nstar men--\" he tried to hold their attention with words, \"have you not\nheard of the power of the Foanna--that they can command wind and wave?\nThat they can be where they were not in a single movement of the eyelid?\nAnd this is so--behold!\"\n\nIt was the oldest trick in the world, perhaps on any planet. But because\nit was so old maybe it had been forgotten by the aliens. For, as Ross\npointed, those heads did turn for an instant.\n\nHe was in the air, the robe gathered in his arms wide spread as bat\nwings. And then they crashed in a tangle which bore them all back\nagainst the controls. Ross strove to enmesh them in the robe, using the\npressure of his body to slam them all on the buttons and levers of the\nboard. Whether that battering would accomplish his purpose, he could not\ntell. But that he had only these few seconds torn out of time to try, he\nknew, and determined to use them as best he could.\n\nOne of the Baldies had slithered down to the floor and another was\naiming strangely ineffectual blows at him. But the third had wriggled\nfree to bring up a paralyzer. Ross slewed around, dragging the alien he\nheld across his body just as the other fired. But though the fighter\nwent limp and heavy in Ross's hold, the Terran's own right arm fell to\nhis side, his upper chest was numb, and his head felt as if one of the\nRover's boarding axes had clipped it. Ross reeled back and fell, his\nleft hand raking down the controls as he went. Then he lay on the cabin\nfloor and saw the convulsed face of the commander above him, a paralyzer\naiming at his middle.\n\nTo breathe was an effort Ross found torture to endure. The red haze in\nhis head filled all the world. Pain--he strove to flee the pain but was\nheld captive in it. And always the pressure on him kept that agony\nsteady.\n\n\"Let ... be....\" He wanted to scream that. Perhaps he had, but the\npressure continued. Then he forced his eyes open. Ashe--Ashe and one of\nthe Foanna bending over him, Ashe's hands on his chest, pressing,\nrelaxing, pressing again.\n\n\"It is good--\" He knew Ynvalda's voice. Her hand rested lightly on his\nforehead and from that touch Ross drew again the quickening of body and\nspirit he had felt on the dancing floor.\n\n\"How--?\" He began and then changed to--\"Where--?\" For this was not the\nengine room of the spacer. He lay in the open, with sweet, rain-wet wind\nfilling his starved lungs now without Ashe's force aid.\n\n\"It is over,\" Ashe told him, \"all over--for now.\"\n\nBut not until the sun reached the canyon hours later and they sat in\ncouncil, did Ross learn all the tale. Just as he had made his own plan\nfor reaching the spacer, so had Ashe, Karara, and the dolphins worked on\na similar attempt. The river running deep in those mountain gorges had\nprovided a road for the dolphins and they found beneath its surface an\nentrance past the force barrier.\n\n\"The Baldies were so sure of their superiority on this primitive world\nthey set no guards save that field,\" Ashe explained. \"We slipped through\nfive swimmers to reach the ship. And then the field went down, thanks to\nyou.\"\n\n\"So I did help--that much.\" Ross grinned wryly. What had he proven by\nhis sortie? Nothing much. But he was not sorry he had made it. For the\nvery fact he had done it on his own had eased in part that small ache\nwhich was in him now when he looked at Ashe and remembered how it had\nonce been. Ashe might be--always would be--his friend, but the old\ntight-locking comradeship of the Project was behind them, vanished like\nthe time gate.\n\n\"And what will you do with them?\" Ross nodded toward the captives, the\nthree from the ship, two more taken from the small scouting globe which\nhad homed to find their enemies ready for them.\n\n\"We wait,\" Ynvalda said, \"for those on the Rover ship to be brought\nhither. By our laws they deserve death.\"\n\nThe Rovers at that council nodded vigorously, all save Torgul and Jazia.\nThe Rover woman spoke first.\n\n\"They bear the Curse of Phutka heavy on them. To live under such a curse\nis worse than a clean, quick dying. Listen, it has come upon me that\nbetter this curse not only eat them up but be carried by them to rot\nthose who sent them--\"\n\nTogether the Foanna nodded. \"There has been enough of killing,\" said\nYnlan. \"No, warriors, we do not say this because we shrink from rightful\ndeaths. But Jazia speaks the truth in this matter. Let these depart.\nPerhaps they will bear that with them which will convince their leaders\nthat this is not a world they may squeeze in their hands as one crushes\na ripe quaya to eat its seeds. You believe in your cursing, Rovers, then\nlet the fruit of it be made plain beyond the stars!\"\n\nWas this the time to speak of the switched tapes, Ross wondered. No, he\ndid not really believe that the Rover curse or their treatment of the\ncaptives would, either one, influence the star leaders. But, if the\ninvaders did not return to their base, their vanishing might also work\nto keep another expedition from invading Hawaikan skies. Leave it to\nchance, a curse, and time....\n\nSo it was decided.\n\n\"Have we won?\" Ross asked Ashe later.\n\n\"Do you mean, have we changed the future? Who can answer that? They may\nreturn in force, this may have been a step which was taken before. Those\npylons may still stand in the future above a deserted sea and island. We\nshall probably never know.\"\n\nThat was also their own truth. For them also there had been a\nsubstitution of journey tapes by Fate, and this was now their Hawaika.\nRoss Murdock, Gordon Ashe, Karara Trehern, Tino-rau, Taua--five Terrans\nforever lost in time--in the past with a dubious future. Would this be\nthe barren, lotus world, or another now? Yes, no--either. They had found\ntheir key to the mystery out of time, but they could not turn it, and\nthere was no key to the gate which had ceased to exist. Grasp tight the\npresent. Ross looked about him. Yes, the present, which might be very\nsatisfying after all....\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\nSCIENCE FICTION by ANDRE NORTON\n\n\nTHE DEFIANT ANGENTS\n\nOperation Cochise: a carefully planned Western move to colonize a planet\nahead of the Reds.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
