At least, I was. I was sick of\nthe feuding, the worries and the pettiness of the other nineteen\naboard. My stomach heaved at the bad food, the eternal smell of\npeople, and the constant sound of nagging and complaints. For ten lead\npennies, I'd have gotten out into space and tried walking back to\nEarth. Sometimes I thought about doing it without the pennies.\n\nBut I knew I wasn't that tough, in spite of what I looked. I'd been\nbuilt to play fullback, and my questionable brunet beauty had been\nroughed up by the explosion years before as thoroughly as dock\nfighting on all the planets could have done. But sometimes I figured\nall that meant was that there was more of me to hurt, and that I'd had\nmore experience screaming when the anodyne ran out.\n\nAnyhow, whole-wheat pancakes made with sourdough for the ninth\n\"morning\" running was too damned much! I felt my stomach heave over\nagain, took one whiff of the imitation maple syrup, and shoved the\nmess back fast while I got up faster.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was a mistake. Phil Riggs, our scrawny, half-pint meteorologist,\ngrinned nastily and reached for the plate. \"'Smatter, Paul? Don't you\nlike your breakfast? It's good for you--whole wheat contains bran. The\nstaff of life. Man, after that diet of bleached paste....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere's one guy like that in every bunch. The cook was mad at us for\ngriping about his coffee, so our group of scientists on this cockeyed\nSaturn Expedition were getting whole wheat flour as punishment, while\nCaptain Muller probably sat in his cabin chuckling about it. In our\nagreement, there was a clause that we could go over Muller's head on\nsuch things with a unanimous petition--but Riggs had spiked that. The\nidiot liked bran in his flour, even for pancakes!\n\nOr else he was putting on a good act for the fun of watching the rest\nof us suffer.\n\n\"You can take your damned whole wheat and stuff it--\" I started. Then\nI shrugged and dropped it. There were enough feuds going on aboard the\ncranky old _Wahoo_! \"Seen Jenny this morning, Phil?\"\n\nHe studied me insolently. \"She told Doc Napier she had some stuff\ngrowing in hydroponics she wanted to look at. You're wasting your time\non that babe, boy!\"\n\n\"Thanks for nothing,\" I muttered at him, and got out before I really\ndecided on murder. Jenny Sanderson was our expedition biologist. A\nnatural golden blonde, just chin-high on me, and cute enough to earn\nher way through a Ph. D. doing modelling. She had a laugh that would\nmelt a brass statue and which she used too much on Doc Napier, on our\nchief, and even on grumpy old Captain Muller--but sometimes she used\nit on me, when she wanted something. And I never did have much use for\na girl who was the strong independent type where there was a man to do\nthe dirty work, so that was okay.\n\nI suppose it was natural, with only two women among eighteen men for\nmonth after month, but right then I probably liked Doc Napier less\nthan the captain, even. I pulled myself away from the corridor to\nhydroponics, started for observation, and then went on into the\ncubbyhole they gave me for a cabin. On the _Wahoo_, all a man could do\nwas sleep or sit around and think about murder.\n\nWell, I had nobody to blame but myself. I'd asked for the job when I\nfirst heard Dr. Pietro had collected funds and priorities for a trip\nto study Saturn's rings at close hand. And because I'd done some\ntechnical work for him on the Moon, he figured he might as well take\nme as any other good all-around mechanic and technician. He hadn't\nasked me, though--that had been my own stupid idea.\n\nPaul Tremaine, self-cure expert! I'd picked up a nice phobia against\nspace when the super-liner _Lauri Ellu_ cracked up with four hundred\npassengers on my first watch as second engineer. I'd gotten free and\ninto a suit, but after they rescued me, it had taken two years on the\nMoon before I could get up nerve for the shuttle back to Earth. And\nafter eight years home, I should have let well enough alone. If I'd\nknown anything about Pietro's expedition, I'd have wrapped myself in\nmy phobia and loved it.\n\nBut I didn't know then that he'd done well with priorities and only\nfair with funds. The best he could afford was the rental of the old\nEarth-Mars-Venus triangle freighter. Naturally, when the _Wahoo's_\ncrew heard they were slated for what would be at least three years off\nEarth without fancy bonus rates, they quit. Since nobody else would\nsign on, Pietro had used his priorities to get an injunction that\nforced them back aboard. He'd stuffed extra oxygen, water, food and\nfertilizer on top of her regular supplies, then, filled her holds with\nsome top level fuel he'd gotten from a government assist, and set\nout. And by the time I found out about it, my own contract was\niron-bound, and I was stuck.\n\nAs an astrophysicist, Pietro was probably tops. As a man to run the\nLunar Observatory, he was a fine executive. But as a man to head up an\nexpedition into deep space, somebody should have given him back his\nteething ring.\n\nNot that the _Wahoo_ couldn't make the trip with the new fuel; she'd\nbeen one of the early survey ships before they turned her into a\nfreighter. But she was meant for a crew of maybe six, on trips of a\ncouple of months. There were no game rooms, no lounges, no bar or\nlibrary--nothing but what had to be. The only thing left for most of\nus aboard was to develop our hatreds of the petty faults of the\nothers. Even with a homogeneous and willing crew, it was a perfect\nset-up for cabin fever, and we were as heterogeneous as they came.\n\nNaturally the crew hated the science boys after being impressed into\nduty, and also took it out on the officers. The officers felt the same\nabout both other groups. And the scientists hated the officers and\ncrew for all the inconveniences of the old _Wahoo_. Me? I was in\nno-man's land--technically in the science group, but without a pure\nscience degree; I had an officer's feelings left over from graduating\nas an engineer on the ships; and I looked like a crewman.\n\nIt cured my phobia, all right. After the first month out, I was too\ndisgusted to go into a fear funk. But I found out it didn't help a bit\nto like space again and know I'd stay washed up as a spaceman.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe'd been jinxed from the start. Two months out, the whole crew of\nscientists came down with something Doc Napier finally diagnosed as\nfood poisoning; maybe he was right, since our group ate in our own\nmess hall, and the crew and officers who didn't eat with us didn't get\nit. Our astronomer, Bill Sanderson, almost died. I'd been lucky, but\nthen I never did react to things much. There were a lot of other small\ntroubles, but the next major trick had been fumes from the nuclear\ngenerators getting up into our quarters--it was always our group that\nhad the trouble. If Eve Nolan hadn't been puttering with some of her\ntrick films at the time--she and Walt Harris had the so-called night\nshift--and seen them blacken, we'd have been dead before they\ndiscovered it. And it took us two weeks of bunking with the sullen\ncrew and decontamination before we could pick up life again. Engineer\nWilcox had been decent about helping with it, blaming himself. But it\nhad been a mess.\n\nNaturally, there were dark hints that someone was trying to get us;\nbut I couldn't see any crewman wiping us out just to return to Earth,\nwhere our contract, with its completion clause, would mean he wouldn't\nhave a dime coming to him. Anyhow, the way things were going, we'd all\ngo berserk before we reached Saturn.\n\nThe lunch gong sounded, but I let it ring. Bullard would be serving us\nwhole wheat biscuits and soup made out of beans he'd let soak until\nthey turned sour. I couldn't take any more of that junk, the way I\nfelt then. I heard some of the men going down the corridor, followed\nby a confused rumble of voices. Then somebody let out a yell. \"Hey,\n_rooob_!\"\n\nThat meant something. The old yell spacemen had picked up from carney\npeople to rally their kind around against the foe. And I had a good\nidea of who was the foe. I heard the yell bounce down the passage\nagain, and the slam of answering feet.\n\nThen the gravity field went off. Or rather, was cut off. We may have\nmissed the boat in getting anti-gravity, if there is such a thing, but\nour artificial gravity is darned near foolproof.\n\nIt was ten years since I'd moved in free fall, but Space Tech had done\na good job of training good habits. I got out of my bunk, hit the\ncorridor with a hand out, bounced, kicked, and dove toward the mess\nhall without a falter. The crewmen weren't doing so well--but they\nwere coming up the corridor fast enough.\n\nI could have wrung Muller's neck. Normally, in case of trouble,\ncutting gravity is smart. But not here, where the crew already wanted\na chance to commit mayhem, and had more experience than the\nscientists.\n\nYet, surprisingly, when I hit the mess hall ten feet ahead of the\ndeckhands, most of the scientists were doing all right. Hell, I should\nhave known Pietro, Sanderson and a couple others would be used to\nno-grav; in astronomical work, you cut your eye teeth on that. They\nwere braced around the cook, who huddled back in a corner, while our\npurser-steward, Sam, was still singing for help.\n\nThe fat face of the cook was dead white. Bill Sanderson, looking like\na slim, blond ballet dancer and muscled like an apache expert, had him\nin one hand and was stuffing the latest batch of whole wheat biscuits\ndown his throat. Bill's sister, Jenny, was giggling excitedly and\nholding more biscuits.\n\nThe deckhands and Grundy, the mate, were almost at the door, and I had\njust time enough to slam it shut and lock it in their faces. I meant\nto enjoy seeing the cook taken down without any interruption.\n\nSam let out a final yell, and Bullard broke free, making a mess of it\nwithout weight. He was sputtering out bits of the biscuit. Hal Lomax\nreached out a big hand, stained with the chemicals that had been his\nlife's work, and pushed the cook back.\n\nAnd suddenly fat little Bullard switched from quaking fear to a blind\nrage. The last of the biscuit sailed from his mouth and he spat at\nHal. \"You damned hi-faluting black devil. You--_you_ sneering at my\ncooking. I'm a white man, I am--I don't have to work for no black\nni....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI reached him first, though even Sam started for him then. You can\ndeliver a good blow in free-fall, if you know how. His teeth against\nmy knuckles stopped my leap, and the back of his head bounced off the\nwall. He was unconscious as he drifted by us, moving upwards. My\nknuckles stung, but it had been worth it. Anyhow, Jenny's look more\nthan paid for the trouble.\n\nThe door shattered then, and the big hulk of Mate Grundy tumbled in,\nwith the two deckhands and the pair from the engine room behind him.\nSam let out a yell that sounded like protest, and they headed for\nus--just as gravity came on.\n\nI pulled myself off the floor and out from under Bullard to see the\nstout, oldish figure of Captain Muller standing in the doorway, with\nEngineer Wilcox slouched easily beside him, looking like the typical\nnatty space officer you see on television. Both held gas guns.\n\n\"All right, break it up!\" Muller ordered. \"You men get back to your\nwork. And you, Dr. Pietro--my contract calls for me to deliver you to\nSaturn's moon, but it doesn't forbid me to haul you the rest of the\nway in irons. I won't have this aboard my ship!\"\n\nPietro nodded, his little gray goatee bobbing, his lean body coming\nupright smoothly. \"Quite right, Captain. Nor does it forbid me to let\nyou and your men spend the sixteen months on the moon--where _I_\ncommand--in irons. Why don't you ask Sam what happened before you make\na complete fool of yourself, Captain Muller?\"\n\nSam gulped and looked at the crew, but apparently Pietro was right;\nthe little guy had been completely disgusted by Bullard. He shrugged\napologetically. \"Bullard insulted Dr. Lomax, sir. I yelled for someone\nto help me get him out of here, and I guess everybody got all mixed up\nwhen gravity went off, and Bullard cracked his head on the floor. Just\na misunderstanding, sir.\"\n\nMuller stood there, glowering at the cut on my knuckles, and I could\nfeel him aching for a good excuse to make his threat a reality. But\nfinally, he grunted and swung on his heel, ordering the crew with him.\nGrundy threw us a final grimace and skulked off behind him. Finally\nthere was only Wilcox, who grinned, shrugged, and shut the door\nquietly behind him. And we were left with the mess free-fall had made\nof the place.\n\nI spotted Jenny heading across the room, carefully not seeing the\nfatuous glances Pietro was throwing her way, and I swung in behind.\nShe nodded back at me, but headed straight for Lomax, with an odd look\non her face. When she reached him, her voice was low and businesslike.\n\n\"Hal, what did those samples of Hendrix's show up?\"\n\nHendrix was the Farmer, in charge of the hydroponics that turned the\ncarbon dioxide we breathed out back to oxygen, and also gave us a bit\nof fresh vegetables now and then. Technically, he was a crewman, just\nas I was a scientist; but actually, he felt more like one of us.\n\nLomax looked surprised. \"What samples, Jenny? I haven't seen Hendrix\nfor two weeks.\"\n\n\"You--\" She stopped, bit her lip, and frowned. She swung on me. \"Paul,\nhave you seen him?\"\n\nI shook my head. \"Not since last night. He was asking Eve and Walt to\nwake him up early, then.\"\n\n\"That's funny. He was worried about the plants yesterday and wanted\nHal to test the water and chemical fertilizer. I looked for him this\nmorning, but when he didn't show up, I thought he was with you, Hal.\nAnd--the plants are dying!\"\n\n\"All of them?\" The half smile wiped off Hal's face, and I could feel\nmy stomach hit my insteps. When anything happens to the plants in a\nship, it isn't funny.\n\nShe shook her head again. \"No--about a quarter of them. I was coming\nfor help when the fight started. They're all bleached out. And it\nlooks like--like chromazone!\"\n\nThat really hit me. They developed the stuff to fight off fungus on\nVenus, where one part in a billion did the trick. But it was tricky\nstuff; one part in ten-million would destroy the chlorophyll in\nplants in about twenty hours, or the hemoglobin in blood in about\nfifteen minutes. It was practically a universal poison.\n\nHal started for the door, then stopped. He glanced around the room,\nturned back to me, and suddenly let out a healthy bellow of seeming\namusement. Jenny's laugh was right in harmony. I caught the drift, and\ntried to look as if we were up to some monkey business as we slipped\nout of the room. Nobody seemed suspicious.\n\nThen we made a dash for hydroponics, toward the rear of the ship. We\nscrambled into the big chamber together, and stopped. Everything\nlooked normal among the rows of plant-filled tanks, pipes and\nequipment. Jenny led us down one of the rows and around a bend.\n\nThe plants in the rear quarter weren't sick--they were dead. They were\nbleached to a pale yellow, like boiled grass, and limp. Nothing would\nsave them now.\n\n\"I'm a biologist, not a botanist--\" Jenny began.\n\nHal grunted sickly. \"Yeah. And I'm not a life hormone expert. But\nthere's one test we can try.\"\n\nHe picked up a pair of rubber gloves from a rack, and pulled off some\nwilted stalks. From one of the healthy tanks, he took green leaves. He\nmashed the two kinds together on the edge of a bench and watched. \"If\nit's chromazone, they've developed an enzyme by now that should eat\nthe color out of those others.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn about ten seconds, I noticed the change. The green began to bleach\nbefore my eyes.\n\nJenny made a sick sound in her throat and stared at the rows of\nhealthy plants. \"I checked the valves, and this sick section is\nisolated. But--if chromazone got into the chemicals.... Better get your\nspectroanalyzer out, Hal, while I get Captain Muller. Paul, be a dear\nand find Hendrix, will you?\"\n\nI shook my head, and went further down the rows. \"No need, Jenny,\" I\ncalled back. I pointed to the shoe I'd seen sticking out from the edge\nof one of the tanks. There was a leg attached.\n\nI reached for it, but Lomax shoved me back. \"Don't--the enzymes in the\ncorpse are worse than the poison, Paul. Hands off.\" He reached down\nwith the gloves and heaved. It was Hendrix, all right--a corpse with a\nface and hands as white as human flesh could ever get. Even the lips\nwere bleached out.\n\nJenny moaned. \"The fool! The stupid fool. He _knew_ it was dangerous\nwithout gloves; he suspected chromazone, even though none's supposed\nto be on board. And I warned him . . .\"\n\n\"Not against this, you didn't,\" I told her. I dropped to my knees and\ntook another pair of gloves. Hendrix's head rolled under my grasp. The\nskull was smashed over the left eye, as if someone had taken a\nsideswipe at Hendrix with a hammer. No fall had produced that. \"You\nshould have warned him about his friends. Must have been killed, then\ndumped in there.\"\n\n\"Murder!\" Hal bit the word out in disgust. \"You're right, Paul. Not\ntoo stupid a way to dispose of the body, either--in another couple of\nhours, he'd have started dissolving in that stuff, and we'd never have\nguessed it was murder. That means this poisoning of the plants wasn't\nan accident. Somebody poisoned the water, then got worried when there\nwasn't a report on the plants; must have been someone who thought it\nworked faster on plants than it does. So he came to investigate, and\nHendrix caught him fooling around. So he got killed.\"\n\n\"But who?\" Jenny asked.\n\nI shrugged sickly. \"Somebody crazy enough--or desperate enough to turn\nback that he'll risk our air and commit murder. You'd better go after\nthe captain while Hal gets his test equipment. I'll keep watch here.\"\n\nIt didn't feel good in hydroponics after they left. I looked at those\ndead plants, trying to figure whether there were enough left to keep\nus going. I studied Hendrix's body, trying to tell myself the murderer\nhad no reason to come back and try to get me.\n\nI reached for a cigarette, and then put the pack back. The air felt\nalmost as close as the back of my neck felt tense and unprotected. And\ntelling myself it was all imagination didn't help--not with what was\nin that chamber to keep me company.\n\n\nII\n\nMuller's face was like an iceberg when he came down--but only after he\nsaw Hendrix. Before then I'd caught the fat moon-calf expression on\nhis face, and I'd heard Jenny giggling. Damn it, they'd taken enough\ntime. Hal was already back, fussing over things with the hunk of tin\nand lenses he treated like a newborn baby.\n\nDoc Napier came in behind them, but separately. I saw him glance at\nthem and look sick. Then both Muller and Napier began concentrating on\nbusiness. Napier bent his nervous, bony figure over the corpse, and\nstood up almost at once. \"Murder all right.\"\n\n\"So I guessed, Dr. Napier,\" Muller growled heavily at him. \"Wrap him\nup and put him between hulls to freeze. We'll bury him when we land.\nTremaine, give a hand with it, will you?\"\n\n\"I'm not a laborer, Captain Muller!\" Napier protested. I started to\ntell him where he could get off, too.\n\nBut Jenny shook her head at us. \"Please. Can't you see Captain Muller\nis trying to keep too many from knowing about this? I should think\nyou'd be glad to help. Please?\"\n\nPut that way, I guess it made sense. We found some rubber sheeting in\none of the lockers, and began wrapping Hendrix in it; it wasn't\npleasant, since he was beginning to soften up from the enzymes he'd\nabsorbed. \"How about going ahead to make sure no one sees us?\" I\nsuggested to Jenny.\n\nMuller opened his mouth, but Jenny gave one of her quick little laughs\nand opened the door for us. Doc looked relieved. I guessed he was\ntrying to kid himself. Personally, I wasn't a fool--I was just hooked;\nI knew perfectly well she was busy playing us off against one another,\nand probably having a good time balancing the books. But hell, that's\nthe way life runs.\n\n\"Get Pietro up here!\" Muller fired after us. She laughed again, and\nnodded. She went with us until we got to the 'tween-hulls lock, then\nwent off after the chief. She was back with him just as we finished\nstuffing Hendrix through and sealing up again.\n\nMuller grunted at us when we got back, then turned to Lomax again. The\nbig chemist didn't look happy. He spread his hands toward us, and\nhunched his shoulders. \"A fifty-times over-dose of chromazone in those\ntanks--fortunately none in the others. And I can't find a trace of it\nin the fertilizer chemicals or anywhere else. Somebody deliberately\nput it into those tanks.\"\n\n\"Why?\" Pietro asked. We'd filled him in with the rough details, but it\nstill made no sense to him.\n\n\"Suppose you tell me, Dr. Pietro,\" Muller suggested. \"Chromazone is a\npoison most people never heard of. One of the new _scientific_\nnuisances.\"\n\nPietro straightened, and his goatee bristled. \"If you're hinting . . .\"\n\n\"I am _not_ hinting, Dr. Pietro. I'm telling you that I'm confining\nyour group to their quarters until we can clean up this mess, distil\nthe water that's contaminated, and replant. After that, if an\ninvestigation shows nothing, I _may_ take your personal bond for the\nconduct of your people. Right now I'm protecting my ship.\"\n\n\"But captain--\" Jenny began.\n\nMuller managed a smile at her. \"Oh, not you, of course, Jenny. I'll\nneed you here. With Hendrix gone, you're the closest thing we have to\na Farmer now.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Captain Muller,\" Pietro said sharply. \"Captain, in the words of the\nhistorical novelists--drop dead! Dr. Sanderson, I forbid you to leave\nyour quarters so long as anyone else is confined to his. I have ample\nauthority for that.\"\n\n\"Under emergency powers--\" Muller spluttered over it, and Pietro\njumped in again before he could finish.\n\n\"Precisely, Captain. Under emergency situations, when passengers\naboard a commercial vessel find indications of total irresponsibility\nor incipient insanity on the part of a ship's officer, they are\nconsidered correct in assuming command for the time needed to protect\ntheir lives. We were poisoned by food prepared in your kitchen, and\nwere nearly killed by radioactivity through a leak in the\nengine-room--and no investigation was made. We are now confronted with\nanother situation aimed against our welfare--as the others were wholly\naimed at us--and you choose to conduct an investigation against our\ngroup only. My only conclusion is that you wish to confine us to\nquarters so we cannot find your motives for this last outrage. Paul,\nwill you kindly relieve the captain of his position?\"\n\nThey were both half right, and mostly wrong. Until it was proved that\nour group was guilty, Muller couldn't issue an order that was\nobviously discriminatory and against our personal safety in case there\nwas an attack directed on us. He'd be mustered out of space and into\nthe Lunar Cells for that. But on the other hand, the \"safety for\npassengers\" clause Pietro was citing applied only in the case of\novert, direct and physical danger by an officer to normal passengers.\nHe might be able to weasel it through a court, or he might be found\nguilty of mutiny. It left me in a pretty position.\n\nJenny fluttered around. \"Now, now--\" she began.\n\nI cut her off. \"Shut up, Jenny. And you two damned fools cool down.\nDamn it, we've got an emergency here all right--we may not have air\nplants enough to live on. Pietro, we can't run the ship--and neither\ncan Muller get through what's obviously a mess that may call for all\nour help by confining us. Why don't you two go off and fight it out in\nperson?\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nSurprisingly, Pietro laughed. \"I'm afraid I'd put up a poor showing\nagainst the captain, Paul. My apologies, Captain Muller.\"\n\nMuller hesitated, but finally took Pietro's hand, and dropped the\nissue.\n\n\"We've got enough plants,\" he said, changing the subject. \"We'll have\nto cut out all smoking and other waste of air. And I'll need Jenny to\nwork the hydroponics, with any help she requires. We've got to get\nmore seeds planted, and fast. Better keep word of this to ourselves.\nWe--\"\n\nA shriek came from Jenny then. She'd been busy at one of the lockers\nin the chamber. Now she began ripping others open and pawing through\nthings inside rubber-gloves. \"Captain Muller! The seeds! The seeds!\"\n\nHal took one look, and his face turned gray.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Chromazone,\" he reported. \"Every bag of seed has been filled with a\nsolution of chromazone! They're worthless!\"\n\n\"How long before the plants here will seed?\" Muller asked sharply.\n\n\"Three months,\" Jenny answered. \"Captain Muller, what are we going to\ndo?\"\n\nThe dour face settled into grim determination. \"The only sensible\nthing. Take care of these plants, conserve the air, and squeeze by\nuntil we can reseed. And, Dr. Pietro, with your permission, we'll turn\nabout for Earth at once. We can't go on like this. To proceed would be\nto endanger the life of every man aboard.\"\n\n\"Please, Danton.\" Jenny put her hand on Pietro's arm. \"I know what\nthis all means to you, but--\"\n\nPietro shook her off. \"It means the captain's trying to get out of the\nexpedition, again. It's five months back to Earth--more, by the time\nwe kill velocity. It's the same to Saturn. And either way, in five\nmonths we've got this fixed up, or we're helpless. Permission to\nreturn refused, Captain Muller.\"\n\n\"Then if you'll be so good as to return to your own quarters,\" Muller\nsaid, holding himself back with an effort that turned his face red,\n\"we'll start clearing this up. And not a word of this.\"\n\nNapier, Lomax, Pietro and I went back to the scientists' quarters,\nleaving Muller and Jenny conferring busily. That was at fifteen\no'clock. At sixteen o'clock, Pietro issued orders against smoking.\n\nDinner was at eighteen o'clock. We sat down in silence. I reached for\nmy plate without looking. And suddenly little Phil Riggs was on his\nfeet, raving. \"Whole wheat! Nothing but whole wheat bread! I'm sick of\nit--sick! I won't--\"\n\n\"Sit down!\" I told him. I'd bitten into one of the rolls on the table.\nIt was white bread, and it was the best the cook had managed so far.\nThere was corn instead of baked beans, and he'd done a fair job of\nmaking meat loaf. \"Stop making a fool of yourself, Phil.\"\n\nHe slumped back, staring at the white bun into which he'd bitten.\n\"Sorry. Sorry. It's this air--so stuffy. I can't breathe. I can't see\nright--\"\n\nPietro and I exchanged glances, but I guess we weren't surprised.\nAmong intelligent people on a ship of that size, secrets wouldn't\nkeep. They'd all put bits together and got part of the answer. Pietro\nshrugged, and half stood up to make an announcement.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Beg pardon, sirs.\" We jerked our heads around to see Bullard standing\nin the doorway.\n\nHe was scared stiff, and his words got stuck in his throat. Then he\nfound his voice again. \"I heard as how Hendrix went crazy and poisoned\nthe plants and went and killed himself and we'll all die if we don't\nfind some trick, and what I want to know, please, sirs, is are what\nthey're saying right and you know all kinds of tricks and can you save\nus because I can't go on like this not knowing and hearing them\ntalking outside the galley and none of them telling me--\"\n\nLomax cut into his flood of words. \"You'll live, Bullard. Farmer\nHendrix did get killed in an accident to some of the plants, but we've\nstill got air enough. Captain Muller has asked the help of a few of\nus, but it's only a temporary emergency.\"\n\nBullard stared at him, and slowly some of the fear left his\nface--though not all of it. He turned and left with a curt bow of his\nhead, while Pietro added a few details that weren't exactly lies to\nLomax's hasty cover-up, along with a grateful glance at the chemist.\nIt seemed to work, for the time being--at least enough for Riggs to\nbegin making nasty remarks about cooked paste.\n\nThen the tension began to build again. I don't think any of the crew\ntalked to any of our group. And yet, there seemed to be a chain of\nrumor that exchanged bits of information. Only the crew could have\nseen the dead plants being carried down to our refuse breakdown plant;\nand the fact it was chromazone poisoning must have been deduced from a\ndescription by some of our group. At any rate, both groups knew all\nabout it--and a little bit more, as was usual with rumors--by the\nsecond day.\n\nMuller should have made the news official, but he only issued an\nannouncement that the danger was over. When Peters, our\nradioman-navigator, found Sam and Phil Riggs smoking and dressed them\ndown, it didn't make Muller's words seem too convincing. I guessed\nthat Muller had other things on his mind; at least he wasn't in his\ncabin much, and I didn't see Jenny for two whole days.\n\nMy nerves were as jumpy as those of the rest. It isn't too bad cutting\nout smoking; a man can stand imagining the air is getting stale; but\nwhen every unconscious gesture toward cigarettes that aren't there\nreminds him of the air, and when every imagined stale stench makes him\nwant a cigarette to relax, it gets a little rough.\n\nMaybe that's why I was in a completely rotten mood when I finally did\nspot Jenny going down the passage, with the tight coveralls she was\nwearing emphasizing every motion of her hips. I grabbed her and swung\nher around. \"Hi, stranger. Got time for a word?\"\n\nShe sort of brushed my hand off her arm, but didn't seem to mind it.\n\"Why, I guess so, Paul. A little time. Captain Muller's watching the\n'ponics.\"\n\n\"Good,\" I said, trying to forget Muller. \"Let's make it a little more\nprivate than this, though. Come on in.\"\n\nShe lifted an eyebrow at the open door of my cabin, made with a little\ngiggle, and stepped inside. I followed her, and kicked the door shut.\nShe reached for it, but I had my back against it.\n\n\"Paul!\" She tried to get around me, but I wasn't having any. I pushed\nher back onto the only seat in the room, which was the bunk. She got\nup like a spring uncoiling. \"Paul Tremaine, you open that door. You\nknow better than that. Paul, please!\"\n\n\"What makes me any different than the others? You spend plenty of time\nin Muller's cabin--and you've been in Pietro's often enough. Probably\nDoc Napier's, too!\"\n\nHer eyes hardened, but she decided to try the patient and\nreason-with-the-child line. \"That is different. Captain Muller and I\nhave a great deal of business to work out.\"\n\n\"Sure. And he looks great in lipstick!\"\n\nIt was a shot in the dark, but it went home. I wished I'd kept my\ndarned mouth shut; before I'd been suspecting it--now I knew. She\nturned pink and tried to slap me, which won't work when the girl is\nsitting on a bunk and I'm on my feet. \"You mind your own business!\"\n\n\"I'm doing that. Generations should stick together, and he's old\nenough to be your father!\"\n\nShe leaned back and studied me. Then she smiled slowly, and something\nabout it made me sick inside. \"I like older men, Paul. They make\npeople my own age seem so callow, so unfinished. It's so comforting to\nhave mature people around. I always did have an Electra complex.\"\n\n\"The Greeks had plenty of names for it, kid,\" I told her. \"Don't get\nme wrong. If you want to be a slut, that's your own business. But when\nyou pull the innocent act on me, and then fall back to sophomore\npsychology--\"\n\nThis time she stood up before she slapped. Before her hand stung my\nface, I was beginning to regret what I'd said. Afterwards, I didn't\ngive a damn. I picked her up off the floor, slapped her soundly on the\nrump, pulled her tight against me, and kissed her. She tried\nscratching my face, then went passive, and wound up with one arm\naround my neck and the other in the hair at the back of my head. When\nI finally put her down she sank back onto the bunk, breathing heavily.\n\n\"Why, Paul!\" And she reached out her arms as I came down to meet them.\nFor a second, the world looked pretty good.\n\nThen a man's hoarse scream cut through it all, with the sound of heavy\nsteps in panic flight. I jerked up. Jenny hung on. \"Paul.... Paul....\"\nBut there was the smell of death in the air, suddenly. I broke free\nand was out into the corridor. The noise seemed to come from the shaft\nthat led to the engine room, and I jumped for it, while I heard doors\nslam.\n\nThis time, there was a commotion, like a wet sack being tossed around\nin a pentagonal steel barrel, and another hoarse scream that cut off\nin the middle to a gargling sound.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI reached the shaft and started down the center rail, not bothering\nwith the hand-grips. I could hear something rustle below, followed by\nsilence, but I couldn't see a thing; the lights had been cut.\n\nI could feel things poking into my back before I landed; I always get\nthe creeps when there's death around, and that last sound had been\njust that--somebody's last sound. I _knew_ somebody was going to kill\nme before I could find the switch. Then I stumbled over something, and\nmy hair stood on end. I guess my own yell was pretty horrible. It\nscared me worse than I was already. But my fingers found the switch\nsomehow, and the light flashed on.\n\nSam lay on the floor, with blood still running from a wide gash\nacross his throat. A big kitchen knife was still stuck in one end of\nthe horrible wound. And one of his fingers was half sliced off where\nthe blade of a switch-blade shiv had failed on him and snapped back.\n\nSomething sounded above me, and I jerked back. But it was Captain\nMuller, coming down the rail. The man had obviously taken it all in on\nthe way down. He jerked the switch-blade out of Sam's dead grasp and\nlooked at the point of the knife. There was blood further back from\nthe cut finger, but none on the point.\n\n\"Damn!\" Muller tossed it down in disgust. \"If he'd scratched the other\nman, we'd have had a chance to find who it was. Tremaine, have you got\nan alibi?\"\n\n\"I was with Jenny,\" I told him, and watched his eyes begin to hate me.\nBut he nodded. We picked Sam up together and lugged his body up to the\ntop of the shaft, where the crowd had collected. Pietro, Peters, the\ncook, Grundy and Lomax were there. Beyond them, the dark-haired,\nalmost masculine head of Eve Nolan showed, her eyes studying the body\nof Sam as if it were a negative in her darkroom; as usual, Bill\nSanderson was as close to her as he could get. But there was no sign\nnow of Jenny. I glanced up the corridor but saw only Wilcox and Phil\nRiggs, with Walt Harris trailing them, rubbing the sleep out of his\neyes.\n\nMuller moved directly to Pietro. \"Six left in my crew now, Dr. Pietro.\nFirst Hendrix, now Sam. Can you still say that the attack is on _your_\ncrew--when mine keep being killed? This time, sir, I demand . . .\"\n\n\"Give 'em hell, Captain,\" ape-man Grundy broke in. \"Cut the fancy\nstuff, and let's get the damned murdering rats!\"\n\nMuller's eyes quartered him, spitted his carcass, and began turning\nhim slowly over a bed of coals. \"Mister Grundy, I am master of the\n_Wahoo_. I fail to remember asking for your piratical advice. Dr.\nPietro, I trust you will have no objections if I ask Mr. Peters to\ninvestigate your section and group thoroughly?\"\n\n\"None at all, Captain Muller,\" Pietro answered. \"I trust Peters. And I\nfeel sure you'll permit me to delegate Mr. Tremaine to inspect the\nremainder of the ship?\"\n\nMuller nodded curtly. \"Certainly. Until the madman is found, we're all\nin danger. And unless he is found, I insist I must protect my crew and\nmy ship by turning back to Earth.\"\n\n\"I cannot permit that, sir!\"\n\n\"Your permission for that was not requested, Dr. Pietro! Yes,\nBullard?\"\n\nThe cook had been squirming and muttering to himself for minutes. Now\nhe darted out toward Grundy, and his finger pointed to Lomax. \"He done\nit! I seen him. Killed the only friend I had, he did. They went by my\ngalley--and--and he grabbed my big knife, that one there. And he\nkilled Sam.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You're sure it was Lomax?\" Muller asked sharply.\n\n\"Sure I'm sure. Sam, he was acting queer lately. He was worried. Told\nme he saw something, and he was going to know for sure. He borrowed my\nswitch-blade knife that my wife gave me. And he went out looking for\nsomething. Then I heard him a-running, and I looked up, and there was\nthis guy, chasing him. Sure, I seen him with my own eyes.\"\n\nEve Nolan chuckled throatily, throwing her mannish-cut hair back from\nher face. She was almost pretty with an expression on her countenance,\neven if it was amused disgust. \"Captain Muller, that's a nice story.\nBut Dr. Lomax was with me in my darkroom, working on some\nspectroanalysis slides. Bill Sanderson and Phil Riggs were waiting\noutside for us. And Mr. Peters saw us come out together when we all\nran down here.\"\n\nPeters nodded. Muller stared at us for a second, and the hunting lust\ndied out of his eyes, leaving them blank and cold. He turned to\nBullard. \"Bullard, an explanation might make me reduce your\npunishment. If you have anything to say, say it now!\"\n\nThe cook was gibbering and actually drooling with fear. He shook, and\nsweat popped out all over him. \"My knife--I hadda say something. They\nstole my knife. They wanted it to look like I done it. God, Captain,\nyou'da done the same. Can't punish a man for trying to save his life.\nI'm a good man, I am. Can't whip a good man! Can't--\"\n\n\"Give him twenty-five lashes with the wire, Mr. Grundy,\" Muller said\nflatly.\n\nPietro let out a shriek on top of the cook's. He started forward, but\nI caught him. \"Captain Muller's right,\" I told him. \"On a spaceship,\nthe full crew is needed. The brig is useless, so the space-enabling\ncharter recognizes flogging. Something is needed to maintain\ndiscipline.\"\n\nPietro dropped back reluctantly, but Lomax faced the captain. \"The man\nis a coward, hardly responsible, Captain Muller. I'm the wounded\nparty in this case, but it seems to me that hysteria isn't the same\nthing as maliciousness. Suppose I ask for clemency?\"\n\n\"Thank you, Dr. Lomax,\" Muller said, and actually looked relieved.\n\"Make it ten lashes, Mr. Grundy. Apparently no real harm has been\ndone, and he will not testify in the future.\"\n\nGrundy began dragging Bullard out, muttering about damn fool\ngroundlubbers always sticking their noses in. The cook caught at\nLomax's hand on the way, literally slobbering over it. Lomax rubbed\nhis palm across his thigh, looking embarrassed.\n\nMuller turned back to us. \"Very well. Mr. Peters will begin\ninvestigating the expedition staff and quarters; Mr. Tremaine will\nhave free run over the rest of the ship. And if the murderer is not\nturned up in forty-eight hours, we head back to Earth!\"\n\nPietro started to protest again, but another scream ripped down the\ncorridor, jerking us all around. It was Jenny, running toward us. She\nwas breathing hoarsely as she nearly crashed into Dr. Pietro.\n\nHer face was white and sick, and she had to try twice before she could\nspeak.\n\n\"The plants!\" she gasped out. \"Poison! They're dying!\"\n\n\nIII\n\nIt was chromazone again. Muller had kept most of the gang from coming\nback to hydroponics, but he, Jenny, Pietro, Wilcox and myself were\nenough to fill the room with the smell of sick fear. Now less than\nhalf of the original space was filled with healthy plants. Some of the\ntanks held plants already dead, and others were dying as we watched;\nonce beyond a certain stage, the stuff acted almost instantly--for\nhours there was only a slight indication of something wrong, and then\nsuddenly there were the dead, bleached plants.\n\nWilcox was the first to speak. He still looked like some nattily\ndressed hero of a space serial, but his first words were ones that\ncould never have gone out on a public broadcast. Then he shrugged.\n\"They must have been poisoned while we were all huddled over Sam's\nbody. Who wasn't with us?\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" Pietro denied. \"This was done at least eighteen hours ago,\nmaybe more. We'd have to find who was around then.\"\n\n\"Twenty hours, or as little as twelve,\" Jenny amended. \"It depends on\nthe amount of the dosage, to some extent. And....\" She almost managed\nto blush. \"Well, there have been a lot of people around. I can't even\nremember. Mr. Grundy and one of the men, Mr. Wilcox, Dr. Napier--oh, I\ndon't know!\"\n\nMuller shook his head in heavy agreement. \"Naturally. We had a lot of\nwork to do here. After word got around about Hendrix, we didn't try to\nconceal much. It might have happened when someone else was watching,\ntoo. The important thing, gentlemen, is that now we don't have reserve\nenough to carry us to Saturn. The plants remaining can't handle the\nair for all of us. And while we ship some reserve oxygen....\"\n\nHe let it die in a distasteful shrug. \"At least this settles one\nthing. We have no choice now but to return to Earth!\"\n\n\"Captain Muller,\" Pietro bristled quickly, \"that's getting to be a\nmonomania with you. I agree we are in grave danger. I don't relish the\nprospect of dying any more than you do--perhaps less, in view of\ncertain peculiarities! But it's now further back to Earth than it is\nto Saturn. And before we can reach either, we'll have new plants--or\nwe'll be dead!\"\n\n\"Some of us will be dead, Dr. Pietro,\" Wilcox amended it. \"There are\nenough plants left to keep some of us breathing indefinitely.\"\n\nPietro nodded. \"And I suppose, in our captain's mind, that means the\npersonnel of the ship can survive. Captain Muller, I must regard your\nconstant attempt to return to Earth as highly suspicious in view of\nthis recurrent sabotage of the expedition. Someone here is apparently\neither a complete madman or so determined to get back that he'll\nresort to anything to accomplish his end. And you have been harping on\nreturning over and over again!\"\n\nMuller bristled, and big heavy fist tightened. Then he drew himself up\nto his full dumpy height. \"Dr. Pietro,\" he said stiffly, \"I am as\nresponsible to my duties as any man here--and my duties involve\nprotecting the life of every man and woman on board; if you wish to\nreturn, I shall be _most_ happy to submit this to a formal board of\ninquiry. I--\"\n\n\"Just a minute,\" I told them. \"You two are forgetting that we've got a\nproblem here. Damn it, I'm sick of this fighting among ourselves.\nWe're a bunch of men in a jam, not two camps at war now. I can't see\nany reason why Captain Muller would want to return that badly.\"\n\nMuller nodded slightly. \"Thank you, Mr. Tremaine. However, for the\nrecord, and to save you trouble investigating there is a good reason.\nMy company is now building a super-liner; if I were to return within\nthe next six months, they'd promote me to captain of that ship--a\nconsiderable promotion, too.\"\n\nFor a moment, his honesty seemed to soften Pietro. The scientist\nmumbled some sort of apology, and turned to the plants. But it\nbothered me; if Muller had pulled something, the smartest thing he\ncould have done would be to have said just what he did.\n\nBesides, knowing that Pietro's injunction had robbed him of a chance\nlike that was enough to rankle in any man's guts and make him work up\nsomething pretty close to insanity. I marked it down in my mental\nfiles for the investigation I was supposed to make, but let it go for\nthe moment.\n\nMuller stood for a minute longer, thinking darkly about the whole\nsituation. Then he moved toward the entrance to hydroponics and pulled\nout the ship speaker mike. \"All hands and passengers will assemble in\nhydroponics within five minutes,\" he announced. He swung toward\nPietro. \"With your permission, Doctor,\" he said caustically.\n\nThe company assembled later looked as sick as the plants. This time,\nMuller was hiding nothing. He outlined the situation fully; maybe he\nshaded it a bit to throw suspicion on our group, but in no way we\ncould pin down. Finally he stated flatly that the situation meant\nalmost certain death for at least some of those aboard.\n\n\"From now on, there'll be a watch kept. This is closed to everyone\nexcept myself, Dr. Pietro, Mr. Peters, and Dr. Jenny Sanderson. At\nleast one of us will be here at all times, equipped with gas guns.\nAnyone else is to be killed on setting foot inside this door!\" He\nswung his eyes over the group. \"Any objections?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGrundy stirred uncomfortably. \"I don't go for them science guys up here.\nTakes a crazy man to do a thing like this, and everybody knows....\"\n\nEve Nolan laughed roughly. \"Everybody knows you've been swearing you\nwon't go the whole way, Grundy. These jungle tactics should be right\nup your alley.\"\n\n\"That's enough,\" Muller cut through the beginnings of the hassle. \"I\ntrust those I appointed--at least more than I do the rest of you. The\nquestion now is whether to return to Earth at once or to go on to\nSaturn. We can't radio for help for months yet. We're not equipped\nwith sharp beams, we're low powered, and we're off the lanes where\nEarth's pick-ups hunt. Dr. Pietro wants to go on, since we can't get\nback within our period of safety; I favor returning, since there is no\nproof that this danger will end with this outrage. We've agreed to let\nthe result of a vote determine it.\"\n\nWilcox stuck up a casual hand, and Muller nodded to him. He grinned\namiably at all of us. \"There's a third possibility, Captain. We can\nreach Jupiter in about three months, if we turn now. It's offside, but\ncloser than anything else. From there, on a fast liner, we can be back\non Earth in another ten days.\"\n\nMuller calculated, while Peters came up to discuss it. Then he nodded.\n\"Saturn or Jupiter, then. I'm not voting, of course. Bullard is\ndisqualified to vote by previous acts.\" He drew a low moan from the\nsick figure of Bullard for that, but no protest. Then he nodded. \"All\nthose in favor of Jupiter, your right hands please!\"\n\nI counted them, wondering why my own hand was still down. It made some\nsort of sense to turn aside now. But none of our group was voting--and\nall the others had their hands up, except for Dr. Napier. \"Seven,\"\nMuller announced. \"Those in favor of Saturn.\"\n\nAgain, Napier didn't vote. I hesitated, then put my hand up. It was\ncrazy, and Pietro was a fool to insist. But I knew that he'd never get\nanother chance if this failed, and....\n\n\"Eight,\" Muller counted. He sighed, then straightened. \"Very well, we\ngo on. Dr. Pietro, you will have my full support from now on. In\nreturn, I'll expect every bit of help in meeting this emergency. Mr.\nTremaine was correct; we cannot remain camps at war.\"\n\nPietro's goatee bobbed quickly, and his hand went out. But while most\nof the scientists were nodding with him, I caught the dark scowl of\nGrundy, and heard the mutters from the deckhands and the engine men.\nIf Muller could get them to cooperate, he was a genius.\n\nPietro faced us, and his face was serious again. \"We can hasten the\nseeding of the plants a little, I think, by temperature and\nlight-and-dark cycle manipulations. Unfortunately, these aren't\nsea-algae plants, or we'd be in comparatively little trouble. That was\nmy fault in not converting. We can, however, step up their efficiency\na bit. And I'm sure we can find some way to remove the carbon dioxide\nfrom the air.\"\n\n\"How about oxygen to breathe?\" Peters asked.\n\n\"That's the problem,\" Pietro admitted. \"I was wondering about\nelectrolyzing water.\"\n\nWilcox bobbed up quickly. \"Can you do it on AC current?\"\n\nLomax shook his head. \"It takes DC.\"\n\n\"Then that's out. We run on 220 AC. And while I can rectify a few\nwatts, it wouldn't be enough to help. No welders except monatomic\nhydrogen torches, even.\"\n\nPietro looked sicker than before. He'd obviously been counting on\nthat. But he turned to Bullard. \"How about seeds? We had a crop of\ntomatoes a month ago--and from the few I had, they're all seed. Are\nany left?\"\n\nBullard rocked from side to side, moaning. \"Dead. We're all gonna be\ndead. I told him, I did, you take me out there, I'll never get back.\nI'm a good man, I am. I wasn't never meant to die way out here.\nI--I--\"\n\nHe gulped and suddenly screamed. He went through the door at an\nawkward shuffle, heading for his galley. Muller shook his head, and\nturned toward me. \"Check up, will you, Mr. Tremaine? And I suggest\nthat you and Mr. Peters start your investigation at once. I understand\nthat chromazone would require so little hiding space that there's no\nuse searching for it. But if you can find any evidence, report it at\nonce.\"\n\nPeters and I left. I found the galley empty. Apparently Bullard had\ngone to lie on his stomach in his bunk and nurse his terror. I found\nthe freezer compartments, though--and the tomatoes. There must have\nbeen a bushel of them, but Bullard had followed his own peculiar\ntastes. From the food he served, he couldn't stand fresh vegetables;\nand he'd cooked the tomatoes down thoroughly and run them through the\ndehydrator before packing them away!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was a cheerful supper, that one! Bullard had half-recovered and his\nfear was driving him to try to be nice to us. The selection was good,\nbeyond the inevitable baked beans; but he wasn't exactly a chef at\nbest, and his best was far behind him. Muller had brought Wilcox,\nNapier and Peters down to our mess with himself, to consolidate\nforces, and it seemed that he was serious about cooperating. But it\nwas a little late for that.\n\nOverhead, the fans had been stepped up to counteract the effect of\nstaleness our minds supplied. But the whine of the motors kept\nreminding us our days were counted. Only Jenny was normal; she sat\nbetween Muller and Pietro, where she could watch my face and that of\nNapier. And even her giggles had a forced sound.\n\nThere were all kinds of things we could do--in theory. But we didn't\nhave that kind of equipment. The plain fact was that the plants were\ngoing to lose the battle against our lungs. The carbon dioxide would\nincrease, speeding up our breathing, and making us all seem to\nsuffocate. The oxygen would grow thinner and thinner, once our\nsupplies of bottled gas ran out. And eventually, the air wouldn't\nsupport life.\n\n\"It's sticky and hot,\" Jenny complained, suddenly.\n\n\"I stepped up the humidity and temperature controls,\" I told her. She\nnodded in quick comprehension, but I went on for Muller's benefit.\n\"Trying to give the plants the best growing atmosphere. We'll feel\njust as hot and sticky when the carbon dioxide goes up, anyhow.\"\n\n\"It must already be up,\" Wilcox said. \"My two canaries are breathing\nfaster.\"\n\n\"Canaries,\" Muller said. He frowned, though he must have known of\nthem. It was traditional to keep them in the engine-room, though the\nreason behind it had long since been lost. \"Better kill them, Mr.\nWilcox.\"\n\nWilcox jerked, and his face paled a bit. Then he nodded. \"Yes, sir!\"\n\nThat was when I got scared. The idea that two birds breathing could\nhurt our chances put things on a little too vivid a basis. Only Lomax\nseemed unaffected. He shoved back now, and stood up.\n\n\"Some tests I have to make, Captain. I have an idea that might turn up\nthe killer among us!\"\n\nI had an idea he was bluffing, but I kept my mouth shut. A bluff was\nas good as anything else, it seemed.\n\nAt least, it was better than anything I seemed able to do. I prowled\nover the ship, sometimes meeting Peters doing the same, but I couldn't\nfind a bit of evidence. The crewmen sat watching with hating eyes. And\nprobably the rest aboard hated and feared us just as much. It wasn't\nhard to imagine the man who was behind it all deciding to wipe one of\nus out. My neck got a permanent crimp from keeping one eye behind me.\nBut there wasn't a shred of evidence I could find.\n\nIn two more days, we began to notice the stuffiness more. My breathing\nwent up enough to notice. Somehow, I couldn't get a full breath. And\nthe third night, I woke up in the middle of my sleep with the feeling\nsomething was sitting on my chest; but since I'd taken to sleeping\nwith the light on, I saw that it was just the stuffiness that was\nbothering me. Maybe most of it had been psychological up until then.\nBut that was the real thing.\n\nThe nice part of it was that it wouldn't be sudden--we'd have days to\nget closer and closer to death; and days for each one to realize a\nlittle more that every man who wasn't breathing would make it that\nmuch easier for the rest of us. I caught myself thinking of it when I\nsaw Bullard or Grundy.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen trouble struck again. I was late getting to the scene this time,\ndown by the engine room. Muller and Bill Sanderson were ahead of me,\ntrying to separate Hal Lomax and Grundy, and not doing so well. Lomax\nbrought up a haymaker as I arrived, and started to shout something.\nBut Grundy was out of Muller's grasp, and up, swinging a wrench. It\nconnected with a dull thud, and Lomax hit the floor, unconscious.\n\nI picked Grundy up by the collar of his jacket, heaved him around and\nagainst a wall, where I could get my hand against his esophagus and\nstart squeezing. His eyeballs popped, and the wrench dropped from his\nhands. When I get mad enough to act that way, I usually know I'll\nregret it later. This time it felt good, all the way. But Muller\npushed me aside, waiting until Grundy could breathe again.\n\n\"All right,\" Muller said. \"I hope you've got a good explanation,\nbefore I decide what to do with you.\"\n\nGrundy's eyes were slitted, as if he'd been taking some of the Venus\ndrugs. But after one long, hungry look at me, he faced the captain.\n\"Yes, sir. This guy came down here ahead of me. Didn't think nothing\nof it, sir. But when he started fiddling with the panel there, I got\nsuspicious.\" He pointed to the external control panel for the engine\nroom, to be used in case of accidents. \"With all that's been going on,\nhow'd I know but maybe he was gonna dump the fuel? And then I seen he\nhad keys. I didn't wait, sir. I jumped him. And then you come up.\"\n\nWilcox came from the background and dropped beside the still figure of\nLomax. He opened the man's left hand and pulled out a bunch of keys,\nexamining them. \"Engine keys, Captain Muller. Hey--it's my set! He\nmust have lifted them from my pocket. It looks as if Grundy's found\nour killer!\"\n\n\"Or Lomax found him!\" I pointed out. \"Anybody else see this start, or\nknow that Lomax didn't get those keys away from Grundy, when _he_\nstarted trouble?\"\n\n\"Why, you--\" Grundy began, but Wilcox cut off his run. It was a shame.\nI still felt like pushing the man's Adam's apple through his medulla\noblongata.\n\n\"Lock them both up, until Dr. Lomax comes to,\" Muller ordered. \"And\nsend Dr. Napier to take care of him. I'm not jumping to any\nconclusions.\" But the look he was giving Lomax indicated that he'd\nalready pretty well made up his mind. And the crew was positive. They\ndrew back sullenly, staring at us like animals studying a human\nhunter, and they didn't like it when Peters took Grundy to lock him\ninto his room. Muller finally chased them out, and left Wilcox and me\nalone.\n\nWilcox shrugged wryly, brushing dirt off his too-clean uniform. \"While\nyou're here, Tremaine, why not look my section over? You've been\nneglecting me.\"\n\nI'd borrowed Muller's keys and inspected the engine room from, top to\nbottom the night before, but I didn't mention that. I hesitated now;\nto a man who grew up to be an engineer and who'd now gotten over his\npsychosis against space too late to start over, the engines were\nthings better left alone. Then I remembered that I hadn't seen\nWilcox's quarters, since he had the only key to them.\n\nI nodded and went inside. The engines were old, and the gravity\ngenerator was one of the first models. But Wilcox knew his business.\nThe place was slick enough, and there was the good clean smell of\nmetal working right. I could feel the controls in my hands, and my\nnerves itched as I went about making a perfunctory token examination.\nI even opened the fuel lockers and glanced in. The two crewmen watched\nwith hard eyes, slitted as tight as Grundy's, but they didn't bother\nme. Then I shrugged, and went back with Wilcox to his tiny cabin.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI was hit by the place before I got inside. Tiny, yes, but fixed up\nlike the dream of every engineer. Clean, neat, filled with books and\nluxuries. He even had a tape player I'd seen on sale for a trifle over\nthree thousand dollars. He turned it on, letting the opening bars of\nHaydn's Oxford Symphony come out. It was a binaural, ultra-fidelity\njob, and I could close my eyes and feel the orchestra in front of me.\n\nThis time I was thorough, right down the line, from the cabinets that\nheld luxury food and wine to the little drawer where he kept his\ndress-suit studs; they might have been rutiles, but I had a hunch they\nwere genuine catseyes.\n\nHe laughed when I finished, and handed me a glass of the first decent wine\nI'd tasted in months. \"Even a small ozonator to make the air seem more\nbreathable, and a dehumidifier, Tremaine. I like to live decently. I\nstarted saving my money once with the idea of getting a ship of my own--\"\nThere was a real dream in his eyes for a second. Then he shrugged. \"But\nships got bigger and more expensive. So I decided to live. At forty, I've\ngot maybe twenty years ahead here, and I mean to enjoy it. And--well,\nthere are ways of making a bit extra....\"\n\nI nodded. So it's officially smuggling to carry a four-ounce Martian\nfur to Earth where it's worth a fortune, considering the legal duty.\nBut most officers did it now and then. He put on Sibelius' Fourth\nwhile I finished the wine. \"If this mess is ever over, Paul, or you\nget a chance, drop down,\" he said. \"I like a man who knows good\nthings--and I liked your reaction when you spotted that Haydn for\nHohmann's recording. Muller pretends to know music, but he likes the\nflashiness of M\u00f6hlwehr.\"\n\nHell, I'd cut my eye teeth on that stuff; my father had been first\nviolinist in an orchestra, and had considered me a traitor when I was\nborn without perfect pitch. We talked about Sibelius for awhile,\nbefore I left to go out into the stinking rest of the ship. Grundy was\nsitting before the engines, staring at them. Wilcox had said the big\nape liked to watch them move ... but he was supposed to be locked up.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI stopped by Lomax's door; the shutter was open, and I could see the\nbig man writhing about, but he was apparently unconscious. Napier came\nback from somewhere, and nodded quickly.\n\n\"Concussion,\" he said. \"He's still out, but it shouldn't be too\nserious.\"\n\n\"Grundy's loose.\" I'd expected surprise, but there was none. \"Why?\"\n\nHe shrugged. \"Muller claimed he needed his mate free to handle the\ncrew, and that there was no place the man could go. I think it was\nbecause the men are afraid they'll be outnumbered by your group.\" His\nmouth smiled, but it was suddenly bitter. \"Jenny talked Pietro into\nagreeing with Muller.\"\n\nMess was on when I reached the group. I wasn't hungry. The wine had\ncut the edge from my appetite, and the slow increase of poison in the\nair was getting me, as it was the others. Sure, carbon dioxide isn't a\nreal poison--but no organism can live in its own waste, all the same.\nI had a rotten headache. I sat there playing a little game I'd\ninvented--trying to figure which ones I'd eliminate if some had to\ndie. Jenny laughed up at Muller, and I added him to the list. Then I\nchanged it, and put her in his place. I was getting sick of the little\nwitch, though I knew it would be different if she'd been laughing up\nat me. And then, because of the sick-calf look on Bill Sanderson's\nface as he stared at Eve, I added him, though I'd always liked the\nguy. Eve, surprisingly, had as many guys after her as Jenny; but she\ndidn't seem interested. Or maybe she did--she'd pulled her hair back\nand put on a dress that made her figure look good. Either flattery was\nworking, or she was entering into the last-days feeling most of us\nhad.\n\nNapier came in and touched my shoulder. \"Lomax is conscious, and he's\nasking for you,\" he said, too low for the others to hear.\n\nI found the chemist conscious, all right, but sick--and scared. His\nface winced, under all the bandages, as I opened the door. Then he saw\nwho it was, and relaxed. \"Paul--what happened to me? The last I\nremember is going up to see that second batch of plants poisoned.\nBut--well, this is something I must have got later....\"\n\nI told him, as best I could. \"But don't you remember anything?\"\n\n\"Not a thing about that. It's the same as Napier told me, and I've\nbeen trying to remember. Paul, you don't think--?\"\n\nI put a hand on his shoulder and pushed him back gently. \"Don't be a\ndamned fool, Hal. I know you're no killer.\"\n\n\"But somebody is, Paul. Somebody tried to kill me while I was\nunconscious!\"\n\nHe must have seen my reaction. \"They did, Paul. I don't know how I\nknow--maybe I almost came to--but somebody tried to poke a stick\nthrough the door with a knife on it. They want to kill me.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nI tried to calm him down until Napier came and gave him a sedative.\nThe doctor seemed as sick about Hal's inability to remember as I was,\nthough he indicated it was normal enough in concussion cases. \"So is\nthe hallucination,\" he added. \"He'll be all right tomorrow.\"\n\nIn that, Napier was wrong. When the doctor looked in on him the next\ntime, the big chemist lay behind a door that had been pried open, with\na long galley knife through his heart. On the bloody sheet, his finger\nhad traced something in his own blood.\n\n\"_It was_....\" But the last \"s\" was blurred, and there was nothing\nmore.\n\n\nIV\n\nI don't know how many were shocked at Hal's death, or how many looked\naround and counted one less pair of lungs. He'd never been one of the\nmen I'd envied the air he used, though, and I think most felt the\nsame. For awhile, we didn't even notice that the air was even thicker.\n\nPhil Riggs broke the silence following our inspection of Lomax's\ncabin. \"That damned Bullard! I'll get him, I'll get him as sure as he\ngot Hal!\"\n\nThere was a rustle among the others, and a suddenly crystallized hate\non their faces. But Muller's hoarse shout cut through the babble that\nbegan, and rose over even the anguished shrieking of the cook. \"Shut\nup, the lot of you! Bullard couldn't have committed the other crimes.\nAny one of you is a better suspect. Stop snivelling, Bullard, this\nisn't a lynching mob, and it isn't going to be one!\"\n\n\"What about Grundy?\" Walt Harris yelled.\n\nWilcox pushed forward. \"Grundy couldn't have done it. He's the logical\nsuspect, but he was playing rummy with my men.\"\n\nThe two engine men nodded agreement, and we began filing back to the\nmess hall, with the exception of Bullard, who shoved back into a\nniche, trying to avoid us. Then, when we were almost out of his sight,\nhe let out a shriek and came blubbering after us.\n\nI watched them put Hal Lomax's body through the 'tween-hulls lock, and\nturned toward the engine room; I could use some of that wine, just as\nthe ship could have used a trained detective. But the idea of watching\nhelplessly while the engines purred along to remind me I was just a\nhandyman for the rest of my life got mixed up with the difficulty of\nbreathing the stale air, and I started to turn back. My head was\nthrobbing, and for two cents I'd have gone out between the hulls\nbeside Lomax and the others and let the foul air spread out there and\nfreeze....\n\nThe idea was slow coming. Then I was running back toward the engines.\nI caught up with Wilcox just before he went into his own quarters.\n\"Wilcox!\"\n\nHe swung around casually, saw it was me, and motioned inside. \"How\nabout some Bartok, Paul? Or would you rather soothe your nerves with\nsome first-rate Buxtehude organ....\"\n\n\"Damn the music,\" I told him. \"I've got a wild idea to get rid of this\ncarbon dioxide, and I want to know if we can get it working with what\nwe've got.\"\n\nHe snapped to attention at that. Half-way through my account, he\nfished around and found a bottle of Armagnac. \"I get it. If we pipe\nour air through the passages between the hulls on the shadow side, it\nwill lose its heat in a hurry. And we can regulate its final\ntemperature by how fast we pipe it through--just keep it moving enough\nto reach the level where carbon dioxide freezes out, but the oxygen\nstays a gas. Then pass it around the engines--we'll have to cut out\nthe normal cooling set-up, but that's okay--warm it up.... Sure, I've\ngot equipment enough for that. We can set it up in a day. Of course,\nit won't give us any more oxygen, but we'll be able to breathe what we\nhave. To success, Paul!\"\n\nI guess it was good brandy, but I swallowed mine while calling Muller\ndown, and never got to taste it.\n\nIt's surprising how much easier the air got to breathe after we'd\ndouble-checked the idea. In about fifteen minutes, we were all milling\naround in the engine room, while Wilcox checked through equipment. But\nthere was no question about it. It was even easier than we'd thought.\nWe could simply bypass the cooling unit, letting the engine housings\nstay open to the between-hulls section; then it was simply a matter of\ncutting a small opening into that section at the other end of the ship\nand installing a sliding section to regulate the amount of air flowing\nin. The exhaust from the engine heat pumps was reversed, and run out\nthrough a hole hastily knocked in the side of the wall.\n\nNaturally, we let it flow too fast at first. Space is a vacuum, which\nmeans it's a good insulator. We had to cut the air down to a trickle.\nThen Wilcox ran into trouble because his engines wouldn't cool with\nthat amount of air. He went back to supervise a patched-up job of\nsplitting the coolers into sections, which took time. But after that,\nwe had it.\n\nI went through the hatch with Muller and Pietro. With air there there\nwas no need to wear space suits, but it was so cold that we could take\nit for only a minute or so. That was long enough to see a faint, fine\nmist of dry ice snow falling. It was also long enough to catch a sight\nof the three bodies there. I didn't enjoy that, and Pietro gasped.\nMuller grimaced. When we came back, he sent Grundy in to move the\nbodies to a hull-section where our breathing air wouldn't pass over\nthem. It wasn't necessary, of course. But somehow, it seemed\nimportant.\n\nBy lunch, the air seemed normal. We shipped only pure oxygen at about\nthree pounds pressure, instead of loading it with a lot of useless\nnitrogen. With the carbon dioxide cut back to normal levels, it was as\ngood as ever. The only difference was that the fans had to be set to\nblow in a different pattern. We celebrated, and even Bullard seemed to\nhave perked up. He dug out pork chops and almost succeeded in making\nus cornbread out of some coarse flour I saw him pouring out of the\nfood chopper. He had perked up enough to bewail the fact that all he\nhad was canned spinach instead of turnip greens.\n\nBut by night, the temper had changed--and the food indicated it again.\nBullard's cooking was turning into a barometer of the psychic\npressure. We'd had time to realize that we weren't getting something\nfor nothing. Every molecule of carbon-dioxide that crystallized out\ntook two atoms of oxygen with it, completely out of circulation.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe were also losing water-vapor, we found; normally, any one of our\ngroup knew enough science to know that the water would fall out before\nthe carbon dioxide, but we hadn't thought of it. We took care of that,\nhowever, by having Wilcox weld in a baffle and keep the section where\nthe water condensed separate from the carbon dioxide snowfall. We\ncould always shovel out the real ice, and meantime the ship's controls\nrestored the moisture to the air easily enough.\n\nBut there was nothing we could do about the oxygen. When that was\ngone, it stayed gone. The plants still took care of about two-thirds\nof our waste--but the other third was locked out there between the\nhulls. Given plants enough, we could have thawed it and let them\nreconvert it; a nice idea, except that we had to wait three months to\ntake care of it, if we lived that long.\n\nBullard's cooking began to get worse. Then suddenly, we got one good\nmeal. Eve Nolan came down the passage to announce that Bullard was\nmaking cake, with frosting, canned huckleberry pie, and all the works.\nWe headed for the mess hall, fast.\n\nIt was the cook's masterpiece. Muller came down late, though, and\nregarded it doubtfully. \"There's something funny,\" he said as he\nsettled down beside me. Jenny had been surrounded by Napier and\nPietro. \"Bullard came up babbling a few minutes ago. I don't like it.\nSomething about eating hearty, because he'd saved us all, forever and\never. He told me the angels were on our side, because a beautiful\nangel with two halos came to him in his sleep and told him how to save\nus. I chased him back to the galley, but I don't like it.\"\n\nMost of them had already eaten at least half of the food, but I saw\nMuller wasn't touching his. The rest stopped now, as the words sank\nin, and Napier looked shocked. \"No!\" he said, but his tone wasn't\npositive. \"He's a weakling, but I don't think he's insane--not enough\nto poison us.\"\n\n\"There was that food poisoning before,\" Pietro said suddenly. \"Paul,\ncome along. And don't eat anything until we come back.\"\n\nWe broke the record getting to the galley. There Bullard sat, beaming\nhappily, eating from a huge plate piled with the food he had cooked. I\nchecked on it quickly--and there wasn't anything he'd left out. He\nlooked up, and his grin widened foolishly.\n\n\"Hi, docs,\" he said. \"Yes, sir, I knowed you'd be coming. It all came\nto me in a dream. Looked just like my wife twenty years ago, she did,\nwith green and yellow halos. And she told it to me. Told me I'd been a\ngood man, and nothing was going to happen to me. Not to good old Emery\nBullard. Had it all figgered out.\"\n\nHe speared a big forkful of food and crammed it into his mouth,\nmunching noisily. \"Had it all figgered. Pop-corn. Best damned pop-corn\nyou ever saw, kind they raise not fifty miles from where I was born.\nYou know, I didn't useta like you guys. But now I love everybody. When\nwe get to Saturn, I'm gonna make up for all the times I didn't give\nyou pop-corn. We'll pop and we'll pop. And beans, too. I useta hate\nbeans. Always beans on a ship. But now we're saved, and I love\nbeans!\"\n\nHe stared after us, half coming out of his seat. \"Hey, docs, ain't you\ngonna let me tell you about it?\"\n\n\"Later, Bullard,\" Pietro called back. \"Something just came up. We want\nto hear all about it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nInside the mess hall, he shrugged. \"He's eating the food himself. If\nhe's crazy, he's in a happy stage of it. I'm sure he isn't trying to\npoison us.\" He sat down and began eating, without any hesitation.\n\nI didn't feel as sure, and suspected he didn't. But it was too late to\nback out. Together, we summarized what he'd told us, while Napier\npuzzled over it. Finally the doctor shrugged. \"Visions. Euphoria.\nDisconnection with reality. Apparently something of a delusion that\nhe's to save the world. I'm not a psychiatrist, but it sounds like\ninsanity to me. Probably not dangerous. At least, while he wants to\nsave us, we won't have to worry about the food. Still....\"\n\nWilcox mulled it over, and resumed the eating he had neglected before.\n\n\"Grundy claimed he'd been down near the engine room, trying to get\npermission to pop something in the big pile. I thought Grundy was just\ngetting his stories mixed up. But--pop-corn!\"\n\n\"I'll have him locked in his cabin,\" Muller decided. He picked up the\nnearest handset, saw that it was to the galley, and switched quickly.\n\"Grundy, lock Bullard up. And no rough stuff this time.\" Then he\nturned to Napier. \"Dr. Napier, you'll have to see him and find out\nwhat you can.\"\n\nI guess there's a primitive fear of insanity in most of us. We felt\nsick, beyond the nagging worry about the food. Napier got up at once.\n\"I'll give him a sedative. Maybe it's just nerves, and he'll snap out\nof it after a good sleep. Anyhow, your mate can stand watching.\"\n\n\"Who can cook?\" Muller asked. His eyes swung down the table toward\nJenny.\n\nI wondered how she'd get out of that. Apparently she'd never told\nMuller about the scars she still had from spilled grease, and how\nshe'd never forgiven her mother or been able to go near a kitchen\nsince. But I should have guessed. She could remember my stories, too.\nHer eyes swung up toward mine pleadingly.\n\nEve Nolan stood up suddenly. \"I'm not only a good cook, but I enjoy\nit,\" she stated flatly, and there was disgust in the look she threw at\nJenny. She swung toward me. \"How about it, Paul, can you wrestle the\nbig pots around for me?\"\n\n\"I used to be a short order cook when I was finishing school,\" I told\nher. But she'd ruined the line. The grateful look and laugh from Jenny\nweren't needed now. And curiously, I felt grateful to Eve for it. I\ngot up and went after Napier.\n\nI found him in Bullard's little cubbyhole of a cabin. He must have\nchased Grundy off, and now he was just drawing a hypo out of the\ncook's arm. \"It'll take the pain away,\" he was saying softly. \"And\nI'll see that he doesn't hit you again. You'll be all right, now. And\nin the morning, I'll come and listen to you. Just go to sleep. Maybe\nshe'll come back and tell you more.\"\n\nHe must have heard me, since he signalled me out with his hand, and\nbacked out quietly himself, still talking. He shut the door, and\nclicked the lock.\n\nBullard heard it, though. He jerked to a sitting position, and\nscreamed. \"_No!_ No! He'll kill me! I'm a good man....\"\n\nHe hunched up on the bed, forcing the sheet into his mouth. When he\nlooked up a second later, his face was frozen in fear, but it was a\ndesperate, calm kind of fear. He turned to face us, and his voice\nraised to a full shout, with every word as clear as he could make it.\n\n\"All right. Now I'll never tell you the secret. Now you can all die\nwithout air. I promise I'll never tell you what I know!\"\n\nHe fell back, beating at the sheet with his hand and sobbing\nhysterically. Napier watched him. \"Poor devil,\" the doctor said at\nlast. \"Well, in another minute the shot will take effect. Maybe he's\nlucky. He won't be worrying for awhile. And maybe he'll be rational\ntomorrow.\"\n\n\"All the same, I'm going to stand guard until Muller gets someone else\nhere,\" I decided. I kept remembering Lomax.\n\nNapier nodded, and half an hour later Bill Sanderson came to take over\nthe watch. Bullard was sleeping soundly.\n\nThe next day, though, he woke up to start moaning and writhing again.\nBut he was keeping his word. He refused to answer any questions.\nNapier looked worried as he reported he'd given the cook another shot\nof sedative. There was nothing else he could do.\n\nCooking was a relief, in a way. By the time Eve and I had scrubbed all\nthe pots into what she considered proper order, located some of the\nfood lockers, and prepared and served a couple of meals, we'd evolved\na smooth system that settled into a routine with just enough work to\nhelp keep our minds off the dwindling air in the tanks. In anything\nlike a kitchen, she lost most of her mannish pose and turned into a\nlive, efficient woman. And she could cook.\n\n\"First thing I learned,\" she told me. \"I grew up in a kitchen. I guess\nI'd never have turned to photography if my kid brother hadn't been\nusing our sink for his darkroom.\"\n\nWilcox brought her a bottle of his wine to celebrate her first dinner.\nHe seemed to want to stick around, but she chased him off after the\nfirst drink. We saved half the bottle to make a sauce the next day.\n\nIt never got made. Muller called a council of war, and his face was\npinched and old. He was leaning on Jenny as Eve and I came into the\nmess hall; oddly, she seemed to be trying to buck him up. He got down\nto the facts as soon as all of us were together.\n\n\"Our oxygen tanks are empty,\" he announced. \"They shouldn't be--but\nthey are. Someone must have sabotaged them before the plants were\npoisoned--and done it so the dials don't show it. I just found it out\nwhen the automatic switch to a new tank failed to work. We now have\nthe air in the ship, and no more. Dr. Napier and I have figured that\nthis will keep us all alive with the help of the plants for no more\nthan fifteen days. I am open to any suggestions!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was silence after that, while it soaked in. Then it was broken\nby a thin scream from Phil Riggs. He slumped into a seat and buried\nhis head in his hands. Pietro put a hand on the man's thin shoulders,\n\"Captain Muller--\"\n\n\"Kill 'em!\" It was Grundy's voice, bellowing sharply. \"Let'em breathe\nspace! They got us into it! We can make out with the plants left! It's\nour ship!\"\n\nMuller had walked forward. Now his fist lashed out, and Grundy\ncrumpled. He lay still for a second, then got to his feet unsteadily.\nJenny screamed, but Muller moved steadily back to his former place\nwithout looking at the mate. Grundy hesitated, fumbled in his pocket\nfor something, and swallowed it.\n\n\"Captain, sir!\" His voice was lower this time.\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Grundy?\"\n\n\"How many of us can live off the plants?\"\n\n\"Ten--perhaps eleven.\"\n\n\"Then--then give us a lottery!\"\n\nPietro managed to break in over the yells of the rest of the crew. \"I\nwas about to suggest calling for volunteers, Captain Muller. I still\nhave enough faith in humanity to believe....\"\n\n\"You're a fool, Dr. Pietro,\" Muller said flatly. \"Do you think Grundy\nwould volunteer? Or Bullard? But thanks for clearing the air, and\nadmitting your group has nothing more to offer. A lottery seems to be\nthe only fair system.\"\n\nHe sat down heavily. \"We have tradition on this; in an emergency such\nas this, death lotteries have been held, and have been considered\nlegal afterwards. Are there any protests?\"\n\nI could feel my tongue thicken in my mouth. I could see the others\nstare about, hoping someone would object, wondering if this could be\nhappening. But nobody answered, and Muller nodded reluctantly. \"A\nworking force must be left. Some men are indispensable. We must have\nan engineer, a navigator, and a doctor. One man skilled with\nengine-room practice and one with deck work must remain.\"\n\n\"And the cook goes,\" Grundy yelled. His eyes were intent and slitted\nagain.\n\nSome of both groups nodded, but Muller brought his fist down on the\ntable. \"This will be a legal lottery, Mr. Grundy. Dr. Napier will draw\nfor him.\"\n\n\"And for myself,\" Napier said. \"It's obvious that ten men aren't going\non to Saturn--you'll have to turn back, or head for Jupiter. Jupiter,\nin fact, is the only sensible answer. And a ship can get along without\na doctor that long when it has to. I demand my right to the draw.\"\n\nMuller only shrugged and laid down the rules. They were simple enough.\nHe would cut drinking straws to various lengths, and each would draw\none. The two deck hands would compare theirs, and the longer would be\nautomatically safe. The same for the pair from the engine-room. Wilcox\nwas safe. \"Mr. Peters and I will also have one of us eliminated,\" he\nadded quietly. \"In an emergency, our abilities are sufficiently\nalike.\"\n\nThe remaining group would have their straws measured, and the seven\nshortest ones would be chosen to remove themselves into a vacant\nsection between hulls without air within three hours, or be forcibly\nplaced there. The remaining ten would head for Jupiter if no miracle\nremoved the danger in those three hours.\n\nPeters got the straws, and Muller cut them and shuffled them. There\nwas a sick silence that let us hear the sounds of the scissors with\neach snip. Muller arranged them so the visible ends were even. \"Ladies\nfirst,\" he said. There was no expression on his face or in his voice.\n\nJenny didn't giggle, but neither did she balk. She picked a straw, and\nthen shrieked faintly. It was obviously a long one. Eve reached for\nhers--\n\nAnd Wilcox yelled suddenly. \"Captain Muller, protest! Protest! You're\nusing all long straws for the women!\" He had jumped forward, and now\nstruck down Muller's hand, proving his point.\n\n\"You're quite right, Mr. Wilcox,\" Muller said woodenly. He dropped his\nhand toward his lap and came up with a group of the straws that had\nbeen cut, placed there somehow without our seeing it. He'd done a\nsmooth job of it, but not smooth enough. \"I felt some of you would\nnotice it, but I also felt that gentlemen would prefer to see ladies\ngiven the usual courtesies.\"\n\nHe reshuffled the assorted straws, and then paused. \"Mr. Tremaine,\nthere was a luxury liner named the _Lauri Ellu_ with an assistant\nengineer by your name; and I believe you've shown a surprising\nfamiliarity with certain customs of space. A few days ago, Jenny\nmentioned something that jogged my memory. Can you still perform the\nduties of an engineer?\"\n\nWilcox had started to protest at the delay. Now shock ran through him.\nHe stared unbelievingly from Muller to me and back, while his face\nblanched. I could guess what it must have felt like to see certain\nsafety cut to a 50 per cent chance, and I didn't like the way Muller\nwas willing to forget until he wanted to take a crack at Wilcox for\npunishment. But....\n\n\"I can,\" I answered. And then, because I was sick inside myself for\ncutting under Wilcox, I managed to add, \"But I--I waive my chance at\nimmunity!\"\n\n\"Not accepted,\" Muller decided. \"Jenny, will you draw?\"\n\nIt was pretty horrible. It was worse when the pairs compared straws.\nThe animal feelings were out in the open then. Finally, Muller,\nWilcox, and two crewmen dropped out. The rest of us went up to measure\nour straws.\n\nIt took no more than a minute. I stood staring down at the ruler,\ntrying to stretch the tiny thing I'd drawn. I could smell the sweat\nrising from my body. But I knew the answer. I had three hours left!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Riggs, Oliver, Nolan, Harris, Tremaine, Napier and Grundy,\" Muller\nannounced.\n\nA yell came from Grundy. He stood up, with the engine man named\nOliver, and there was a gun in his hand. \"No damned big brain's\nkicking me off my ship,\" he yelled. \"You guys know me. Hey,\n_roooob_!\"\n\nOliver was with him, and the other three of the crew sprang into the\ngroup. I saw Muller duck a shot from Grundy's gun, and leap out of the\nroom. Then I was in it, heading for Grundy. Beside me, Peters was\ntrying to get a chair broken into pieces. I felt something hit my\nshoulder, and the shock knocked me downward, just as a shot whistled\nover my head.\n\nGravity cut off!\n\nSomeone bounced off me. I got a piece of the chair that floated by,\nfound the end cracked and sharp, and tried to spin towards Grundy, but\nI couldn't see him. I heard Eve's voice yell over the other shouts. I\nspotted the plate coming for me, but I was still in midair. It came on\nsteadily, edge on, and I felt it break against my forehead. Then I\nblacked out.\n\n\nV\n\nI had the grandaddy of all headaches when I came to. Doc Napier's face\nwas over me, and Jenny and Muller were working on Bill Sanderson.\nThere was a surprisingly small and painful lump on my head. Pietro and\nNapier helped me up, and I found I could stand after a minute.\n\nThere were four bodies covered with sheets on the floor. \"Grundy, Phil\nRiggs, Peters and a deckhand named Storm,\" Napier said. \"Muller gave\nus a whiff of gas and not quite in time.\"\n\n\"Is the time up?\" I asked. It was the only thing I could think of.\n\nPietro shook his head sickly. \"Lottery is off. Muller says we'll have\nto hold another, since Storm and Peters were supposed to be safe. But\nnot until tomorrow.\"\n\nEve came in then, lugging coffee. Her eyes found me, and she managed a\nbrief smile. \"I gave the others coffee,\" she reported to Muller.\n\"They're pretty subdued now.\"\n\n\"Mutiny!\" Muller helped Jenny's brother to his feet and began helping\nhim toward the door. \"Mutiny! And I have to swallow that!\"\n\nPietro watched him go, and handed Eve back his cup. \"And there's no\nway of knowing who was on which side. Dr. Napier, could you do\nsomething....\"\n\nHe held out his hands that were shaking, and Napier nodded. \"I can use\na sedative myself. Come on back with me.\"\n\nEve and I wandered back to the kitchen. I was just getting my senses\nback. The damned stupidity of it all. And now it would have to be\ndone over. Three of us still had to have our lives snuffed out so the\nothers could live--and we all had to go through hell again to find out\nwhich.\n\nEve must have been thinking the same. She sank down on a little stool,\nand her hand came out to find mine. \"For what? Paul, whoever poisoned\nthe plants knew it would go this far! He had to! What's to be gained?\nParticularly when he'd have to go through all this, too! He must have\nbeen crazy!\"\n\n\"Bullard couldn't have done it,\" I said slowly.\n\n\"Why should it be Bullard? How do we know he was insane? Maybe when he\nwas shouting that he wouldn't tell, he was trying to make a bribe to\nsave his own life. Maybe he's as scared as we are. Maybe he was making\nsense all along, if we'd only listened to him. He--\"\n\nShe stood up and started back toward the lockers, but I caught her\nhand. \"Eve, he wouldn't have done it--the killer--if he'd had to go\nthrough the lottery! He knew he was safe! That's the one thing we've\nbeen overlooking. The man to suspect is the only man who could be sure\nhe would get back! My God, we saw him juggle those straws to save\nJenny! He knew he'd control the lottery.\"\n\nShe frowned. \"But ... Paul, he practically suggested the lottery!\nGrundy brought it up, but he was all ready for it.\" The frown\nvanished, then returned. \"But I still can't believe it.\"\n\n\"He's the one who wanted to go back all the time. He kept insisting on\nit, but he had to get back without violating his contract.\" I grabbed\nher hand and started toward the nose of the ship, justifying it to her\nas I went. \"The only man with a known motive for returning, the only\none completely safe--and we didn't even think of it!\"\n\nShe was still frowning, but I wasn't wasting time. We came up the\ncorridor to the control room. Ahead the door was slightly open, and I\ncould hear a mutter of Jenny's voice. Then there was the tired rumble\nof Muller.\n\n\"I'll find a way, baby. I don't care how close they watch, we'll make\nit work. Pick the straw with the crimp in the end--I can do that, even\nif I can't push one out further again. I tell you, nothing's going to\nhappen to you.\"\n\n\"But Bill--\" she began.\n\nI hit the door, slamming it open. Muller sat on a narrow couch with\nJenny on his lap. I took off for him, not wasting a good chance when\nhe was handicapped. But I hadn't counted on Jenny. She was up, and\nher head banged into my stomach before I knew she was coming. I felt\nthe wind knocked out, but I got her out of my way--to look up into the\nmuzzle of a gun in Muller's hands.\n\n\"You'll explain this, Mr. Tremaine,\" he said coldly. \"In ten seconds,\nI'll have an explanation or a corpse.\"\n\n\"Go ahead,\" I told him. \"Shoot, damn you! You'll get away with this,\ntoo, I suppose. Mutiny, or something. And down in that rotten soul of\nyours, I suppose you'll be gloating at how you made fools of us. The\nonly man on board who was safe even from a lottery, and we couldn't\nsee it. Jenny, I hope you'll be happy with this butcher. Very happy!\"\n\nHe never blinked. \"Say that about the only safe man aboard again,\" he\nsuggested.\n\nI repeated it, with details. But he didn't like my account. He turned\nto Eve, and motioned for her to take it up. She was frowning harder,\nand her voice was uncertain, but she summed up our reasons quickly\nenough.\n\nAnd suddenly Muller was on his feet. \"Mr. Tremaine, for a damned\nidiot, you have a good brain. You found the key to the problem, even\nif you couldn't find the lock. Do you know what happens to a captain\nwho permits a death lottery, even what I called a legal one? He\ndoesn't captain a liner--he shoots himself after he delivers his ship,\nif he's wise! Come on, we'll find the one indispensable man. You stay\nhere, Jenny--you too, Eve!\"\n\nJenny whimpered, but stayed. Eve followed, and he made no comment. And\nthen it hit me. The man who had _thought_ he was indispensable, and\nhence safe--the man I'd naturally known in the back of my head could\nbe replaced, though no one else had known it until a little while ago.\n\n\"He must have been sick when you ran me in as a ringer,\" I said, as we\nwalked down toward the engine hatch. \"But why?\"\n\n\"I've just had a wild guess as to part of it,\" Muller said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWilcox was listening to the Buxtehude when we shoved the door of his\nroom open, and he had his head back and eyes closed. He snapped to\nattention, and reached out with one hand toward a drawer beside him.\nThen he dropped his arm and stood up, to cut off the tape player.\n\n\"Mr. Wilcox,\" Muller said quietly, holding the gun firmly on the\nengineer. \"Mr. Wilcox, I've detected evidence of some of the Venus\ndrugs on your two assistants for some time. It's rather hard to miss\nthe signs in their eyes. I've also known that Mr. Grundy was an\naddict. I assumed that they were getting it from him naturally. And as\nlong as they performed their duties, I couldn't be choosy on an old\nship like this. But for an officer to furnish such drugs--and to\nsmuggle them from Venus for sale to other planets--is something I\ncannot tolerate. It will make things much simpler if you will\nsurrender those drugs to me. I presume you keep them in those bottles\nof wine you bring aboard?\"\n\nWilcox shook his head slowly, settling back against the tape machine.\nThen he shrugged and bowed faintly. \"The chianti, sir!\"\n\nI turned my head toward the bottles, and Eve started forward. Then I\nyelled as Wilcox shoved his hand down toward the tape machine. The gun\ncame out on a spring as he touched it.\n\nMuller shot once, and the gun missed Wilcox's fingers as the\nengineer's hand went to his hip, where blood was flowing. He collapsed\ninto the chair behind him, staring at the spot stupidly. \"I cut my\nteeth on _tough_ ships, Mr. Wilcox,\" Muller said savagely.\n\nThe man's face was white, but he nodded slowly, and a weak grin came\nonto his lips. \"Maybe you didn't exaggerate those stories at that,\" he\nconceded slowly. \"I take it I drew a short straw.\"\n\n\"Very short. It wasn't worth it. No profit from the piddling sale of\ndrugs is worth it.\"\n\n\"There's a group of strings inside the number one fuel locker,\" Wilcox\nsaid between his teeth. The numbness was wearing off, and the\nshattered bones in his hip were beginning to eat at him. \"Paul, pull\nup one of the packages and bring it here, will you?\"\n\nI found it without much trouble--along with a whole row of others,\nfine cords cemented to the side of the locker. The package I drew up\nweighed about ten pounds. Wilcox opened it and scooped out a\nthimbleful of greenish powder. He washed it down with wine.\n\n\"Fatal?\" Muller asked.\n\nThe man nodded. \"In that dosage, after a couple of hours. But it cuts\nout the pain--ah, better already. I won't feel it. Captain, I was\nnever piddling. Your ship has been the sole source of this drug to\nMars since a year or so after I first shipped on her. There are about\nseven hundred pounds of pure stuff out there. Grundy and the others\nwould commit public murder daily rather than lose the few ounces a\nyear I gave them. Imagine what would happen when Pietro conscripted\nthe _Wahoo_ and no drugs arrived. The addicts find out no more is\ncoming--they look for the peddlers--and _they_ start looking for their\nsuppliers....\"\n\nHe shrugged. \"There might have been time and ways, if I could have\ngotten the ship back to Earth or Jupiter. It might have been\nrecommissioned into the Earth-Mars-Venus run, even. Pietro's\ninjunction caught me before I could transship, but with another\nchance, I might have gotten the stuff to Mars in time.... Well, it was\na chance I took. Satisfied?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEve stared at him with horrified eyes. Maybe I was looking the same.\nIt was plain enough now. He'd planned to poison the plants and drive\nus back. Murder of Hendrix had been a blunder when he'd thought it\nwasn't working properly. \"What about Sam?\" I asked.\n\n\"Blackmail. He was too smart. He'd been sure Grundy was smuggling the\nstuff, and raking off from him. He didn't care who killed Hendrix as\nmuch as how much Grundy would pay to keep his mouth shut--with murder\naround, he figured Grundy'd get rattled. The fool did, and Sam smelled\nbigger stakes. Grundy was bait to get him down near here. I killed\nhim.\"\n\n\"And Lomax?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Maybe he was bluffing. But he kept going from room to\nroom with a pocketful of chemicals, making some kind of tests. I\ncouldn't take a chance on his being able to spot chromazone. So I had\nGrundy give him my keys and tell him to go ahead--then jump him.\"\n\nAnd after that, when he wasn't quite killed, they'd been forced to\nfinish the job. Wilcox shrugged again. \"I guess it got out of hand.\nI'll make a tape of the whole story for you, Captain. But I'd\nappreciate it if you'd get Napier down here. This is getting pretty\nmessy.\"\n\n\"He's on the way,\" Eve said. We hadn't seen her call, but the doctor\narrived almost immediately afterwards.\n\nHe sniffed the drug, and questioned us about the dose Wilcox had\ntaken. Then he nodded slowly. \"About two hours, I'd say. No chance at\nall to save him. The stuff is absorbed almost at once and begins\nchanging to something else in the blood. I'll be responsible, if you\nwant.\"\n\nMuller shrugged. \"I suppose so. I'd rather deliver him in irons to a\njury, but.... Well, we still have a lottery to hold!\"\n\nIt jerked us back to reality sharply. Somehow, I'd been fighting off\nthe facts, figuring that finding the cause would end the results. But\neven with Wilcox out of the picture, there were twelve of us left--and\nair for only ten!\n\nWilcox laughed abruptly. \"A favor for a favor. I can give you a better\nanswer than a lottery.\"\n\n\"Pop-corn! Bullard!\" Eve slapped her head with her palm. \"Captain,\ngive me the master key.\" She snatched it out of his hand and was gone\nat a run.\n\nWilcox looked disappointed, and then grinned. \"Pop-corn and beans. I\noverlooked them myself. We're a bunch of city hicks. But when Bullard\nforgot his fears in his sleep, he remembered the answer--and got it so\nmessed up with his dream and his new place as a hero that my complaint\ntipped the balance. Grundy put the fear of his God into him then. And\nyou didn't get it. Captain, you don't dehydrate beans and\npop-corn--they come that way naturally. You don't can them, either, if\nyou're saving weight. They're seeds--put them in tanks and they grow!\"\n\nHe leaned back, trying to laugh at us, as Napier finished dressing his\nwound. \"Bullard knows where the lockers are. And corn grows pretty\nfast. It'll carry you through. Do I get that favor? It's simple\nenough--just to have Beethoven's Ninth on the machine and for the\nwhole damned lot of you to get out of my cabin and let me die in my\nown way!\"\n\nMuller shrugged, but Napier found the tape and put it on. I wanted to\nsee the louse punished for every second of worry, for Lomax, for\nHendrix--even for Grundy. But there wasn't much use in vengeance at\nthis point.\n\n\"You're to get all this, Paul,\" Wilcox said as we got ready to leave.\n\"Captain Muller, everything here goes to Tremaine. I'll make a tape on\nthat, too. But I want it to go to a man who can appreciate Hohmann's\nconducting.\"\n\nMuller closed the door. \"I guess it's yours,\" he admitted. \"Now that\nyou're head engineer here, Mr. Tremaine, the cabin is automatically\nyours. Take over. And get that junk in the fuel locker cleaned\nout--except enough to keep your helpers going. They'll need it, and\nwe'll need their work.\"\n\n\"I'll clean out his stuff at the same time,\" I said. \"I don't want any\npart of it.\"\n\nHe smiled then, just as Eve came down with Bullard and Pietro. The fat\ncook was sobered, but already beginning to fill with his own\nimportance. I caught snatches as they began to discuss Bullard's\nknowledge of growing things. It was enough to know that we'd all\nlive, though it might be tough for a while.\n\nThen Muller gestured upwards. \"You've got a reduced staff, Dr. Pietro.\nDo you intend going on to Saturn?\"\n\n\"We'll go on,\" Pietro decided. And Muller nodded. They turned and\nheaded upwards.\n\nI stood staring at my engines. One of them was a touch out of phase\nand I went over and corrected it. They'd be mine for over two\nyears--and after that, I'd be back on the lists.\n\nEve came over beside me, and studied them with me. Finally she sighed\nsoftly. \"I guess I can see why you feel that way about them, Paul,\"\nshe said. \"And I'll be coming down to look at them. But right now,\nBullard's too busy to cook, and everyone's going to be hungry when\nthey find we're saved.\"\n\nI chuckled, and felt the relief wash over me finally. I dropped my\nhand from the control and caught hers--a nice, friendly hand.\n\nBut at the entrance I stopped and looked back toward the cabin where\nWilcox lay. I could just make out the second movement of the Ninth\nbeginning.\n\nI never could stand the cheap blatancy of Hohmann's conducting.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Let'em Breathe Space, by Lester del Rey\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK LET'EM BREATHE SPACE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 31286-8.txt or 31286-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/1/2/8/31286/\n\nProduced by Sankar Viswanathan, Greg Weeks, and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
