Extensive research did not uncover any\nevidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n\n\n[Sidenote: Elvin wasn't sure how it had started--maybe it was the\nSchermerhorn twins--or the mysterious \"meteorite\"--or else the world had\ngone crazy....]\n\n\nHe tried to convince himself he had no right to gripe. It was a pleasant\nplace to live; he had privacy and a bath of his own. And the\nSchermerhorns were reasonably broadminded people. They never objected to\nhis smoking or an occasional glass of beer. Last year at the\nNeuhavens'--Gary Elvin cringed inwardly at the recollection.\n\nJust the same, this was going too far. It was enough to endure their\nkids all day long, five days of the week, without the addition of these\njuvenile parties. This one had started an hour after dinner and it was\nstill going strong when Elvin returned from the late show at the Fox.\n\nNaturally the Schermerhorn twins were popular tenth graders--husky,\nblond Greek Gods who had everything, including a red Convertible and a\nswimming pool Pop Schermerhorn had built for them at the ranch. Gary\nElvin had expected a certain number of parties when he decided to board\nand room with the Schermerhorns, but hardly one every weekend.\n\nHe fled through the cluttered hall where a buxom lass was organizing\nsomething called a bubble gum contest and took refuge on the damp and\ndeserted patio. He flung himself on a wet, canvas lounge, and looked up\nat the bright night sky.\n\nBitterly he counted off the weeks. It was still early in November. He\nhad eight more months to endure before June came with its temporary\nillusion of escape. As he always did, Elvin resolved to find a better\njob next year. He had been teaching for five years now. He knew all the\ntricks of classroom control and smooth community relations. Surely if he\nstarted looking early enough, he ought to be able to get something at a\nsmall college....\n\nSuddenly he was jerked back to reality by a curious spot of red that\nappeared in the sky. It moved closer and he saw that it was a falling\nobject followed by a long plume of red flame. It flashed momentarily\noverhead and Elvin heard a dull thud as it fell into a field beyond the\nranch house.\n\nHe sprang up from the couch and moved off in the darkness. It had been a\nmeteorite, of course; if it had survived the friction of the atmosphere\nit would make an interesting exhibit for the science classroom. Miss\nGerken would be glassy-eyed with pleasure.\n\nThere was no moon. As soon as he crossed the driveway, Elvin stumbled\nover the damp furrows of a newly ploughed field. He was sweating when he\nreached the row of palms that lined the irrigation ditch. He paused to\nwipe his face.\n\nAnd he heard a weird, shrill, rhythmic sound. It might have been called\nmusic, but there was no definable melody or beat. It was faint at first,\nbut as he moved to the right, paralleling the ditch, the sound came\nlouder.\n\n[Illustration: As he cautiously approached the alien object, it seemed\nas if a soft melody were being wafted on the night breeze. The sound\nmade him nervous and instilled fear....]\n\nThen, beyond the trees, in a glow of blue light emanating from the thing\nitself, he saw the rocket. It was not quite five feet long, a slim\nprojectile of glowing metal nosed deeply into the soft earth. The four\nfins were rotating slowly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGary Elvin might, quite properly, have been frightened, but he was\ntotally unacquainted with modern fiction dealing with the probable\npotentials of science and the universes beyond the earth. Such material\nhe classified, along with comic books and television, as the pap of\nmediocre minds.\n\nNow, when he first saw the rocket, he came to the somewhat prosaic\nconclusion that it had strayed from the government experimental site at\nMuroc. He walked closer. The glow of the metal brightened; the slow\nrotation of the fins and the weird music became hypnotic. For a moment\nElvin felt a surge of fear. He tried to turn away, but he could not.\n\nInstead, moving against his will, he took two of the fins in his hands\nand pulled on them. The rotation and the music stopped as the tailpiece\nof the rocket fell open. Elvin's mind cleared as he looked into a tiny\nchamber capped by a small rectangular sheet of metal which was dotted\nwith tiny globes of a translucent material. Gingerly he picked up the\nseal.\n\nAs he touched the metal, a strange sensation, like a flood of jumbled\nwords, tumbled through his mind. The feeling was neither unpleasant nor\nfrightening. He was tempted to relax and enjoy it; and he would have, if\nhe had not been distracted by a second object in the chamber. He thrust\nthe strip of metal into the pocket of his coat.\n\nElvin's second find was a small, transparent cylinder, filled with tiny,\nmulti-colored spheres, exactly like a jar of hard candy. There was\nnothing else in the rocket, except for the motor built into the\ntailpiece. The blue glow of the rocket began to fade.\n\nVaguely Elvin became aware that something was amiss. He began to suspect\nthat he had stumbled upon something more than a stray rocket from Muroc.\nHe wanted to tell somebody about it. Clutching the cylinder of colored\nballs he ran back to the house.\n\nThe party had reached one of its numerous climaxes. The hall was jammed\nwith chattering high school students. They swirled in a flood around\nMrs. Schermerhorn, who seemed to be enjoying herself as much as they\nwere.\n\nGary Elvin grabbed her arm. \"I've found a rocket!\" he cried.\n\n\"Rocket?\" she frowned for a moment, and then smiled brightly. \"Oh, the\nracket. Yes, but they do have so much energy, don't they?\"\n\nHe held up the cylinder. \"This was in it!\"\n\n\"Oh, you found it, Mr. Elvin. We looked high and low; now we--\"\n\n\"It was in the rocket.\"\n\n\"... now we can have our contest.\"\n\nDesperately a new idea occurred to him. \"Can you get these kids quiet? I\nwant to 'phone.\"\n\n\"But it's so early, Mr. Elvin. We can't expect them to go home yet.\"\n\n\"No, Mrs. Schermerhorn. 'Phone. I want to telephone!\"\n\n\"Oh. Yes; of course. We'll have our contest in the living room.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGary Elvin wormed his way toward the closet under the stairway. It was a\nvery small telephone alcove, not designed for utility. Yet he found he\ncould shut out some of the din if he jackknifed himself against the\nslanting wall and held the door partly shut.\n\nBut it required the use of both his hands. He set the cylinder on a\nbookcase in the hall and squeezed into the closet. With the telephone in\nhis hand, he hesitated. It had seemed a good idea a moment ago--to call\nin the Authorities. But, to bring the generalization down to specifics,\njust who would that be?\n\nIn a big city he would have telephoned the police. But San Benedicto was\na California valley town, small, sleepy, and contented. The four-man\npolice force was more or less capable of handling minor traffic\nviolations, but certainly nothing else. The State Police? Elvin doubted\nthey would have jurisdiction. His last, feeble resort seemed to be the\n_San Benedicto News_, a daily, four-page advertising circular that\npassed, locally, for a newspaper. Elvin called the editor-reporter at\nhis home.\n\nAfter he had told his story, Elvin had to suffer a certain standardized\nbanter concerning the advisability of changing his brand of bourbon. It\nwas entirely meaningless, a form of humor enjoyed by the valley people.\nMatt Henderson eventually agreed that the strange rocket might bear\ninvestigation.\n\n\"I'll be out first thing in the morning,\" he promised.\n\n\"In the morning! Listen, Matt, this thing may be--it might--\" He was\nunable to crystalize his reasons for urgency. He finished lamely, \"It's\nimportant, I think.\"\n\n\"It ain't going to run away, is it?\"\n\n\"No, but--\"\n\n\"Then we can both get a good night's sleep.\"\n\nGary Elvin turned away from the telephone, vaguely dissatisfied. He felt\nthat something ought to be done immediately. What, he didn't know, or\nwhy. He went to get his cylinder of colored spheres from the bookcase\nwhere he had left it. The jar was gone.\n\nHe heard a burst of talk in the living room and he was suddenly\nfrightened. From the archway he looked in on the guests, some thirty\nyoungsters, all of the tenth grade of San Benedicto High School. They\nsprawled over chairs and couches, or they sat, Indian fashion, on the\nfloor. Mrs. Schermerhorn stood in the center of the room, like a judge,\nsmiling patiently. All thirty of the guests were chewing industriously.\nOn the floor stood Elvin's jar of colored spheres, open and more than\nhalf-empty.\n\n\"Oh, dear,\" Mrs. Schermerhorn protested, turning to Elvin. \"Something\nseems wrong with their gum. They've tried and tried, but I haven't seen\na single bubble. And it did seem such a clever game! I suppose if the\ngum were stale--\" Her voice trailed off when she saw the horror on\nElvin's face.\n\nWordlessly he pointed at the open jar. The room fell silent. All thirty\nof the youngsters looked at him. Their chomping jaws became motionless.\n\n\"Is--is that mine?\" he whispered hoarsely.\n\n\"The jar you brought in?\" Mrs. Schermerhorn asked. \"I don't know, Mr.\nElvin, I'm sure. Mabel Travis was supposed to bring the gum for the\ncontest, and she forgot where--\"\n\n\"But mine wasn't gum.\" He licked his lips, uncomfortable in the focus of\nso many staring eyes. \"A--a rocket of some sort fell in the field, just\nbeyond the irrigation ditch. I found the cylinder inside. It might\nbe--it could be--anything.\"\n\nElvin had the strange sensation, for almost ten seconds, of looking at a\nmotion picture film that had stopped at a single frame. Then, as if the\nprojector had started to run again, all thirty of the youngsters broke\ninto activity. For another second the analogy of the film persisted;\nElvin had the elusive impression that each of the youngsters was\ncarefully playing a part.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey clamored to go out and see the rocket. Mrs. Schermerhorn protested\nthat they would ruin their clothes trailing over the fields after dark.\nThe guests allowed themselves to be talked into putting off their\ncuriosity until morning. As their excited talk faded, Mabel Travis\nlooked up at Elvin.\n\n\"Was your jar the one on the bookcase, Mr. Elvin?\" she asked, eyeing him\nwith her enormous, blue eyes.\n\n\"Yes. Is that where you got--\"\n\n\"No.\" The room was still again, and all the youngsters were looking at\nher with a peculiar anxiety. \"I thought that was one of the prizes. You\nknow, when we played forfeits earlier in the--\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Mrs. Schermerhorn put in. \"Bill Blake did win a jar of\ncandy, didn't he?\"\n\n\"And that's what I thought the jar was when I saw it on the bookcase,\"\nMary Travis continued. \"So I took it upstairs and put it with our coats\nin the bedroom. I'll get it for you, Mr. Elvin.\" Slowly she picked up\nthe nearly empty jar on the floor and recapped it. \"I'm going to take\nthis back to the drugstore tomorrow morning and demand my money back. I\ncertainly don't like being cheated!\"\n\nWhen she returned to the living room, she handed Elvin his cylinder of\ncolored balls and slowly his fear dissipated. Until a competent\nauthority analyzed the contents, the jar represented unknown danger. It\nmight be harmless; but it could also be an explosive, a form of fuel for\nthe rocket, perhaps even germ colonies used in biological warfare. If\nBill Blake had taken it home with him as an innocent jar of candy--Elvin\nshuddered.\n\nThe party broke up and Elvin went to his room. He hung his suit\ncarefully at the back of his closet to preserve the creases and thereby\ncut down on his cleaning bill. After five years of living on a teacher's\nsalary, such economies had become second nature with him. He brought out\nhis blue serge and hung it on the door; it was the suit he would wear\nnext week to school.\n\nSaturday dawned crisply sunny. Elvin shaved and dressed leisurely.\nThrough the dormer windows of his room he saw the rich, black fields\nthat surrounded the ranch house and the distant ridge of misty mountains\nbeyond the desert, one or two of them crested with snow.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Schermerhorns, of course, were already awake and busy. Elvin heard\nthe clatter of dishes in the kitchen. He saw the twins, David and\nDonald, tall and muscular in their tight jeans and brilliant plaid\nshirts, working in their shop back of the garage. Pop Schermerhorn was\nin conference with a score of day laborers clustered around the\nhalf-dozen tractors in the drive. Through the open garage door Elvin\ncould see the Schermerhorn Cadillac, the station wagon, and the red\nConvertible that belonged to the twins.\n\nThe scene could be duplicated, with minor variations, on any day of the\nweek. Elvin always resented the Schermerhorn prosperity, even though Pop\nSchermerhorn had been kind enough to offer him board and room when it\nwas obvious the family did not need the additional income.\n\nElvin never allowed himself to forget that the Schermerhorns owned one\nof the largest ranches in the valley as well as the feed store in San\nBenedicto and a half-interest in the bank. Yet Pop Schermerhorn actually\nboasted that he had never gone past the eighth grade in school, and his\nkids were fortunate to be considered mentally normal. Elvin had the\ntwins in class; he knew the limits of their ability. Donald had an I.Q.\nof 89, David of 85.\n\nYet such a family literally rolled in money, while Elvin was like a\nslum-dweller staring emptily into a crowded shop window.\n\nMatt Henderson turned in from the main highway as Elvin finished\nbreakfast. He joined the reporter and they walked out to the field\nbeyond the irrigation ditch. In daylight the terrain was very different.\nElvin backtracked over the same ground several times before it dawned on\nhim that he could not locate the rocket.\n\nPerspiration beaded his face. That was impossible! The rocket was large\nenough to be seen from any point in the field. Even if some part of the\nmechanism had caused it to rise again during the night, Elvin would have\nfound the gaping hole the point of the projectile had torn in the earth.\nBut there was nothing. Not a furrow in the ploughed field was disturbed.\n\nVisibly amused, Matt Henderson departed, repeating his formula about\nbrands of liquor. This time, Elvin thought, the reporter actually\nbelieved it. Elvin walked back to the ranch. He was very angry; but,\nmore than that, he was coldly afraid--and he had no idea what he was\nafraid of.\n\nThe Schermerhorn twins stopped him as he crossed the driveway.\n\n\"You sure made us bite on that one, Mr. Elvin,\" Donald said good\nnaturedly.\n\n\"Yeah,\" David added. \"All the kids came over early this morning to see\nyour rocket.\"\n\n\"I guest we deserve it, though,\" Donald went on philosophically, \"for\npulling that deal on you in class last week.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGary Elvin went up to his room in a daze and sat staring at the bottle\nof colored spheres. It seemed entirely clear what had happened last\nnight; yet, conceivably, the rocket could have been an hallucination. If\nso, it was because of the grinding frustrations of his job. But Elvin\nhad a good mind; he did not have to let a bunch of discourteous\nrattle-brained kids get him down. David and Donald had given him the\nclue: the rocket was simply a practical joke he had played on his class\nof tenth graders.\n\nThe second step in driving out the \"dream\" was an appeal to authority.\nHe must understand the limits of scientific possibility in the use of\nrockets. That meant a trip to the library. Although it was four miles to\nSan Benedicto, Elvin decided to walk; the exercise would help clear his\nhead.\n\nHe entered the library at eleven-thirty, half an hour before the\nbuilding was closed for the weekend. It was a good library. The\nassessment rate in prosperous San Benedicto was high, and books had been\npurchased wisely. In the card catalogue Elvin found listed a number of\nup-to-date references that he could use; but there was nothing on the\nshelves. Five minutes before closing time, he asked the librarian for\nhelp.\n\n\"I don't suppose there's anything in,\" she answered. \"We've had a\nperfect run on books all morning.\"\n\n\"You mean everything in the library is out?\"\n\n\"Everything worthwhile.\" She beamed. \"And most of the borrowers were\nyour tenth graders, too, Mr. Elvin. You've certainly done a wonderful\njob of inspiring that class to do serious reading. Why, do you know\nMabel Travis has been in here three times today? She took out seven\nbooks as soon as the library opened, and she had them back by\nnine-thirty. Said she'd read them all, too.\"\n\n\"Seven books in less than two hours?\" Elvin laughed.\n\n\"I suppose she thought she had. Poor little Mabel! She hasn't much to\nwork with, you know. But it was her new attitude I liked--so intense, so\nserious. And she was doing such heavy reading, too.\"\n\nElvin walked back to the Schermerhorn ranch, enjoying the noon-day\nwarmth. San Benedicto was crowded with Saturday shoppers. He met his\nstudents everywhere, and always they commented on the practical joke he\nhad played on them. By the time he was back in his room, the fiction of\nthe joke was thoroughly established in his own mind. He almost believed\nit himself.\n\nHe glanced again at the transparent cylinder of spheres. A chemist might\nbe able to analyze the contents and say where the jar had originated.\nPerhaps Miss Gerkin could do it. She had taught science for more than\ntwenty years at San Benedicto High. Yet Elvin knew he couldn't ask her\nfor help. If the colored balls turned out to be nothing more than hard\ncandy, then by inescapable logic he would have to accept the fact that\nhe was suffering from a major hallucination. It was more comfortable not\nto know the truth.\n\nThe idea of candy, however, brought up another association. Mrs.\nSchermerhorn had said that earlier in the evening Bill Blake had won a\njar of candy as a prize. Bill Blake was the prize joker of the tenth\ngrade. Elvin had what seemed to be an intuitive flash of understanding.\nThe rocket had been a joke, all right, but it had been aimed at Elvin.\nThe kids had rigged it up before he came home from the show. During the\nnight they had come back and taken the stage setting away.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nElvin spent the rest of the weekend planning his revenge. He didn't\nthink of it as that, but rather disciplinary action. Yet he knew the\nclass would get the point and possibly even heed the implied warning. In\nfive years Elvin had reduced the complex process of teaching to one\nworkable rule: break the class, or the kids will break you.\n\nNow he chose the classical cat-whip of a surprise test to crack them\nback into line. He spent Sunday planning it and duplicating the pages.\nHe was scrupulously careful to be fair--at least as he defined the term.\nThe examination covered nothing that had not been discussed in class.\nBut Elvin taught grammar, and no field of the abstract allows such\ndevious application of the flimsy nonsense passing for rules.\n\nOn Monday morning, with a thin smile, Elvin was ready for them. He had\ntenth grade English first period. As he passed out the mimeographed\npages, he waited for waves of groaning to sweep the room. Nothing\nhappened. He felt an annoying pang of anger. A hand shot up.\n\n\"Yes, Charles?\" he snapped.\n\n\"If we finish before the end of the period, can we have free reading?\"\n\n\"I doubt you'll finish, Charles. This test is ten pages long.\"\n\n\"But if we do--\"\n\n\"By all means, yes.\"\n\nGary Elvin leaned back in his chair and surveyed, with satisfaction, the\nthirty heads bent studiously over their desks. For perhaps five minutes\nthe idyll lasted, until Donald Schermerhorn brought his test up to the\ndesk and asked permission to go to the library. Elvin was both amazed\nand disappointed; but at once he reassured himself. The test had been\nsimply too hard for Donald.\n\nNonetheless, as soon as Donald was out of the room, Elvin checked his\nexamination against the key. As he turned through the pages, his fingers\nbegan to tremble. Donald had answered everything--and answered it\ncorrectly. Before Elvin had finished checking Donald's test, ten more\nstudents had left theirs on the desk and headed for the school library.\n\nWithin ten minutes Elvin was fighting a disorganizing bewilderment far\nworse than the rocket-hallucination. Every examination was completed,\nand none that he checked had as much as one mistake. Elvin wished he\ncould believe that whole-sale cheating had taken place, but he knew that\nwas impossible because of the precautions he always took.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll of the tenth graders were back from the library by that time. They\nhad each brought two or more books. Elvin's body went rigid with anger\nwhen he saw what was currently passing among them for the skill of\nreading. They were methodically turning pages almost as quickly as they\ncould move their hands from one side of the books to the other, all with\nthe appearance of engrossed attention.\n\nElvin banged a ruler on his desk. One or two faces looked up. \"This has\ngone far enough!\" he cried. \"You asked for the privilege of free\nreading, but I do not intend you to make a farce of it.\" A hand went up.\n\"Yes, Marilyn?\"\n\n\"But we are reading, Mr. Elvin. Honestly.\"\n\n\"Oh, I see.\" His voice was thickly sarcastic. \"And what's the title of\nyour book?\"\n\n\"Toynbee's _Study of History_.\"\n\n\"You've given up Grace Livingston Hill? Could you summarize Toynbee for\nus, Marilyn?\"\n\n\"In another ten minutes, Mr. Elvin. I still have sixty pages to read.\"\n\nElvin turned savagely to another girl. \"Mabel Travis! What are you\nreading?\"\n\nThe buxom girl looked up languidly. For a split second her big eyes\nseemed focused on a distant prospective. \"Why--why this, Mr. Elvin.\" She\nheld up her book so he could see the title.\n\n\"_Hypnotism in Theory and Practice_,\" he snorted. And Mabel's I/Q was\n71! \"You've outgrown the comics, Mabel?\"\n\n\"In a sense, yes, Mr. Elvin.\"\n\nElvin was saved from further disorientation by the interruption of an\noffice messenger with a special bulletin announcing a second period\nassembly. By the time he had read it, his anger was under control. He\nlet the reading go on and spent the rest of the period plodding through\nthe examinations. There was not an error in any of the papers. From the\nprospective of the day's events, Elvin later realized that, however\npersonally unnerving, his own particular crisis had been a minor one.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe first full scale public disaster came during the assembly, when the\nentire student body--nearly one hundred and fifty youngsters--was\ngathered in the auditorium. The principal, as always, rose to lead them\nin the Alma Mater. He was a huge, hatchet-faced, white-haired man, the\nterror of evil-doer and faculty members alike. He had a tendency to give\na solemn importance to trivial things and to overlook the great ones;\nand there was no mistaking the awed, almost religious fervor with which\nhe sang the school song--which was, perhaps, only natural, since he had\nwritten it himself.\n\nOn that disastrous morning he suddenly burst into a dance as the student\nbody barrelled into the first chorus. He snatched up the startled girls'\ncounselor and improvised a little rumba. Slowly the students' voices\nfell silent as they watched. Under the sweating leadership of the music\nteacher, the school orchestra held the pace for another bar or two,\nuntil one of the players stood up and rendered a discordant hot lick on\nhis trumpet.\n\nA trio of caretakers carried the struggling principal off the platform\nand shouting teachers herded the students on to their next classes.\nThirty minutes later the word-of-mouth information was carefully spread\nthrough the school that the principal had been taken to the hospital for\nobservation and he was doing nicely. But by that time his fate seemed\nunimportant, for the girls' tenth grade gym teacher was having hysterics\non the front lawn, convinced that all her students had turned into fish;\nand the boys' glee club teacher had abruptly announced that the nation\nwas being invaded by Martians. He, too, had been carried off to the\nhospital in haste.\n\nThe rest of the faculty was badly shaken. When they met at lunch, they\nunanimously wanted the school closed for the rest of the day. But the\nprincipal had been too small a man to delegate any of his authority; as\nlong as he was hospitalized, the teachers could do nothing.\n\nAfter the ominous activity of the morning, however, most of the\nafternoon passed in relative order. True, the counselor gave pick-up\ntests to three tenth graders whose earlier I.Q. scores had been so low\nthe validity had been questioned; and this time the same three outdid an\nEinstein. And the tenth grade math teacher was almost driven to\ndistraction by a classroom discussion of the algebraic symbology\nequating matter and time--all of which was entirely over his head.\n\nNothing really happened until five minutes before the end of the school\nday, when Miss Gerkin knocked weakly on Gary Elvin's door. As soon as he\nsaw her face, he gave his class free reading and joined her in the hall.\nFearfully she showed him a yellow Bunsen burner, which glowed softly in\nthe afternoon sunlight.\n\n\"Do you know what it is, Gary?\"\n\n\"It's one of those gas burners you have on the lab tables in--\"\n\n\"The metal, I mean.\"\n\n\"Looks like gold. Aren't these rather expensive for a high school\nclassroom?\"\n\nShe sagged against the wall, running her trembling fingers over her thin\nlips. \"It's that tenth grade, Gary. I have them last period for general\nscience. Bill Blake and the Schermerhorn twins got to fooling around\nwith the electro-magnet. They rewired it somehow and added a few--well,\nfrankly, I don't understand at all! But now when anything--metal, glass,\ngranite--when anything is put in the magnetic field, it's changed to\ngold.\"\n\n\"Transmutation of atomic structure? You know it can't be done!\"\n\n\"Yes, I know it. But I saw it happen.\" She began to laugh, but checked\nherself quickly.\n\n\"It's a trick. I know that bunch better than you do. It's time one of us\nhad it out with them.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe strode along the hall toward the science room, Miss Gerkin following\nmeekly behind him. \"I'm sure you're right, Gary, because the rest of the\nclass hardly showed any interest in what the boys were doing. I actually\nasked Marilyn if she didn't want her necklace turned to gold, and she\nsaid she was too busy to bother. Imagine that, from a high school kid!\"\n\n\"Busy doing what?\"\n\n\"Working out the application of the Law of Degravitation, she said.\"\n\n\"The Law of Degravitation? I never heard of it.\"\n\nMiss Gerkin sniffed righteously. \"Neither have I, and I've taught\nscience all my life.\"\n\nGary Elvin flung open the door of the science room. It was one minute\nbefore the end of the period. For a moment he looked in on a peacefully\nideal classroom. Every student was at his bench working industriously.\nThen, row by row, they began to float upward toward the ceiling, each of\nthem holding a tiny coil of thin wires twisted intricately around two\npieces of metal and an electronic tube. The breeze from the open window\ngathered them languidly into a kind of huddle above the door.\n\nThe bell rang as Miss Gerkin began to scream. Elvin fought to hold on to\nhis own sanity as he tried to help her, but a degree of her hysteria\ntransferred itself to him. His mind became a patchwork of yawning blank\nspaces interspersed with uncoordinated episodes of reality.\n\nHe remembered hearing the bell and the rush of the class out of the\nroom. He remembered the piercing screams of Miss Gerkin's terror echoing\nthrough the suddenly crowded halls. Beyond one of his black gulfs of\nno-memory, he was in the nurse's office helping to hold Miss Gerkin on\nthe lounge while the school doctor administered a sedative.\n\nSlowly the integrated pattern of his thinking returned when he was\ndriving back toward the Schermerhorn ranch. It was late in the\nafternoon; the sun was setting redly beyond the ridge of mountains. As\nElvin's fear receded, he was able to think with a kind of hazy clarity.\nHe had seen a metal Bunsen burner that had been turned into gold; he had\nseen the crusty principal of the school break into a rumba, and three of\nhis colleagues driven to hysteria; he had seen a tenth grade class\nfloating unsupported in the air. All of it manifestly absurd and\nimpossible.\n\nBut it had happened. Elvin could visualize only two plausible\nexplanations: mass insanity or mass hypnosis. Hypnosis! A sluggish relay\nclicked in his mind. He remembered a book. One of the tenth graders had\nbeen reading it--_Hypnotism in Theory and Practice_.\n\nEverything seemed clear after that. The tenth grade was an obstreperous\nbunch of unsocial adolescents. Somehow they had stumbled upon hypnotism\nand learned how to use it.\n\nThe time for an accounting had come. Because of where Elvin lived, he\nwas admirably situated to break the Schermerhorn twins first; and they\nwere, perhaps, the weakest members of the group. He would have them\nalone, without the support of their peers. It would be easy. After all,\nhe was a mature adult; they were still children. Once he had a\nconfession from them, it would only be a minor operation to clear up the\nwhole mess.\n\nWhen he reached the Schermerhorn ranch, dinner was on the table. He had\nno time to talk to the twins until afterward. Both David and Donald\nbolted the meal and rushed back to their workshop behind the garage.\nTheir usual bad manners, Elvin realized, but what else could be\nexpected?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nElvin finished a leisurely pipe in the living room, and then sauntered\nout to the boys' workshop. Surprisingly, the door was locked, the\nwindows thickly curtained; they had never taken such precautions before.\nHe knocked and, after a long wait, both David and Donald came outside to\ntalk to him. They were naked to the waist and their husky, tanned bodies\ngleamed with sweat. A smudge of grease was smeared over David's unkempt\nblond hair.\n\n\"Working on your car, boys?\" Elvin inquired indulgently. He knew the\ntechnique. Put them at their ease, first; then come to the point when\ntheir guard was down.\n\n\"Well, not exactly, Mr. Elvin.\" Donald said.\n\n\"Mind if I watch? I always say I can learn as much about motors from you\ntwo as you learn from me about grammar.\"\n\nNeither of the twins said anything. After an uncomfortable silence,\nElvin cleared his throat pointedly. He had never met with such\ndisrespect. If they were his kids, they would long ago have been taught\nproper courtesy for their superiors! To fill the lengthening void, he\nasked.\n\n\"What did you think of the little test I gave this morning?\"\n\n\"It was all right,\" Donald said.\n\n\"You both did pretty well; I'm proud of you.\"\n\n\"We had everything right,\" David pointed out without a flicker of\nexpression.\n\nElvin couldn't seem to engineer the dialogue as he used to. In that\ncase, this was as appropriate a time as any for the question he had come\nto ask. He spoke slowly, with a tone of disinterest. \"Do either of you\nknow anything about hypnotism?\" As a shocker, Elvin realized, it left\nmuch to be desired; their faces told him nothing.\n\n\"A little,\" David volunteered.\n\n\"We read eight or nine books on it over the weekend,\" Donald added.\n\n\"That's a lot of reading. It must have taken a great deal of time.\"\n\n\"Oh, a couple of hours.\"\n\nElvin clenched his fists in futile anger, but he kept his voice steady.\n\"Is anybody else in the tenth grade reading up on hypnotism?\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" Donald admitted. \"I'm not sure. Why don't you ask in\nclass tomorrow?\"\n\n\"It occurs to me that a clever hypnotist could be responsible for what\nhappened at school today.\"\n\n\"Some of it; isn't that rather obvious? We'd like to go on talking, Mr.\nElvin, honest. But we have a lot of work to finish. It'll be bedtime\nsoon enough.\"\n\n\"But you know about hypnotism, don't you?\"\n\n\"We know how it's done, yes, and its limitations so far as genuine\ntelepathy--\"\n\n\"Who created that ridiculous scene in the auditorium?\" Elvin's voice\nrose as he tried to put on pressure.\n\n\"I wouldn't worry about the principal, Mr. Elvin, if I were you. He's\nalways been a neurotic.\"\n\n\"Mighty big words you're using these days, Donald. Where'd you hear\nthem?\"\n\n\"The principal is a little man--mentally, I mean. He's afraid of people\nbecause he isn't sure of himself. So he makes himself a tin god, a\ndictator, just to show the rest of us--\"\n\n\"I want to know where you picked all this up!\"\n\nPatiently the twins began to talk, taking turns at delivering an\nimprovised lecture in psychology, shot through with an array of highly\ntechnical terms. As Elvin listened to their monotonous voices, he slowly\nfelt very tired. His head began to ache as his anger ebbed. More than\nanything else, he wanted a long night's sleep. Yawning wearily, he\nthanked the boys--for what, he wasn't quite sure--and went up to his\nroom.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSome time before dawn Elvin awoke for a moment. He thought he heard the\nsound of a motor in the driveway, but he was too sleepy to get up to see\nwhat it was. Two hours later he awoke to chaos.\n\nMrs. Schermerhorn was shaking his shoulder. He looked up into her white,\nterrified face. Her hand trembled as she clutched her quilted robe close\nto her throat.\n\n\"Mr. Elvin, they'll need your help. Mr. Schermerhorn's waiting for you.\"\n\nHe shook sleep out of his mind sluggishly. \"Why? What's happened?\"\n\n\"The bank's gone. Just--just gone!\"\n\nHe blinked and shook his head again. \"I--I don't think I heard you\nright, Mrs. Schermerhorn.\"\n\n\"There's a jungle where the bank used to be. With tigers in it.\" She\nlaughed wildly for a moment, but the laughter dissolved into tears and\nshe reached for the bottle of smelling salts in the pocket of her robe.\n\"Most of them have been shot by this time, I think. The tigers. Think of\nit, Mr. Elvin--tigers in San Benedicto!\" She began to laugh again.\n\nWhen Elvin joined Pop Schermerhorn and the twins in the station wagon,\nMrs. Schermerhorn followed him out of the house with a thermos of hot\ncoffee. As she put it in the car, she saw the rifles they were taking\nwith them. She began to weep again, clinging desperately to the side of\nthe car. Suddenly the twins knelt beside her, and threw their arms\naround her neck.\n\n\"We're sorry, Mom,\" David whispered. \"Terribly sorry.\"\n\n\"You've nothing to be sorry about,\" she replied. \"It's not your fault.\"\n\n\"Better get back inside,\" Pop Schermerhorn told her. \"Mind, keep the\ndoors locked. Things ain't safe no more around here.\"\n\nAs they drove into San Benedicto, Elvin was considerably puzzled by the\nattitude of the twins. Normally talkative to the point of nausea, they\nwere now strangely quiet. And this was exactly the sort of thing that\nshould have inspired their most adolescent repartee.\n\nThe sun was rising as they stopped the station wagon among the clutter\nof cars filling Main Street. Elvin stared in disbelief at the neat\nsquare of tropical jungle rising cleanly in the heart of San Benedicto.\nNot only the bank but a whole block of business houses was gone. This\ncould be written off neither as insanity nor hypnotism; it was a madness\nexisting in actual fact. Elvin gave up trying to discover any logic in\nwhat was happening. Both reason and natural law seemed to have\nabdicated.\n\nThe periphery of jungle was surrounded by armed men. At intervals they\nshot at shadows lurking among the trees and, as the sun brightened, the\naccuracy of their aim increased. They were not worrying about causes,\neither; they were responding with excellent self-discipline to the\nemergency of tigers roaming the streets of San Benedicto. Afterwards, at\ntheir leisure, they could speculate on how the jungle had come to be\nthere.\n\nThere was only one fatality. A tiger sprang out of the jungle and mauled\na man who had pressed too close. It happened directly in front of the\nSchermerhorn twins. They turned their rifles on the tiger and killed it\ninstantly; but the man was dead, too.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nElvin was surprised to see tears in the eyes of the twins, but he\ncredited it to the unstable emotions of adolescence. Both of them had\nacted with maturity when they faced the tiger; no adult could have done\nmore. Still they wept, even though the man was a stranger.\n\nBy eight o'clock the stirrings in the jungle had stopped. The men began\nto relax. Waitresses from the Bid-a-Wee Cafe brought out doughnuts and\ncoffee and distributed them among the crowd.\n\nThere came, then, a new disturbance at the far end of Main Street, a\nshouting of tumultuous voices. A mob moved slowly into the center of\ntown, clinging to the sides of an antiquated dump truck.\n\n\"Gold! Gold! Gold!\" It was like a chant shouted with ecstatic antiphony.\nThe dump truck stopped and Elvin saw the unbelievable--gleaming heaps of\ngold shoveled like gravel into the back of the vehicle. The driver stood\non the running board, weaving drunkenly.\n\n\"The whole damn' desert,\" he shouted. \"All of it, as far as I could\nsee--all pure gold!\"\n\nHe took a shovel and scattered the nuggets and dust among the throng.\n\"Take all you like. Lots more where this came from!\"\n\nThe mob stirred slowly at first, and then more and more violently, as\nthe men began to race for their cars. The vehicles were already crowded\nclose together. Gears ground and fenders crumbled. The street became\nhelplessly jammed with locked cars. Only a few on the fringe escaped.\nAngry arguments broke out, degenerating into fist fights. The peak\nviolence cooled a little after a few heads had been smashed, and\ngrudgingly the men turned to the task of freeing their cars.\n\nDonald snatched Elvin's arm. \"Stay here with Pop,\" he shouted above the\nclatter. \"Dave and I are going back to the ranch. Mom may need us. The\ndesert runs right up to the edge of our property, you know.\"\n\n\"Going to walk?\"\n\n\"I think we can get the station wagon out. It's pretty far back.\"\n\nElvin and Pop Schermerhorn worked side by side helping untangle the mass\nof vehicles. After an hour order had been more or less restored, and the\nmob had thinned, since each of the freed cars had been driven off at top\nspeed to the desert bonanza.\n\nFor a moment the sky darkened. Elvin looked up. The jungle had\ndisappeared and a medieval castle, complete with knights, had taken its\nplace. The mob shrank back in terror. So did the knights, although one\nor two on the battlements ventured to send shafts into this new enemy\nthat had appeared at the castle gates. But there was no time for real\nhostilities to develop, for the castle vanished and a 19th century\nfactory took its place. The factory survived less than thirty seconds,\nbefore it gave way to the bank and row of stores which had originally\nstood on the site.\n\nFor some reason the crowd began to cheer, as they would a victorious\nfootball team. But the tumult died quickly, for the buildings were\ncovered with a slime of jungle vines, torn up by their roots, and a pair\nof snarling lions stood at bay on the sidewalk. After they had shot the\nlions, they found a cobra was coiled on the cashier's desk in the bank\nand an antelope was imprisoned in the dry goods store. They were still\nclearing out miscellaneous wild life when reporters from the city\nnewspapers, apprised by the _San Benedicto News_ of the gold strike,\ndescended upon the town. They were followed by a deluge of prospectors,\narriving in anything that would move--bicycles and Cadillacs, Model T's\nand Greyhound buses.\n\nThe mob poured into town first by the scores, and then by the thousands.\nPrimarily male, their prevailing mood was explosive instability, a\nglassy-eyed greed flamed higher as each truckload of gold poured back\ninto town from the diggings. The four-man police force was helpless. The\nmajor telegraphed to Sacramento for the National Guard; in the interim,\nhe deputized every townsman he could find, among them Elvin and Pop\nSchermerhorn.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nElvin worked until he was exhausted, herding the mob into the streets\nand through the town as rapidly as they would move; and still there was\nno relief, and the number in the throng increased by the minute.\nNewsreel trucks, television units, press cars twisted among the vehicles\nheading for the desert. Regularly, heavy duty trucks brought tons of\ngold back from the diggings and deposited them at the bank until the\naisles overflowed and the precious metal sifted through the windows\nforming little pyramids in the street. By noon Treasury men flew in from\nWashington. They circled the diggings and landed to inspect the quality\nof the gold hoard at the bank.\n\nFifteen minutes later a rumor filtered among the deputies: the Treasury\nmen estimated that the San Benedicto strike would yield upwards of two\nor three hundred thousand times the known gold supply of the world. When\nthe _San Benedicto News_ came out in mid-afternoon, it headlined the\nfirst shock of the economic disaster.\n\nWorld currencies were collapsing; three nations were already bankrupt;\ninternational trade was grinding to a standstill, with no medium of\nexchange; retail prices in the United States had started to skyrocket,\nin the wake of rising stock market quotations. And still the procession\nof dump trucks brought the tons of gold back from the desert. When the\nbank overflowed the dry goods store was commandeered as an emergency\ndepository, and later the Five-and-Ten and the sprawling basement of\nMontgomery Ward's.\n\nWhen the first contingent of National Guardsmen marched into San\nBenedicto, it was obviously too small to police the mob. The press\nestimated that a quarter of a million people were moving into the valley\nevery hour. More Guard units were summoned and ultimately, at the\nGovernor's request, two regiments of the regular army were dispatched to\nSan Benedicto, along with a Tank Corps and ten thousand Marines from\nCamp Pendleton.\n\nIt was nightfall before the deputies were relieved. Tired and dirty,\nElvin and Pop Schermerhorn rode back to the ranch on a prospector's\ntruck. From the lawn they looked across Schermerhorn's ploughed fields\nat the desert, teeming with mobs of men and bright in the glare of\ncountless searchlights. Mrs. Schermerhorn met them on the porch. She\nclung to her husband's arms, trembling.\n\n\"I'm so glad you're back safely!\" she whispered. \"They've been moving\ncloser all day.\" She nodded toward the desert. \"Like ants, trampling and\ndestroying everything that gets in their way.\"\n\nPop Schermerhorn clenched his fists. \"If they'd broken in here, I'd\nhave--\"\n\n\"If it hadn't been for the twins, I don't know what might have happened.\nThey got their class over here, the whole tenth grade. All day long\nthey've been patrolling our fences, without even stopping long enough to\neat. They're all out in the workshop now; they've made it a kind of\nheadquarters.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe three of them went into the living room. Pop Schermerhorn and Elvin\ndropped wearily on a couch, while Mrs. Schermerhorn poured stiff drinks\nfor both of them. The radio was playing, a smoothly sweet dance\norchestra from San Francisco. But the music faded abruptly, and an\nexcited newscaster interrupted.\n\n\"It's been like this all day,\" Mrs. Schermerhorn said. She looked up\nnervously as the side door opened and the twins came in.\n\n\"We just wanted some more copper wire, Mom, for the thing we're making,\"\nDonald said, but he hesitated when he heard the news broadcast. Both\ntwins dropped silently on the arms of an overstuffed chair and listened.\n\nThe bulletin was brief; it reviewed the growing chaos among the foreign\nexchanges, the expanding list of bankruptcies. Two European nations,\ndriven to internal disaster, had gone to war; already the big powers\nwere choosing sides, framing ultimatums. War seemed to be the one\nuniversal panacea for all things. In New York stores had started to\nquote new dollar prices every hour, although purchases made in silver\nwere still relatively stable at the old value. The grating voice\nconcluded, \"The first estimates of today's yield from the San Benedicto\nfield place it in the neighborhood of seventy-thousand tons; mining\nexperts predict that tomorrow the figure may be tripled.\" As the music\ncame on again, Donald got up and snapped off the radio.\n\n\"The economy of the world's being wrecked, isn't it?\" he asked. \"By too\nmuch gold.\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" Pop Schermerhorn answered, shaking his head.\n\"Gold's valuable; we need it; it makes us rich. But now, when we have\nall we want--\"\n\n\"The trouble is, it has no use,\" David said. \"Governments buy it and\nbury it. If gold becomes as plentiful as iron ore, we still can't do\nmuch with it. You can't make skyscrapers or sewer pipes out of gold;\nit's too soft.\"\n\n\"The government ought to clear out the field and stop the mining,\"\nDonald suggested. \"That might help.\"\n\n\"Not as long as the world knows the gold is still here,\" Elvin answered.\nHe studied the twins carefully; their comment on the economy seemed\nmature for tenth graders. Suddenly Elvin's weary mind began to piece\ntogether a vague kind of understanding, when he remembered the\ntransformation of the Bunsen burner to gold. Beyond his shadowy\ncomprehension loomed the vista of a grandiose dream of how he could use\nthe situation for his own profit. It was intoxicating, like reaching out\nfor the stars and finding them within his grasp.\n\n\"It's all crazy!\" David cried. \"We don't really use gold, anyway, in our\neconomy. Why can't we just forget it, and go on using dollars the way we\nused to?\"\n\n\"Because people are fools,\" Elvin said.\n\n\"Or, perhaps, just children,\" David replied. He stood up, stretching, so\nthat his muscles rippled beneath his plaid shirt. \"Well, we better get\nthat wire, Don, and go back to work.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter the twins had left, Elvin went up to his room to bathe. His mind\nskipped pleasantly over the delightful and limitless possibilities of\nhis new understanding. The whole thing, of course, hinged on his\napproach. But, after all, that shouldn't be hard; they were still\nchildren emotionally. Five years of teaching had demonstrated, to his\nsatisfaction, that he could handle any adolescent.\n\nHe began to dress. The clothes he had worn that day were streaked and\ntorn. He took his second suit out of the closet. As he hung the coat\nover the back of his desk chair, he heard metal strike against the wood.\nIt was the coat he had worn on Friday night, when he found the rocket;\nin the pocket was the strip of metal that had been sealed over the\ncylinder of colored spheres.\n\nHe held it in his hand again. It was the first time the full surface of\nthe metal had touched his skin. As he had before, he felt the sensation\nof jumbled words flooding his mind, but now the feeling was more\nintense. He could not put the metal down. Instead he dropped into his\ndesk chair and his eyes were drawn irresistibly to the pattern of tiny,\ntranslucent globes that dotted the surface of the metal. The heat of his\nbody produced a chemical reaction; one by one the little globes\nexploded.\n\nPictures filled Elvin's mind, of cities, machines, towering stacks of\nbooks. These dissolved, and he saw planets whirling on the black\nemptiness of space around the glowing disk of a red sun. There was a\ncataclysmic splatter of light as the sun exploded, and slashing flame\nshot out to destroy its circling planets. That picture, too, disappeared\nand he was staring at a gray nothingness while an emotional voice spoke\nto him deep within his brain.\n\n\"_To the intelligent life form, on the Third Planet, System K, Greetings\nfrom the dying world of Dyran. You have located our rocket from the\nhypnotichord built into the fins, and, by opening it, you have\ndemonstrated a condition of rationality that we are able to help. We\nspeak to you now through hypnotic pictures which you are translating\ninto the symbology of your own society. Our astronomers predict that our\nplanetary system will shortly be destroyed, because our sun is dying. It\nis useless for us to try to escape, for no world that we can find within\nthe limits of our telescope has the particular combination of\natmospheric gases which we need in order to live. The only sky-body that\nwe have ever studied that gives any indication of higher life forms is\nyours. To you, then, we send the substance of our knowledge, the laws\nand principles that we have developed over a period of two million years\nsince our recorded history began. We could have sent our machines, our\nlibraries of records, yet the chance that you would not comprehend them\nalone is too great. Instead we send our learning capsules, which we use\nin the instruction of our young. Break the container which is sealed\ninto this rocket and consume one of the colored spheres. It is,\nbasically, a stimulant to the cerebral cortex of any reasoning animal\nwhich already has a memory of the past and a concept of the future. Long\nago we discovered that, unaided, the mind will function with only a\nsmall portion of its specialized cells. This stimulant forces conscious\nactivity upon all parts of the cortex; in the process of stimulation,\nyour brain will receive the full knowledge of basic principles which we\nourselves have developed. We send you fifty of these only, but it will\nbe enough. You have not, on your planet, the material with which to make\nadditional capsules for your people, but you will not need them. The\nfifty who learn from these will become teachers for the rest. Carry on\nfor us the culture that we have made on the dying world of Dyran._\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe gray mist faded and Elvin stood up. He felt refreshed, alert; his\nmind bubbled again with schemes. He looked at the bottle of colored\nspheres still standing on his desk, and he knew they were no more than\nbubble gum or candy. On Friday night, while he telephoned, the tenth\ngraders at the Schermerhorn party had started their bubble gum contest,\nbut instead of gum they had by accident absorbed the accumulated\nknowledge of Dyran, a culture more than three hundred times as old as\nthe earth's!\n\nIt was overwhelmingly clear what had happened after that. Thirty\nadolescents, suddenly possessing more knowledge than the world had ever\nknown, had run riot, playing with hypnotism, the transmutation of\nmatter, the Law of Degravitation, the fourth dimensional transposition\nof whole city blocks. Within two days their energetic curiosity, their\nadolescent love of excitement and experiment, had thrown the world into\ncrisis. By this time, Elvin concluded, they would be terrified by a\nfeeling of immense guilt, ready to be told what to do to make amends.\n\nIt was up to him to be the one who did the telling. If, at the same\ntime, he could get his hands on one of the learning capsules--the\nprospect was so dazzling it left him breathless.\n\nHe slipped out to the boys' workshop back of the garage. When he knocked\non the door, Donald opened it two inches and quickly tried to close it\nagain. But Elvin thrust his hand over the latch.\n\n\"No, Donald,\" he said sternly. \"This time you don't get away with it.\nYou see, I know what happened when you ate the spheres.\"\n\nThe door creaked open. Elvin walked into the workshop, where all thirty\nof the tenth graders were gathered around the littered work table. The\nrocket was there, and they were studying the tiny motor. In a corner was\na hastily constructed forge; three girls were working with it, turning\nout curved strips of metal, which a boy was machining on the metal\nlathe. In the center of the shop was a tall, gleaming bar of metal,\nsurrounded by a network of wires and fastened to a wooden base made from\nan orange crate.\n\n\"You're cooking up some more surprises for us?\" Elvin asked.\n\n\"No,\" Donald replied solemnly. \"We're ashamed of--\"\n\n\"As, indeed, you should be.\"\n\n\"We're doing our best to put everything back the way it was,\" Mabel\nTravis said. \"Honestly, Mr. Elvin.\"\n\n\"It won't help much; the damage is already done.\"\n\n\"But it can be undone. We've already fixed up part of it.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" David Schermerhorn cut in anxiously. \"When Don and I came back\nthis morning, the first thing we did was bring back the bank. Our\nmachine's kind of crude, Mr. Elvin, so we couldn't get it right at\nfirst. I guess we picked up a castle or something in between; but that's\nall right, now. And the gold--well, we're going to turn it back to\ngravel again tonight.\" He gestured toward the bar of metal.\n\n\"We can work from the edge of our field,\" David pointed out. \"The whole\ndesert will change at once, the way it did last night.\"\n\n\"And what will you do with all the people on it?\"\n\n\"It won't hurt them.\"\n\n\"But when they find their gold is gravel, you'll have a major\ncatastrophe on your hands.\"\n\nMarilyn bit her lip. \"That's why we haven't done anything yet. We don't\nwant anybody to get hurt but--\"\n\n\"So you've considered that at last.\" The more Elvin rubbed in the guilt,\nhe reasoned, the more secure he would make himself.\n\n\"We could just transpose the whole area,\" Charles suggested. \"We've\nconsidered that, too. Maybe in pieces, Mr. Elvin. You know, an acre or\ntwo to Australia, another to Germany, another to England. That couldn't\ncause much more than local riots.\"\n\n\"But the men would be mighty uncomfortable for a while.\"\n\n\"The only trouble is, our machines are so crude; we've had to build them\nout of scraps. And something could go wrong. We might try to send some\nof the mob to China, and end up putting them in the Pacific, or maybe\nback in time.\"\n\n\"You've done enough tampering,\" Elvin declared. \"I won't help you at\nall, unless you promise to leave everything as it is. You have to put\nyourselves in a position to help the world, not destroy it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nElvin had injected just the right tone of nobility into his voice. The\nthirty adolescents consulted together in whispers. Then David asked,\n\n\"What do you want us to do, Mr. Elvin?\"\n\n\"Let me act as your representative. I'll go to Washington and talk to\nresponsible men in the government; I'll try to see the president\nhimself. We should set up a scientific foundation for you, where you'll\nhave the equipment you need and where your experiments won't do the rest\nof us any harm. But, if I'm to convince anybody, I'm going to have to do\nsome tall talking. If you had one of the capsules left--\"\n\n\"No, Mr. Elvin; they're all gone.\" David was not looking at him, and\nElvin knew he was lying; but this was not the occasion to make an issue\nof it. Above everything else, he had to see to it that they had complete\nfaith in his motives.\n\n\"Then one of your machines,\" he suggested. \"I have to make them\nunderstand I'm not a crank.\"\n\n\"That sounds sensible. Which one, Mr. Elvin? The Degravitational Unit is\nthe smallest, and it would do the least harm if--\" David looked away\nagain. \"--if it got out of your hands.\"\n\n\"It isn't sensational enough. I rather wanted to show them this thing\nyou used to transpose the bank and a square of jungle.\"\n\n\"Oh, no!\" Marilyn broke in. \"We couldn't--\"\n\n\"Why that, Mr. Elvin?\"\n\n\"I've already told you. It's the sort of thing that would attract the\nattention of the important officials immediately, because it could be\nconverted so readily to a weapon of inestimable value.\"\n\nThere was a long silence, while the thirty youngsters looked from one to\nthe other. It lengthened. Elvin felt a creeping edge of fear. David\nspoke at last,\n\n\"I think you're right, Mr. Elvin. We could show the world how to build a\nsociety adjusted to the needs of man; we could develop techniques for\nwiping out disease and mental disorders; we could show you how to\nconserve our resources, how to build material things for the mutual\nhappiness of all people; how to create instead of destroying. But of\ncourse you're right. The only thing that would really interest any of us\nwould be a new weapon, wouldn't it? All right; we'll give it to you.\"\n\nMarilyn sprang up. \"But, David--\"\n\n\"I know what I'm doing!\" he snapped at her in a tense whisper. Turning\nback to Elvin he added smoothly, \"But we'll want something from you\nfirst, Mr. Elvin.\"\n\n\"Anything, my boy; anything to promote the welfare of mankind. But no\nmore of your tricks, mind.\"\n\n\"This is far from a trick, Mr. Elvin.\"\n\n\"So long as that's understood--\"\n\n\"We're working on a machine--a new one. We have everything we need\nexcept tungsten. They use that in building television sets, among other\nthings. I want you to drive down to one of the plants in Los Angeles and\nget us a pound of tungsten. They won't sell it to you; you'll have to\nsteal it.\"\n\n\"Now, David! Only a thick-skulled schoolboy would take such an unsocial\nattitude! I'm a teacher, a responsible citizen, proud--\"\n\n\"Do you want the machine for transposing matter?\"\n\n\"Yes; for the good of the nation. But--\"\n\n\"Then you'll have to take this risk. We'll give you a Degravitational\nUnit. That'll help you get away. When you bring us the tungsten, we'll\ndeliver the transportation machine.\"\n\nElvin made the drive to Los Angeles in record time. The highway was\njammed with traffic, but all of it was moving in the opposite direction,\ntoward San Benedicto. He refused to think of the consequences if he were\ncaught. The glittering dream was still blazing on the horizon of his\nmind. If they refused him the learning capsule, it was unfortunate, but\nthere was nothing he could do about it. The important machine was the\none that transposed matter through time. With that one device alone,\nElvin could sway the world. Placed in the scales against such a reward,\nthe moral issue of theft counted not at all.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLos Angeles whirled chaotically in the monetary crisis. The streets were\njammed with people, buying everything they could before prices jumped\nagain. In the confusion, Elvin had no difficulty breaking into a\ntelevision plant. He didn't trip a burglar alarm until he was leaving\nthe factory, but the Degravitational Unit made his escape easy. Within\nfour hours he was back in San Benedicto. He hurried to the workshop. But\nwhen he pounded on the door, there was no response. He tried the latch\nand the door swung open.\n\nThe room was empty, but on the table was a large envelope addressed to\nhim. A thin thread of wire was fastened to it; as he picked it up, the\nwire broke and somewhere in the distance a motor began to hum.\n\n\"Dear Mr. Elvin,\" he read. \"It was unkind of us to play another trick on\nyou, but we're sure you'll be clever enough to steal the tungsten\nwithout getting caught. When you came to talk to us, we realized that\nthe conclusion we had reached was right. Children--adolescent\nminds--have wrecked our world. You know all about that, Mr. Elvin;\nteachers always do. And you've told us so often in class about the\nunstable emotions of adolescents, their tantrums, their\nunpredictability, their unsocial behavior, their egocentricity and all\nthe rest. We'd like to help, but there isn't much we can do, not really;\nyou just want the machines we know how to make, not the ideas we've\nlearned. We grew up, you see, on the day we turned the desert to gold.\nWe found out what happens when you give children dangerous toys to play\nwith.\n\n\"We made our mistake, and we know how to straighten it out. We've only\nwaited for you to read this so that you would understand, at least for a\nmoment. We have isolated ourselves in suspended time; we're right here\nin the workshop with you, but you can't see us, naturally, because we\nstarted standing still in time more than an hour ago. When you opened\nyour envelope, you tripped the motor of a matter transposition machine\nwhich will throw all time backward to last Friday night. None of this\nwill have happened then. That should straighten everything out, don't\nyou think?\n\n\"You'll find the rocket again, and you'll open it, just as you did\nbefore. But this time there'll be only a jar of bubble gum inside,\nbecause we've already consumed the learning capsules. There won't be any\nmemory left for anyone--except ours. We've learned how to work with a\nplanet of adolescents. We think we can help you mature in spite of\nyourselves; but this time no one will ever know how it is being done.\"\n\nElvin looked up, but before the anger and frustration could crystalize\nin his mind, the yellow lamp dimmed, the walls of the workshop faded and\nvanished. He fought for a moment against the blackness rising in his\nmind. The light paled and paled and finally it was nothing more than a\nred streak in the sky.\n\nIt moved closer and he saw that it was a falling object followed by a\nlong plume of red flame. It flashed momentarily overhead and Elvin heard\na dull thud as it fell in a field beyond the ranch house. He sprang up\nfrom the couch and moved off in the darkness. It had been a meteorite,\nof course; if it had survived the friction of the atmosphere, it would\nmake an interesting exhibit for the science classroom....\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Adolescents Only, by Irving E.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
