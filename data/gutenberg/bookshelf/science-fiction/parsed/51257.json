Immediately the lights lowered\nto Emote Neutral. Long, probing shadow fingers snaked here and there\nacross the floor, and a silence that should have been restful--and\nwasn't--descended on the place.\n\nTony Radek leaned back in his chair and frowned. One-fifteen in the\nmorning. At one-fifteen in the morning no man, no matter who, should be\ngoing to his Neg-Emote. Why not hang a man instead? Or electrocute him?\nOr gas him the way they used to back in the old days? In those old days\nhis grandfather used to talk about, where twelve ordinary citizens said\nthe word that peeled the life off a man like skinning an onion.\n\nHe sighed softly and folded his hands across a tiny paunch that was\njust beginning to show. Tony Radek was getting old. He was a \"safe\"\nnow. That meant he needn't worry about the war any longer. He was\na nice, mild, peaceable gentleman who stayed at home and thought\nbeautiful thoughts about the younger men out in space. A man his age\ndidn't feel anger and hate and retribution and lust and treachery any\nmore. He was just a little old fat guy. He was the Federal Executioner.\n\nHe frowned again and leaned forward and touched a nacre button on the\ndesk top. That lit up the screen on his left. Not the Master Screen,\nwhich was the one on his right. This was the other, the one that could\ntell him what was going on outside the office, outside in _Portal\nWaiting_, where certain peculiar ghouls who derived a measure of\nexcitement from the executions were allowed by the gracious State to\nhang out.\n\nHe stared at the screen. His frown deepened. _Portal Waiting_ should be\nbare and vacant at this hour, but it wasn't. This was the third night\nin a row that it wasn't. There was a girl out there. A quiet girl, a\ngirl who looked about as ghoulish as one of the nice red ritual roses\nover in the cooler built into the wall.\n\n_Damn the dame, why didn't she go home?_ Tony Radek's upper lip lifted\na little, showing small angry teeth.\n\nAt once the Emote Neutral lights in the office flickered wildly. Tony\npulled his eyes from the screen and glared up at the lights. That's\nprogress for you. Let a man go on one little momentary emotional\nbinge, like this, and right away spies in the joint start screaming.\nIn a moment now, the one on his right--the Master Screen--would blink\ninto life and old hell-hips himself would start poking around asking\nquestions. Just see if it didn't.\n\nHe turned his head to the right, stared at the Master Screen and waited.\n\nThe screen blazed into life. A narrow-faced man with washed-away eyes\nthat looked as though they'd seen sin and hadn't liked it peered\nangrily over toward Tony behind the desk.\n\n\"_Mr._ Radek!\" he had a thin, thin voice that sounded like a sheet of\npaper slitting down the middle. \"What's going on down there? Can't you\ncontrol your own office? Or maybe you'd like to be back in Training?\"\nThe eyes squinted sharply.\n\nTony worked up an innocent look. He spread his hands on the black\nsurface of the desk, smiled, and said mildly: \"Out of your mind. My\nlights have been as steady as old Emote Neutral herself. Probably that\nblonde you got Central Direction kidded into thinking you need as an\nassistant--probably you sneaked up on her when she was in Personal Lok\nand....\"\n\n\"What?\" The Master Screen trembled a little and the narrow-faced man's\neyes seemed to jerk out of registration for a moment. \"Look here,\nRadek, I've stood just about enough of your insinuations!\"\n\n\"Look who's making the lights flicker now,\" said Tony calmly. He waved\nan arm around the office. Emote Neutral was flickering rapidly as\nthough controlled by an interrupter switch. \"Central Direction should\nsee this,\" he observed.\n\nHe stared briefly at the contorted face on the screen. That face was\nworking convulsively now, getting red like the ritual roses over in the\ncooler.\n\nHe snorted disgustedly, reached forward and touched the matswitch which\nthrew the Master Screen into visi-lok. At once the screen darkened and\nall sound left the office.\n\nThat was more like it. Let old hell-hips up in Supplies and Control\nstew if he wanted, there wasn't anything in the Constitution--not even\nthe old Constitution--that said a man had to sit and look at him.\n\n\"_Central Direction to Radek!_\" a hard voice rapped out of the\nalternate speaker over in the corner.\n\nTony Radek jerked, spun around. He swallowed quickly, said nervously:\n\"Yes, sir?\"\n\n\"Radek, you're violating Ordinance Six, Code 325, Division of Security!\nUnlock that visi-screen at once!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\" Tony's hand flew to the matswitch, pulled it. \"Sorry. Elbow\nmust have hit it accidentally. Didn't know it was locked....\"\n\n\"Radek, there's a war on. That visi-lok must be used only in emergency.\nYou know that.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. Like I said....\"\n\n\"I heard. In the future, be a little more careful. And, Radek--\"\n\n\"Yes, sir?\"\n\n\"Ready Cell Two. Execution at one-twenty-seven. John Edward Haley.\nConvicted of mass interference of morale, City of Greater New Denver,\nas outlined under Congressional Act of April 12, 2250. Decision\nrendered equally on all three Final Master Machines.\"\n\n\"No appeal?\" asked Tony very softly.\n\n\"No appeal. And, Radek--\"\n\n\"Yes, sir?\"\n\n\"The condemned is married. Check with Supplies and Control for bill of\ndivorcement. His wife is a young woman, will have to marry again in the\nmorning as outlined under Congressional Act of May 28, 2211. Got that?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nThe Master Screen went dead. Tony blinked. Bill of divorcement. Will\nhave to marry again in the morning as outlined under Congressional Act.\nBy God, that's progress for you! He sat staring at the Master Screen\nfor a long time.\n\nThen he sighed, punched the button on Supplies and Control.\n\n\"Hell-hips!\" he growled. \"Snap it up. Execution at one-twenty-seven.\nBill of divorcement.\"\n\nThe narrow face peered sourly out at him from the Master Screen. It\ndidn't have much emotion in it now. It was almost blank, like the face\nof a humanoid robot somebody'd left something out of.\n\n\"Been hittin' the bottle again, huh?\" said Tony.\n\n\"My name is Clacker, _Mr._ Radek. Arthur Jared Clacker. Kindly keep\nthat in mind when you address me.\"\n\n\"Sure, sure. Nice name. Lovely name. Sounds like a stone-boat going\nover ground glass. Whip up that bill of divorcement.\"\n\n\"It's ready, _Mr._ Radek. _Been_ ready for the last half hour.\nI suggest that if there were a little of my own well known and\ndemonstrated efficiency in _your_ office, perhaps Executions would\nbe something to be proud of. Instead of what it is. Instead of the\nfoul-smelling, sloppily run, lice-infested....\"\n\nTony's hand reached out for the button on Supplies and Control. \"Watch\nthose lights,\" he said tiredly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe got up from the desk, stretched a little and went across the office\nto the cooler in the opposite wall. His feet made no noise; he had that\nquiet tread that all cats, a few men and some women achieve. His hand\ninterrupted the automatic cellgard and a tiny, almost hidden door in\nthe wall swung wide. He reached up, poked his hand in the cooler, felt\naround. A little smile came into his eyes. He took his hand out of the\ncooler, got up on tiptoes and looked inside. No roses. Not even one\nrose.\n\nNot even _half_ of a rose.\n\nChuckling, he went back to the desk and jabbed a finger at the button\nover Supplies and Control.\n\n\"Hell-hips!\" he rapped. \"Where's all that well known and demonstrated\nefficiency I've had to rake out of my ears?\"\n\nThe narrow face lit up the Master Screen once more. It looked bored\nnow. \"_Mr._ Radek, there was something?\"\n\n\"Yeah. Something.\" Tony's voice dropped, got deadly soft. \"How many\nweeks since you checked the cooler, boy? There aren't any ritual roses.\"\n\n\"There--there aren't any?\"\n\n\"That's right, Mr. Clacker. Now get away from that screen. I'm\nreporting this to Central Direction.\" His finger jammed down on the\nSupplies and Control button. He watched the Master Screen go blank and\ngrinned. He thought, \"Shake a little, Mr. Clacker, shake a little,\"\nbecause he didn't dare even whisper to himself.\n\nHe sat down at the desk again and thought of something. His finger went\nout, touched the button on the screen on the left--the _Portal Waiting_\nscreen.\n\nShe was still there, hunched up in one of the chairs like a small child\nsomebody had left in an interplanet waiting room and then gone away and\nforgotten. Tony frowned once more. Damn that dame, she was spoiling his\nnights.\n\nHe got up, crossed the office on silent feet, opened the door of\nExecutions, went down a bare, silent hall. At the levelators he waited\na moment for the platform, took it down, got off again at _Portal\nWaiting_, and crossed to the foyer.\n\nShe was there, just as she'd been on the screen upstairs, only clearer,\nmore vivid, something witnessed instead of second hand, something with\ndimension to it. She was in a big chair that could have accommodated\ntwo like her. She had her legs tucked under her and her brown eyes that\nlooked up at Tony's approach weren't any larger than two full moons.\n\nHe said, \"Are you Mrs. John Haley?\"\n\nThe girl nodded. \"They--they've got Johnny....\"\n\n\"I know.\" Tony dropped into a chair opposite the girl. \"It's late,\" he\nsaid softly. \"You shouldn't be here this time of night, Mrs. Haley.\"\n\nThe girl thought about that. \"You're Mr. Radek, aren't you? In the\nExecution Office?\"\n\n\"Call me Tony, Mrs. Haley.\"\n\n\"All right, Tony. Yes, it's late. I hadn't noticed, but I suppose\nyou're right.\"\n\n\"You should go home, Mrs. Haley.\" He stopped, then lied a little.\n\"They'll let you know. You don't have to worry.\"\n\n_You don't have to worry. They're bringing the guy up now, little\ngirl, but you don't have to worry. Old hell-hips is getting a ritual\nrose now, little girl, but you don't have to worry._\n\nAs if he'd deliberately telepathed the thought, the girl said suddenly:\n\"Tony, is--is it true about the furious roses? I mean, if a man is\nfound guilty, do they--?\"\n\n\"The 'furious' roses, Mrs. Haley?\" He smiled. \"I see. You mean because\nthey're so red. Yes, it's true. Ritual roses, we call them, but that's\nnothing. Nothing at all. A custom only. A symbol handed down. It means\nnothing.\"\n\n\"I know.\" The girl nodded again. \"When we were children, we always\ncalled them the furious roses because they were a furious red. We\nalways used to say that if an innocent man was executed, the furious\nred rose would right away turn white, Tony. To show they'd been wrong\nabout him.\"\n\nHe shrugged. \"Bedtime stories, Mrs. Haley.\"\n\n\"Not--not that it means anything to me, Tony. They'll find Johnny\ninnocent, of course. All three machines. The final machines.\"\n\n_Innocent? Oh, sure._\n\n\"A man,\" said Tony with a vague motion of his hands. \"What's the\ndifference what man a woman has? In the morning there's always\nanother--and another name. What's the difference?\" He smiled a small\ntoy smile with eyes half closed so the girl couldn't look too closely\ninto them.\n\nBut it was all right, she hadn't heard. At least she wasn't balling\nthose big eyes of hers at him. She was looking down into her folded\nhands.\n\nHe continued, \"There's a war on, Mrs. Haley. It seems there's always a\nwar on, somehow. And everybody--you, me, the guy down the street who\nskins ships for a living--we all have to remember that. And yet some\nof us don't. Some of us go off on a tangent and try to sell out our\ncountry and then there's hell to pay. And if we're found guilty, we get\nthe execution. The Neg-Emote.\"\n\nThe girl's lips began to tremble. She looked up. \"Does it hurt, Tony? I\nmean....\"\n\n\"Physically? No, of course not.\" A corner of his mouth curled. \"We're\nhumane nowadays, hadn't you heard? We just strap a man in a chair and\npress a button and down comes a metal hood over him. We press some more\nbuttons and pull a switch or two, and that's that. No feeling, nothing.\nThe man's as good as new except he has no emotions any more. No\nemotions whatever except personal physical pain, such as he'd need in\ncase somebody stepped on his toe or jabbed him with a pin. The State\nwants us to protect ourselves, you see. It wouldn't want us getting\nhurt because we don't feel anything.\"\n\nHe stopped because it was getting harder to continue. \"We used to call\nit 'stripping,' but that was long ago before the humane boys decided\nthe term was a little cruel. Now it's just Neg-Emoting. But the same\nthing. Just a fancy title.\"\n\nHer big eyes were suddenly eating into his. \"What do they do with them,\nTony?\"\n\nHe shrugged again. \"Send 'em off to Training. Some can be taught this,\nsome that, but a living death nevertheless. What else can a traitor\nexpect?\"\n\nThe girl began to tremble all over. \"Not Johnny! They can't do that to\nJohnny! He's innocent, Tony--he didn't do anything! Tony, tell them\nthat! Tell them to let him go....\"\n\nHe put his teeth together hard. What do you say to a woman who sits\nacross from you, waiting the long, long wait? What do you say to a\nwoman like this when you see the terror--and something else--in eyes\nlike hers?\n\n\"You like the guy, Mrs. Haley?\" he asked gently. \"That's old-fashioned\nas hell, you know. We all learn that way back in primaries.\"\n\nBut the woman wasn't listening again, wasn't caring what he'd said.\nShe began to whisper very softly:\n\n\"In the nights I used to be frightened. I used to lie there asleep\nand dream of the ships coming down and spraying the house with the\nburn-waves. And I could hear the roaring thunder of the jets and\nthe house would start to shake and I'd try to yell, but I couldn't.\nSomething inside would be choking me. And just when the burn-waves\nwould be coming hot through the window and licking at the walls inside\nthe room, I'd scream myself awake and jump up in bed and the sweat\nwould be pouring off me.\"\n\nTony stared, incredulous, into the big balls of fright that her eyes\nhad become.\n\n\"And then the lights would come on again, and there would be Johnny\nlying next to me smiling a little, and his curly hair would be all\ntousled from sleep, and he'd say to me, 'Baby, you've been dreaming\nagain. Don't you know I'm here? Don't you know I'll always be here?\nDon't you know that, Baby?' And then it would be all right, and the\nroaring jets would be only the dawn shift going out on Security Patrol.\nAnd then I could go back to sleep again.\"\n\nShe stopped. _Portal Waiting_ had become a gray ghost of a thing with\nnothing living in it, only the clouds of memory like smoke veils\nswirling, drifting here and there, soon gone.\n\nAnd then: \"They'll let him go, Tony. He's innocent, you know. They have\nto let him go.\"\n\nHe didn't look at her. He got up from his chair, put his hands rigidly\nat his sides. Then he did look, just once, and very hard.\n\n\"Get out of here!\" he growled.\n\n\"No, Tony.\"\n\nHe took a deep breath, turned, went across the foyer to the levelators.\nAs he passed under the huge Master Screen, her voice came again, but\nquite thin:\n\n\"You'll let me know, Tony? You'll let me know as soon as you get word?\"\n\nHe didn't answer, didn't look back, didn't do anything except\nkeep going to the levelators. He went upstairs, found the door of\nExecutions, opened it, went through, let it slam shut.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThings started to happen. The Master Clock over on the black desk made\na quiet blipping sound and the Emote Neutral lights went out. At once\nthe office was flooded with Amber Official, the working lights. Then\nthe Master Screen glowed and a narrow-faced man with washed-away eyes\nlooked out at him.\n\n\"Condemned is waiting, _Mr._ Radek,\" the narrow-faced man said acidly.\n\"Cell Two is getting dusty waiting for you, _Mr._ Radek. Very dusty.\"\n\nTony looked up. His heart wasn't in it, but he said it anyhow: \"Go\nchase your blonde some more, hell-hips.\"\n\nHe went over to the desk, banged the Supplies and Control button, held\nit down. Master Screen darkened. He looked at the small square of white\npaper on the black desk top.\n\nA bill of divorcement. Like that. So in the morning the kid downstairs\ncould go out and get herself another mate and then she could go back to\nbed again and dream some more about the roaring jets and the burn-waves.\n\nHe reached up and wiped at his forehead. She didn't have to see it\nhappen. Nothing in the Constitution--old or new--stated she had to see\nit happen. He looked down at the matswitch that controlled the visi-lok\non the Master Screen. He clamped his teeth together and his hand went\nout and flipped the switch. The office went dead.\n\nMaybe nobody'd notice. Maybe he'd have time to slip into Cell Two and\nget it over with before anybody noticed. He started across the room on\nfast, silent feet.\n\n\"_Radek!_\" the alternate speaker over in the corner blasted out. He\nfroze solid. \"Radek, don't move! Stand where you are!\"\n\nDon't move? He couldn't have moved if he'd had jets on. And then the\nhard voice went on again: \"Central Command to Supplies and Control. Use\nEmergency visi-relay. Unlock the Master Screen! This is Command 419,\nRegulation Four. Signed, Countersigned.\"\n\nAlmost at once the Master Screen flickered into life and a hard,\nsevere-looking face appeared there. \"Radek, turn around! Face the\nscreen!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\" Tony turned.\n\n\"Second violation, Radek. Why?\"\n\nTony forced a blank face. He lifted his shoulders, said: \"I was over\nhere on my way to Cell Two for the Execution. How could I--\"\n\n\"That will be all, Radek! Clear your desk. Prepare for judgment on\nfinal machines.\"\n\nTony swallowed. He didn't move because he couldn't move.\n\n\"Well, Radek?\"\n\nHe fought his face clean, kept his hands rigid at his sides. Sweat was\nrolling down his back, but that was all right; Central Command couldn't\nbe expected to see sweat roll down a man's back under his clothing,\nthough a lot of people thought so.\n\n\"A suggestion, sir,\" he said at last.\n\n\"What?\" Hard eyes bored into his own.\n\nHe let a little anxious look creep over his face. Not a guilty\nlook--he hoped--but the kind of anxious look a worried but innocent man\nmight have in a spot like this.\n\nHe said quickly: \"About that visi-lok. I suggest it might have gone\ninto lock by itself. You see, it's one of the old-fashioned kind, the\ntype they used to have that worked with solenoids. We've had trouble\nwith them before.\"\n\nThat brought a little silence. The hard eyes in the screen said at\nlast: \"Central Command to Supplies and Control. Is the visi-lok in\nExecutions controlled by a solenoid? Was it never changed to relay?\"\n\nTony gulped. He looked into the Master Screen, but he remained frozen\nto the floor, hardly breathing. And then a very thin voice answered\nnervously:\n\n\"I--I believe that's correct, sir. I believe Executions does have the\nold-fashioned solenoid. It seems there hasn't been time to change it.\nI've been intending to....\"\n\nThe voice was cut off. The hard eyes came back to Tony. \"Decision!\" the\nhard voice said.\n\n\"Yes, sir?\"\n\n\"Exonerated, Radek! Carry on with Execution in Cell Two.\" The screen\nwent blank.\n\nTony shuddered. A close one. A damned close one. That was the war for\nyou. Even a man's breaths are counted. He went on shaky feet over to\nthe cooler, reached in, got out a ritual rose, left the office end\nshuffled down the hall to Cell Two.\n\nJohn Edward Haley. The condemned. A thin man, Tony thought. Well, sure,\nthere aren't many fat men any more. Not in ordinary circumstances, that\nis.\n\nThe man was sitting tensely in the chair. There was no one else in the\ncell, which was as it should be, of course. Witnesses, yes--the Master\nScreen up on the wall--but not here, not visible.\n\nTony went across the Cell. \"John Edward Haley,\" he said.\n\nThe man moved a nervous tongue over dry lips.\n\n\"John Edward Haley, you have been sentenced for Execution. Now hear\nthese final words of the State as directed by Presidential order from\nResponsibility Official in the City of Greater New Denver, this night.\"\n\nHe took two small steps toward the man in the chair. He held out the\nred rose, put it in the hand of the other. Then he stepped back two\nsteps until his toes were just touching a small plaque built into the\nfloor. He looked down, read from the plaque:\n\n\"The giving of this rose. A symbol for the red of the blood of your\nbrothers that you have let by treason and/or treachery. A symbol that\nas the rose is red, so are the unclean acts of your own hand, of your\nown mind. The State has so spoken.\"\n\nHe looked up. A nice way to kiss a guy off. Might as well tell him he\nbit his brother's finger, too, when he was a kid.\n\n\"Have you anything to say?\" he asked.\n\nThe man's nervous tongue worked again. He said quickly:\n\n\"Yeah. Look, guy, just one thing. Just one favor. I don't give a damn\nwhat happens to me. Sure, I'm guilty. So you caught me, and so I take\nit. So what? A guy expects that. But the wife....\"\n\nTony's teeth came together hard.\n\n\"... But the wife, see? She's down in _Portal Waiting_. Been there for\nthree nights now. I don't want her to witness this. I don't want her\nto look into that Master Screen down there and see it. That's all I'm\nasking, guy, and it ain't much. Just a flick of a switch is all I'm\nasking. It ain't much. It ain't, is it?\"\n\n_It ain't, hey? By God!_\n\n\"When the hood comes down, she'll see it. She's bound to,\" the thin\nman went on fast. \"She'll see the flash in the Screen and she'll know\nit's me, and she's never done anything to deserve that. That's all I'm\nasking, guy. That's all I'm asking.\"\n\nThe silence in the cell was a thick thing. Tony could feel the sweat\nrolling down his back again. But a different kind of a sweat now--not\na sweat for himself, a sweat for somebody else. Just one finger touch\non that visi-lok matswitch would do it. Just one finger, and the small\nwoman downstairs in _Portal Waiting_ wouldn't know, would have one more\ninstant of waiting, of hoping against hope. Of suspense. Of breathing\nin the air we all breathe in, of being alive, sentient; and knowing\nthat her man, the thin fellow with the tousled, curly hair, was still\nsentient, too.\n\n\"Well, guy?\"\n\nTony wet his lips. \"Sorry, Haley. Petition refused.\" The hood came\ndown. The Master Screen up on the wall blazed into life.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTony sat at his black desk with his hands folded, fingers laced. That's\nExecutions for you. And this is war. There's a war on. Don't forget\nthat. He looked down at his hands, sighed. Then he reached out and\ntouched the Supplies and Control button.\n\n\"Hell-hips!\" he growled.\n\nHe looked at the screen. It wasn't hell-hips. It was a blonde. Not\na young blonde, a scarecrow blonde. An old wretched piece of living\nmechanism like himself.\n\n\"Where's Clacker?\" he asked.\n\n\"Mr. Clacker is no longer with us, Mr. Radek.\"\n\n\"Huh? What happened to him?\"\n\n\"Mr. Clacker has been taken to the three Final Machines for trial and\njudgment. I am now taking over here. My name is Hortense. G. Welker\nHortense.\"\n\nTony looked at the blonde. Crude, undisguised lights were coming from\nthe woman's eyes. Promotion-happy.\n\nHe said at last: \"Sorry as hell about that. The solenoid thing, I\nsuppose. I didn't mean to get the guy in trouble. I sure didn't mean\nthat.\"\n\n\"He'd been ordered to change it. It was no one's fault but his own. You\nwere only doing your duty, I'm sure. And duty comes above everything.\"\n\n\"Yeah. Yeah, sure. I know.\" He sighed once more. \"Get me an airbrush\nand a bottle of white paint.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I want an airbrush and a bottle of white paint. I want to paint my\nnice little ritual roses. I don't like red any more. I want all white\nones.\"\n\n\"Mr. Radek...?\"\n\nTony glared. \"Do I get that paint or don't I? Don't just stand there!\"\nHis fist banged down on Supplies and Control button. The Master Screen\nwent blank, and then flashed into motion again fast. The blonde again.\nNasty now. A chip off the old block. Another hell-hips, but this time\nwith skirts.\n\n\"Request not granted! This is entirely against regulations, Mr. Radek!\nSpecifically, against ordinance 1991, of the Code of....\"\n\n\"Oh, can it,\" he growled wearily. \"For God's sake, don't give me any\nmore of that.\"\n\nThe blonde stiffened. \"Well! After all, I'm only doing my duty, Mr.\nRadek. As head of Supplies and Control, I have certain well-defined and\ninflexible....\"\n\nTony blacked her out. He held her blacked out till he was sure she\nwouldn't come on again. Duty.\n\nThe Master Clock made a quiet blipping noise. Amber Official lights\ndimmed and Emote Neutral came on. Long, probing shadow fingers snaked\nhere and there across the floor, and a stillness that should have been\nrestful descended eventually on the place.\n\n\"_Radek!_\"\n\nThe hard eyes. The hard voice. Tony looked into the screen. \"Yes, sir?\"\n\n\"Radek, that woman is still downstairs in _Portal Waiting_! We can't\nhave her hanging around all night. Why hasn't she been given her bill\nof divorcement and sent home? My God, man, where's your feelings? She's\nat least entitled to that.\"\n\n\"Right away, sir.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
