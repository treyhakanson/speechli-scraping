But I fear you will find no\nminds to study in the fourth dimension. There aren't any there!\"\n\nProfessor Gault paused, peered from beneath bushy white brows out\nover the laboratory. To his near sighted eyes the blurred figure\nof Harper, his young assistant, seemed busily at work over his\nmathematical charts. Gault hoped sourly that the young man was\nactually working and not just drawing more of his absurd,\nsenseless designs amidst the mathematical computations....\n\n\"Your proof,\" Dr. Pillbot broke into his thoughts insistently,\n\"is purely negative, Professor! How can you know there are no\nbeings in the fourth dimension, unless you actually enter this\nrealm, to see for yourself?\"\n\nProfessor Gault stared at the fat, puffy face of his visitor, and\nsnorted loudly.\n\n\"I am afraid, Pillbot, you do not comprehend the impossibility of\nsuch a passage. We can not possibly break from the confines of\nour three dimensional world. Here, let me explain by a simple\nillustration.\"\n\nGault took up a book, held it so that a shadow fell onto the\nsurface of the desk.\n\n\"That shadow,\" he said, \"is two dimensional, has length and\nbreadth, but no thickness. Now in order to enter the third\ndimension, our plane, the shadow would have to bulge out in some\nway, into the dimension of thickness an obvious impossibility.\nSimilarly, we can not enter the fourth dimension. Do you see?\"\n\n\"No!\" retorted Pillbot with some heat. \"In the first place, we\nare not two dimensional shadows, and--why, what is the matter?\"\n\nProfessor Gault's lanky form had stiffened, his near sighted eyes\nglaring out over the laboratory to the rear of Pillbot. The\npsychiatrist wheeled around, followed his host's gaze.\n\nIt was Harper. That young man's antics drew an amazed grunt from\nPillbot. He was describing peculiar motions in the air with his\npencil. Circles, whorls, angles, abrupt jabs forward. He bent\nover the paper on the desk, made a few sweeps of the pencil, then\nthe pencil rose again into the air to describe more erratic\nmotions. Harper himself seemed in a trance.\n\nSuddenly Pillbot gave a stifled gasp. It seemed to him that\nHarper's arm vanished at the elbow as it stabbed forward, then\nreappeared. Once again the phenomenon happened.\n\nPillbot blinked rapidly, rubbed his eyes. It must have been\nillusion, he decided. It was too ... unlikely....\n\n\"Harper!\" Gault's voice was like the snapping of a steel trap.\n\nStartled, Harper came to with a jerk. Seeing he was being\nwatched, he flushed redly, then bent over his charts again. An\napologetic murmur floated from his desk.\n\n\"What was he doing?\" Pillbot asked puzzledly.\n\n\"Doodling!\" Gault spat out the word disgustedly.\n\n\"Doodling?\" echoed the psychiatrist. \"Why that is a slang term we\nuse in psychiatry, to describe the absent-minded scrawls and\ndesigns people make while their attention is elsewhere occupied.\nAn overflow of the unconscious mind, we call it. Many famous\npeople are 'doodlers.' Their doodles often are a sign of special\nability--\"\n\n\"Exactly!\" snapped Gault. \"It shows a special ability to waste\ntime. And Harper has become worse since I hired him to do some of\nmy mathematical work. Some influence in this laboratory--I blush\nto confess--seems to bring it on. 'Four dimensional doodling' we\ncall it, because, as you saw, he doesn't confine it to the\nsurface of the paper!\"\n\nPillbot looked startled. \"By jove,\" he cried. \"I believe you've\nhit on something new to psychiatry. This young man may have some\nunknown faculty of mind--an instinctive perception of the fourth\ndimension. Just as some people have an unerring sense of\ndirection, so perhaps Harper has a sense of--of a fourth\ndirection--the fourth dimension! I should like to examine some of\nhis 'doodles'.\"\n\nHarper looked up in alarm as his crusty tempered employer\nappeared, followed by the stout figure of Pillbot. He rose and\nstood aside unassumingly, as Pillbot bent over the scrawls on his\ncharts, clucking interestedly.\n\nHarper flickered a worried glance over to the corner. He hoped\nthey wouldn't notice his stress-analyzing clay model standing\nthere. It looked like a futurist's nightmare, with angles, curves\nand knobs stuck out at all angles. Professor Gault might not\nunderstand....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor one of his retiring temperament, Harper was aiming high.\nThere was a standing award of $50,000 for the lucky mathematician\nwho would solve the mystery of the \"stress-barrier\" encountered\nby skyscrapers as they were built up toward the 150 story mark.\nAt this height, they encountered stress and strains which\nmathematical computations and engineering designs had been unable\nto solve. Harper believed the \"stress-barrier\" was due to an\nundetected space-bending close to the earth's surface, a bending\nof space greater than ever provided for in the prediction of\nEinstein. And if he was right, and could win that award, then\nthere might be wedding bells, and a little bungalow with\nJudith....\n\nHarper's greatest fear was that he would do something to annoy\nGault into firing him, thus depriving him of the privilege of\nusing the mathematical charts and computing machines available in\nthe laboratory. Right now, he hoped Gault wouldn't notice that\nstatue in the corner--\n\n\"What's _that_!\"\n\nHarper's heart leaped. The Professor was glaring at the statue,\nas though it were something the cat brought in.\n\nPillbot looked up from examination of the \"doodles\" and followed\nGault over to the futuristic statuary.\n\nAs Gault made strangled noises, Pillbot stared interestedly.\n\"Why--its like some of the designs in his doodling,\" he\nexclaimed.\n\n\"And made with some of my best modeling clay for reproducing\ngeometric solids!\" rasped Gault. He wheeled upon Harper.\n\n\"Get that thing out of here! I won't stand for such rot in this\nlaboratory. Throw it into the hall for the janitor!\"\n\n\"Ye-yessir,\" said Harper, gulping. He took hold of the statue,\npulled at it.\n\n\"It--it won't budge,\" he exclaimed amazedly.\n\n\"Eh? Won't move? It's not heavy, is it?\" demanded the Professor.\n\n\"No--about thirty pounds, but it wont move!\"\n\nGault took hold of one of the angles of the thing, jerked at it\nsavagely. He gave it up with an oath, returned to Harper's desk\nmuttering.\n\nHarper suddenly noticed the top portion of the statue. It didn't\nseem to be all there! He was positive there had been another\nsection on top, shooting off at an angle, representing a problem\nin tangential stress. What had happened to that top section?\n\nHe would figure that out later, when the occasion was more\npropitious. Right now, he realized that only the presence of\nDr. Pillbot prevented Gault from firing him. He cast an apprehensive\nglance toward his employer.\n\nWith trepidation, he saw Gault reach for something projecting\nfrom behind a bench. Gault pulled it out, held it dangling before\nhim. A strangled exclamation of wrath came from him. His long\nnose pointed accusingly toward Harper, like a finger pointing out\na criminal.\n\n\"I was afraid of that!\" he grated. \"Cutting paper dolls!\" Gault\nwas holding up a large paper cutout of a human figure--a long,\nrangy man.\n\n\"This is the last straw,\" Gault went on, his voice rising. \"I\nhave stood enough--\"\n\n\"It--it wasn't me, sir,\" Harper cried quickly, with visions of\nhis job and $50,000 vanishing. \"It was your ten year old nephew,\nRudolph, when he was here yesterday. He cut it out, said it\nlooked like--like his uncle--\"\n\nHarper stopped as Gault seemed about to explode. Then the\nmathematician subsided, a malicious expression crept over his\nface.\n\n\"H-m-m,\" he said. \"Might be just what I need to explain things to\nDr. Pillbot.\"\n\n\"I shall take this matter before the Psychiatric Society,\"\nPillbot was saying excitedly. \"Undoubtedly you have some strange\nfaculty--an instinctive perception of four dimensional laws ...\nwhat was that, Professor?\"\n\n\"I said if you will step over to this desk I will explain to you\nin elementary terms--very elementary and easy to understand--why\nyou will never be able to study four dimensional beings--_if_ any\nexist!\" Gault's voice was tinged with sarcasm.\n\nPillbot came over, followed by Harper, who was interested in any\nexplanations about the fourth dimension--even elementary ones....\n\nGault, with a glint in his eye, pressed the paper figure flatly\non the surface of Harper's desk.\n\n\"This paper man, we will say, represents a two dimensional\ncreature. We lay him flatly against the desk, which represents\nhis world--Flatland, we mathematicians call it. Mr. Flatlander\ncan't see into our world. He can see only along the flat plane of\nhis own world. To see us, for instance, he would have to look\n_up_, which is the third dimension, a direction inconceivable to\nhim. Now, Doctor, are you beginning to understand why we can\nnever see four dimensional beings?\"\n\nPillbot frowned thoughtfully, then looked up. \"And what about the\nviewpoint of the four dimensioners themselves--_what would\nprevent them from seeing us_?\"\n\nHarper hardly heard the Professor's snort of disgust. This two\ndimensional cutout in \"Flatland\" fascinated him. An idea occurred\nto him. Now, just supposing the....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs Gault and Pillbot argued, Harper grasped the paper cutout, and\nbent it, \"jacknifed\" it, creasing it firmly in the middle. Then\nhe raised the upper half so that it rose vertically from the\ndesk, while the lower half was still pressed flatly against the\ndesk surface.\n\n\"Now,\" he murmured to himself, \"the Flatlander would appear to\nhis fellows to have vanished from the waist up, because from the\nwaist up he is bent into the third dimension ... so far as they\nare concerned....\"\n\n\"E-e-e-e-e!\"\n\nAt the wavering scream, Harper looked up quickly. Pillbot was\nstaring frozenly in front of him, toward the floor. Harper\nfollowed his glance--and saw it.\n\nProfessor Gault had vanished from the waist up.\n\nHis lower body still stood before Pillbot, swaying slightly, but\nthe upper body was unconditionally missing. From the large feet\nplanted solidly on the floor, long legs rose majestically,\nterminating in slim, angular hips--and from thence vanished\nabruptly into nothingness. It was as though the upper body had\nbeen sheared away, neatly and precisely, at the waist.\n\nPillbot stared from the visible portion of Gault to slack-jawed\nHarper and back again, sweat splashing from his puffy face.\n\n\"Why, why really my dear fellow,\" he quavered, addressing the\nhalf-figure. \"This--this is a bit rude of you, vanishing in the\nmidst of my sentence. I--I trust you will--ah, return at once!\"\nThen, as the full import of the phenomenon penetrated to his\nunderstanding, his eyes became glazed and he backed away.\n\nThe portion of Professor Gault addressed failed to give any\nindication it had heard the remonstrance. Slowly, the legs began\nto feel their way, like a blind man, about the floor.\n\nHarper stared wildly, white showing around his pale blue irises.\n\n\"No!\" he bleated. \"The Professor didn't do it himself--I caused\nit to happen. I bent the paper cutout, and--and Something saw me\ndo it, and imitated me by bending the Professor into the fourth\ndimension!\" Harper moaned faintly, wringing his hands.\n\nPillbot at the moment got little satisfaction from this\ndemonstration of his point about four dimensional life. He\nglanced fearfully at the half-figure.\n\n\"You--you mean to say,\" he quailed, \"that we are under scrutiny\nby some Being of the fourth dimension?\"\n\n\"That's it,\" replied Harper with a whinny. \"I--I know it, I can\nfeel it. It became aware of our three dimensional life in some\nway, and its attention is now concentrated on the laboratory!\" He\nwrung his hands. \"I just know something else terrible is going to\nhappen!\" He backed away quickly as the occupied pair of pants\nmoved toward him.\n\nHis retreat was halted by his desk, upon which reposed two large\nCalifornia oranges, an inevitable accompaniment to Harper's\nlunch. To him, orange juice was a potent, revivifying drink. Now\nhe automatically reached for one of the oranges, as a more hardy\nindividual might reach for a whisky and soda in a moment of\nmental shock.\n\nHis eyes wide on the shuffling approach of Gault's underpinnings,\nHarper nervously dug sharp fingernails into the orange, tore off\nlarge chunks of skin.\n\nA sudden blur seen from the corner of his eyes pulled his gaze\nback to the desk. The other orange had vanished.\n\n_Phwup_!\n\nIt dropped to the floor before Harper, but now it was a squashy\nmess, the insides standing out like petals, the juice running\nfrom it.\n\nThe other orange slipped from Harper's nerveless fingers, rolled\nalong the desk top. Harper pounced on the squashy thing on the\nfloor, feverishly pushed back the projecting insides, closely\nexamined it. He looked up wide-eyed at Pillbot.\n\n\"Turned inside out,\" he gasped hoarsely, \"without breaking its\nskin!\"\n\nPillbot's expression indicated that the scientific attitude was\nslowly replacing his former fright. He snapped his fingers.\n\n\"Imitation again!\" he said, half to himself. He looked at Harper.\n\"When you bent the paper figure this--this fourth dimensional\nentity imitated your action by bending the Professor. Now, as you\nstarted to peel the orange, your action was again imitated--in a\nfour dimensional manner--by this entity turning the other orange\ninside out.\"\n\nHis voice dropped, as he muttered, \"Imitativeness--the mark of a\nmind of low evolutionary order, or of ...\" his words faded off,\nhis expression thoughtful.\n\nMore white showed around Harper's eyes. \"You--you mean I am being\nspecially watched by this Being--that He--It--imitates everything\nI do...?\"\n\n\"That's it,\" clipped Pillbot. \"Because you possess this strange\nperception of Its realm the Being has been especially attracted\nto you, imitates whatever you do, but in a four dimensional\nmanner. A Being of inexplicable powers and prerogatives, with\nweird power over matter, but with a mentality that is either very\nprimitive, or--\"\n\nHarper leaped into the air with a yell, as Professor Gault's\nabbreviated body sidled up to him from behind. As he leaped, the\ninside out orange flew out of his grasp.\n\n\"I just know,\" he quavered, \"that Professor Gault wants me to do\nsomething, is probably barking orders at me from that other\ndimension--oh dear, I've dropped the orange on the Professor's--where\nhis stomach should be!\"\n\nThe squashy orange had landed on the area of Gault that was the line\nof demarkation between his visible and invisible portions--the area\nthat his stomach would occupy normally. It rested there in plain\nsight of the two startled men.\n\n\"I--I'd better remove it,\" said Harper weakly. He moved with a\ndreadful compulsion toward the swaying half-figure, one slender\nhand extended tremblingly toward the inverted orange.\n\nAbruptly, the orange vanished. Harper halted like he'd run into a\nbrick wall. Staring blankly ahead, he put his hands to his\nstomach, moaning faintly.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" cried Pillbot.\n\n\"The orange--it's in my--stomach!\"\n\n\"See, what did I tell you,\" exulted Pillbot. \"Another act of\nimitativeness. It saw you drop the orange on Gault's--where his\nstomach should be, and imitated by putting the orange in your\nstomach. It proves I'm right about the Being--glug!\" With a loud\nbelch, Pillbot broke off. He stared blankly at Harper, then his\nhands slowly came up to clutch at his stomach.\n\nHarper looked quickly at the desk top.\n\n\"The other orange,\" he gasped. \"It's gone!\"\n\n\"Into--my--stomach!\" groaned Pillbot. \"Be--be careful what you\ndo! My God, don't do anything. Don't even think. This--this four\ndimensional creature will surely imitate whatever you do in some\nweird manner.\"\n\nRubbing his stomach, Pillbot glanced about at the various\narticles of furniture. He blanched. \"I wouldn't want any of that\nstuff inside of me,\" he yammered.\n\nHarper flicked a despairing glance at the half-body, now gliding\nalong in the vicinity of the paper cutout.\n\n\"We--we must do something to get the Professor back,\" he said\nworriedly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe thought incongruously of a restaurant where he used to order\nlemon pie--and invariably get apple. Finally he found that he\ncould get lemon by ordering peach. Now the problem was, what did\nhe have to \"order\" to get his employer extricated from being\nstuck between dimensions, like a pig under a fence? Anything he\ndid would be imitated in a manner that might prove tragic.\n\nThe upright portion of the cutout was leaning over backward, the\nhead drooping down like a wilted flower, as the tension at the\ncrease slowly lessened.\n\nGathering together what resolution he could, Harper determined to\ntake the bull by the horns. He would get the Professor returned\nby pressing the upper portion of the cutout flatly onto the desk\nsurface. With trembling hands, he pressed down on it--then sprang\nback with a muffled yell.\n\nThree feet above the half-body, the Professor's head had flashed\ninto visibility.\n\n\"You only pressed the head onto the desk,\" said Pillbot\ndisgustedly, \"so the Being only impressed Galt's head back into\nthe laboratory. Now press down the rest of the body.\"\n\nThe Professor's head, suspended above the body, glared about,\naffixed Harper with a smouldering glance. The mouth moved\nrapidly, but no words came.\n\n\"Professor, I can't hear you,\" whimpered Harper. \"Your lungs and\nvocal cords are in the other dimension. Here, I'll have you\ncompletely returned.\" He reached a hand toward the cutout, the\ntorso of which still bulged upward from the desk.\n\nGault's head wagged in vigorous negation of Harper's contemplated\nact. His mouth moved in what, if audible, would have been\nclipped, burning accents.\n\nHarper drew back his hand as if he had touched a red hot poker.\n\"The Professor doesn't want me to touch the cutout,\" he said\nhelplessly.\n\nGault's head hovered over the cutout like a gaunt moon. It\nswooped down toward the paper figure, seemed to be studying its\nposition on the desk closely. Pillbot watched him for a sign of\nhis intentions or wishes.\n\nHarper wandered distractedly over toward the high wall bench. He\nhad it! He would distract the attention of the Entity from Gault\nby making another cutout. He would then experiment with that\nsecond one, without endangering Gault. He'd be careful not to\nmake this one thin and tall, so as not to resemble the Professor\nin outline. Perhaps with it, he could trick the Entity into\nreleasing the missing part of Gault's body....\n\nHe scraped in the bench drawer for the scissors, and started to\nsheer through a large stiff piece of paper.\n\nA moment later he looked up as Pillbot walked over.\n\n\"Gault has some reason for not wanting his silhouette touched,\"\nhe said. \"Can't quite make out his lip movements, but he seems\nafraid some permanent mark may be left on him by his return. He\nwants time to figure out--why, what are you doing?\"\n\n\"I've made another cutout for experiment,\" explained Harper. \"And\nthis one doesn't look like the Professor, isn't tall and thin.\nSee--?\" He lifted the second cutout from the flat surface of the\nbench, held it suspended before him.\n\n\"This one is short and fat--\" Harper halted abruptly, the breath\nwhooshing from his lungs.\n\nThere was no use talking to thin air. Pillbot had been whisked\ninto nothingness. Where the portly figure of the eminent\npsychiatrist had stood was now nothing, not even a half man.\n\nToo late, Harper realized that when he had lifted the paper\nfigure from the surface of the bench, the Entity had imitated him\nby \"lifting\" Pillbot into the fourth dimension. Belatedly, he\nknew that the cutout which he held dangling, resembled Pillbot in\noutline.\n\nHarper dashed back and forth in little rushes, carrying the paper\nfigure. He dared not put it down, for fear of seeing some segment\nof Pillbot flash back. He did not know what to do with it.\n\nFinally he compromised by suspending it to a low hanging\nchandelier, where it dangled swaying in the slight air currents.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGault was watching his assistant's antics with a bleak expression\nthat changed to sardonic satisfaction as he realized Pillbot was\nin a predicament like his--only more so. Abruptly he frowned,\nstaring ahead, and Harper guessed that Pillbot had located\nGault's torso in the other realm, was nudging him to indicate the\nfact.\n\nSuddenly Harper knew that he himself must enter this fourth\ndimensional realm. That strange instinct told him the solution to\neverything was there--somewhat as a woman's intuition impels her\nto act in a certain way, without knowing why.\n\nHow to get there? Another paper cutout? He glanced toward the\nProfessor--the occupied trousers, and swimming above it, the\nman's head. The head was watching him, the expression savage.\n\nNo, there must be no more cutouts, Harper decided. While the four\ndimensional entity distinguished between the outlines of a thin\nsilhouette and a fat one, something in between, like Harper's\nform, would be testing It too far.\n\nHe, Harper would take the place of his own cutout!\n\nGault's head reared up, glared fixedly at his assistant as the\nyoung man swung his legs onto the desk, then lay down flat. A\nmoment he lay there, in \"Flatland\"--then leaped to his feet.\n\nIt was as though he had leaped into a different world. He was no\nlonger in the laboratory. He wasn't on any, floor at all, as far\nas he could make out. His feet rested on nothing--and yet there\nwas some sort of tension under him--like the surface tension of\nwater.\n\nHe was--he suddenly knew it--standing on a segment of warped\nspace! There was a spacial strain here that acted as a solid\nbeneath him!\n\nHarper looked \"up\"--that is, overhead. There was nothing there\nbut vast stretches of emptiness--at first. Then he saw that this\nemptiness was lined and laced with filmy striations, like\ncellophane. They bore a strange resemblance to his \"doodlings,\"\nas though that strange faculty of his enabled him to somehow\nperceive this place of the fourth dimension. And instinctively\nHarper knew that these lacings were the boundaries of a vast\nenclosure--a four dimensional enclosure, the \"walls\" of which\nconsisted of joined and meshed space-warps.\n\nAbruptly he became aware of movement. He became aware of solidity\nthere above him. And the solidity was in motion.\n\nHarper knew he was gazing upon a being of the fourth\ndimension--doubtless the Entity that had caused the phenomena in\nthe laboratory, which had snatched him into the fourth dimension,\nand was even now observing him with its four dimensional sight!\nThere was a shape above him that strained his eyes, gave hint of\nForm just beyond his comprehension.\n\nHarper hardly noticed that Pillbot was beside him, shaking him.\nHe had suddenly grasped a fundamental law of spacial stresses,\nand he whipped out a pad and pencil, began scribbling down the\nmathematical formula of these laws. He began to see now why\nskyscrapers encountered the \"stress-barrier\" at a certain height.\nHe understood it just as a person of innate musical ability,\nhearing music for the first time, would understand the laws of\nthat music.\n\n\"Look out, It's moving, descending!\" Pillbot was yelling into his\near. \"It is about to act. Became active the moment you got here.\nHow did you induce it to bring you here?\"\n\n\"Huh?\" Harper looked up from his scribbling. \"Oh.\" Harper\nexplained quickly how he had induced the Being to act on himself.\n\n\"That's it!\" cried Pillbot hoarsely. \"You switched the pattern of\nimitation on It--tricked It into bringing you here. That's what\nmade it angry--\"\n\n\"Angry?\" Harper almost dropped his pad, clutched at Pillbot as\nthere was a sudden upheaval of the invisible tension-surface on\nwhich they stood. A violent shake sprawled them on the \"ground\"\nand now Harper saw the torso of Gault, a few feet away,\napparently hovering above the surface.\n\n\"Yes, angry!\" Pillbot was pale. \"As long as you merely gave it\nsomething to imitate it was pacified. But now it recognizes\nopposition, an effort to outwit it due to your switching the\npattern of imitation. Its condition is dangerous--it's bound to\nreact violently. We have to get out of here. You must know some\nway--\"\n\nHarper again scribbled some figures on his pad. \"As soon as I've\nworked out this formula--\"\n\nPillbot shook him frantically. \"Can't you understand! This\nCreature is a mental patient of a violent type. We are in a\n_fourth dimensional insane asylum_!\" Pillbot gazed upward\nfearfully at a descending mass. \"The pattern of its action fits\nperfectly,\" he went on. \"Some violent type of insanity, combined\nwith delusions of grandeur. Any slightest opposition will cause a\nspasm of fury. It recognizes such opposition in the way you\ntricked it into bringing you here. At first I thought it was a\nprimitive mentality, but now I know it is a highly evolved, but\ninsane creature, thinks it's Napoleon, wants to conquer the three\ndimensional plane which its attention has been attracted to in\nsome way--\"\n\nHarper looked up in surprise. \"Does it know about Napoleon?\"\n\n\"Of course not, you fool!\" screamed Pillbot. \"It has the\nNapoleonic complex, identifies itself with some great conqueror\nof its own realm. And now it's on the rampage. We have to get\nout of here--\" He clutched at Harper as another upheaval of the\nsurface threw them down.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRising, Harper put away his pad. His calculations were complete.\nHe could now show engineers how to build high buildings, taking\nadvantage of space stress instead of trying to fight the stress.\n\nFor the first time, the danger of their position seemed to\npenetrate to his consciousness. He looked about--and his eyes\nrested on a strange familiar projection rising from the invisible\nfloor a few feet away. It was the section of his clay statue that\nhad vanished--vanished because its peculiar shape had somehow\ncaused it to be warped into the fourth dimension!\n\nWhy hadn't he been able to move it--Professor Gault moved about\nfreely.\n\nHe and Pillbot went over to it, tried to move it. A slight filmy\nwebwork around the projection caught Harper's eye. Now he\nknew--the Being had somehow affixed it to the spot as a landmark,\nso It could locate the laboratory. It must have been this\nprojection that had first attracted the Being's attention to the\nthree dimensional world, since, ordinarily, It would never have\nnoticed the presence of three dimensional life, any more than\nhumans would notice the presence of two dimensional life if such\nexisted!\n\nHarper looked up at a bleat from Pillbot. Above them was a sudden\nfurious play of lights and shades. Vast masses seemed shifting in\ncrazy juxtapositions, now descending rapidly toward them.\n\n\"Quick,\" Harper, now fully aroused, gasped to Pillbot. \"Climb\ndown this projection!\"\n\n\"Climb down it--?\"\n\n\"Yes, there is a fluid condition of space where it penetrates\nbetween the two planes. By hugging its contours you will emerge\ninto the laboratory--I hope!\"\n\nPillbot glanced overhead nervously, then experimentally slid a\nfont down the projection. The foot vanished. With a cry of\nrelief, Pillbot lowered himself until only head and shoulders\nwere visible. Then that too vanished.\n\nHarper looked up. Some monstrous suggestion of Form was almost\nupon him. He grasped the projection and just as his head sank out\nof sight the Form seemed to smash down on him.\n\nPillbot helped Harper to his feet, from where he had sprawled at\nthe base of the statue, on the laboratory floor.\n\n\"Quick,\" he gasped. \"The Creature will be infuriated now, by our\nescape from Its realm. A maniacal spasm is sure to follow. We\nmust get Gault back in some way, then leave the laboratory.\"\n\nEven as they dashed over toward the abbreviated form of Gault,\nthe laboratory shook. Invisible strains seemed to be bulging the\nwalls inward.\n\nHarper rushed to the desk upon which still reposed the cutout, the\nsection between neck and waist still arched off the surface. As Harper\nreached toward the cutout to press it flat, Gault's eyes widened, his\nmouth opened in a soundless shout of opposition. Harper hesitated.\n\n\"Never mind him,\" yammered Pillbot. \"Press the figure flat!\"\n\nHarper pressed it flat.\n\nFor an instant the laboratory stopped its ominous vibration. Then\nthe figure of Gault flew through the air, came up against a\nwall--but it was his complete figure.\n\n\"More signs of violence,\" cried Pillbot. \"But that action won't\nappease It--we must get out of here--\"\n\nEven as he spoke there was a thunderous crackling and roaring.\nHarper felt himself flying about, and for an instant of awful\nvertigo he did not know up from down. Forces seemed to be tearing\nat him. He felt as though he were a piece of iron being attracted\nsimultaneously in several directions by powerful electro magnets.\n\nThere was a flare of colored lights, a deafening detonation--and\nhe felt himself knocked breathless against a wall.\n\nHe picked himself up, looked around.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn one side of him was the familiar south wall of the laboratory.\nTo the north, east and west was--open air. He was standing on a\nsection of laboratory flooring that jutted out over empty space\nfrom the wall. His desk was a few feet away, right at the edge of\nthe jutting floor. Gault and Pillbot were picking themselves up\nto one side of the desk.\n\nThe pair looked over the edge of the floor, then recoiled,\nfrenziedly hugging the flooring under them.\n\nHarper crawled over, looked over the edge, quickly backed away.\nSeveral hundred feet below, the traffic of the city roared!\n\nGault went over to the door in the one wall, opened it, then\nstepped back quickly, his face pale.\n\n\"The laboratory has been turned inside out!\" he shouted. \"We are\non the outside!\"\n\n\"We must get away from here,\" squalled Pillbot. \"Another spasm of\nthe creature will precipitate us into the street!\"\n\nGault forgot his apprehensions long enough to freeze Harper with\na glance. \"This is all your doing,\" he bawled. \"You with your\nabsurd doodling, which attracted the attention of some Being of\nthe fourth dimension!\" In his anger, he overlooked the fact that\nhe was contradicting his formerly held opinion.\n\n\"The laboratory wrecked,\" he continued, \"and that isn't all!\" He\nstalked up to the cringing Harper, thrust his face toward him.\n\n\"Do you know,\" he yelled, \"why I didn't want to be returned\nhastily--why I didn't want you to bring me back by flattening out\nthe paper cutout? You dolt, did you ever try to get a crease out\nof a piece of paper?\"\n\n\"I--I don't understand,\" murmured Harper.\n\n\"That paper doll was creased, wasn't it?\" shouted Gault.\n\n\"Once a piece of paper is creased,\" he resumed heatedly, \"it\ncan't be perfectly flattened out again. At the crease a thin\ncross-section continues to bulge--into the third dimension in the\ncase of that paper cutout. Into the fourth dimension in my case!\n_I'm creased too_, at the line where I was bent into the fourth\ndimension! Surely you aren't blind?\"\n\nHarper staggered back as he saw it--a thin, horizontal line of\nlight shining through Gault's body--across his waistline, through\nclothes and all.\n\n\"I shall have to go through life this way,\" Gault snarled, \"due\nto your imbecilic 'doodling', your meddling with what you don't\nunderstand. Go about constantly with a slit of daylight showing\nthrough me. _You're fired!_\"\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" cried Pillbot. \"The entity--we must get away.\nAnother spasm will surely follow--\"\n\nHarper didn't think so. A few feet away he had noticed\nsomething--his statue lying on its side. It was all there,\nincluding the portion that had been in the fourth dimension. The\nEntity's \"landmark\" was gone. Harper didn't believe It would\nlocate this particular area of the third dimension again.\n\nThe scream of a fire siren rose up to them. As a ladder scraped\nover the projecting floor, Harper fondly felt the pad in his\npocket with the formula on it. He wasn't worried now about having\nbeen fired. He was seeing visions of a small cottage with\nJudith....\n\nOf course, he would have to be careful in the future with his\n\"doodling\"! He could not again risk attracting the attention of\nsome four dimensional Being--not with Judith to think about!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The 4-D Doodler, by Graph Waldeyer\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE 4-D DOODLER ***\n\n***** This file should be named 22227.txt or 22227.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/2/2/2/22227/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Sankar Viswanathan, and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
