I remember\nthe hot, cling-film-in-a-microwave smell of it, and Da's look of\nferocious concentration as he filled it with fresh goop, and the warm,\nfresh-baked feel of the objects that came out of it.\n\nThe coppers came through the door with truncheons swinging, one of them\nreciting the terms of the warrant through a bullhorn.  One of Da's\ncustomers had shopped him.  The ipolice paid in high-grade\npharmaceuticals -- performance enhancers, memory supplements, metabolic\nboosters.  The kind of things that cost a fortune over the counter; the\nkind of things you could print at home, if you didn't mind the risk of\nhaving your kitchen filled with a sudden crush of big, beefy bodies,\nhard truncheons whistling through the air, smashing anyone and anything\nthat got in the way.\n\nThey destroyed grandma's trunk, the one she'd brought from the old\ncountry.  They smashed our little refrigerator and the purifier unit\nover the window.  My tweetybird escaped death by hiding in a corner of\nhis cage as a big, booted foot crushed most of it into a sad tangle of\nprinter-wire.\n\nDa.  What they did to him.  When he was done, he looked like he'd been\nbrawling with an entire rugby side.  They brought him out the door and\nlet the newsies get a good look at him as they tossed him in the car.\nAll the while a spokesman told the world that my Da's organized-crime\nbootlegging operation had been responsible for at least 20 million in\ncontraband, and that my Da, the desperate villain, had resisted arrest.\n\nI saw it all from my phone, in the remains of the sitting room, watching\nit on the screen and wondering how, just how anyone could look at our\nlittle flat and our terrible, manky estate and mistake it for the home\nof an organized crime kingpin.  They took the printer away, of course,\nand displayed it like a trophy for the newsies.  Its little shrine in\nthe kitchenette seemed horribly empty.  When I roused myself and picked\nup the flat and rescued my poor peeping tweetybird, I put a blender\nthere.  It was made out of printed parts, so it would only last a month\nbefore I'd need to print new bearings and other moving parts.  Back\nthen, I could take apart and reassemble anything that could be printed.\n\nBy the time I turned 18, they were ready to let Da out of prison.  I'd\nvisited him three times -- on my tenth birthday, on his fiftieth, and\nwhen Ma died.  It had been two years since I'd last seen him and he was\nin bad shape.  A prison fight had left him with a limp, and he looked\nover his shoulder so often it was like he had a tic.  I was embarrassed\nwhen the minicab dropped us off in front of the estate, and tried to\nkeep my distance from this ruined, limping skeleton as we went inside\nand up the stairs.\n\n\"Lanie,\" he said, as he sat me down.  \"You're a smart girl, I know that.\nYou wouldn't know where your old Da could get a printer and some goop?\"\n\nI squeezed my hands into fists so tight my fingernails cut into my\npalms.  I closed my eyes.  \"You've been in prison for ten years, Da.\nTen.  Years.  You're going to risk another ten years to print out more\nblenders and pharma, more laptops and designer hats?\"\n\nHe grinned.  \"I'm not stupid, Lanie.  I've learned my lesson.  There's\nno hat or laptop that's worth going to jail for.  I'm not going to print\nnone of that rubbish, never again.\" He had a cup of tea, and he drank it\nnow like it was whisky, a sip and then a long, satisfied exhalation.  He\nclosed his eyes and leaned back in his chair.\n\n\"Come here, Lanie, let me whisper in your ear.  Let me tell you the\nthing that I decided while I spent ten years in lockup.  Come here and\nlisten to your stupid Da.\"\n\nI felt a guilty pang about ticking him off.  He was off his rocker, that\nmuch was clear.  God knew what he went through in prison.  \"What, Da?\" I\nsaid, leaning in close.\n\n\"Lanie, I'm going to print more printers.  Lots more printers.  One for\neveryone.  That's worth going to jail for.  That's worth anything.\"\n\n--------\n\nCory Doctorow has spent the past four years at the Electronic Frontier\nFoundation (www.eff.org), fighting at the United Nations and in\ntech-standards bodies to balance the rights of copyright and patent\nholders with the public interest.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\n\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\ndownload by the etext year.\n\nhttp://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06\n\n    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\n\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\nfiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\nof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\nidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\n\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234\n\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689\n\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/GUTINDEX.ALL\n\n*** END: FULL LICENSE ***\n"}
