Smith\n\n\n                    Illustrated by Rudolph Palais\n\n\n     _Colonel Johns, that famous Revolutionary War hero, had the\n      unique--and painful--experience of meeting his\n      great-great-great-great granddaughter. Now maybe you can't\n      change history, but what's there to prevent a soldier from\n      changing his mind about the gal he is going to marry?_\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nClark Decker winced and scrounged still lower in his seat as Mrs.\nAppleby-Simpkin rested her enormous bosom on the front of the podium\nand smiled down on the Patriot Daughters of America in convention\nassembled as she announced: \"And now, my dears, I will read you one\nmore short quotation from Major Wicks' fascinating book 'The Minor\nTactics of The American Revolution.' When I am finished, I know that\nyou will all agree that Rebecca Johns-Hayes will be a more than\nfitting successor to myself as your President.\"\n\nDecker looked wildly about for a way of escape from the convention\nauditorium. If he had only remained in the anteroom with Professor\nMacCulloch and the Historical Reintegrator! After suffering through\nfour days of speeches by ladies in various stages of mammalian\ntop-heaviness, he hadn't believed it possible that anyone could top\nMrs. Appleby-Simpkin for either sheer ability to bore or for the\nnobility of her bust. Mrs. Rebecca Johns-Hayes had come as something\nof a shock as she squirmed her way onto the speaker's platform. But\nthere she was as big as life, or rather bigger, smiling at Mrs.\nAppleby-Simpkin, the Past President, beaming at Mrs. Lynd-Torris, a\ndefeated candidate for the presidency and whose ancestor had been only\na captain, and completely ignoring Mrs. Tolman, the other defeated\ncandidate whose ancestor had been so inconsiderate as to have been a\nContinental sergeant. Only the thought that now that the voting was\nover and the new president chosen, the ladies might be ready for the\ndemonstration of the Reintegrator had brought Decker onto the\nconvention floor, and now he was trapped and would have to listen.\n\n\"And so,\" Mrs. Appleby-Simpkin was reading, \"upon such small events do\nthe great moments of history depend. The brilliant scouting and\nskirmishing of the riflemen under Colonel Peter Johns prevented the\nbreakthrough of Captain Fosdick's column and the possible flanking of\nthe American army before Saratoga. Thus, this little known action may\nhave been the deciding factor in the whole campaign that prevented\nGeneral Burgoyne from carrying out the British plan to divide the\ncolonies and end the war. It is impossible for the historian to\nrefrain from speculation as to what might have happened had Colonel\nJohns not been on hand to direct the riflemen and militia in this\nsection; as indeed he might _not_ have been, since his own regiment of\nshort-term enlistees had returned to Pennsylvania a few days\npreviously. Only the Colonel's patriotism and devotion to duty kept\nhim in the field and made his abilities available to the country when\nthey were most needed.\"\n\nMrs. Appleby-Simpkin waited until the burst of applause\nhad died down and then continued, \"That is the man whose\ngreat-great-great-great-granddaughter you have elected your\npresident today ... Mrs. Rebecca Johns-Hayes!\" Turning to Mrs.\nJohns-Hayes she went on, \"Before you make your acceptance speech,\ndear, we have a little surprise for you.\"\n\nClark Decker had been edging his way toward the side of the auditorium\nwhere the Men's Auxiliary of the Daughters had their seats but he\nturned back at the mention of the surprise. It sounded as though it\nwas time for him and the Professor to start their demonstration.\n\n\"A surprise which we hope will also be a surprise to the whole world\nof science,\" Mrs. Appleby-Simpkin was holding the podium against a\ndeterminedly advancing Mrs. Johns-Hayes. \"Indeed we may be able to say\nin future years, that the 1989 Convention of the Patriot Daughters was\nmarked by the first public demonstration of one of the most momentous\ninventions in the history of science.\" The Past President was speaking\nfaster and faster, because the new President with a hand full of notes\nwas doing her best to edge her away from both the podium and the\nmicrophone.\n\n\"Thank you, darling,\" Mrs. Johns-Hayes said, pulling the microphone\nfirmly toward her, \"but we really must get along with business. I have\nquite a few things I want to say and several motions which I want to\nplace before the Convention.\"\n\n\"And as I was saying, dear,\" Mrs. Appleby-Simpkin said, pulling the\nmicrophone back with equal firmness, \"I know that you will be just\nunbearably thrilled.\" There was another brief struggle for the mike and\nMrs. Appleby-Simpkin won and went on. \"I know that he will be just as\nproud of you as you are of him. That is why we have arranged for Professor\nMacCulloch to demonstrate his historical Reintegrator at our convention by\nbringing into our midst Colonel Peter Johns, the hero of the action at\nTemple Farm, to see his great-great-great-great-granddaughter installed as\nthe fifty-fourth president of the Loyal Order of Patriot Daughters of\nAmerica. Now I....\" Mrs. Johns-Hayes again won control of the mike.\n\n\"Thank you very much, dear.\" Her voice was a genteel screech. \"I'm\nsure that we will be only too glad to have the ... who? Who did you\nsay?\" Mrs. Appleby-Simpkin regained the microphone from the other\nwoman's relaxing grip.\n\n\"I believe I see Mr. Decker, the Professor's assistant, in the\naudience,\" she said. \"Will you be so good as to tell the Professor\nthat we are ready for his epic-making experiment?\"\n\nWith a great feeling of relief, Decker escaped from the rising turmoil\nof the convention hall into the relative quiet of the anteroom where\nMacCulloch waited with the Reintegrator. He found the Professor\nsitting with his head in his hands staring at the machine. The little\nman looked up and smiled quizzically as his assistant approached him.\n\n\"They're ready, Professor! They're ready!\" Still under the influence\nof the convention, Decker found himself shouting.\n\n\"Ah. Ah, yes. Then it will be today. I've waited so long. Ten years of\nwork and now instead of a scientific gathering, I have to demonstrate\nmy machine before a woman's club.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDecker began to wheel the platform which held the Reintegrator toward the\ndoor. \"After today, Professor, all the scientific organizations in the\nworld will have heard of you and will be demanding demonstrations.\"\n\n\"Yes, but these Patriot Daughters! Who are they? Who in the scientific\nworld ever heard of them?\"\n\n\"No one except a few scientists unfortunate enough to fall afoul of\ntheir Loyalty and Conformity Committee.\"\n\n\"I think we should have gone elsewhere for our demonstration.\"\n\n\"Now Professor. Who in the world today would be interested in the past\nexcept a group of ancestor conscious women?\"\n\n\"Some historical society perhaps,\" the Professor said wistfully.\n\n\"And what historical society could have advanced the twenty thousand\ndollars we needed to complete the machine?\"\n\n\"I suppose you're right, my boy,\" MacCulloch sighed as he helped push\nthe Reintegrator onto the auditorium floor.\n\nBy the time Clark Decker reached the platform to explain the\ndemonstration, the fight for the microphone had turned into a\nthree-way struggle. A lady who represented the Finance Committee was\ntrying to win it away from both the Past President and the new\nPresident.\n\nTaking them by surprise, Decker managed to gain control long enough to\nexplain what was about to happen.\n\n\"You mean,\" demanded Mrs. Johns-Hayes, \"that this is some sort of time\nmachine and you're going to transport great-great-great-great-grandfather\nfrom the past into the present?\"\n\n\"No, Mrs. Hayes. This isn't a time machine in the comic book use of\nthe term. It is just what Professor MacCulloch has called it, an\nhistorical Reintegrator. The theory upon which it is based, the\nMacCulloch Reaction, says that every person who ever existed, and\nevery event which ever took place caused electrical disturbances in\nthe space-time continuum of the universe by displacing an equal and\nidentical group of electrons. The task of the Reintegrator is to\nreassemble those electrons. That is why Professor MacCulloch is now\nplacing your ancestor's sword in the machine. We will use that as a\nbase point from which our recreation will begin.\"\n\nThe machine was humming and small lights were beginning to play about\nits tubes and dials. \"If our calculations are accurate, and we believe\nthat they are,\" Decker said, \"within a very few minutes, Colonel Johns\nshould be standing before us as he was on a day approximately a week\nbefore his heroic action in the battle at Temple Farm.\"\n\nMrs. Johns-Hayes, although still gripping her notes, was beginning to\nget a little flustered. \"Oh my, that would be before he married\ngreat-great-great-great-grandmother Sayles. They were married only two\ndays before the battle, you know. It was so romantic ... a wartime\nromance and all.\"\n\n\"Just imagine,\" Mrs. Tolman remarked, \"at that time your whole family\nwas just a gleam in the Colonel's eye!\"\n\nProfessor MacCulloch made one or two last passes at the machine and\nthen stood back to watch, a look of pure scientific ecstasy on his\nface. A mistiness began to gather on the platform where the Colonel's\nsword lay and through it from time to time shot sparks of electricity.\nSuddenly a gasp went up from the assembled Daughters as a man's head\nand shoulders appeared and expanded downward, a long way downward, to\na large pair of feet. There was one last hum from the machine and then\na tall young man in faded blue regimentals and very much in need of a\nshave was standing blinking in the blazing lights of the auditorium.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Decker, surely there's some mistake!\" was Mrs. Johns-Hayes'\nfirst comment as she surveyed the very tall, very tattered, and very\ndirty young man. \"Great-great-great-great-grandfather's pictures\nalways show him as a dignified old gentleman.\"\n\nThe Colonel took one quick look around and made a grab for his sword, but\nthe Professor managed to calm him and to explain the situation before any\nviolence could take place. After a few minutes of hurried talk, MacCulloch\nsteered the Colonel in the direction of the speaker's platform for the\nmeeting with his great-great-great-great-granddaughter.\n\nPeter Johns' bewilderment faded into astonishment, but he still\ngripped his sword as the Professor guided him through the throngs of\nexcited ladies onto the stage. He paused momentarily to look at the\nbrilliant lights and at the huge number of American flags which hung\noverhead. A picture of George Washington, hung among the flags, seemed\nto reassure him and he allowed the Professor to lead him to Mrs.\nJohns-Hayes.\n\nThat lady had drawn herself together at the approach of her ancestor and\nhad obviously decided to carry it off as best she could. She advanced to\nmeet him crying, \"Dear, dear great-great-great-great-grandfather! This is\nsuch a pleasure! You can't know how proud all of us in the family have\nalways been of you.\"\n\nThe young Continental officer stared open mouthed at the red-faced,\nbig-bosomed woman who was twice his age, but who addressed him as\ngreat-great-great-great-grandfather. Then he turned to MacCulloch who\nstood beside him. \"Are you sure you have the right man?\" he asked.\n\n\"Oh yes! Perfectly, perfectly! You're Colonel Peter Johns of Pamworth,\nPennsylvania, and this is your great-great-great-great-granddaughter,\nRebecca Johns-Hayes.\"\n\n\"Rebecca? You mean she's named after Becky Sayles?\" The Colonel rubbed\na hand across his several days' growth of beard.\n\n\"That's right, dear great-great-great-great-grandfather. I'm named\nafter great-great-great-great-grandmother,\" Mrs. Johns-Hayes\nannounced.\n\n\"Then I married Becky Sayles?\" the Colonel asked.\n\n\"Why, of course! Aren't you planning on getting married in a few\ndays?\" Clark Decker asked.\n\nThe Colonel was embarrassed but he grinned, \"Well, I don't rightly\nknow. Miss Sayles and I have been courtin' for some months but there's\nlittle Jennie Taylor down in Trenton.... To tell the truth, I haven't\nquite made up my mind.\"\n\n\"Well! Of all things! What would the family think! What would great\nAunt Mary Hayes say?\" Mrs. Johns-Hayes puffed out even farther than\nusual.\n\n\"Well, we can ease your mind on that subject, Colonel. The history\nbooks say that you married Miss Sayles--and here is Mrs. Johns-Hayes\nto prove it.\"\n\nThe Colonel scratched his chin again as he looked at Mrs. Johns-Hayes.\n\"Is that so? Is that so? What's all this about history books? You mean\nI got in history because I married Becky Sayles?\"\n\nThe Professor laughed. \"Well, not exactly. It was because of your\nheroism in the defeat of Burgoyne's army. If you hadn't blocked\nCaptain Fenwick's flanking move at Temple Farm, the American army\nunder General Gates might have been defeated and the Colonies might\neven have lost the war.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll be.... Me? I did all that? I didn't even know there was\ngoing to be a battle. Did I end up a live hero or a dead one?\" The\nColonel was beginning to feel a bit more easy in his surroundings,\nand, to the horror of Mrs. Johns-Hayes, took a plug of tobacco out of\nhis pocket and bit off a piece and began to chew it.\n\n\"You came through the battle with only a slight wound and lived to a\nripe old age surrounded by grandchildren,\" the Professor told him.\n\n\"Then I reckon I won't go back to Pennsylvania with the other boys.\nThey figure that since their enlistments are up, it's time to get back\nto the farm and let them New Yorkers do some of their own fighting.\"\n\n\"Oh no! You weren't thinking of going back--of leaving the fighting?\"\nMrs. Johns-Hayes demanded.\n\nThe Colonel shifted his wad of tobacco and looked at the woman\ncarefully as though he couldn't quite believe the evidence of his\neyes. \"No, ma'am, I don't reckon I am. I don't exactly look on it the\nsame as the other boys do. I kind of feel like if we're ever going to\nhave a country, it's worth fighting for.\"\n\nMrs. Johns-Hayes beamed, as did all the other officers of the\nDaughters. \"Well, your faith and heroism have been rewarded,\ngreat-great-great-great-grandfather. I know you'll be proud to know\nthat these ladies whom you see before you are the present guardians of\nthe ideals that you fought for.\"\n\n\"Well, now, is that so, ma'am? Is that so?\" Peter Johns looked around\nthe convention hall in amazement.\n\n\"And that I, your descendant, have just been elected their President!\"\n\n\"Well, what do you know about that! Maybe all the hard times and the\ndanger we been going through is worth it if you folks still remember\nthe way we felt about things.\"\n\n\"It's too bad,\" Decker whispered to MacCulloch, \"that we can't let him\nsee what the country is really like. I'm not sure these ladies are\nrepresentative.\"\n\nThere was a worried look on the Professor's face. \"That's impossible.\nThe reintegration is good for only an hour or so. I hope nothing goes\nwrong here.\"\n\nMrs. Appleby-Simpkin took charge of the Colonel and ushered him to a\nseat of honor near the podium while the new President prepared to\ndeliver her speech. Decker and the professor managed to obtain seats\non either side of Johns just as Rebecca started. He managed to whisper\nto them, \"I'm sure amazed! I'm sure amazed! All these nice old ladies\nfeeling the same way about things as we do.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDecker had a premonition of trouble as Mrs. Hayes' words poured forth.\nHe had hoped for a cut and dried acceptance speech with nothing but\nthe usual patriotic platitudes, but, as she went on his worst fears\nwere realized. Inspired by the presence of her ancestor, the woman was\ngoing into superlatives about the purposes and aims of the Patriot\nDaughters. She covered everything from the glories of her ancestry to\nthe morals of the younger generation and women in politics.\n\nDecker watched the Colonel's face, saw it changed from puzzlement to\npainful boredom as word after word floated from the battery of\nspeakers overhead.\n\nMacCulloch was whispering in Johns' ear in an attempt to draw his\nattention from the woman's booming voice but the man disregarded him.\n\"Am I really responsible for that?\" The Colonel jerked his head in the\ndirection of Mrs. Johns-Hayes.\n\n\"I'm afraid, Colonel, that you're getting a distorted idea of what\nAmerica is like in our time,\" Decker said. The Colonel didn't even\nturn to look at him. He was scowling at his Amazonian descendant as\nher screeching reached new heights.\n\n\"... and we hold that this is true! Our simple motto, as you all know,\nis: One race, one creed, one way of thinking!\"\n\nColonel Johns began to squirm violently in his seat. The professor\nfound it necessary to grasp him firmly by one arm while Decker held\nhim by the other.\n\nThe president of the Patriot Daughters had finished her speech amidst\nthunderous applause and started to present suggestions for the\nformation of new committees, for the passing of new by-laws and for\nresolutions.\n\n\"A committee should be formed to see that the public parks are\nproperly policed to prevent so-called 'spooners' from pursuing their\nimmoral behaviour.\n\n\"A new by-law is needed,\" and here Mrs. Hayes glanced aside at Mrs.\nTolman, \"to prevent members being accepted unless their forebears were\nlieutenants or of higher rank in the glorious Continental army.\"\n\nThe Colonel was a strong man and both Decker and MacCulloch were older\nthan he. With something between a snort and a roar he shook them loose\nand started for the exit.\n\n\"Oh my,\" MacCulloch moaned, \"I was afraid that this whole thing was a\nmistake.\"\n\nColonel Johns had taken only two steps toward the door when he seemed\nto stagger. MacCulloch leaped to his side and caught him by the arm.\nThere was an uproar in the auditorium as the Colonel faded slightly\nand the professor hurried him down the steps toward the Reintegrator.\n\n\"I'm afraid the Colonel isn't going to be with us much longer,\" the\nprofessor explained.\n\nThank goodness, Decker thought, I don't believe the poor man could\nhave stood it much longer.\n\n\"I'm afraid the reintegration time of Colonel Johns is running out and\nhe must return to his own time,\" the professor went on.\n\nThe grim-faced Colonel said nothing as MacCulloch led him up to the\nmachine.\n\n\"Goodbye, great-great-great-great-grandfather,\" Mrs. Johns-Hayes\ncalled from the platform. \"It has been so nice having you with us.\"\n\n\"Goodbye, Rebecca,\" the Colonel said as he began to fade away.\n\n\"Give my regards to great-great-great-great-grandmother.\"\n\nThe figure in the dirty, faded blue uniform was gone but Decker and\nMacCulloch heard him mutter just before he disappeared altogether, \"I\nwill, if I ever see her again!\"\n\nMacCulloch turned to stare at the platform and Decker turned to follow\nhis gaze. A sudden dizziness overcame them both and there was a slight\nhaze about the auditorium. When it cleared, the podium was empty. Mrs.\nJohns-Hayes was gone as if she had never been.\n\n\"My God!,\" the professor gasped. \"I was afraid something like this\nmight happen. He must have married the other girl.\"\n\n\"I suppose,\" Decker said quietly, \"that we should consider ourselves\nlucky that he didn't decide to go back to Pennsylvania.\" His voice\nbroke off and he wondered what he had been saying. He looked up at the\nspeakers' platform trying to remember why he should think it strange\nthat it was draped in Union Jacks and that Lady Appleby-Simpkin should\nbe saying, \"And now, my dears, I know that all of you, as Loyal\nDaughters of the British Empire will be happy to know....\"\n\n                                                           ...

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
