Connor had wanted to speak\nto Rhoda, his wife, wished himself onto a trunk line and then waited.\n\"Dallas Shipping here, Mars and points Jupiterward, at your service,\"\nsaid a business-is-business, unwifely voice in his mind.\n\n\"I was not calling you,\" he thought back into the line, now also getting\na picture, first flat, then properly 3-D and in color. It was a\nparaNormally luxurious commercial office.\n\n\"I am the receptionist at Dallas Shipping,\" the woman thought back\nfirmly. \"You rang and I answered.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I rang right,\" Connor insisted.\n\n\"And I'm sure I know my job,\" Dallas Shipping answered. \"I have received\nas many as five hundred thought messages a day, some of them highly\ndetailed and technical and--\"\n\n\"Forget it,\" snapped Connor. \"Let's say I focussed wrong.\"\n\nHe pulled back and twenty seconds later finally had Rhoda on the line.\n\"Queerest thing happened,\" he projected. \"I just got a wrong party.\"\n\n\"Nothing queer about it,\" his wife smiled, springing to warm life on his\ninner eye. \"You just weren't concentrating, Connor.\"\n\n\"Don't you hand me that too,\" he grumbled. \"I _know_ I thought on the\nright line into Central. Haven't I been using the System for sixty\nyears?\"\n\n\"Exactly--all habit and no attention.\"\n\nHow smugly soothing she was some days! \"I think the trouble's in Central\nitself. The Switcher isn't receiving me clearly.\"\n\n\"Lately I've had some peculiar miscalls myself,\" Rhoda said nervously.\n\"But you _can't_ blame Central Switching!\"\n\n\"Oh, I didn't mean that!\" By now he was equally nervous and only too\nhappy to end the conversation. Ordinarily communications were not\nmonitored but if this one had been there could certainly be a slander\ncomplaint.\n\n       *       *       *\n\nOn his way home in the monorail Connor tried to reach his office and had\nthe frightening experience of having his telepathic call refused by\nCentral. Then he refused in turn to accept a call being projected at\nhim, but when an Urgent classification was added he had to take it. \"For\nyour unfounded slander of Central Switching's functioning,\" announced\nthe mechanically-synthesized voice, \"you are hereby Suspended\nindefinitely from the telepathic net. From this point on all paraNormal\nprivileges are withdrawn and you will be able to communicate with your\nfellows only in person or by written message.\"\n\nStunned, Connor looked about at his fellow passengers. Most of them had\ntheir eyes closed and their faces showed the mild little smile which was\nthe outer hallmark of a mind at rest, tuned in to a music channel or\nsome other of the hundreds of entertainment lines available from\nCentral. How much he had taken that for granted just a few minutes ago!\n\nThree men, more shabbily dressed, were unsmilingly reading books. They\nwere fellow pariahs, Suspended for one reason or another from\nparaNormal privileges. Only the dullest, lowest-paying jobs were\navailable to them while anyone inside the System could have Central read\nany book and transmit the information directly into his cortex. The\nshabbiest one of all looked up and his sympathetic glance showed that he\nhad instantly grasped Connor's changed situation.\n\nConnor looked hastily away; he didn't want any sympathy from that kind\nof 'human' being! Then he shuddered. Wasn't he, himself, now that kind\nin every way except his ability to admit it?\n\nWhen he stepped onto the lushly hydroponic platform at the suburban stop\nthe paraNormals, ordinarily friendly, showed that they, too, already\nrealized what had happened. Each pair of suddenly icy eyes went past him\nas if he were not there at all.\n\nHe walked up the turf-covered lane toward his house, feeling hopelessly\ndefeated. How would he manage to maintain a home here in the middle of\ngreen and luxuriant beauty? More people than ever were now outside the\nSystem for one reason or another and most of these unfortunates were\ncrowded in metropolitan centers which were slumhells to anyone who had\nknown something better.\n\nHow could he have been so thoughtless because of a little lapse in\nCentral's mechanism? Now that it was denied him, probably forever, he\nsaw more clearly the essential perfection of the system that had brought\norder into the chaos following the discovery of universal paraNormal\ncapacities. At first there had been endless interference between minds\ntrying to reach each other while fighting off unwanted calls. Men had\neven suggested this blessing turned curse be annulled.\n\nThe Central Synaptic Computation Receptor and Transmitter System had\nended all such negative thinking. For the past century and a half it had\nneatly routed telepathic transmissions with an efficiency that made\nancient telephone exchanges look like Stone Age toys. A mind could\ninstantly exchange information with any other Subscribing mind and still\nshut itself off through the Central machine if and when it needed\nprivacy. Except, he shuddered once more, if Central put that Urgent\nrating on a call. Now only Rhoda could get a job to keep them from the\ninner slumlands.\n\nHe turned into his garden and watched Max, the robot, spading in the\npetunia bed. The chrysanthemums really needed more attention and he was\ngoing to think the order to Max when he realized with a new shock that\nall orders would have to be oral now. He gave up the idea of saying\nanything and stomped gloomily into the house.\n\n       *       *       *\n\nAs he hung his jacket in the hall closet he heard Rhoda coming\ndownstairs. \"Queer thing happened today,\" he said with forced\ncheerfulness, \"but we'll manage.\" He stopped as Rhoda appeared. Her eyes\nwere red and puffed.\n\n\"I tried to reach you,\" she sobbed.\n\n\"Oh, you already know. Well, we can manage, you know, honey. You can\nwork two days a week and--\"\n\n\"You don't understand,\" she screamed at him. \"_I'm_ Suspended too! I\ntried to tell it I hadn't done anything but it said I was guilty by\nbeing associated with you.\"\n\nStunned, he fell back into a chair. \"Not you, too, darling!\" He had been\ngetting used to the idea of his own reduced status but this was too\nbrutal. \"Tell Central you'll leave me and the guilt will be gone.\"\n\n\"You fool, I did say that and my defense was refused!\"\n\nTears welled in his eyes. Was there no bottom to this horror? \"You\nyourself suggested that?\"\n\n\"Why shouldn't I?\" she cried. \"It wasn't my fault at all.\"\n\nHe sat there and tried not to listen as waves of hate rolled over him.\nThen the front bell rang and Rhoda answered it.\n\n\"I haven't been able to reach you,\" someone was saying through the door.\nIt was Sheila Williams who lived just down the lane. \"Lately lines seem\nto get tied up more and more. It's about tonight's game.\"\n\nJust then Rhoda opened the door and Sheila came to an abrupt halt as she\nsaw her old friend's face. Her expression turned stony and she said, \"I\nwanted you to know the game is off.\" Then she strode away.\n\nUnbelieving, Rhoda watched her go. \"After forty years!\" she exclaimed.\nShe slowly came back to her husband and stared down at him. \"Forty years\nof 'undying' friendship, gone like that!\" Her eyes softened a little.\n\"Maybe I'm wrong, Connor, maybe I said too much through Central myself.\nAnd maybe I'd have acted like Sheila if _they_ had been the ones.\"\n\nHe withdrew his hands from his face. \"I've done the same thing to other\nwretches myself. We'll just have to get used to it somehow. I've enough\nsocial credits to hang on here a year anyway.\"\n\n\"Get used to it,\" she repeated dully. This time there was no\ndenunciation but she had to flee up the stairs to be alone.\n\nHe went to the big bay window and, trying to keep his mind blank,\nwatched Max re-spading the petunia bed. He really should go out and\ntell the robot to stop, he decided, otherwise the same work would be\nrepeated again and again. But he just watched for the next hour as Max\nkept returning to the far end of the bed and working his way up to the\nwindow, nodding mindlessly with each neat twist of his spade attachment.\n\nRhoda came back downstairs and said, \"It's six-thirty. The first time\nsince the boys left that they didn't call us at six.\" He thought of Ted\non Mars and Phil on Venus and sighed. \"By now,\" she went on, \"they know\nwhat's happened. Usually colonial children just refuse to have anything\nmore to do with parents like us. And they're right--they have their own\nfutures to consider.\"\n\n\"They'll still write to us,\" he started reassuring her but she had\nalready gone outside where he could hear her giving Max vocal\ninstructions for preparing dinner. Which was just as well--she would\nknow the truth soon enough. Without a doubt the boys were now also\nguilty by association and they'd have nothing left to lose by\nmaintaining contact.\n\nAt dinner, though, he felt less kindly toward her and snapped a few\ntimes. Then it was Rhoda's turn to exercise forebearance and to try to\nsmooth things over. Once she looked out the picture window at the\nperfect synthetic thatch of the Williams' great cottage, peeping over\nthe hollyhock-topped rise of ground at the end of the garden. \"Well?\" he\ndemanded. \"Well?\"\n\n\"Nothing, Connor.\"\n\n\"You sighed and I want to know what the devil--\"\n\n\"Since you insist--I was thinking how lucky Sheila Williams always is.\nTen years ago the government authorized twins for her while I haven't\nhad a child in thirty years, and now our disaster forewarns her. She'll\nnever get caught off guard on a paraNormal line.\"\n\n       *       *       *\n\nHe snapped his fingers and Max brought out the pudding in a softly\nshining silver bowl. Above it hovered a bluish halo of flaming brandy.\n\"Maybe not. I've heard of people even being Suspended without a reason.\"\nHe slowly savored the first spoonful as if it might be the last ever.\nFrom now on every privileged pleasure would have that special value.\n\"One more year of such delights.\"\n\n\"If we can stand the ostracism.\"\n\n\"We can.\" Suddenly he was all angry determination. \"I did the wrong\nthing today, admitted, but it really was the truth, what I said. I've\nconcentrated right and still got wrong numbers!\"\n\n\"Me too, but I kept thinking it was my own fault.\"\n\n\"The real truth's that while the System assumes more authority each\ndecade it keeps getting less efficient.\"\n\n\"Well, why doesn't the government do something, get everything back in\nworking order?\"\n\nHis grin showed no pleasure. \"Do you know anybody who could help repair\na Master Central Computer?\"\n\n\"Not personally but there must be--\"\n\n\"Must be nothing! People are slack from having it so good, don't think\nas much as they used to. Why bother when you can tap Central for any\ninformation? _Almost_ any information.\"\n\n\"How can it all end?\"\n\n\"Who knows and who cares?\" He was angry all over again. \"It will still\nbe working well enough for a few centuries and we, we're just left out\nin the cold! I'm only ninety, I can live another sixty years, and you,\nyou're going to have a good seventy-five more of this deprivation.\"\n\nMax was standing at the foot of the table, metal visual lids closed as\nhe waited for instructions. Rhoda considered him unthinkingly, then\nsnapped back to attention. \"Nothing more, Max, go to the kitchen and\ndisconnect until you hear from us.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said in that programmed tone which indicated endless gratitude\nfor the privilege of half-being.\n\n\"That ends my sad day,\" Connor sighed. \"I'm taking a blackout pill and\nintend to stay that way for the next fourteen hours.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe next morning he rode into the city in the same car as the one that\nhad brought him back the day before. None of the regulars even deigned\nto look in his direction. There was another change today. Only two\nfellow Suspendeds were reading their books even though there had been\nthree for the past few months. Which meant another one had exhausted his\nincome and was being forced into the inner city.\n\nAt the office none of Connor's associates greeted him. They didn't even\nhave to contrast the new tension in his face with the easy-going,\nflannelled contentment of their fellows. Undoubtedly somebody had tried\nto reach him or Rhoda and heard the Suspension Notice on their severed\nthought-lines.\n\nAs was also to be expected, there was a notice on his desk that his\nexecutive services would no longer be needed.\n\nHe quickly gathered up his personal things and went downstairs, passing\nthrough the office workers pool. Miss Wilson, his Suspended secretary,\ncame up to him. She looked saddened yet, curiously, almost triumphant\ntoo. \"We all heard the bad news this morning,\" she said, her blue eyes\nnever wavering. \"We want you to know how sorry we are since you're not\naccustomed--\"\n\n\"I'll never be accustomed to it,\" he said bitterly.\n\n\"No, Mr. Newman, you mustn't think that way. Human beings can get\naccustomed to whatever's necessary.\"\n\n\"Necessary? Not in my books!\"\n\n\"Some day you may feel differently. I was born into a Suspended family\nand we've managed. Being on the outside has its compensations.\"\n\n\"Such as?\"\n\n\"We-l-l--,\" she faltered, \"I really don't know exactly. But you must\nhave faith it will be so.\" She pulled out a card from a pocket of her\nsheath dress. \"Maybe you'll want to use this some day.\"\n\nHe glanced at the card which said, _John Newbridge, Doctor at Mind, 96th\nLevel, Harker Building, Appointments by Writing Only_. There was no\nthought-line coding.\n\n\"I have no doubt,\" he muttered. But she was starting to look hurt so he\ncarefully slid the card into his wallet.\n\n\"He's very helpful,\" she said. \"I mean, helpful for people who have\nadjustment problems.\"\n\n\"You're a good girl,\" he said huskily. \"Maybe we'll meet someday again.\nI'll have my wife call--write to you so you can visit us before we have\nto come into the city.\"\n\n\"That,\" she smiled happily, \"would be so wonderful, Mr. Newman. I've\nnever been in a home like that.\" Then, choking with emotion, she turned\nand hurried away.\n\n       *       *       *\n\nWhen he reached home and told Rhoda what had happened, his wife was not\nin the least bit moved. \"I'll never let that girl in my house,\" she said\nthrough thin lips. \"A classless nothing! I'm going to keep my pride\nwhile I can.\"\n\nThere was some sense to her viewpoint but, he felt uncertainly, not\nenough for him to remain silent. \"We have to adjust, darling, can't go\non thinking we're what we're not.\"\n\n\"Why can't we?\" she exploded. \"I couldn't even order food today. Max had\nto go to the AutoMart and pick it up!\"\n\n\"What are you trying to say?\"\n\n\"That _you_ made this mess!\"\n\nFor a while he listened, dully unresponsive, but eventually the\nvituperation became too bitter and he came back at her with equal vigor.\nUntil, weeping, she rushed upstairs once more.\n\nThat was the first of many arguments. Anything could bring them on,\ninstructions for Max that she chose to consider erroneous, a biting\nstatement from him that she was deliberately making herself physically\nunattractive. More and more Rhoda took to going into the city while he\nkilled time making crude, tentative adjustments on Max. What the devil,\nhe occasionally wondered, could she be doing there?\n\nBut most of the time he did not bother about it; he had found a\nconsolation of his own. At first it had been impossible to make the\nslightest changes in Max, even those that permitted the robot to remain\nconscious and give advice. Again and again his mind strained toward\nCentral until the icy-edged truth cut into his brain--there was no line.\n\nOut of boredom, though, he plugged away, walked past the\ndisdainfully-staring eyes of neighbors to the village library, and\nwithdrew dusty microfiles on robotry. Eventually he had acquired a\nlittle skill at contemplating what, essentially, remained a mystery to\nhis easily-tired mind. It was not completely satisfactory but it would\nbe enough to get him a better-than-average menial job when he had\nfinally accepted his new condition.\n\nAt long last a letter came from Ted on Mars. It said:\n\n    Guilty by association, that's what I am! When it first happened I\n    was furious with the two of you but resignation has its own\n    consolations and I've given up the ranting. Of course, I've lost my\n    job and my new one will keep me from Earth a longer time but the\n    real loss is not being able to think on Earth Central once a day. As\n    you know, it's a funny civilization here anyway. As yet, there's no\n    local telepathic Central but all Active Communicators are permitted\n    to think in on Earth Central once a day--except for the big shots\n    who can even telepath social engagements to each other by way of\n    Earth! Privileged but a pretty dull crowd anyway.\n\n    Oh yes, another exception to the general ration, Suspendeds like me.\n    Funny thing about that, seems to me there are more Suspended from\n    the Earth System all the time. Maybe I'm imagining it.\n\n    As lovingly as ever, your son, Ted. (NO. _More_ than ever!)\n\nRhoda really went to pieces for a while after that letter but, oddly\nenough, all recriminations soon stopped. She began going into the city\nevery day and after each visit seemed a little calmer for having done\nso.\n\n       *       *       *\n\nFinally Connor could no longer remain silent about it. But by now all\nconversations had to be broached by tactful beating around the bush so\nhe began by saying he had decided to take a lower level job in the\nmetropolis.\n\nRhoda was not surprised. \"I know. A good idea but I think you should\nwait a while longer and do something else first.\"\n\nThat made him suspicious. \"Are you developing a new kind of unblockable\nESP? How'd you know?\"\n\n\"No,\" she laughed. \"Some day we will maybe and people will use it better\nthis time. But right now I'm just going by what I see. You've been\nstudying Max and I knew you were bound to get restless.\" She became\nthoughtful. \"What you really want to know, though, is what I've been\ndoing in the city. Well, at first I did very little. I kept ending up in\ntheatres where we Suspendeds can go. That gave a little relief. But\nsince Ted's letter it's been different. I finally got up the courage to\nsee Dr. Newbridge.\"\n\n\"Newbridge!\"\n\n\"Connor, he's a great man. You should see him too.\"\n\n\"My mind may have smaller scope outside the System but what's left of it\nisn't cracking, Rhoda.\" Working himself into a spasm of righteous rage,\nhe stalked out into the garden and tried to convince himself he was\ncalmly studying the rose bushes' growth. But Sheila and Tony Williams\ncame down the lane that skirted the garden and, as their eyes moved\nhaughtily past him, his rage shifted its focus. He came back into the\nhouse and remained in sullen silence.\n\nRhoda went on as if there had been no interruption. \"I still say Dr.\nNewbridge is a great man. He dropped out of the System of his own free\nwill and that certainly took courage!\"\n\n\"He willingly gave up his advantages and privileges?\"\n\n\"Yes. And he's explained why to me. He felt it was destroying every\nSubscriber's ability to think and that it could not last. Some day we\nwould be without anything to do our thinking and he wanted out.\"\n\nConnor sat down and stared thoughtfully out the window. Max had just\nlumbered into the garden and, having unscrewed one hand to replace it\nwith a flexible spade, was starting on the evening schedule for turning\nover the soil at the base of the plants. He would go methodically down\none flower bed, then up the next one, until all had been worked over,\nthen would start all over again unless ordered to stop. \"Are we to end\nup the same way?\" Connor shuddered. He slapped his knee. \"All right,\nI'll go with you tomorrow. I've got to see what he's like--a man who'd\nvoluntarily surrender ninety percent of his powers!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe next morning they rode into the city together and went to the Harker\nBuilding. It was in an area dense with non-telepaths each one showing\nthat telltale cleft of anxiety in his forehead but briskly going about\nhis business as if anxiety were actually a liveable quality. Newbridge\nhad the same look but there was a nonetheless reassuring ease to the way\nhe greeted them. He was tall and white-haired and his face frequently\nassumed an abstracted look as if his mind were reaching far away.\n\n\"You've come here,\" he said, \"for two reasons. The first is\ndissatisfaction with your life. More precisely, you're dissatisfied with\nyour attitude toward life but you wouldn't be willing to put it that\nway, not yet. Secondly, you want to know why anyone would willingly\nleave the System.\"\n\nConnor leaned back in his chair. \"That'll do for a starter.\"\n\n\"Right. Well, there aren't many anomalies like me but we do exist. Most\npeople outside the System are there because they've been Suspended for\nsupposed infractions, or they've been put out through guilt by\nassociation, or because they were born into a family already in that\ncondition. Nothing like that happened to me. From early childhood I was\ntrained by parents and teachers to discipline the projective potential\nof my mind into the System. Like every other paraNormal, I received my\neducation by tapping Central for contact with information centers and\nother minds. But I was a fluke.\" His dark blue eyes twinkled.\n\"Biological units are never so standardized that _all_ of them fall\nunder any system that can be devised. I functioned in this System, true,\nbut I could imagine my mind existing outside, could see my functioning\n_from the outside_. This is terribly rare--most people are limited to\nthe functions which sustain them. They experience nothing else except\nwhen circumstances force them to. I, though, could see the System was\nnot all-powerful.\"\n\n\"Not all-powerful!\" Connor exploded. \"It got rid of me awfully easily.\"\n\nHis wife tried to calm him. \"Listen, dear, then decide.\"\n\n\"You're surviving as a pariah, Mr. Newman, aren't you? Your wife tells\nme you've even started to study robot controls, valuable knowledge for\nthe future and personally satisfying now. Millions of people do survive\nas outsiders, as do the planetary colonists who only have limited access\nso far to social telepathy. The System has built into it defenses\nagainst Subscribers who lack confidence in it--if it didn't it would\ncollapse. But people _in_ the System are not forced to remain there.\nThey can _will_ themselves out any time they close their minds to it, as\nI did. But they don't want to will themselves out of it--you certainly\ndidn't--and their comfortable inertia keeps everything going. I think\nyou have to know a little about its history, a history which never would\nhave interested you if you were still comfortably inside it.\"\n\nHe slowly outlined the way it had developed. First those uncertain steps\ntoward understanding the universally latent powers of telepathy, then\ngrowing chaos as each individual spent most of his time fighting off\nunwanted messages. After a period of desperate discomfort a few great\nminds, made superhuman by their ability to tap each others' resources,\nhad devised the Central System Switchboard. Only living units,\ndelicately poised between rigid order and sheer chaos, could receive\nmental messages but this problem had been solved by the molecular\nbiologists with their synthesized, self-replicating axons, vastly\nelongated and cunningly intertwined by the billions. These responded to\nevery properly-modulated thought wave passing through them and made the\nsame careful sortings as a human cell absorbing matter from the world.\nThen, to make certain this central mind would never become chaotic,\nthere was programmed into it an automatic rejection of all sceptical\nchallenges.\n\n\"That was the highest moment of our race,\" Newbridge sighed. \"We had\nharnessed infinite complexities to our needs. But the success was too\ncomplete. Ever since then humanity has become more and more dependent on\nwhat was to be essentially a tool and nothing more. Each generation\nbecame lazier and there's no one alive who can keep this Central System\nin proper working order.\" He leaned forward to emphasize his point. \"You\nsee, it's very slowly breaking down. There's a steady accretion of\ninefficiency mutations in the axons and that's why more and more\nswitching mistakes are being made--as in your case.\"\n\n       *       *       *\n\nConnor was dazed by it all. \"What's going to be the upshot, I mean,\n_how_ is it going to break down?\"\n\nNewbridge threw up his hands. \"I don't know--it's probably a long way\noff anyway. I guess the most likely thing is that more and more errors\nwill accumulate and plenty of people will be Suspended just because\nCentral is developing irrational quirks. Maybe the critical social mass\nfor change will exist only when more are outside the System than inside.\nI suspect when that happens we'll be able to return to _direct_\ntelepathic contact. As things are, our projection attempts are always\nblocked.\" A buzzing sound came out of a small black box on the doctor's\ndesk, startling Connor who in his executive days had received all such\nsignals directly in his head. \"Well, I've another patient waiting so\nthis will have to be the end of our chat.\"\n\nConnor and his wife exchanged glances. He said, \"I'd like to come back.\nI'll probably have a twenty-hour week so I'll be in town a few days a\nweek.\"\n\n\"More than welcome to come again,\" Newbridge grinned. \"Just make the\narrangements with Miss Richards, my nurse.\"\n\nWhen they were in the street Rhoda asked, \"Well, what do you think now?\"\n\n\"I don't know what to think yet--but I do feel better. Rhoda, would you\nmind going home alone? I think I'll find a job right away.\"\n\n\"Mind?\" she laughed. \"It's wonderful news!\"\n\nAfter he left her he wandered around the city awhile. In his paraNormal\ndays he had never noticed them but it certainly was true that there were\na lot of Suspendeds about. He studied some of them as he went along,\ntrying to fathom their likes and dislikes by the way they moved and\ntheir expressions. But, unlike the paraNormals, each was different and\nit was impossible to see deeply into them.\n\nThen, as he rounded a corner, he was suddenly face to face with his new\nenemy. A large flat park stood before him and there in the middle was a\nhundred-story tower of smooth seamless material, the home of the Central\nSystem's brain. There were smaller towers at many points in the world\nbut this was the most important, capable of receiving on its mile-long\naxons, antennas of the very soul itself, every thought projected at it\nfrom any point in the solar system. The housing gleamed blindingly in\nthe sun of high noon, as perfect as the day it had been completed. That\nsurface was designed to repel all but the most unusual of the radiation\nbarrages that could bring on subtle changes in the brain within. The\nbreakdown, he thought bitterly, would take too many centuries to\nconsider.\n\nHe turned away and headed into an Employment Exchange. The man behind\nthe desk there was a Suspended, too, and showed himself to be\nsympathetically understanding as soon as he studied the application\nform. \"ParaNormal until a few months ago,\" he nodded. \"Tough change to\nmake, I guess.\"\n\nConnor managed a little grin. \"Maybe I'll be grateful it happened some\nday.\"\n\n\"A curious thought, to say the least.\" He glanced down the application\nagain. \"Always some kind of work available although there do seem to be\nmore Suspendeds all the time. Robot repair--that's good! Always a\nshortage there.\"\n\nSo Connor went to work in a large building downtown along with several\nhundred other men whose principal duty was overseeing the repair of\nrobot servitors by other servitors and rectifying any minor errors that\npersisted. He was pleased to find that, while some of his fellow workmen\nknew much more about the work than he did, there were as many who knew\nless. But the most pleasing thing of all was the way they cooperated\nwith one another. They could not reach directly into each other's minds\nbut the very denial of this power gave them a sense of common need.\n\n       *       *       *\n\nHe visited Newbridge once a week and that, too, proved increasingly\nhelpful. As time went on, he found he was spending less of it regretting\nwhat he had lost. But once in a while a paraNormal came through the\nworkshop, eyes moving past the Suspendeds as if they did not exist and\nthe old resentment would return in all its bitterness. And when he\nhimself did not feel this way he could still sense it in men around him.\n\n\"Perfectly natural way to feel,\" Rhoda said, \"not that it serves any\npurpose.\"\n\n\"It's paraNormal lack of reaction,\" he tried to explain, \"that's what\nreally bothers me. They don't even bother to notice our hatred because\nwe have the strength of insects next to theirs. They can all draw on\neach others' resources and that totals to infinitely more than any of us\nhave, even if as individuals they're so much less. The perfect form of\nsecurity.\"\n\nBut for a moment one day that security seemed to be collapsing. Above\nthe work floor in Connor's factory there was a gallery of small but\nluxurious offices in which the executive staff of paraNormals 'worked.'\nNone of them came in more than two days a week but use of these offices\nwas rotated among them so all were ordinarily occupied and workers,\ngoing upstairs to the stock depot, could see paraNormals in various\nstages of relaxation. Usually the paraNormal kept his feet on a desk\nrest and, eyes closed, contemplated incoming entertainment. On rarer\noccasions he would be leaning over a document on the desk as his mind\nreceived the proper decision from Central.\n\nThis particular morning Connor was feeling bitterly envious as he went\nby the offices. He had already seen seven smugly-similar faces when he\ncame by Room Eight. Suddenly the face of its occupant contorted in\nagony, then the man got up and paced about as if in a trap. Deciding he\nhad seen more than was good for him, Connor hurried on. But the man in\nNine was acting out the same curious drama. He quickly retraced his\nsteps, passing one scene of consternation after another, and went back\ndown to the work floor, wondering what it all meant.\n\nSoon everybody knew something extraordinary was afoot as all the\nparaNormals swarmed noisily onto the runway overlooking the floor. They\nwere shouting wordless sounds at each other, floundering about as they\ndid so. Then, with equal suddenness, everything was calm again and,\nfaces more relaxed, they went back into their offices.\n\nThat evening Connor heard the same story everywhere--for ten minutes all\nparaNormals had gone berserk. On the monorail he noticed that, though\nstill more relaxed than their unwelcome fellows, they no longer exuded\nthat grating _absolute_ sense of security. No doubt about it--for a few\nminutes something had gone wrong, completely wrong, with the Central\nSystem. \"I don't like it,\" Rhoda said. \"Let's see Dr. Newbridge\ntomorrow.\"\n\n\"I'll bet it's a good sign.\"\n\nNewbridge, though, was also worried when they got to see him. \"They're\nlosing some of their self-confidence,\" he said, \"and that means they're\ngoing to start noticing us. Figure it out, Newman, about one-third the\npopulation of Earth--nobody can get exact figures--is outside the\nSystem. The paraNormals will want to reduce our numbers if more\nbreakdowns take place. I'll have to go into hiding soon.\"\n\n\"But why you of all people?\" Connor protested.\n\n\"Because I and a few thousand others like me represent not only an\nalternative way of life--all Suspendeds do that--but we possess more\nintensive knowledge for rehabilitating society after Central's collapse.\nThat collapse may come much sooner than we've been expecting. When it\ndoes we're going to have enormous hordes of paras milling around,\nhelplessly waiting to learn how to think for themselves again. Well,\nwhen we finally reach the telepath stage next time we'll have to manage\nit better.\" He took out an envelope. \"If anything happens to me, this\ncontains the names of some people you're to contact.\"\n\n\"Why don't you come to our place now?\" asked Rhoda. \"We'll still be able\nto hold it for a few more months.\"\n\n\"Can't go yet, too many things to clear up. But maybe later.\" He rose\nand extended his hand to them. \"Anyway it's a kind--and brave--offer.\"\n\n\"Sounds overly melodramatic to me,\" Connor said when they were outside.\n\"Who'd want to harm a psychiatric worker with no knowledge except what's\nin his head and his personal library?\"\n\n       *       *       *\n\nBut he stopped harping on the point when they reached the monorail\nstation. Three Suspendeds, obviously better educated than most, were\nbeing led away by a large group of paraNormals. The paraNormals had\ntheir smug expressions back but there was a strange gleam of\ndetermination in their eyes. \"Sometimes life itself gets overly\nmelodramatic,\" Rhoda said nervously.\n\nThe possible fate of these arrested men haunted him all the way home as\ndid the hostile stares of the people in the monorail car. At home,\nthough, there was the momentary consolation of a pair of letters from\nthe boys. There was little information in them but they did at least\nconvey in every line love for their parents.\n\nBut even this consolation did not last long. Why, Connor muttered to\nhimself, did they have to wait for letters when telephone and radio\nsystems could have eased their loneliness so much more effectively?\nBecause the paras did not need such systems and their needs were the\nonly ones that mattered! His fingers itched to achieve something more\nsubstantial than the work, now childishly routine, that he was doing at\nthe factory. Just from studying Max he knew he could devise such\nworkable communication systems. But all that was idle daydreaming--it\nwouldn't be in his lifetime.\n\nThe next morning Rhoda insisted they go back into the city to try once\nmore to persuade Newbridge to leave. When they arrived at the Harker\nBuilding it seemed strangely quiet. The few people who were about kept\navoiding each others' glances and they found themselves alone in the\nelevator to the 96th level. But Miss Richards, the doctor's\nnurse-secretary, was standing in the corridor as they got out. She was\ntrembling and found it difficult to talk. \"Don't--don't go in,\" she\nstuttered. \"No help now.\"\n\nHe pushed past her, took one glance at the fire-charred consulting room\nwhere a few blackened splinters of bone remained and turned away,\nleading the two women to the elevator. At first Miss Richards did not\nwant to go but he forced her to come along. \"You have to get away from\nhere--can't do any good for him now.\"\n\nShe sucked in air desperately, blinked back her tears and nodded. \"There\nwas another ten-minute breakdown this morning. A lot of paraNormals\npanicked and a vigilante pack came here to fire-blast the Doctor. They\nsaid I'd be next if things got any worse.\"\n\nConnor pinched his forehead to hold back his own anguish, then pulled\nout a sheet of paper. \"Dr. Newbridge was afraid of something like this.\nHe gave me a list of names.\"\n\n\"I know, Mr. Newman, I know them by heart.\"\n\n\"Shouldn't we try to contact one of them?\"\n\nAs they came out into the street, she stopped and thought a moment.\n\"Crane would be the easiest to reach. He's an untitled psychiatrist and\none of the alternate leaders for the underground.\"\n\n\"Underground?\"\n\n\"Oh, they tried to be prepared for every eventual--\"\n\n\"It's impossible!\" Rhoda broke in. She had been looking up and down the\ngreat avenue as they talked. \"There isn't one person in the street, not\none!\"\n\nAn abandoned robot cab stood at the curb and he threw open the door.\n\"Come on, get in! Something's happening. Miss Richards, set it for this\nCrane's address.\"\n\nThe cab started to shoot uptown, turning a corner into another deserted\nboulevard. As it skirted the great Park, he pointed at Central Tower.\nThere seemed to be a slight crack in the smooth surface half way up but,\nas a moment's mist engulfed the tower, it looked flawless again. Then\nall the mist was gone and the crack was back, a little larger than\nbefore.\n\n       *       *       *\n\nConnor leaned forward and set the cab for top speed as they rounded into\nthe straight-away of another uptown street. Occasionally they caught\nglimpses of frightened faces, clumped in lobby entrances, and once two\nbodies came flying out of a window far ahead. \"They're killing our\npeople everywhere,\" moaned the nurse.\n\nAs they approached the crushed forms, Connor slowed down a little.\n\"They're dressed too well--what's left of them. They're paraNormals!\"\n\nA minute later they were at the large apartment block where Crane lived.\nThey entered the building through a lobby jammed with more silent\npeople. All were Suspendeds.\n\nAt first Crane did not want to let the trio in but when he recognized\nNewbridge's nurse he unlocked the heavily-bolted door. He was a\nmassively-built man with dark eyes set deeply beneath a jutting brow and\nthe eyes did not blink as Miss Richards told him what had happened.\n\"We'll miss him,\" he said, then turned abruptly on Connor. \"Have you any\nskills?\"\n\n\"Robotics,\" he answered.\n\nThe great head nodded as Connor told of his experience at work and on\nMax. \"Good, we're going to need people like you for rebuilding.\" He\npulled a radio sender and receiver from a cabinet and held an earphone\nclose to his temple, continuing to nod. Then he put it down again. \"I\nknow what you're going to say--illegal, won't work and all that. Well, a\nfew of us have been waiting for the chance to build our own\ncommunication web and now we can do it.\"\n\n\"I just want to know why you keep mentioning _our_ rebuilding. They're\nmore likely to destroy all of us in their present mood.\"\n\n\"_Us?_\" He took them to the window and pointed toward the harbor where\nthousands of black specks were tumbling into the water. \"They're\ndestroying themselves! Some jumping from buildings but most pouring\ntoward the sea, a kind of oceanic urge to escape completely from\nthemselves, to bury themselves in something infinitely bigger than their\nseparate hollow beings. Before they were more like contented robots. Now\nthey're more like suicidal lemmings because they can't exist without\nthis common brain to which they've given so little and from which\nthey've taken so much.\"\n\nConnor squared his shoulders. \"We'll have our work cut out for us. Dr.\nNewbridge saw it all coming, you did too.\"\n\n\"Not quite,\" Crane sighed. \"We assumed that at the time of complete\nbreakdown the System would open up, throwing all the Subscribers out of\nit, leaving them disconnected from each other and waiting for our help.\nBut it worked out in just the opposite manner!\"\n\n\"You mean that the System is staying closed as it breaks down? Like a\ntelephone exchange in which all the lines remained connected and every\ncall went to all telephones.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" Crane replied.\n\n\"I don't understand this technical talk,\" Rhoda protested, watching in\nhypnotized horror as the speck swarm swelled ever larger in the sea.\n\n\"I'll put it this way,\" Crane explained. \"Their only hope was to have\ntime to develop the desire for release from the System as it died. But\nthey are dying _inside_ it. You see, Mrs. Newman, every thought in every\nparaNormal's head, every notion, every image, no matter how stupidly\ntrivial, is now pouring into every other paraNormal's head. They're\nover-communicating to the point where there's nothing left to\ncommunicate but death itself!\"\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ January 1963.\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
