Extensive research did not uncover any\nevidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n\n[Sidenote: There was a reason why his scripts were smash hits--they had\nrealism. And why not? He was reliving every scene and emotion in them!]\n\n\nIt was really a pretty fair script, and it caught me at a moment when\nevery playwright worth his salt was playing in France, prostituting in\nHollywood or sulking in a slump. I needed a play badly, so I told Ellie\nto get this unknown up to my office and have a contract ready.\n\nWhen she announced him on the inter-com, my door banged open and a\nyoungster in blue-jeans, sweatshirt and a stubbly crew-cut popped in\nlike a carelessly aimed champagne cork.\n\nI said, \"I'm sorry, son, but I have an interview right now. Besides we\naren't casting yet. Come back in a couple of weeks.\"\n\nHis grin never faltered, being of the more durable kind that you find on\nfarms and west of the Rockies. His ragged sneakers padded across my\nPersian, and I thought he was going to spring over my desk like a losing\ntennis player.\n\n\"I'm your interview,\" he announced. \"At least I'm Hillary Hardy, and\nyour girl just told me you'd see me.\"\n\n\"You--are Hillary Hardy?\"\n\n\"In the morbid flesh,\" he said jamming out five enthusiastic fingers\nthat gulped my hand and jack-hammered until I broke his grip with a\nRed-Cross life-saving hold.\n\n\"Spare the meat,\" I groaned. \"I have to sign the contract, too.\"\n\n\"I did it! I did it! They said I was crazy, but I did it the first\ntime.\"\n\n\"Did what?\"\n\n\"Sold the first play I wrote.\"\n\n\"This--is--your first work?\"\n\n\"My very first,\" he said, splitting his freckles with a double row of\nwhite teeth a yard wide. \"They said I'd have to go to college, and then\nI'd have to write a million words before I'd produce anything\nworthwhile.\"\n\nIf he hadn't owned such an honest, open face I'd have thrown him out as\nan imposter right then. The ream of neatly typed pages on my desk would\nhave fooled any agent, editor or producer like myself, on Broadway. The\nformat was professional, the plot carefully constructed, the dialogue\nbreezy as a May afternoon in Chicago and the motivation solidly adult.\n\n\"How old are you?\" I asked.\n\n\"Nineteen.\"\n\n\"And you'll sign an affidavit that you wrote this play, and it's an\noriginal work?\"\n\n\"Certainly!\" The smile faded a little. \"Look, Mr. Crocker, you're not\njust kidding about this contract, are you? Is the play really okay?\"\n\n\"That,\" I said trying to restrain my own enthusiasm, \"is only determined\non the boards. But I'm willing to risk a thousand-dollar advance on your\nsignature to this.\" I shoved the papers at him with my fountain pen on\ntop.\n\nHe didn't uncap the pen until he had read the whole thing, and while he\npored over the fine print I had time to catch my breath.\n\nHis play competed rather well with the high average output of most\nprofessionals I knew--not exactly terrific, but a relatively safe\ngamble, as gambles go on the street of bright lights. Well, I made a\nmental note to pass the script around a bit before I signed the contract\nmyself. After all, he might have cribbed the whole thing somewhere.\n\nHe finished reading, signed the contract and handed it back to me with\nan air of expectancy. I stalled, \"I, uh, will have the check for you in\na few days. Meanwhile, you'd better get yourself an agent and an\nattorney and fix up that affidavit of authorship. Normally, I don't deal\nwith free-lance playwrights, you see.\"\n\n\"But I don't need any agent,\" he protested. \"You be my agent, Mr.\nCrocker--\" He was studying my reaction, and after a moment he said, \"You\nstill don't quite believe that I wrote _Updraft_, do you, sir? Now that\nyou've met me you want more time to check up, don't you?\"\n\nI said, \"Frankly, yes, Hardy. _Updraft_ is a mature piece of writing,\nand unless you are a genius--well, it's just business son.\"\n\n\"I don't blame you,\" he said smiling that fresh-air smile. \"And I'll\nadmit I'm no genius, but I can explain everything. You see, I've read 38\nbooks on how to write plays--\"\n\n\"Tut!\" I said. \"Format technique is just a fraction of producing an\nappealing play.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" he admitted. \"But _I've memorized all 38 books_. What's more,\nI've been reading and memorizing plays, novels, poetry and history since\nI was 13. I have a storehouse of--\"\n\n\"Memorizing?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. I'm a student of _mnemonics_, you know, the art of memory\nperfection. My real ambition is to develop absolute recall. All my\nreading and memorizing have been just exercises to expand my power of\ncomplete recall.\"\n\n\"You mean that playwriting is just a hobby?\"\n\n\"Not--exactly. I need money, lots of it, to continue my research.\nPsychiatrists come high.\"\n\nWell, I suppose good plays have been written for screwier reasons, and I\nwas in no mood to look a gift-author in the mouth. I did pass _Updraft_\naround to a brace of critics, and none of them could hang a plagiarism\ncharge on Hardy. So I wrote out his check and started the wheels going\non the production.\n\nThe boy prodigy dropped out of sight for the time being, taking no\nfurther interest in his brain-child. _Updraft_ did all right in the\nsticks, but it was when we opened on Broadway that it began to coin\nmoney.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn ten performances we were playing to capacity crowds, and within a\nmonth we had to take in the S. R. O. sign. A lucky hit? I thought so at\nthe time. _Updraft_ had a dash of humor, a bit of adventure, a dollop of\nromance and a gentle little heart tug at the conclusion, but damned if\nthe critics could put their fingers on its money-making essence. They\ngave it pleasant little reviews and mild compliments, but no more. The\ncash customers, however, came and kept coming and _kept coming_!\n\nThe morning after the 100th performance I told Ellie to hunt up Hardy\nand see what he was doing about another play. I could stand to have\nanother hit ready when _Updraft_ petered out.\n\nThat afternoon my secretary reported, \"He's in a sanitarium over in\nHoboken.\"\n\n\"Nuts! I knew we should have held back on his royalties,\" I exclaimed.\n\"I suppose he's drunk himself into a--\"\n\n\"It's a mental hospital,\" Ellie said, \"but Mr. Hardy told me he is just\nthere for some experimental psycho-therapy. He sounded quite normal and\ncheerful.\"\n\nHillary Hardy showed up next morning at my request, and he did, indeed,\nappear in good spirits. I demanded, \"What's this business of locking\nyourself up in a looney-bin? Don't you realize that's bad public\nrelations?\"\n\nHe chuckled. \"I thought of that. So I'm going under an assumed name.\nYour girl said you had something very important to tell me.\"\n\n\"Sure. I want another play,\" I told him. \"_Updraft_ won't run forever,\nyou know.\"\n\n\"Oh, I have plenty of money now, so I won't have to bother. The people\nat the sanitarium have become interested in my project, and all I'm\nspending is board and room there. Thanks to your royalty checks I've got\nquite a pile in the bank.\"\n\n\"Won't have to bother?\" I yelled. \"Here I launch you on Broadway, and\nthat's all the gratitude I get. Now's the time to cash in on the\nreputation of your first play. It's setting attendance records.\"\n\n\"Sorry, Mr. Crocker,\" he said. \"I'm in a critical stage of my\nexperiments. I just can't afford the time at the moment.\"\n\n\"Experiments! Experiments! What is this business?\"\n\nHe brightened. \"Would you believe it? I've contacted memories back to\nthree months after my birth. And at this rate I'll reach birth itself\nwithin a few weeks.\"\n\nI shuddered. What a nasty ambition! \"What's the percentage?\"\n\n\"You don't understand,\" he said warming to his subject. \"The further\nback I go the more nearly I approach total recall. At present I can\ncontact any memory in my experience back to six months, day by day,\nminute by minute. I can run off these memories like colored movies,\nrecalling every sight, sound, smell, feel and taste.\"\n\n\"So what happened earlier than six months that's so important?\"\n\n\"Probably nothing of great interest,\" Hardy granted, \"but the further\nback I go, the more intense is the reality of all my memories. For\ninstance, right now I can return to the day, hour, minute and second I\nwent to school for the first time. I can remember the look on the\nteacher's face and hear the screams of twenty-six kindergarten kids. I\ncan smell the freshly oiled floors and the newly painted walls. I can\nfeel the wart on my mother's finger, the one I was holding onto for dear\nlife.\"\n\nThe almost fanatic glow in his eager, young face impressed me. Realism\nof memory! Could that be the essence of his successful first play? Did\nhis down-to-earth touch account for _Updraft's_ surprising audience\nappeal?\n\nI pleaded, \"Don't let me down now, Hillary. I gambled thousands of\ndollars on your first play. If you can repeat we'll both enjoy an even\nbetter pay-off. Besides, have you looked into what your taxes will be?\"\n\n\"Taxes? No, I really haven't, but I'm sure I have enough to last another\nyear. Sorry, Mr. Crocker. Maybe later, but right at the moment--\"\n\nHis broad-shouldered, lean athletic form drifted through my door and was\ngone.\n\nTwo weeks later _Parodisiac_ arrived, typed on fools-cap, uncorrected,\nwith pencil notations and coffee-spots on it, but it was by-lined,\n\"Hillary Hardy,\" and after a single, quick scanning I was overjoyed to\npay the expense of transcribing it to more durable paper. The play was\npowerful, witty and emotion-stirring. It was a work of art.\n\nAnd on the last page was scribbled in the border: \"I looked into my tax\nbill, and found you were right. I'm almost broke after Uncle Sam takes\nhis cut, so here is the play you asked for. Hope you like it. (signed)\nH. H.\"\n\nThere was a P.S. \"Expect to hit _birth_ this week.\"\n\nWhen I phoned him at the sanitarium, asking for Sam Buckle, the name he\nhad left originally with Ellie, he refused to come to the phone. So I\nwired him. \"Quit worrying about taxes. I accept your earlier offer to be\nyour agent as well as producer. Good luck on your experiments.\"\n\n_Parodisiac_ was much too good to hold for the closing of _Updraft_.\nIndeed, the first play was showing no signs of weakening, so I began\nrounding up talent outside the original cast. This was a cinch. Meredith\nCrawley finished Act I, Scene I, and accepted the male lead without\nturning another page. So did Alicia Pennington, even though it meant\ngiving up a personal appearance tour to publicize her latest Hollywood\nrelease that was supposed to win her an Oscar.\n\nNot that I had to go after talent like this to put _Parodisiac_ across.\nIt was so potent I believe I could have made it a hit with a cast out of\na burleycue revue.\n\nThe season was getting late, so I did the unthinkable. I cut normal\nrehearsal time in half and slammed it at the big town without even a\ntrial run in the back-country. Nobody connected with the show\nobjected--not even Hec Blankenship, my publicity manager. In fact it was\nhe who suggested the sleeper treatment.\n\nWith nothing more than last-minute newspaper notices we opened the\nbox-office to a completely uninformed public, and did it knock the\ncritics for a loop! Only a couple showed up for the first performance,\nalong with less than a third-full house of casual first-nighters.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPeople wandered out stunned. A substitute drama-critic from the _Times_\nlooked me up after the show, and there were tears of gratitude in his\neyes. \"My review of this play will establish my reputation,\" he told me.\n\"If the boss had had any notion of what you were pulling, he'd have been\nhere himself. But what about the author? I thought you were going to\nhave to call the police when you failed to produce the author.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt had been rough. The skimpy crowd had milled about for a half hour\nscreaming \"Author, author!\" Meanwhile, I was too choked up after the\nlast heart-wrenching scene to get up and make a speech.\n\nEverything had gone perfectly. Even the brief rehearsal time failed to\nleave any rough edges. Crawley and Pennington were so carried away with\ntheir parts that they easily doubled their considerable dramatic stature\nthat first performance. The supporting cast caught fire, too, and,\nwell--the likes of it is rarely seen anywhere.\n\nThe lines seemed to come out of the actors' hearts, not their mouths.\nCue-lines blended with the dialogue interplay, the artificiality of\nstage-sets, costumery and make-up disappeared, and the simple, yet\nprofound drama unreeled like a bolt of vividly printed silk, flowing\nsmoothly, strongly, absorbingly to the tragic-comical climax that left\nthe emotions reeling from the suspense and warm with relief.\n\nTwo days later I looked at the figures on advance ticket sales and could\nfind only one conceivable complaint. _Parodisiac_ would make Hillary\nHardy so much money that not even taxes could force him to produce\nanother for a great while.\n\nWhat promised to be a major irritation, fending off the press from Hardy\nand protecting his anonymity, was converted into a master\npublicity-stroke by Hec Blankenship. He swore the few of us who knew\nabout Hardy's youth and whereabouts, to complete secrecy, then he\nproceeded to build his publicity around the \"mystery-author.\"\n\n\"But he's got a past!\" I objected when Hec first presented the scheme.\n\"Old friends and relatives will spill the beans.\"\n\n\"Have you really looked into Hillary's past?\" Hec asked.\n\nI confessed I hadn't. Hec said that he had. It developed that Hillary\nHardy was not our boy's real name. In his passion for anonymity he had\nbeen changing his name every time he changed locations, which was often.\nHec had traced his background through three moves that brought the\nauthor across the country, but the trail petered out at a ranch in\nWyoming where Hillary had worked a month as a cow-hand.\n\nThe mystery-author gag worked. Inside of two weeks our promotion expense\ndwindled to almost nothing. Columnists were fighting for the privilege\nof pouring out free copy on both plays. Some of their speculations as to\nHardy's real identity were pretty fabulous--Winston Churchill, Noel\nCoward and even a certain, witty ex-presidential candidate for the\nDemocratic party--but no one found him out, and the advance sellout\nbegan gaining a week every day.\n\nNow, I have made and lost my share of theater fortunes, and I have\nlearned a certain caution. At the moment I was quite content to ride\nwith my two smash-hits and leave Hardy to his experiments. Strangely, it\nwas he who called upon me for action.\n\nA month after launching _Parodisiac_ he showed up at my office, looking\nleaner and more intense than ever. His crew-cut was growing out, but it\nwas from neglect rather than a sudden artistic temperament, I was sure.\n\nAfter locking the doors and cancelling my morning appointments, I said,\n\"Well, golden boy, what brings you to civilization?\"\n\nHis smile was still strong and warm, but it was no longer youthful.\nThere was a look of deep wisdom in his blue eyes that finally justified\nthe magnificent play he had written.\n\n\"Money,\" he answered briefly.\n\n\"Haven't my checks been reaching you?\" I asked in amazement.\n\n\"Oh, yes. Very gratifying,\" he said pacing a groove in the deep carpet\npile. \"But I'm moving into prenatal memory now, and I accomplished it by\nadministrations of a new B vitamin derivative. I have a staff of\nbiochemists working for me producing this substance, but it's fearfully\nexpensive. I need more of it, larger lab facilities to produce it\nsecretly. I want to buy the sanitarium.\"\n\n\"Buy the--\"\n\n\"Lock, stock and personnel,\" he nodded. \"I'm three months before birth,\nalready. My goal is conception.\"\n\nA big, brassy gong chimed in my brain. \"That sounds like this\n_dianetics_ business that was going the rounds awhile back.\"\n\nHardy nodded. \"In some respects, yes. But I have a single goal, total\nrecall, and I'm taking a more comprehensive approach. Psycho-therapy\nhelped a great deal, but I have traced-out every angle of mnemonics,\nimproved on most and invented some new ones. The final problem is one of\nimproving synaptic potentials and actual tissue tone in the brain.\nBiochemistry is giving me the answers. With enough of the new B vitamin\nderivative I'm confident I can reach conception--and a totality of\nrecall.\"\n\n\"But Hardy, what have you got when you get there? I still say, what's\nthe percentage?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe look he gave me was puzzled but completely tolerant. \"You raved to\nme about my last play, yet you don't see what I'm getting at?\" He\nstopped pacing and sat opposite me with his muscular hands knotted into\nfists on my desk.\n\n\"George,\" he said with quiet intentness, \"I will be the first man since\ncreation to have the full potential of his brain at his creative\ndisposal.\"\n\n\"How do you figure that?\"\n\n\"The brain has three principal functions. It can store information for\nrecall, it can analyze and correlate this information and finally it can\nsynthesize creatively. Now the latter two functions are inherently\ndependent upon the quality of the first, or memory recall. As a truly\nthinking animal, man considers he has reached some acme of perfection\nbecause his brain is so superior to the lower animals. Actually, the\nreal gulf is between what man _has achieved_ and what he _can achieve_\nwith his brain.\n\n\"The key lies in perfecting his recall. What good does it do to keep\npouring in information when most of us are forgetting old things almost\nas rapidly as we are learning new ones? Of course, we don't really ever\nforget anything, but our power of exact recall grows fuzzy through\ndisuse. Then when we need a certain name or factual bit of information\nwe can't quite dig it up, or it comes up in distorted approximations.\n\n\"The same holds for calling on experience to help us with new problems.\nWe may grasp the general lesson of experience, but most of the specific\nincidents of our lives are dulled in time. The lessons we paid dearly to\nlearn are largely useless. So we go on making the same mistakes, paying\nthe same penalties over and over again.\"\n\nI shrugged. \"Everybody would like a better memory, I suppose, but I've\nnever known anyone to go off the deep end over it like you have. What\nmore can you gain?\"\n\n\"Can't you visualize what it would be like to have even a short\nlife-time of knowledge and experience laid out in sharp detail of\nrecall? Think of the new associations of thoughts and concepts that\nwould be possible! Consider the potential for creating drama, alone!\nEvery word ever read or spoken, every emotion ever conveyed, every\ngesture of anger, love, jealousy, pain, pleasure--all this raw material\nglittering brightly, ready to pour out in new conflicts, dramatic\nsituations, sharp pungent dialogue--\"\n\nHe made me sense his enthusiasm, but I couldn't quite feel it. Would\nsuch a tremendous ability necessarily be good? Something about its\nimmensity frightened me, and I didn't care to consider it for my own use\nat all.\n\nI said, \"Don't get me wrong. If this is what's going into your\nplaywriting, I'm all for it. And what you do with your money is your own\nbusiness. What do you propose?\"\n\n\"Can you absorb more of my work?\" he asked abruptly.\n\n\"I'm your agent, aren't I? I'll peddle it if I can't use it myself,\" I\ntold him, not that I was so eager for the broker's 10% so much as I\nwanted to have the pick of his output for my own productions.\n\nI didn't know what I was taking on. He turned out his third play in just\nten days. _Ten days_, I said. I read to the bottom of page two and\ndecided to hell with peddling this one. I'd produce it myself.\n\nBefore I got into second gear on _Beach Boy_, however, Hillary sends a\nmessenger over with _Madame President_, a satire so sharp I knew it\nwould make _Call Me Madame_ look like _Little Women_.\n\nWhat do you do? There are just so many legitimate theaters in the city.\n\nWhile I'm pondering this and negotiating with a Hollywood agent to maybe\ntake _Beach Boy_ off my hands, along comes _Red Rice_, an epic novel of\nCommunist China that out-Bucked Pearl a hundred heart-wrenches to one.\n\nOne phone call sold that one to McMullin, and when they got a look at\nthe manuscript they raised the advance to $10,000. This was not bad for\na first novel, and I didn't resent my $1000 agent's fee.\n\nBefore the summer was over I was about ready to give up show business\nand become a one-author agent. Hillary was keeping four secretaries busy\ntaking dictation and transcribing. He never researched, never revised,\nnever even glanced at the copy. I've known some prolific writers, but\nnone could grind it out like Hillary Hardy.\n\nAnd it was good! Every piece was better than the last. His characters\nwere strictly 3-D right on paper, and word pictures! When he mentioned\nbedbugs, you itched and bled; when the villain slugged the hero a\nlow-blow, you felt it in your guts; and when boy got girl--brother, turn\nup the house-lights, quick.\n\nI got so involved trying to produce five plays at once, making dickers\nwith publishers and motion picture studios, fighting off television\npeople and answering mail demanding a chance at foreign rights, that it\nwas mid-November before I realized that it was over a month since I'd\nheard from the golden goose.\n\nIn fact Ellie drew my attention to it one morning. \"Hadn't you better\ncall the sanitarium?\" she suggested. \"Maybe he had a breakdown or\nsomething?\"\n\nThe thought chilled me. Not only had I sold Hillary's complete output to\ndate, but I had a file full of contracts for future novels and movie\nscripts worth a couple of million dollars.\n\nI didn't phone--I went. To Hoboken.\n\nIn the outskirts I found his private hospital, demanded to see Sam\nBuckle and was told to sit down and wait. He was in therapy.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTwo hours later they took me to him. He lay on a hospital bed in his\nshorts, staring at the ceiling and the sweat all over him like he had\njust stepped out of a showerbath.\n\n\"Hello, George,\" he said, still looking at the ceiling.\n\n\"Hi, kid! You sick or something?\"\n\nHe smiled a little. \"The surf at Monterey. The sun fading through the\nlow morning mist, a golden ghost peering through the somber veil--and\nJulia, beside me, clinging to my arm, crying softly--\"\n\n\"Hey, kid, I'm in New Jersey. Where are you?\" I said nervously.\n\nHe blinked. \"In California, George. Two years ago. I'm there. Do you\nunderstand? _I'm really there!_\"\n\nIt was a little embarrassing. I felt like an intruder on a beach picnic.\n\"Well, Hillary, that's just fine,\" I stammered. \"I suppose that means\nthat--that you've done what you set out to.\"\n\n\"That's right.\" He nodded slightly. \"Total recall, George. Every instant\nof my existence re-filed under 'urgent'. Every vision, every sound,\nevery sensation, laid clean and sharp like a sound film ready for\nrunning. I've done it, George.\"\n\n\"How long ago did you--\"\n\n\"Three weeks ago I began heavy dosing with the vitamin. Today--just this\nlast hour--I reached back into prenatal to the first instant of my\ncellular existence. And it was like ripping a curtain aside. I--I can't\nexactly tell you what it's like. Something like coming out of a black\ncellar into the noon-day sun. It's almost blinding.\"\n\nHe closed his eyes, squinting as though to shut out a glare. His blond\nhair had grown long, and it lay on the pillow like a woman's. He had\nlost some weight, and except for the heavy chest muscles and thick\nforearms, he had the appearance of a poet, a delicate soul dedicated to\nsome ephemeral plane out of this world.\n\nI figured I'd better provide a little ballast. \"Congratulations and all\nthat,\" I said, \"but what about your work?\"\n\n\"I'm done,\" he said quietly.\n\n\"Done? Are you forgetting that you bought a sanitarium?--some eight\nhundred grand worth? And it's only half paid for?\"\n\n\"Oh, that. The royalties will take care of the payments.\"\n\n\"Hillary, you keep forgetting about taxes.\"\n\n\"Then let them take it back by default. I'm through with it.\"\n\n\"Dammit,\" I said, \"I looked into this deal. People don't take back\nsanitariums like over-ripe bananas, especially when they got you on the\nhook for more than it's worth. They'll hold you to the contract. And you\ncan't get your equity out if you don't protect it by keeping up your\npayments. You have a wonderful start, and if you just fill the contracts\nI have on file now you can pay it off and have plenty left to retire on.\nBut right now you aren't so solvent, boy.\"\n\nWell, he finally came out of his trance long enough to agree to fulfill\nthe commitments I'd made for him, and I thought that once he got started\nthere would be no holding him.\n\nJust to make sure I did something on my own. I let his identity and\nwhereabouts leak out.\n\nIt was a sneaky thing to do to him, but I figured that once he got a\nreal taste of the fame that was waiting him he would never let go of it.\n\nThe papers splashed it: \"Mystery Genius Is Lad of 19!\"\n\nThey swamped him. They swarmed over him and plastered him with honorary\nliterary degrees, domestic and foreign. They Oscared him and Nobelled\nhim. They wined, dined and adored him into a godhead of the arts.\n\nThe acting, publishing, TV, radio and movie greats paid homage to his\ngenius by the most hysterical bidding for his talents their check-books\ncould support. I kept waiting for the Secretary of the Treasury to\npresent him with the key to Fort Knox.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMeanwhile, I waited patiently--having no choice, since I started the\npublicity nightmare myself--for the earthquake to settle down. As his\nagent I was holding off all new commitments until he fulfilled the ones\non hand.\n\nSix months passed, and Hillary was still wallowing in glory, too busy\nsopping up plaudits to bother turning a hand.\n\nFinally I sent a goon squad after him and dragged him to my office. He\narrived in a four-hundred dollar suit and a fifty-dollar tie. Each cuff\nwas decorated by a diamond link and a Hollywood starlet. I shooed out\nthe excess and came to the point.\n\n\"Recess is over,\" I said gently. \"Now we settle down for a few months of\npatty-cake with your secretaries. They're here in my offices now where I\ncan keep an eye on things. Okay?\"\n\nHe grinned his old happy smile, and some of the dewey glaze seemed to\npeel from his eyes. \"You're right, George,\" he said much to my surprise.\n\"I can't coast forever--and believe me, I never visualized what this\nwould be like. It's wonderful. The world is at my feet, George. At my\nfeet!\"\n\nI had pegged him right. But after all, who could resist the accolade he\nhad received? For all his monomania on this business of mnemonics, he\nwas a red-blooded boy with active glands and youthful corpuscles.\n\nTo my further delight he threw off his imported suit-coat and said, \"I'm\nready right now. Where do we start?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI broached the file and studied my priority list. \"First off, Oscar\nwants a play. That'll take a week or two, I suppose. Then I have an\nassignment for a serial--\"\n\nI outlined about three months work for him, or what would have been\nthree months work last summer.\n\nI moved him into my own penthouse apartment upstairs and herded him to\nwork the next morning. My squad of strong-arms guarded all entrances,\nand Hec Blankenship finally convinced the public that we meant business\nin getting a little privacy for our tame genius so he could hatch some\nmore immortal works.\n\nI had lunch sent in to him in the next office and didn't see him until\nfive that first evening. I went in without knocking. One secretary was\nfiling her nails, and the other three were putting on their coats. The\ncovers were still on the typewriters and Hillary was asleep or in a coma\nover in the corner.\n\nI kicked his feet off his desk, and he rocked forward. \"Come on\nupstairs, I'll buy you a steak,\" I said.\n\nHe smiled weakly, \"I need one. It didn't go so good.\" In the elevator he\nadded, \"In fact, it didn't go at all.\"\n\n\"Take it easy,\" I assured him. \"You're a little rusty, that's all. What\nabout the total recall? Is it still working?\"\n\nHe nodded, but he didn't say any more about it.\n\nNext day I stuck my head in before I went to lunch, and I congratulated\nmyself on not pushing him too hard the first day. Hillary was off in his\ncorner again, but his mouth was moving and all four girls were doing the\nthings that secretaries do when they are about two hours behind in their\nwork.\n\nEight days later the thing dropped on my desk. I wet a finger with keen\nanticipation, but the spit wasn't dry before I was plowing into\nHillary's office trailing loose sheets.\n\n\"Are you kidding?\" I yelled.\n\nHe was out of his chair over by the window staring out. All he did was\nhunch up his shoulders. The girls were standing around trying to act\ninvisible.\n\n\"Hillary,\" I said trying to laugh. \"Don't be playing gags on old George.\nWhere is it? Where's Oscar's play?\"\n\n\"I--I'm afraid that's it,\" he said without turning his head.\n\n\"This--this fluff? This pablum?\"\n\n\"Well--I thought I'd try something light to begin with.\"\n\n\"Light? This is no play. This is Pollyanna. It's been done. Where's your\nconflict? Your problem? Your suspense? Dammit, where's your characters?\"\n\n\"I'll get warmed up tomorrow,\" Hilliary said, but he didn't have much\nconviction in his voice.\n\nHe tried. He really did. I heard him thrashing around for a whole hour\nthe next morning. By afternoon he was on his way to the hospital in an\nambulance with two men holding him down.\n\nAll I could get out of the doctors was, \"complete nervous breakdown.\" I\nfinally found a hard-up intern and bribed him to spy for me. He reported\nthat Hillary had the whole staff stumped. He was acting more like a dope\naddict with withdrawal symptoms or a drunk with the D.T.'s.\n\nI got in touch with Hillary's sanitarium. The head psychiatrist was in\nEurope, so I cabled him and flew him back. He took over, and pretty soon\nI had the word I dreaded.\n\n\"Your wonder boy will recover,\" he told me, \"but that's a wonder in\nitself. I presume he told you of his experiments to achieve total\nrecall?\"\n\nI said yes.\n\n\"What he probably failed to tell you was that we all tried to dissuade\nhim.\"\n\n\"That he didn't mention, but I worried about it.\"\n\n\"Yes, well you might have. When Hillary Hardy succeeded in stripping\naway the last remnant of protective insulation in his memory he exposed\nhimself not only to its full factual content, but also he lay naked\nevery past emotional upset, every pain, fear, dread and sorrow he had\never experienced. It is no longer possible for him to recall an\nexperience and ponder it objectively. _He relives it._\"\n\n\"Yes, I get that,\" I said, \"but what's so--\"\n\n\"Did you ever hit your thumb with a hammer?\" the doctor with the\ntraditional, gray goatee interrupted.\n\n\"Sure, a couple of times.\"\n\n\"Ever lose a sweetheart or have a loved one die?\"\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"Suppose that to even think about such experiences you had to endure all\nthe actual physical or emotional pain of the original incident? The\ncrushing blow of the hammer? The heartache and tears of your loss? And\nsuppose further, that you were trying to write a play, and in order to\nbring genuine emotion to it you forced yourself to endure these pains\nand emotional stresses, minute after minute--\"\n\n\"God!\" I said. \"But you said he'd recover?\"\n\n\"In a few weeks, yes. Gradually we will reduce sedation until he can\ncontrol his memories again, but never ask him to write another dramatic\nwork. Another attack like this one could drive him irretrievably\ninsane.\"\n\nIt wasn't too hard to understand. After all, what is creative writing\nbut setting down little bits of yourself? And the demands of literature\nare for human problems, conflicts, struggles.\n\nYoung as he was, Hillary was no different from the rest of us. Sure, he\nwas full of reading and second hand bits of business, but he dug deeply\ninto his own private pot of pain for his genuine dramatic effects. And\nwhere others dig with a long-handled ladle, Hillary dipped with his bare\nsoul--and he got scalded.\n\nGetting him well and keeping him that way was a matter of putting the\nlid back on the pot, so to speak. Nobody ever invited him to write\nanother word. I saw to that. He's still with me, because after he went\nbankrupt on the sanitarium deal he had nowhere to turn. After taxes and\nthe rooking the real estate boys gave him, his royalties were tied up\nfor years to come.\n\nHe did get better, though. And he even works a little. Turns out scripts\nfor mild little comic books, the Honey-Bunney type that are approved by\nparent-teacher censors. They don't sell very well. No conflict. No guts.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Mind Digger, by Winston Marks\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE MIND DIGGER ***\n\n***** This file should be named 32353.txt or 32353.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/2/3/5/32353/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
