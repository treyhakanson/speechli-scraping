Jules Verne deserve to be made\nwidely known in English-speaking countries by means of carefully\nprepared translations. Witty and ingenious adaptations of the\nresearches and discoveries of modern science to the popular taste,\nwhich demands that these should be presented to ordinary readers in\nthe lighter form of cleverly mingled truth and fiction, these books\nwill assuredly be read with profit and delight, especially by English\nyouth. Certainly no writer before M. Jules Verne has been so happy in\nweaving together in judicious combination severe scientific truth\nwith a charming exercise of playful imagination.\n\nIceland, the starting point of the marvellous underground journey\nimagined in this volume, is invested at the present time with a\npainful interest in consequence of the disastrous eruptions last\nEaster Day, which covered with lava and ashes the poor and scanty\nvegetation upon which four thousand persons were partly dependent for\nthe means of subsistence. For a long time to come the natives of that\ninteresting island, who cleave to their desert home with all that\n_amor patriae_ which is so much more easily understood than\nexplained, will look, and look not in vain, for the help of those on\nwhom fall the smiles of a kindlier sun in regions not torn by\nearthquakes nor blasted and ravaged by volcanic fires. Will the\nreaders of this little book, who, are gifted with the means of\nindulging in the luxury of extended beneficence, remember the\ndistress of their brethren in the far north, whom distance has not\nbarred from the claim of being counted our \"neighbours\"? And whatever\ntheir humane feelings may prompt them to bestow will be gladly added\nto the Mansion-House Iceland Relief Fund.\n\nIn his desire to ascertain how far the picture of Iceland, drawn in\nthe work of Jules Verne is a correct one, the translator hopes in the\ncourse of a mail or two to receive a communication from a leading man\nof science in the island, which may furnish matter for additional\ninformation in a future edition.\n\nThe scientific portion of the French original is not without a few\nerrors, which the translator, with the kind assistance of Mr. Cameron\nof H. M. Geological Survey, has ventured to point out and correct. It\nis scarcely to be expected in a work in which the element of\namusement is intended to enter more largely than that of scientific\ninstruction, that any great degree of accuracy should be arrived at.\nYet the translator hopes that what trifling deviations from the text\nor corrections in foot notes he is responsible for, will have done a\nlittle towards the increased usefulness of the work.\n\nF.

Liedenbrock so soon!\" cried poor Martha in great alarm, half\nopening the dining-room door.\n\n\"Yes, Martha; but very likely the dinner is not half cooked, for it\nis not two yet. Saint Michael's clock has only just struck half-past\none.\"\n\n\"Then why has the master come home so soon?\"\n\n\"Perhaps he will tell us that himself.\"\n\n\"Here he is, Monsieur Axel; I will run and hide myself while you\nargue with him.\"\n\nAnd Martha retreated in safety into her own dominions.\n\nI was left alone. But how was it possible for a man of my undecided\nturn of mind to argue successfully with so irascible a person as the\nProfessor? With this persuasion I was hurrying away to my own little\nretreat upstairs, when the street door creaked upon its hinges; heavy\nfeet made the whole flight of stairs to shake; and the master of the\nhouse, passing rapidly through the dining-room, threw himself in\nhaste into his own sanctum.\n\nBut on his rapid way he had found time to fling his hazel stick into\na corner, his rough broadbrim upon the table, and these few emphatic\nwords at his nephew:\n\n\"Axel, follow me!\"\n\nI had scarcely had time to move when the Professor was again shouting\nafter me:\n\n\"What! not come yet?\"\n\nAnd I rushed into my redoubtable master's study.\n\nOtto Liedenbrock had no mischief in him, I willingly allow that; but\nunless he very considerably changes as he grows older, at the end he\nwill be a most original character.\n\nHe was professor at the Johann\u00e6um, and was delivering a series of\nlectures on mineralogy, in the course of every one of which he broke\ninto a passion once or twice at least. Not at all that he was\nover-anxious about the improvement of his class, or about the degree\nof attention with which they listened to him, or the success which\nmight eventually crown his labours. Such little matters of detail\nnever troubled him much. His teaching was as the German philosophy\ncalls it, 'subjective'; it was to benefit himself, not others. He was\na learned egotist. He was a well of science, and the pulleys worked\nuneasily when you wanted to draw anything out of it. In a word, he\nwas a learned miser.\n\nGermany has not a few professors of this sort.\n\nTo his misfortune, my uncle was not gifted with a sufficiently rapid\nutterance; not, to be sure, when he was talking at home, but\ncertainly in his public delivery; this is a want much to be deplored\nin a speaker. The fact is, that during the course of his lectures at\nthe Johann\u00e6um, the Professor often came to a complete standstill; he\nfought with wilful words that refused to pass his struggling lips,\nsuch words as resist and distend the cheeks, and at last break out\ninto the unasked-for shape of a round and most unscientific oath:\nthen his fury would gradually abate.\n\nNow in mineralogy there are many half-Greek and half-Latin terms,\nvery hard to articulate, and which would be most trying to a poet's\nmeasures. I don't wish to say a word against so respectable a\nscience, far be that from me. True, in the august presence of\nrhombohedral crystals, retinasphaltic resins, gehlenites, Fassaites,\nmolybdenites, tungstates of manganese, and titanite of zirconium,\nwhy, the most facile of tongues may make a slip now and then.\n\nIt therefore happened that this venial fault of my uncle's came to be\npretty well understood in time, and an unfair advantage was taken of\nit; the students laid wait for him in dangerous places, and when he\nbegan to stumble, loud was the laughter, which is not in good taste,\nnot even in Germans. And if there was always a full audience to\nhonour the Liedenbrock courses, I should be sorry to conjecture how\nmany came to make merry at my uncle's expense.\n\nNevertheless my good uncle was a man of deep learning--a fact I am\nmost anxious to assert and reassert. Sometimes he might irretrievably\ninjure a specimen by his too great ardour in handling it; but still\nhe united the genius of a true geologist with the keen eye of the\nmineralogist. Armed with his hammer, his steel pointer, his magnetic\nneedles, his blowpipe, and his bottle of nitric acid, he was a\npowerful man of science. He would refer any mineral to its proper\nplace among the six hundred [1] elementary substances now enumerated,\nby its fracture, its appearance, its hardness, its fusibility, its\nsonorousness, its smell, and its taste.\n\nThe name of Liedenbrock was honourably mentioned in colleges and\nlearned societies. Humphry Davy, [2] Humboldt, Captain Sir John\nFranklin, General Sabine, never failed to call upon him on their way\nthrough Hamburg. Becquerel, Ebelman, Brewster, Dumas, Milne-Edwards,\nSaint-Claire-Deville frequently consulted him upon the most difficult\nproblems in chemistry, a science which was indebted to him for\nconsiderable discoveries, for in 1853 there had appeared at Leipzig\nan imposing folio by Otto Liedenbrock, entitled, \"A Treatise upon\nTranscendental Chemistry,\" with plates; a work, however, which failed\nto cover its expenses.\n\nTo all these titles to honour let me add that my uncle was the\ncurator of the museum of mineralogy formed by M. Struve, the Russian\nambassador; a most valuable collection, the fame of which is European.\n\nSuch was the gentleman who addressed me in that impetuous manner.\nFancy a tall, spare man, of an iron constitution, and with a fair\ncomplexion which took off a good ten years from the fifty he must own\nto. His restless eyes were in incessant motion behind his full-sized\nspectacles. His long, thin nose was like a knife blade. Boys have\nbeen heard to remark that that organ was magnetised and attracted\niron filings. But this was merely a mischievous report; it had no\nattraction except for snuff, which it seemed to draw to itself in\ngreat quantities.\n\nWhen I have added, to complete my portrait, that my uncle walked by\nmathematical strides of a yard and a half, and that in walking he\nkept his fists firmly closed, a sure sign of an irritable\ntemperament, I think I shall have said enough to disenchant any one\nwho should by mistake have coveted much of his company.\n\nHe lived in his own little house in K\u00f6nigstrasse, a structure half\nbrick and half wood, with a gable cut into steps; it looked upon one\nof those winding canals which intersect each other in the middle of\nthe ancient quarter of Hamburg, and which the great fire of 1842 had\nfortunately spared.\n\n[1] Sixty-three. (Tr.)\n\n[2] As Sir Humphry Davy died in 1829, the translator must be pardoned\nfor pointing out here an anachronism, unless we are to assume that\nthe learned Professor's celebrity dawned in his earliest years. (Tr.)\n\nIt is true that the old house stood slightly off the perpendicular,\nand bulged out a little towards the street; its roof sloped a little\nto one side, like the cap over the left ear of a Tugendbund student;\nits lines wanted accuracy; but after all, it stood firm, thanks to an\nold elm which buttressed it in front, and which often in spring sent\nits young sprays through the window panes.\n\nMy uncle was tolerably well off for a German professor. The house was\nhis own, and everything in it. The living contents were his\ngod-daughter Gr\u00e4uben, a young Virlandaise of seventeen, Martha, and\nmyself. As his nephew and an orphan, I became his laboratory\nassistant.\n\nI freely confess that I was exceedingly fond of geology and all its\nkindred sciences; the blood of a mineralogist was in my veins, and in\nthe midst of my specimens I was always happy.\n\nIn a word, a man might live happily enough in the little old house in\nthe K\u00f6nigstrasse, in spite of the restless impatience of its master,\nfor although he was a little too excitable--he was very fond of me.\nBut the man had no notion how to wait; nature herself was too slow\nfor him. In April, after he had planted in the terra-cotta pots\noutside his window seedling plants of mignonette and convolvulus, he\nwould go and give them a little pull by their leaves to make them\ngrow faster. In dealing with such a strange individual there was\nnothing for it but prompt obedience. I therefore rushed after him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nA MYSTERY TO BE SOLVED AT ANY PRICE\n\n\nThat study of his was a museum, and nothing else. Specimens of\neverything known in mineralogy lay there in their places in perfect\norder, and correctly named, divided into inflammable, metallic, and\nlithoid minerals.\n\nHow well I knew all these bits of science! Many a time, instead of\nenjoying the company of lads of my own age, I had preferred dusting\nthese graphites, anthracites, coals, lignites, and peats! And there\nwere bitumens, resins, organic salts, to be protected from the least\ngrain of dust; and metals, from iron to gold, metals whose current\nvalue altogether disappeared in the presence of the republican\nequality of scientific specimens; and stones too, enough to rebuild\nentirely the house in K\u00f6nigstrasse, even with a handsome additional\nroom, which would have suited me admirably.\n\nBut on entering this study now I thought of none of all these\nwonders; my uncle alone filled my thoughts. He had thrown himself\ninto a velvet easy-chair, and was grasping between his hands a book\nover which he bent, pondering with intense admiration.\n\n\"Here's a remarkable book! What a wonderful book!\" he was exclaiming.\n\nThese ejaculations brought to my mind the fact that my uncle was\nliable to occasional fits of bibliomania; but no old book had any\nvalue in his eyes unless it had the virtue of being nowhere else to\nbe found, or, at any rate, of being illegible.\n\n\"Well, now; don't you see it yet? Why I have got a priceless\ntreasure, that I found his morning, in rummaging in old Hevelius's\nshop, the Jew.\"\n\n\"Magnificent!\" I replied, with a good imitation of enthusiasm.\n\nWhat was the good of all this fuss about an old quarto, bound in\nrough calf, a yellow, faded volume, with a ragged seal depending from\nit?\n\nBut for all that there was no lull yet in the admiring exclamations\nof the Professor.\n\n\"See,\" he went on, both asking the questions and supplying the\nanswers. \"Isn't it a beauty? Yes; splendid! Did you ever see such a\nbinding? Doesn't the book open easily? Yes; it stops open anywhere.\nBut does it shut equally well? Yes; for the binding and the leaves\nare flush, all in a straight line, and no gaps or openings anywhere.\nAnd look at its back, after seven hundred years. Why, Bozerian,\nCloss, or Purgold might have been proud of such a binding!\"\n\nWhile rapidly making these comments my uncle kept opening and\nshutting the old tome. I really could do no less than ask a question\nabout its contents, although I did not feel the slightest interest.\n\n\"And what is the title of this marvellous work?\" I asked with an\naffected eagerness which he must have been very blind not to see\nthrough.\n\n\"This work,\" replied my uncle, firing up with renewed enthusiasm,\n\"this work is the Heims Kringla of Snorre Turlleson, the most famous\nIcelandic author of the twelfth century! It is the chronicle of the\nNorwegian princes who ruled in Iceland.\"\n\n\"Indeed;\" I cried, keeping up wonderfully, \"of course it is a German\ntranslation?\"\n\n\"What!\" sharply replied the Professor, \"a translation! What should I\ndo with a translation? This _is_ the Icelandic original, in the\nmagnificent idiomatic vernacular, which is both rich and simple, and\nadmits of an infinite variety of grammatical combinations and verbal\nmodifications.\"\n\n\"Like German.\" I happily ventured.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied my uncle, shrugging his shoulders; \"but, in addition\nto all this, the Icelandic has three numbers like the Greek, and\nirregular declensions of nouns proper like the Latin.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said I, a little moved out of my indifference; \"and is the type\ngood?\"\n\n\"Type! What do you mean by talking of type, wretched Axel? Type! Do\nyou take it for a printed book, you ignorant fool? It is a\nmanuscript, a Runic manuscript.\"\n\n\"Runic?\"\n\n\"Yes. Do you want me to explain what that is?\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" I replied in the tone of an injured man. But my\nuncle persevered, and told me, against my will, of many things I\ncared nothing about.\n\n\"Runic characters were in use in Iceland in former ages. They were\ninvented, it is said, by Odin himself. Look there, and wonder,\nimpious young man, and admire these letters, the invention of the\nScandinavian god!\"\n\nWell, well! not knowing what to say, I was going to prostrate myself\nbefore this wonderful book, a way of answering equally pleasing to\ngods and kings, and which has the advantage of never giving them any\nembarrassment, when a little incident happened to divert conversation\ninto another channel.\n\nThis was the appearance of a dirty slip of parchment, which slipped\nout of the volume and fell upon the floor.\n\nMy uncle pounced upon this shred with incredible avidity. An old\ndocument, enclosed an immemorial time within the folds of this old\nbook, had for him an immeasurable value.\n\n\"What's this?\" he cried.\n\nAnd he laid out upon the table a piece of parchment, five inches by\nthree, and along which were traced certain mysterious characters.\n\nHere is the exact facsimile. I think it important to let these\nstrange signs be publicly known, for they were the means of drawing\non Professor Liedenbrock and his nephew to undertake the most\nwonderful expedition of the nineteenth century.\n\n[Runic glyphs occur here]\n\nThe Professor mused a few moments over this series of characters;\nthen raising his spectacles he pronounced:\n\n\"These are Runic letters; they are exactly like those of the\nmanuscript of Snorre Turlleson. But, what on earth is their meaning?\"\n\nRunic letters appearing to my mind to be an invention of the learned\nto mystify this poor world, I was not sorry to see my uncle suffering\nthe pangs of mystification. At least, so it seemed to me, judging\nfrom his fingers, which were beginning to work with terrible energy.\n\n\"It is certainly old Icelandic,\" he muttered between his teeth.\n\nAnd Professor Liedenbrock must have known, for he was acknowledged to\nbe quite a polyglot. Not that he could speak fluently in the two\nthousand languages and twelve thousand dialects which are spoken on\nthe earth, but he knew at least his share of them.\n\nSo he was going, in the presence of this difficulty, to give way to\nall the impetuosity of his character, and I was preparing for a\nviolent outbreak, when two o'clock struck by the little timepiece\nover the fireplace.\n\nAt that moment our good housekeeper Martha opened the study door,\nsaying:\n\n\"Dinner is ready!\"\n\nI am afraid he sent that soup to where it would boil away to nothing,\nand Martha took to her heels for safety. I followed her, and hardly\nknowing how I got there I found myself seated in my usual place.\n\nI waited a few minutes. No Professor came. Never within my\nremembrance had he missed the important ceremonial of dinner. And yet\nwhat a good dinner it was! There was parsley soup, an omelette of ham\ngarnished with spiced sorrel, a fillet of veal with compote of\nprunes; for dessert, crystallised fruit; the whole washed down with\nsweet Moselle.\n\nAll this my uncle was going to sacrifice to a bit of old parchment.\nAs an affectionate and attentive nephew I considered it my duty to\neat for him as well as for myself, which I did conscientiously.\n\n\"I have never known such a thing,\" said Martha. \"M. Liedenbrock is\nnot at table!\"\n\n\"Who could have believed it?\" I said, with my mouth full.\n\n\"Something serious is going to happen,\" said the servant, shaking her\nhead.\n\nMy opinion was, that nothing more serious would happen than an awful\nscene when my uncle should have discovered that his dinner was\ndevoured. I had come to the last of the fruit when a very loud voice\ntore me away from the pleasures of my dessert. With one spring I\nbounded out of the dining-room into the study.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nTHE RUNIC WRITING EXERCISES THE PROFESSOR\n\n\n\"Undoubtedly it is Runic,\" said the Professor, bending his brows;\n\"but there is a secret in it, and I mean to discover the key.\"\n\nA violent gesture finished the sentence.\n\n\"Sit there,\" he added, holding out his fist towards the table. \"Sit\nthere, and write.\"\n\nI was seated in a trice.\n\n\"Now I will dictate to you every letter of our alphabet which\ncorresponds with each of these Icelandic characters. We will see what\nthat will give us. But, by St. Michael, if you should dare to deceive\nme--\"\n\nThe dictation commenced. I did my best. Every letter was given me one\nafter the other, with the following remarkable result:\n\n     mm.rnlls  esrevel  seecIde\n     sgtssmf   vnteief  niedrke\n     kt,samn   atrateS  saodrrn\n     emtnaeI   nvaect   rrilSa\n     Atsaar    .nvcrc   ieaabs\n     ccrmi     eevtVl   frAntv\n     dt,iac    oseibo   KediiI\n\n[Redactor: In the original version the initial letter is an 'm' with\na superscore over it. It is my supposition that this is the\ntranslator's way of writing 'mm' and I have replaced it accordingly,\nsince our typography does not allow such a character.]\n\nWhen this work was ended my uncle tore the paper from me and examined\nit attentively for a long time.\n\n\"What does it all mean?\" he kept repeating mechanically.\n\nUpon my honour I could not have enlightened him. Besides he did not\nask me, and he went on talking to himself.\n\n\"This is what is called a cryptogram, or cipher,\" he said, \"in which\nletters are purposely thrown in confusion, which if properly arranged\nwould reveal their sense. Only think that under this jargon there may\nlie concealed the clue to some great discovery!\"\n\nAs for me, I was of opinion that there was nothing at all, in it;\nthough, of course, I took care not to say so.\n\nThen the Professor took the book and the parchment, and diligently\ncompared them together.\n\n\"These two writings are not by the same hand,\" he said; \"the cipher\nis of later date than the book, an undoubted proof of which I see in\na moment. The first letter is a double m, a letter which is not to be\nfound in Turlleson's book, and which was only added to the alphabet\nin the fourteenth century. Therefore there are two hundred years\nbetween the manuscript and the document.\"\n\nI admitted that this was a strictly logical conclusion.\n\n\"I am therefore led to imagine,\" continued my uncle, \"that some\npossessor of this book wrote these mysterious letters. But who was\nthat possessor? Is his name nowhere to be found in the manuscript?\"\n\nMy uncle raised his spectacles, took up a strong lens, and carefully\nexamined the blank pages of the book. On the front of the second, the\ntitle-page, he noticed a sort of stain which looked like an ink blot.\nBut in looking at it very closely he thought he could distinguish\nsome half-effaced letters. My uncle at once fastened upon this as the\ncentre of interest, and he laboured at that blot, until by the help\nof his microscope he ended by making out the following Runic\ncharacters which he read without difficulty.\n\n\"Arne Saknussemm!\" he cried in triumph. \"Why that is the name of\nanother Icelander, a savant of the sixteenth century, a celebrated\nalchemist!\"\n\nI gazed at my uncle with satisfactory admiration.\n\n\"Those alchemists,\" he resumed, \"Avicenna, Bacon, Lully, Paracelsus,\nwere the real and only savants of their time. They made discoveries\nat which we are astonished. Has not this Saknussemm concealed under\nhis cryptogram some surprising invention? It is so; it must be so!\"\n\nThe Professor's imagination took fire at this hypothesis.\n\n\"No doubt,\" I ventured to reply, \"but what interest would he have in\nthus hiding so marvellous a discovery?\"\n\n\"Why? Why? How can I tell? Did not Galileo do the same by Saturn? We\nshall see. I will get at the secret of this document, and I will\nneither sleep nor eat until I have found it out.\"\n\nMy comment on this was a half-suppressed \"Oh!\"\n\n\"Nor you either, Axel,\" he added.\n\n\"The deuce!\" said I to myself; \"then it is lucky I have eaten two\ndinners to-day!\"\n\n\"First of all we must find out the key to this cipher; that cannot be\ndifficult.\"\n\nAt these words I quickly raised my head; but my uncle went on\nsoliloquising.\n\n\"There's nothing easier. In this document there are a hundred and\nthirty-two letters, viz., seventy-seven consonants and fifty-five\nvowels. This is the proportion found in southern languages, whilst\nnorthern tongues are much richer in consonants; therefore this is in\na southern language.\"\n\nThese were very fair conclusions, I thought.\n\n\"But what language is it?\"\n\nHere I looked for a display of learning, but I met instead with\nprofound analysis.\n\n\"This Saknussemm,\" he went on, \"was a very well-informed man; now\nsince he was not writing in his own mother tongue, he would naturally\nselect that which was currently adopted by the choice spirits of the\nsixteenth century; I mean Latin. If I am mistaken, I can but try\nSpanish, French, Italian, Greek, or Hebrew. But the savants of the\nsixteenth century generally wrote in Latin. I am therefore entitled\nto pronounce this, \u00e0 priori, to be Latin. It is Latin.\"\n\nI jumped up in my chair. My Latin memories rose in revolt against the\nnotion that these barbarous words could belong to the sweet language\nof Virgil.\n\n\"Yes, it is Latin,\" my uncle went on; \"but it is Latin confused and\nin disorder; \"_pertubata seu inordinata,_\" as Euclid has it.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" thought I, \"if you can bring order out of that\nconfusion, my dear uncle, you are a clever man.\"\n\n\"Let us examine carefully,\" said he again, taking up the leaf upon\nwhich I had written. \"Here is a series of one hundred and thirty-two\nletters in apparent disorder. There are words consisting of\nconsonants only, as _nrrlls;_ others, on the other hand, in which\nvowels predominate, as for instance the fifth, _uneeief,_ or the last\nbut one, _oseibo_. Now this arrangement has evidently not been\npremeditated; it has arisen mathematically in obedience to the\nunknown law which has ruled in the succession of these letters. It\nappears to me a certainty that the original sentence was written in a\nproper manner, and afterwards distorted by a law which we have yet to\ndiscover. Whoever possesses the key of this cipher will read it with\nfluency. What is that key? Axel, have you got it?\"\n\nI answered not a word, and for a very good reason. My eyes had fallen\nupon a charming picture, suspended against the wall, the portrait of\nGr\u00e4uben. My uncle's ward was at that time at Altona, staying with a\nrelation, and in her absence I was very downhearted; for I may\nconfess it to you now, the pretty Virlandaise and the professor's\nnephew loved each other with a patience and a calmness entirely\nGerman. We had become engaged unknown to my uncle, who was too much\ntaken up with geology to be able to enter into such feelings as ours.\nGr\u00e4uben was a lovely blue-eyed blonde, rather given to gravity and\nseriousness; but that did not prevent her from loving me very\nsincerely. As for me, I adored her, if there is such a word in the\nGerman language. Thus it happened that the picture of my pretty\nVirlandaise threw me in a moment out of the world of realities into\nthat of memory and fancy.\n\nThere looked down upon me the faithful companion of my labours and my\nrecreations. Every day she helped me to arrange my uncle's precious\nspecimens; she and I labelled them together. Mademoiselle Gr\u00e4uben was\nan accomplished mineralogist; she could have taught a few things to a\nsavant. She was fond of investigating abstruse scientific questions.\nWhat pleasant hours we have spent in study; and how often I envied\nthe very stones which she handled with her charming fingers.\n\nThen, when our leisure hours came, we used to go out together and\nturn into the shady avenues by the Alster, and went happily side by\nside up to the old windmill, which forms such an improvement to the\nlandscape at the head of the lake. On the road we chatted hand in\nhand; I told her amusing tales at which she laughed heartily. Then we\nreached the banks of the Elbe, and after having bid good-bye to the\nswan, sailing gracefully amidst the white water lilies, we returned\nto the quay by the steamer.\n\nThat is just where I was in my dream, when my uncle with a vehement\nthump on the table dragged me back to the realities of life.\n\n\"Come,\" said he, \"the very first idea which would come into any one's\nhead to confuse the letters of a sentence would be to write the words\nvertically instead of horizontally.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" said I.\n\n\"Now we must see what would be the effect of that, Axel; put down\nupon this paper any sentence you like, only instead of arranging the\nletters in the usual way, one after the other, place them in\nsuccession in vertical columns, so as to group them together in five\nor six vertical lines.\"\n\nI caught his meaning, and immediately produced the following literary\nwonder:\n\n     I       y       l       o       a       u\n     l       o       l       w       r       b\n     o       u       ,       n       G       e\n     v       w       m       d       r       n\n     e       e       y       e       a       !\n\n\"Good,\" said the professor, without reading them, \"now set down those\nwords in a horizontal line.\"\n\nI obeyed, and with this result:\n\n     Iyloau lolwrb ou,nGe vwmdrn eeyea!\n\n\"Excellent!\" said my uncle, taking the paper hastily out of my hands.\n\"This begins to look just like an ancient document: the vowels and\nthe consonants are grouped together in equal disorder; there are even\ncapitals in the middle of words, and commas too, just as in\nSaknussemm's parchment.\"\n\nI considered these remarks very clever.\n\n\"Now,\" said my uncle, looking straight at me, \"to read the sentence\nwhich you have just written, and with which I am wholly unacquainted,\nI shall only have to take the first letter of each word, then the\nsecond, the third, and so forth.\"\n\nAnd my uncle, to his great astonishment, and my much greater, read:\n\n     \"I love you well, my own dear Gr\u00e4uben!\"\n\n\"Hallo!\" cried the Professor.\n\nYes, indeed, without knowing what I was about, like an awkward and\nunlucky lover, I had compromised myself by writing this unfortunate\nsentence.\n\n\"Aha! you are in love with Gr\u00e4uben?\" he said, with the right look for\na guardian.\n\n\"Yes; no!\" I stammered.\n\n\"You love Gr\u00e4uben,\" he went on once or twice dreamily. \"Well, let us\napply the process I have suggested to the document in question.\"\n\nMy uncle, falling back into his absorbing contemplations, had already\nforgotten my imprudent words. I merely say imprudent, for the great\nmind of so learned a man of course had no place for love affairs, and\nhappily the grand business of the document gained me the victory.\n\nJust as the moment of the supreme experiment arrived the Professor's\neyes flashed right through his spectacles. There was a quivering in\nhis fingers as he grasped the old parchment. He was deeply moved. At\nlast he gave a preliminary cough, and with profound gravity, naming\nin succession the first, then the second letter of each word, he\ndictated me the following:\n\n     mmessvnkaSenrA.icefdoK.segnittamvrtn\n     ecertserrette,rotaisadva,ednecsedsadne\n     lacartniiilvIsiratracSarbmvtabiledmek\n     meretarcsilvcoIsleffenSnI.\n\nI confess I felt considerably excited in coming to the end; these\nletters named, one at a time, had carried no sense to my mind; I\ntherefore waited for the Professor with great pomp to unfold the\nmagnificent but hidden Latin of this mysterious phrase.\n\nBut who could have foretold the result? A violent thump made the\nfurniture rattle, and spilt some ink, and my pen dropped from between\nmy fingers.\n\n\"That's not it,\" cried my uncle, \"there's no sense in it.\"\n\nThen darting out like a shot, bowling down stairs like an avalanche,\nhe rushed into the K\u00f6nigstrasse and fled.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nTHE ENEMY TO BE STARVED INTO SUBMISSION\n\n\n\"He is gone!\" cried Martha, running out of her kitchen at the noise\nof the violent slamming of doors.\n\n\"Yes,\" I replied, \"completely gone.\"\n\n\"Well; and how about his dinner?\" said the old servant.\n\n\"He won't have any.\"\n\n\"And his supper?\"\n\n\"He won't have any.\"\n\n\"What?\" cried Martha, with clasped hands.\n\n\"No, my dear Martha, he will eat no more. No one in the house is to\neat anything at all. Uncle Liedenbrock is going to make us all fast\nuntil he has succeeded in deciphering an undecipherable scrawl.\"\n\n\"Oh, my dear! must we then all die of hunger?\"\n\nI hardly dared to confess that, with so absolute a ruler as my uncle,\nthis fate was inevitable.\n\nThe old servant, visibly moved, returned to the kitchen, moaning\npiteously.\n\nWhen I was alone, I thought I would go and tell Gr\u00e4uben all about it.\nBut how should I be able to escape from the house? The Professor\nmight return at any moment. And suppose he called me? And suppose he\ntackled me again with this logomachy, which might vainly have been\nset before ancient Oedipus. And if I did not obey his call, who could\nanswer for what might happen?\n\nThe wisest course was to remain where I was. A mineralogist at\nBesan\u00e7on had just sent us a collection of siliceous nodules, which I\nhad to classify: so I set to work; I sorted, labelled, and arranged\nin their own glass case all these hollow specimens, in the cavity of\neach of which was a nest of little crystals.\n\nBut this work did not succeed in absorbing all my attention. That old\ndocument kept working in my brain. My head throbbed with excitement,\nand I felt an undefined uneasiness. I was possessed with a\npresentiment of coming evil.\n\nIn an hour my nodules were all arranged upon successive shelves. Then\nI dropped down into the old velvet armchair, my head thrown back and\nmy hands joined over it. I lighted my long crooked pipe, with a\npainting on it of an idle-looking naiad; then I amused myself\nwatching the process of the conversion of the tobacco into carbon,\nwhich was by slow degrees making my naiad into a negress. Now and\nthen I listened to hear whether a well-known step was on the stairs.\nNo. Where could my uncle be at that moment? I fancied him running\nunder the noble trees which line the road to Altona, gesticulating,\nmaking shots with his cane, thrashing the long grass, cutting the\nheads off the thistles, and disturbing the contemplative storks in\ntheir peaceful solitude.\n\nWould he return in triumph or in discouragement? Which would get the\nupper hand, he or the secret? I was thus asking myself questions, and\nmechanically taking between my fingers the sheet of paper\nmysteriously disfigured with the incomprehensible succession of\nletters I had written down; and I repeated to myself \"What does it\nall mean?\"\n\nI sought to group the letters so as to form words. Quite impossible!\nWhen I put them together by twos, threes, fives or sixes, nothing\ncame of it but nonsense. To be sure the fourteenth, fifteenth and\nsixteenth letters made the English word 'ice'; the eighty-third and\ntwo following made 'sir'; and in the midst of the document, in the\nsecond and third lines, I observed the words, \"rots,\" \"mutabile,\"\n\"ira,\" \"net,\" \"atra.\"\n\n\"Come now,\" I thought, \"these words seem to justify my uncle's view\nabout the language of the document. In the fourth line appeared the\nword \"luco\", which means a sacred wood. It is true that in the third\nline was the word \"tabiled\", which looked like Hebrew, and in the\nlast the purely French words \"mer\", \"arc\", \"mere.\"\"\n\nAll this was enough to drive a poor fellow crazy. Four different\nlanguages in this ridiculous sentence! What connection could there\npossibly be between such words as ice, sir, anger, cruel, sacred\nwood, changeable, mother, bow, and sea? The first and the last might\nhave something to do with each other; it was not at all surprising\nthat in a document written in Iceland there should be mention of a\nsea of ice; but it was quite another thing to get to the end of this\ncryptogram with so small a clue. So I was struggling with an\ninsurmountable difficulty; my brain got heated, my eyes watered over\nthat sheet of paper; its hundred and thirty-two letters seemed to\nflutter and fly around me like those motes of mingled light and\ndarkness which float in the air around the head when the blood is\nrushing upwards with undue violence. I was a prey to a kind of\nhallucination; I was stifling; I wanted air. Unconsciously I fanned\nmyself with the bit of paper, the back and front of which\nsuccessively came before my eyes. What was my surprise when, in one\nof those rapid revolutions, at the moment when the back was turned to\nme I thought I caught sight of the Latin words \"craterem,\"\n\"terrestre,\" and others.\n\nA sudden light burst in upon me; these hints alone gave me the first\nglimpse of the truth; I had discovered the key to the cipher. To read\nthe document, it would not even be necessary to read it through the\npaper. Such as it was, just such as it had been dictated to me, so it\nmight be spelt out with ease. All those ingenious professorial\ncombinations were coming right. He was right as to the arrangement of\nthe letters; he was right as to the language. He had been within a\nhair's breadth of reading this Latin document from end to end; but\nthat hair's breadth, chance had given it to me!\n\nYou may be sure I felt stirred up. My eyes were dim, I could scarcely\nsee. I had laid the paper upon the table. At a glance I could tell\nthe whole secret.\n\nAt last I became more calm. I made a wise resolve to walk twice round\nthe room quietly and settle my nerves, and then I returned into the\ndeep gulf of the huge armchair.\n\n\"Now I'll read it,\" I cried, after having well distended my lungs\nwith air.\n\nI leaned over the table; I laid my finger successively upon every\nletter; and without a pause, without one moment's hesitation, I read\noff the whole sentence aloud.\n\nStupefaction! terror! I sat overwhelmed as if with a sudden deadly\nblow. What! that which I read had actually, really been done! A\nmortal man had had the audacity to penetrate! . . .\n\n\"Ah!\" I cried, springing up. \"But no! no! My uncle shall never know\nit. He would insist upon doing it too. He would want to know all\nabout it. Ropes could not hold him, such a determined geologist as he\nis! He would start, he would, in spite of everything and everybody,\nand he would take me with him, and we should never get back. No,\nnever! never!\"\n\nMy over-excitement was beyond all description.\n\n\"No! no! it shall not be,\" I declared energetically; \"and as it is in\nmy power to prevent the knowledge of it coming into the mind of my\ntyrant, I will do it. By dint of turning this document round and\nround, he too might discover the key. I will destroy it.\"\n\nThere was a little fire left on the hearth. I seized not only the\npaper but Saknussemm's parchment; with a feverish hand I was about to\nfling it all upon the coals and utterly destroy and abolish this\ndangerous secret, when the study door opened, and my uncle appeared.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nFAMINE, THEN VICTORY, FOLLOWED BY DISMAY\n\n\nI had only just time to replace the unfortunate document upon the\ntable.\n\nProfessor Liedenbrock seemed to be greatly abstracted.\n\nThe ruling thought gave him no rest. Evidently he had gone deeply\ninto the matter, analytically and with profound scrutiny. He had\nbrought all the resources of his mind to bear upon it during his\nwalk, and he had come back to apply some new combination.\n\nHe sat in his armchair, and pen in hand he began what looked very\nmuch like algebraic formula: I followed with my eyes his trembling\nhands, I took count of every movement. Might not some unhoped-for\nresult come of it? I trembled, too, very unnecessarily, since the\ntrue key was in my hands, and no other would open the secret.\n\nFor three long hours my uncle worked on without a word, without\nlifting his head; rubbing out, beginning again, then rubbing out\nagain, and so on a hundred times.\n\nI knew very well that if he succeeded in setting down these letters\nin every possible relative position, the sentence would come out. But\nI knew also that twenty letters alone could form two quintillions,\nfour hundred and thirty-two quadrillions, nine hundred and two\ntrillions, eight billions, a hundred and seventy-six millions, six\nhundred and forty thousand combinations. Now, here were a hundred and\nthirty-two letters in this sentence, and these hundred and thirty-two\nletters would give a number of different sentences, each made up of\nat least a hundred and thirty-three figures, a number which passed\nfar beyond all calculation or conception.\n\nSo I felt reassured as far as regarded this heroic method of solving\nthe difficulty.\n\nBut time was passing away; night came on; the street noises ceased;\nmy uncle, bending over his task, noticed nothing, not even Martha\nhalf opening the door; he heard not a sound, not even that excellent\nwoman saying:\n\n\"Will not monsieur take any supper to-night?\"\n\nAnd poor Martha had to go away unanswered. As for me, after long\nresistance, I was overcome by sleep, and fell off at the end of the\nsofa, while uncle Liedenbrock went on calculating and rubbing out his\ncalculations.\n\nWhen I awoke next morning that indefatigable worker was still at his\npost. His red eyes, his pale complexion, his hair tangled between his\nfeverish fingers, the red spots on his cheeks, revealed his desperate\nstruggle with impossibilities, and the weariness of spirit, the\nmental wrestlings he must have undergone all through that unhappy\nnight.\n\nTo tell the plain truth, I pitied him. In spite of the reproaches\nwhich I considered I had a right to lay upon him, a certain feeling\nof compassion was beginning to gain upon me. The poor man was so\nentirely taken up with his one idea that he had even forgotten how to\nget angry. All the strength of his feelings was concentrated upon one\npoint alone; and as their usual vent was closed, it was to be feared\nlest extreme tension should give rise to an explosion sooner or later.\n\nI might with a word have loosened the screw of the steel vice that\nwas crushing his brain; but that word I would not speak.\n\nYet I was not an ill-natured fellow. Why was I dumb at such a crisis?\nWhy so insensible to my uncle's interests?\n\n\"No, no,\" I repeated, \"I shall not speak. He would insist upon going;\nnothing on earth could stop him. His imagination is a volcano, and to\ndo that which other geologists have never done he would risk his\nlife. I will preserve silence. I will keep the secret which mere\nchance has revealed to me. To discover it, would be to kill Professor\nLiedenbrock! Let him find it out himself if he can. I will never have\nit laid to my door that I led him to his destruction.\"\n\nHaving formed this resolution, I folded my arms and waited. But I had\nnot reckoned upon one little incident which turned up a few hours\nafter.\n\nWhen our good Martha wanted to go to Market, she found the door\nlocked. The big key was gone. Who could have taken it out? Assuredly,\nit was my uncle, when he returned the night before from his hurried\nwalk.\n\nWas this done on purpose? Or was it a mistake? Did he want to reduce\nus by famine? This seemed like going rather too far! What! should\nMartha and I be victims of a position of things in which we had not\nthe smallest interest? It was a fact that a few years before this,\nwhilst my uncle was working at his great classification of minerals,\nhe was forty-eight hours without eating, and all his household were\nobliged to share in this scientific fast. As for me, what I remember\nis, that I got severe cramps in my stomach, which hardly suited the\nconstitution of a hungry, growing lad.\n\nNow it appeared to me as if breakfast was going to be wanting, just\nas supper had been the night before. Yet I resolved to be a hero, and\nnot to be conquered by the pangs of hunger. Martha took it very\nseriously, and, poor woman, was very much distressed. As for me, the\nimpossibility of leaving the house distressed me a good deal more,\nand for a very good reason. A caged lover's feelings may easily be\nimagined.\n\nMy uncle went on working, his imagination went off rambling into the\nideal world of combinations; he was far away from earth, and really\nfar away from earthly wants.\n\nAbout noon hunger began to stimulate me severely. Martha had, without\nthinking any harm, cleared out the larder the night before, so that\nnow there was nothing left in the house. Still I held out; I made it\na point of honour.\n\nTwo o'clock struck. This was becoming ridiculous; worse than that,\nunbearable. I began to say to myself that I was exaggerating the\nimportance of the document; that my uncle would surely not believe in\nit, that he would set it down as a mere puzzle; that if it came to\nthe worst, we should lay violent hands on him and keep him at home if\nhe thought on venturing on the expedition; that, after all, he might\nhimself discover the key of the cipher, and that then I should be\nclear at the mere expense of my involuntary abstinence.\n\nThese reasons seemed excellent to me, though on the night before I\nshould have rejected them with indignation; I even went so far as to\ncondemn myself for my absurdity in having waited so long, and I\nfinally resolved to let it all out.\n\nI was therefore meditating a proper introduction to the matter, so as\nnot to seem too abrupt, when the Professor jumped up, clapped on his\nhat, and prepared to go out.\n\nSurely he was not going out, to shut us in again! no, never!\n\n\"Uncle!\" I cried.\n\nHe seemed not to hear me.\n\n\"Uncle Liedenbrock!\" I cried, lifting up my voice.\n\n\"Ay,\" he answered like a man suddenly waking.\n\n\"Uncle, that key!\"\n\n\"What key? The door key?\"\n\n\"No, no!\" I cried. \"The key of the document.\"\n\nThe Professor stared at me over his spectacles; no doubt he saw\nsomething unusual in the expression of my countenance; for he laid\nhold of my arm, and speechlessly questioned me with his eyes. Yes,\nnever was a question more forcibly put.\n\nI nodded my head up and down.\n\nHe shook his pityingly, as if he was dealing with a lunatic. I gave a\nmore affirmative gesture.\n\nHis eyes glistened and sparkled with live fire, his hand was shaken\nthreateningly.\n\nThis mute conversation at such a momentous crisis would have riveted\nthe attention of the most indifferent. And the fact really was that I\ndared not speak now, so intense was the excitement for fear lest my\nuncle should smother me in his first joyful embraces. But he became\nso urgent that I was at last compelled to answer.\n\n\"Yes, that key, chance--\"\n\n\"What is that you are saying?\" he shouted with indescribable emotion.\n\n\"There, read that!\" I said, presenting a sheet of paper on which I\nhad written.\n\n\"But there is nothing in this,\" he answered, crumpling up the paper.\n\n\"No, nothing until you proceed to read from the end to the beginning.\"\n\nI had not finished my sentence when the Professor broke out into a\ncry, nay, a roar. A new revelation burst in upon him. He was\ntransformed!\n\n\"Aha, clever Saknussemm!\" he cried. \"You had first written out your\nsentence the wrong way.\"\n\nAnd darting upon the paper, with eyes bedimmed, and voice choked with\nemotion, he read the whole document from the last letter to the first.\n\nIt was conceived in the following terms:\n\n     In Sneffels Joculis craterem quem delibat\n     Umbra Scartaris Julii intra calendas descende,\n     Audax viator, et terrestre centrum attinges.\n     Quod feci, Arne Saknussemm.[1]\n\nWhich bad Latin may be translated thus:\n\n\"Descend, bold traveller, into the crater of the jokul of Sneffels,\nwhich the shadow of Scartaris touches before the kalends of July, and\nyou will attain the centre of the earth; which I have done, Arne\nSaknussemm.\"\n\nIn reading this, my uncle gave a spring as if he had touched a Leyden\njar. His audacity, his joy, and his convictions were magnificent to\nbehold. He came and he went; he seized his head between both his\nhands; he pushed the chairs out of their places, he piled up his\nbooks; incredible as it may seem, he rattled his precious nodules of\nflints together; he sent a kick here, a thump there. At last his\nnerves calmed down, and like a man exhausted by too lavish an\nexpenditure of vital power, he sank back exhausted into his armchair.\n\n\"What o'clock is it?\" he asked after a few moments of silence.\n\n\"Three o'clock,\" I replied.\n\n\"Is it really? The dinner-hour is past, and I did not know it. I am\nhalf dead with hunger. Come on, and after dinner--\"\n\n[1] In the cipher, _audax_ is written _avdas,_ and _quod_ and _quem,_\n_hod_ and _ken_. (Tr.)\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"After dinner, pack up my trunk.\"\n\n\"What?\" I cried.\n\n\"And yours!\" replied the indefatigable Professor, entering the\ndining-room.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nEXCITING DISCUSSIONS ABOUT AN UNPARALLELED ENTERPRISE\n\n\nAt these words a cold shiver ran through me. Yet I controlled myself;\nI even resolved to put a good face upon it. Scientific arguments\nalone could have any weight with Professor Liedenbrock. Now there\nwere good ones against the practicability of such a journey.\nPenetrate to the centre of the earth! What nonsense! But I kept my\ndialectic battery in reserve for a suitable opportunity, and I\ninterested myself in the prospect of my dinner, which was not yet\nforthcoming.\n\nIt is no use to tell of the rage and imprecations of my uncle before\nthe empty table. Explanations were given, Martha was set at liberty,\nran off to the market, and did her part so well that in an hour\nafterwards my hunger was appeased, and I was able to return to the\ncontemplation of the gravity of the situation.\n\nDuring all dinner time my uncle was almost merry; he indulged in some\nof those learned jokes which never do anybody any harm. Dessert over,\nhe beckoned me into his study.\n\nI obeyed; he sat at one end of his table, I at the other.\n\n\"Axel,\" said he very mildly; \"you are a very ingenious young man, you\nhave done me a splendid service, at a moment when, wearied out with\nthe struggle, I was going to abandon the contest. Where should I have\nlost myself? None can tell. Never, my lad, shall I forget it; and you\nshall have your share in the glory to which your discovery will lead.\"\n\n\"Oh, come!\" thought I, \"he is in a good way. Now is the time for\ndiscussing that same glory.\"\n\n\"Before all things,\" my uncle resumed, \"I enjoin you to preserve the\nmost inviolable secrecy: you understand? There are not a few in the\nscientific world who envy my success, and many would be ready to\nundertake this enterprise, to whom our return should be the first\nnews of it.\"\n\n\"Do you really think there are many people bold enough?\" said I.\n\n\"Certainly; who would hesitate to acquire such renown? If that\ndocument were divulged, a whole army of geologists would be ready to\nrush into the footsteps of Arne Saknussemm.\"\n\n\"I don't feel so very sure of that, uncle,\" I replied; \"for we have\nno proof of the authenticity of this document.\"\n\n\"What! not of the book, inside which we have discovered it?\"\n\n\"Granted. I admit that Saknussemm may have written these lines. But\ndoes it follow that he has really accomplished such a journey? And\nmay it not be that this old parchment is intended to mislead?\"\n\nI almost regretted having uttered this last word, which dropped from\nme in an unguarded moment. The Professor bent his shaggy brows, and I\nfeared I had seriously compromised my own safety. Happily no great\nharm came of it. A smile flitted across the lip of my severe\ncompanion, and he answered:\n\n\"That is what we shall see.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said I, rather put out. \"But do let me exhaust all the possible\nobjections against this document.\"\n\n\"Speak, my boy, don't be afraid. You are quite at liberty to express\nyour opinions. You are no longer my nephew only, but my colleague.\nPray go on.\"\n\n\"Well, in the first place, I wish to ask what are this Jokul, this\nSneffels, and this Scartaris, names which I have never heard before?\"\n\n\"Nothing easier. I received not long ago a map from my friend,\nAugustus Petermann, at Liepzig. Nothing could be more apropos. Take\ndown the third atlas in the second shelf in the large bookcase,\nseries Z, plate 4.\"\n\nI rose, and with the help of such precise instructions could not fail\nto find the required atlas. My uncle opened it and said:\n\n\"Here is one of the best maps of Iceland, that of Handersen, and I\nbelieve this will solve the worst of our difficulties.\"\n\nI bent over the map.\n\n\"You see this volcanic island,\" said the Professor; \"observe that all\nthe volcanoes are called jokuls, a word which means glacier in\nIcelandic, and under the high latitude of Iceland nearly all the\nactive volcanoes discharge through beds of ice. Hence this term of\njokul is applied to all the eruptive mountains in Iceland.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said I; \"but what of Sneffels?\"\n\nI was hoping that this question would be unanswerable; but I was\nmistaken. My uncle replied:\n\n\"Follow my finger along the west coast of Iceland. Do you see\nRejkiavik, the capital? You do. Well; ascend the innumerable fiords\nthat indent those sea-beaten shores, and stop at the sixty-fifth\ndegree of latitude. What do you see there?\"\n\n\"I see a peninsula looking like a thigh bone with the knee bone at\nthe end of it.\"\n\n\"A very fair comparison, my lad. Now do you see anything upon that\nknee bone?\"\n\n\"Yes; a mountain rising out of the sea.\"\n\n\"Right. That is Sn\u00e6fell.\"\n\n\"That Sn\u00e6fell?\"\n\n\"It is. It is a mountain five thousand feet high, one of the most\nremarkable in the world, if its crater leads down to the centre of\nthe earth.\"\n\n\"But that is impossible,\" I said shrugging my shoulders, and\ndisgusted at such a ridiculous supposition.\n\n\"Impossible?\" said the Professor severely; \"and why, pray?\"\n\n\"Because this crater is evidently filled with lava and burning rocks,\nand therefore--\"\n\n\"But suppose it is an extinct volcano?\"\n\n\"Extinct?\"\n\n\"Yes; the number of active volcanoes on the surface of the globe is\nat the present time only about three hundred. But there is a very\nmuch larger number of extinct ones. Now, Sn\u00e6fell is one of these.\nSince historic times there has been but one eruption of this\nmountain, that of 1219; from that time it has quieted down more and\nmore, and now it is no longer reckoned among active volcanoes.\"\n\nTo such positive statements I could make no reply. I therefore took\nrefuge in other dark passages of the document.\n\n\"What is the meaning of this word Scartaris, and what have the\nkalends of July to do with it?\"\n\nMy uncle took a few minutes to consider. For one short moment I felt\na ray of hope, speedily to be extinguished. For he soon answered thus:\n\n\"What is darkness to you is light to me. This proves the ingenious\ncare with which Saknussemm guarded and defined his discovery.\nSneffels, or Sn\u00e6fell, has several craters. It was therefore necessary\nto point out which of these leads to the centre of the globe. What\ndid the Icelandic sage do? He observed that at the approach of the\nkalends of July, that is to say in the last days of June, one of the\npeaks, called Scartaris, flung its shadow down the mouth of that\nparticular crater, and he committed that fact to his document. Could\nthere possibly have been a more exact guide? As soon as we have\narrived at the summit of Sn\u00e6fell we shall have no hesitation as to\nthe proper road to take.\"\n\nDecidedly, my uncle had answered every one of my objections. I saw\nthat his position on the old parchment was impregnable. I therefore\nceased to press him upon that part of the subject, and as above all\nthings he must be convinced, I passed on to scientific objections,\nwhich in my opinion were far more serious.\n\n\"Well, then,\" I said, \"I am forced to admit that Saknussemm's\nsentence is clear, and leaves no room for doubt. I will even allow\nthat the document bears every mark and evidence of authenticity. That\nlearned philosopher did get to the bottom of Sneffels, he has seen\nthe shadow of Scartaris touch the edge of the crater before the\nkalends of July; he may even have heard the legendary stories told in\nhis day about that crater reaching to the centre of the world; but as\nfor reaching it himself, as for performing the journey, and\nreturning, if he ever went, I say no--he never, never did that.\"\n\n\"Now for your reason?\" said my uncle ironically.\n\n\"All the theories of science demonstrate such a feat to be\nimpracticable.\"\n\n\"The theories say that, do they?\" replied the Professor in the tone\nof a meek disciple. \"Oh! unpleasant theories! How the theories will\nhinder us, won't they?\"\n\nI saw that he was only laughing at me; but I went on all the same.\n\n\"Yes; it is perfectly well known that the internal temperature rises\none degree for every 70 feet in depth; now, admitting this proportion\nto be constant, and the radius of the earth being fifteen hundred\nleagues, there must be a temperature of 360,032 degrees at the centre\nof the earth. Therefore, all the substances that compose the body of\nthis earth must exist there in a state of incandescent gas; for the\nmetals that most resist the action of heat, gold, and platinum, and\nthe hardest rocks, can never be either solid or liquid under such a\ntemperature. I have therefore good reason for asking if it is\npossible to penetrate through such a medium.\"\n\n\"So, Axel, it is the heat that troubles you?\"\n\n\"Of course it is. Were we to reach a depth of thirty miles we should\nhave arrived at the limit of the terrestrial crust, for there the\ntemperature will be more than 2372 degrees.\"\n\n\"Are you afraid of being put into a state of fusion?\"\n\n\"I will leave you to decide that question,\" I answered rather\nsullenly. \"This is my decision,\" replied Professor Liedenbrock,\nputting on one of his grandest airs. \"Neither you nor anybody else\nknows with any certainty what is going on in the interior of this\nglobe, since not the twelve thousandth part of its radius is known;\nscience is eminently perfectible; and every new theory is soon routed\nby a newer. Was it not always believed until Fourier that the\ntemperature of the interplanetary spaces decreased perpetually? and\nis it not known at the present time that the greatest cold of the\nethereal regions is never lower than 40 degrees below zero Fahr.? Why\nshould it not be the same with the internal heat? Why should it not,\nat a certain depth, attain an impassable limit, instead of rising to\nsuch a point as to fuse the most infusible metals?\"\n\nAs my uncle was now taking his stand upon hypotheses, of course,\nthere was nothing to be said.\n\n\"Well, I will tell you that true savants, amongst them Poisson, have\ndemonstrated that if a heat of 360,000 degrees [1] existed in the\ninterior of the globe, the fiery gases arising from the fused matter\nwould acquire an elastic force which the crust of the earth would be\nunable to resist, and that it would explode like the plates of a\nbursting boiler.\"\n\n\"That is Poisson's opinion, my uncle, nothing more.\"\n\n\"Granted. But it is likewise the creed adopted by other distinguished\ngeologists, that the interior of the globe is neither gas nor water,\nnor any of the heaviest minerals known, for in none of these cases\nwould the earth weigh what it does.\"\n\n\"Oh, with figures you may prove anything!\"\n\n\"But is it the same with facts! Is it not known that the number of\nvolcanoes has diminished since the first days of creation? and if\nthere is central heat may we not thence conclude that it is in\nprocess of diminution?\"\n\n\"My good uncle, if you will enter into the legion of speculation, I\ncan discuss the matter no longer.\"\n\n\"But I have to tell you that the highest names have come to the\nsupport of my views. Do you remember a visit paid to me by the\ncelebrated chemist, Humphry Davy, in 1825?\"\n\n\"Not at all, for I was not born until nineteen years afterwards.\"\n\n\"Well, Humphry Davy did call upon me on his way through Hamburg. We\nwere long engaged in discussing, amongst other problems, the\nhypothesis of the liquid structure of the terrestrial nucleus. We\nwere agreed that it could not be in a liquid state, for a reason\nwhich science has never been able to confute.\"\n\n[1] The degrees of temperature are given by Jules Verne according to\nthe centigrade system, for which we will in each case substitute the\nFahrenheit measurement. (Tr.)\n\n\"What is that reason?\" I said, rather astonished.\n\n\"Because this liquid mass would be subject, like the ocean, to the\nlunar attraction, and therefore twice every day there would be\ninternal tides, which, upheaving the terrestrial crust, would cause\nperiodical earthquakes!\"\n\n\"Yet it is evident that the surface of the globe has been subject to\nthe action of fire,\" I replied, \"and it is quite reasonable to\nsuppose that the external crust cooled down first, whilst the heat\ntook refuge down to the centre.\"\n\n\"Quite a mistake,\" my uncle answered. \"The earth has been heated by\ncombustion on its surface, that is all. Its surface was composed of a\ngreat number of metals, such as potassium and sodium, which have the\npeculiar property of igniting at the mere contact with air and water;\nthese metals kindled when the atmospheric vapours fell in rain upon\nthe soil; and by and by, when the waters penetrated into the fissures\nof the crust of the earth, they broke out into fresh combustion with\nexplosions and eruptions. Such was the cause of the numerous\nvolcanoes at the origin of the earth.\"\n\n\"Upon my word, this is a very clever hypothesis,\" I exclaimed, in\nspite rather of myself.\n\n\"And which Humphry Davy demonstrated to me by a simple experiment. He\nformed a small ball of the metals which I have named, and which was a\nvery fair representation of our globe; whenever he caused a fine dew\nof rain to fall upon its surface, it heaved up into little\nmonticules, it became oxydized and formed miniature mountains; a\ncrater broke open at one of its summits; the eruption took place, and\ncommunicated to the whole of the ball such a heat that it could not\nbe held in the hand.\"\n\nIn truth, I was beginning to be shaken by the Professor's arguments,\nbesides which he gave additional weight to them by his usual ardour\nand fervent enthusiasm.\n\n\"You see, Axel,\" he added, \"the condition of the terrestrial nucleus\nhas given rise to various hypotheses among geologists; there is no\nproof at all for this internal heat; my opinion is that there is no\nsuch thing, it cannot be; besides we shall see for ourselves, and,\nlike Arne Saknussemm, we shall know exactly what to hold as truth\nconcerning this grand question.\"\n\n\"Very well, we shall see,\" I replied, feeling myself carried off by\nhis contagious enthusiasm. \"Yes, we shall see; that is, if it is\npossible to see anything there.\"\n\n\"And why not? May we not depend upon electric phenomena to give us\nlight? May we not even expect light from the atmosphere, the pressure\nof which may render it luminous as we approach the centre?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said I; \"that is possible, too.\"\n\n\"It is certain,\" exclaimed my uncle in a tone of triumph. \"But\nsilence, do you hear me? silence upon the whole subject; and let no\none get before us in this design of discovering the centre of the\nearth.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nA WOMAN'S COURAGE\n\n\nThus ended this memorable seance. That conversation threw me into a\nfever. I came out of my uncle's study as if I had been stunned, and\nas if there was not air enough in all the streets of Hamburg to put\nme right again. I therefore made for the banks of the Elbe, where the\nsteamer lands her passengers, which forms the communication between\nthe city and the Hamburg railway.\n\nWas I convinced of the truth of what I had heard? Had I not bent\nunder the iron rule of the Professor Liedenbrock? Was I to believe\nhim in earnest in his intention to penetrate to the centre of this\nmassive globe? Had I been listening to the mad speculations of a\nlunatic, or to the scientific conclusions of a lofty genius? Where\ndid truth stop? Where did error begin?\n\nI was all adrift amongst a thousand contradictory hypotheses, but I\ncould not lay hold of one.\n\nYet I remembered that I had been convinced, although now my\nenthusiasm was beginning to cool down; but I felt a desire to start\nat once, and not to lose time and courage by calm reflection. I had\nat that moment quite courage enough to strap my knapsack to my\nshoulders and start.\n\nBut I must confess that in another hour this unnatural excitement\nabated, my nerves became unstrung, and from the depths of the abysses\nof this earth I ascended to its surface again.\n\n\"It is quite absurd!\" I cried, \"there is no sense about it. No\nsensible young man should for a moment entertain such a proposal. The\nwhole thing is non-existent. I have had a bad night, I have been\ndreaming of horrors.\"\n\nBut I had followed the banks of the Elbe and passed the town. After\npassing the port too, I had reached the Altona road. I was led by a\npresentiment, soon to be realised; for shortly I espied my little\nGr\u00e4uben bravely returning with her light step to Hamburg.\n\n\"Gr\u00e4uben!\" I cried from afar off.\n\nThe young girl stopped, rather frightened perhaps to hear her name\ncalled after her on the high road. Ten yards more, and I had joined\nher.\n\n\"Axel!\" she cried surprised. \"What! have you come to meet me? Is this\nwhy you are here, sir?\"\n\nBut when she had looked upon me, Gr\u00e4uben could not fail to see the\nuneasiness and distress of my mind.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" she said, holding out her hand.\n\n\"What is the matter, Gr\u00e4uben?\" I cried.\n\nIn a couple of minutes my pretty Virlandaise was fully informed of\nthe position of affairs. For a time she was silent. Did her heart\npalpitate as mine did? I don't know about that, but I know that her\nhand did not tremble in mine. We went on a hundred yards without\nspeaking.\n\nAt last she said, \"Axel!\"\n\n\"My dear Gr\u00e4uben.\"\n\n\"That will be a splendid journey!\"\n\nI gave a bound at these words.\n\n\"Yes, Axel, a journey worthy of the nephew of a savant; it is a good\nthing for a man to be distinguished by some great enterprise.\"\n\n\"What, Gr\u00e4uben, won't you dissuade me from such an undertaking?\"\n\n\"No, my dear Axel, and I would willingly go with you, but that a poor\ngirl would only be in your way.\"\n\n\"Is that quite true?\"\n\n\"It is true.\"\n\nAh! women and young girls, how incomprehensible are your feminine\nhearts! When you are not the timidest, you are the bravest of\ncreatures. Reason has nothing to do with your actions. What! did this\nchild encourage me in such an expedition! Would she not be afraid to\njoin it herself? And she was driving me to it, one whom she loved!\n\nI was disconcerted, and, if I must tell the whole truth, I was\nashamed.\n\n\"Gr\u00e4uben, we will see whether you will say the same thing to-morrow.\"\n\n\"To-morrow, dear Axel, I will say what I say to-day.\"\n\nGr\u00e4uben and I, hand in hand, but in silence, pursued our way. The\nemotions of that day were breaking my heart.\n\nAfter all, I thought, the kalends of July are a long way off, and\nbetween this and then many things may take place which will cure my\nuncle of his desire to travel underground.\n\nIt was night when we arrived at the house in K\u00f6nigstrasse. I expected\nto find all quiet there, my uncle in bed as was his custom, and\nMartha giving her last touches with the feather brush.\n\nBut I had not taken into account the Professor's impatience. I found\nhim shouting--and working himself up amidst a crowd of porters and\nmessengers who were all depositing various loads in the passage. Our\nold servant was at her wits' end.\n\n\"Come, Axel, come, you miserable wretch,\" my uncle cried from as far\noff as he could see me. \"Your boxes are not packed, and my papers are\nnot arranged; where's the key of my carpet bag? and what have you\ndone with my gaiters?\"\n\nI stood thunderstruck. My voice failed. Scarcely could my lips utter\nthe words:\n\n\"Are we really going?\"\n\n\"Of course, you unhappy boy! Could I have dreamed that you would have\ngone out for a walk instead of hurrying your preparations forward?\"\n\n\"Are we to go?\" I asked again, with sinking hopes.\n\n\"Yes; the day after to-morrow, early.\"\n\nI could hear no more. I fled for refuge into my own little room.\n\nAll hope was now at an end. My uncle had been all the morning making\npurchases of a part of the tools and apparatus required for this\ndesperate undertaking. The passage was encumbered with rope ladders,\nknotted cords, torches, flasks, grappling irons, alpenstocks,\npickaxes, iron shod sticks, enough to load ten men.\n\nI spent an awful night. Next morning I was called early. I had quite\ndecided I would not open the door. But how was I to resist the sweet\nvoice which was always music to my ears, saying, \"My dear Axel?\"\n\nI came out of my room. I thought my pale countenance and my red and\nsleepless eyes would work upon Gr\u00e4uben's sympathies and change her\nmind.\n\n\"Ah! my dear Axel,\" she said. \"I see you are better. A night's rest\nhas done you good.\"\n\n\"Done me good!\" I exclaimed.\n\nI rushed to the glass. Well, in fact I did look better than I had\nexpected. I could hardly believe my own eyes.\n\n\"Axel,\" she said, \"I have had a long talk with my guardian. He is a\nbold philosopher, a man of immense courage, and you must remember\nthat his blood flows in your veins. He has confided to me his plans,\nhis hopes, and why and how he hopes to attain his object. He will no\ndoubt succeed. My dear Axel, it is a grand thing to devote yourself\nto science! What honour will fall upon Herr Liedenbrock, and so be\nreflected upon his companion! When you return, Axel, you will be a\nman, his equal, free to speak and to act independently, and free to\n--\"\n\nThe dear girl only finished this sentence by blushing. Her words\nrevived me. Yet I refused to believe we should start. I drew Gr\u00e4uben\ninto the Professor's study.\n\n\"Uncle, is it true that we are to go?\"\n\n\"Why do you doubt?\"\n\n\"Well, I don't doubt,\" I said, not to vex him; \"but, I ask, what need\nis there to hurry?\"\n\n\"Time, time, flying with irreparable rapidity.\"\n\n\"But it is only the 16th May, and until the end of June--\"\n\n\"What, you monument of ignorance! do you think you can get to Iceland\nin a couple of days? If you had not deserted me like a fool I should\nhave taken you to the Copenhagen office, to Liffender & Co., and you\nwould have learned then that there is only one trip every month from\nCopenhagen to Rejkiavik, on the 22nd.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Well, if we waited for the 22nd June we should be too late to see\nthe shadow of Scartaris touch the crater of Sneffels. Therefore we\nmust get to Copenhagen as fast as we can to secure our passage. Go\nand pack up.\"\n\nThere was no reply to this. I went up to my room. Gr\u00e4uben followed\nme. She undertook to pack up all things necessary for my voyage. She\nwas no more moved than if I had been starting for a little trip to\nL\u00fcbeck or Heligoland. Her little hands moved without haste. She\ntalked quietly. She supplied me with sensible reasons for our\nexpedition. She delighted me, and yet I was angry with her. Now and\nthen I felt I ought to break out into a passion, but she took no\nnotice and went on her way as methodically as ever.\n\nFinally the last strap was buckled; I came downstairs. All that day\nthe philosophical instrument makers and the electricians kept coming\nand going. Martha was distracted.\n\n\"Is master mad?\" she asked.\n\nI nodded my head.\n\n\"And is he going to take you with him?\"\n\nI nodded again.\n\n\"Where to?\"\n\nI pointed with my finger downward.\n\n\"Down into the cellar?\" cried the old servant.\n\n\"No,\" I said. \"Lower down than that.\"\n\nNight came. But I knew nothing about the lapse of time.\n\n\"To-morrow morning at six precisely,\" my uncle decreed \"we start.\"\n\nAt ten o'clock I fell upon my bed, a dead lump of inert matter. All\nthrough the night terror had hold of me. I spent it dreaming of\nabysses. I was a prey to delirium. I felt myself grasped by the\nProfessor's sinewy hand, dragged along, hurled down, shattered into\nlittle bits. I dropped down unfathomable precipices with the\naccelerating velocity of bodies falling through space. My life had\nbecome an endless fall. I awoke at five with shattered nerves,\ntrembling and weary. I came downstairs. My uncle was at table,\ndevouring his breakfast. I stared at him with horror and disgust. But\ndear Gr\u00e4uben was there; so I said nothing, and could eat nothing.\n\nAt half-past five there was a rattle of wheels outside. A large\ncarriage was there to take us to the Altona railway station. It was\nsoon piled up with my uncle's multifarious preparations.\n\n\"Where's your box?\" he cried.\n\n\"It is ready,\" I replied, with faltering voice.\n\n\"Then make haste down, or we shall lose the train.\"\n\nIt was now manifestly impossible to maintain the struggle against\ndestiny. I went up again to my room, and rolling my portmanteaus\ndownstairs I darted after him.\n\nAt that moment my uncle was solemnly investing Gr\u00e4uben with the reins\nof government. My pretty Virlandaise was as calm and collected as was\nher wont. She kissed her guardian; but could not restrain a tear in\ntouching my cheek with her gentle lips.\n\n\"Gr\u00e4uben!\" I murmured.\n\n\"Go, my dear Axel, go! I am now your betrothed; and when you come\nback I will be your wife.\"\n\nI pressed her in my arms and took my place in the carriage. Martha\nand the young girl, standing at the door, waved their last farewell.\nThen the horses, roused by the driver's whistling, darted off at a\ngallop on the road to Altona.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nSERIOUS PREPARATIONS FOR VERTICAL DESCENT\n\n\nAltona, which is but a suburb of Hamburg, is the terminus of the Kiel\nrailway, which was to carry us to the Belts. In twenty minutes we\nwere in Holstein.\n\nAt half-past six the carriage stopped at the station; my uncle's\nnumerous packages, his voluminous _impedimenta,_ were unloaded,\nremoved, labelled, weighed, put into the luggage vans, and at seven\nwe were seated face to face in our compartment. The whistle sounded,\nthe engine started, we were off.\n\nWas I resigned? No, not yet. Yet the cool morning air and the scenes\non the road, rapidly changed by the swiftness of the train, drew me\naway somewhat from my sad reflections.\n\nAs for the Professor's reflections, they went far in advance of the\nswiftest express. We were alone in the carriage, but we sat in\nsilence. My uncle examined all his pockets and his travelling bag\nwith the minutest care. I saw that he had not forgotten the smallest\nmatter of detail.\n\nAmongst other documents, a sheet of paper, carefully folded, bore the\nheading of the Danish consulate with the signature of W.\nChristiensen, consul at Hamburg and the Professor's friend. With this\nwe possessed the proper introductions to the Governor of Iceland.\n\nI also observed the famous document most carefully laid up in a\nsecret pocket in his portfolio. I bestowed a malediction upon it, and\nthen proceeded to examine the country.\n\nIt was a very long succession of uninteresting loamy and fertile\nflats, a very easy country for the construction of railways, and\npropitious for the laying-down of these direct level lines so dear to\nrailway companies.\n\nI had no time to get tired of the monotony; for in three hours we\nstopped at Kiel, close to the sea.\n\nThe luggage being labelled for Copenhagen, we had no occasion to look\nafter it. Yet the Professor watched every article with jealous\nvigilance, until all were safe on board. There they disappeared in\nthe hold.\n\nMy uncle, notwithstanding his hurry, had so well calculated the\nrelations between the train and the steamer that we had a whole day\nto spare. The steamer _Ellenora,_ did not start until night. Thence\nsprang a feverish state of excitement in which the impatient\nirascible traveller devoted to perdition the railway directors and\nthe steamboat companies and the governments which allowed such\nintolerable slowness. I was obliged to act chorus to him when he\nattacked the captain of the _Ellenora_ upon this subject. The captain\ndisposed of us summarily.\n\nAt Kiel, as elsewhere, we must do something to while away the time.\nWhat with walking on the verdant shores of the bay within which\nnestles the little town, exploring the thick woods which make it look\nlike a nest embowered amongst thick foliage, admiring the villas,\neach provided with a little bathing house, and moving about and\ngrumbling, at last ten o'clock came.\n\nThe heavy coils of smoke from the _Ellenora's_ funnel unrolled in the\nsky, the bridge shook with the quivering of the struggling steam; we\nwere on board, and owners for the time of two berths, one over the\nother, in the only saloon cabin on board.\n\nAt a quarter past the moorings were loosed and the throbbing steamer\npursued her way over the dark waters of the Great Belt.\n\nThe night was dark; there was a sharp breeze and a rough sea, a few\nlights appeared on shore through the thick darkness; later on, I\ncannot tell when, a dazzling light from some lighthouse threw a\nbright stream of fire along the waves; and this is all I can remember\nof this first portion of our sail.\n\nAt seven in the morning we landed at Korsor, a small town on the west\ncoast of Zealand. There we were transferred from the boat to another\nline of railway, which took us by just as flat a country as the plain\nof Holstein.\n\nThree hours' travelling brought us to the capital of Denmark. My\nuncle had not shut his eyes all night. In his impatience I believe he\nwas trying to accelerate the train with his feet.\n\nAt last he discerned a stretch of sea.\n\n\"The Sound!\" he cried.\n\nAt our left was a huge building that looked like a hospital.\n\n\"That's a lunatic asylum,\" said one of or travelling companions.\n\nVery good! thought I, just the place we want to end our days in; and\ngreat as it is, that asylum is not big enough to contain all\nProfessor Liedenbrock's madness!\n\nAt ten in the morning, at last, we set our feet in Copenhagen; the\nluggage was put upon a carriage and taken with ourselves to the\nPhoenix Hotel in Breda Gate. This took half an hour, for the station\nis out of the town. Then my uncle, after a hasty toilet, dragged me\nafter him. The porter at the hotel could speak German and English;\nbut the Professor, as a polyglot, questioned him in good Danish, and\nit was in the same language that that personage directed him to the\nMuseum of Northern Antiquities.\n\nThe curator of this curious establishment, in which wonders are\ngathered together out of which the ancient history of the country\nmight be reconstructed by means of its stone weapons, its cups and\nits jewels, was a learned savant, the friend of the Danish consul at\nHamburg, Professor Thomsen.\n\nMy uncle had a cordial letter of introduction to him. As a general\nrule one savant greets another with coolness. But here the case was\ndifferent. M. Thomsen, like a good friend, gave the Professor\nLiedenbrock a cordial greeting, and he even vouchsafed the same\nkindness to his nephew. It is hardly necessary to say the secret was\nsacredly kept from the excellent curator; we were simply\ndisinterested travellers visiting Iceland out of harmless curiosity.\n\nM. Thomsen placed his services at our disposal, and we visited the\nquays with the object of finding out the next vessel to sail.\n\nI was yet in hopes that there would be no means of getting to\nIceland. But there was no such luck. A small Danish schooner, the\n_Valkyria_, was to set sail for Rejkiavik on the 2nd of June. The\ncaptain, M. Bjarne, was on board. His intending passenger was so\njoyful that he almost squeezed his hands till they ached. That good\nman was rather surprised at his energy. To him it seemed a very\nsimple thing to go to Iceland, as that was his business; but to my\nuncle it was sublime. The worthy captain took advantage of his\nenthusiasm to charge double fares; but we did not trouble ourselves\nabout mere trifles. .\n\n\"You must be on board on Tuesday, at seven in the morning,\" said\nCaptain Bjarne, after having pocketed more dollars than were his due.\n\nThen we thanked M. Thomsen for his kindness, \"and we returned to the\nPhoenix Hotel.\n\n\"It's all right, it's all right,\" my uncle repeated. \"How fortunate\nwe are to have found this boat ready for sailing. Now let us have\nsome breakfast and go about the town.\"\n\nWe went first to Kongens-nye-Torw, an irregular square in which are\ntwo innocent-looking guns, which need not alarm any one. Close by, at\nNo. 5, there was a French \"restaurant,\" kept by a cook of the name of\nVincent, where we had an ample breakfast for four marks each (2_s_.\n4_d_.).\n\nThen I took a childish pleasure in exploring the city; my uncle let\nme take him with me, but he took notice of nothing, neither the\ninsignificant king's palace, nor the pretty seventeenth century\nbridge, which spans the canal before the museum, nor that immense\ncenotaph of Thorwaldsen's, adorned with horrible mural painting, and\ncontaining within it a collection of the sculptor's works, nor in a\nfine park the toylike chateau of Rosenberg, nor the beautiful\nrenaissance edifice of the Exchange, nor its spire composed of the\ntwisted tails of four bronze dragons, nor the great windmill on the\nramparts, whose huge arms dilated in the sea breeze like the sails of\na ship.\n\nWhat delicious walks we should have had together, my pretty\nVirlandaise and I, along the harbour where the two-deckers and the\nfrigate slept peaceably by the red roofing of the warehouse, by the\ngreen banks of the strait, through the deep shades of the trees\namongst which the fort is half concealed, where the guns are\nthrusting out their black throats between branches of alder and\nwillow.\n\nBut, alas! Gr\u00e4uben was far away; and I never hoped to see her again.\n\nBut if my uncle felt no attraction towards these romantic scenes he\nwas very much struck with the aspect of a certain church spire\nsituated in the island of Amak, which forms the south-west quarter of\nCopenhagen.\n\nI was ordered to direct my feet that way; I embarked on a small\nsteamer which plies on the canals, and in a few minutes she touched\nthe quay of the dockyard.\n\nAfter crossing a few narrow streets where some convicts, in trousers\nhalf yellow and half grey, were at work under the orders of the\ngangers, we arrived at the Vor Frelsers Kirk. There was nothing\nremarkable about the church; but there was a reason why its tall\nspire had attracted the Professor's attention. Starting from the top\nof the tower, an external staircase wound around the spire, the\nspirals circling up into the sky.\n\n\"Let us get to the top,\" said my uncle.\n\n\"I shall be dizzy,\" I said.\n\n\"The more reason why we should go up; we must get used to it.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Come, I tell you; don't waste our time.\"\n\nI had to obey. A keeper who lived at the other end of the street\nhanded us the key, and the ascent began.\n\nMy uncle went ahead with a light step. I followed him not without\nalarm, for my head was very apt to feel dizzy; I possessed neither\nthe equilibrium of an eagle nor his fearless nature.\n\nAs long as we were protected on the inside of the winding staircase\nup the tower, all was well enough; but after toiling up a hundred and\nfifty steps the fresh air came to salute my face, and we were on the\nleads of the tower. There the aerial staircase began its gyrations,\nonly guarded by a thin iron rail, and the narrowing steps seemed to\nascend into infinite space!\n\n\"Never shall I be able to do it,\" I said.\n\n\"Don't be a coward; come up, sir\"; said my uncle with the coldest\ncruelty.\n\nI had to follow, clutching at every step. The keen air made me giddy;\nI felt the spire rocking with every gust of wind; my knees began to\nfail; soon I was crawling on my knees, then creeping on my stomach; I\nclosed my eyes; I seemed to be lost in space.\n\nAt last I reached the apex, with the assistance of my uncle dragging\nme up by the collar.\n\n\"Look down!\" he cried. \"Look down well! You must take a lesson\nin abysses.\"\n\nI opened my eyes. I saw houses squashed flat as if they had all\nfallen down from the skies; a smoke fog seemed to drown them. Over my\nhead ragged clouds were drifting past, and by an optical inversion\nthey seemed stationary, while the steeple, the ball and I were all\nspinning along with fantastic speed. Far away on one side was the\ngreen country, on the other the sea sparkled, bathed in sunlight. The\nSound stretched away to Elsinore, dotted with a few white sails, like\nsea-gulls' wings; and in the misty east and away to the north-east\nlay outstretched the faintly-shadowed shores of Sweden. All this\nimmensity of space whirled and wavered, fluctuating beneath my eyes.\n\nBut I was compelled to rise, to stand up, to look. My first lesson in\ndizziness lasted an hour. When I got permission to come down and feel\nthe solid street pavements I was afflicted with severe lumbago.\n\n\"To-morrow we will do it again,\" said the Professor.\n\nAnd it was so; for five days in succession, I was obliged to undergo\nthis anti-vertiginous exercise; and whether I would or not, I made\nsome improvement in the art of \"lofty contemplations.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nICELAND! BUT WHAT NEXT?\n\n\nThe day for our departure arrived. The day before it our kind friend\nM. Thomsen brought us letters of introduction to Count Trampe, the\nGovernor of Iceland, M. Picturssen, the bishop's suffragan, and M.\nFinsen, mayor of Rejkiavik. My uncle expressed his gratitude by\ntremendous compressions of both his hands.\n\nOn the 2nd, at six in the evening, all our precious baggage being\nsafely on board the _Valkyria,_ the captain took us into a very\nnarrow cabin.\n\n\"Is the wind favourable?\" my uncle asked.\n\n\"Excellent,\" replied Captain Bjarne; \"a sou'-easter. We shall pass\ndown the Sound full speed, with all sails set.\"\n\nIn a few minutes the schooner, under her mizen, brigantine, topsail,\nand topgallant sail, loosed from her moorings and made full sail\nthrough the straits. In an hour the capital of Denmark seemed to sink\nbelow the distant waves, and the _Valkyria_ was skirting the coast by\nElsinore. In my nervous frame of mind I expected to see the ghost of\nHamlet wandering on the legendary castle terrace.\n\n\"Sublime madman!\" I said, \"no doubt you would approve of our\nexpedition. Perhaps you would keep us company to the centre of the\nglobe, to find the solution of your eternal doubts.\"\n\nBut there was no ghostly shape upon the ancient walls. Indeed, the\ncastle is much younger than the heroic prince of Denmark. It now\nanswers the purpose of a sumptuous lodge for the doorkeeper of the\nstraits of the Sound, before which every year there pass fifteen\nthousand ships of all nations.\n\nThe castle of Kronsberg soon disappeared in the mist, as well as the\ntower of Helsingborg, built on the Swedish coast, and the schooner\npassed lightly on her way urged by the breezes of the Cattegat.\n\nThe _Valkyria_ was a splendid sailer, but on a sailing vessel you can\nplace no dependence. She was taking to Rejkiavik coal, household\ngoods, earthenware, woollen clothing, and a cargo of wheat. The crew\nconsisted of five men, all Danes.\n\n\"How long will the passage take?\" my uncle asked.\n\n\"Ten days,\" the captain replied, \"if we don't meet a nor'-wester in\npassing the Faroes.\"\n\n\"But are you not subject to considerable delays?\"\n\n\"No, M. Liedenbrock, don't be uneasy, we shall get there in very good\ntime.\"\n\nAt evening the schooner doubled the Skaw at the northern point of\nDenmark, in the night passed the Skager Rack, skirted Norway by Cape\nLindness, and entered the North Sea.\n\nIn two days more we sighted the coast of Scotland near Peterhead, and\nthe _Valkyria_ turned her lead towards the Faroe Islands, passing\nbetween the Orkneys and Shetlands.\n\nSoon the schooner encountered the great Atlantic swell; she had to\ntack against the north wind, and reached the Faroes only with some\ndifficulty. On the 8th the captain made out Myganness, the\nsouthernmost of these islands, and from that moment took a straight\ncourse for Cape Portland, the most southerly point of Iceland.\n\nThe passage was marked by nothing unusual. I bore the troubles of the\nsea pretty well; my uncle, to his own intense disgust, and his\ngreater shame, was ill all through the voyage.\n\nHe therefore was unable to converse with the captain about Sn\u00e6fell,\nthe way to get to it, the facilities for transport, he was obliged to\nput off these inquiries until his arrival, and spent all his time at\nfull length in his cabin, of which the timbers creaked and shook with\nevery pitch she took. It must be confessed he was not undeserving of\nhis punishment.\n\nOn the 11th we reached Cape Portland. The clear open weather gave us\na good view of Myrdals jokul, which overhangs it. The cape is merely\na low hill with steep sides, standing lonely by the beach.\n\nThe _Valkyria_ kept at some distance from the coast, taking a\nwesterly course amidst great shoals of whales and sharks. Soon we\ncame in sight of an enormous perforated rock, through which the sea\ndashed furiously. The Westman islets seemed to rise out of the ocean\nlike a group of rocks in a liquid plain. From that time the schooner\ntook a wide berth and swept at a great distance round Cape\nRejkianess, which forms the western point of Iceland.\n\nThe rough sea prevented my uncle from coming on deck to admire these\nshattered and surf-beaten coasts.\n\nForty-eight hours after, coming out of a storm which forced the\nschooner to scud under bare poles, we sighted east of us the beacon\non Cape Skagen, where dangerous rocks extend far away seaward. An\nIcelandic pilot came on board, and in three hours the _Valkyria_\ndropped her anchor before Rejkiavik, in Faxa Bay.\n\nThe Professor at last emerged from his cabin, rather pale and\nwretched-looking, but still full of enthusiasm, and with ardent\nsatisfaction shining in his eyes.\n\nThe population of the town, wonderfully interested in the arrival of\na vessel from which every one expected something, formed in groups\nupon the quay.\n\nMy uncle left in haste his floating prison, or rather hospital. But\nbefore quitting the deck of the schooner he dragged me forward, and\npointing with outstretched finger north of the bay at a distant\nmountain terminating in a double peak, a pair of cones covered with\nperpetual snow, he cried:\n\n\"Sn\u00e6fell! Sn\u00e6fell!\"\n\nThen recommending me, by an impressive gesture, to keep silence, he\nwent into the boat which awaited him. I followed, and presently we\nwere treading the soil of Iceland.\n\nThe first man we saw was a good-looking fellow enough, in a general's\nuniform. Yet he was not a general but a magistrate, the Governor of\nthe island, M. le Baron Trampe himself. The Professor was soon aware\nof the presence he was in. He delivered him his letters from\nCopenhagen, and then followed a short conversation in the Danish\nlanguage, the purport of which I was quite ignorant of, and for a\nvery good reason. But the result of this first conversation was, that\nBaron Trampe placed himself entirely at the service of Professor\nLiedenbrock.\n\nMy uncle was just as courteously received by the mayor, M. Finsen,\nwhose appearance was as military, and disposition and office as\npacific, as the Governor's.\n\nAs for the bishop's suffragan, M. Picturssen, he was at that moment\nengaged on an episcopal visitation in the north. For the time we must\nbe resigned to wait for the honour of being presented to him. But M.\nFridrikssen, professor of natural sciences at the school of\nRejkiavik, was a delightful man, and his friendship became very\nprecious to me. This modest philosopher spoke only Danish and Latin.\nHe came to proffer me his good offices in the language of Horace, and\nI felt that we were made to understand each other. In fact he was the\nonly person in Iceland with whom I could converse at all.\n\nThis good-natured gentleman made over to us two of the three rooms\nwhich his house contained, and we were soon installed in it with all\nour luggage, the abundance of which rather astonished the good people\nof Rejkiavik.\n\n\"Well, Axel,\" said my uncle, \"we are getting on, and now the worst is\nover.\"\n\n\"The worst!\" I said, astonished.\n\n\"To be sure, now we have nothing to do but go down.\"\n\n\"Oh, if that is all, you are quite right; but after all, when we have\ngone down, we shall have to get up again, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Oh I don't trouble myself about that. Come, there's no time to lose;\nI am going to the library. Perhaps there is some manuscript of\nSaknussemm's there, and I should be glad to consult it.\"\n\n\"Well, while you are there I will go into the town. Won't you?\"\n\n\"Oh, that is very uninteresting to me. It is not what is upon this\nisland, but what is underneath, that interests me.\"\n\nI went out, and wandered wherever chance took me.\n\nIt would not be easy to lose your way in Rejkiavik. I was therefore\nunder no necessity to inquire the road, which exposes one to mistakes\nwhen the only medium of intercourse is gesture.\n\nThe town extends along a low and marshy level, between two hills. An\nimmense bed of lava bounds it on one side, and falls gently towards\nthe sea. On the other extends the vast bay of Faxa, shut in at the\nnorth by the enormous glacier of the Sn\u00e6fell, and of which the\n_Valkyria_ was for the time the only occupant. Usually the English\nand French conservators of fisheries moor in this bay, but just then\nthey were cruising about the western coasts of the island.\n\nThe longest of the only two streets that Rejkiavik possesses was\nparallel with the beach. Here live the merchants and traders, in\nwooden cabins made of red planks set horizontally; the other street,\nrunning west, ends at the little lake between the house of the bishop\nand other non-commercial people.\n\nI had soon explored these melancholy ways; here and there I got a\nglimpse of faded turf, looking like a worn-out bit of carpet, or some\nappearance of a kitchen garden, the sparse vegetables of which\n(potatoes, cabbages, and lettuces), would have figured appropriately\nupon a Lilliputian table. A few sickly wallflowers were trying to\nenjoy the air and sunshine.\n\nAbout the middle of the tin-commercial street I found the public\ncemetery, inclosed with a mud wall, and where there seemed plenty of\nroom.\n\nThen a few steps brought me to the Governor's house, a but compared\nwith the town hall of Hamburg, a palace in comparison with the cabins\nof the Icelandic population.\n\nBetween the little lake and the town the church is built in the\nProtestant style, of calcined stones extracted out of the volcanoes\nby their own labour and at their own expense; in high westerly winds\nit was manifest that the red tiles of the roof would be scattered in\nthe air, to the great danger of the faithful worshippers.\n\nOn a neighbouring hill I perceived the national school, where, as I\nwas informed later by our host, were taught Hebrew, English, French,\nand Danish, four languages of which, with shame I confess it, I don't\nknow a single word; after an examination I should have had to stand\nlast of the forty scholars educated at this little college, and I\nshould have been held unworthy to sleep along with them in one of\nthose little double closets, where more delicate youths would have\ndied of suffocation the very first night.\n\nIn three hours I had seen not only the town but its environs. The\ngeneral aspect was wonderfully dull. No trees, and scarcely any\nvegetation. Everywhere bare rocks, signs of volcanic action. The\nIcelandic huts are made of earth and turf, and the walls slope\ninward; they rather resemble roofs placed on the ground. But then\nthese roofs are meadows of comparative fertility. Thanks to the\ninternal heat, the grass grows on them to some degree of perfection.\nIt is carefully mown in the hay season; if it were not, the horses\nwould come to pasture on these green abodes.\n\nIn my excursion I met but few people. On returning to the main street\nI found the greater part of the population busied in drying, salting,\nand putting on board codfish, their chief export. The men looked like\nrobust but heavy, blond Germans with pensive eyes, conscious of being\nfar removed from their fellow creatures, poor exiles relegated to\nthis land of ice, poor creatures who should have been Esquimaux,\nsince nature had condemned them to live only just outside the arctic\ncircle! In vain did I try to detect a smile upon their lips;\nsometimes by a spasmodic and involuntary contraction of the muscles\nthey seemed to laugh, but they never smiled.\n\nTheir costume consisted of a coarse jacket of black woollen cloth\ncalled in Scandinavian lands a 'vadmel,' a hat with a very broad\nbrim, trousers with a narrow edge of red, and a bit of leather rolled\nround the foot for shoes.\n\nThe women looked as sad and as resigned as the men; their faces were\nagreeable but expressionless, and they wore gowns and petticoats of\ndark 'vadmel'; as maidens, they wore over their braided hair a little\nknitted brown cap; when married, they put around their heads a\ncoloured handkerchief, crowned with a peak of white linen.\n\nAfter a good walk I returned to M. Fridrikssen's house, where I found\nmy uncle already in his host's company.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nINTERESTING CONVERSATIONS WITH ICELANDIC SAVANTS\n\n\nDinner was ready. Professor Liedenbrock devoured his portion\nvoraciously, for his compulsory fast on board had converted his\nstomach into a vast unfathomable gulf. There was nothing remarkable\nin the meal itself; but the hospitality of our host, more Danish than\nIcelandic, reminded me of the heroes of old. It was evident that we\nwere more at home than he was himself.\n\nThe conversation was carried on in the vernacular tongue, which my\nuncle mixed with German and M. Fridrikssen with Latin for my benefit.\nIt turned upon scientific questions as befits philosophers; but\nProfessor Liedenbrock was excessively reserved, and at every sentence\nspoke to me with his eyes, enjoining the most absolute silence upon\nour plans.\n\nIn the first place M. Fridrikssen wanted to know what success my\nuncle had had at the library.\n\n\"Your library! why there is nothing but a few tattered books upon\nalmost deserted shelves.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" replied M. Fridrikssen, \"why we possess eight thousand\nvolumes, many of them valuable and scarce, works in the old\nScandinavian language, and we have all the novelties that Copenhagen\nsends us every year.\"\n\n\"Where do you keep your eight thousand volumes? For my part--\"\n\n\"Oh, M. Liedenbrock, they are all over the country. In this icy\nregion we are fond of study. There is not a farmer nor a fisherman\nthat cannot read and does not read. Our principle is, that books,\ninstead of growing mouldy behind an iron grating, should be worn out\nunder the eyes of many readers. Therefore, these volumes are passed\nfrom one to another, read over and over, referred to again and again;\nand it often happens that they find their way back to their shelves\nonly after an absence of a year or two.\"\n\n\"And in the meantime,\" said my uncle rather spitefully, \"strangers--\"\n\n\"Well, what would you have? Foreigners have their libraries at home,\nand the first essential for labouring people is that they should be\neducated. I repeat to you the love of reading runs in Icelandic\nblood. In 1816 we founded a prosperous literary society; learned\nstrangers think themselves honoured in becoming members of it. It\npublishes books which educate our fellow-countrymen, and do the\ncountry great service. If you will consent to be a corresponding\nmember, Herr Liedenbrock, you will be giving us great pleasure.\"\n\nMy uncle, who had already joined about a hundred learned societies,\naccepted with a grace which evidently touched M. Fridrikssen.\n\n\"Now,\" said he, \"will you be kind enough to tell me what books you\nhoped to find in our library and I may perhaps enable you to consult\nthem?\"\n\nMy uncle's eyes and mine met. He hesitated. This direct question went\nto the root of the matter. But after a moment's reflection he decided\non speaking.\n\n\"Monsieur Fridrikssen, I wished to know if amongst your ancient books\nyou possessed any of the works of Arne Saknussemm?\"\n\n\"Arne Saknussemm!\" replied the Rejkiavik professor. \"You mean that\nlearned sixteenth century savant, a naturalist, a chemist, and a\ntraveller?\"\n\n\"Just so!\"\n\n\"One of the glories of Icelandic literature and science?\"\n\n\"That's the man.\"\n\n\"An illustrious man anywhere!\"\n\n\"Quite so.\"\n\n\"And whose courage was equal to his genius!\"\n\n\"I see that you know him well.\"\n\nMy uncle was bathed in delight at hearing his hero thus described. He\nfeasted his eyes upon M. Fridrikssen's face.\n\n\"Well,\" he cried, \"where are his works?\"\n\n\"His works, we have them not.\"\n\n\"What--not in Iceland?\"\n\n\"They are neither in Iceland nor anywhere else.\"\n\n\"Why is that?\"\n\n\"Because Arne Saknussemm was persecuted for heresy, and in 1573 his\nbooks were burned by the hands of the common hangman.\"\n\n\"Very good! Excellent!\" cried my uncle, to the great scandal of the\nprofessor of natural history.\n\n\"What!\" he cried.\n\n\"Yes, yes; now it is all clear, now it is all unravelled; and I see\nwhy Saknussemm, put into the Index Expurgatorius, and compelled to\nhide the discoveries made by his genius, was obliged to bury in an\nincomprehensible cryptogram the secret--\"\n\n\"What secret?\" asked M. Fridrikssen, starting.\n\n\"Oh, just a secret which--\" my uncle stammered.\n\n\"Have you some private document in your possession?\" asked our host.\n\n\"No; I was only supposing a case.\"\n\n\"Oh, very well,\" answered M. Fridrikssen, who was kind enough not to\npursue the subject when he had noticed the embarrassment of his\nfriend. \"I hope you will not leave our island until you have seen\nsome of its mineralogical wealth.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" replied my uncle; \"but I am rather late; or have not\nothers been here before me?\"\n\n\"Yes, Herr Liedenbrock; the labours of MM. Olafsen and Povelsen,\npursued by order of the king, the researches of Tro\u00efl the scientific\nmission of MM. Gaimard and Robert on the French corvette _La\nRecherche,_ [1] and lately the observations of scientific men who\ncame in the _Reine Hortense,_ have added materially to our knowledge\nof Iceland. But I assure you there is plenty left.\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\" said my uncle, pretending to look very modest, and\ntrying to hide the curiosity was flashing out of his eyes.\n\n\"Oh, yes; how many mountains, glaciers, and volcanoes there are to\nstudy, which are as yet but imperfectly known! Then, without going\nany further, that mountain in the horizon. That is Sn\u00e6fell.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said my uncle, as coolly as he was able, \"is that Sn\u00e6fell?\"\n\n\"Yes; one of the most curious volcanoes, and the crater of which has\nscarcely ever been visited.\"\n\n\"Is it extinct?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; more than five hundred years.\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied my uncle, who was frantically locking his legs together\nto keep himself from jumping up in the air, \"that is where I mean to\nbegin my geological studies, there on that Seffel--Fessel--what do you\ncall it?\"\n\n\"Sn\u00e6fell,\" replied the excellent M. Fridrikssen.\n\nThis part of the conversation was in Latin; I had understood every\nword of it, and I could hardly conceal my amusement at seeing my\nuncle trying to keep down the excitement and satisfaction which were\nbrimming over in every limb and every feature. He tried hard to put\non an innocent little expression of simplicity; but it looked like a\ndiabolical grin.\n\n[1] _Recherche_ was sent out in 1835 by Admiral Duperr\u00e9 to learn the\nfate of the lost expedition of M. de Blosseville in the _Lilloise_\nwhich has never been heard of.\n\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"your words decide me. We will try to scale that\nSn\u00e6fell; perhaps even we may pursue our studies in its crater!\"\n\n\"I am very sorry,\" said M. Fridrikssen, \"that my engagements will not\nallow me to absent myself, or I would have accompanied you myself\nwith both pleasure and profit.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, no!\" replied my uncle with great animation, \"we would not\ndisturb any one for the world, M. Fridrikssen. Still, I thank you\nwith all my heart: the company of such a talented man would have been\nvery serviceable, but the duties of your profession--\"\n\nI am glad to think that our host, in the innocence of his Icelandic\nsoul, was blind to the transparent artifices of my uncle.\n\n\"I very much approve of your beginning with that volcano, M.\nLiedenbrock. You will gather a harvest of interesting observations.\nBut, tell me, how do you expect to get to the peninsula of Sn\u00e6fell?\"\n\n\"By sea, crossing the bay. That's the most direct way.\"\n\n\"No doubt; but it is impossible.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because we don't possess a single boat at Rejkiavik.\"\n\n\"You don't mean to say so?\"\n\n\"You will have to go by land, following the shore. It will be longer,\nbut more interesting.\"\n\n\"Very well, then; and now I shall have to see about a guide.\"\n\n\"I have one to offer you.\"\n\n\"A safe, intelligent man.\"\n\n\"Yes; an inhabitant of that peninsula. He is an eider-down hunter, and\nvery clever. He speaks Danish perfectly.\"\n\n\"When can I see him?\"\n\n\"To-morrow, if you like.\"\n\n\"Why not to-day?\"\n\n\"Because he won't be here till to-morrow.\"\n\n\"To-morrow, then,\" added my uncle with a sigh.\n\nThis momentous conversation ended in a few minutes with warm\nacknowledgments paid by the German to the Icelandic Professor. At\nthis dinner my uncle had just elicited important facts, amongst\nothers, the history of Saknussemm, the reason of the mysterious\ndocument, that his host would not accompany him in his expedition,\nand that the very next day a guide would be waiting upon him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nA GUIDE FOUND TO THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH\n\n\nIn the evening I took a short walk on the beach and returned at night\nto my plank-bed, where I slept soundly all night.\n\nWhen I awoke I heard my uncle talking at a great rate in the next\nroom. I immediately dressed and joined him.\n\nHe was conversing in the Danish language with a tall man, of robust\nbuild. This fine fellow must have been possessed of great strength.\nHis eyes, set in a large and ingenuous face, seemed to me very\nintelligent; they were of a dreamy sea-blue. Long hair, which would\nhave been called red even in England, fell in long meshes upon his\nbroad shoulders. The movements of this native were lithe and supple;\nbut he made little use of his arms in speaking, like a man who knew\nnothing or cared nothing about the language of gestures. His whole\nappearance bespoke perfect calmness and self-possession, not\nindolence but tranquillity. It was felt at once that he would be\nbeholden to nobody, that he worked for his own convenience, and that\nnothing in this world could astonish or disturb his philosophic\ncalmness.\n\nI caught the shades of this Icelander's character by the way in which\nhe listened to the impassioned flow of words which fell from the\nProfessor. He stood with arms crossed, perfectly unmoved by my\nuncle's incessant gesticulations. A negative was expressed by a slow\nmovement of the head from left to right, an affirmative by a slight\nbend, so slight that his long hair scarcely moved. He carried economy\nof motion even to parsimony.\n\nCertainly I should never have dreamt in looking at this man that he\nwas a hunter; he did not look likely to frighten his game, nor did he\nseem as if he would even get near it. But the mystery was explained\nwhen M. Fridrikssen informed me that this tranquil personage was only\na hunter of the eider duck, whose under plumage constitutes the chief\nwealth of the island. This is the celebrated eider down, and it\nrequires no great rapidity of movement to get it.\n\nEarly in summer the female, a very pretty bird, goes to build her\nnest among the rocks of the fiords with which the coast is fringed.\nAfter building the nest she feathers it with down plucked from her\nown breast. Immediately the hunter, or rather the trader, comes and\nrobs the nest, and the female recommences her work. This goes on as\nlong as she has any down left. When she has stripped herself bare the\nmale takes his turn to pluck himself. But as the coarse and hard\nplumage of the male has no commercial value, the hunter does not take\nthe trouble to rob the nest of this; the female therefore lays her\neggs in the spoils of her mate, the young are hatched, and next year\nthe harvest begins again.\n\nNow, as the eider duck does not select steep cliffs for her nest, but\nrather the smooth terraced rocks which slope to the sea, the\nIcelandic hunter might exercise his calling without any inconvenient\nexertion. He was a farmer who was not obliged either to sow or reap\nhis harvest, but merely to gather it in.\n\nThis grave, phlegmatic, and silent individual was called Hans Bjelke;\nand he came recommended by M. Fridrikssen. He was our future guide.\nHis manners were a singular contrast with my uncle's.\n\nNevertheless, they soon came to understand each other. Neither looked\nat the amount of the payment: the one was ready to accept whatever\nwas offered; the other was ready to give whatever was demanded. Never\nwas bargain more readily concluded.\n\nThe result of the treaty was, that Hans engaged on his part to\nconduct us to the village of Stapi, on the south shore of the Sn\u00e6fell\npeninsula, at the very foot of the volcano. By land this would be\nabout twenty-two miles, to be done, said my uncle, in two days.\n\nBut when he learnt that the Danish mile was 24,000 feet long, he was\nobliged to modify his calculations and allow seven or eight days for\nthe march.\n\nFour horses were to be placed at our disposal--two to carry him and\nme, two for the baggage. Hams, as was his custom, would go on foot.\nHe knew all that part of the coast perfectly, and promised to take us\nthe shortest way.\n\nHis engagement was not to terminate with our arrival at Stapi; he was\nto continue in my uncle's service for the whole period of his\nscientific researches, for the remuneration of three rixdales a week\n(about twelve shillings), but it was an express article of the\ncovenant that his wages should be counted out to him every Saturday\nat six o'clock in the evening, which, according to him, was one\nindispensable part of the engagement.\n\nThe start was fixed for the 16th of June. My uncle wanted to pay the\nhunter a portion in advance, but he refused with one word:\n\n\"_Efter,_\" said he.\n\n\"After,\" said the Professor for my edification.\n\nThe treaty concluded, Hans silently withdrew.\n\n\"A famous fellow,\" cried my uncle; \"but he little thinks of the\nmarvellous part he has to play in the future.\"\n\n\"So he is to go with us as far as--\"\n\n\"As far as the centre of the earth, Axel.\"\n\nForty-eight hours were left before our departure; to my great regret\nI had to employ them in preparations; for all our ingenuity was\nrequired to pack every article to the best advantage; instruments\nhere, arms there, tools in this package, provisions in that: four\nsets of packages in all.\n\nThe instruments were:\n\n1. An Eigel's centigrade thermometer, graduated up to 150 degrees\n(302 degrees Fahr.), which seemed to me too much or too little. Too\nmuch if the internal heat was to rise so high, for in this case we\nshould be baked, not enough to measure the temperature of springs or\nany matter in a state of fusion.\n\n2. An aneroid barometer, to indicate extreme pressures of the\natmosphere. An ordinary barometer would not have answered the\npurpose, as the pressure would increase during our descent to a point\nwhich the mercurial barometer [1] would not register.\n\n3. A chronometer, made by Boissonnas, jun., of Geneva, accurately set\nto the meridian of Hamburg.\n\n4. Two compasses, viz., a common compass and a dipping needle.\n\n5. A night glass.\n\n6. Two of Ruhmkorff's apparatus, which, by means of an electric\ncurrent, supplied a safe and handy portable light [2]\n\nThe arms consisted of two of Purdy's rifles and two brace of pistols.\nBut what did we want arms for? We had neither savages nor wild beasts\nto fear, I supposed. But my uncle seemed to believe in his arsenal as\nin his instruments, and more especially in a considerable quantity of\ngun cotton, which is unaffected by moisture, and the explosive force\nof which exceeds that of gunpowder.\n\n[1] In M. Verne's book a 'manometer' is the instrument used, of which\nvery little is known. In a complete list of philosophical instruments\nthe translator cannot find the name. As he is assured by a first-rate\ninstrument maker, Chadburn, of Liverpool, that an aneroid can be\nconstructed to measure any depth, he has thought it best to furnish\nthe adventurous professor with this more familiar instrument. The\n'manometer' is generally known as a pressure gauge.--TRANS.\n\n[2] Ruhmkorff's apparatus consists of a Bunsen pile worked with\nbichromate of potash, which makes no smell; an induction coil carries\nthe electricity generated by the pile into communication with a\nlantern of peculiar construction; in this lantern there is a spiral\nglass tube from which the air has been excluded, and in which remains\nonly a residuum of carbonic acid gas or of nitrogen. When the\napparatus is put in action this gas becomes luminous, producing a\nwhite steady light. The pile and coil are placed in a leathern bag\nwhich the traveller carries over his shoulders; the lantern outside\nof the bag throws sufficient light into deep darkness; it enables one\nto venture without fear of explosions into the midst of the most\ninflammable gases, and is not extinguished even in the deepest\nwaters. M. Ruhmkorff is a learned and most ingenious man of science;\nhis great discovery is his induction coil, which produces a powerful\nstream of electricity. He obtained in 1864 the quinquennial prize of\n50,000 franc reserved by the French government for the most ingenious\napplication of electricity.\n\nThe tools comprised two pickaxes, two spades, a silk ropeladder,\nthree iron-tipped sticks, a hatchet, a hammer, a dozen wedges and\niron spikes, and a long knotted rope. Now this was a large load, for\nthe ladder was 300 feet long.\n\nAnd there were provisions too: this was not a large parcel, but it\nwas comforting to know that of essence of beef and biscuits there\nwere six months' consumption. Spirits were the only liquid, and of\nwater we took none; but we had flasks, and my uncle depended on\nsprings from which to fill them. Whatever objections I hazarded as to\ntheir quality, temperature, and even absence, remained ineffectual.\n\nTo complete the exact inventory of all our travelling accompaniments,\nI must not forget a pocket medicine chest, containing blunt scissors,\nsplints for broken limbs, a piece of tape of unbleached linen,\nbandages and compresses, lint, a lancet for bleeding, all dreadful\narticles to take with one. Then there was a row of phials containing\ndextrine, alcoholic ether, liquid acetate of lead, vinegar, and\nammonia drugs which afforded me no comfort. Finally, all the articles\nneedful to supply Ruhmkorff's apparatus.\n\nMy uncle did not forget a supply of tobacco, coarse grained powder,\nand amadou, nor a leathern belt in which he carried a sufficient\nquantity of gold, silver, and paper money. Six pairs of boots and\nshoes, made waterproof with a composition of indiarubber and naphtha,\nwere packed amongst the tools.\n\n\"Clothed, shod, and equipped like this,\" said my uncle, \"there is no\ntelling how far we may go.\"\n\nThe 14th was wholly spent in arranging all our different articles. In\nthe evening we dined with Baron Tramps; the mayor of Rejkiavik, and\nDr. Hyaltalin, the first medical man of the place, being of the\nparty. M. Fridrikssen was not there. I learned afterwards that he and\nthe Governor disagreed upon some question of administration, and did\nnot speak to each other. I therefore knew not a single word of all\nthat was said at this semi-official dinner; but I could not help\nnoticing that my uncle talked the whole time.\n\nOn the 15th our preparations were all made. Our host gave the\nProfessor very great pleasure by presenting him with a map of Iceland\nfar more complete than that of Hendersen. It was the map of M. Olaf\nNikolas Olsen, in the proportion of 1 to 480,000 of the actual size\nof the island, and published by the Icelandic Literary Society. It\nwas a precious document for a mineralogist.\n\nOur last evening was spent in intimate conversation with M.\nFridrikssen, with whom I felt the liveliest sympathy; then, after the\ntalk, succeeded, for me, at any rate, a disturbed and restless night.\n\nAt five in the morning I was awoke by the neighing and pawing of four\nhorses under my window. I dressed hastily and came down into the\nstreet. Hans was finishing our packing, almost as it were without\nmoving a limb; and yet he did his work cleverly. My uncle made more\nnoise than execution, and the guide seemed to pay very little\nattention to his energetic directions.\n\nAt six o'clock our preparations were over. M. Fridrikssen shook hands\nwith us. My uncle thanked him heartily for his extreme kindness. I\nconstructed a few fine Latin sentences to express my cordial\nfarewell. Then we bestrode our steeds and with his last adieu M.\nFridrikssen treated me to a line of Virgil eminently applicable to\nsuch uncertain wanderers as we were likely to be:\n\n\"Et quacumque viam dedent fortuna sequamur.\"\n\n\"Therever fortune clears a way,\nThither our ready footsteps stray.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nA BARREN LAND\n\n\nWe had started under a sky overcast but calm. There was no fear of\nheat, none of disastrous rain. It was just the weather for tourists.\n\nThe pleasure of riding on horseback over an unknown country made me\neasy to be pleased at our first start. I threw myself wholly into the\npleasure of the trip, and enjoyed the feeling of freedom and\nsatisfied desire. I was beginning to take a real share in the\nenterprise.\n\n\"Besides,\" I said to myself, \"where's the risk? Here we are\ntravelling all through a most interesting country! We are about to\nclimb a very remarkable mountain; at the worst we are going to\nscramble down an extinct crater. It is evident that Saknussemm did\nnothing more than this. As for a passage leading to the centre of the\nglobe, it is mere rubbish! perfectly impossible! Very well, then; let\nus get all the good we can out of this expedition, and don't let us\nhaggle about the chances.\"\n\nThis reasoning having settled my mind, we got out of Rejkiavik.\n\nHans moved steadily on, keeping ahead of us at an even, smooth, and\nrapid pace. The baggage horses followed him without giving any\ntrouble. Then came my uncle and myself, looking not so very\nill-mounted on our small but hardy animals.\n\nIceland is one of the largest islands in Europe. Its surface is\n14,000 square miles, and it contains but 16,000 inhabitants.\nGeographers have divided it into four quarters, and we were crossing\ndiagonally the south-west quarter, called the 'Sudvester Fjordungr.'\n\nOn leaving Rejkiavik Hans took us by the seashore. We passed lean\npastures which were trying very hard, but in vain, to look green;\nyellow came out best. The rugged peaks of the trachyte rocks\npresented faint outlines on the eastern horizon; at times a few\npatches of snow, concentrating the vague light, glittered upon the\nslopes of the distant mountains; certain peaks, boldly uprising,\npassed through the grey clouds, and reappeared above the moving\nmists, like breakers emerging in the heavens.\n\nOften these chains of barren rocks made a dip towards the sea, and\nencroached upon the scanty pasturage: but there was always enough\nroom to pass. Besides, our horses instinctively chose the easiest\nplaces without ever slackening their pace. My uncle was refused even\nthe satisfaction of stirring up his beast with whip or voice. He had\nno excuse for being impatient. I could not help smiling to see so\ntall a man on so small a pony, and as his long legs nearly touched\nthe ground he looked like a six-legged centaur.\n\n\"Good horse! good horse!\" he kept saying. \"You will see, Axel, that\nthere is no more sagacious animal than the Icelandic horse. He is\nstopped by neither snow, nor storm, nor impassable roads, nor rocks,\nglaciers, or anything. He is courageous, sober, and surefooted. He\nnever makes a false step, never shies. If there is a river or fiord\nto cross (and we shall meet with many) you will see him plunge in at\nonce, just as if he were amphibious, and gain the opposite bank. But\nwe must not hurry him; we must let him have his way, and we shall get\non at the rate of thirty miles a day.\"\n\n\"We may; but how about our guide?\"\n\n\"Oh, never mind him. People like him get over the ground without a\nthought. There is so little action in this man that he will never get\ntired; and besides, if he wants it, he shall have my horse. I shall\nget cramped if I don't have a little action. The arms are all right,\nbut the legs want exercise.\"\n\nWe were advancing at a rapid pace. The country was already almost a\ndesert. Here and there was a lonely farm, called a bo\u00ebr built either\nof wood, or of sods, or of pieces of lava, looking like a poor beggar\nby the wayside. These ruinous huts seemed to solicit charity from\npassers-by; and on very small provocation we should have given alms\nfor the relief of the poor inmates. In this country there were no\nroads and paths, and the poor vegetation, however slow, would soon\nefface the rare travellers' footsteps.\n\nYet this part of the province, at a very small distance from the\ncapital, is reckoned among the inhabited and cultivated portions of\nIceland. What, then, must other tracts be, more desert than this\ndesert? In the first half mile we had not seen one farmer standing\nbefore his cabin door, nor one shepherd tending a flock less wild\nthan himself, nothing but a few cows and sheep left to themselves.\nWhat then would be those convulsed regions upon which we were\nadvancing, regions subject to the dire phenomena of eruptions, the\noffspring of volcanic explosions and subterranean convulsions?\n\nWe were to know them before long, but on consulting Olsen's map, I\nsaw that they would be avoided by winding along the seashore. In\nfact, the great plutonic action is confined to the central portion of\nthe island; there, rocks of the trappean and volcanic class,\nincluding trachyte, basalt, and tuffs and agglomerates associated\nwith streams of lava, have made this a land of supernatural horrors.\nI had no idea of the spectacle which was awaiting us in the peninsula\nof Sn\u00e6fell, where these ruins of a fiery nature have formed a\nfrightful chaos.\n\nIn two hours from Rejkiavik we arrived at the burgh of Gufunes,\ncalled Aolkirkja, or principal church. There was nothing remarkable\nhere but a few houses, scarcely enough for a German hamlet.\n\nHans stopped here half an hour. He shared with us our frugal\nbreakfast; answering my uncle's questions about the road and our\nresting place that night with merely yes or no, except when he said\n\"Gard\u00e4r.\"\n\nI consulted the map to see where Gard\u00e4r was. I saw there was a small\ntown of that name on the banks of the Hvalfiord, four miles from\nRejkiavik. I showed it to my uncle.\n\n\"Four miles only!\" he exclaimed; \"four miles out of twenty-eight.\nWhat a nice little walk!\"\n\nHe was about to make an observation to the guide, who without\nanswering resumed his place at the head, and went on his way.\n\nThree hours later, still treading on the colourless grass of the\npasture land, we had to work round the Kolla fiord, a longer way but\nan easier one than across that inlet. We soon entered into a\n'pingstaoer' or parish called Ejulberg, from whose steeple twelve\no'clock would have struck, if Icelandic churches were rich enough to\npossess clocks. But they are like the parishioners who have no\nwatches and do without.\n\nThere our horses were baited; then taking the narrow path to left\nbetween a chain of hills and the sea, they carried us to our next\nstage, the aolkirkja of Brant\u00e4r and one mile farther on, to Saurbo\u00ebr\n'Annexia,' a chapel of ease built on the south shore of the Hvalfiord.\n\nIt was now four o'clock, and we had gone four Icelandic miles, or\ntwenty-four English miles.\n\nIn that place the fiord was at least three English miles wide; the\nwaves rolled with a rushing din upon the sharp-pointed rocks; this\ninlet was confined between walls of rock, precipices crowned by sharp\npeaks 2,000 feet high, and remarkable for the brown strata which\nseparated the beds of reddish tuff. However much I might respect the\nintelligence of our quadrupeds, I hardly cared to put it to the test\nby trusting myself to it on horseback across an arm of the sea.\n\nIf they are as intelligent as they are said to be, I thought, they\nwon't try it. In any case, I will tax my intelligence to direct\ntheirs.\n\nBut my uncle would not wait. He spurred on to the edge. His steed\nlowered his head to examine the nearest waves and stopped. My uncle,\nwho had an instinct of his own, too, applied pressure, and was again\nrefused by the animal significantly shaking his head. Then followed\nstrong language, and the whip; but the brute answered these arguments\nwith kicks and endeavours to throw his rider. At last the clever\nlittle pony, with a bend of his knees, started from under the\nProfessor's legs, and left him standing upon two boulders on the\nshore just like the colossus of Rhodes.\n\n\"Confounded brute!\" cried the unhorsed horseman, suddenly degraded\ninto a pedestrian, just as ashamed as a cavalry officer degraded to a\nfoot soldier.\n\n\"_F\u00e4rja,_\" said the guide, touching his shoulder.\n\n\"What! a boat?\"\n\n\"_Der,_\" replied Hans, pointing to one.\n\n\"Yes,\" I cried; \"there is a boat.\"\n\n\"Why did not you say so then? Well, let us go on.\"\n\n\"_Tidvatten,_\" said the guide.\n\n\"What is he saying?\"\n\n\"He says tide,\" said my uncle, translating the Danish word.\n\n\"No doubt we must wait for the tide.\"\n\n\"_F\u00f6rbida,_\" said my uncle.\n\n\"_Ja,_\" replied Hans.\n\nMy uncle stamped with his foot, while the horses went on to the boat.\n\nI perfectly understood the necessity of abiding a particular moment\nof the tide to undertake the crossing of the fiord, when, the sea\nhaving reached its greatest height, it should be slack water. Then\nthe ebb and flow have no sensible effect, and the boat does not risk\nbeing carried either to the bottom or out to sea.\n\nThat favourable moment arrived only with six o'clock; when my uncle,\nmyself, the guide, two other passengers and the four horses, trusted\nourselves to a somewhat fragile raft. Accustomed as I was to the\nswift and sure steamers on the Elbe, I found the oars of the rowers\nrather a slow means of propulsion. It took us more than an hour to\ncross the fiord; but the passage was effected without any mishap.\n\nIn another half hour we had reached the aolkirkja of Gard\u00e4r\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nHOSPITALITY UNDER THE ARCTIC CIRCLE\n\n\nIt ought to have been night-time, but under the 65th parallel there\nwas nothing surprising in the nocturnal polar light. In Iceland\nduring the months of June and July the sun does not set.\n\nBut the temperature was much lower. I was cold and more hungry than\ncold. Welcome was the sight of the bo\u00ebr which was hospitably opened\nto receive us.\n\nIt was a peasant's house, but in point of hospitality it was equal to\na king's. On our arrival the master came with outstretched hands, and\nwithout more ceremony he beckoned us to follow him.\n\nTo accompany him down the long, narrow, dark passage, would have been\nimpossible. Therefore, we followed, as he bid us. The building was\nconstructed of roughly squared timbers, with rooms on both sides,\nfour in number, all opening out into the one passage: these were the\nkitchen, the weaving shop, the badstofa, or family sleeping-room, and\nthe visitors' room, which was the best of all. My uncle, whose height\nhad not been thought of in building the house, of course hit his head\nseveral times against the beams that projected from the ceilings.\n\nWe were introduced into our apartment, a large room with a floor of\nearth stamped hard down, and lighted by a window, the panes of which\nwere formed of sheep's bladder, not admitting too much light. The\nsleeping accommodation consisted of dry litter, thrown into two\nwooden frames painted red, and ornamented with Icelandic sentences. I\nwas hardly expecting so much comfort; the only discomfort proceeded\nfrom the strong odour of dried fish, hung meat, and sour milk, of\nwhich my nose made bitter complaints.\n\nWhen we had laid aside our travelling wraps the voice of the host was\nheard inviting us to the kitchen, the only room where a fire was\nlighted even in the severest cold.\n\nMy uncle lost no time in obeying the friendly call, nor was I slack\nin following.\n\nThe kitchen chimney was constructed on the ancient pattern; in the\nmiddle of the room was a stone for a hearth, over it in the roof a\nhole to let the smoke escape. The kitchen was also a dining-room.\n\nAt our entrance the host, as if he had never seen us, greeted us with\nthe word \"_S\u00e6llvertu,_\" which means \"be happy,\" and came and kissed\nus on the cheek.\n\nAfter him his wife pronounced the same words, accompanied with the\nsame ceremonial; then the two placing their hands upon their hearts,\ninclined profoundly before us.\n\nI hasten to inform the reader that this Icelandic lady was the mother\nof nineteen children, all, big and little, swarming in the midst of\nthe dense wreaths of smoke with which the fire on the hearth filled\nthe chamber. Every moment I noticed a fair-haired and rather\nmelancholy face peeping out of the rolling volumes of smoke--they\nwere a perfect cluster of unwashed angels.\n\nMy uncle and I treated this little tribe with kindness; and in a very\nshort time we each had three or four of these brats on our shoulders,\nas many on our laps, and the rest between our knees. Those who could\nspeak kept repeating \"_S\u00e6llvertu,_\" in every conceivable tone; those\nthat could not speak made up for that want by shrill cries.\n\nThis concert was brought to a close by the announcement of dinner. At\nthat moment our hunter returned, who had been seeing his horses\nprovided for; that is to say, he had economically let them loose in\nthe fields, where the poor beasts had to content themselves with the\nscanty moss they could pull off the rocks and a few meagre sea weeds,\nand the next day they would not fail to come of themselves and resume\nthe labours of the previous day.\n\n\"_S\u00e6llvertu,_\" said Hans.\n\nThen calmly, automatically, and dispassionately he kissed the host,\nthe hostess, and their nineteen children.\n\nThis ceremony over, we sat at table, twenty-four in number, and\ntherefore one upon another. The luckiest had only two urchins upon\ntheir knees.\n\nBut silence reigned in all this little world at the arrival of the\nsoup, and the national taciturnity resumed its empire even over the\nchildren. The host served out to us a soup made of lichen and by no\nmeans unpleasant, then an immense piece of dried fish floating in\nbutter rancid with twenty years' keeping, and, therefore, according\nto Icelandic gastronomy, much preferable to fresh butter. Along with\nthis, we had 'skye,' a sort of clotted milk, with biscuits, and a\nliquid prepared from juniper berries; for beverage we had a thin milk\nmixed with water, called in this country 'blanda.' It is not for me\nto decide whether this diet is wholesome or not; all I can say is,\nthat I was desperately hungry, and that at dessert I swallowed to the\nvery last gulp of a thick broth made from buckwheat.\n\nAs soon as the meal was over the children disappeared, and their\nelders gathered round the peat fire, which also burnt such\nmiscellaneous fuel as briars, cow-dung, and fishbones. After this\nlittle pinch of warmth the different groups retired to their\nrespective rooms. Our hostess hospitably offered us her assistance in\nundressing, according to Icelandic usage; but on our gracefully\ndeclining, she insisted no longer, and I was able at last to curl\nmyself up in my mossy bed.\n\nAt five next morning we bade our host farewell, my uncle with\ndifficulty persuading him to accept a proper remuneration; and Hans\nsignalled the start.\n\nAt a hundred yards from Gard\u00e4r the soil began to change its aspect;\nit became boggy and less favourable to progress. On our right the\nchain of mountains was indefinitely prolonged like an immense system\nof natural fortifications, of which we were following the\ncounter-scarp or lesser steep; often we were met by streams, which we\nhad to ford with great care, not to wet our packages.\n\nThe desert became wider and more hideous; yet from time to time we\nseemed to descry a human figure that fled at our approach, sometimes\na sharp turn would bring us suddenly within a short distance of one\nof these spectres, and I was filled with loathing at the sight of a\nhuge deformed head, the skin shining and hairless, and repulsive\nsores visible through the gaps in the poor creature's wretched rags.\n\nThe unhappy being forbore to approach us and offer his misshapen\nhand. He fled away, but not before Hans had saluted him with the\ncustomary \"_S\u00e6llvertu._\"\n\n\"_Spetelsk,_\" said he.\n\n\"A leper!\" my uncle repeated.\n\nThis word produced a repulsive effect. The horrible disease of\nleprosy is too common in Iceland; it is not contagious, but\nhereditary, and lepers are forbidden to marry.\n\nThese apparitions were not cheerful, and did not throw any charm over\nthe less and less attractive landscapes. The last tufts of grass had\ndisappeared from beneath our feet. Not a tree was to be seen, unless\nwe except a few dwarf birches as low as brushwood. Not an animal but\na few wandering ponies that their owners would not feed. Sometimes we\ncould see a hawk balancing himself on his wings under the grey cloud,\nand then darting away south with rapid flight. I felt melancholy\nunder this savage aspect of nature, and my thoughts went away to the\ncheerful scenes I had left in the far south.\n\nWe had to cross a few narrow fiords, and at last quite a wide gulf;\nthe tide, then high, allowed us to pass over without delay, and to\nreach the hamlet of Alftanes, one mile beyond.\n\nThat evening, after having forded two rivers full of trout and pike,\ncalled Alfa and Heta, we were obliged to spend the night in a\ndeserted building worthy to be haunted by all the elfins of\nScandinavia. The ice king certainly held court here, and gave us all\nnight long samples of what he could do.\n\nNo particular event marked the next day. Bogs, dead levels,\nmelancholy desert tracks, wherever we travelled. By nightfall we had\naccomplished half our journey, and we lay at Kr\u00f6solbt.\n\nOn the 19th of June, for about a mile, that is an Icelandic mile, we\nwalked upon hardened lava; this ground is called in the country\n'hraun'; the writhen surface presented the appearance of distorted,\ntwisted cables, sometimes stretched in length, sometimes contorted\ntogether; an immense torrent, once liquid, now solid, ran from the\nnearest mountains, now extinct volcanoes, but the ruins around\nrevealed the violence of the past eruptions. Yet here and there were\na few jets of steam from hot springs.\n\nWe had no time to watch these phenomena; we had to proceed on our\nway. Soon at the foot of the mountains the boggy land reappeared,\nintersected by little lakes. Our route now lay westward; we had\nturned the great bay of Faxa, and the twin peaks of Sn\u00e6fell rose\nwhite into the cloudy sky at the distance of at least five miles.\n\nThe horses did their duty well, no difficulties stopped them in their\nsteady career. I was getting tired; but my uncle was as firm and\nstraight as he was at our first start. I could not help admiring his\npersistency, as well as the hunter's, who treated our expedition like\na mere promenade.\n\nJune 20. At six p.m. we reached B\u00fcdir, a village on the sea shore;\nand the guide there claiming his due, my uncle settled with him. It\nwas Hans' own family, that is, his uncles and cousins, who gave us\nhospitality; we were kindly received, and without taxing too much the\ngoodness of these folks, I would willingly have tarried here to\nrecruit after my fatigues. But my uncle, who wanted no recruiting,\nwould not hear of it, and the next morning we had to bestride our\nbeasts again.\n\nThe soil told of the neighbourhood of the mountain, whose granite\nfoundations rose from the earth like the knotted roots of some huge\noak. We were rounding the immense base of the volcano. The Professor\nhardly took his eyes off it. He tossed up his arms and seemed to defy\nit, and to declare, \"There stands the giant that I shall conquer.\"\nAfter about four hours' walking the horses stopped of their own\naccord at the door of the priest's house at Stapi.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nBUT ARCTICS CAN BE INHOSPITABLE, TOO\n\n\nStapi is a village consisting of about thirty huts, built of lava, at\nthe south side of the base of the volcano. It extends along the inner\nedge of a small fiord, inclosed between basaltic walls of the\nstrangest construction.\n\nBasalt is a brownish rock of igneous origin. It assumes regular\nforms, the arrangement of which is often very surprising. Here nature\nhad done her work geometrically, with square and compass and plummet.\nEverywhere else her art consists alone in throwing down huge masses\ntogether in disorder. You see cones imperfectly formed, irregular\npyramids, with a fantastic disarrangement of lines; but here, as if\nto exhibit an example of regularity, though in advance of the very\nearliest architects, she has created a severely simple order of\narchitecture, never surpassed either by the splendours of Babylon or\nthe wonders of Greece.\n\nI had heard of the Giant's Causeway in Ireland, and Fingal's Cave in\nStaffa, one of the Hebrides; but I had never yet seen a basaltic\nformation.\n\nAt Stapi I beheld this phenomenon in all its beauty.\n\nThe wall that confined the fiord, like all the coast of the\npeninsula, was composed of a series of vertical columns thirty feet\nhigh. These straight shafts, of fair proportions, supported an\narchitrave of horizontal slabs, the overhanging portion of which\nformed a semi-arch over the sea. At intervals, under this natural\nshelter, there spread out vaulted entrances in beautiful curves, into\nwhich the waves came dashing with foam and spray. A few shafts of\nbasalt, torn from their hold by the fury of tempests, lay along the\nsoil like remains of an ancient temple, in ruins for ever fresh, and\nover which centuries passed without leaving a trace of age upon them.\n\nThis was our last stage upon the earth. Hans had exhibited great\nintelligence, and it gave me some little comfort to think then that\nhe was not going to leave us.\n\nOn arriving at the door of the rector's house, which was not\ndifferent from the others, I saw a man shoeing a horse, hammer in\nhand, and with a leathern apron on.\n\n\"_S\u00e6llvertu,_\" said the hunter.\n\n\"_God dag,_\" said the blacksmith in good Danish.\n\n\"_Kyrkoherde,_\" said Hans, turning round to my uncle.\n\n\"The rector,\" repeated the Professor. \"It seems, Axel, that this good\nman is the rector.\"\n\nOur guide in the meanwhile was making the 'kyrkoherde' aware of the\nposition of things; when the latter, suspending his labours for a\nmoment, uttered a sound no doubt understood between horses and\nfarriers, and immediately a tall and ugly hag appeared from the hut.\nShe must have been six feet at the least. I was in great alarm lest\nshe should treat me to the Icelandic kiss; but there was no occasion\nto fear, nor did she do the honours at all too gracefully.\n\nThe visitors' room seemed to me the worst in the whole cabin. It was\nclose, dirty, and evil smelling. But we had to be content. The rector\ndid not to go in for antique hospitality. Very far from it. Before\nthe day was over I saw that we had to do with a blacksmith, a\nfisherman, a hunter, a joiner, but not at all with a minister of the\nGospel. To be sure, it was a week-day; perhaps on a Sunday he made\namends.\n\nI don't mean to say anything against these poor priests, who after\nall are very wretched. They receive from the Danish Government a\nridiculously small pittance, and they get from the parish the fourth\npart of the tithe, which does not come to sixty marks a year (about\n\u00a34). Hence the necessity to work for their livelihood; but after\nfishing, hunting, and shoeing horses for any length of time, one soon\ngets into the ways and manners of fishermen, hunters, and farriers,\nand other rather rude and uncultivated people; and that evening I\nfound out that temperance was not among the virtues that\ndistinguished my host.\n\nMy uncle soon discovered what sort of a man he had to do with;\ninstead of a good and learned man he found a rude and coarse peasant.\nHe therefore resolved to commence the grand expedition at once, and\nto leave this inhospitable parsonage. He cared nothing about fatigue,\nand resolved to spend some days upon the mountain.\n\nThe preparations for our departure were therefore made the very day\nafter our arrival at Stapi. Hans hired the services of three\nIcelanders to do the duty of the horses in the transport of the\nburdens; but as soon as we had arrived at the crater these natives\nwere to turn back and leave us to our own devices. This was to be\nclearly understood.\n\nMy uncle now took the opportunity to explain to Hans that it was his\nintention to explore the interior of the volcano to its farthest\nlimits.\n\nHans merely nodded. There or elsewhere, down in the bowels of the\nearth, or anywhere on the surface, all was alike to him. For my own\npart the incidents of the journey had hitherto kept me amused, and\nmade me forgetful of coming evils; but now my fears again were\nbeginning to get the better of me. But what could I do? The place to\nresist the Professor would have been Hamburg, not the foot of Sn\u00e6fell.\n\nOne thought, above all others, harassed and alarmed me; it was one\ncalculated to shake firmer nerves than mine.\n\nNow, thought I, here we are, about to climb Sn\u00e6fell. Very good. We\nwill explore the crater. Very good, too, others have done as much\nwithout dying for it. But that is not all. If there is a way to\npenetrate into the very bowels of the island, if that ill-advised\nSaknussemm has told a true tale, we shall lose our way amidst the\ndeep subterranean passages of this volcano. Now, there is no proof\nthat Sn\u00e6fell is extinct. Who can assure us that an eruption is not\nbrewing at this very moment? Does it follow that because the monster\nhas slept since 1229 he must therefore never awake again? And if he\nwakes up presently, where shall we be?\n\nIt was worth while debating this question, and I did debate it. I\ncould not sleep for dreaming about eruptions. Now, the part of\nejected scoriae and ashes seemed to my mind a very rough one to act.\n\nSo, at last, when I could hold out no longer, I resolved to lay the\ncase before my uncle, as prudently and as cautiously as possible,\njust under the form of an almost impossible hypothesis.\n\nI went to him. I communicated my fears to him, and drew back a step\nto give him room for the explosion which I knew must follow. But I\nwas mistaken.\n\n\"I was thinking of that,\" he replied with great simplicity.\n\nWhat could those words mean?--Was he actually going to listen to\nreason? Was he contemplating the abandonment of his plans? This was\ntoo good to be true.\n\nAfter a few moments' silence, during which I dared not question him,\nhe resumed:\n\n\"I was thinking of that. Ever since we arrived at Stapi I have been\noccupied with the important question you have just opened, for we\nmust not be guilty of imprudence.\"\n\n\"No, indeed!\" I replied with forcible emphasis.\n\n\"For six hundred years Sn\u00e6fell has been dumb; but he may speak again.\nNow, eruptions are always preceded by certain well-known phenomena. I\nhave therefore examined the natives, I have studied external\nappearances, and I can assure you, Axel, that there will be no\neruption.\"\n\nAt this positive affirmation I stood amazed and speechless.\n\n\"You don't doubt my word?\" said my uncle. \"Well, follow me.\"\n\nI obeyed like an automaton. Coming out from the priest's house, the\nProfessor took a straight road, which, through an opening in the\nbasaltic wall, led away from the sea. We were soon in the open\ncountry, if one may give that name to a vast extent of mounds of\nvolcanic products. This tract seemed crushed under a rain of enormous\nejected rocks of trap, basalt, granite, and all kinds of igneous\nrocks.\n\nHere and there I could see puffs and jets of steam curling up into\nthe air, called in Icelandic 'reykir,' issuing from thermal springs,\nand indicating by their motion the volcanic energy underneath. This\nseemed to justify my fears: But I fell from the height of my new-born\nhopes when my uncle said:\n\n\"You see all these volumes of steam, Axel; well, they demonstrate\nthat we have nothing to fear from the fury of a volcanic eruption.\"\n\n\"Am I to believe that?\" I cried.\n\n\"Understand this clearly,\" added the Professor. \"At the approach of\nan eruption these jets would redouble their activity, but disappear\naltogether during the period of the eruption. For the elastic fluids,\nbeing no longer under pressure, go off by way of the crater instead\nof escaping by their usual passages through the fissures in the soil.\nTherefore, if these vapours remain in their usual condition, if they\ndisplay no augmentation of force, and if you add to this the\nobservation that the wind and rain are not ceasing and being replaced\nby a still and heavy atmosphere, then you may affirm that no eruption\nis preparing.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n'No more; that is sufficient. When science has uttered her voice, let\nbabblers hold their peace.'\n\nI returned to the parsonage, very crestfallen. My uncle had beaten me\nwith the weapons of science. Still I had one hope left, and this was,\nthat when we had reached the bottom of the crater it would be\nimpossible, for want of a passage, to go deeper, in spite of all the\nSaknussemm's in Iceland.\n\nI spent that whole night in one constant nightmare; in the heart of a\nvolcano, and from the deepest depths of the earth I saw myself tossed\nup amongst the interplanetary spaces under the form of an eruptive\nrock.\n\nThe next day, June 23, Hans was awaiting us with his companions\ncarrying provisions, tools, and instruments; two iron pointed sticks,\ntwo rifles, and two shot belts were for my uncle and myself. Hans, as\na cautious man, had added to our luggage a leathern bottle full of\nwater, which, with that in our flasks, would ensure us a supply of\nwater for eight days.\n\nIt was nine in the morning. The priest and his tall Meg\u00e6ra were\nawaiting us at the door. We supposed they were standing there to bid\nus a kind farewell. But the farewell was put in the unexpected form\nof a heavy bill, in which everything was charged, even to the very\nair we breathed in the pastoral house, infected as it was. This\nworthy couple were fleecing us just as a Swiss innkeeper might have\ndone, and estimated their imperfect hospitality at the highest price.\n\nMy uncle paid without a remark: a man who is starting for the centre\nof the earth need not be particular about a few rix dollars.\n\nThis point being settled, Hans gave the signal, and we soon left\nStapi behind us.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nSN\u00c6FELL AT LAST\n\n\nSn\u00e6fell is 5,000 feet high. Its double cone forms the limit of a\ntrachytic belt which stands out distinctly in the mountain system of\nthe island. From our starting point we could see the two peaks boldly\nprojected against the dark grey sky; I could see an enormous cap of\nsnow coming low down upon the giant's brow.\n\nWe walked in single file, headed by the hunter, who ascended by\nnarrow tracks, where two could not have gone abreast. There was\ntherefore no room for conversation.\n\nAfter we had passed the basaltic wall of the fiord of Stapi we passed\nover a vegetable fibrous peat bog, left from the ancient vegetation\nof this peninsula. The vast quantity of this unworked fuel would be\nsufficient to warm the whole population of Iceland for a century;\nthis vast turbary measured in certain ravines had in many places a\ndepth of seventy feet, and presented layers of carbonized remains of\nvegetation alternating with thinner layers of tufaceous pumice.\n\nAs a true nephew of the Professor Liedenbrock, and in spite of my\ndismal prospects, I could not help observing with interest the\nmineralogical curiosities which lay about me as in a vast museum, and\nI constructed for myself a complete geological account of Iceland.\n\nThis most curious island has evidently been projected from the bottom\nof the sea at a comparatively recent date. Possibly, it may still be\nsubject to gradual elevation. If this is the case, its origin may\nwell be attributed to subterranean fires. Therefore, in this case,\nthe theory of Sir Humphry Davy, Saknussemm's document, and my uncle's\ntheories would all go off in smoke. This hypothesis led me to examine\nwith more attention the appearance of the surface, and I soon arrived\nat a conclusion as to the nature of the forces which presided at its\nbirth.\n\nIceland, which is entirely devoid of alluvial soil, is wholly\ncomposed of volcanic tufa, that is to say, an agglomeration of porous\nrocks and stones. Before the volcanoes broke out it consisted of trap\nrocks slowly upraised to the level of the sea by the action of\ncentral forces. The internal fires had not yet forced their way\nthrough.\n\nBut at a later period a wide chasm formed diagonally from south-west\nto north-east, through which was gradually forced out the trachyte\nwhich was to form a mountain chain. No violence accompanied this\nchange; the matter thrown out was in vast quantities, and the liquid\nmaterial oozing out from the abysses of the earth slowly spread in\nextensive plains or in hillocky masses. To this period belong the\nfelspar, syenites, and porphyries.\n\nBut with the help of this outflow the thickness of the crust of the\nisland increased materially, and therefore also its powers of\nresistance. It may easily be conceived what vast quantities of\nelastic gases, what masses of molten matter accumulated beneath its\nsolid surface whilst no exit was practicable after the cooling of the\ntrachytic crust. Therefore a time would come when the elastic and\nexplosive forces of the imprisoned gases would upheave this ponderous\ncover and drive out for themselves openings through tall chimneys.\nHence then the volcano would distend and lift up the crust, and then\nburst through a crater suddenly formed at the summit or thinnest part\nof the volcano.\n\nTo the eruption succeeded other volcanic phenomena. Through the\noutlets now made first escaped the ejected basalt of which the plain\nwe had just left presented such marvellous specimens. We were moving\nover grey rocks of dense and massive formation, which in cooling had\nformed into hexagonal prisms. Everywhere around us we saw truncated\ncones, formerly so many fiery mouths.\n\nAfter the exhaustion of the basalt, the volcano, the power of which\ngrew by the extinction of the lesser craters, supplied an egress to\nlava, ashes, and scoriae, of which I could see lengthened screes\nstreaming down the sides of the mountain like flowing hair.\n\nSuch was the succession of phenomena which produced Iceland, all\narising from the action of internal fire; and to suppose that the\nmass within did not still exist in a state of liquid incandescence\nwas absurd; and nothing could surpass the absurdity of fancying that\nit was possible to reach the earth's centre.\n\nSo I felt a little comforted as we advanced to the assault of Sn\u00e6fell.\n\nThe way was growing more and more arduous, the ascent steeper and\nsteeper; the loose fragments of rock trembled beneath us, and the\nutmost care was needed to avoid dangerous falls.\n\nHans went on as quietly as if he were on level ground; sometimes he\ndisappeared altogether behind the huge blocks, then a shrill whistle\nwould direct us on our way to him. Sometimes he would halt, pick up a\nfew bits of stone, build them up into a recognisable form, and thus\nmade landmarks to guide us in our way back. A very wise precaution in\nitself, but, as things turned out, quite useless.\n\nThree hours' fatiguing march had only brought us to the base of the\nmountain. There Hans bid us come to a halt, and a hasty breakfast was\nserved out. My uncle swallowed two mouthfuls at a time to get on\nfaster. But, whether he liked it or not, this was a rest as well as a\nbreakfast hour and he had to wait till it pleased our guide to move\non, which came to pass in an hour. The three Icelanders, just as\ntaciturn as their comrade the hunter, never spoke, and ate their\nbreakfasts in silence.\n\nWe were now beginning to scale the steep sides of Sn\u00e6fell. Its snowy\nsummit, by an optical illusion not unfrequent in mountains, seemed\nclose to us, and yet how many weary hours it took to reach it! The\nstones, adhering by no soil or fibrous roots of vegetation, rolled\naway from under our feet, and rushed down the precipice below with\nthe swiftness of an avalanche.\n\nAt some places the flanks of the mountain formed an angle with the\nhorizon of at least 36 degrees; it was impossible to climb them, and\nthese stony cliffs had to be tacked round, not without great\ndifficulty. Then we helped each other with our sticks.\n\nI must admit that my uncle kept as close to me as he could; he never\nlost sight of me, and in many straits his arm furnished me with a\npowerful support. He himself seemed to possess an instinct for\nequilibrium, for he never stumbled. The Icelanders, though burdened\nwith our loads, climbed with the agility of mountaineers.\n\nTo judge by the distant appearance of the summit of Sn\u00e6fell, it would\nhave seemed too steep to ascend on our side. Fortunately, after an\nhour of fatigue and athletic exercises, in the midst of the vast\nsurface of snow presented by the hollow between the two peaks, a kind\nof staircase appeared unexpectedly which greatly facilitated our\nascent. It was formed by one of those torrents of stones flung up by\nthe eruptions, called 'sting' by the Icelanders. If this torrent had\nnot been arrested in its fall by the formation of the sides of the\nmountain, it would have gone on to the sea and formed more islands.\n\nSuch as it was, it did us good service. The steepness increased, but\nthese stone steps allowed us to rise with facility, and even with\nsuch rapidity that, having rested for a moment while my companions\ncontinued their ascent, I perceived them already reduced by distance\nto microscopic dimensions.\n\nAt seven we had ascended the two thousand steps of this grand\nstaircase, and we had attained a bulge in the mountain, a kind of bed\non which rested the cone proper of the crater.\n\nThree thousand two hundred feet below us stretched the sea. We had\npassed the limit of perpetual snow, which, on account of the moisture\nof the climate, is at a greater elevation in Iceland than the high\nlatitude would give reason to suppose. The cold was excessively keen.\nThe wind was blowing violently. I was exhausted. The Professor saw\nthat my limbs were refusing to perform their office, and in spite of\nhis impatience he decided on stopping. He therefore spoke to the\nhunter, who shook his head, saying:\n\n\"_Ofvanf\u00f6r._\"\n\n\"It seems we must go higher,\" said my uncle.\n\nThen he asked Hans for his reason.\n\n\"_Mistour,_\" replied the guide.\n\n\"_Ja Mistour,_\" said one of the Icelanders in a tone of alarm.\n\n\"What does that word mean?\" I asked uneasily.\n\n\"Look!\" said my uncle.\n\nI looked down upon the plain. An immense column of pulverized pumice,\nsand and dust was rising with a whirling circular motion like a\nwaterspout; the wind was lashing it on to that side of Sn\u00e6fell where\nwe were holding on; this dense veil, hung across the sun, threw a\ndeep shadow over the mountain. If that huge revolving pillar sloped\ndown, it would involve us in its whirling eddies. This phenomenon,\nwhich is not unfrequent when the wind blows from the glaciers, is\ncalled in Icelandic 'mistour.'\n\n\"_Hastigt! hastigt!_\" cried our guide.\n\nWithout knowing Danish I understood at once that we must follow Hans\nat the top of our speed. He began to circle round the cone of the\ncrater, but in a diagonal direction so as to facilitate our progress.\nPresently the dust storm fell upon the mountain, which quivered under\nthe shock; the loose stones, caught with the irresistible blasts of\nwind, flew about in a perfect hail as in an eruption. Happily we were\non the opposite side, and sheltered from all harm. But for the\nprecaution of our guide, our mangled bodies, torn and pounded into\nfragments, would have been carried afar like the ruins hurled along\nby some unknown meteor.\n\nYet Hans did not think it prudent to spend the night upon the sides\nof the cone. We continued our zigzag climb. The fifteen hundred\nremaining feet took us five hours to clear; the circuitous route, the\ndiagonal and the counter marches, must have measured at least three\nleagues. I could stand it no longer. I was yielding to the effects of\nhunger and cold. The rarefied air scarcely gave play to the action of\nmy lungs.\n\nAt last, at eleven in the sunlight night, the summit of Sn\u00e6fell was\nreached, and before going in for shelter into the crater I had time\nto observe the midnight sun, at his lowest point, gilding with his\npale rays the island that slept at my feet.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nBOLDLY DOWN THE CRATER\n\n\nSupper was rapidly devoured, and the little company housed themselves\nas best they could. The bed was hard, the shelter not very\nsubstantial, and our position an anxious one, at five thousand feet\nabove the sea level. Yet I slept particularly well; it was one of the\nbest nights I had ever had, and I did not even dream.\n\nNext morning we awoke half frozen by the sharp keen air, but with the\nlight of a splendid sun. I rose from my granite bed and went out to\nenjoy the magnificent spectacle that lay unrolled before me.\n\nI stood on the very summit of the southernmost of Sn\u00e6fell's peaks.\nThe range of the eye extended over the whole island. By an optical\nlaw which obtains at all great heights, the shores seemed raised and\nthe centre depressed. It seemed as if one of Helbesmer's raised maps\nlay at my feet. I could see deep valleys intersecting each other in\nevery direction, precipices like low walls, lakes reduced to ponds,\nrivers abbreviated into streams. On my right were numberless glaciers\nand innumerable peaks, some plumed with feathery clouds of smoke. The\nundulating surface of these endless mountains, crested with sheets of\nsnow, reminded one of a stormy sea. If I looked westward, there the\nocean lay spread out in all its magnificence, like a mere\ncontinuation of those flock-like summits. The eye could hardly tell\nwhere the snowy ridges ended and the foaming waves began.\n\nI was thus steeped in the marvellous ecstasy which all high summits\ndevelop in the mind; and now without giddiness, for I was beginning\nto be accustomed to these sublime aspects of nature. My dazzled eyes\nwere bathed in the bright flood of the solar rays. I was forgetting\nwhere and who I was, to live the life of elves and sylphs, the\nfanciful creation of Scandinavian superstitions. I felt intoxicated\nwith the sublime pleasure of lofty elevations without thinking of the\nprofound abysses into which I was shortly to be plunged. But I was\nbrought back to the realities of things by the arrival of Hans and\nthe Professor, who joined me on the summit.\n\nMy uncle pointed out to me in the far west a light steam or mist, a\nsemblance of land, which bounded the distant horizon of waters.\n\n\"Greenland!\" said he.\n\n\"Greenland?\" I cried.\n\n\"Yes; we are only thirty-five leagues from it; and during thaws the\nwhite bears, borne by the ice fields from the north, are carried even\ninto Iceland. But never mind that. Here we are at the top of Sn\u00e6fell\nand here are two peaks, one north and one south. Hans will tell us\nthe name of that on which we are now standing.\"\n\nThe question being put, Hans replied:\n\n\"Scartaris.\"\n\nMy uncle shot a triumphant glance at me.\n\n\"Now for the crater!\" he cried.\n\nThe crater of Sn\u00e6fell resembled an inverted cone, the opening of which\nmight be half a league in diameter. Its depth appeared to be about\ntwo thousand feet. Imagine the aspect of such a reservoir, brim full\nand running over with liquid fire amid the rolling thunder. The\nbottom of the funnel was about 250 feet in circuit, so that the\ngentle slope allowed its lower brim to be reached without much\ndifficulty. Involuntarily I compared the whole crater to an enormous\nerected mortar, and the comparison put me in a terrible fright.\n\n\"What madness,\" I thought, \"to go down into a mortar, perhaps a\nloaded mortar, to be shot up into the air at a moment's notice!\"\n\nBut I did not try to back out of it. Hans with perfect coolness\nresumed the lead, and I followed him without a word.\n\nIn order to facilitate the descent, Hans wound his way down the cone\nby a spiral path. Our route lay amidst eruptive rocks, some of which,\nshaken out of their loosened beds, rushed bounding down the abyss,\nand in their fall awoke echoes remarkable for their loud and\nwell-defined sharpness.\n\nIn certain parts of the cone there were glaciers. Here Hans advanced\nonly with extreme precaution, sounding his way with his iron-pointed\npole, to discover any crevasses in it. At particularly dubious\npassages we were obliged to connect ourselves with each other by a\nlong cord, in order that any man who missed his footing might be held\nup by his companions. This solid formation was prudent, but did not\nremove all danger.\n\nYet, notwithstanding the difficulties of the descent, down steeps\nunknown to the guide, the journey was accomplished without accidents,\nexcept the loss of a coil of rope, which escaped from the hands of an\nIcelander, and took the shortest way to the bottom of the abyss.\n\nAt mid-day we arrived. I raised my head and saw straight above me the\nupper aperture of the cone, framing a bit of sky of very small\ncircumference, but almost perfectly round. Just upon the edge\nappeared the snowy peak of Saris, standing out sharp and clear\nagainst endless space.\n\nAt the bottom of the crater were three chimneys, through which, in\nits eruptions, Sn\u00e6fell had driven forth fire and lava from its\ncentral furnace. Each of these chimneys was a hundred feet in\ndiameter. They gaped before us right in our path. I had not the\ncourage to look down either of them. But Professor Liedenbrock had\nhastily surveyed all three; he was panting, running from one to the\nother, gesticulating, and uttering incoherent expressions. Hans and\nhis comrades, seated upon loose lava rocks, looked at him with as much\nwonder as they knew how to express, and perhaps taking him for an\nescaped lunatic.\n\nSuddenly my uncle uttered a cry. I thought his foot must have slipped\nand that he had fallen down one of the holes. But, no; I saw him,\nwith arms outstretched and legs straddling wide apart, erect before a\ngranite rock that stood in the centre of the crater, just like a\npedestal made ready to receive a statue of Pluto. He stood like a man\nstupefied, but the stupefaction soon gave way to delirious rapture.\n\n\"Axel, Axel,\" he cried. \"Come, come!\"\n\nI ran. Hans and the Icelanders never stirred.\n\n\"Look!\" cried the Professor.\n\nAnd, sharing his astonishment, but I think not his joy, I read on the\nwestern face of the block, in Runic characters, half mouldered away\nwith lapse of ages, this thrice-accursed name:\n\n[At this point a Runic text appears]\n\n\"Arne Saknussemm!\" replied my uncle. \"Do you yet doubt?\"\n\nI made no answer; and I returned in silence to my lava seat in a\nstate of utter speechless consternation. Here was crushing evidence.\n\nHow long I remained plunged in agonizing reflections I cannot tell;\nall that I know is, that on raising my head again, I saw only my\nuncle and Hans at the bottom of the crater. The Icelanders had been\ndismissed, and they were now descending the outer slopes of Sn\u00e6fell\nto return to Stapi.\n\nHans slept peaceably at the foot of a rock, in a lava bed, where he\nhad found a suitable couch for himself; but my uncle was pacing\naround the bottom of the crater like a wild beast in a cage. I had\nneither the wish nor the strength to rise, and following the guide's\nexample I went off into an unhappy slumber, fancying I could hear\nominous noises or feel tremblings within the recesses of the mountain.\n\nThus the first night in the crater passed away.\n\nThe next morning, a grey, heavy, cloudy sky seemed to droop over the\nsummit of the cone. I did not know this first from the appearances of\nnature, but I found it out by my uncle's impetuous wrath.\n\nI soon found out the cause, and hope dawned again in my heart. For\nthis reason.\n\nOf the three ways open before us, one had been taken by Saknussemm.\nThe indications of the learned Icelander hinted at in the cryptogram,\npointed to this fact that the shadow of Scartaris came to touch that\nparticular way during the latter days of the month of June.\n\nThat sharp peak might hence be considered as the gnomon of a vast sun\ndial, the shadow projected from which on a certain day would point\nout the road to the centre of the earth.\n\nNow, no sun no shadow, and therefore no guide. Here was June 25. If\nthe sun was clouded for six days we must postpone our visit till next\nyear.\n\nMy limited powers of description would fail, were I to attempt a\npicture of the Professor's angry impatience. The day wore on, and no\nshadow came to lay itself along the bottom of the crater. Hans did\nnot move from the spot he had selected; yet he must be asking himself\nwhat were we waiting for, if he asked himself anything at all. My\nuncle spoke not a word to me. His gaze, ever directed upwards, was\nlost in the grey and misty space beyond.\n\nOn the 26th nothing yet. Rain mingled with snow was falling all day\nlong. Hans built a hut of pieces of lava. I felt a malicious pleasure\nin watching the thousand rills and cascades that came tumbling down\nthe sides of the cone, and the deafening continuous din awaked by\nevery stone against which they bounded.\n\nMy uncle's rage knew no bounds. It was enough to irritate a meeker\nman than he; for it was foundering almost within the port.\n\nBut Heaven never sends unmixed grief, and for Professor Liedenbrock\nthere was a satisfaction in store proportioned to his desperate\nanxieties.\n\nThe next day the sky was again overcast; but on the 29th of June, the\nlast day but one of the month, with the change of the moon came a\nchange of weather. The sun poured a flood of light down the crater.\nEvery hillock, every rock and stone, every projecting surface, had\nits share of the beaming torrent, and threw its shadow on the ground.\nAmongst them all, Scartaris laid down his sharp-pointed angular\nshadow which began to move slowly in the opposite direction to that\nof the radiant orb.\n\nMy uncle turned too, and followed it.\n\nAt noon, being at its least extent, it came and softly fell upon the\nedge of the middle chimney.\n\n\"There it is! there it is!\" shouted the Professor.\n\n\"Now for the centre of the globe!\" he added in Danish.\n\nI looked at Hans, to hear what he would say.\n\n\"_For\u00fct!_\" was his tranquil answer.\n\n\"Forward!\" replied my uncle.\n\nIt was thirteen minutes past one.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\nVERTICAL DESCENT\n\n\nNow began our real journey. Hitherto our toil had overcome all\ndifficulties, now difficulties would spring up at every step.\n\nI had not yet ventured to look down the bottomless pit into which I\nwas about to take a plunge. The supreme hour had come. I might now\neither share in the enterprise or refuse to move forward. But I was\nashamed to recoil in the presence of the hunter. Hans accepted the\nenterprise with such calmness, such indifference, such perfect\ndisregard of any possible danger that I blushed at the idea of being\nless brave than he. If I had been alone I might have once more tried\nthe effect of argument; but in the presence of the guide I held my\npeace; my heart flew back to my sweet Virlandaise, and I approached\nthe central chimney.\n\nI have already mentioned that it was a hundred feet in diameter, and\nthree hundred feet round. I bent over a projecting rock and gazed\ndown. My hair stood on end with terror. The bewildering feeling of\nvacuity laid hold upon me. I felt my centre of gravity shifting its\nplace, and giddiness mounting into my brain like drunkenness. There\nis nothing more treacherous than this attraction down deep abysses. I\nwas just about to drop down, when a hand laid hold of me. It was that\nof Hans. I suppose I had not taken as many lessons on gulf\nexploration as I ought to have done in the Frelsers Kirk at\nCopenhagen.\n\nBut, however short was my examination of this well, I had taken some\naccount of its conformation. Its almost perpendicular walls were\nbristling with innumerable projections which would facilitate the\ndescent. But if there was no want of steps, still there was no rail.\nA rope fastened to the edge of the aperture might have helped us\ndown. But how were we to unfasten it, when arrived at the other end?\n\nMy uncle employed a very simple expedient to obviate this difficulty.\nHe uncoiled a cord of the thickness of a finger, and four hundred\nfeet long; first he dropped half of it down, then he passed it round\na lava block that projected conveniently, and threw the other half\ndown the chimney. Each of us could then descend by holding with the\nhand both halves of the rope, which would not be able to unroll\nitself from its hold; when two hundred feet down, it would be easy to\nget possession of the whole of the rope by letting one end go and\npulling down by the other. Then the exercise would go on again _ad\ninfinitum_.\n\n\"Now,\" said my uncle, after having completed these preparations, \"now\nlet us look to our loads. I will divide them into three lots; each of\nus will strap one upon his back. I mean only fragile articles.\"\n\nOf course, we were not included under that head.\n\n\"Hans,\" said he, \"will take charge of the tools and a portion of the\nprovisions; you, Axel, will take another third of the provisions, and\nthe arms; and I will take the rest of the provisions and the delicate\ninstruments.\"\n\n\"But,\" said I, \"the clothes, and that mass of ladders and ropes, what\nis to become of them?\"\n\n\"They will go down by themselves.\"\n\n\"How so?\" I asked.\n\n\"You will see presently.\"\n\nMy uncle was always willing to employ magnificent resources. Obeying\norders, Hans tied all the non-fragile articles in one bundle, corded\nthem firmly, and sent them bodily down the gulf before us.\n\nI listened to the dull thuds of the descending bale. My uncle,\nleaning over the abyss, followed the descent of the luggage with a\nsatisfied nod, and only rose erect when he had quite lost sight of it.\n\n\"Very well, now it is our turn.\"\n\nNow I ask any sensible man if it was possible to hear those words\nwithout a shudder.\n\nThe Professor fastened his package of instruments upon his shoulders;\nHans took the tools; I took the arms: and the descent commenced in\nthe following order; Hans, my uncle, and myself. It was effected in\nprofound silence, broken only by the descent of loosened stones down\nthe dark gulf.\n\nI dropped as it were, frantically clutching the double cord with one\nhand and buttressing myself from the wall with the other by means of\nmy stick. One idea overpowered me almost, fear lest the rock should\ngive way from which I was hanging. This cord seemed a fragile thing\nfor three persons to be suspended from. I made as little use of it as\npossible, performing wonderful feats of equilibrium upon the lava\nprojections which my foot seemed to catch hold of like a hand.\n\nWhen one of these slippery steps shook under the heavier form of\nHans, he said in his tranquil voice:\n\n\"_Gif akt!_\"\n\n\"Attention!\" repeated my uncle.\n\nIn half an hour we were standing upon the surface of a rock jammed in\nacross the chimney from one side to the other.\n\nHans pulled the rope by one of its ends, the other rose in the air;\nafter passing the higher rock it came down again, bringing with it a\nrather dangerous shower of bits of stone and lava.\n\nLeaning over the edge of our narrow standing ground, I observed that\nthe bottom of the hole was still invisible.\n\nThe same manoeuvre was repeated with the cord, and half an hour after\nwe had descended another two hundred feet.\n\nI don't suppose the maddest geologist under such circumstances would\nhave studied the nature of the rocks that we were passing. I am sure\nI did trouble my head about them. Pliocene, miocene, eocene,\ncretaceous, jurassic, triassic, permian, carboniferous, devonian,\nsilurian, or primitive was all one to me. But the Professor, no\ndoubt, was pursuing his observations or taking notes, for in one of\nour halts he said to me:\n\n\"The farther I go the more confidence I feel. The order of these\nvolcanic formations affords the strongest confirmation to the\ntheories of Davy. We are now among the primitive rocks, upon which\nthe chemical operations took place which are produced by the contact\nof elementary bases of metals with water. I repudiate the notion of\ncentral heat altogether. We shall see further proof of that very\nsoon.\"\n\nNo variation, always the same conclusion. Of course, I was not\ninclined to argue. My silence was taken for consent and the descent\nwent on.\n\nAnother three hours, and I saw no bottom to the chimney yet. When I\nlifted my head I perceived the gradual contraction of its aperture.\nIts walls, by a gentle incline, were drawing closer to each other,\nand it was beginning to grow darker.\n\nStill we kept descending. It seemed to me that the falling stones\nwere meeting with an earlier resistance, and that the concussion gave\na more abrupt and deadened sound.\n\nAs I had taken care to keep an exact account of our manoeuvres with\nthe rope, which I knew that we had repeated fourteen times, each\ndescent occupying half an hour, the conclusion was easy that we had\nbeen seven hours, plus fourteen quarters of rest, making ten hours\nand a half. We had started at one, it must therefore now be eleven\no'clock; and the depth to which we had descended was fourteen times\n200 feet, or 2,800 feet.\n\nAt this moment I heard the voice of Hans.\n\n\"Halt!\" he cried.\n\nI stopped short just as I was going to place my feet upon my uncle's\nhead.\n\n\"We are there,\" he cried.\n\n\"Where?\" said I, stepping near to him.\n\n\"At the bottom of the perpendicular chimney,\" he answered.\n\n\"Is there no way farther?\"\n\n\"Yes; there is a sort of passage which inclines to the right. We will\nsee about that to-morrow. Let us have our supper, and go to sleep.\"\n\nThe darkness was not yet complete. The provision case was opened; we\nrefreshed ourselves, and went to sleep as well as we could upon a bed\nof stones and lava fragments.\n\nWhen lying on my back, I opened my eyes and saw a bright sparkling\npoint of light at the extremity of the gigantic tube 3,000 feet long,\nnow a vast telescope.\n\nIt was a star which, seen from this depth, had lost all\nscintillation, and which by my computation should be  46; _Ursa\nminor._ Then I fell fast asleep.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\nTHE WONDERS OF TERRESTRIAL DEPTHS\n\n\nAt eight in the morning a ray of daylight came to wake us up. The\nthousand shining surfaces of lava on the walls received it on its\npassage, and scattered it like a shower of sparks.\n\nThere was light enough to distinguish surrounding objects.\n\n\"Well, Axel, what do you say to it?\" cried my uncle, rubbing his\nhands. \"Did you ever spend a quieter night in our little house at\nK\u00f6nigsberg? No noise of cart wheels, no cries of basket women, no\nboatmen shouting!\"\n\n\"No doubt it is very quiet at the bottom of this well, but there is\nsomething alarming in the quietness itself.\"\n\n\"Now come!\" my uncle cried; \"if you are frightened already, what will\nyou be by and by? We have not gone a single inch yet into the bowels\nof the earth.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean that we have only reached the level of the island, long\nvertical tube, which terminates at the mouth of the crater, has its\nlower end only at the level of the sea.\"\n\n\"Are you sure of that?\"\n\n\"Quite sure. Consult the barometer.\"\n\nIn fact, the mercury, which had risen in the instrument as fast as we\ndescended, had stopped at twenty-nine inches.\n\n\"You see,\" said the Professor, \"we have now only the pressure of our\natmosphere, and I shall be glad when the aneroid takes the place of\nthe barometer.\"\n\nAnd in truth this instrument would become useless as soon as the\nweight of the atmosphere should exceed the pressure ascertained at\nthe level of the sea.\n\n\"But,\" I said, \"is there not reason to fear that this ever-increasing\npressure will become at last very painful to bear?\"\n\n\"No; we shall descend at a slow rate, and our lungs will become\ninured to a denser atmosphere. Aeronauts find the want of air as they\nrise to high elevations, but we shall perhaps have too much: of the\ntwo, this is what I should prefer. Don't let us lose a moment. Where\nis the bundle we sent down before us?\"\n\nI then remembered that we had searched for it in vain the evening\nbefore. My uncle questioned Hans, who, after having examined\nattentively with the eye of a huntsman, replied:\n\n\"_Der huppe!_\"\n\n\"Up there.\"\n\nAnd so it was. The bundle had been caught by a projection a hundred\nfeet above us. Immediately the Icelander climbed up like a cat, and\nin a few minutes the package was in our possession.\n\n\"Now,\" said my uncle, \"let us breakfast; but we must lay in a good\nstock, for we don't know how long we may have to go on.\"\n\nThe biscuit and extract of meat were washed down with a draught of\nwater mingled with a little gin.\n\nBreakfast over, my uncle drew from his pocket a small notebook,\nintended for scientific observations. He consulted his instruments,\nand recorded:\n\n\"Monday, July 1.\n\n\"Chronometer, 8.17 a.m.; barometer, 297 in.; thermometer, 6\u00b0 (43\u00b0\nF.). Direction, E.S.E.\"\n\nThis last observation applied to the dark gallery, and was indicated\nby the compass.\n\n\"Now, Axel,\" cried the Professor with enthusiasm, \"now we are really\ngoing into the interior of the earth. At this precise moment the\njourney commences.\"\n\nSo saying, my uncle took in one hand Ruhmkorff's apparatus, which was\nhanging from his neck; and with the other he formed an electric\ncommunication with the coil in the lantern, and a sufficiently bright\nlight dispersed the darkness of the passage.\n\nHans carried the other apparatus, which was also put into action.\nThis ingenious application of electricity would enable us to go on\nfor a long time by creating an artificial light even in the midst of\nthe most inflammable gases.\n\n\"Now, march!\" cried my uncle.\n\nEach shouldered his package. Hans drove before him the load of cords\nand clothes; and, myself walking last, we entered the gallery.\n\nAt the moment of becoming engulfed in this dark gallery, I raised my\nhead, and saw for the last time through the length of that vast tube\nthe sky of Iceland, which I was never to behold again.\n\nThe lava, in the last eruption of 1229, had forced a passage through\nthis tunnel. It still lined the walls with a thick and glistening\ncoat. The electric light was here intensified a hundredfold by\nreflection.\n\nThe only difficulty in proceeding lay in not sliding too fast down an\nincline of about forty-five degrees; happily certain asperities and a\nfew blisterings here and there formed steps, and we descended,\nletting our baggage slip before us from the end of a long rope.\n\nBut that which formed steps under our feet became stalactites\noverhead. The lava, which was porous in many places, had formed a\nsurface covered with small rounded blisters; crystals of opaque\nquartz, set with limpid tears of glass, and hanging like clustered\nchandeliers from the vaulted roof, seemed as it were to kindle and\nform a sudden illumination as we passed on our way. It seemed as if\nthe genii of the depths were lighting up their palace to receive\ntheir terrestrial guests.\n\n\"It is magnificent!\" I cried spontaneously. \"My uncle, what a sight!\nDon't you admire those blending hues of lava, passing from reddish\nbrown to bright yellow by imperceptible shades? And these crystals\nare just like globes of light.\"\n\n\"Ali, you think so, do you, Axel, my boy? Well, you will see greater\nsplendours than these, I hope. Now let us march: march!\"\n\nHe had better have said slide, for we did nothing but drop down the\nsteep inclines. It was the facifs _descensus Averni_ of Virgil. The\ncompass, which I consulted frequently, gave our direction as\nsouth-east with inflexible steadiness. This lava stream deviated\nneither to the right nor to the left.\n\nYet there was no sensible increase of temperature. This justified\nDavy's theory, and more than once I consulted the thermometer with\nsurprise. Two hours after our departure it only marked 10\u00b0 (50\u00b0\nFahr.), an increase of only 4\u00b0. This gave reason for believing that\nour descent was more horizontal than vertical. As for the exact depth\nreached, it was very easy to ascertain that; the Professor measured\naccurately the angles of deviation and inclination on the road, but\nhe kept the results to himself.\n\nAbout eight in the evening he signalled to stop. Hans sat down at\nonce. The lamps were hung upon a projection in the lava; we were in a\nsort of cavern where there was plenty of air. Certain puffs of air\nreached us. What atmospheric disturbance was the cause of them? I\ncould not answer that question at the moment. Hunger and fatigue made\nme incapable of reasoning. A descent of seven hours consecutively is\nnot made without considerable expenditure of strength. I was\nexhausted. The order to 'halt' therefore gave me pleasure. Hans laid\nour provisions upon a block of lava, and we ate with a good appetite.\nBut one thing troubled me, our supply of water was half consumed. My\nuncle reckoned upon a fresh supply from subterranean sources, but\nhitherto we had met with none. I could not help drawing his attention\nto this circumstance.\n\n\"Are you surprised at this want of springs?\" he said.\n\n\"More than that, I am anxious about it; we have only water enough for\nfive days.\"\n\n\"Don't be uneasy, Axel, we shall find more than we want.\"\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"When we have left this bed of lava behind us. How could springs\nbreak through such walls as these?\"\n\n\"But perhaps this passage runs to a very great depth. It seems to me\nthat we have made no great progress vertically.\"\n\n\"Why do you suppose that?\"\n\n\"Because if we had gone deep into the crust of earth, we should have\nencountered greater heat.\"\n\n\"According to your system,\" said my uncle. \"But what does the\nthermometer say?\"\n\n\"Hardly fifteen degrees (59\u00b0 Fahr), nine degrees only since our\ndeparture.\"\n\n\"Well, what is your conclusion?\"\n\n\"This is my conclusion. According to exact observations, the increase\nof temperature in the interior of the globe advances at the rate of\none degree (1 4/5\u00b0 Fahr.) for every hundred feet. But certain local\nconditions may modify this rate. Thus at Yakoutsk in Siberia the\nincrease of a degree is ascertained to be reached every 36 feet. This\ndifference depends upon the heat-conducting power of the rocks.\nMoreover, in the neighbourhood of an extinct volcano, through gneiss,\nit has been observed that the increase of a degree is only attained\nat every 125 feet. Let us therefore assume this last hypothesis as\nthe most suitable to our situation, and calculate.\"\n\n\"Well, do calculate, my boy.\"\n\n\"Nothing is easier,\" said I, putting down figures in my note book.\n\"Nine times a hundred and twenty-five feet gives a depth of eleven\nhundred and twenty-five feet.\"\n\n\"Very accurate indeed.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"By my observation we are at 10,000 feet below the level of the sea.\"\n\n\"Is that possible?\"\n\n\"Yes, or figures are of no use.\"\n\nThe Professor's calculations were quite correct. We had already\nattained a depth of six thousand feet beyond that hitherto reached by\nthe foot of man, such as the mines of Kitz Bahl in Tyrol, and those\nof Wuttembourg in Bohemia.\n\nThe temperature, which ought to have been 81\u00b0 (178\u00b0 Fahr.) was\nscarcely 15\u00b0 (59\u00b0 Fahr.). Here was cause for reflection.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\nGEOLOGICAL STUDIES IN SITU\n\n\nNext day, Tuesday, June 30, at 6 a.m., the descent began again.\n\nWe were still following the gallery of lava, a real natural\nstaircase, and as gently sloping as those inclined planes which in\nsome old houses are still found instead of flights of steps. And so\nwe went on until 12.17, the, precise moment when we overtook Hans,\nwho had stopped.\n\n\"Ah! here we are,\" exclaimed my uncle, \"at the very end of the\nchimney.\"\n\nI looked around me. We were standing at the intersection of two\nroads, both dark and narrow. Which were we to take? This was a\ndifficulty.\n\nStill my uncle refused to admit an appearance of hesitation, either\nbefore me or the guide; he pointed out the Eastern tunnel, and we\nwere soon all three in it.\n\nBesides there would have been interminable hesitation before this\nchoice of roads; for since there was no indication whatever to guide\nour choice, we were obliged to trust to chance.\n\nThe slope of this gallery was scarcely perceptible, and its sections\nvery unequal. Sometimes we passed a series of arches succeeding each\nother like the majestic arcades of a gothic cathedral. Here the\narchitects of the middle ages might have found studies for every form\nof the sacred art which sprang from the development of the pointed\narch. A mile farther we had to bow our heads under corniced elliptic\narches in the romanesque style; and massive pillars standing out from\nthe wall bent under the spring of the vault that rested heavily upon\nthem. In other places this magnificence gave way to narrow channels\nbetween low structures which looked like beaver's huts, and we had to\ncreep along through extremely narrow passages.\n\nThe heat was perfectly bearable. Involuntarily I began to think of\nits heat when the lava thrown out by Sn\u00e6fell was boiling and working\nthrough this now silent road. I imagined the torrents of fire hurled\nback at every angle in the gallery, and the accumulation of intensely\nheated vapours in the midst of this confined channel.\n\nI only hope, thought I, that this so-called extinct volcano won't\ntake a fancy in his old age to begin his sports again!\n\nI abstained from communicating these fears to Professor Liedenbrock. He\nwould never have understood them at all. He had but one idea--forward!\nHe walked, he slid, he scrambled, he tumbled, with a persistency which\none could not but admire.\n\nBy six in the evening, after a not very fatiguing walk, we had gone\ntwo leagues south, but scarcely a quarter of a mile down.\n\nMy uncle said it was time to go to sleep. We ate without talking, and\nwent to sleep without reflection.\n\nOur arrangements for the night were very simple; a railway rug each,\ninto which we rolled ourselves, was our sole covering. We had neither\ncold nor intrusive visits to fear. Travellers who penetrate into the\nwilds of central Africa, and into the pathless forests of the New\nWorld, are obliged to watch over each other by night. But we enjoyed\nabsolute safety and utter seclusion; no savages or wild beasts\ninfested these silent depths.\n\nNext morning, we awoke fresh and in good spirits. The road was\nresumed. As the day before, we followed the path of the lava. It was\nimpossible to tell what rocks we were passing: the tunnel, instead of\ntending lower, approached more and more nearly to a horizontal\ndirection, I even fancied a slight rise. But about ten this upward\ntendency became so evident, and therefore so fatiguing, that I was\nobliged to slacken my pace.\n\n\"Well, Axel?\" demanded the Professor impatiently.\n\n\"Well, I cannot stand it any longer,\" I replied.\n\n\"What! after three hours' walk over such easy ground.\"\n\n\"It may be easy, but it is tiring all the same.\"\n\n\"What, when we have nothing to do but keep going down!\"\n\n\"Going up, if you please.\"\n\n\"Going up!\" said my uncle, with a shrug.\n\n\"No doubt, for the last half-hour the inclines have gone the other\nway, and at this rate we shall soon arrive upon the level soil of\nIceland.\"\n\nThe Professor nodded slowly and uneasily like a man that declines to\nbe convinced. I tried to resume the conversation. He answered not a\nword, and gave the signal for a start. I saw that his silence was\nnothing but ill-humour.\n\nStill I had courageously shouldered my burden again, and was rapidly\nfollowing Hans, whom my uncle preceded. I was anxious not to be left\nbehind. My greatest care was not to lose sight of my companions. I\nshuddered at the thought of being lost in the mazes of this vast\nsubterranean labyrinth.\n\nBesides, if the ascending road did become steeper, I was comforted\nwith the thought that it was bringing us nearer to the surface. There\nwas hope in this. Every step confirmed me in it, and I was rejoicing\nat the thought of meeting my little Gr\u00e4uben again.\n\nBy mid-day there was a change in the appearance of this wall of the\ngallery. I noticed it by a diminution of the amount of light\nreflected from the sides; solid rock was appearing in the place of\nthe lava coating. The mass was composed of inclined and sometimes\nvertical strata. We were passing through rocks of the transition or\nsilurian [1] system.\n\n\"It is evident,\" I cried, \"the marine deposits formed in the second\nperiod, these shales, limestones, and sandstones. We are turning away\nfrom the primary granite. We are just as if we were people of Hamburg\ngoing to L\u00fcbeck by way of Hanover!\"\n\nI had better have kept my observations to myself. But my geological\ninstinct was stronger than my prudence, and uncle Liedenbrock heard\nmy exclamation.\n\n\"What's that you are saying?\" he asked.\n\n\"See,\" I said, pointing to the varied series of sandstones and\nlimestones, and the first indication of slate.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"We are at the period when the first plants and animals appeared.\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\"\n\n\"Look close, and examine.\"\n\nI obliged the Professor to move his lamp over the walls of the\ngallery. I expected some signs of astonishment; but he spoke not a\nword, and went on.\n\nHad he understood me or not? Did he refuse to admit, out of self-love\nas an uncle and a philosopher, that he had mistaken his way when he\nchose the eastern tunnel? or was he determined to examine this\npassage to its farthest extremity? It was evident that we had left\nthe lava path, and that this road could not possibly lead to the\nextinct furnace of Sn\u00e6fell.\n\nYet I asked myself if I was not depending too much on this change in\nthe rock. Might I not myself be mistaken? Were we really crossing the\nlayers of rock which overlie the granite foundation?\n\n[1]The name given by Sir Roderick Murchison to a vast series of\nfossiliferous strata, which lies between the non-fossiliferous slaty\nschists below and the old red sandstone above. The system is well\ndeveloped in the region of Shropshire, etc., once inhabited by the\nSilures under Caractacus, or Caradoc. (Tr.)\n\nIf I am right, I thought, I must soon find some fossil remains of\nprimitive life; and then we must yield to evidence. I will look.\n\nI had not gone a hundred paces before incontestable proofs presented\nthemselves. It could not be otherwise, for in the Silurian age the\nseas contained at least fifteen hundred vegetable and animal species.\nMy feet, which had become accustomed to the indurated lava floor,\nsuddenly rested upon a dust composed of the _debris_ of plants and\nshells. In the walls were distinct impressions of fucoids and\nlycopodites.\n\nProfessor Liedenbrock could not be mistaken, I thought, and yet he\npushed on, with, I suppose, his eyes resolutely shut.\n\nThis was only invincible obstinacy. I could hold out no longer. I\npicked up a perfectly formed shell, which had belonged to an animal\nnot unlike the woodlouse: then, joining my uncle, I said:\n\n\"Look at this!\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said he quietly, \"it is the shell of a crustacean, of an\nextinct species called a trilobite. Nothing more.\"\n\n\"But don't you conclude--?\"\n\n\"Just what you conclude yourself. Yes; I do, perfectly. We have left\nthe granite and the lava. It is possible that I may be mistaken. But\nI cannot be sure of that until I have reached the very end of this\ngallery.\"\n\n\"You are right in doing this, my uncle, and I should quite approve of\nyour determination, if there were not a danger threatening us nearer\nand nearer.\"\n\n\"What danger?\"\n\n\"The want of water.\"\n\n\"Well, Axel, we will put ourselves upon rations.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\nTHE FIRST SIGNS OF DISTRESS\n\n\nIn fact, we had to ration ourselves. Our provision of water could not\nlast more than three days. I found that out for certain when\nsupper-time came. And, to our sorrow, we had little reason to expect\nto find a spring in these transition beds.\n\nThe whole of the next day the gallery opened before us its endless\narcades. We moved on almost without a word. Hans' silence seemed to\nbe infecting us.\n\nThe road was now not ascending, at least not perceptibly. Sometimes,\neven, it seemed to have a slight fall. But this tendency, which was\nvery trifling, could not do anything to reassure the Professor; for\nthere was no change in the beds, and the transitional characteristics\nbecame more and more decided.\n\nThe electric light was reflected in sparkling splendour from the\nschist, limestone, and old red sandstone of the walls. It might have\nbeen thought that we were passing through a section of Wales, of\nwhich an ancient people gave its name to this system. Specimens of\nmagnificent marbles clothed the walls, some of a greyish agate\nfantastically veined with white, others of rich crimson or yellow\ndashed with splotches of red; then came dark cherry-coloured marbles\nrelieved by the lighter tints of limestone.\n\nThe greater part of these bore impressions of primitive organisms.\nCreation had evidently advanced since the day before. Instead of\nrudimentary trilobites, I noticed remains of a more perfect order of\nbeings, amongst others ganoid fishes and some of those sauroids in\nwhich palaeontologists have discovered the earliest reptile forms.\nThe Devonian seas were peopled by animals of these species, and\ndeposited them by thousands in the rocks of the newer formation.\n\nIt was evident that we were ascending that scale of animal life in\nwhich man fills the highest place. But Professor Liedenbrock seemed\nnot to notice it.\n\nHe was awaiting one of two events, either the appearance of a\nvertical well opening before his feet, down which our descent might\nbe resumed, or that of some obstacle which should effectually turn us\nback on our own footsteps. But evening came and neither wish was\ngratified.\n\nOn Friday, after a night during which I felt pangs of thirst, our\nlittle troop again plunged into the winding passages of the gallery.\n\nAfter ten hours' walking I observed a singular deadening of the\nreflection of our lamps from the side walls. The marble, the schist,\nthe limestone, and the sandstone were giving way to a dark and\nlustreless lining. At one moment, the tunnel becoming very narrow, I\nleaned against the wall.\n\nWhen I removed my hand it was black. I looked nearer, and found we\nwere in a coal formation.\n\n\"A coal mine!\" I cried.\n\n\"A mine without miners,\" my uncle replied.\n\n\"Who knows?\" I asked.\n\n\"I know,\" the Professor pronounced decidedly, \"I am certain that this\ngallery driven through beds of coal was never pierced by the hand of\nman. But whether it be the hand of nature or not does not matter.\nSupper time is come; let us sup.\"\n\nHans prepared some food. I scarcely ate, and I swallowed down the few\ndrops of water rationed out to me. One flask half full was all we had\nleft to slake the thirst of three men.\n\nAfter their meal my two companions laid themselves down upon their\nrugs, and found in sleep a solace for their fatigue. But I could not\nsleep, and I counted every hour until morning.\n\nOn Saturday, at six, we started afresh. In twenty minutes we reached\na vast open space; I then knew that the hand of man had not hollowed\nout this mine; the vaults would have been shored up, and, as it was,\nthey seemed to be held up by a miracle of equilibrium.\n\nThis cavern was about a hundred feet wide and a hundred and fifty in\nheight. A large mass had been rent asunder by a subterranean\ndisturbance. Yielding to some vast power from below it had broken\nasunder, leaving this great hollow into which human beings were now\npenetrating for the first time.\n\nThe whole history of the carboniferous period was written upon these\ngloomy walls, and a geologist might with ease trace all its diverse\nphases. The beds of coal were separated by strata of sandstone or\ncompact clays, and appeared crushed under the weight of overlying\nstrata.\n\nAt the age of the world which preceded the secondary period, the\nearth was clothed with immense vegetable forms, the product of the\ndouble influence of tropical heat and constant moisture; a vapoury\natmosphere surrounded the earth, still veiling the direct rays of the\nsun.\n\nThence arises the conclusion that the high temperature then existing\nwas due to some other source than the heat of the sun. Perhaps even\nthe orb of day may not have been ready yet to play the splendid part\nhe now acts. There were no 'climates' as yet, and a torrid heat,\nequal from pole to equator, was spread over the whole surface of the\nglobe. Whence this heat? Was it from the interior of the earth?\n\nNotwithstanding the theories of Professor Liedenbrock, a violent heat\ndid at that time brood within the body of the spheroid. Its action\nwas felt to the very last coats of the terrestrial crust; the plants,\nunacquainted with the beneficent influences of the sun, yielded\nneither flowers nor scent. But their roots drew vigorous life from\nthe burning soil of the early days of this planet.\n\nThere were but few trees. Herbaceous plants alone existed. There were\ntall grasses, ferns, lycopods, besides sigillaria, asterophyllites,\nnow scarce plants, but then the species might be counted by thousands.\n\nThe coal measures owe their origin to this period of profuse\nvegetation. The yet elastic and yielding crust of the earth obeyed\nthe fluid forces beneath. Thence innumerable fissures and\ndepressions. The plants, sunk underneath the waters, formed by\ndegrees into vast accumulated masses.\n\nThen came the chemical action of nature; in the depths of the seas\nthe vegetable accumulations first became peat; then, acted upon by\ngenerated gases and the heat of fermentation, they underwent a\nprocess of complete mineralization.\n\nThus were formed those immense coalfields, which nevertheless, are\nnot inexhaustible, and which three centuries at the present\naccelerated rate of consumption will exhaust unless the industrial\nworld will devise a remedy.\n\nThese reflections came into my mind whilst I was contemplating the\nmineral wealth stored up in this portion of the globe. These no\ndoubt, I thought, will never be discovered; the working of such deep\nmines would involve too large an outlay, and where would be the use\nas long as coal is yet spread far and wide near the surface? Such as\nmy eyes behold these virgin stores, such they will be when this world\ncomes to an end.\n\nBut still we marched on, and I alone was forgetting the length of the\nway by losing myself in the midst of geological contemplations. The\ntemperature remained what it had been during our passage through the\nlava and schists. Only my sense of smell was forcibly affected by an\nodour of protocarburet of hydrogen. I immediately recognised in this\ngallery the presence of a considerable quantity of the dangerous gas\ncalled by miners firedamp, the explosion of which has often\noccasioned such dreadful catastrophes.\n\nHappily, our light was from Ruhmkorff's ingenious apparatus. If\nunfortunately we had explored this gallery with torches, a terrible\nexplosion would have put an end to travelling and travellers at one\nstroke.\n\nThis excursion through the coal mine lasted till night. My uncle\nscarcely could restrain his impatience at the horizontal road. The\ndarkness, always deep twenty yards before us, prevented us from\nestimating the length of the gallery; and I was beginning to think it\nmust be endless, when suddenly at six o'clock a wall very\nunexpectedly stood before us. Right or left, top or bottom, there was\nno road farther; we were at the end of a blind alley. \"Very well,\nit's all right!\" cried my uncle, \"now, at any rate, we shall know\nwhat we are about. We are not in Saknussemm's road, and all we have\nto do is to go back. Let us take a night's rest, and in three days we\nshall get to the fork in the road.\" \"Yes,\" said I, \"if we have any\nstrength left.\" \"Why not?\" \"Because to-morrow we shall have no\nwater.\" \"Nor courage either?\" asked my uncle severely. I dared make\nno answer.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\nCOMPASSION FUSES THE PROFESSOR'S HEART\n\n\nNext day we started early. We had to hasten forward. It was a three\ndays' march to the cross roads.\n\nI will not speak of the sufferings we endured in our return. My uncle\nbore them with the angry impatience of a man obliged to own his\nweakness; Hans with the resignation of his passive nature; I, I\nconfess, with complaints and expressions of despair. I had no spirit\nto oppose this ill fortune.\n\nAs I had foretold, the water failed entirely by the end of the first\nday's retrograde march. Our fluid aliment was now nothing but gin;\nbut this infernal fluid burned my throat, and I could not even endure\nthe sight of it. I found the temperature and the air stifling.\nFatigue paralysed my limbs. More than once I dropped down motionless.\nThen there was a halt; and my uncle and the Icelander did their best\nto restore me. But I saw that the former was struggling painfully\nagainst excessive fatigue and the tortures of thirst.\n\nAt last, on Tuesday, July 8, we arrived on our hands and knees, and\nhalf dead, at the junction of the two roads. There I dropped like a\nlifeless lump, extended on the lava soil. It was ten in the morning.\n\nHans and my uncle, clinging to the wall, tried to nibble a few bits\nof biscuit. Long moans escaped from my swollen lips.\n\nAfter some time my uncle approached me and raised me in his arms.\n\n\"Poor boy!\" said he, in genuine tones of compassion.\n\nI was touched with these words, not being accustomed to see the\nexcitable Professor in a softened mood. I grasped his trembling hands\nin mine. He let me hold them and looked at me. His eyes were\nmoistened.\n\nThen I saw him take the flask that was hanging at his side. To my\namazement he placed it on my lips.\n\n\"Drink!\" said he.\n\nHad I heard him? Was my uncle beside himself? I stared at, him\nstupidly, and felt as if I could not understand him.\n\n\"Drink!\" he said again.\n\nAnd raising his flask he emptied it every drop between my lips.\n\nOh! infinite pleasure! a slender sip of water came to moisten my\nburning mouth. It was but one sip but it was enough to recall my\nebbing life.\n\nI thanked my uncle with clasped hands.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"a draught of water; but it is the very last--you\nhear!--the last. I had kept it as a precious treasure at the bottom\nof my flask. Twenty times, nay, a hundred times, have I fought\nagainst a frightful impulse to drink it off. But no, Axel, I kept it\nfor you.\"\n\n\"My dear uncle,\" I said, whilst hot tears trickled down my face.\n\n\"Yes, my poor boy, I knew that as soon as you arrived at these cross\nroads you would drop half dead, and I kept my last drop of water to\nreanimate you.\"\n\n\"Thank you, thank you,\" I said. Although my thirst was only partially\nquenched, yet some strength had returned. The muscles of my throat,\nuntil then contracted, now relaxed again; and the inflammation of my\nlips abated somewhat; and I was now able to speak. .\n\n\"Let us see,\" I said, \"we have now but one thing to do. We have no\nwater; we must go back.\"\n\nWhile I spoke my uncle avoided looking at me; he hung his head down;\nhis eyes avoided mine.\n\n\"We must return,\" I exclaimed vehemently; \"we must go back on our way\nto Sn\u00e6fell. May God give us strength to climb up the crater again!\"\n\n\"Return!\" said my uncle, as if he was rather answering himself than\nme.\n\n\"Yes, return, without the loss of a minute.\"\n\nA long silence followed.\n\n\"So then, Axel,\" replied the Professor ironically, \"you have found no\ncourage or energy in these few drops of water?\"\n\n\"Courage?\"\n\n\"I see you just as feeble-minded as you were before, and still\nexpressing only despair!\"\n\nWhat sort of a man was this I had to do with, and what schemes was he\nnow revolving in his fearless mind?\n\n\"What! you won't go back?\"\n\n\"Should I renounce this expedition just when we have the fairest\nchance of success! Never!\"\n\n\"Then must we resign ourselves to destruction?\"\n\n\"No, Axel, no; go back. Hans will go with you. Leave me to myself!\"\n\n\"Leave you here!\"\n\n\"Leave me, I tell you. I have undertaken this expedition. I will\ncarry it out to the end, and I will not return. Go, Axel, go!\"\n\nMy uncle was in high state of excitement. His voice, which had for a\nmoment been tender and gentle, had now become hard and threatening.\nHe was struggling with gloomy resolutions against impossibilities. I\nwould not leave him in this bottomless abyss, and on the other hand\nthe instinct of self-preservation prompted me to fly.\n\nThe guide watched this scene with his usual phlegmatic unconcern. Yet\nhe understood perfectly well what was going on between his two\ncompanions. The gestures themselves were sufficient to show that we\nwere each bent on taking a different road; but Hans seemed to take no\npart in a question upon which depended his life. He was ready to\nstart at a given signal, or to stay, if his master so willed it.\n\nHow I wished at this moment I could have made him understand me. My\nwords, my complaints, my sorrow would have had some influence over\nthat frigid nature. Those dangers which our guide could not\nunderstand I could have demonstrated and proved to him. Together we\nmight have over-ruled the obstinate Professor; if it were needed, we\nmight perhaps have compelled him to regain the heights of Sn\u00e6fell.\n\nI drew near to Hans. I placed my hand upon his. He made no movement.\nMy parted lips sufficiently revealed my sufferings. The Icelander\nslowly moved his head, and calmly pointing to my uncle said:\n\n\"Master.\"\n\n\"Master!\" I shouted; \"you madman! no, he is not the master of our\nlife; we must fly, we must drag him. Do you hear me? Do you\nunderstand?\"\n\nI had seized Hans by the arm. I wished to oblige him to rise. I\nstrove with him. My uncle interposed.\n\n\"Be calm, Axel! you will get nothing from that immovable servant.\nTherefore, listen to my proposal.\"\n\nI crossed my arms, and confronted my uncle boldly.\n\n\"The want of water,\" he said, \"is the only obstacle in our way. In\nthis eastern gallery made up of lavas, schists, and coal, we have not\nmet with a single particle of moisture. Perhaps we shall be more\nfortunate if we follow the western tunnel.\"\n\nI shook my head incredulously.\n\n\"Hear me to the end,\" the Professor went on with a firm voice.\n\"Whilst you were lying there motionless, I went to examine the\nconformation of that gallery. It penetrates directly downward, and in\na few hours it will bring us to the granite rocks. There we must meet\nwith abundant springs. The nature of the rock assures me of this, and\ninstinct agrees with logic to support my conviction. Now, this is my\nproposal. When Columbus asked of his ships' crews for three days more\nto discover a new world, those crews, disheartened and sick as they\nwere, recognised the justice of the claim, and he discovered America.\nI am the Columbus of this nether world, and I only ask for one more\nday. If in a single day I have not met with the water that we want, I\nswear to you we will return to the surface of the earth.\"\n\nIn spite of my irritation I was moved with these words, as well as\nwith the violence my uncle was doing to his own wishes in making so\nhazardous a proposal.\n\n\"Well,\" I said, \"do as you will, and God reward your superhuman\nenergy. You have now but a few hours to tempt fortune. Let us start!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\nTOTAL FAILURE OF WATER\n\n\nThis time the descent commenced by the new gallery. Hans walked first\nas was his custom.\n\nWe had not gone a hundred yards when the Professor, moving his\nlantern along the walls, cried:\n\n\"Here are primitive rocks. Now we are in the right way. Forward!\"\n\nWhen in its early stages the earth was slowly cooling, its\ncontraction gave rise in its crust to disruptions, distortions,\nfissures, and chasms. The passage through which we were moving was\nsuch a fissure, through which at one time granite poured out in a\nmolten state. Its thousands of windings formed an inextricable\nlabyrinth through the primeval mass.\n\nAs fast as we descended, the succession of beds forming the primitive\nfoundation came out with increasing distinctness. Geologists consider\nthis primitive matter to be the base of the mineral crust of the\nearth, and have ascertained it to be composed of three different\nformations, schist, gneiss, and mica schist, resting upon that\nunchangeable foundation, the granite.\n\nNever had mineralogists found themselves in so marvellous a situation\nto study nature in situ. What the boring machine, an insensible,\ninert instrument, was unable to bring to the surface of the inner\nstructure of the globe, we were able to peruse with our own eyes and\nhandle with our own hands.\n\nThrough the beds of schist, coloured with delicate shades of green,\nran in winding course threads of copper and manganese, with traces of\nplatinum and gold. I thought, what riches are here buried at an\nunapproachable depth in the earth, hidden for ever from the covetous\neyes of the human race! These treasures have been buried at such a\nprofound depth by the convulsions of primeval times that they run no\nchance of ever being molested by the pickaxe or the spade.\n\nTo the schists succeeded gneiss, partially stratified, remarkable for\nthe parallelism and regularity of its lamina, then mica schists, laid\nin large plates or flakes, revealing their lamellated structure by\nthe sparkle of the white shining mica.\n\nThe light from our apparatus, reflected from the small facets of\nquartz, shot sparkling rays at every angle, and I seemed to be moving\nthrough a diamond, within which the quickly darting rays broke across\neach other in a thousand flashing coruscations.\n\nAbout six o'clock this brilliant fete of illuminations underwent a\nsensible abatement of splendour, then almost ceased. The walls\nassumed a crystallised though sombre appearance; mica was more\nclosely mingled with the feldspar and quartz to form the proper rocky\nfoundations of the earth, which bears without distortion or crushing\nthe weight of the four terrestrial systems. We were immured within\nprison walls of granite.\n\nIt was eight in the evening. No signs of water had yet appeared. I\nwas suffering horribly. My uncle strode on. He refused to stop. He\nwas listening anxiously for the murmur of distant springs. But, no,\nthere was dead silence.\n\nAnd now my limbs were failing beneath me. I resisted pain and\ntorture, that I might not stop my uncle, which would have driven him\nto despair, for the day was drawing near to its end, and it was his\nlast.\n\nAt last I failed utterly; I uttered a cry and fell.\n\n\"Come to me, I am dying.\"\n\nMy uncle retraced his steps. He gazed upon me with his arms crossed;\nthen these muttered words passed his lips:\n\n\"It's all over!\"\n\nThe last thing I saw was a fearful gesture of rage, and my eyes\nclosed.\n\nWhen I reopened them I saw my two companions motionless and rolled up\nin their coverings. Were they asleep? As for me, I could not get one\nmoment's sleep. I was suffering too keenly, and what embittered my\nthoughts was that there was no remedy. My uncle's last words echoed\npainfully in my ears: \"it's all over!\" For in such a fearful state of\ndebility it was madness to think of ever reaching the upper world\nagain.\n\nWe had above us a league and a half of terrestrial crust. The weight\nof it seemed to be crushing down upon my shoulders. I felt weighed\ndown, and I exhausted myself with imaginary violent exertions to turn\nround upon my granite couch.\n\nA few hours passed away. A deep silence reigned around us, the\nsilence of the grave. No sound could reach us through walls, the\nthinnest of which were five miles thick.\n\nYet in the midst of my stupefaction I seemed to be aware of a noise.\nIt was dark down the tunnel, but I seemed to see the Icelander\nvanishing from our sight with the lamp in his hand.\n\nWhy was he leaving us? Was Hans going to forsake us? My uncle was\nfast asleep. I wanted to shout, but my voice died upon my parched and\nswollen lips. The darkness became deeper, and the last sound died\naway in the far distance.\n\n\"Hans has abandoned us,\" I cried. \"Hans! Hans!\"\n\nBut these words were only spoken within me. They went no farther. Yet\nafter the first moment of terror I felt ashamed of suspecting a man\nof such extraordinary faithfulness. Instead of ascending he was\ndescending the gallery. An evil design would have taken him up not\ndown. This reflection restored me to calmness, and I turned to other\nthoughts. None but some weighty motive could have induced so quiet a\nman to forfeit his sleep. Was he on a journey of discovery? Had he\nduring the silence of the night caught a sound, a murmuring of\nsomething in the distance, which had failed to affect my hearing?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\nWATER DISCOVERED\n\n\nFor a whole hour I was trying to work out in my delirious brain the\nreasons which might have influenced this seemingly tranquil huntsman.\nThe absurdest notions ran in utter confusion through my mind. I\nthought madness was coming on!\n\nBut at last a noise of footsteps was heard in the dark abyss. Hans\nwas approaching. A flickering light was beginning to glimmer on the\nwall of our darksome prison; then it came out full at the mouth of\nthe gallery. Hans appeared.\n\nHe drew close to my uncle, laid his hand upon his shoulder, and\ngently woke him. My uncle rose up.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" he asked.\n\n\"_Watten!_\" replied the huntsman.\n\nNo doubt under the inspiration of intense pain everybody becomes\nendowed with the gift of divers tongues. I did not know a word of\nDanish, yet instinctively I understood the word he had uttered.\n\n\"Water! water!\" I cried, clapping my hands and gesticulating like a\nmadman.\n\n\"Water!\" repeated my uncle. \"Hvar?\" he asked, in Icelandic.\n\n\"_Nedat,_\" replied Hans.\n\n\"Where? Down below!\" I understood it all. I seized the hunter's\nhands, and pressed them while he looked on me without moving a muscle\nof his countenance.\n\nThe preparations for our departure were not long in making, and we\nwere soon on our way down a passage inclining two feet in seven. In\nan hour we had gone a mile and a quarter, and descended two thousand\nfeet.\n\nThen I began to hear distinctly quite a new sound of something\nrunning within the thickness of the granite wall, a kind of dull,\ndead rumbling, like distant thunder. During the first part of our\nwalk, not meeting with the promised spring, I felt my agony\nreturning; but then my uncle acquainted me with the cause of the\nstrange noise.\n\n\"Hans was not mistaken,\" he said. \"What you hear is the rushing of a\ntorrent.\"\n\n\"A torrent?\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"There can be no doubt; a subterranean river is flowing around us.\"\n\nWe hurried forward in the greatest excitement. I was no longer\nsensible of my fatigue. This murmuring of waters close at hand was\nalready refreshing me. It was audibly increasing. The torrent, after\nhaving for some time flowed over our heads, was now running within\nthe left wall, roaring and rushing. Frequently I touched the wall,\nhoping to feel some indications of moisture: But there was no hope\nhere.\n\nYet another half hour, another half league was passed.\n\nThen it became clear that the hunter had gone no farther. Guided by\nan instinct peculiar to mountaineers he had as it were felt this\ntorrent through the rock; but he had certainly seen none of the\nprecious liquid; he had drunk nothing himself.\n\nSoon it became evident that if we continued our walk we should widen\nthe distance between ourselves and the stream, the noise of which was\nbecoming fainter.\n\nWe returned. Hans stopped where the torrent seemed closest. I sat\nnear the wall, while the waters were flowing past me at a distance of\ntwo feet with extreme violence. But there was a thick granite wall\nbetween us and the object of our desires.\n\nWithout reflection, without asking if there were any means of\nprocuring the water, I gave way to a movement of despair.\n\nHans glanced at me with, I thought, a smile of compassion.\n\nHe rose and took the lamp. I followed him. He moved towards the wall.\nI looked on. He applied his ear against the dry stone, and moved it\nslowly to and fro, listening intently. I perceived at once that he\nwas examining to find the exact place where the torrent could be\nheard the loudest. He met with that point on the left side of the\ntunnel, at three feet from the ground.\n\nI was stirred up with excitement. I hardly dared guess what the\nhunter was about to do. But I could not but understand, and applaud\nand cheer him on, when I saw him lay hold of the pickaxe to make an\nattack upon the rock.\n\n\"We are saved!\" I cried.\n\n\"Yes,\" cried my uncle, almost frantic with excitement. \"Hans is\nright. Capital fellow! Who but he would have thought of it?\"\n\nYes; who but he? Such an expedient, however simple, would never have\nentered into our minds. True, it seemed most hazardous to strike a\nblow of the hammer in this part of the earth's structure. Suppose\nsome displacement should occur and crush us all! Suppose the torrent,\nbursting through, should drown us in a sudden flood! There was\nnothing vain in these fancies. But still no fears of falling rocks or\nrushing floods could stay us now; and our thirst was so intense that,\nto satisfy it, we would have dared the waves of the north Atlantic.\n\nHans set about the task which my uncle and I together could not have\naccomplished. If our impatience had armed our hands with power, we\nshould have shattered the rock into a thousand fragments. Not so\nHans. Full of self possession, he calmly wore his way through the\nrock with a steady succession of light and skilful strokes, working\nthrough an aperture six inches wide at the outside. I could hear a\nlouder noise of flowing waters, and I fancied I could feel the\ndelicious fluid refreshing my parched lips.\n\nThe pick had soon penetrated two feet into the granite partition, and\nour man had worked for above an hour. I was in an agony of\nimpatience. My uncle wanted to employ stronger measures, and I had\nsome difficulty in dissuading him; still he had just taken a pickaxe\nin his hand, when a sudden hissing was heard, and a jet of water\nspurted out with violence against the opposite wall.\n\nHans, almost thrown off his feet by the violence of the shock,\nuttered a cry of grief and disappointment, of which I soon under-.\nstood the cause, when plunging my hands into the spouting torrent, I\nwithdrew them in haste, for the water was scalding hot.\n\n\"The water is at the boiling point,\" I cried.\n\n\"Well, never mind, let it cool,\" my uncle replied.\n\nThe tunnel was filling with steam, whilst a stream was forming, which\nby degrees wandered away into subterranean windings, and soon we had\nthe satisfaction of swallowing our first draught.\n\nCould anything be more delicious than the sensation that our burning\nintolerable thirst was passing away, and leaving us to enjoy comfort\nand pleasure? But where was this water from? No matter. It was water;\nand though still warm, it brought life back to the dying. I kept\ndrinking without stopping, and almost without tasting.\n\nAt last after a most delightful time of reviving energy, I cried,\n\"Why, this is a chalybeate spring!\"\n\n\"Nothing could be better for the digestion,\" said my uncle. \"It is\nhighly impregnated with iron. It will be as good for us as going to\nthe Spa, or to T\u00f6plitz.\"\n\n\"Well, it is delicious!\"\n\n\"Of course it is, water should be, found six miles underground. It\nhas an inky flavour, which is not at all unpleasant. What a capital\nsource of strength Hans has found for us here. We will call it after\nhis name.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" I cried.\n\nAnd Hansbach it was from that moment.\n\nHans was none the prouder. After a moderate draught, he went quietly\ninto a corner to rest.\n\n\"Now,\" I said, \"we must not lose this water.\"\n\n\"What is the use of troubling ourselves?\" my uncle, replied. \"I fancy\nit will never fail.\"\n\n\"Never mind, we cannot be sure; let us fill the water bottle and our\nflasks, and then stop up the opening.\"\n\nMy advice was followed so far as getting in a supply; but the\nstopping up of the hole was not so easy to accomplish. It was in vain\nthat we took up fragments of granite, and stuffed them in with tow,\nwe only scalded our hands without succeeding. The pressure was too\ngreat, and our efforts were fruitless.\n\n\"It is quite plain,\" said I, \"that the higher body of this water is\nat a considerable elevation. The force of the jet shows that.\"\n\n\"No doubt,\" answered my uncle. \"If this column of water is 32,000\nfeet high--that is, from the surface of the earth, it is equal to\nthe weight of a thousand atmospheres. But I have got an idea.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Why should we trouble ourselves to stop the stream from coming out\nat all?\"\n\n\"Because--\" Well, I could not assign a reason.\n\n\"When our flasks are empty, where shall we fill them again? Can we\ntell that?\"\n\nNo; there was no certainty.\n\n\"Well, let us allow the water to run on. It will flow down, and will\nboth guide and refresh us.\"\n\n\"That is well planned,\" I cried. \"With this stream for our guide,\nthere is no reason why we should not succeed in our undertaking.\"\n\n\"Ah, my boy! you agree with me now,\" cried the Professor, laughing.\n\n\"I agree with you most heartily.\"\n\n\"Well, let us rest awhile; and then we will start again.\"\n\nI was forgetting that it was night. The chronometer soon informed me\nof that fact; and in a very short time, refreshed and thankful, we\nall three fell into a sound sleep.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\nWELL SAID, OLD MOLE! CANST THOU WORK I' THE GROUND SO FAST?\n\n\nBy the next day we had forgotten all our sufferings. At first, I was\nwondering that I was no longer thirsty, and I was for asking for the\nreason. The answer came in the murmuring of the stream at my feet.\n\nWe breakfasted, and drank of this excellent chalybeate water. I felt\nwonderfully stronger, and quite decided upon pushing on. Why should\nnot so firmly convinced a man as my uncle, furnished with so\nindustrious a guide as Hans, and accompanied by so determined a\nnephew as myself, go on to final success? Such were the magnificent\nplans which struggled for mastery within me. If it had been proposed\nto me to return to the summit of Sn\u00e6fell, I should have indignantly\ndeclined.\n\nMost fortunately, all we had to do was to descend.\n\n\"Let us start!\" I cried, awakening by my shouts the echoes of the\nvaulted hollows of the earth.\n\nOn Thursday, at 8 a.m., we started afresh. The granite tunnel winding\nfrom side to side, earned us past unexpected turns, and seemed almost\nto form a labyrinth; but, on the whole, its direction seemed to be\nsouth-easterly. My uncle never ceased to consult his compass, to keep\naccount of the ground gone over.\n\nThe gallery dipped down a very little way from the horizontal,\nscarcely more than two inches in a fathom, and the stream ran gently\nmurmuring at our feet. I compared it to a friendly genius guiding us\nunderground, and caressed with my hand the soft naiad, whose\ncomforting voice accompanied our steps. With my reviving spirits\nthese mythological notions seemed to come unbidden.\n\nAs for my uncle, he was beginning to storm against the horizontal\nroad. He loved nothing better than a vertical path; but this way\nseemed indefinitely prolonged, and instead of sliding along the\nhypothenuse as we were now doing, he would willingly have dropped\ndown the terrestrial radius. But there was no help for it, and as\nlong as we were approaching the centre at all we felt that we must\nnot complain.\n\nFrom time to time, a steeper path appeared; our naiad then began to\ntumble before us with a hoarser murmur, and we went down with her to\na greater depth.\n\nOn the whole, that day and the next we made considerable way\nhorizontally, very little vertically.\n\nOn Friday evening, the 10th of July, according to our calculations,\nwe were thirty leagues south-east of Rejkiavik, and at a depth of two\nleagues and a half.\n\nAt our feet there now opened a frightful abyss. My uncle, however,\nwas not to be daunted, and he clapped his hands at the steepness of\nthe descent.\n\n\"This will take us a long way,\" he cried, \"and without much\ndifficulty; for the projections in the rock form quite a staircase.\"\n\nThe ropes were so fastened by Hans as to guard against accident, and\nthe descent commenced. I can hardly call it perilous, for I was\nbeginning to be familiar with this kind of exercise.\n\nThis well, or abyss, was a narrow cleft in the mass of the granite,\ncalled by geologists a 'fault,' and caused by the unequal cooling of\nthe globe of the earth. If it had at one time been a passage for\neruptive matter thrown out by Sn\u00e6fell, I still could not understand\nwhy no trace was left of its passage. We kept going down a kind of\nwinding staircase, which seemed almost to have been made by the hand\nof man.\n\nEvery quarter of an hour we were obliged to halt, to take a little\nnecessary repose and restore the action of our limbs. We then sat\ndown upon a fragment of rock, and we talked as we ate and drank from\nthe stream.\n\nOf course, down this fault the Hansbach fell in a cascade, and lost\nsome of its volume; but there was enough and to spare to slake our\nthirst. Besides, when the incline became more gentle, it would of\ncourse resume its peaceable course. At this moment it reminded me of\nmy worthy uncle, in his frequent fits of impatience and anger, while\nbelow it ran with the calmness of the Icelandic hunter.\n\nOn the 6th and 7th of July we kept following the spiral curves of\nthis singular well, penetrating in actual distance no more than two\nleagues; but being carried to a depth of five leagues below the level\nof the sea. But on the 8th, about noon, the fault took, towards the\nsouth-east, a much gentler slope, one of about forty-five degrees.\n\nThen the road became monotonously easy. It could not be otherwise,\nfor there was no landscape to vary the stages of our journey.\n\nOn Wednesday, the 15th, we were seven leagues underground, and had\ntravelled fifty leagues away from Sn\u00e6fell. Although we were tired,\nour health was perfect, and the medicine chest had not yet had\noccasion to be opened.\n\nMy uncle noted every hour the indications of the compass, the\nchronometer, the aneroid, and the thermometer the very same which he\nhas published in his scientific report of our journey. It was\ntherefore not difficult to know exactly our whereabouts. When he told\nme that we had gone fifty leagues horizontally, I could not repress\nan exclamation of astonishment, at the thought that we had now long\nleft Iceland behind us.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" he cried.\n\n\"I was reflecting that if your calculations are correct we are no\nlonger under Iceland.\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\"\n\n\"I am not mistaken,\" I said, and examining the map, I added, \"We have\npassed Cape Portland, and those fifty leagues bring us under the wide\nexpanse of ocean.\"\n\n\"Under the sea,\" my uncle repeated, rubbing his hands with delight.\n\n\"Can it be?\" I said. \"Is the ocean spread above our heads?\"\n\n\"Of course, Axel. What can be more natural? At Newcastle are there\nnot coal mines extending far under the sea?\"\n\nIt was all very well for the Professor to call this so simple, but I\ncould not feel quite easy at the thought that the boundless ocean was\nrolling over my head. And yet it really mattered very little whether\nit was the plains and mountains that covered our heads, or the\nAtlantic waves, as long as we were arched over by solid granite. And,\nbesides, I was getting used to this idea; for the tunnel, now running\nstraight, now winding as capriciously in its inclines as in its\nturnings, but constantly preserving its south-easterly direction, and\nalways running deeper, was gradually carrying us to very great depths\nindeed.\n\nFour days later, Saturday, the 18th of July, in the evening, we\narrived at a kind of vast grotto; and here my uncle paid Hans his\nweekly wages, and it was settled that the next day, Sunday, should be\na day of rest.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\nDE PROFUNDIS\n\n\nI therefore awoke next day relieved from the preoccupation of an\nimmediate start. Although we were in the very deepest of known\ndepths, there was something not unpleasant about it. And, besides, we\nwere beginning to get accustomed to this troglodyte [1] life. I no\nlonger thought of sun, moon, and stars, trees, houses, and towns, nor\nof any of those terrestrial superfluities which are necessaries of\nmen who live upon the earth's surface. Being fossils, we looked upon\nall those things as mere jokes.\n\nThe grotto was an immense apartment. Along its granite floor ran our\nfaithful stream. At this distance from its spring the water was\nscarcely tepid, and we drank of it with pleasure.\n\nAfter breakfast the Professor gave a few hours to the arrangement of\nhis daily notes.\n\n\"First,\" said he, \"I will make a calculation to ascertain our exact\nposition. I hope, after our return, to draw a map of our journey,\nwhich will be in reality a vertical section of the globe, containing\nthe track of our expedition.\"\n\n\"That will be curious, uncle; but are your observations sufficiently\naccurate to enable you to do this correctly?\"\n\n\"Yes; I have everywhere observed the angles and the inclines. I am\nsure there is no error. Let us see where we are now. Take your\ncompass, and note the direction.\"\n\nI looked, and replied carefully:\n\n[1] tpwgln, a hole; dnw, to creep into. The name of an Ethiopian\ntribe who lived in caves and holes. ??????, a hole, and ???, to creep\ninto.\n\n\"South-east by east.\"\n\n\"Well,\" answered the Professor, after a rapid calculation, \"I infer\nthat we have gone eighty-five leagues since we started.\"\n\n\"Therefore we are under mid-Atlantic?\"\n\n\"To be sure we are.\"\n\n\"And perhaps at this very moment there is a storm above, and ships\nover our heads are being rudely tossed by the tempest.\"\n\n\"Quite probable.\"\n\n\"And whales are lashing the roof of our prison with their tails?\"\n\n\"It may be, Axel, but they won't shake us here. But let us go back to\nour calculation. Here we are eighty-five leagues south-east of\nSn\u00e6fell, and I reckon that we are at a depth of sixteen leagues.\"\n\n\"Sixteen leagues?\" I cried.\n\n\"No doubt.\"\n\n\"Why, this is the very limit assigned by science to the thickness of\nthe crust of the earth.\"\n\n\"I don't deny it.\"\n\n\"And here, according to the law of increasing temperature, there\nought to be a heat of 2,732\u00b0 Fahr.!\"\n\n\"So there should, my lad.\"\n\n\"And all this solid granite ought to be running in fusion.\"\n\n\"You see that it is not so, and that, as so often happens, facts come\nto overthrow theories.\"\n\n\"I am obliged to agree; but, after all, it is surprising.\"\n\n\"What does the thermometer say?\"\n\n\"Twenty-seven, six tenths (82\u00b0 Fahr.).\"\n\n\"Therefore the savants are wrong by 2,705\u00b0, and the proportional\nincrease is a mistake. Therefore Humphry Davy was right, and I am not\nwrong in following him. What do you say now?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\nIn truth, I had a good deal to say. I gave way in no respect to\nDavy's theory. I still held to the central heat, although I did not\nfeel its effects. I preferred to admit in truth, that this chimney of\nan extinct volcano, lined with lavas, which are non-conductors of\nheat, did not suffer the heat to pass through its walls.\n\nBut without stopping to look up new arguments I simply took up our\nsituation such as it was.\n\n\"Well, admitting all your calculations to be quite correct, you must\nallow me to draw one rigid result therefrom.\"\n\n\"What is it. Speak freely.\"\n\n\"At the latitude of Iceland, where we now are, the radius of the\nearth, the distance from the centre to the surface is about 1,583\nleagues; let us say in round numbers 1,600 leagues, or 4,800 miles.\nOut of 1,600 leagues we have gone twelve!\"\n\n\"So you say.\"\n\n\"And these twelve at a cost of 85 leagues diagonally?\"\n\n\"Exactly so.\"\n\n\"In twenty days?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Now, sixteen leagues are the hundredth part of the earth's radius.\nAt this rate we shall be two thousand days, or nearly five years and\na half, in getting to the centre.\"\n\nNo answer was vouchsafed to this rational conclusion. \"Without\nreckoning, too, that if a vertical depth of sixteen leagues can be\nattained only by a diagonal descent of eighty-four, it follows that\nwe must go eight thousand miles in a south-easterly direction; so\nthat we shall emerge from some point in the earth's circumference\ninstead of getting to the centre!\"\n\n\"Confusion to all your figures, and all your hypotheses besides,\"\nshouted my uncle in a sudden rage. \"What is the basis of them all?\nHow do you know that this passage does not run straight to our\ndestination? Besides, there is a precedent. What one man has done,\nanother may do.\"\n\n\"I hope so; but, still, I may be permitted--\"\n\n\"You shall have my leave to hold your tongue, Axel, but not to talk\nin that irrational way.\"\n\nI could see the awful Professor bursting through my uncle's skin, and\nI took timely warning.\n\n\"Now look at your aneroid. What does that say?\"\n\n\"It says we are under considerable pressure.\"\n\n\"Very good; so you see that by going gradually down, and getting\naccustomed to the density of the atmosphere, we don't suffer at all.\"\n\n\"Nothing, except a little pain in the ears.\"\n\n\"That's nothing, and you may get rid of even that by quick breathing\nwhenever you feel the pain.\"\n\n\"Exactly so,\" I said, determined not to say a word that might cross\nmy uncle's prejudices. \"There is even positive pleasure in living in\nthis dense atmosphere. Have you observed how intense sound is down\nhere?\"\n\n\"No doubt it is. A deaf man would soon learn to hear perfectly.\"\n\n\"But won't this density augment?\"\n\n\"Yes; according to a rather obscure law. It is well known that the\nweight of bodies diminishes as fast as we descend. You know that it\nis at the surface of the globe that weight is most sensibly felt, and\nthat at the centre there is no weight at all.\"\n\n\"I am aware of that; but, tell me, will not air at last acquire the\ndensity of water?\"\n\n\"Of course, under a pressure of seven hundred and ten atmospheres.\"\n\n\"And how, lower down still?\"\n\n\"Lower down the density will still increase.\"\n\n\"But how shall we go down then.\"\n\n\"Why, we must fill our pockets with stones.\"\n\n\"Well, indeed, my worthy uncle, you are never at a loss for an\nanswer.\"\n\nI dared venture no farther into the region of probabilities, for I\nmight presently have stumbled upon an impossibility, which would have\nbrought the Professor on the scene when he was not wanted.\n\nStill, it was evident that the air, under a pressure which might\nreach that of thousands of atmospheres, would at last reach the solid\nstate, and then, even if our bodies could resist the strain, we\nshould be stopped, and no reasonings would be able to get us on any\nfarther.\n\nBut I did not advance this argument. My uncle would have met it with\nhis inevitable Saknussemm, a precedent which possessed no weight with\nme; for even if the journey of the learned Icelander were really\nattested, there was one very simple answer, that in the sixteenth\ncentury there was neither barometer or aneroid and therefore\nSaknussemm could not tell how far he had gone.\n\nBut I kept this objection to myself, and waited the course of events.\n\nThe rest of the day was passed in calculations and in conversations.\nI remained a steadfast adherent of the opinions of Professor\nLiedenbrock, and I envied the stolid indifference of Hans, who,\nwithout going into causes and effects, went on with his eyes shut\nwherever his destiny guided him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\n\nTHE WORST PERIL OF ALL\n\n\nIt must be confessed that hitherto things had not gone on so badly,\nand that I had small reason to complain. If our difficulties became\nno worse, we might hope to reach our end. And to what a height of\nscientific glory we should then attain! I had become quite a\nLiedenbrock in my reasonings; seriously I had. But would this state\nof things last in the strange place we had come to? Perhaps it might.\n\nFor several days steeper inclines, some even frightfully near to the\nperpendicular, brought us deeper and deeper into the mass of the\ninterior of the earth. Some days we advanced nearer to the centre by\na league and a half, or nearly two leagues. These were perilous\ndescents, in which the skill and marvellous coolness of Hans were\ninvaluable to us. That unimpassioned Icelander devoted himself with\nincomprehensible deliberation; and, thanks to him, we crossed many a\ndangerous spot which we should never have cleared alone.\n\nBut his habit of silence gained upon him day by day, and was\ninfecting us. External objects produce decided effects upon the\nbrain. A man shut up between four walls soon loses the power to\nassociate words and ideas together. How many prisoners in solitary\nconfinement become idiots, if not mad, for want of exercise for the\nthinking faculty!\n\nDuring the fortnight following our last conversation, no incident\noccurred worthy of being recorded. But I have good reason for\nremembering one very serious event which took place at this time, and\nof which I could scarcely now forget the smallest details.\n\nBy the 7th of August our successive descents had brought us to a\ndepth of thirty leagues; that is, that for a space of thirty leagues\nthere were over our heads solid beds of rock, ocean, continents, and\ntowns. We must have been two hundred leagues from Iceland.\n\nOn that day the tunnel went down a gentle slope. I was ahead of the\nothers. My uncle was carrying one of Ruhmkorff's lamps and I the\nother. I was examining the beds of granite.\n\nSuddenly turning round I observed that I was alone.\n\nWell, well, I thought; I have been going too fast, or Hans and my\nuncle have stopped on the way. Come, this won't do; I must join them.\nFortunately there is not much of an ascent.\n\nI retraced my steps. I walked for a quarter of an hour. I gazed into\nthe darkness. I shouted. No reply: my voice was lost in the midst of\nthe cavernous echoes which alone replied to my call.\n\nI began to feel uneasy. A shudder ran through me.\n\n\"Calmly!\" I said aloud to myself, \"I am sure to find my companions\nagain. There are not two roads. I was too far ahead. I will return!\"\n\nFor half an hour I climbed up. I listened for a call, and in that\ndense atmosphere a voice could reach very far. But there was a dreary\nsilence in all that long gallery. I stopped. I could not believe that\nI was lost. I was only bewildered for a time, not lost. I was sure I\nshould find my way again.\n\n\"Come,\" I repeated, \"since there is but one road, and they are on it,\nI must find them again. I have but to ascend still. Unless, indeed,\nmissing me, and supposing me to be behind, they too should have gone\nback. But even in this case I have only to make the greater haste. I\nshall find them, I am sure.\"\n\nI repeated these words in the fainter tones of a half-convinced man.\nBesides, to associate even such simple ideas with words, and reason\nwith them, was a work of time.\n\nA doubt then seized upon me. Was I indeed in advance when we became\nseparated? Yes, to be sure I was. Hans was after me, preceding my\nuncle. He had even stopped for a while to strap his baggage better\nover his shoulders. I could remember this little incident. It was at\nthat very moment that I must have gone on.\n\nBesides, I thought, have not I a guarantee that I shall not lose my\nway, a clue in the labyrinth, that cannot be broken, my faithful\nstream? I have but to trace it back, and I must come upon them.\n\nThis conclusion revived my spirits, and I resolved to resume my march\nwithout loss of time.\n\nHow I then blessed my uncle's foresight in preventing the hunter from\nstopping up the hole in the granite. This beneficent spring, after\nhaving satisfied our thirst on the road, would now be my guide among\nthe windings of the terrestrial crust.\n\nBefore starting afresh I thought a wash would do me good. I stooped\nto bathe my face in the Hansbach.\n\nTo my stupefaction and utter dismay my feet trod only--the rough dry\ngranite. The stream was no longer at my feet.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.\n\nLOST IN THE BOWELS OF THE EARTH\n\n\nTo describe my despair would be impossible. No words could tell it. I\nwas buried alive, with the prospect before me of dying of hunger and\nthirst.\n\nMechanically I swept the ground with my hands. How dry and hard the\nrock seemed to me!\n\nBut how had I left the course of the stream? For it was a terrible\nfact that it no longer ran at my side. Then I understood the reason\nof that fearful, silence, when for the last time I listened to hear\nif any sound from my companions could reach my ears. At the moment\nwhen I left the right road I had not noticed the absence of the\nstream. It is evident that at that moment a deviation had presented\nitself before me, whilst the Hansbach, following the caprice of\nanother incline, had gone with my companions away into unknown depths.\n\nHow was I to return? There was not a trace of their footsteps or of\nmy own, for the foot left no mark upon the granite floor. I racked my\nbrain for a solution of this impracticable problem. One word\ndescribed my position. Lost!\n\nLost at an immeasurable depth! Thirty leagues of rock seemed to weigh\nupon my shoulders with a dreadful pressure. I felt crushed.\n\nI tried to carry back my ideas to things on the surface of the earth.\nI could scarcely succeed. Hamburg, the house in the K\u00f6nigstrasse, my\npoor Gr\u00e4uben, all that busy world underneath which I was wandering\nabout, was passing in rapid confusion before my terrified memory. I\ncould revive with vivid reality all the incidents of our voyage,\nIceland, M. Fridrikssen, Sn\u00e6fell. I said to myself that if, in such a\nposition as I was now in, I was fool enough to cling to one glimpse\nof hope, it would be madness, and that the best thing I could do was\nto despair.\n\nWhat human power could restore me to the light of the sun by rending\nasunder the huge arches of rock which united over my head,\nbuttressing each other with impregnable strength? Who could place my\nfeet on the right path, and bring me back to my company?\n\n\"Oh, my uncle!\" burst from my lips in the tone of despair.\n\nIt was my only word of reproach, for I knew how much he must be\nsuffering in seeking me, wherever he might be.\n\nWhen I saw myself thus far removed from all earthly help I had\nrecourse to heavenly succour. The remembrance of my childhood, the\nrecollection of my mother, whom I had only known in my tender early\nyears, came back to me, and I knelt in prayer imploring for the\nDivine help of which I was so little worthy.\n\nThis return of trust in God's providence allayed the turbulence of my\nfears, and I was enabled to concentrate upon my situation all the\nforce of my intelligence.\n\nI had three days' provisions with me and my flask was full. But I\ncould not remain alone for long. Should I go up or down?\n\nUp, of course; up continually.\n\nI must thus arrive at the point where I had left the stream, that\nfatal turn in the road. With the stream at my feet, I might hope to\nregain the summit of Sn\u00e6fell.\n\nWhy had I not thought of that sooner? Here was evidently a chance of\nsafety. The most pressing duty was to find out again the course of\nthe Hansbach. I rose, and leaning upon my iron-pointed stick I\nascended the gallery. The slope was rather steep. I walked on without\nhope but without indecision, like a man who has made up his mind.\n\nFor half an hour I met with no obstacle. I tried to recognise my way\nby the form of the tunnel, by the projections of certain rocks, by\nthe disposition of the fractures. But no particular sign appeared,\nand I soon saw that this gallery could not bring me back to the\nturning point. It came to an abrupt end. I struck against an\nimpenetrable wall, and fell down upon the rock.\n\nUnspeakable despair then seized upon me. I lay overwhelmed, aghast!\nMy last hope was shattered against this granite wall.\n\nLost in this labyrinth, whose windings crossed each other in all\ndirections, it was no use to think of flight any longer. Here I must\ndie the most dreadful of deaths. And, strange to say, the thought\ncame across me that when some day my petrified remains should be\nfound thirty leagues below the surface in the bowels of the earth,\nthe discovery might lead to grave scientific discussions.\n\nI tried to speak aloud, but hoarse sounds alone passed my dry lips. I\npanted for breath.\n\nIn the midst of my agony a new terror laid hold of me. In falling my\nlamp had got wrong. I could not set it right, and its light was\npaling and would soon disappear altogether.\n\nI gazed painfully upon the luminous current growing weaker and weaker\nin the wire coil. A dim procession of moving shadows seemed slowly\nunfolding down the darkening walls. I scarcely dared to shut my eyes\nfor one moment, for fear of losing the least glimmer of this precious\nlight. Every instant it seemed about to vanish and the dense\nblackness to come rolling in palpably upon me.\n\nOne last trembling glimmer shot feebly up. I watched it in trembling\nand anxiety; I drank it in as if I could preserve it, concentrating\nupon it the full power of my eyes, as upon the very last sensation of\nlight which they were ever to experience, and the next moment I lay\nin the heavy gloom of deep, thick, unfathomable darkness.\n\nA terrible cry of anguish burst from me. Upon earth, in the midst of\nthe darkest night, light never abdicates its functions altogether. It\nis still subtle and diffusive, but whatever little there may be, the\neye still catches that little. Here there was not an atom; the total\ndarkness made me totally blind.\n\nThen I began to lose my head. I arose with my arms stretched out\nbefore me, attempting painfully to feel my way. I began to run\nwildly, hurrying through the inextricable maze, still descending,\nstill running through the substance of the earth's thick crust, a\nstruggling denizen of geological 'faults,' crying, shouting, yelling,\nsoon bruised by contact with the jagged rock, falling and rising\nagain bleeding, trying to drink the blood which covered my face, and\neven waiting for some rock to shatter my skull against.\n\nI shall never know whither my mad career took me. After the lapse of\nsome hours, no doubt exhausted, I fell like a lifeless lump at the\nfoot of the wall, and lost all consciousness.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\n\nTHE RESCUE IN THE WHISPERING GALLERY\n\n\nWhen I returned to partial life my face was wet with tears. How long\nthat state of insensibility had lasted I cannot say. I had no means\nnow of taking account of time. Never was solitude equal to this,\nnever had any living being been so utterly forsaken.\n\nAfter my fall I had lost a good deal of blood. I felt it flowing over\nme. Ah! how happy I should have been could I have died, and if death\nwere not yet to be gone through. I would think no longer. I drove\naway every idea, and, conquered by my grief, I rolled myself to the\nfoot of the opposite wall.\n\nAlready I was feeling the approach of another faint, and was hoping\nfor complete annihilation, when a loud noise reached me. It was like\nthe distant rumble of continuous thunder, and I could hear its\nsounding undulations rolling far away into the remote recesses of the\nabyss.\n\nWhence could this noise proceed? It must be from some phenomenon\nproceeding in the great depths amidst which I lay helpless. Was it an\nexplosion of gas? Was it the fall of some mighty pillar of the globe?\n\nI listened still. I wanted to know if the noise would be repeated. A\nquarter of an hour passed away. Silence reigned in this gallery. I\ncould not hear even the beating of my heart.\n\nSuddenly my ear, resting by chance against the wall, caught, or\nseemed to catch, certain vague, indescribable, distant, articulate\nsounds, as of words.\n\n\"This is a delusion,\" I thought.\n\nBut it was not. Listening more attentively, I heard in reality a\nmurmuring of voices. But my weakness prevented me from understanding\nwhat the voices said. Yet it was language, I was sure of it.\n\nFor a moment I feared the words might be my own, brought back by the\necho. Perhaps I had been crying out unknown to myself. I closed my\nlips firmly, and laid my ear against the wall again.\n\n\"Yes, truly, some one is speaking; those are words!\"\n\nEven a few feet from the wall I could hear distinctly. I succeeded in\ncatching uncertain, strange, undistinguishable words. They came as if\npronounced in low murmured whispers. The word '_forlorad_' was\nseveral times repeated in a tone of sympathy and sorrow.\n\n\"Help!\" I cried with all my might. \"Help!\"\n\nI listened, I watched in the darkness for an answer, a cry, a mere\nbreath of sound, but nothing came. Some minutes passed. A whole world\nof ideas had opened in my mind. I thought that my weakened voice\ncould never penetrate to my companions.\n\n\"It is they,\" I repeated. \"What other men can be thirty leagues under\nground?\"\n\nI again began to listen. Passing my ear over the wall from one place\nto another, I found the point where the voices seemed to be best\nheard. The word '_forlorad_' again returned; then the rolling of\nthunder which had roused me from my lethargy.\n\n\"No,\" I said, \"no; it is not through such a mass that a voice can be\nheard. I am surrounded by granite walls, and the loudest explosion\ncould never be heard here! This noise comes along the gallery. There\nmust be here some remarkable exercise of acoustic laws!\"\n\nI listened again, and this time, yes this time, I did distinctly hear\nmy name pronounced across the wide interval.\n\nIt was my uncle's own voice! He was talking to the guide. And\n'_forlorad_' is a Danish word.\n\nThen I understood it all. To make myself heard, I must speak along\nthis wall, which would conduct the sound of my voice just as wire\nconducts electricity.\n\nBut there was no time to lose. If my companions moved but a few steps\naway, the acoustic phenomenon would cease. I therefore approached the\nwall, and pronounced these words as clearly as possible:\n\n\"Uncle Liedenbrock!\"\n\nI waited with the deepest anxiety. Sound does not travel with great\nvelocity. Even increased density air has no effect upon its rate of\ntravelling; it merely augments its intensity. Seconds, which seemed\nages, passed away, and at last these words reached me:\n\n\"Axel! Axel! is it you?\"\n\n. . . .\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" I replied.\n\n. . . .\n\n\"My boy, where are you?\"\n\n. . . .\n\n\"Lost, in the deepest darkness.\"\n\n. . . .\n\n\"Where is your lamp?\"\n\n. . . .\n\n\"It is out.\"\n\n. . . .\n\n\"And the stream?\"\n\n. . . .\n\n\"Disappeared.\"\n\n. . . .\n\n\"Axel, Axel, take courage!\"\n\n. . . .\n\n\"Wait! I am exhausted! I can't answer. Speak to me!\"\n\n. . . .\n\n\"Courage,\" resumed my uncle. \"Don't speak. Listen to me. We have\nlooked for you up the gallery and down the gallery. Could not find\nyou. I wept for you, my poor boy. At last, supposing you were still\non the Hansbach, we fired our guns. Our voices are audible to each\nother, but our hands cannot touch. But don't despair, Axel! It is a\ngreat thing that we can hear each other.\"\n\n. . . .\n\nDuring this time I had been reflecting. A vague hope was returning to\nmy heart. There was one thing I must know to begin with. I placed my\nlips close to the wall, saying:\n\n\"My uncle!\"\n\n. . . .\n\n\"My boy!\" came to me after a few seconds.\n\n. . . .\n\n\"We must know how far we are apart.\"\n\n. . . .\n\n\"That is easy.\"\n\n. . . .\n\n\"You have your chronometer?\"\n\n. . .\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n. . . .\n\n\"Well, take it. Pronounce my name, noting exactly the second when you\nspeak. I will repeat it as soon as it shall come to me, and you will\nobserve the exact moment when you get my answer.\"\n\n\"Yes; and half the time between my call and your answer will exactly\nindicate that which my voice will take in coming to you.\"\n\n. . . .\n\n\"Just so, my uncle.\"\n\n. . . .\n\n\"Are you ready?\"\n\n. . . .\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n. . . . . .\n\n\"Now, attention. I am going to call your name.\"\n\n. . . .\n\nI put my ear to the wall, and as soon as the name 'Axel' came I\nimmediately replied \"Axel,\" then waited.\n\n. . . .\n\n\"Forty seconds,\" said my uncle. \"Forty seconds between the two words;\nso the sound takes twenty seconds in coming. Now, at the rate of\n1,120 feet in a second, this is 22,400 feet, or four miles and a\nquarter, nearly.\"\n\n. . . .\n\n\"Four miles and a quarter!\" I murmured.\n\n. . . .\n\n\"It will soon be over, Axel.\"\n\n. . . .\n\n\"Must I go up or down?\"\n\n. . . .\n\n\"Down--for this reason: We are in a vast chamber, with endless\ngalleries. Yours must lead into it, for it seems as if all the clefts\nand fractures of the globe radiated round this vast cavern. So get\nup, and begin walking. Walk on, drag yourself along, if necessary\nslide down the steep places, and at the end you will find us ready to\nreceive you. Now begin moving.\"\n\n. . . .\n\nThese words cheered me up.\n\n\"Good bye, uncle.\" I cried. \"I am going. There will be no more voices\nheard when once I have started. So good bye!\"\n\n. . . .\n\n\"Good bye, Axel, _au revoir!_\"\n\n. . . .\n\nThese were the last words I heard.\n\nThis wonderful underground conversation, carried on with a distance\nof four miles and a quarter between us, concluded with these words of\nhope. I thanked God from my heart, for it was He who had conducted me\nthrough those vast solitudes to the point where, alone of all others\nperhaps, the voices of my companions could have reached me.\n\nThis acoustic effect is easily explained on scientific grounds. It\narose from the concave form of the gallery and the conducting power\nof the rock. There are many examples of this propagation of sounds\nwhich remain unheard in the intermediate space. I remember that a\nsimilar phenomenon has been observed in many places; amongst others\non the internal surface of the gallery of the dome of St. Paul's in\nLondon, and especially in the midst of the curious caverns among the\nquarries near Syracuse, the most wonderful of which is called\nDionysius' Ear.\n\nThese remembrances came into my mind, and I clearly saw that since my\nuncle's voice really reached me, there could be no obstacle between\nus. Following the direction by which the sound came, of course I\nshould arrive in his presence, if my strength did not fail me.\n\nI therefore rose; I rather dragged myself than walked. The slope was\nrapid, and I slid down.\n\nSoon the swiftness of the descent increased horribly, and threatened\nto become a fall. I no longer had the strength to stop myself.\n\nSuddenly there was no ground under me. I felt myself revolving in\nair, striking and rebounding against the craggy projections of a\nvertical gallery, quite a well; my head struck against a sharp corner\nof the rock, and I became unconscious.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX.\n\nTHALATTA! THALATTA!\n\n\nWhen I came to myself, I was stretched in half darkness, covered with\nthick coats and blankets. My uncle was watching over me, to discover\nthe least sign of life. At my first sigh he took my hand; when I\nopened my eyes he uttered a cry of joy.\n\n\"He lives! he lives!\" he cried.\n\n\"Yes, I am still alive,\" I answered feebly.\n\n\"My dear nephew,\" said my uncle, pressing me to his breast, \"you are\nsaved.\"\n\nI was deeply touched with the tenderness of his manner as he uttered\nthese words, and still more with the care with which he watched over\nme. But such trials were wanted to bring out the Professor's tenderer\nqualities.\n\nAt this moment Hans came, he saw my hand in my uncle's, and I may\nsafely say that there was joy in his countenance.\n\n\"_God dag,_\" said he.\n\n\"How do you do, Hans? How are you? And now, uncle, tell me where we\nare at the present moment?\"\n\n\"To-morrow, Axel, to-morrow. Now you are too faint and weak. I have\nbandaged your head with compresses which must not be disturbed. Sleep\nnow, and to-morrow I will tell you all.\"\n\n\"But do tell me what time it is, and what day.\"\n\n\"It is Sunday, the 8th of August, and it is ten at night. You must\nask me no more questions until the 10th.\"\n\nIn truth I was very weak, and my eyes involuntarily closed. I wanted\na good night's rest; and I therefore went off to sleep, with the\nknowledge that I had been four long days alone in the heart of the\nearth.\n\nNext morning, on awakening, I looked round me. My couch, made up of\nall our travelling gear, was in a charming grotto, adorned with\nsplendid stalactites, and the soil of which was a fine sand. It was\nhalf light. There was no torch, no lamp, yet certain mysterious\nglimpses of light came from without through a narrow opening in the\ngrotto. I heard too a vague and indistinct noise, something like the\nmurmuring of waves breaking upon a shingly shore, and at times I\nseemed to hear the whistling of wind.\n\nI wondered whether I was awake, whether I was dreaming, whether my brain,\ncrazed by my fall, was not affected by imaginary noises. Yet neither\neyes, nor ears could be so utterly deceived.\n\nIt is a ray of daylight, I thought, sliding in through this cleft in\nthe rock! That is indeed the murmuring of waves! That is the rustling\nnoise of wind. Am I quite mistaken, or have we returned to the\nsurface of the earth? Has my uncle given up the expedition, or is it\nhappily terminated?\n\nI was asking myself these unanswerable questions when the Professor\nentered.\n\n\"Good morning, Axel,\" he cried cheerily. \"I feel sure you are better.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am indeed,\" said I, sitting up on my couch.\n\n\"You can hardly fail to be better, for you have slept quietly. Hans\nand I watched you by turns, and we have noticed you were evidently\nrecovering.\"\n\n\"Indeed, I do feel a great deal better, and I will give you a proof\nof that presently if you will let me have my breakfast.\"\n\n\"You shall eat, lad. The fever has left you. Hans rubbed your wounds\nwith some ointment or other of which the Icelanders keep the secret,\nand they have healed marvellously. Our hunter is a splendid fellow!\"\n\nWhilst he went on talking, my uncle prepared a few provisions, which\nI devoured eagerly, notwithstanding his advice to the contrary. All\nthe while I was overwhelming him with questions which he answered\nreadily.\n\nI then learnt that my providential fall had brought me exactly to the\nextremity of an almost perpendicular shaft; and as I had landed in\nthe midst of an accompanying torrent of stones, the least of which\nwould have been enough to crush me, the conclusion was that a loose\nportion of the rock had come down with me. This frightful conveyance\nhad thus carried me into the arms of my uncle, where I fell bruised,\nbleeding, and insensible.\n\n\"Truly it is wonderful that you have not been killed a hundred times\nover. But, for the love of God, don't let us ever separate again, or\nwe many never see each other more.\"\n\n\"Not separate! Is the journey not over, then?\" I opened a pair of\nastonished eyes, which immediately called for the question:\n\n\"What is the matter, Axel?\"\n\n\"I have a question to ask you. You say that I am safe and sound?\"\n\n\"No doubt you are.\"\n\n\"And all my limbs unbroken?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"And my head?\"\n\n\"Your head, except for a few bruises, is all right; and it is on your\nshoulders, where it ought to be.\"\n\n\"Well, I am afraid my brain is affected.\"\n\n\"Your mind affected!\"\n\n\"Yes, I fear so. Are we again on the surface of the globe?\"\n\n\"No, certainly not.\"\n\n\"Then I must be mad; for don't I see the light of day, and don't I\nhear the wind blowing, and the sea breaking on the shore?\"\n\n\"Ah! is that all?\"\n\n\"Do tell me all about it.\"\n\n\"I can't explain the inexplicable, but you will soon see and\nunderstand that geology has not yet learnt all it has to learn.\"\n\n\"Then let us go,\" I answered quickly.\n\n\"No, Axel; the open air might be bad for you.\"\n\n\"Open air?\"\n\n\"Yes; the wind is rather strong. You must not expose yourself.\"\n\n\"But I assure you I am perfectly well.\"\n\n\"A little patience, my nephew. A relapse might get us into trouble,\nand we have no time to lose, for the voyage may be a long one.\"\n\n\"The voyage!\"\n\n\"Yes, rest to-day, and to-morrow we will set sail.\"\n\n\"Set sail!\"--and I almost leaped up.\n\nWhat did it all mean? Had we a river, a lake, a sea to depend upon?\nWas there a ship at our disposal in some underground harbour?\n\nMy curiosity was highly excited, my uncle vainly tried to restrain\nme. When he saw that my impatience was doing me harm, he yielded.\n\nI dressed in haste. For greater safety I wrapped myself in a blanket,\nand came out of the grotto.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX.\n\nA NEW MARE INTERNUM\n\n\nAt first I could hardly see anything. My eyes, unaccustomed to the\nlight, quickly closed. When I was able to reopen them, I stood more\nstupefied even than surprised.\n\n\"The sea!\" I cried.\n\n\"Yes,\" my uncle replied, \"the Liedenbrock Sea; and I don't suppose\nany other discoverer will ever dispute my claim to name it after\nmyself as its first discoverer.\"\n\nA vast sheet of water, the commencement of a lake or an ocean, spread\nfar away beyond the range of the eye, reminding me forcibly of that\nopen sea which drew from Xenophon's ten thousand Greeks, after their\nlong retreat, the simultaneous cry, \"Thalatta! thalatta!\" the sea!\nthe sea! The deeply indented shore was lined with a breadth of fine\nshining sand, softly lapped by the waves, and strewn with the small\nshells which had been inhabited by the first of created beings. The\nwaves broke on this shore with the hollow echoing murmur peculiar to\nvast inclosed spaces. A light foam flew over the waves before the\nbreath of a moderate breeze, and some of the spray fell upon my face.\nOn this slightly inclining shore, about a hundred fathoms from the\nlimit of the waves, came down the foot of a huge wall of vast cliffs,\nwhich rose majestically to an enormous height. Some of these,\ndividing the beach with their sharp spurs, formed capes and\npromontories, worn away by the ceaseless action of the surf. Farther\non the eye discerned their massive outline sharply defined against\nthe hazy distant horizon.\n\nIt was quite an ocean, with the irregular shores of earth, but desert\nand frightfully wild in appearance.\n\nIf my eyes were able to range afar over this great sea, it was\nbecause a peculiar light brought to view every detail of it. It was\nnot the light of the sun, with his dazzling shafts of brightness and\nthe splendour of his rays; nor was it the pale and uncertain shimmer\nof the moonbeams, the dim reflection of a nobler body of light. No;\nthe illuminating power of this light, its trembling diffusiveness,\nits bright, clear whiteness, and its low temperature, showed that it\nmust be of electric origin. It was like an aurora borealis, a\ncontinuous cosmical phenomenon, filling a cavern of sufficient extent\nto contain an ocean.\n\nThe vault that spanned the space above, the sky, if it could be\ncalled so, seemed composed of vast plains of cloud, shifting and\nvariable vapours, which by their condensation must at certain times\nfall in torrents of rain. I should have thought that under so\npowerful a pressure of the atmosphere there could be no evaporation;\nand yet, under a law unknown to me, there were broad tracts of vapour\nsuspended in the air. But then 'the weather was fine.' The play of\nthe electric light produced singular effects upon the upper strata of\ncloud. Deep shadows reposed upon their lower wreaths; and often,\nbetween two separated fields of cloud, there glided down a ray of\nunspeakable lustre. But it was not solar light, and there was no\nheat. The general effect was sad, supremely melancholy. Instead of\nthe shining firmament, spangled with its innumerable stars, shining\nsingly or in clusters, I felt that all these subdued and shaded\nlights were ribbed in by vast walls of granite, which seemed to\noverpower me with their weight, and that all this space, great as it\nwas, would not be enough for the march of the humblest of satellites.\n\nThen I remembered the theory of an English captain, who likened the\nearth to a vast hollow sphere, in the interior of which the air\nbecame luminous because of the vast pressure that weighed upon it;\nwhile two stars, Pluto and Proserpine, rolled within upon the circuit\nof their mysterious orbits.\n\nWe were in reality shut up inside an immeasurable excavation. Its\nwidth could not be estimated, since the shore ran widening as far as\neye could reach, nor could its length, for the dim horizon bounded\nthe new. As for its height, it must have been several leagues. Where\nthis vault rested upon its granite base no eye could tell; but there\nwas a cloud hanging far above, the height of which we estimated at\n12,000 feet, a greater height than that of any terrestrial vapour,\nand no doubt due to the great density of the air.\n\nThe word cavern does not convey any idea of this immense space; words\nof human tongue are inadequate to describe the discoveries of him who\nventures into the deep abysses of earth.\n\nBesides I could not tell upon what geological theory to account for\nthe existence of such an excavation. Had the cooling of the globe\nproduced it? I knew of celebrated caverns from the descriptions of\ntravellers, but had never heard of any of such dimensions as this.\n\nIf the grotto of Guachara, in Colombia, visited by Humboldt, had not\ngiven up the whole of the secret of its depth to the philosopher, who\ninvestigated it to the depth of 2,500 feet, it probably did not\nextend much farther. The immense mammoth cave in Kentucky is of\ngigantic proportions, since its vaulted roof rises five hundred feet\n[1] above the level of an unfathomable lake and travellers have\nexplored its ramifications to the extent of forty miles. But what\nwere these cavities compared to that in which I stood with wonder and\nadmiration, with its sky of luminous vapours, its bursts of electric\nlight, and a vast sea filling its bed? My imagination fell powerless\nbefore such immensity.\n\nI gazed upon these wonders in silence. Words failed me to express my\nfeelings. I felt as if I was in some distant planet Uranus or\nNeptune--and in the presence of phenomena of which my terrestrial\nexperience gave me no cognisance. For such novel sensations, new words\nwere wanted; and my imagination failed to supply them. I gazed, I\nthought, I admired, with a stupefaction mingled with a certain amount of\nfear.\n\nThe unforeseen nature of this spectacle brought back the colour to my\ncheeks. I was under a new course of treatment with the aid of\nastonishment, and my convalescence was promoted by this novel system\nof therapeutics; besides, the dense and breezy air invigorated me,\nsupplying more oxygen to my lungs.\n\nIt will be easily conceived that after an imprisonment of forty seven\ndays in a narrow gallery it was the height of physical enjoyment to\nbreathe a moist air impregnated with saline particles.\n\n[1] One hundred and twenty. (Trans.)\n\nI was delighted to leave my dark grotto. My uncle, already familiar\nwith these wonders, had ceased to feel surprise.\n\n\"You feel strong enough to walk a little way now?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes, certainly; and nothing could be more delightful.\"\n\n\"Well, take my arm, Axel, and let us follow the windings of the\nshore.\"\n\nI eagerly accepted, and we began to coast along this new sea. On the\nleft huge pyramids of rock, piled one upon another, produced a\nprodigious titanic effect. Down their sides flowed numberless\nwaterfalls, which went on their way in brawling but pellucid streams.\nA few light vapours, leaping from rock to rock, denoted the place of\nhot springs; and streams flowed softly down to the common basin,\ngliding down the gentle slopes with a softer murmur.\n\nAmongst these streams I recognised our faithful travelling companion,\nthe Hansbach, coming to lose its little volume quietly in the mighty\nsea, just as if it had done nothing else since the beginning of the\nworld.\n\n\"We shall see it no more,\" I said, with a sigh.\n\n\"What matters,\" replied the philosopher, \"whether this or another\nserves to guide us?\"\n\nI thought him rather ungrateful.\n\nBut at that moment my attention was drawn to an unexpected sight. At\na distance of five hundred paces, at the turn of a high promontory,\nappeared a high, tufted, dense forest. It was composed of trees of\nmoderate height, formed like umbrellas, with exact geometrical\noutlines. The currents of wind seemed to have had no effect upon\ntheir shape, and in the midst of the windy blasts they stood unmoved\nand firm, just like a clump of petrified cedars.\n\nI hastened forward. I could not give any name to these singular\ncreations. Were they some of the two hundred thousand species of\nvegetables known hitherto, and did they claim a place of their own in\nthe lacustrine flora? No; when we arrived under their shade my\nsurprise turned into admiration. There stood before me productions of\nearth, but of gigantic stature, which my uncle immediately named.\n\n\"It is only a forest of mushrooms,\" said he.\n\nAnd he was right. Imagine the large development attained by these\nplants, which prefer a warm, moist climate. I knew that the\n_Lycopodon giganteum_ attains, according to Bulliard, a circumference\nof eight or nine feet; but here were pale mushrooms, thirty to forty\nfeet high, and crowned with a cap of equal diameter. There they stood\nin thousands. No light could penetrate between their huge cones, and\ncomplete darkness reigned beneath those giants; they formed\nsettlements of domes placed in close array like the round, thatched\nroofs of a central African city.\n\nYet I wanted to penetrate farther underneath, though a chill fell\nupon me as soon as I came under those cellular vaults. For half an\nhour we wandered from side to side in the damp shades, and it was a\ncomfortable and pleasant change to arrive once more upon the sea\nshore.\n\nBut the subterranean vegetation was not confined to these fungi.\nFarther on rose groups of tall trees of colourless foliage and easy\nto recognise. They were lowly shrubs of earth, here attaining\ngigantic size; lycopodiums, a hundred feet high; the huge sigillaria,\nfound in our coal mines; tree ferns, as tall as our fir-trees in\nnorthern latitudes; lepidodendra, with cylindrical forked stems,\nterminated by long leaves, and bristling with rough hairs like those\nof the cactus.\n\n\"Wonderful, magnificent, splendid!\" cried my uncle. \"Here is the\nentire flora of the second period of the world--the transition\nperiod. These, humble garden plants with us, were tall trees in the\nearly ages. Look, Axel, and admire it all. Never had botanist such a\nfeast as this!\"\n\n\"You are right, my uncle. Providence seems to have preserved in this\nimmense conservatory the antediluvian plants which the wisdom of\nphilosophers has so sagaciously put together again.\"\n\n\"It is a conservatory, Axel; but is it not also a menagerie?\"\n\n\"Surely not a menagerie!\"\n\n\"Yes; no doubt of it. Look at that dust under your feet; see the\nbones scattered on the ground.\"\n\n\"So there are!\" I cried; \"bones of extinct animals.\"\n\nI had rushed upon these remains, formed of indestructible phosphates\nof lime, and without hesitation I named these monstrous bones, which\nlay scattered about like decayed trunks of trees.\n\n\"Here is the lower jaw of a mastodon,\" [1] I said. \"These are the\nmolar teeth of the deinotherium; this femur must have belonged to the\ngreatest of those beasts, the megatherium. It certainly is a\nmenagerie, for these remains were not brought here by a deluge. The\nanimals to which they belonged roamed on the shores of this\nsubterranean sea, under the shade of those arborescent trees. Here\nare entire skeletons. And yet I cannot understand the appearance of\nthese quadrupeds in a granite cavern.\"\n\n[1] These animals belonged to a late geological period, the Pliocene,\njust before the glacial epoch, and therefore could have no connection\nwith the carboniferous vegetation. (Trans.)\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because animal life existed upon the earth only in the secondary\nperiod, when a sediment of soil had been deposited by the rivers, and\ntaken the place of the incandescent rocks of the primitive period.\"\n\n\"Well, Axel, there is a very simple answer to your objection that\nthis soil is alluvial.\"\n\n\"What! at such a depth below the surface of the earth?\"\n\n\"No doubt; and there is a geological explanation of the fact. At a\ncertain period the earth consisted only of an elastic crust or bark,\nalternately acted on by forces from above or below, according to the\nlaws of attraction and gravitation. Probably there were subsidences\nof the outer crust, when a portion of the sedimentary deposits was\ncarried down sudden openings.\"\n\n\"That may be,\" I replied; \"but if there have been creatures now\nextinct in these underground regions, why may not some of those\nmonsters be now roaming through these gloomy forests, or hidden\nbehind the steep crags?\"\n\nAnd as this unpleasant notion got hold of me, I surveyed with anxious\nscrutiny the open spaces before me; but no living creature appeared\nupon the barren strand.\n\nI felt rather tired, and went to sit down at the end of a promontory,\nat the foot of which the waves came and beat themselves into spray.\nThence my eye could sweep every part of the bay; within its extremity\na little harbour was formed between the pyramidal cliffs, where the\nstill waters slept untouched by the boisterous winds. A brig and two\nor three schooners might have moored within it in safety. I almost\nfancied I should presently see some ship issue from it, full sail,\nand take to the open sea under the southern breeze.\n\nBut this illusion lasted a very short time. We were the only living\ncreatures in this subterranean world. When the wind lulled, a deeper\nsilence than that of the deserts fell upon the arid, naked rocks, and\nweighed upon the surface of the ocean. I then desired to pierce the\ndistant haze, and to rend asunder the mysterious curtain that hung\nacross the horizon. Anxious queries arose to my lips. Where did that\nsea terminate? Where did it lead to? Should we ever know anything\nabout its opposite shores?\n\nMy uncle made no doubt about it at all; I both desired and feared.\n\nAfter spending an hour in the contemplation of this marvellous\nspectacle, we returned to the shore to regain the grotto, and I fell\nasleep in the midst of the strangest thoughts.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI.\n\nPREPARATIONS FOR A VOYAGE OF DISCOVERY\n\n\nThe next morning I awoke feeling perfectly well. I thought a bathe\nwould do me good, and I went to plunge for a few minutes into the\nwaters of this mediterranean sea, for assuredly it better deserved\nthis name than any other sea.\n\nI came back to breakfast with a good appetite. Hans was a good\ncaterer for our little household; he had water and fire at his\ndisposal, so that he was able to vary our bill of fare now and then.\nFor dessert he gave us a few cups of coffee, and never was coffee so\ndelicious.\n\n\"Now,\" said my uncle, \"now is the time for high tide, and we must not\nlose the opportunity to study this phenomenon.\"\n\n\"What! the tide!\" I cried. \"Can the influence of the sun and moon be\nfelt down here?\"\n\n\"Why not? Are not all bodies subject throughout their mass to the\npower of universal attraction? This mass of water cannot escape the\ngeneral law. And in spite of the heavy atmospheric pressure on the\nsurface, you will see it rise like the Atlantic itself.\"\n\nAt the same moment we reached the sand on the shore, and the waves\nwere by slow degrees encroaching on the shore.\n\n\"Here is the tide rising,\" I cried.\n\n\"Yes, Axel; and judging by these ridges of foam, you may observe that\nthe sea will rise about twelve feet.\"\n\n\"This is wonderful,\" I said.\n\n\"No; it is quite natural.\"\n\n\"You may say so, uncle; but to me it is most extraordinary, and I can\nhardly believe my eyes. Who would ever have imagined, under this\nterrestrial crust, an ocean with ebbing and flowing tides, with winds\nand storms?\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied my uncle, \"is there any scientific reason against it?\"\n\n\"No; I see none, as soon as the theory of central heat is given up.\"\n\"So then, thus far,\" he answered, \"the theory of Sir Humphry Davy is\nconfirmed.\"\n\n\"Evidently it is; and now there is no reason why there should not be\nseas and continents in the interior of the earth.\"\n\n\"No doubt,\" said my uncle; \"and inhabited too.\"\n\n\"To be sure,\" said I; \"and why should not these waters yield to us\nfishes of unknown species?\"\n\n\"At any rate,\" he replied, \"we have not seen any yet.\"\n\n\"Well, let us make some lines, and see if the bait will draw here as\nit does in sublunary regions.\"\n\n\"We will try, Axel, for we must penetrate all secrets of these newly\ndiscovered regions.\"\n\n\"But where are we, uncle? for I have not yet asked you that question,\nand your instruments must be able to furnish the answer.\"\n\n\"Horizontally, three hundred and fifty leagues from Iceland.\"\n\n\"So much as that?\"\n\n\"I am sure of not being a mile out of my reckoning.\"\n\n\"And does the compass still show south-east?\"\n\n\"Yes; with a westerly deviation of nineteen degrees forty-five\nminutes, just as above ground. As for its dip, a curious fact is\ncoming to light, which I have observed carefully: that the needle,\ninstead of dipping towards the pole as in the northern hemisphere, on\nthe contrary, rises from it.\"\n\n\"Would you then conclude,\" I said, \"that the magnetic pole is\nsomewhere between the surface of the globe and the point where we\nare?\"\n\n\"Exactly so; and it is likely enough that if we were to reach the\nspot beneath the polar regions, about that seventy-first degree where\nSir James Ross has discovered the magnetic pole to be situated, we\nshould see the needle point straight up. Therefore that mysterious\ncentre of attraction is at no great depth.\"\n\nI remarked: \"It is so; and here is a fact which science has scarcely\nsuspected.\"\n\n\"Science, my lad, has been built upon many errors; but they are\nerrors which it was good to fall into, for they led to the truth.\"\n\n\"What depth have we now reached?\"\n\n\"We are thirty-five leagues below the surface.\"\n\n\"So,\" I said, examining the map, \"the Highlands of Scotland are over\nour heads, and the Grampians are raising their rugged summits above\nus.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered the Professor laughing. \"It is rather a heavy weight\nto bear, but a solid arch spans over our heads. The great Architect\nhas built it of the best materials; and never could man have given it\nso wide a stretch. What are the finest arches of bridges and the\narcades of cathedrals, compared with this far reaching vault, with a\nradius of three leagues, beneath which a wide and tempest-tossed\nocean may flow at its ease?\"\n\n\"Oh, I am not afraid that it will fall down upon my head. But now\nwhat are your plans? Are you not thinking of returning to the surface\nnow?\"\n\n\"Return! no, indeed! We will continue our journey, everything having\ngone on well so far.\"\n\n\"But how are we to get down below this liquid surface?\"\n\n\"Oh, I am not going to dive head foremost. But if all oceans are\nproperly speaking but lakes, since they are encompassed by land, of\ncourse this internal sea will be surrounded by a coast of granite,\nand on the opposite shores we shall find fresh passages opening.\"\n\n\"How long do you suppose this sea to be?\"\n\n\"Thirty or forty leagues; so that we have no time to lose, and we\nshall set sail to-morrow.\"\n\nI looked about for a ship.\n\n\"Set sail, shall we? But I should like to see my boat first.\"\n\n\"It will not be a boat at all, but a good, well-made raft.\"\n\n\"Why,\" I said, \"a raft would be just as hard to make as a boat, and I\ndon't see--\"\n\n\"I know you don't see; but you might hear if you would listen. Don't\nyou hear the hammer at work? Hans is already busy at it.\"\n\n\"What, has he already felled the trees?\"\n\n\"Oh, the trees were already down. Come, and you will see for\nyourself.\"\n\nAfter half an hour's walking, on the other side of the promontory\nwhich formed the little natural harbour, I perceived Hans at work. In\na few more steps I was at his side. To my great surprise a\nhalf-finished raft was already lying on the sand, made of a peculiar\nkind of wood, and a great number of planks, straight and bent, and of\nframes, were covering the ground, enough almost for a little fleet.\n\n\"Uncle, what wood is this?\" I cried.\n\n\"It is fir, pine, or birch, and other northern coniferae, mineralised\nby the action of the sea. It is called surturbrand, a variety of\nbrown coal or lignite, found chiefly in Iceland.\"\n\n\"But surely, then, like other fossil wood, it must be as hard as\nstone, and cannot float?\"\n\n\"Sometimes that may happen; some of these woods become true\nanthracites; but others, such as this, have only gone through the\nfirst stage of fossil transformation. Just look,\" added my uncle,\nthrowing into the sea one of those precious waifs.\n\nThe bit of wood, after disappearing, returned to the surface and\noscillated to and fro with the waves.\n\n\"Are you convinced?\" said my uncle.\n\n\"I am quite convinced, although it is incredible!\"\n\nBy next evening, thanks to the industry and skill of our guide, the\nraft was made. It was ten feet by five; the planks of surturbrand,\nbraced strongly together with cords, presented an even surface, and\nwhen launched this improvised vessel floated easily upon the waves of\nthe Liedenbrock Sea.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII.\n\nWONDERS OF THE DEEP\n\n\nOn the 13th of August we awoke early. We were now to begin to adopt a\nmode of travelling both more expeditious and less fatiguing than\nhitherto.\n\nA mast was made of two poles spliced together, a yard was made of a\nthird, a blanket borrowed from our coverings made a tolerable sail.\nThere was no want of cordage for the rigging, and everything was well\nand firmly made.\n\nThe provisions, the baggage, the instruments, the guns, and a good\nquantity of fresh water from the rocks around, all found their proper\nplaces on board; and at six the Professor gave the signal to embark.\nHans had fitted up a rudder to steer his vessel. He took the tiller,\nand unmoored; the sail was set, and we were soon afloat. At the\nmoment of leaving the harbour, my uncle, who was tenaciously fond of\nnaming his new discoveries, wanted to give it a name, and proposed\nmine amongst others.\n\n\"But I have a better to propose,\" I said: \"Grauben. Let it be called\nPort Gr\u00e4uben; it will look very well upon the map.\"\n\n\"Port Gr\u00e4uben let it be then.\"\n\nAnd so the cherished remembrance of my Virlandaise became associated\nwith our adventurous expedition.\n\nThe wind was from the north-west. We went with it at a high rate of\nspeed. The dense atmosphere acted with great force and impelled us\nswiftly on.\n\nIn an hour my uncle had been able to estimate our progress. At this\nrate, he said, we shall make thirty leagues in twenty-four hours, and\nwe shall soon come in sight of the opposite shore.\n\nI made no answer, but went and sat forward. The northern shore was\nalready beginning to dip under the horizon. The eastern and western\nstrands spread wide as if to bid us farewell. Before our eyes lay far\nand wide a vast sea; shadows of great clouds swept heavily over its\nsilver-grey surface; the glistening bluish rays of electric light,\nhere and there reflected by the dancing drops of spray, shot out\nlittle sheaves of light from the track we left in our rear. Soon we\nentirely lost sight of land; no object was left for the eye to judge\nby, and but for the frothy track of the raft, I might have thought we\nwere standing still.\n\nAbout twelve, immense shoals of seaweeds came in sight. I was aware\nof the great powers of vegetation that characterise these plants,\nwhich grow at a depth of twelve thousand feet, reproduce themselves\nunder a pressure of four hundred atmospheres, and sometimes form\nbarriers strong enough to impede the course of a ship. But never, I\nthink, were such seaweeds as those which we saw floating in immense\nwaving lines upon the sea of Liedenbrock.\n\nOur raft skirted the whole length of the fuci, three or four thousand\nfeet long, undulating like vast serpents beyond the reach of sight; I\nfound some amusement in tracing these endless waves, always thinking\nI should come to the end of them, and for hours my patience was vying\nwith my surprise.\n\nWhat natural force could have produced such plants, and what must\nhave been the appearance of the earth in the first ages of its\nformation, when, under the action of heat and moisture, the vegetable\nkingdom alone was developing on its surface?\n\nEvening came, and, as on the previous day, I perceived no change in\nthe luminous condition of the air. It was a constant condition, the\npermanency of which might be relied upon.\n\nAfter supper I laid myself down at the foot of the mast, and fell\nasleep in the midst of fantastic reveries.\n\nHans, keeping fast by the helm, let the raft run on, which, after\nall, needed no steering, the wind blowing directly aft.\n\nSince our departure from Port Gr\u00e4uben, Professor Liedenbrock had\nentrusted the log to my care; I was to register every observation,\nmake entries of interesting phenomena, the direction of the wind, the\nrate of sailing, the way we made--in a word, every particular of our\nsingular voyage.\n\nI shall therefore reproduce here these daily notes, written, so to\nspeak, as the course of events directed, in order to furnish an exact\nnarrative of our passage.\n\n_Friday, August 14_.--Wind steady, N.W. The raft makes rapid way in\na direct line. Coast thirty leagues to leeward. Nothing in sight\nbefore us. Intensity of light the same. Weather fine; that is to say,\nthat the clouds are flying high, are light, and bathed in a white\natmosphere resembling silver in a state of fusion. Therm. 89\u00b0 Fahr.\n\nAt noon Hans prepared a hook at the end of a line. He baited it with\na small piece of meat and flung it into the sea. For two hours\nnothing was caught. Are these waters, then, bare of inhabitants? No,\nthere's a pull at the line. Hans draws it in and brings out a\nstruggling fish.\n\n\"A sturgeon,\" I cried; \"a small sturgeon.\"\n\nThe Professor eyes the creature attentively, and his opinion differs\nfrom mine.\n\nThe head of this fish was flat, but rounded in front, and the\nanterior part of its body was plated with bony, angular scales; it\nhad no teeth, its pectoral fins were large, and of tail there was\nnone. The animal belonged to the same order as the sturgeon, but\ndiffered from that fish in many essential particulars. After a short\nexamination my uncle pronounced his opinion.\n\n\"This fish belongs to an extinct family, of which only fossil traces\nare found in the devonian formations.\"\n\n\"What!\" I cried. \"Have we taken alive an inhabitant of the seas of\nprimitive ages?\"\n\n\"Yes; and you will observe that these fossil fishes have no identity\nwith any living species. To have in one's possession a living\nspecimen is a happy event for a naturalist.\"\n\n\"But to what family does it belong?\"\n\n\"It is of the order of ganoids, of the family of the cephalaspidae;\nand a species of pterichthys. But this one displays a peculiarity\nconfined to all fishes that inhabit subterranean waters. It is blind,\nand not only blind, but actually has no eyes at all.\"\n\nI looked: nothing could be more certain. But supposing it might be a\nsolitary case, we baited afresh, and threw out our line. Surely this\nocean is well peopled with fish, for in another couple of hours we\ntook a large quantity of pterichthydes, as well as of others\nbelonging to the extinct family of the dipterides, but of which my\nuncle could not tell the species; none had organs of sight. This\nunhoped-for catch recruited our stock of provisions.\n\nThus it is evident that this sea contains none but species known to\nus in their fossil state, in which fishes as well as reptiles are the\nless perfectly and completely organised the farther back their date\nof creation.\n\nPerhaps we may yet meet with some of those saurians which science has\nreconstructed out of a bit of bone or cartilage. I took up the\ntelescope and scanned the whole horizon, and found it everywhere a\ndesert sea. We are far away removed from the shores.\n\nI gaze upward in the air. Why should not some of the strange birds\nrestored by the immortal Cuvier again flap their 'sail-broad vans' in\nthis dense and heavy atmosphere? There are sufficient fish for their\nsupport. I survey the whole space that stretches overhead; it is as\ndesert as the shore was.\n\nStill my imagination carried me away amongst the wonderful\nspeculations of pal\u00e6ontology. Though awake I fell into a dream. I\nthought I could see floating on the surface of the waters enormous\nchelonia, pre-adamite tortoises, resembling floating islands. Over the\ndimly lighted strand there trod the huge mammals of the first ages of\nthe world, the leptotherium (slender beast), found in the caverns of\nBrazil; the merycotherium (ruminating beast), found in the 'drift' of\niceclad Siberia. Farther on, the pachydermatous lophiodon (crested\ntoothed), a gigantic tapir, hides behind the rocks to dispute its\nprey with the anoplotherium (unarmed beast), a strange creature,\nwhich seemed a compound of horse, rhinoceros, camel, and\nhippopotamus. The colossal mastodon (nipple-toothed) twists and\nuntwists his trunk, and brays and pounds with his huge tusks the\nfragments of rock that cover the shore; whilst the megatherium (huge\nbeast), buttressed upon his enormous hinder paws, grubs in the soil,\nawaking the sonorous echoes of the granite rocks with his tremendous\nroarings. Higher up, the protopitheca--the first monkey that\nappeared on the globe--is climbing up the steep ascents. Higher yet,\nthe pterodactyle (wing-fingered) darts in irregular zigzags to and\nfro in the heavy air. In the uppermost regions of the air immense\nbirds, more powerful than the cassowary, and larger than the ostrich,\nspread their vast breadth of wings and strike with their heads the\ngranite vault that bounds the sky.\n\nAll this fossil world rises to life again in my vivid imagination. I\nreturn to the scriptural periods or ages of the world, conventionally\ncalled 'days,' long before the appearance of man, when the unfinished\nworld was as yet unfitted for his support. Then my dream backed even\nfarther still into the ages before the creation of living beings. The\nmammals disappear, then the birds vanish, then the reptiles of the\nsecondary period, and finally the fish, the crustaceans, molluscs,\nand articulated beings. Then the zoophytes of the transition period\nalso return to nothing. I am the only living thing in the world: all\nlife is concentrated in my beating heart alone. There are no more\nseasons; climates are no more; the heat of the globe continually\nincreases and neutralises that of the sun. Vegetation becomes\naccelerated. I glide like a shade amongst arborescent ferns, treading\nwith unsteady feet the coloured marls and the particoloured clays; I\nlean for support against the trunks of immense conifers; I lie in the\nshade of sphenophylla (wedge-leaved), asterophylla (star-leaved), and\nlycopods, a hundred feet high.\n\nAges seem no more than days! I am passed, against my will, in\nretrograde order, through the long series of terrestrial changes.\nPlants disappear; granite rocks soften; intense heat converts solid\nbodies into thick fluids; the waters again cover the face of the\nearth; they boil, they rise in whirling eddies of steam; white and\nghastly mists wrap round the shifting forms of the earth, which by\nimperceptible degrees dissolves into a gaseous mass, glowing fiery\nred and white, as large and as shining as the sun.\n\nAnd I myself am floating with wild caprice in the midst of this\nnebulous mass of fourteen hundred thousand times the volume of the\nearth into which it will one day be condensed, and carried forward\namongst the planetary bodies. My body is no longer firm and\nterrestrial; it is resolved into its constituent atoms, subtilised,\nvolatilised. Sublimed into imponderable vapour, I mingle and am lost\nin the endless foods of those vast globular volumes of vaporous\nmists, which roll upon their flaming orbits through infinite space.\n\nBut is it not a dream? Whither is it carrying me? My feverish hand\nhas vainly attempted to describe upon paper its strange and wonderful\ndetails. I have forgotten everything that surrounds me. The\nProfessor, the guide, the raft--are all gone out of my ken. An\nillusion has laid hold upon me.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" my uncle breaks in.\n\nMy staring eyes are fixed vacantly upon him.\n\n\"Take care, Axel, or you will fall overboard.\"\n\nAt that moment I felt the sinewy hand of Hans seizing me vigorously.\nBut for him, carried away by my dream, I should have thrown myself\ninto the sea.\n\n\"Is he mad?\" cried the Professor.\n\n\"What is it all about?\" at last I cried, returning to myself.\n\n\"Do you feel ill?\" my uncle asked.\n\n\"No; but I have had a strange hallucination; it is over now. Is all\ngoing on right?\"\n\n\"Yes, it is a fair wind and a fine sea; we are sailing rapidly along,\nand if I am not out in my reckoning, we shall soon land.\"\n\nAt these words I rose and gazed round upon the horizon, still\neverywhere bounded by clouds alone.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\n\nA BATTLE OF MONSTERS\n\n\n_Saturday, August 15_.--The sea unbroken all round. No land in\nsight. The horizon seems extremely distant.\n\nMy head is still stupefied with the vivid reality of my dream.\n\nMy uncle has had no dreams, but he is out of temper. He examines the\nhorizon all round with his glass, and folds his arms with the air of\nan injured man.\n\nI remark that Professor Liedenbrock has a tendency to relapse into an\nimpatient mood, and I make a note of it in my log. All my danger and\nsufferings were needed to strike a spark of human feeling out of\nhim; but now that I am well his nature has resumed its sway. And yet,\nwhat cause was there for anger? Is not the voyage prospering as\nfavourably as possible under the circumstances? Is not the raft\nspinning along with marvellous speed?\n\n\"-You seem anxious, my uncle,\" I said, seeing him continually with\nhis glass to his eye.\n\n\"Anxious! No, not at all.\"\n\n\"Impatient, then?\"\n\n\"One might be, with less reason than now.\"\n\n\"Yet we are going very fast.\"\n\n\"What does that signify? I am not complaining that the rate is slow,\nbut that the sea is so wide.\"\n\nI then remembered that the Professor, before starting, had estimated\nthe length of this underground sea at thirty leagues. Now we had made\nthree times the distance, yet still the southern coast was not in\nsight.\n\n\"We are not descending as we ought to be,\" the Professor declares.\n\"We are losing time, and the fact is, I have not come all this way to\ntake a little sail upon a pond on a raft.\"\n\nHe called this sea a pond, and our long voyage, taking a little sail!\n\n\"But,\" I remarked, \"since we have followed the road that Saknussemm\nhas shown us--\"\n\n\"That is just the question. Have we followed that road? Did\nSaknussemm meet this sheet of water? Did he cross it? Has not the\nstream that we followed led us altogether astray?\"\n\n\"At any rate we cannot feel sorry to have come so far. This prospect\nis magnificent, and--\"\n\n\"But I don't care for prospects. I came with an object, and I mean to\nattain it. Therefore don't talk to me about views and prospects.\"\n\nI take this as my answer, and I leave the Professor to bite his lips\nwith impatience. At six in the evening Hans asks for his wages, and\nhis three rix dollars are counted out to him.\n\n_Sunday, August 16. _--Nothing new. Weather unchanged. The wind\nfreshens. On awaking, my first thought was to observe the intensity\nof the light. I was possessed with an apprehension lest the electric\nlight should grow dim, or fail altogether. But there seemed no reason\nto fear. The shadow of the raft was clearly outlined upon the surface\nof the waves.\n\nTruly this sea is of infinite width. It must be as wide as the\nMediterranean or the Atlantic--and why not?\n\nMy uncle took soundings several times. He tied the heaviest of our\npickaxes to a long rope which he let down two hundred fathoms. No\nbottom yet; and we had some difficulty in hauling up our plummet.\n\nBut when the pick was shipped again, Hans pointed out on its surface\ndeep prints as if it had been violently compressed between two hard\nbodies.\n\nI looked at the hunter.\n\n\"_T\u00e4nder,_\" said he.\n\nI could not understand him, and turned to my uncle who was entirely\nabsorbed in his calculations. I had rather not disturb him while he\nis quiet. I return to the Icelander. He by a snapping motion of his\njaws conveys his ideas to me.\n\n\"Teeth!\" I cried, considering the iron bar with more attention.\n\nYes, indeed, those are the marks of teeth imprinted upon the metal!\nThe jaws which they arm must be possessed of amazing strength. Is\nthere some monster beneath us belonging to the extinct races, more\nvoracious than the shark, more fearful in vastness than the whale? I\ncould not take my eyes off this indented iron bar. Surely will my\nlast night's dream be realised?\n\nThese thoughts agitated me all day, and my imagination scarcely\ncalmed down after several hours' sleep.\n\n_Monday, August 17.--_ I am trying to recall the peculiar instincts\nof the monsters of the pre-adamite world, who, coming next in\nsuccession after the molluscs, the crustaceans and le fishes,\npreceded the animals of mammalian race upon the earth. The world then\nbelonged to reptiles. Those monsters held the mastery in the seas of\nthe secondary period. They possessed a perfect organisation, gigantic\nproportions, prodigious strength. The saurians of our day, the\nalligators and the crocodiles, are but feeble reproductions of their\nforefathers of primitive ages.\n\nI shudder as I recall these monsters to my remembrance. No human eye\nhas ever beheld them living. They burdened this earth a thousand ages\nbefore man appeared, but their fossil remains, found in the\nargillaceous limestone called by the English the lias, have enabled\ntheir colossal structure to be perfectly built up again and\nanatomically ascertained.\n\nI saw at the Hamburg museum the skeleton of one of these creatures\nthirty feet in length. Am I then fated--I, a denizen of earth--to\nbe placed face to face with these representatives of long extinct\nfamilies? No; surely it cannot be! Yet the deep marks of conical\nteeth upon the iron pick are certainly those of the crocodile.\n\nMy eyes are fearfully bent upon the sea. I dread to see one of these\nmonsters darting forth from its submarine caverns. I suppose\nProfessor Liedenbrock was of my opinion too, and even shared my\nfears, for after having examined the pick, his eyes traversed the\nocean from side to side. What a very bad notion that was of his, I\nthought to myself, to take soundings just here! He has disturbed some\nmonstrous beast in its remote den, and if we are not attacked on our\nvoyage--\n\nI look at our guns and see that they are all right. My uncle notices\nit, and looks on approvingly.\n\nAlready widely disturbed regions on the surface of the water indicate\nsome commotion below. The danger is approaching. We must be on the\nlook out.\n\n_Tuesday, August 18. _--Evening came, or rather the time came when\nsleep weighs down the weary eyelids, for there is no night here, and\nthe ceaseless light wearies the eyes with its persistency just as if\nwe were sailing under an arctic sun. Hans was at the helm. During his\nwatch I slept.\n\nTwo hours afterwards a terrible shock awoke me. The raft was heaved\nup on a watery mountain and pitched down again, at a distance of\ntwenty fathoms.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" shouted my uncle. \"Have we struck land?\"\n\nHans pointed with his finger at a dark mass six hundred yards away,\nrising and falling alternately with heavy plunges. I looked and cried:\n\n\"It is an enormous porpoise.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied my uncle, \"and there is a sea lizard of vast size.\"\n\n\"And farther on a monstrous crocodile. Look at its vast jaws and its\nrows of teeth! It is diving down!\"\n\n\"There's a whale, a whale!\" cried the Professor. \"I can see its great\nfins. See how he is throwing out air and water through his blowers.\"\n\nAnd in fact two liquid columns were rising to a considerable height\nabove the sea. We stood amazed, thunderstruck, at the presence of\nsuch a herd of marine monsters. They were of supernatural dimensions;\nthe smallest of them would have crunched our raft, crew and all, at\none snap of its huge jaws.\n\nHans wants to tack to get away from this dangerous neighbourhood; but\nhe sees on the other hand enemies not less terrible; a tortoise forty\nfeet long, and a serpent of thirty, lifting its fearful head and\ngleaming eyes above the flood.\n\nFlight was out of the question now. The reptiles rose; they wheeled\naround our little raft with a rapidity greater than that of express\ntrains. They described around us gradually narrowing circles. I took\nup my rifle. But what could a ball do against the scaly armour with\nwhich these enormous beasts were clad?\n\nWe stood dumb with fear. They approach us close: on one side the\ncrocodile, on the other the serpent. The remainder of the sea\nmonsters have disappeared. I prepare to fire. Hans stops me by a\ngesture. The two monsters pass within a hundred and fifty yards of\nthe raft, and hurl themselves the one upon the other, with a fury\nwhich prevents them from seeing us.\n\nAt three hundred yards from us the battle was fought. We could\ndistinctly observe the two monsters engaged in deadly conflict. But\nit now seems to me as if the other animals were taking part in the\nfray--the porpoise, the whale, the lizard, the tortoise. Every\nmoment I seem to see one or other of them. I point them to the\nIcelander. He shakes his head negatively.\n\n\"_Tva,_\" says he.\n\n\"What two? Does he mean that there are only two animals?\"\n\n\"He is right,\" said my uncle, whose glass has never left his eye.\n\n\"Surely you must be mistaken,\" I cried.\n\n\"No: the first of those monsters has a porpoise's snout, a lizard's\nhead, a crocodile's teeth; and hence our mistake. It is the\nichthyosaurus (the fish lizard), the most terrible of the ancient\nmonsters of the deep.\"\n\n\"And the other?\"\n\n\"The other is a plesiosaurus (almost lizard), a serpent, armoured\nwith the carapace and the paddles of a turtle; he is the dreadful\nenemy of the other.\"\n\nHans had spoken truly. Two monsters only were creating all this\ncommotion; and before my eyes are two reptiles of the primitive\nworld. I can distinguish the eye of the ichthyosaurus glowing like a\nred-hot coal, and as large as a man's head. Nature has endowed it\nwith an optical apparatus of extreme power, and capable of resisting\nthe pressure of the great volume of water in the depths it inhabits.\nIt has been appropriately called the saurian whale, for it has both\nthe swiftness and the rapid movements of this monster of our own day.\nThis one is not less than a hundred feet long, and I can judge of its\nsize when it sweeps over the waters the vertical coils of its tail.\nIts jaw is enormous, and according to naturalists it is armed with no\nless than one hundred and eighty-two teeth.\n\nThe plesiosaurus, a serpent with a cylindrical body and a short tail,\nhas four flappers or paddles to act like oars. Its body is entirely\ncovered with a thick armour of scales, and its neck, as flexible as a\nswan's, rises thirty feet above the waves.\n\nThose huge creatures attacked each other with the greatest animosity.\nThey heaved around them liquid mountains, which rolled even to our\nraft and rocked it perilously. Twenty times we were near capsizing.\nHissings of prodigious force are heard. The two beasts are fast\nlocked together; I cannot distinguish the one from the other. The\nprobable rage of the conqueror inspires us with intense fear.\n\nOne hour, two hours, pass away. The struggle continues with unabated\nferocity. The combatants alternately approach and recede from our\nraft. We remain motionless, ready to fire. Suddenly the ichthyosaurus\nand the plesiosaurus disappear below, leaving a whirlpool eddying in\nthe water. Several minutes pass by while the fight goes on under\nwater.\n\nAll at once an enormous head is darted up, the head of the\nplesiosaurus. The monster is wounded to death. I no longer see his\nscaly armour. Only his long neck shoots up, drops again, coils and\nuncoils, droops, lashes the waters like a gigantic whip, and writhes\nlike a worm that you tread on. The water is splashed for a long way\naround. The spray almost blinds us. But soon the reptile's agony\ndraws to an end; its movements become fainter, its contortions cease\nto be so violent, and the long serpentine form lies a lifeless log on\nthe labouring deep.\n\nAs for the ichthyosaurus--has he returned to his submarine cavern?\nor will he reappear on the surface of the sea?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\n\nTHE GREAT GEYSER\n\n\n_Wednesday, August 19_.--Fortunately the wind blows violently, and\nhas enabled us to flee from the scene of the late terrible struggle.\nHans keeps at his post at the helm. My uncle, whom the absorbing\nincidents of the combat had drawn away from his contemplations, began\nagain to look impatiently around him.\n\nThe voyage resumes its uniform tenor, which I don't care to break\nwith a repetition of such events as yesterday's.\n\nThursday, Aug. 20.--Wind N.N.E., unsteady and fitful. Temperature\nhigh. Rate three and a half leagues an hour.\n\nAbout noon a distant noise is heard. I note the fact without being\nable to explain it. It is a continuous roar.\n\n\"In the distance,\" says the Professor, \"there is a rock or islet,\nagainst which the sea is breaking.\"\n\nHans climbs up the mast, but sees no breakers. The ocean' is smooth\nand unbroken to its farthest limit.\n\nThree hours pass away. The roarings seem to proceed from a very\ndistant waterfall.\n\nI remark upon this to my uncle, who replies doubtfully: \"Yes, I am\nconvinced that I am right.\" Are we, then, speeding forward to some\ncataract which will cast us down an abyss? This method of getting on\nmay please the Professor, because it is vertical; but for my part I\nprefer the more ordinary modes of horizontal progression.\n\nAt any rate, some leagues to the windward there must be some noisy\nphenomenon, for now the roarings are heard with increasing loudness.\nDo they proceed from the sky or the ocean?\n\nI look up to the atmospheric vapours, and try to fathom their depths.\nThe sky is calm and motionless. The clouds have reached the utmost\nlimit of the lofty vault, and there lie still bathed in the bright\nglare of the electric light. It is not there that we must seek for\nthe cause of this phenomenon. Then I examine the horizon, which is\nunbroken and clear of all mist. There is no change in its aspect. But\nif this noise arises from a fall, a cataract, if all this ocean flows\naway headlong into a lower basin yet, if that deafening roar is\nproduced by a mass of falling water, the current must needs\naccelerate, and its increasing speed will give me the measure of the\nperil that threatens us. I consult the current: there is none. I\nthrow an empty bottle into the sea: it lies still.\n\nAbout four Hans rises, lays hold of the mast, climbs to its top.\nThence his eye sweeps a large area of sea, and it is fixed upon a\npoint. His countenance exhibits no surprise, but his eye is immovably\nsteady.\n\n\"He sees something,\" says my uncle.\n\n\"I believe he does.\"\n\nHans comes down, then stretches his arm to the south, saying:\n\n\"_Dere nere!_\"\n\n\"Down there?\" repeated my uncle.\n\nThen, seizing his glass, he gazes attentively for a minute, which\nseems to me an age.\n\n\"Yes, yes!\" he cried. \"I see a vast inverted cone rising from the\nsurface.\"\n\n\"Is it another sea beast?\"\n\n\"Perhaps it is.\"\n\n\"Then let us steer farther westward, for we know something of the\ndanger of coming across monsters of that sort.\"\n\n\"Let us go straight on,\" replied my uncle.\n\nI appealed to Hans. He maintained his course inflexibly.\n\nYet, if at our present distance from the animal, a distance of twelve\nleagues at the least, the column of water driven through its blowers\nmay be distinctly seen, it must needs be of vast size. The commonest\nprudence would counsel immediate flight; but we did not come so far\nto be prudent.\n\nImprudently, therefore, we pursue our way. The nearer we approach,\nthe higher mounts the jet of water. What monster can possibly fill\nitself with such a quantity of water, and spurt it up so continuously?\n\nAt eight in the evening we are not two leagues distant from it. Its\nbody--dusky, enormous, hillocky--lies spread upon the sea like an\nislet. Is it illusion or fear? Its length seems to me a couple of\nthousand yards. What can be this cetacean, which neither Cuvier nor\nBlumenbach knew anything about? It lies motionless, as if asleep; the\nsea seems unable to move it in the least; it is the waves that\nundulate upon its sides. The column of water thrown up to a height of\nfive hundred feet falls in rain with a deafening uproar. And here are\nwe scudding like lunatics before the wind, to get near to a monster\nthat a hundred whales a day would not satisfy!\n\nTerror seizes upon me. I refuse to go further. I will cut the\nhalliards if necessary! I am in open mutiny against the Professor,\nwho vouchsafes no answer.\n\nSuddenly Hans rises, and pointing with his finger at the menacing\nobject, he says:\n\n\"_Holm._\"\n\n\"An island!\" cries my uncle.\n\n\"That's not an island!\" I cried sceptically.\n\n\"It's nothing else,\" shouted the Professor, with a loud laugh.\n\n\"But that column of water?\"\n\n\"_Geyser,_\" said Hans.\n\n\"No doubt it is a geyser, like those in Iceland.\"\n\nAt first I protest against being so widely mistaken as to have taken\nan island for a marine monster. But the evidence is against me, and I\nhave to confess my error. It is nothing worse than a natural\nphenomenon.\n\nAs we approach nearer the dimensions of the liquid column become\nmagnificent. The islet resembles, with a most deceiving likeness, an\nenormous cetacean, whose head dominates the waves at a height of\ntwenty yards. The geyser, a word meaning 'fury,' rises majestically\nfrom its extremity. Deep and heavy explosions are heard from time to\ntime, when the enormous jet, possessed with more furious violence,\nshakes its plumy crest, and springs with a bound till it reaches the\nlowest stratum of the clouds. It stands alone. No steam vents, no hot\nsprings surround it, and all the volcanic power of the region is\nconcentrated here. Sparks of electric fire mingle with the dazzling\nsheaf of lighted fluid, every drop of which refracts the prismatic\ncolours.\n\n\"Let us land,\" said the Professor.\n\n\"But we must carefully avoid this waterspout, which would sink our\nraft in a moment.\"\n\nHans, steering with his usual skill, brought us to the other\nextremity of the islet.\n\nI leaped up on the rock; my uncle lightly followed, while our hunter\nremained at his post, like a man too wise ever to be astonished.\n\nWe walked upon granite mingled with siliceous tufa. The soil shivers\nand shakes under our feet, like the sides of an overheated boiler\nfilled with steam struggling to get loose. We come in sight of a\nsmall central basin, out of which the geyser springs. I plunge a\nregister thermometer into the boiling water. It marks an intense heat\nof 325\u00b0, which is far above the boiling point; therefore this water\nissues from an ardent furnace, which is not at all in harmony with\nProfessor Liedenbrock's theories. I cannot help making the remark.\n\n\"Well,\" he replied, \"how does that make against my doctrine?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing at all,\" I said, seeing that I was going in opposition\nto immovable obstinacy.\n\nStill I am constrained to confess that hitherto we have been\nwonderfully favoured, and that for some reason unknown to myself we\nhave accomplished our journey under singularly favourable conditions\nof temperature. But it seems manifest to me that some day we shall\nreach a region where the central heat attains its highest limits, and\ngoes beyond a point that can be registered by our thermometers.\n\n\"That is what we shall see.\" So says the Professor, who, having named\nthis volcanic islet after his nephew, gives the signal to embark\nagain.\n\nFor some minutes I am still contemplating the geyser. I notice that\nit throws up its column of water with variable force: sometimes\nsending it to a great height, then again to a lower, which I\nattribute to the variable pressure of the steam accumulated in its\nreservoir.\n\nAt last we leave the island, rounding away past the low rocks on its\nsouthern shore. Hans has taken advantage of the halt to refit his\nrudder.\n\nBut before going any farther I make a few observations, to calculate\nthe distance we have gone over, and note them in my journal. We have\ncrossed two hundred and seventy leagues of sea since leaving Port\nGr\u00e4uben; and we are six hundred and twenty leagues from Iceland,\nunder England. [1]\n\n[1] This distance carries the travellers as far as under the Pyrenees\nif the league measures three miles. (Trans.)\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV.\n\nAN ELECTRIC STORM\n\n\n_Friday, August 21_.--On the morrow the magnificent geyser has\ndisappeared. The wind has risen, and has rapidly carried us away from\nAxel Island. The roarings become lost in the distance.\n\nThe weather--if we may use that term--will change before long. The\natmosphere is charged with vapours, pervaded with the electricity\ngenerated by the evaporation of saline waters. The clouds are sinking\nlower, and assume an olive hue. The electric light can scarcely\npenetrate through the dense curtain which has dropped over the\ntheatre on which the battle of the elements is about to be waged.\n\nI feel peculiar sensations, like many creatures on earth at the\napproach of violent atmospheric changes. The heavily voluted cumulus\nclouds lower gloomily and threateningly; they wear that implacable\nlook which I have sometimes noticed at the outbreak of a great storm.\nThe air is heavy; the sea is calm.\n\nIn the distance the clouds resemble great bales of cotton, piled up\nin picturesque disorder. By degrees they dilate, and gain in huge\nsize what they lose in number. Such is their ponderous weight that\nthey cannot rise from the horizon; but, obeying an impulse from\nhigher currents, their dense consistency slowly yields. The gloom\nupon them deepens; and they soon present to our view a ponderous mass\nof almost level surface. From time to time a fleecy tuft of mist,\nwith yet some gleaming light left upon it, drops down upon the dense\nfloor of grey, and loses itself in the opaque and impenetrable mass.\n\nThe atmosphere is evidently charged and surcharged with electricity.\nMy whole body is saturated; my hair bristles just as when you stand\nupon an insulated stool under the action of an electrical machine. It\nseems to me as if my companions, the moment they touched me, would\nreceive a severe shock like that from an electric eel.\n\nAt ten in the morning the symptoms of storm become aggravated. The\nwind never lulls but to acquire increased strength; the vast bank of\nheavy clouds is a huge reservoir of fearful windy gusts and rushing\nstorms.\n\nI am loth to believe these atmospheric menaces, and yet I cannot help\nmuttering:\n\n\"Here's some very bad weather coming on.\"\n\nThe Professor made no answer. His temper is awful, to judge from the\nworking of his features, as he sees this vast length of ocean\nunrolling before him to an indefinite extent. He can only spare time\nto shrug his shoulders viciously.\n\n\"There's a heavy storm coming on,\" I cried, pointing towards the\nhorizon. \"Those clouds seem as if they were going to crush the sea.\"\n\nA deep silence falls on all around. The lately roaring winds are\nhushed into a dead calm; nature seems to breathe no more, and to be\nsinking into the stillness of death. On the mast already I see the\nlight play of a lambent St. Elmo's fire; the outstretched sail\ncatches not a breath of wind, and hangs like a sheet of lead. The\nrudder stands motionless in a sluggish, waveless sea. But if we have\nnow ceased to advance why do we yet leave that sail loose, which at\nthe first shock of the tempest may capsize us in a moment?\n\n\"Let us reef the sail and cut the mast down!\" I cried. \"That will be\nsafest.\"\n\n\"No, no! Never!\" shouted my impetuous uncle. \"Never! Let the wind\ncatch us if it will! What I want is to get the least glimpse of rock\nor shore, even if our raft should be smashed into shivers!\"\n\nThe words were hardly out of his mouth when a sudden change took\nplace in the southern sky. The piled-up vapours condense into water;\nand the air, put into violent action to supply the vacuum left by the\ncondensation of the mists, rouses itself into a whirlwind. It rushes\non from the farthest recesses of the vast cavern. The darkness\ndeepens; scarcely can I jot down a few hurried notes. The helm makes\na bound. My uncle falls full length; I creep close to him. He has\nlaid a firm hold upon a rope, and appears to watch with grim\nsatisfaction this awful display of elemental strife.\n\nHans stirs not. His long hair blown by the pelting storm, and laid\nflat across his immovable countenance, makes him a strange figure;\nfor the end of each lock of loose flowing hair is tipped with little\nluminous radiations. This frightful mask of electric sparks suggests\nto me, even in this dizzy excitement, a comparison with pre-adamite\nman, the contemporary of the ichthyosaurus and the megatherium. [1]\n\n[1] Rather of the mammoth and the mastodon. (Trans.)\n\nThe mast yet holds firm. The sail stretches tight like a bubble ready\nto burst. The raft flies at a rate that I cannot reckon, but not so\nfast as the foaming clouds of spray which it dashes from side to side\nin its headlong speed.\n\n\"The sail! the sail!\" I cry, motioning to lower it.\n\n\"No!\" replies my uncle.\n\n\"_Nej!_\" repeats Hans, leisurely shaking his head.\n\nBut now the rain forms a rushing cataract in front of that horizon\ntoward which we are running with such maddening speed. But before it\nhas reached us the rain cloud parts asunder, the sea boils, and the\nelectric fires are brought into violent action by a mighty chemical\npower that descends from the higher regions. The most vivid flashes\nof lightning are mingled with the violent crash of continuous\nthunder. Ceaseless fiery arrows dart in and out amongst the flying\nthunder-clouds; the vaporous mass soon glows with incandescent heat;\nhailstones rattle fiercely down, and as they dash upon our iron tools\nthey too emit gleams and flashes of lurid light. The heaving waves\nresemble fiery volcanic hills, each belching forth its own interior\nflames, and every crest is plumed with dancing fire. My eyes fail\nunder the dazzling light, my ears are stunned with the incessant\ncrash of thunder. I must be bound to the mast, which bows like a reed\nbefore the mighty strength of the storm.\n\n(Here my notes become vague and indistinct. I have only been able to\nfind a few which I seem to have jotted down almost unconsciously. But\ntheir very brevity and their obscurity reveal the intensity of the\nexcitement which dominated me, and describe the actual position even\nbetter than my memory could do.)\n\nSunday, 23.--Where are we? Driven forward with a swiftness that\ncannot be measured.\n\nThe night was fearful; no abatement of the storm. The din and uproar\nare incessant; our ears are bleeding; to exchange a word is\nimpossible.\n\nThe lightning flashes with intense brilliancy, and never seems to\ncease for a moment. Zigzag streams of bluish white fire dash down\nupon the sea and rebound, and then take an upward flight till they\nstrike the granite vault that overarches our heads. Suppose that\nsolid roof should crumble down upon our heads! Other flashes with\nincessant play cross their vivid fires, while others again roll\nthemselves into balls of living fire which explode like bombshells,\nbut the music of which scarcely-adds to the din of the battle strife\nthat almost deprives us of our senses of hearing and sight; the limit\nof intense loudness has been passed within which the human ear can\ndistinguish one sound from another. If all the powder magazines in\nthe world were to explode at once, we should hear no more than we do\nnow.\n\nFrom the under surface of the clouds there are continual emissions of\nlurid light; electric matter is in continual evolution from their\ncomponent molecules; the gaseous elements of the air need to be\nslaked with moisture; for innumerable columns of water rush upwards\ninto the air and fall back again in white foam.\n\nWhither are we flying? My uncle lies full length across the raft.\n\nThe heat increases. I refer to the thermometer; it indicates . . .\n(the figure is obliterated).\n\n_Monday, August 24._--Will there be an end to it? Is the atmospheric\ncondition, having once reached this density, to become final?\n\nWe are prostrated and worn out with fatigue. But Hans is as usual.\nThe raft bears on still to the south-east. We have made two hundred\nleagues since we left Axel Island.\n\nAt noon the violence of the storm redoubles. We are obliged to secure\nas fast as possible every article that belongs to our cargo. Each of\nus is lashed to some part of the raft. The waves rise above our heads.\n\nFor three days we have never been able to make each other hear a\nword. Our mouths open, our lips move, but not a word can be heard. We\ncannot even make ourselves heard by approaching our mouth close to\nthe ear.\n\nMy uncle has drawn nearer to me. He has uttered a few words. They\nseem to be 'We are lost'; but I am not sure.\n\nAt last I write down the words: \"Let us lower the sail.\"\n\nHe nods his consent.\n\nScarcely has he lifted his head again before a ball of fire has\nbounded over the waves and lighted on board our raft. Mast and sail\nflew up in an instant together, and I saw them carried up to\nprodigious height, resembling in appearance a pterodactyle, one of\nthose strong birds of the infant world.\n\nWe lay there, our blood running cold with unspeakable terror. The\nfireball, half of it white, half azure blue, and the size of a\nten-inch shell, moved slowly about the raft, but revolving on its own\naxis with astonishing velocity, as if whipped round by the force of\nthe whirlwind. Here it comes, there it glides, now it is up the\nragged stump of the mast, thence it lightly leaps on the provision\nbag, descends with a light bound, and just skims the powder magazine.\nHorrible! we shall be blown up; but no, the dazzling disk of\nmysterious light nimbly leaps aside; it approaches Hans, who fixes\nhis blue eye upon it steadily; it threatens the head of my uncle, who\nfalls upon his knees with his head down to avoid it. And now my turn\ncomes; pale and trembling under the blinding splendour and the\nmelting heat, it drops at my feet, spinning silently round upon the\ndeck; I try to move my foot away, but cannot.\n\nA suffocating smell of nitrogen fills the air, it enters the throat,\nit fills the lungs. We suffer stifling pains.\n\nWhy am I unable to move my foot? Is it riveted to the planks? Alas!\nthe fall upon our fated raft of this electric globe has magnetised\nevery iron article on board. The instruments, the tools, our guns,\nare clashing and clanking violently in their collisions with each\nother; the nails of my boots cling tenaciously to a plate of iron let\ninto the timbers, and I cannot draw my foot away from the spot. At\nlast by a violent effort I release myself at the instant when the\nball in its gyrations was about to seize upon it, and carry me off my\nfeet ....\n\nAh! what a flood of intense and dazzling light! the globe has burst,\nand we are deluged with tongues of fire!\n\nThen all the light disappears. I could just see my uncle at full\nlength on the raft, and Hans still at his helm and spitting fire\nunder the action of the electricity which has saturated him.\n\nBut where are we going to? Where?\n\n* * * *\n\n_Tuesday, August 25._--I recover from a long swoon. The storm\ncontinues to roar and rage; the lightnings dash hither and thither,\nlike broods of fiery serpents filling all the air. Are we still under\nthe sea? Yes, we are borne at incalculable speed. We have been\ncarried under England, under the channel, under France, perhaps under\nthe whole of Europe.\n\n* * * *\n\nA fresh noise is heard! Surely it is the sea breaking upon the rocks!\nBut then . . . .\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\n\nCALM PHILOSOPHIC DISCUSSIONS\n\n\nHere I end what I may call my log, happily saved from the wreck, and\nI resume my narrative as before.\n\nWhat happened when the raft was dashed upon the rocks is more than I\ncan tell. I felt myself hurled into the waves; and if I escaped from\ndeath, and if my body was not torn over the sharp edges of the rocks,\nit was because the powerful arm of Hans came to my rescue.\n\nThe brave Icelander carried me out of the reach of the waves, over a\nburning sand where I found myself by the side of my uncle.\n\nThen he returned to the rocks, against which the furious waves were\nbeating, to save what he could. I was unable to speak. I was\nshattered with fatigue and excitement; I wanted a whole hour to\nrecover even a little.\n\nBut a deluge of rain was still falling, though with that violence\nwhich generally denotes the near cessation of a storm. A few\noverhanging rocks afforded us some shelter from the storm. Hans\nprepared some food, which I could not touch; and each of us,\nexhausted with three sleepless nights, fell into a broken and painful\nsleep.\n\nThe next day the weather was splendid. The sky and the sea had sunk\ninto sudden repose. Every trace of the awful storm had disappeared.\nThe exhilarating voice of the Professor fell upon my ears as I awoke;\nhe was ominously cheerful.\n\n\"Well, my boy,\" he cried, \"have you slept well?\"\n\nWould not any one have thought that we were still in our cheerful\nlittle house on the K\u00f6nigstrasse and that I was only just coming down\nto breakfast, and that I was to be married to Gr\u00e4uben that day?\n\nAlas! if the tempest had but sent the raft a little more east, we\nshould have passed under Germany, under my beloved town of Hamburg,\nunder the very street where dwelt all that I loved most in the world.\nThen only forty leagues would have separated us! But they were forty\nleagues perpendicular of solid granite wall, and in reality we were a\nthousand leagues asunder!\n\nAll these painful reflections rapidly crossed my mind before I could\nanswer my uncle's question.\n\n\"Well, now,\" he repeated, \"won't you tell me how you have slept?\"\n\n\"Oh, very well,\" I said. \"I am only a little knocked up, but I shall\nsoon be better.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" says my uncle, \"that's nothing to signify. You are only a\nlittle bit tired.\"\n\n\"But you, uncle, you seem in very good spirits this morning.\"\n\n\"Delighted, my boy, delighted. We have got there.\"\n\n\"To our journey's end?\"\n\n\"No; but we have got to the end of that endless sea. Now we shall go\nby land, and really begin to go down! down! down!\"\n\n\"But, my dear uncle, do let me ask you one question.\"\n\n\"Of course, Axel.\"\n\n\"How about returning?\"\n\n\"Returning? Why, you are talking about the return before the arrival.\"\n\n\"No, I only want to know how that is to be managed.\"\n\n\"In the simplest way possible. When we have reached the centre of the\nglobe, either we shall find some new way to get back, or we shall\ncome back like decent folks the way we came. I feel pleased at the\nthought that it is sure not to be shut against us.\"\n\n\"But then we shall have to refit the raft.\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"Then, as to provisions, have we enough to last?\"\n\n\"Yes; to be sure we have. Hans is a clever fellow, and I am sure he\nmust have saved a large part of our cargo. But still let us go and\nmake sure.\"\n\nWe left this grotto which lay open to every wind. At the same time I\ncherished a trembling hope which was a fear as well. It seemed to me\nimpossible that the terrible wreck of the raft should not have\ndestroyed everything on board. On my arrival on the shore I found\nHans surrounded by an assemblage of articles all arranged in good\norder. My uncle shook hands with him with a lively gratitude. This\nman, with almost superhuman devotion, had been at work all the while\nthat we were asleep, and had saved the most precious of the articles\nat the risk of his life.\n\nNot that we had suffered no losses. For instance, our firearms; but\nwe might do without them. Our stock of powder had remained uninjured\nafter having risked blowing up during the storm.\n\n\"Well,\" cried the Professor, \"as we have no guns we cannot hunt,\nthat's all.\"\n\n\"Yes, but how about the instruments?\"\n\n\"Here is the aneroid, the most useful of all, and for which I would\nhave given all the others. By means of it I can calculate the depth\nand know when we have reached the centre; without it we might very\nlikely go beyond, and come out at the antipodes!\"\n\nSuch high spirits as these were rather too strong.\n\n\"But where is the compass? I asked.\n\n\"Here it is, upon this rock, in perfect condition, as well as the\nthermometers and the chronometer. The hunter is a splendid fellow.\"\n\nThere was no denying it. We had all our instruments. As for tools and\nappliances, there they all lay on the ground--ladders, ropes, picks,\nspades, etc.\n\nStill there was the question of provisions to be settled, and I\nasked--\"How are we off for provisions?\"\n\nThe boxes containing these were in a line upon the shore, in a\nperfect state of preservation; for the most part the sea had spared\nthem, and what with biscuits, salt meat, spirits, and salt fish, we\nmight reckon on four months' supply.\n\n\"Four months!\" cried the Professor. \"We have time to go and to\nreturn; and with what is left I will give a grand dinner to my\nfriends at the Johann\u00e6um.\"\n\nI ought by this time to have been quite accustomed to my uncle's\nways; yet there was always something fresh about him to astonish me.\n\n\"Now,\" said he, \"we will replenish our supply of water with the rain\nwhich the storm has left in all these granite basins; therefore we\nshall have no reason to fear anything from thirst. As for the raft, I\nwill recommend Hans to do his best to repair it, although I don't\nexpect it will be of any further use to us.\"\n\n\"How so?\" I cried.\n\n\"An idea of my own, my lad. I don't think we shall come out by the\nway that we went in.\"\n\nI stared at the Professor with a good deal of mistrust. I asked, was\nhe not touched in the brain? And yet there was method in his madness.\n\n\"And now let us go to breakfast,\" said he.\n\nI followed him to a headland, after he had given his instructions to\nthe hunter. There preserved meat, biscuit, and tea made us an\nexcellent meal, one of the best I ever remember. Hunger, the fresh\nair, the calm quiet weather, after the commotions we had gone\nthrough, all contributed to give me a good appetite.\n\nWhilst breakfasting I took the opportunity to put to my uncle the\nquestion where we were now.\n\n\"That seems to me,\" I said, \"rather difficult to make out.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is difficult,\" he said, \"to calculate exactly; perhaps even\nimpossible, since during these three stormy days I have been unable\nto keep any account of the rate or direction of the raft; but still\nwe may get an approximation.\"\n\n\"The last observation,\" I remarked, \"was made on the island, when the\ngeyser was--\"\n\n\"You mean Axel Island. Don't decline the honour of having given your\nname to the first island ever discovered in the central parts of the\nglobe.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said I, \"let it be Axel Island. Then we had cleared two\nhundred and seventy leagues of sea, and we were six hundred leagues\nfrom Iceland.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" answered my uncle; \"let us start from that point and\ncount four days' storm, during which our rate cannot have been less\nthan eighty leagues in the twenty-four hours.\"\n\n\"That is right; and this would make three hundred leagues more.\"\n\n\"Yes, and the Liedenbrock sea would be six hundred leagues from shore\nto shore. Surely, Axel, it may vie in size with the Mediterranean\nitself.\"\n\n\"Especially,\" I replied, \"if it happens that we have only crossed it\nin its narrowest part. And it is a curious circumstance,\" I added,\n\"that if my computations are right, and we are nine hundred leagues\nfrom Rejkiavik, we have now the Mediterranean above our head.\"\n\n\"That is a good long way, my friend. But whether we are under Turkey\nor the Atlantic depends very much upon the question in what direction\nwe have been moving. Perhaps we have deviated.\"\n\n\"No, I think not. Our course has been the same all along, and I\nbelieve this shore is south-east of Port Gr\u00e4uben.\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied my uncle, \"we may easily ascertain this by consulting\nthe compass. Let us go and see what it says.\"\n\nThe Professor moved towards the rock upon which Hans had laid down\nthe instruments. He was gay and full of spirits; he rubbed his hands,\nhe studied his attitudes. I followed him, curious to know if I was\nright in my estimate. As soon as we had arrived at the rock my uncle\ntook the compass, laid it horizontally, and questioned the needle,\nwhich, after a few oscillations, presently assumed a fixed position.\nMy uncle looked, and looked, and looked again. He rubbed his eyes,\nand then turned to me thunderstruck with some unexpected discovery.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" I asked.\n\nHe motioned to me to look. An exclamation of astonishment burst from\nme. The north pole of the needle was turned to what we supposed to be\nthe south. It pointed to the shore instead of to the open sea! I\nshook the box, examined it again, it was in perfect condition. In\nwhatever position I placed the box the needle pertinaciously returned\nto this unexpected quarter. Therefore there seemed no reason to doubt\nthat during the storm there had been a sudden change of wind\nunperceived by us, which had brought our raft back to the shore which\nwe thought we had left so long a distance behind us.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\n\nTHE LIEDENBROCK MUSEUM OF GEOLOGY\n\n\nHow shall I describe the strange series of passions which in\nsuccession shook the breast of Professor Liedenbrock? First\nstupefaction, then incredulity, lastly a downright burst of rage.\nNever had I seen the man so put out of countenance and so disturbed.\nThe fatigues of our passage across, the dangers met, had all to be\nbegun over again. We had gone backwards instead of forwards!\n\nBut my uncle rapidly recovered himself.\n\n\"Aha! will fate play tricks upon me? Will the elements lay plots\nagainst me? Shall fire, air, and water make a combined attack against\nme? Well, they shall know what a determined man can do. I will not\nyield. I will not stir a single foot backwards, and it will be seen\nwhether man or nature is to have the upper hand!\"\n\nErect upon the rock, angry and threatening, Otto Liedenbrock was a\nrather grotesque fierce parody upon the fierce Achilles defying the\nlightning. But I thought it my duty to interpose and attempt to lay\nsome restraint upon this unmeasured fanaticism.\n\n\"Just listen to me,\" I said firmly. \"Ambition must have a limit\nsomewhere; we cannot perform impossibilities; we are not at all fit\nfor another sea voyage; who would dream of undertaking a voyage of\nfive hundred leagues upon a heap of rotten planks, with a blanket in\nrags for a sail, a stick for a mast, and fierce winds in our teeth?\nWe cannot steer; we shall be buffeted by the tempests, and we should\nbe fools and madmen to attempt to cross a second time.\"\n\nI was able to develop this series of unanswerable reasons for ten\nminutes without interruption; not that the Professor was paying any\nrespectful attention to his nephew's arguments, but because he was\ndeaf to all my eloquence.\n\n\"To the raft!\" he shouted.\n\nSuch was his only reply. It was no use for me to entreat, supplicate,\nget angry, or do anything else in the way of opposition; it would\nonly have been opposing a will harder than the granite rock.\n\nHans was finishing the repairs of the raft. One would have thought\nthat this strange being was guessing at my uncle's intentions. With a\nfew more pieces of surturbrand he had refitted our vessel. A sail\nalready hung from the new mast, and the wind was playing in its\nwaving folds.\n\nThe Professor said a few words to the guide, and immediately he put\neverything on board and arranged every necessary for our departure.\nThe air was clear--and the north-west wind blew steadily.\n\nWhat could I do? Could I stand against the two? It was impossible? If\nHans had but taken my side! But no, it was not to be. The Icelander\nseemed to have renounced all will of his own and made a vow to forget\nand deny himself. I could get nothing out of a servant so feudalised,\nas it were, to his master. My only course was to proceed.\n\nI was therefore going with as much resignation as I could find to\nresume my accustomed place on the raft, when my uncle laid his hand\nupon my shoulder.\n\n\"We shall not sail until to-morrow,\" he said.\n\nI made a movement intended to express resignation.\n\n\"I must neglect nothing,\" he said; \"and since my fate has driven me\non this part of the coast, I will not leave it until I have examined\nit.\"\n\nTo understand what followed, it must be borne in mind that, through\ncircumstances hereafter to be explained, we were not really where the\nProfessor supposed we were. In fact we were not upon the north shore\nof the sea.\n\n\"Now let us start upon fresh discoveries,\" I said.\n\nAnd leaving Hans to his work we started off together. The space\nbetween the water and the foot of the cliffs was considerable. It\ntook half an hour to bring us to the wall of rock. We trampled under\nour feet numberless shells of all the forms and sizes which existed\nin the earliest ages of the world. I also saw immense carapaces more\nthan fifteen feet in diameter. They had been the coverings of those\ngigantic glyptodons or armadilloes of the pleiocene period, of which\nthe modern tortoise is but a miniature representative. [1] The soil\nwas besides this scattered with stony fragments, boulders rounded by\nwater action, and ridged up in successive lines. I was therefore led\nto the conclusion that at one time the sea must have covered the\nground on which we were treading. On the loose and scattered rocks,\nnow out of the reach of the highest tides, the waves had left\nmanifest traces of their power to wear their way in the hardest stone.\n\nThis might up to a certain point explain the existence of an ocean\nforty leagues beneath the surface of the globe. But in my opinion\nthis liquid mass would be lost by degrees farther and farther within\nthe interior of the earth, and it certainly had its origin in the\nwaters of the ocean overhead, which had made their way hither through\nsome fissure. Yet it must be believed that that fissure is now\nclosed, and that all this cavern or immense reservoir was filled in a\nvery short time. Perhaps even this water, subjected to the fierce\naction of central heat, had partly been resolved into vapour. This\nwould explain the existence of those clouds suspended over our heads\nand the development of that electricity which raised such tempests\nwithin the bowels of the earth.\n\nThis theory of the phenomena we had witnessed seemed satisfactory to\nme; for however great and stupendous the phenomena of nature, fixed\nphysical laws will or may always explain them.\n\nWe were therefore walking upon sedimentary soil, the deposits of the\nwaters of former ages. The Professor was carefully examining every\nlittle fissure in the rocks. Wherever he saw a hole he always wanted\nto know the depth of it. To him this was important.\n\nWe had traversed the shores of the Liedenbrock sea for a mile when we\nobserved a sudden change in the appearance of the soil. It seemed\nupset, contorted, and convulsed by a violent upheaval of the lower\nstrata. In many places depressions or elevations gave witness to some\ntremendous power effecting the dislocation of strata.\n\n[1] The glyptodon and armadillo are mammalian; the tortoise is a\nchelonian, a reptile, distinct classes of the animal kingdom;\ntherefore the latter cannot be a representative of the former.\n(Trans.)\n\nWe moved with difficulty across these granite fissures and chasms\nmingled with silex, crystals of quartz, and alluvial deposits, when a\nfield, nay, more than a field, a vast plain, of bleached bones lay\nspread before us. It seemed like an immense cemetery, where the\nremains of twenty ages mingled their dust together. Huge mounds of\nbony fragments rose stage after stage in the distance. They undulated\naway to the limits of the horizon, and melted in the distance in a\nfaint haze. There within three square miles were accumulated the\nmaterials for a complete history of the animal life of ages, a\nhistory scarcely outlined in the too recent strata of the inhabited\nworld.\n\nBut an impatient curiosity impelled our steps; crackling and\nrattling, our feet were trampling on the remains of prehistoric\nanimals and interesting fossils, the possession of which is a matter\nof rivalry and contention between the museums of great cities. A\nthousand Cuviers could never have reconstructed the organic remains\ndeposited in this magnificent and unparalleled collection.\n\nI stood amazed. My uncle had uplifted his long arms to the vault\nwhich was our sky; his mouth gaping wide, his eyes flashing behind\nhis shining spectacles, his head balancing with an up-and-down\nmotion, his whole attitude denoted unlimited astonishment. Here he\nstood facing an immense collection of scattered leptotheria,\nmericotheria, lophiodia, anoplotheria, megatheria, mastodons,\nprotopithec\u00e6, pterodactyles, and all sorts of extinct monsters here\nassembled together for his special satisfaction. Fancy an\nenthusiastic bibliomaniac suddenly brought into the midst of the\nfamous Alexandrian library burnt by Omar and restored by a miracle\nfrom its ashes! just such a crazed enthusiast was my uncle, Professor\nLiedenbrock.\n\nBut more was to come, when, with a rush through clouds of bone dust,\nhe laid his hand upon a bare skull, and cried with a voice trembling\nwith excitement:\n\n\"Axel! Axel! a human head!\"\n\n\"A human skull?\" I cried, no less astonished.\n\n\"Yes, nephew. Aha! M. Milne-Edwards! Ah! M. de Quatrefages, how I\nwish you were standing here at the side of Otto Liedenbrock!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\n\nTHE PROFESSOR IN HIS CHAIR AGAIN\n\n\nTo understand this apostrophe of my uncle's, made to absent French\nsavants, it will be necessary to allude to an event of high\nimportance in a pal\u00e6ontological point of view, which had occurred a\nlittle while before our departure.\n\nOn the 28th of March, 1863, some excavators working under the\ndirection of M. Boucher de Perthes, in the stone quarries of Moulin\nQuignon, near Abbeville, in the department of Somme, found a human\njawbone fourteen feet beneath the surface. It was the first fossil of\nthis nature that had ever been brought to light. Not far distant were\nfound stone hatchets and flint arrow-heads stained and encased by\nlapse of time with a uniform coat of rust.\n\nThe noise of this discovery was very great, not in France alone, but in\nEngland and in Germany. Several savants of the French Institute, and\namongst them MM. Milne-Edwards and de Quatrefages, saw at once the\nimportance of this discovery, proved to demonstration the genuineness of\nthe bone in question, and became the most ardent defendants in what the\nEnglish called this 'trial of a jawbone.' To the geologists of the\nUnited Kingdom, who believed in the certainty of the fact--Messrs.\nFalconer, Busk, Carpenter, and others--scientific Germans were soon\njoined, and amongst them the forwardest, the most fiery, and the most\nenthusiastic, was my uncle Liedenbrock.\n\nTherefore the genuineness of a fossil human relic of the quaternary\nperiod seemed to be incontestably proved and admitted.\n\nIt is true that this theory met with a most obstinate opponent in M.\nElie de Beaumont. This high authority maintained that the soil of\nMoulin Quignon was not diluvial at all, but was of much more recent\nformation; and, agreeing in that with Cuvier, he refused to admit\nthat the human species could be contemporary with the animals of the\nquaternary period. My uncle Liedenbrock, along with the great body of\nthe geologists, had maintained his ground, disputed, and argued,\nuntil M. Elie de Beaumont stood almost alone in his opinion.\n\nWe knew all these details, but we were not aware that since our\ndeparture the question had advanced to farther stages. Other similar\nmaxillaries, though belonging to individuals of various types and\ndifferent nations, were found in the loose grey soil of certain\ngrottoes in France, Switzerland, and Belgium, as well as weapons,\ntools, earthen utensils, bones of children and adults. The existence\ntherefore of man in the quaternary period seemed to become daily more\ncertain.\n\nNor was this all. Fresh discoveries of remains in the pleiocene\nformation had emboldened other geologists to refer back the human\nspecies to a higher antiquity still. It is true that these remains\nwere not human bones, but objects bearing the traces of his\nhandiwork, such as fossil leg-bones of animals, sculptured and carved\nevidently by the hand of man.\n\nThus, at one bound, the record of the existence of man receded far\nback into the history of the ages past; he was a predecessor of the\nmastodon; he was a contemporary of the southern elephant; he lived a\nhundred thousand years ago, when, according to geologists, the\npleiocene formation was in progress.\n\nSuch then was the state of pal\u00e6ontological science, and what we knew\nof it was sufficient to explain our behaviour in the presence of this\nstupendous Golgotha. Any one may now understand the frenzied\nexcitement of my uncle, when, twenty yards farther on, he found\nhimself face to face with a primitive man!\n\nIt was a perfectly recognisable human body. Had some particular soil,\nlike that of the cemetery St. Michel, at Bordeaux, preserved it thus\nfor so many ages? It might be so. But this dried corpse, with its\nparchment-like skin drawn tightly over the bony frame, the limbs\nstill preserving their shape, sound teeth, abundant hair, and finger\nand toe nails of frightful length, this desiccated mummy startled us\nby appearing just as it had lived countless ages ago. I stood mute\nbefore this apparition of remote antiquity. My uncle, usually so\ngarrulous, was struck dumb likewise. We raised the body. We stood it\nup against a rock. It seemed to stare at us out of its empty orbits.\nWe sounded with our knuckles his hollow frame.\n\nAfter some moments' silence the Professor was himself again. Otto\nLiedenbrock, yielding to his nature, forgot all the circumstances of\nour eventful journey, forgot where we were standing, forgot the\nvaulted cavern which contained us. No doubt he was in mind back again\nin his Johann\u00e6um, holding forth to his pupils, for he assumed his\nlearned air; and addressing himself to an imaginary audience, he\nproceeded thus:\n\n\"Gentlemen, I have the honour to introduce to you a man of the\nquaternary or post-tertiary system. Eminent geologists have denied\nhis existence, others no less eminent have affirmed it. The St.\nThomases of pal\u00e6ontology, if they were here, might now touch him with\ntheir fingers, and would be obliged to acknowledge their error. I am\nquite aware that science has to be on its guard with discoveries of\nthis kind. I know what capital enterprising individuals like Barnum\nhave made out of fossil men. I have heard the tale of the kneepan of\nAjax, the pretended body of Orestes claimed to have been found by the\nSpartans, and of the body of Asterius, ten cubits long, of which\nPausanias speaks. I have read the reports of the skeleton of Trapani,\nfound in the fourteenth century, and which was at the time identified\nas that of Polyphemus; and the history of the giant unearthed in the\nsixteenth century near Palermo. You know as well as I do, gentlemen,\nthe analysis made at Lucerne in 1577 of those huge bones which the\ncelebrated Dr. Felix Plater affirmed to be those of a giant nineteen\nfeet high. I have gone through the treatises of Cassanion, and all\nthose memoirs, pamphlets, answers, and rejoinders published\nrespecting the skeleton of Teutobochus, the invader of Gaul, dug out\nof a sandpit in the Dauphin\u00e9, in 1613. In the eighteenth century I\nwould have stood up for Scheuchzer's pre-adamite man against Peter\nCampet. I have perused a writing, entitled Gigan--\"\n\nHere my uncle's unfortunate infirmity met him--that of being unable\nin public to pronounce hard words.\n\n\"The pamphlet entitled Gigan--\"\n\nHe could get no further.\n\n\"Giganteo--\"\n\nIt was not to be done. The unlucky word would not come out. At the\nJohann\u00e6um there would have been a laugh.\n\n\"Gigantosteologie,\" at last the Professor burst out, between two\nwords which I shall not record here.\n\nThen rushing on with renewed vigour, and with great animation:\n\n\"Yes, gentlemen, I know all these things, and more. I know that\nCuvier and Blumenbach have recognised in these bones nothing more\nremarkable than the bones of the mammoth and other mammals of the\npost-tertiary period. But in the presence of this specimen to doubt\nwould be to insult science. There stands the body! You may see it,\ntouch it. It is not a mere skeleton; it is an entire body, preserved\nfor a purely anthropological end and purpose.\"\n\nI was good enough not to contradict this startling assertion.\n\n\"If I could only wash it in a solution of sulphuric acid,\" pursued my\nuncle, \"I should be able to clear it from all the earthy particles\nand the shells which are incrusted about it. But I do not possess\nthat valuable solvent. Yet, such as it is, the body shall tell us its\nown wonderful story.\"\n\nHere the Professor laid hold of the fossil skeleton, and handled it\nwith the skill of a dexterous showman.\n\n\"You see,\" he said, \"that it is not six feet long, and that we are\nstill separated by a long interval from the pretended race of giants.\nAs for the family to which it belongs, it is evidently Caucasian. It\nis the white race, our own. The skull of this fossil is a regular\noval, or rather ovoid. It exhibits no prominent cheekbones, no\nprojecting jaws. It presents no appearance of that prognathism which\ndiminishes the facial angle. [1] Measure that angle. It is nearly\nninety degrees. But I will go further in my deductions, and I will\naffirm that this specimen of the human family is of the Japhetic\nrace, which has since spread from the Indies to the Atlantic. Don't\nsmile, gentlemen.\"\n\nNobody was smiling; but the learned Professor was frequently\ndisturbed by the broad smiles provoked by his learned eccentricities.\n\n\"Yes,\" he pursued with animation, \"this is a fossil man, the\ncontemporary of the mastodons whose remains fill this amphitheatre.\nBut if you ask me how he came there, how those strata on which he lay\nslipped down into this enormous hollow in the globe, I confess I\ncannot answer that question. No doubt in the post-tertiary period\nconsiderable commotions were still disturbing the crust of the earth.\nThe long-continued cooling of the globe produced chasms, fissures,\nclefts, and faults, into which, very probably, portions of the upper\nearth may have fallen. I make no rash assertions; but there is the\nman surrounded by his own works, by hatchets, by flint arrow-heads,\nwhich are the characteristics of the stone age. And unless he came\nhere, like myself, as a tourist on a visit and as a pioneer of\nscience, I can entertain no doubt of the authenticity of his remote\norigin.\"\n\n[1] The facial angle is formed by two lines, one touching the brow\nand the front teeth, the other from the orifice of the ear to the\nlower line of the nostrils. The greater this angle, the higher\nintelligence denoted by the formation of the skull. Prognathism is\nthat projection of the jaw-bones which sharpens or lessons this\nangle, and which is illustrated in the negro countenance and in the\nlowest savages.\n\nThe Professor ceased to speak, and the audience broke out into loud\nand unanimous applause. For of course my uncle was right, and wiser\nmen than his nephew would have had some trouble to refute his\nstatements.\n\nAnother remarkable thing. This fossil body was not the only one in\nthis immense catacomb. We came upon other bodies at every step\namongst this mortal dust, and my uncle might select the most curious\nof these specimens to demolish the incredulity of sceptics.\n\nIn fact it was a wonderful spectacle, that of these generations of\nmen and animals commingled in a common cemetery. Then one very\nserious question arose presently which we scarcely dared to suggest.\nHad all those creatures slided through a great fissure in the crust\nof the earth, down to the shores of the Liedenbrock sea, when they\nwere dead and turning to dust, or had they lived and grown and died\nhere in this subterranean world under a false sky, just like\ninhabitants of the upper earth? Until the present time we had seen\nalive only marine monsters and fishes. Might not some living man,\nsome native of the abyss, be yet a wanderer below on this desert\nstrand?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\n\nFOREST SCENERY ILLUMINATED BY ELECTRICITY\n\n\nFor another half hour we trod upon a pavement of bones. We pushed on,\nimpelled by our burning curiosity. What other marvels did this cavern\ncontain? What new treasures lay here for science to unfold? I was\nprepared for any surprise, my imagination was ready for any\nastonishment however astounding.\n\nWe had long lost sight of the sea shore behind the hills of bones.\nThe rash Professor, careless of losing his way, hurried me forward.\nWe advanced in silence, bathed in luminous electric fluid. By some\nphenomenon which I am unable to explain, it lighted up all sides of\nevery object equally. Such was its diffusiveness, there being no\ncentral point from which the light emanated, that shadows no longer\nexisted. You might have thought yourself under the rays of a vertical\nsun in a tropical region at noonday and the height of summer. No\nvapour was visible. The rocks, the distant mountains, a few isolated\nclumps of forest trees in the distance, presented a weird and\nwonderful aspect under these totally new conditions of a universal\ndiffusion of light. We were like Hoffmann's shadowless man.\n\nAfter walking a mile we reached the outskirts of a vast forest, but\nnot one of those forests of fungi which bordered Port Gr\u00e4uben.\n\nHere was the vegetation of the tertiary period in its fullest blaze\nof magnificence. Tall palms, belonging to species no longer living,\nsplendid palmacites, firs, yews, cypress trees, thujas,\nrepresentatives of the conifers, were linked together by a tangled\nnetwork of long climbing plants. A soft carpet of moss and hepaticas\nluxuriously clothed the soil. A few sparkling streams ran almost in\nsilence under what would have been the shade of the trees, but that\nthere was no shadow. On their banks grew tree-ferns similar to those\nwe grow in hothouses. But a remarkable feature was the total absence\nof colour in all those trees, shrubs, and plants, growing without the\nlife-giving heat and light of the sun. Everything seemed mixed-up and\nconfounded in one uniform silver grey or light brown tint like that\nof fading and faded leaves. Not a green leaf anywhere, and the\nflowers--which were abundant enough in the tertiary period, which\nfirst gave birth to flowers--looked like brown-paper flowers,\nwithout colour or scent.\n\nMy uncle Liedenbrock ventured to penetrate under this colossal grove.\nI followed him, not without fear. Since nature had here provided\nvegetable nourishment, why should not the terrible mammals be there\ntoo? I perceived in the broad clearings left by fallen trees, decayed\nwith age, leguminose plants, acerine\u00e6, rubice\u00e6 and many other eatable\nshrubs, dear to ruminant animals at every period. Then I observed,\nmingled together in confusion, trees of countries far apart on the\nsurface of the globe. The oak and the palm were growing side by side,\nthe Australian eucalyptus leaned against the Norwegian pine, the\nbirch-tree of the north mingled its foliage with New Zealand kauris.\nIt was enough to distract the most ingenious classifier of\nterrestrial botany.\n\nSuddenly I halted. I drew back my uncle.\n\nThe diffused light revealed the smallest object in the dense and\ndistant thickets. I had thought I saw--no! I did see, with my own\neyes, vast colossal forms moving amongst the trees. They were\ngigantic animals; it was a herd of mastodons--not fossil remains,\nbut living and resembling those the bones of which were found in the\nmarshes of Ohio in 1801. I saw those huge elephants whose long,\nflexible trunks were grouting and turning up the soil under the trees\nlike a legion of serpents. I could hear the crashing noise of their\nlong ivory tusks boring into the old decaying trunks. The boughs\ncracked, and the leaves torn away by cartloads went down the\ncavernous throats of the vast brutes.\n\nSo, then, the dream in which I had had a vision of the prehistoric\nworld, of the tertiary and post-tertiary periods, was now realised.\nAnd there we were alone, in the bowels of the earth, at the mercy of\nits wild inhabitants!\n\nMy uncle was gazing with intense and eager interest.\n\n\"Come on!\" said he, seizing my arm. \"Forward! forward!\"\n\n\"No, I will not!\" I cried. \"We have no firearms. What could we do in the\nmidst of a herd of these four-footed giants? Come away, uncle--come! No\nhuman being may with safety dare the anger of these monstrous beasts.\"\n\n\"No human creature?\" replied my uncle in a lower voice. \"You are\nwrong, Axel. Look, look down there! I fancy I see a living creature\nsimilar to ourselves: it is a man!\"\n\nI looked, shaking my head incredulously. But though at first I was\nunbelieving I had to yield to the evidence of my senses.\n\nIn fact, at a distance of a quarter of a mile, leaning against the\ntrunk of a gigantic kauri, stood a human being, the Proteus of those\nsubterranean regions, a new son of Neptune, watching this countless\nherd of mastodons.\n\nImmanis pecoris custos, immanior ipse. [1]\n\n[1] \"The shepherd of gigantic herds, and huger still himself.\"\n\nYes, truly, huger still himself. It was no longer a fossil being like\nhim whose dried remains we had easily lifted up in the field of\nbones; it was a giant, able to control those monsters. In stature he\nwas at least twelve feet high. His head, huge and unshapely as a\nbuffalo's, was half hidden in the thick and tangled growth of his\nunkempt hair. It most resembled the mane of the primitive elephant.\nIn his hand he wielded with ease an enormous bough, a staff worthy of\nthis shepherd of the geologic period.\n\nWe stood petrified and speechless with amazement. But he might see\nus! We must fly!\n\n\"Come, do come!\" I said to my uncle, who for once allowed himself to\nbe persuaded.\n\nIn another quarter of an hour our nimble heels had carried us beyond\nthe reach of this horrible monster.\n\nAnd yet, now that I can reflect quietly, now that my spirit has grown\ncalm again, now that months have slipped by since this strange and\nsupernatural meeting, what am I to think? what am I to believe? I\nmust conclude that it was impossible that our senses had been\ndeceived, that our eyes did not see what we supposed they saw. No\nhuman being lives in this subterranean world; no generation of men\ndwells in those inferior caverns of the globe, unknown to and\nunconnected with the inhabitants of its surface. It is absurd to\nbelieve it!\n\nI had rather admit that it may have been some animal whose structure\nresembled the human, some ape or baboon of the early geological ages,\nsome protopitheca, or some mesopitheca, some early or middle ape like\nthat discovered by Mr. Lartet in the bone cave of Sansau. But this\ncreature surpassed in stature all the measurements known in modern\npal\u00e6ontology. But that a man, a living man, and therefore whole\ngenerations doubtless besides, should be buried there in the bowels\nof the earth, is impossible.\n\nHowever, we had left behind us the luminous forest, dumb with\nastonishment, overwhelmed and struck down with a terror which\namounted to stupefaction. We kept running on for fear the horrible\nmonster might be on our track. It was a flight, a fall, like that\nfearful pulling and dragging which is peculiar to nightmare.\nInstinctively we got back to the Liedenbrock sea, and I cannot say\ninto what vagaries my mind would not have carried me but for a\ncircumstance which brought me back to practical matters.\n\nAlthough I was certain that we were now treading upon a soil not\nhitherto touched by our feet, I often perceived groups of rocks which\nreminded me of those about Port Gr\u00e4uben. Besides, this seemed to\nconfirm the indications of the needle, and to show that we had\nagainst our will returned to the north of the Liedenbrock sea.\nOccasionally we felt quite convinced. Brooks and waterfalls were\ntumbling everywhere from the projections in the rocks. I thought I\nrecognised the bed of surturbrand, our faithful Hansbach, and the\ngrotto in which I had recovered life and consciousness. Then a few\npaces farther on, the arrangement of the cliffs, the appearance of an\nunrecognised stream, or the strange outline of a rock, came to throw\nme again into doubt.\n\nI communicated my doubts to my uncle. Like myself, he hesitated; he\ncould recognise nothing again amidst this monotonous scene.\n\n\"Evidently,\" said I, \"we have not landed again at our original\nstarting point, but the storm has carried us a little higher, and if\nwe follow the shore we shall find Port Gr\u00e4uben.\"\n\n\"If that is the case it will be useless to continue our exploration,\nand we had better return to our raft. But, Axel, are you not\nmistaken?\"\n\n\"It is difficult to speak decidedly, uncle, for all these rocks are\nso very much alike. Yet I think I recognise the promontory at the\nfoot of which Hans constructed our launch. We must be very near the\nlittle port, if indeed this is not it,\" I added, examining a creek\nwhich I thought I recognised.\n\n\"No, Axel, we should at least find our own traces and I see nothing--\"\n\n\"But I do see,\" I cried, darting upon an object lying on the sand.\n\nAnd I showed my uncle a rusty dagger which I had just picked up.\n\n\"Come,\" said he, \"had you this weapon with you?\"\n\n\"I! No, certainly! But you, perhaps--\"\n\n\"Not that I am aware,\" said the Professor. \"I have never had this\nobject in my possession.\"\n\n\"Well, this is strange!\"\n\n\"No, Axel, it is very simple. The Icelanders often wear arms of this\nkind. This must have belonged to Hans, and he has lost it.\"\n\nI shook my head. Hans had never had an object like this in his\npossession.\n\n\"Did it not belong to some pre-adamite warrior?\" I cried, \"to some\nliving man, contemporary with the huge cattle-driver? But no. This is\nnot a relic of the stone age. It is not even of the iron age. This\nblade is steel--\"\n\nMy uncle stopped me abruptly on my way to a dissertation which would\nhave taken me a long way, and said coolly:\n\n\"Be calm, Axel, and reasonable. This dagger belongs to the sixteenth\ncentury; it is a poniard, such as gentlemen carried in their belts to\ngive the coup _de grace._ Its origin is Spanish. It was never either\nyours, or mine, or the hunter's, nor did it belong to any of those\nhuman beings who may or may not inhabit this inner world. See, it was\nnever jagged like this by cutting men's throats; its blade is coated\nwith a rust neither a day, nor a year, nor a hundred years old.\"\n\nThe Professor was getting excited according to his wont, and was\nallowing his imagination to run away with him.\n\n\"Axel, we are on the way towards the grand discovery. This blade has\nbeen left on the strand for from one to three hundred years, and has\nblunted its edge upon the rocks that fringe this subterranean sea!\"\n\n\"But it has not come alone. It has not twisted itself out of shape;\nsome one has been here before us!\n\n\"Yes--a man has.\"\n\n\"And who was that man?\"\n\n\"A man who has engraved his name somewhere with that dagger. That man\nwanted once more to mark the way to the centre of the earth. Let us\nlook about: look about!\"\n\nAnd, wonderfully interested, we peered all along the high wall,\npeeping into every fissure which might open out into a gallery.\n\nAnd so we arrived at a place where the shore was much narrowed. Here\nthe sea came to lap the foot of the steep cliff, leaving a passage no\nwider than a couple of yards. Between two boldly projecting rocks\nappeared the mouth of a dark tunnel.\n\nThere, upon a granite slab, appeared two mysterious graven letters,\nhalf eaten away by time. They were the initials of the bold and\ndaring traveller:\n\n[Runic initials appear here]\n\n\"A. S.,\" shouted my uncle. \"Arne Saknussemm! Arne Saknussemm\neverywhere!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL.\n\nPREPARATIONS FOR BLASTING A PASSAGE TO THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH\n\n\nSince the start upon this marvellous pilgrimage I had been through so\nmany astonishments that I might well be excused for thinking myself\nwell hardened against any further surprise. Yet at the sight of these\ntwo letters, engraved on this spot three hundred years ago, I stood\naghast in dumb amazement. Not only were the initials of the learned\nalchemist visible upon the living rock, but there lay the iron point\nwith which the letters had been engraved. I could no longer doubt of\nthe existence of that wonderful traveller and of the fact of his\nunparalleled journey, without the most glaring incredulity.\n\nWhilst these reflections were occupying me, Professor Liedenbrock had\nlaunched into a somewhat rhapsodical eulogium, of which Arne\nSaknussemm was, of course, the hero.\n\n\"Thou marvellous genius!\" he cried, \"thou hast not forgotten one\nindication which might serve to lay open to mortals the road through\nthe terrestrial crust; and thy fellow-creatures may even now, after\nthe lapse of three centuries, again trace thy footsteps through these\ndeep and darksome ways. You reserved the contemplation of these\nwonders for other eyes besides your own. Your name, graven from stage\nto stage, leads the bold follower of your footsteps to the very\ncentre of our planet's core, and there again we shall find your own\nname written with your own hand. I too will inscribe my name upon\nthis dark granite page. But for ever henceforth let this cape that\nadvances into the sea discovered by yourself be known by your own\nillustrious name--Cape Saknussemm.\"\n\nSuch were the glowing words of panegyric which fell upon my attentive\near, and I could not resist the sentiment of enthusiasm with which I\ntoo was infected. The fire of zeal kindled afresh in me. I forgot\neverything. I dismissed from my mind the past perils of the journey,\nthe future danger of our return. That which another had done I\nsupposed we might also do, and nothing that was not superhuman\nappeared impossible to me.\n\n\"Forward! forward!\" I cried.\n\nI was already darting down the gloomy tunnel when the Professor\nstopped me; he, the man of impulse, counselled patience and coolness.\n\n\"Let us first return to Hans,\" he said, \"and bring the raft to this\nspot.\"\n\nI obeyed, not without dissatisfaction, and passed out rapidly among\nthe rocks on the shore.\n\nI said: \"Uncle, do you know it seems to me that circumstances have\nwonderfully befriended us hitherto?\"\n\n\"You think so, Axel?\"\n\n\"No doubt; even the tempest has put us on the right way. Blessings on\nthat storm! It has brought us back to this coast from which fine\nweather would have carried us far away. Suppose we had touched with\nour prow (the prow of a rudder!) the southern shore of the\nLiedenbrock sea, what would have become of us? We should never have\nseen the name of Saknussemm, and we should at this moment be\nimprisoned on a rockbound, impassable coast.\"\n\n\"Yes, Axel, it is providential that whilst supposing we were steering\nsouth we should have just got back north at Cape Saknussemm. I must\nsay that this is astonishing, and that I feel I have no way to\nexplain it.\"\n\n\"What does that signify, uncle? Our business is not to explain facts,\nbut to use them!\"\n\n\"Certainly; but--\"\n\n\"Well, uncle, we are going to resume the northern route, and to pass\nunder the north countries of Europe--under Sweden, Russia, Siberia:\nwho knows where?--instead of burrowing under the deserts of Africa,\nor perhaps the waves of the Atlantic; and that is all I want to know.\"\n\n\"Yes, Axel, you are right. It is all for the best, since we have left\nthat weary, horizontal sea, which led us nowhere. Now we shall go\ndown, down, down! Do you know that it is now only 1,500 leagues to\nthe centre of the globe?\"\n\n\"Is that all?\" I cried. \"Why, that's nothing. Let us start: march!\"\n\nAll this crazy talk was going on still when we met the hunter.\nEverything was made ready for our instant departure. Every bit of\ncordage was put on board. We took our places, and with our sail set,\nHans steered us along the coast to Cape Saknussemm.\n\nThe wind was unfavourable to a species of launch not calculated for\nshallow water. In many places we were obliged to push ourselves along\nwith iron-pointed sticks. Often the sunken rocks just beneath the\nsurface obliged us to deviate from our straight course. At last,\nafter three hours' sailing, about six in the evening we reached a\nplace suitable for our landing. I jumped ashore, followed by my uncle\nand the Icelander. This short passage had not served to cool my\nardour. On the contrary, I even proposed to burn 'our ship,' to\nprevent the possibility of return; but my uncle would not consent to\nthat. I thought him singularly lukewarm.\n\n\"At least,\" I said, \"don't let us lose a minute.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, lad,\" he replied; \"but first let us examine this new\ngallery, to see if we shall require our ladders.\"\n\nMy uncle put his Ruhmkorff's apparatus in action; the raft moored to\nthe shore was left alone; the mouth of the tunnel was not twenty\nyards from us; and our party, with myself at the head, made for it\nwithout a moment's delay.\n\nThe aperture, which was almost round, was about five feet in\ndiameter; the dark passage was cut out in the live rock and lined\nwith a coat of the eruptive matter which formerly issued from it; the\ninterior was level with the ground outside, so that we were able to\nenter without difficulty. We were following a horizontal plane, when,\nonly six paces in, our progress was interrupted by an enormous block\njust across our way.\n\n\"Accursed rock!\" I cried in a passion, finding myself suddenly\nconfronted by an impassable obstacle.\n\nRight and left we searched in vain for a way, up and down, side to\nside; there was no getting any farther. I felt fearfully\ndisappointed, and I would not admit that the obstacle was final. I\nstopped, I looked underneath the block: no opening. Above: granite\nstill. Hans passed his lamp over every portion of the barrier in\nvain. We must give up all hope of passing it.\n\nI sat down in despair. My uncle strode from side to side in the\nnarrow passage.\n\n\"But how was it with Saknussemm?\" I cried.\n\n\"Yes,\" said my uncle, \"was he stopped by this stone barrier?\"\n\n\"No, no,\" I replied with animation. \"This fragment of rock has been\nshaken down by some shock or convulsion, or by one of those magnetic\nstorms which agitate these regions, and has blocked up the passage\nwhich lay open to him. Many years have elapsed since the return of\nSaknussemm to the surface and the fall of this huge fragment. Is it\nnot evident that this gallery was once the way open to the course of\nthe lava, and that at that time there must have been a free passage?\nSee here are recent fissures grooving and channelling the granite\nroof. This roof itself is formed of fragments of rock carried down,\nof enormous stones, as if by some giant's hand; but at one time the\nexpulsive force was greater than usual, and this block, like the\nfalling keystone of a ruined arch, has slipped down to the ground and\nblocked up the way. It is only an accidental obstruction, not met by\nSaknussemm, and if we don't destroy it we shall be unworthy to reach\nthe centre of the earth.\"\n\nSuch was my sentence! The soul of the Professor had passed into me.\nThe genius of discovery possessed me wholly. I forgot the past, I\nscorned the future. I gave not a thought to the things of the surface\nof this globe into which I had dived; its cities and its sunny\nplains, Hamburg and the K\u00f6nigstrasse, even poor Gr\u00e4uben, who must\nhave given us up for lost, all were for the time dismissed from the\npages of my memory.\n\n\"Well,\" cried my uncle, \"let us make a way with our pickaxes.\"\n\n\"Too hard for the pickaxe.\"\n\n\"Well, then, the spade.\"\n\n\"That would take us too long.\"\n\n\"What, then?\"\n\n\"Why gunpowder, to be sure! Let us mine the obstacle and blow it up.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, it is only a bit of rock to blast!\"\n\n\"Hans, to work!\" cried my uncle.\n\nThe Icelander returned to the raft and soon came back with an iron\nbar which he made use of to bore a hole for the charge. This was no\neasy work. A hole was to be made large enough to hold fifty pounds of\nguncotton, whose expansive force is four times that of gunpowder.\n\nI was terribly excited. Whilst Hans was at work I was actively\nhelping my uncle to prepare a slow match of wetted powder encased in\nlinen.\n\n\"This will do it,\" I said.\n\n\"It will,\" replied my uncle.\n\nBy midnight our mining preparations were over; the charge was rammed\ninto the hole, and the slow match uncoiled along the gallery showed\nits end outside the opening.\n\nA spark would now develop the whole of our preparations into activity.\n\n\"To-morrow,\" said the Professor.\n\nI had to be resigned and to wait six long hours.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI.\n\nTHE GREAT EXPLOSION AND THE RUSH DOWN BELOW\n\n\nThe next day, Thursday, August 27, is a well-remembered date in our\nsubterranean journey. It never returns to my memory without sending\nthrough me a shudder of horror and a palpitation of the heart. From\nthat hour we had no further occasion for the exercise of reason, or\njudgment, or skill, or contrivance. We were henceforth to be hurled\nalong, the playthings of the fierce elements of the deep.\n\nAt six we were afoot. The moment drew near to clear a way by blasting\nthrough the opposing mass of granite.\n\nI begged for the honour of lighting the fuse. This duty done, I was\nto join my companions on the raft, which had not yet been unloaded;\nwe should then push off as far as we could and avoid the dangers\narising from the explosion, the effects of which were not likely to\nbe confined to the rock itself.\n\nThe fuse was calculated to burn ten minutes before setting fire to\nthe mine. I therefore had sufficient time to get away to the raft.\n\nI prepared to fulfil my task with some anxiety.\n\nAfter a hasty meal, my uncle and the hunter embarked whilst I\nremained on shore. I was supplied with a lighted lantern to set fire\nto the fuse. \"Now go,\" said my uncle, \"and return immediately to us.\"\n\"Don't be uneasy,\" I replied. \"I will not play by the way.\" I\nimmediately proceeded to the mouth of the tunnel. I opened my\nlantern. I laid hold of the end of the match. The Professor stood,\nchronometer in hand. \"Ready?\" he cried.\n\n\"Ay.\"\n\n\"Fire!\"\n\nI instantly plunged the end of the fuse into the lantern. It\nspluttered and flamed, and I ran at the top of my speed to the raft.\n\n\"Come on board quickly, and let us push off.\"\n\nHans, with a vigorous thrust, sent us from the shore. The raft shot\ntwenty fathoms out to sea.\n\nIt was a moment of intense excitement. The Professor was watching the\nhand of the chronometer.\n\n\"Five minutes more!\" he said. \"Four! Three!\"\n\nMy pulse beat half-seconds.\n\n\"Two! One! Down, granite rocks; down with you.\"\n\nWhat took place at that moment? I believe I did not hear the dull\nroar of the explosion. But the rocks suddenly assumed a new\narrangement: they rent asunder like a curtain. I saw a bottomless pit\nopen on the shore. The sea, lashed into sudden fury, rose up in an\nenormous billow, on the ridge of which the unhappy raft was uplifted\nbodily in the air with all its crew and cargo.\n\nWe all three fell down flat. In less than a second we were in deep,\nunfathomable darkness. Then I felt as if not only myself but the raft\nalso had no support beneath. I thought it was sinking; but it was not\nso. I wanted to speak to my uncle, but the roaring of the waves\nprevented him from hearing even the sound of my voice.\n\nIn spite of darkness, noise, astonishment, and terror, I then\nunderstood what had taken place.\n\nOn the other side of the blown-up rock was an abyss. The explosion\nhad caused a kind of earthquake in this fissured and abysmal region;\na great gulf had opened; and the sea, now changed into a torrent, was\nhurrying us along into it.\n\nI gave myself up for lost.\n\nAn hour passed away--two hours, perhaps--I cannot tell. We clutched\neach other fast, to save ourselves from being thrown off the raft. We\nfelt violent shocks whenever we were borne heavily against the craggy\nprojections. Yet these shocks were not very frequent, from which I\nconcluded that the gully was widening. It was no doubt the same road\nthat Saknussemm had taken; but instead of walking peaceably down it,\nas he had done, we were carrying a whole sea along with us.\n\nThese ideas, it will be understood, presented themselves to my mind\nin a vague and undetermined form. I had difficulty in associating any\nideas together during this headlong race, which seemed like a\nvertical descent. To judge by the air which was whistling past me and\nmade a whizzing in my ears, we were moving faster than the fastest\nexpress trains. To light a torch under these' conditions would have\nbeen impossible; and our last electric apparatus had been shattered\nby the force of the explosion.\n\nI was therefore much surprised to see a clear light shining near me.\nIt lighted up the calm and unmoved countenance of Hans. The skilful\nhuntsman had succeeded in lighting the lantern; and although it\nflickered so much as to threaten to go out, it threw a fitful light\nacross the awful darkness.\n\nI was right in my supposition. It was a wide gallery. The dim light\ncould not show us both its walls at once. The fall of the waters\nwhich were carrying us away exceeded that of the swiftest rapids in\nAmerican rivers. Its surface seemed composed of a sheaf of arrows\nhurled with inconceivable force; I cannot convey my impressions by a\nbetter comparison. The raft, occasionally seized by an eddy, spun\nround as it still flew along. When it approached the walls of the\ngallery I threw on them the light of the lantern, and I could judge\nsomewhat of the velocity of our speed by noticing how the jagged\nprojections of the rocks spun into endless ribbons and bands, so that\nwe seemed confined within a network of shifting lines. I supposed we\nwere running at the rate of thirty leagues an hour.\n\nMy uncle and I gazed on each other with haggard eyes, clinging to the\nstump of the mast, which had snapped asunder at the first shock of\nour great catastrophe. We kept our backs to the wind, not to be\nstifled by the rapidity of a movement which no human power could\ncheck.\n\nHours passed away. No change in our situation; but a discovery came\nto complicate matters and make them worse.\n\nIn seeking to put our cargo into somewhat better order, I found that\nthe greater part of the articles embarked had disappeared at the\nmoment of the explosion, when the sea broke in upon us with such\nviolence. I wanted to know exactly what we had saved, and with the\nlantern in my hand I began my examination. Of our instruments none\nwere saved but the compass and the chronometer; our stock of ropes\nand ladders was reduced to the bit of cord rolled round the stump of\nthe mast! Not a spade, not a pickaxe, not a hammer was left us; and,\nirreparable disaster! we had only one day's provisions left.\n\nI searched every nook and corner, every crack and cranny in the raft.\nThere was nothing. Our provisions were reduced to one bit of salt\nmeat and a few biscuits.\n\nI stared at our failing supplies stupidly. I refused to take in the\ngravity of our loss. And yet what was the use of troubling myself. If\nwe had had provisions enough for months, how could we get out of the\nabyss into which we were being hurled by an irresistible torrent? Why\nshould we fear the horrors of famine, when death was swooping down\nupon us in a multitude of other forms? Would there be time left to\ndie of starvation?\n\nYet by an inexplicable play of the imagination I forgot my present\ndangers, to contemplate the threatening future. Was there any chance\nof escaping from the fury of this impetuous torrent, and of returning\nto the surface of the globe? I could not form the slightest\nconjecture how or when. But one chance in a thousand, or ten\nthousand, is still a chance; whilst death from starvation would leave\nus not the smallest hope in the world.\n\nThe thought came into my mind to declare the whole truth to my uncle,\nto show him the dreadful straits to which we were reduced, and to\ncalculate how long we might yet expect to live. But I had the courage\nto preserve silence. I wished to leave him cool and self-possessed.\n\nAt that moment the light from our lantern began to sink by little and\nlittle, and then went out entirely. The wick had burnt itself out.\nBlack night reigned again; and there was no hope left of being able\nto dissipate the palpable darkness. We had yet a torch left, but we\ncould not have kept it alight. Then, like a child, I closed my eyes\nfirmly, not to see the darkness.\n\nAfter a considerable lapse of time our speed redoubled. I could\nperceive it by the sharpness of the currents that blew past my face.\nThe descent became steeper. I believe we were no longer sliding, but\nfalling down. I had an impression that we were dropping vertically.\nMy uncle's hand, and the vigorous arm of Hans, held me fast.\n\nSuddenly, after a space of time that I could not measure, I felt a\nshock. The raft had not struck against any hard resistance, but had\nsuddenly been checked in its fall. A waterspout, an immense liquid\ncolumn, was beating upon the surface of the waters. I was\nsuffocating! I was drowning!\n\nBut this sudden flood was not of long duration. In a few seconds I\nfound myself in the air again, which I inhaled with all the force of\nmy lungs. My uncle and Hans were still holding me fast by the arms;\nand the raft was still carrying us.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLII.\n\nHEADLONG SPEED UPWARD THROUGH THE HORRORS OF DARKNESS\n\n\nIt might have been, as I guessed, about ten at night. The first of my\nsenses which came into play after this last bout was that of hearing.\nAll at once I could hear; and it was a real exercise of the sense of\nhearing. I could hear the silence in the gallery after the din which\nfor hours had stunned me. At last these words of my uncle's came to\nme like a vague murmuring:\n\n\"We are going up.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" I cried.\n\n\"Yes, we are going up--up!\"\n\nI stretched out my arm. I touched the wall, and drew back my hand\nbleeding. We were ascending with extreme rapidity.\n\n\"The torch! The torch!\" cried the Professor.\n\nNot without difficulty Hans succeeded in lighting the torch; and the\nflame, preserving its upward tendency, threw enough light to show us\nwhat kind of a place we were in.\n\n\"Just as I thought,\" said the Professor \"We are in a tunnel not\nfour-and-twenty feet in diameter. The water had reached the bottom of\nthe gulf. It is now rising to its level, and carrying us with it.\"\n\n\"Where to?\"\n\n\"I cannot tell; but we must be ready for anything. We are mounting at\na speed which seems to me of fourteen feet in a second, or ten miles\nan hour. At this rate we shall get on.\"\n\n\"Yes, if nothing stops us; if this well has an aperture. But suppose\nit to be stopped. If the air is condensed by the pressure of this\ncolumn of water we shall be crushed.\"\n\n\"Axel,\" replied the Professor with perfect coolness, \"our situation\nis almost desperate; but there are some chances of deliverance, and\nit is these that I am considering. If at every instant we may perish,\nso at every instant we may be saved. Let us then be prepared to seize\nupon the smallest advantage.\"\n\n\"But what shall we do now?\"\n\n\"Recruit our strength by eating.\"\n\nAt these words I fixed a haggard eye upon my uncle. That which I had\nbeen so unwilling to confess at last had to be told.\n\n\"Eat, did you say?\"\n\n\"Yes, at once.\"\n\nThe Professor added a few words in Danish, but Hans shook his head\nmournfully.\n\n\"What!\" cried my uncle. \"Have we lost our provisions?\"\n\n\"Yes; here is all we have left; one bit of salt meat for the three.\"\n\nMy uncle stared at me as if he could not understand.\n\n\"Well,\" said I, \"do you think we have any chance of being saved?\"\n\nMy question was unanswered.\n\nAn hour passed away. I began to feel the pangs of a violent hunger.\nMy companions were suffering too, and not one of us dared touch this\nwretched remnant of our goodly store.\n\nBut now we were mounting up with excessive speed. Sometimes the air\nwould cut our breath short, as is experienced by aeronauts ascending\ntoo rapidly. But whilst they suffer from cold in proportion to their\nrise, we were beginning to feel a contrary effect. The heat was\nincreasing in a manner to cause us the most fearful anxiety, and\ncertainly the temperature was at this moment at the height of 100\u00b0\nFahr.\n\nWhat could be the meaning of such a change? Up to this time facts had\nsupported the theories of Davy and of Liedenbrock; until now\nparticular conditions of non-conducting rocks, electricity and\nmagnetism, had tempered the laws of nature, giving us only a\nmoderately warm climate, for the theory of a central fire remained in\nmy estimation the only one that was true and explicable. Were we then\nturning back to where the phenomena of central heat ruled in all\ntheir rigour and would reduce the most refractory rocks to the state\nof a molten liquid? I feared this, and said to the Professor:\n\n\"If we are neither drowned, nor shattered to pieces, nor starved to\ndeath, there is still the chance that we may be burned alive and\nreduced to ashes.\"\n\nAt this he shrugged his shoulders and returned to his thoughts.\n\nAnother hour passed, and, except some slight increase in the\ntemperature, nothing new had happened.\n\n\"Come,\" said he, \"we must determine upon something.\"\n\n\"Determine on what?\" said I.\n\n\"Yes, we must recruit our strength by carefully rationing ourselves,\nand so prolong our existence by a few hours. But we shall be reduced\nto very great weakness at last.\"\n\n\"And our last hour is not far off.\"\n\n\"Well, if there is a chance of safety, if a moment for active\nexertion presents itself, where should we find the required strength\nif we allowed ourselves to be enfeebled by hunger?\"\n\n\"Well, uncle, when this bit of meat has been devoured what shall we\nhave left?\"\n\n\"Nothing, Axel, nothing at all. But will it do you any more good to\ndevour it with your eyes than with your teeth? Your reasoning has in\nit neither sense nor energy.\"\n\n\"Then don't you despair?\" I cried irritably.\n\n\"No, certainly not,\" was the Professor's firm reply.\n\n\"What! do you think there is any chance of safety left?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do; as long as the heart beats, as long as body and soul keep\ntogether, I cannot admit that any creature endowed with a will has\nneed to despair of life.\"\n\nResolute words these! The man who could speak so, under such\ncircumstances, was of no ordinary type.\n\n\"Finally, what do you mean to do?\" I asked.\n\n\"Eat what is left to the last crumb, and recruit our fading strength.\nThis meal will be our last, perhaps: so let it be! But at any rate we\nshall once more be men, and not exhausted, empty bags.\"\n\n\"Well, let us consume it then,\" I cried.\n\nMy uncle took the piece of meat and the few biscuits which had\nescaped from the general destruction. He divided them into three\nequal portions and gave one to each. This made about a pound of\nnourishment for each. The Professor ate his greedily, with a kind of\nfeverish rage. I ate without pleasure, almost with disgust; Hans\nquietly, moderately, masticating his small mouthfuls without any\nnoise, and relishing them with the calmness of a man above all\nanxiety about the future. By diligent search he had found a flask of\nHollands; he offered it to us each in turn, and this generous\nbeverage cheered us up slightly.\n\n\"_Fortr\u00e4fflig,_\" said Hans, drinking in his turn.\n\n\"Excellent,\" replied my uncle.\n\nA glimpse of hope had returned, although without cause. But our last\nmeal was over, and it was now five in the morning.\n\nMan is so constituted that health is a purely negative state. Hunger\nonce satisfied, it is difficult for a man to imagine the horrors of\nstarvation; they cannot be understood without being felt.\n\nTherefore it was that after our long fast these few mouthfuls of meat\nand biscuit made us triumph over our past agonies.\n\nBut as soon as the meal was done, we each of us fell deep into\nthought. What was Hans thinking of--that man of the far West, but\nwho seemed ruled by the fatalist doctrines of the East?\n\nAs for me, my thoughts were made up of remembrances, and they carried\nme up to the surface of the globe of which I ought never to have\ntaken leave. The house in the K\u00f6nigstrasse, my poor dear Gr\u00e4uben,\nthat kind soul Martha, flitted like visions before my eyes, and in\nthe dismal moanings which from time to time reached my ears I thought\nI could distinguish the roar of the traffic of the great cities upon\nearth.\n\nMy uncle still had his eye upon his work. Torch in hand, he tried to\ngather some idea of our situation from the observation of the strata.\nThis calculation could, at best, be but a vague approximation; but a\nlearned man is always a philosopher when he succeeds in remaining\ncool, and assuredly Professor Liedenbrock possessed this quality to a\nsurprising degree.\n\nI could hear him murmuring geological terms. I could understand them,\nand in spite of myself I felt interested in this last geological\nstudy.\n\n\"Eruptive granite,\" he was saying. \"We are still in the primitive\nperiod. But we are going up, up, higher still. Who can tell?\"\n\nAh! who can tell? With his hand he was examining the perpendicular\nwall, and in a few more minutes he continued:\n\n\"This is gneiss! here is mica schist! Ah! presently we shall come to\nthe transition period, and then--\"\n\nWhat did the Professor mean? Could he be trying to measure the\nthickness of the crust of the earth that lay between us and the world\nabove? Had he any means of making this calculation? No, he had not\nthe aneroid, and no guessing could supply its place.\n\nStill the temperature kept rising, and I felt myself steeped in a\nbroiling atmosphere. I could only compare it to the heat of a furnace\nat the moment when the molten metal is running into the mould.\nGradually we had been obliged to throw aside our coats and\nwaistcoats, the lightest covering became uncomfortable and even\npainful.\n\n\"Are we rising into a fiery furnace?\" I cried at one moment when the\nheat was redoubling.\n\n\"No,\" replied my uncle, \"that is impossible--quite impossible!\"\n\n\"Yet,\" I answered, feeling the wall, \"this well is burning hot.\"\n\nAt the same moment, touching the water, I had to withdraw my hand in\nhaste.\n\n\"The water is scalding,\" I cried.\n\nThis time the Professor's only answer was an angry gesture.\n\nThen an unconquerable terror seized upon me, from which I could no\nlonger get free. I felt that a catastrophe was approaching before\nwhich the boldest spirit must quail. A dim, vague notion laid hold of\nmy mind, but which was fast hardening into certainty. I tried to\nrepel it, but it would return. I dared not express it in plain terms.\nYet a few involuntary observations confirmed me in my view. By the\nflickering light of the torch I could distinguish contortions in the\ngranite beds; a phenomenon was unfolding in which electricity would\nplay the principal part; then this unbearable heat, this boiling\nwater! I consulted the compass.\n\nThe compass had lost its properties! it had ceased to act properly!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII.\n\nSHOT OUT OF A VOLCANO AT LAST!\n\n\nYes: our compass was no longer a guide; the needle flew from pole to\npole with a kind of frenzied impulse; it ran round the dial, and spun\nhither and thither as if it were giddy or intoxicated.\n\nI knew quite well that according to the best received theories the\nmineral covering of the globe is never at absolute rest; the changes\nbrought about by the chemical decomposition of its component parts,\nthe agitation caused by great liquid torrents, and the magnetic\ncurrents, are continually tending to disturb it--even when living\nbeings upon its surface may fancy that all is quiet below. A\nphenomenon of this kind would not have greatly alarmed me, or at any\nrate it would not have given rise to dreadful apprehensions.\n\nBut other facts, other circumstances, of a peculiar nature, came to\nreveal to me by degrees the true state of the case. There came\nincessant and continuous explosions. I could only compare them to the\nloud rattle of a long train of chariots driven at full speed over the\nstones, or a roar of unintermitting thunder.\n\nThen the disordered compass, thrown out of gear by the electric\ncurrents, confirmed me in a growing conviction. The mineral crust of\nthe globe threatened to burst up, the granite foundations to come\ntogether with a crash, the fissure through which we were helplessly\ndriven would be filled up, the void would be full of crushed\nfragments of rock, and we poor wretched mortals were to be buried and\nannihilated in this dreadful consummation.\n\n\"My uncle,\" I cried, \"we are lost now, utterly lost!\"\n\n\"What are you in a fright about now?\" was the calm rejoinder. \"What\nis the matter with you?\"\n\n\"The matter? Look at those quaking walls! look at those shivering\nrocks. Don't you feel the burning heat? Don't you see how the water\nboils and bubbles? Are you blind to the dense vapours and steam\ngrowing thicker and denser every minute? See this agitated compass\nneedle. It is an earthquake that is threatening us.\"\n\nMy undaunted uncle calmly shook his head.\n\n\"Do you think,\" said he, \"an earthquake is coming?\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"Well, I think you are mistaken.\"\n\n\"What! don't you recognise the symptoms?\"\n\n\"Of an earthquake? no! I am looking out for something better.\"\n\n\"What can you mean? Explain?\"\n\n\"It is an eruption, Axel.\"\n\n\"An eruption! Do you mean to affirm that we are running up the shaft\nof a volcano?\"\n\n\"I believe we are,\" said the indomitable Professor with an air of\nperfect self-possession; \"and it is the best thing that could\npossibly happen to us under our circumstances.\"\n\nThe best thing! Was my uncle stark mad? What did the man mean? and\nwhat was the use of saying facetious things at a time like this?\n\n\"What!\" I shouted. \"Are we being taken up in an eruption? Our fate\nhas flung us here among burning lavas, molten rocks, boiling waters,\nand all kinds of volcanic matter; we are going to be pitched out,\nexpelled, tossed up, vomited, spit out high into the air, along with\nfragments of rock, showers of ashes and scoria, in the midst of a\ntowering rush of smoke and flames; and it is the best thing that\ncould happen to us!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the Professor, eyeing me over his spectacles, \"I don't\nsee any other way of reaching the surface of the earth.\"\n\nI pass rapidly over the thousand ideas which passed through my mind.\nMy uncle was right, undoubtedly right; and never had he seemed to me\nmore daring and more confirmed in his notions than at this moment\nwhen he was calmly contemplating the chances of being shot out of a\nvolcano!\n\nIn the meantime up we went; the night passed away in continual\nascent; the din and uproar around us became more and more\nintensified; I was stifled and stunned; I thought my last hour was\napproaching; and yet imagination is such a strong thing that even in\nthis supreme hour I was occupied with strange and almost childish\nspeculations. But I was the victim, not the master, of my own\nthoughts.\n\nIt was very evident that we were being hurried upward upon the crest\nof a wave of eruption; beneath our raft were boiling waters, and\nunder these the more sluggish lava was working its way up in a heated\nmass, together with shoals of fragments of rock which, when they\narrived at the crater, would be dispersed in all directions high and\nlow. We were imprisoned in the shaft or chimney of some volcano.\nThere was no room to doubt of that.\n\nBut this time, instead of Sn\u00e6fell, an extinct volcano, we were inside\none in full activity. I wondered, therefore, where could this\nmountain be, and in what part of the world we were to be shot out.\n\nI made no doubt but that it would be in some northern region. Before\nits disorders set in, the needle had never deviated from that\ndirection. From Cape Saknussemm we had been carried due north for\nhundreds of leagues. Were we under Iceland again? Were we destined to\nbe thrown up out of Hecla, or by which of the seven other fiery\ncraters in that island? Within a radius of five hundred leagues to\nthe west I remembered under this parallel of latitude only the\nimperfectly known volcanoes of the north-east coast of America. To\nthe east there was only one in the 80th degree of north latitude, the\nEsk in Jan Mayen Island, not far from Spitzbergen! Certainly there\nwas no lack of craters, and there were some capacious enough to throw\nout a whole army! But I wanted to know which of them was to serve us\nfor an exit from the inner world.\n\nTowards morning the ascending movement became accelerated. If the\nheat increased, instead of diminishing, as we approached nearer to\nthe surface of the globe, this effect was due to local causes alone,\nand those volcanic. The manner of our locomotion left no doubt in my\nmind. An enormous force, a force of hundreds of atmospheres,\ngenerated by the extreme pressure of confined vapours, was driving us\nirresistibly forward. But to what numberless dangers it exposed us!\n\nSoon lurid lights began to penetrate the vertical gallery which\nwidened as we went up. Right and left I could see deep channels, like\nhuge tunnels, out of which escaped dense volumes of smoke; tongues of\nfire lapped the walls, which crackled and sputtered under the intense\nheat.\n\n\"See, see, my uncle!\" I cried.\n\n\"Well, those are only sulphureous flames and vapours, which one must\nexpect to see in an eruption. They are quite natural.\"\n\n\"But suppose they should wrap us round.\"\n\n\"But they won't wrap us round.\"\n\n\"But we shall be stifled.\"\n\n\"We shall not be stifled at all. The gallery is widening, and if it\nbecomes necessary, we shall abandon the raft, and creep into a\ncrevice.\"\n\n\"But the water--the rising water?\"\n\n\"There is no more water, Axel; only a lava paste, which is bearing us\nup on its surface to the top of the crater.\"\n\nThe liquid column had indeed disappeared, to give place to dense and\nstill boiling eruptive matter of all kinds. The temperature was\nbecoming unbearable. A thermometer exposed to this atmosphere would\nhave marked 150\u00b0. The perspiration streamed from my body. But for the\nrapidity of our ascent we should have been suffocated.\n\nBut the Professor gave up his idea of abandoning the raft, and it was\nwell he did. However roughly joined together, those planks afforded\nus a firmer support than we could have found anywhere else.\n\nAbout eight in the morning a new incident occurred. The upward\nmovement ceased. The raft lay motionless.\n\n\"What is this?\" I asked, shaken by this sudden stoppage as if by a\nshock.\n\n\"It is a halt,\" replied my uncle.\n\n\"Is the eruption checked?\" I asked.\n\n\"I hope not.\"\n\nI rose, and tried to look around me. Perhaps the raft itself, stopped\nin its course by a projection, was staying the volcanic torrent. If\nthis were the case we should have to release it as soon as possible.\n\nBut it was not so. The blast of ashes, scorix, and rubbish had ceased\nto rise.\n\n\"Has the eruption stopped?\" I cried.\n\n\"Ah!\" said my uncle between his clenched teeth, \"you are afraid. But\ndon't alarm yourself--this lull cannot last long. It has lasted now\nfive minutes, and in a short time we shall resume our journey to the\nmouth of the crater.\"\n\nAs he spoke, the Professor continued to consult his chronometer, and\nhe was again right in his prognostications. The raft was soon hurried\nand driven forward with a rapid but irregular movement, which lasted\nabout ten minutes, and then stopped again.\n\n\"Very good,\" said my uncle; \"in ten minutes more we shall be off\nagain, for our present business lies with an intermittent volcano. It\ngives us time now and then to take breath.\"\n\nThis was perfectly true. When the ten minutes were over we started\noff again with renewed and increased speed. We were obliged to lay\nfast hold of the planks of the raft, not to be thrown off. Then again\nthe paroxysm was over.\n\nI have since reflected upon this singular phenomenon without being\nable to explain it. At any rate it was clear that we were not in the\nmain shaft of the volcano, but in a lateral gallery where there were\nfelt recurrent tunes of reaction.\n\nHow often this operation was repeated I cannot say. All I know is,\nthat at each fresh impulse we were hurled forward with a greatly\nincreased force, and we seemed as if we were mere projectiles. During\nthe short halts we were stifled with the heat; whilst we were being\nprojected forward the hot air almost stopped my breath. I thought for\na moment how delightful it would be to find myself carried suddenly\ninto the arctic regions, with a cold 30\u00b0 below the freezing point. My\noverheated brain conjured up visions of white plains of cool snow,\nwhere I might roll and allay my feverish heat. Little by little my\nbrain, weakened by so many constantly repeated shocks, seemed to be\ngiving way altogether. But for the strong arm of Hans I should more\nthan once have had my head broken against the granite roof of our\nburning dungeon.\n\nI have therefore no exact recollection of what took place during the\nfollowing hours. I have a confused impression left of continuous\nexplosions, loud detonations, a general shaking of the rocks all\naround us, and of a spinning movement with which our raft was once\nwhirled helplessly round. It rocked upon the lava torrent, amidst a\ndense fall of ashes. Snorting flames darted their fiery tongues at\nus. There were wild, fierce puffs of stormy wind from below,\nresembling the blasts of vast iron furnaces blowing all at one time;\nand I caught a glimpse of the figure of Hans lighted up by the fire;\nand all the feeling I had left was just what I imagine must be the\nfeeling of an unhappy criminal doomed to be blown away alive from the\nmouth of a cannon, just before the trigger is pulled, and the flying\nlimbs and rags of flesh and skin fill the quivering air and spatter\nthe blood-stained ground.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIV.\n\nSUNNY LANDS IN THE BLUE MEDITERRANEAN\n\n\nWhen I opened my eyes again I felt myself grasped by the belt with\nthe strong hand of our guide. With the other arm he supported my\nuncle. I was not seriously hurt, but I was shaken and bruised and\nbattered all over. I found myself lying on the sloping side of a\nmountain only two yards from a gaping gulf, which would have\nswallowed me up had I leaned at all that way. Hans had saved me from\ndeath whilst I lay rolling on the edge of the crater.\n\n\"Where are we?\" asked my uncle irascibly, as if he felt much injured\nby being landed upon the earth again.\n\nThe hunter shook his head in token of complete ignorance.\n\n\"Is it Iceland?\" I asked.\n\n\"_Nej,_\" replied Hans.\n\n\"What! Not Iceland?\" cried the Professor.\n\n\"Hans must be mistaken,\" I said, raising myself up.\n\nThis was our final surprise after all the astonishing events of our\nwonderful journey. I expected to see a white cone covered with the\neternal snow of ages rising from the midst of the barren deserts of\nthe icy north, faintly lighted with the pale rays of the arctic sun,\nfar away in the highest latitudes known; but contrary to all our\nexpectations, my uncle, the Icelander, and myself were sitting\nhalf-way down a mountain baked under the burning rays of a southern\nsun, which was blistering us with the heat, and blinding us with the\nfierce light of his nearly vertical rays.\n\nI could not believe my own eyes; but the heated air and the sensation\nof burning left me no room for doubt. We had come out of the crater\nhalf naked, and the radiant orb to which we had been strangers for\ntwo months was lavishing upon us out of his blazing splendours more\nof his light and heat than we were able to receive with comfort.\n\nWhen my eyes had become accustomed to the bright light to which they\nhad been so long strangers, I began to use them to set my imagination\nright. At least I would have it to be Spitzbergen, and I was in no\nhumour to give up this notion.\n\nThe Professor was the first to speak, and said:\n\n\"Well, this is not much like Iceland.\"\n\n\"But is it Jan Mayen?\" I asked.\n\n\"Nor that either,\" he answered. \"This is no northern mountain; here\nare no granite peaks capped with snow. Look, Axel, look!\"\n\nAbove our heads, at a height of five hundred feet or more, we saw the\ncrater of a volcano, through which, at intervals of fifteen minutes\nor so, there issued with loud explosions lofty columns of fire,\nmingled with pumice stones, ashes, and flowing lava. I could feel the\nheaving of the mountain, which seemed to breathe like a huge whale,\nand puff out fire and wind from its vast blowholes. Beneath, down a\npretty steep declivity, ran streams of lava for eight or nine hundred\nfeet, giving the mountain a height of about 1,300 or 1,400 feet. But\nthe base of the mountain was hidden in a perfect bower of rich\nverdure, amongst which I was able to distinguish the olive, the fig,\nand vines, covered with their luscious purple bunches.\n\nI was forced to confess that there was nothing arctic here.\n\nWhen the eye passed beyond these green surroundings it rested on a\nwide, blue expanse of sea or lake, which appeared to enclose this\nenchanting island, within a compass of only a few leagues. Eastward\nlay a pretty little white seaport town or village, with a few houses\nscattered around it, and in the harbour of which a few vessels of\npeculiar rig were gently swayed by the softly swelling waves. Beyond\nit, groups of islets rose from the smooth, blue waters, but in such\nnumbers that they seemed to dot the sea like a shoal. To the west\ndistant coasts lined the dim horizon, on some rose blue mountains of\nsmooth, undulating forms; on a more distant coast arose a prodigious\ncone crowned on its summit with a snowy plume of white cloud. To the\nnorthward lay spread a vast sheet of water, sparkling and dancing\nunder the hot, bright rays, the uniformity broken here and there by\nthe topmast of a gallant ship appearing above the horizon, or a\nswelling sail moving slowly before the wind.\n\nThis unforeseen spectacle was most charming to eyes long used to\nunderground darkness.\n\n\"Where are we? Where are we?\" I asked faintly.\n\nHans closed his eyes with lazy indifference. What did it matter to\nhim? My uncle looked round with dumb surprise.\n\n\"Well, whatever mountain this may be,\" he said at last, \"it is very\nhot here. The explosions are going on still, and I don't think it\nwould look well to have come out by an eruption, and then to get our\nheads broken by bits of falling rock. Let us get down. Then we shall\nknow better what we are about. Besides, I am starving, and parching\nwith thirst.\"\n\nDecidedly the Professor was not given to contemplation. For my part,\nI could for another hour or two have forgotten my hunger and my\nfatigue to enjoy the lovely scene before me; but I had to follow my\ncompanions.\n\nThe slope of the volcano was in many places of great steepness. We\nslid down screes of ashes, carefully avoiding the lava streams which\nglided sluggishly by us like fiery serpents. As we went I chattered\nand asked all sorts of questions as to our whereabouts, for I was too\nmuch excited not to talk a great deal.\n\n\"We are in Asia,\" I cried, \"on the coasts of India, in the Malay\nIslands, or in Oceania. We have passed through half the globe, and\ncome out nearly at the antipodes.\"\n\n\"But the compass?\" said my uncle.\n\n\"Ay, the compass!\" I said, greatly puzzled. \"According to the compass\nwe have gone northward.\"\n\n\"Has it lied?\"\n\n\"Surely not. Could it lie?\"\n\n\"Unless, indeed, this is the North Pole!\"\n\n\"Oh, no, it is not the Pole; but--\"\n\nWell, here was something that baffled us completely. I could not tell\nwhat to say.\n\nBut now we were coming into that delightful greenery, and I was\nsuffering greatly from hunger and thirst. Happily, after two hours'\nwalking, a charming country lay open before us, covered with olive\ntrees, pomegranate trees, and delicious vines, all of which seemed to\nbelong to anybody who pleased to claim them. Besides, in our state of\ndestitution and famine we were not likely to be particular. Oh, the\ninexpressible pleasure of pressing those cool, sweet fruits to our\nlips, and eating grapes by mouthfuls off the rich, full bunches! Not\nfar off, in the grass, under the delicious shade of the trees, I\ndiscovered a spring of fresh, cool water, in which we luxuriously\nbathed our faces, hands, and feet.\n\nWhilst we were thus enjoying the sweets of repose a child appeared\nout of a grove of olive trees.\n\n\"Ah!\" I cried, \"here is an inhabitant of this happy land!\"\n\nIt was but a poor boy, miserably ill-clad, a sufferer from poverty,\nand our aspect seemed to alarm him a great deal; in fact, only half\nclothed, with ragged hair and beards, we were a suspicious-looking\nparty; and if the people of the country knew anything about thieves,\nwe were very likely to frighten them.\n\nJust as the poor little wretch was going to take to his heels, Hans\ncaught hold of him, and brought him to us, kicking and struggling.\n\nMy uncle began to encourage him as well as he could, and said to him\nin good German:\n\n\"_Was heiszt diesen Berg, mein Knablein? Sage mir geschwind!_\"\n\n(\"What is this mountain called, my little friend?\")\n\nThe child made no answer.\n\n\"Very well,\" said my uncle. \"I infer that we are not in Germany.\"\n\nHe put the same question in English.\n\nWe got no forwarder. I was a good deal puzzled.\n\n\"Is the child dumb?\" cried the Professor, who, proud of his knowledge\nof many languages, now tried French: \"_Comment appellet-on cette\nmontagne, mon enfant?_\"\n\nSilence still.\n\n\"Now let us try Italian,\" said my uncle; and he said:\n\n\"_Dove noi siamo?_\"\n\n\"Yes, where are we?\" I impatiently repeated.\n\nBut there was no answer still.\n\n\"Will you speak when you are told?\" exclaimed my uncle, shaking the\nurchin by the ears. \"_Come si noma questa isola?_\"\n\n\"STROMBOLI,\" replied the little herdboy, slipping out of Hans' hands,\nand scudding into the plain across the olive trees.\n\nWe were hardly thinking of that. Stromboli! What an effect this\nunexpected name produced upon my mind! We were in the midst of the\nMediterranean Sea, on an island of the \u00c6olian archipelago, in the\nancient Strongyle, where \u00c6olus kept the winds and the storms chained\nup, to be let loose at his will. And those distant blue mountains in\nthe east were the mountains of Calabria. And that threatening volcano\nfar away in the south was the fierce Etna.\n\n\"Stromboli, Stromboli!\" I repeated.\n\nMy uncle kept time to my exclamations with hands and feet, as well as\nwith words. We seemed to be chanting in chorus!\n\nWhat a journey we had accomplished! How marvellous! Having entered by\none volcano, we had issued out of another more than two thousand\nmiles from Sn\u00e6fell and from that barren, far-away Iceland! The\nstrange chances of our expedition had carried us into the heart of\nthe fairest region in the world. We had exchanged the bleak regions\nof perpetual snow and of impenetrable barriers of ice for those of\nbrightness and 'the rich hues of all glorious things.' We had left\nover our heads the murky sky and cold fogs of the frigid zone to\nrevel under the azure sky of Italy!\n\nAfter our delicious repast of fruits and cold, clear water we set off\nagain to reach the port of Stromboli. It would not have been wise to\ntell how we came there. The superstitious Italians would have set us\ndown for fire-devils vomited out of hell; so we presented ourselves\nin the humble guise of shipwrecked mariners. It was not so glorious,\nbut it was safer.\n\nOn my way I could hear my uncle murmuring: \"But the compass! that\ncompass! It pointed due north. How are we to explain that fact?\"\n\n\"My opinion is,\" I replied disdainfully, \"that it is best not to\nexplain it. That is the easiest way to shelve the difficulty.\"\n\n\"Indeed, sir! The occupant of a professorial chair at the Johann\u00e6um\nunable to explain the reason of a cosmical phenomenon! Why, it would\nbe simply disgraceful!\"\n\nAnd as he spoke, my uncle, half undressed, in rags, a perfect\nscarecrow, with his leathern belt around him, settling his spectacles\nupon his nose and looking learned and imposing, was himself again,\nthe terrible German professor of mineralogy.\n\nOne hour after we had left the grove of olives, we arrived at the\nlittle port of San Vicenzo, where Hans claimed his thirteen week's\nwages, which was counted out to him with a hearty shaking of hands\nall round.\n\nAt that moment, if he did not share our natural emotion, at least his\ncountenance expanded in a manner very unusual with him, and while\nwith the ends of his fingers he lightly pressed our hands, I believe\nhe smiled.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLV.\n\nALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL\n\n\nSuch is the conclusion of a history which I cannot expect everybody\nto believe, for some people will believe nothing against the\ntestimony of their own experience. However, I am indifferent to their\nincredulity, and they may believe as much or as little as they please.\n\nThe Stromboliotes received us kindly as shipwrecked mariners. They\ngave us food and clothing. After waiting forty-eight hours, on the 31\nst of August, a small craft took us to Messina, where a few days'\nrest completely removed the effect of our fatigues.\n\nOn Friday, September the 4th, we embarked on the steamer Volturno,\nemployed by the French Messageries Imperiales, and in three days more\nwe were at Marseilles, having no care on our minds except that\nabominable deceitful compass, which we had mislaid somewhere and\ncould not now examine; but its inexplicable behaviour exercised my\nmind fearfully. On the 9th of September, in the evening, we arrived\nat Hamburg.\n\nI cannot describe to you the astonishment of Martha or the joy of\nGr\u00e4uben.\n\n\"Now you are a hero, Axel,\" said to me my blushing _fianc\u00e9e,_ my\nbetrothed, \"you will not leave me again!\"\n\nI looked tenderly upon her, and she smiled through her tears.\n\nHow can I describe the extraordinary sensation produced by the return\nof Professor Liedenbrock? Thanks to Martha's ineradicable tattling,\nthe news that the Professor had gone to discover a way to the centre\nof the earth had spread over the whole civilised world. People\nrefused to believe it, and when they saw him they would not believe\nhim any the more. Still, the appearance of Hans, and sundry pieces of\nintelligence derived from Iceland, tended to shake the confidence of\nthe unbelievers.\n\nThen my uncle became a great man, and I was now the nephew of a great\nman--which is not a privilege to be despised.\n\nHamburg gave a grand fete in our honour. A public audience was given\nto the Professor at the Johann\u00e6um, at which he told all about our\nexpedition, with only one omission, the unexplained and inexplicable\nbehaviour of our compass. On the same day, with much state, he\ndeposited in the archives of the city the now famous document of\nSaknussemm, and expressed his regret that circumstances over which he\nhad no control had prevented him from following to the very centre of\nthe earth the track of the learned Icelander. He was modest\nnotwithstanding his glory, and he was all the more famous for his\nhumility.\n\nSo much honour could not but excite envy. There were those who envied\nhim his fame; and as his theories, resting upon known facts, were in\nopposition to the systems of science upon the question of the central\nfire, he sustained with his pen and by his voice remarkable\ndiscussions with the learned of every country.\n\nFor my part I cannot agree with his theory of gradual cooling: in\nspite of what I have seen and felt, I believe, and always shall\nbelieve, in the central heat. But I admit that certain circumstances\nnot yet sufficiently understood may tend to modify in places the\naction of natural phenomena.\n\nWhile these questions were being debated with great animation, my\nuncle met with a real sorrow. Our faithful Hans, in spite of our\nentreaties, had left Hamburg; the man to whom we owed all our success\nand our lives too would not suffer us to reward him as we could have\nwished. He was seized with the mal de pays, a complaint for which we\nhave not even a name in English.\n\n\"_Farval,_\" said he one day; and with that simple word he left us and\nsailed for Rejkiavik, which he reached in safety.\n\nWe were strongly attached to our brave eider-down hunter; though far\naway in the remotest north, he will never be forgotten by those whose\nlives he protected, and certainly I shall not fail to endeavour to\nsee him once more before I die.\n\nTo conclude, I have to add that this 'Journey into the Interior of\nthe Earth' created a wonderful sensation in the world. It was\ntranslated into all civilised languages. The leading newspapers\nextracted the most interesting passages, which were commented upon,\npicked to pieces, discussed, attacked, and defended with equal\nenthusiasm and determination, both by believers and sceptics. Rare\nprivilege! my uncle enjoyed during his lifetime the glory he had\ndeservedly won; and he may even boast the distinguished honour of an\noffer from Mr. Barnum, to exhibit him on most advantageous terms in\nall the principal cities in the United States!\n\nBut there was one 'dead fly' amidst all this glory and honour; one\nfact, one incident, of the journey remained a mystery. Now to a man\neminent for his learning, an unexplained phenomenon is an unbearable\nhardship. Well! it was yet reserved for my uncle to be completely\nhappy.\n\nOne day, while arranging a collection of minerals in his cabinet, I\nnoticed in a corner this unhappy compass, which we had long lost\nsight of; I opened it, and began to watch it.\n\nIt had been in that corner for six months, little mindful of the\ntrouble it was giving.\n\nSuddenly, to my intense astonishment, I noticed a strange fact, and I\nuttered a cry of surprise.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" my uncle asked.\n\n\"That compass!\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"See, its poles are reversed!\"\n\n\"Reversed?\"\n\n\"Yes, they point the wrong way.\"\n\nMy uncle looked, he compared, and the house shook with his triumphant\nleap of exultation.\n\nA light broke in upon his spirit and mine.\n\n\"See there,\" he cried, as soon as he was able to speak. \"After our\narrival at Cape Saknussemm the north pole of the needle of this\nconfounded compass began to point south instead of north.\"\n\n\"Evidently!\"\n\n\"Here, then, is the explanation of our mistake. But what phenomenon\ncould have caused this reversal of the poles?\"\n\n\"The reason is evident, uncle.\"\n\n\"Tell me, then, Axel.\"\n\n\"During the electric storm on the Liedenbrock sea, that ball of fire,\nwhich magnetised all the iron on board, reversed the poles of our\nmagnet!\"\n\n\"Aha! aha!\" shouted the Professor with a loud laugh. \"So it was just\nan electric joke!\"\n\nFrom that day forth the Professor was the most glorious of savants,\nand I was the happiest of men; for my pretty Virlandaise, resigning\nher place as ward, took her position in the old house on the\nK\u00f6nigstrasse in the double capacity of niece to my uncle and wife to\na certain happy youth. What is the need of adding that the\nillustrious Otto Liedenbrock, corresponding member of all the\nscientific, geographical, and mineralogical societies of all the\ncivilised world, was now her uncle and mine?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of A Journey to the Interior of the Earth, by\nJules Verne\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK A JOURNEY TO THE INTERIOR ***\n\n***** This file should be named 3748-8.txt or 3748-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/7/4/3748/\n\nProduced by Norman M.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
