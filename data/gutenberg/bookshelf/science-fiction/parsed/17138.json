I've\nreleased this story, along with five others, under the terms of a Creative\nCommons license that gives you, the reader, a bunch of rights that copyright\nnormally reserves for me, the creator.\n\nI recently did the same thing with the entire text of my novel, \"Down and Out in\nthe Magic Kingdom\" (http://craphound.com/down), and it was an unmitigated\nsuccess. Hundreds of thousands of people downloaded the book -- good news -- and\nthousands of people bought the book -- also good news. It turns out that, as\nnear as anyone can tell, distributing free electronic versions of books is a\ngreat way to sell more of the paper editions, while simultaneously getting the\nbook into the hands of readers who would otherwise not be exposed to my work.\n\nI still don't know how it is artists will earn a living in the age of the\nInternet, but I remain convinced that the way to find out is to do basic\nscience: that is, to do stuff and observe the outcome. That's what I'm doing\nhere. The thing to remember is that the very *worst* thing you can do to me as\nan artist is to not read my work -- to let it languish in obscurity and\ndisappear from posterity. Most of the fiction I grew up on is out-of-print, and\nthis is doubly true for the short stories. Losing a couple bucks to people who\nwould have bought the book save for the availability of the free electronic text\nis no big deal, at least when compared to the horror that is being irrelevant\nand unread. And luckily for me, it appears that giving away the text for free\ngets me more paying customers than it loses me.\n\nYou can find the canonical version of this file at\nhttp://craphound.com/place/download.php\n\nIf you'd like to convert this file to some other format and distribute it, you\nhave my permission, provided that:\n\n* You don't charge money for the distribution\n\n* You keep the entire text intact, including this notice, the license below, and\nthe metadata at the end of the file\n\n* You don't use a file-format that has \"DRM\" or \"copy-protection\" or any other\nform of use-restriction turned on\n\nIf you'd like, you can advertise the existence of your edition by posting a link\nto it at http://craphound.com/place/000016.php\n\n--\n\nHere's a summary of the license:\n\n\thttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd-nc/1.0\n\n\tAttribution.

When I was sixteen, and The Amazing Robotron told me he\nneeded to go away for a while, but he'd be back, I did everything I could to\nmake him guilty. Now it's me, on a world far from home, and a pack of snot-nosed\njellyfish kids have so twisted my psyche that they're all I can think of when I\ndebark the shuttle at Aristide Interplanetary, just outside my dirty ole\nToronto.\n\nThe customs officer isn't even human, so it feels like just another R&R, another\nhalting conversation carried on in ugly trade-speak, another bewilderment of\nqueues and luggage carousels. Outside: another spaceport, surrounded by the\nvariegated hostels for the variegated tourists, and bipeds are in bare majority.\n\nI can think of it like that.\n\nI can think of it as another spaceport.\n\nI can think of it like another trip.\n\nThe thing he can't think of it is, is a homecoming. That's too hard for this\nweak vessel.\n\nHe's very weak.\n\n#\n\nLook at him. He's eleven, and it's the tencennial of the Ascension of his\nhomeworld -- dirty blue ball, so unworthy, yet -- inducted into the Galactic\nfraternity and the infinite compassion of the bugouts.\n\nThe foam, which had been confined to just the newer, Process-enclaves before the\nAscension, has spread, as has the cult of the Process For Lasting Happiness.\nProcess is, after all, why the dirty blue ball was judged and found barely\nadequate for membership. Toronto, which had seen half its inhabitants emigrate\non open-ended tours of the wondrous worlds of the bugout domain, is full again.\nBursting. The whole damn planet is accreting a layer of off-world tourists.\n\nIt's a time of plenty. Plenty of cheap food and plenty of cheap foam structures,\nbuilt as needed, then dissolved and washed away when the need disappears. Plenty\nof healthcare and education. Plenty of toys and distractions and beautiful,\nhaunting bugout art. Plenty, in fact, of everything, except space.\n\nHe lived in a building that is so tall, its top floors are perpetually damp with\nclouds. There's a nice name for this building, inscribed on a much-abused foam\nsculpture in the central courtyard. No one uses the nice name. They call it by\nthe name that the tabloids use, that the inhabitants use, that everyone but the\noff-world counselors use. They call it the bat-house.\n\nBats in the belfry. Batty. Batshit.\n\nI hated it when they moved us into the bat-house. My parents gamely tried to\nexplain why we were going, but they never understood, no more than any human\ncould. The bugouts had a test, a scifi helmet you wore, and it told you whether\nyou were normal, or batty. Some of our neighbors were clearly batshit: the woman\nwho screamed all the time, about the bugs and the little niggers crawling over\nher flesh; the couple who ate dogturds off the foam sidewalk with lip-smacking\nrelish; the guy who thought he was Nicola Tesla.\n\nI don't want to talk about him right now.\n\nHis parents' flaw -- whatever it was -- was too subtle to detect without the\nscifi helmet. They never knew for sure what it was. Many of the bats were in the\nsame belfry: part of the bugouts' arrogant compassion held that a couple never\nknew which one of them was defective, so his family never knew if it was his\nnervous, shy mother, or his loud, opinionated father who had doomed them to the\nquarantine.\n\nHis father told him, in an impromptu ceremony before he slid his keycard into\nthe lock on their new apt in the belfry: \"Chet, whatever they say, there's\nnothing wrong with us. They have no right to put us here.\" He knelt to look the\nskinny ten-year-old right in the eye. \"Don't worry, kiddo. It's not for long --\nwe'll get this thing sorted out yet.\" Then, in a rare moment of tenderness, one\nthat stood out in Chet's memory as the last of such, his father gathered him in\nhis arms, lifted him off his feet in a fierce hug. After a moment, his mother\njoined the hug, and Chet's face was buried in the spot where both of their\nshoulders met, smelling their smells. They still smelled like his parents then,\nlike his old house on the Beaches, and for a moment, he knew his father was\nright, that this couldn't possibly last.\n\nA tear rolled down his mother's cheek and dripped in his ear. He shook his\nshaggy hair like a dog and his parents laughed, and his father wiped away his\nmother's tear and they went into the apt, grinning and holding hands.\n\nOf course, they never left the belfry after that.\n\n#\n\nI can't remember what the last thing my mother said to me was. Do I remember her\ntucking me in and saying, \"Good night, sleep tight, don't let the bedbugs bite,\"\nor was that something I saw on a vid? Was it a nervous command to wipe my shoes\non the way in the door? Was her voice soft and sad, as it sometimes is in my\nmemories, or was it brittle and angry, the way she often seemed after she\nstopped talking, as she banged around the tiny, two-room apt?\n\nI can't remember.\n\nMy mother fell away from speech like a half-converted parishioner falling away\nfrom the faith: she stopped visiting the temple of verbiage in dribs and drabs,\nfirst missing the regular sermons -- the daily niceties of Good morning and Good\nnight and Be careful, Chet -- then neglecting the major holidays, the Watch\nout!s and the Ouch!s and the answers to direct questions.\n\nMy father and I never spoke of it, and I didn't mention it to the other wild\nkids in the vertical city with whom I spent my days getting in what passed for\ntrouble around the bat-house.\n\nI did mention it to my counselor, The Amazing Robotron, so-called for the metal\nexoskeleton he wore to support his fragile body in Earth's hard gravity. But he\ndidn't count, then.\n\n#\n\nThe reason that Chet can't pinpoint the moment his mother sealed her lips is\nbecause he was a self-absorbed little rodent in those days.\n\nNot a cute freckled hellion. A miserable little shit who played hide-and-seek\nwith the other miserable little shits in the bat-house, but played it violently,\nhide-and-seek-and-break-and-enter, hide-and-seek-and-smash-and-grab. The lot of\nthem are amorphous, indistinguishable from each other in his memory, all that\nremains of all those clever little brats is the lingering impression of loud,\nboasting voices and sharp little teeth.\n\nThe Amazing Robotron was a fool in little Chet's eyes, an easy-to-bullshit,\nineffectual lump whose company Chet had to endure for a mandatory hour every\nother day.\n\n\"Chet, you seem distr-acted to-day,\" The Amazing Robotron said in his artificial\nvoice.\n\n\"Yah. You know. Worried about, uh, the future.\" Distracted by Debbie Carr's\npurse, filched while she sat in the sixty-eighth floor courtyard, talking with\nher stupid girlie friends. Debbie was the first girl from the gang to get tits,\nand now she didn't want to hang out with them anymore, and her purse was stashed\nunderneath the base of a hollow planter outside The Amazing Robotron's apt, and\nmaybe he could sneak it out under his shirt and find a place to dump it and sort\nthrough its contents after the session.\n\n\"What is it about the fu-ture that wo-rries you?\" The Amazing Robotron was as\nunreadable as a pinball machine, something he resembled. Underneath, he was a\ncollection of whip-like tentacles with a knot of sensory organs in the middle.\n\n\"You know, like, the whole fricken thing. Like if I leave here when I'm\neighteen, will my folks be okay without me, and like that.\"\n\n\"Your pa-rents are able to take care of them-selves, Chet. You must con-cern\nyour-self with you, Chet. You should do something con-struct-tive with your\nwo-rry, such as de-ciding on a ca-reer that will ful-fill you when you leave the\nCen-ter.\" The Center was the short form for the long, nice name that no one ever\nused to describe the bat-house.\n\n\"I thought, like, maybe I could be, you know, a spaceship pilot or something.\"\n\n\"Then you must stu-dy math-e-mat-ics and phy-sics. If you like, Chet, I can\nre-quest ad-vanced in-struct-tion-al mat-e-rials for you.\"\n\n\"Sure, that'd be great. Thanks, Robotron.\"\n\n\"You are wel-come, Chet. I am glad to help. My own par-ent was in a Cen-ter on\nmy world, you know. I un-der-stand how you feel. There is still time re-main-ing\nin your ses-sion. What else would you like to dis-cuss?\"\n\n\"My mother doesn't talk anymore. Nothing. Why is that?\"\n\n\"Your mo-ther is. . . .\" The Amazing Robotron fumbled for a word, buried\nsomewhere deep in the hypnotic English lexicon baked into its brain. \"Your\nmo-ther has a prob-lem, and she needs your aff-ec-tion now more than e-ver.\nWhat-ev-er rea-son she has for her si-lence, it is not you. Your mo-ther and\nfa-ther love you, and dream of the day when you leave here and make your own way\nthrough the gal-ax-y.\"\n\nOf course his parents loved him, he supposed, in an abstract kind of way. His\nmother, who hadn't worn anything but a bathrobe in months, whose face he\ncouldn't picture behind his eyes but whose bathrobe he could visualize in its\nevery rip and stain and fray. His father, who seemed to have forgotten how to\ngroom himself, who spent his loud days in one of the bat-house's workshops,\ndrinking beer with his buddies while they played with the arc welders. His\nparents loved him, he knew that.\n\n\"OK, right, thanks. I've gotta blow, 'K?\"\n\n\"All-right. I will see you on Thurs-day, then?\"\n\nBut Chet was already out the door, digging Debbie Carr's purse from under the\nplanter, then running, doubled over the bulge it made in his shirt, hunting for\na private space in the anthill.\n\n#\n\nThe entire north face of the bat-house was eyeless, a blind, windowless expanse\nof foam that seemed to curve as it approached infinity.\n\nSome said it was an architectural error, others said it was part of the\nbat-house's heating scheme. Up in nosebleed country, on the 120th level, it was\nalmost empty: sparsely populated by the very battiest bats, though as more and\nmore humans were found batty, they pushed inexorably upwards.\n\nChet rode the lift to the 125th floor and walked casually to the end of the\nhallway. At this height, the hallways were bare foam, without the long-wear\ncarpet and fake plants that adorned the low-altitude territories. He walked as\ncalmly as he could to the very end of the northern hall, then hunkered down in\nthe corner and spilled the purse.\n\nShit, but Debbie Carr was going girlie. The pile was all tampons and makeup and,\nugh, a spare bra. A spare bra! I chuckled, and kept sorting. There were three\npennies, enough to buy six chocolate bars in the black-market tuck-shop on the\n75th floor. A clever little pair of folding scissors, their blades razor-sharp.\nI was using them to slit the lining of the purse when the door to 12525 opened,\nand the guy who thought he was Nicola Tesla emerged.\n\nMy palms slicked with guilty sweat, and the pile of Debbie's crap, set against\nthe featureless foam corridor, seemed to scream its presence. I spun around,\nworking my body into the corner, and held the little scissors like a dagger in\nmy fist.\n\nThe guy who thought he was Nicola Tesla was clearly batty. He was wearing\nboxer-shorts and a tailcoat and had a halo of wild, greasy hair and a long,\ntangled beard, but even if he'd been wearing a suit and tie and had a trip to\nthe barber's, I'd have known he was batty the minute I laid eyes on him. He\ndidn't walk, he shambled, like he'd spent a long, long time on meds. His eyes,\nset in deep black pits of sleeplessness, were ferociously crazy.\n\nHe turned to stare at me.\n\n\"Hello, sonny. Do you like to swim?\"\n\nI stood in my corner, mute, trapped.\n\n\"I have an ocean in my apt. Maybe you'd like to try it? I used to love to swim\nin the ocean when I was a boy.\"\n\nMy feet moved without my willing them. An ocean in his apt? My feet wanted to\nknow about this.\n\nI entered his apt, and even my feet were too surprised to go on.\n\nHe had the biggest apt I'd ever seen. It spanned three quarters of the length of\nthe bat-house, and was five storeys high. The spots where he'd dissolved the\nfoam walls away with solvent were rough and uneven, and rings of foam encircled\neach of the missing storeys above. I couldn't imagine getting that much solvent:\nit was more tightly controlled than plutonium, the subject of countless\naction-adventure vids.\n\nAt one end of the apt stood a collection of tall, spiny apparatus, humming with\nelectricity and sparking. They were remarkable, but their impact was lost in\nwhat lay at the other end.\n\nThe guy who thought he was Nicola Tesla had an ocean in his apt. It was a clear\naquarium tank, fifteen meters long and nearly seventeen high, and eight meters\ndeep. It was dominated by a massive, baroque coral reef, like a melting castle\nwith misshapen brains growing out of it.\n\nSchools of fish -- bright as jellybeans -- darted through the ocean's depths,\nswimming in and out of the softly waving plants. A thousand neon tetra, a flock\nof living quicksilver sewing needles, turned 90 degrees in perfect unison, then\ndid it again, and again, and again, describing a neat, angular box in the water.\n\n\"Isn't it beautiful? I'm using it in one of my experiments, but I also find it\nvery _calming_.\"\n\n#\n\nI hail a pedicab and the kids back on my adopted homeworld, with their accusing,\nangry words and stares vanish from my mind. The cabbie is about nineteen and\nmuscular as hell, legs like treetrunks, clipped into the pedals. A flywheel\nspins between him and me, and his brakes store his momentum up in it every time\nhe slows. On the two-hour ride into downtown Toronto, he never once comes to a\nfull stop.\n\nI've booked a room at the Royal York. I can afford it -- the stipend I receive\nfor the counseling work has been slowly accumulating in my bank account.\n\nDowntown is all foam now, and \"historical\" shops selling authentic Earth\ncrapola: reproductions of old newspapers, reproductions of old electronics,\nreproductions of old clothes and old food and other discarded cultural detritus.\nI see tall, clacking insect-creatures with walkman headphones across their\nstomachs. I see squat, rocky creatures smearing pizza slices onto their\ndigestive membranes. I see soft, slithering creatures with Toronto Blue Jays\nbaseball hats suspended in their jelly.\n\nThe humans I see are dressed in unisex coveralls, with discreet comms on their\nwrists or collars, and they don't seem to notice that their city is become a\nbestiary.\n\nThe cabby isn't even out of breath when we pull up at the Royal York, which,\nthankfully, is still clothed in its ancient dressed stone. We point our comms at\neach other and I squirt some money at him, adding a generous tip. His face,\nwhich had been wildly animated while he dodged the traffic on the long ride is a\nstony mask now, as though when at rest he entered a semiconscious sleep mode.\n\nThe doorman is dressed in what may or may not be historically accurate costume,\nthough what period it is meant to represent is anyone's guess. He carries my bag\nto the check-in and I squirt more money at him. He wishes that I have a nice\nstay in Toronto, and I wish it, too.\n\nAt the check-in, I squirt my ID and still more money at the efficient young\nwoman in a smart blazer, and another babu in period costume -- those shoes look\npainful -- carries my bag to the lift and presses the button.\n\nWe wait in strained silence and the lift makes its achingly slow progress\ntowards us. There are no elevators on the planet I live on now -- the wild\ngravity and wilder windstorms don't permit buildings of more than one story --\nbut even if there were, they wouldn't be like this lift, like a human lift, like\none of the fifty that ran the vertical length of the bat-house.\n\nI nearly choke as we enter that lift. It has the smell of a million transient\nguests, aftershaves and perfumes and pheromones, and the stale recirc air I\nremember so well. I stifle the choke into my fist, fake a cough, and feel a\nself-consciousness I didn't know I had.\n\nI'm worried that the babu knows that I grew up in the bat-house.\n\nNow I can't make eye-contact with him. Now I can't seem to stand naturally,\ncan't figure out where a not-crazy puts his hands and where a not-crazy puts his\neyes. Little Chet and his mates liked to terrorize people in the lifts, play\n\"who farted\" and \"I'm gonna puke\" and \"I have to pee\" in loud sing-songs, just\nto watch the other bats squirm.\n\nThe guy who thought he was Nicola Tesla thought that these games were unfunny,\nunsophisticated and unappetizing and little Chet stopped playing them.\n\nI squirt extra money at the babu, after he opens my windows and shows me the\nshitter and the vid's remote.\n\nI unpack mechanically, my meager bag yielding more-meager clothes. I'd thought\nI'd buy more after earthfall, since the spaceports' version of human apparel\nwasn't, very. I realize that I'm wearing the same clothes I left Earth in, lo\nthose years before. They're hardly the worse for wear -- when I'm in my\nexoskeleton on my new planet, I don't bother with clothes.\n\n#\n\nThe ocean seemed too fragile to be real. All that caged water, held behind a\nflimsy-seeming sheet of clear foam, the corners joined with strips of thick\ngasket-rubber. Standing there at its base, Chet was terrified that it would\nburst and drown him -- he actually felt the push of water, the horrid, dying\nwriggles of the fish as they were washed over his body.\n\n\"Say there, son. Hello?\"\n\nChet looked up. Nicola Tesla's hair was standing on end, comically. He realized\nthat his own long, shaggy hair was doing the same. The whole room felt electric.\n\n\"Are you all right?\" He had a trace of an accent, like the hint of garlic in a\nsalad dressing, an odd way of stepping on his vowels.\n\n\"Yeh, yeh, fine. I'm fine,\" Chet said.\n\n\"I am pleased to hear that. What is your name, son?\"\n\n\"Chet. Affeltranger.\"\n\n\"I'm pleased to meet you. My name is Gaylord Ballozos, though that's not who I\nam. You see, I'm the channel for Nicola Tesla. Would you like to see a magic\ntrick?\"\n\nChet nodded. He wondered who Nicola Tesla was, and filed away the name Gaylord\nfor making fun of, later. In doing so, he began to normalize the experience, to\nstructure it as a story he could tell the other kids, after. The guy, the ocean,\nthe hair. Gaylord.\n\nA ball of lightning leapt from Tesla/Ballozos's fingertips and danced over their\nheads. It bounced around the room furiously, then stopped to hover in front of\nChet. His clothes stood away from his body, snapping as though caught in a\nwindstorm. Seen up close, the ball was an infinite pool of shifting electricity,\nlike an ocean of energy. Tentatively, he reached out to touch it, and Tesla\nshouted \"Don't!\" and the ball whipped up and away, spearing itself on the point\nof one of the towers on the opposite side of the room.\n\nIt vanished, leaving a tangy, sharp smell behind.\n\nThe story Chet had been telling in his mind disappeared with it. He stood,\nshocked speechless.\n\nThe guy who thought he was Nicola Tesla chuckled a little, then started to\nlaugh, actually doubling over and slapping his thighs.\n\n\"You can't _imagine_ how long I've waited to show that trick to someone! Thank\nyou, young Mr. Affeltranger! A million thanks to you, for your obvious\nappreciation.\"\n\nChet felt a giggle welling up in him, and he did laugh, and when his lips came\ntogether, a spark of static electricity leapt from their seam to his nose and\nmade him jump, and laugh all the harder.\n\nThe guy came forward and pumped his arm in a dry handshake. \"I can see that you\nand I are kindred spirits. You will have to come and visit again, very soon, and\nI will let you see more of my ocean, and maybe let you see 'Old Sparky,' too.\nThank you, thank you, thank you, for dropping in.\"\n\nAnd he ushered Chet out of his apt and closed the door, leaving him in the\nfeatureless hallway of the 125th storey.\n\n#\n\nI had never been as nervous as I was the following Thursday, when my regular\nappointment with The Amazing Robotron rolled around again. I hadn't spoken of\nthe guy who thought he was Nicola Tesla to any of my gang, and of course not to\nmy parents, but somehow, I felt like I might end up spilling to The Amazing\nRobotron.\n\nI don't know why I was worried. The guy hadn't asked me to keep it a secret,\nafter all, and I had never had any problem holding my tongue around The Amazing\nRobotron before.\n\n\"Hel-lo, Chet. How have you been?\"\n\n\"I've been OK.\"\n\n\"Have you been stud-y-ing math-e-mat-ics and phys-ics? I had the supp-le-ment-al\nmat-e-rials de-liv-er-ed to your apt yes-ter-day.\"\n\n\"No, I haven't. I don't think I wanna be a pilot no more. One of my buds tole me\nthat you end up all fugged up with time an' that, that you come home an' it's\nthe next century an' everyone you know is dead.\"\n\n\"That is one thing that hap-pens to some ex-plor-a-tor-y pilots, Chet. Have you\nthought a-bout any o-ther poss-i-bil-i-ties?\"\n\n\"Kinda. I guess.\" I tried not to think about the 125th story and the ocean. I\nwas thinking so hard, I stopped thinking about what I was saying to The Amazing\nRobotron. \"Maybe I could be a counselor, like, and help kids.\"\n\nThe Amazing Robotron turned into a pinball machine again, an unreadable and\nmotionless block. Silent for so long I thought he was gone, dead as a sardine\ninside his tin can. Then, he twitched both of his arms, like he was shivering.\nThen his robot-voice came out of the grille on his face. \"I think that you would\nbe a ve-ry good coun-sel-or, Chet.\"\n\n\"Yeh?\" I said. It was the first time that The Amazing Robotron had told me he\nthought I'd be good at anything. Hell, it was the first time he'd expressed\n_any_ opinion about anything I'd said.\n\n\"Yes, Chet. Be-ing a coun-sel-or is a ve-ry good way to help your-self\nun-der-stand what we have done to you by put-ting you in the Cen-ter.\"\n\nI couldn't speak. My Mom, before she fell silent, had often spoken about how\nunfair it was for me to be stuck here, because of something that she or my\nfather had done. But my father never seemed to notice me, and the teachers on\nthe vid made a point of not mentioning the bat-house -- like someone trying hard\nnot to notice a stutter or a wart, and you _knew_ that the best you could hope\nfor from them was pity.\n\n\"Be-ing a coun-sel-or is ve-ry hard, Chet. But coun-sel-ors sometimes get a\nspec-ial re-ward. Some-times, we get to help. Do you re-ally want to do this?\"\n\n\"Yeh. Yes. I mean, it sounds good. You get to travel, right?\"\n\nThe Amazing Robotron's idiot-lights rippled, something I came to recognize as a\nchuckle, later. \"Yes. Tra-vel is part of the job. I sug-gest that you start by\nex-am-in-ing your friends. See if you can fi-gure out why they do what they do.\"\n\nI've used this trick on my kids. What do I know about their psychology? But you\nget one, you convince it to explain the rest to you. It helps. Counselors are\nalways from another world -- by the time the first generation raised in a\nbat-house has grown old enough, there aren't any bats' children left to counsel\non their homeworld.\n\n#\n\nI take room-service, pizza and beer in an ice-bucket: pretentious, but better\nthan sharing a dining-room with the menagerie. Am I becoming a racist?\n\nNo, no. I just need to focus on things human, during this vacation.\n\nThe food is disappointing. It's been years since I lay awake at night, craving a\nslice and a brew and a normal gravity and a life away from the bats.\nNevertheless, the craving remained, buried, and resurfaced when I went over the\nroom-service menu. By the time the dumbwaiter in my room chimed, I was\npractically drooling.\n\nBut by the time I take my second bite, it's just pizza and a brew.\n\nI wonder if I will ever get to sleep, but when the time comes, my eyes close and\nif I dream, I don't remember it.\n\nI get up and dress and send up for eggs and real Atlantic salmon and brown toast\nand a pitcher of coffee, then find myself unable to eat any of it. I make a\nsandwich out of it and wrap it in napkins and stuff it into my day-pack along\nwith a water-bottle and some sun-block.\n\nIt's a long walk up to the bat-house, but I should make it by nightfall.\n\n#\n\nChet was up at 6h the next morning. His mom was already up, but she never slept\nthat he could tell. She was clattering around the kitchen in her housecoat,\nemptying the cupboards and then re-stacking their contents for the thousandth\ntime. She shot him a look of something between fear and affection as he pulled\non his shorts and a t-shirt, and he found himself hugging her waist. For a\nsecond, it felt like she softened into his embrace, like she was going to say\nsomething, like it was normal, and then she picked up a plate and rubbed it with\na towel and put it back into the cupboard.\n\nChet left without saying a word.\n\nThe bat-house breathed around him, a million farts and snores and whispered\nwords. A lift was available almost before he took his finger off the summon\nbutton. \"125,\" he said.\n\nChet walked to the door of the guy who thought he was Nicola Tesla and started\nto knock, then put his hands down and sank down into a squat, with his back\nagainst it.\n\nHe must have dozed, because the next thing he knew, he was tipping over\nbackwards into the apt, and the guy who thought he was Nicola Tesla was standing\nover him, concerned.\n\n\"Are you all right, son?\"\n\nChet stood, dusted himself off and looked at the floor. \"Sorry, I didn't want to\ndisturb you. . .\"\n\n\"But you wanted to come back and see more. Marvelous! I applaud your curiosity,\nyoung sir. I have just taken the waters -- perhaps you would like to try?\" He\ngestured at the ocean.\n\n\"You mean, swim in it?\"\n\n\"If you like. Myself, I find a snorkel and mask far superior. My set is up on\nthe rim, you're welcome to them, but I would ask you to chew a stick of this\nbefore you get in.\" He tossed Chet a pack of gum. \"It's an invention of my own\n-- chew a stick of that, and you can_not_ transmit any nasty bugs in your saliva\nfor forty-eight hours. I hold a patent for it, of course, but my agents report\nthat it has been met with crashing indifference in the Great Beyond.\"\n\nChet had been swimming before, in the urinary communal pools on the tenth and\nfifteenth levels, horsing around naked with his mates. Nudity was not a big deal\nfor the kids of the bat-house -- the kind of adult who you wouldn't trust in\nsuch circumstances didn't end up in bat-houses -- the bugouts had a different\nplace for them.\n\n\"Go on, lad, give it a try. It's simply marvelous, I tell you!\"\n\nUnsteadily, Chet climbed the spiral stairs leading up to the tank, clutching the\nhandrail, chewing the gum, which fizzed and sparked in his mouth. At the top,\nthere was a small platform. Self-consciously, he stripped, then pulled on the\nmask and snorkel that hung from a peg.\n\n\"Tighten the straps, boy!\" the guy who thought he was Nicola Tesla shouted, from\nfar, far below. \"If water gets into the mask, just push at the top and blow out\nthrough your nose!\"\n\nChet awkwardly lowered himself into the water. It was warm -- blood temperature\n-- and salty, and it fizzled a little on his skin, as though it, too, were\nelectric.\n\nHe kept one hand on the snorkel, afraid that it would tip and fill with water,\nand then, slowly, slowly, relaxed on his belly, mask in the water, arms by his\nside.\n\nMy god! It was like I was flying! It was like all the dreams I'd ever had, of\nflying, of hovering over an alien world, of my consciousness taking flight from\nmy body and sailing through the galaxy.\n\nMy hands were by my sides, out of view of the mask, and my legs were behind me.\nI couldn't see any of my body. My view stretched 8m down, an impossible,\ndizzying height. A narrow, elegant angelfish swam directly beneath me, and\ntickled my belly with one of its fins as it passed under.\n\nI smiled, a huge grin, and it broke the seal on my mask, filling it with water.\nCalmly, as though I'd been doing it all my life, I pressed the top of my mask to\nmy forehead and blew out through my nose. My mask cleared of water.\n\nI floated.\n\nThe only sound was my breathing, and distant, metallic _pink!_s from the ocean's\ndepths. A school of iridescent purple fish swam past me, and I lazily kicked out\nafter them, following them to the edge of the coral reef that climbed the far\nwall of the ocean. When I reached it, I was overwhelmed by its complexity,\nmillions upon millions of tiny little suckers depending from weird branches and\nmisshapen brains and stone roses.\n\nI held my breath.\n\nAnd I heard nothing. Not a sound, for the first time in all the time I had been\nin the bat-house -- no distant shouts and mutters. I was alone, in a vast,\npersonal silence, in a private ocean. My pulse beat under my skin. Tiny fish\nwriggled in the coral, tearing at the green fuzz that grew over it.\n\nSlowly, I turned around and around. The ocean-wall that faced into the apt was\nsilvered on this side, reflecting back my little pale body to me. My head\npounded, and I finally inhaled, and the sound of my breathing, harsh through the\nsnorkel, rang in my ears.\n\nI spent an age in the water, holding my breath, chasing the fish, disembodied, a\nconsciousness on tour on an alien world.\n\nThe guy who thought he was Nicola Tesla brought me back. He waited on the rim of\nthe tank until I swam near enough for him to touch, then he tapped me on the\nshoulder. I stuck my head up, and he said, \"Time to get out, boy, I need to use\nthe ocean.\"\n\nReluctantly, I climbed out. He handed me a towel.\n\nI felt like I was still flying, atop the staircase on the ocean's edge. I felt\nlike I could trip slowly down the stairs, never quite touching them. I pulled on\nmy clothes, and they felt odd to me.\n\nCarefully, forcing myself to grip the railing, I descended. The guy who thought\nhe was Nicola Tesla stood at my side, not speaking, allowing me my reverie.\n\nMy hair was drying out, and starting to raise skywards, and the guy who thought\nhe was Nicola Tesla went over to his apparatus and flipped a giant knife switch.\nThe ocean stirred, a puff of sand rose from its bottom, and then, the coral on\nthe ocean's edge _moved_.\n\nIt squirmed and danced and writhed, startling the fish away from it, shedding\nlayers of algae in a green cloud.\n\n\"It's my latest idea. I've found the electromagnetic frequencies that the\nvarious coral resonate on, and by using those as a carrier wave, I can stimulate\nthem into tremendously accelerated growth. Moreover, I can alter their\nelectromagnetic valences, so that, instead of calcium salts, they use other\nminerals as their building-blocks.\"\n\nHe grinned hugely, and seemed to want Chet to say something. Chet didn't\nunderstand any of it.\n\n\"Well, don't you see?\"\n\n\"Nuh.\"\n\n\"I can use coral to concentrate trace gold and platinum and any other\nheavy-metal you care to name out of the seas. I can prospect in the very water\nitself!\" He killed the switch. The coral stopped their dance abruptly, and the\nnew appendages they'd grown dropped away, tumbling gracefully to the ocean's\nfloor. \"You see? Gold, platinum, lead. I dissolved a kilo of each into the water\nlast night, microscopic flakes. In five minutes, my coral has concentrated it\nall.\"\n\nThe stumps where the minerals had dropped away were jagged and sharp, and\npainful looking.\n\n\"It doesn't even harm the fish!\"\n\n#\n\nChet's playmates seemed as strange as fish to him. They met up on the 87th\nlevel, where there was an abandoned apt with a faulty lock. Some of them seemed\nbatty themselves, standing in corners, staring at the walls, tracing patterns\nthat they alone could see. Others seemed too confident ever to be bats -- they\nshouted and boasted to each other, got into shoving matches that escalated into\nknock-out brawls and then dissolved into giggles. Chet found himself on the\nsidelines, an observer.\n\nOne boy, whose father hung around the workshops with Chet's father, was\nindustriously pulling apart the warp of the carpet, rolling it into a ball. When\nthe ball reached a certain size, he snapped the loose end, tucked it in and\nstarted another.\n\nA girl whose family had been taken to the bat-house all the way from a\nreservation near Sioux Lookout was telling loud lies about home, about\ntremendous gun-battles fought out with the Ontario Provincial Police and huge,\nglamorous casinos where her mother had dealt blackjack to millionaire\nhigh-rollers, who tucked thousand dollar tips into her palm. About her bow and\narrow and her rifle and her horses. Nobody believed her stories, and they made\nfun of her behind her back, but they listened when she told them, spellbound.\n\nWhat was her name, anyway?\n\nThere were two boys, one followed the other everywhere. The followee was\ntormenting the follower, as usual, smacking him in the back of the head, then\ncalling him a baby, goading him into hitting back, dodging easily, and\nretaliating viciously.\n\nChet thought that he understood some of what was going on. Maybe he'd be able to\nexplain it to The Amazing Robotron.\n\n#\n\nI never thought I'd say this, but I miss my exoskeleton. My feet ache, my legs\nache, my ass aches, and I'm hot and thirsty and my waterbottle is empty. I'm not\neven past Bloor Street, not even a tenth of the way to the bat-house.\n\n#\n\nThe Amazing Robotron seemed thoughtful as I ratted out my chums. \"So, I think\nthey need each other. The big one needs the little one, to feel important. The\nlittle one needs the big one, so that he can feel useful. Is that right?\"\n\n\"It is ve-ry per-cep-tive, Chet. When I was young, I had a sim-i-lar friend-ship\nwith an-other. It -- no, _she_ -- was the lit-tle one, and I was the big one.\nHer pa-rent died be-fore we came of age, and she left the Cen-ter, and when she\ncame back to visit, a long time la-ter, we were re-ver-sed -- I felt smal-ler\nbut good, and spec-ial be-cause she told me all a-bout the out-side.\"\n\nSomething clicked inside me then. I saw myself inside The Amazing Robotron's\nexoskeleton, and he in my skin, our roles reversed. It lasted no longer than a\nlightning flash, but in that flash, I suddenly knew that I could talk to The\nAmazing Robotron, and that he would understand.\n\nI felt so smart all of a sudden. I felt like The Amazing Robotron and I were\nstanding outside the bat-house, _in_ it but not _of_ it, and we shared a secret\ninsight into the poor, crazy bastards we were cooped up with.\n\n\"I don't really like anyone here. I don't like my Dad -- he's always shouting,\nand I think he's the reason we ended up here. He's batshit -- he gets angry too\neasy. And my Mom is batshit now, even if she wasn't batshit before, because of\nhim. I don't feel like their son. I feel like I just share an apt with these two\ncrazy people I don't like very much. And none of my mates are any good, either.\nThey're all either like my Dad -- loud and crazy, or like my Mom, quiet and\ncrazy. Everyone's crazy.\"\n\n\"That may be true, Chet. But you can still like cra-zy peo-ple.\"\n\n\"Do _you_ like 'em?\"\n\nThe Amazing Robotron's idiot lights rippled. _Gotcha_, I thought.\n\n\"I do not like them, Chet. They are loud and cra-zy and they on-ly think of\nthem-selves.\"\n\nI laughed. It was so refreshing not to be lied to. My skin was all tight from\nthe dried saltwater, and that felt good, too.\n\n\"My Dad, the other day? He came home and was all, 'This is a conspiracy to drive\nus out of our house. It's because we bought a house with damn high ceilings.\nSome big damn alien wanted to live there, so they put us here. It's because I\ndid such a good job on the ceilings!' Which is so stupid, 'cause the ceilings in\nour old house weren't no higher than the ceilings here, and besides, Dad screwed\nup all the plaster when he was trying to fix it up, and it was always cracking.\n\n\"And then he starts talking about what's really bugging him, which is that some\nguy at the workshop took his favorite drill and he couldn't finish his big\nproject without it. So he got into a fight with the guy, and got the drill and\nthen he finished his big, big project, and brought it home, and you know what it\nwas? A _pencil-holder_! We don't even _have_ any pencils! He is so screwed up.\"\n\nAnd The Amazing Robotron's lights rippled again, and a huge weight lifted from\nmy shoulders. I didn't feel ashamed of the maniacs that gave me life -- I saw\nthem as pitiful subjects for my observations. I laughed again, and that must\nhave been the most I'd laughed since they put us in the bat-house.\n\n#\n\nI'm getting my sea-legs. I hope. My mouth is pasty, and salty, and sweat keeps\nrunning down into my eyes. I never even began to realize how much support the\nexoskeleton's jelly-suspension lent me.\n\nBut I've made it to Eglinton, and that's nearly a third of the way, and to\ncelebrate, I stop in at a coffee-shop and drink a whole pitcher of lemonade\nwhile sitting by the air-conditioner.\n\nI got the word that they were tearing down the bat-house only two weeks ago. The\nmessage came by priority email from The Amazing Robotron: all the bats were\ndead, or enough of them anyway that the rest could be relocated to less\nexpensive quarters. It was barely enough notice to get my emergency leave\napplication in, to book a ticket back to Earth, and to finally become a murderer\nall the way.\n\nDamn, I hope I know what I'm doing.\n\n#\n\nThe guy who thought he was Nicola Tesla told me all kinds of stories, and I was\nsure he was lying to me, but when I checked out the parts of his story that I\ncould, they all turned out to be true.\n\n\"I don't actually _need_ to be here. I've come here to get away from all the\ntreachery, the deceit, the filthy pursuit of the dollar. As though I need more\nmoney! I invented foam! Oh, sure, the Process likes to take credit for it, but\nif you look up the patent, guess who owns it?\n\n\"Master Affeltranger, you may not realize it to look at me, but I have some\n_very_ important friends, out there in the Great Beyond. With important friends,\nyou can make a whole block of apts simply disappear from the record-books. You\ncan make tremendous energy consumption vanish, likewise.\"\n\nHe spoke as he tinkered with his apparatus, which hummed alarmingly and\noccasionally sent a tortured arc of electricity into the guy who thought he was\nNicola Tesla's chest.\n\nIt happened three times in a row, and he stamped his foot in frustration, and\nsaid, \"Oh, _do_ cut it out,\" apparently to one of his machines.\n\nI'd been jumping every time he got zapped, but this time, I had to giggle. He\nwhirled on me. \"I am not trying to be _amusing_. One thing you people never\nrealize is that the current has a _will_, it has a _mind_, and you have to keep\nit in check with a firm hand.\"\n\nI shook my head a little, not understanding. He waved a hand at me, frustrated,\nand said, \"Oh, go have a swim. I don't have time to argue with a child.\"\n\nI climbed into the ocean, and the silence embraced me, and the water tingled\nwith electricity, and my consciousness floated away from my body and soared over\nan alien world. Like a broken circuit, I disconnected from the world around me.\n\n#\n\nChet's father came home with a can of beer in his hand and the rest of the\nsix-pack in his gut. He walked over to the vid, where Chet was researching the\nlife of Nicola Tesla, which took forever, since he had to keep linking back to\nsimple tutorials on physics, history, and electrical engineering.\n\nChet's father stooped and took the remote out of Chet's hands and opened up a\nbookmarked docu-drama about the coming of the bugouts. Chet opened his mouth to\nprotest, and his father shouted him down before he could speak. \"Not one word,\nyou hear me? Not! One! Word! I've had a shithole day and I wanna relax.\"\n\nChet's mother dropped a plastic tumbler, which bounced twice, and rolled to\nChet's toe. He stepped over it, walked out the door, and took the elevator to\nthe 125th floor.\n\nChet burst into the guy who thought he was Nicola Tesla's apt and screamed.\nNicola Tesla was strapped into a heavy wooden chair, with a metal hood over his\nhead. Arcs of electricity danced over his body, and he jerked and thrashed\nagainst the leather straps that bound his limbs. Unthinking, Chet ran forward\nand grabbed the buckle that bound his wrist, and a giant's fist smashed into\nhim, hurling him across the room.\n\nWhen he came to, the electric arcs were gone, but the guy who thought he was\nNicola Tesla was motionless in his straps, under his hood.\n\nCarefully, Chet came to his feet, and saw that the toe of his right sneaker had\nbeen blown out, leaving behind charred canvas. His foot hurt -- burned.\n\nHe hobbled to the chair and gingerly prodded it, then jerked his hand back,\nthough he hadn't been shocked. He bit his lip and stared. The wood was quite\nweathered and elderly, though it had been oiled and had a rich, well-cared-for\nfinish. The leather straps were nightmarishly thick, gripping the guy who\nthought he was Nicola Tesla at the bicep and wrist, at the thigh and calf and\nankle. Livid bruises were already spreading at their edges.\n\nChet was struck by a sudden urge to climb into the ocean and _stay_ there. Just\n_stay_ there.\n\nUnder the hood, the guy who thought he was Nicola Tesla groaned. Chet gave an\ninvoluntary squeak and jumped a little. The guy who thought he was Nicola\nTesla's body snapped tense. \"Who's there?\" he said, his voice muffled by the\nhood.\n\n\"It's me, Chet.\"\n\n\"Chet? Damn. Damn, damn, damn.\" His right hand bent nearly double at the wrist\nand teased the buckle of the strap free. With one hand free, the guy who thought\nhe was Nicola Tesla quickly undid the straps on his upper body, then lifted away\nthe hood. He pointedly did not look at Chet as he doubled over and undid the\nstraps on his legs and ankles.\n\nGingerly, he stood and stretched, then sighed tremendously.\n\n\"Chet, Chet, Chet. I hope I didn't frighten you too badly. This is Old Sparky,\nan exact replica of the electric chair at Sing-Sing Prison in New York. Edison,\nthief and charlatan that he was, insisted that his DC current was safer than my\nAC, and they built a chair that used my beautiful current to execute criminals,\nby the hundreds.\n\n\"Nicola Tesla and I became one when I was eight years old, and I received a\ntremendous shock from an electrified fence. I was stuck to it, glued by the\ncurrent, and after a few moments, I just relaxed into the current -- befriended\nit, if you will. That's when the spirit of Nicola Tesla, a-wandering through the\nwires for all the years since his death, infused my body.\n\n\"So now I use Old Sparky here to recharge -- please forgive the expression -- my\nconnection with the current. I once spent eight years in the chair, when I\nneeded to disappear for a while. When I woke, I hadn't aged at all -- I didn't\neven need to shave! What do you think of that?\"\n\nChet was staring in horror at him. \"You electrocute yourself? On purpose?\"\n\n\"Why, yes! Think of it as a trick I do, if it makes you feel better. I could\nshow you how to do it. . .\" he trailed off, but a look of hunger had passed over\nhis face.\n\n#\n\nI get all kinds of access to bat-house records from the vid in my apt on my new\nworld. No one named Gaylord Ballozos ever lived in any bat-house. Apt 12525, and\nthe five above it, were never occupied. The records say that the locks have\nnever been used, the doors never opened. It won't be searched when they evacuate\nthe bat-house.\n\nThat's what the records say, anyway.\n\nElectricity gives me the willies. The zaps of static from the dry air of the FTL\nI took home to Earth made me scream, little-boy squeaks that made the other\npassengers jump.\n\nI don't remember that it was ever this hot in Toronto, even in the summer. The\nsky is all overcast, so maybe it's a temperature inversion. Up here at Steeles\nAvenue, I'm so dehydrated that I spend a whole dime on a magnum of still water\nand power-chug it, though you're not supposed to drink that way. Almost there.\n\n#\n\nThe other kids in the abandoned apt on the 87th floor ignored me. They'd been\npaying less and less attention to me, ever since I started spending my\nafternoons up on 125, and I was getting a reputation as a keener for all the\ntime I spent with The Amazing Robotron.\n\nThat suited me fine; the corner of the gutted kitchen was as private a space as\nI was going to find in the bat-house. I had the apparatus that Nicola Tesla had\ngiven me plugged into the AC outlet under the sink. I closed my eyes and\nbreathed deeply, concentrating on the moments after my breath left my chest,\nthat calm like the ocean's silence. Smoothly, I reached out and grasped the\nhandle of the apparatus and squeezed.\n\nThe first time I tried this, under Nicola Tesla's supervision, I'd jerked my\nhand away and squeezed it between my legs as soon as the current shot through\nme. Now, though, I could keep squeezing, slowly increasing the voltage and\namperage, relaxing into the involuntary tension in my muscles.\n\nI'd gotten so good at it that I'd started using the timer -- I could lean into\nthe current forever without it. I had it set for three hours, but when the\ncurrent died, it felt like no time at all had passed. I probed around my\nconsciousness for any revelation, but no spirit had come into my body during the\nexercise. The guy who thought he was Nicola Tesla didn't know if there were any\nother spirits in the wire, but it stood to reason that if there was one, there\nhad to be more.\n\nI stood, and felt incredibly calm and balanced and centered and I floated past\nthe other kids. It was time for my session with The Amazing Robotron.\n\n\"Chet, how are you fee-ling?\"\n\n\"I'm well, thank you.\" Nicola Tesla spoke well and carefully, and I'd started to\nape him.\n\n\"And what would you like to dis-cuss to-day?\"\n\n\"I don't really have anything to talk about, honestly. Everything is fine.\"\n\n\"That is good. Do you have any new ob-ser-va-tions about your friends?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, no. I haven't been paying much attention lately.\"\n\n\"Why hav-en't you?\"\n\n\"It just doesn't interest me, sorry.\"\n\n\"Why does-n't it in-ter-est you?\"\n\n\"I just don't care about them, to be frank.\"\n\nThe Amazing Robotron was absolutely still for a moment. \"Are things well with\nyour par-ents, too?\"\n\n\"The same as always. I think they've found their niches.\" _Find your niche_ was\nan expression I'd pirated from the guy who thought he was Nicola Tesla. I was\nvery proud of it.\n\n\"In that case, why don't we end this mee-ting?\"\n\nI was surprised. The Amazing Robotron always demanded his full hour. \"I'll see\nyou on Wednesday, then?\"\n\n\"I'm af-raid not, Chet. I will be gone for a few months -- I have to re-turn\nhome. There will be a sub-sti-tute coun-sel-or arri-ving next Monday.\"\n\nMy calm center shattered. Sweat sprang out on my palms. \"What? You're leaving?\nHow can you be leaving?\"\n\n\"I'm so-rry, Chet. There is an em-er-gen-cy at home. I'll be back as soon as I\ncan.\"\n\n\"Frick that! How can you go? What'll I do if you don't come back? You're the\nonly one I can talk to!\"\n\n\"I'm so-rry, Chet. I have to go.\"\n\n\"If you gave a shit, you'd stay. You can't just leave me here!\" I knew as I said\nit that it didn't make any sense, but a picture sprang into my mind, one that\nI'd been carrying without knowing it for a long time: The Amazing Robotron and\nme as an adult, walking away from the bat-house, with suitcases, leaving\ntogether, forever. I felt a sob hiccough in my throat.\n\n\"I will re-turn, Chet. I did-n't wish to up-set you.\"\n\n\"Frick that! I don't give a shit if you come back, asshole.\"\n\n#\n\nChet went straight to 87 and plugged in to the apparatus. He didn't set the\ntimer, and he stayed plugged in for nearly two days, when two fighting boys\ntumbled into him and knocked his hand away. He was centered and numb again, and\ndidn't have any sense of the intervening time. He didn't even have to pee. He\nwondered if he was trying to commit suicide.\n\nHe checked his comm and got the date, noticed with distant surprise that it was\ntwo days later, and wandered up to 125.\n\nThe guy who thought he was Nicola Tesla shouted a distant \"Come in\" when Chet\ntapped on the door. He was playing with his ocean again. Chet felt his hair\nfloat up off his shoulders. He stopped and watched the coral squirm and dance.\n\n\"I spent nearly two days on the apparatus,\" Chet said.\n\n\"Eh? Very good, very good. You're progressing nicely.\"\n\n\"My counselor has left. He had to go home.\"\n\n\"Yes? Well, there you are.\"\n\n\"What were your parents like?\"\n\n\"Nicola Tesla's father was a bishop, and his mother was an illiterate, though\nshe was a gifted memnist and taught me much about visualization.\"\n\n\"No, I mean _your_ parents. Mister and Missus Ballozos. What were _they_ like?\"\n\nThe guy who thought he was Nicola Tesla shut down the ocean and watched the\nlumps of ore tumble to the sand. \"Why do you want to know about _them_? Are you\nhaving some sort of trouble at home?\" he asked impatiently, not looking away\nfrom the ocean.\n\n\"No reason,\" Chet said. \"I have to go home now.\"\n\n\"Yes, fine.\"\n\n#\n\n\"The hell have you been, boy?\" Chet's father said, when he came through door.\nHis father was in front of the vid, wearing shorts and a filthy t-shirt, holding\nthe remote in one hand. Chet's mother was sitting at the window, staring out\ninto the clouds.\n\n\"Out. Around. I'm okay, okay?\"\n\n\"It's not okay. You can't just run around like some kind of animal. Sit the hell\ndown and tell me where you've been. Your counselor was here looking for you.\"\n\n\"Robotron? He was here?\"\n\n\"Yes he was here! And I had to tell him I didn't know where my damn kid was! How\ndo you think that makes me look? You know how worried your mother was?\"\n\nChet's mother didn't stir from her post by the window, but she flinched when\nChet's father spoke. Chet swallowed hard.\n\n\"What did he want?\"\n\n\"Never mind that! Sit the hell down and tell me where you've been and what the\nhell you thought you were doing!\"\n\nChet sat beside his father and stared at his hands. He knew he could outwait his\nfather. After half an hour, Chet's father turned the vid on. Four long hours\nlater, he switched it off, and went to bed.\n\nChet's mother finally turned away from the now-dark window. She reached into the\npocket of her grimy bathrobe and withdrew an envelope and handed it to Chet,\nthen turned and went to the apt's other room to sleep.\n\nMy name was on the outside of the envelope, in rough script, written with\nawkward exoskeleton manipulators. I broke its seal, and it folded out into a\nsingle flat sheet of paper.\n\nDEAR CHET, it began. At the bottom of it was a complex scrawl that I recognized\nfrom the front of The Amazing Robotron's exoskeleton. It must be some kind of\nsignature.\n\nDEAR CHET,\n\nI AM SORRY TO HAVE TO LEAVE YOU SO SUDDENLY, AND WITHOUT ANYONE ELSE TO TALK TO.\nTHERE IS AN EMERGENCY AT MY HOME, BUT I WOULDN'T GO IF I DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU\nWERE ABLE TO HANDLE MY ABSENCE. YOU ARE A VERY PERCEPTIVE AND STRONG YOUNG MAN,\nAND YOU WILL BE ABLE TO MANAGE IN MY ABSENCE. I WILL BE BACK, YOU KNOW.\n\nYOU WILL BE ALL RIGHT. I PROMISE.\n\nTHIS ISN'T EASY FOR ME TO DO, EITHER. IT MAY BE THAT I AM THE ONLY ONE YOU CAN\nTALK TO HERE AT THE CENTER. IT IS LIKEWISE TRUE THAT YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE I CAN\nTALK TO.\n\nI WILL MISS YOU, MY FRIEND CHET.\n\nThe writing was childish, with many line-outs and corrections. Reading it, I\nheard it not in The Amazing Robotron's halting mechanical speech, but in my own\nvoice.\n\nI didn't cry. I held the letter tight in my hand, as tight as I ever held the\napparatus, and leaned into it, like it was a source of strength.\n\n#\n\nThey haven't even started work on the bat-house. There are bugout saucers\nhovering all around it, with giant foam-solvent tanks mounted under their\nbellies. A small crowd has gathered.\n\nI take off my jacket and lay it on the strip of grass by the sidewalk across the\nstreet from the bat-house. I pull off my soaked t-shirt and feel a rare breeze\nacross my chest, as soothing as a kiss on a fevered forehead. I ball up the\nshirt, then lay down on my jacket, using the shirt as a pillow.\n\nThe bat-house is empty, its eyes staring blind, vertical to infinity. The grotty\nsculpture out front is gone already, and with it, the sign with the polite,\nnever-used name. It is now just the bat-house.\n\nI check my comm. The dissolving of the bat-house is scheduled for less than an\nhour from now.\n\n#\n\nThe new counselor was no damn good. It wore a different exoskeleton, a motorized\ngurney on wheels with three buzzing antigrav manipulators that floated\nconstantly around the apt, tasting the air. It called itself \"Tom.\" I didn't\ncall it anything, and I limited my answers to it to monosyllables.\n\nThe next time I came on the guy who was Nicola Tesla in his chair, the letter\nwas in my pocket. I took a long swim in the ocean, and then I stripped off my\nmask and spit out the snorkel, took a deep breath and dove until my ears felt\nlike they were going to burst. I stared at my reflection in the silvered wall of\nthe tank. Through the distortion of the water and the sting of the salt, my body\nwas indistinct and clothed in quicksilver, surrounded by schools of alien,\ndarting fish. I didn't recognize myself, but I didn't take my eyes away until my\nlungs were ready to burst and I resurfaced.\n\nThe guy who thought he was Nicola Tesla was still thrashing away at his straps\nwhen I climbed down from the ocean's top. At one side of Old Sparky, there was a\ntimer, like the one on my apparatus, and a knife-switch for timed and untimed\nsessions.\n\nI stared at him. My life unrolled before me, a life distanced and remote from\nthe world around me, a life trapped in my own deepening battiness. Before I\ncould think about what I was doing, I flipped the switch from \"timed\" to\n\"untimed.\" I took one last look at the ocean, looked again at Nicola Tesla, my\nfriend and seducer, stuck to his chair until someone switched it off again, and\nleft the 125th floor.\n\n#\n\nI took the apparatus apart in the kiddy workshop, stripped it to a collection of\nscrews and wires and circuit boards, then carefully smashed each component with\na hammer until it was in thousands of tiny pieces.\n\nIt took me two days to do it right, and not a moment passed when I didn't nearly\nrun upstairs and switch off Tesla's chair.\n\nAnd not a moment passed when I didn't visualize Tesla's wrath, his betrayal, his\nanger, when I unbuckled him.\n\nAnd not a moment passed when I didn't wish I could plug in the apparatus, swim\nin the ocean, take myself away from the world and the world away from me.\n\nThe Amazing Robotron returned at the end of the second day.\n\n\"Chet, I am glad to see you a-gain.\"\n\nI bit my lip and choked on tears of relief. \"I need to leave here, Robotron. I\ncan't stay another minute. Please, get me out of here. I'll do anything. I'll\nrun away. Get me out, get me out, get me out!\" I was babbling, sniveling and\ncrying, and I begged all the harder.\n\n\"Why do you want to leave right now?\"\n\n\"I -- I can't take it anymore. I can't _stand_ being here. I'd rather be in\nprison than in here anymore.\"\n\n\"When I was young, I left the Cen-ter I was rais-ed in to attend coun-sel-ing\nschool. You are near-ly old e-nough to go now. May-be your pa-rents would let\nyou go?\"\n\nI knew he had found the only way out.\n\nI started work on my father. I wheedled and begged and demanded, and he just\nlaughed. For three whole days, I used begging as a way to avoid thinking of\nTesla. For three days, my father shook his head.\n\nI cried myself to sleep and wallowed in my guilt every night, and when I woke, I\ncried more. I stopped leaving the apt. I stopped eating. My mother and I sat all\nday, staring out the window. I stopped talking.\n\nOne morning, after my father had left, I dragged a stool to the window and\npressed my face against it. My mother clattered around behind me.\n\n\"Go,\" my mother said.\n\nI gave a squeak and turned around. My mother had folded my clothes in a neat\npile and had laid a canvas bag beside it. She had the vid remote in her hand,\nand on the screen was a waiver for me to go to school. We locked eyes for a\nmoment, and I moved to go to her, but she turned and stormed into the kitchen\nand started to clean the cupboards, silent again.\n\nI left that day.\n\n#\n\nThe saucers lift off to-the-second on-time. The crowd, which has grown, sighs\ncollectively as the saucers disappear over the haze, then a fine mist of solvent\nrains down on our heads. It's as salty as sea-water, and the bat-house trembles\nas it begins to melt. Streams of salty water course down its sides.\n\nThe top of the building comes into view, the saucers chasing it down as it\ndissolves, spraying a steady blast of solvent.\n\nI tense as the building's top reaches what I estimate to be 150. My calves bunch\nand my breath catches in my chest. I feel like I'm drowning, and the building's\ntop crawls downwards, and my feet are sloshing to the ankles in dissolved foam,\nthat runs off into the sewers.\n\nI stay tense until the building's top is far beneath what _must_ be 125, then I\nexhale in a whoof of air. My head spins, and I brace my hands against my thighs.\nI'm not looking up when it happens, as a result.\n\nThe first sign is when the great tide of green, scummy, plant-stinking water\ncourses down over us, soaking us to the skin, blinding me and sending me reeling\nin reverie. Did I see hunks of dead, petrified coral crashing around me, or did\nI imagine it?\n\nA brief second later the building's top emits a bolt of lightning that broke\neven Tesla's record for man-made lightning, recorded at nearly a kilometer in\nlength. A clap of thunder accompanies it, louder than any sound I have ever\nheard, and it its wake I am perfectly deaf, submerged in silence.\n\nThe finger of lightning crawls through space like a broken-back rattler, and my\nhair rises from my shoulders. In the presence of so much current, I should be\npetrified, but it is magnificent. The finger seeks and seeks, then contacts one\nof the saucers and literally blasts it out of the sky. It plummets in\nslow-motion, and as it does, the building's top descends even further, and I\n_swear_ I see the chair falling from the building's edge, and the man strapped\ninside it had not aged a day in all the lifetimes gone by.\n\n#\n\nChet's comm died somewhere in the lightning strike, but the emergency crews that\ntook him away and looked in his ears and poked him in the chest and gave him\npills take him back to the Royal York in a saucer, bridging the distance in a\nfew minutes, touching down on Front Street. The Royal York's doorman doesn't bat\nan eye as he gets the door for him.\n\nThe elevator ride is fine. He is still wrapped in the silence of his deafness,\nbut it's a comforting, _centering_ silence.\n\nOnce Chet is back in his room, he fires up the vid and starts writing a letter\nto The Amazing Robotron.\n\n--\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Home Again, Home Again, by Cory Doctorow\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK HOME AGAIN, HOME AGAIN ***\n\n***** This file should be named 17138.txt or 17138.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/7/1/3/17138/\n\nCory Doctorow\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
