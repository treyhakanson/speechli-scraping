K. JARVIS\n\n\nOn the first cloudy day in November, Tom Blacker, the shining light of\nOstreich and Company, Public Relations Counsellors, placed a call to a\nshirtsleeved man on the rooftop of the Cannon Building in New York City.\n\nHis message brought an immediate response from the waiting engineer, who\nflicked switches and twirled dials with expert motions, and brought into\nplay the gigantic 50,000-watt projector installed on the peak.\n\nIn his own office, Tom paced the floor in front of the three-window\nexposure, watching the heavens for the results.\n\nThey weren't long in coming.\n\nThe eyes came first. Eyes the size of Navy dirigibles, with pupils of\ndeep cerulean blue, floating against the backdrop of the gray cumulus.\nThe long lashes curled out almost a hundred feet from the lids. Then the\nrest of Monica Mitchell's famous face appeared: the flowing yellow\nlocks, the sensuously curved lips, parted moistly from even white teeth.\nFrom chin to hairline, the projected image above the city was close to a\nthousand feet in diameter.\n\nThen, as if the floating countenance wasn't alarming enough, the ruby\nlips began to move. Monica's sweet-sultry voice, like the first\ndrippings from a jar of honey, overcame the city sounds, and began\ncrooning the syrupy strains of _Love Me Alone_. Which happened, by no\ncoincidence, to be the title and theme song of Monica's newest epic.\n\n[Illustration: Monica's image--plastered across the heavens--stopped\ntraffic in all directions.]\n\nIt was a triumph. Tom knew it the moment he looked down at the crowded\nthoroughfare eighteen stories beneath the window. Traffic had come to a\nmore than normal standstill. Drivers were leaving their autos, and hands\nwere being upraised towards the gargantuan face on the clouds above.\n\nAnd of course, Tom's phone rang.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOstreich's big scowling face was barely squeezed within the confines of\nthe visiphone screen. He said nothing intelligible for two minutes.\n\n\"Relax, Chief,\" Tom said brightly. \"I've been saving this as a\nsurprise.\"\n\nOstreich's reply was censorable.\n\n\"Now look, D. O. You gave me _carte blanche_ with this Mitchell babe,\nremember? I figured we really needed a shot in the arm for this new\npicture of hers. The receipts on her last turkey couldn't pay her\nmasseurs.\"\n\nOstreich, who had built his firm by establishing golden public images\nfor various industrialists and their enterprises, had anticipated\ntrouble the moment he let the barrier down to admit such unworthy\nclients as Monica Mitchell. But he had never anticipated that his ace\npublicist would display such carnival tactics in their promotion. He\ngrowled like a taunted leopard.\n\n\"This is a cheap trick, Tom! Do you hear me? Turn that thing off at\nonce!\"\n\n\"Who, me?\" Tom said innocently. \"Gosh, D. O. I'm no engineer. I left\ninstructions with the operator to keep the projector going for three\nhours, until sunset. Don't think I can do anything about it now.\"\n\n\"You'll damn well _have_ to do something about it! You're ruining us!\"\n\n\"Look at it this way, Chief. What can we lose? If anybody takes offense,\nwe can blame it on that Hollywood gang.\"\n\n\"Turn that damn thing off! If that blankety face isn't out of the sky in\nten minutes, you can start emptying your desk!\"\n\nTom was a redhead. He reached over and snapped the visiphone switch\nbefore his boss could have the satisfaction. He stomped to the window,\nstill raging at Ostreich's lack of appreciation.\n\nBut he chuckled when he saw the activity in the street. The crowds were\nthickening at the intersections, and a special battalion of city police\nwere trying to keep things moving. Behind him, the visiphone was beeping\nfrantically again.\n\nHe waited a full minute before answering, all set to snap at Ostreich\nonce more.\n\nBut it wasn't Ostreich. It was a square-faced man with beetling brows\nand a chin like the biting end of a steam shovel. It took Tom a while to\nrecognize the face of Stinson, commissioner of police.\n\n\"Mr. Blacker?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir?\" Tom gulped.\n\n\"Mr. Ostreich referred me to you. You responsible for that--\" the\ncommissioner's voice was choked. \"--that menace?\"\n\n\"Menace, sir?\"\n\n\"You know what I'm talking about. We've got half a dozen CAA complaints\nalready. That thing's a menace to public safety, a hazard to air\ntravel--\"\n\n\"Look, Mr. Stinson. It's only a harmless publicity stunt.\"\n\n\"Harmless? You got funny ideas, Mr. Blacker. Don't get the wrong idea\nabout our city ordinances. We got statutes that cover this kind of\nthing. If you don't want to be a victim of one of them, turn that damned\nmonstrosity off!\"\n\nThe commissioner's angry visage left a reverse shadow burned on the\nvisiphone screen. It remained glowing there long after the contact was\nbroken.\n\nTom Blacker walked the carpeted floor of his office, chewing on his\nlower lip, and cursing the feeble imaginations of Ostreich and the rest\nof them. When his temper had cooled, he got sober thoughts of\nindictments, and law suits, and unemployment. With a sigh, he contacted\nthe engineer on the roof of the Cannon Building. Then he went to the\nwindow, and watched Monica's thousand-foot face fade gradually out of\nsight.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt four o'clock that afternoon, a long white envelope crossed Tom's\nblotter. There was a check to the amount of a month's salary enclosed,\nand a briefly-worded message from the office of the president.\n\nWhen he left the office, Ostreich's rolling phrases buzzed in his head\nlike swarming gnats. \"... a mockery of a great profession ... lowering\nof dignity ... incompatible with the highest ideals of ...\"\n\nAt ten o'clock that night, Tom was telling his troubles to a red-coated\nman behind a chromium bar on Forty-ninth Street. The man listened with\nall the gravity of a physician, and lined up the appropriate medicine in\nfront of his patient.\n\nBy midnight, Tom was singing Christmas carols, in advance of the season,\nwith a tableful of Texans.\n\nAt one o'clock, he swung a right cross at a mounted policeman, missed,\nand fell beneath the horse's legs.\n\nAt one-fifteen, he fell asleep against the shoulder of a B-girl as they\nrode through the streets of the city in a sleek police vehicle.\n\nThat was all Tom Blacker remembered, until he woke up in Livia Cord's\ncozy two-room apartment. He moved his head and winced with the pain.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Hi,\" the girl said.\n\nShe was smiling down at him, and for a moment, her floating face\nreminded Tom of the episode which had just cost him twenty grand a year.\nHe groaned, and rolled the other way on the contour couch.\n\n\"Hair of the dog?\" she said. There was a gleaming cannister in her hand.\n\n\"No, thanks.\" He sat up, rubbing the stiff red hair on the back of his\nhead. One eye seemed permanently screwed shut, but the other managed to\ntake in his surroundings. It explored the girl first, and\nappreciatively.\n\nShe was wearing something black and satiny, cut in the newest\nDallas-approved style, with long, tantalizing diagonal slashes across\nthe breast and hips. Her hair was strikingly two-toned, black and\nblonde. Her teeth were a blinding white, and had been filed to canine\nsharpness.\n\n\"My name's Livia,\" the girl said pleasantly. \"Livia Cord. I hope you\ndon't mind what I did.\"\n\n\"And what was that?\" Tom's other eye popped open, almost audibly.\n\n\"Bailing you out of jail. Seems you got into a fracas with a mounted\ncop. I think you tried to punch his horse.\"\n\n\"Nuts. I was trying to hit him.\"\n\n\"Well, you didn't.\" She chuckled, and poured herself a drink. \"You've\nhad quite a day, Mr. Blacker.\"\n\n\"You said it.\" There was a taste in his mouth like cigar ashes. He tried\nto stand up, but the weight on his head kept him where he was. \"You\nwouldn't have an oxygen pill around?\"\n\n\"Sure.\" She left with a toss of her skirt and a revelation of silky\ncalves. When she returned with the tablet and water, he took it\ngratefully. After a few minutes, he felt better enough to ask:\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"Why'd you bail me out? I don't know you. Or do I?\"\n\nShe laughed. \"No. Not yet you don't. But I know you, Mr. Blacker. By\nreputation, at any rate. You see--\" She sat next to him on the couch,\nand Tom was feeling well enough to tingle at her nearness. \"We're in the\nsame line of work, you and I.\"\n\n\"Unemployment?\"\n\n\"No,\" she smiled. \"Public relations. Only I'm on the client's side of\nthe fence. I work for an organization called Homelovers, Incorporated.\nEver hear of them?\"\n\nTom shook his head.\n\n\"Maybe you should. It's a rather important company, and growing. And\nthey're always on the lookout for superior talent.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe squinted at her. \"What is this? A job offer?\"\n\n\"Maybe.\" She wriggled a little, and the slits in her dress widened just\na fraction. \"We've got the nucleus of a good PR department now. But with\na really experienced man at the controls--it could grow enormously.\nThink you might be interested?\"\n\n\"Maybe I would,\" Tom said. But he wasn't thinking about PR right then.\n\n\"Mr. Andrusco's had you in mind for a long time,\" Livia Cord continued.\n\"I've mentioned your name to him several times as a possible candidate.\nIf you hadn't been fired from Ostreich, we might have tried to tempt you\naway.\" Her fingers touched a stray lock of red hair. \"Now--we don't have\nto be surreptitious about it. Do we?\"\n\n\"No,\" Tom said guardedly. \"I guess not.\"\n\n\"If you're free tomorrow, I could arrange a meeting with Mr. Andrusco.\nWould you like that?\"\n\n\"Well ...\"\n\n\"His office opens at nine. We could get there early.\"\n\nTom looked at his watch. Livia said: \"I know it's late. But we could get\nan early start in the morning, right after breakfast. Couldn't we?\"\n\n\"I dunno,\" Tom frowned. \"By the time I get home ...\"\n\n\"Home?\" The girl leaned back. \"Who said anything about home?\"\n\nHer bedroom was monochromed. Even the sheets were pink. At five o'clock,\nthe false dawn glimmered through the window, and the light falling on\nhis eyes awakened him. He looked over at the sleeping girl, feeling\ndrugged and detached. She moaned slightly, and turned her face towards\nhim. He blinked at the sight of it, and cried aloud.\n\n\"What is it?\" She sat up in bed and nicked on the table lamp. \"What's\nthe matter?\"\n\nHe looked at her carefully. She was beautiful. There wasn't even a\nsmudge of lipstick on her face.\n\n\"Nothing,\" he said dreamily, and turned away. By the time he was asleep\nagain, his mind had already erased the strange image from his clouded\nbrain--that Livia Cord had absolutely no mouth at all.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was hard to keep track of the glass-and-steel structures that had\nbeen springing up daily along the Fifth-Madison Thruway. When Tom and\nLivia stepped out of the cab in front of 320, he wasn't surprised that\nthe building--an odd, cylindrical affair with a pointed spire--was\nstrange to him. But he was taken aback to realize that all sixty floors\nwere the property of Homelovers, Incorporated.\n\n\"Quite a place,\" he told the girl.\n\nShe smiled at him tightly. Livia was crackling with business electricity\nthis morning, her spiked heels clicking along the marble floors of the\nlobby like typewriter keys. She wore a tailored gray suit that clung to\nher body with all the perfection and sexlessness of a window mannikin.\nIn the elevator, shooting towards the executive offices on the 57th\nfloor, Tom looked over at her and scratched his poorly-shaven cheeks in\nwonderment.\n\nThey plowed right through the frosty receptionist barrier, and entered\nan office only half the size of Penn Station. The man behind the\nU-shaped desk couldn't have been better suited to the surroundings by\nCentral Casting. He was cleft-jawed, tanned, exquisitely tailored. If\nhis polished brown toupee had been better fitted, he would have been\npositively handsome.\n\nThe handshake was firm.\n\n\"Good to see you,\" he grinned. \"Heard a lot about you, Mr. Blacker. All\nof it good.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Livia said airily. \"I've done my part. Now you two come to\nterms. Buzz me if you need me, J. A.\"\n\nJohn Andrusco unwrapped a cigar when she left, and said: \"Well, now.\nSuppose we get right down to cases, Mr. Blacker. Our organization is\nbadly in need of a public relations set-up that can pull out all the\nstops. We have money and we have influence. Now all we need is guidance.\nIf you can supply that, there's a vacant chair at the end of the hall\nthat can accommodate your backside.\" He grinned manfully.\n\n\"Well,\" Tom said delicately. \"My big problem is this, Mr. Andrusco. I\ndon't know what the hell business you're in.\"\n\nThe executive laughed heartily. \"Then let me fill you in.\"\n\nHe stepped over to a cork-lined wall, pressed a concealed button, and\npanels parted. An organizational chart, with designations that were\nmeaningless to Tom, appeared behind it.\n\n\"Speaking basically,\" Andrusco said, \"Homelovers, Incorporated\nrepresents the interests of the world's leading real estate concerns.\nLand, you know, is still the number one commodity of Earth, the one\npriceless possession that rarely deteriorates in value. In fact, with\nthe increase in the Earth's population, the one commodity that never\nseems to be in excess supply.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Tom said, not wholly in truth.\n\n\"The stability of real estate is our prime concern. By unification of\nour efforts, we have maintained these values over a good many years. But\nas you know, a good business organization never rests on its laurels.\nSometimes, even basic human needs undergo unusual--alterations.\"\n\n\"I'm not following too well,\" Tom said frankly. \"Just where does public\nrelations come into this? I can't see much connection.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAndrusco frowned, but without wrinkling his serene brow too much. He\nwent to the multipaned window and locked his hands behind his back.\n\n\"Let me put it this way, Mr. Blacker. With the Earth's population\napproaching the three billion mark, you can imagine that real estate is\nat a greater premium than ever--yes, even the remotest land areas have\ngained in market value. But let me ask you this. If there were only a\nhundred apples in the world, and you owned all of them, what would you\ndo if you learned that someone else had discovered a fruitful orchard,\nwhich contains ten million apples?\"\n\n\"I'd go out of the apple business.\"\n\n\"Precisely.\" Andrusco rocked on his heels. \"In a sense, that's very much\nthe problem that Homelovers, Incorporated may have to face in the next\ngeneration.\"\n\n\"Somebody swiping your apples?\"\n\n\"In a way.\" The man chuckled. \"Yes, in a way.\" He raised his arm slowly,\nand pointed to the sky. \"The apples,\" he said, \"are up there.\"\n\n\"Huh?\" Tom said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Space, Mr. Blacker. Space is opening its doors to us. Already, the UN\nSpace Commission has launched some two dozen manned vehicles into the\nouter reaches. Already, the satellite-building colony on the moon is\nwell under way. The progress of our space program has been accelerating\nmonth by month. The expert predictions have been more and more\noptimistic of late. In another ten, twenty years, the solar system will\nbe beckoning the children of Earth ...\"\n\nTom said nothing for a while. Then he cleared his throat.\n\n\"Well ... I'm no expert on these things. But maybe the population could\nstand a little more real estate, Mr. Andrusco. In twenty years ...\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" The voice was snappish. \"The best authorities say it isn't\nso. There's plenty of room on Earth. But if ever a mass exodus\nbegins--\"\n\n\"That doesn't seem possible,\" Tom said. \"Does it? I mean, only a handful\nof guys have ever gone out there. A drop in the bucket. I mean, Mars and\nall that may be fun to visit, but who'd want to live there?\"\n\nAndrusco turned to him slowly.\n\n\"The apples in the new orchard may be sour, Mr. Blacker. But if your\nlivelihood depended on your own little stack of fruit--would you be\nwilling to sit by and take the chance?\"\n\nTom shrugged. \"And is that the public relations job? To keep people out\nof space?\"\n\n\"Put in its crudest form, yes.\"\n\n\"A pretty tough job. You know that guff about Man's Pioneering Spirit.\"\n\n\"Yes. But we're worried about the public spirit, Mr. Blacker. If we can\ndampen their ardor for space flight--only delay it, mind you, for\nanother few years--we can tighten our own lines of economic defense. Do\nI make myself clear?\"\n\n\"Not completely.\"\n\n\"Will you take the job?\"\n\n\"What does it pay?\"\n\n\"Fifty thousand.\"\n\n\"Where do I sit?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBy the afternoon, Tom Blacker was ensconced in a fair-sized office with\nvaguely oriental furnishings and an ankle-deep rug. Livia's pretty\nankles visited it first.\n\n\"Here's an outline I began on the PR program,\" she told him briskly,\ndropping a sheet of paper on his desk. \"I didn't get very far with it.\nI'm sure you can add a lot.\"\n\n\"Okay. I'll read it over this afternoon.\" He tipped the chair back. \"How\nabout dinner tonight?\"\n\n\"Sorry. Busy tonight. Maybe later this week.\"\n\nBut it wasn't until Friday, three days later, that he saw Livia Cord\nagain. He accomplished that by calling her in for a conference,\nspreading his own typewritten notes on the desk in front of him.\n\n\"Got some rough ideas drafted on the program,\" he told her. \"The\npossibilities of this thing are really unlimited. Granted, of course,\nthat there's money in this picture.\"\n\n\"There's money all right,\" Livia said. \"We don't have to worry about\nthat.\"\n\n\"Good. I've put down a list of leading citizens that might be enrolled\nas backers for anything we might come up with, people who have been\noutspoken about the expense or danger of space flight. We'll keep it on\nfile, and add to it as new names crop up in the press. Then here's a\nlisting of categories for us to develop subprograms around. Religious,\neconomic, social, medical--Medical's good. There's a heck of a lot of\nscare-value in stories about cosmic rays, alien diseases, plagues, zero\ngravity sickness, all that sort of thing. Sterility is a good gimmick;\nimpotence is even better.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLivia smiled. \"I know what you mean.\"\n\n\"Mmm. Come to think of it, we ought to set up a special\nwoman's-point-of-view program, too. That'll be worth plenty. Then\nthere's the tax question. We'll have to see what we can set up in\nWashington, some kind of anti-space lobby. Good feature story material\nhere, too. You know the stuff--one space vessel equals the cost of two\nhundred country hospitals.\"\n\n\"Sounds great.\"\n\n\"We'll have to plan on press parties, special stuff for the magazines\nand networks. I've got a plan for some Hollywood promotion to counteract\nall this Destination Space garbage they've been turning out. And as for\ntelevision--\"\n\nHe talked on for another hour, feeling mounting excitement for the job\nhe was doing. Tom wasn't sure that he liked the aims of Homelovers,\nIncorporated, but the challenge was enjoyable. Even at dinner that\nnight, in Livia's snug apartment, he rattled on about the PR program\nuntil the girl began to yawn.\n\nThe bedroom was still monochrome. Only Livia had transformed it\nmagically into powder blue. Tom slept blissfully until morning, and went\ninto the office that weekend for sheer love of what he was doing.\n\nAfter less than a month, his efforts started producing results. On a\ncrisp December morning, he found the following in his mail:\n\n                               _\"EARTH SONG\"\n                                A Screenplay\n                                     by\n                               Duncan Devine_\n\n    _Roger Tenblade, a dashing young rocket pilot in the UN Air Force,\n    yearns to join the Space Expeditionary Force now planning the first\n    landing and colonization of the planet Mars. Despite the protest of\n    his lovely fianc\u00e9e, Diane, he embarks upon the journey. The trip is\n    fraught with hazards, and the ship is struck by a meteor en route.\n    Every member of the crew is killed, except Roger, who heroically\n    brings the vessel back to home base. However, Roger is exposed to\n    large amounts of cosmic radiation. When he is so informed by the\n    medical authorities, he realizes that he can never make Diane a\n    normal husband. So rather than return to her and ruin her life, he\n    changes his identity and disappears to South America, where he takes\n    a job as a shuttle pilot for a third-class airline._\n\n    _Meanwhile, Diane marries Harold Farnsworth, scion of one of\n    America's wealthiest families ..._\n\nTom Blacker chuckled, and slipped the scenario back into the envelope.\nHe marked the manuscript \"O.K. for Production,\" and turned to the other\nmail.\n\nThere was the prospectus of a television series that sounded\ninteresting. He looked it over carefully.\n\n                              _\"CAPTAIN TERRA\"\n                        Half-hour Television Series\n                                 written by\n                               Craig Comfort_\n\n    _Captain Terra, and his Earth Cadets are dedicated to the principle\n    of \"Earth Above All\" and have sworn their lives to the preservation\n    of Earth and its peoples, and to the protection of Earth against the\n    hostile aliens constantly threatening the planet._\n\n                           _Program One, Act One_\n\n    _Bobby, Captain Terra's youthful aide, is attacked one day by a\n    strange creature which he describes as half-man, half-snake. He\n    reports the incident to Captain Terra, who calls a special session\n    of his Earth Patrol to determine how best to deal with this\n    enemy ..._\n\nTom read the prospectus through, and then dictated a letter to its\nproducers to call for an appointment.\n\nAt the bottom of the mail pile, he found an enthusiastic letter from a\ntheatrical producer named Homer Bradshaw, whom he had dealt with briefly\nduring his career at Ostreich and Company.\n\n    _Dear Tom,_\n\n    _Great to hear about your new connection! Have a fabulous gimmick\n    that ought to be right down your alley. Am thinking of producing a\n    new extravaganza entitled: \"Be It Ever So Humble.\"_\n\n    _This will be a real classy show, with plenty of chorus line and\n    top gags. We plan to kid the pants off this spaceman business, until\n    those bright boys in the glass hats cry uncle. I've already lined up\n    James Hocum for the top banana, and Sylvia Crowe for the female\n    lead. You know Sylvia, Tom; she'll make space flight sound about as\n    chic as a debutante's ball on the Staten Island Ferry. This is the\n    way to do the job, Tom--laugh 'em out of it._\n\n    _If you're interested in a piece of this, you can always reach me\n    at ..._\n\nHe was about to call it a day at five-thirty, when he got a visiphone\ncall from John Andrusco. When he walked into the immense office at the\nother end of the floor, he saw a glassy-eyed man standing at Andrusco's\ndesk, twirling his hat with nervous fingers.\n\n\"Tom,\" Andrusco said cheerfully, \"want you to meet somebody. This is\nSergeant Walt Spencer, formerly of the UN Space Commission.\"\n\nTom shook the man's hand, and he could feel it trembling in his own.\n\n\"I called Walt in here specially, thanks to that memo you sent me, Tom.\nGreat idea of yours, about talking to some of the boys who've actually\nbeen in space. Walter here's willing to cooperate a hundred percent.\"\n\n\"That's fine,\" Tom said uneasily.\n\n\"Thought you two ought to get together,\" Andrusco said, reaching for his\nhat. \"Think he can help a lot, Tom. Talk it over.\"\n\n\"Well--suppose we have a drink, Sergeant? That fit your plans all\nright?\"\n\n\"Suits me,\" the man said, without emotion.\n\nThey went down in the elevator together, and slid into a red-leather\nbooth in the Tuscany Bar in the base of the building. The sergeant\nordered a double Scotch, and gulped it with the same respect you give\nwater.\n\n\"So you've been in space,\" Tom said, looking at him curiously. \"Must\nhave been quite an experience.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"Er--I take it you've left the service.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\nTom frowned, and sipped his martini. \"How many trips did you make,\nSergeant?\"\n\n\"Just one. Reconnaissance Moon Flight Four. About six years ago. You\nmust have read about it.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Tom said. \"Sorry.\"\n\nThe man shrugged. \"Things happen. Even on Earth, things happen.\"\n\n\"Tell me something.\" Tom leaned forward. \"Is it true about--\" He paused,\nembarrassed. \"Well, you hear a lot of stories. But I understand some of\nthe men on that flight, the ones who got back all right, had children.\nAnd--well, you know how rumors go--\"\n\n\"Lies,\" Spencer said, without rancor. \"I've got two kids myself. Both of\n'em normal.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" Tom tried to hide his disappointment behind the cocktail glass. It\nwould have made great copy, if he could have proved the truth of the old\nrumor about two-headed babies. But what _could_ Sergeant Spencer do for\nthe PR program? Andrusco must have had something in mind.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe asked him point-blank.\n\n\"It's like this,\" the man said, his eyes distant. \"Since I quit the\nservice, I haven't been doin' so good. With jobs, I mean. And Mr.\nAndrusco--he said he'd give me five thousand dollars if I'd--help you\npeople.\"\n\n\"Did Mr. Andrusco describe this help?\"\n\n\"Yeah. He wants me to do a story. About the kid my wife had. The first\nkid.\"\n\n\"What about the first kid?\"\n\n\"Well, she died, the first kid did. In childbirth. It was something\nthat happens, you know. My wife's a little woman; the baby was\nsmothered.\"\n\n\"I see. And what kind of story do you want to tell?\"\n\n\"It's not my idea.\" A hint of stubbornness glimmered in his dull eyes.\n\"It's that Andrusco guy's. He wants me to tell how the baby was born\na--mutant.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"He wants me to release a story saying the baby was a freak. The kid was\nborn at home, you see. The only other person who saw her, besides me and\nmy wife, was this doctor we had. And he died a couple of years back.\"\n\nTom slumped in his chair. This was pushing public relations a little\nfar.\n\n\"Well, I dunno,\" he said. \"If the baby was really normal--\"\n\n\"It was normal, all right. Only dead, that's all.\"\n\nTom stood up. \"Okay, Sergeant Spencer. Let me think it over, and I'll\ngive you a buzz before the end of the week. All right?\"\n\n\"Anything you say, Chief.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the morning, Tom Blacker went storming into John Andrusco's plush\noffice.\n\n\"Now look, Mr. Andrusco. I don't mind slanting a story a little far. But\nthis Spencer story of yours is nothing but a hoax.\"\n\nAndrusco looked hurt. \"Did he tell you that? How do you like that\nnerve?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Why, that story's as genuine as gold. We've known about the freak birth\nfor a long time. Cosmic rays, you know. Those men on that reconnaissance\nflight really got bombarded.\"\n\nTom wasn't sure of himself. \"You mean, it's true?\"\n\n\"Of course it is! As a matter of fact, we've got a photograph of the\ndead baby, right after it was delivered. The doctor who attended Mrs.\nSpencer took it without their knowledge, as a medical curiosity. He sold\nit to us several years ago. We've never used it before, because we knew\nthat the Spencers would just deny it. Now that Walt's willing to\ncooperate ...\"\n\n\"Can I see the photo?\"\n\n\"Why, certainly.\" He opened the top drawer and handed a glossy print\nacross the desk. Tom looked at it, and winced.\n\n\"Scales!\" he said.\n\n\"Like a fish,\" Andrusco said sadly. \"Pretty sad, isn't it?\" He looked\nout of the window and sighed cavernously. \"It's a menacing world up\nthere....\"\n\nThe rest of the day was wasted. Tom Blacker's mind wasn't functioning\nright.\n\nHe told Livia about it at lunch.\n\nLivia Cord continued eating, chewing delicately on her food without\nflexing a muscle or wincing an eyebrow.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the Third of April, the story of Sergeant Walter Spencer's first-born\nmonster broke in newspapers, magazines, and telecasts across the\ncountry. It was a five-year-old story, but it carried too much\nsignificance for the space-minded present to be ignored.\n\nTwo days later, Sergeant Spencer, 32, and his wife, Laura, 30, were\nfound dead of asphyxiation in their new home in Greenwich, Connecticut.\nThe cause of death was listed as suicide.\n\nTom Blacker didn't hear the news until a day after it happened. He was\nin Washington, setting up a series of meetings with members of a House\ngroup investigating space flight expenditures. When he returned by\n'copter that evening, he found Police Commissioner Joe Stinson waiting\nfor him in Tom's own favorite chair.\n\nThe square, heavy-jowled face was strangely calm.\n\n\"Long time no see,\" he said mildly. \"You've been a busy man lately, Mr.\nBlacker.\"\n\n\"Hello, Mr. Stinson. Won't you come in?\"\n\n\"I'm in,\" the commissioner shrugged. \"Landlord let me wait here. It's\nchilly outside. Do you want the preliminaries, or should we have the\nmain bout?\"\n\n\"It's about Spencer, isn't it?\" Tom built himself a long drink. \"I heard\nabout it on the 'copter radio, flying in. Too bad. He was a nice guy; I\nnever met his wife.\"\n\n\"But you knew him, right? In fact, you and the sergeant did a lot of\nbusiness together?\"\n\n\"Look, Mr. Stinson. You know what kind of job I'm trying to do. It's no\nsecret. Spencer's story happened to gear in nicely with our public\nrelations effort. And that's all.\"\n\n\"Maybe it is.\" The commissioner's eyes hardened. \"Only some of us aren't\nsatisfied. Some of us are kinda restless about the coroner's verdict.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"You heard me. It's fishy, you know? Nice young couple buys a new house,\nthen turns on the gas. Leave behind a couple of kids, too. Boys, nice\nboys.\"\n\n\"I couldn't feel worse about it,\" Tom said glumly. \"In a way, I can\nalmost feel responsible ...\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"I dunno. They were perfectly willing to release that story about their\nfirst-born. But maybe when they actually saw it in print, they couldn't\nstand the spotlight--\"\n\n\"And that's your theory?\"\n\n\"Yes. But I hope I'm wrong, Mr. Stinson. For my own sake.\"\n\nThe commissioner drew a folded sheet of paper out of his pocket.\n\n\"Let me read you something. This hasn't been released to the press, and\nmaybe it won't be. Interested?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"It's a letter. A letter that was never mailed. It's addressed to Tom\nBlacker, care of Homelovers, Incorporated, 320 Fifth-Madison, New York.\"\n\n\"What?\" Tom reached for it.\n\n\"Uh-uh. It was never mailed, so it's not your property. But I'll read it\nto you.\" He slipped on a pair of bifocals.\n\n    _Dear Mr. Blacker. I've been trying to reach you all week, but\n    you've been out of town. Laura and I have just seen the first news\n    story about our baby, and we're just sick about it. Why didn't you\n    tell us about that photograph you were going to print? If we had\n    known about that, we never would have consented to doing what you\n    wanted. My wife never gave birth to that damned thing, and I don't\n    care who knows it. I've called Mr. Andrusco to tell him that we\n    don't want any part of this business any more. I'd send you back\n    every penny of the five thousand dollars, only we've already spent\n    half of it. I'm going to call the newspapers and tell them\n    everything ..._\n\nThe commissioner paused. \"It goes on for another half page. But no use\nreading any more. I'd like a reaction, Mr. Blacker. Got one handy?\"\n\nTom was on his feet.\n\n\"I don't believe it!\" His fist thudded into his palm. \"The letter's a\nfake!\"\n\n\"That's easy to prove, Mr. Blacker.\"\n\n\"But the picture was genuine! Don't you see that? Sure, we paid Spencer\nsomething for his cooperation. But the picture was the real thing, taken\nby his family doctor. You've heard what the medical authorities said\nabout it.\"\n\nStinson said nothing. Then he got up slowly and walked to the door.\n\n\"Maybe so. But you're missing the point I want to make, Mr. Blacker.\nThis letter was dated the same day as the Spencer suicides. Does it\nsound to you like the kind of thing a man would put in a suicide note?\nThink it over.\"\n\nTom looked at the door the commissioner closed behind him.\n\n\"No,\" he said aloud. \"It doesn't.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTom didn't go to the Homelovers building the next morning. He proceeded\ndirectly to the Lunt Theatre, where Homer Bradshaw was putting _Be It\nEver So Humble_ into rehearsal.\n\nHe was in no mood for the theatre, but the appointment had been made too\nlong before. When he came through the doors of the theatre, Homer leaped\nhalfway up the aisle to greet him, and pounded his back like a long-lost\npal. Actually, he had met the producer only twice before.\n\n\"Great to have you here, Tom!\" he said enthusiastically. \"Great! We've\njust been putting things together. Got some red-hot numbers we had\nwritten specially for us. Wait 'til you hear 'em!\" He waved towards the\ntwo shirtsleeved men hovering around the on-stage piano. \"You know\nJulie, don't you? And Milt Steiner? Great team! Great team!\"\n\nThey took seats in the sixth row while Homer raved about the forthcoming\nproduction that was going to cost Homelovers, Incorporated some hundred\nthousand dollars. A dozen shapely girls in shorts and leotards were\nkicking their heels lackadaisically in the background, and a stout man\nwith a wild checkered suit was wandering around the stage with an unlit\ncigar in his hand, begging the stagehands for a match.\n\n\"Hey, fellas!\" Homer Bradshaw called to the men at the piano. \"Run\nthrough that _Gypsy_ number for Mr. Blacker, huh?\"\n\nThey came to life like animated dolls. The tallest of the pair stepped\nin front of the stage while the other thumped the piano keys. The tall\none sang in a loud nasal voice, with an abundance of gestures.\n\n    \"_Gypsy!\n    Gypsy!\n    Why do you have to be a gypsy?\n    Life could be so ipsy-pipsy\n    Staying home and getting tipsy\n    Safe on Earth with me!_\"\n\nHe swung into the second chorus while Tom Blacker kept his face from\nshowing his true opinion of the specialty number. The next offering\ndidn't change his viewpoint. It was a ballad. A blonde girl in clinging\nblack shorts sang it feelingly.\n\n    \"_There's a beautiful Earth tonight\n    With a beautiful mellow light\n    Shining on my spaceman in the moon.\n    Why did he leave me?\n    Only to grieve me?\n    Spaceman, come home to me soon ..._\"\n\n\"Did you like it? Did you like it?\" Homer Bradshaw said eagerly.\n\n\"It'll do fine,\" Tom Blacker said, with his teeth clenched.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen he left the theatre, Tom visiphoned the office to tell Livia that\nhe was taking the rest of the day off. But he found that Livia herself\nwas spending the day in her two-room apartment downtown. He hung up, and\ndecided that he had to talk to her about Stinson's visit. He hopped a\ncab, and gave him Livia's address.\n\nJohn Andrusco answered the door.\n\n\"Well! Thought you were at the office, Tom?\"\n\nHe found himself glaring at the lean-jawed executive. What was Andrusco\ndoing here?\n\n\"I've been over at the theatre,\" Tom explained. \"Watching that musical\nwe're spending all that dough on.\" He stepped inside. \"I might say the\nsame about you, Mr. Andrusco.\"\n\n\"Me? Oh, I just came to talk over some business with Livia. Poor kid's\nnot feeling so hot, you know.\"\n\n\"No, I didn't.\" He dropped his hat familiarly on the contour couch, with\nalmost too much deliberation. \"Livia in bed?\"\n\n\"No.\" The girl appeared at the door of the bedroom, wrapping a\npowder-blue negligee around her. \"What brings you here, Tom?\"\n\n\"I--I wanted to talk something over with you. Now that you're here, Mr.\nAndrusco, we can _all_ talk it over.\"\n\n\"What's that?\" Andrusco made himself at home at the bar.\n\n\"It's about Walt Spencer. I had a visitor last night, the police\ncommissioner. He showed me a letter that Spencer had written just before\nhe--before he died. It was addressed to me, only Spencer had never\nmailed it.\"\n\nAndrusco looked sharply at the girl. \"And what was in this letter?\"\n\n\"He was upset,\" Tom said. \"He wanted to back out of the deal we made.\nSaid the picture was a phoney. But the thing that's bothering the police\nis the _tone_ of the damned letter. It just doesn't sound like a man\nabout to kill himself and his wife--\"\n\n\"Is that all?\" Livia took the drink from Andrusco's hand and sipped at\nit. \"I thought it was something serious.\"\n\n\"It is serious!\" Tom looked sternly at her. \"I want to know something,\nMr. Andrusco. You told me that picture was genuine. Now I want you to\ntell me again.\"\n\nThe man smiled, with perfect teeth. \"How do you mean, genuine? Is it a\npicture of a genuine infant with scales?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I assure you. In that respect, the picture is absolutely genuine.\"\n\nTom thought it over.\n\n\"Wait a while. Was the story genuine, too?\"\n\nJohn Andrusco smiled. He sat on the sofa, and rubbed the palms of his\nhands over his knees. Then he looked towards Livia Cord and said:\n\n\"Well--I didn't think we could hold out on our clever Mr. Blacker as\nlong as we have. So we might as well enlist his cooperation fully. Eh,\nLivia?\"\n\n\"I think so.\" The girl smiled, her teeth sharp.\n\n\"What does that mean?\" Tom said.\n\n\"The infant,\" John Andrusco answered slowly, \"was not Walter Spencer's\nchild. That, I'm afraid, was nothing more than a little white lie.\"\n\nTom looked confused.\n\n\"Then what was it?\"\n\nLivia finished her drink.\n\n\"It was my child.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe man and the woman, whose grins now seemed permanently affixed to\ntheir faces, were forced to wait a considerable amount of time before\nTom Blacker was both ready and able to listen to their explanation.\n\nLivia did most of the talking.\n\n\"You'll probably be horrified at all this,\" she said, with a trace of\namusement around her red mouth. \"Particularly since you and I have\nbeen--\" She paused, and looked towards Andrusco with a slight lift of\nher shoulder. \"Well, you know. But you needn't feel too squeamish, Tom.\nAfter all, I was born and raised on Earth. I am, you might say, an\nhonorary Earth woman.\"\n\nTom's eyes bulged at her.\n\n\"This civilization from which my husband and I claim ancestry is perhaps\nno older than your own. Unfortunately, we were not blessed with a\nplanetary situation as agreeable as Earth's. Our sun is far feebler, the\norbital paths of our moons act drastically upon our waters, causing\ngenerations of drought and centuries of flood ...\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" Tom said hoarsely.\n\n\"I speak of home,\" Livia Cord said. And her eyes gleamed.\n\n\"Antamunda is the name we give it,\" John Andrusco said cordially. \"A\nworld very much like your own in size and atmosphere, Mr. Blacker. But\ntragically, a world whose usefulness has been gradually coming to an\nend. Our ancestors, who were scientists of much ability, foresaw this\nsome hundreds of years ago. Since that time, they have been seeking a\nsolution to the problem.\"\n\n\"I don't believe this!\"\n\n\"We have,\" Livia said carefully, \"excellent evidence.\"\n\n\"Some five hundred years ago,\" Andrusco continued, \"our people\ndespatched an exploratory space vessel. A home-hunting force, seeking to\nrelocate the surviving members of our race. It was a long, trying\nodyssey, but it finally culminated in the selection of a new home. I\nneedn't tell you that the home is in your own solar system.\"\n\nTom shot to his feet. \"You mean Earth? You mean you want to take over\nhere--\"\n\nAndrusco looked shocked. \"Certainly not! What a violent thought, Mr.\nBlacker!\"\n\n\"The planet you call Mars,\" Livia said coolly, \"was the selected\ndestination. A planet with only limited facilities for the support of\nlife. But a planet even more like our own dying world than Earth, Mr.\nBlacker. So you needn't cry havoc about alien invaders.\" She laughed\nsharply.\n\n\"Then what are you doing here?\"\n\n\"Merely waiting,\" Andrusco said. \"We are the offspring of the surviving\nmembers of the expeditionary force from Antamunda, placed here on Earth\nas a vanguard of the immigration that will shortly take place to this\nsystem. But your own world is in no danger, Mr. Blacker. That you must\nbelieve. Physically, our people are not your equals. Scientifically, we\nare advanced in certain fields and shamefully backwards in others.\nBiologically--\" He frowned. \"This is our greatest weakness. To the\nAntamundans, your breeding capacity is nothing short of grotesque.\" His\nhandsome lip curled. He enjoyed watching Tom's reaction.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTom swallowed hard. \"How long have you been here?\"\n\n\"Some four generations have been born here. Our duty has been merely to\nawait the arrival of our people. But in the last fifty years, we found\nourselves faced with another obligation. It was that obligation which\nbrought about the formation of Homelovers, Incorporated.\"\n\n\"I don't understand.\"\n\n\"We had underestimated the science of Earth. Our own necessity drove us\ntowards the perfection of space flight. Earth had no such urgency. But\nnow--\" Livia looked mournful. \"Now we were faced with the possibility\nthat Mars would soon be a colony of your own planet, before our people\nhad a chance to make it their rightful home. You can see the\nconsequences of that. A conflict of interests, a question of territorial\nrights. Even the possibility of an interplanetary war--\"\n\n\"War!\"\n\n\"A possibility greatly to be abhorred,\" Andrusco said. \"And one we were\nsure we could eliminate, if we could merely _delay_ the colonization of\nMars.\"\n\n\"Don't you see?\" Livia said earnestly. \"If we could make Mars our\nnatural home, then the people of Earth would come to us as friendly\nvisitors--or invaders, whichever they prefer. But if we arrived too\nlate-- No, Tom. We feel that it is imperative--to the peace of _both_\nour worlds--that Antamunda reach Mars first.\"\n\n\"Then it's a race!\" Tom was bewildered.\n\n\"You may call it that. But a race we are determined to win. And we\n_will_ win!\"\n\nTom thought of another question.\n\n\"The infant,\" he said. \"The creature with scales ...\"\n\n\"It was mine,\" the girl said sadly. \"Born to John and me some ten years\nago. Unfortunately, it did not live. And while your Earth eyes may\nconsider it a creature--\" She drew herself up proudly. \"It was a\nperfectly formed Antamundan child.\"\n\nTom gaped at her.\n\n\"No,\" she said, answering the question in his gaze. \"You are looking at\nus as we are. We lose our scales after our infancy, when our mouths are\nformed ...\"\n\nAfter a while, Tom asked:\n\n\"And what about Spencer?\"\n\n\"Unfortunate,\" the man said. \"His betrayal to the press would have done\nus incalculable harm. It was necessary to do what we did.\"\n\n\"Then you did kill them?\"\n\nLivia turned her head aside.\n\n\"And you think I'll stand for that?\" Tom said.\n\n\"Perhaps not,\" Andrusco said. \"But frankly--I don't really know what you\ncan do about it. Except, of course, repeat this explanation to the\nauthorities. You're free to do that, Tom. Any time at all.\" He smiled,\nslyly.\n\n\"You think they won't believe me?\"\n\nLivia came over to Tom's chair, and slithered one arm around his\nshoulder.\n\n\"Why, Tom, darling. Are you so sure that _you_ believe it?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe left the apartment some ten minutes later, and took a cab to 320\nFifth-Madison. It was almost five o'clock, and the steel-and-glass\ncylinder was emptying rapidly of its Homelovers employees. He watched\nthe stream of ordinary people stepping off the elevators: the young\nsecretaries with their fresh faces and slim figures, laughing at office\nanecdotes and sharing intimate confidences about office bachelors; the\nsmooth-cheeked young executives, in their gray and blue suits, gripping\nwell-stocked brief cases, and striding energetically down the lobby,\nheading for the commuter trains; the paunchy, dignified men with their\ngray temples and gleaming spectacles, walking slowly to the exits,\nquoting stock prices and planning golf dates.\n\nThe crowd eddied about him like a battling current as he made his way\ntowards the elevators, and their images swam before his face in\npink-and-white blurs. And for one terrible moment, in the thickest\nvortex of the crowd, he began to imagine that the faces were melting\nbefore his eyes, the mouths disappearing into the flesh, and below the\nwhite collars and black-knit ties and starched pink blouses appeared a\nshimmering collection of ugly scales.\n\nHe shuddered, and stepped into an empty car, punching the button that\nshot him to the executive floor of the Homelovers Building.\n\nIn his office, he switched on the visiphone and made contact with a\nsquare-faced man who frowned mightily when he recognized his caller.\n\n\"What do you want?\" Stinson said.\n\n\"I have to see you,\" Tom told him. \"I learned something this afternoon,\nabout Walt Spencer. I don't know whether you'll believe it or not, but I\nhave to take that chance. Will you talk to me?\"\n\n\"All right. But we'll have to make it down here.\"\n\n\"I'll be there in an hour. I want to organize a few things first. Then\nwe can talk.\"\n\nTom switched off, and began to empty his desk. He found nothing in the\nofficial communications of the Homelovers that would substantiate his\nstory, but he continued to gather what information he could about the PR\nprogram.\n\nHe was just clicking the locks on his brief case, when a gray-haired\nwoman with a pencil thrust into her curls popped her head in the\ndoorway.\n\n\"Mr. Blacker?\" she smiled. \"I'm Dora, Mr. Wright's secretary. Mr. Wright\nwants to know if you'll stop in to see him.\"\n\n\"Wright?\" Tom said blankly.\n\n\"The treasurer. His office is just down the hall. He's very anxious to\nsee you, something about the expense sheets you turned in last week.\"\n\nTom frowned. \"Why don't I see him in the morning?\"\n\n\"It won't take but a minute.\"\n\n\"All right.\"\n\nHe sighed, picked up the brief case, and followed Dora outside. She\nshowed him the door of an office some thirty paces from his own, and he\nentered without knocking.\n\nA frail man, with a bald head and a squiggly moustache, stood up behind\nhis desk.\n\n\"Oh, dear,\" he said nervously. \"I'm terribly sorry to do this, Mr.\nBlacker. But I have my instructions.\"\n\n\"Do what?\"\n\n\"Oh, dear,\" Mr. Wright said again.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe took the gun that was lying in his out-box, and fired it. His\ntrembling hand sent the bullet spanging into the wooden frame of the\ndoor. Tom dropped to the thick carpet, and then scrambled to the tall\ncredenza set against the right wall of the office. He shoved it aside\nwith his left hand and ducked behind it. The treasurer came out from\nbehind his desk, still muttering to himself.\n\n\"Please,\" he said in anguish, \"this is very painful for me!\"\n\nHe fired the gun again, and the bullet tore a white hole in the wall\nabove Tom's head.\n\n\"Don't be so difficult,\" the little man pleaded. \"Sooner or later--\"\n\nBut Tom insisted upon being difficult. His fingers closed around a loose\nvolume of New York State Tax Laws, and jiggled it in readiness. When the\nlittle treasurer came closer, he sprung from hiding and hurled the book.\nIt slammed against Wright's side, and surprised him enough to send the\narm holding the weapon into the air. That was the advantage Tom wanted.\nHe leaped in a low-flying tackle, and brought Wright to the carpet. Then\nhe was on top of the little man, grappling for the gun. Tom fought hard\nto get the gun.\n\nHe got it, but not before it was fired again.\n\nTom looked down at the widening stain that was marring the smooth\ntexture of the carpet and was horrified. He bent down over the frail\nfigure, lifting the bald head in his hands.\n\n\"Mr. Wright!\"\n\nThe treasurer groaned. \"Sorry,\" he said. \"Instructions, Mr. Blacker ...\"\n\n\"From whom? Andrusco?\"\n\n\"Yes ... Your message reported from switchboard ... had orders ...\"\n\n\"Is it true?\" Tom said frantically. \"About Antamunda? Is the story\ntrue?\"\n\nThe little man nodded. Then he lifted one hand feebly towards the desk.\n\"Gary,\" he said. \"Tell Gary ...\"\n\nTom looked in the direction of the gesture, and saw the back of a framed\nphotograph.\n\nWhen he turned to the treasurer again, the thin lips had stopped moving.\n\nHe lowered the body to the floor and went to the desk. The photo was\nthat of a young man with stiff-bristled blond hair and a rugged smile.\nThe inscription read:\n\n    \"_To Pop, with deep affection, Gary._\"\n\nTom shook his head, wonderingly. Were these creatures so very different?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen Tom stepped out on Fifth-Madison some ten minutes later, it was\njust in time to watch a police vehicle draw up to the entrance of 320.\nSensing danger, he stepped into the shade of the Tuscany Bar awning, and\nwatched the uniformed men pound their way down the marbled lobby floor\ntowards the elevators. He thought fast, and decided that the arrival of\nthe police was connected with the shooting in Wright's office.\n\nThe question was--who were they after?\n\nHe walked into the Tuscany, and headed for the bank of visiphone booths.\nHe dialed the police commissioner, but ducked out of the path of the\nvisiphone eye.\n\nStinson growled at the blank screen. \"Who is it?\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" Tom said, muffling his voice. \"But if you want the killers\nof Walt Spencer and his wife, pick up John Andrusco and a gal named\nLivia Cord.\"\n\n\"Okay, Blacker,\" Stinson thundered. \"I knew you'd be calling in.\"\n\nTom swore, and showed himself. \"Listen, I'm telling you the truth. They\ntold me the whole story. Then they tried to have me killed.\"\n\n\"Is that so? And I suppose the assassin was a guy named Wright?\"\n\n\"Yes!\"\n\n\"Okay, wise guy. We're on to you. You've been pocketing some of that\nHomelovers dough, and the treasurer found you out. Isn't that the\nstory?\"\n\n\"No! Wright's one of _them_.\"\n\n\"Sure, pal. Whatever you say. Only stay right where you are so you can\ndo your explaining proper.\"\n\nTom tightened his lips. \"Uh-huh. I don't like the sound of things. I'll\nsee you later, Mr. Stinson.\"\n\n\"Blacker!\"\n\nTom switched off.\n\nBy the time he was settled behind the red neck of a cab-driver, Tom was\nwiping a dripping film of sweat from his forehead. He couldn't return to\nhis apartment; there was bound to be a stake-out. He couldn't go to\nLivia's; that would be walking right into danger. And he couldn't go to\nStinson, without risking a murder charge.\n\nHe leaned forward.\n\n\"Driver--make that the LaGuardia Heliport.\"\n\nHowever efficient Stinson's operations might have been, their tentacles\nhadn't reached the 'copter-rental station at the heliport. Tom signed\nout a speedy vessel under an assumed name, and taxied it down the\nrunway. Then he pointed the nose west, and radioed ahead to his\ndestination at Washington, D. C.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nColonel Grady Mordigan had the thoughtful air of a scholar and the body\nof a college wrestler. When Tom Blacker's name was announced to him, his\nmouth turned down grimly. He was commanding officer of the Space Flight\nCommission of the UN Air Force, and he had good reason to frown at the\nsound of the PR man's name.\n\nBut he invited him into his office.\n\n\"So you're Tom Blacker,\" he said, pinching his jaw. \"I've heard a lot\nabout you, Mr. Blacker.\"\n\n\"I'm sure,\" Tom said. \"Only I want to tell you this, Colonel. I've\nbroken my connection with Homelovers. I'm on your side now.\"\n\n\"Side? There are no sides in this issue, Mr. Blacker. As far as I'm\nconcerned, Homelovers is nothing but a flea on the lip of a lion. A\ndamned annoying flea, maybe--but nothing more than that. Now what do you\nwant?\"\n\n\"I have to talk to you about something. Something I just found out. Will\nyou listen to me?\"\n\nThe colonel leaned back, looking at his watch.\n\n\"Five minutes,\" he snapped.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTom talked for fifteen. Mordigan didn't call a halt until he was\nfinished, listening without a change of expression. When Tom ran out of\nwords, he merely tapped his fingers on the desk.\n\n\"And that's your whole story?\" he said gently.\n\n\"Yes, sir. I know it's a wild one. That's one of the things they're\ncounting on. It's just wild enough to get me put into a laughing\nacademy, where I can't do them any mischief. But I had to take that\nchance, Colonel.\"\n\n\"I see. And this--man you killed. What's happening about that?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Tom said. \"The way I figure it, Andrusco and the girl\nhave told the police that I was embezzling money from the firm--that I\nkilled the treasurer for my own protection. But it's not true! He's one\nof _them_--one of those creatures--\"\n\n\"But you have no real proof?\"\n\nTom's back stiffened. \"No,\" he said grimly. \"If I had proof, I'd have\ngone to the police. But I came here instead. Now you can tell me if I\ndid the right thing.\"\n\nMordigan grimaced. \"I don't know, damn it! I don't have any love for the\nHomelovers. To me, they've always been a bunch of greedy businessmen,\nintent on salvaging their franchises at any expense. But it's not easy to\nthink of them as a bunch of--\" His mouth twisted. \"Loathsome aliens ...\"\n\n\"Maybe not so loathsome,\" Tom said miserably. \"I just don't know. Maybe\ntheir cause is as just to them as ours is to us. But they're determined\nto reach Mars before we do--before you do! And they'll do anything to\nmake sure--\"\n\nThe colonel stood up. \"But I'm afraid that question is academic, Mr.\nBlacker. Because if our calculations are right, an Earth vessel will be\non the planet Mars within the next thirty-six hours.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"No announcement has been made. But a Mars-bound ship was launched\nalmost a month ago, containing seven members of the space commission.\nOur last radio contact with Captain Wright leads us to expect--\"\n\n\"_Who?_\" Tom was on his feet.\n\n\"Captain Gary Wright, the commander of the ship.\" His brow knitted.\n\"Why? Do you know him?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure,\" Tom said weakly. \"But if he's the same man--then that\nflight's in danger.\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTom concluded his story about the death of the Homelovers treasurer,\ndown to the last detail of the framed photograph on Wright's desk. The\ntale brought Colonel Mordigan into immediate action. He buzzed for his\norderly, and in another minute, was fumbling through a folder marked\nClassified.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said numbly. \"It's the same man. Father's named Benjamin\nWright, and he's vice-president and treasurer of Homelovers,\nIncorporated. I never connected the two ...\" He looked up, his eyes\nheavy. \"If your story is true, Mr. Blacker, then Captain Wright is one\nof these so-called Antamundans. And if their mission is what you say it\nis--\"\n\nTom clenched his fists on the blotter. \"Please, sir! Let me stay here\nuntil the flight is concluded. After that, you can do what you like.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Mordigan said wearily. \"I'll fix you up with something in\nthe officer's quarters. But I'm sure you're wrong, Mr. Blacker. You\n_have_ to be.\"\n\nTwenty-four hours later, radio contact with the Mars expeditionary ship\nceased abruptly.\n\nFrom Mt. Wilson observatory, a hurried message arrived, reporting a\nsmall, brief nova in the orbital vicinity of the planet Mars.\n\nTom Blacker, dozing fitfully on a cot in the quarters of a grumpy\nLieutenant-Colonel, was awakened suddenly, and summoned to the office of\nColonel Grady Mordigan.\n\n\"Very well, Mr. Blacker,\" the colonel said stiffly. \"I'm willing to\nhelp. Just tell me what you want me to do.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe receptionist smiled icily at Tom, and then the smile vanished like a\nMartian polar cap.\n\n\"Why--Mr. Blacker!\"\n\n\"Hi, Stella,\" he grinned. \"Mr. Andrusco in his office?\"\n\n\"Why, I don't know. Suppose I give him a ring--\"\n\nHe stopped the hand that was reaching for the telephone. \"No need of\nthat. I think I'll just surprise him. After all, it's been some time.\"\n\nHe turned the knob of John Andrusco's door slowly.\n\nLivia was with him. When he entered, they both stood up hastily, their\neyes wide and their mouths unhinged.\n\nLivia reacted first. She cried out his name, and then sat down heavily,\nas if the words had been a physical force.\n\n\"Hi, Livia,\" Tom said casually. \"Good to see you again, Mr. Andrusco.\nSorry that I haven't been around--but things have been pretty hectic for\nme lately.\"\n\n\"How did you get here?\" Andrusco's voice was choked.\n\n\"I've been here all weekend, if you want to know.\" Tom seated himself\nblithely. \"As a matter of fact, the Homelovers Building has had quite a\nlot of visitors this weekend.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"You know the staff of cleaning personnel that invades this place every\nSaturday? Well, there were some changes made this particular weekend.\nI'm sure you'll be interested in hearing about them.\"\n\nLivia said: \"Shall I call the police, John?\"\n\n\"The police were represented,\" Tom said. \"Don't worry about that. In\nfact, the top technicians from three government agencies were doing the\nhousework around here this weekend, Mr. Andrusco. They probably didn't\nget the building much cleaner--but they swept up a lot of other things.\nYes, they certainly uncovered other things.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAndrusco walked over to Livia, and touched her shoulder in a comforting\ngesture. The sight of them made Tom scowl.\n\n\"All right!\" he said roughly. \"I'm not blaming you for what you're\ndoing. But things were getting out of hand, Mr. Andrusco. That's why we\nhad to put a stop to it.\"\n\n\"And have you?\" Andrusco asked politely.\n\n\"I'm afraid so. It was quite a shock, let me tell you. We didn't know\nwhat to expect when we dissected this building of yours. But the last\nthing we expected to find was--a spaceship.\"\n\nAndrusco smiled. \"It was cleverly done. You'll have to admit that.\"\n\n\"I do,\" Tom said fervently. \"You've got those space flight experts\nabsolutely insane with curiosity. They'll want to hear the whole story.\nWill you give it to them?\"\n\nThe man shrugged. \"It doesn't matter, I suppose. I presume the engines\nhave been dismantled?\"\n\n\"Made inoperable, yes. It would have been a great trick, if you could\nhave done it.\"\n\nLivia spoke sadly. \"It was the only thing we could have done. There's no\nplace on this Earth where we could have erected a spaceship without\nbeing observed. So we created this building. In time, we would have\nperfected the mechanism and left this silly planet of yours.\"\n\n\"That's what I don't understand,\" Tom said. \"What about Antamunda--and\nthe survivors--\"\n\n\"There's no longer an Antamunda,\" John Andrusco said hollowly. \"The\nstory we told you was true in its essence, but not, I'm afraid complete.\nYou see, the exodus that took place five hundred years ago was a total\nexodus. The entire population of our world--a handful, a pitiful ragged\nthousand--left Antamunda for this planet. We thought to make it our new\nhome, for all eternity. But in time, we learned that we had emigrated to\nan extinction just as certain.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"This world is cursed to us, Mr. Blacker. I can't tell you why. We breed\nslowly, infrequently--you might even say, thoughtfully. And on your\nplanet, but one child in a thousand has survived the rigors of\nchildbirth on Earth.\" He looked at Livia, and the woman lowered her eyes\nin remembered sorrow.\n\n\"That's why we had to leave,\" Andrusco said. \"To repopulate elsewhere.\nWe chose the planet Mars, and we were determined to make it our home\nbefore your world claimed it. Our scientists and technicians have worked\non nothing else but this flight since the beginning of the last century.\nThis building--this vessel--was the culmination of our plans. In another\nfew years, we would have been ready. The dream would have been\nrealized.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTom walked to the window of the office, and looked out at a bank of\nswift-moving clouds drifting past the spire of the Homelovers Building.\n\n\"I'm afraid that's the saddest part,\" he said. \"The atomic engines in\nthe basement have been examined, Mr. Andrusco. The best opinions say\nthat they're pitifully inadequate. The men who studied them say that you\nwould never have made the journey in safety.\"\n\n\"That can't be true! In time--\"\n\n\"In time, perhaps. But since your landing here, your scientists have\nforgotten a great deal about space flight. I'm afraid you would have\nnever reached that Promised Land ...\"\n\nAndrusco said: \"Then we must die ...\"\n\n\"No!\" Tom said.\n\nLivia looked at him.\n\n\"I said no!\" he repeated. \"The Antamundans can live. Don't you see\nthat?\"\n\n\"No,\" Andrusco said, shaking his head. \"On Earth, we shall die. If Mars\nis closed to us ...\"\n\n\"Can't you see? If Mars can be opened for Earth, then it can be opened\nfor you, too. For all Antamundans! Your people can make the journey,\ntoo, once space has been cleared for Earth ships. You can still have\nyour new home!\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" Livia said dreamily. \"Perhaps that is the only way. But by\nthen, Tom, it will be already too late. There has been no living child\nborn to us in the last ten years. By the time the Earth people reach\nMars and establish regular passageway--we will be too old to keep the\nrace alive.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Then let's speed it up!\" he said. \"Let's make _sure_ that the space\nlanes open! Let's do everything to make Space the most important project\non Earth!\"\n\n\"But how?\" Andrusco said, bewildered.\n\nTom went to the visiphone.\n\n\"Get me the Lunt Theatre!\" he snapped.\n\nHomer Bradshaw's face appeared.\n\n\"Mr. Bradshaw?\"\n\n\"Hi, Tom! How's the boy?\"\n\n\"Great, Homer, great. Only listen. I got a new angle for you. We're\ngonna doctor up that show of yours before the opening. Don't worry about\nthe dough-- Homelovers will take care of it with pleasure.\"\n\n\"Sure, Tom! Anything you say!\"\n\n\"Then take this down. The first thing we're changing is the title. From\nnow on it's _Mars Or Bust_ ...\"\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ December 1957.\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
