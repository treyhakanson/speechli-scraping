SIMAK\n\n                       Illustrated by DON HUNTER\n\n           [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n                 Galaxy Science Fiction February 1951.\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n\n\n\n\n          Achieving immortality is only half of the problem.\n          The other half is knowing how to live with it once\n               it's been made possible--and inescapable!\n\n\nYou did not die.\n\nThere was no normal way to die.\n\nYou lived as carelessly and as recklessly as you could and you hoped\nthat you would be lucky and be accidentally killed.\n\nYou kept on living and you got tired of living.\n\n\"God, how tired a man can get of living!\" Andrew Young said.\n\nJohn Riggs, chairman of the immortality commission, cleared his throat.\n\n\"You realize,\" he said to Andrew Young, \"that this petition is a highly\nirregular procedure to bring to our attention.\"\n\nHe picked up the sheaf of papers off the table and ruffled through them\nrapidly.\n\n\"There is no precedent,\" he added.\n\n\"I had hoped,\" said Andrew Young, \"to establish precedent.\"\n\nCommissioner Stanford said, \"I must admit that you have made a good\ncase, Ancestor Young. Yet you must realize that this commission has no\npossible jurisdiction over the life of any person, except to see that\neveryone is assured of all the benefits of immortality and to work out\nany kinks that may show up.\"\n\n\"I am well aware of that,\" answered Young, \"and it seems to me that my\ncase is one of the kinks you mention.\"\n\nHe stood silently, watching the faces of the members of the board.\nThey are afraid, he thought. Every one of them. Afraid of the day they\nwill face the thing I am facing now. They have sought an answer and\nthere is no answer yet except the pitifully basic answer, the brutally\nfundamental answer that I have given them.\n\n\"My request is simple,\" he told them, calmly. \"I have asked for\npermission to discontinue life. And since suicide has been made\npsychologically impossible, I have asked that this commission appoint\na panel of next-friends to make the necessary and somewhat distasteful\narrangements to bring about the discontinuance of my life.\"\n\n\"If we did,\" said Riggs, \"we would destroy everything we have. There\nis no virtue in a life of only five thousand years. No more than in\na life of only a hundred years. If Man is to be immortal, he must be\ngenuinely immortal. He cannot compromise.\"\n\n\"And yet,\" said Young, \"my friends are gone.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe gestured at the papers Riggs held in his hands. \"I have them listed\nthere,\" he said. \"Their names and when and where and how they died.\nTake a look at them. More than two hundred names. People of my own\ngeneration and of the generations closely following mine. Their names\nand the photo-copies of their death certificates.\"\n\nHe put both of his hands upon the table, palms flat against the table,\nand leaned his weight upon his arms.\n\n\"Take a look at how they died,\" he said. \"Every one involves accidental\nviolence. Some of them drove their vehicles too fast and, more than\nlikely, very recklessly. One fell off a cliff when he reached down to\npick a flower that was growing on its edge. A case of deliberately poor\njudgment, to my mind. One got stinking drunk and took a bath and passed\nout in the tub. He drowned....\"\n\n\"Ancestor Young,\" Riggs said sharply, \"you are surely not implying\nthese folks were suicides.\"\n\n\"No,\" Andrew Young said bitterly. \"We abolished suicide three thousand\nyears ago, cleared it clean out of human minds. How could they have\nkilled themselves?\"\n\nStanford said, peering up at Young, \"I believe, sir, you sat on the\nboard that resolved that problem.\"\n\nAndrew Young nodded. \"It was after the first wave of suicides. I\nremember it quite well. It took years of work. We had to change human\nperspective, shift certain facets of human nature. We had to condition\nhuman reasoning by education and propaganda and instill a new set of\nmoral values. I think we did a good job of it. Perhaps too good a job.\nToday a man can no more think of deliberately committing suicide than\nhe could think of overthrowing our government. The very idea, the very\nword is repulsive, instinctively repulsive. You can come a long way,\ngentlemen, in three thousand years.\"\n\nHe leaned across the table and tapped the sheaf of papers with a lean,\ntense finger.\n\n\"They didn't kill themselves,\" he said. \"They did not commit suicide.\nThey just didn't give a damn. They were tired of living ... as I am\ntired of living. So they lived recklessly in every way. Perhaps there\nalways was a secret hope that they would drown while drunk or their car\nwould hit a tree or....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe straightened up and faced them. \"Gentlemen,\" he said. \"I am 5,786\nyears of age. I was born at Lancaster, Maine, on the planet Earth on\nSeptember 21, 1968. I have served humankind well in those fifty-seven\ncenturies. My record is there for you to see. Boards, commissions,\nlegislative posts, diplomatic missions. No one can say that I have\nshirked my duty. I submit that I have paid any debt I owe humanity ...\neven the well-intentioned debt for a chance at immortality.\"\n\n\"We wish,\" said Riggs, \"that you would reconsider.\"\n\n\"I am a lonely man,\" replied Young. \"A lonely man and tired. I have no\nfriends. There is nothing any longer that holds my interest. It is my\nhope that I can make you see the desirability of assuming jurisdiction\nin cases such as mine. Someday you may find a solution to the problem,\nbut until that time arrives, I ask you, in the name of mercy, to give\nus relief from life.\"\n\n\"The problem, as we see it,\" said Riggs, \"is to find some way to\nwipe out mental perspective. When a man lives as you have, sir, for\nfifty centuries, he has too long a memory. The memories add up to the\ndisadvantage of present realities and prospects for the future.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Young. \"I remember we used to talk about that in the\nearly days. It was one of the problems which was recognized when\nimmortality first became practical. But we always thought that memory\nwould erase itself, that the brain could accommodate only so many\nmemories, that when it got full up it would dump the old ones. It\nhasn't worked that way.\"\n\nHe made a savage gesture. \"Gentlemen, I can recall my childhood much\nmore vividly than I recall anything that happened yesterday.\"\n\n\"Memories are buried,\" said Riggs, \"and in the old days, when men\nlived no longer than a hundred years at most, it was thought those\nburied memories were forgotten. Life, Man told himself, is a process\nof forgetting. So Man wasn't too worried over memories when he became\nimmortal. He thought he would forget them.\"\n\n\"He should have known,\" argued Young. \"I can remember my father, and I\nremember him much more intimately than I will remember you gentlemen\nonce I leave this room.... I can remember my father telling me that, in\nhis later years, he could recall things which happened in his childhood\nthat had been forgotten all his younger years. And that, alone, should\nhave tipped us off. The brain buries only the newer memories\ndeeply ... they are not available; they do not rise to bother one,\nbecause they are not sorted or oriented or correlated or whatever it is\nthat the brain may do with them. But once they are all nicely docketed\nand filed, they pop up in an instant.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRiggs nodded agreement. \"There's a lag of a good many years in the\nbrain's bookkeeping. We will overcome it in time.\"\n\n\"We have tried,\" said Stanford. \"We tried conditioning, the same\nsolution that worked with suicides. But in this, it didn't work. For a\nman's life is built upon his memories. There are certain basic memories\nthat must remain intact. With conditioning, you could not be selective.\nYou could not keep the structural memories and winnow out the trash. It\ndidn't work that way.\"\n\n\"There was one machine that worked,\" Riggs put in. \"It got rid of\nmemories. I don't understand exactly how it worked, but it did the job\nall right. It did too good a job. It swept the mind as clean as an\nempty room. It didn't leave a thing. It took all memories and it left\nno capacity to build a new set. A man went in a human being and came\nout a vegetable.\"\n\n\"Suspended animation,\" said Stanford, \"would be a solution. If we had\nsuspended animation. Simply stack a man away until we found the answer,\nthen revive and recondition him.\"\n\n\"Be that as it may,\" Young told them, \"I should like your most earnest\nconsideration of my petition. I do not feel quite equal to waiting\nuntil you have the answer solved.\"\n\nRiggs said, harshly, \"You are asking us to legalize death.\"\n\nYoung nodded. \"If you wish to phrase it that way. I'm asking it in the\nname of common decency.\"\n\nCommissioner Stanford said, \"We can ill afford to lose you, Ancestor.\"\n\nYoung sighed. \"There is that damned attitude again. Immortality\npays all debts. When a man is made immortal, he has received full\ncompensation for everything that he may endure. I have lived longer\nthan any man could be expected to live and still I am denied the\ndignity of old age. A man's desires are few, and quickly sated, and\nyet he is expected to continue living with desires burned up and blown\naway to ash. He gets to a point where nothing has a value ... even\nto a point where his own personal values are no more than shadows.\nGentlemen, there was a time when I could not have committed murder ...\nliterally could not have forced myself to kill another man ... but\ntoday I could, without a second thought. Disillusion and cynicism have\ncrept in upon me and I have no conscience.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"There are compensations,\" Riggs said. \"Your family....\"\n\n\"They get in my hair,\" said Young disgustedly. \"Thousands upon\nthousands of young squirts calling me Grandsire and Ancestor and coming\nto me for advice they practically never follow. I don't know even a\nfraction of them and I listen to them carefully explain a relationship\nso tangled and trivial that it makes me yawn in their faces. It's all\nnew to them and so old, so damned and damnably old to me.\"\n\n\"Ancestor Young,\" said Stanford, \"you have seen Man spread out from\nEarth to distant stellar systems. You have seen the human race expand\nfrom one planet to several thousand planets. You have had a part in\nthis. Is there not some satisfaction....\"\n\n\"You're talking in abstracts,\" Young cut in. \"What I am concerned about\nis myself ... a certain specific mass of protoplasm shaped in biped\nform and tagged by the designation, ironic as it may seem, of Andrew\nYoung. I have been unselfish all my life. I've asked little for myself.\nNow I am being utterly and entirely selfish and I ask that this matter\nbe regarded as a personal problem rather than as a racial abstraction.\"\n\n\"Whether you'll admit it or not,\" said Stanford, \"it is more than a\npersonal problem. It is a problem which some day must be solved for the\nsalvation of the race.\"\n\n\"That is what I am trying to impress upon you,\" Young snapped. \"It is a\nproblem that you must face. Some day you will solve it, but until you\ndo, you must make provisions for those who face the unsolved problem.\"\n\n\"Wait a while,\" counseled Chairman Riggs. \"Who knows? Today, tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Or a million years from now,\" Young told him bitterly and left, a\ntall, vigorous-looking man whose step was swift in anger where normally\nit was slow with weariness and despair.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was yet a chance, of course.\n\nBut there was little hope.\n\nHow can a man go back almost six thousand years and snare a thing he\nnever understood?\n\nAnd yet Andrew Young remembered it. Remembered it as clearly as if it\nhad been a thing that had happened in the morning of this very day.\n\nIt was a shining thing, a bright thing, a happiness that was brand-new\nand fresh as a bluebird's wing of an April morning or a shy woods\nflower after sudden rain.\n\nHe had been a boy and he had seen the bluebird and he had no words to\nsay the thing he felt, but he had held up his tiny fingers and pointed\nand shaped his lips to coo.\n\nOnce, he thought, I had it in my very fingers and I did not have the\nexperience to know what it was, nor the value of it. And now I know the\nvalue, but it has escaped me--it escaped me on the day that I began\nto think like a human being. The first adult thought pushed it just\na little and the next one pushed it farther and finally it was gone\nentirely and I didn't even know that it had gone.\n\nHe sat in the chair on the flagstone patio and felt the Sun upon him,\nfiltering through the branches of trees misty with the breaking leaves\nof Spring.\n\nSomething else, thought Andrew Young. Something that was not\nhuman--yet. A tiny animal that had many ways to choose, many roads to\nwalk. And, of course, I chose the wrong way. I chose the human way. But\nthere was another way. I know there must have been. A fairy way--or a\nbrownie way, or maybe even pixie. That sounds foolish and childish now,\nbut it wasn't always.\n\nI chose the human way because I was guided into it. I was pushed and\nshoved, like a herded sheep.\n\nI grew up and I lost the thing I held.\n\nHe sat and made his mind go hard and tried to analyze what it was he\nsought and there was no name for it. Except happiness. And happiness\nwas a state of being, not a thing to regain and grasp.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut he could remember how it felt. With his eyes open in the present,\nhe could remember the brightness of the day of the past, the\nclean-washed goodness of it, the wonder of the colors that were more\nbrilliant than he ever since had seen--as if it were the first second\nafter Creation and the world was still shiningly new.\n\nIt was that new, of course. It would be that new to a child.\n\nBut that didn't explain it all.\n\nIt didn't explain the bottomless capacity for seeing and knowing and\nbelieving in the beauty and the goodness of a clean new world. It\ndidn't explain the almost non-human elation of knowing that there were\ncolors to see and scents to smell and soft green grass to touch.\n\nI'm insane, Andrew Young said to himself. Insane, or going insane.\nBut if insanity will take me back to an understanding of the strange\nperception I had when I was a child, and lost, I'll take insanity.\n\nHe leaned back in his chair and let his eyes go shut and his mind drift\nback.\n\nHe was crouching in a corner of a garden and the leaves were drifting\ndown from the walnut trees like a rain of saffron gold. He lifted one\nof the leaves and it slipped from his fingers, for his hands were\nchubby still and not too sure in grasping. But he tried again and he\nclutched it by the stem in one stubby fist and he saw that it was not\njust a blob of yellowness, but delicate, with many little veins. When\nhe held it so that the Sun struck it, he imagined that he could almost\nsee through it, the gold was spun so fine.\n\nHe crouched with the leaf clutched tightly in his hand and for a\nmoment there was a silence that held him motionless. Then he heard the\nfrost-loosened leaves pattering all around him, pattering as they fell,\ntalking in little whispers as they sailed down through the air and\nfound themselves a bed with their golden fellows.\n\nIn that moment he knew that he was one with the leaves and the\nwhispers that they made, one with the gold and the autumn sunshine and\nthe far blue mist upon the hill above the apple orchard.\n\nA foot crunched stone behind him and his eyes came open and the golden\nleaves were gone.\n\n\"I am sorry if I disturbed you, Ancestor,\" said the man. \"I had an\nappointment for this hour, but I would not have disturbed you if I had\nknown.\"\n\nYoung stared at him reproachfully without answering.\n\n\"I am kin,\" the man told him.\n\n\"I wouldn't doubt it,\" said Andrew Young. \"The Galaxy is cluttered up\nwith descendants of mine.\"\n\nThe man was very humble. \"Of course, you must resent us sometimes. But\nwe are proud of you, sir. I might almost say that we revere you. No\nother family--\"\n\n\"I know,\" interrupted Andrew Young. \"No other family has any fossil\nquite so old as I am.\"\n\n\"Nor as wise,\" said the man.\n\nAndrew Young snorted. \"Cut out that nonsense. Let's hear what you have\nto say and get it over with.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe technician was harassed and worried and very frankly puzzled. But\nhe stayed respectful, for one always was respectful to an ancestor,\nwhoever he might be. Today there were mighty few left who had been born\ninto a mortal world.\n\nNot that Andrew Young looked old. He looked like all adults, a fine\nfigure of a person in the early twenties.\n\nThe technician shifted uneasily. \"But, sir, this ... this....\"\n\n\"Teddy bear,\" said Young.\n\n\"Yes, of course. An extinct terrestrial subspecies of animal?\"\n\n\"It's a toy,\" Young told him. \"A very ancient toy. All children used to\nhave them five thousand years ago. They took them to bed.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe technician shuddered. \"A deplorable custom. Primitive.\"\n\n\"Depends on the viewpoint,\" said Young. \"I've slept with them many a\ntime. There's a world of comfort in one, I can personally assure you.\"\n\nThe technician saw that it was no use to argue. He might as well\nfabricate the thing and get it over with.\n\n\"I can build you a fine model, sir,\" he said, trying to work up some\nenthusiasm. \"I'll build in a response mechanism so that it can give\nsimple answers to certain keyed questions and, of course, I'll fix it\nso it'll walk, either on two legs or four....\"\n\n\"No,\" said Andrew Young.\n\nThe technician looked surprised and hurt. \"No?\"\n\n\"No,\" repeated Andrew Young. \"I don't want it fancied up. I want it\na simple lump of make-believe. No wonder the children of today have\nno imagination. Modern toys entertain them with a bag of tricks that\nleave the young'uns no room for imagination. They couldn't possibly\nthink up, on their own, all the screwy things these new toys do.\nBuilt-in responses and implied consciousness and all such mechanical\ntrivia....\"\n\n\"You just want a stuffed fabric,\" said the technician, sadly, \"with\njointed arms and legs.\"\n\n\"Precisely,\" agreed Young.\n\n\"You're sure you want fabric, sir? I could do a neater job in plastics.\"\n\n\"Fabric,\" Young insisted firmly, \"and it must be scratchy.\"\n\n\"Scratchy, sir?\"\n\n\"Sure. You know. Bristly. So it scratches when you rub your face\nagainst it.\"\n\n\"But no one in his right mind would want to rub his face....\"\n\n\"I would,\" said Andrew Young. \"I fully intend to do so.\"\n\n\"As you wish, sir,\" the technician answered, beaten now.\n\n\"When you get it done,\" said Young, \"I have some other things in mind.\"\n\n\"Other things?\" The technician looked wildly about, as if seeking some\nescape.\n\n\"A high chair,\" said Young. \"And a crib. And a woolly dog. And buttons.\"\n\n\"Buttons?\" asked the technician. \"What are buttons?\"\n\n\"I'll explain it all to you,\" Young told him airily. \"It all is very\nsimple.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt seemed, when Andrew Young came into the room, that Riggs and\nStanford had been expecting him, had known that he was coming and had\nbeen waiting for him.\n\nHe wasted no time on preliminaries or formalities.\n\nThey know, he told himself. They know, or they have guessed. They would\nbe watching me. Ever since I brought in my petition, they have been\nwatching me, wondering what I would be thinking, trying to puzzle out\nwhat I might do next. They know every move I've made, they know about\nthe toys and the furniture and all the other things. And I don't need\nto tell them what I plan to do.\n\n\"I need some help,\" he said, and they nodded soberly, as if they had\nguessed he needed help.\n\n\"I want to build a house,\" he explained. \"A big house. Much larger than\nthe usual house.\"\n\nRiggs said, \"We'll draw the plans for you. Do anything else that you--\"\n\n\"A house,\" Young went on, \"about four or five times as big as the\nordinary house. Four or five times normal scale, I mean. Doors\ntwenty-five to thirty feet high and everything else in proportion.\"\n\n\"Neighbors or privacy?\" asked Stanford.\n\n\"Privacy,\" said Young.\n\n\"We'll take care of it,\" promised Riggs. \"Leave the matter of the house\nto us.\"\n\nYoung stood for a long moment, looking at the two of them. Then he\nsaid, \"I thank you, gentlemen. I thank you for your helpfulness and\nyour understanding. But most of all I thank you for not asking any\nquestions.\"\n\nHe turned slowly and walked out of the room and they sat in silence for\nminutes after he was gone.\n\nFinally, Stanford offered a deduction: \"It will have to be a place that\na boy would like. Woods to run in and a little stream to fish in and a\nfield where he can fly his kites. What else could it be?\"\n\n\"He's been out ordering children's furniture and toys,\" Riggs agreed.\n\"Stuff from five thousand years ago. The kind of things he used when he\nwas a child. But scaled to adult size.\"\n\n\"Now,\" said Stanford, \"he wants a house built to the same proportions.\nA house that will make him think or help him believe that he is a\nchild. But will it work, Riggs? His body will not change. He cannot\nmake it change. It will only be in his mind.\"\n\n\"Illusion,\" declared Riggs. \"The illusion of bigness in relation to\nhimself. To a child, creeping on the floor, a door is twenty-five to\nthirty feet high, relatively. Of course the child doesn't know that.\nBut Andrew Young does. I don't see how he'll overcome that.\"\n\n\"At first,\" suggested Stanford, \"he will know that it's illusion, but\nafter a time, isn't there a possibility that it will become reality so\nfar as he's concerned? That's why he needs our help. So that the house\nwill not be firmly planted in his memory as a thing that's merely out\nof proportion ... so that it will slide from illusion into reality\nwithout too great a strain.\"\n\n\"We must keep our mouths shut.\" Riggs nodded soberly. \"There must be no\ninterference. It's a thing he must do himself ... entirely by himself.\nOur help with the house must be the help of an unseen, silent agency.\nLike brownies, I think the term was that he used, we must help and be\nnever seen. Intrusion by anyone would introduce a jarring note and\nwould destroy illusion and that is all he has to work on. Illusion pure\nand simple.\"\n\n\"Others have tried,\" objected Stanford, pessimistic again. \"Many\nothers. With gadgets and machines....\"\n\n\"None has tried it,\" said Riggs, \"with the power of mind alone. With\nthe sheer determination to wipe out five thousand years of memory.\"\n\n\"That will be his stumbling block,\" said Stanford. \"The old, dead\nmemories are the things he has to beat. He has to get rid of them ...\nnot just bury them, but get rid of them for good and all, forever.\"\n\n\"He must do more than that,\" said Riggs. \"He must replace his memories\nwith the outlook he had when he was a child. His mind must be washed\nout, refreshed, wiped clean and shining and made new again ... ready to\nlive another five thousand years.\"\n\nThe two men sat and looked at one another and in each other's eyes they\nsaw a single thought--the day would come when they, too, each of them\nalone, would face the problem Andrew Young faced.\n\n\"We must help,\" said Riggs, \"in every way we can and we must keep watch\nand we must be ready ... but Andrew Young cannot know that we are\nhelping or that we are watching him. We must anticipate the materials\nand tools and the aids that he may need.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nStanford started to speak, then hesitated, as if seeking in his mind\nfor the proper words.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Riggs. \"What is it?\"\n\n\"Later on,\" Stanford managed to say, \"much later on, toward the very\nend, there is a certain factor that we must supply. The one thing that\nhe will need the most and the one thing that he cannot think about,\neven in advance. All the rest can be stage setting and he can still\ngo on toward the time when it becomes reality. All the rest may be\nmake-believe, but one thing must come as genuine or the entire effort\nwill collapse in failure.\"\n\nRiggs nodded. \"Of course. That's something we'll have to work out\ncarefully.\"\n\n\"If we can,\" Stanford said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe yellow button over here and the red one over there and the green\none doesn't fit, so I'll throw it on the floor and just for the fun of\nit, I'll put the pink one in my mouth and someone will find me with\nit and they'll raise a ruckus because they will be afraid that I will\nswallow it.\n\nAnd there's nothing, absolutely nothing, that I love better than a\nfull-blown ruckus. Especially if it is over me.\n\n\"Ug,\" said Andrew Young, and he swallowed the button.\n\nHe sat stiff and straight in the towering high chair and then, in\na fury, swept the oversized muffin tin and its freight of buttons\ncrashing to the floor.\n\nFor a second he felt like weeping in utter frustration and then a sense\nof shame crept in on him.\n\nBig baby, he said to himself.\n\nCrazy to be sitting in an overgrown high chair, playing with buttons\nand mouthing baby talk and trying to force a mind conditioned by five\nthousand years of life into the channels of an infant's thoughts.\n\nCarefully he disengaged the tray and slid it out, cautiously shinnied\ndown the twelve-foot-high chair.\n\nThe room engulfed him, the ceiling towering far above him.\n\nThe neighbors, he told himself, no doubt thought him crazy, although\nnone of them had said so. Come to think of it, he had not seen any of\nhis neighbors for a long spell now.\n\nA suspicion came into his mind. Maybe they knew what he was doing,\nmaybe they were deliberately keeping out of his way in order not to\nembarrass him.\n\nThat, of course, would be what they would do if they had realized\nwhat he was about. But he had expected ... he had expected ... that\nfellow, what's his name? ... at the commission, what's the name of\nthat commission, anyhow? Well, anyway, he'd expected a fellow whose\nname he couldn't remember from a commission the name of which he could\nnot recall to come snooping around, wondering what he might be up to,\noffering to help, spoiling the whole setup, everything he'd planned.\n\nI can't remember, he complained to himself. I can't remember the name\nof a man whose name I knew so short a time ago as yesterday. Nor the\nname of a commission that I knew as well as I know my name. I'm getting\nforgetful. I'm getting downright childish.\n\nChildish?\n\nChildish!\n\nChildish and forgetful.\n\nGood Lord, thought Andrew Young, that's just the way I want it.\n\nOn hands and knees he scrabbled about and picked up the buttons, put\nthem in his pocket. Then, with the muffin tin underneath his arm, he\nshinnied up the high chair and, seating himself comfortably, sorted\nout the buttons in the pan.\n\nThe green one over here in this compartment and the yellow one ...\noops, there she goes onto the floor. And the red one in with the blue\none and this one ... this one ... what's the color of this one? Color?\nWhat's that?\n\nWhat is what?\n\nWhat--\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"It's almost time,\" said Stanford, \"and we are ready, as ready as we'll\never be. We'll move in when the time is right, but we can't move in too\nsoon. Better to be a little late than a little early. We have all the\nthings we need. Special size diapers and--\"\n\n\"Good Lord,\" exclaimed Riggs, \"it won't go that far, will it?\"\n\n\"It should,\" said Stanford. \"It should go even further to work right.\nHe got lost yesterday. One of our men found him and led him home. He\ndidn't have the slightest idea where he was and he was getting pretty\nscared and he cried a little. He chattered about birds and flowers and\nhe insisted that our man stay and play with him.\"\n\nRiggs chuckled softly. \"Did he?\"\n\n\"Oh, certainly. He came back worn to a frazzle.\"\n\n\"Food?\" I asked Riggs. \"How is he feeding himself?\"\n\n\"We see there's a supply of stuff, cookies and such-wise, left on a\nlow shelf, where he can get at them. One of the robots cooks up some\nmore substantial stuff on a regular schedule and leaves it where he can\nfind it. We have to be careful. We can't mess around too much. We can't\nintrude on him. I have a feeling he's almost reached an actual turning\npoint. We can't afford to upset things now that he's come this far.\"\n\n\"The android's ready?\"\n\n\"Just about,\" said Stanford.\n\n\"And the playmates?\"\n\n\"Ready. They were less of a problem.\"\n\n\"There's nothing more that we can do?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" Stanford said. \"Just wait, that's all. Young has carried\nhimself this far by the sheer force of will alone. That will is gone\nnow. He can't consciously force himself any further back. He is more\nchild than adult now. He's built up a regressive momentum and the only\nquestion is whether that momentum is sufficient to carry him all the\nway back to actual babyhood.\"\n\n\"It has to go back to that?\" Riggs looked unhappy, obviously thinking\nof his own future. \"You're only guessing, aren't you?\"\n\n\"All the way or it simply is no good,\" Stanford said dogmatically. \"He\nhas to get an absolutely fresh start. All the way or nothing.\"\n\n\"And if he gets stuck halfway between? Half child, half man, what then?\"\n\n\"That's something I don't want to think about,\" Stanford said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe had lost his favorite teddy bear and gone to hunt it in the dusk\nthat was filled with elusive fireflies and the hush of a world quieting\ndown for the time of sleep. The grass was drenched with dew and he felt\nthe cold wetness of it soaking through his shoes as he went from bush\nto hedge to flowerbed, looking for the missing toy.\n\nIt was necessary, he told himself, that he find the nice little bear,\nfor it was the one that slept with him and if he did not find it, he\nknew that it would spend a lonely and comfortless night. But at no time\ndid he admit, even to his innermost thought, that it was he who needed\nthe bear and not the bear who needed him.\n\nA soaring bat swooped low and for a horrified moment, catching sight\nof the zooming terror, a blob of darkness in the gathering dusk, he\nsquatted low against the ground, huddling against the sudden fear that\ncame out of the night. Sounds of fright bubbled in his throat and now\nhe saw the great dark garden as an unknown place, filled with lurking\nshadows that lay in wait for him.\n\nHe stayed cowering against the ground and tried to fight off the alien\nfear that growled from behind each bush and snarled in every darkened\ncorner. But even as the fear washed over him, there was one hidden\ncorner of his mind that knew there was no need of fear. It was as if\nthat one area of his brain still fought against the rest of him, as if\nthat small section of cells might know that the bat was no more than a\nflying bat, that the shadows in the garden were no more than absence of\nlight.\n\nThere was a reason, he knew, why he should not be afraid--a good reason\nborn of a certain knowledge he no longer had. And that he should have\nsuch knowledge seemed unbelievable, for he was scarcely two years old.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe tried to say it--two years old.\n\nThere was something wrong with his tongue, something the matter with\nthe way he had to use his mouth, with the way his lips refused to shape\nthe words he meant to say.\n\nHe tried to define the words, tried to tell himself what he meant by\ntwo years old and one moment it seemed that he knew the meaning of it\nand then it escaped him.\n\nThe bat came again and he huddled close against the ground, shivering\nas he crouched. He lifted his eyes fearfully, darting glances here and\nthere, and out of the corner of his eye he saw the looming house and it\nwas a place he knew as refuge.\n\n\"House,\" he said, and the word was wrong, not the word itself, but the\nway he said it.\n\nHe ran on trembling, unsure feet and the great door loomed before him,\nwith the latch too high to reach. But there was another way, a small\nswinging door built into the big door, the sort of door that is built\nfor cats and dogs and sometimes little children. He darted through\nit and felt the sureness and the comfort of the house about him. The\nsureness and the comfort--and the loneliness.\n\nHe found his second-best teddy bear, and, picking it up, clutched it to\nhis breast, sobbing into its scratchy back in pure relief from terror.\n\nThere is something wrong, he thought. Something dreadfully wrong.\nSomething is as it should not be. It is not the garden or the darkened\nbushes or the swooping winged shape that came out of the night. It is\nsomething else, something missing, something that should be here and\nisn't.\n\nClutching the teddy bear, he sat rigid and tried desperately to drive\nhis mind back along the way that would tell him what was wrong. There\nwas an answer, he was sure of that. There was an answer somewhere; at\none time he had known it. At one time he had recognized the need he\nfelt and there had been no way to supply it--and now he couldn't even\nknow the need, could feel it, but he could not know it.\n\nHe clutched the bear closer and huddled in the darkness, watching the\nmoonbeam that came through a window, high above his head, and etched a\nsquare of floor in brightness.\n\nFascinated, he watched the moonbeam and all at once the terror faded.\nHe dropped the bear and crawled on hands and knees, stalking the\nmoonbeam. It did not try to get away and he reached its edge and thrust\nhis hands into it and laughed with glee when his hands were painted by\nthe light coming through the window.\n\nHe lifted his face and stared up at the blackness and saw the white\nglobe of the Moon, looking at him, watching him. The Moon seemed to\nwink at him and he chortled joyfully.\n\nBehind him a door creaked open and he turned clumsily around.\n\nSomeone stood in the doorway, almost filling it--a beautiful person who\nsmiled at him. Even in the darkness he could sense the sweetness of the\nsmile, the glory of her golden hair.\n\n\"Time to eat, Andy,\" said the woman. \"Eat and get a bath and then to\nbed.\"\n\nAndrew Young hopped joyfully on both feet, arms held out--happy and\nexcited and contented.\n\n\"Mummy!\" he cried. \"Mummy ... Moon!\"\n\nHe swung about with a pointing finger and the woman came swiftly across\nthe floor, knelt and put her arms around him, held him close against\nher. His cheek against hers, he stared up at the Moon and it was a\nwondrous thing, a bright and golden thing, a wonder that was shining\nnew and fresh.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the street outside, Stanford and Riggs stood looking up at the huge\nhouse that towered above the trees.\n\n\"She's in there now,\" said Stanford. \"Everything's quiet so it must be\nall right.\"\n\nRiggs said, \"He was crying in the garden. He ran in terror for the\nhouse. He stopped crying about the time she must have come in.\"\n\nStanford nodded. \"I was afraid we were putting it off too long,\nbut I don't see now how we could have done it sooner. Any outside\ninterference would have shattered the thing he tried to do. He had to\nreally need her. Well, it's all right now. The timing was just about\nperfect.\"\n\n\"You're sure, Stanford?\"\n\n\"Sure? Certainly I am sure. We created the android and we trained her.\nWe instilled a deep maternal sense into her personality. She knows what\nto do. She is almost human. She is as close as we could come to a human\nmother eighteen feet tall. We don't know what Young's mother looked\nlike, but chances are he doesn't either. Over the years his memory has\nidealized her. That's what we did. We made an ideal mother.\"\n\n\"If it only works,\" said Riggs.\n\n\"It will work,\" said Stanford, confidently. \"Despite the shortcomings\nwe may discover by trial and error, it will work. He's been\nfighting himself all this time. Now he can quit fighting and shift\nresponsibility. It's enough to get him over the final hump, to place\nhim safely and securely in the second childhood that he had to have.\nNow he can curl up, contented. There is someone to look after him and\nthink for him and take care of him. He'll probably go back just a\nlittle further ... a little closer to the cradle. And that is good, for\nthe further he goes, the more memories are erased.\"\n\n\"And then?\" asked Riggs worriedly.\n\n\"Then he can proceed to grow up again.\"\n\nThey stood watching, silently.\n\nIn the enormous house, lights came on in the kitchen and the windows\ngleamed with a homey brightness.\n\nI, too, Stanford was thinking. Some day, I, too. Young has pointed the\nway, he has blazed the path. He had shown us, all the other billions\nof us, here on Earth and all over the Galaxy, the way it can be done.\nThere will be others and for them there will be more help. We'll know\nthen how to do it better.\n\nNow we have something to work on.\n\nAnother thousand years or so, he thought, and I will go back, too. Back\nto the cradle and the dreams of childhood and the safe security of a\nmother's arms.\n\nIt didn't frighten him in the least.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Second Childhood, by Clifford D.

Newby\n    Chief Executive and Director\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
