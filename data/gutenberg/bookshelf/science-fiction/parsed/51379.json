Now if only\n              he could avoid becoming an exhibit himself!\n\n\nFor twenty-five years, no one came. In the seventy-sixth year of his\nlife, Brian Van Anda was still trying not to remember a happy boyhood.\nTo do so was irrelevant and dangerous, although every instinct of his\nold age tempted him to reject the present and dwell in the lost times.\n\nHe would recall stubbornly that the present year, for example, was\n2096; that he had been born in 2020, seven years after the close of the\nCivil War, fifty years before the Final War, twenty-five years before\nthe departure of the First Interstellar. (It had never returned, nor\nhad the Second Interstellar. They might be still wandering, trifles of\nMan-made Stardust.) He would recall his place of birth, New Boston,\nthe fine, planned city far inland from the ancient metropolis that the\nrising sea had reclaimed after the earthquake of 1994.\n\nSuch things, places and dates, were factual props, useful when Brian\nwanted to impose an external order on the vagueness of his immediate\nexistence. He tried to make sure they became no more than that--to shut\naway the colors, the poignant sounds, the parks and the playgrounds of\nNew Boston, the known faces (many of them loved), and the later years\nwhen he had briefly known a curious intoxication called fame.\n\nIt was not necessarily better or wiser to reject those memories,\nbut it was safer, and nowadays Brian was often sufficiently tired,\nsufficiently conscious of his growing weakness and lonely unimportance,\nto crave safety as a meadow mouse often craves a burrow.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe tied his canoe to the massive window that for many years had been a\nport and a doorway. Lounging there with a suspended sense of time, he\nwas hardly aware that he was listening. In a way, all the twenty-five\nyears had been a listening. He watched Earth's patient star sink toward\nthe rim of the forest on the Palisades. At this hour, it was sometimes\npossible, if the Sun-crimsoned water lay still, to cease grieving too\nmuch at the greater stillness.\n\nThere was scattered human life elsewhere, he knew--probably a great\ndeal of it. After twenty-five years alone, that, too, often seemed\nalmost irrelevant. At other times than mild evenings, hushed noons or\nmornings empty of human commotion, Brian might lapse into anger, fight\nthe calm by yelling, resent the swift dying of his echoes. Such moods\nwere brief. A kind of humor remained in him, not to be ruined by sorrow.\n\nHe remembered how, ten months or possibly ten years ago, he had\nencountered a box turtle in a forest clearing, and had shouted at it:\n\"_They went thataway!_\" The turtle's rigidly comic face, fixed by\nnature in a caricature of startled disapproval, had seemed to point up\nsome truth or other. Brian had hunkered down on the moss and laughed\nuproariously--until he observed that some of the laughter was weeping.\n\nToday had been rather good. He had killed a deer on the Palisades,\nand with bow and arrow, thus saving a bullet. Not that he needed to\npractice such economy. He might live, he supposed, another decade or\nso at the most. His rifles were in good condition and his hoarded\nammunition would easily outlast him. So would the stock of canned\nand dried food stuffed away in his living quarters. But there was\nsatisfaction in primitive effort and no compulsion to analyze the why\nof it.\n\nThe stored food was more important than the ammunition. A time would\ncome soon enough when he no longer had strength for hunting. He would\nlose the inclination for trips to cross the river. He would yield\nto such laziness or timidity for days, then weeks. Some time, when\nit became months or years, he might find himself too feeble to risk\nclimbing the cliff wall into the forest. He would have the good sense\nthen, he hoped, to destroy the canoe, thus making of his weakness a\nnecessity.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere were books. There was the Hall of Music on the next floor above\nthe water, probably safe from its lessening encroachment. To secure\nfresh water, he need only keep track of the tides, for the Hudson had\ncleaned itself and now rolled down sweet from the lonely, uncorrupted\nhills. His decline could be comfortable. He had provided for it\nand planned it. Yet gazing now across the sleepy water, seeing a\nbroad-winged hawk circle in freedom above the forest, Brian was aware\nof the old thought moving in him:\n\n\"If I could hear voices--just once, if I could hear human voices....\"\n\nThe Museum of Human History, with the Hall of Music on what Brian\nthought of as the second floor, should also outlast his requirements.\nIn the flooded lower floor and basement, the work of slow destruction\nmust be going on. Here and there, the unhurried waters could find their\nway to steel and make rust of it, for the waterproofing of the concrete\nwas nearly a hundred years old. But it ought to be good for another\ncentury or two.\n\nNowadays the ocean was mild. There were moderate tides, winds no longer\ndestructive. For the last six years, there had been no more of the\nheavy storms out of the south. In the same period, Brian had noted a\nrise in the water level of a mere nine inches. The window-sill, his\nport, was six inches above high-tide mark now.\n\nPerhaps Earth was settling into a new, amiable mood. The climate had\nbecome delightful, about like what Brian remembered from a visit to\nsouthern Virginia in his childhood.\n\nThe last earthquake had come in 2082--a large one, Brian guessed, but\nits center could not have been close to the rock of Manhattan. The\nMuseum had only shivered and shrugged; it had survived much worse than\nthat, half a dozen times since 1994. After the tremor, a tall wave had\nthundered in from the south. Its force, like that of others, had mostly\nbeen dissipated against the barrier of tumbled rock and steel at the\nsouthern end of the submerged island--an undersea dam, Man-made though\nnot Man-intended--and when it reached the Museum, it did no more than\nsmash the southern windows in the Hall of Music, which earlier waves\nhad not been able to reach. Then it passed on up the river, enfeebled.\nThe windows of the lower floor had all been broken long before that.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter the earthquake of '82, Brian had spent a month boarding up all\nthe openings on the south side of the Hall of Music--after all, it was\nhome--with lumber painfully ferried from mainland ruins. That year, he\nhad been sixty-two years old and not moving with the ease of youth:\na rough job. He had deliberately left cracks and knotholes. Sunlight\nsifted through in narrow beams, like the bars of dusty gold Brian could\nremember in a hayloft at his uncle's farm in Vermont. It was quite\npleasant.\n\nThe Museum had been built in 2003. Manhattan, strangely enough, had\nnever been bombed, although, in the Civil War, two of the type called\n\"small fission\" had fallen on the Brooklyn and Jersey sides--so Brian\nrecalled from the jolly history books that had informed his adolescence\nthat war was definitely a thing of the past.\n\nBy the time of the final War, in 2070, the sea, gorged on the melting\nice caps, had removed Manhattan Island from history. Everything left\nstanding above the waters south of the Museum had been knocked flat\nby the tornados of 2057 and 2064. A few blobs of rock still marked\nwhere Central Park and Mount Morris Park had been, but they were not\nsignificant. Where Long Island once rose, there was a troubled area of\nshoals and tiny islands, probably a useful barrier of protection for\nthe receding shore of Connecticut.\n\nMen had yielded the great city inch by inch, then foot by foot; a full\nmile in 2047, saying: \"The flood years have passed their peak and a\nreturn to normal is expected.\"\n\nBrian sometimes felt a twinge of sympathy for the Neanderthal experts\nwho must have told each other to expect a return to normal after the\nCro-Magnons stopped drifting in.\n\nIn 2057, the island of Manhattan had to be yielded altogether. New York\nCity, half-new, half-ancient, sprawled stubborn and enormous upstream,\non both sides of a river not done with its anger. But the Museum stood.\nAided by sunken rubble of others of its kind, aided also by men because\nthey still had time to love it, the Museum stood, and might for a long\ntime yet--weather permitting.\n\nIt covered an acre of ground well north of 125th Street, rising a\nmodest fifteen stories, its foundation secure in that layer of rock\nwhich mimics eternity. It deserved its name: here men had brought\nsamples of everything, literally everything known in the course of\nhumanity since prehistory. It was, within human limits, definitive. In\nits way, considering how much the erosion of time must always steal\nfrom scholars, it was perfect.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNo one had felt anything unnatural in the refusal of the Directors\nof the Museum to move the collection after the Museum weathered the\nstorm of 2057. Instead, ordinary people, more than a thousand of them,\ndonated money so that a mighty abutment could be built around the\nground floor, a new entrance designed on the north side of the second.\nThe abutment survived the greater tornado of 2064 without damage,\nalthough, during those seven years, the sea had risen another eight\nfeet in its old ever-new game of making monkeys out of the wise.\n\nIt was left for Brian Van Anda alone, in 2079, to see the waters slide\nquietly over the abutment, opening the lower regions for the use of\nfishes and the more secret water-dwellers who like shelter and privacy.\nIn the '90s, Brian suspected the presence of an octopus or two in the\nvast vague territory which had once been parking lot, heating plant,\nstorage space, air-raid shelter, etc. He couldn't prove it; it just\nseemed like a comfortable place for an octopus.\n\nIn 2070, plans were under consideration for building a new causeway to\nthe Museum from the still expanding city in the north. In 2070, also,\nthe final War began and ended.\n\nWhen Brian Van Anda came down the river late in 2071, a refugee\nfrom certain unfamiliar types of savagery, the Museum was empty of\nthe living. He had spent many days in exhaustive exploration of\nthe building. He did that systematically, toiling at last up to the\nDirectors' meeting room on the top floor. There he observed how they\nmust have been holding a conference at the very time when a new gas was\ntried out over New York in the north, in a final effort to persuade the\nWestern Federation that Man is the servant of the state and that the\nend justifies the means.\n\nToo bad, Brian sometimes thought, that he would never know exactly what\nhappened to the Asian Empire. In the little paratroop-invaded area\ncalled the Soviet of North America, from which Brian had fled in '71,\nthe official doctrine was that the Asian Empire had won the war and\nthat the saviors of humanity would be flying in any day to take over.\nBrian had doubted this out loud, and then stolen a boat and got away\nsafely at night.\n\nUp in the meeting room, Brian had seen how that new neurotoxin had been\nno respecter of persons. An easy death, though--no pain. He observed\nalso how some things survive. The Museum, for instance, was virtually\nunharmed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBrian had often recalled those months in the meeting room as a sort\nof island in time, like the first hour of discovering that he could\nplay Beethoven; or like the curiously cherished, more than life-size\nhalf-hour back there in Newburg, in 2071, when he had briefly met and\nspoken with an incredibly old man, Abraham Brown, President of the\nWestern Federation at the time of the Civil War. Brown, with a loved\nworld in almost total ruin around him, had spoken pleasantly of small\nthings--of chrysanthemums that would soon be blooming in the front\nyard of the house where he lived with friends, of a piano recital by\nVan Anda at Ithaca, in 2067, which the old man remembered with warm\nenthusiasm.\n\nYes, the Museum Directors had died easily, and now the old innocent\nbodies would be quite decent. There were no vermin in the Museum. The\ndoorways and floors were tight, the upper windows unbroken.\n\nOne of the white-haired men had a Ming vase on his desk. He had not\ndropped from his chair, but looked as if he had fallen comfortably\nasleep in front of the vase with his head on his arms. Brian had left\nthe vase untouched, but had taken one other thing, moved by some\nstirring of his own never-certain philosophy and knowing that he would\nnot return to this room, ever.\n\nAnother Director had been opening a wall cabinet when he fell; the\nsmall key lay near his fingers. Plainly their discussion had not been\nconcerned only with war, perhaps not at all with war--after all, there\nwere other topics. The Ming vase would have had a part in it. Brian\nwished he could know what the old man had meant to choose from the\ncabinet. Sometimes, even now, he dreamed of conversations with that\nman, in which the Director told him the whole truth about that and\nother matters; but what was certainty in sleep was in the morning gone\nlike childhood.\n\nFor himself, Brian had taken a little image of rock-hard clay,\nblackened, two-faced, male and female. Prehistoric, or at any rate\nwholly primitive, unsophisticated, meaningful like the blameless motion\nof an animal in sunlight, Brian had said: \"With your permission,\ngentlemen.\" He had closed the cabinet and then, softly, the outer door.\n\n\"I'm old,\" Brian said to the red evening. \"Old, a little foolish, talk\naloud to myself. I'll have some Mozart before supper.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe transferred the fresh venison from the canoe to a small raft hitched\ninside the window. He had selected only choice pieces, as much as he\ncould cook and eat in the few days before it spoiled, leaving the rest\nfor the wolves or any other forest scavengers who might need it. There\nwas a rope strung from the window to the marble steps that led to the\nnext floor--home.\n\nIt had not been possible to save much from the submerged area, for its\ntreasure was mostly heavy statuary. Through the still water, as he\npulled the raft along the rope, the Moses of Michelangelo gazed up\nat him in tranquility. Other faces watched him. Most of them watched\ninfinity. There were white hands that occasionally borrowed gentle\nmotion from ripples made by the raft.\n\n\"I got a deer, Moses,\" said Brian Van Anda, smiling down in\ncompanionship, losing track of time. He carried his juicy burden up the\nstairway.\n\nHis living quarters had once been a cloakroom for Museum attendants.\nFour close walls gave it a sense of security. A ventilating shaft\nnow served as a chimney for the wood stove Brian had salvaged from a\nmainland farmhouse. The door could be tightly locked; there were no\nwindows. You do not want windows in a cave.\n\nOutside was the Hall of Music, an entire floor of the Museum,\ncontaining an example of every musical instrument that was known or\ncould be reconstructed in the 21st century. The library of scores and\nrecordings lacked nothing--except electricity to play the recordings.\nA few might still be made to sound on a spring-wound phonograph, but\nBrian had not bothered with it for years; the springs were rusted.\n\nHe sometimes took out the orchestra and chamber music scores, to\nread at random. Once his mind had been able to furnish ensembles,\norchestras, choirs of a sort, but lately the ability had weakened.\nHe remembered a day, possibly a year ago, when his memory refused to\ngive him the sound of oboe and clarinet in unison. He had wandered,\npeevish, distressed, unreasonably alarmed, among the racks and cases of\nwoodwinds in the collection, knowing that even if the reeds were still\ngood, he could not play them. He had never mastered any instrument\nexcept the piano.\n\n\"But even if I could play them,\" he muttered, now tolerantly amused, \"I\ncouldn't do it in unison, could I? Ah, the things that will bother a\nman!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBrian recalled--it was probably that same day--opening a chest\nof double basses. There was an old three-stringer in the group,\nprobably from the early 19th century, a trifle fatter than its modern\ncompanions. Brian touched its middle string in an idle caress, not\nintending to make it sound, but it had done so. When in use, it would\nhave been tuned to D; time had slackened the heavy murmur to A or\nsomething near it. That had throbbed in the silent room with a sense\nof finality, a sound such as a programmatic composer--Tchaikovsky,\nsay, or some other in the nadir of torment--might have used as a tonal\nsymbol for the breaking of a heart. It stayed in the air a long time,\nother instruments whispering a dim response.\n\n\"All right, gentlemen,\" said Brian. \"That was your A.\" He had closed\nthe case, not laughing.\n\nOut in the main part of the hall, a place of honor was given to what\nmay have been the oldest of all instruments, a seven-note marimba of\nphonolitic schist discovered in Indo-China in the 20th century and\nthought to be at least 5,000 years of age. The xylophone-type rack was\nmodern; for twenty-five years, Brian had obeyed a compulsion to keep\nit clear of cobwebs. Sometimes he touched the singing stones, not for\namusement, but because there was an obscure comfort in it. Unconcerned\nwith time, they answered even to the light tap of a fingernail.\n\nOn the west side of the Hall of Music, a rather long walk from Brian's\ncave, was a small auditorium. Lectures, recitals, chamber music\nconcerts had been given there in the old days. The pleasant room held\na twelve-foot concert grand, made by Steinway in 2043, probably the\nfinest of the many pianos in the Hall of Music.\n\nBrian had done his best to preserve this, setting aside a day each\nmonth for the prayerful tuning of it, robbing other pianos in the\nMuseum to provide a reserve supply of strings, oiled and sealed up\nagainst rust. No dirt ever collected on the Steinway. When not in use,\nit was covered with stitched-together sheets. To remove the cover was a\nsober ritual; Brian always washed his hands with fanatical care before\ntouching the keys.\n\nSome years ago, he had developed the habit of locking the auditorium\ndoors before he played. Even with the doors locked, he would not glance\ntoward the vista of empty seats--not knowing, nor caring much, whether\nthis inhibition had grown from a Stone Age fear of seeing someone there\nor from a flat, reasonable certainty that no one could be.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe habit might have started (he could not remember precisely) away\nback in the year 2076, when so many bodies had drifted down from the\nnorth on the ebb tides. Full horror had somehow been lacking in the\nsight of all that floating death. Perhaps it was because Brian had\nearlier had his fill of horrors; or perhaps, in 2076, he already felt\nso divorced from his own kind that what happened to them was like the\nphotograph of a war in a distant country.\n\nSome of the bodies had bobbed quite near the Museum. Most of them\nhad the gaping wounds of primitive warfare, but some were oddly\ndiscolored--a new pestilence? So there was (or had been) more trouble\nup there in what was (or had been) the Soviet of North America, a\nself-styled \"nation\" that took in east New York State and some of New\nEngland.\n\nYes, that was probably the year when he had started locking the doors\nbetween his private concerts and an empty world.\n\nHe dumped the venison in his cave. He scrubbed his hands, blue-veined\nnow, but still tough, still knowing Mozart, he thought, and walked--not\nwith much pleasure of anticipation, but more like one externally\ndriven--through the enormous hall that was so full and yet so empty,\ngrowing dim with evening, with dust, with age, with loneliness. Music\nshould not be silent.\n\nWhen the piano was uncovered, Brian delayed. He flexed his hands\nunnecessarily. He fussed with the candelabrum on the wall, lighting\nthree candles, then blowing out two for economy. He admitted presently\nthat he did not want the serene clarity of Mozart at all right now.\nThis evening, the darkness of 2070 was closer than he had felt it for\na long time. It would never have occurred to Mozart, Brian thought,\nthat a world could die. Beethoven could have entertained the idea\nsoberly enough; Chopin probably; even Brahms. Mozart would surely have\ndismissed it as somebody's bad dream, in poor taste.\n\nAndrew Carr, who lived and died in the latter half of the 20th century,\nhad endured the idea from the beginning of his childhood. The date of\nHiroshima was 1945; Carr was born in 1951; the inexhaustible wealth of\nhis music was written between 1969, when he was eighteen, and 1984,\nwhen he died in an Egyptian jail from injuries received in a street\nbrawl.\n\n\"If not Mozart,\" said Brian to his idle hands, \"there is always The\nProject.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPlaying Carr's last sonata as it should be played--as Carr was supposed\nto have said he couldn't play it himself--Brian had been thinking of\nthat as The Project for many years. It had begun long before the\nwar, at the time of his triumphs in a civilized world which had been\nwarmly appreciative of the polished interpretive artist, although no\nmore awake than any other age to the creative one. Back there in the\nundestroyed society, Brian had proposed to program that sonata in the\ncompany of works that were older but no greater, and play it--yes,\nbeyond his best, so that even critics would begin to see its importance.\n\nHe had never done it, had never felt that he had entered into the\nsonata and learned the depth of it. Now, when there was none to hear\nor care, unless maybe the harmless brown spiders in the corners of the\nauditorium had a taste for music, there was still The Project.\n\n\"_I_ hear,\" Brian said. \"_I_ care, and with myself as audience I want\nto hear it once as it ought to be, a final statement for a world that\ncouldn't live and yet was too good to die.\"\n\nTechnically, of course, he had it. The athletic demands Carr made on\nthe performer were tremendous, but, given technique, there was nothing\nimpossible about them. Anyone capable of concert work could at least\nplay the notes at the required tempos. And any reasonably shrewd\npianist could keep track of the dynamics, saving strength for the\nshattering finale in spite of the thunderings that must come before.\nBrian had heard the sonata played by others two or three times in the\nold days--competently. Competency was not enough.\n\nFor example, what about the third movement, that mad Scherzo, and the\nfive tiny interludes of sweet quiet scattered through its plunging\nfury? They were not alike. Related, perhaps, but each one demanded a\nnew climate of heart and mind--tenderness, regret, simple relaxation.\nFlowers on a flood--no. Warm window-lights in a storm--no. The\ninnocence of an unknowing child in a bombed city--no, not really.\nSomething of all those, but much more, too.\n\nWhat of the second movement, the Largo, where, in a way, the pattern\nwas reversed, the midnight introspection interrupted by moments of\nanger, or longing, or despair like that of an angel beating his wings\nagainst a prison of glass?\n\nIt was, throughout, a work in which something of Carr's life and Carr's\ntemperament had to come into you, whether you dared welcome it or not;\notherwise, your playing was no more than a bumbling reproduction of\nnotes on a page.\n\nCarr's life was not for the contemplation of the timid.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe details were superficially well known. The biographies themselves\nwere like musical notation, meaningless without interpretation and\ninsight.\n\nCarr had been a drunken roarer, a young devil-god with such a consuming\nhunger for life that he had choked to death on it. His friends hated\nhim for the way he drained their lives, loving them to distraction and\nalways loving his work a little more. His enemies must have had times\nof helplessly adoring him, if only because of an impossible transparent\nhonesty that made him more and less than human.\n\nA rugged Australian, not tall but built like a hero, a face all\nforehead and jaw and glowing hyperthyroid eyes. He wept only when he\nwas angry, the biographers said. In one minute of talk, they said,\nhe might shift from gutter obscenity to some extreme of altruistic\ntenderness, and from that to a philosophical comment of the coldest\nintelligence.\n\nHe passed his childhood on a sheep farm, ran away to sea on a freighter\nat thirteen, studied like a slave in London with a single-minded\ndesperation, even through the horrors of the Pandemic of 1972. He\nwas married twice and twice divorced. He killed a man in an imbecile\nquarrel on the New Orleans docks, and wrote his First Symphony while he\nwas in jail for that. And he died of stab wounds in a Cairo jail. It\nall had relevancy. Relevant or not, if the sonata was in your mind, so\nwas the life.\n\nYou had to remember also that Andrew Carr was the last of\ncivilization's great composers. No one in the 21st century approached\nhim--they ignored his explorations and carved cherry-stones. He\nbelonged to no school, unless you wanted to imagine a school of music\nbeginning with Bach, taking in perhaps a dozen along the way, and\nending with Carr himself. His work was a summary and, in the light of\nthe year 2070, a completion.\n\nBrian was certain he could play the first movement of the sonata\nacceptably. Technically, it was not revolutionary, but closely loyal\nto the ancient sonata form. Carr had even written in a conventional\ndouble-bar for a repeat of the entire opening statement, something that\nmade late 20th century critics sneer with great satisfaction. It never\noccurred to them that Carr expected a performer to use his head.\n\nThe bright-sorrowful second movement, unfashionably long, with its\nstrange pauses, unforeseen recapitulations, outbursts of savage\nchange--that was where Brian's troubles began. It did not help him to\nbe old, remembering the inner storms of twenty-five years ago and more.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs the single candle fluttered, Brian realized that he had forgotten\nto lock the door. That troubled him, but he did not rise from the\npiano chair. He chided himself instead for the foolish neuroses of\naloneness--what could it matter?\n\nHe shut his eyes. The sonata had long ago been memorized; printed\ncopies were safe somewhere in the library. He played the opening of\nthe first movement, as far as the double-bar; opened his eyes to the\nfriendly black and white of clean keys and played the repetition with\nnew light, new emphasis. Better than usual, he thought.\n\nNow that soaring modulation into A Major that only Carr would\nhave wanted just there in just that sudden way, like the abrupt\nhappening upon shining fields. On toward the climax--_I am playing\nit, I think_--through the intricate revelations of development and\nrecapitulation. And the conclusion, lingering, half-humorous, not\nunlike a Beethoven ending, but with a questioning that was all Andrew\nCarr.\n\nAfter that--\n\n\"No more tonight,\" said Brian aloud. \"Some night, though.... Not\ncompetent right now, my friend. Fear's a many-aspect thing. But The\nProject....\"\n\nHe replaced the cover on the Steinway and blew out the candle. He had\nbrought no torch, long use having taught his feet every inch of the\nshort journey. It was quite dark. The never-opened western windows of\nthe auditorium were dirty, most of the dirt on the outside, crusted\nwind-blow salt.\n\nIn this partial darkness, something was wrong.\n\nAt first Brian could find no source for the faint light, the dim orange\nwith a hint of motion that had no right to be here. He peered into the\ngloom of the auditorium, fixed his eyes on the oblong of blacker shadow\nthat was the door he meant to use, but it told him nothing.\n\nThe windows, of course. He had almost forgotten there were any. The\nlight, hardly deserving the name, was coming through them. But sunset\nwas surely well past; he had been here a long time, delaying and\nbrooding before he played. Sunset should not flicker.\n\nSo there was some kind of fire on the mainland. There had been no\nthunderstorm. How could fire start, over there where no one ever came?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe stumbled a few times, swearing petulantly, locating the doorway\nagain and groping through it into the Hall of Music. The windows out\nhere were just as dirty; no use trying to see through them. There must\nhave been a time when he had enjoyed looking through them.\n\nHe stood shivering in the marble silence, trying to remember.\n\nHe could not. Time was a gradual eternal dying. Time was a long growth\nof dirt and ocean salt, sealing in, covering over forever.\n\nHe stumbled for his cave, hurrying now, and lit two candles. He left\none by the cold stove and used the other to light his way down the\nstairs to his raft. Once down there, he blew it out, afraid. The room\na candle makes in the darkness is a vulnerable room. With no walls, it\ncloses in a blindness. He pulled the raft by the guide-rope, gently,\nfor fear of noise.\n\nHe found his canoe tied as he had left it. He poked his white head\nslowly beyond the sill, staring west.\n\nMerely a bonfire gleaming, reddening the blackness of the cliff.\n\nBrian knew the spot, a ledge almost at water level. At one end of it\nwas the troublesome path he used in climbing up to the forest. Usable\ndriftwood was often there, the supply renewed by the high tides.\n\n\"No,\" Brian said. \"Oh, no....\"\n\nUnable to accept, or believe, or not believe, he drew his head in,\nresting his forehead on the coldness of the sill, waiting for dizziness\nto pass, reason to return. Then rather calm, he once more leaned out\nover the sill. The fire still shone and was therefore not a disordered\ndream of old age, but it was dying to a dull rose of embers.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe wondered a little about time. The Museum clocks and watches had\nstopped long ago; Brian had ceased to want them. A sliver of moon was\nhanging over the water to the east. He ought to be able to remember\nthe phases, deduce the approximate time from that. But his mind was\ntoo tired or distraught to give him the necessary data. Maybe it was\nsomewhere around midnight.\n\nHe climbed on the sill and, with grunting effort, lifted the canoe\nover it to the motionless water inside. Wasted energy, he decided, as\nsoon as that struggle was over. That fire had been lit before daylight\npassed; whoever lit it would have seen the canoe, might even have\nbeen watching Brian himself come home from his hunting. The canoe's\ndisappearance in the night would only rouse further curiosity. But\nBrian was too exhausted to lift it back.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhy assume that the maker of the bonfire was necessarily hostile? Might\nbe good company.\n\nMight be....\n\nBrian pulled his raft through the darkness, secured it at the stairway,\nand groped back to his cave.\n\nHe then locked the door. The venison was waiting, the sight and smell\nof it making him suddenly ravenous. He lit a small fire in the stove,\none that he hoped would not be still sending smoke from the ventilator\nshaft when morning came. He cooked the meat crudely and wolfed it down,\nall enjoyment gone at the first mouthful.\n\nHe was shocked then to discover the dirtiness of his white beard. He\nhadn't given himself a real bath in--weeks? He searched for scissors\nand spent an absent-minded while trimming the beard back to shortness.\nHe ought to take some soap--valuable stuff--down to Moses' room and\nwash.\n\nClothes, too. People probably still wore them. He had worn none for\nyears, except for sandals and a clout and a carrying satchel for\nhis trips to the mainland. He had enjoyed the freedom at first, and\nespecially the discovery in his rugged fifties that he did not need\nclothes even for the soft winters, except perhaps a light covering\nwhen he slept. Then almost total nakedness had become so natural, it\nrequired no thought at all. But the owner of that bonfire--\n\nHe checked his rifles. The .22 automatic, an Army model from the 2040s,\nwas the best. The tiny bullets carried a paralytic poison: graze a\nman's finger and he was painlessly dead in three minutes. Effective\nrange, with telescopic sights, three kilometers; weight, a scant five\npounds.\n\nHe sat a long time cuddling that triumph of military science, listening\nfor sounds that did not come, wondering often about the unknowable\npassage of night toward day. Would it be two o'clock?\n\nHe wished he could have seen the Satellite, renamed in his mind the\nMidnight Star, but when he was down there at his port, he had not\nonce looked up at the night sky. Delicate and beautiful, bearing its\neverlasting freight of men who must have been dead now for twenty-five\nyears and who would be dead a very long time--well, it was better than\na clock, Brian often thought, if you happened to look at the midnight\nsky at the right time of the month when the Man-made star could catch\nthe moonlight. But he had not seen it tonight.\n\nThree o'clock?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt some time during the long dark, he put the rifle away on the floor.\nWith studied, self-conscious contempt for his own weakness, he strode\nout noisily into the Hall of Music with a fresh-lit candle. This same\nbravado, he knew, might dissolve at the first alien noise. While it\nlasted, though, it was invigorating.\n\nThe windows were still black with night. As if the candle-flame had\nfound its own way, Brian was standing by the ancient marimba in\nthe main hall, the light slanting carelessly away from his thin,\nhigh-veined hand. Nearby, on a small table, sat the Stone Age clay\nimage he had brought long ago from the Directors' meeting room on the\nfifteenth floor. It startled him.\n\nHe remembered quite clearly how he himself had placed it there, obeying\na half-humorous whim: the image and the singing stones were both\nmagnificently older than history, so why shouldn't they live together?\nWhenever he dusted the marimba, he dusted the image respectfully and\nits pedestal. It would not have taken much urging from the impulses of\na lonely mind, he supposed, to make him place offerings before it and\nbow down--winking first, of course, to indicate that rituals suitable\nto two aging gentlemen did not have to be sensible in order to be good.\n\nBut now the clay face, recapitulating eternity, startled him. Possibly\nsome flicker of the candle had given it a new mimicry of life.\n\nThough worn with antiquity, it was not deformed. The chipped places\nwere simple honorable scars. The two faces stared mildly from the\nsingle head; there were plain stylized lines to represent folded hands,\nequally artless marks of sex on either side. That was all. The maker\nmight have intended it to be a child's toy or a god.\n\nA wooden hammer of modern make rested on the marimba. Softly, Brian\ntapped a few of the stones. He struck the shrillest one harder, waking\nmany slow-dying overtones, and laid the hammer down, listening until\nthe last murmur perished and a drop of hot wax hurt his thumb.\n\nHe returned to his cave and blew out the candle, thinking of the door,\nnot caring that he had, in irrational bravado, left it unlocked. Face\ndown, he rolled his head and clenched his fingers into his pallet,\nseeking in pain and finding at last the relief of stormy helpless\nweeping in the total dark.\n\nThen he slept.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey looked timid. The evidence of it was in their tense squatting\npose, not in what the feeble light allowed Brian to see of their faces,\nwhich were as blank as rock. Hunched down just inside the open doorway\nof the cloakroom-cave, a dim morning grayness from the Hall of Music\nbehind them, they were ready for flight. Brian's intelligence warned\nhis body to stay motionless, for readiness for flight could also be\nreadiness for attack. He studied them, lowering his eyelids to a slit.\nOn his pallet well inside the cave, he must be in deep shadow.\n\nThey were aware of him, though, keenly aware.\n\nThey were very young, perhaps sixteen or seventeen years old,\nfirm-muscled, the man slim but heavy in the shoulders, the girl a fully\ndeveloped woman. They were dressed alike: loin-cloths of some coarse\ndull fabric and moccasins that might be deerhide. Their hair grew\nnearly to the shoulders and was cut off carelessly there, but they were\nevidently in the habit of combing it. They appeared to be clean. Their\ncomplexion, so far as Brian could guess it in the meager light, was the\nbrown of a heavy tan.\n\nWith no immediate awareness of emotion, he decided they were beautiful,\nand then, within his own poised, perilous silence, Brian reminded\nhimself that the young are always beautiful.\n\nSoftly--Brian saw no motion of her lips--the woman muttered: \"He wake.\"\n\nA twitch of the man's hand was probably meant to warn her to be quiet.\nHis other hand clutched the shaft of a javelin with a metal blade.\nBrian saw that the blade had once belonged to a bread-knife; it was\npolished and shining, lashed to a peeled stick. The javelin trailed,\nready for use at a flick of the young man's arm. Brian opened his eyes\nplainly.\n\nDeliberately, he sighed. \"Good morning.\"\n\nThe youth said: \"Good morning, sa.\"\n\n\"Where do you come from?\"\n\n\"Millstone.\" The young man spoke automatically, but then his facial\nrigidity dissolved into amazement and some kind of distress. He glanced\nat his companion, who giggled uneasily.\n\n\"The old man pretends to not know,\" she said, and smiled, and seemed\nto be waiting for the young man's permission to go on speaking. He did\nnot give it, but she continued: \"Sa, the old ones of Millstone are\ndead.\" She thrust her hand out and down, flat, a picture of finality,\nadding with nervous haste: \"As the Old Man knows. He who told us to\ncall him Jonas, she who told us to call her Abigail, they are dead.\nThey are still-without-moving for six days. Then we do the burial as\nthey told us. As the Old Man knows.\"\n\n\"But I don't know!\" said Brian, and sat up on his pallet, too quickly,\nstartling them. But their motion was backward, readiness for flight,\nnot for aggression. \"Millstone? Where is Millstone?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBoth looked wholly bewildered, then dismayed. They stood up with\nsplendid animal grace, stepping backward out of the cave, the girl\nwhispering in the man's ear. Brian caught only two words: \"Is angry....\"\n\nHe jumped up. \"Don't go! Please don't go!\" He followed them out of the\ncave, slowly now, aware that he might well be an object of terror in\nthe half-dark, aware of his gaunt, graceless age and dirty hacked-off\nbeard. Almost involuntarily, he adopted something of the flat stilted\nquality of their speech: \"I will not hurt you. Do not go.\"\n\nThey halted. The girl smiled dubiously.\n\nThe man said: \"We need old ones. They die. He who told us to call him\nJonas said, many days in the boat, not with the sun-path, he said,\nacross the sun-path, he said, keeping land on the left hand. We need\nold ones to speak the--to speak.... The Old Man is angry?\"\n\n\"No, I am not angry. I am never angry.\" Brian's mind groped, certain\nof nothing. No one had come for twenty-five years. Only twenty-five?\nMillstone?\n\nThere was red-gold on the dirty eastern windows of the Hall of Music,\na light becoming softness as it slanted down, touching the long rows\nof cases, the warm brown of an antique spinet, the arrogant clean gold\nof a 20th century harp, the dull gray of singing stones five thousand\nyears old and a clay face much older than that.\n\n\"Millstone?\" Brian pointed southwest in inquiry.\n\nThe girl nodded, pleased and not at all surprised that he should know,\nwatching him now with a squirrel's stiff curiosity. Hadn't there once\nbeen a Millstone River in or near Princeton? He thought he remembered\nthat it emptied into the Raritan Canal. There was some moderately high\nground around there. Islands now, no doubt, or--well, perhaps they\nwould tell him.\n\n\"There were old people in Millstone,\" he said, trying for gentle\ndignity, \"and they died. So now you need old ones to take their place.\"\n\nThe girl nodded vigorously. A glance at the young man was full of\nshyness, possessiveness, maybe some amusement. \"He who told us to call\nhim Jonas said no marriage can be without the words of Abraham.\"\n\n\"Abr--\" Brian checked himself. If this was religion, it would not do\nto speak the name Abraham with a rising inflection, at least not until\nhe knew what it stood for. \"I have been for a long time--\" He checked\nhimself again. A man old, ugly and strange enough to be sacred should\nnever stoop to explain anything.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey were standing by the seven-stone marimba. His hand dropped, his\nthumbnail clicking by accident against the deepest stone and waking a\nmurmur. The children drew back alarmed.\n\nBrian smiled. \"Don't be afraid.\" He tapped the other stones lightly.\n\"It is only music. It will not hurt you.\" He was silent a while, and\nthey were patient and respectful, waiting for more light. He asked\ncarefully: \"He who told you to call him Jonas, he taught you all the\nthings you know?\"\n\n\"All things,\" the boy said, and the girl nodded quickly, so that the\nsoft brownness of her hair tumbled about her face, and she pushed it\nback in a small human motion as old as the clay image.\n\n\"Do you know how old you are?\"\n\nThey looked blank. Then the girl said: \"Oh, summers!\" She held up both\nhands with spread fingers, then one hand. \"Three fives. As the Old Man\nknows.\"\n\n\"I am very old,\" said Brian. \"I know many things. But sometimes I wish\nto forget, and sometimes I wish to hear what others know, even though I\nmay know it myself.\"\n\nThey looked uncomprehending and greatly impressed. Brian felt a smile\non his face and wondered why it should be there. They were nice\nchildren. Born ten years after the death of a world. Or twenty perhaps.\n_I think I am seventy-six, but did I drop a decade somewhere and never\nnotice the damn thing?_\n\n\"He who told you to call him Jonas, he taught you all that you know\nabout Abraham?\"\n\nAt sound of the name, both of them made swift circular motions, first\nat the forehead, then at the breast.\n\n\"He taught us all things,\" the young man said. \"He, and she who told\nus to call her Abigail. The hours to rise, to pray, to wash, to eat.\nThe laws for hunting, and I know the Abraham-words for that: Sol-Amra,\nI take this for my need.\"\n\nBrian felt lost again, dismally lost, and looked down to the grave clay\nfaces of the image for counsel, and found none. \"They who told you to\ncall them Jonas and Abigail, they were the only old ones who lived with\nyou?\"\n\nAgain that look of bewilderment. \"The only ones, sa,\" the young man\nsaid. \"As the Old Man knows.\"\n\n_I could never persuade them that, being old, I know very nearly\nnothing._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBrian straightened to his full gaunt height. The young people were not\ntall; though stiff and worn with age, Brian knew he was still a bonily\noverpowering creature. Once, among men, he had mildly enjoyed being\nmore than life-size.\n\nAs a shield for the lonely, frightened thing that was his mind, he put\non a phony sternness: \"I wish to examine you about Millstone and your\nknowledge of Abraham. How many others are living at Millstone?\"\n\n\"Two fives, sa,\" said the boy promptly, \"and I who may be called\nJonason and this one we may call Paula. Two fives and two. We are the\nbiggest, we two. The others are only children, but he we call Jimi\nhas killed his deer. He sees after them now while we go across the\nsun-path.\"\n\nUnder Brian's questioning, more of the story came, haltingly, obscured\nby the young man's conviction that the Old Man already knew everything.\nSome time, probably in the middle 2080s, Jonas and Abigail (whoever\nthey were) had come on a group of twelve wild children who were keeping\nalive somehow in a ruined town where their elders had all died. Jonas\nand Abigail had brought them all to an island they called Millstone.\n\nJonas and Abigail had come originally from \"up across the\nsun-path\"--the boy seemed to mean north--and they had been very old,\nwhich might mean anything between thirty and ninety. In teaching the\nchildren primitive means of survival, Jonas and Abigail had brought\noff a brilliant success: Jonason and Paula were well fed, shining with\nhealth and cleanliness and the strength of wildness, and their speech\nhad not been learned from the ignorant. Its pronunciation faintly\nsuggested New England, so far as Brian could detect any local accent at\nall.\n\n\"Did they teach you reading and writing?\" he asked, and made writing\nmotions on the flat of his palm, which the two watched in vague alarm.\n\nThe boy asked: \"What is that?\"\n\n\"Never mind.\" He thought: _I could quarrel with some of your theories,\nMister whom I may call Jonas._ \"Well, tell me now what they taught you\nof Abraham.\"\n\nBoth made again that circular motion at forehead and breast, and the\nyoung man said with the stiffness of recitation: \"Abraham was the Son\nof Heaven, who died that we might live.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe girl, her obligations discharged with the religious gesture, tapped\nthe marimba shyly, fascinated, and drew her finger back sharply,\nsmiling up at Brian in apology for her naughtiness.\n\n\"He taught the laws, the everlasting truth of all time,\" the boy\nrecited, almost gabbling, \"and was slain on the wheel at Nuber by\nthe infidels. Therefore, since he died for us, we look up across the\nsun-path when we pray to Abraham Brown, who will come again.\"\n\nAbraham _Brown_?\n\nBut--\n\n_But I knew him_, Brian thought, stunned. _I met him once. Nuber?\nNewburg, the temporary capital of the Soviet of--oh, the hell with\nthat. Met him in 2071--he was 102 years old then, could still walk,\nspeak clearly, even remember an unimportant concert of mine from years\nbefore. I could have picked him up in one hand, but nobody was ever\nmore alive. The wheel?_\n\n\"And when did he die, boy?\" Brian asked.\n\nJonason moved fingers helplessly, embarrassed. \"Long, long ago.\" He\nglanced up hopefully. \"A thousand years? I think he who told us to call\nhim Jonas did not ever teach us that.\"\n\n\"I see. Never mind.\" _Oh, my good Doctor--after all! Artist, statesman,\nstudent of ethics, philosopher--you said that if men knew themselves,\nthey would have the beginning of wisdom. Your best teacher was\nSocrates. Well you knew it, and now look what's happened!_\n\nJonas and Abigail--some visionary pair, Brian supposed, maybe cracking\nup under the ghastliness of those years. Admirers of Brown, perhaps.\nShocked, probably, away from the religions of the 21st century, which\nhad all failed to stop the horrors, nevertheless they needed one,\nor were convinced that the children did--so they created one. There\nmust later have been some dizzying pride of creation in it, possibly\nwholehearted belief in themselves, too, as they found the children\naccepting it, building a ritual life around it.\n\nIt was impossible, Brian thought, that Jonas and Abigail could have\nmet the living Abraham Brown. As anyone must who faces the limitations\nof human intelligence, Brown had accepted mysteries, but he did not\nmake them. He was wholly without intellectual arrogance. No one could\nhave talked with him five minutes without hearing him say tranquilly:\n\"I don't know.\"\n\nThe wheel at Nuber?\n\nThe _wheel_?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBrian realized he could never learn how Brown had actually died. Even\nif he had the strength and courage to go back north--no, at seventy-six\n(eighty-six?), one can hardly make a fresh start in the study of\nhistory. Not without the patience of Abraham Brown himself, who had\nprobably been doing just that when the wheel--\n\nAn awed question from the girl pulled Brian from a black pit of\nabstraction: \"What is that?\" She was pointing to the clay image in its\ndusty sunlight.\n\nBrian spoke vaguely, almost deaf to his own words until they were past\nrecovering: \"That? It is very old. Very old and very sacred.\" She\nnodded, round-eyed, and stepped back a pace or two. \"And that--that was\nall they taught you of Abraham Brown?\"\n\nAstonished, the boy asked: \"Is it not enough?\"\n\n_There is always The Project._ \"Why, perhaps.\"\n\n\"We know all the prayers, Old Man.\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm sure you do.\"\n\n\"The Old Man will come with us.\"\n\n\"Eh?\" _There is always The Project._ \"Come with you?\"\n\n\"We look for old ones,\" said the young man. There was a new note in his\nvoice, and the note was impatience. \"We traveled many days, up across\nthe sun-path. We want you to speak the Abraham-words for marriage. The\nOld Ones said we must not mate as the animals do without the words. We\nwant--\"\n\n\"Marry, of course,\" said Brian feebly, rubbing his great, long-fingered\nhand across his face so that the words were blurred and dull.\n\"Naturally. Beget. Replenish the Earth. I'm tired. I don't know any\nAbraham-words for marriage. Go on and marry. Try again. Try--\"\n\n\"But the Old Ones said--\"\n\n\"Wait!\" Brian cried. \"Wait! Let me think. Did he--he who told you to\ncall him Jonas, did he teach you anything about the world as it was in\nthe old days, before you were born?\"\n\n\"Before? The Old Man makes fun of us.\"\n\n\"No, no.\" And since he now had to fight down physical fear as well\nas confusion, Brian spoke more harshly than he intended: \"Answer my\nquestion! What do you know of the old days? I was a young man once, do\nyou understand? As young as you. What do you know about the world I\nlived in?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJonason laughed. There was new-born doubt in him as well as anger,\nstiffening his shoulders, narrowing his innocent gray eyes. \"There was\nalways the world,\" he said, \"ever since God made it a thousand years\nago.\"\n\n\"Was there? I was a musician. Do you know what a musician is?\"\n\nThe young man shook his head, watching Brian--too alertly, watching his\nhands, aware of him in a new way, no longer humble. Paula sensed the\ntension and did not like it.\n\nShe said worriedly, politely: \"We forget some of the things they taught\nus, sa. They were Old Ones. Most of the days, they were away from\nus in--places where we were not to go, praying. Old Ones are always\npraying.\"\n\n\"I will hear this Old Man pray,\" said Jonason. The butt of the javelin\nrested against Jonason's foot, the blade swaying from side to side.\nA wrong word, any trifle, Brian knew, could make them decide in\nan instant that he was evil and not sacred. Their religion would\ncertainly require a devil.\n\nHe thought also: _Merely one of the many ways of dying. It would be\nswift, which is always a consideration._\n\n\"Certainly you may hear me pray,\" said Brian abruptly. \"Come this way.\"\nIn a fluctuating despair, he knew that he must not become angry, as a\nclimber stumbling at the edge of a cliff might order himself not to be\ncareless. \"Come this way. My prayers--I'll show you. I'll show you what\nI did when I was a young man in a world you never knew.\"\n\nHe stalked across the Hall of Music, not looking behind, but his back\nsensed every glint of light on that bread-knife javelin.\n\n\"Come this way!\" he shouted. \"Come in here!\" He flung open the door of\nthe auditorium and strode up on the platform. \"Sit down over there and\nbe quiet!\"\n\nThey did, he thought--he could not look at them. He knew he was\nmuttering, too, between his noisy outbursts, as he snatched the cover\noff the Steinway and raised the lid, muttering bits and fragments from\nold times, and from the new times.\n\n\"They went thataway. Oh, Mr. Van Anda, it just simply goes right\nthrough me; I can't express it. Madam, such was my intention--or, as\nBrahms is supposed to have said on a slightly different subject, any\nass knows that. Brio, Rubato and Schmalz went to sea in a--Jonason,\nPaula, this is a piano. It will not hurt you. Sit there, be quiet,\nlisten.\"\n\nHe found calm. _Now if ever, now when I have living proof that human\nnature (some sort of human nature) is continuing--surely now, if ever,\nThe Project--_\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith the sudden authority that was natural to him, Andrew Carr took\nover. In the stupendous opening chords of the introduction, Brian very\nnearly forgot his audience. Not quite, though. The youngsters had sat\ndown out there in the dusty region where none but ghosts had lingered\nfor twenty-five years or more. The piano's first sound brought them to\ntheir feet. Brian played through the first four bars, piling the chords\nlike mountains, then held the last one with the pedal and waved his\nright hand at Jonason and Paula in a furious downward motion.\n\nHe thought they understood. He thought he saw them sit down again, but\nhe could pay them scant attention now, for the sonata was coming alive\nunder his fingers, waking, growing, rejoicing.\n\nHe did not forget the youngsters again. They were important,\nterrifying, too important, at the fringe of awareness. But he could\nnot look at them any more. He shut his eyes.\n\nHe had never played like this in the flood of his prime, in the old\ndays, before great audiences that loved him. Never.\n\nHis eyes were still closed, holding him secure in a secret world that\nwas not all darkness, when he ended the first movement, paused very\nbriefly, and moved on with complete assurance to explore the depth\nand height of the second. This was a true statement at last. This was\nAndrew Carr; he lived, even if, after this late morning, he might never\nlive again.\n\nAnd now the third, the storm and the wrath, the interludes of calm, the\nanger, denials, affirmations. _Was there anything he didn't know, this\nheir of three centuries who died in jail?_\n\nWithout hesitation, without any awareness of self, of age or pain or\ndanger or loss, Brian was entering on the broad reaches of the last\nmovement when he opened his eyes.\n\nThe youngsters were gone.\n\nWell, he thought, it's too big. It frightened them away. He\ncould visualize them, stealing out with backward looks of panic.\nIncomprehensible thunder. But he could not think much about them\nnow. Not while Andrew Carr was with him. He played on with the same\nassurance, the same joyful sense of victory. Savages--let them go, with\nleave and good will.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSome external sound was faintly troubling him, something that must\nhave begun under cover of these rising, pealing octave passages--storm\nwaves, each higher than the last, until it seemed that even a\nsuperhuman swimmer must be exhausted. An undefinable alien noise, a\nkind of humming.\n\nBrian shook his head peevishly, shutting it away. It couldn't matter,\nat least not now. Everything was here, in the beautiful labors his\nhands still had to do. The waves were growing more quiet, settling,\nsubsiding, and now he must play those curious arpeggios which he had\nnever quite understood--but, of course, he understood them at last. Rip\nthem out of the piano like showers of sparks, like distant lightnings\nmoving farther off across a world that could never be at rest.\n\nThe final theme. Why, it was a variation--and how was it that he had\nnever realized it?--a variation on a theme of Brahms, from the German\nRequiem. Quite plain, quite simple, and Brahms would have approved.\nStill it was rather strange, Brian thought, that he had never made the\nidentification before in spite of all his study. Well, he knew it now.\n\n_Blessed are the dead...._\n\nYes, Brian thought, but something more remained, and he searched for\nit, proudly certain of discovering it, through the mighty unfolding of\nthe finale. No hurrying, no crashing impatience any more, but a moving\nthrough time with no fear of time, through radiance and darkness with\nno fear of either. Andrew Carr was happy, the light of the Sun on his\nshoulders.\n\n_That they may rest from their labors, and their works do follow after\nthem._\n\nBrian stood up, swaying and out of breath. So the music was over,\nand the young savages were gone, and somewhere a jangling, humming\nconfusion was filling the Hall of Music, distant, but entering with\nviolence even here, now that the piano was silent. Brian moved stiffly\nout of the auditorium, more or less knowing what he would find.\n\nThe noise was immense, the unchecked overtones of the marimba fuming\nand quivering as the high ceiling of the Hall of Music caught and\ntwisted them, flung them back against the answering strings of harps\nand pianos and violins, the sulky membranes of drums, the nervous brass\nof cymbals.\n\nThe girl was playing it. Really playing it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBrian laughed once, softly, in the shadows, and was not heard. She\nhad hit on a most primeval rhythm natural for children or savages and\nneeded nothing else, hammering it out swiftly on one stone and then the\nnext, wanting no rest or variation.\n\nThe boy was dancing, slapping his feet, pounding his chest, thrusting\nout his javelin in perfect time to the clamor, edging up to his\ncompanion, grimacing, drawing back to return. Neither was laughing or\nclose to laughter. Their faces were savage-solemn, downright grim with\nthe excitement, the innocent lust, as spontaneous as the drumming of\npartridges.\n\nIt was a while before they saw Brian in the shadows.\n\nThe girl dropped the hammer. The boy froze briefly, his javelin raised,\nthen jerked his head slightly at Paula, who snatched at something.\nOnly moments later did Brian realize that she had taken the clay image\nbefore she fled. Jonason covered her retreat, stepping backward, his\nface blank with fear and readiness, javelin poised. So swiftly, so\neasily, by grace of a few wrong words and Steinway's best, had a Sacred\nOld One become a Bad Old One, an evil spirit.\n\nThey were gone, down the stairway, leaving the echo of Brian's voice\ncrying: \"Don't go! Please don't go! I beg you!\"\n\nBrian followed them unwillingly. It was a measure of his unwillingness\nthat moments passed before he was at the bottom of the stairway looking\nacross the shut-in water to his raft, which they had used and left at\nthe window-sill port. Brian had never been a good swimmer; he was too\ndizzy now and short of breath to attempt to reach it.\n\nHe clutched the rope and hitched himself, panting, hand over hand,\nto the window, collapsing there a while until he found strength to\nscramble into his canoe and grope for the paddle. The youngsters' canoe\nwas already far off, heading up the river, the boy paddling with deep\npowerful strokes.\n\nUp the river, of course. They had to find the right kind of Old Ones.\nUp across the sun-path.\n\nBrian dug his blade in the quiet water. For a time, his rugged ancient\nmuscles were willing. There was sap in them yet. Perhaps he was gaining\nslightly.\n\nHe shouted hugely: \"Bring back my two-faced god! Bring it back! It's\nnot yours. _It's not yours!_\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey must have heard his voice booming at them. At any rate, the girl\nlooked back once. The boy, intent on his effort, did not.\n\nBrian roared: \"Bring back my god! I want my little god!\"\n\nHe was not gaining on them. They had a mission, after all. They had to\nfind the right kind of Old Ones. But damn it, Brian thought, my world\nhas some rights, hasn't it? _We'll see about this._\n\nHe lifted the paddle like a spear and flung it, knowing even before his\nshoulder winced how absurd the gesture was. The youngsters were so far\naway that even an arrow from a bow might not have reached them.\n\nThe paddle splashed in the water. Not far away: a small infinity.\nIt swung about to the will of the river, the heavy end pointing,\nobediently downstream. It nuzzled companionably against a gray-faced\nchunk of driftwood, diverting it, so that presently the driftwood\nfloated into Brian's reach.\n\nHe caught it, and flung it toward the paddle, hoping it might fall\non the other side and send the paddle near him. It fell short, and\nin his oddly painless extremity, Brian was not surprised, but merely\nwatched the gray driftwood floating and bobbing along beside him with\nan irritation that was part friendliness, for it suggested the face of\na music critic he had met in--New Boston, was it? Denver? London? He\ncouldn't remember.\n\n\"Why,\" he said aloud, detachedly observing the passage of his canoe\nbeyond the broad morning shadow of the Museum of Human History, \"I seem\nto have made sure to die.\"\n\n\"Mr. Van Anda has abundantly demonstrated a mastery of the instrument\nand of the--\" _You acid fraud, go play solfeggio on your linotype!\nDon't bother me!_--\"and of the literature which could, without\nexaggeration, be termed beyond technique. He is one of those rare\ninterpreters who at the last analysis--\"\n\n\"I can't swim it, you know,\" said Brian.\n\n\"--have so deeply submerged, dedicated themselves, that they might\ntruly be said to have become one with--\" Gaining on the canoe, the\ngray-faced chip moved tranquilly, placidly approving, toward the open\nsea. And with a final remnant of strength, Brian inched forward to the\nbow of the canoe and gathered the full force of his lungs to shout up\nthe river: \"Go in peace!\"\n\nThey could not have heard him. They were too far away and a new morning\nwind was blowing, fresh and sweet, out of the northwest.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Music Master of Babylon, by Edgar Pangborn\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE MUSIC MASTER OF BABYLON ***\n\n***** This file should be named 51379.txt or 51379.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/1/3/7/51379/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
