Compasses,\nT-squares, rulers, protractors, and ellipsographs obeyed the touch of\nhis fingers as if inspired with life.\n\nThe room around him was a jungle of terrestrial and celestial globes,\nchemists' retorts, tubes, pipes, and all the indescribable apparatus\nthat modern science has invented, and which, to the uninitiated, seems\nas incomprehensible as the ancient paraphernalia of alchemists and\nastrologers. The walls were lined with book shelves, and adorned along\nthe upper portions with the most extraordinary photographs and drawings.\nEven the ceiling was covered with charts, some representing the sky,\nwhile many others were geological and topographical pictures of the face\nof the earth.\n\nBeside the drawing-board lay a pad of paper, and occasionally the little\nman nervously turned to this, and, grasping a long pencil, made\nelaborate calculations, covering the paper with a sprinkling of\nmathematical symbols that looked like magnified animalcula. While he\nworked, under a high light from a single window placed well up near the\nceiling, his forehead contracted into a hundred wrinkles, his cheeks\nbecame feverous, his piercing eyes glowed with inner fire, and drops of\nperspiration ran down in front of his ears. One would have thought that\nhe was laboring to save his very soul and had but a few seconds of\nrespite left.\n\nPresently he threw down the pencil, and with astonishing agility let\nhimself rapidly, but carefully, off the stool on which he had been\nsitting, keeping the palms of his hands on the seat beside his hips\nuntil he felt his feet touch the floor. Then he darted at a book-shelf,\npulled down a ponderous tome, flapped it open in a clear space on the\nfloor, and dropped on his knees to consult it.\n\nAfter turning a leaf or two he found what he was after, read down the\npage, keeping a finger on the lines, and, having finished his reading,\njumped to his feet and hurried back to the stool, on which he mounted so\nquickly that it was impossible to see how he managed it--without an\nupset. Instantly he made a new diagram, and then fell to figuring\nfuriously on the pad, making his pencil gyrate so fast that its upper\nend vibrated like the wing of a dragon-fly.\n\nAt last he threw down the pencil, and, encircling his knees with his\nclasped arms, sank in a heap on the stool. The lids dropped over his\nshining eyes, and he became buried in thought.\n\nWhen he reopened his eyes and unbent his brows, his gaze happened to be\ndirected toward a row of curious big photographs which ran like a\npictured frieze round the upper side of the wall of the room. A casual\nobserver might have thought that the little man had been amusing himself\nby photographing the explosions of fireworks on a Fourth of July night;\nbut it was evident by his expression that these singular pictures had no\nconnection with civic pyrotechnics, but must represent something of\nincomparably greater importance, and, in fact, of stupendous import.\n\nThe little man's face took on a rapt look, in which wonder and fear\nseemed to be blended. With a sweep of his hand he included the whole\nseries of photographs in a comprehensive glance, and then, settling his\ngaze upon a particularly bizarre object in the center, he began to speak\naloud, although there was nobody to listen to him.\n\n\"My God!\" he said. \"That's it! That Lick photograph of the Lord Rosse\nNebula is its very image, except that there's no electric fire in it.\nThe same great whirl of outer spirals, and then comes the awful central\nmass--and we're going to plunge straight into it. Then quintillions of\ntons of water will condense on the earth and cover it like a universal\ncloudburst. And then good-by to the human race--unless--unless--I, Cosmo\nVers\u00e1l, inspired by science, can save a remnant to repeople the planet\nafter the catastrophe.\"\n\nAgain, for a moment, he closed his eyes, and puckered his hemispherical\nbrow, while, with drawn-up knees, he seemed perilously balanced on the\nhigh stool. Several times he slowly shook his head, like a dreaming owl,\nand when his eyes reopened their fire was gone, and a reflective film\ncovered them. He began to speak, more deliberately than before, and in a\nmusing tone:\n\n\"What can I do? I don't believe there is a mountain on the face of the\nglobe lofty enough to lift its head above that flood. Hum, hum! It's no\nuse thinking about mountains! The flood will be six miles deep--six\nmiles from the present sea-level; my last calculation proves it beyond\nall question. And that's only a minimum--it may be miles deeper, for no\nmortal man can tell exactly what'll happen when the earth plunges into a\nnebula.\n\n\"We'll have to float; that's the thing. I'll have to build an ark. I'll\nbe a second Noah. But I'll advise the whole world to build arks.\n\n\"Millions might save themselves that way, for the flood is not going to\nlast forever. We'll get through the nebula in a few months, and then the\nwaters will gradually recede, and the high lands will emerge again.\nIt'll be an awful long time, though; I doubt if the earth will ever be\njust as it was before. There won't be much room, except for fish--but\nthere won't be many inhabitants for what dry land there is.\"\n\nOnce more he fell into silent meditation, and while he mused there came\na knock at the door. The little man started up on his seat, alert as a\nsquirrel, and turned his eyes over his shoulder, listening intently. The\nknock was repeated--three quick sharp raps. Evidently he at once\nrecognized them.\n\n\"All right,\" he called out, and, letting himself down, ran swiftly to\nthe door and opened it.\n\nA tall, thin man, with bushy black hair, heavy eyebrows, a high, narrow\nforehead, and a wide, clean shaven mouth, wearing a solemn kind of\nsmile, entered and grasped the little man by both hands.\n\n\"Cosmo,\" he said, without wasting any time on preliminaries, \"have you\nworked it out?\"\n\n\"I have just finished.\"\n\n\"And you find the worst?\"\n\n\"Yes, worse than I ever dreamed it would be. The waters will be six\nmiles deep.\"\n\n\"Phew!\" exclaimed the other, his smile fading. \"That is indeed serious.\nAnd when does it begin?\"\n\n\"Inside of a year. We're within three hundred million miles of the\nwatery nebula now, and you know that the earth travels more than that\ndistance in twelve months.\"\n\n\"Have you seen it?\"\n\n\"How could I see it--haven't I told you it is invisible? If it could be\nseen all these stupid astronomers would have spotted it long ago. But\nI'll tell you what I have seen.\"\n\nCosmo Vers\u00e1l's voice sank into a whisper, and he shuddered slightly as\nhe went on:\n\n\"Only last night I was sweeping the sky with the telescope when I\nnoticed, in Hercules and Lyra, and all that part of the heavens, a\ndimming of some of the fainter stars. It was like the shadow of the\nshroud of a ghost. Nobody else would have noticed it, and I wouldn't if\nI had not been looking for it. It's knowledge that clarifies the eyes\nand breeds knowledge, Joseph Smith. It was not truly visible, and yet I\ncould see that it was there. I tried to make out the shape of the\nthing--but it was too indefinite. But I know very well what it is. See\nhere\"--he suddenly broke off--\"Look at that photograph.\" (He was\npointing at the Lord Rosse Nebula on the wall). \"It's like that, only\nit's coming edgewise toward us. We may miss some of the outer spirals,\nbut we're going smash into the center.\"\n\nWith fallen jaw, and black brows contracted, Joseph Smith stared at the\nphotograph.\n\n\"It doesn't shine like that,\" he said at last.\n\nThe little man snorted contemptuously.\n\n\"What have I told you about its invisibility?\" he demanded.\n\n\"But how, then, do you know that it is of a watery nature?\"\n\nCosmo Vers\u00e1l threw up his hands and waved them in an agony of\nimpatience. He climbed upon his stool to get nearer the level of the\nother's eyes, and fixing him with his gaze, exclaimed:\n\n\"You know very well how I know it. I know it because I have demonstrated\nwith my new spectroscope, which analyzes extra-visual rays, that all\nthose dark nebulae that were photographed in the Milky Way years ago are\ncomposed of watery vapor. They are far off, on the limits of the\nuniverse. This one is one right at hand. It's a little one compared with\nthem--but it's enough, yes, it's enough! You know that more than two\nyears ago I began to correspond with astronomers all over the world\nabout this thing, and not one of them would listen to me. Well, they'll\nlisten when it's too late perhaps.\n\n\"They'll listen when the flood-gates are opened and the inundation\nbegins. It's not the first time that this thing has happened. I haven't\na doubt that the flood of Noah, that everybody pretends to laugh at now,\nwas caused by the earth passing through a watery nebula. But this will\nbe worse than that; there weren't two thousand million people to be\ndrowned then.\"\n\nFor five minutes neither spoke. Cosmo Vers\u00e1l swung on the stool, and\nplayed with an ellipsograph; Joseph Smith dropped his chin on his breast\nand nervously fingered the pockets of his long vest. At last he raised\nhis head and asked, in a low voice:\n\n\"What are you going to do, Cosmo?\"\n\n\"I'm going to get ready,\" was the short reply.\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"Build an ark.\"\n\n\"But will you give no warning to others?\"\n\n\"I'll do my best. I'll telephone to all the officials, scientific and\notherwise, in America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia. I'll write\nin every language to all the newspapers and magazines. I'll send out\ncirculars. I'll counsel everybody to drop every other occupation and\nbegin to build arks--but nobody will heed me. You'll see. My ark will be\nthe only one, but I'll save as many in it as I can. And I depend upon\nyou, Joseph, to help me. From all appearances, it's the only chance that\nthe human race has of survival.\n\n\"If I hadn't made this discovery they would all have been wiped out like\nminers in a flooded pit. We may persuade a few to be saved--but what an\nawful thing it is that when the truth is thrust into their very faces\npeople won't believe, won't listen, won't see, won't be helped, but will\ndie like dogs in their obstinate ignorance and blindness.\"\n\n\"But they will, they must, listen to you,\" said Joseph Smith eagerly.\n\n\"They _won't_, but I must _make_ them,\" replied Cosmo Vers\u00e1l.\n\"Anyhow, I must make a few of the best of them hear me. The fate of a\nwhole race is at stake. If we can save a handful of the best blood and\nbrain of mankind, the world will have a new chance, and perhaps a better\nand higher race will be the result. Since I can't save them all, I'll\npick and choose. I'll have the flower of humanity in my ark. I'll at\nleast snatch that much from the jaws of destruction.\"\n\nThe little man was growing very earnest and his eyes were aglow with the\nfire of enthusiastic purpose. As he dropped his head on one side, it\nlooked too heavy for the stemlike neck, but it conveyed an impression of\nimmense intellectual power. Its imposing contour lent force to his\nwords.\n\n\"The flower of humanity,\" he continued after a slight pause. \"Who\ncomposes it? I must decide that question. Is it the billionaires? Is it\nthe kings and rulers? Is it the men of science? Is it the society\nleaders? Bah! I'll have to think on that. I can't take them all, but\nI'll give them all a chance to save themselves--though I know they won't\nact on the advice.\"\n\nHere he paused.\n\n\"Won't the existing ships do--especially if more are built?\" Joseph\nSmith suddenly asked, interrupting Cosmo's train of thought.\n\n\"Not at all,\" was the reply. \"They're not suited to the kind of\nnavigation that will be demanded. They're not buoyant enough, nor\nmanageable enough, and they haven't enough carrying capacity for power\nand provisions. They'll be swamped at the wharves, or if they should get\naway they'd be sent to the bottom inside a few hours. Nothing but\nspecially constructed arks will serve. And _there's_ more trouble\nfor me--I must devise a new form of vessel. Heavens, how short the time\nis! Why couldn't I have found this out ten years ago? It's only to-day\nthat I have myself learned the full truth, though I have worked on it so\nlong.\"\n\n\"How many will you be able to carry in your ark?\" asked Smith.\n\n\"I can't tell yet. That's another question to be carefully considered. I\nshall build the vessel of this new metal, levium, half as heavy as\naluminum and twice as strong as steel. I ought to find room without the\nslightest difficulty for a round thousand in it.\"\n\n\"Surely many more than that!\" exclaimed Joseph Smith. \"Why, there are\nocean-liners that carry several times as many.\"\n\n\"You forget,\" replied Cosmo Vers\u00e1l, \"that we must have provisions enough\nto last for a long time, because we cannot count on the immediate\nre-emergence of any land, even the most mountainous, and the most\ncompressed food takes space when a great quantity is needed. It won't do\nto overcrowd the vessel, and invite sickness. Then, too, I must take\nmany animals along.\"\n\n\"Animals,\" returned Smith. \"I hadn't thought of that. But is it\nnecessary?\"\n\n\"Absolutely. Would you have less foresight than Noah? I shall not\nimitate him by taking male and female of every species, but I must at\nleast provide for restocking such land as eventually appears above the\nwaters with the animals most useful to man. Then, too, animals are\nessential to the life of the earth. Any agricultural chemist would tell\nyou that. They play an indispensable part in the vital cycle of the\nsoil. I must also take certain species of insects and birds. I'll\ntelephone Professor Hergeschmitberger at Berlin to learn precisely what\nare the capitally important species of the animal kingdom.\"\n\n\"And when will you begin the construction of the ark?\"\n\n\"Instantly. There's not a moment to lose. And it's equally important to\nsend out warnings broadcast immediately. There you can help me. You know\nwhat I want to say. Write it out at once; put it as strong as you can;\nsend it everywhere; put it in the shape of posters; hurry it to the\nnewspaper offices. Telephone, in my name, to the Carnegie Institution,\nto the Smithsonian Institution, to the Royal Society, to the French,\nRussian, Italian, German, and all the other Academies and Associations\nof Science to be found anywhere on earth.\n\n\"Don't neglect the slightest means of publicity. Thank Heaven, the money\nto pay for all this is not lacking. If my good father, when he piled up\nhis fortune from the profits of the Transcontinental Aerian Company,\ncould have foreseen the use to which his son would put it for the\nbenefit--what do I say, for the benefit? nay, for the _salvation_--of\nmankind, he would have rejoiced in his work.\"\n\n\"Ah, that reminds me,\" exclaimed Joseph Smith. \"I was about to ask, a\nfew minutes ago, why airships would not do for this business. Couldn't\npeople save themselves from the flood by taking refuge in the\natmosphere?\"\n\nCosmo Vers\u00e1l looked at his questioner with an ironical smile.\n\n\"Do you know,\" he asked, \"how long a dirigible can be kept afloat? Do\nyou know for how long a voyage the best aeroplane types can be\nprovisioned with power? There's not an air-ship of any kind that can go\nmore than two weeks at the very uttermost without touching solid earth,\nand then it must be mighty sparing of its power. If we can save mankind\nnow, and give it another chance, perhaps the time will come when power\ncan be drawn out of the ether of space, and men can float in the air as\nlong as they choose.\n\n\"But as things are now, we must go back to Noah's plan, and trust to the\nbuoyant power of water. I fully expect that when the deluge begins\npeople will flock to the high-lands and the mountains in air-ships--but\nalas! that won't save them. Remember what I have told you--this flood is\ngoing to be six miles deep!\"\n\nThe second morning after the conversation between Cosmo Vers\u00e1l and\nJoseph Smith, New York was startled by seeing, in huge red letters, on\nevery blank wall, on the bare flanks of towering sky-scrapers, on the\nlofty stations of aeroplane lines, on bill-boards, fences,\nadvertising-boards along suburban roads, in the Subway stations, and\nfluttering from strings of kites over the city, the following\nannouncement:\n\n  THE WORLD IS TO BE DROWNED!\n\n  Save Yourselves While It Is Yet Time!\n  Drop Your Business: It Is of No Consequence!\n  Build Arks: It Is Your Only Salvation!\n  The Earth Is Going To Plunge into a Watery\n  Nebula: There Is No Escape!\n  Hundreds of Millions Will Be Drowned: You Have\n  Only a Few Months To Get Ready!\n  For Particulars Address: Cosmo Vers\u00e1l,\n  3000 Fifth Avenue.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nMOCKING AT FATE\n\n\nWhen New York recovered from its first astonishment over the\nextraordinary posters, it indulged in a loud laugh. Everybody knew who\nCosmo Vers\u00e1l was. His eccentricities had filled many readable columns in\nthe newspapers. Yet there was a certain respect for him, too. This was\ndue to his extraordinary intellectual ability and unquestionable\nscientific knowledge. But his imagination was as free as the winds, and\nit often led him upon excursions in which nobody could follow him, and\nwhich caused the more steady-going scientific brethren to shake their\nheads. They called him able but flighty. The public considered him\nbrilliant and amusing.\n\nHis father, who had sprung from some unknown source in southeastern\nEurope, and, beginning as a newsboy in New York, had made his way to the\nfront in the financial world, had left his entire fortune to Cosmo. The\nlatter had no taste for finance or business, but a devouring appetite\nfor science, to which, in his own way, he devoted all his powers, all\nhis time, and all his money. He never married, was never seen in\nsociety, and had very few intimates--but he was known by sight, or\nreputation, to everybody. There was not a scientific body or association\nof any consequence in the world of which he was not a member. Those\nwhich looked askance at his bizarre ideas were glad to accept pecuniary\naid from him.\n\nThe notion that the world was to be drowned had taken possession of him\nabout three years before the opening scene of this narrative. To work\nout the idea, he built an observatory, set up a laboratory, invented\ninstruments, including his strange spectroscope, which was scoffed at by\nthe scientific world.\n\nFinally, submitting the results of his observations to mathematical\ntreatment, he proved, to his own satisfaction, the absolute correctness\nof his thesis that the well-known \"proper motion of the solar system\"\nwas about to result in an encounter between the earth and an invisible\nwatery nebula, which would have the effect of inundating the globe. As\nthis startling idea gradually took shape, he communicated it to\nscientific men in all lands, but failed to find a single disciple,\nexcept his friend Joseph Smith, who, without being able to follow all\nhis reasonings, accepted on trust the conclusions of Cosmo's more\npowerful mind. Accordingly, at the end of his investigation, he enlisted\nSmith as secretary, propagandist, and publicity agent.\n\nNew York laughed a whole day and night at the warning red letters. They\nwere the talk of the town. People joked about them in caf\u00e9s, clubs, at\nhome, in the streets, in the offices, in the exchanges, in the\nstreet-cars, on the Elevated, in the Subways. Crowds gathered on corners\nto watch the flapping posters aloft on the kite lines. The afternoon\nnewspapers issued specials which were all about the coming flood, and\neverywhere one heard the cry of the newsboys: _\"Extra-a-a! Drowning of\na Thousand Million people! Cosmo Vers\u00e1l predicts the End of the\nWorld!\"_ On their editorial pages the papers were careful to discount\nthe scare lines, and terrific pictures, that covered the front sheets,\nwith humorous jibes at the author of the formidable prediction.\n\n_The Owl,_ which was the only paper that put the news in half a\ncolumn of ordinary type, took a judicial attitude, called upon the city\nauthorities to tear down the posters, and hinted that \"this absurd\nperson, Cosmo Vers\u00e1l, who disgraces a once honored name with his\nchildish attempt to create a sensation that may cause untold harm among\nthe ignorant masses,\" had laid himself open to criminal prosecution.\n\nIn their latest editions, several of the papers printed an interview\nwith Cosmo Vers\u00e1l, in which he gave figures and calculations that, on\ntheir face, seemed to offer mathematical proof of the correctness of his\nforecast. In impassioned language, he implored the public to believe\nthat he would not mislead them, spoke of the instant necessity of\nconstructing arks of safety, and averred that the presence of the\nterrible nebula that was so soon to drown the world was already manifest\nin the heavens.\n\nSome readers of these confident statements began to waver, especially\nwhen confronted with mathematics which they could not understand. But\nstill, in general, the laugh went on. It broke into boisterousness in\none of the largest theaters where a bright-witted \"artist,\" who always\nmade a point of hitting off the very latest sensation, got himself up in\na lifelike imitation of the well-known figure of Cosmo Vers\u00e1l, topped\nwith a bald head as big as a bushel, and sailed away into the flies with\na pretty member of the ballet, whom he had gallantly snatched from a\ntumbling ocean of green baize, singing at the top of his voice until\nthey disappeared behind the proscenium arch:\n\n  \"Oh, th' Nebula is coming\n    To drown the wicked earth,\n  With all his spirals humming\n    'S he waltzes in his mirth.\n\n  _Chorus_\n  \"Don't hesitate a second,\n    Get ready to embark,\n  And skip away to safety\n    With Cosmo and his ark.\n\n  \"Th' Nebula is a direful bird\n    'S he skims the ether blue!\n  He's angry over what he's heard,\n    'N's got his eye on you.\n\n  _Chorus_\n  \"Don't hesitate a second, etc.\n\n  \"When Nebulas begin to pipe\n    The bloomin' O.H.[subscript]2\n  Y'bet yer life the time is ripe\n    To think what you will do.\n\n  _Chorus_\n  \"Don't hesitate a second, etc.\n\n  \"He'll tip th' Atlantic o'er its brim,\n    And swamp the mountains tall;\n  He'll let the broad Pacific in,\n    And leave no land at all.\n\n  _Chorus_\n  \"Don't hesitate a second, etc.\n\n  \"He's got an option on the spheres;\n    He's leased the Milky Way;\n  He's caught the planets in arrears,\n    'N's bound to make 'em pay.\n\n  _Chorus_\n  \"Don't hesitate a second, etc.\"\n\nThe roars of laughter and applause with which this effusion of\nvaudeville genius was greeted, showed the cheerful spirit in which the\npublic took the affair. No harm seemed to have come to the \"ignorant\nmasses\" yet.\n\nBut the next morning there was a suspicious change in the popular mind.\nPeople were surprised to see new posters in place of the old ones, more\nlurid in letters and language than the original. The morning papers had\ncolumns of description and comment, and some of them seemed disposed to\ntreat the prophet and his prediction with a certain degree of\nseriousness.\n\nThe savants who had been interviewed overnight, did not talk very\nconvincingly, and made the mistake of flinging contempt on both Cosmo\nand \"the gullible public.\"\n\nNaturally, the public wouldn't stand for that, and the pendulum of\nopinion began to swing the other way. Cosmo helped his cause by sending\nto every newspaper a carefully prepared statement of his observations\nand calculations, in which he spoke with such force of conviction that\nfew could read his words without feeling a thrill of apprehensive\nuncertainty. This was strengthened by published dispatches which showed\nthat he had forwarded his warnings to all the well-known scientific\nbodies of the world, which, while decrying them, made no effective\nresponse.\n\nAnd then came a note of positive alarm in a double-leaded bulletin from\nthe new observatory at Mount McKinley, which affirmed that during the\npreceding night _a singular obscurity_ had been suspected in the\nnorthern sky, seeming to veil many stars below the twelfth magnitude. It\nwas added that the phenomenon was unprecedented, but that the\nobservation was both difficult and uncertain.\n\nNowhere was the atmosphere of doubt and mystery, which now began to hang\nover the public, so remarkable as in Wall Street. The sensitive currents\nthere responded like electric waves to the new influence, and, to the\ndismay of hard-headed observers, the market dropped as if it had been\nhit with a sledge-hammer. Stocks went down five, ten, in some cases\ntwenty points in as many minutes.\n\nThe speculative issues slid down like wheat into a bin when the chutes\nare opened. Nobody could trace the exact origin of the movement, but\nselling-orders came tumbling in until there was a veritable panic.\n\nFrom London, Paris, Berlin, Vienna, St. Petersburg, flashed dispatches\nannouncing that the same unreasonable slump had manifested itself there,\nand all united in holding Cosmo Vers\u00e1l solely responsible for the\nfoolish break in prices. Leaders of finance rushed to the exchanges\ntrying by arguments and expostulations to arrest the downfall, but in\nvain.\n\nIn the afternoon, however, reason partially resumed its sway; then a\nquick recovery was felt, and many who had rushed to sell all they had,\nfound cause to regret their precipitancy. The next day all was on the\nmend, as far as the stock market was concerned, but among the people at\nlarge the poison of awakened credulity continued to spread, nourished by\nfresh announcements from the fountain head.\n\nCosmo issued another statement to the effect that he had perfected plans\nfor an ark of safety, which he would begin at once to construct in the\nneighborhood of New York, and he not only offered freely to give his\nplans to any who wished to commence construction on their own account,\nbut he urged them, in the name of Heaven, to lose no time. This produced\na prodigious effect, and multitudes began to be infected with a nameless\nfear.\n\nMeanwhile an extraordinary scene occurred, behind closed doors, at the\nheadquarters of the Carnegie Institution in Washington. Joseph Smith,\nacting under Cosmo Vers\u00e1l's direction, had forwarded an elaborate\n_pr\u00e9cis_ of the latter's argument, accompanied with full\nmathematical details, to the head of the institution. The character of\nthis document was such that it could not be ignored. Moreover, the\nsavants composing the council of the most important scientific\nassociation in the world were aware of the state of the public mind, and\nfelt that it was incumbent upon them to do something to allay the alarm.\nOf late years a sort of supervisory control over scientific news of all\nkinds had been accorded to them, and they appreciated the fact that a\nduty now rested upon their shoulders.\n\nAccordingly, a special meeting was called to consider the communication\nfrom Cosmo Vers\u00e1l. It was the general belief that a little critical\nexamination would result in complete proof of the fallacy of all his\nwork, proof which could be put in a form that the most uninstructed\nwould understand.\n\nBut the papers, diagrams, and mathematical formulae had no sooner been\nspread upon the table under the knowing eyes of the learned members of\nthe council, than a chill of conscious impuissance ran through them.\nThey saw that Cosmo's mathematics were unimpeachable. His formulae were\naccurately deduced, and his operations absolutely correct.\n\nThey could do nothing but attack his fundamental data, based on the\nalleged revelations of his new form of spectroscope, and on telescopic\nobservations which were described in so much detail that the only way to\ncombat them was by the general assertion that they were illusory. This\nwas felt to be a very unsatisfactory method of procedure, as far as the\npublic was concerned, because it amounted to no more than attacking the\ncredibility of a witness who pretended to describe only what he himself\nhad seen--and there is nothing so hard as to prove a negative.\n\nThen, Cosmo had on his side the whole force of that curious tendency of\nthe human mind which habitually gravitates toward whatever is\nextraordinary, revolutionary, and mysterious.\n\nBut a yet greater difficulty arose. Mention has been made of the strange\nbulletin from the Mount McKinley observatory. That had been incautiously\nsent out to the public by a thoughtless observer, who was more intent\nupon describing a singular phenomenon than upon considering its possible\neffect on the popular imagination. He had immediately received an\nexpostulatory dispatch from headquarters which henceforth shut his\nmouth--but he had told the simple truth, and how embarrassing that was\nbecame evident when, on the very table around which the savants were now\nassembled, three dispatches were laid in quick succession from the great\nobservatories of Mount Hekla, Iceland, the North Cape, and Kamchatka,\nall corroborating the statement of the Mount McKinley observer, that an\ninexplicable veiling of faint stars had manifested itself in the boreal\nquarter of the sky.\n\nWhen the president read these dispatches--which the senders had taken\nthe precaution to mark \"confidential\"--the members of the council looked\nat one another with no little dismay. Here was the most unprejudiced\ncorroboration of Cosmo Vers\u00e1l's assertion that the great nebula was\nalready within the range of observation. How could they dispute such\ntestimony, and what were they to make of it?\n\nTwo or three of the members began to be shaken in their convictions.\n\n\"Upon my word,\" exclaimed Professor Alexander Jones, \"but this is very\ncurious! And suppose the fellow should be right, after all?\"\n\n\"Right!\" cried the president, Professor Pludder, disdainfully. \"Who ever\nheard of a watery nebula? The thing's absurd!\"\n\n\"I don't see that it's absurd,\" replied Professor Jones. \"There's plenty\nof proof of the existence of hydrogen in some of the nebulae.\"\n\n\"So there is,\" chimed in Professor Abel Able, \"and if there's hydrogen\nthere may be oxygen, and there you have all that's necessary. It's not\nthe idea that a nebula may consist of watery vapor that's absurd, but it\nis that a watery nebula, large enough to drown the earth by condensation\nupon it could have approached so near as this one must now be without\nsooner betraying its presence.\"\n\n\"How so?\" demanded a voice.\n\n\"By its attraction. Cosmo Vers\u00e1l says it is already less than three\nhundred million miles away. If it is massive enough to drown the earth,\nit ought long ago to have been discovered by its disturbance of the\nplanetary orbits.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" exclaimed Professor Jeremiah Moses. \"If you stick to that\nargument you'll be drowned sure. Just look at these facts. The earth\nweighs six and a half sextillions of tons, and the ocean one and a half\nquintillions. The average depth of the oceans is two and one-fifth\nmiles. Now--if the level of the oceans were raised only about 1,600\nfeet, practically all the inhabited parts of the world would be flooded.\nTo cause that increase in the level of the oceans only about one-eighth\npart would have to be added to their total mass, or, say, one-seventh\npart, allowing for the greater surface to be covered. That would be one\nthirty-thousandth of the weight of the globe, and if you suppose that\nonly one-hundredth of the entire nebula were condensed on the earth, the\nwhole mass of the nebula would not need to exceed one three-hundredth of\nthe weight of the earth, or a quarter that of the moon--and nobody here\nwill be bold enough to say that the approach of a mass no greater than\nthat would be likely to be discovered through its attraction when it was\nthree hundred million miles away.\"\n\nSeveral of the astronomers present shook their heads at this, and\nProfessor Pludder irritably declared that it was absurd.\n\n\"The attraction would be noticeable when it was a thousand millions of\nmiles away,\" he continued.\n\n\"Yes, 'noticeable' I admit,\" replied Professor Moses, \"but all the same\nyou wouldn't notice it, because you wouldn't be looking for it unless\nthe nebula were visible first, and even then it would require months of\nobservation to detect the effects. And how are you going to get around\nthose bulletins? The thing is beginning to be visible now, and I'll bet\nthat if, from this time on, you study carefully the planetary motions,\nyou will find evidence of the disturbance becoming stronger and\nstronger. Vers\u00e1l has pointed out that very thing, and calculated the\nperturbations. This thing has come like a thief in the night.\"\n\n\"You'd better hurry up and secure a place in the ark,\" said Professor\nPludder sarcastically.\n\n\"I don't know but I shall, if I can get one,\" returned Professor Moses.\n\"You may not think this is such a laughing matter a few months hence.\"\n\n\"I'm surprised,\" pursued the president, \"that a man of your scientific\nstanding should stultify himself by taking seriously such balderdash as\nthis. I tell you the thing is absurd.\"\n\n\"And I tell you, _you_ are absurd to say so!\" retorted Professor\nMoses, losing his temper. \"You've got four of the biggest telescopes in\nthe world under your control; why don't you order your observers to look\nfor this thing?\"\n\nProfessor Pludder, who was a very big man, reared up his rotund form,\nand, bringing his fist down upon the table with a resounding whack,\nexclaimed:\n\n\"I'll do nothing so ridiculous! These bulletins have undoubtedly been\ninfluenced by the popular excitement. There has possibly been a little\nobscurity in the atmosphere--cirrus clouds, or something--and the\nobservers have imagined the rest. I'm not going to insult science by\nencouraging the proceedings of a mountebank like Cosmo Vers\u00e1l. What\nwe've got to do is to prepare a dispatch for the press reassuring the\npopulace and throwing the weight of this institution on the side of\ncommon sense and public tranquillity. Let the secretary indite such a\ndispatch, and then we'll edit it and send it out.\"\n\nProfessor Pludder, naturally dictatorial, was sometimes a little\noverbearing, but being a man of great ability, and universally respected\nfor his high rank in the scientific world, his colleagues usually bowed\nto his decisions. On this occasion his force of character sufficed to\nsilence the doubters, and when the statement intended for the press had\nreceived its final touches it contained no hint of the seeds of discord\nthat Cosmo Vers\u00e1l had sown among America's foremost savants. The next\nmorning it appeared in all the newspapers as follows:\n\n    _Official Statement from the Carnegie Institution_\n\n    In consequence of the popular excitement caused by the\n    sensational utterance of a notorious pretender to scientific\n    knowledge in New York, the council of this institution\n    authorizes the statement that it has examined the alleged\n    grounds on which the prediction of a great flood, to be caused\n    by a nebula encountering the earth, is based, and finds, as all\n    real men of science knew beforehand, that the entire matter is\n    simply a canard.\n\n    The nebulae are not composed of water; if they were composed of\n    water they could not cause a flood on the earth; the report that\n    some strange, misty object is visible in the starry heavens is\n    based on a misapprehension; and finally, the so-called\n    calculations of the author of this inexcusable hoax are baseless\n    and totally devoid of validity.\n\n    The public is earnestly advised to pay no further attention to\n    the matter. If there were any danger to the earth--and such a\n    thing is not to be seriously considered--astronomers would know\n    it long in advance, and would give due and official warning.\n\nUnfortunately for the popular effect of this pronouncement, on the very\nmorning when it appeared in print, thirty thousand people were crowded\naround the old aviation field at Mineola, excitedly watching Cosmo\nVers\u00e1l, with five hundred workmen, laying the foundations of a huge\nplatform, while about the field were stretched sheets of canvas\ndisplaying the words:\n\n  THE ARK OF SAFETY\n  Earnest Inspection Invited by All\n  Attendants will Furnish Gratis Plans for Similar\n  Constructions\n  Small Arks Can Be Built for Families\n  Act While There Is Yet Time\n\nThe multitude saw at a glance that here was a work that would cost\nmillions, and the spectacle of this immense expenditure, the evidence\nthat Cosmo was backing his words with his money, furnished a silent\nargument which was irresistible. In the midst of all, flying about among\nhis men, was Cosmo, impressing every beholder with the feeling that\nintellect was in charge.\n\nLike the gray coat of Napoleon on a battlefield, the sight of that\nmighty brow bred confidence.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTHE FIRST DROPS OF THE DELUGE\n\n\nThe utterance of the Carnegie Institution indeed fell flat, and Cosmo\nVers\u00e1l's star reigned in the ascendent. He pushed his preparations with\namazing speed, and not only politics, but even the war that had just\nbroken out in South America was swallowed up in the newspapers by\nendless descriptions of the mysterious proceedings at Mineola. Cosmo\nstill found time every day to write articles and to give out interviews;\nand Joseph Smith was kept constantly on the jump, running for\nstreet-cars or trains, or leaping, with his long coat flapping, into and\nout of elevators on ceaseless missions to the papers, the scientific\nsocieties, and the meetings of learned or unlearned bodies which had\nbeen persuaded to investigate the subject of the coming flood. Between\nthe work of preparation and that of proselytism it is difficult to see\nhow Cosmo found time to sleep.\n\nDay by day the Ark of Safety rose higher upon its great platform, its\nhuge metallic ribs and broad, bulging sides glinting strangely in the\nunbroken sunshine--for, as if imitating the ominous quiet before an\nearthquake, the July sky had stripped itself of all clouds. No\nthunder-storms broke the serenity of the long days, and never had the\noverarching heavens seemed so spotless and motionless in their cerulean\ndepths.\n\nAll over the world, as the news dispatches showed, the same strange calm\nprevailed. Cosmo did not fail to call attention to this unparalleled\nrepose of nature as a sure prognostic of the awful event in preparation.\n\nThe heat became tremendous. Hundreds were stricken down in the blazing\nstreets. Multitudes fled to the seashore, and lay panting under\numbrellas on the burning sands, or vainly sought relief by plunging into\nthe heated water, which, rolling lazily in with the tide, felt as if it\nhad come from over a boiler.\n\nStill, perspiring crowds constantly watched the workmen, who struggled\nwith the overpowering heat, although Cosmo had erected canvas screens\nfor them and installed a hundred immense electric fans to create a\nbreeze.\n\nBeginning with five hundred men, he had, in less than a month, increased\nhis force to nearer five thousand, many of whom, not engaged in the\nactual construction, were preparing the materials and bringing them\ntogether. The ark was being made of pure levium, the wonderful new metal\nwhich, although already employed in the construction of aeroplanes and\nthe framework of dirigible balloons, had not before been used for\nshipbuilding, except in the case of a few small boats, and these used\nonly in the navy.\n\nFor mere raw material Cosmo must have expended an enormous sum, and his\nexpenses were quadrupled by the fact that he was compelled, in order to\nsave time, practically to lease several of the largest steel plants in\nthe country. Fortunately levium was easily rolled into plates, and the\nsupply was sufficient, owing to the discovery two years before of an\nexpeditious process of producing the metal from its ores.\n\nThe wireless telegraph and telephone offices were besieged by\ncorrespondents eager to send inland, and all over Europe and Asia, the\nlatest particulars of the construction of the great ark. Nobody followed\nCosmo's advice or example, but everybody was intensely interested and\npuzzled.\n\nAt last the government officials found themselves forced to take\ncognizance of the affair. They could no longer ignore it after they\ndiscovered that it was seriously interfering with the conduct of public\nbusiness. Cosmo Vers\u00e1l's pressing orders, accompanied by cash, displaced\nor delayed orders of the government commanding materials for the navy\nand the air fleet. In consequence, about the middle of July he received\na summons to visit the President of the United States. Cosmo hurried to\nWashington on the given date, and presented his card at the White House.\nHe was shown immediately into the President's reception-room, where he\nfound the entire Cabinet in presence. As he entered he was the focus of\na formidable battery of curious and not too friendly eyes.\n\nPresident Samson was a large, heavy man, more than six feet tall. Every\nmember of his Cabinet was above the average in avoirdupois, and the\nheavyweight president of the Carnegie Institution, Professor Pludder,\nwho had been specially invited, added by his presence to the air of\nponderosity that characterized the assemblage. All seemed magnified by\nthe thin white garments which they wore on account of the oppressive\nheat. Many of them had come in haste from various summer resorts, and\nwere plainly annoyed by the necessity of attending at the President's\ncommand.\n\nCosmo Vers\u00e1l was the only cool man there, and his diminutive form\npresented a striking contrast to the others. But he looked as if he\ncarried more brains than all of them put together.\n\nHe was not in the least overawed by the hostile glances of the\nstatesmen. On the contrary, his lips perceptibly curled, in a\nhalf-disdainful smile, as he took the big hand which the President\nextended to him. As soon as Cosmo Vers\u00e1l had sunk into the embrace of a\nlarge easy chair, the President opened the subject.\n\n\"I have directed you to come,\" he said in a majestic tone, \"in order the\nsooner to dispel the effects of your unjustifiable predictions and\nextraordinary proceedings on the public mind--and, I may add, on public\naffairs. Are you aware that you have interfered with the measures of\nthis government for the defense of the country? You have stepped in\nfront of the government, and delayed the beginning of four battleships\nwhich Congress has authorized in urgent haste on account of the\nthreatening aspect of affairs in the East? I need hardly say to you that\nwe shall, if necessary, find means to set aside the private agreements\nunder which you are proceeding, as inimical to public interests, but you\nhave already struck a serious blow at the security of your country.\"\n\nThe President pronounced the last sentence with oratorical unction, and\nCosmo was conscious of an approving movement of big official shoulders\naround him. The disdain deepened on his lips.\n\nAfter a moment's pause the President continued:\n\n\"Before proceeding to extremities I have wished to see you personally,\nin order, in the first place, to assure myself that you are mentally\nresponsible, and then to appeal to your patriotism, which should lead\nyou to withdraw at once an obstruction so dangerous to the nation. Do\nyou know the position in which you have placed yourself?\"\n\nCosmo Vers\u00e1l got upon his feet and advanced to the center of the room\nlike a little David. Every eye was fixed upon him. His voice was steady,\nbut intense with suppressed nervousness.\n\n\"Mr. President,\" he said, \"you have accused me of obstructing the\nmeasures of the government for the defense of the country. Sir, I am\ntrying to save the whole human race from a danger in comparison with\nwhich that of war is infinitesimal--a danger which is rushing down upon\nus with appalling speed, and which will strike every land on the globe\nsimultaneously. Within seven months not a warship or any other existing\nvessel will remain afloat.\"\n\nThe listeners smiled, and nodded significantly to one another, but the\nspeaker only grew more earnest.\n\n\"You think I am insane,\" he said, \"but the truth is you are hoodwinked\nby official stupidity. That man,\" pointing at Professor Pludder, \"who\nknows me well, and who has had all my proofs laid before him, is either\ntoo thick-headed to understand a demonstration or too pig-headed to\nconfess his own error.\"\n\n\"Come, come,\" interrupted the President sternly, while Professor Pludder\nflushed very red, \"this will not do! Indulge in no personalities here. I\nhave, strained a point in offering to listen to you at all, and I have\ninvited the head of the greatest of our scientific societies to be\npresent, with the hope that here before us all he might convince you of\nyour folly, and thus bring the whole unfortunate affair promptly to an\nend.\"\n\n\"_He_ convince _me_ !\" cried Cosmo Vers\u00e1l disdainfully. \"He is\nincapable of understanding the A, B, C of my work. But let me tell you\nthis, Mr. President--there are men in his own council who are not so\nblind. I know what occurred at the recent meeting of that council, and I\nknow that the ridiculous announcement put forth in its name to deceive\nthe public was whipped into shape by him, and does not express the real\nopinion of many of the members.\"\n\nProfessor Pludder's face grew redder than ever.\n\n\"Name one!\" he thundered.\n\n\"Ah,\" said Cosmo sneeringly, \"that hits hard, doesn't it? You want me to\nname _one_; well, I'll name _three_. What did Professor\nAlexander Jones and Professor Abel Able say about the existence of\nwatery nebula, and what was the opinion expressed by Professor Jeremiah\nMoses about the actual approach of one out of the northern sky, and what\nit could do if it hit the earth? What was the unanimous opinion of the\nentire council about the correctness of my mathematical work? And what,\"\nhe continued, approaching Professor Pludder and shaking his finger up at\nhim--\"_what have you done with those three dispatches from Iceland,\nthe North Cape, and Kamchatka, which absolutely confirmed my\nannouncement that the nebula was already visible?_\"\n\nProfessor Pludder began stammeringly:\n\n\"Some spy--\"\n\n\"Ah,\" cried Cosmo, catching him up, \"_a spy_, hey? Then, you admit\nit! Mr. President, I beg you to notice that he admits it. Sir, this is a\nconspiracy to conceal the truth. Great Heaven, the world is on the point\nof being drowned, and yet the pride of officialism is so strong in this\nplodder--Pludder--and others of his ilk that they'd sooner take the\nchance of letting the human race be destroyed than recognize the truth!\"\n\nCosmo Vers\u00e1l spoke with such tremendous concentration of mental energy,\nand with such evident sincerity of conviction, and he had so plainly put\nProfessor Pludder to rout, that the President, no less than the other\nlistening statesmen, was thrown into a quandary.\n\nThere was a creaking of heavily burdened chairs, a ponderous stir all\nround the circle, while a look of perplexity became visible on every\nface. Professor Pludder's conduct helped to produce the change of moral\natmosphere. He had been so completely surprised by Cosmo's accusation,\nbased on facts which he had supposed were known only to himself and the\ncouncil, that he was unable for a minute to speak at all, and before he\ncould align his faculties his triumphant little opponent renewed the\nattack.\n\n\"Mr. President,\" he said, laying his hand on the arm of Mr. Samson's big\nchair, which was nearly on a level with his breast, and speaking with\npersuasive earnestness, \"you are the executive head of a mighty\nnation--the nation that sets the pace for the world. It is in your power\nto do a vast, an incalculable, service to humanity. One official word\nfrom you would save millions upon millions of lives. I implore you,\ninstead of interfering with my work, to give instant order for the\nconstruction of as many arks, based upon the plans I have perfected, as\nthe navy yard can possibly turn out. Issue a proclamation to the people,\nwarning them that this is their only chance of escape.\"\n\nBy a curious operation of the human mind, this speech cost Cosmo nearly\nall the advantage that he had previously gained. His ominous suggestion\nof a great nebula rushing out of the heavens to overwhelm the earth had\nimmensely impressed the imagination of his hearers, and his\nuncontradicted accusation that Professor Pludder was concealing the\nfacts had almost convinced them that he was right. But when he mentioned\n\"arks,\" the strain was relieved, and a smile broke out on the broad face\nof the President. He shook his head, and was about to speak, when Cosmo,\nperceiving that he had lost ground, changed his tactics.\n\n\"Still you are incredulous!\" he exclaimed. \"But the proof is before you!\nLook at the blazing heavens! The annals of meteorology do not record\nanother such summer as this. The vanguard of the fatal nebula is already\nupon us. The signs of disaster are in the sky. But, note what I\nsay--this is only the _first_ sign. There is another following on\nits heels which may be here at any moment. To heat will succeed cold,\nand as we rush through the tenuous outer spirals the earth will\nalternately be whipped with tempests of snow and sleet, and scorched by\nfierce outbursts of solar fire. For three weeks the atmosphere has been\nheated by the inrush of invisible vapor--but look out, I warn you, for\nthe change that is impending!\"\n\nThese extraordinary words, pronounced with the wild air of a prophet,\ncompleted the growing conviction of the listeners that they really had a\nmadman to deal with, and Professor Pludder, having recovered his\nself--command, rose to his feet.\n\n\"Mr. President,\" he began, \"the evidence which we have just seen of an\nunbalanced mind--\"\n\nHe got no further. A pall of darkness suddenly dropped upon the room. An\ninky curtain seemed to have fallen from the sky. At the same time the\nwindows were shaken by tremendous blasts of wind, and, as the electric\nlights were hastily turned on, huge snowflakes, intermingled with\nrattling hailstones, were seen careering outside. In a few seconds\nseveral large panes of glass were broken, and the chilling wind,\nsweeping round the apartment, made the teeth of the thinly clad\nstatesmen chatter, while the noise of the storm became deafening. The\nsky lightened, but at the same moment dreadful thunderpeals shook the\nbuilding. Two or three trees in the White House grounds were struck by\nthe bolts, and their broken branches were driven through the air and\ncarried high above the ground by the whirling winds, and one of them was\nthrown against the building with such force that for a moment it seemed\nas if the wall had been shattered.\n\nAfter the first stunning effect of this outbreak of the elements had\npassed, everybody rushed to the windows to look out--everybody except\nCosmo Vers\u00e1l, who remained standing in the center of the room.\n\n\"I told you!\" he said; but nobody listened to him. What they saw outside\nabsorbed every faculty. The noise was so stunning that they could not\nhave heard him.\n\nWe have said that the air lightened after the passage of the first pall\nof darkness, but it was not the reappearance of the sun that caused the\nbrightening. It was an awful light, which seemed to be born out of the\nair itself. It had a menacing, coppery hue, continually changing in\ncharacter. The whole upper atmosphere was choked with dense clouds,\nwhich swirled and tumbled, and twisted themselves into great vortical\nrolls, spinning like gigantic millshafts. Once, one of these vortexes\nshot downward, with projectile speed, rapidly assuming the terrible form\nof the trombe of a tornado, and where it struck the ground it tore\neverything to pieces--trees, houses, the very earth itself were ground\nto powder and then whirled aloft by the resistless suction.\n\nOccasionally the darkness returned for a few minutes, as if a cover had\nbeen clapped upon the sky, and then, again, the murk would roll off, and\nthe reddish gleam would reappear. These swift alternations of\nimpenetrable gloom and unearthly light shook the hearts of the\ndumfounded statesmen even more than the roar and rush of the storm.\n\nA cry of horror broke from the onlookers when a man and a woman suddenly\nappeared trying to cross the White House grounds to reach a place of\ncomparative safety, and were caught up by the wind, clinging desperately\nto each other, and hurled against a wall, at whose base they fell in a\nheap.\n\nThen came another outburst of lightning, and a vicious bolt descended\nupon the Washington Monument, and, twisting round it, seemed to envelop\nthe great shaft in a pulsating corkscrew of blinding fire. The report\nthat instantly followed made the White House dance upon its foundations,\nand, as if that had been a signal, the flood-gates of the sky\nimmediately opened, and rain so dense that it looked like a solid\ncataract of water poured down upon the earth. The raging water burst\ninto the basement of the building, and ran off in a shoreless river\ntoward the Potomac.\n\nThe streaming rain, still driven by the wind, poured through the broken\nwindows, driving the President and the others to the middle of the room,\nwhere they soon stood in rills of water soaking the thick carpet.\n\nThey were all as pale as death. Their eyes sought one another's faces in\ndumb amazement. Cosmo Vers\u00e1l alone retained perfect self-command. In\nspite of his slight stature he looked their master. Raising his voice to\nthe highest pitch, in order to be heard, he shouted:\n\n\"These are the first drops of the Deluge! Will you believe now?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nTHE WORLD SWEPT WITH TERROR\n\n\nThe tempest of hail, snow, lightning, and rain, which burst so\nunexpectedly over Washington, was not a local phenomenon. It leveled the\nantennae of the wireless telegraph systems all over the world, cutting\noff communication everywhere. Only the submarine telephone cables\nremained unaffected, and by them was transmitted the most astonishing\nnews of the ravages of the storm. Rivers had careered over their banks,\nlow-lying towns were flooded, the swollen sewers of cities exploded and\ninundated the streets, and gradually news came in from country districts\nshowing that vast areas of land had been submerged, and hundreds\ndrowned.\n\nThe downfall of rain far exceeded everything that the meteorological\nbureaus had ever recorded.\n\nThe vagaries of the lightning, and the frightful power that it\nexhibited, were especially terrifying.\n\nIn London the Victoria Tower was partly dismantled by a bolt.\n\nIn Moscow the ancient and beautiful Church of St. Basil was nearly\ndestroyed.\n\nThe celebrated Leaning Tower of Pisa, the wonder of centuries, was flung\nto the ground.\n\nThe vast dome of St. Peter's at Rome was said to have been encased\nduring three whole minutes with a blinding armor of electric fire,\nthough the only harm done was the throwing down of a statue in one of\nthe chapels.\n\nBut, strangest freak of all, in New York a tremendous bolt, which seems\nto have entered the Pennsylvania tunnel on the Jersey side, followed the\nrails under the river, throwing two trains from the track, and, emerging\nin the great station in the heart of the city, expanded into a\nrose-colored sphere, which exploded with an awful report, and blew the\ngreat roof to pieces. And yet, although the fragments were scattered a\ndozen blocks away, hundreds of persons who were in the stations suffered\nno other injury than such as resulted from being flung violently to the\nfloor, or against the walls.\n\nCosmo Vers\u00e1l's great ark seemed charmed. Not a single discharge of\nlightning occurred in its vicinity, a fact which he attributed to the\ndielectric properties of levium. Nevertheless, the wind carried away all\nhis screens and electric fans.\n\nIf this storm had continued the predicted deluge would unquestionably\nhave occurred at once, and even its prophet would have perished through\nhaving begun his preparations too late. But the disturbed elements sank\ninto repose as suddenly as they had broken out with fury. The rain did\nnot last, in most places, more than twenty-four hours, although the\natmosphere continued to be filled with troubled clouds for a week. At\nthe end of that time the sun reappeared, as hot as before, and a\nspotless dome once more over-arched the earth; but from this time the\nsky never resumed its former brilliant azure--there was always a strange\ncoppery tinge, the sight of which was appalling, although it gradually\nlost its first effect through familiarity.\n\nThe indifference and derision with which Cosmo's predictions and\nelaborate preparations had hitherto been regarded now vanished, and the\nworld, in spite of itself, shivered with vague apprehension. No\nreassurances from those savants who still refused to admit the validity\nof Cosmo Vers\u00e1l's calculations and deductions had any permanent effect\nupon the public mind.\n\nWith amusing inconsequence people sold stocks again, until all the\nexchanges were once more swept with panic--and then put the money in\ntheir strong boxes, as if they thought that the mere possession of the\nlucre could protect them. They hugged the money and remained deaf to\nCosmo's reiterated advice to build arks with it.\n\nAfter all, they were only terrified, not convinced, and they felt that,\nsomehow, everything would come out right, now that they had their\npossessions well in hand.\n\nFor, in spite of the scare, nobody really believed that an actual deluge\nwas coming. There might be great floods, and great suffering and loss,\nbut the world was not going to be drowned! Such things only occurred in\nearly and dark ages.\n\nSome nervous persons found comfort in the fact that when the skies\ncleared after the sudden downpour brilliant rainbows were seen. Their\nhearts bounded with joy.\n\n\"The 'Bow of Promise!'\" they cried. \"Behold the unvarying assurance that\nthe world shall never again be drowned.\"\n\nThen a great revival movement was set on foot, starting in the\nMississippi valley under the leadership of an eloquent exhorter, who\ndeclared that, although a false prophet had arisen, whose delusive\nprediction was contrary to Scripture, yet it was true that the world was\nabout to be punished in unexpected ways for its many iniquities.\n\nThis movement rapidly spread all over the country, and was taken up in\nEngland and throughout Protestant Europe, and soon prayers were offered\nin thousands of churches to avert the wrath of Heaven. Multitudes thus\nfound their fears turned into a new direction, and by a strange\nreaction, Cosmo Vers\u00e1l came to be regarded as a kind of Antichrist who\nwas seeking to mislead mankind.\n\nJust at this juncture, to add to the dismay and uncertainty, a grand and\nfearful comet suddenly appeared. It came up unexpectedly from the south,\nblazed brightly close beside the sun, even at noonday, and a few nights\nlater was visible after sunset with an immense fiery head and a broad\ncurved tail that seemed to pulsate from end to end. It was so bright\nthat it cast shadows at night, as distinct as those made by the moon. No\nsuch cometary monster had ever before been seen. People shuddered when\nthey looked at it. It moved with amazing speed, sweeping across the\nfirmament like a besom of destruction. Calculation showed that it was\nnot more than 3,000,000 miles from the earth.\n\nBut one night the wonder and dread awakened by the comet were magnified\na hundredfold by an occurrence so unexpected and extraordinary that the\nspectators gasped in amazement.\n\nThe writer happens to have before him an entry in a diary, which is,\nprobably, the sole contemporary record of this event. It was written in\nthe city of Washington by no less a person than Professor Jeremiah\nMoses, of the Council of the Carnegie Institution. Let it tell its own\nstory:\n\n\"A marvelous thing happened this night. I walked out into the park near\nmy house with the intention of viewing the great comet. The park on my\nside (the west), is bordered with a dense screen of tall trees, and I\nadvanced toward the open place in the center in order to have an\nunobstructed sight of the flaming stranger. As I passed across the edge\nof the shadow of the trees--the ground ahead being brilliantly\nilluminated by the light of the comet--I suddenly noticed, with an\ninvoluntary start, that I was being preceded by a _double shadow_,\nwith a black center, which forked away from my feet.\n\n\"I cast my eyes behind me to find the cause of the phenomenon, and saw,\nto my inexpressible amazement, that _the comet had divided into\ntwo_. There were two distinct heads, already widely separated, but\neach, it seemed to me, as brilliant as the original one had been, and\neach supplied with a vast plume of fire a hundred degrees in length, and\nconsequently stretching far past the zenith. The cause of the double\nshadow was evident at once--but what can have produced this sudden\ndisruption of the comet? It must have occurred since last evening, and\nalready, if the calculated distance of the comet is correct, the parts\nof the severed head are 300,000 miles asunder!\"\n\nUnderneath this entry was scribbled:\n\n\"Can this have anything to do with Cosmo Vers\u00e1l's flood?\"\n\nWhether it had anything to do with the flood or not, at any rate the\npublic believed that it had. People went about with fear written on\ntheir faces.\n\nThe double shadows had a surprising effect. The phantasm was pointed\nout, and stared at with superstitious terror by thousands every night.\nThe fact that there was nothing really mysterious about it made no\ndifference. Even those who knew well that it was an inevitable optical\nresult of the division of the bright comet were thrilled with\ninstinctive dread when they saw that forked umbra, mimicking their every\nmovement. There is nothing that so upsets the mind as a sudden change in\nthe aspect of familiar things.\n\nThe astronomers now took their turn. Those who were absolutely\nincredulous about Cosmo's prediction, and genuinely desirous of allaying\nthe popular alarm, issued statements in which, with a disingenuousness\nthat may have been unintentional, they tried to sidetrack his arguments.\n\nProfessor Pludder led the way with a pronunciamento declaring that \"the\nabsurd vaporings of the modern Nostradamus of New York\" had now\ndemonstrated their own emptiness.\n\n\"A comet,\" said Professor Pludder, with reassuring seriousness, \"cannot\ndrown the earth. It is composed of rare gases, which, as the experience\nof Halley's comet many years ago showed, are unable to penetrate the\natmosphere even when an actual encounter occurs. In this case there\ncannot even be an encounter; the comet is now moving away. Its division\nis not an unprecedented occurrence, for many previous comets have met\nwith similar accidents. This comet happened to be of unusual size, and\nthe partition of the head occurred when it was relatively nearby--whence\nthe startling phenomena observed. There is nothing to be feared.\"\n\nIt will be remarked that Professor Pludder entirely avoided the real\nissue. Cosmo Vers\u00e1l had never said that the comet would drown the earth.\nIn fact, he had been as much surprised by its appearance as everybody\nelse. But when he read Professor Pludder's statement, followed by others\nof similar import, he took up the cudgels with a vengeance. All over the\nworld, translated into a dozen languages, he scattered his reply, and\nthe effect was startling.\n\n\"My fellow-citizens of the world in all lands, and of every race,\" he\nbegan, \"you are face to face with destruction! And yet, while its\nheralds are plainly signaling from the sky, and shaking the earth with\nlightning to awaken it, blind leaders of blind try to deceive you!\n\n\"They are defying science itself!\n\n\"They say that the comet cannot touch the earth. That is true. It is\npassing away. I myself did not foresee its coming. It arrived by\naccident, _but every step that it has made through the silent depths\nof space has been a proclamation of the presence of the nebula_,\nwhich is the real agent of the perdition of the world!\n\n\"Why that ominous redness which overcasts the heavens? You have all\nnoticed it. Why that blinding brightness which the comet has displayed,\nexceeding all that has ever been beheld in such visitors. The\nexplanation is plain: the comet has been feeding on the substance of the\nnebula, which is rare yet because we have only encountered some of its\noutlying spirals.\n\n\"But it is coming on with terrible speed. In a few short months we shall\nbe plunged into its awful center, and then the oceans will swell to the\nmountaintops, and the continents will become the bottoms of angry seas.\n\n\"When the flood begins it will be too late to save yourselves. You have\nalready lost too much precious time. I tell you solemnly that not one in\na million can now be saved. Throw away every other consideration, and\ntry, try desperately, to be of the little company of those who escape!\n\n\"Remember that your only chance is in building arks--arks of levium, the\nmetal that floats. I have sent broadcast plans for such arks. They can\nbe made of any size, but the larger the better. In my own ark I can take\nonly a selected number, and when the complement is made up not another\nsoul will be admitted.\n\n\"I have established all my facts by mathematical proofs. The most expert\nmathematicians of the world have been unable to detect any error in my\ncalculations. They try to dispute the data, but the data are already\nbefore you for your own judgment. The heavens are so obscured that only\nthe brightest stars can now be seen.\" (This was a fact which had caused\nbewilderment in the observatories.) \"The recent outburst of storms and\nfloods was the second sign of the approaching end, and the third sign\nwill not be long delayed--and after that the deluge!\"\n\nIt is futile to try to describe the haunting fear and horror which\nseized upon the majority of the millions who read these words. Business\nwas paralyzed, for men found it impossible to concentrate their minds\nupon ordinary affairs. Every night the twin comets, still very bright,\nalthough they were fast retreating, brandished their fiery scimitars in\nthe sky--more fearful to the imagination now, since Cosmo Vers\u00e1l had\ndeclared that it was the nebula that stimulated their energies. And by\nday the sky was watched with anxious eyes striving to detect signs of a\ndeepening of the menacing hue, which, to an excited fancy, suggested a\ntinge of blood.\n\nNow, at last, Cosmo's warnings and entreaties bore practical fruit. Men\nbegan to inquire about places in his ark, and to make preparations for\nbuilding arks of their own.\n\nHe had not been interfered with after his memorable interview with the\nPresident of the United States, and had pushed his work at Mineola with\nredoubled energy, employing night gangs of workmen so that progress was\ncontinuous throughout the twenty-four hours.\n\nStanding on its platform, the ark, whose hull was approaching\ncompletion, rose a hundred feet into the air. It was 800 feet long and\n250 broad--proportions which practical ship-builders ridiculed, but\nCosmo, as original in this as in everything else, declared that, taking\ninto account the buoyancy of levium, no other form would answer as well.\nHe estimated that when its great engines were in place, its immense\nstores of material for producing power, its ballast, and its supplies of\nfood stowed away, and its cargo of men and animals taken aboard, it\nwould not draw more than twenty feet of water.\n\nHardly a day passed now without somebody coming to Cosmo to inquire\nabout the best method of constructing arks. He gave the required\ninformation, in all possible detail, with the utmost willingness. He\ndrew plans and sketches, made all kinds of practical suggestions, and\nnever failed to urge the utmost haste. He inspired every visitor at the\nsame time with alarm and a resolution to go to work at once.\n\nSome did go to work. But their progress was slow, and as days passed,\nand the comets gradually faded out of sight, and then the dome of the\nsky showed a tendency to resume its natural blueness, the enthusiasm of\nCosmo's imitators weakened, together with their confidence in his\nprophetic powers.\n\nThey concluded to postpone their operations until the need of arks\nshould become more evident.\n\nAs to those who had sent inquiries about places in Cosmo's ark, now that\nthe danger seemed to be blowing away, they did not even take the trouble\nto answer the very kind responses that he had made.\n\nIt is a singular circumstance that not one of these anxious inquirers\nseemed to have paid particular attention to a very significant sentence\nin his reply. If they had given it a little thought, it would probably\nhave set them pondering, although they might have been more puzzled than\nedified. The sentence ran as follows:\n\n\"While assuring you that my ark has been built for the benefit of my\nfellow men, I am bound to tell you that I reserve absolutely the right\nto determine who are truly representative of _homo sapiens_.\"\n\nThe fact was that Cosmo had been turning over in his mind the great\nfundamental question which he had asked himself when the idea of trying\nto save the human race from annihilation had first occurred to him, and\napparently he had fixed upon certain principles that were to guide him.\n\nSince, when the mind is under great strain through fear, the slightest\nrelaxation, caused by an apparently favorable change, produces a rebound\nof hope, as unreasoning as the preceding terror, so, on this occasion,\nthe vanishing of the comets, and the fading of the disquieting color of\nthe sky, had a wonderful effect in restoring public confidence in the\norderly procession of nature.\n\nCosmo Vers\u00e1l's vogue as a prophet of disaster was soon gone, and once\nmore everybody began to laugh at him. People turned again to their\nneglected affairs with the general remark that they \"guessed the world\nwould manage to wade through.\"\n\nThose who had begun preparations to build arks looked very sheepish when\ntheir friends guyed them about their childish credulity.\n\nThen a feeling of angry resentment arose, and one day Cosmo Vers\u00e1l was\nmobbed in the street, and the gamins threw stones at him.\n\nPeople forgot the extraordinary storm of lightning and rain, the split\ncomet, and all the other circumstances which, a little time before, had\nfilled them with terror.\n\nBut they were making a fearful mistake!\n\nWith eyes blindfolded they were walking straight into the jaws of\ndestruction.\n\nWithout warning, and as suddenly almost as an explosion, the _third\nsign_ appeared, and on its heels came a veritable Reign of Terror!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nTHE THIRD SIGN\n\n\nIn the middle of the night, at New York, hundreds of thousands\nsimultaneously awoke with a feeling of suffocation.\n\nThey struggled for breath as if they had suddenly been plunged into a\nsteam bath.\n\nThe air was hot, heavy, and terribly oppressive.\n\nThe throwing open of windows brought no relief. The outer air was as\nstifling as that within.\n\nIt was so dark that, on looking out, one could not see his own\ndoorsteps. The arc-lamps in the street flickered with an ineffective\nblue gleam which shed no illumination round about.\n\nHouse lights, when turned on, looked like tiny candles inclosed in thick\nblue globes.\n\nFrightened men and women stumbled around in the gloom of their chambers\ntrying to dress themselves.\n\nCries and exclamations rang from room to room; children wailed;\nhysterical mothers ran wildly hither and thither, seeking their little\nones. Many fainted, partly through terror and partly from the difficulty\nof breathing. Sick persons, seized with a terrible oppression of the\nchest, gasped, and never rose from their beds.\n\nAt every window, and in every doorway, throughout the vast city,\ninvisible heads and forms were crowded, making their presence known by\ntheir voices--distracted householders striving to peer through the\nstrange darkness, and to find out the cause of these terrifying\nphenomena.\n\nSome managed to get a faint glimpse of their watches by holding them\nclose against lamps, and thus noted the time. It was two o'clock in the\nmorning.\n\nNeighbors, unseen, called to one another, but got little comfort from\nthe replies.\n\n\"What is it? In God's name, what has happened?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I can hardly breathe.\"\n\n\"It is awful! We shall all be suffocated.\"\n\n\"Is it a fire?\"\n\n\"No! No! It cannot be a fire.\"\n\n\"The air is full of steam. The stones and the window-panes are streaming\nwith moisture.\"\n\n\"Great Heavens, how stifling it is!\"\n\nThen, into thousands of minds at once leaped the thought of _the\nflood!_\n\nThe memory of Cosmo Vers\u00e1l's reiterated warnings came back with\noverwhelming force. It must be the _third sign_ that he had\nforetold. _It had really come!_\n\nThose fateful words--\"the flood\" and \"Cosmo Vers\u00e1l\"--ran from lip to\nlip, and the hearts of those who spoke, and those who heard, sank like\nlead in their bosoms.\n\nHe would be a bold man, more confident in his powers of description than\nthe present writer, who should attempt to picture the scenes in New York\non that fearful night.\n\nThe gasping and terror-stricken millions waited and longed for the hour\nof sunrise, hoping that then the stygian darkness would be dissipated,\nso that people might, at least, see where to go and what to do. Many,\noppressed by the almost unbreathable air, gave up in despair, and no\nlonger even hoped for morning to come.\n\nIn the midst of it all a collision occurred directly over Central Park\nbetween two aero-expresses, one coming from Boston and the other from\nAlbany. (The use of small aeroplanes within the city limits had, for\nsome time, been prohibited on account of the constant danger of\ncollisions, but the long-distance lines were permitted to enter the\nmetropolitan district, making their landings and departures on specially\nconstructed towers.) These two, crowded with passengers, had, as it\nafterward appeared, completely lost their bearings--the strongest\nelectric lights being invisible a few hundred feet away, while the\nwireless signals were confusing--and, before the danger was apprehended,\nthey crashed together.\n\nThe collision occurred at a height of a thousand feet, on the Fifth\nAvenue side of the park. Both of the airships had their aeroplanes\nsmashed and their decks crumpled up, and the unfortunate crews and\npassengers were hurled through the impenetrable darkness to the ground.\n\nOnly four or five, who were lucky enough to be entangled with the\nlighter parts of the wreckage, escaped with their lives. But they were\ntoo much injured to get upon their feet, and there they lay, their\nsufferings made tenfold worse by the stifling air, and the horror of\ntheir inexplicable situation, until they were found and humanely\nrelieved, more than ten hours after their fall.\n\nThe noise of the collision had been heard in Fifth Avenue, and its\nmeaning was understood; but amid the universal terror no one thought of\ntrying to aid the victims. Everybody was absorbed in wondering what\nwould become of himself.\n\nWhen the long attended hour of sunrise approached, the watchers were\nappalled by the absence of even the slightest indication of the\nreappearance of the orb of day. There was no lightening of the dense\ncloak of darkness, and the great city seemed dead.\n\nFor the first time in its history it failed to awake after its regular\nperiod of repose, and to send forth its myriad voices. It could not be\nseen; it could not be heard; it made no sign. As far as any outward\nindication of its existence was concerned the mighty capital had ceased\nto be.\n\nIt was this frightful silence of the streets, and of all the outer\nworld, that terrified the people, cooped up in their houses, and their\nrooms, by the walls of darkness, more than almost any other\ncircumstance; it gave such an overwhelming sense of the universality of\nthe disaster, whatever that disaster might be. Except where the voices\nof neighbors could be heard, one could not be sure that the whole\npopulation, outside his own family, had not perished.\n\nAs the hours passed, and yet no light appeared, another intimidating\ncircumstance manifested itself. From the start everybody had noticed the\nexcessive humidity of the dense air. Every solid object that the hands\ncame in contact with in the darkness was wet, as if a thick fog had\ncondensed upon it. This supersaturation of the air (a principal cause of\nthe difficulty experienced in breathing) led to a result which would\nquickly have been foreseen if people could have had the use of their\neyes, but which, coming on invisibly, produced a panic fear when at last\nits presence was strikingly forced upon the attention.\n\nThe moisture collected on all exposed surfaces--on the roofs, the walls,\nthe pavements--until its quantity became sufficient to form little\nrills, which sought the gutters, and there gathered force and volume.\nPresently the streams became large enough to create a noise of flowing\nwater that attracted the attention of the anxious watchers at the open\nwindows. Then cries of dismay arose. If the water had been visible it\nwould not have been terrible.\n\nBut, to the overstrained imagination, the bubbling and splashing sound\nthat came out of the darkness was magnified into the rush of a torrent.\nIt seemed to grow louder every moment. What was but a murmur on the\near-drum became a roar in the excited brain-cells.\n\nOnce more were heard the ominous words, \"The flood!\"\n\nThey spread from room to room, and from house to house. The wild scenes\nthat had attended the first awakening were tame in comparison with what\nnow occurred. Self-control, reason--everything--gave way to panic.\n\nIf they could only have _seen_ what they were about!\n\nBut then they would not have been about it. Then their reason would not\nhave been dethroned.\n\nDarkness is the microscope of the imagination, and it magnifies a\nmillion times!\n\nSome timorously descended their doorsteps, and feeling a current of\nwater in the gutter, recoiled with cries of horror, as if they had\nslipped down the bank of a flooded river. As they retreated they\nbelieved that the water was rising at their heels!\n\nOthers made their way to the roofs, persuaded that the flood was already\ninundating the basements and the lower stories of their dwellings.\n\nWomen wrung their hands and wept, and children cried, and men pushed and\nstumbled about, and shouted, and would have done something if only they\ncould have seen what to do. That was the pity of it! It was as if the\nworld had been stricken blind, and then the trump of an archangel had\nsounded, crying:\n\n\"Fly! Fly! for the Avenger is on your heels!\"\n\nHow could they fly?\n\nThis awful strain could not have lasted. It would have needed no deluge\nto finish New York if that maddening pall of darkness had remained\nunbroken a few hours longer. But, just when thousands had given up in\ndespair, there came a rapid change.\n\nAt the hour of noon light suddenly broke overhead. Beginning in a round\npatch inclosed in an iridescent halo, it spread swiftly, seeming to melt\nits way down through the thick, dark mass that choked the air, and in\nless than fifteen minutes New York and all its surroundings emerged into\nthe golden light of noonday.\n\nPeople who had expected at any moment to feel the water pitilessly\nrising about them looked out of their windows, and were astonished to\nsee only tiny rivulets which were already shriveling out of sight in the\ngutters. In a few minutes there was no running water left, although the\ndampness on the walls and walks showed how great the humidity of the air\nhad been.\n\nAt the same time the oppression was lifted from the respiratory\napparatus, and everybody breathed freely once more, and felt courage\nreturning with each respiration.\n\nThe whole great city seemed to utter a vast sigh of relief.\n\nAnd then its voice was heard, as it had never been heard before, rising\nhigher and louder every moment. It was the first time that morning had\never broken at midday.\n\nThe streets became filled, with magical quickness, by hundreds of\nthousands, who chattered, and shouted, and laughed, and shook hands, and\nasked questions, and told their experiences, and demanded if anybody had\never heard of such a thing before, and wondered what it could have been,\nand what it meant, and whether it would come back again.\n\nTelephones of all kinds were kept constantly busy. Women called up their\nfriends, and talked hysterically; men called up their associates and\npartners, and tried to talk business.\n\nThere was a rush for the Elevated, for the Subways, for the street\nauto-cars. The great arteries of traffic became jammed, and the noise\nrose louder and louder.\n\nBelated aero-expresses arrived at the towers from East and West, and\ntheir passengers hurried down to join the excited multitudes below.\n\nIn an incredibly brief time the newsboys were out with extras. Then\neverybody read with the utmost avidity what everybody knew already.\n\nBut before many hours passed there was real news, come by wireless, and\nby submarine telephone and telegraph, telling how the whole world had\nbeen swept by the marvelous cloak of darkness.\n\nIn Europe it had arrived during the morning hours; in Asia during the\nafternoon.\n\nThe phenomena had varied in different places. In some the darkness had\nnot been complete, but everywhere it was accompanied by extraordinary\nhumidity, and occasionally by brief but torrential rains. The terror had\nbeen universal, and all believed that it was the _third sign_\npredicted by Cosmo Vers\u00e1l.\n\nOf course, the latter was interviewed, and he gave out a characteristic\nmanifesto.\n\n\"One of the outlying spirals of the nebula has struck the earth,\" he\nsaid. \"But do not be deceived. It is nothing in comparison with what is\ncoming. _And it is the LAST WARNING that will be given!_ You have\nobstinately shut your eyes to the truth, _and you have thrown away\nyour lives!_\"\n\nThis, together with the recent awful experience, produced a great\neffect. Those who had begun to lay foundations for arks thought of\nresuming the work. Those who had before sought places with Cosmo called\nhim up by telephone. But only the voice of Joseph Smith answered, and\nhis words were not reassuring.\n\n\"Mr. Vers\u00e1l,\" he said, \"directs me to say that at present he will allot\nno places. He is considering whom he will take.\"\n\nThe recipients of this reply looked very blank. But at least one of\nthem, a well-known broker in Wall Street, was more angered than\nfrightened:\n\n\"Let him go to the deuce!\" he growled; \"him and his flood together!\"\n\nThen he resolutely set out to bull the market.\n\nIt seems incredible--but such is human nature--that a few days of bright\nsunshine should once more have driven off the clouds of fear that had\nsettled so densely over the popular mind. Of course, not everybody\nforgot the terrors of the _third sign_--they had struck too deep,\nbut gradually the strain was relaxed, and people in general accepted the\nrenewed assurances of the savants of the Pludder type that nothing that\nhad occurred was inexplicable by the ordinary laws of nature. The great\ndarkness, they averred, differed from previous occurrences of the kind\nonly in degree, and it was to be ascribed to nothing more serious than\natmospheric vagaries, such as that which produced the historic Dark Day\nin New England in the year 1780.\n\nBut more nervous persons noticed, with certain misgivings, that Cosmo\nVers\u00e1l pushed on his operations, if possible more energetically than\nbefore. And there was a stir of renewed interest when the announcement\ncame out one day that the ark was finished. Then thousands hurried to\nMineola to look upon the completed work.\n\nThe extraordinary massiveness of the ark was imposing. Towering\nominously on its platform, which was so arranged that when the waters\ncame they should lift the structure from its cradle and set it afloat\nwithout any other launching, it seemed in itself a prophecy of impending\ndisaster.\n\nOverhead it was roofed with an oblong dome of levium, through which rose\nfour great metallic chimneys, placed above the mighty engines. The roof\nsloped down to the vertical sides, to afford protection from in-bursting\nwaves. Rows of portholes, covered with thick, stout glass, indicated the\nlocation of the superposed decks. On each side four gangways gave access\nto the interior, and long, sloping approaches offered means of entry\nfrom the ground.\n\nCosmo had a force of trained guards on hand, but everybody who wished\nwas permitted to enter and inspect the ark. Curious multitudes\nconstantly mounted and descended the long approaches, being kept moving\nby the guards.\n\nInside they wandered about astonished by what they saw.\n\nThe three lower decks were devoted to the storage of food and of fuel\nfor the electric generators which Cosmo Vers\u00e1l had been accumulating for\nmonths.\n\nAbove these were two decks, which the visitors were informed would be\noccupied by animals, and by boxes of seeds and prepared roots of plants,\nwith which it was intended to restore the vegetable life of the planet\nafter the water should have sufficiently receded.\n\nThe five remaining decks were for human beings. There were roomy\nquarters for the commander and his officers, others for the crew,\nseveral large saloons, and five hundred sets of apartments of various\nsizes to be occupied by the passengers whom Cosmo should choose to\naccompany him. They had all the convenience of the most luxurious\nstaterooms of the trans-oceanic liners. Many joking remarks were\nexchanged by the visitors as they inspected these rooms.\n\nCosmo ran about among his guests, explaining everything, showing great\npride in his work, pointing out a thousand particulars in which his\nforesight had been displayed--but, to everybody's astonishment, he\nuttered no more warnings, and made no appeals. On the contrary, as some\nobservant persons noticed, he seemed to avoid any reference to the fate\nof those who should not be included in his ship's company.\n\nSome sensitive souls were disturbed by detecting in his eyes a look that\nseemed to express deep pity and regret. Occasionally he would draw\napart, and gaze at the passing crowds with a compassionate expression,\nand then, slowly turning his back, while his fingers worked nervously,\nwould disappear, with downcast head, in his private room.\n\nThe comparatively few who particularly noticed this conduct of Cosmo's\nwere deeply moved--more than they had been by all the enigmatic events\nof the past months. One man, Amos Blank, a rich manufacturer, who was\nnotorious for the merciless methods that he had pursued in eliminating\nhis weaker competitors, was so much disturbed by Cosmo Vers\u00e1l's change\nof manner that he sought an opportunity to speak to him privately. Cosmo\nreceived him with a reluctance that he could not but notice, and which,\nsomehow, increased his anxiety.\n\n\"I--I--thought,\" said the billionaire hesitatingly, \"that I ought--that\nis to say, that I might, perhaps, inquire--might inform myself--under\nwhat conditions one could, supposing the necessity to arise, obtain a\npassage in your--in your ark. Of course the question of cost does not\nenter in the matter--not with me.\"\n\nCosmo gazed at the man coldly, and all the compassion that had recently\nsoftened his steely eyes disappeared. For a moment he did not speak.\nThen he said, measuring his words and speaking with an emphasis that\nchilled the heart of his listener:\n\n\"Mr. Blank, the necessity has arisen.\"\n\n\"So you say--so you say--\" began Mr. Blank.\n\n\"So I say,\" interrupted Cosmo sternly, \"and I say further that this ark\nhas been constructed to save those who are worthy of salvation, in order\nthat all that is good and admirable in humanity may not perish from the\nearth.\"\n\n\"Exactly, exactly,\" responded the other, smiling, and rubbing his hands.\n\"You are quite right to make a proper choice. If your flood is going to\ncause a general destruction of mankind, of course you are bound to\nselect the best, the most advanced, those who have pushed to the front,\nthose who have means, those with the strongest resources. The masses,\nwho possess none of these qualifications and claims--\"\n\nAgain Cosmo Vers\u00e1l interrupted him, more coldly than before:\n\n\"It costs nothing to be a passenger in this ark. Ten million dollars, a\nhundred millions, would not purchase a place in it! Did you ever hear\nthe parable of the camel and the needle's eye? The price of a ticket\nhere is an irreproachable record!\"\n\nWith these astonishing words Cosmo turned his back upon his visitor and\nshut the door in his face.\n\nThe billionaire staggered back, rubbed his head, and then went off\nmuttering:\n\n\"An idiot! A plain idiot! There will be no flood.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nSELECTING THE FLOWER OF MANKIND\n\n\nAfter a day or two, during which the ark was left open for inspection,\nand was visited by many thousands, Cosmo Vers\u00e1l announced that no more\nvisitors would be admitted. He placed sentinels at all entrances, and\nbegan the construction of a shallow ditch, entirely inclosing the\ngrounds. Public curiosity was intensely excited by this singular\nproceeding, especially when it became known that the workmen were\nstringing copper wires the whole length of the ditch.\n\n\"What the deuce is he up to now?\" was the question on everybody's lips.\n\nBut Cosmo and his employees gave evasive replies to all inquiries. A\ngreat change had come about in Cosmo's treatment of the public. No one\nwas any longer encouraged to watch the operations.\n\nWhen the wires were all placed and the ditch was finished, it was\ncovered up so that it made a broad flat-topped wall, encircling the\nfield.\n\nSpeculation was rife for several days concerning the purpose of the\nmysterious ditch and its wires, but no universally satisfactory\nexplanation was found.\n\nOne enterprising reporter worked out an elaborate scheme, which he\nascribed to Cosmo Vers\u00e1l, according to which the wired ditch was to\nserve as a cumulator of electricity, which would, at the proper moment,\nlaunch the ark upon the waters, thus avoiding all danger of a fatal\ndetention in case the flood should rise too rapidly.\n\nThis seemed so absurd on its face that it went far to quiet apprehension\nby reawakening doubts of Cosmo's sanity--the more especially since he\nmade no attempt to contradict the assertion that the scheme was his.\n\nNobody guessed what his real intention was; if people had guessed, it\nmight have been bad for their peace of mind.\n\nThe next move of Cosmo Vers\u00e1l was taken without any knowledge or\nsuspicion on the part of the public. He had now established himself in\nhis apartments in the ark, and was never seen in the city.\n\nOne evening, when all was quiet about the ark, night work being now\nunnecessary, Cosmo and Joseph Smith sat facing one another at a square\ntable lighted by a shaded lamp. Smith had a pile of writing paper before\nhim, and was evidently prepared to take copious notes.\n\nCosmo's great brow was contracted with thought, and he leaned his cheek\nupon his hand. It was clear that his meditations were troublesome. For\nat least ten minutes he did not open his lips, and Smith watched him\nanxiously. At last he said, speaking slowly:\n\n\"Joseph, this is the most trying problem that I have had to solve. The\nsuccess of all my work depends upon my not making a mistake now.\n\n\"The burden of responsibility that rests on my shoulders is such as no\nmortal has ever borne. It is too great for human capacity--and yet how\ncan I cast it off?\n\n\"I am to decide who shall be saved! _I_, _I_ alone, _I_,\nCosmo Vers\u00e1l, hold in my hands the fate of a race numbering two thousand\nmillion souls!--the fate of a planet which, without my intervention,\nwould become simply a vast tomb. It is for _me_ to say whether the\n_genus homo_ shall be perpetuated, and in what form it shall be\nperpetuated. Joseph, this is terrible! These are the functions of deity,\nnot of man.\"\n\nJoseph Smith seemed no longer to breathe, so intense was his attention.\nHis eyes glowed under the dark brows, and his pencil trembled in his\nfingers. After a slight pause Cosmo Vers\u00e1l went on:\n\n\"If I felt any doubt that Providence had foreordained me to do this\nwork, and given me extraordinary faculties, and extraordinary knowledge,\nto enable me to perform it, I would, this instant, blow out my brains.\"\n\nAgain he was silent, the secretary, after fidgeting about, bending and\nunbending his brows, and tapping nervously upon the table, at last said\nsolemnly:\n\n\"Cosmo, you _are_ ordained; you must _do the work._\"\n\n\"I must,\" returned Cosmo Vers\u00e1l, \"I know that; and yet the sense of my\nresponsibility sometimes covers me with a cloud of despair. The other\nday, when the ark was crowded with curiosity seekers, the thought that\nnot one of all those tens of thousands could escape, and that hundreds\nof millions of others must also be lost, overwhelmed me. Then I began to\nreproach myself for not having been a more effective agent in warning my\nfellows of their peril. Joseph, I have miserably failed. I ought to have\nproduced universal conviction that I was right, and I have not done it.\"\n\n\"It is not your fault, Cosmo,\" said Joseph Smith, reaching out his long\narm to touch his leader's hand. \"It is an unbelieving generation. They\nhave rejected even the signs in the heavens. The voice of an archangel\nwould not have convinced them.\"\n\n\"It is true,\" replied Cosmo. \"And the truth is the more bitter to me\nbecause I spoke in the name of science, and the very men who represent\nscience have been my most determined opponents, blinding the people's\neyes--after willfully shutting their own.\"\n\n\"You say you have been weak,\" interposed Smith, \"which you have not\nbeen; but you would be weak if you now shrank from your plain duty.\"\n\n\"True!\" cried Cosmo, in a changed voice. \"Let us then proceed. I had a\nlesson the other day. Amos Blank came to me, puffed with his pillaged\nmillions. I saw then what I had to do. I told him plainly that he was\nnot among the chosen. Hand me that book over there.\"\n\nThe secretary pushed a large volume within Cosmo's reach. He opened it.\nIt was a \"Year-Book of Science, Politics, Sociology, History, and\nGovernment.\"\n\nCosmo ran over its pages, stopping to read a few lines here and there,\nseeming to make mental notes. After a while he pushed the book aside,\nlooked at his companion thoughtfully, and began:\n\n\"The trouble with the world is that morally and physically it has for\nthousands of years grown more and more corrupt. The flower of\ncivilization, about which people boast so much, nods over the stagnant\nwaters of a moral swamp and draws its perilous beauty from the poisons\nof the miasma.\n\n\"The nebula, in drowning the earth, brings opportunity for a new birth\nof mankind. You will remember, Joseph, that the same conditions are said\nto have prevailed in the time of Noah. There was no science then, and we\ndo not know exactly on what principles the choice was made of those who\nshould escape; but the simple history of Noah shows that he and his\nfriends represented the best manhood of that early age.\n\n\"But the seeds of corruption were not eliminated, and the same problem\nrecurs to-day.\n\n\"I have to determine whom I will save. I attack the question by\ninquiring who represent the best elements of humanity? Let us first\nconsider men by classes.\"\n\n\"And why not by races?\" asked Smith.\n\n\"I shall not look to see whether a man is black, white, or yellow;\nwhether his skull is brachycephalic or dolichocephalic,\" replied Cosmo.\n\"I shall look inside. No race has ever shown itself permanently the\nbest.\"\n\n\"Then by classes you mean occupations?\"\n\n\"Well, yes, for the occupation shows the tendency, the quintessence of\ncharacter. Some men are born rulers and leaders; others are born\nfollowers. Both are necessary, and I must have both kinds.\"\n\n\"You will begin perhaps with the kings, the presidents?\"\n\n\"Not at all. I shall begin with the men of science. They are the true\nleaders.\"\n\n\"But they have betrayed you--they have shut their eyes and blindfolded\nothers,\" objected Joseph Smith, as if in extenuation.\n\n\"You do not understand me,\" said Cosmo, with a commiserating smile. \"If\nmy scientific brethren have not seen as clearly as I have done, the\nfault lies not in science, but in lack of comprehension. Nevertheless,\nthey are on the right track; they have the gist of the matter in them;\nthey are trained in the right method. If I should leave them out, the\nregenerated world would start a thousand years behind time. Besides,\nmany of them are not so blind; some of them have got a glimpse of the\ntruth.\"\n\n\"Not such men as Pludder,\" said Smith.\n\n\"All the same, I am going to save Pludder,\" said Cosmo Vers\u00e1l.\n\nJoseph Smith fairly jumped with astonishment.\n\n\"You--are--going--to--save--Pludder,\" he faltered. \"But he is the worst\nof all.\"\n\n\"Not from my present view-point. Pludder has a good brain; he can handle\nthe tools; he is intellectually honest; he has done great things for\nscience in the past. And, besides, I do not conceal from you the fact\nthat I should like to see him convicted out of his own mouth.\"\n\n\"But,\" persisted Smith, \"I have heard you say that he was--\"\n\n\"No matter what you have heard me say,\" interrupted Cosmo impatiently.\n\"I say now that he shall go with us. Put down his name at the head of\nthe list.\"\n\nDumfounded and muttering under his breath, Smith obeyed.\n\n\"I can take exactly one thousand individuals, exclusive of the crew,\"\ncontinued Vers\u00e1l, paying no attention to his confidant's repeated\nshaking of his head. \"Good Heavens, think of that! One thousand out of\ntwo thousand millions! But so be it. Nobody would listen to me, and now\nit is too late. I must fix the number for each class.\"\n\n\"There is one thing--one curious question--that occurs to me,\" put in\nSmith hesitatingly. \"What about families?\"\n\n\"There you've hit it,\" cried Cosmo. \"That's exactly what bothers me.\nThere must be as many women as men--that goes without saying. Then, too,\nthe strongest moral element is in the women, although they don't weigh\nheavily for science. But the aged people and the children--there's the\ndifficulty. If I invite a man who possesses unquestionable\nqualifications, but has a large family, what am I to do? I can't crowd\nout others as desirable as he for the sake of carrying all of his\nstirpes. The principles of eugenics demand a wide field of selection.\"\n\nCosmo Vers\u00e1l covered his eyes, rested his big head on his hands, and his\nelbows on the table. Presently he looked up with an air of decision.\n\n\"I see what I must do,\" he said. \"I can take only four persons belonging\nto any one family. Two of them may be children--a man, his wife, and two\nchildren--no more.\"\n\n\"But that will be very hard lines for them--\" began Joseph Smith.\n\n\"Hard lines!\" Cosmo broke in. \"Do you think it is easy lines for me?\nGood Heavens, man! I am forced to this decision. It rends my heart to\nthink of it, but I can't avoid the responsibility.\"\n\nSmith dropped his eyes, and Cosmo resumed his reflections. In a little\nwhile he spoke again:\n\n\"Another thing that I must fix is an age limit. But that will have to be\nsubject to certain exceptions. Very aged persons in general will not\ndo--they could not survive the long voyage, and only in the rare\ninstances where their experience of life might be valuable would they\nserve any good purpose in re\u00ebstablishing the race. Children are\nindispensable--but they must not be too young--infants in arms would not\ndo at all. Oh, this is sorry work! But I must harden my heart.\"\n\nJoseph Smith looked at his chief, and felt a twinge of sympathy,\ntempered by admiration, for he saw clearly the terrible contest in his\nfriend's mind and appreciated the heroic nature of the decision to which\nthe inexorable logic of facts had driven it.\n\nCosmo Vers\u00e1l was again silent for a long time. Finally he appeared to\nthrow off the incubus, and, with a return of his ordinary decisiveness,\nexclaimed:\n\n\"Enough. I have settled the general principle. Now to the choice.\"\n\nThen, closing his eyes, as if to assist his memory, he ran over a list\nof names well known in the world of science, and Smith set them down in\na long row under the name of \"Abiel Pludder,\" with which he had begun.\n\nAt last Cosmo Vers\u00e1l ceased his dictation.\n\n\"There,\" he said, \"that is the end of that category. I may add to or\nsubtract from it later. According to probability, making allowance for\nbachelors, each name will represent three persons; there are\nseventy-five names, which means two hundred and twenty-five places\nreserved for science. I will now make a series of other categories and\nassign the number of places for each.\"\n\nHe seized a sheet of paper and fell to work, while Smith looked on,\ndrumming with his fingers and contorting his huge black eyebrows. For\nhalf an hour complete silence reigned, broken only by the gliding sound\nof Cosmo Vers\u00e1l's pencil, occasionally emphasized by a soft thump. At\nthe end of that time he threw down the pencil and held out the paper to\nhis companion.\n\n\"Of course,\" he said, \"this is not a complete list of human occupations.\nI have set down the principal ones as they occurred to me. There will be\ntime to correct any oversight. Read it.\"\n\nSmith, by force of habit, read it aloud:\n\n                               No. of    Probable No.\nOccupation                     Names      of Places\n\nScience (already assigned)      75           225\nRulers                          15            45\nStatesmen                       10            30\nBusiness magnates               10            30\nPhilanthropists                  5            15\nArtists                         15            45\nReligious teachers              20            60\nSchool-teachers                 20            60\nDoctors                         30            90\nLawyers                          1             3\nWriters                          6            18\nEditors                          2             6\nPlayers                         14            42\nPhilosophers                     1             3\nMusicians                       12            36\nSpeculative geniuses             3             9\n\"Society\"                        0             0\nAgriculture and mechanics       90           270\n                              ____          ____\n            Totals             329           987\nSpecial reservations                          13\n                                            ____\n            Grand total, places             1000\n\nSeveral times while Joseph Smith was reading he raised his eyebrows, as\nif in surprise or mental protest, but made no remark.\n\n\"Now,\" resumed Cosmo when the secretary had finished, \"let us begin with\nthe rulers. I do not know them as intimately as I know the men of\nscience, but I am sure I have given them places enough. Suppose you take\nthis book and call them over to me.\"\n\nSmith opened the \"year-book,\" and began:\n\n\"George Washington Samson, President of the United States.\"\n\n\"He goes. He is not intellectually brilliant, but he has strong sense\nand good moral fiber. I'll save him if for no other reason than his veto\nof the Antarctic Continent grab bill.\"\n\n\"Shen Su, Son of Heaven, President-Emperor of China.\"\n\n\"Put him down. I like him. He is a true Confucian.\"\n\nJoseph Smith read off several other names at which Cosmo shook his head.\nThen he came to:\n\n\"Richard Edward, by the grace of God, King of Great--\"\n\n\"Enough,\" broke in Cosmo; \"we all know him--the man who has done more\nfor peace by putting half the British navy out of commission than any\nother ruler in history. I can't leave him out.\"\n\n\"Achille Dumont, President of the French republic.\"\n\n\"I'll take him.\"\n\n\"William IV, German Emperor.\"\n\n\"Admitted, for he has at last got the war microbe out of the family\nblood.\"\n\nThen followed a number of rulers who were not lucky enough to meet with\nCosmo Vers\u00e1l's approval, and when Smith read:\n\n\"Alexander V, Emperor of all the Russias,\" the big head was violently\nshaken, and its owner exclaimed:\n\n\"There will be many Russians in the ark, for tyranny has been like a\nlustration to that people; but I will carry none of its Romanoff seeds\nto my new world.\"\n\nThe selection was continued until fifteen names had been obtained,\nincluding that of the new, dark-skinned President of Liberia, and Cosmo\ndeclared that he would not add another one.\n\nThen came the ten statesmen who were chosen with utter disregard to\nracial and national lines.\n\nIn selecting his ten business magnates, Cosmo stated his rule:\n\n\"I exclude no man simply because he is a billionaire. I consider the way\nhe made his money. The world must always have rich men. How could I have\nbuilt the ark if I had been poor?\"\n\n\"Philanthropists,\" read Smith.\n\n\"I should have taken a hundred if I could have found them,\" said Cosmo.\n\"There are plenty of candidates, but these five [naming them] are the\nonly genuine ones, and I am doubtful about several of them. But I must\nrun some chances, philanthropy being indispensable.\"\n\nFor the fifteen representatives of art Cosmo confined his selection\nlargely to architecture.\n\n\"The building instinct must be preserved,\" he explained. \"One of the\nfirst things we shall need after the flood recedes is a variety of all\nkinds of structures. But it's a pretty bad lot at the best. I shall try\nto reform their ideas during the voyage. As to the other artists, they,\ntoo, will need some hints that I can give them, and that they can\ntransmit to their children.\"\n\nUnder the head of religious teachers, Cosmo remarked that he had tried\nto be fair to all forms of genuine faith that had a large following. The\nschool-teachers represented the principal languages, and Cosmo selected\nthe names from a volume on \"The Educational Systems of the World,\"\nremarking that he ran some risk here, but it could not easily be\navoided.\n\n\"Doctors--they get a rather liberal allowance, don't they?\" asked Smith.\n\n\"Not half as large as I'd like to have it,\" was the response. \"The\ndoctors are the salt of the earth. It breaks my heart to have to leave\nout so many whose worth I know.\"\n\n\"And only one lawyer!\" pursued Joseph. \"That's curious.\"\n\n\"Not in the least curious. Do you think I want to scatter broadcast the\nseeds of litigation in a regenerated world? Put down the name of Chief\nJustice Good of the United States Supreme Court. He'll see that equity\nprevails.\"\n\n\"And only six writers,\" continued Smith.\n\n\"And that's probably too many,\" said Cosmo. \"Set down under that head\nPeter Inkson, whom I will engage to record the last scenes on the\ndrowning earth; James Henry Blackwitt, who will tell the story of the\nvoyage; Jules Bourgeois, who can describe the personnel of the\npassengers; Sergius Narishkoff, who will make a study of their\npsychology; and Nicolao Ludolfo, whose description of the ark will be an\ninvaluable historic document a thousand years hence.\"\n\n\"But you have included no poets,\" remarked Smith.\n\n\"Not necessary,\" responded Cosmo. \"Every human being is a poet at\nbottom.\"\n\n\"And no novelists,\" persisted the secretary.\n\n\"They will spring up thicker than weeds before the waters are half\ngone--at least, they would if I let one aboard the ark.\"\n\n\"Editors--two?\"\n\n\"That's right. And two too many, perhaps. I'll take Jinks of the\n_Thunderer_, and Bullock of the _Owl._\"\n\n\"But both of them have persistently called you an idiot.\"\n\n\"For that reason I want them. No world could get along without some real\nidiots.\"\n\n\"I am rather surprised at the next entry, if you will permit me to speak\nof it,\" said Joseph Smith. \"Here you have forty-two places reserved for\nplayers.\"\n\n\"That means twenty-eight adults, and probably some youngsters who will\nbe able to take parts,\" returned Cosmo, rubbing his hands with a\nsatisfied smile. \"I have taken as many players as I conscientiously\ncould, not only because of their future value, but because they will do\nmore than anything else to keep up the spirits of everybody in the ark.\nI shall have a stage set in the largest saloon.\"\n\nJoseph Smith scowled, but held his peace. Then, glancing again at the\npaper, he remarked that there was but one philosopher to be provided\nfor.\n\n\"It is easy to name him,\" said Cosmo. \"Kant Jacobi Leergeschw\u00e4tz.\"\n\n\"Why he?\"\n\n\"Because he will harmlessly represent the metaphysical _genus_, for\nnobody will ever understand him.\"\n\n\"Musicians twelve?\"\n\n\"Chosen for the same reason as the players,\" said Cosmo, rapidly writing\ndown twelve names because they were not easy to pronounce, and handing\nthem to Smith, who duly copied them off.\n\nWhen this was done Cosmo himself called out the next\ncategory--\"'speculative geniuses.'\"\n\n\"I mean by that,\" he continued, \"not Wall Street speculators, but\nforeseeing men who possess the gift of looking into the 'seeds of time,'\nbut who never get a hearing in their own day, and are hardly ever\nremembered by the future ages which enjoy the fruits whose buds they\nrecognized.\"\n\nCosmo mentioned two names which Joseph Smith had never heard, and told\nhim they ought to be written in golden ink.\n\n\"They are _sui generis_, and alone in the world. They are the most\nprecious cargo I shall have aboard,\" he added.\n\nSmith shrugged his shoulders and stared blankly at the paper, while\nCosmo sank into a reverie. Finally the secretary said, smiling with\nevident approval this time:\n\n\"'Society' zero.\"\n\n\"Precisely, for what does 'society' represent except its own vanity?\"\n\n\"And then comes agriculture and mechanics.\"\n\nFor this category Cosmo seemed to be quite as well prepared as for that\nof science. He took from his pocket a list already made out and handed\nit to Joseph Smith. It contained forty names marked \"cultivators,\nfarmers, gardeners,\" and fifty \"mechanics.\"\n\n\"At the beginning of the twentieth century,\" he said, \"I should have had\nto reverse that proportion--in fact, my entire list would then have been\ntop-heavy, and I should have been forced to give half of all the places\nto agriculture. But thanks to our scientific farming, the personnel\nemployed in cultivation is now reduced to a minimum while showing\nmaximum results. I have already stored the ark with seeds of the latest\nscientifically developed plants, and with all the needed agricultural\nimplements and machinery.\"\n\n\"There yet remain thirteen places 'specially reserved,'\" said Smith,\nreferring to the paper.\n\n\"I shall fill those later,\" responded Cosmo, and then added with a\nthoughtful look, \"I have some humble friends.\"\n\n\"The next thing,\" he continued, after a pause, \"is to prepare the\nletters of invitation. But we have done enough for to-night. I will give\nyou the form to-morrow.\"\n\nAnd all this while half the world had been peacefully sleeping, and the\nother half going about its business, more and more forgetful of recent\nevents, and if it had known what those two men were about it would\nprobably have exploded in a gust of laughter.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nTHE WATERS BEGIN TO RISE\n\n\nCosmo Vers\u00e1l had begun the construction of his ark in the latter part of\nJune. It was now the end of November. The terrors of the _third\nsign_ had occurred in September. Since then the sky had nearly\nresumed its normal color, there had been no storms, but the heat of\nsummer had not relaxed. People were puzzled by the absence of the usual\nindications of autumn, although vegetation had shriveled on account of\nthe persistent high temperature and constant sunshine.\n\n\"An extraordinary year,\" admitted the meteorologists, \"but there have\nbeen warm falls before, and it is simply a question of degree. Nature\nwill restore the balance and in good time, and probably we shall have a\nsevere winter.\"\n\nOn the 31st of November, the brassy sky at New York showed no signs of\nchange, when the following dispatch, which most of the newspapers\ntriple-leaded and capped with stunning headlines, quivered down from\nChurchill, Keewatin:\n\n    During last night the level of the water in Hudson Bay rose\n    fully nine feet. Consternation reigned this morning when\n    ship-owners found their wharves inundated, and vessels straining\n    at short cables. The ice-breaker \"Victoria\" was lifted on the\n    back of a sandy bar, having apparently been driven by a heavy\n    wave, which must have come from the East. There are other\n    indications that the mysterious rise began with a \"bore\" from\n    the eastward. It is thought that the vast mass of icebergs set\n    afloat on Davis's Strait by the long continued hot weather\n    melting the shore glaciers, has caused a jam off the mouth of\n    Hudson Strait, and turned the Polar current suddenly into the\n    bay. But this is only a theory. A further rise is anticipated.\n\nStartling as was this news, it might not, by itself, have greatly\ndisturbed the public mind if it had not been followed, in a few hours,\nby intelligence of immense floods in Alaska and in the basin of the\nMackenzie River.\n\nAnd the next day an etherogram from Obdorsk bordered on the grotesque,\nand filled many sensitive readers with horror.\n\nIt is said that in the vast tundra regions of Northern Siberia the\nfrozen soil had dissolved into a bottomless slough, from whose depths\nuprose prehistoric mammoths, their long hair matted with mud, and their\ncurved tusks of ivory gleaming like trumpets over the field of their\nresurrection. The dispatch concluded with a heart-rending account of the\nloss of a large party of ivory hunters, who, having ventured too far\nfrom the more solid land, suddenly found the ground turning to black\nooze beneath their feet, and, despite their struggles, were all engulfed\nwithin sight of their friends, who dared not try to approach them.\n\nCosmo Vers\u00e1l, when interviewed, calmly remarked that the flood was\nbeginning in the north, because it was the northern part of the globe\nthat was nearest the heart of the nebula. The motion of the earth being\nnorthward, that end of its axis resembled the prow of a ship.\n\n\"But this,\" he added, \"is not the true deluge. The Arctic ice-cap is\nmelting, and the frozen soil is turning into a sponge in consequence of\nthe heat of friction developed in the air by the inrush of nebulous\nmatter. The aqueous vapor, however, has not yet touched the earth. It\nwill begin to manifest its presence within a few days, and then the\nglobe will drink water at every pore. The vapor will finally condense\ninto falling oceans.\"\n\n\"What would you advise people to do?\" asked one of the reporters.\n\nThe reply was given in a perfectly even voice, without change of\ncountenance:\n\n\"_Commit suicide_! They have practically done that already.\"\n\nIt was nearly two weeks later when the first signs of a change of\nweather were manifested in middle latitudes. It came on with a rapid\nveiling of the sky, followed by a thin, misty, persistent rain. The heat\ngrew more oppressive, but the rain did not become heavier, and after a\nfew days there would be, for several consecutive hours, a clear spell,\nduring which the sun would shine, though with a sickly, pallid light.\n\nThere was a great deal of mystification abroad, and nobody felt at ease.\nStill, the ebullitions of terror that had accompanied the earlier\ncaprices of the elements were not renewed. People were getting used to\nthese freaks.\n\nIn the middle of one of the clear spells a remarkable scene occurred at\nMineola.\n\nIt was like a panorama of the seventh chapter of Genesis.\n\nIt was the procession of the beasts.\n\nCosmo Vers\u00e1l had concluded that the time was come for housing his\nanimals in the ark. He wished to accustom them to their quarters before\nthe voyage began. The resulting spectacle filled the juvenile world with\nirrepressible joy, and immensely interested their elders.\n\nNo march of a menagerie had ever come within sight of equaling this\ndisplay. Many of the beasts were such as no one there had ever seen\nbefore. Cosmo had consulted experts, but, in the end, he had been guided\nin his choice by his own judgment. Nobody knew as well as he exactly\nwhat was wanted. He had developed in his mind a scheme for making the\nnew world that was to emerge from the waters better in every respect\nthan the old one.\n\nMingled with such familiar creatures as sheep, cows, dogs, and barn-yard\nfowls, were animals of the past, which the majority of the onlookers had\nonly read about or seen pictures of, or perhaps, in a few cases, heard\ndescribed in childhood, by grandfathers long since sleeping in their\ngraves.\n\nCosmo had rapidly collected them from all parts of the world, but as\nthey arrived in small consignments, and were carried in closed vans,\nvery few persons had any idea of what he was doing.\n\nThe greatest sensation was produced by four beautiful horses, which had\nbeen purchased at an enormous price from an English duke, who never\nwould have parted with them--for they were almost the last living\nrepresentatives of the equine race left on the earth--if financial\nstress had not compelled the sacrifice.\n\nThese splendid animals were dapple gray, with long white tails, and\nflowing manes borne proudly on their arching necks, and as they were led\nat the head of the procession, snorting at the unwonted scene about\nthem, their eyes bright with excitement, prancing and curvetting, cries\nof admiration and rounds of applause broke from the constantly growing\nthrongs of spectators.\n\nThose who had only known the horse from pictures and sculptures were\nfilled with astonishment by its living beauty. People could not help\nsaying to themselves:\n\n\"What a pity that the honking auto, in its hundred forms of mechanical\nugliness, should have driven these beautiful and powerful creatures out\nof the world! What could our forefathers have been thinking of?\"\n\nA few elephants, collected from African zo\u00f6logical gardens, and some\ngiraffes, also attracted a great deal of attention, but the horses were\nthe favorites with the crowd.\n\nCosmo might have had lions and tigers, and similar beasts, which had\nbeen preserved, in larger numbers than the useful horse, but when Joseph\nSmith suggested their inclusion he shook his head, declaring that it was\nbetter that they should perish. As far as possible, he averred, he would\neliminate all carnivores.\n\nIn some respects, even more interesting to the onlookers than the\nanimals of the past, were the animals of the future that marched in the\nprocession. Few of them had ever been seen outside the experimental\nstations where they had been undergoing the process of artificial\nevolution.\n\nThere were the stately white Californian cattle, without horns, but of\ngigantic stature, the cows, it was said, being capable of producing\ntwenty times more milk than their ancestral species, and of a vastly\nsuperior quality.\n\nThere were the Australian rabbits, as large as Newfoundland dogs, though\nshort-legged, and furnishing food of the most exquisite flavor; and the\nArgentine sheep, great balls of snowy wool, moving smartly along on legs\nthree feet in length.\n\nThe greatest astonishment was excited by the \"grand astoria terrapin,\" a\ndeveloped species of diamond-back tortoise, whose exquisitely sculptured\nconvex back, lurching awkwardly as it crawled, rose almost three feet\nabove the ground; and the \"new century turkey,\" which carried its beacon\nhead and staring eyes as high as a tall man's hat.\n\nThe end of the procession was formed of animals familiar to everybody,\nand among them were cages of monkeys (concerning whose educational\ndevelopment Cosmo Vers\u00e1l had theories of his own) and a large variety of\nbirds, together with boxes of insect eggs and chrysalids.\n\nThe delight of the boys who had chased after the procession culminated\nwhen the animals began to ascend the sloping ways into the ark.\n\nThe horses shied and danced, making the metallic flooring resound like a\nrattle of thunder; the elephants trumpeted; the sheep baaed and crowded\nthemselves into inextricable masses against the guard-rails; the huge\nnew cattle moved lumberingly up the slope, turning their big white heads\ninquiringly about; the tall turkeys stretched their red coral necks and\ngobbled with Brobdingnagian voices; and the great terrapins were\nignominiously attached to cables and drawn up the side of the ark,\nhelplessly waving their immense flappers in the air.\n\nAnd when the sensational entry was finished, the satisfied crowd turned\naway, laughing, joking, chattering, with never a thought that it was\nanything more than the most amusing exhibition they had ever seen!\n\nBut when they got back in the city streets they met a flying squadron of\nyelling newsboys, and seizing the papers from their hands read, in big\nblack letters:\n\n  \"AWFUL FLOOD IN THE MISSISSIPPI!\n\n  \"Thousands of People Drowned!\n\n  \"THE STORM COMING THIS WAY!\"\n\nIt was a startling commentary on the recent scene at the ark, and many\nturned pale as they read.\n\nBut the storm did not come in the way expected. The deluging rains\nappeared to be confined to the Middle West and the Northwest, while at\nNew York the sky simply grew thicker and seemed to squeeze out moisture\nin the form of watery dust. This condition lasted for some time, and\nthen came what everybody, even the most skeptical, had been secretly\ndreading.\n\nThe ocean began to rise!\n\nThe first perception of this startling fact, according to a newspaper\naccount, came in a very strange, roundabout way to a man living on the\noutskirts of the vast area of made ground where the great city had\nspread over what was formerly the Newark meadows and Newark Bay.\n\nAbout three o'clock in the morning, this man, who it appears was a\npoliceman off duty, was awakened by scurrying sounds in the house. He\nstruck a light, and seeing dark forms issuing from the cellar, went down\nto investigate. The ominous gleam of water, reflecting the light of his\nlamp, told him that the cellar was inundated almost to the top of the\nwalls.\n\n\"Come down here, Annie!\" he shouted to his wife. \"Sure 'tis Cosmo Vers\u00e1l\nis invadin' the cellar with his flood. The rats are lavin' us.\"\n\nSeeing that the slight foundation walls were crumbling, he hurried his\nfamily into the street, and not too soon, for within ten minutes the\nhouse was in ruins.\n\nNeighbors, living in equally frail structures, were awakened, and soon\nother undermined houses fell. Terror spread through the quarter, and\ngradually half the city was aroused.\n\nWhen day broke, residents along the water-front in Manhattan found their\ncellars flooded, and South and West Streets swimming with water, which\nwas continually rising. It was noted that the hour was that of\nflood-tide, but nobody had ever heard of a tide so high as this.\n\nAlarm deepened into terror when the time for the tide to ebb arrived and\nthere was no ebbing. On the contrary, the water continued to rise. The\ngovernment observer at the Highlands telephoned that Sandy Hook was\nsubmerged. Soon it was known that Coney Island, Rockaway, and all the\nseaside places along the south shore of Long Island were under water.\nThe mighty current poured in through the Narrows with the velocity of a\nmill-race. The Hudson, set backward on its course, rushed northward with\na raging bore at its head that swelled higher until it licked the feet\nof the rock chimneys of the Palisades.\n\nBut when the terror inspired by this sudden invasion from the sea was at\nits height there came unexpected relief. The water began to fall more\nrapidly than it had risen. It rushed out through the Narrows faster than\nit had rushed in, and ships, dragged from their anchorage in the upper\nharbor, were carried out seaward, some being stranded on the sandbanks\nand shoals in the lower bay.\n\nNow again houses standing on made ground, whose foundations had been\nundermined, fell with a crash, and many were buried in the ruins.\n\nNotwithstanding the immense damage and loss of life, the recession of\nthe waters immediately had a reassuring effect, and the public, in\ngeneral, was disposed to be comforted by the explanation of the weather\nofficials, who declared that what had occurred was nothing more than an\nunprecedentedly high tide, probably resulting from some unforeseen\ndisturbance out at sea.\n\nThe phenomenon had been noted all along the Atlantic coast. The chief\nforecaster ventured the assertion that a volcanic eruption had occurred\nsomewhere on the line from Halifax to Bermuda. He thought that the\nprobable location of the upheaval had been at Munn's Reef, about halfway\nbetween those points, and the more he discussed his theory the readier\nhe became to stake his reputation on its correctness, for, he said, it\nwas impossible that any combination of the effects of high and low\npressures could have created such a surge of the ocean, while a volcanic\nwave, combining with the regular oscillation of the tide, could have\ndone it easily.\n\nBut Cosmo Vers\u00e1l smiled at this explanation, and said in reply:\n\n\"The whole Arctic ice-cap is dissolved, and the condensation of the\nnebula is at hand. But there is worse behind. When the wave comes back\nit will rise higher.\"\n\nAs the time for the next flood-tide grew near, anxious eyes were on the\nwatch to see how high the water would go. There was something in the\nmere manner of its approach that made the nerves tingle.\n\nIt speeded toward the beaches, combing into rollers at an unwonted\ndistance from shore; plunged with savage violence upon the sands of the\nshallows, as if it would annihilate them; and then, spreading swiftly,\nran with terrific speed up the strand, seeming to devour everything it\ntouched. After each recoil it sprang higher and roared louder and grew\nblacker with the mud that it had ground up from the bottom. Miles inland\nthe ground trembled with the fast-repeated shocks.\n\nAgain the Hudson was hurled backward until a huge bore of water burst\nover the wharves at Albany. Every foot of ground in New York less than\ntwenty feet above the mean high tide level was inundated. The\ndestruction was enormous, incalculable. Ocean liners moored along the\nwharves were, in some cases, lifted above the level of the neighboring\nstreets, and sent crashing into the buildings along the water-front.\n\nEtherograms told, in broken sentences, of similar experiences on the\nwestern coasts of Europe, and from the Pacific came the news of the\nflooding of San Francisco, Los Angeles, Portland, Tacoma, Seattle, and,\nin fact, every coast-lying town. On the western coast of South America\nthe incoming waves broke among the foothills of the Andes.\n\nIt was as if the mighty basins of the world's two greatest oceans were\nbeing rocked to and fro, sending the waters spinning from side to side.\n\nAnd to add to the horror of the situation, every volcano on the globe\nseemed to burst simultaneously into activity, probably through the\neffects of the invasion of sea water into the subterranean fire, while\nthe strain of the unwonted weight thrown upon the coasts broke open the\ntectonic lines of weakness in the earth's crust, causing the most\nterrible earthquakes, which destroyed much that the water could not\nreach.\n\nFrom Alaska to Patagonia, from Kamchatka through Japan to the East\nIndies, from Mount Hecla to Vesuvius, Etna, and Teneriffe, the raging\noceans were bordered with pouring clouds of volcanic smoke, hurled\nupward in swift succeeding puffs, as if every crater had become the\nstack of a stupendous steam-engine driven at its maddest speed; while\nimmense rivers of lava flamed down the mountain flanks and plunged into\nthe invading waters with reverberated roarings, hissings, and explosions\nthat seemed to shake the framework of the globe.\n\nDuring the second awful shoreward heave of the Atlantic a scene occurred\noff New York Bay that made the stoutest nerves quiver. A great crowd had\ncollected on the Highlands of the Navesink to watch the ingress of the\ntidal wave.\n\nSuddenly, afar off, the smoke of an approaching ocean liner was seen. It\nneeded but a glance to show that she was struggling with tremendous\nsurges. Sometimes she sank completely out of sight; then she reappeared,\nriding high on the waves. Those who had glasses recognized her. Word ran\nfrom mouth to mouth that it was the great _Atlantis_, the mightiest\nof the ocean monarchs, of a hundred thousand tons register, coming from\nEurope, and bearing, without question, many thousands of souls.\n\nShe was flying signals of distress, and filling the ether with her\ninarticulate calls for help, which quavered into every radiograph\nstation within a radius of hundreds of miles.\n\nBut, at the same time, she was battling nobly for herself and for the\nlives of her passengers and crew. From her main peak the Stars and\nStripes streamed in the tearing wind. There were many in the watching\nthrongs who personally knew her commander, Captain Basil Brown, and who\nfelt that if any human being could bring the laboring ship through\nsafely, he could. Aid from land was not to be thought of for a moment.\n\nAs she swiftly drew nearer, hurled onward by the resistless surges with\nthe speed of an express train, the captain was recognized on his bridge,\nbalancing himself amid the lurches of the vessel; and even at that\ndistance, and in those terrible circumstances, there was something in\nhis bearing perceptible to those who breathlessly watched him, through\npowerful glasses, which spoke of perfect self-command, entire absence of\nfear, and iron determination to save his ship or die with her under his\nfeet.\n\nIt could be seen that he was issuing orders and watching their\nexecution, but precisely what their nature was, of course, could only be\nguessed. His sole hope must be to keep the vessel from being cast\nashore. There was no danger from the shoals, for they were by this time\ndeeply covered by the swelling of the sea.\n\nSlowly, slowly, with a terrific straining of mechanic energies, which\npressed the jaws of the watchers together with spasmodic sympathy, as if\ntheir own nervous power were cooperating in the struggle, the gallant\nship bore her head round to face the driving waves. From the ten huge,\nred stacks columns of inky black smoke poured out as the stokers crammed\nthe furnaces beneath. It was man against nature, human nerve and\nmechanical science against blind force.\n\nIt began to look as if the _Atlantis_ would win the battle. She was\nnow fearfully close to the shore, but her bow had been turned into the\nvery eye of the sea, and one could almost feel the tension of her steel\nmuscles as she seemed to spring to the encounter. The billows that split\nthemselves in quick succession on her sharp stem burst into shooting\ngeysers three hundred feet high.\n\nThe hearts of the spectators almost ceased to beat. Their souls were\nwrapped up with the fate of the brave ship. They forgot the terrors of\ntheir own situation, the peril of the coming flood, and saw nothing but\nthe agonized struggle before their eyes. With all their inward strength\nthey prayed against the ocean.\n\nSuch a contest could not last long. Suddenly, as the _Atlantis_\nswerved a little aside, a surge that towered above her loftiest deck\nrushed upon her. She was lifted like a cockleshell upon its crest, her\nhuge hull spun around, and the next minute, with a crash that resounded\nabove the roar of the maddened sea, she was dashed in pieces.\n\nAt the very last moment before the vessel disappeared in the whirling\nbreakers, to be strewed in broken and twisted bits of battered metal\nupon the pounding sands, Captain Basil Brown was seen on the commander's\nbridge.\n\nNo sooner had this tragedy passed than the pent-up terror broke forth,\nand men ran for their lives, ran for their homes, ran to _do\nsomething_--something, but what?--to save themselves and their dear\nones.\n\nFor now, at last, they _believed!_\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nSTORMING THE ARK\n\n\nThere was to be no more respite now. The time of warnings was past. The\n\"signs\" had all been shown to a skeptical and vacillating world, and at\nlast the fulfillment was at hand.\n\nThere was no crying of \"extras\" in the streets, for men had something\nmore pressing to think of than sending and reading news about their\ndistresses and those of their fellow-men. Many of the newspapers ceased\npublication; every business place was abandoned; there was no thought\nbut of the means of escape.\n\nBut how should they escape? And whither should they fly?\n\nThe lower lying streets were under water. The Atlantic still surged back\nand forth as if the ocean itself were in agony. And every time the waves\npoured in they rose higher. The new shores of the bay, and the new\ncoasts of Long Island and New Jersey, receding inward hour by hour, were\nstrewn with the wrecks of hundreds of vessel of all kinds which had been\ncaught by the surges and pitilessly hurled to destruction.\n\nEven if men did not yet fully believe in Cosmo Vers\u00e1l's theory of a\nwhelming nebula, they were terrified to the bottom of their souls by the\nconviction, which nobody could resist, that the vast ice-fields of the\nnorth, the glaciers of Greenland, the icy mountains of Alaska, had\nmelted away under the terrible downpour of heat, and were swelling the\noceans over their brims. And then a greater fear dropped like a blanket\nupon them. Some one thought of the _antarctic ice._\n\nThe latest dispatches that had come, before the cessation of all\ncommunication to the newspapers, had told of the prevalence of stifling\nheat throughout the southern hemisphere, and of the vast fleets of\nantarctic icebergs that filled the south seas. The mighty deposits of\nice, towering to mountain heights, that stretched a thousand miles in\nevery direction around the south pole were melting as the arctic ice had\nmelted, and, when the water thus formed was added to the already\noverflowing seas, to what elevation might not the flood attain!\n\nThe antarctic ice was known to be the principal mass of frozen water on\nthe globe. The frigid cap of the north was nothing in comparison with\nit. It had long been believed that that tremendous accumulation\nunbalanced the globe and was the principal cause of the unsteadiness of\nthe earth's axis of rotation.\n\nEvery fresh exploration had only served to magnify the conception of the\nincredible vastness of that deposit. The skirts of the Antarctic\nContinent had proved to be rich in minerals wherever the rocks could\nfind a place to penetrate through the gigantic burden of ice, and the\nprincipal nations had quarreled over the possession or control of these\nprotruding bits of wealth-crammed strata. But behind the bordering\ncliffs of ice, rising in places a thousand feet above the level of the\nsea, and towering farther inland so high that this region was, in mean\nelevation, the loftiest on the planet, nothing but ice could be seen.\n\nAnd now that ice was dissolving and flowing into the swollen oceans,\nadding billions of tons of water every minute!\n\nMen did not stop to calculate, as Cosmo Vers\u00e1l had done, just how much\nthe dissolution of all the ice and permanent snow of the globe would add\nto the volume of the seas. He knew that it would be but a drop in the\nbucket--although sufficient to start the flood--and that the great thing\nto be feared was the condensation of the aqueous nebula, already\nbeginning to enwrap the planet in its stifling folds.\n\nThe public could understand the melting ice, although it could not fully\nunderstand the nebula; it could understand the swelling sea, and the\nraging rivers, and the lakes breaking over their banks--and the terror\nand despair became universal.\n\nBut what should they _do?_\n\nThose who had thought of building arks hurried to see if the work might\nnot yet be completed, but most of them had begun their foundations on\nlow land, which was already submerged.\n\nThen a cry arose, terrible in its significance and in its\nconsequences--one of those cries that the vanished but unconquerable god\nPan occasionally sets ringing, nobody can tell how:\n\n\"Cosmo's ark! Get aboard! Storm it!\"\n\nAnd thereupon there was a mighty rush for Mineola. Nobody who caught the\ninfection stopped to reason. Some of them had to wade through water,\nwhich in places was knee-deep. They came from various directions, and\nunited in a yelling mob. They meant to carry the ark with a rush. They\nwould not be denied. As the excited throngs neared the great vessel they\nsaw its huge form rising like a mount of safety, with an American flag\nflapping over it, and they broke into a mighty cheer. On they sped,\nseized with the unreason of a crowd, shouting, falling over one another,\nstruggling, fighting for places, men dragging their wives and children\nthrough the awful crush, many trampled helpless under the myriads of\nstruggling feet--driving the last traces of sanity from one another's\nminds.\n\nThe foremost ranks presently spied Cosmo Vers\u00e1l, watching them from an\nopen gangway sixty feet above their heads. They were dismayed at finding\nthe approaches gone. How should they get into the ark? How could they\nclimb up its vertical sides?\n\nBut they would find means. They would re-erect the approaches. They\nwould _get in somehow_.\n\nCosmo waved them off with frantic gesticulations; then, through a\ntrumpet, he shouted in a voice audible above the din:\n\n\"Keep back, for your lives!\"\n\nBut they paid no attention to him; they rushed upon the raised wall,\nsurrounding the field where Cosmo had buried his mysterious lines of\nwire. Then the meaning of that enigmatical work was flashed upon them.\n\nAs the first to arrive laid their hands upon the top of the low wall\nthey fell as if shot through the brain, tumbling backward on those\nbehind. Others pushed wildly on, but the instant they touched the wall\nthey too collapsed. Wicked blue-green sparks occasionally flashed above\nthe struggling mass.\n\nThe explanation was clear. Cosmo, foreseeing the probability of a\ndespairing attack, had surrounded the ark with an impassable electric\nbarrier. The sound of a whirring dynamo could be heard. A tremendous\ncurrent was flowing through the hidden wires and transmitting its\nparalyzing energy to the metallic crest of the wall.\n\nStill those behind pushed on, until rank after rank had sunk helpless at\nthe impregnable line of defense. They were not killed--at least, not\nmany--but the shock was so paralyzing that those who had experienced its\neffects made no further attempts to cross the barrier. Many lay for a\ntime helpless upon the sodden ground.\n\nCosmo and Joseph Smith, who had now appeared at his side, continued to\nshout warnings, which began to be heeded when the nature of the obstacle\nbecame known. The rush was stopped, and the multitude stood at bay,\ndazed, and uncertain what to do. Then a murmur arose, growing louder and\nmore angry and threatening, until suddenly a shot was heard in the midst\nof the crowd, and Cosmo was seen to start backward, while Joseph Smith\ninstantly dodged out of sight.\n\nA cry arose:\n\n\"Shoot him! That's right! Shoot the devil! He's a witch! He's drowning\nthe world!\"\n\nThey meant it--at least, half of them did. It was the logic of terror.\n\nHundreds of shots were now fired from all quarters, and heads that had\nbeen seen flitting behind the various portholes instantly disappeared.\nThe bullets rattled on the huge sides of the ark, but they came from\nsmall pistols and had not force enough to penetrate.\n\nCosmo Vers\u00e1l alone remained in sight. Occasionally a quick motion showed\nthat even his nerves were not steady enough to defy the whistling of the\nbullets passing close; but he held his ground, and stretched out his\nhand to implore attention.\n\nWhen the fusillade ceased for a moment he put his trumpet again to his\nlips and shouted:\n\n\"I have done my best to save you, but you would not listen. Although I\nknow that you must perish, I would not myself harm a hair of your heads.\nGo back, I implore you. You may prolong your lives if you will fly to\nthe highlands and the mountains--but here you cannot enter. _The ark\nis full._\"\n\nAnother volley of shots was the only answer. One broad-shouldered man\nforced his way to the front, took his stand close to the wall, and\nyelled in stentorian tones:\n\n\"Cosmo Vers\u00e1l, listen to me! You are the curse of the world! You have\nbrought this flood upon us with your damnable incantations. Your\ninfernal nebula is the seal of Satan! Here, beast and devil, here at my\nfeet, lies my only son, slain by your hellish device. By the Eternal I\nswear you shall go back to the pit!\"\n\nInstantly a pistol flashed in the speaker's hand, and five shots rang in\nquick succession. One after another they whistled by Cosmo's head and\nflattened themselves upon the metal-work behind. Cosmo Vers\u00e1l,\nuntouched, folded his arms and looked straight at his foe. The man,\nstaring a moment confusedly, as if he could not comprehend his failure,\nthrew up his arms with a despairing gesture, and fell prone upon the\nground.\n\nThen yells and shots once more broke out. Cosmo stepped back, and a\ngreat metallic door swung to, closing the gangway.\n\nBut three minutes later the door opened, and the mob saw two\nmachine-guns trained upon them.\n\nOnce more Cosmo appeared, with the trumpet.\n\n\"If you fire again,\" he cried, \"I shall sweep you with grapeshot. I have\ntold you how you can prolong your lives. Now go!\"\n\nNot another shot was fired. In the face of the guns, whose terrible\npower all comprehended, no one dared to make a hostile movement.\n\nBut, perhaps, if Cosmo Vers\u00e1l had not set new thoughts running in the\nminds of the assailants by telling them there was temporary safety to be\nfound by seeking high ground, even the terror of the guns would not have\ndaunted them. Now their hopefulness was reawakened, and many began to\nponder upon his words.\n\n\"He says we must perish, and yet that we can find safety in the hills\nand mountains,\" said one man. \"I believe half of that is a lie. We are\nnot going to be drowned. The water won't rise much higher. The flood\nfrom the south pole that they talk about must be here by this time, and\nthen what's left to come?\"\n\n\"The nebula,\" suggested one.\n\n\"Aw, the nebula be hanged! There's no such thing! I live on high ground;\nI'm going to keep a sharp outlook, and if the water begins to shut off\nManhattan I'll take my family up the Hudson to the Highlands. I guess\nold Storm King'll keep his head above. That's where I come from--up that\nway. I used to hear people say when I was a boy that New York was bound\nto sink some day. I used to laugh at that then, but it looks mighty like\nit now, don't it?\"\n\n\"Say,\" put in another, \"what did the fellow mean by saying the ark was\n_full_? That's funny, ain't it? Who's he got inside, anyway?\"\n\n\"Oh, he ain't got nobody,\" said another.\n\n\"Yes, he has. I seen a goodish lot through the portholes. He's got\nsomebody, sure.\"\n\n\"A lot of fools like himself, most likely.\"\n\n\"Well, if he's a fool, and they's fools, what are _we_, I'd like to\nknow? What did you come here for, hey?\"\n\nIt was a puzzling question, and brought forth only a sheepish laugh,\nfollowed by the remark:\n\n\"I guess we fooled ourselves considerable. We got scared too easy.\"\n\n\"Maybe you'll feel scared again when you see the water climbing up the\nstreets in New York. I don't half like this thing. I'm going to follow\nhis advice and light out for higher ground.\"\n\nSoon conversation of this sort was heard on all sides, and the crowd\nbegan to disperse, only those lingering behind who had friends or\nrelatives that had been struck down at the fatal wall. It turned out\nthat not more than one or two had been mortally shocked. The rest were\nable to limp away, and many had fully recovered within five minutes\nafter suffering the shock. In half an hour not a dozen persons were in\nsight from the ark.\n\nBut when the retreating throngs drew near the shores of the Sound, and\nthe East River, which had expanded into a true arm of the sea, and found\nthat there had been a perceptible rise since they set out to capture the\nark, they began to shake their heads and fear once more entered their\nhearts.\n\nThousands then and there resolved that they would not lose another\ninstant in setting out for high land, up the Hudson, in Connecticut,\namong the hills of New Jersey. In fact, many had already fled thither,\nsome escaping on aeros; and hosts would now have followed but for a\nmarvelous change that came just before nightfall and prevented them.\n\nFor some days the heavens had alternately darkened and lightened, as\ngushes of mist came and went, but there had been no actual rain. Now,\nwithout warning, a steady downpour began. Even at the beginning it would\nhave been called, in ordinary times, a veritable cloudburst; but it\nrapidly grew worse and worse, until there was no word in the vernacular\nor in the terminology of science to describe it.\n\nIt seemed, in truth, that \"all the fountains of the great deep were\nbroken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.\" The water thundered\nupon the roofs, and poured off them in torrents. In five minutes every\nsloping street had become an angry river, and every level place a\nswelling lake. People caught out of doors were almost beaten to the\nground by the force of the water falling upon them as if they had been\nstanding under a cataract.\n\nIn a short time every cellar and every basement was filled to\noverflowing, and in the avenues the flood, lapping every instant higher\nupon the doorsteps and the walls, rushed by with frightful roarings,\nbearing in its awful embrace pieces of furniture, clothing, bedding,\nwashed out of ground-floor rooms--and, alas! human beings; some\nmotionless, already mercifully deprived of life, but others struggling\nand shouting for aid which could not be given.\n\nSo terrible a spectacle no one had ever looked upon, no one had ever\nimagined. Those who beheld it were too stunned to cry out, too\noverwhelmed with terror and horror to utter a word. They stood, or fell\ninto chairs or upon the floor, trembling in every limb, with staring\neyes and drooping jaws, passively awaiting their fate.\n\nAs night came on there was no light. The awful darkness of the _third\nsign_ once more settled upon the great city, but now it was not the\nterror of indefinite expectation that crushed down the souls of men and\nwomen--it was the weight of doom accomplished!\n\nThere was no longer any room for self-deception; every quaking heart\nfelt now that the nebula had come. _Cosmo Vers\u00e1l had been right!_\n\nAfter the water had attained a certain height in the streets and yards,\ndepending upon the ratio between the amount descending from the sky and\nthat which could find its way to the rivers, the flood for the time\nbeing rose no higher. The actual drowning of New York could not happen\nuntil the Hudson and the East River should become so swollen that the\nwater would stand above the level of the highest buildings, and turn the\nwhole region round about, as far as the Orange hills, the Ramapo\nMountains, the Highlands, and the Housatonic hills, into an inland sea.\n\nBut before we tell that story we must return to see what was going on at\nMineola. Cosmo Vers\u00e1l, on that awful night when New York first knew\nbeyond the shadow of a doubt, or the gleam of a hope, that it was\ndoomed, presided over a remarkable assembly in the grand saloon of his\nark.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nTHE COMPANY OF THE REPRIEVED\n\n\nHow did it happen that Cosmo Vers\u00e1l was able to inform the mob when it\nassailed the ark that he had no room left?\n\nWho composed his ship's company, whence had they come, and how had they\nmanaged to embark without the knowledge of the public?\n\nThe explanation is quite simple. It was all due to the tremendous\nexcitement that had prevailed ever since the seas began to overflow. In\nthe universal confusion people had to think of other things nearer their\ndoors than the operations of Cosmo Vers\u00e1l. Since the embarkation of the\nanimals the crowds had ceased to visit the field at Mineola, and it was\nonly occasionally that even a reporter was sent there. Accordingly,\nthere were many hours every day when no curiosity-seekers were in sight\nof the ark, and at night the neighborhood was deserted; and this state\nof affairs continued until the sudden panic which led to the attack that\nhas been described.\n\nCosmo Vers\u00e1l, of course, had every reason to conceal the fact that he\nwas carefully selecting his company. It was a dangerous game to play,\nand he knew it. The consequence was that he enjoined secrecy upon his\ninvited guests, and conducted them, a few at a time, into the ark,\nassuring them that their lives might be in peril if they were\nrecognized. And once under the domain of the fear which led them to\naccept his invitation, they were no less anxious than he to avoid\npublicity. Some of them probably desired to avoid recognition through\ndread of ridicule; for, after all, the flood might not turn out to be so\nbad as Cosmo had predicted.\n\nSo it happened that the ark was filled, little by little, and the public\nknew nothing about it.\n\nAnd who composed the throng which, while the awful downpour roared on\nthe ellipsoidal cover of the ark, and shook it to its center and while\nNew York, a few miles away, saw story after story buried under the\nwaters, crowded Cosmo's brilliantly lighted saloon, and raised their\nvoices to a high pitch in order to be heard?\n\nHad all the invitations which he dictated to Joseph Smith after their\nmemorable discussion, and which were sent forth in the utmost haste,\nflying to every point of the compass, been accepted, and was it the\nfamous leaders of science, the rulers and crowned heads who had passed\nhis critical inspection that were now knocking elbows under the great\ndome of levium? Had kings and queens stolen incognito under the shelter\nof the ark, and magnates of the financial world hidden themselves there?\n\nIt would have been well for them all if they had been there. But, in\nfact, many of those to whom the invitations had gone did not even take\nthe trouble to thank their would-be savior. A few, however, who did not\ncome in person, sent responses. Among these was the President of the\nUnited States. Mr. Samson's letter was brief but characteristic. It\nread:\n\nTo COSMO VERS\u00c1L, ESQ.\n\nSir:\n\nThe President directs me to say that he is grateful for your invitation,\nand regrets that he cannot accept it. He is informed by those to whose\nofficial advice he feels bound to listen, that the recent extraordinary\nevents possess no such significance as you attach to them.\n\nRespectfully, FOR THE PRESIDENT,\n\nJAMES JENKS, Secretary.\n\nIt must be remembered that this letter was written before the oceanic\noverflow began. After that, possibly, the President and his advisers\nchanged their opinion. But then communication by rail was cut off, and\nas soon as the downpour from the sky commenced the aero express lines\nwere abandoned. The airships would have been deluged, and blown to\ndestruction by the tremendous gusts which, at intervals, packed the\nrain-choked air itself into solid billows of water.\n\nNone of the rulers of the old world responded, but about half the men of\nscience, and representatives of the other classes that Cosmo had set\ndown on his list, were wise enough to accept, and they hurried to New\nYork before the means of transit by land and sea were destroyed.\n\nAmong these were Englishmen, Frenchmen, Italians, Spaniards, Germans,\nAustrians, Poles, people from the Balkan states, Swedes, Danes,\nRussians, and a few from India, China, and Japan. The clatter of their\nvarious tongues made a very Babel inside the ark, when they talked to\none another in groups, but nearly all of them were able to speak\nEnglish, which, after many years of experiment, had been adopted as the\ncommon language for transacting the world's affairs.\n\nThere was another letter, which Cosmo read with real regret, although\nhardly with surprise. It was from Professor Pludder. Instead of\nexpressing gratitude for the invitation, as the President, trained in\npolitical blandiloquence, had done, Professor Pludder indulged in\ndenunciation.\n\n\"You are insane,\" he said. \"You do not know what you are talking about.\nYour letter is an insult to science. These inundations\" (this, too, was\nwritten before the sky had opened its flood-gates) \"are perfectly\nexplicable by the ordinary laws of nature. Your talk of a nebula is so\nridiculous that it deserves no reply. If any lunatic accepts your absurd\ninvitation, and goes into your 'ark,' he will find himself in Bedlam,\nwhere he ought to be.\"\n\n\"I guess you were right,\" Cosmo remarked to Joseph Smith, after reading\nthis outburst. \"Pludder would not contribute to the regeneration of\nmankind. We are better off without him.\"\n\nBut Cosmo Vers\u00e1l was mistaken in thinking he had heard the last of Abiel\nPludder. The latter was destined to show that he was hardly a less\nremarkable specimen of _homo sapiens_ than the big-headed prophet\nof the second deluge himself.\n\nAs soon as it became evident that there would be room to spare in the\nark, Cosmo set at work to fill up the list. He went over his categories\nonce more, but now, owing to the pressure of time, he was obliged to\nconfine his selections to persons within easy reach. They came, nearly\nall, from New York, or its vicinity; and since these last invitations\nwent out just on the eve of the events described in the last two\nchapters, there was no delay in the acceptances, and the invitees\npromptly presented themselves in person.\n\nCosmo's warning to them of the necessity of secrecy was superfluous, for\nthe selfishness of human nature never had a better illustration than\nthey afforded. The lucky recipients of the invitations stole away\nwithout a word of farewell, circumspectly disappearing, generally at\nnight, and often in disguise; and when the attack occurred on the ark,\nthere were, behind the portholes, many anxious eyes cautiously staring\nout and recognizing familiar faces in the mob, while the owners of those\neyes trembled in their shoes lest their friends might succeed in forcing\nan entrance. After all, it was to be doubted if Cosmo Vers\u00e1l, with all\nhis vigilance, had succeeded in collecting a company representing\nanything above the average quality of the race.\n\nBut there was one thing that did great credit to his heart. When he\nfound that he had room unoccupied, before adding to his lists he\nconsented to take more than two children in a family. It was an immense\nrelief, for--it must be recorded--there were some who, in order to\nqualify themselves, had actually abandoned members of their own\nfamilies! Let it also be said, however, that many, when they found that\nthe conditions imposed were inexorable, and that they could only save\nthemselves by leaving behind others as dear to them as their own lives,\nindignantly refused, and most of these did not even reply to the\ninvitations.\n\nIt was another indication of Cosmo's real humanity, as well as of his\nshrewdness, that, as far as they were known, and could be reached, the\npersons who had thus remained true to the best instincts of nature were\nthe first to receive a second invitation, with an injunction to bring\ntheir entire families. So it happened that, after all, there were aged\nmen and women, as well as children in arms, mingled in that remarkable\nassemblage.\n\nIt will be recalled that thirteen places had been specially reserved, to\nbe filled by Cosmo Vers\u00e1l's personal friends. His choice of these\nrevealed another pleasing side of his mind. He took thirteen men and\nwomen who had been, in one capacity or another, employed for many years\nin his service. Some of them were old family servants that had been in\nhis father's house.\n\n\"Every one of these persons,\" he said to Joseph Smith, \"is worth his\nweight in gold. Their disinterested fidelity to duty is a type of\ncharacter that almost became extinct generations ago, and no more\nvaluable leaven could be introduced into the society of the future.\nRather than leave them, I would stay behind myself.\"\n\nFinally there was the crew. This comprised one hundred and fifty\nmembers, all of them chosen from the body of engineers, mechanics, and\nworkmen who had been employed in the construction of the ark. Cosmo\nhimself was, of course, the commander, but he had for his lieutenants\nskilled mariners, electrical and mechanical engineers, and men whom he\nhimself had instructed in the peculiar duties that would fall to them in\nthe navigation and management of the ark, every detail of which he had\nlaboriously worked out with a foresight that seemed all but superhuman.\n\nAll of the passengers and crew were aboard when the baffled mob\nretreated from Mineola, and some, when that danger was past, wished to\ndescend to the ground, and go and look at the rising waters, which had\nnot yet invaded the neighborhood. But Cosmo absolutely forbade any\ndepartures from the ark. The condensation of the nebula, he declared,\nwas likely to begin any minute, and the downpour would be so fierce that\na person might be drowned in the open field.\n\nIt came even sooner than he had anticipated, with the results that we\nhave already noted in New York. At first many thought that the ark\nitself would be destroyed, so dreadful was the impact of the falling\nwater. The women and children, and some of the men, were seized with\npanic, and Cosmo had great difficulty in reassuring them.\n\n\"The flood will not reach us for several hours yet,\" he said. \"The level\nof the water must rise at least a hundred feet more before we shall be\nafloat. Inside here we are perfectly safe. The ark is exceedingly strong\nand absolutely tight. You have nothing to fear.\"\n\nThen he ordered an ingenious sound-absorbing screen, which he had\nprepared, to be drawn over the great ceiling of the saloon, the effect\nof which was to shut out the awful noise of the water roaring upon the\nroof of the ark. A silence that was at first startling by contrast to\nthe preceding din prevailed as soon as the screen was in place.\n\nAmid a hush of expectancy, Cosmo now mounted a dais at one end of the\nroom. Never before had the intellectual superiority of the man seemed so\nevident. His huge \"dome of thought,\" surmounting his slight body,\ndominated the assembly like the front of Jove. Chairs near him were\noccupied by Professor Jeremiah Moses, Professor Abel Able, Professor\nAlexander Jones, and the two \"speculative geniuses\" whom he had named to\nJoseph Smith. These were Costak\u00e9 Theriade, of Rumania, a tall, dark,\nhigh-browed thinker, who was engaged in devising ways to extract and\nrecover interatomic energy; and Sir Wilfred Athelstone, whose specialty\nwas bio-chemistry, and who was said to have produced amazing results in\nartificial parthenogenesis and the production of new species.\n\nAs soon as attention was concentrated upon him, Cosmo Vers\u00e1l began to\nspeak.\n\n\"My friends,\" he said, \"the world around us is now sinking beneath a\nflood that will not be arrested until America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and\nAustralia have disappeared. We stand at the opening of a new age. You\nalone who are here assembled, and your descendants, will constitute the\npopulation of the new world that is to be.\n\n\"In this ark, which owes its existence to the foreseeing eye of science,\nyou will be borne in safety upon the bosom of the battling waters, and\nwe will disembark upon the first promising land that reappears, and\nbegin the plantation and development of a new society of men and women,\nwhich, I trust, will afford a practical demonstration of the principles\nof eugenics.\n\n\"I have, as far as possible, and as far as the pitiful blindness of\nmankind permitted me to go, selected and assembled here representatives\nof the best tendencies of humanity. You are a chosen remnant, and the\nfuture of this planet depends upon you.\n\n\"I have been fortunate in securing the companionship of men of science\nwho will be able to lead and direct. The ark is fully provisioned for a\nperiod which must exceed the probable duration of the flood. I have\ntaken pains not to overcrowd it, and every preparation has been made for\nany contingencies which may arise.\n\n\"It is inexpressibly sad to part thus with the millions of our\nfellow-beings who would not heed the warnings that were lavished upon\nthem; but, while our hearts may be rent with the thought, it is our duty\nto cast off the burden of vain regrets and concentrate all our energies\nupon the great work before us.\n\n\"I salute,\" he continued, raising his voice and lifting a glass of wine\nfrom the little table before him, \"the world of the past--may its faults\nbe forgotten--and the world of the future--may it rise on the wings of\nscience to nobler prospects!\"\n\nHe poured out the wine like a libation; and as his voice ceased to echo,\nand he sank into his seat, an uncontrollable wave of emotion ran over\nthe assembly. Many of the women wept, and the men conversed in whispers.\nAfter a considerable interval, during which no one spoke above his\nbreath, Professor Able Abel arose and said:\n\n\"The gratitude which we owe to this man\"--indicating Cosmo Vers\u00e1l--\"can\nbest be expressed, not in words, but by acts. He has led us thus far; he\nmust continue to lead us to the end. We were blind, while he was full of\nlight. It will become us hereafter to heed well whatever he may say. I\nnow wish to ask if he can foresee where upon the re-emerging planet a\nfoothold is first likely to be obtained. Where lies our land of\npromise?\"\n\n\"I can answer that question,\" Cosmo replied, \"only in general terms. You\nare all aware that the vast table-land of Tibet is the loftiest region\nupon the globe. In its western part it lies from fourteen to seventeen\nor eighteen thousand feet above the ordinary level of the sea. Above it\nrise the greatest mountain peaks in existence. Here the first\nconsiderable area is likely to be uncovered. It is upon the Pamirs, the\n'Roof of the World,' that we shall probably make our landing.\"\n\n\"May I ask,\" said Professor Abel Able, \"in what manner you expect the\nwaters of the flood to be withdrawn, after the earth is completely\ndrowned?\"\n\n\"That,\" was the reply, \"was one of the fundamental questions that I\nexamined, but I do not care to enter into a discussion of it now. I may\nsimply say that it is not only upon the disappearance of the waters that\nour hopes depend, but upon circumstances that I shall endeavor to make\nclear hereafter. The new cradle of mankind will be located near the old\none, and the roses of the Vale of Cashmere will canopy it.\"\n\nCosmo Vers\u00e1l's words made a profound impression upon his hearers, and\nawoke thoughts that carried their minds off into strange reveries. No\nmore questions were asked, and gradually the assemblage broke up into\ngroups of interested talkers.\n\nIt was now near midnight. Cosmo, beckoning Professor Abel Able,\nProfessor Alexander Jones, and Professor Jeremiah Moses to accompany\nhim, made his way out of the saloon, and, secretly opening one of the\ngangway doors, they presently stood, sheltering themselves from the\npouring rain, in a position which enabled them to look toward New York.\n\nNothing, of course, was visible through the downpour; but they were\nstartled at hearing fearful cries issuing out of the darkness. The rural\nparts of the city, filled with gardens and villas, lay round within a\nquarter of a mile of the ark, and the sound, accelerated by the\nwater-charged atmosphere, struck upon their ears with terrible\ndistinctness. Sometimes, when a gust of wind blew the rain into their\nfaces, the sound deepened into a long, despairing wail, which seemed to\nbe borne from afar off, mingled with the roar of the descending\ntorrent--the death-cry of the vast metropolis!\n\n\"Merciful Heaven, I cannot endure this!\" cried Professor Moses.\n\n\"Go to my cabin,\" Cosmo yelled in his ear, \"and take the others with\nyou. I will join you there in a little while. I wish to measure the rate\nof rise of the water.\"\n\nThey gladly left him, and fled into the interior of the ark. Cosmo\nprocured an electric lamp; and the moment its light streamed out he\nperceived that the water had already submerged the great cradle in which\nthe ark rested, and was beginning to creep up the metallic sides. He\nlowered a graduated tape into it, provided with an automatic register.\nIn a few minutes he had completed his task, and then he went to rejoin\nhis late companions in his cabin.\n\n\"In about an hour,\" he said to them, \"we shall be afloat. The water is\nrising at the rate of one-thirtieth of an inch per second.\"\n\n\"No more than that?\" asked Professor Jones with an accent of surprise.\n\n\"That is quite enough,\" Cosmo replied. \"One-thirtieth of an inch per\nsecond means two inches in a minute, and ten feet in an hour. In\ntwenty-four hours from now the water will stand two hundred and forty\nfeet above its present level, and then only the tallest structures in\nNew York will lift their tops above it, if, indeed, they are not long\nbefore overturned by undermining or the force of the waves.\"\n\n\"But it will be a long time before the hills and highlands are\nsubmerged,\" suggested Professor Jones. \"Are you perfectly sure that the\nflood will cover them?\"\n\nCosmo Vers\u00e1l looked at his interlocutor, and slowly shook his head.\n\n\"It is truly a disappointment to me,\" he said at length, \"to find that,\neven now, remnants of doubt cling to your minds. I tell you that the\nnebula is condensing at its maximum rate. It is likely to continue to do\nso for at least four months. In four months, at the rate of two inches\nper minute, the level of the water will rise 28,800 feet. There is only\none peak in the world which is surely known to attain a slightly greater\nheight than that--Mount Everest, in the Himalayas. Even in a single\nmonth the rise will amount to 7,200 feet. That is 511 feet higher than\nthe loftiest mountain in the Appalachians. In one month, then, there\nwill be nothing visible of North America east of the Rockies. And in\nanother month they will have gone under.\"\n\nNot another word was said. The three professors sat, wide-eyed and\nopen-mouthed, staring at Cosmo Vers\u00e1l, whose bald head was crowned with\nan aureole by the electric light that beamed from the ceiling, while,\nwith a gold pocket pencil, he fell to figuring upon a sheet of paper.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nTHE LAST DAY OF NEW YORK\n\n\nWhile Cosmo Vers\u00e1l was calculating, from the measured rise of the water,\nthe rate of condensation of the nebula, and finding that it added\ntwenty-nine trillion two hundred and ninety billion tons to the weight\nof the earth every minute--a computation that seemed to give him great\nmental satisfaction--the metropolis of the world, whose nucleus was the\nisland of Manhattan, and every other town and city on the globe that\nlay near the ordinary level of the sea, was swiftly sinking beneath the\nswelling flood.\n\nEverywhere, over all the broad surface of the planet, a wail of despair\narose from the perishing millions, beaten down by the water that poured\nfrom the unpitying sky. Even on the highlands the situation was little\nbetter than in the valleys. The hills seemed to have been turned into the\ncrests of cataracts from which torrents of water rushed down on all sides,\nstripping the soil from the rocks, and sending the stones and bowlders\nroaring and leaping into the lowlands and the gorges. Farmhouses, barns,\nvillas, trees, animals, human beings--all were swept away together.\n\nOnly on broad elevated plateaus, where higher points rose above the general\nlevel, were a few of the inhabitants able to find a kind of refuge. By\nseeking these high places, and sheltering themselves as best they could\namong immovable rocks, they succeeded, at least, in delaying their fate.\nNotwithstanding the fact that the atmosphere was filled with falling water,\nthey could yet breathe, if they kept the rain from striking directly in\ntheir faces. It was owing to this circumstance, and to some extraordinary\noccurrences which we shall have to relate, that the fate of the human race\nwas not precisely that which Cosmo Vers\u00e1l had predicted.\n\nWe quitted the scene in New York when the shadow of night had just fallen,\nand turned the gloom of the watery atmosphere into impenetrable darkness.\nThe events of that dreadful night we shall not attempt to depict. When the\nhours of daylight returned, and the sun should have brightened over the\ndoomed city, only a faint, phosphorescent luminosity filled the sky. It\nwas just sufficient to render objects dimly visible. If the enclosing\nnebula had remained in a cloud-like state it would have cut off all light,\nbut having condensed into raindrops, which streamed down in parallel lines,\nexcept when sudden blasts of wind swept them into a confused mass, the\nsunlight was able to penetrate through the interstices, aided by the\ntransparency of the water, and so a slight but variable illumination was\nproduced.\n\nIn this unearthly light many tall structures of the metropolis, which had\nas yet escaped the effects of undermining by the rushing torrents in the\nstreets, towered dimly toward the sky, shedding streams of water from every\ncornice. Most of the buildings of only six or eight stories had already\nbeen submerged, with the exception of those that stood on the high grounds\nin the upper part of the island, and about Spuyten Duyvil.\n\nIn the towers and upper stories of the lofty buildings still standing in\nthe heart of the city, crowds of unfortunates assembled, gazing with\nhorror at the spectacles around them, and wringing their hands in helpless\ndespair. When the light brightened they could see below them the angry\nwater, creeping every instant closer to their places of refuge, beaten\ninto foam by the terrible downpour, and sometimes, moved by a mysterious\nimpulse, rising in sweeping waves which threatened to carry everything\nbefore them.\n\nEvery few minutes one of the great structures would sway, crack, crumble,\nand go down into the seething flood, the cries of the lost souls being\nswallowed up in the thunder of the fall. And when this occurred within\nsight of neighboring towers yet intact, men and women could be seen, some\nwith children in their arms, madly throwing themselves from windows and\nledges, seeking quick death now that hope was no more!\n\nStrange and terrible scenes were enacted in the neighborhood of what had\nbeen the water-fronts. Most of the vessels moored there had been virtually\nwrecked by the earlier invasion of the sea. Some had been driven upon the\nshore, others had careened and been swamped at their wharves. But a few had\nsucceeded in cutting loose in time to get fairly afloat. Some tried to go\nout to sea, but were wrecked by running against obstacles, or by being\nswept over the Jersey flats. Some met their end by crashing into the\nsubmerged pedestal of the Statue of Liberty. Others steered up the course\nof the Hudson River, but that had become a narrow sea, filled with floating\nand tossing debris of every sort, and all landmarks being invisible, the\nluckless navigators lost their way, and perished, either through collisions\nwith other vessels, or by driving upon a rocky shore.\n\nThe fate of the gigantic building containing the offices of the municipal\ngovernment, which stood near the ancient City Hall, and which had been the\nculminating achievement of the famous epoch of \"sky-scrapers,\" was a thing\nso singular, and at the same time dramatic, that in a narrative dealing\nwith less extraordinary events than we are obliged to record it would\nappear altogether incredible.\n\nWith its twoscore lofty stories, and its massive base, this wonderful\nstructure rose above the lower quarter of the city, and dominated it, like\na veritable Tower of Babel, made to defy the flood. Many thousands of\npeople evidently regarded it in that very light, and they had fled from all\nquarters, as soon as the great downpour began, to find refuge within its\nmountainous flanks. There were men--clerks, merchants, brokers from the\ndowntown offices--and women and children from neighboring tenements.\n\nBy good chance, but a few weeks before, this building had been fitted with\na newly invented system of lighting, by which each story was supplied with\nelectricity from a small dynamo of its own, and so it happened that now the\nlamps within were all aglow, lightening the people's hearts a little with\ntheir cheering radiance.\n\nUp and up they climbed, the water ever following at their heels, from floor\nto floor, until ten of the great stages were submerged. But there were more\nthan twice as many stages yet above, and they counted them with unexpiring\nhope, telling one another, with the assurance of desperation, that long\nbefore the flood could attain so stupendous an altitude the rain would\nsurely cease, and the danger, as far as they were concerned, would pass\naway.\n\n\"See! See!\" cries one. \"It is stopping! It is coming no higher! I've been\nwatching that step, and the water has stopped! It hasn't risen for ten\nminutes!\"\n\n\"Hurrah! Hurrah!\" yells the crowd behind and above. And the glad cry is\ntaken up and reverberated from story to story until it bursts wildly out\ninto the rain-choked air at the very summit.\n\n\"Hurrah! Hurrah! We are saved! The flood has stopped!\"\n\nMen madly embrace each other. Women burst into tears and hug their children\nto their breasts, filled with a joy and thankfulness that can find no\nexpression in words.\n\n\"You are wrong,\" says another man, crouching beside him who first spoke.\n\"It has not stopped--it is still rising.\"\n\n\"_What_! I tell you it _has_ stopped,\" snaps the other. \"Look at that step!\nIt stopped right below it.\"\n\n\"_You've been watching the wrong step_. It's rising!\"\n\n\"You fool! Shut your mouth! I say it has _stopped_.\"\n\n\"No, it has not.\"\n\n\"It has! It has!\"\n\n\"Look at _that_ step, then! See the water just now coming over it.\"\n\nThe obstinate optimist stares a moment, turns pale, and then, with an oath,\nstrikes his more clear-headed neighbor in the face! And the excited crowd\nbehind, with the blind instinctive feeling that, somehow, he has robbed\nthem of the hope which was but now as the breath of life to them, strike\nhim and curse him, too.\n\nBut he had seen only too clearly.\n\nWith the steady march of fate--two inches a minute, as Cosmo Vers\u00e1l had\naccurately measured it--the water still advances and climbs upward.\n\nIn a little while they were driven to another story, and then to another.\nBut hope would not down. They could not believe that the glad news, which\nhad so recently filled them with joy, was altogether false. The water\n_must_ have stopped rising _once_; it had been _seen_. Then, it would\nsurely stop _again_, stop to rise no more.\n\nPoor deluded creatures! With the love of life so strong within them, they\ncould not picture, in their affrighted minds, the terrible consummation to\nwhich they were being slowly driven, when, jammed into the narrow chambers\nat the very top of the mighty structure, their remorseless enemy would\nseize them at last.\n\nBut they were nearer the end than they could have imagined even if they had\naccepted and coolly reasoned upon the facts that were so plain before them.\nAnd, after all, it was not to come upon them only after they had fought\ntheir way to the highest loft and into the last corner.\n\nA link of this strange chain of fatal events now carries us to the spot\nwhere the United States Navy Yard in Brooklyn once existed. That place was\nsunk deep beneath the waters. All of the cruisers, battleships, and other\nvessels that had been at anchor or at moorings there had gone under. One\nonly, the boast of the American navy, the unconquerable _Uncle Sam_, which,\nin the last great war that the world had known, had borne the starry flag\nto victories whose names broke men's voices and filled their eyes with\ntears of pride, had escaped, through the incomparable seamanship of Captain\nRobert Decatur, who had been her commander for thirty years.\n\nBut though the _Uncle Sam_ managed to float upon the rising flood, she\nwas unable to get away because of the obstructions lodged about the great\nbridges that spanned the East River. A curious eddy that the raging\ncurrents formed over what was once the widest part of that stream kept\nher revolving round and round, never departing far in any direction,\nand, with majestic strength, riding down or brushing aside the floating\ntimbers, wooden houses, and other wreckage that pounded furiously against\nher mighty steel sides.\n\nJust at the time when the waters had mounted to the eighteenth story of the\nbeleaguered Municipal Building, a sudden change occurred in these currents.\nThey swept westward with resistless force, and the _Uncle Sam_ was\ncarried directly over the drowned city. First she encountered the cables of\nthe Manhattan Bridge, striking them near the western tower, and, swinging\nround, wrenched the tower itself from its foundations and hurled it beneath\nthe waters.\n\nThen she rushed on, riding with the turbid flood high above the buried\nroofs, finding no other obstruction in her way until she approached the\nMunicipal Building, which was stoutly resisting the push of the waves.\n\n\n[Illustration: \"THE GREAT BATTLESHIP... CRASHED, PROW ON, INTO THE\nSTEEL-RIBBED WALLS\"]\n\n\nThose who were near the windows and on the balconies, on the eastern side\nof the building, saw the great battleship coming out of the gray gloom\nlike some diluvian monster, and before they could comprehend what it was,\nit crashed, prow on, into the steel-ribbed walls, driving them in as if\nthey had been the armored sides of an enemy.\n\nSo tremendous was the momentum of the striking mass that the huge vessel\npassed, like a projectile, through walls and floors and partitions. But as\nshe emerged in the central court the whole vast structure came thundering\ndown upon her, and ship and building together sank beneath the boiling\nwaves.\n\nBut out of the awful tangle of steel girders, that whipped the air and the\nwater as if some terrible spidery life yet clung to them, by one of those\nmiracles of chance which defy all the laws of probability and reason, a\nsmall boat of levium, that had belonged to the _Uncle Sam_, was cast forth,\nand floated away, half submerged but unsinkable; and clinging to its\nthwarts, struggling for breath, insane with terror, were two men, the sole\nsurvivors of all those thousands.\n\nOne of them was a seaman who had taken refuge, with a crowd of comrades,\nin the boat before the battleship rushed down upon the building. All of\nhis comrades had been hurled out and lost when the blow came, while his\npresent companion was swept in and lodged against the thwarts. And so\nthose two waifs drove off in the raging waves. Both of them were bleeding\nfrom many wounds, but they had no fatal hurts.\n\nThe boat, though filled with water, was so light that it could not sink.\nMoreover, it was ballasted, and amid all its wild gyrations it kept right\nside up. Even the ceaseless downpour from the sky could not drive it\nbeneath the waves.\n\nAfter a while the currents that had been setting westward changed their\ndirection, and the boat was driven toward the north. It swept on past\ntoppling skyscrapers until it was over the place where Madison Square once\nspread its lawns, looked down upon by gigantic structures, most of which\nhad now either crumbled and disappeared or were swaying to their fall. Here\nthere was an eddy, and the boat turned round and round amid floating debris\nuntil two other draggled creatures, who had been clinging to floating\nobjects, succeeded by desperate efforts in pulling themselves into it.\nOthers tried but failed, and no one lent a helping hand. Those who were\nalready in the boat neither opposed nor aided the efforts of those who\nbattled to enter it. No words were heard in the fearful uproar--only\ninarticulate cries.\n\nSuddenly the current changed again, and the boat, with its dazed occupants,\nwas hurried off in the direction of the Hudson. Night was now beginning\nonce more to drop an obscuring curtain over the scene, and under that\ncurtain the last throes of drowning New York were hidden. When the sun\nagain faintly illuminated the western hemisphere the whole Atlantic\nseaboard was buried under the sea.\n\nAs the water rose higher, Cosmo Vers\u00e1l's Ark at last left its cradle, and\ncumbrously floated off, moving first eastward, then turning in the\ndirection of Brooklyn and Manhattan. Cosmo had his engines in operation,\nbut their full power was not developed as soon as he had expected, and\nthe great vessel drifted at the will of the currents and the wind, the\nlatter coming now from one side and now from another, rising at times to\nhurricane strength and then dying away until only a spanking breeze swept\nthe ever-falling rain into swishing sheets. Occasionally the wind failed\nentirely, and for many minutes at a time the water fell in vertical\nstreams.\n\nAt length the motive power of the Ark was developed, and it began to obey\nits helm. From the shelter of a \"captain's bridge,\" constructed at the\nforward end of the huge levium dome that covered the vessel, Cosmo Vers\u00e1l,\nwith Captain Arms, a liberally bewhiskered, veteran navigator in whose\nskill he confided, peered over the interminable waste of waters. There was\nnothing in sight except floating objects that had welled up from the\ndrowned city and the surrounding villages. Here and there the body of an\nanimal or a human being was seen in the tossing waves, and Cosmo Vers\u00e1l\nsadly shook his head as he pointed them out, but the stout mariner at his\nside chewed his tobacco, and paid attention only to his duties, shouting\norders from time to time through a speaking-tube, or touching an electric\nbutton.\n\nCosmo Vers\u00e1l brought a rain-gage and again and again allowed it to fill\nitself. The story was always the same--two inches per minute, ten feet per\nhour, the water mounted.\n\nThe nebula had settled down to regular work, and, if Cosmo's calculations\nwere sound, there would be no intermission for four months.\n\nAfter the power of the propellers had been developed the Ark was steered\nsoutheastward. Its progress was very slow. In the course of eight hours\nit had not gone more than fifty miles. The night came on, and the speed\nwas reduced until there was only sufficient way to insure the command of\nthe vessel's movements. Powerful searchlights were employed as long as\nthe stygian darkness continued.\n\nWith the return of the pallid light, at what should have been daybreak,\nCosmo and his navigator were again at their post. In fact, the former\nhad not slept at all, keeping watch through the long hours, with\nCaptain Arms within easy call.\n\nAs the light became stronger, Cosmo said to the captain:\n\n\"Steer toward New York. I wish to see if the last of the tall buildings on\nthe upper heights have gone under.\"\n\n\"It will be very dangerous to go that way,\" objected Captain Arms. \"There\nare no landmarks, and we may strike a snag.\"\n\n\"Not if we are careful,\" replied Cosmo. \"All but the highest ground is now\nburied very deep.\"\n\n\"It is taking a fool's risk,\" growled Captain Arms, through his brush, but\nnevertheless he obeyed.\n\nIt was true that they had nothing to go by. The air was too thick with\nwater, and the light too feeble for them to be able to lay their course\nby sighting the distant hills of New Jersey which yet remained above the\nlevel of the flood. Still, by a kind of seaman's instinct, Captain Arms\nmade his way, until he felt that he ought to venture no farther. He had\njust turned to Cosmo Vers\u00e1l with the intention of voicing his protest\nwhen the Ark careened slightly, shivered from stem to stern, and then\nbegan a bumping movement that nearly threw the two men from their feet.\n\n\"We are aground!\" cried the captain, and instantly turned a knob that set\nin motion automatic machinery which cut off the engines from the\npropellers, and at the same time slowed down the engines themselves.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\"A BILLION FOR A SHARE\"\n\n\nThe Ark had lodged on the loftiest part of the Palisades. It was only after\nlong and careful study of their position, rendered possible by occasional\nglimpses of the Orange Hills and high points further up the course of the\nHudson, that Cosmo Vers\u00e1l and Captain Arms were able to reach that\nconclusion. Where New York had stood nothing was visible but an expanse of\nturbid and rushing water.\n\nBut suppose the hard trap rocks had penetrated the bottom of the Ark! It\nwas a contingency too terrible to be thought of. Yet the facts must be\nascertained at once.\n\nCosmo, calling Joseph Smith, and commanding him to go among the frightened\npassengers and assure them, in his name, that there was no danger, hurried,\nwith the captain and a few trusty men, into the bowels of the vessel. They\nthoroughly sounded the bottom plates. No aperture and no indentation was\nto be found.\n\nBut, then, the bottom was double, and the outer plates might have been\nperforated. If this had happened the fact would reveal itself through the\nleakage of water into the intervening space. To ascertain if that had\noccurred it was necessary to unscrew the covers of some of the manholes in\nthe inner skin of levium.\n\nIt was an anxious moment when they cautiously removed one of these covers.\nAt the last turns of the screw the workman who handled it instinctively\nturned his head aside, and made ready for a spring, more than half\nexpecting that the cover would be driven from his hands, and a stream of\nwater would burst in.\n\nBut the cover remained in place after it was completely loosened, and until\nit had been lifted off. A sigh of relief broke from every breast. No water\nwas visible.\n\n\"Climb in there, and explore the bottom,\" Cosmo commanded.\n\nThere was a space of eighteen inches between the two bottoms, which were\nconnected and braced by the curved ribs of the hull. A man immediately\ndisappeared in the opening and began the exploration. Cosmo ordered the\nremoval of other covers at various points, and the exploration was extended\nover the whole bottom. He himself passed through one of the manholes and\naided in the work.\n\nAt last it was determined, beyond any doubt, that even the outer skin was\nuninjured. Not so much as a dent could be found in it.\n\n\"By the favor of Providence,\" said Cosmo Vers\u00e1l, as his great head emerged\nfrom a manhole, \"the Ark has touched upon a place where the rocks are\ncovered with soil, and no harm has come to us. In a very short time the\nrising water will lift us off.\"\n\n\"And, with my consent, you'll do no more navigating over hills and\nmountains,\" grumbled Captain Arms. \"The open sea for the sailor.\"\n\nThe covers were carefully replaced, and the party, in happier spirits,\nreturned to the upper decks, where the good news was quickly spread.\n\nThe fact was that while the inspection was under way the Ark had floated\noff, and when Cosmo and the captain reached their bridge the man who had\nbeen left in charge reported that the vessel had swung halfway round.\n\n\"She's headed for the old Atlantic,\" sung out Captain Arms. \"The sooner\nwe're off the better.\"\n\nBut before the captain could signal the order to go ahead, Cosmo Vers\u00e1l\nlaid his hand on his arm and said:\n\n\"Wait a moment; listen.\"\n\nThrough the lashing of the rain a voice penetrated with a sound between a\ncall and a scream. There could be no doubt that it was human. The captain\nand Cosmo looked at one another in speechless astonishment. The idea that\nany one outside the Ark could have survived, and could now be afloat amid\nthis turmoil of waters, had not occurred to their minds. They experienced\na creeping of the nerves. In a few minutes the voice came again, louder\nthan before, and the words that it pronounced being now clearly audible,\nthe two listeners could not believe their ears.\n\n\"Cosmo Vers\u00e1l!\" it yelled. \"Cosmo-o-o Ver-s\u00e1-al! A billion for a share! A\n_billion_, I say, a _bil-li-on_ for a share!\"\n\nThen they perceived a little way off to the left something which looked\nlike the outline of a boat, sunk to the gunwales, washed over by every\nwave; and standing in it, up to their waists in water, were four men, one\nof whom was gesticulating violently, while the others seemed dazed and\nincapable of voluntary movement.\n\nIt was the boat of levium that had been thrown out of the wreckage when the\nbattleship ran down the Municipal tower, and we must now follow the thread\nof its adventures up to the time of its encounter with the Ark.\n\nAs the boat was driven westward from the drowned site of Madison Square it\ngradually freed itself from the objects floating around, most of which soon\nsunk, and in an hour or two its inmates were alone--the sole survivors of a\ndense population of many millions.\n\nAlone they were in impenetrable darkness, for, as we have said, night had\nby this time once more fallen.\n\nThey floated on, half drowned, chilled to the bone, not trying to speak,\nnot really conscious of one another's presence. The rain beat down upon\nthem, the waves washed over them, the unsinkable boat sluggishly rose and\nfell with the heaving of the water, and occasionally they were nearly flung\noverboard by a sudden lurch--and yet they clung with desperate tenacity to\nthe thwarts, as if life were still dear, as if they thought that they might\nyet survive, though the world was drowned.\n\nThus hours passed, and at last a glimmer appeared in the streaming air, and\na faint light stole over the face of the water. If they saw one another,\nit was with unrecognizing eyes. They were devoured with hunger, but they\ndid not know it.\n\nSuddenly one of them--it was he who had been so miraculously thrown into\nthe boat when it shot out of the tangle of falling beams and walls--raised\nhis head and threw up his arms, a wild light gleaming in his eyes.\n\nIn a hoarse, screaming voice he yelled:\n\n\"Cosmo Vers\u00e1l!\"\n\nNo other syllables that the tongue could shape would have produced the\neffect of that name. It roused the three men who heard it from their\nlethargy of despair, and thrilled them to the marrow. With amazed eyes they\nstared at their companion. He did not look at them, but gazed off into the\nthick rain. Again his voice rose in a maniacal shriek:\n\n\"Cosmo Vers\u00e1l! Do you hear me? Let me in! A billion for a share!\"\n\nThe men looked at each other, and, even in their desperate situation, felt\na stir of pity in their hearts. They were not too dazed to comprehend that\ntheir companion had gone mad. One of them moved to his side, and laid a\nhand upon his shoulder, as if he would try to soothe him.\n\nBut the maniac threw him off, nearly precipitating him over the side of\nthe submerged boat, crying:\n\n\"What are _you_ doing in my boat? Overboard with you! I am looking for\nCosmo Vers\u00e1l! He's got the biggest thing afloat! Securities! Securities!\nGilt-edged! A _billion_, I tell you! Here I have them--look! Gilt-edged,\nevery one!\" and he snatched a thick bundle of papers from his pocket and\nwaved them wildly until they melted into a pulpy mass with the downpour.\n\nThe others now shrank away from him in fear. Fear? Yes, for still they\nloved their lives, and the staggering support beneath their feet had become\nas precious to them as the solid earth. They would have fought with the\nfury of madmen to retain their places in that half-swamped shell. They were\nstill capable of experiencing a keener fear than that of the flood. They\nwere as terrified by the presence of this maniac as they would have been\non encountering him in their homes.\n\nBut he did not attempt to follow them. He still looked off through the\ndriving rain, balancing himself to the sluggish lurching of the boat, and\ncontinuing to rave, and shout, and shake his soaked bundle of papers,\nuntil, exhausted by his efforts, and half-choked by the water that drove in\nhis face, he sank helpless upon a thwart.\n\nThen they fell back into their lethargy, but in a little while he was on\nhis feet again, gesticulating and raging--and thus hours passed on, and\nstill they were afloat, and still clinging to life.\n\nSuddenly, looming out of the strange gloom, they perceived the huge form of\nthe Ark, and all struggled to their feet, but none could find voice but the\nmaniac.\n\nAs soon as he saw the men, Cosmo Vers\u00e1l had run down to the lowest deck,\nand ordered the opening of a gangway on that side. When the door swung\nback he found himself within a few yards of the swamped boat, but ten feet\nabove its level. Joseph Smith, Professor Moses, Professor Jones, Professor\nAble, and others of the passengers, and several of the crew, hurried to his\nside, while the rest of the passengers crowded as near as they could get.\n\nThe instant that Cosmo appeared the maniac redoubled his cries.\n\n\"Here they are,\" he yelled, shaking what remained of his papers. \"A\nbillion--all gilt-edged! Let me in. But shut out the others. They're\nonly little fellows. They've got no means. They can't float an enterprise\nlike this. Ah, you're a bright one! You and me, Cosmo Vers\u00e1l--we'll\nsqueeze 'em all out. I'll give you the secrets. We'll own the earth! I'm\n_Amos Blank!_\"\n\nCosmo Vers\u00e1l recognized the man in spite of the dreadful change that had\ncome over him. His face was white and drawn, his eyes staring, his head\nbare, his hair matted with water, his clothing in shreds--but it was\nunmistakably Amos Blank, a man whose features the newspapers had rendered\nfamiliar to millions, a man who had for years stood before the public as\nthe unabashed representative of the system of remorseless repression of\ncompetition, and shameless corruption of justice and legislation. After the\nworld, for nearly two generations, had enjoyed the blessings of the reforms\nin business methods and social ideals that had been inaugurated by the\ngreat uprising of the people in the first quarter of the twentieth\ncentury, Amos Blank, and lesser men of his ilk, had swung back the\npendulum, and re-established more firmly than ever the reign of monopoly\nand iniquitous privilege.\n\nThe water-logged little craft floated nearer until it almost touched the\nside of the Ark directly below the gangway. The madman's eyes glowed with\neagerness, and he reached up his papers, continually yelling his refrain:\n\"A billion! Gilt-edged! Let me in! Don't give the rabble a show!\"\n\nCosmo made no reply, but gazed down upon the man and his bedraggled\ncompanions with impassive features, but thoughtful eyes. Any one who knew\nhim intimately, as Joseph Smith alone did, could have read his mind. He was\nasking himself what he ought to do. Here was the whole fundamental question\nto be gone over again. To what purpose had he taken so great pains to\nselect the flower of mankind? Here was the head and chief of the offense\nthat he had striven to eliminate appealing to him to be saved under\ncircumstances which went straight to the heart and awoke every sentiment of\nhumanity.\n\nPresently he said in as low a voice as could be made audible:\n\n\"Joseph, advise me. What should I do?\"\n\n\"You were willing to take Professor Pludder,\" replied Smith evasively, but\nwith a plain leaning to the side of mercy.\n\n\"You know very well that that was different,\" Cosmo returned irritably.\n\"Pludder was not morally rotten. He was only mistaken. He had the\nfundamental scientific quality, and I'm sorry he threw himself away in\nhis obstinacy. But this man--\"\n\n\"Since he is _alone_,\" broke in Joseph Smith with a sudden illumination,\n\"he could do no harm.\"\n\nCosmo Vers\u00e1l's expression instantly brightened.\n\n\"You are right!\" he exclaimed. \"By himself he can do nothing. I am sure\nthere is no one aboard who would sympathize with his ideas. Alone, he is\ninnocuous. Besides, he's insane, and I can't leave him to drown in that\ncondition. And I must take the others, too. Let down a landing stage,\" he\ncontinued in a louder voice, addressing some members of the crew.\n\nIn a few minutes all four of the unfortunates, seeming more dead than live,\nwere helped into the Ark.\n\nAmos Blank immediately precipitated himself upon Cosmo Vers\u00e1l, and, seizing\nhim by the arm, tried to lead him apart, saying in his ear, as he glared\nround upon the faces of the throng which crowded every available space.\n\n\"Hist! Overboard with 'em! What's all this trash? Shovel 'em out!\nThey'll want to get in with us; they'll queer the game!\"\n\nThen he turned furiously upon the persons nearest him, and began to push\nthem toward the open gangway. At a signal from Cosmo Vers\u00e1l, two men\nseized him and pinioned his arms. At that his mood changed, and,\nwrenching himself loose, he once more ran to Cosmo, waving his bedraggled\nbundle, and shouting:\n\n\"A billion! Here's the certificates--gilt-edge! But,\" he continued, with\na cunning leer, and suddenly thrusting the sodden papers into his pocket,\n\"you'll make out the receipts first. I'll put in _five_ billions to make\nit a sure go, if you won't let in another soul.\"\n\nCosmo shook off the man's grasp, and again calling the two members of the\ncrew who had before pinioned his arms, told them to lead him away, at the\nsame time saying to him:\n\n\"You go with these men into my room. I'll see you later.\"\n\nBlank took it in the best part, and willingly accompanied his conductors,\nonly stopping a moment to wink over his shoulder at Cosmo, and then he\nwas led through the crowd, which regarded him with unconcealed\nastonishment, and in many cases with no small degree of fear. As soon as\nhe was beyond earshot, Cosmo directed Joseph Smith to hurry ahead of the\nparty and conduct them to a particular apartment, which he designated at\nthe same time, saying to Smith:\n\n\"Turn the key on him as soon as he's inside.\"\n\nAmos Blank, now an insane prisoner in Cosmo Vers\u00e1l's Ark, had been the\ngreatest financial power in the world's metropolis, a man of iron nerve and\nthe clearest of brains, who always kept his head and never uttered a\nfoolish word. It was he who had stood over the flight of steps in the\nMunicipal Building, coolly measuring with his eye the rise of the water,\nexposing the terrible error that sent such a wave of unreasoning joy\nthrough the hearts of the thousands of refugees crowded into the doomed\nedifice, and receiving blows and curses for making the truth known.\n\nHe had himself taken refuge there, after visiting his office and filling\nhis pockets with his most precious papers. How, by a marvelous stroke of\nfate, he became one of the four persons who alone escaped from New York\nafter the downpour began is already known.\n\n\nThe other men taken from the boat were treated like rescued mariners\nsnatched from a wreck at sea. Every attention was lavished upon them, and\nCosmo Vers\u00e1l did not appear to regret, as far as they were concerned, that\nhis ship's company had been so unexpectedly recruited.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nTHE SUBMERGENCE OF THE OLD WORLD\n\n\nWe now turn our attention for a time from the New World to the Old. What\ndid the thronging populations of Europe, Africa, and Asia do when the signs\nof coming disaster chased one on another's heels, when the oceans began to\nburst their bonds, and when the windows of the firmament were opened?\n\nThe picture that can be drawn must necessarily be very fragmentary,\nbecause the number who escaped was small and the records that they left\nare few.\n\nThe savants of the older nations were, in general, quite as incredulous\nand as set in their opposition to Cosmo Vers\u00e1l's extraordinary out-givings\nas those of America. They decried his science and denounced his\npredictions as the work of a fool or a madman. The president of the Royal\nAstronomical Society of Great Britain proved to the satisfaction of most\nof his colleagues that a nebula could not possibly contain enough water\nto drown an asteroid, let alone the earth.\n\n\"The nebulae,\" said this learned astronomer, amid the plaudits of his\nhearers, \"are infinitely rarer in composition than the rarest gas left\nin the receiver of an exhausted air-pump. I would undertake to swallow\nfrom a wineglass the entire substance of any nebula that could enter the\nspace between the earth and the sun, if it were condensed into the liquid\nstate.\"\n\n\"It might be intoxicating,\" called out a facetious member.\n\n\"Will the chair permit me to point out,\" said another with great gravity,\n\"that such a proceeding would be eminently rash, for the nebulous fluid\nmight be highly poisonous.\" [\"Hear! Hear!\" and laughter.]\n\n\"What do you say of this strange darkness and these storms?\" asked an\nearnest-looking man. (This meeting was held after the terrors of the\n_third sign_ had occurred.)\n\n\"I say,\" replied the president, \"that that is the affair of the\nMeteorological Society, and has nothing to do with astronomy. I dare say\nthat they can account for it.\"\n\n\"And I dare say they can't,\" cried a voice.\n\n\"Hear! Hear!\" \"Who are you?\" \"Put him out!\" \"I dare say he's right!\" \"Cosmo\nVers\u00e1l!\" Everybody was talking at once.\n\n\"Will this gentleman identify himself?\" asked the president. \"Will he\nplease explain his words?\"\n\n\"That I will,\" said a tall man with long whiskers, rising at the rear end\nof the room. \"I am pretty well known. I----\"\n\n\"It's Jameson, the astrologer,\" cried a voice. \"What's _he_ doing here?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the whiskered man, \"it's Jameson, the astrologer, and he has\ncome here to let you know that Cosmo Vers\u00e1l was born under the sign Cancer,\nthe first of the watery triplicity, and that Berosus, the Chaldean,\ndeclared----\"\n\nAn uproar immediately ensued; half the members were on their feet at once;\nthere was a scuffle in the back part of the room, and Jameson, the\nastrologer, was hustled out, shouting at the top of his voice:\n\n\"Berosus, the Chaldean, predicted that the world would be drowned when\nall the planets should assemble in the sign Cancer--_and where are they\nnow?_ Blind and stupid dolts that you are--_where are they now?\"_\n\nIt was some time before order could be restored, and a number of members\ndisappeared, having followed Jameson, the astrologer, possibly through\nsympathy, or possibly with a desire to learn more about the prediction of\nBerosus, the father of astrology.\n\nWhen those who remained, and who constituted the great majority of the\nmembership, had quieted down, the president remarked that the interruption\nwhich they had just experienced was quite in line with all the other\nproceedings of the disturbers of public tranquillity who, under the lead\nof a crazy American charlatan, were trying to deceive the ignorant\nmultitude. But they would find themselves seriously in error if they\nimagined that their absurd ideas were going to be \"taken over\" in England.\n\n\"I dare say,\" he concluded, \"that there is some _scheme_ behind it all.\"\n\n\"Another American 'trust'!\" cried a voice.\n\nThe proceedings were finally brought to an end, but not before a modest\nmember had risen in his place and timidly remarked that there was one\nquestion that he would like to put to the chair--one thing that did not\nseem to have been made quite clear--\"Where _were_ the planets now?\"\n\nA volley of hoots, mingled with a few \"hears!\" constituted the only\nreply.\n\nScenes not altogether unlike this occurred in the other great learned\nsocieties--astronomical, meteorological, and geological. The official\nrepresentatives of science were virtually unanimous in condemnation of\nCosmo Vers\u00e1l, and in persistent assertion that nothing that had occurred\nwas inexplicable by known laws. But in no instance did they make it clear\nto anybody precisely what were the laws that they invoked, or how it\nhappened that Cosmo Vers\u00e1l had been able to predict so many strange things\nwhich everybody knew really had come to pass, such as the sudden storms and\nthe great darkness.\n\nWe are still, it must not be forgotten, dealing with a time anterior to the\nrising of the sea.\n\nThe Paris Academy of Sciences voted that the subject was unworthy of\nserious investigation, and similar action was taken at Berlin, St.\nPetersburg, Vienna, and elsewhere.\n\nBut among the people at large universal alarm prevailed, and nothing was\nso eagerly read as the dispatches from New York, detailing the proceedings\nof Cosmo Vers\u00e1l, and describing the progress of his great levium ark. In\nEngland many procured copies of Cosmo's circulars, in which the proper\nmethods to be pursued in the construction of arks were carefully set forth.\nSome set to work to build such vessels; but, following British methods of\nconstruction, they doubled the weight of everything, with the result that,\nif Cosmo had seen what they were about he would have told them that such\narks would go to the bottom faster than to the top.\n\nIn Germany the balloon idea took full possession of the public mind.\nGermany had long before developed the greatest fleet of dirigible balloons\nin existence, preferring them to every other type of flying apparatus. It\nwas reported that the Kaiser was of the opinion that if worst came to worst\nthe best manner of meeting the emergency would be by the multiplication of\ndirigibles and the increase of their capacity.\n\nThe result was that a considerable number of wealthy Germans began the\nconstruction of such vessels. But when interviewed they denied that they\nwere preparing for a flood. They said that they simply wished to enlarge\nand increase the number of their pleasure craft, after the example of the\nKaiser. All this was in contemptuous defiance of the warning which Cosmo\nVers\u00e1l had been careful to insert in his circulars, that \"balloons and\naeros of all kinds will be of no use whatever; the only safety will be\nfound in arks, and they must be provisioned for at least five years.\"\n\nThe most remarkable thing of all happened in France. It might naturally\nhave been expected that a Frenchman who thought it worth his while to take\nany precautions against the extinction of the human race would, when it\nbecame a question of a flood, have turned to the aero, for from the\ncommencement of aerial navigation French engineers had maintained an\nunquestionable superiority in the construction and perfection of that kind\nof machine.\n\nTheir aeros could usually fly longer and carry more dead weight than those\nof any other nation. In the transoceanic aero races which occasionally took\nplace the French furnished the most daring and the most frequently\nsuccessful competitors.\n\nBut the French mind is masterly in appreciation of details, and Cosmo\nVers\u00e1l's reasons for condemning the aero and the balloon as means of\nescaping the flood were promptly divined. In the first place it was seen\nthat no kind of airship could be successfully provisioned for a flight of\nindefinite length, and in the second place the probable strength of the\nwinds, or the crushing weight of the descending water, in case, as Cosmo\npredicted, a nebula should condense upon the earth, would either sweep an\naero or a balloon to swift destruction, or carry it down into the waves\nlike a water-soaked butterfly.\n\nAccordingly, when a few Frenchmen began seriously to consider the\nquestion of providing a way of escape from the flood--always supposing, for\nthe sake of argument, that there would be a flood--they got together, under\nthe leadership of an engineer officer named Yves de Beauxchamps, and\ndiscussed the matter in all its aspects. They were not long in arriving at\nthe conclusion that the best and most logical thing that could possibly be\ndone would be to construct a _submarine_.\n\nIn fact, this was almost an inevitable conclusion for them, because before\nthe abandonment of submarines in war on account of their _too_ great\npowers of destruction--a circumstance which had also led to the prohibition\nof the use of explosive bombs in the aerial navies--the French had held\nthe lead in the construction and management of submersible vessels, even\nmore decisively than in the case of aeros.\n\n\"A large submarine,\" said De Beauxchamps, \"into whose construction a\ncertain amount of levium entered, would possess manifest advantages over\nVers\u00e1l's Ark. It could be provisioned to any extent desired, it would\nescape the discomforts of the waves, winds, and flooding rain, and it\ncould easily rise to the surface whenever that might be desirable for\nchange of air. It would have all the amphibious advantages of a whale.\"\n\nThe others were decidedly of De Beauxchamps's opinion, and it was\nenthusiastically resolved that a vessel of this kind should be begun at\nonce.\n\n\"If we don't need it for a flood,\" said De Beauxchamps, \"we can employ it\nfor a pleasure vessel to visit the wonders of the deep. We will then make\na reality of that marvelous dream of our countryman of old, that prince of\ndreamers, Jules Verne.\"\n\n\"Let's name it for him!\" cried one.\n\n\"Admirable! Charming!\" they all exclaimed. \"_Vive le 'Jules Verne'!_\"\n\nWithin two days, but without the knowledge of the public, the keel of the\nsubmersible _Jules Verne_ was laid. But we shall hear of that remarkable\ncraft again.\n\nWhile animated, and in some cases violent, discussions were taking place\nin the learned circles of Europe, and a few were making ready in such\nmanner as they deemed most effective for possible contingencies, waves of\npanic swept over the remainder of the Old World. There were yet hundreds\nof millions in Africa and Asia to whom the advantages of scientific\ninstruction had not extended, but who, while still more or less under the\ndominion of ignorance and superstition, were in touch with the _news_ of\nthe whole planet.\n\nThe rumor that a wise man in America had discovered that the world was\nto be drowned was not long in reaching the most remote recesses of the\nAfrican forests and of the boundless steppes of the greater continent,\nand, however it might be ridiculed or received with skeptical smiles in\nthe strongholds of civilization, it met with ready belief in less\nenlightened minds.\n\nThen, the three \"signs\"--the first great heat, the onslaught of storm and\nlightning, and the _Noche Triste_, the great darkness--had been world-wide\nin their effects, and each had heightened the terror caused by its\npredecessor. Moreover, in the less enlightened parts of the world the\nreassurances of the astronomers and others did not penetrate at all, or,\nif they did, had no effect, for not only does bad news run while good news\nwalks, but it talks faster.\n\nIt will be recalled that one of the most disquieting incidents in America,\nimmediately preceding the catastrophal rising of the oceans, was the\nmelting of the Arctic snows and ice-fields, with consequent inundations\nin the north. This stage in the progress of the coming disaster was\naccentuated in Europe by the existence of the vast glaciers of the Alps.\nThe Rocky Mountains, in their middle course, had relatively little snow and\nalmost no true glaciers, and consequently there were no scenes of this kind\nin the United States comparable with those that occurred in the heart of\nEurope.\n\nAfter the alarm caused by the great darkness in September had died out, and\nthe long spell of continuous clear skies began, the summer resorts of\nSwitzerland were crowded as they had seldom been. People were driven there\nby the heat, for one thing; and then, owing to the early melting of the\nwinter's deposit of snow, the Alps presented themselves in a new aspect.\n\nMountain-climbers found it easy to make ascents upon peaks which had always\nhitherto presented great difficulties on account of the vast snow-fields,\nseamed with dangerous crevasses, which hung upon their flanks. These were\nnow so far removed that it was practicable for amateur climbers to go where\nalways before only trained Alpinists, accompanied by the most experienced\nguides, dared to venture.\n\nBut as the autumn days ran on and new snows fell, the deep-seated glaciers\nbegan to dissolve, and masses of ice that had lain for untold centuries in\nthe mighty laps of the mountains, projecting frozen noses into the valleys,\ncame tumbling down, partly in the form of torrents of water and partly in\nroaring avalanches.\n\nThe great Aletsch glacier was turned into a river that swept down into the\nvalley of the Rh\u00f4ne, carrying everything before it. The glaciers at the\nhead of the Rh\u00f4ne added their contribution. The whole of the Bernese\nOberland seemed to have suddenly been dissolved like a huge mass of sugar\ncandy, and on the north the valley of Interlaken was inundated, while the\nlakes of Thun and Brientz were lost in an inland sea which rapidly spread\nover all the lower lands between the Alps and the Swiss Jura.\n\nFarther east the Rhine, swollen by the continual descent of the glacier\nwater, burst its banks, and broadened out until Strasburg lay under water\nwith the finger of its ancient cathedral helplessly pointing skyward out\nof the midst of the flood. All the ancient cities of the great valley from\nBasle to Mayence saw their streets inundated and the foundations of their\nmost precious architectural monuments undermined by the searching water.\n\nThe swollen river reared back at the narrow pass through the Taunus range,\nand formed a huge eddy that swirled over the old city of Bingen. Then it\ntore down between the castle-crowned heights, sweeping away the villages\non the river banks from Bingen to Coblentz, lashing the projecting rocks\nof the Lorelei, and carrying off houses, churches, and old abbeys in a\nrush of ruin.\n\nIt widened out as it approached Bonn and Cologne, but the water was still\ndeep enough to inundate those cities, and finally it spread over the plain\nof Holland, finding a score of new mouths through which to pour into the\nGerman Ocean, while the reclaimed area of the Zuyder Zee once more joined\nthe ocean, and Amsterdam and the other cities of the Netherlands were\nburied, in many cases to the tops of the house doors.\n\nWest and south the situation was the same. The Mer de Glace at Chamonix,\nand all the other glaciers of the Mont Blanc range, disappeared, sending\nfloods down to Geneva and over the Dauphiny and down into the plains of\nPiedmont and Lombardy. The ruin was tremendous and the loss of life\nincalculable. Geneva, Turin, Milan, and a hundred other cities, were\nswept by torrents.\n\nThe rapidity of this melting of the vast snow-beds and glaciers of the\nAlps was inconceivable, and the effect of the sudden denudation upon the\nmountains themselves was ghastly. Their seamed and cavernous sides stood\nforth, gaunt and naked, a revelation of Nature in her most fearful aspects\nsuch as men had never looked upon. Mont Blanc, without its blanket of snow\nand ice, towered like the blackened ruin of a fallen world, a sight that\nmade the beholders shudder.\n\nBut this flood ended as suddenly as it had begun. When the age-long\naccumulations of snow had all melted the torrents ceased to pour down from\nthe mountains, and immediately the courageous and industrious inhabitants\nof the Netherlands began to repair their broken dikes, while in Northern\nItaly and the plains of Southeastern France every effort was made to\nrepair the terrible losses.\n\nOf course similar scenes had been enacted, and on even a more fearful\nscale, in the plains of India, flooded by the melting of the enormous icy\nburden that covered the Himalayas, the \"Abode of Snow.\" And all over the\nworld, wherever icy mountains reared themselves above inhabited lands,\nthe same story of destruction and death was told.\n\nThen, after an interval, came the yet more awful invasion of the sea.\n\nBut few details can be given from lack of records. The Thames roared\nbackward on its course, and London and all central England were inundated.\nA great bore of sea-water swept along the shores of the English Channel,\nand bursting through the Skager Rack, covered the lower end of Sweden, and\nrushed up the Gulf of Finland, burying St. Petersburg, and turning all\nWestern Russia, and the plains of Pomerania into a sea. The Netherlands\ndisappeared. The Atlantic poured through the narrow pass of the Strait of\nGibraltar, leaving only the Lion Rock visible above the waves.\n\nAt length the ocean found its way into the Desert of Sahara, large\nareas of which had been reclaimed, and were inhabited by a considerable\npopulation of prosperous farmers. Nowhere did the sudden coming of the\nflood cause greater consternation than here--strange as that statement\nmay seem. The people had an undefined idea that they were protected by a\nsort of barrier from any possible inundation.\n\nIt had taken so many years and such endless labor to introduce into the\nSahara sufficient water to transform its potentially rich soil into arable\nland that the thought of any sudden superabundance of that element was far\nfrom the minds of the industrious agriculturalists. They had heard of the\ninundations caused by the melting of the mountain snows elsewhere, but\nthere were no snow-clad mountains near them to be feared.\n\nAccordingly, when a great wave of water came rushing upon them, surmounted,\nwhere it swept over yet unredeemed areas of the desert, by immense clouds\nof whirling dust, that darkened the air and recalled the old days of the\nsimoom, they were taken completely by surprise. But as the water rose\nhigher they tried valiantly to escape. They were progressive people, and\nmany of them had aeros. Besides, two or three lines of aero expresses\ncrossed their country. All who could do so immediately embarked in\nairships, some fleeing toward Europe, and others hovering about, gazing\nin despair at the spreading waters beneath them.\n\nAs the invasion of the sea grew more and more serious, this flight by\nairship became a common spectacle over all the lower-lying parts of Europe,\nand in the British Isles. But, in the midst of it, the heavens opened their\nflood-gates, as they had done in the New World, and then the aeros, flooded\nwith rain, and hurled about by contending blasts of wind, drooped,\nfluttered, and fell by hundreds into the fast mounting waves. The nebula\nwas upon them!\n\nIn the meantime those who had provided arks of one kind or another, tried\ndesperately to get them safely afloat. All the vessels that succeeded in\nleaving their wharves were packed with fugitives. Boats of every sort were\npressed into use, and the few that survived were soon floating over the\nsites of the drowned homes of their occupants.\n\nBefore it was too late Yves de Beauxchamps and his friends launched their\nsubmarine, and plunged into the bosom of the flood.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nSTRANGE FREAKS OF THE NEBULA\n\n\nWe return to follow the fortunes of Cosmo Vers\u00e1l's Ark.\n\nAfter he had so providentially picked up the crazed billionaire, Amos\nBlank, and his three companions, Cosmo ordered Captain Arms to bear away\nsoutheastward, bidding farewell to the drowned shores of America, and\nsailing directly over the lower part of Manhattan, and western Long\nIsland. The navigation was not easy, and if the Ark had not been a\nmarvelously buoyant vessel it would not long have survived. At the\nbeginning the heavy and continuous rain kept down the waves, and the\nsurface of the sea was comparatively smooth, but after a while a curious\nphenomenon began to be noticed; immense billows would suddenly appear,\nrushing upon the Ark now from one direction and now from another, canting\nit over at a dangerous angle, and washing almost to the top of the huge\nellipsoid of the dome. At such times it was difficult for anybody to\nmaintain a footing, and there was great terror among the passengers. But\nCosmo, and stout Captain Arms, remained at their post, relieving one\nanother at frequent intervals, and never entrusting the sole charge of\nthe vessel to any of their lieutenants.\n\nCosmo Vers\u00e1l himself was puzzled to account for the origin of the mighty\nbillows, for it seemed impossible that they could be raised by the wind\nnotwithstanding the fact that it blew at times with hurricane force. But\nat last the explanation came of itself.\n\nBoth Cosmo and the captain happened to be on the bridge together when they\nsaw ahead something that looked like an enormous column as black as ink,\nstanding upright on the surface of the water. A glance showed that it was\nin swift motion, and, more than that, was approaching in a direct line\ntoward the Ark. In less than two minutes it was upon them.\n\nThe instant that it met the Ark a terrific roaring deafened them, and the\nrounded front of the dome beneath their eyes disappeared under a deluge of\ndescending water so dense that the vision could not penetrate it. In\nanother half minute the great vessel seemed to have been driven to the\nbottom of the sea. But for the peculiar construction of the shelter of the\nbridge its occupants would have been drowned at their posts. As it was they\nwere soaked as if they had been plunged overboard. Impenetrable darkness\nsurrounded them.\n\nBut the buoyant vessel shook itself, rolled from side to side, and rose\nwith a staggering motion until it seemed to be poised on the summit of a\nwatery mountain. Immediately the complete darkness passed, the awful\ndownpour ceased, although the rain still fell in torrents, and the Ark\nbegan to glide downward with sickening velocity, as if it were sliding\ndown a liquid slope.\n\nIt was a considerable time before the two men, clinging to the supports of\nthe bridge, were able to maintain their equilibrium sufficiently to render\nit possible to utter a few connected words. As soon as he could speak with\nreasonable comfort Cosmo exclaimed:\n\n\"Now I see what it is that causes the billows, but it is a phenomenon that\nI should never have anticipated. It is all due to the nebula. Evidently\nthere are irregularities of some kind in its constitution which cause the\nformation of almost solid masses of water in the atmosphere--suspended\nlakes, as it were--which then plunge down in a body as if a hundred\nthousand Niagaras were pouring together from the sky.\n\n\"These sudden accessions of water raise stupendous waves which sweep off\nin every direction, and that explains the billows that we have\nencountered.\"\n\n\"Well, this nebular navigation beats all my experience,\" said Captain Arms,\nwiping the water out of his eyes. \"I was struck by a waterspout once in\nthe Indian Ocean, and I thought that that capped the climax, but it was\nonly a catspaw to this. Give me a clear offing and I don't care how much\nwind blows, but blow me if I want to get under any more lakes in the sky.\"\n\n\"We'll have to take whatever comes,\" returned Cosmo, \"but I don't think\nthere is much danger of running directly into many of these downpours as\nwe did into this one. Now that we know what they are, we can, perhaps,\ndetect them long enough in advance to steer out of their way. Anyhow,\nwe've got a good vessel under our feet. Anything but an ark of levium\nwould have gone under for good, and if I had not covered the vessel with\nthe dome there would have been no chance for a soul in her.\"\n\nAs a matter of fact, the Ark did not encounter any more of the columns of\ndescending water, but the frequent billows that were met showed that they\nwere careering over the face of the swollen sea in every direction.\n\nBut there was another trouble of a different nature. The absence of sun\nand stars deprived them of the ordinary means of discovering their place.\nThey could only make a rough guess as to the direction in which they were\ngoing. The gyrostatic compasses gave them considerable assistance, and\nthey had perfect chronometers, but these latter could be of no use without\ncelestial observations of some kind.\n\nAt length Cosmo devised a means of obtaining observations that were of\nsufficient value to partially serve their purpose. He found that while\nthe disk of the sun was completely hidden in the watery sky, yet it was\npossible to determine its location by means of the varying intensity of\nthe light.\n\nWhere the sun was a concentrated glow appeared, shading gradually off on\nall sides. With infinite pains Cosmo, assisted by the experience of the\ncaptain, succeeded in determining the center of the maximum illumination,\nand, assuming that to represent the true place of the sun, they got\nsomething in the nature of observations for altitude and azimuth, and\nCaptain Arms even drew on his chart \"Sumner lines\" to determine the\nposition of the Ark, although he smiled at the thought of their absurd\ninaccuracy. Still, it was the best they could do, and was better than\nnothing at all.\n\nThey kept a log going also, although, as the captain pointed out, it was\nnot of much use to know how fast they were traveling, since they could not\nknow the precise direction, within a whole point of the compass, or perhaps\nseveral points.\n\n\"Besides,\" he remarked, \"what do we know of the currents? This is not the\nold Atlantic. If I could feel the Gulf Stream I'd know whereabouts I was,\nbut these currents come from all directions, and a man might as well try\nto navigate in a tub of boiling water.\"\n\n\"But we can, at least, keep working eastward,\" said Cosmo. \"My idea is\nfirst to make enough southing to get into the latitude of the Sahara\nDesert, and then run directly east, so as to cross Africa where there are\nno mountains, and where we shall be certain of having plenty of water under\nour keel.\n\n\"Then, having got somewhere in the neighborhood of Suez, we can steer\ndown into the region of the Indian Ocean, and circle round south of the\nHimalayas. I want to keep an eye on those mountains, and stay around the\nplace where they disappear, because that will be the first part of the\nearth to emerge from the flood and it is there that we shall ultimately\nmake land.\"\n\n\"Well, we're averaging eight knots,\" said the captain, \"and at that rate\nwe ought to be in the longitude of the African coast in about twenty days.\nHow high will the water stand then?\"\n\n\"My gages show,\" replied Cosmo, \"that the regular fall amounts to exactly\nthe same thing as at the beginning--two inches a minute. Of course the\nspouts increase the amount locally, but I don't think that they add\nmaterially to the general rise of the flood. Two inches per minute means\n4,800 feet in twenty days. That'll be sufficient to make safe navigation\nfor us all the way across northern Africa. We'll have to be careful in\ngetting out into the Indian Ocean area, for there are mountains on both\nsides that might give us trouble, but the higher ones will still be in\nsight, and they will serve to indicate the location of the lower ranges\nalready submerged, but not covered deeply enough to afford safe going over\nthem.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Captain Arms, \"you're the commodore, but if we don't\nhang our timbers on the Mountains of the Moon, or the Alps, or old Ararat,\nI'm a porpoise. Why can't you keep circling round at a safe distance, in\nthe middle of the Atlantic, until all these reefs get a good depth of\nwater on 'em?\"\n\n\"Because,\" Cosmo replied, \"even if we keep right on now it will probably\ntake two months, allowing for delays in getting round dangerous places,\nto come within sight of the Himalayas, and in two months the flood will\nhave risen nearly 15,000 feet, thus hiding many of the landmarks. If we\nshould hold off here a couple of months before starting eastward nothing\nbut the one highest peak on the globe would be left in sight by the time\nwe arrived there, and that wouldn't be anything more than a rock, so that\nwith the uncertainty of our navigation we might not be able to find it at\nall. I must know the spot where Tibet sinks, and then manage to keep in\nits neighborhood.\"\n\nThat ended the argument.\n\n\"Give me a safe port, with lights and bearings, and I'll undertake to hit\nit anywhere in the two hemispheres, but blow me if I fancy steering for\nthe top of the world by dead reckoning, or no reckoning at all,\" grumbled\nthe captain.\n\nAt night, of course, they had not even the slight advantage that their\nobservations of the probable place of the sun gave them when it was above\nthe horizon. Then they had to go solely by the indications of the compass.\nStill, they forged steadily ahead, and when they got into what they deemed\nthe proper latitude, they ran for the site of the drowned Sahara.\n\nAfter about a week the billowing motion caused by the descent of the \"lakes\nin the sky\" ceased entirely, to their great delight, but the lawless nebula\nwas now preparing another surprise for them.\n\nOn the ninth night after their departure from their lodgment on the\nPalisades Cosmo Vers\u00e1l was sleeping in his bunk close by the bridge, where\nhe could be called in an instant, dreaming perhaps of the glories of the\nnew world that was to emerge out of the deluge, when he was abruptly\nawakened by the voice of Captain Arms, who appeared to be laboring under\nuncontrollable excitement.\n\n\"Tumble up quicker'n you ever did in your life!\" he exclaimed, his big\nbrown beard wagging almost in Cosmo's face. \"The flood's over!\"\n\nCosmo sprang out of bed and pulled on his coat in a second.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Look for yourself,\" said the captain, pointing overhead.\n\nCosmo Vers\u00e1l glanced up and saw the sky ablaze with stars! The rain had\nentirely ceased. The surface of the sea was almost as smooth as glass,\nthough rising and falling slowly, with a long, rolling motion. The Ark\nrode steadily, shivering, like an ocean liner, under the impulse of its\nengines, and the sudden silence, succeeding the ceaseless roar of the\ndownpour, which had never been out of their ears from the start of the\nvoyage, seemed supernatural.\n\n\"When did this happen?\" he demanded.\n\n\"It began not more than five minutes ago. I was just saying to myself that\nwe ought to be somewhere near the center of the old Atlantic as it used to\nbe, and wondering whether we had got our course laid right to go fairly\nbetween the Canaries and the Cape de Verdes, for I didn't want to be\nharpooned by Gogo or the Peak of Teneriffe, when all of a sudden there\ncame a lightening in the nor'east and the stars broke out there.\n\n\"I was so set aback that I didn't do anything for two or three minutes but\nstare at the stars. Then the rain stopped and a curtain seemed to roll off\nthe sky, and in a minute more it was clear down to the horizon all around.\nThen I got my wits together and ran to call you.\"\n\nCosmo glanced around and above, seeming to be as much astonished as the\ncaptain had been. He rubbed his huge bald dome and looked all round again\nbefore speaking. At last he said:\n\n\"It's the nebula again. There must be a hole in it.\"\n\n\"Its whole bottom's knocked out, I reckon,\" said the captain. \"Maybe it's\nrun out of water--sort o' squeezed itself dry.\"\n\nCosmo shook his head.\n\n\"We are not yet in the heart of it,\" he said. \"It is evident to me now that\nwhat I took for the nucleus was only a close-coiled spiral, and we're run\nout of that, but the worst is yet to come. When we strike the center, then\nwe'll catch it, and there'll be no more intermissions.\"\n\n\"How long will that be?\" inquired Captain Arms.\n\n\"It may be a week, and it may be a month, though I hardly think it will be\nso long as that. The earth is going about twelve miles a second--that's\nmore than a million miles a day--directly toward the center of the nebula.\nIt has taken ten days to go through the spiral that we have encountered,\nmaking that about ten million miles thick. It's not likely that the gap\nbetween this spiral and the nucleus of the nebula is more than thirty\nmillion miles across, at the most; so you see we'll probably be in the\nnucleus within a month, and possibly much less than a month.\"\n\nCaptain Arms took a chew of tobacco.\n\n\"We can get our bearings now,\" he remarked. \"Look, there's the moon just\nrising, and on my word, she is going to occult Aldebaran within an hour.\nI'll get an observation for longitude, and another on Polaris for latitude.\nNo running on submerged mountains for us now.\"\n\nThe captain was as good as his word, and when his observations had been\nmade and the calculations completed he announced that the position of the\nArk was: Latitude, 16 degrees 10 minutes north; longitude, 42 degrees 28\nminutes west.\n\n\"Lucky for us,\" he exclaimed, \"that the sky cleared. If we'd kept on as\nwe were going we'd have struck the Cape de Verdes, and if that had\nhappened at night we'd probably have left our bones on a drowning volcano.\nWe ought to have been ten or twelve degrees farther north to make a safe\npassage over the Sahara. What's the course now? Are you still for running\ndown the Himalaya mountains?\"\n\n\"I'll decide later what to do,\" said Cosmo Vers\u00e1l. \"Make your northing,\nand then we'll cruise around a little and see what's best to be done.\"\n\nWhen day came on, brilliant with sunshine, and the astonished passengers,\nhurrying out of their bunks, crowded about the now opened gangways and the\nportholes, which Cosmo had also ordered to be opened, and gazed with\ndelight upon the smooth blue sea, the utmost enthusiasm took possession of\nthem.\n\nThe flood was over!\n\nThey were sure of it, and they shook hands with one another and\ncongratulated themselves and hurrahed, and gave cheers for the Ark and\ncheers for Cosmo Vers\u00e1l. Then they began to think of their drowned homes\nand of their lost friends, and sadness followed joy. Cosmo was mobbed by\neager inquiries wherever he made his appearance.\n\nWas it all over for good? Would the flood dry up in a few days? How long\nwould it be before New York would be free of water? Were they going right\nback there? Did he think there was a chance that many had escaped in boats\nand ships? Couldn't they pick up the survivors if they hurried back?\n\nCosmo tried to check the enthusiasm.\n\n\"It's too early for rejoicing,\" he assured them. \"It's only a break in\nthe nebula. We've got a respite for a short time, but there's worse\ncoming. The drowning of the world will proceed. We are the only\nsurvivors, except perhaps some of those who inhabited the highlands.\nEverything less than 2,400 feet above the former level of the sea is now\nunder water. When the flood begins again it will keep on until it is\nsix miles deep over the old sea margins.\"\n\n\"Why not go back and try to rescue those who you say may have found\nsafety on the highlands?\" asked one.\n\n\"I have chosen my company,\" he said, \"and I had good reasons for the\nchoice I made. I have already added to the number, because simple humanity\ncompelled me, but I can take no more. The quantity of provisions aboard\nthe Ark is not greater than will be needed by ourselves. If the rest of\nthe world is drowned it is not my fault. I did my best to warn them.\nBesides, we could do nothing in the way of rescue even if we should go\nback for that purpose. We could not approach the submerged plateaus. We\nwould be aground before we got within sight of them.\"\n\nThese words went far to change the current of feeling among the\npassengers. When they learned that there would be danger for themselves\nin the course that had been proposed their humanity proved to be less\nstrong than their desire for self-preservation. Nevertheless, as we shall\nsee, the Ark ultimately went back to America, though not for any reason\nthat had yet been suggested.\n\nMeanwhile the unexpected respite furnished by the sudden cessation of the\ndownpour from the sky had other important results, to which we now turn.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nTHE ESCAPE OF THE PRESIDENT\n\n\nWhen Professor Abiel Pludder indited his savage response to Cosmo\nVers\u00e1l's invitation to become one of the regenerators of mankind by\nembarking in the Ark, he was expressing his professional prejudice rather\nthan his intellectual conviction. As Cosmo had remarked, Pludder had a\ngood brain and great scientific acuteness, and, although he did not\nbelieve in the nebular theory of a flood, and was obstinately opposed to\neverything that was not altogether regular and according to recognized\nauthority in science, yet he could not shut his eyes to the fact that\nsomething was going wrong in the machinery of the heavens. But it annoyed\nhim to find that his own explanations were always falsified by the event,\nwhile Cosmo Vers\u00e1l seemed to have a superhuman foreglimpse of whatever\nhappened.\n\nHis pride would not allow him to recede from the position that he had\ntaken, but he could not free himself from a certain anxiety about the\nfuture. After he had refused Cosmo Vers\u00e1l's invitation, the course of\nevents strengthened this anxiety. He found that the official\nmeteorologists were totally unable to account for the marvelous vagaries\nof the weather.\n\nFinally, when the news came of tremendous floods in the north, and of the\noverflowing of Hudson Bay, he secretly determined to make some\npreparations of his own. He still rejected the idea of a watery nebula,\nbut he began to think it possible that all the lowlands of the earth might\nbe overflowed by the sea, and by the melting of mountain snows and\nglaciers, together with deluging rainfall. After what had passed, he could\nnot think of making any public confession of his change of heart, but his\nsense of humanity compelled him to give confidential warning to his friends\nthat it would be well to be prepared to get on high ground at a moment's\nnotice.\n\nHe was on the point of issuing, but without his signature, an official\nstatement cautioning the public against unprecedented inundations, when the\nfirst tidal wave arrived on the Atlantic coast and rendered any utterance\nof that kind unnecessary. People's eyes were opened, and now they would\nlook out for themselves.\n\nPludder's private preparations amounted to no more than the securing of a\nlarge express aero, in which, if the necessity for suddenly leaving\nWashington should arise, he intended to take flight, together with\nPresident Samson, who was his personal friend, and a number of other close\nfriends, with their families. He did not think that it would be necessary,\nin any event, to go farther than the mountains of Virginia.\n\nThe rising of the sea, mounting higher at each return, at length convinced\nhim that the time had come to get away. Hundreds of air craft had already\ndeparted westward, not only from Washington, but from New York,\nPhiladelphia, Baltimore, Boston, and other seaboard cities, before\nProfessor Pludder assembled his friends by telephone on the Capitol\ngrounds, where his aero was waiting.\n\nThe lower streets of the city were under water from the overflow of the\nPotomac, which was backed up by the influx of the Atlantic into Chesapeake\nBay, and the most distressing scenes were enacted there, people fleeing in\nthe utmost disorder toward higher ground, carrying their children and some\nof their household goods, and uttering doleful cries. Many, thinking that\nthe best way to escape, embarked in frail boats on the river, which was\nrunning up-stream with frightful velocity, and rising perceptibly higher\nevery second. Most of these boats were immediately overturned or swamped.\n\nIf the start had been delayed but a little longer, the aero would have been\nmobbed by the excited people, who uttered yells of disappointment and rage\nwhen they saw it rise from its tower and sail over the city. It was the\nlast airship that left Washington, and it carried the last persons who\nescaped from the national capital before the downpour from the atmosphere\nbegan which put an end to all possibility of getting away.\n\nThere were on board, in addition to a crew of three, twenty-two persons.\nThese included President Samson, with his wife and three children, seven\nother men with their families, making, together, sixteen persons, and\nProfessor Pludder, who had no family.\n\nMore because they wished to escape from the painful scenes beneath them\nthan because they deemed that there was any occasion for particular haste,\nthey started off at high speed, and it was probably lucky for them that\nthis speed was maintained after they had left Washington out of sight.\nThey rapidly approached the Blue Ridge in the neighborhood of Luray, and\nPludder was about to order a landing there as night was approaching, when\nwith great suddenness the sky filled with dense clouds and a tremendous\ndownpour began. This was the same phenomenon which has already been\ndescribed as following closely the attack at New York on Cosmo Vers\u00e1l's\nArk.\n\nThe aero, luckily, was one of the best type, and well covered, so that they\nwere protected from the terrible force of the rain, but in the tumult there\ncould be no more thought of descending. It would have been impossible to\nmake a landing in the midst of the storm and the pouring water, which\nrushed in torrents down the mountainside. Professor Pludder was a brave man\nand full of resources when driven into a corner. Being familiar with the\nconstruction and management of aeros, for he had been educated as an\nengineer, he now took charge of the airship.\n\nWithin twenty minutes after the sky had opened its batteries--for the rain\nhad almost the force of plunging shot--a mighty wind arose, and the aero,\npitching, tossing, and dipping like a mad thing, was driven with frightful\nspeed eastward. This wild rush continued for more than an hour. By this\ntime it was full night, and the pouring rain around them was as\nimpenetrable to the sight as a black wall.\n\nThey had their electric lamps inside, and their searchlights, but it was\nimpossible to tell where they were. Pludder turned the searchlight\ndownward, but he could not make out the features of the ground beneath\nthem. It is likely that they were driven at least as far as Chesapeake Bay,\nand they may have passed directly over Washington.\n\nAt last, however, the wind slewed round, and began to blow with\nundiminished violence from the northeast. Plunging and swerving, and\nsometimes threatened with a complete somersault, the aero hurried away in\nits crazy flight, while its unfortunate inmates clung to one another, and\nheld on by any object within reach, in the endeavor to keep from being\ndashed against the metallic walls.\n\nThe crew of the aero were picked men, but no experience could have\nprepared them for the work which they now had to do. Without the ready\nbrain of Professor Pludder to direct their efforts, and without his\npersonal exertions, their aerial ship would have been wrecked within a\nquarter of an hour after the storm struck it. He seemed transformed into\nanother person. Hatless and coatless, and streaming with water, he worked\nlike a demon. He was ready at each emergency with some device which, under\nhis direction, had the effect of magic.\n\nA hundred times the aero plunged for the ground, but was saved and turned\nupward again just as it seemed on the point of striking. Up and down,\nright and left, it ran and pitched and whirled, like a cork in a whirlpool.\nSometimes it actually skimmed the ground, plowing its way through a\ntorrent of rushing water, and yet it rose again and was saved from\ndestruction.\n\nThis terrible contest lasted another hour after the turning of the wind,\nand then the latter died out. Relieved from its pressure, the aero ran on\nwith comparative ease. Professor Pludder, suspecting that they might now\nbe getting into a mountainous district, made every effort to keep the\ncraft at a high elevation, and this, notwithstanding the depressing force\nof the rain, they succeeded in doing. After the dying out of the wind they\nkept on, by the aid of their propellers, in the same direction in which it\nhad been driving them, because, in the circumstances, one way was as good\nas another.\n\nThe terrible discomfort of the President and his companions in the cabin\nof the aero was greatly relieved by the cessation of the wind, but still\nthey were in a most unfortunate state. The rain, driven by the fierce\nblasts, had penetrated through every crevice, and they were drenched to\nthe skin. No one tried to speak, for it would have been almost impossible\nto make oneself heard amid the uproar. They simply looked at one another\nin dismay and prayed for safety.\n\nProfessor Pludder, not now compelled to spend every moment in the\nmanagement of the craft, entered the cabin occasionally, pressed the hand\nof the President, smiled encouragingly on the women and children, and did\nall he could, in pantomime, to restore some degree of confidence. Inside,\nthe lights were aglow, but outside it was as dark as pitch, except where\nthe broad finger of the searchlight, plunging into the mass of tumbling\nwater, glittered and flashed.\n\nThe awful night seemed endless, but at last a pale illumination appeared\nin the air, and they knew that day had come. The spectacle of the skyey\ndeluge was now so terrible that it struck cold even to their already\nbenumbed hearts. The atmosphere seemed to have been turned into a mighty\ncataract thundering down upon the whole face of the earth. Now that they\ncould see as well as hear, the miracle of the preservation of the aero\nappeared incredible.\n\nAs the light slowly brightened, Professor Pludder, constantly on the\noutlook, caught a glimpse of a dark, misty object ahead. It loomed up so\nsuddenly, and was already so close, that before he could sufficiently\nalter the course of the aero, it struck with such violence as to crush\nthe forward end of the craft and break one of the aeroplanes. Everybody\nwas pitched headforemost, those inside falling on the flooring, while\nPludder and the three men of the crew were thrown out upon a mass of\nrocks. All were more or less seriously injured, but none was killed or\ntotally disabled.\n\nPludder sprang to his feet, and, slipping and plunging amid the downpour,\nmanaged to get back to the wreck and aid the President and the others to\nget upon their feet.\n\n\"We're lodged on a mountain!\" he yelled. \"Stay inside, under the shelter\nof the roof!\"\n\nThe three men who, together with the professor, had been precipitated out\namong the rocks, also scrambled in, and there they stood, or sat, the most\ndisconsolate and despairing group of human beings that ever the eye of an\noverseeing Providence looked down upon.\n\nThe President presented the most pitiable sight of all. Like the rest,\nhis garments were sopping, his eyes were bloodshot, his face was ghastly,\nand his tall silk hat, which he had jammed down upon his brow, had been\nsoftened by the water and crushed by repeated blows into the form of a\nclosed accordion. Of the women and children it is needless to speak; no\ndescription could convey an idea of their condition.\n\nIn these circumstances, the real strength of Professor Abiel Pludder's\nmind was splendidly displayed. He did not lose his head, and he\ncomprehended the situation, and what it was necessary to do, in a flash.\nHe got out some provisions and distributed them to the company, in some\ncases actually forcing them to eat. With his own hands he prepared coffee,\nwith the apparatus always carried by express aeros, and made them drink\nit.\n\nWhen all had thus been refreshed he approached President Samson and\nshouted in his ear:\n\n\"We shall have to stay here until the downpour ceases. To guard against the\neffects of a tempest, if one should arise, we must secure the aero in its\nplace. For that I need the aid of every man in the party. We have,\nfortunately, struck in a spot on the mountain where we are out of the way\nof the torrents of water that are pouring down through the ravines on\neither side. We can make our lodgment secure, but we must go to work\nimmediately.\"\n\nStimulated by his example, the President and the others set to work, and\nwith great difficulty, for they had to guard their eyes and nostrils from\nthe driving rain, which, sometimes, in spite of their precautions, nearly\nsmothered them, they succeeded in fastening the aero to the rocks by means\nof metallic cables taken from its stores. When this work was finished they\nreturned under the shelter of the cabin roof and lay down exhausted. So\nworn out were they that all of them quickly fell into a troubled sleep.\n\nIt would be needless to relate in detail the sufferings, mental and\nphysical, that they underwent during the next ten days. While they were\nhanging there on the mountain the seaboard cities of the world were\ndrowned, and Cosmo Vers\u00e1l's Ark departed on the remarkable voyage that has\nbeen described in a former chapter. They had plenty of provisions, for the\naero had been well stored, but partly through precaution and partly because\nof lack of appetite they ate sparingly. The electric generators of the aero\nhad not been injured in the wreck of the craft, and they were able to\nsupply themselves with sufficient heat, and with light inside the cabin at\nnight.\n\nOnce they had a strange visitor--a half-drowned bear, which had\nstruggled up the mountain from its den somewhere below--but that was the\nonly living creature beside themselves that they saw. After gazing\nwistfully at the aero from the top of a rock the poor bear, fighting the\nchoking rain with its soaked paws, stumbled into one of the torrents that\npoured furiously down on each side, and was swept from their sight.\n\nFortunately, the wind that they had anticipated did not come, but\nfrequently they saw or heard the roaring downpours of solid watery\ncolumns like those that had so much astonished Cosmo Vers\u00e1l and Captain\nArms in the midst of the Atlantic, but none came very near them.\n\nProfessor Pludder ventured out from time to time, clambering a little way\nup and down the projecting ridge of the mountain on which they were lodged,\nand at length was able to assure his companions that they were on the\nnorthwestern face of Mount Mitchell, the highest peak of the Appalachian\nrange. With the aid of his pocket aneroid, making allowance for the\neffect of the lifting of the whole atmosphere by the flood, and summoning\nhis knowledge of the locality--for he had explored, in former years, all\nthe mountains in this region--he arrived at the conclusion that their\nplace of refuge was elevated about four thousand feet above the former\nlevel of the sea.\n\nAt first their range of vision did not allow them to see the condition of\nthe valleys below them, but as the water crept higher it gradually came\ninto view. It rose steadily up the slopes beneath, which had already been\nstripped of their covering of trees and vegetation by the force of the\ndescending torrents, until on the tenth day it had arrived almost within\nreach. Since, as has just been said, they were four thousand feet above\nthe former level of the sea, it will be observed that the water must\nhave been rising much more rapidly than the measurements of Cosmo Vers\u00e1l\nindicated. Its average rate of rise had been three instead of two inches\nper minute, and the world was buried deeper than Cosmo thought. The cause\nof his error will be explained later.\n\nThe consternation of the little party when they thus beheld the rapid\ndrowning of the world below them, and saw no possibility of escape for\nthemselves if the water continued to advance, as it evidently would do,\ncannot be depicted. Some of them were driven insane, and were with\ndifficulty prevented by those who retained their senses from throwing\nthemselves into the flood.\n\nPludder was the only one who maintained a command over his nerves,\nalthough he now at last _believed in the nebula_. He recognized that there\nwas no other possible explanation of the flood than that which Cosmo Vers\u00e1l\nhad offered long before it began. In his secret heart he had no expectation\nof ultimate escape, yet he was strong enough to continue to encourage his\ncompanions with hopes which he could not himself entertain.\n\nWhen, after nightfall on the tenth day, the water began to lap the lower\nparts of the aero, he was on the point of persuading the party to clamber\nup the rocks in search of the shelter above, but as he stepped out of the\ndoor of the cabin to reconnoiter the way, with the aid of the searchlight\nwhich he had turned up along the ridge, he was astonished to find the rain\nrapidly diminishing in force; and a few minutes later it ceased entirely,\nand the stars shone out.\n\nThe sudden cessation of the roar upon the roof brought everybody to their\nfeet, and before Professor Pludder could communicate the good news all\nwere out under the sky, rejoicing and offering thanks for their\ndeliverance. The women were especially affected. They wept in one\nanother's arms, or convulsively clasped their children to their breasts.\n\nAt length the President found his voice.\n\n\"What has happened?\" he asked.\n\nProfessor Pludder, with the new light that had come to him, was as ready\nwith an explanation as Cosmo Vers\u00e1l himself had been under similar\ncircumstances.\n\n\"We must have run out of the nebula.\"\n\n\"The nebula!\" returned Mr. Samson in surprise. \"Has there been a nebula,\nthen?\"\n\n\"Without question,\" was the professor's answer. \"Nothing but an encounter\nwith a watery nebula could have had such a result.\"\n\n\"But you always said----\" began the President.\n\n\"Yes,\" Pludder broke in, \"but one may be in error sometimes.\"\n\n\"Then, Cosmo Vers\u00e1l----\"\n\n\"Let us not discuss Cosmo Vers\u00e1l,\" exclaimed Professor Pludder, with a\nreturn of his old dictatorial manner.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nPROFESSOR PLUDDER'S DEVICE\n\n\nMorning dawned brilliantly on Mount Mitchell and revealed to the\nastonished eyes of the watchers an endless expanse of water, gleaming and\nsparkling in the morning sunlight. It was a spectacle at once beautiful\nand fearful, and calculated to make their hearts sink with pity no less\nthan with terror. But for a time they were distracted from the awful\nthoughts which such a sight must inspire by anxiety concerning themselves.\nThey could not drive away the fear that, at any moment, the awful clouds\nmight return and the terrible downpour be resumed.\n\nBut Professor Pludder, whose comprehension of the cause of the deluge was\ngrowing clearer the more he thought about it, did not share the anxiety\nof the President and the others.\n\n\"The brightness of the sky,\" he said, \"shows that there is no considerable\nquantity of condensing vapor left in the atmosphere. If the earth has run\nout of the nebula, that is likely to be the end of the thing. If there is\nmore of the nebulous matter in surrounding space we may miss it entirely,\nor, if not, a long time would elapse before we came upon it.\n\n\"The gaps that exist in nebulae are millions of miles across, and the\nearth would require days and weeks to go such distances, granting that it\nwere traveling in the proper direction. I think it altogether probable\nthat this nebula, which must be a small one as such things go, consists\nof a single mass, and that, having traversed it, we are done with it. We\nare out of our troubles.\"\n\n\"Well, hardly,\" said the President. \"Here we are, prisoners on a mountain,\nwith no way of getting down, the whole land beneath being turned into a\nsea. We can't stay here indefinitely. For how long a time are we\nprovisioned?\"\n\n\"We have compressed food enough to last this party a month,\" replied\nProfessor Pludder; \"that is to say, if we are sparing of it. For water we\ncannot lack, since this that surrounds us is not salt, and if it were we\ncould manage to distil it. But, of course, when I said we were out of our\ntroubles I meant only that there was no longer any danger of being\nswallowed up by the flood. It is true that we cannot think of remaining\nhere. We must get off.\"\n\n\"But how? Where can we go?\"\n\nProfessor Pludder thought a long time before he answered this question.\nFinally he said, measuring his words:\n\n\"The water is four thousand feet above the former level of the sea. There\nis no land sufficiently lofty to rise above it this side of the Colorado\nplateau.\"\n\n\"And how far is that?\"\n\n\"Not less than eleven hundred miles in an air line.\"\n\nThe President shuddered.\n\n\"Then, all this vast country of ours from here to the feet of the Rocky\nMountains is now under water thousands of feet deep!\"\n\n\"There can be no doubt of it. The Atlantic Coast States, the Southern\nStates, the Mississippi Valley, the region of the Great Lakes, and Canada\nare now a part of the Atlantic Ocean.\"\n\n\"And all the great cities--gone! Merciful Father! What a thought!\"\n\nThe President mused for a time, and gradually a frown came upon his brow.\nHe glanced at Professor Pludder with a singular look. Then his cheek\nreddened, and an angry expression came into his eyes. Suddenly he turned\nto the professor and said sternly:\n\n\"You said you did not wish to discuss Cosmo Vers\u00e1l. I should not think\nyou would! Who predicted this deluge? Did _you_?\"\n\n\"I----\" began Professor Pludder, taken aback by the President's manner.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" interrupted the President, \"I know what you would say. You\ndidn't predict it because you didn't see it coming. But _why_ didn't\nyou see it? What have we got observatories and scientific societies\nfor if they can't _see_ or _comprehend_ anything? Didn't Cosmo Vers\u00e1l\nwarn you? Didn't he tell you where to look, and what to look for? Didn't\nhe show you his proofs?\"\n\n\"We thought they were fallacious,\" stammered Professor Pludder.\n\n\"You _thought_ they were fallacious--well, _were_ they fallacious? Does\nthis spectacle of a nation drowned look 'fallacious' to you? Why didn't\nyou study the matter until you understood it? Why did you issue\nofficially, and with my ignorant sanction--may God forgive me for my\nblindness!--statement after statement, assuring the people that there was\nno danger--statements that were even abusive toward him who alone should\nhave been heard?\n\n\"And yet, as now appears, you knew nothing about it. Millions upon millions\nhave perished through your obstinate opposition to the truth. They might\nhave saved themselves if they had been permitted to listen to the many\ntimes reiterated warnings of Cosmo Vers\u00e1l.\n\n\"Oh, if _I_ had only listened to him, and issued a proclamation as he urged\nme to do! But I followed _your_ advice--_you_, in whose learning and\npretended science I put blind faith! _Abiel Pludder, I would not have upon\nmy soul the weight that now rests on yours for all the wealth that the lost\nworld carried down into its watery grave!_\"\n\nAs the President ceased speaking he turned away and sank upon a rock,\npressing his hands upon his throat to suppress the sobs that broke forth\ndespite his efforts. His form shook like an aspen.\n\nThe others crowded around excitedly, some of the women in hysterics, and\nthe men not knowing what to do or say. Professor Pludder, completely\noverwhelmed by the suddenness and violence of the attack, went off by\nhimself and sat down with his head in his hands. After a while he arose\nand approached the President, who had not moved from his place on the\nrock.\n\n\"George,\" he said--they had known each other from boyhood--\"I have made a\nterrible mistake. And yet I was not alone in it. The majority of my\ncolleagues were of my opinion, as were all the learned societies of\nEurope. No such thing as a watery nebula has ever been known to science.\nIt was inconceivable.\"\n\n\"Some of your colleagues did not think so,\" said the President, looking\nup.\n\n\"But they were not really convinced, and they were aware that they were\nflying in the face of all known laws.\"\n\n\"I am afraid,\" said the President dryly, \"that science does not know all\nthe laws of the universe yet.\"\n\n\"I repeat,\" resumed Professor Pludder, \"that I made a fearful mistake. I\nhave recognized the truth too late. I accept the awful burden of blame\nthat rests upon me, and I now wish to do everything in my power to\nretrieve the consequences of my terrible error.\"\n\nThe President arose and grasped the professor's hand.\n\n\"Forgive me, Abiel,\" he said, with emotion, \"if I have spoken too much in\nthe manner of a judge pronouncing sentence. I was overwhelmed by the\nthought of the inconceivable calamity that has come upon us. I believe\nthat you acted conscientiously and according to your best lights, and it\nis not for any mortal to judge you for an error thus committed. Let us\nthink only of what _we_ must do now.\"\n\n\"To that thought,\" responded Professor Pludder, returning the pressure of\nthe President's hand, \"I shall devote all my energy. If I can save only\nthis little party I shall have done something in the way of atonement.\"\n\nIt was a deep humiliation for a man of Professor Pludder's proud and\nuncompromising nature to confess that he had committed an error more\nfearful in its consequences than had ever been laid at the door of a human\nbeing, but Cosmo Vers\u00e1l had rightly judged him when he assured Joseph\nSmith that Pludder was morally sound, and, in a scientific sense, had\nthe root of the matter in him. When his mental vision was clear, and\nunclouded by prejudice, no one was more capable of high achievements.\n\nHe quickly proved his capacity now, as he had already proved it during\nthe preceding, adventures of the President's party. It was perfectly plain\nto him that their only chance was in getting to Colorado at the earliest\npossible moment. The eastern part of the continent was hopelessly buried,\nand even on the high plains of the Middle West the fury of the downpour\nmight have spread universal disaster and destroyed nearly all the\nvegetation; but, in any event, it was there alone that the means of\nprolonging life could be sought.\n\nWith the problem squarely before his mind, he was not long in finding a\nsolution. His first step was to make a thorough examination of the aero,\nwith the hope that the damage that it had suffered might be reparable. He\nhad all the tools that would be needed, as it was the custom for express\naeros to carry a complete equipment for repairs; but unfortunately one of\nthe planes of the aero was wrecked beyond the possibility of repair. He\nknew upon what delicate adjustments the safety of the modern airship\ndepended, and he did not dare undertake a voyage with a lame craft.\n\nThen the idea occurred to him of trying to escape by water. The aero was\na machine of the very latest type, and made of levium, consequently it\nwould float better than wood.\n\nIf the opposition of shipbuilders, incited and backed by selfish interests,\nhad not prevented the employment of levium in marine construction, millions\nof lives might now have been saved; but, as we have before said, only a\nfew experimental boats of levium had been made.\n\nMoreover, like all aeros intended for long trips, this one had what was\ncalled a \"boat-bottom,\" intended to enable it to remain afloat with its\nburden in case of an accidental fall into a large body of water. Pludder\nsaw that this fact would enable him to turn the wreck into a raft.\n\nIt would only be necessary to reshape the craft a little, and this was the\neasier because the aero was put together in such a manner with screw-bolts\nand nuts that it could be articulated or disarticulated as readily as a\nwatch. He had entire confidence in his engineering skill, and in the\nability of the three experienced men of the crew to aid him. He decided to\nemploy the planes for outriders, which would serve to increase the\nbuoyancy and stability.\n\nAs soon as he had completed his plan in his mind he explained his\nintentions to the President. The latter and the other members of the party\nwere at first as much startled as surprised by the idea of embarking on a\nvoyage of eleven hundred miles in so questionable a craft, but Professor\nPludder assured them that everything would go well.\n\n\"But how about the propulsion?\" asked Mr. Samson. \"You can't depend on the\nwind, and we've got no sails.\"\n\n\"I have thought that all out,\" said Pludder. \"I shall use the engine, and\nrearrange one of the aerial screws so that it will serve for a propeller.\nI do not expect to get up any great speed, but if we can make only as much\nas two miles an hour we shall arrive on the borders of the Colorado upland,\nfive thousand feet above sea, within about twenty-three days. We may be\nable to do better than that.\"\n\nNobody felt much confidence in this scheme except its inventor, but it\nappeared to be the only thing that could be done, and so they all fell to\nwork, each aiding as best he could, and after four days of hard work the\nremarkable craft was ready for its adventurous voyage.\n\nProfessor Pludder had succeeded even better than he anticipated in\ntransforming one of the aerial screws into a propeller. Its original\nsituation was such that it naturally, as it were, fell into the proper\nplace when the \"hull\" was partly submerged, and, the blades being made of\nconcentric rows of small plates, there was no difficulty in reducing them\nto a manageable size. The position of the engine did not need to be\nshifted at all.\n\nThe \"outriders,\" made up of the discarded planes, promised to serve their\npurpose well, and the cabin remained for a comfortable \"deck-house.\" A\nrudder had been contrived by an alteration of the one which had served for\nguiding the aero in its flights.\n\nThe water was close to their feet, and there was no great difficulty in\npushing the affair off the rocks and getting it afloat. The women and\nchildren were first put aboard, and then the men scrambled in, and Pludder\nset the motors going. The improvised propeller churned and spluttered,\nbut it did its work after a fashion, and, under a blue sky, in dazzling\nsunshine, with a soft southerly breeze fanning the strange sea that\nspread around them, they soon saw the bared rocks and deeply scored\nflanks of Mount Mitchell receding behind them.\n\nThey were delighted to find that they were making, at the very start, no\nless than three miles an hour. Pludder clapped his hands and exclaimed:\n\n\"This is capital! In but little over two weeks we shall be safe on the\ngreat plains. I have good hope that many have survived there, and that we\nshall find a plenty of everything needed. With the instruments that were\naboard the aero I can make observations to determine our position, and I\nshall steer for the Pike's Peak region.\"\n\nWhen the party had become accustomed to their situation, and had gained\nconfidence in their craft by observing how buoyantly it bore them, they\nbecame almost cheerful in their demeanor. The children gradually lost all\nfear, and, with the thoughtless joy of childhood in the pleasures and\nwonders of the present moment, amused themselves in the cabin, and about\nthe deck, which had been surrounded with guard lines made of wire cable.\n\nThe water was almost waveless, and, if no storm should arise, there\nappeared to be no reason for anxiety concerning the outcome of their\nadventure. But as they drove slowly on over the submerged range of the\nGreat Smokies, and across the valleys of Eastern Tennessee, and then over\nthe Cumberland range, and so out above the lowlands, they could not keep\ntheir thoughts from turning to what lay beneath that fearful ocean. And\noccasionally something floated to the surface that wrenched their\nheart-strings and caused them to avert their faces.\n\nProfessor Pludder kept them informed of their location. Now they were over\ncentral Tennessee; now Nashville lay more than three thousand feet beneath\ntheir keel; now they were crossing the valley of the Tennessee River; now\nthe great Mississippi was under them, hidden deep beneath the universal\nflood; now they were over the highlands of southern Missouri; and now over\nthose of Kansas.\n\n\"George,\" said Professor Pludder one day, addressing the President, with\nmore emotion than was often to be detected in his voice, \"would you like\nto know what is beneath us now?\"\n\n\"What is it, Abiel?\"\n\n\"Our boyhood home--Wichita.\"\n\nThe President bowed his head upon his hands and groaned.\n\n\"Yes,\" continued Professor Pludder musingly, \"there it lies, three thousand\nfeet deep. There is the Arkansas, along whose banks we used to play, with\nits golden waters now mingling feebly with the mighty flood that covers\nthem. There is the schoolhouse and the sandy road where we ran races\nbarefoot in the hot summer dust. There is your father's house, and mine,\nand the homes of all our early friends--and where are _they?_ Would to God\nthat I had not been so blind!\"\n\n\"But there was another not so blind,\" said the President, with something\nof the condemnatory manner of his former speech.\n\n\"I know it--I know it too well now,\" returned the professor. \"But do not\ncondemn me, George, for what I did not foresee and could not help.\"\n\n\"I am sorry,\" said the President sadly, \"that you have awakened these old\nmemories. But I do not condemn you, though I condemn your science--or your\nlack of science. But we can do nothing. Let us speak of it no more.\"\n\nThe weather was wonderful, considering what had so recently occurred. No\nclouds formed in the sky, there was only a gentle breeze stirring, at\nnight the heavens glittered with starry gems, and by day the sun shone so\nhotly that awnings were spread over those whose duties required them to be\nemployed outside the shelter of the cabin. The improvised propeller and\nrudder worked to admiration, and some days they made as much as eighty\nmiles in the twenty-four hours.\n\nAt length, on the fourteenth day of their strange voyage, they caught\nsight of a curiously shaped \"pike\" that projected above the horizon far to\nthe west. At the same time they saw, not far away toward the north and\ntoward the south, a low line, like a sea-beach.\n\n\"We are getting into shallow water now,\" said Professor Pludder. \"I have\nbeen following the course of the Arkansas in order to be sure of a\nsufficient depth, but now we must be very careful. We are close to the\nsite of Las Animas, which is surrounded with land rising four thousand\nfeet above sea-level. If we should get aground there would be no hope for\nus. That pike in the distance is Pike's Peak.\"\n\n\"And what is that long line of beach that stretches on the north and\nsouth?\" asked the President.\n\n\"It is the topographic line of four thousand feet,\" replied the\nprofessor.\n\n\"And we shall encounter it ahead?\"\n\n\"Yes, it makes a curve about Las Animas, and then the land lies at an\naverage elevation of four thousand feet, until it takes another rise\nbeyond Pueblo.\"\n\n\"But we cannot sail across this half-submerged area,\" said the President.\n\n\"There are depressions,\" Professor Pludder responded, \"and I hope to be\nable to follow their traces until we reach land that still lies well\nabove the water.\"\n\nNear nightfall they got so close to the \"beach\" that they could hear the\nsurf, not a thundering sound, but a soft, rippling wash of the slight\nwaves. The water about them was ruddy with thick sediment. Professor\nPludder did not dare to venture farther in the coming darkness, and he\ndropped overboard two of the aero's grapples, which he had heavily\nweighted and attached to wire cables. They took the ground at a depth of\nonly ten feet. There was no wind and no perceptible current, and so they\nrode all night at anchor off this strangest of coasts.\n\nAt daybreak they lifted their anchors, and went in search of the\ndepressions of which the professor had spoken. So accurate was his\ntopographic knowledge and so great his skill, that late in the afternoon\nthey saw a tall chimney projecting above the water a little ahead.\n\n\"There's all that remains of Pueblo,\" said Professor Pludder.\n\nThey anchored again that night, and the next day, cautiously approaching\na bluff that arose precipitously from the water, their hearts were\ngladdened by the sight of three men, standing on a bluff, excitedly\nbeckoning to them, and shouting at the top of their voices.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nMUTINY IN THE ARK\n\n\nWe left Cosmo Vers\u00e1l and his arkful of the flower of mankind in the midst\nof what was formerly the Atlantic Ocean, but which had now expanded over\nso many millions of square miles that had once been the seats of vast\nempires that to an eye looking at it with a telescope from Mars it would\nhave been unrecognizable.\n\nAll of eastern North America, all of South America to the feet of the\nAndes, all but the highest mountains of Europe, nearly all of Africa,\nexcept some of the highlands of the south, all of northern and\nsouthwestern Asia, as well as the peninsula of India, all of China and\nthe adjacent lands and islands except the lofty peaks, the whole of\nAustralia, and the archipelagoes of the Pacific, had become parts of the\nfloor of a mighty ocean which rolled unbroken from pole to pole.\n\nThe Great Deep had resumed its ancient reign, and what was left of the\nhabitable globe presented to view only far separated islands and the\nserrated tops of such ranges as the Alps, the Caucasus, the Himalayas,\nand the Andes. The astonished inhabitants of the ocean depths now swam\nover the ruins of great cities, and brushed with their fins the chiseled\ncapitals of columns that had supported the proudest structures of human\nhands.\n\nWe have seen how the unexpected arrest of the flood had left Cosmo\nuncertain as to the course that he ought to pursue. But he did not long\nremain in doubt. He was sure that the downpour would be resumed after an\ninterval which at the most could not exceed a few weeks, and he resolved\nto continue his way toward the future land of promise in Asia.\n\nBut he thought that he would have time to turn his prow in the direction\nof Europe, for he felt a great desire to know by actual inspection to what\nheight the water had attained. He was certain that it could not be less\nthan he had estimated--the indications of his rain-gage had been too\nunvarying to admit of doubt on that point--but he had no means of direct\nmeasurement since he could not sound the tremendous depths beneath the\nArk.\n\nAfter long meditation on the probable effects of the descending columns of\nwater which he had seen, he concluded that they might have added more\nrapidly than he first supposed to the increase of the general level.\nBesides, he reflected that there was no proof that the general downpour\nmight not have been greater over some parts of the earth than others. All\nthese doubts could be dissipated if he could get a good look at some lofty\nmountain range, such as the Sierra Nevada of Spain, or the Pyrenees, or,\nif he could venture within sight of them, the Alps.\n\nSo he said to Captain Arms:\n\n\"Steer for the coast of Europe.\"\n\nThe fine weather had produced a good effect upon the spirits of the\ncompany. Not only were the ports and the gangways all open, but Cosmo\nordered the temporary removal of rows of adjustable plates on the sides of\nthe vessel, which transformed the broad outer gangways, running its whole\nlength, into delightful promenade decks. There, in cozy chairs, and\nprotected with rugs, the passengers sat, fanned by a refreshing breeze,\nand dazzled by the splendor of the ocean.\n\nThey recalled, by their appearance, a shipload of summer tourists bound\nfor the wonders and pleasures of foreign parts. This likeness to a\npleasure cruise was heightened by the constant attentions of the crew,\nunder Cosmo's orders, who carried about refreshing drinks and lunches,\nand conducted themselves like regular ocean \"stewards.\"\n\nIt seemed impossible to believe that the world had been drowned, and some\nalmost persuaded themselves that the whole thing was a dream.\n\nIt must not be supposed that the thousand-odd persons who composed this\nremarkable ship's company were so hard-hearted, so selfish, so forgetful,\nso morally obtuse, that they never thought of the real horror of their\nsituation, and of the awful calamity that had overwhelmed so many millions\nof their fellow-creatures. They thought of all that only too seriously\nand in spite of themselves. The women especially were overwhelmed by it.\nBut they did not wish to dwell upon it, and Cosmo Vers\u00e1l did not wish that\nthey should.\n\nAt night he had musicians play in the grand saloon; he distributed books\namong the passengers from a large library which he had selected; and at\nlast he had the stage set, and invited his friends, the players, to\nentertain the company.\n\nBut he would have no plays but those of Shakespeare.\n\nThere were, probably, not half a dozen persons in the Ark who had ever\nseen representations of these great dramas, and very few who had read them,\nso that they had the advantage of complete novelty.\n\nThe play selected for the first representation was the tragedy of \"King\nLear,\" a strange choice, it would, at first sight, seem, but Cosmo Vers\u00e1l\nhad a deep knowledge of human nature. He knew that only tragedy would be\nendured there, and that it must be tragedy so profound and overmastering\nthat it would dominate the feelings of those who heard and beheld it. It\nwas the principle of immunizing therapeutics, where poison paralyzes\npoison.\n\nIt came out as he anticipated. The audience, unused to such depth of\ndramatic passion, for the plays to which they had been accustomed had been\nfar from the Shakespearian standard, was wholly absorbed in the\ndevelopment of the tragedy. It was a complete revelation to them, and they\nwere carried out of themselves, and found in the sympathy awakened by this\nheart-crushing spectacle of the acme of human woe an unconscious solace for\n their own moral anguish.\n\nAfterward Cosmo put upon the stage \"Hamlet,\" and \"Othello,\" and \"Macbeth,\"\nand \"Coriolanus,\" and \"Julius Caesar,\" but he avoided, for the present, the\nless tragic dramas. And all of them, being new to the hearers, produced an\nenormous effect.\n\nOn alternate nights he substituted music for the drama, and, as this was\nconfined to the most majestic productions of the great masters of the past,\nmany of whose works, like those of Shakespeare, had long been neglected if\nnot forgotten, their power over the spirits of the company was, perhaps,\neven more pronounced.\n\nCosmo Vers\u00e1l was already beginning the education of his chosen band of\nrace regenerators, while he mused upon the wonders that the science of\neugenics would achieve after the world should have reemerged from the\nwaters.\n\nOne of the most singular effects of the music was that produced upon the\ninsane billionaire, Amos Blank. He had been confined in the room that\nCosmo had assigned to him, and was soothed, whenever Cosmo could find time\nto visit him, with pretended acquiescence in his crazed notion that the\ntrip of the Ark was part of a scheme to \"corner\" the resources of the\nworld.\n\nCosmo persuaded him that the secret was unknown except to themselves, and\nthat it was essential to success that he (Blank) should remain in\nretirement, and accordingly the latter expressed no desire to leave his\nplace of imprisonment, which he regarded as the headquarters of the\ncombination, passing hours in covering sheets of paper with columns of\nfigures, which he fancied represented the future profits of the\nenterprise.\n\nOne night when a symphony of Beethoven was to be played, Cosmo led Amos\nBlank through the crowded saloon and placed him near the musicians. He\nresisted at first, and when he saw the crowd he drew back, exclaiming:\n\n\"What? Not overboard yet?\"\n\nBut Cosmo soothed him with some whispered promise, and he took his seat,\nglancing covertly around him. Then the instruments struck up, and\nimmediately fixed his attention. As the musical theme developed his eyes\ngradually lost their wild look, and a softened expression took its place.\nHe sank lower in his seat, and rested his head upon his hand. His whole\nsoul seemed, at last, to be absorbed in the music. When it was finished\nBlank was a changed man.\n\nThen Cosmo clearly explained to him all that had happened.\n\nAfter the first overwhelming effect of his reawakening to the realities\nof his situation had passed, the billionaire was fully restored to all\nhis faculties. Henceforth he mingled with the other passengers and, as if\nthe change that had come over his spirit had had greater results than the\nsimple restoration of sanity, he became one of the most popular and useful\nmembers of Cosmo Vers\u00e1l's family of pilgrims.\n\nAmong the other intellectual diversions which Cosmo provided was something\nquite unique, due to his own mental bias. This consisted of \"conferences,\"\nheld in the grand saloon, afternoons, in the presence of the entire\ncompany, at which the principal speakers were his two \"speculative\ngeniuses,\" Costak\u00e9 Theriade and Sir Wilfrid Athelstone. They did not care\nvery much for one another and each thought that the time allotted to the\nother was wasted.\n\nTheriade wished to talk continuously of the infinite energy stored up in\nthe atoms of matter, and of the illimitable power which the release of\nthat energy, by the system that he had all but completed, would place at\nthe disposition of man; and at the same time Sir Athelstone could with\ndifficulty be held in leash while he impatiently awaited an opportunity to\nexplain how excessively near he had arrived to the direct production of\nprotoplasm from inanimate matter, and the chemical control of living cells,\nso that henceforth man could people or unpeople the earth as he liked.\n\nOne evening, when everybody not on duty was in bed, Captain Arms, with his\nwhiskers fairly bristling, entered Cosmo's cabin, where the latter was\ndictating to Joseph Smith, and softly approaching his chief, with a furtive\nglance round the room, stooped and whispered something in his ear. A\nstartled, though incredulous, expression appeared on Cosmo's face, and he\nsprang to his feet, but before speaking he obeyed a sign from the captain\nand told Smith to leave the room. Then he locked the door and returned to\nhis table, where he dropped into a chair, exclaiming in a guarded voice:\n\n\"Great Heaven, can this be possible! Have you not made a mistake?\"\n\n\"No,\" returned the captain in a stridulous whisper, \"I have made no\nmistake. I'm absolutely sure. If something is not done instantly we are\nlost!\"\n\n\"This is terrible!\" returned Cosmo, taking his head in his hands. \"You\nsay it is that fellow Campo? I never liked his looks.\"\n\n\"He is the ringleader,\" replied the captain. \"The first suspicion of what\nhe was up to came to me through an old sailor who has been with me on many\na voyage. He overheard Campo talking with another man and he listened.\nTrust an old sea dog to use his ears and keep himself out of notice.\"\n\n\"And what did they say?\"\n\n\"Enough to freeze the marrow in your bones! Campo proposed to begin by\nthrowing 'old Vers\u00e1l' and me into the sea, and then he said, with us gone,\nand nobody but a lot of muddle-headed scientists to deal with, it would be\neasy to take the ship; seize all the treasure in her; make everybody who\nwould not join the mutiny walk the plank, except the women, and steer for\nsome place where they could land and lead a jolly life.\n\n\"'You see,' says Campo, 'this flood is a fake. There ain't going to be no\nmore flood; it's only a shore wash. But there's been enough of it to fix\nthings all right for us. We've got the world in our fist! There's millions\nof money aboard this ship, and there's plenty of female beauty, and we've\nonly got to reach out and take it.'\"\n\nCosmo Vers\u00e1l's brow darkened as he listened, and a look that would have\ncowed the mutineers if they could have seen it came into his eyes. His\nhand nervously clutched a paper-knife which broke in his grasp, as he said\nin a voice trembling with passion:\n\n\"They don't _know_ me--_you_ don't know me. Show me the proofs of this\nconspiracy. Who are the others? Campo and his friend can't be alone.\"\n\n\"Alone!\" exclaimed the captain, unconsciously raising his voice. \"There's\na dozen as black-handed rascals in it as ever went unswung.\"\n\n\"Do you know them?\"\n\n\"Jim Waters does.\"\n\n\"Why haven't you told me sooner? How long has it been going on?\"\n\n\"Almost ever since the deluge stopped, I think; but it was only last night\nthat Waters got on the track of it, and only now that he told me. This\nfellow that Waters heard Campo talking to is plainly a new recruit. I say\nthere are a dozen, because Waters has found out that number; but I don't\nknow but that there may be a hundred.\"\n\n\"How did these wretches get aboard?\" demanded Cosmo, fiercely opening and\nshutting his fists.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" said the captain, \"but that is up to you to say.\"\n\n\"So it is,\" replied Cosmo, with a grim look; \"and it's 'up to me' to say\nwhat'll become of them. I see how it is, they must have got in with the\nlast lot that I took--under assumed names, very likely. I've been more\nthan once on the point of calling that man Campo up and questioning him. I\nwas surprised by his hangdog look the first time I saw him. But I have\nbeen so busy.\"\n\n\"You'll have to get busy in another sense if you mean to save this ship\nand your life,\" said the captain earnestly.\n\n\"So I shall. Are you armed? No? Then take these--and use 'em when I give\nthe word.\"\n\nHe handed the captain two heavy automatic pistols, and put a pair in his\nown side pockets.\n\n\"Now,\" he continued, \"the first thing is to make sure that we've got the\nright men--and _all of them_. Call in Joseph Smith.\"\n\nThe captain went to the door, and as he approached it there was a knock.\nHe turned the key and cautiously opened a crack to look out. The door was\ninstantly slammed in his face, and six men rushed in, with Campo, a burly,\nblack-browed fellow, at their head. Three of the men threw the captain on\nhis back, and pinioned his hands before he could draw a weapon, while\nCampo and the others sprang toward Cosmo Vers\u00e1l, Campo pointing a pistol\nat his head.\n\n\"It's all up, Mr. Vers\u00e1l!\" cried Campo with a sneer. \"I'll take command of\nthis ship, and you'll go fish for nebulas.\"\n\nCosmo had one advantage; he was behind his desk, and it was a broad and\nlong one, and placed almost against the wall. They could not get at him\nwithout getting round the desk. Campo did not fire, though he might have\nshot Cosmo in his tracks; but evidently he was nourishing the idea of\nmaking him walk the plank. With a sign he commanded his co-conspirators\nto flank the desk at each end, while he kept Cosmo covered with his\npistol.\n\nBut with a lightning movement, Cosmo dropped under the desk, and, favored\nby his slight form and his extreme agility, darted like a cat past Campo's\nlegs, and, almost before the latter could turn round, was out of the open\ndoor. Campo fired at the retreating form, but the bullet went wide of the\nmark. The pistol was practically noiseless, and the sound reached no ears\nin the staterooms.\n\nIt happened that a switch controlling the lights in the gangway was on the\nwall by Cosmo's door, and in passing he swiftly reached up and turned it\noff. Thus he was in complete darkness, and when Campo darted out of the\ndoor he could not see the fugitive. He could hear his footsteps, however,\nand with two of his companions he rushed blindly after him, firing two or\nthree shots at random. But Cosmo had turned at the first cross passage,\nand then at the next, this part of the Ark being a labyrinth of corridors,\nand the pursuers quickly lost all trace of him.\n\nCampo and his companions made their way back to Cosmo's cabin, where their\nfellows were guarding Captain Arms. They found the switch in the passage\nand turned on the light. They were almost immediately joined by several\nother conspirators conducting Joseph Smith, bound and gagged. They held a\nshort consultation, and Campo, with many curses, declared that Cosmo\nVers\u00e1l must be caught at all hazards.\n\n\"The big-headed fiend!\" he cried, gnashing his teeth. \"Let me get my\ngrippers on him and I'll squelch him like a bug!\"\n\nThey threw Joseph Smith into the room beside the helpless captain, after\ntaking the latter's pistols, locked the door from the outside, and\nhurried off on their search. In the passages they encountered several\nmore of their friends. They now numbered fifteen, all armed. This may\nseem a small number to undertake to capture the Ark; but it must be\nremembered that among the thousand-odd inmates, exclusive of the crew,\nonly about one in three was a man, and the majority of these were\npeaceable scientists who, it was to be presumed, had no fight in them.\n\nAt any rate, Campo, with the reckless courage of his kind, felt confident\nthat if he could get Cosmo Vers\u00e1l, with the captain and Joseph Smith, out\nof the way, he could easily overmaster the others. He had not much fear\nof the crew, for he knew that they were not armed, and he had succeeded\nin winning over three of their number, the only ones he had thought\nat all dangerous, because he had read their character. More than half\nthe crew were employed about the engines or on the animal deck, and most\nof the others were simply stewards who would not stand before the pistols.\n\nBut, while the mutineers were hurriedly searching the corridors, Cosmo\nhad run straight to the bridge, where he found two of his men in charge,\nand whence he sent an electric call to all the men employed in the\nnavigation of the vessel. They came running from various directions, but\na dozen of them were caught in the passages by the mutineers and bound\nbefore they could comprehend what had happened. Seven, however, succeeded\nin reaching the bridge, and among these was Jim Waters.\n\n\"There's a mutiny,\" said Cosmo. \"We've got to fight for our lives. Have\nyou got arms?\"\n\nNot one had a weapon except Waters, who displayed a pistol half as long\nas his arm.\n\n\"Here, Peterson, take this,\" said Cosmo, handing a pistol to one of the\ntwo mariners who had been on the bridge. \"They will be here in a minute.\nIf Campo had been a sailor, he'd have had possession here the first thing.\nI'll turn off all lights.\"\n\nWith that he pressed a button which put out every lamp in the ark. But\nthere was a full moon, and they concealed themselves in the shadows.\n\nPresently they heard the mutineers approaching, stumbling and cursing in\nthe darkness. Cosmo directed Peterson and Waters to place themselves at\nhis side, and told them to fire when he gave the word.\n\nThe next instant four men appeared crossing a moonlit place at the foot of\nthe steps on the outside of the dome.\n\n\"Wait,\" whispered Cosmo. \"The pistols go at a pull. We can sweep down a\ndozen in ten seconds. Let them all get in sight first.\"\n\nHalf a minute later there were twelve men climbing the steps and cautiously\nlooking up.\n\n\"Fire!\" cried Cosmo, setting the example, and three streams of blue flame\npulsated from the bridge. The sound of the bullets striking made more\nnoise than the explosions.\n\nFive or six of the men below fell, knocking down their comrades, and a\nloud curse burst from the lips of Campo, who had a bullet through his arm.\n\nThe mutineers tumbled in a heap at the bottom, and instantly Cosmo,\nswitching on all lights, led the way down upon them. His men, who had no\narms, seized anything they could get their hands on that would serve to\nstrike a blow, and followed him.\n\nThe conspirators were overwhelmed by the suddenness and fury of the attack.\n\nFour of them were killed outright and five were wounded, one so severely\nthat he survived only a few hours.\n\nCosmo's quick and overwhelming victory was due to the fact that the\nmutineers, in mounting the steps, could not see him and his men in the\nshadows, and when the automatic weapons, which fired three shots per\nsecond by repeated pressure of the trigger, from a chamber containing\ntwenty-one cartridges, once opened on them they could do nothing in the\nhail of missiles, especially when crowded together on the steps.\n\nCampo was the only one who had any fight left in him. He struck Cosmo a\nblow on the head that felled him, and then darted out upon the forepart\nof the dome, running on the cleats, and made his way to the top.\n\nCosmo was on his feet in a second and rushing in pursuit, closely followed\nby Jim Waters. The fugitive ran for the ratlines leading to the lookout on\nthe central mast. He climbed them like a squirrel, and the man in the\ncro'nest, amazed at the sight below him, stared at the approaching\nmutineer, unable to utter a cry. Campo, who, as the moonbeams showed, now\nhad a knife in his teeth, rapidly approached, and the lookout shrank in\nterror. But before Campo could reach the cro'nest, a blinding light\ndazzled his eyes. Cosmo had shouted an order to Peterson to run back to\nthe bridge and turn a searchlight upon the mast. Then Campo heard a\nthundering voice below him:\n\n\"Take another step and I'll blow you into the sea!\"\n\nHe glanced below, and saw Cosmo and Waters covering him with their\npistols.\n\n\"Not another step!\" roared Cosmo again. \"Come down, and I'll give you a\ntrial for your life.\"\n\nCampo hesitated; but, seeing that he could be shot down, and finding a\ngleam of hope in Cosmo's words, he turned and came slowly down. The\nmoment he touched the bottom he was seized by Waters and another man,\nand, under Cosmo's directions, his hands were bound behind his back.\n\nTen minutes later the members of the crew who had been caught by the\nmutineers in the gangways were all unbound, and then Cosmo broke open the\ndoor of his cabin, the key having been lost or thrown away by Campo, and\nthe captain and Joseph Smith were released.\n\n\"Well, we've got 'em,\" said Cosmo grimly to the captain. \"The mutiny is\nat an end, and there'll never be another.\"\n\nIn the meantime many of the passengers had been aroused by the unaccustomed\nnoises, although the pistols had not made enough sound to be heard from\nthe place where they were fired. Nightcapped heads appeared on all sides,\nand some, in scanty clothing, were wandering in the passageways, demanding\nwhat the trouble was. Cosmo, the captain, and Joseph Smith reassured them,\nsaying that there was no danger, and that something had happened which\nwould be explained in the morning.\n\nThe prisoners--and the whole fifteen were finally captured--were locked up\nin a strong room, and a surgeon was sent to dress their wounds. Cosmo\nVers\u00e1l and the captain resumed their accustomed places on the bridge,\nwhere they talked over the affair, and Cosmo explained his plans for the\nmorrow.\n\n\"I'll give him his trial, as I promised,\" Cosmo said in conclusion, \"and\nyou'll see what it will be. _Mutiny aboard this Ark!_\" And he struck the\nrail a violent blow with his fist.\n\nThe next morning directly after breakfast Cosmo called all passengers and\ncrew into the grand saloon, where many wondering looks were exchanged and\nmany puzzling questions asked. When the mutineers, with hands tied behind\ntheir backs and their many bandages on arms and legs, were led in,\nexclamations of astonishment were heard, and some of the timid ones shrank\naway in fear.\n\nCosmo lost no time with preliminaries.\n\n\"These men,\" he said, taking his stand upon the platform, \"have mutinied\nand tried to capture the Ark. This fellow\"--pointing to Campo--\"was the\nconcocter and leader of the plot. He intended to throw me and Captain\nArms, and all of you whom he did not wish to retain for his fiendish\npurposes, into the sea. But Heaven has delivered them into our hands. I\nhave promised them a trial, and they shall have it. But it will be a\ntrial in which justice shall not be cheated. I find that a moral poison\nhas stolen into this selected company, and I will eliminate it for once\nand all.\"\n\nThe expressions of amazement and alarm redoubled in intensity.\n\n\"Professor Abel Able, Professor Jeremiah Moses, Sir Wilfrid Athelstone,\nCostak\u00e9 Theriade,\" Cosmo continued, \"you will please come forward to act\nas members of the jury, of which I name myself also a member. I shall be\nboth judge and juror here, but I will hear what the rest of you may have\nto say.\"\n\nThe men named stepped forward with some evidences of embarrassment, and\nCosmo gravely gave them seats beside him. Then he commanded that the\nprisoners should confront the jury, and, heavily guarded, they were led to\nthe front.\n\nThe brutishness of Campo's face had never struck the passengers who had\nseen him before as it did now. He looked a veritable jailbird. At the same\ntime he was evidently in terror for his life. He muttered something which\nnobody understood.\n\nCosmo, who had informed himself of all the circumstances from Waters, and\nby privately questioning the others, had satisfied himself that the entire\nscheme of the mutiny was of Campo's contrivance, and that they had been led\ninto it solely by his persuasion and threats, ordered Waters to speak. The\nseaman told a straight story of what he had heard and seen. Cosmo himself\nthen related the events of the night. When he had finished he turned to\nCampo and demanded what he had to say.\n\nCampo again muttered under his breath, but made no attempt to defend\nhimself, simply saying:\n\n\"You promised me a trial.\"\n\n\"And haven't I given you a trial?\" demanded Cosmo with flashing eyes. \"You\nthought you held the world in your grasp. It is _I_ that hold it in _my_\ngrasp, and _you_, too! You were going to make us 'walk the plank.' It is\n_you_ who are going to walk it! Is that the verdict?\" (turning to the four\njurymen).\n\nSome of them nodded, some simply stared at Cosmo, surprised by the\nvehemence of his manner.\n\n\"Enough,\" he said. \"As to you,\" addressing the other prisoners, \"you have\nhad your lesson; see that you don't forget it! Release them, and lead Campo\nto the promenade deck.\"\n\nNobody thought that Cosmo would literally execute his threat to make the\nmutineer walk the plank, but, as he had told Captain Arms, they didn't know\nhim. They were about to see that in Cosmo Vers\u00e1l they had not only a\nprophet, a leader, and a judge, but an inexorable master also.\n\nA plank was prepared and placed sloping from the rail.\n\n\"Walk!\" said Cosmo firmly.\n\nTo everybody's surprise Campo, with blinded eyes, started immediately up\nthe plank, followed its full length with quick, unfaltering step, and\nplunging from the end, disappeared in the sea.\n\nMany had turned away, unable to look, but many also saw the tragedy to the\nend. Then a profound sigh was heard from the whole company of the\nspectators. As they turned away, talking in awed voices, they felt, as\nnever before, that the world had shrunk to the dimensions of the Ark, and\nthat Cosmo Vers\u00e1l was its dictator.\n\nThat same afternoon Cosmo arranged one of his \"conferences,\" and nobody\ndared to be absent, although all minds were yet too much excited to follow\nthe discussions which few could understand. But at length Costak\u00e9 Theriade\nconcentrated their attention by a wild burst of eloquence about the wonders\nof the inter-atomic forces. Sir Athelstone, unable to endure the applause\nthat greeted his rival, abruptly sprang to his feet, his round face red\nwith anger, and shouted:\n\n\"I say, you know, this is twaddle!\"\n\n\"Will the Englishman interrupt not?\" cried Theriade, with his eyes ablaze.\n\"Shall I project not the Sir Englishman to the feeshes?\"\n\nHe looked as if he were about to try to execute his threat, and Sir\nAthelstone assumed a boxing attitude; but before hostilities could begin a\nloud shout from the deck, followed by cries and exclamations, caused\neverybody to rush out of the saloon.\n\nThose who succeeded in getting a glimpse over the shoulders of the members\nof the crew, who were already lined up along the only portion of the\nbulwarks available for seeing the part of the ocean on which attention\nseemed to be fixed, stared open-mouthed at a round-backed mass of shining\nmetal, with a circular aperture on the top, the cover of which was canted\nto one side, and there stood a man, waving a gold-laced red kepi, and\nbowing and smiling with great civility.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nTHE _JULES VERNE_\n\n\nThe swell of the sea caused the strange-looking craft to rise and sink a\nlittle, and sometimes the water ran bubbling all around the low rim of the\naperture, in the center of which the red-capped man stood, resting on some\ninvisible support, repeating his salutations and amicable smiles, and\nbalancing his body to the rocking of the waves with the unconscious\nskill of a sailor.\n\nThe Ark was running slowly, but it would very soon have left the stranger\nin its wake if he had not also been in motion. It was evident that the\nobject under his feet must be a submersible vessel of some kind, although\nit was of a type which Captain Arms, standing beside Cosmo on the bridge,\ndeclared that he had never set eyes on before. It lay so low in the water\nthat nothing could be seen of its motive machinery, but it kept its place\nalongside the Ark with the ease of a dolphin, and gradually edged in closer\nand closer.\n\nWhen it was so near that he could be heard speaking in a voice hardly\nraised above the ordinary pitch, the man, first again lifting his cap with\nan easy gesture, addressed Cosmo Vers\u00e1l by name, using the English language\nwith a scarcely perceptible accent:\n\n\"M. Vers\u00e1l, I offer you my felicitations upon the magnificent appearance of\nyour Ark, and I present my compliments to the ladies and gentlemen of your\ncompany.\"\n\nAnd then he bowed once more to the passengers, who were almost crowding\neach other over the side in their eagerness to both see and hear.\n\n\"Thank you,\" responded Cosmo, \"but who are you?\"\n\n\"Capitaine Yves de Beauxchamps, of the French army.\"\n\n\"Where's the navy, then?\" blurted out Captain Arms.\n\nDe Beauxchamps glanced at the speaker a little disdainfully, and then\nreplied gravely:\n\n\"Alas! At the bottom of the sea--with all the other navies.\"\n\n\"And how have you escaped?\" demanded Cosmo Vers\u00e1l.\n\n\"As you see, in a submersible.\"\n\n\"Can it be possible!\" exclaimed Cosmo. \"And you have been in the sea ever\nsince the beginning of the flood?\"\n\n\"Since the first rise of the ocean on the coast at Brest.\"\n\n\"Have you no companions?\"\n\n\"Six--in truth, seven.\"\n\n\"Astonishing!\" said Cosmo Vers\u00e1l. \"But I heard nothing of the preparation\nof a submersible. In fact, the idea of such a thing never occurred to me.\nYou must have made your preparations secretly.\"\n\n\"We did. We did not share your certainty, M. Vers\u00e1l, concerning the arrival\nof a deluge. Even when we embarked we were not sure that it would be more\nthan an affair of the coasts.\"\n\n\"But you must be on the point of starvation by this time. The flood has\nonly begun. This cessation is but for a time, while we are passing a gap in\nthe nebula. You will come aboard the Ark. I had chosen my company, but your\ngallant escape, and the ability that you have shown, prove that you are\nworthy to aid in the re-establishment of the race, and I have no doubt that\nyour companions are equally worthy.\"\n\nThe Frenchman bowed politely, and with a slight smile replied:\n\n\"I believe, M. Vers\u00e1l, that the _Jules Verne_ is as safe and comfortable,\nand proportionately as well provisioned, as your Ark.\"\n\n\"So you call it the _Jules Verne?_\" returned Cosmo, smiling in his turn.\n\n\"We were proud to give it that name, and its conduct has proved that it is\nworthy of it.\"\n\n\"But you will surely come aboard and shake hands, and let us offer you a\nlittle hospitality,\" said Cosmo.\n\n\"I should be extremely happy to pay my compliments to the ladies,\"\nresponded De Beauxchamps, \"but I must postpone that pleasure for the\npresent. In the meantime, however, I should be glad if you would lower a\nlanding stage, and permit me to send aboard the seventh member of our\nparty, who, I venture to think, may find the Ark a more comfortable abode\nthan our submersible.\"\n\n\"And who may that person be?\"\n\n\"_The King of England._\"\n\nExclamations of surprise and wonder were heard on all sides.\n\n\"Yes,\" resumed the Frenchman, \"we picked up his majesty the first day after\nthe deluge began to descend from the sky.\"\n\n\"I will lower a ladder at once,\" Cosmo called out, and immediately ran down\nto the lowest deck, commanding his men to make haste.\n\nThe _Jules Verne_ was skillfully brought close up to the side of the Ark,\nso that the visible part of her rounded back was nearly in contact with the\nbottom of the companion-ladder when it had been lowered. The sea was so\ncalm that there was little difficulty in executing this maneuver. De\nBeauxchamps disappeared in the depths of the submersible, and after a few\nminutes re-emerged into sight, supporting on his arm a stout, rather short\nman, whose face, it was evident, had once been full and ruddy, but now it\nwas pale and worn.\n\n\"It is he!\" exclaimed an English member of Cosmo's company to some of his\nfellow-countrymen who had forced their way to the front.\n\n_\"It is the king!\"_\n\nAnd then occurred a singular thing, inspired by the marvelous circumstances\nof this meeting of the sovereign of a drowned kingdom, upon the bosom of\nthe waters that had destroyed it, with the mere handful which remained\nalive out of all the millions of his subjects.\n\nThese loyal Englishmen bared their heads (and there were three women among\nthem) and sang, with a pathos that surely the old hymn had never expressed\nbefore, their national anthem: \"God Save the King.\"\n\nThe effect was immense. Every head aboard the Ark was immediately\nuncovered. De Beauxchamps removed his cap, and one or two bared heads could\nbe seen peering out of the interior of the submersible below him. As the\nking was steadied across to the bottom of the companion-ladder, the voices\nof the singers rose louder, and many of the other passengers, moved by\nsympathy, or carried away by epidemic feeling, joined in the singing. Never\nhad any monarch a greeting like that! Its recipient was moved to the depths\nof his soul, and but for the aid given him would have been unable to ascend\nthe swaying steps.\n\nAs he was assisted upon the deck, the song ceased and a great cheer broke\nforth. There were tears in his eyes, and he trembled in every limb, when he\nreturned the welcoming pressure of Cosmo Vers\u00e1l's hand.\n\nThe moment he saw that the king was safely aboard the Ark, De Beauxchamps,\nwith a farewell salutation, disappeared into the interior of the _Jules\nVerne_, and the submersible sank out of sight as gently as if it had been a\nhuge fish that had come to the top of the sea to take a look about.\n\nAfter the sensation caused by the arrival of the English monarch aboard the\nArk had somewhat quieted down, and after his majesty had had an opportunity\nto recover himself, Cosmo Vers\u00e1l invited his new guest to tell the story of\nhis escape. They were seated in Cosmo's cabin, and there were present\nJoseph Smith, Professor Jeremiah Moses, Professor Abel Able, and Amos\nBlank, beside several other members of the ship's company, including two of\nthe loyal Englishmen who quite naturally had been the first to strike up\nthe national anthem on seeing their rescued king.\n\nRichard Edward, or Richard IV as he was officially entitled, was one of the\nbest kings England ever had. He was popular not only because of his almost\ndemocratic manners and the simplicity of his life, but more because he was\na great lover of peace. We have already seen how he was chosen, solely on\nthat account, to be of the number of the rulers invited to go in the Ark.\nHe had not even replied to Cosmo's invitation, but that was simply because,\nlike everybody about him in whom he placed confidence, he regarded Cosmo\nVers\u00e1l as a mere mountebank, and thought that there was no more danger of a\nflood that would cover the earth than of the fall of the moon out of the\nsky.\n\nBefore responding to Cosmo's request he made a gracious reference to the\nindifference with which he had formerly treated his present host.\n\n\"I am sorry, Mr. Vers\u00e1l,\" he said, with a deprecatory smile, \"that I did\nnot sooner recognize the fact that your knowledge surpassed that of my\nscientific advisers.\"\n\n\"Your majesty was not alone,\" replied Cosmo gravely, turning with his\nfinger a small globe that stood on his desk. \"From all these deep-sunken\ncontinents\" (waving his hand toward the globe), \"if the voices once heard\nthere could now speak, there would arise a mighty sound of lament for that\ngreat error.\"\n\nThe king looked at him with an expression of surprise. He glanced from\nCosmo's diminutive figure to his great overhanging brow, marked with the\nlines of thought, and a look of instinctive deference came into his eyes.\n\n\"But,\" continued Cosmo Vers\u00e1l, \"it is bootless to speak of these things\nnow. I beg that your majesty will condescend to enlighten us concerning the\nfate of that great kingdom, of ancient renown, over which you so worthily\nreigned.\"\n\nAn expression of deepest pain passed across the face of Richard Edward. For\nsome moments he remained buried in a mournful silence, and many sighs came\nfrom his breast. All looked at him with profound commiseration. At last he\nraised his head, and said, sorrowfully and brokenly:\n\n\"My kingdom is drowned--my subjects have perished, almost to the last\nsoul--my family, my gracious consort, my children--all, all--gone!\"\n\nHere he broke down, and could speak no more. Not a word was heard, for a\ntime in the room, and the two Englishmen present wept with their\nunfortunate king.\n\nCosmo Vers\u00e1l was no less deeply moved than the others. He sat, for a while,\nin complete silence. Then he arose and, going to the king, put his hand\nupon his shoulder, and talked to him long, in a low, consoling voice. At\nlast the broken-spirited monarch was able to suppress his emotions\nsufficiently to recite, but with many interruptions while he remastered\nhis feelings, the story of his woes and of his marvelous escape.\n\n\"Sir Francis Brook,\" he said, \"prepared a barge, when the water invaded\nLondon, and in that barge we escaped--her royal majesty, our children, and\na number of members of the royal household. The barge was the only vessel\nof levium that existed in England. Sir Francis had furnished and\nprovisioned it well, and we did not think that it would be necessary to go\nfarther than to some high point in the interior. Sir Francis was of the\nopinion that Wales would afford a secure refuge.\n\n\"It was a terrible thing to see the drowning of London, the sweeping of the\nawful bore that came up the Thames from the sea, the shipping wrecked by\nthe tearing waves, the swirl of the fast-rising water round the immense\nbasin in which the city lay, the downfall of the great\nbuildings--Westminster Abbey was one of the first that succumbed--the\noverturned boats, and even great vessels floating on their sides, or\nbottom up, the awful spectacle of the bodies of the drowned tossing in\nthe waves--all these sights were before our horrified eyes while the\nvast eddy swept us round and round until the water rose so high that we\nwere driven off toward the southwest.\n\n\"That we should have escaped at all was a miracle of miracles. It was the\nwonderful buoyancy of the levium barge that saved us. But the terrors of\nthat scene can never fade from my memory. And the fearful sufferings of\nthe queen! And our children--but I _cannot_ go on with this!\"\n\n\"Calm yourself, your majesty,\" said Cosmo sympathetically. \"The whole\nworld has suffered with you. If we are spared and are yet alive, it is\nthrough the hand of Providence--to which all of us must bow.\"\n\n\"We must have passed over Surrey and Hampshire,\" the king resumed, \"the\ninvasion of the sea having buried the hills.\"\n\n\"I am surprised at that,\" said Cosmo. \"I did not think that the sea had\nanywhere attained so great an elevation before the nebula condensed. At\nNew York the complete drowning of the city did not occur until the\ndownpour from the sky began.\"\n\n\"Oh! that deluge from the heavens!\" cried the king. \"What we had suffered\nbefore seemed but little in comparison. It came upon us after night;\nand the absolute darkness, the awful roaring, the terrific force of the\nfalling water, the sense of suffocation, the rapid filling of the barge\nuntil the water was about our necks--these things drove us wild with\ndespair.\n\n\"I tried to sustain my poor queen in my arms, but she struggled to seize\nthe children and hold them above the water, and in her efforts she escaped\nfrom my hands, and henceforth I could find her no more. I stumbled about,\nbut it was impossible to see; it was impossible to hear. At last I fell\nunconscious face downward, as it afterward appeared, upon a kind of bench\nat the rear end of the barge, which was covered with a narrow metallic\nroofing, and raised above the level of the bulwarks. It was there that I\nhad tried to shelter the queen and the children.\n\n\"In some way I must have become lodged there, under the awning, in such a\nposition that the pitching of the barge failed to throw me off. I never\nregained consciousness until I heard a voice shouting in my ear, and felt\nsome one pulling me, and when I had recovered my senses, I found myself in\n the submersible.\"\n\n\"And all your companions were gone?\" asked Cosmo, in a voice shaking with\npity.\n\n\"Yes, oh, Lord! All! They had been swept overboard by the waves--and would\nthat I had gone with them!\"\n\nThe poor king broke down again and sobbed. After a long pause Cosmo asked\ngently:\n\n\"Did the Frenchman tell you how he came upon the barge?\"\n\n\"He said that in rising to the surface to find out the state of things\nthere the submersible came up directly under the barge, canting it in such\na way that I was rolled out and he caught me as I was swept close to the\nopening.\"\n\n\"But how was it that the downpour, entering the submersible, when the cover\nwas removed, did not fill it with water?\"\n\n\"He had the cover so arranged that it served as an almost complete\nprotection from the rain. Some water did enter, but not much.\"\n\n\"A wonderful man, that Frenchman,\" said Cosmo. \"He would be an acquisition\nfor me. What did he say his name was? Oh, yes, De Beauxchamps--I'll make a\nnote of that. I shouldn't wonder if we heard of him again.\"\n\nCosmo Vers\u00e1l was destined to encounter Yves de Beauxchamps and his\nwonderful submersible _Jules Verne_ sooner, and under more dramatic\ncircumstances than he probably anticipated.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nNAVIGATING OVER DROWNED EUROPE\n\n\nAfter the English king had so strangely become a member of its company the\nArk resumed its course in the direction of what had once been Europe. The\nspot where the meeting with the _Jules Verne_ had occurred was west of Cape\nFinisterre and, according to the calculations of Captain Arms, in longitude\nfifteen degrees four minutes west; latitude forty-four degrees nine minutes\nnorth.\n\nCosmo decided to run into the Bay of Biscay, skirting its southern coast in\norder to get a view of the Cantabrian Mountains, many of whose peaks, he\nthought, ought still to lie well above the level of the water.\n\n\"There are the Peaks of Europa,\" said Captain Arms, \"which lie less than\ntwenty miles directly back from the coast. The highest point is eight\nthousand six hundred and seventy feet above sea level, or what used to be\nsea level. We could get near enough to it, without any danger, to see how\nhigh the water goes.\"\n\n\"Do you know the locality?\" demanded Cosmo.\n\n\"As well as I know a compass-card!\" exclaimed the captain. \"I've seen the\nEuropa peaks a hundred times. I was wrecked once on that coast, and being\nof an inquiring disposition, I took the opportunity to go up into the range\nand see the old mines--and a curious sight it was, too. But the most\ncurious sight of all was the shepherdesses of Tresvido, dressed just like\nthe men, in homespun breeches that never wore out. You'd meet 'em anywhere\non the slopes of the Pico del Ferro, cruising about with their flocks. And\nthe cheese that they made! There never was any such cheese!\"\n\n\"Well, if you know the place so well,\" said Cosmo, \"steer for it as fast as\nyou can. I'm curious to find out just how high this flood has gone, up to\nthe present moment.\"\n\n\"Maybe we can rescue a shepherdess,\" returned the captain, chuckling.\n\"She'd be an ornament to your new Garden of Eden.\"\n\nThey kept on until, as they approached longitude five degrees west, they\nbegan to get glimpses of the mountains of northern Spain. The coast was all\nunder deep water, and also the foothills and lower ranges, but some of the\npeaks could be made out far inland. At length, by cautious navigation,\nCaptain Arms got the vessel quite close to the old shore line of the\nAsturias, and then he recognized the Europa peaks.\n\n\"There they are,\" he cried. \"I'd know 'em if they'd emigrated to the middle\nof Africa. There's the old Torre de Cerredo and the Pe\u00f1a Santa.\"\n\n\"How high did you say the main peak is?\" asked Cosmo.\n\n\"She's eight thousand six hundred and seventy feet.\"\n\n\"From your knowledge of the coast, do you think it safe to run in closer?\"\n\n\"Yes, if you're sure the water is not less than two thousand four hundred\nfeet above the old level we can get near enough to see the water-line on\nthe peaks, from the cro'nest, which is two hundred feet high.\"\n\n\"Go ahead, then.\"\n\nThey got closer than they had imagined possible, so close that, from the\nhighest lookout on the Ark, they were able with their telescopes to see\nvery clearly where the water washed the barren mountainsides at what seemed\nto be a stupendous elevation.\n\n\"I'm sorry about your shepherdesses,\" said Cosmo, smiling. \"I don't think\nyou'd find any there to rescue if you could get to them. They must all\nhave been lost in the torrents that poured down those mountains.\"\n\n\"More's the pity,\" said Captain Arms. \"That was a fine lot of women.\nThere'll be no more cheese like what they made at Tresvido.\"\n\nCosmo inquired if the captain's acquaintance with the topography of the\nrange enabled him to say how high that water was. The captain, after long\ninspection, declared that he felt sure that it was not less than four\nthousand feet above the old coast line.\n\n\"Then,\" said Cosmo, \"if you're right about the elevation of what you call\nthe Torre de Cerredo there must be four thousand six hundred and seventy\nfeet of its upper part still out of water. We'll see if that is so.\"\n\nCosmo made the measurements with instruments, and announced that the result\nshowed the substantial accuracy of Captain Arms's guess.\n\n\"I suspected as much,\" he muttered. \"Those tremendous downpours, which may\nhave been worse elsewhere than where we encountered them, have increased\nthe rise nearly seventy per cent, above what my gages indicated. Now that I\nknow this,\" he continued, addressing the captain: \"I'll change the course\nof the Ark. I'm anxious to get into the Indian Ocean as soon as possible.\nIt would be a great waste of time to go back in order to cross the Sahara,\nand with this increase of level it isn't necessary. We'll just set out\nacross southern France, keeping along north of the Pyrenees, and so down\ninto the region of the Mediterranean.\"\n\nCaptain Arms was astonished by the boldness of this suggestion, and at\nfirst he strongly objected to their taking such a course.\n\n\"There's some pretty high ground in southern France,\" he said. \"There's the\nCevennes Mountains, which approach a good long way toward the Pyrenees. Are\nyou sure the depth of water is the same everywhere?\"\n\n\"What a question for an old mariner to ask!\" returned Cosmo. \"Don't you\nknow that the level of the sea is the same everywhere? The flood doesn't\nmake any difference. It seeks its level like any other water.\"\n\n\"But it may be risky steering between those mountains,\" persisted the\ncaptain.\n\n\"Nonsense! As long as the sky is clear you can get good observations, and\nyou ought to be navigator enough not to run on a mountain.\"\n\nCosmo Vers\u00e1l, as usual, was unalterable in his resolution--he only changed\nwhen he had reasons of his own--and the course of the Ark was laid,\naccordingly, for the old French coast of the Landes, so low that it was now\ncovered with nearly four thousand feet of water. The feelings of the\npassengers were deeply stirred when they learned that they were actually\nsailing over buried Europe, and they gazed in astonishment at the water\nbeneath them, peering down into it as if they sought to discover the\ndreadful secrets that it hid, and talking excitedly in a dozen languages.\n\nThe Ark progressed slowly, making not more than five or six knots, and on\nthe second day after they dropped the Pe\u00f1as de Europa they were passing\nalong the northern flank of the Pyrenees and over the basin in which had\nlain the beautiful city of Pau. The view of the Pyrenees from this point\nhad always been celebrated before the deluge as one of the most remarkable\nin the world.\n\nNow it had lost its beauty, but gained in spectacular grandeur. All of\nFrance, as far as the eye extended, was a sea, with long oceanic swells\nslowly undulating its surface. This sea abruptly came to an end where it\nmet the mountains, which formed for it a coast unlike any that the hundreds\nof eyes which wonderingly surveyed it from the Ark had ever beheld.\n\nBeyond the drowned vales and submerged ranges, which they knew lay beneath\nthe watery floor, before them, rose the heads of the Pic du Midi, the Pic\nde Ger, the Pic de Bigorre, the Massif du Gabizos, the Pic Monn\u00e9, and\ndozens of other famous eminences, towering in broken ranks like the\nbearskins of a \"forlorn hope,\" resisting to the last, in pictures of\nold-time battles.\n\nHere, owing to the configuration of the drowned land it was possible for\nthe Ark to approach quite close to some of the wading mountains, and Cosmo\nseized the opportunity to make a new measure of the height of the flood,\nwhich he found to be surely not less than his former estimates had shown.\n\nSurveying with telescopes the immense shoulders of the Monn\u00e9, the Viscos,\nthe d'Ardiden, and the nearer heights, when they were floating above the\nvalley of Lourdes, Cosmo and the captain saw the terrible effects that had\nbeen produced by the torrents of rain, which had stripped off the\nvegetation whose green robe had been the glory of the high Pyrenees on the\nFrench side.\n\nPresently their attention was arrested by some moving objects, and at a\nsecond glance they perceived that these were human beings.\n\n\"Good Heaven!\" exclaimed Cosmo Vers\u00e1l. \"There are survivors here. They have\nclimbed the mountains, and found shelter among the rocks. I should not have\nthought it possible.\"\n\n\"And there are women among them,\" said Captain Arms, lowering his\ntelescope. \"You will not leave them there!\"\n\n\"But what can I do?\"\n\n\"Lower away the boats,\" replied the captain. \"We've got plenty of them.\"\n\n\"There may be thousands there,\" returned Cosmo, musing. \"I can't take them\nall.\"\n\n\"Then take as many as you can. By gad, sir, _I'll_ not leave 'em!\"\n\nBy this time some of the passengers who had powerful glasses had discovered\nthe refugees on the distant heights, and great excitement spread throughout\nthe Ark. Cries arose from all parts of the vessel:\n\n\"Rescue them!\" \"Go to their aid!\" \"Don't let them perish!\"\n\nCosmo Vers\u00e1l was in a terrible quandary. He was by no means without\nhumanity, and was capable of deep and sympathetic feeling, as we have seen,\nbut he already had as many persons in the Ark as he thought ought to be\ntaken, considering the provision that had been made, and, besides, he could\nnot throw off, at once, his original conviction of the necessity of\ncarefully choosing his companions. He remained for a long time buried in\nthought, while the captain fumed with impatience and at last declared that\nif Cosmo did not give the order to lower away the boats he would do it\nhimself.\n\nAt length Cosmo, yielding rather to his own humane feelings than to the\nurging of others, consented to make the experiment. Half a dozen levium\nlaunches were quickly lowered and sent off, while the Ark, with slowed\nengines, remained describing a circle as near the mountains as it was safe\nto go. Cosmo himself embarked in the leading boat.\n\nThe powerful motors of the launches carried them rapidly to the high slopes\nwhere the unfortunates had sought refuge, and as they approached, and the\npoor fugitives saw that deliverance was at hand, they began to shout, and\ncheer, and cry, and many of them fell on their knees upon the rocks and\nstretched their hands toward the heavens.\n\nThe launches were compelled to move with great caution when they got near\nthe ragged sides of the submerged mountains (it was the Peyre Dufau on\nwhich the people had taken refuge), but the men aboard them were determined\nto effect the rescue, and they regarded no peril too closely. At last\nCosmo's launch found a safe landing, and the others quickly followed it.\n\nWhen Cosmo sprang out on a flat rock a crowd of men, women, and children,\nweeping, crying, sobbing, and uttering prayers and blessings, instantly\nsurrounded him. Some wrung his hands in an ecstasy of joy, some embraced\nhim, some dropped on their knees before him and sought to kiss his hands.\nCosmo could not restrain his tears, and the crews of the launches were\nequally affected.\n\nMany of these people could only speak the patois of the mountains, but some\nwere refugees from the resorts in the valleys below, and among these were\ntwo English tourists who had been caught among the mountains by the sudden\nrising of the flood. They exhibited comparative _sang froid_, and served as\nspokesmen for the others.\n\n\"Bah Jove!\" exclaimed one of them, \"but you're welcome, you know! This has\nbeen a demnition close call! But what kind of a craft have you got out\nthere?\"\n\n\"I'm Cosmo Vers\u00e1l.\"\n\n\"Then that's the Ark we've heard about! 'Pon honor, I should have\nrecognized you, for I've seen your picture often enough. You've come to\ntake us off, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" replied Cosmo. \"How many are there?\"\n\n\"All that you see here; about a hundred, I should say. No doubt there are\nothers on the mountains round. There must have been a thousand of us when\nwe started, but most of them perished, overcome by the downpour, or swept\naway by the torrents. Lord Swansdown (indicating his companion, who bowed\ngravely and stiffly) and myself--I'm Edward Whistlington--set out to walk\nover the Pyrenees from end to end, after the excitement about the great\ndarkness died out, and we got as far as the Marbor\u00e9, and then running down\nto Gavarnie we heard news of the sea rising, but we didn't give too much\ncredit to that, and afterward, keeping up in the heights, we didn't hear\neven a rumor from the world below.\n\n\"The sky opened on us like a broadside from an aerial squadron, and how we\never managed to get here I'm sure I can hardly tell. We were actually\n_carried_ down the mountainsides by the water, and how it failed to drown\nus will be an everlasting mystery. Somehow, we found ourselves among these\npeople, who were trying to go _up_, assuring us that there was nothing\nbut water below. And at last we discovered some sort of shelter here--and\nhere we've been ever since.\"\n\n\"You cannot have had much to eat,\" said Cosmo.\n\n\"Not _too_ much, I assure you,\" replied the Englishman, with a melancholy\nsmile. \"But these people shared with us what little they had, or could\nfind--anything and everything that was eatable. They're a devilish fine\nlot, I tell you!\n\n\"When the terrible rain suddenly ceased and the sky cleared,\" he resumed,\n\"we managed to get dry, after a day or two, and since then we've been\nchewing leather until there isn't a shoe or a belt left. We thought at\nfirst of trying to build rafts--but then where could we go? It wasn't any\nuse to sail out over a drowned country, with nothing in sight but the\nmountains around us, which looked no better than the one we were barely\nexisting on.\"\n\n\"Then I must get you aboard the Ark before you starve,\" said Cosmo.\n\n\"Many have died of starvation already,\" returned Whistlington. \"You can't\nget us off a moment too quick.\"\n\nCosmo Vers\u00e1l had by this time freed himself of every trace of the\nreluctance which he had at first felt to increasing the size of his ship's\ncompany by adding recruits picked up at random. His sympathies were\nthoroughly aroused, and while he hastened the loading and departure of the\nlaunches, he asked the Englishmen who, with the impassive endurance of\ntheir race, stayed behind to the last, whether they thought that there were\nother refugees on the mountains whom they could reach.\n\n\"I dare say there are thousands of the poor devils on these peaks around\nus, wandering among the rocks,\" replied Edward Whistlington, \"but I fancy\nyou couldn't reach 'em.\"\n\n\"If I see any I'll try,\" returned Cosmo, sweeping with his powerful\ntelescope all the mountain flanks within view.\n\nAt last, on the slopes of the lofty Mont Aigu across the submerged valley\ntoward the south, he caught sight of several human figures, one of which\nwas plainly trying to make signals, probably to attract attention from the\nArk. Immediately, with the Englishmen and the remainder of those who had\nbeen found on the Peyre Dufau, he hastened in his launch to the rescue.\n\nThey found four men and three women, who had escaped from the narrow valley\ncontaining the _bains de Gazost_, and who were in the last stages of\nstarvation. These were taken aboard, and then, no more being in sight,\nCosmo returned to the Ark, where the other launches had already arrived.\n\nAnd these were the last that were rescued from the mighty range of the\nPyrenees, in whose deep valleys had lain the famous resorts of Cauterets,\nthe Eaux Bonnes, the Eaux Chaudes, the Bagni\u00e8res de Luchon, the Bagni\u00e8res\nde Bigorre, and a score of others. No doubt, as the Englishmen had said,\nthousands had managed to climb the mountains, but none could now be seen,\nand those who may have been there were left to perish.\n\nThere was great excitement in the Ark on the arrival of the refugees. The\npassengers overwhelmed them with kind attentions, and when they had\nsufficiently recovered, listened with wonder and the deepest sympathy to\ntheir exciting tales of suffering and terror.\n\nLord Swansdown and Edward Whistlington were amazed to find their king\naboard the Ark, and the English members of the company soon formed a sort\nof family party, presided over by the unfortunate monarch. The rescued\npersons numbered, in all, one hundred and six.\n\nThe voyage of the Ark was now resumed, skirting the Pyrenees, but at an\nincreasing distance. Finally Captain Arms announced that, according to his\nobservations, they were passing over the site of the ancient and populous\ncity of Toulouse. This recalled to Cosmo Vers\u00e1l's memory the beautiful\nscenes of the fair and rich land that lay so deep under the Ark, and he\nbegan to talk with the captain about the glories of its history.\n\nHe spoke of the last great conqueror that the world had known, Napoleon,\nand was discussing his marvelous career, and referring to the fact that he\nhad died on a rock in the midst of that very ocean which had now swallowed\nup all the scenes of his conquests, when the lookout telephoned down that\nthere was something visible on the water ahead.\n\nIn a little while they saw it--a small moving object, which rapidly\napproached the Ark. As it drew nearer both exclaimed at once:\n\n\"The _Jules Verne!_\"\n\nThere could be no mistaking it. It was riding with its back just above the\nlevel of the sea; the French flag was fluttering from a small mast, and\nalready they could perceive the form of De Beauxchamps, standing in his old\nattitude, with his feet below the rim of the circular opening at the top.\nCosmo ordered the Stars and Stripes to be displayed in salute, and, greatly\npleased over the encounter, hurried below and had the companion-ladder made\nready.\n\n\"He's got to come aboard this time, anyhow!\" he exclaimed. \"I'll take no\nrefusal. I want to know that fellow better.\"\n\nBut this time De Beauxchamps had no thought of refusing the hospitalities\nof the Ark. As soon as he was within hearing he called out:\n\n\"My salutations to M. Vers\u00e1l and his charming fellow-voyagers. May I be\npermitted to come aboard and present myself in person? I have something\ndeeply interesting to tell.\"\n\nEverybody in the Ark who could find a standing-place was watching the\n_Jules Verne_ and trying to catch a glimpse of its gallant captain, and to\nhear what he said; and the moment his request was preferred a babel of\nvoices arose, amid which could be distinguished such exclamations as:\n\n\"Let him come!\" \"A fine fellow!\" \"Welcome, De Beauxchamps!\" \"Hurrah for the\n_Jules Verne!_\"\n\nKing Richard was in the fore rank of the spectators, waving his hand to his\npreserver.\n\n\"Certainly you can come aboard,\" cried Cosmo heartily, at the same time\nhastening the preparations for lowering the ladder. \"We are all glad to see\nyou. And bring your companions along with you.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nTO PARIS UNDER THE SEA\n\n\nDe Beauxchamps accepted Cosmo Vers\u00e1l's invitation to bring his\ncompanions with him into the Ark. The submersible was safely moored\nalongside, where she rode easily in company with the larger vessel, and\nall mounted the companion-ladder. The Frenchman's six companions were\ndressed, like himself, in the uniform of the army.\n\n\"Curious,\" muttered Captain Arms in Cosmo's ear, \"that these _soldiers_\nshould be the only ones to get off--and in a vessel, too. What were the\nseamen about?\"\n\n\"What were _our_ seamen about?\" returned Cosmo. \"How many of _them_ got\noff? I warned them that ships would not do. But it was a bright idea of\nthis De Beauxchamps and his friends to build a submersible. It didn't\noccur to me, or I would have advised their construction everywhere for\nsmall parties. But it would never have done for us. A submersible would\nnot have been capacious enough for the party I wanted to take.\"\n\nBy this time the visitors were aboard, and Cosmo and the others who\ncould get near enough to grasp them by the hand greeted them effusively.\nKing Richard received De Beauxchamps with emotion, and thanked him again\nand again for having saved his life; but, in the end, he covered his\nface and said in a broken voice:\n\n\"M. De Beauxchamps, my gratitude to you is very deep--but, oh, the\nqueen--the queen--and the children! I should have done better to perish\nwith them.\"\n\nCosmo and De Beauxchamps soothed him as well as they could, and the\nformer led the way into the grand saloon, in order that as many as\npossible might see and greet their visitors, who had come so\nmysteriously up out of the sea.\n\nAll of the Frenchmen were as affable as their leader, and he presented\nthem in turn. De Beauxchamps conversed almost gaily with such of the\nladies as had sufficient command of their feelings to join the throng\nthat pressed about him and his companions. He was deeply touched by the\nstory of the recent rescue of his countrymen from the Pyrenees, and he\nwent among them, trying to cheer them up, with the _\u00e9lan_ that no\nmisfortune can eradicate from the Gallic nature.\n\nAt length Cosmo reminded him that he had said that he had some\ninteresting news to communicate.\n\n\"Yes,\" said De Beauxchamps, \"I have just come from a visit to Paris.\"\n\nExclamations of amazement and incredulity were heard on all sides.\n\n\"It is true,\" resumed the Frenchman, though now his voice lost all its\ngayety. \"I had conceived the project of such a visit before I met the\nArk and transferred His Majesty, the King of England, to your care. As\nsoon as that was done I set out to make the attempt.\"\n\n\"But tell me first,\" interrupted Cosmo, \"how you succeeded in finding\nthe Ark again.\"\n\n\"That was not very difficult,\" replied De Beauxchamps, smiling. \"Of\ncourse, it was to some extent accidental, for I didn't _know_ that you\nwould be here, navigating over France; but I had an idea that you\n_might_ come this way if you had an intention of seeing what had\nhappened to Europe. It is my regular custom to rise frequently to the\nsurface to take a look around and make sure of my bearings, and you know\nthat the Ark makes a pretty large point on the waters. I saw it long\nbefore you caught sight of me.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Cosmo. \"Please go on with your story. It must, indeed,\nbe an extraordinary one.\"\n\n\"I was particularly desirous of seeing Paris again, deep as I knew her\nto lie under the waves,\" resumed De Beauxchamps, \"because it was my\nhome, and I had a house in the Champs Elys\u00e9es. You cannot divorce the\nheart of a Frenchman from his home, though you should bury it under\ntwenty oceans.\"\n\n\"Your family were lost?\"\n\n\"Thank God, I had no family. If I had had they would be with me. My\ncompanions are all like myself in that respect. We have lost many\nfriends, but no near relatives. As I was saying, I started for France,\npoor drowned France, as soon as I left you. With the powerful\nsearchlight of the _Jules Verne_ I could feel confident of avoiding\nobstructions; and, besides, I knew very closely the height to which the\nflood had risen, and having the topography of my country at my fingers'\nends, as does every officer of the army, I was able to calculate the\ndepth at which we should run in order to avoid the hilltops.\"\n\n\"But surely,\" said Cosmo, \"it is impossible--at least, it seems so to\nme--that you can descend to any great depth--the pressure must be\ntremendous a few hundred feet down, to say nothing of possible\nthousands.\"\n\n\"All that,\" replied the Frenchman, \"has been provided for. You probably\ndo not know to what extent we had carried experiments in France on the\ndeep submersion of submarines before their general abandonment when they\nwere prohibited by international agreement in war. I was myself perhaps\nthe leader in those investigations, and in the construction of the\n_Jules Verne_ I took pains to improve on all that had hitherto been\ndone.\n\n\"Without going into any description of my devices, I may simply remind\nyou nature has pointed out ways of avoiding the consequences of the\ninconceivable pressures which calculation indicates at depths of a\nkilometer, or more, in her construction of the deep-sea fishes. It was\nby a study of them that I arrived at the secret of both penetrating to\ndepths that would theoretically have seemed entirely impossible and of\nremaining at such depths.\"\n\n\"Marvelous!\" exclaimed Cosmo; \"marvelous beyond belief!\"\n\n\"I may add,\" continued De Beauxchamps, smiling at the effect that his\nwords had had upon the mind of the renowned Cosmo Vers\u00e1l, \"that the\npeculiar properties of levium, which you so wisely chose for your Ark,\naided _me_ in quite a different way. But I must return to my story.\n\n\"We passed over the coast of France near the point where I knew lay the\nmouth of the Loire. I could have found my way by means of the compass\nsufficiently well; but since the sky was clear I frequently came to the\nsurface in order, for greater certainty, to obtain sights of the sun and\nstars.\n\n\"I dropped down at Tours and at Blois, and we plainly saw the walls of\nthe old ch\u00e2teaux in the gleam of the searchlight below us. There were\nmonsters of the deep, such as the eye of man never beheld, swimming\nslowly about them, many of them throwing a strange luminosity into the\nwater from their phosphorescent organs, as if they were inspecting these\nnovelties of the sea-bottom.\n\n\"Arrived over Orleans, we turned in the direction of Paris. As we\napproached the site of the city I sank the submersible until we almost\ntouched the higher hills. My searchlight is so arranged that it can be\ndirected almost every way--up, down, to this side, and to that--and we\nswept it round us in every direction.\n\n\"The light readily penetrated the water and revealed sights which I have\nno power to describe, and some--reminders of the immense population of\nhuman beings which had there met its end--which I would not describe if\nI could. To see a drowned face suddenly appear outside the window,\nalmost within touch--ah, that was too horrible!\n\n\"We passed over Versailles, with the old palace still almost intact;\nover S\u00e8vres, with its porcelain manufactory yet in part standing--the\ntidal waves that had come up the river from the sea evidently caused\nmuch destruction just before the downpour began--and finally we\n'entered' Paris.\n\n\"We could see the embankments of the Seine beneath us as we passed up\nits course from the Point du Jour. From the site of the Champ de Mars I\nturned northward in search of the older part of the Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es,\nwhere my house was, and we came upon the great Arc de Triomphe, which,\nyou remember, dates from the time of Napoleon.\n\n\"It was apparently uninjured, even the huge bronze groups remaining in\ntheir places, and the searchlight, traversing its face, fell upon the\nheroic group on the east fa\u00e7ade of the Marseillaise. You must have seen\nthat, M. Vers\u00e1l?\"\n\n\"Yes, many a time,\" Cosmo replied. \"The fury in the face of the female\nfigure representing the spirit of war, chanting the 'Marseillaise,' and,\nsword in hand, sweeping over the heads of the soldiers, is the most\nterrible thing of human making that I ever looked upon.\"\n\n\"It was not so terrible as another thing that our startled eyes beheld\nthere,\" said De Beauxchamps. \"Coiled round the upper part of the arch,\nwith its head resting directly upon that of the figure of which you\nspeak, was a monstrous, ribbon-shaped creature, whose flat, reddish\nbody, at least a meter in width and apparently thirty meters long, and\nbordered with a sort of floating frill of a pinkish color, undulated\nwith a motion that turned us sick at heart.\n\n\"But the head was the most awful object that the fancy of a madman could\nconceive. There were two great round, projecting eyes, encircled with\nwhat I suppose must have been phosphorescent organs, which spread around\nin the water a green light that was absolutely horrifying.\n\n\"I turned away the searchlight, and the eyes of that creature stared\nstraight at us with a dreadful, stony look; and then the effect of the\nphosphorescence, heightened by the absence of the greater light, became\nmore terrible than before. We were unmanned, and I hardly had nerve\nenough to turn the submersible away and hurry from the neighborhood.\"\n\n\"I had not supposed,\" said Cosmo, \"that creatures of such a size could\nlive in the deeper parts of the sea.\"\n\n\"I know,\" returned De Beauxchamps, \"that many have thought that the\nabysmal creatures were generally of small size, but they knew nothing\nabout it. What could one have expected to learn of the secrets of life\nin the ocean depths from the small creatures which alone the trawls\nbrought to the surface? The great monsters could not be captured in that\nway. But we have _seen_ them--seen them taking possession of beautiful,\ndrowned Paris--and we know what they are.\"\n\nThe fascinated hearers who had crowded about to listen to the narrative\nof De Beauxchamps shuddered at this part of it, and some of the women\nturned away with exclamations of horror.\n\n\"I see that I am drawing my picture in too fearful colors,\" he said,\n\"and I shall refrain from telling of the other inhabitants of the abyss\nthat we found in possession of what I, as a Frenchman, must call the\nmost splendid capital that the world contained.\n\n\"Oh, to think that all that beauty, all those great palaces filled with\nthe master-works of art, all those proud architectural piles, all that\nscene of the most joyous life that the earth contained, is now become\nthe dwelling-place of the terrible _fauna_ of the deep, creatures that\nnever saw the sun; that never felt the transforming force of the\nevolution which had made the face of the globe so glorious; that never\nquitted their abysmal homes until this awful flood spread their empire\nover the whole earth!\"\n\nThere was a period of profound silence while De Beauxchamps's face\nworked spasmodically under the influence of emotions, the sight of which\nwould alone have sufficed to convince his hearers of the truth of what\nhe had been telling. Finally Cosmo Vers\u00e1l, breaking the silence, asked:\n\n\"Did you find your home?\"\n\n\"Yes. It was there. I found it out. I illuminated it with the\nsearchlight. I gazed into the broken windows, trying to peer through the\nwatery medium that filled and darkened the interior. The roof was\nbroken, but the walls were intact. I thought of the happy, happy years\nthat I had passed there when I _had_ a family, and when Paris was an\nEden, the sunshine of the world. And then I wished to see no more, and\nwe rose out of the midst of that sunken city and sought the daylight far\nabove.\n\n\"I had thought to tell you,\" he continued, after a pause, \"of the\ncondition in which we found the great monuments of the city--of the\nPantheon, yet standing on its hill with its roof crushed in; of N\u00f4tre\nDame--a wreck, but the towers still standing proudly; of the old palace\nof the Louvre, through whose broken roofs and walls we caught glimpses\nof the treasures washed by the water within--but I find that I have not\ncourage to go on. I had imagined that it would be a relief to speak of\nthese things, but I do not find it so.\"\n\n\"After leaving Paris, then you made no other explorations?\" said Cosmo.\n\n\"None. I should have had no heart for more. I had seen enough. And yet I\ndo not regret that I went there. I should never have been content not to\nhave seen my beautiful city once more, even lying in her watery shroud.\nI loved her living; I have seen her dead. It is finished. What more is\nthere, M. Vers\u00e1l?\" With a sudden change of manner: \"You have predicted\nall this, and perhaps you know more. Where do _we_ go to die?\"\n\n\"We shall _not_ die,\" replied Cosmo Vers\u00e1l forcefully. \"The Ark and your\n_Jules Verne_ will save us.\"\n\n\"To what purpose?\" demanded the Frenchman, his animation all gone. \"Can\nthere be any pleasure in floating upon or beneath the waves that cover a\nlost world? Is a brief prolongation of such a life worth the effort of\ngrasping for?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Cosmo with still greater energy. \"We may still _save the\nrace_. I have chosen most of my companions in the Ark for that purpose.\nNot only may we save the race of man, but we may lead it up upon a\nhigher plane; we may apply the principles of eugenics as they have never\nyet been applied. You, M. De Beauxchamps, have shown that you are of the\nstock that is required for the regeneration of the world.\"\n\n\"But where can the world be regenerated?\" asked De Beauxchamps with a\nbitter laugh. \"There is nothing left but mountain-tops.\"\n\n\"Even they will be covered,\" said Cosmo.\n\n\"Do you mean that the deluge has not yet reached its height?\"\n\n\"Certainly it has not. We are in an open space in the enveloping nebula.\nAfter a little we shall enter the nucleus, and then will come the\nworst.\"\n\n\"And yet you talk of saving the race!\" exclaimed the Frenchman with\nanother bitter laugh.\n\n\"I do,\" replied Cosmo, \"and it will be done.\"\n\n\"But how?\"\n\n\"Through the re-emergence of land.\"\n\n\"That recalls our former conversation,\" put in Professor Abel Able. \"It\nappears to me impossible that, when the earth is once covered with a\nuniversal ocean, it can ever disappear or materially lower its level.\nGeological ages would be required for the level of the water to be\nlowered even a few feet by the escape of vapor into space.\"\n\n\"No,\" returned Cosmo Vers\u00e1l, \"I have demonstrated that that idea is\nwrong. Under the immense pressure of an ocean rising six miles above the\nancient sea level the water will rapidly be forced into the interstices\nof the crust, and thus a material reduction of level will be produced\nwithin a few years--five at the most. That will give us a foothold. I\nhave no doubt that even now the water around us is slightly lowering\nthrough that cause.\n\n\"But in itself that will not be sufficient. I have gone all over this\nground in my original calculations. The intrusion of the immense mass of\nocean water into the interior of the crust of the earth will result in a\ngrand geological upheaval. The lands will re-emerge above the new sea\nlevel as they emerged above the former one through the internal stresses\nof the globe.\"\n\nThe scientific men present listened with breathless interest, but some\nof them with many incredulous shakings of the head.\n\n\"You must be aware,\" continued Cosmo, addressing them particularly,\n\"that it has been demonstrated that the continents and the great\nmountain ranges are buoyed up, and, as it were, are floating somewhat\nlike slags on the internal magma. The mean density of the crust is less\nunder the land and the mountains than under the old sea-beds. This is\nespecially true of the Himalayan region.\n\n\"That uplift is probably the most recent of all, and it is there, where\nat present the highest land of the globe exists, that I expect that the\nnew upheaval will be most strongly manifested. It is for that reason,\nand not merely because it is now the highest part of the earth, that I\nam going with the Ark to Asia.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Professor Jeremiah Moses, \"the upheaval of which you speak\nmay produce a complete revolution in the surface of the earth, and if\nnew lands are upthrust they may appear at unexpected points.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" returned Cosmo. \"The tectonic features of the globe were\nfixed at the beginning. As Asia has hitherto been the highest and the\ngreatest mass of land, it will continue to be so in the future. It is\nthere, believe me, that we shall replant the seed of humanity.\"\n\n\"Do you not think,\" asked Professor Alexander Jones, \"that there will be\na tremendous outburst of volcanic energy, if such upheavals occur, and\nmay not that render the re-emerging lands uninhabitable?\"\n\n\"No doubt,\" Cosmo replied, \"every form of plutonic energy will be\nimmensely re-enforced. You remember the recent outburst of all the\nvolcanoes when the sea burst over the borders of the continents. But\nthese forces will be mainly expended in an effort of uplifting.\nUnquestionably there will be great volcanic spasms, but they will not\nprevent the occupation of the broadening areas of land which will not be\nthus affected.\"\n\n\"Upon these lands,\" exclaimed Sir Wilfrid Athelstone, in a loud voice,\n\"I will develop life from the barren minerals of the crust. The age of\nchemical parthenogenesis will then have dawned upon the earth, and man\nwill have become a creator.\"\n\n\"Will the Sir Englishman give me room for a word!\" cried Costak\u00e9\nTheriade, raising his tall form on his toes and agitating his arms in\nthe air. \"He will create not anything! It is _I_ that will unloose the\nenergies of the atoms of matter and make of the new man a new god.\"\n\nCosmo Vers\u00e1l quieted the incipient outbreak of his jealous \"speculative\ngeniuses,\" and the discussion of his theory was continued for some time.\nAt length De Beauxchamps, shrugging his shoulders, exclaimed, with a\nreturn of his habitual gayety:\n\n\"_Tr\u00e8s bien! Vive_ the world of Cosmo Vers\u00e1l! I salute the new Eve that\nis to come!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nTHE ADVENTURES IN COLORADO\n\n\nWhen Professor Pludder, the President, and their companions on the\naero-raft, saw the three men on the bluff motioning and shouting to\nthem, they immediately sought the means of bringing their craft to land.\nThis did not prove to be exceedingly difficult, for there was a\nconvenient rock with deep water around it on which they could disembark.\n\nThe men ran down to meet them, and to help them ashore, exhibiting the\nutmost astonishment at seeing them there.\n\n\"Whar in creation did _you_ come from?\" exclaimed one, giving the\nprofessor a pull up the bank. \"Mebbe you're Cosmo Vers\u00e1l, and that's yer\nArk.\"\n\n\"I'm Professor Pludder, and this is the President of the United States.\"\n\n\"The President of the Un----See here, stranger, I'll take considerable\nfrom you, considering the fix yer in, but you don't want to go too far.\"\n\n\"It's true,\" asseverated the professor. \"This gentleman is the\nPresident, and we've escaped from Washington. Please help the ladies.\"\n\n\"I'll help the ladies all right, but I'm blamed if I believe yer yarn.\nHow'd you git here? You couldn't hev floated across the continent on\nthat thing.\"\n\n\"We came on the raft that you see,\" interrupted Mr. Samson. \"We left the\nAppalachian Mountains two weeks ago.\"\n\n\"Well, by--it must be true!\" muttered the man. \"They couldn't hev come\nfrom anywhar else in that direction. I reckon the hull blamed continent\nis under water.\"\n\n\"So it is,\" said Professor Pludder, \"and we made for Colorado, knowing\nthat it was the only land left above the flood.\"\n\nAll finally got upon the bluff, rejoiced to feel solid ground once more\nbeneath their feet. But it was a desolate prospect that they saw before\nthem. The face of the land had been scoured and gullied by the pouring\nwaters, the vegetation had been stripped off, except where in hollows it\nhad been covered with new-formed lakes, some of which had drained off\nafter the downpour ceased, the water finding its way into the enveloping\nsea.\n\nThey asked the three men what had become of the other inhabitants, and\nwhether there was any shelter at hand.\n\n\"We've be'n wiped out,\" said the original spokesman. \"Cosmo Vers\u00e1l has\ndone a pretty clean job with his flood. There's a kind of a cover that\nwe three hev built, a ways back yonder, out o' timber o' one kind and\nanother that was lodged about. But it wouldn't amount to much if there\nwas another cloudburst. It wouldn't stand a minute. It's good to sleep\nin.\"\n\n\"Are you the only survivors in this region?\" asked the President.\n\n\"I reckon you see all thet's left of us. The' ain't one out o' a hundred\nthat's left alive in these parts.\"\n\n\"What became of them?\"\n\n\"Swept off!\" replied the man, with an expressive gesture--\"and drownded\nright out under the sky.\"\n\n\"And how did you and your companions escape?\"\n\n\"By gitting up amongst some rocks that was higher'n the average.\"\n\n\"How did you manage to live--what did you have to eat?\"\n\n\"We didn't eat much--we didn't hev much time to think o' eatin'. We had\none hoss with us, and he served, when his time come. After the sky\ncleared we skirmished about and dug up something that we could manage to\neat, lodged in gullies where the water had washed together what had been\nin houses and cellars. We've got a gun and a little ammunition, and once\nin a while we could kill an animal that had contrived to escape\nsomehow.\"\n\n\"And you think that there are no other human beings left alive anywhere\naround here?\"\n\n\"I _know_ th' ain't. The's probably some up in the foothills, and around\nthe Pike. They had a better chance to git among rocks. We hed jest made\nup our minds to go hunting for 'em when we ketched sight o' you, and\nthen we concluded to stay and see who you was.\"\n\n\"I'm surprised that you didn't go sooner.\"\n\n\"We couldn't. There was a roarin' torrent coming down from the mountains\nthat cut us off. It's only last night that it stopped.\"\n\n\"Well, it's evident that we cannot stay here,\" said Professor Pludder.\n\"We must go with these men toward the mountains. Let us take what's left\nof the compressed provisions out of the raft, and then we'll eat a good\nmeal and be off.\"\n\nThe three men were invited to share the repast, and they ate with an\nappetite that would have amused their hosts if they had not been so\nanxious to reserve as much as possible of their provisions for future\nnecessities.\n\nThe meal finished, they started off, their new friends aiding to carry\nprovisions, and what little extra clothing there was. The aspect of the\ncountry they traversed affrighted them. Here and there were partially\ndemolished houses or farm structures, or cellars, choked with d\u00e9bris of\nwhat had once been houses.\n\nFarm implements and machinery were scattered about and half buried in\nthe torrent-furrowed land. In the wreck of one considerable village\nthrough which they passed they found a stone church, and several stone\nhouses of considerable pretensions, standing almost intact as to walls,\nbut with roofs, doors, and windows smashed and torn off.\n\nIt was evident that this place, which lay in a depression of the land,\nhad been buried by the rushing water as high as high as the top stories\nof the buildings. From some of the sights that they saw they shrank\naway, and afterward tried to forget them.\n\nOwing to the presence of the women and children their progress was\nslower than it might overwise have been. They had great difficulty in\ncrossing the course of the torrent which their companions had described\nas cutting them off from the foothills of the Pike's Peak range.\n\nThe water had washed out a veritable ca\u00f1on, a hundred or more feet deep\nin places, and with ragged, precipitous walls and banks, which they had\nto descend on one side and ascend on the other. Here the skill and local\nknowledge of their three new-found friends stood them in good stead.\nThere was yet enough water in the bottom of the great gully to compel\nthem to wade, carrying the women and children.\n\nBut, just before nightfall, they succeeded in reaching a range of rocky\nheights, where they determined to pass the night. They managed to make a\nfire with brush that had been swept down the mountain flanks and had\nremained wedged in the rocks, and thus they dried their soaked garments,\nand were able to do some cooking, and to have a blaze to give them a\nlittle heat during the night, for the air turned cold after the\ndisappearance of the sun.\n\nWhen the others had sunk into an uneasy slumber, the President and\nProfessor Pludder sat long, replenishing the fire, and talking of what\nwould be their future course.\n\n\"I think,\" said the professor, \"that we shall find a considerable\npopulation alive among the mountains. There is nothing in Colorado below\nfour thousand feet elevation, and not much below five thousand. The\ngreat inner 'parks' were probably turned into lakes, but they will drain\noff, as the land around us here has done already.\n\n\"Those who managed to find places of comparative shelter will now\ndescend into the level lands and try to hunt up the sites of their\nhomes. If only some plants and grain have been preserved they can, after\na fashion, begin to cultivate the soil.\"\n\n\"But there _is_ no soil,\" said the President, shuddering at the\nrecollection of the devastation he had witnessed. \"It has all been\nwashed off.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied the professor, \"there's yet a good deal in the low places,\nwhere the water rested.\"\n\n\"But it is now the middle of winter.\"\n\n\"Reckoned by the almanac it is, but you see that the temperature is that\nof summer, and has been such for months. I think that this is due in\nsome way to the influence of the nebula, although I cannot account for\nit. At any rate it will be possible to plant and sow.\n\n\"The whole body of the atmosphere having been raised four thousand feet,\nthe atmospheric conditions here now are virtually the same as at the\nformer sea-level. If we can find the people and reassure them, we must\ntake the lead in restoring the land to fertility, and also in the\nreconstruction of homes.\"\n\n\"Suppose the flood should recommence?\"\n\n\"There is no likelihood of it.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said the President, putting his face between his hands and\ngazing sadly into the fire, \"here is all that remains of the mightiest\nnation of the world, the richest, the most populous--and we are to build\nup out of this remnant a new fatherland.\"\n\n\"This is not the only remnant,\" said Professor Pludder. \"One-quarter, at\nleast, of the area of the United States is still above sea-level. Think\nof Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, Nevada, the larger part of California,\nWyoming, a part of Montana, two-thirds of Idaho, a half of Oregon and\nWashington--all above the critical level of four thousand feet, and all\nexcept the steepest moutainsides can be reclaimed.\n\n\"There is hope for our country yet. Remember that the climate of this\nentire region will now be changed, since the barometric isobars have\nbeen lifted up, and the line of thirty inches pressure now meets the\nedge of the Colorado plateau. There may be a corresponding change in the\nrainfall and in all the conditions of culture and fertility.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" sighed the President, \"but I cannot, I cannot withdraw my mind\nfrom the thought of the _millions, millions, millions_ who have\nperished!\"\n\n\"I do not say that we should forget them,\" replied Professor Pludder;\n\"Heaven forbid! But I do say that we must give our attention to those\nthat remain, and turn our faces steadily toward the future.\"\n\n\"Abiel,\" returned the President, pressing the professor's hand, \"you are\nright. My confidence in you was shaken, but now I follow you again.\"\n\nThus they talked until midnight, and then got a little rest with the\nothers. They were up and off at break of day, and as they mounted higher\nthey began to encounter immense rocks that had come tumbling down from\nabove.\n\n\"How can you talk of people escaping toward the mountains if they had to\nencounter these?\" demanded the President.\n\n\"Some of these rocks have undoubtedly been brought down by the\ntorrents,\" Professor Pludder replied, \"but I believe that the greater\nnumber fell earlier, during the earthquakes that accompanied the first\ninvasions of the sea.\"\n\n\"But those earthquakes may have continued all through.\"\n\n\"I do not think so. We have felt no trembling of the earth. I believe\nthat the convulsions lasted only for a brief period, while the rocks\nwere yielding to the pressure along the old sea-coast. After a little\nthe crust below adjusted itself to the new conditions. And even if the\nrocks fell while people were trying to escape from the flood below, they\nmust, like the water, have followed the gorges and hollow places, while\nthe fugitives would, of course, keep upon the ridges.\"\n\nWhatever perils they may have encountered, people had certainly escaped\nas the professor had averred. When the party, in the middle of the day,\nwere seated at their lunch, on an elevated point from which they could\nsee far over the strange ocean that they had left behind them, while the\nsouthern buttresses of Pike's Peak rose steeply toward the north, they\ndiscovered the first evidence of the existence of refugees in the\nmountains. This was a smoke rising over an intervening ridge, which\ntheir new companions declared could be due to nothing less than a large\ncamp-fire.\n\nThey hastened to finish their meal, and then climbed the ridge. As soon\nas they were upon it they found themselves looking down into a broad,\nshallow ca\u00f1on, where there were nearly twenty rudely constructed cabins,\nwith a huge fire blazing in the midst of the place, and half a dozen\nred-shirted men busy about it, evidently occupied in the preparation of\nthe dinner of a large party.\n\nTheir friends recognized an acquaintance in one of the men below and\nhailed him with delight. Instantly men, women, and children came running\nout of the huts to look at them, and as they descended into this\nimprovised village they were received with a hospitality that was almost\nhilarious.\n\nThe refugees consisted of persons who had escaped from the lower lands\nin the immediate vicinity, and they were struck dumb when told that they\nwere entertaining the President of the United States and his family.\n\nThe entire history of their adventures was related on both sides. The\nrefugees told how, at the commencement of the great rain, when it became\nevident that the water would inundate their farms and buildings, they\nloaded themselves with as many provisions as they could carry, and, in\nspite of the suffocating downpour that filled the air, managed to fight\ntheir way to the ridge overhanging the deep cut in which they were now\nencamped.\n\nHardly a quarter of those who started arrived in safety. They sheltered\nthemselves to the number of about thirty, in a huge cavern, which faced\ndown the mountain, and had a slightly upward sloping floor, so that the\nwater did not enter. Here, by careful economy, they were able to eke out\ntheir provisions until the sky cleared, after which the men, being used\nto outdoor labor and hunting, contrived to supply the wants of the\nforlorn little community.\n\nThey managed to kill a few animals, and found the bodies of others\nrecently killed, or drowned. Later they descended into the lowlands, as\nthe water ran off, and searching among the ruins of their houses found\nsome remnants of supplies in the cellars and about the foundations of\nthe barns. They were preparing to go down in a body and seek to\nre-establish themselves on the sites of their old homes, when the\nPresident's party came upon them.\n\nThe meeting with these refugees was but the first of a series of similar\nencounters on the way along the eastern face of the Pike's Peak range.\nIn the aggregate they met several hundred survivors who had established\nthemselves on the site of Colorado Springs, where a large number of\nhouses, standing on the higher ground, had escaped.\n\nThey had been soaked with water, descending through the shattered roofs\nand broken windows, and pouring into the basements and cellars. The\nfugitives came from all directions, some from the caverns on the\nmountains, and some from the rocks toward the north and east. A\nconsiderable number asserted that they had found refuge in the Garden of\nthe Gods.\n\nAs near as could be estimated, about a quarter of the population\nremained alive.\n\nThe strong points of Professor Pludder now, once more, came out\nconspicuously. He proved himself an admirable organizer. He explored all\nthe country round, and enheartened everybody, setting them to work to\nrepair the damage as much as possible.\n\nSome horses and cattle were found which, following their instincts, had\nmanaged to escape the flood. In the houses and other buildings yet\nstanding a great deal of food and other supplies were discovered, so\nthat there was no danger of a famine. As he had anticipated, the soil\nhad not all been washed away from the flat land, and he advised the\ninhabitants to plant quick-growing seeds at once.\n\nHe utilized the horses to send couriers in all directions, some going\neven as far as Denver. Everywhere virtually the same conditions were\nfound--many had escaped and were alive, only needing the guidance of a\nquicker intelligence, and this was supplied by the advice which the\nprofessor instructed his envoys to spread among the people. He sought to\ncheer them still more by the information that the President was among\nthem, and looking out for their welfare.\n\nOne thing which his couriers at last began to report to him was a cause\nof surprise. They said that the level of the water was rapidly falling.\nSome who had gone far toward the east declared that it had gone down\nhundreds of feet. But the professor reflected that this was impossible,\nbecause evaporation could not account for it, and he could not persuade\nhimself that so much water could have found its way into the interior of\nthe crust.\n\nHe concluded that his informants had allowed their hopes to affect their\neyesight, and, strong as usual in his professional dogmas, he made no\npersonal examination. Besides, Professor Pludder was beginning to be\nshaken in his first belief that all trouble from the nebula was at an\nend. Once having been forced to accept the hypothesis that a watery\nnebula had met the earth, he began to reflect that they might not be\nthrough with it.\n\nIn any event, he deemed it wise to prepare for it if it _should_ come\nback. Accordingly he advised that the population that remained should\nconcentrate in the stronger houses, built of stone, and that every\neffort should be made to strengthen them further and to make the roofs\nas solid as possible. He also directed that no houses should be occupied\nthat were not situated on high ground, surrounded with slopes that would\ngive ready flow to the water in case the deluging rain should\nrecommence.\n\nHe had no fixed conviction that it would recommence, but he was uneasy,\nowing to his reflections, and wished to be on the safe side. He sent\nsimilar instructions as far as his horsemen could reach.\n\nThe wisdom of his doubts became manifest about two weeks after the\narrival of the President's party. Without warning the sky, which had\nbeen perfectly blue and cloudless for a month, turned a sickly yellow.\nThen mists hid the head, and in a little while the entire outline of\nPike's Peak, and after that a heavy rain began.\n\nTerror instantly seized the people, and at first nobody ventured out of\ndoors. But as time went on and the rain did not assume the proportions\nof the former _d\u00e9b\u00e2cle_, although it was very heavy and continuous, hope\nrevived. Everybody was on the watch for a sudden clearing up.\n\nInstead of clearing, however, the rain became very irregular, gushing at\ntimes in torrents which were even worse than the original downpour, but\nthese tremendous gushes were of brief duration, so that the water had an\nopportunity to run off the higher ground before the next downpour\noccurred.\n\nThis went on for a week, and then the people were terrified at finding\nthat water was pouring up through all the depressions of the land,\ncutting off the highlands from Pike's Peak with an arm of the sea. It\nwas evident that the flood had been rapidly rising, and if it should\nrise but little higher they would be caught in a trap. The inland sea,\nit was clear, had now invaded the whole of Colorado to the feet of the\nmountains, and was creeping up on them.\n\nJust at this time a series of earthquakes began. They were not severe,\nbut were continuous. The ground cracked open in places, and some houses\nwere overturned, but there were no wall-shattering shocks--only a\ncontinual and dreadful trembling, accompanied by awful subterranean\nsounds.\n\nThis terrible state of affairs had lasted for a day before a remarkable\ndiscovery was made, which filled many hearts with joy, although it\nseemed to puzzle Professor Pludder as much as it rejoiced him.\n\nThe new advance of the sea was arrested! There could be no question of\nthat, for too many had anxiously noted the points to which the water had\nattained.\n\nWe have said that Professor Pludder was puzzled. He was seeking, in his\nmind, a connection between the seismic tremors and the cessation of the\nadvance of the sea. Inasmuch as the downpour continued, the flood ought\nstill to rise.\n\nHe rejected as soon as it occurred to him the idea that the earth could\nbe drinking up the waters as fast as they fell, and that the trembling\nwas an accompaniment of this gigantic deglutition.\n\nSitting in a room with the President and other members of the party from\nWashington, he remained buried in his thoughts, answering inquiries only\nin monosyllables. Presently he opened his eyes very wide and a\nlong-drawn \"A-ah!\" came from his mouth. Then he sprang to his feet and\ncried out, but only as if uttering a thought aloud to himself, the\nstrange word:\n\n_\"Batholite!\"_\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\n\"THE FATHER OF HORROR\"\n\n\nAt the time when the President of the United States and his companions\nwere beginning to discover the refugees around Pike's Peak, Cosmo\nVers\u00e1l's Ark accompanied by the _Jules Verne_, whose commander had\ndecided to remain in touch with his friends, was crossing the submerged\nhills and valleys of Languedoc under a sun as brilliant as that which\nhad once made them a land of gold.\n\nDe Beauxchamps remained aboard the Ark much of the time. Cosmo liked to\nhave him, with himself and Captain Arms, on the bridge, because there\nthey could talk freely about their plans and prospects, and the\nFrenchman was a most entertaining companion.\n\nMeanwhile, the passengers in the saloons and on the promenade decks\nformed little knots and coteries for conversation, for reading, and for\nmutual diversion, or strolled about from side to side, watching the\nendless expanse of waters for the occasional appearance of some\ninhabitant of the deep that had wandered over the new ocean's bottom.\n\nThese animals seemed to be coming to the surface to get bearings. Every\nsuch incident reminded the spectators of what lay beneath the waves, and\nled them to think and talk of the awful fate that had overwhelmed their\nfellow men, until the spirits of the most careless were subdued by the\npervading melancholy.\n\nKing Richard, strangely enough, had taken a liking for Amos Blank, who\nwas frequently asked to join the small and somewhat exclusive circle of\ncompatriots that continually surrounded the fallen monarch. The\nbillionaire and the king often leaned elbow to elbow over the rail, and\nput their heads companionably together while pointing out some object on\nthe sea. Lord Swansdown felt painfully cut by this, but, of course, he\ncould offer no objection.\n\nFinally Cosmo invited the king to come upon the bridge, from which\npassengers were generally excluded, and the king insisted that Blank\nshould go, too. Cosmo consented, for Blank seemed to him to have become\nquite a changed man, and he found him sometimes full of practical\nsuggestions.\n\nSo it happened that when Captain Arms announced that the Ark was passing\nover the ancient city of Carcassonne, Cosmo, the king, De Beauxchamps,\nAmos Blank, and the captain were all together on the bridge. When\nCaptain Arms mentioned their location, King Richard became very\nthoughtful. After a time he said musingly:\n\n\"Ah! how all these names, Toulouse, Carcassonne, Languedoc, bring back\nto me the memory of my namesake of olden times, Richard I. of England.\nThis, over which we are floating, was the land of the Troubadours, and\nRichard was the very Prince of Troubadours. With all his faults England\nnever had a king like him!\"\n\n\"Knowing your devotion to peace, which was the reason why I wished you\nto be of the original company in the Ark, I am surprised to hear you say\nthat,\" said Cosmo.\n\n\"Ah!\" returned the King, \"But Coeur de Lion was a true Englishman, even\nin his love of fighting. What would he say if he knew where England lies\nto-day? What would he say if he knew the awful fate that has come upon\nthis fair and pleasant land, from whose poets and singers he learned the\nart of minstrelsy?\"\n\n\"He would say, 'Do not despair,'\" replied Cosmo. \"' Show the courage of\nan Englishman, and fight for your race if you cannot for your country.'\"\n\n\"But may not England, may not all these lands, emerge again from the\nfloods?\" asked the king.\n\n\"Not in our time, not in our children's time,\" said Cosmo Vers\u00e1l,\nthoughtfully shaking his head.\n\n\"In the remote future, yes--but I cannot tell how remote. Tibet was once\nan appanage of your crown, before China taught the West what war meant,\nand in Tibet you may help to found a new empire, but I must tell you\nthat it will not resemble the empires of the past. Democracy will be its\ncorner stone, and science its law.\"\n\n\"Then I devote myself to democracy and science,\" responded King Richard.\n\n\"Good! Admirable!\" exclaimed Amos Blank and De Beauxchamps\nsimultaneously, while Captain Arms would probably have patted the king\non the back had not his attention, together with that of the others,\nbeen distracted by a huge whale blowing almost directly in the course of\nthe Ark.\n\n\"Blessed if I ever expected to see a sight like that in these parts!\"\nexclaimed the captain. \"This lifting the ocean up into the sky is\nupsetting the order of nature. I'd as soon expect to sight a cachalot on\ntop of the Rocky Mountains.\"\n\n\"They'll be there, too, before long,\" said Cosmo.\n\n\"I wonder what he's looking for,\" continued Captain Arms. \"He must have\ncome down from the north. He couldn't have got in through the Pyrenees\nor the Sierra Nevadas. He's just navigated right over the whole country\nstraight down from the English Channel.\"\n\nThe whale sounded at the approach of the Ark, but in a little while he\nwas blowing again off toward the south, and then the passengers caught\nsight of him, and there was great excitement.\n\nHe seemed to be of enormous size, and he sent his fountain to an\nextraordinary height in the air. On he went, appearing and disappearing,\nsteering direct for Africa, until, with glasses, they could see his\nwhite plume blowing on the very edge of the horizon.\n\nNot even the reflection that they themselves were sailing over Europe\nimpressed some of the passengers with so vivid a sense of their\nsituation as the sight of this monstrous inhabitant of the ocean taking\na view of his new domain.\n\nAt night Cosmo continued the concerts and the presentation of the\nShakespearian dramas, and for an hour each afternoon he had a\n\"conference\" in the saloon, at which Theriade and Sir Athelstone were\nalmost the sole performers.\n\nTheir disputes, and Cosmo's efforts to keep the peace, amused for a\nwhile, but at length the audiences diminished until Cosmo, with his\nconstant companions, the Frenchman, the king, Amos Blank, the three\nprofessors from Washington, and a few other savants were the only\nlisteners.\n\nBut the music and the plays always drew immensely.\n\nJoseph Smith was kept busy most of the time in Cosmo's cabin, copying\nplans for the regeneration of mankind.\n\nWhen they knew that they had finally left the borders of France and were\nsailing above the Mediterranean Sea, it became necessary to lay their\ncourse with considerable care. Cosmo decided that the only safe plan\nwould be to run south of Sardinia, and then keep along between Sicily\nand Tunis, and so on toward lower Egypt.\n\nThere he intended to seek a way over the mountains north of the Sinai\npeninsula into the Syrian desert, from which he could reach the ancient\nvalley of the Euphrates and the Persian Gulf. He would then pass down\nthe Arabian Sea, swing round India and Ceylon, and, by way of the Bay of\nBengal and the plains of the Ganges and Brahmaputra, approach the\nHimalayas.\n\nCaptain Arms was rather inclined to follow the Gulf of Suez and the\ndepression of the Red Sea, but Cosmo was afraid that they would have\ndifficulty in getting the Ark safely through between the Mt. Sinai peaks\nand the Jebel Gharib range.\n\n\"Well, you're the commodore,\" said the captain at the end of the\ndiscussion, \"but hang me if I'd not rather follow a sea, where I know\nthe courses, than go navigating over mountains and deserts in the land\nof Shinar. We'll land on top of Jerusalem yet, you'll see!\"\n\nFeeling sure of plenty of water under keel, they now made better speed\nand De Beauxchamps retired into the _Jules Verne_, and detached it from\nthe Ark, finding that he could distance the latter easily with the\nsubmersible running just beneath the surface of the water.\n\n\"Come up to blow, and take a look around from the bridge, once in a\nwhile,\" the captain called out to him as he disappeared and the cover\nclosed over him. The _Jules Verne_ immediately sank out of sight.\n\nThey passed round Sardinia, and between the old African coast and\nSicily, and were approaching the Malta Channel when their attention was\ndrawn to a vast smoke far off toward the north.\n\n\"It's Etna in eruption,\" said Cosmo to the captain.\n\n\"A magnificent sight!\" exclaimed King Richard, who happened to be on the\nbridge.\n\n\"Yes, and I'd like to see it nearer,\" remarked Cosmo, as a wonderful\ncolumn of smoke, as black as ink, seemed to shoot up to the very zenith.\n\n\"You'd better keep away,\" Captain Arms said warningly. \"There's no good\ncomes of fooling round volcanoes in a ship.\"\n\n\"Oh, it's safe enough,\" returned Cosmo. \"We can run right over the\nsoutheastern corner of Sicily and get as near as we like. There is\nnothing higher than about three thousand feet in that part of the\nisland, so we'll have a thousand feet to spare.\"\n\n\"But maybe the water has lowered.\"\n\n\"Not more than a foot or two,\" said Cosmo. \"Go ahead.\"\n\nThe captain plainly didn't fancy the adventure, but he obeyed orders,\nand the Ark's nose was turned northward, to the delight of many of the\npassengers who had become greatly interested when they learned that the\ntremendous smoke that they saw came from Mount Etna.\n\nSome of them were nervous, but the more adventurous spirits heartily\napplauded Cosmo Vers\u00e1l's design to give them a closer view of so\nextraordinary a spectacle. Even from their present distance the sight\nwas one that might have filled them with terror if they had not already\nbeen through adventures which had hardened their nerves. The smoke was\ntruly terrific in appearance.\n\nIt did not spread low over the sea, but rose in an almost vertical\ncolumn, widening out at a height of several miles, until it seemed to\ncanopy the whole sky toward the north.\n\nIt could be seen spinning in immense rolling masses, the outer parts of\nwhich were turned by the sunshine to a dingy brown color, while the main\nstem of the column, rising directly from the great crater, was of pitchy\nblackness.\n\nAn awful roaring was audible, sending a shiver through the Ark. At the\nbottom of the mass of smoke, through which gleams of fire were seen to\nshoot as they drew nearer, appeared the huge conical form of the\nmountain, whose dark bulk still rose nearly seven thousand feet above\nthe sea that covered the great, beautiful, and historic island beneath\nit.\n\nThey had got within about twenty miles of the base of the mountain, when\na shout was heard by those on the bridge, and Cosmo and the captain,\nlooking for its source, saw the _Jules Verne_, risen to the surface a\nlittle to starboard, and De Beauxchamps excitedly signaling to them.\nThey just made out the words, \"Sheer off!\" when the Ark, with a groaning\nsound, took ground, and they were almost precipitated over the rail of\nthe bridge.\n\n\"Aground again, by ----!\" exclaimed Captain Arms, instantly signaling\nall astern. \"I told you not to go fooling round a volcano.\"\n\n\"This beats me!\" cried Cosmo Vers\u00e1l. \"I wonder if the island has begun\nto rise.\"\n\n\"More likely the sea has begun to fall,\" growled Captain Arms.\n\n\"Do you know where we are?\" asked Cosmo.\n\n\"We can't be anywhere but on the top of Monte Lauro,\" replied the\ncaptain.\n\n\"But that's only three thousand feet high.\"\n\n\"It's exactly three thousand two hundred and thirty feet,\" said the\ncaptain. \"I haven't navigated the old Mediterranean a hundred times for\nnothing.\"\n\n\"But even then we should have near seven hundred and fifty feet to\nspare, allowing for the draft of the Ark, and a slight subsidence of the\nwater.\"\n\n\"Well, you haven't allowed enough, that's plain,\" said the captain.\n\n\"But it's impossible that the flood can have subsided more than seven\nhundred feet already.\"\n\n\"I don't care how impossible it is--here we are! We're stuck on a\nmountain-top, and if we don't leave our bones on it I'm a porpoise.\"\n\nBy this time the _Jules Verne_ was alongside, and De Beauxchamps shouted\nup:\n\n\"I was running twenty feet under water, keeping along with the Ark, when\nmy light suddenly revealed the mountain ahead. I hurried up and tried to\nwarn you, but it was too late.\"\n\n\"Can't you go down and see where we're fast?\" asked Cosmo.\n\n\"Certainly; that's just what I was about to propose,\" replied the\nFrenchman, and immediately the submersible disappeared.\n\nAfter a long time, during which Cosmo succeeded in allaying the fears of\nhis passengers, the submersible reappeared, and De Beauxchamps made his\nreport. He said that the Ark was fast near the bow on a bed of shelly\nlimestone.\n\nHe thought that by using the utmost force of the _Jules Verne_, whose\nengines were very powerful, in pushing the Ark, combined with the\nbacking of her own engines, she might be got off.\n\n\"Hurry up, then, and get to work,\" cried Captain Arms. \"This flood is on\nthe ebb, and a few hours more will find us stuck here like a ray with\nhis saw in a whale's back.\"\n\nDe Beauxchamps's plan was immediately adopted. The _Jules Verne_\ndescended, and pushed with all her force, while the engines of the Ark\nwere reversed, and within fifteen minutes they were once more afloat.\n\nWithout waiting for a suggestion from Cosmo Vers\u00e1l, the Frenchman\ncarefully inspected with his searchlight the bottom of the Ark where she\nhad struck, and when he came to the surface he was able to report that\nno serious damage had resulted.\n\n\"There's no hole,\" he said, \"only a slight denting of one of the plates,\nwhich will not amount to anything.\"\n\nCosmo, however, was not content until he had made a careful inspection\nby opening some of the manholes in the inner skin of the vessel. He\nfound no cause for anxiety, and in an hour the Ark resumed its voyage\neastward, passing over the site of ancient Syracuse.\n\nBy this time a change of the wind had sent the smoke from Etna in their\ndirection, and now it lay thick upon the water, and rendered it, for a\nwhile, impossible to see twenty fathoms from the bridge.\n\n\"It's old Etna's dying salute,\" said Cosmo. \"He won't have his head\nabove water much longer.\"\n\n\"But the flood is going down,\" exclaimed Captain Arms.\n\n\"Yes, and that puzzles me. There must have been an enormous absorption\nof water into the interior, far greater than I ever imagined possible.\nBut wait until the nucleus of the nebula strikes us! In the meantime,\nthis lowering of the water renders it necessary for us to make haste, or\nwe may not get over the mountains round Suez before the downpour\nrecommences.\"\n\nAs soon as they escaped from the smoke of Etna they ran full speed ahead\nagain, and, keeping well south of Crete, at length, one morning they\nfound themselves in the latitude and longitude of Alexandria.\n\nThe weather was still superb, and Cosmo was very desirous of getting a\nline on the present height of the water. He thought that he could make a\nfair estimate of this from the known elevation of the mountains about\nSinai. Accordingly they steered in that direction, and on the way passed\ndirectly over the site of Cairo.\n\nThen the thought of the pyramids came to them all, and De Beauxchamps,\nwho had come aboard the Ark, and who was always moved by sentimental\nconsiderations, proposed that they should spend a few hours here, while\nhe descended to inspect the condition in which the flood had left those\nmighty monuments.\n\nCosmo not only consented to this, but he even offered to be a member of\nthe party. The Frenchman was only too glad to have his company. Cosmo\nVers\u00e1l descended into the submersible after instructing Captain Arms to\nhover in the neighborhood.\n\nThe passengers and crew of the Ark, with expressions of anxiety that\nwould have pleased their subject if he had heard them, watched the\n_Jules Verne_ disappear into the depths beneath.\n\nThe submersible was gone so long that the anxiety of those aboard the\nArk deepened into alarm, and finally became almost panic. They had never\nbefore known how much they depended upon Cosmo Vers\u00e1l.\n\nHe was their only reliance, their only hope. He alone had known how to\nkeep up their spirits, and when he had assured them, as he so often did,\nthat the flooding would surely recommence, they had hardly been\nterrified because of their unexpressed confidence that, let come what\nwould, his great brain would find a way out for them.\n\nNow he was gone, down into the depths of this awful sea, where their\nimaginations pictured a thousand unheard-of perils, and perhaps they\nwould never see him again! Without him they knew themselves to be\nhelpless. Even Captain Arms almost lost his nerve.\n\nThe strong good sense of Amos Blank alone saved them from the utter\ndespair that began to seize upon them as hour after hour passed without\nthe reappearance of the _Jules Verne_.\n\nHis experience had taught him how to keep a level head in an emergency,\nand how to control panics. With King Richard always at his side, he went\nabout among the passengers and fairly laughed them out of their fears.\n\nWithout discussing the matter at all, he convinced them, by the simple\nforce of his own apparent confidence, that they were worrying themselves\nabout nothing.\n\nHe was, in fact, as much alarmed as any of the others, but he never\nshowed it. He started a rumor, after six hours had elapsed, that Cosmo\nhimself had said that they would probably require ten or twelve hours\nfor their exploration.\n\nCosmo had said nothing of the kind, but Blank's prevarication had its\nintended effect, and fortunately, before the lapse of another six hours,\nthere was news from under the sea.\n\nAnd what was happening in the mysterious depths below the Ark? What had\nso long detained the submersible?\n\nThe point where the descent was made had been so well chosen that the\n_Jules Verne_ almost struck the apex of the Great Pyramid as it\napproached the bottom. The water was somewhat muddy from the sands of\nthe desert, and the searchlight streamed through a yellowish medium,\nrecalling the \"golden atmosphere\" for which Egypt had been celebrated.\nBut, nevertheless, the light was so powerful that they could see\ndistinctly at a distance of several rods.\n\nThe pyramid appeared to have been but little injured, although the\ntremendous tidal wave that had swept up the Nile during the invasion of\nthe sea before the downpour began had scooped out the sand down to the\nbed-rock on all sides.\n\nFinding nothing of particular interest in a circuit of the pyramid, they\nturned in the direction of the Great Sphinx.\n\nThis, too, had been excavated to its base, and it now stood up to its\nfull height, and a terrible expression seemed to have come into its\nenigmatic features.\n\nCosmo wished to get a close look at it, and they ran the submersible\ninto actual contact with the forepart of the gigantic statue, just under\nthe mighty chin.\n\nWhile they paused there, gazing out of the front window of the vessel, a\nbursting sound was heard, followed by a loud crash, and the _Jules\nVerne_ was shaken from stem to stern. Every man of them threw himself\nagainst the sides of the vessel, for the sound came from overhead, and\nthey had an instinctive notion that the roof was being crushed down upon\nthem.\n\nA second resounding crash was heard, shaking them like an earthquake,\nand the little vessel rolled partly over upon its side.\n\n\"We are lost!\" cried De Beauxchamps. \"The Sphinx is falling upon us! We\nshall be buried alive here!\"\n\nA third crash came over their heads, and the submersible seemed to sink\nbeneath them as if seeking to avoid the fearful blows that were rained\nupon its roof.\n\nStill, the stout curved ceiling, strongly braced within, did not yield,\nalthough they saw, with affright, that it was bulged inward, and some of\nthe braces were torn from their places. But no water came in.\n\nStunned by the suddenness of the accident, for a few moments they did\nnothing but cling to such supports as were within their reach, expecting\nthat another blow would either force the vessel completely over or break\nthe roof in.\n\nBut complete silence now reigned, and the missiles from above ceased to\nstrike the submersible. The searchlight continued to beam out of the\nfore end of the vessel, and following its broad ray with their eyes,\nthey uttered one cry of mingled amazement and fear, and then stared\nwithout a word at such a spectacle as the wildest imagination could not\nhave pictured.\n\nThe front of the Sphinx had disappeared, and the light, penetrating\nbeyond the place where it had stood, streamed upon the face and breast\nof an enormous black figure, seated on a kind of throne, and staring\ninto their faces with flaming eyes which at once fascinated and\nterrified them.\n\nTo their startled imaginations the eyes seemed to roll in their sockets,\nand flashes of fire to dart from them. Their expression was menacing and\nterrifying beyond belief. At the same time the aspect of the face was so\nmajestic that they cowered before it.\n\nThe cheekbones were high, massive, and polished until they shone in the\nlight; the nose and chin were powerful in their contours; and the brow\nwore an intimidating frown. It seemed to the awed onlookers as if they\nhad sacrilegiously burst into the sanctuary of an offended god.\n\nBut, after a minute or two of stupefaction, they thought again of the\ndesperateness of their situation, and turned from staring at the strange\nidol to consider what they should do.\n\nThe fact that no water was finding its way into the submersible somewhat\nreassured them, but the question now arose whether it could be withdrawn\nfrom its position.\n\nThey had no doubt that the front of the Sphinx, saturated by the water\nafter the thousands of years that it had stood there, exposed to the\ndesiccating influences of the sun and the desert sands, had suddenly\ndisintegrated, and fallen upon them, pinning their vessel fast under the\nfragments of the huge head.\n\nDe Beauxchamps tried the engines and found that they had no effect in\nmoving the _Jules Verne_. He tried again and again by reversing to\ndisengage the vessel, but it would not stir. Then they debated the only\nother means of escape.\n\n\"Although I have levium life-suits,\" said the Frenchman, \"and although\nthe top of the _Jules Verne_ can probably be opened, for the door seems\nnot to have been touched, yet the instant it is removed the water will\nrush in, and it will be impossible to pump out the vessel.\"\n\n\"Are your life-suits so arranged that they will permit of moving the\nlimbs?\" demanded Cosmo.\n\n\"Certainly they are.\"\n\n\"And can they be weighted so as to remain at the bottom?\"\n\n\"They are arranged for that,\" responded De Beauxchamps.\n\n\"And can the weights be detached by the inmates without permitting the\nentrance of water?\"\n\n\"It can be done, although a very little water might enter during the\noperation.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Cosmo, \"let us put on the suits, open the door, take out\nthe ballast so that, if released, the submersible will rise to the\nsurface through its own buoyancy, and then see if we cannot loosen the\nvessel from outside.\"\n\nIt was a suggestion whose boldness made even the owner and constructor\nof the _Jules Verne_ stare for a moment, but evidently it was the only\npossible way in which the vessel might be saved; and knowing that, in\ncase of failure, they could themselves float to the surface after\nremoving the weights from the bottom of the suits, they unanimously\ndecided to try Cosmo Vers\u00e1l's plan.\n\nIt was terribly hard work getting the ballast out of the submersible,\nworking as they had to do under water, which rushed in as soon as the\ndoor was opened, and in their awkward suits, which were provided with\napparatus for renewing the supply of oxygen; but at last they succeeded.\n\nThen they clambered outside, and labored desperately to release the\nvessel from the huge fragments of stone that pinned it down. Finally,\nexhausted by their efforts, and unable to make any impression, they gave\nup.\n\nDe Beauxchamps approached Cosmo and motioned to him that it was time to\nascend to the surface and leave the _Jules Verne_ to her fate. But Cosmo\nsignaled back that he wished first to examine more closely the strange\nstatue that was gazing upon them in the still unextinguished beam of the\nsearchlight with what they might now have regarded as a look of mockery.\n\nThe others, accordingly, waited while Cosmo Vers\u00e1l, greatly impeded by\nhis extraordinary garment, clambered up to the front of the figure.\nThere he saw something which redoubled his amazement.\n\nOn the broad breast he saw a representation of a world overwhelmed with\na deluge and encircling it was what he instantly concluded to be the\npicture of a nebula. Underneath, in ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics, with\nwhich Cosmo was familiar, was an inscription in letters of gold, which\ncould only be translated thus:\n\n  I Come Again--\n  At the End of Time.\n\n\"Great Heavens!\" he said to himself. \"It is a prophecy of the Second\nDeluge!\"\n\n[Illustration: \"IT IS A PROPHECY OF THE SECOND DELUGE.\"]\n\nHe continued to gaze, amazed, at the figure and the inscription, until\nDe Beauxchamps clambered to his side and indicated to him that it was\nnecessary that they should ascend without further delay, showing him by\nsigns that the air-renewing apparatus would give out.\n\nWith a last lingering look at the figure, Cosmo imitated the others by\ndetaching the weights from below his feet, and a minute later they were\nall shooting rapidly toward the surface of the sea, De Beauxchamps, as\nhe afterwards declared, uttering a prayer for the repose of the _Jules\nVerne_.\n\nThe imaginary time which Amos Blank had fixed as the limit set by Cosmo\nfor the return from the depths was nearly gone, and he was beginning to\ncast about for some other invention to quiet the rising fears of the\npassengers, when a form became visible which made the eyes of Captain\nArms, the first to catch sight of it, start from their sockets. He\nrubbed them, and looked again--but there it was!\n\nA huge head, human in outline, with bulging, glassy eyes, popped\nsuddenly out of the depths, followed by the upper part of a gigantic\nform which was no less suggestive of a monstrous man, and which\nimmediately began to wave its arms!\n\nBefore the captain could collect his senses another shot to the surface,\nand then another and another, until there were seven of them floating\nand awkwardly gesticulating within a radius of a hundred fathoms on the\nstarboard side of the vessel.\n\nThe whole series of apparitions did not occupy more than a quarter of a\nminute in making their appearance.\n\nBy the time the last had sprung into sight Captain Arms had recovered\nhis wits, and he shouted an order to lower a boat, at the same time\nrunning down from the bridge to superintend the operation. Many of the\ncrew and passengers had in the meantime seen the strange objects, and\nthey were thrown into a state of uncontrollable excitement.\n\n\"It's them!\" shouted the captain over his shoulder, in response to a\nhundred inquiries all put at once, and forgetting his grammar in the\nexcitement. \"They've come up in diving-suits.\"\n\nAmos Blank comprehended the situation at once; and while the captain was\ngetting out the boat, he explained matters to the crowd.\n\n\"The submersible must be lost,\" he said quietly, \"but the men have\nescaped, so there is no great harm done. It does great credit to that\nFrenchman that he should have been prepared for such an emergency. Those\nare levium suits, and I've no doubt that he has got hydrogen somewhere\ninside to increase their buoyancy.\"\n\nWithin a quarter of an hour all the seven had been picked up by the\nboat, and it returned to the Ark. The strange forms were lifted aboard\nwith tackle to save time; and as the first one reached the deck, it\nstaggered about on its big limbs for a moment.\n\nThen the metallic head opened, and the features of De Beauxchamps were\nrevealed.\n\nBefore anybody could assist him he had freed himself from the suit, and\nimmediately he began to aid the others. In ten minutes they all stood\nsafe and sound before the astonished eyes of the spectators. Cosmo had\nsuffered from the confinement, and he sank upon a seat, but De\nBeauxchamps seemed to be the most affected. With downcast look he said,\nsadly shaking his head:\n\n\"The poor _Jules Verne_! I shall never see her again.\"\n\n\"What has happened?\" demanded Captain Arms.\n\n\"It was the Father of Horror,\" muttered Cosmo Vers\u00e1l.\n\n\"The Father of Horror--what's that?\"\n\n\"Why, the Great Sphinx,\" returned Cosmo, gradually recovering his\nbreath. \"Didn't you know that that was what the Arabs always called the\nSphinx?\n\n\"It was that which fell upon the submersible--split right open and\ndropped its great chin upon us as we were sailing round it, and pinned\nus fast. But the sight that we saw when the Sphinx fell apart! Tell\nthem, De Beauxchamps.\"\n\nThe Frenchman took up the narrative, while, with breathless attention,\npassengers and crew crowded about to listen to his tale.\n\n\"When we got to the bottom,\" he said, \"we first inspected the Great\nPyramid, going all round it with our searchlight. It was in good\ncondition, although the tide that had come up the Nile with the invasion\nof the sea had washed away the sands to a great depth all about. When we\nhad completed the circuit of the pyramid, we saw the Sphinx, which had\nbeen excavated by the water so that it stood up to its full height.\n\n\"We ran close around it, and when we were under the chin the whole\nthing, saturated by the water, which no doubt caused an expansion\nwithin--you know how many thousand years the gigantic idol had been\nsun-dried--dropped apart.\n\n\"The submersible was caught by the falling mass, and partly crushed. We\nlabored for hours and hours to release the vessel, but there was little\nthat we could do. It almost broke my heart to think of leaving the\n_Jules Verne_ there, but it had to be done.\n\n\"At last we put on the levium floating-suits, opened the cover at the\ntop, and came to the surface. The last thing I saw was the searchlight,\nstill burning, and illuminating the most marvelous spectacle that human\neyes ever gazed upon.\"\n\n\"Oh, what was it? What was it?\" demanded a score of voices in chorus.\n\n\"It is impossible to describe it. It was the secret of old Egypt\nrevealed at last--at the end of the world!\"\n\n\"But what was it like?\"\n\n\"Like a glimpse into the remotest corridors of time,\" interposed Cosmo\nVers\u00e1l, with a curious look in his eyes.\n\n\"Some of you may have heard that long ago holes were driven through the\nSphinx in the hope of discovering something hidden inside, but they\nmissed the secret. The old god kept it well until his form fell apart.\nWe were pinned so close to it that we could not help seeing it, even in\nthe excitement of our situation.\n\n\"It had always been supposed that the Sphinx was the symbol of\nsomething--it _was_, and more than a symbol! The explorers away back in\nthe nineteenth century who thought that they had found something\nmysterious in the Great Pyramid went wide of the mark when they\nneglected the Sphinx.\"\n\n\"But what did you see?\"\n\n_\"We saw the prophecy of the Second Deluge,\"_ said Cosmo, rising to his\nfeet, his piercing eyes aflame. \"In the heart of the huge mass,\napproachable, no doubt, by some concealed passage in the rock beneath,\nknown only to the priests, stood a gigantic idol, carved out of black\nmarble.\n\n\"It had enormous eyes of some gem that blazed in the electric beam from\nthe searchlight, with huge golden ears and beard, and on its breast was\na representation of a drowning world, with a great nebula sweeping over\nit.\"\n\n\"It might have been a history instead of a prophecy,\" suggested one of\nthe listening savants. \"Perhaps it only told what had once happened.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Cosmo, shaking his big head. \"It was a prophecy. Under it,\nin ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics, which I recognized, was an\ninscription which could only be translated by the words, 'I come\nagain--at the end of time!'\"\n\nThere was a quality in Cosmo Vers\u00e1l's voice which made the hearers\nshudder with horror.\n\n\"Yes,\" he added. \"It comes again! The prophecy was hidden, but science\nhad its means of revelation, too, if the world would but have listened\nto its voice. Even without the prophecy I have saved the flower of\nmankind.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nTHE TERRIBLE NUCLEUS ARRIVES\n\n\nWhen the company in the Ark had recovered from the astonishment produced\nby the narratives of De Beauxchamps and Cosmo Vers\u00e1l, and particularly\nthe vivid description given by the latter of the strange idol concealed\nin the breast of the \"Father of Horror,\" and the inferences which he\ndrew concerning its prophetic character, the question again arose as to\ntheir future course.\n\nCaptain Arms was still for undertaking to follow the trough of the Red\nSea, but Cosmo declared that this course would be doubly dangerous now\nthat the water had lowered and that they no longer had the _Jules Verne_\nto act as a submarine scout, warning them of hidden perils.\n\nThey must now go by their own soundings, and this would be especially\ndangerous in the close neighborhood of half-submerged mountains, whose\nbuttresses and foothills might rise suddenly out of the depths with\nslopes so steep that the lead would afford no certain guidance.\n\nIt was first necessary to learn if possible the actual height of the\nwater, and whether it was still subsiding. It was partly for this\npurpose that they had passed over Egypt instead of keeping directly on\ntoward the coast of lower Palestine.\n\nBut now Cosmo abandoned his purpose of taking his measurement by the aid\nof Mount Sinai or some of its neighboring peaks, on account of the\ndangerous character of that rugged region. If they had been furnished\nwith deep-sea sounding apparatus they might have made a direct\nmeasurement of the depth in Egypt, but that was one of the few things\nwhich Cosmo Vers\u00e1l had overlooked in furnishing the Ark, and such an\noperation could not be undertaken.\n\nHe discovered that there was a mountain north of the Gulf of Akaba\nhaving an elevation of 3,450 feet, and since this was 220 feet higher\nthan Monte Lauro, in Sicily, on which the Ark had grounded, he counted\non it as a gage which would serve his purpose.\n\nSo they passed almost directly over Suez, and about 120 miles farther\neast they found the mountain they sought, rising to the west of the Wadi\nel Arabia, a continuation of the depression at whose deepest point lay\nthe famous \"Dead Sea,\" so often spoken of in the books of former times.\n\nHere Cosmo was able to make a very accurate estimate from the height of\nthe peak above the water, and he was gratified to find that the\nrecession had not continued. The level of the water appeared to be\nexactly the same as when they made their unfortunate excursion in the\ndirection of smoking Etna.\n\n\"It's all right,\" he said to Captain Arms. \"We can get over into the\nSyrian desert without much danger, although we must go slowly and\ncarefully until we are well past these ranges that come down from the\ndirection of the Dead Sea. After that I do not see that there is\nanything in our way until we reach the ancient plains of Babylon.\"\n\nKing Richard, who was full of the history of the Crusades, as well as of\nBible narratives, wished to have the Ark turn northward, so that they\nmight sail over Jerusalem, and up the Valley of the Jordan within sight\nof Mount Hermon and the Lebanon range.\n\nCosmo had had enough of that kind of adventure, while Captain Arms\ndeclared that he would resign on the spot if there was to be any more\n\"fool navigating on mountain tops.\" But there were many persons in the\nArk who would have been very glad if King Richard's suggestion had been\ncarried out.\n\nThe feelings of some were deeply stirred when they learned that they\nwere now crossing the lower end of Palestine, and that the scenes of so\nmany incidents in the history of Abraham, Moses, and Joshua lay buried\nbeneath the blue water, whose almost motionless surface was marked with\na broad trail of foaming bubbles in the wake of the immense vessel.\n\nCosmo greatly regretted the absence of the submersible when they were\npicking their way over this perilous region, but they encountered no\nreal difficulty, and at length found, by celestial observations, that\nthey were beyond all dangers and safely arrived over the deeply\nsubmerged desert.\n\nThey kept on for several days toward the rising sun, and then Captain\nArms announced that the observations showed that they were over the site\nof Babylon.\n\nThis happened just at the time of the midday dinner, and over the\ndessert Cosmo seized the opportunity to make a little speech, which\ncould be heard by all in the saloon.\n\n\"We are now arrived,\" he said, \"over the very spot where the descendants\nof Noah are said to have erected a tower, known as the Tower of Babel,\nand which they intended to build so high that it would afford a secure\nrefuge in case there should be another deluge.\n\n\"How vain were such expectations, if they were ever entertained, is\nsufficiently shown by the fact that, at this moment, the water rolls\nmore than three thousand feet deep over the place where they put their\ntower, and before the present deluge is over it will be thirty thousand\nfeet deep.\n\n\"More than half a mile beneath our feet lie the broad plains of Chaldea,\nwhere tradition asserts that the study of astronomy began. It was\nBerosus, a Chaldean, who predicted that there would come a second\ndeluge.\n\n\"It occurs to me, since seeing the astounding spectacle disclosed by the\nfalling apart of the Sphinx, that these people may have had an\ninfinitely more profound knowledge of the secrets of the heavens than\ntradition has assigned to them.\n\n\"On the breast of the statue in the Sphinx was the figure of a crowned\nman, encircled by a huge ring, and having behind him the form of a boat\ncontaining two other human figures. The boat was represented as floating\nin a flood of waters.\n\n\"Now, this corresponds exactly with figures that have been found among\nthe most ancient ruins in Chaldea. I regard that ring as symbolical of a\nnebula enveloping the earth, and I think that the second deluge, which\nwe have lived to see, was foretold here thousands of years ago.\"\n\n\"Who foretold it first, then, the people who placed the statue in the\nSphinx, or these astronomers of Chaldea?\" asked Professor Abel Able.\n\n\"I believe,\" Cosmo replied, \"that the knowledge originated here, beneath\nus, and that it was afterward conveyed to the Egyptians, who embodied it\nin their great symbolical god.\"\n\n\"Are we to understand,\" demanded Professor Jeremiah Moses, \"that this\nfigure was all that you saw on the breast of the statue, and that you\nsimply inferred that the ring represented a nebula?\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" Cosmo replied. \"The principal representation was that of a\nworld overwhelmed with a flood, and of a nebula descending upon it.\"\n\n\"How do you know that it was intended for a nebula?\"\n\n\"Because it had the aspect of one, and it was clearly shown to be\ndescending from the high heavens.\"\n\n\"A cloud,\" suggested Professor Moses.\n\n\"No, not a cloud. Mark this, which is a marvel in itself: It had _the\nform of a spiral nebula_. It was unmistakable.\"\n\nAt this point the discussion was interrupted by a call to Cosmo Vers\u00e1l\nfrom Captain Arms on the bridge. He hastily left the table and ascended\nto the captain's side.\n\nHe did not need to be told what to look for. Off in the north the sky\nhad become a solid black mass, veined with the fiercest lightning. The\npealing of the thunder came in a continuous roll, which soon grew so\nloud as to shake the Ark.\n\n\"Up with the side-plates!\" shouted Cosmo, setting twenty bells ringing\nat once. \"Close tight every opening! Screw down the port shutters!\"\n\nThe crew of the Ark was, in a few seconds, running to and fro, executing\nthe orders that came in swift succession from the commander's bridge,\nand the passengers were thrown into wild commotion. But nobody had time\nto attend to them.\n\n\"It is upon us!\" yelled Cosmo in the captain's ear, for the uproar had\nbecome deafening. \"The nucleus is here!\"\n\nThe open promenade decks had not yet all been turned into inner\ncorridors when the downpour began upon the Ark. A great deal of water\nfound its way aboard, but the men worked with a will, as fearful for\ntheir own safety as for that of others, and in a little while everything\nhad been made snug and tight.\n\nIn a short time a tremendous tempest was blowing, the wind coming from\nthe north, and the Ark, notwithstanding her immense breadth of beam, was\ncanted over to leeward at an alarming angle. On the larboard side the\nwaves washed to the top of the great elliptical dome and broke over it,\nand their thundering blows shook the vessel to her center, causing many\nto believe that she was about to founder.\n\nThe disorder was frightful. Men and women were flung about like tops,\nand no one could keep his feet. Crash after crash, that could be heard\namid the howling of the storm, the battering of the waves, and the awful\nroar of the deluge descending on the roof, told the fate of the\ntableware and dishes that had been hastily left in the big dining\nsaloon.\n\nChairs recently occupied by the passengers on what had been the\npromenade decks, and from which they had so serenely, if often\nsorrowfully, looked over the broad, peaceful surface of the waters, were\nnow darting, rolling, tumbling, and banging about, intermingled with\nrugs, hats, coats, and other abandoned articles of clothing.\n\nThe pitching and rolling of the Ark were so much worse than they had\nbeen during the first days of the cataclysm, that Cosmo became very\nsolicitous about his collection of animals.\n\nHe hurried down to the animal deck, and found, indeed, that things were\nin a lamentable shape. The trained keepers were themselves so much at\nthe mercy of the storm that they had had all they could do to save\nthemselves from being trampled to death by the frightened beasts.\n\nThe animals had been furnished with separate pens, but during the long\ncontinued calm the keepers, for the sake of giving their charges greater\nfreedom and better air, had allowed many of them to go at large in the\nbroad central space around which the pens were placed, and the tempest\nhad come so unexpectedly that there had been no time to separate them\nand get them back into their lodgings.\n\nWhen Cosmo descended the scene that met his eyes caused him to cry out\nin dismay, but he could not have been heard if he had spoken through a\ntrumpet. The noise and uproar were stunning, and the spectacle was\nindescribable. The keepers had taken refuge on a kind of gallery running\nround the central space, and were hanging on there for their lives.\n\nAround them, on the railings, clinging with their claws, wildly flapping\ntheir wings, and swinging with every roll of the vessel, were all the\nfowls and every winged creature in the Ark except the giant turkeys,\nwhose power of wing was insufficient to lift them out of the m\u00eal\u00e9e.\n\nBut all the four-footed beasts were rolling, tumbling, and struggling in\nthe open space below. With every lurch of the Ark they were swept across\nthe floor in an indistinguishable mass.\n\nThe elephants wisely did not attempt to get upon their feet, but allowed\nthemselves to slide from side to side, sometimes crushing the smaller\nanimals, and sometimes, in spite of all their efforts, rolling upon\ntheir backs, with their titanic limbs swaying above them, and their\ntrunks wildly grasping whatever came within their reach.\n\nThe huge Californian cattle were in no better case, and the poor sheep\npresented a pitiable spectacle as they were tumbled in woolly heaps from\nside to side.\n\nStrangest sight of all was that of the great Astoria turtles. They had\nbeen pitched upon their backs and were unable to turn themselves over,\nand their big carapaces served admirably for sliders.\n\nThey glided with the speed of logs in a chute, now this way, now that,\nshooting like immense projectiles through the throng of struggling\nbeasts, cutting down those that happened to be upon their feet, and not\nending their course until they had crashed against the nearest wall.\n\nAs one of the turtles slid toward the bottom of the steps on which Cosmo\nwas clinging it cut under the legs of one of the giant turkeys, and the\nlatter, making a superphasianidaean effort, half leaped, half flapped\nits way upon the steps to the side of Cosmo Vers\u00e1l, embracing him with\none of its stumpy wings, while its red neck and head, with bloodshot\neyes, swayed high above his bald dome.\n\nThe keepers gradually made their way round the gallery to Cosmo's side,\nand he indicated to them by signs that they must quit the place with\nhim, and wait for a lull of the tempest before trying to do anything for\ntheir charges.\n\nA few hours later the wind died down, and then they collected all that\nremained alive of the animals in their pens and secured them as best\nthey could against the consequences of another period of rolling and\npitching.\n\nThe experiences of the passengers had been hardly less severe, and panic\nreigned throughout the Ark. After the lull came, however, some degree of\norder was restored, and Cosmo had all who were in a condition to leave\ntheir rooms assemble in the grand saloon, where he informed them of the\nsituation of affairs, and tried to restore their confidence. The roar on\nthe roof, in spite of the sound-absorbing cover which had been\nre-erected, compelled him to use a trumpet.\n\n\"I do not conceal from you,\" he said in conclusion, \"that the worst has\nnow arrived. I do not look for any cessation of the flood from the sky\nuntil we shall have passed through the nucleus of the nebula. But the\nArk is a stout vessel, we are fully provisioned, and we shall get\nthrough.\n\n\"All your chambers have been specially padded, as you may have remarked,\nand I wish you to remain in them, only issuing when summoned for\nassembly here.\n\n\"I shall call you out whenever the condition of the sea renders it safe\nfor you to leave your rooms. Food will be regularly served in your\nquarters, and I beg you to have perfect confidence in me and my\nassistants.\"\n\nBut the confidence which Cosmo Vers\u00e1l recommended to the others was\nhardly shared by himself and Captain Arms. The fury of the blast which\nhad just left them had exceeded everything that Cosmo had anticipated,\nand he saw that, in the face of such hurricanes, the Ark would be\npractically unmanageable.\n\nOne of his first cares was to ascertain the rate at which the downpour\nwas raising the level of the water. This, too, surprised him. His gages\nshowed, time after time, that the rainfall was at the rate of about four\ninches per minute. Sometimes it amounted to as much as six!\n\n\"The central part of the nebula,\" he said to the captain, through the\nspeaking-tube which they had arranged for their intercommunications on\nthe bridge, \"is denser than I had supposed. The condensation is\nenormous, but it is irregular, and I think it very likely that it is\nmore rapid in the north, where the front of the globe is plunging most\ndirectly into the nebulous mass.\n\n\"From this we should anticipate a tremendous flow southward, which may\nsweep us away in that direction. This will not be a bad thing for a\nwhile, since it is southward that we must go in order to reach the\nregion of the Indian Ocean. But, in order not to be carried too rapidly\nthat way, I think it would be the best thing to point the Ark toward the\nnortheast.\"\n\n\"How am I to know anything about the points in this blackness?\" growled\nthe captain.\n\n\"You must go the best you can by the compass,\" said Cosmo.\n\nCosmo Vers\u00e1l, as subsequently appeared, was right in supposing that the\nnucleus of the nebula was exceedingly irregular in density. The\ncondensation was not only much heavier in the north, but it was very\nerratic.\n\nSome parts of the earth received a great deal more water from the opened\nflood-gates above than others, and this difference, for some reason that\nhas never been entirely explained, was especially marked between the\neastern and western hemispheres.\n\nWe have already seen that when the downpour recommenced in Colorado it\nwas much less severe than during the first days of the flood. This\ndifference continued. It seems that all the denser parts of the nucleus\nhappened to encounter the planet on its eastern side.\n\nThis may have been partly due to the fact that as the rotating earth\nmoved on in its eastward motion round the sun the comparatively dense\nmasses of the nebula were always encountered at the times when the\neastern hemisphere was in advance. The fact, which soon became apparent\nto Cosmo, that the downpour was always the most severe in the morning\nhours, bears out this hypothesis.\n\nIt accords with what has been observed with respect to meteors, viz.,\nthat they are more abundant in the early morning. But then it must be\nsupposed that the condensed masses in the nebula were relatively so\nsmall that they became successively exhausted, so to speak, before the\nwestern hemisphere had come fairly into the line of fire.\n\nOf course the irregularity in the arrival of the water did not, in the\nend, affect the general level of the flood, which became the same all\nover the globe, but it caused immense currents, as Cosmo had foreseen.\n\nBut there was one consequence which he had overlooked. The currents,\ninstead of sweeping the Ark continually southward, as he had\nanticipated, formed a gigantic whirl, set up unquestionably by the great\nranges of the Himalayas, the Hindoo Koosh, and the Caucasus.\n\nThis tremendous maelstrom formed directly over Persia and Arabia, and,\nturning in the direction of the hands of a watch, its influence extended\nwestward beyond the place where the Ark now was.\n\nThe consequence was that, in spite of all their efforts, Cosmo and the\ncaptain found their vessel swept resistlessly up the course of the\nvalley containing the Euphrates and the Tigris.\n\nThey were unable to form an opinion of their precise location, but they\nknew the general direction of the movement, and by persistent logging\ngot some idea of the rate of progress.\n\nFortunately the wind seldom blew with its first violence, but the\neffects of the whirling current could be but little counteracted by the\nutmost engine power of the Ark.\n\nDay after day passed in this manner, although, owing to the density of\nthe rain, the difference between day and night was only perceptible by\nthe periodical changes from absolute blackness to a very faint\nillumination when the sun was above the horizon.\n\nThe rise of the flood, which could not have been at a less rate than six\nhundred feet every twenty-four hours, lifted the Ark above the level of\nthe mountains of Kurdistan by the time that they arrived over the upper\npart of the Mesopotamian plain, and the uncertain observations which\nthey occasionally obtained of the location of the sun, combined with\nsuch dead reckoning as they were able to make, finally convinced them\nthat they must certainly be approaching the location of the Black Sea\nand the Caucasus range.\n\n\"I'll tell you what you're going to do,\" yelled Captain Arms. \"You're\ngoing to make a smash on old Ararat, where your predecessor, Noah, made\nhis landfall.\"\n\n\"_Tr\u00e8s bien!_\" shouted De Beauxchamps, who was frequently on the bridge,\nand whose Gallic spirits nothing could daunt. \"That's a good omen! M.\nVers\u00e1l should send out one of his turkeys to spy a landing place.\"\n\nThey were really nearer Ararat than they imagined, and Captain Arms's\nprediction narrowly missed fulfillment. Within a couple of hours after\nhe had spoken a dark mass suddenly loomed through the dense air directly\nin their track.\n\nAlmost at the same time, and while the captain was making desperate\nefforts to sheer off, the sky lightened a little, and they saw an\nimmense heap of rock within a hundred fathoms of the vessel.\n\n\"Ararat, by all that's good!\" yelled the captain. \"Sta'board! Sta'board,\nI tell you! Full power ahead!\"\n\nThe Ark yielded slowly to her helm, and the screws whirled madly,\ndriving her rapidly past the rocks, so close that they might have tossed\na biscuit upon them. The set of the current also aided them, and they\ngot past the danger.\n\n\"Mountain navigation again!\" yelled the captain. \"Here we are in a nest\nof these sky-shoals! What are you going to do now?\"\n\n\"It is impossible to tell,\" returned Cosmo, \"whether this is Great or\nLittle Ararat. The former is over 17,000 feet high, and the latter at\nleast 13,000. It is now twelve days since the flooding recommenced.\n\n\"If we assume a rise of 600 feet in twenty-four hours, that makes a\ntotal of 7,200 feet, which, added to the 3,300 that we had before, gives\n10,500 feet for the present elevation. This estimate may be considerably\nout of the way.\n\n\"I feel sure that both the Ararats are yet well above the water line. We\nmust get out of this region as quickly as possible. Luckily the swirl of\nthe current is now setting us eastward. We are on its northern edge. It\nwill carry the Ark down south of Mount Demavend, and the Elburz range,\nand over the Persian plateau, and if we can escape from it, as I hope,\nby getting away over Beluchistan, we can go directly over India and\nskirt the southern side of the Himalayas. Then we shall be near the goal\nwhich we have had in mind.\"\n\n\"Bless me!\" said the captain, staring with mingled admiration and doubt\nat Cosmo Vers\u00e1l, \"if you couldn't beat old Noah round the world, and\ngive him half the longitude. But I'd rather _you'd_ navigate this\nhooker. The ghost of Captain Sumner itself couldn't work a traverse over\nBeluchistan.\"\n\n\"You'll do it all right,\" returned Cosmo, \"and the next time you drop\nyour anchor it will probably be on the head of Mount Everest.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nROBBING THE CROWN OF THE WORLD\n\n\nNow that they were going with the current instead of striving to stem\nit, the Ark made much more rapid way than during the time that it was\ndrifting toward the Black Sea.\n\nThey averaged at least six knots, and, with the aid of the current,\ncould have done much better, but they thought it well to be cautious,\nespecially as they had so little means of guessing at their exact\nlocation from day to day. The water was rough.\n\nThere was, most of the time, little wind, and often a large number of\nthe passengers assembled in the saloon.\n\nThe noise of the deluge on the roof was so much greater than it had been\nat the start that it was difficult to converse, but there was plenty of\nlight, and they could, at least, see one another, and communicate by\nsigns if not very easily by the voice. Cosmo's library was well\nselected, and many passed hours in reading stories of the world they\nwere to see no more!\n\nKing Richard and Amos Blank imitated Cosmo and the captain by furnishing\nthemselves with a speaking-tube, which they put alternately to their\nlips and their ears, and thus held long conversations, presumably\nexchanging with one another the secrets of high finance and kingly\ngovernment.\n\nBoth of them had enough historical knowledge and sufficient imagination\nto be greatly impressed by the fact that they were drifting, amidst this\nterrible storm, over the vast empire that Alexander the Great had\nconquered.\n\nThey mused over the events of the great Macedonian's long marches\nthrough deserts and over mountains, and the king, who loved the story of\nthese glories of the past, though he had cultivated peace in his own\ndominions, often sighed while they recalled them to one another. Lord\nSwansdown and the other Englishmen aboard seldom joined their king since\nhe had preferred the company of an untitled American to theirs.\n\nThe first named could not often have made a member of the party if he\nhad wished, for he kept his room most of the time, declaring that he had\nnever been so beastly seasick in his life. He thought that such an\nabominable roller as the Ark should never have been permitted to go into\ncommission, don't you know.\n\nOn the morning of the twelfth day after they left the neighborhood of\nMount Ararat Captain Arms averred that their position must be somewhere\nnear longitude 69 degrees east, latitude 26 degrees north.\n\n\"Then you have worked your traverse over Beluchistan very well,\" said\nCosmo, \"and we are now afloat above the valley of the River Indus. We\nhave the desert of northwestern India ahead, and from that locality we\ncan continue right down the course of the Ganges. In fact it would be\nperfectly safe to turn northward and skirt the Himalayas within reach of\nthe high peaks. I think that's what I'll do.\"\n\n\"If you go fooling round any more peaks,\" shouted Captain Arms, in a\nfog-horn voice, \"you'll have to do your own steering! I've had enough of\nthat kind of navigation!\"\n\nNevertheless when Cosmo Vers\u00e1l gave the order the captain turned the\nprow of the Ark toward the presumable location of the great Himalayan\nrange, although the rebellion of his spirit showed in the erect set of\nhis whiskers. They were now entirely beyond the influence of the whirl\nthat had at first got them into trouble, and then helped them out of it,\nin western Asia.\n\nBehind the barrier of the ancient \"Roof of the World\" the sea was\nrelatively calm, although, at times, they felt the effect of currents\npouring down from the north, which had made their way through the lofty\npasses from the Tibetan side.\n\nCosmo calculated from his estimate of the probable rate of rise of the\nflood and from the direction and force of the currents that all but the\nvery highest of the Pamirs must already be submerged.\n\nIt was probable, he thought, that the water had attained a level of\nbetween seventeen and eighteen thousand feet. This, as subsequent events\nindicated, was undoubtedly an underestimate. The downpour in the north\nmust have been far greater than Cosmo thought, and the real height of\nthe flood was considerably in excess of what he supposed.\n\nIf they could have seen some of the gigantic peaks as they approached\nthe mountains in the eastern Punjab, south of Cashmere, they would have\nbeen aware of the error.\n\nAs it was, owing to the impossibility of seeing more than a short\ndistance even when the light was brightest, they kept farther south than\nwas really necessary, and after passing, as they believed, over Delhi,\nsteered south by east, following substantially the course that Cosmo had\noriginally named along the line of the Ganges valley.\n\nThey were voyaging much slower now, and after another ten days had\npassed an unexpected change came on. The downpour diminished in\nseverity, and at times the sun broke forth, and for an hour or two the\nrain would cease entirely, although the sky had a coppery tinge, and at\nnight small stars were not clearly visible.\n\nCosmo was greatly surprised at this. He could only conclude that the\ncentral part of the nebula had been less extensive, though more dense,\nthan he had estimated. It was only thirty-four days since the deluge had\nrecommenced, and unless present appearances were deceptive, its end\nmight be close at hand.\n\nCaptain Arms seized the opportunity to make celestial and solar\nobservations which delighted his seaman's heart, and with great glee he\ninformed Cosmo that they were in longitude 88 degrees 20 minutes east,\nlatitude 24 degrees 15 minutes north, and he would stake his reputation\nas a navigator upon it.\n\n\"Almost exactly the location of Moorshedabad, in Bengal,\" said Cosmo,\nconsulting his chart. \"The mighty peak of Kunchingunga is hardly more\nthan two hundred miles toward the north, and Mount Everest, the highest\npoint in the world, is within a hundred miles of that!\"\n\n\"But you're not going skimming around _them_!\" cried the captain with\nsome alarm.\n\n\"I shall, if the sky continues in its present condition, go as far as\nDarjeeling,\" replied Cosmo. \"Then we can turn eastward and get over\nupper Burmah and so on into China. From there we can turn north again.\n\n\"I think we can manage to get into Tibet somewhere between the ranges.\nIt all depends upon the height of the water, and that I can ascertain\nexactly by getting a close look at Kunchingunga. I would follow the line\nof the Brahmaputra River if I dared, but the way is too beset with\nperils.\"\n\n\"I think you've made a big mistake,\" said the captain. \"Why didn't you\ncome directly across Russia, after first running up to the Black Sea\nfrom the Mediterranean, and so straight into Tibet?\"\n\n\"I begin to think that that's what I ought to have done,\" responded\nCosmo, thoughtfully, \"but when we started the water was not high enough\nto make me sure of that route, and after we got down into Egypt I didn't\nwant to run back. But I guess it would have been better.\"\n\n\"Better a sight than steering among these five-mile peaks,\" growled\nCaptain Arms. \"How high does Darjeeling lie? I don't want to run aground\nagain.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's perfectly safe,\" responded Cosmo. \"Darjeeling is only about\n7,350 feet above the old sea-level. I think we can go almost to the foot\nof Kunchingunga without any danger.\"\n\n\"Well, the name sounds dangerous enough in itself,\" said the captain,\n\"but I suppose you'll have your way. Give me the bearings and we'll be\noff.\"\n\nThey took two days to get to the location of Darjeeling, for at times\nthe sky darkened and the rain came down again in tremendous torrents.\nBut these spells did not last more than two or three hours, and the\nweather cleared between them.\n\nAs soon as they advanced beyond Darjeeling, keeping a sharp outlook for\nKunchingunga, Cosmo began to perceive the error of his calculation of\nthe height of the flood.\n\nThe mountain should still have projected more than three thousand feet\nabove the waves, allowing that the average rise during the thirty-six\ndays since the recommencement of the flood had been six hundred feet a\nday.\n\nBut, in fact, they did not see it at all, and thought at first that it\nhad been totally submerged. At last they found it, a little rocky\nisland, less than two hundred feet above the water, according to Cosmo's\ncareful measure, made from a distance of a quarter of a mile.\n\n\"This is great news for us,\" he exclaimed, as soon as he had completed\nthe work. \"This will save us a long journey round. The water must now\nstand at about 27,900 feet, and although there are a considerable number\nof peaks in the Himalayas approaching such an elevation, there are only\nthree or four known to reach or exceed it, of which Kunchingunga is one.\n\n\"We can, then, run right over the roof of the world, and there we'll be,\nin Tibet. Then we can determine from what side it is safest to approach\nMount Everest, for I am very desirous to get near that celebrated peak,\nand, if possible, see it go under.\"\n\n\"But the weather isn't safe yet,\" objected Captain Arms. \"Suppose we\nshould be caught in another downpour, and everything black about us! I'm\nnot going to navigate this ship by searchlight among mountains\ntwenty-eight thousand feet tall, when the best beam that ever shot from\na mirror won't show an object a hundred fathoms away.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" Cosmo replied, \"we'll circle around south for a few days\nand see what will happen. I think myself that it's not quite over yet.\nThe fact is, I hope it isn't, for now that it has gone so far, I'd like\nto see the top-knot of the earth covered.\"\n\n\"Well, it certainly couldn't do any more harm if it got up as high as\nthe moon,\" responded the captain.\n\nThey spent four days sailing to and fro over India, and during the first\nthree of those days there were intermittent downpours. But the whole of\nthe last period of twenty-four hours was entirely without rain, and the\ncolor of the sky changed so much that Cosmo declared he would wait no\nlonger.\n\n\"Everest,\" he said, \"is only 940 feet higher than Kunchingunga, and it\nmay be sunk out of sight before we can get there.\"\n\n\"Do you think the water is still rising?\" asked De Beauxchamps, while\nKing Richard and Amos Blank listened eagerly for the reply, for now that\nthe weather had cleared, the old company was all assembled on the\nbridge.\n\n\"Yes, slowly,\" said Cosmo. \"There is a perceptible current from the\nnorth which indicates that condensation is still going on there. You'll\nsee that it'll come extremely close to the six miles I predicted before\nit's all over.\"\n\nBy the time they had returned to the neighborhood of the mountains the\nsky had become blue, with only occasionally a passing sunshower, and\nCosmo ordered the promenades to be thrown open, and the passengers, with\ngreat rejoicings, resumed their daily lounging and walking on deck.\n\nIt required a little effort of thought to make them realize their\nsituation, but when they did it grew upon them until they could not\nsufficiently express their wonder.\n\nHere they were, on an almost placid sea, with tepid airs blowing gently\nin their faces, and a scorching sun overhead, whose rays had to be\nshielded off, floating over the highest pinnacles of the roof of the\nworld, the traditional \"Abode of Snow!\"\n\nAll around them, beneath the rippled blue surface, lined here and there\nwith little white windrows of foam, stood submerged peaks, 24,000,\n25,000, 26,000, 27,000, 28,000 feet in elevation! They sailed over their\nsummits and saw them not.\n\nAll began now to sympathize with Cosmo's desire to find Everest before\nit should have disappeared with its giant brothers. Its location was\naccurately known from the Indian government surveys, and Captain Arms\nhad every facility for finding the exact position of the Ark. They\nadvanced slowly toward the northwest, a hundred glasses eagerly scanning\nthe horizon ahead.\n\nFinally, at noon on the third day of their search, the welcome cry of\n\"Land ho!\" came down from the cro'nest. Captain Arms immediately set his\ncourse for the landfall, and in the course of a little more than an hour\nhad it broad abeam.\n\n\"It's Everest, without question,\" said Cosmo. \"It's the crown of the\nworld.\"\n\nBut how strange was its appearance! A reddish-brown mass of rock, rising\nabruptly out of the blue water, really a kind of crown in form, but not\nmore than a couple of square rods in extent, and about three feet high\nat its loftiest point.\n\nThere was no snow, of course, for that had long since disappeared, owing\nto the rise of temperature, and no snow would have fallen in that\nlatitude now, even in mid-winter, because the whole base of the\natmosphere had been lifted up nearly six miles.\n\nSea-level pressures were prevailing where the barometric column would\nonce have dropped almost to the bottom of its tube. It was all that was\nleft of the world!\n\nNorth of them, under the all-concealing ocean, lay the mighty plateau of\nTibet; far toward the east was China, deeply buried with its 500,000,000\nof inhabitants; toward the south lay India, over which they had so long\nbeen sailing; northwestward the tremendous heights of the Pamir region\nand of the Hindu-Kush were sunk beneath the sea.\n\n\"When this enormous peak was covered with snow,\" said Cosmo, \"its height\nwas estimated at 29,002 feet, or almost five and three-quarter miles.\nThe removal of the snow has, of course, lowered it, but I think it\nprobable that this point, being evidently steep on all sides, and of\nvery small area, was so swept by the wind that the snow was never very\ndeep upon it.\n\n\"If we allow ten, or even twenty feet for the snow, the height of this\nrock cannot be much less than 29,000 feet above the former sea-level.\nBut I do not dare to approach closer, because Everest had a broad\nsummit, and we might possibly ground upon a sharp ridge.\"\n\n\"And you are sure that the water is still rising?\" asked De Beauxchamps\nagain.\n\n\"Watch and you will see,\" Cosmo responded.\n\nThe Ark was kept circling very slowly within a furlong of the rocky\ncrown, and everybody who had a glass fixed his eyes upon it.\n\n\"The peak is certainly sinking,\" said De Beauxchamps at last. \"I believe\nit has gone down three inches in the last fifteen minutes.\"\n\n\"Keep your eyes fixed on some definite point,\" said Cosmo to the others\nwho were looking, \"and you will easily note the rise of the water.\"\n\nThey watched it until nobody felt any doubt. Inch by inch the crown of\nthe world was going under. In an hour Cosmo's instruments showed that\nthe highest point had settled to a height of but two feet above the sea.\n\n\"But when will the elevation that you have predicted begin?\" asked one.\n\n\"Its effects will not become evident immediately,\" Cosmo replied. \"It\nmay possibly already have begun, but if so, it is masked by the\ncontinued rise of the water.\"\n\n\"And how long shall we have to wait for the re-emergence of Tibet?\"\n\n\"I cannot tell, but it will be a long time. But do not worry about that.\nWe have plenty of provisions, and the weather will continue fine after\nthe departure of the nebula.\"\n\nThey circled about until only a foot or so of the rock remained above\nthe reach of the gently washing waves. Suddenly struck by a happy\nthought, De Beauxchamps exclaimed:\n\n\"I must have a souvenir from the crown of the disappearing world. M.\nVers\u00e1l, will you permit me to land upon it with one of your boats?\"\n\nDe Beauxchamps's suggestion was greeted with cheers, and twenty others\nimmediately expressed a desire to go.\n\n\"No,\" said Cosmo to the eager applicants, \"it is M. De Beauxchamps's\nidea; let him go alone. Yes,\" he continued, addressing the Frenchman,\n\"you can have a boat, and I will send two men with you to manage it.\nYou'd better hurry, or there will be nothing left to land upon.\"\n\nThe necessary orders were quickly given, and in five minutes De\nBeauxchamps, watched by envious eyes, was rapidly approaching the\ndisappearing rock. They saw him scramble out upon it, and they gave a\nmighty cheer as he waved his hand at them.\n\nHe had taken a hammer with him, and with breathless interest they\nwatched him pounding and prying about the rock. They could see that he\nselected the very highest point for his operations.\n\nWhile he worked away, evidently filling his pockets, the interest of the\nonlookers became more and more intense.\n\n\"Look out!\" they presently began to shout at him, \"you will be caught by\nthe water.\"\n\nBut he paid no attention, working with feverish rapidity. Suddenly the\nwatchers saw a little ripple break over the last speck of dry land on\nthe globe, and De Beauxchamps standing up to his shoe-laces in water.\nCries of dismay came from the Ark. De Beauxchamps now gave over his\nwork, and, with apparent reluctance, entered the boat, which was rowed\nclose up to the place where he was standing.\n\nAs the returning boat approached the Ark, another volley of cheers broke\nforth, and the Frenchman, standing up to his full height, waved with a\ntriumphant air something that sparkled brilliantly in the sunshine.\n\n\"I congratulate you, M. De Beauxchamps,\" cried Cosmo, as the adventurer\nscrambled aboard. \"You have stood where no human foot has ever been\nbefore, and I see that you have secured your souvenir of the world that\nwas.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" responded De Beauxchamps exultantly, \"and see what it is--a\nworthy decoration for such a coronet.\"\n\nHe held up his prize, amid exclamations of astonishment and admiration\nfrom those who were near enough to see it.\n\n\"The most beautiful specimen of amethyst I ever beheld!\" cried a\nmineralogist enthusiastically, taking it from De Beauxchamps's hand.\n\"What was the rock?\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, I am no mineralogist,\" replied the Frenchman, \"and I\ncannot tell you, but these gems were abundant. I could have almost\nfilled the boat if I had had time.\n\n\"The amethyst,\" he added gayly, \"is the traditional talisman against\nintoxication, but, although these adorned her tiara, the poor old world\nhas drunk her fill.\"\n\n\"But it is only water,\" said Cosmo, smiling.\n\n\"Too much, at any rate,\" returned the Frenchman.\n\n\"I should say,\" continued the mineralogist, \"that the rock was some\nvariety of syenite, from its general appearance.\"\n\n\"I know nothing of that,\" replied De Beauxchamps, \"but I have the jewels\nof the terrestrial queen, and,\" he continued gallantly, \"I shall have\nthe pleasure of bestowing them upon the ladies.\"\n\nHe emptied his pockets, and found that he had enough to give every woman\naboard the Ark a specimen, with several left over for some of the men,\nCosmo, of course, being one of the recipients.\n\n\"There,\" said De Beauxchamps, as he handed the stone to Cosmo, \"there is\na memento from the Gaurisankar.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon--Mount Everest, if you please,\" interposed Edward\nWhistlington.\n\n\"No,\" responded the Frenchman stoutly, \"it is the Gaurisankar. Why will\nyou English persist in renaming everything in the world? Gaurisankar is\nthe native name, and, in my opinion, far more appropriate and euphonious\nthan Everest.\"\n\nThis discussion was not continued, for now everybody became interested\nin the movements of the Ark. Cosmo had decided that it would be safe to\napproach close to the point where the last peak of the mountain had\ndisappeared.\n\nCautiously they drew nearer and nearer, until, looking through the\nwonderfully transparent water, they caught sight of a vast precipice\ndescending with frightful steepness, down and down, until all was lost\nin the profundity beneath.\n\nThe point on which De Beauxchamps had landed was now covered so deep\nthat the water had ceased to swirl about it, but lay everywhere in an\nunbroken sheet, which was every moment becoming more placid and\nrefulgent in the sunshine.\n\nThe world was drowned at last! As they looked abroad over the convex\nsurface, they thought, with a shudder, that now the earth, seen from\nspace, was only a great, glassy ball, mirroring the sun and the stars.\n\nBut they were ignorant of what had happened far in the west!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nTHE FRENCHMAN'S NEW SCHEME\n\n\nAfter the disappearance of Mt. Everest, Cosmo Vers\u00e1l made a careful\nmeasurement of the depth of water on the peak, which he found to be\nforty feet, and then decided to cruise eastward with the Ark, sailing\nslowly, and returning after a month to see whether by that time there\nwould be any indications of the reappearance of land.\n\nNo part of his extraordinary theory of the deluge was more\nrevolutionary, or scientifically incredible, than this idea that the\ncontinents would gradually emerge again, owing to internal stresses set\nup in the crust of the earth.\n\nThis, he anticipated, would be caused by the tremendous pressure of the\nwater, which must be ten or twelve miles deep over the greatest\ndepressions of the old ocean-bottoms. He expected that geological\nmovements would attend the intrusion of the water into subterranean\ncavities and into the heated magma under volcanic regions.\n\nHe often debated the question with the savants aboard the Ark, and,\ndespite their incredulity, he persisted in his opinion. He could not be\nshaken, either, in his belief that the first land to emerge would be the\nHimalayas, the Pamirs, and the plateau of Tibet.\n\n\"We may have to wait some years before any considerable area is\nexposed,\" he admitted, \"but it must not be forgotten that what land does\nfirst appear above the water will lie at the existing sea-level, and\nwill have an oceanic climate, suitable for the rapid development of\nplants.\n\n\"We have aboard all things needed for quick cultivation, and in one\nseason we could begin to raise crops.\"\n\n\"But at first,\" said Professor Jeremiah Moses, \"only mountain tops will\nemerge, and how can you expect to cultivate them?\"\n\n\"There is every probability,\" replied Cosmo, \"that even the rocks of a\nmountain will be sufficiently friable after their submergence to be\nreadily reduced to the state of soil, especially with the aid of the\nchemical agents which I have brought along, and I have no fear that I\ncould not, in a few weeks, make even the top of Everest fertile.\n\n\"I anticipate, in fact, that it will be on that very summit that we\nshall begin the re-establishment of the race. Then, as the plateaus\nbelow come to the surface, we can gradually descend and enlarge the\nfield of our operations.\"\n\n\"Suppose Everest should be turned into a volcano?\"\n\n\"That cannot happen,\" said Cosmo. \"A volcano is built up by the\nextrusion of lava and cinders from below, and these cannot break forth\nat the top of a mountain already formed, especially when that mountain\nhas no volcanic chimney and no crater, and Everest had neither.\"\n\n\"If the lowering of the flood that caused our stranding on a mountain\ntop in Sicily was due to the absorption of water into the interior of\nthe crust, why may not that occur again, and thus bring the Himalayas\ninto view, without any rising on their part?\" demanded Professor Moses.\n\n\"I think,\" said Cosmo, \"that all the water that could enter the crust\nhas already done so, during the time that the depression of level which\nso surprised us was going on. Now we must wait for geologic changes,\nresulting from the gradual yielding of the internal mass to the new\nforces brought to bear upon it.\n\n\"As the whole earth has gained in _weight_ by the condensation of the\nnebula upon it, its plastic crust will proportionally gain in _girth_ by\ninternal expansion, which will finally bring all the old continents to\nthe surface, but Asia first of all.\"\n\nWhether Cosmo Vers\u00e1l's hypotheses were right or wrong, he always had a\nreply to any objection, and the prestige which he had gained by his\ndisastrously correct theory about the watery nebula gave him an\nadvantage so enormous that nobody felt enough confidence in himself to\nstand long against anything that he might advance.\n\nAccordingly, everybody in the Ark found himself looking forward to the\nre-emergence of Mount Everest almost as confidently as did their leader,\nCosmo Vers\u00e1l.\n\nThey began their waiting voyage by sailing across the plateau of Tibet\nand the lofty chain of the Yung-ling Mountains out over China.\n\nThe interest of all aboard was excited to the highest degree when they\nfound themselves sailing over the mighty domains of the Chinese\nPresident-Emperor, who had developed an enormous power, making him the\nruler of the whole eastern world.\n\nHe, with his half-billion or more of subjects, now reposed at the bottom\nof an ocean varying from three to five or six miles in depth. Deep\nbeneath the Ark lay the broad and once populous valleys of the\nYangtse-Kiang and the Hoang-Ho, the \"Scourge of China.\"\n\nFinally they swung round northward and re-entered the region of Tibet,\nseeking once more the drowned crown of the world. In the meantime Cosmo\nhad had the theatrical exhibitions and the concerts resumed in the\nevenings, and sometimes there was music, and even dancing on the long\npromenades, open to the outer air.\n\nLet not that be a matter of surprise or blame, for the spirit of joy in\nlife is unconquerable, as it should be if life is worth while. So it\nhappened that, not infrequently, and not with any blameworthy intention,\nor in any spirit of heartless forgetfulness, this remarkable company of\nworld-wanderers drifted, in the moonlight, above the universal watery\ngrave of the drowned millions, with the harmonies of stringed\ninstruments stealing out upon the rippling waves, and the soft sound of\nswiftly shuffling feet tripping over the smooth decks.\n\nCostak\u00e9 Theriade and Sir Wilfrid Athelstone resumed their stormy efforts\nto talk each other down, but now even Cosmo was seldom a listener,\nexcept when he had to interfere to keep the peace.\n\nKing Richard and Amos Blank, however, usually heard them out, but it was\nevident from their expressions that they enjoyed the prospective\nfisticuffs rather more than the exposition of strange scientific\ndoctrines.\n\nPerhaps the happiest man aboard was Captain Arms. At last he could make\nas many and as certain observations as he chose, and he studied the\ncharts of Asia until he declared that now he knew the latitude and\nlongitude of the mountains better than he did those of the seaports of\nthe old oceans.\n\nHe had not the least difficulty in finding the location of Mount Everest\nagain, and when he announced that they were floating over it, Cosmo\nimmediately prepared to make another measurement of the depth of water\non the peak. The result was hardly gratifying. He found that it had\ndiminished but four inches. He said to Captain Arms:\n\n\"The range is rising, but less rapidly than I hoped. Even if the present\nrate should be doubled it would require five years for the emergence of\nthe highest point. Instead of remaining in this part of the world we\nshall have an abundance of time to voyage round the earth, going\nleisurely, and when we get back again perhaps there will be enough land\nvisible to give us a good start.\"\n\n\"Mr. Vers\u00e1l,\" said the captain, \"you remember that you promised me that\nI should drop my anchor on the head of Mount Everest if I worked a\ntraverse across Beluchistan.\"\n\n\"Certainly I remember it; and also that you were not much disposed to\nundertake the task. However, you did it well, and I suppose that now you\nwant me to fulfill the bargain?\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" replied the captain. \"I'd just like to get a mud-hook in the\ntop-knot of the earth. I reckon that that'll lay over all the sea yarns\never spun.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" returned Cosmo. \"Try it, if you've got cable enough.\"\n\n\"Enough and to spare,\" cried the captain, \"and I'll have the\nGaurisankar, as the Frenchman calls it, hooked in a jiffy.\"\n\nThis was an operation which called everybody to the rails to watch\nit. Hundreds of eyes tried to follow the anchor as it descended\nperpendicularly upon the mountain-top, nearly forty feet beneath.\nThrough the clear water they could dimly see the dark outline of the\nsummit below, and they gazed at it with wonder, and a sort of terror.\n\nSomehow they felt that never before had they fully appreciated the awful\ndepths over which they had been floating. The anchor steadily dropped\nuntil it rested on the rock.\n\nIt got a hold finally, and in a few minutes the great vessel was\nswinging slowly round, held by a cable whose grasp was upon the top of\nthe world! When the sensation had been sufficiently enjoyed the anchor\nwas tripped, and the nose of the Ark was turned northwestward. Cosmo\nVers\u00e1l announced his intention to circumnavigate the drowned globe.\n\nThe news of what they were about to do was both welcome and saddening to\nthe inmates of the vessel. They wished to pass once more over the lands\nwhere they had first seen the light, and at the same time they dreaded\nthe memories that such a voyage would inevitably bring back with\noverwhelming force. But, at any rate, it would be better than drifting\nfor years over Tibet and China.\n\nWhile everybody else was discussing the prospects of the new voyage, and\nwondering how long it would last, Yves de Beauxchamps was concentrating\nall his attention upon a new project which had sprung up in his active\nmind as soon as Cosmo's intention was announced. He took Cosmo aside and\nsaid to him:\n\n\"M. Vers\u00e1l, the dearest memory that I have treasured in my heart is that\nof the last sight of my drowned home, my beautiful dead Paris. It may be\nthat the home-loving instincts of my race arouse in me a melancholy\npleasure over such a sight which would not be shared by you, of a\ndifferent blood; but if, perchance, you do share my feelings on this\nsubject I believe that I can promise you a similar visit to the great\nmetropolis where your life began, and where you executed those labors\nwhose result has been to preserve a remnant of humanity to repeople the\nearth.\"\n\nCosmo Vers\u00e1l's quick intelligence instantly comprehended the Frenchman's\ndesign, but it startled him, and apparently insuperable difficulties at\nonce occurred to his mind.\n\n\"M. De Beauxchamps,\" he responded, grasping his friend warmly by the\nhand, \"I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your amiable\nintention, and I assure you that nothing could afford me greater\nsatisfaction than to see once more that mighty city, even though it can\nnow be but an awful ruin, tenanted by no life except the terrible\ncreatures of the deep. But, while I foresee what your plan must be, I\ncan hardly conceive that its execution could be possible. You are\nthinking, of course, of constructing a diving apparatus capable of\npenetrating to a depth of nearly six miles in the sea. Setting aside the\nquestion whether we could find in the stores of the Ark the materials\nthat would be needed, it appears to me most improbable that we could\nmake the apparatus of sufficient strength to withstand the pressure, and\ncould then cause it to sink to so great a depth, and afterward bring it\nsafely to the surface.\"\n\nThe Frenchman smiled.\n\n\"M. Vers\u00e1l,\" he replied, \"I have taken the liberty to look over the\nstock of materials which you have so wisely prepared for possible\nrepairs to the Ark and for use after the Ark lands, and I know that\namong them I can find all that I shall need. You yourself know how\ncompletely you are provided with engineering tools and machines of all\nkinds. You have even an electric foundry aboard. With the aid of your\nmechanical genius, and the skill of your assistants, together with that\nof my own men, who are accustomed to work of this kind, I have not the\nfaintest doubt that I can design and construct a diving-bell, large\nenough to contain a half-dozen persons, and perfectly capable of\npenetrating to any depth. Of course I cannot make it of levium, but you\nhave a sufficient supply of herculeum steel, the strength of which is so\nimmense that the walls of the bell can be made to remit the pressure\neven at a depth of six miles. From my previous experiments I am\nconfident that there will be no difficulty in sinking and afterward\nraising this apparatus. It is only necessary that the mean specific\ngravity of the bell shall be greater than that of the water at a given\ndepth, and you know that as far back as the end of the nineteenth\ncentury your own countrymen sent down sounding apparatus more than six\nmiles in the Pacific Ocean, near the island of Guam.\"\n\n\"But the air inside the bell--\" Cosmo began.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" interrupted De Beauxchamps, \"but that air need be under no\ngreater pressure than at the surface. I shall know how to provide for\nthat. Remember the _Jules Verne_. Simply give me _carte blanche_ in this\nmatter, let me have the materials to work with, afford me the advantage\nof your advice and assistance whenever I shall need them, and I promise\nyou that by the time we have arrived over the site of New York we shall\nbe prepared for the descent.\"\n\nCosmo was deeply impressed by the Frenchman's enthusiastic\nself-confidence. He had a great admiration for the constructor of the\n_Jules Verne_, and, besides, the proposed adventure was exactly after\nhis own heart. After meditating a while, he said heartily:\n\n\"Well, M. De Beauxchamps, I give my consent. Everything you wish shall\nbe at your disposal, and you can begin as soon as you choose. Only, let\nthe thing be kept a secret between us and the workmen who are employed.\nIf it should turn out a failure it would not do that the people in the\nArk should be aware of it. I can give you a working room on one of the\nlower decks, where there will be no interference with your proceedings,\nand no knowledge of what you are about can leak out.\"\n\n\"That is exactly what I should wish,\" returned De Beauxchamps, smiling\nwith delight, \"and I renew my promise that you shall not be\ndisappointed.\"\n\nSo, without a suspicion of what was going on entering the minds of any\nperson in the great company outside the small company of men who were\nactually employed in the work, the construction of De Beauxchamps's\ngreat diving-bell was begun, and pushed with all possible speed,\nconsistent with the proper execution of the work. In the meantime the\nArk continued its course toward the west.\n\nThey ran slowly, for there was no hurry, and the Ark had now become to\nits inhabitants as a house and a home--their only foothold on the whole\nround earth, and that but a little floating island of buoyant metal.\nThey crossed the Pamirs and the Hindu-Kush, the place where the Caspian\nSea had been swallowed up in the universal ocean, and ran over Ararat,\nwhich three months before had put them into such fearful danger, but\nwhose loftiest summit now lay twelve thousand feet beneath their keel.\n\nAt length, after many excursions toward the north and toward the south,\nin the halcyon weather that had seldom failed since the withdrawal of\nthe nebula, they arrived at the place (or above it) which had stood\nduring centuries for a noon-mark on the globe.\n\nIt was midday when Captain Arms, having made his observations, said to\nCosmo and the others on the bridge:\n\n\"Noon at Greenwich, and noon on the Ark. Latitude, fifty-one degrees\nthirty minutes. That brings you as nearly plumb over the place as you'd\nbe likely to hit it. Right down there lies the old observatory that set\nthe chronometers of the world, and kept the clocks and watches up to\ntheir work.\"\n\nKing Richard turned aside upon hearing the captain's words. They brought\na too vivid picture of the great capital, six miles under their feet,\nand a too poignant recollection of the disastrous escape of the royal\nfamily from overwhelmed London seven months before.\n\nAs reckoned by the almanac, it was the 15th of September, more than\nsixteen months since Cosmo had sent out his first warning to the public,\nwhen the Ark crossed the meridian of seventy-four degrees west, in about\nforty-one degrees north latitude, and the adventurers knew that New York\nwas once more beneath them.\n\nThere was great emotion among both passengers and crew, for the majority\nof them had either dwelt in New York or been in some way associated with\nits enterprises and its people, and, vain as must be the hope of seeing\nany relic of the buried metropolis, every eye was on the alert.\n\nThey looked off across the boundless sea in every direction,\ninterrogating every suspicious object on the far horizon, and even\npeering curiously into the blue abyss, as if something might suddenly\nappear there which would speak to them like a voice from the past.\n\nBut they saw only shafts of sunlight running into bottomless depths, and\noccasionally some oceanic creature floating lazily far below. The color\nof the sea was wonderful. It had attracted their attention after the\nsubmergence of Mount Everest, but at that time it had not yet assumed\nits full splendor.\n\nAt first, no doubt, there was considerable dissolved matter in the\nwater, but gradually this settled, and the sea became bluer and\nbluer--not the deep indigo of the old ocean, but a much lighter and more\nbrilliant hue--and here, over the site of New York, the waters were of a\nbright, luminous sapphire, that dazzled the eye.\n\nCosmo declared that the change of the sea-color was undoubtedly due to\nsome quality in the nebula from whose condensation the water had been\nproduced, but neither his own analyses, nor those of the chemists aboard\nthe Ark, were able to detect the subtle element to whose presence the\npeculiar tint was due.\n\nBut whatever it may have been, it imparted to the ocean an ethereal,\nimponderous look, which was sometimes startling. There were moments when\nthey almost expected to see it expand back into the nebulous form and\nfly away.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nNEW YORK IN HER OCEAN TOMB\n\n\nDuring the long voyage from the sunken Himalayas to still deeper sunken\nNew York, De Beauxchamps, with his fellow-countrymen and the skilled\nmechanics assigned by Cosmo Vers\u00e1l to aid them, had finished the\nconstruction of the huge diving-bell. No one not in the secret had the\nslightest idea of what had been done, owing to the remote situation of\nthe deck on which the construction was carried out.\n\nNow, while a thousand pairs of eyes were interrogating the smooth\nsurface of the sea, and striving to penetrate its cerulean depths, a\ngreat surprise was sprung upon the passengers. The rear gangway of the\nlowest deck was cleared, a heavy crane-like beam was set projecting over\nthe water, and men began to rig a flexible cable, which had been\nspecially prepared for the purpose of lowering the bell into the depths,\nand of raising it again when the adventurers should wish to return to\nthe surface. Everybody's attention was immediately attracted to these\nstrange preparations, and the utmost curiosity was aroused. A chorus of\nwondering exclamations broke out when a metallic globe, twenty feet in\ndiameter, and polished until it shone like a giant thermometer bulb, was\nrolled out and carefully attached to the cable by means of a strong ring\nset in one side of the bell. The excitement of the passengers would soon\nhave become uncontrollable if Cosmo had not at this point summoned the\nentire ship's company into the great saloon. As soon as all were\nassembled he mounted his dais and began to speak.\n\n\"My fellow-citizens of the old world, which has perished, and of the\nnew, which is to take its place,\" he said, \"we owe to the genius of M.\nDe Beauxchamps an apparatus which is about to enable us to inspect, by\nan actual visit, the remains of the vast metropolis, which we saw in all\nits majesty and beauty but so few months ago, and which now lies forever\nsilent at the bottom of this universal ocean.\n\n\"If it were practicable I should wish to afford to every one of you a\nfarewell glimpse of that mighty city, to which the hearts of so many\nhere are bound, but you can readily understand that that would be\nimpossible. Only six persons can go in this exploring bell, and they\nhave been chosen; but a faithful account will be brought back to you of\nall that they see and learn. The adventuring company will consist of M.\nDe Beauxchamps, M. Pujol, his first assistant, Mr. Amos Blank, King\nRichard, Professor Abel Able, and myself. Captain Arms has ascertained\nthe location of the center of Manhattan Island, over which we are now\nfloating. The quietness of the sea, the absence of any apparent current,\nand the serenity of the heavens are favoring circumstances, which may be\nrelied upon to enable Captain Arms to keep the Ark constantly poised\nalmost precisely over our point of descent. It is not possible to\npredict the exact duration of our absence in the depths, but it will\nnot, in any case, exceed about twenty hours.\n\n\"Once arrived at the bottom, nearly six miles down, we shall attach the\ncable to some secure anchorage, by means of a radio-control, operated\nfrom within the bell, and then, with the bell free, we shall make\nexplorations, as extensive as possible. The radio-control of which I\nhave spoken governs also the attachment of the cable to the bell. This\nappliance has been prepared and tested with such care that we have no\ndoubt of its entire efficiency. I mention these things in order to\nremove from your minds any fear as to the success of our enterprise.\n\n\"The bell being once detached, we shall be able to move it from point to\npoint by means of a pair of small propellers, which you will perceive on\nthe outside of the bell, and which are also controlled from within.\nThese will be used to increase our speed of descent. From a calculation\nof the density of the sea-water at the depth to which we shall descend,\nwe estimate that the bell with its contents will press upon the bottom\nwith a gravitational force of only five pounds, so that it will move\nwith very slight effort, and may even, when in motion, float like a\nfish.\n\n\"For the purposes of observation we have provided, on four sides of the\nbell, a series of circular windows, with glass of immense thickness and\nstrength, but of extraordinary transparency. Through these windows we\nshall be able to see in almost all directions. It was our intention to\nprovide wireless telephone apparatus with which we might have kept you\ninformed of all our doings and discoveries, but unfortunately we have\nfound it impracticable to utilize our control for that purpose. We\nshall, however, be able to send and receive signals as long as we are\nconnected with the cable.\n\n\"I should add that the construction of the bell, although suggested by\nM. De Beauxchamps immediately after our departure from Mount Everest,\nhas been carried on in secret simply because we did not wish to subject\nyou to the immense disappointment which you would certainly have\nexperienced if this brilliant conception of our gifted friend, after\nbeing once made known to you, had proved to be a failure. Our\npreparations have all been made, and within an hour we shall begin the\ndescent.\"\n\nIt is quite impossible to describe the excitement of the passengers\nwhile they listened to this extraordinary communication. When Cosmo\nVers\u00e1l had finished speaking he stood for some minutes looking at his\naudience with a triumphant smile. First a murmur of excited voices\narose, and then somebody proposed three cheers, which were given and\nrepeated until the levium dome rang with the reverberations. Nobody knew\nexactly why he was cheering, but the infectious enthusiasm carried\neverything before it. Then the crowd began to ask questions, addressed\nnot to Cosmo but to one another. The wildest suggestions were made. One\nwoman who had left some treasured heirlooms in a Fifth Avenue mansion\ndemanded of her husband that he should commission Cosmo Vers\u00e1l to\nrecover them.\n\n\"I'm sure they're there,\" she insisted. \"They were locked in the safe.\"\n\n\"But, don't you see,\" protested the poor man, \"he can't get outside of\nthat bell to get 'em.\"\n\n\"I don't see _why_ he can't, if he should really try. I think it's too\nmean! They were my grandmother's jewels.\"\n\n\"But, my dear, how could he get out?\"\n\n\"Well, _how does he get in?_ What's his radio-control good for; won't\nthat help him? What is he going down there for if he can't do a little\nthing like that, to oblige?\"\n\nShe pouted at her husband because he persistently refused to present her\nrequest to Cosmo, and declared that she would do it herself, then, for\nshe must have those jewels, now that they were so near.\n\nBut Cosmo was saved from this, and other equally unreasonable demands,\nby a warning from De Beauxchamps that all was ready, and that no time\nshould be lost. Then everybody hastened out on the decks to watch the\ndeparture of the adventurers. Many thoughtfully shook their heads,\npredicting that they would never be seen again. As soon as this feeling\nbegan to prevail the enthusiasm quickly evaporated, and efforts were\nmade to dissuade Cosmo and De Beauxchamps from making the attempt. But\nthey were deaf to all remonstrance, and pushing out of the chattering\ncrowd, Cosmo ordered the gangway about the bell to be cleared of all\nbystanders. The opposition heated his blood a little, and he began to\nbear himself with an air which recalled his aspect when he quelled and\npunished the mutiny. This was enough to silence instantly every objector\nto his proceedings. Henceforth they kept their thoughts to themselves,\nalthough some muttered, under their breath such epithets as \"fool\" and\n\"harebrain.\"\n\nIn about half an hour after Cosmo's speech the bell, with its hardy\nexplorers safely inclosed within, was lowered away, and a minute later\nhundreds were craning their necks over the rails to watch the shining\nglobe engulf itself swiftly in the sapphire depths. It was about nine\no'clock in the morning when the descent was begun, and for a long time,\nso remarkable was the transparency of the water, they could see the bell\nsinking, and becoming smaller until it resembled a blue pearl. Sometimes\na metallic flash shot from its polished sides like a gleam of violet\nlightning. But at length it passed from view, swallowed up in the\ntremendous watery chasm.\n\nWe turn now to trace the adventures of the bell and its inmates as they\nentered the awful twilight of the ocean, and, sinking deeper, passed\ngradually into a profundity which the sun's most powerful rays were\nunable to penetrate. Fortunately every one of the adventurers left a\ndescription of his experiences and sensations, so that there is no lack\nof authentic information to guide us.\n\nThe windows, as Cosmo had said, were so arranged that they afforded\nviews on all sides. These views were, of course, restricted by the\ncombined effects of the smallness of the windows and their great\nthickness; the inmates were somewhat like prisoners looking out of round\nports cut through massive walls, but the range of view was much widened\nwhen they placed themselves close to the glasses, because the latter\nwere in the form of truncated cones with the base outward.\n\nGlancing through the ports on the upper side of the bell Cosmo and his\ncompanions could perceive the huge form of the Ark, hanging like a cloud\nabove them, but rapidly receding, while from the side ports they saw\ngreat shafts of azure sunlight, thrown into wonderful undulations by the\ndisturbance of the water. These soon became fainter and gradually\ndisappeared, but before the gloom of the depths settled about them they\nwere thrilled by the spectacle of sharks and other huge fishes nosing\nabout the outer side of the transparent cones, and sometimes opening\ntheir jaws as if trying to seize them. Most of the cone-shaped windows\nhad flat surfaces, but a few were of spherical outline both without and\nwithin, and the radius of curvature had been so calculated that these\nparticular windows served as huge magnifying lenses for an eye placed at\na given distance. Once or twice a marine monster happened to place\nhimself in the field of one of these magnifying windows, startling the\nobservers almost out of their senses with his frightful appearance.\n\nThere were also four windows reserved for projecting a searchlight into\nthe outer darkness. The inner side of the bell corresponded in curvature\nwith the outer, so that the adventurers had no flat flooring on any side\nto stand upon, but this caused little inconvenience, since the walls\nwere abundantly provided with hand and foot holds, enabling the inmates\nto maintain themselves in almost any position they could wish.\n\nAfter a while they passed below the range of daylight, and then they\nturned on the searchlight. The storage batteries which supplied energy\nfor the searchlight and the propellers served also to operate an\napparatus for clearing the air of carbonic acid, and De Beauxchamps had\ncarefully calculated the limit of time that the air could be kept in a\nbreathable condition. This did not exceed forty-eight hours--but as we\nhave seen they had no intention of remaining under water longer than\ntwenty hours at the utmost.\n\nWhen the bell entered the night of the sea-depths they passed into an\napparently lifeless zone, where the searchlight, projected now on one\nside and now on another, revealed no more of the living forms which they\nhad encountered above, but showed only a desert of solid transparent\nwater. Here, amid this awful isolation, they experienced for the first\ntime a feeling of dread and terror. An overpowering sense of loneliness\nand helplessness came over them, and only the stout heart of Cosmo\nVers\u00e1l, and his reassuring words, kept the others from making the signal\nwhich would have caused the bell to be hastily drawn back to the Ark.\n\n\"M. De Beauxchamps,\" said Cosmo, breaking the impressive silence, \"to\nwhat depth have we now descended?\"\n\n\"A thousand fathoms,\" replied the Frenchman, consulting his automatic\nregister.\n\n\"Good! We have been only thirty minutes in reaching this depth. We shall\nsink more slowly as we get deeper, but I think we can count upon\nreaching the bottom in not more than four hours from the moment of our\ndeparture. It will require only two hours for them to draw us back again\nwith the powerful engines of the Ark, especially when aided by our\npropellers. This will leave fourteen hours for our explorations, if we\nstay out the limit that we have fixed.\"\n\nThere was such an air of confidence in Cosmo's manner and words that\nthis simple statement did much to enhearten the others.\n\n\"The absence of life in this part of the sea,\" Cosmo continued\ncheerfully, \"does not surprise me. It has long been known that the life\nof the ocean is confined to regions near the surface and the bottom. We\nshall certainly find plenty of wonderful creatures below.\"\n\nWhen they knew that they must be near the bottom they turned the light\ndownward, and every available window was occupied by an eager watcher.\nPresently a cry of \"Look! Look there!\" broke from several voices at\nonce.\n\nThe searchlight, penetrating far through the clear water beneath the\nbell, fell in a circle round a most remarkable object--tall, gaunt, and\nspectral, with huge black ribs.\n\n\"Why, it's the Metropolitan tower, still standing!\" cried Amos Blank.\n\"Who would have believed it possible?\"\n\n\"No doubt there was some lucky circumstance about its anchorage,\"\nreturned Cosmo. \"Although it was built so long ago, it was made\nimmensely strong, and well braced, and as the water did not undermine it\nat the start, it has been favored by the very density of that which now\nsurrounds it, and which tends to buoy it up and hold it steady. But you\nobserve that it has been stripped of the covering of stone.\"\n\n\"Would it not be well to utilize it for anchoring the cable?\" asked De\nBeauxchamps.\n\n\"We could have nothing better,\" said Cosmo.\n\nDe Beauxchamps immediately called to the Ark, and directed the movements\nof those in charge of the drum of the cable so nicely that the descent\nceased at the exact moment when the bell came to rest upon a group of\nbeams at the top of the tower. The radio-control, which is so familiar\nin its thousand applications to-day, was then a new thing, having been\ninvented only a year or so before the deluge, and De Beauxchamps's form\nof the apparatus was crude. The underlying principle, however, was the\nsame as that now employed--transmission through a metallic wall of\nimpulses capable of being turned into mechanic energy. With its aid they\nhad no difficulty in detaching the cable from the bell, but it required\nsome careful maneuvering to secure a satisfactory attachment to the\nbeams of the tower. At last, however, this was effected, and immediately\nthey set out for their exploration of drowned New York.\n\nThey began with the skeleton tower itself, which had only once or twice\nbeen exceeded in height by the famous structures of the era of\nskyscrapers. In some places they found the granite skin yet _in situ_,\nbut almost everywhere it had been stripped off, probably by the\ntremendous waves which swept over it as the flood attained its first\nthousand feet of elevation. They saw no living forms, except a few\ncuriously shaped phosphorescent creatures of no great size, which\nscurried away out of the beam of the search-light. They saw no trace of\nthe millions of their fellow-beings who had been swallowed up in this\nvast grave, and for this all secretly gave thanks. The soil of Madison\nSquare had evidently been washed away, for no signs of the trees which\nhad once shaded it were seen, and a reddish ooze had begun to collect\nupon the exposed rocks. All around were the shattered ruins of other\ngreat buildings, some, like the Metropolitan tower, yet retaining their\nsteel skeletons, others tumbled down, and lying half-buried in the ooze.\n\nFinding nothing of great interest in this neighborhood they turned the\ncourse of the bell northward, passing everywhere over interminable\nruins, and as soon as they began to skirt the ridge of Morningside\nHeights the huge form of the cathedral of St. John fell within the\ncircle of projected light. It was unroofed, and some of the walls had\nfallen, but some of the immense arches yet retained their upright\nposition. Here, for the first time, they encountered the real giants of\nthe submarine depths. De Beauxchamps, who had seen some of these\ncreatures during his visit to Paris in the _Jules Verne_, declared that\nnothing which he had seen there was so terrifying as what they now\nbeheld. One creature, which seemed to be the unresisted master of this\nkingdom of phosphorescent life, appears to have exceeded in strangeness\nthe utmost descriptive powers of all those who looked upon it, for their\nwritten accounts are filled with ejaculations, and are more or less\ninconsistent with one another. The reader gathers from them, however,\nthe general impression that it made upon their astonished minds.\n\nThe creatures were of a livid hue, and had the form of a globe, as large\nas the bell itself, with a valvular opening on one side which was\nevidently a mouth, surrounded with a circle of eyelike disks, projecting\nshafts of self-evolved light into the water. They moved about with\nsurprising ease, rising and sinking at will, sometimes rolling along the\ncurve of an arch, emitting flashes of green fire, and occasionally\ndarting across the intervening spaces in pursuit of their prey, which\nconsisted of smaller prosphorescent animals that fled in the utmost\nconsternation. When the adventurers in the bell saw one of the globular\nmonsters seize its victim they were filled with horror. It had driven\nits prey into a corner of the wrecked choir, and suddenly it flattened\nitself like a rubber bulb pressed against the wall, completely covering\nthe creature that was to be devoured, although the effect of its\nstruggles could be perceived; and then, to the amazement of the\nonlookers, the living globe slowly turned itself inside out, engulfing\nthe victim in the process.\n\n\"Great heavens,\" exclaimed Professor Abel Able, \"it is a gigantic\n_hydroid polyps!_ That is precisely the way in which those little\ncreatures swallow their prey; outside becomes inside, what was the\nsurface of the body is turned into the lining of the digestive cavity,\nand every time they take a meal the process of introversion is repeated.\nThis monster is nothing but a huge self-sustaining maw!\"\n\n\"_Tr\u00e8s bien_,\" exclaimed De Beauxchamps, with a slight laugh, \"and he\nfinds himself in New York, quite _chez soi_.\"\n\nNobody appeared to notice the sarcasm, and, in any case they would\nquickly have forgotten it, for no sooner had the tragic spectacle which\nthey had witnessed been finished than they suddenly found the bell\nsurrounded by a crowd of the globe-shaped creatures, jostling one\nanother, and flattening themselves against its metallic walls. They\npushed the bell about, rolling themselves all over it, and apparently\nfinding nothing terrifying in the searchlight, which was hardly brighter\nthan the phosphorescent gleams which shot from their own luminescent\norgans. One of them got one of its luminous disks exactly in the field\nof a magnifying window, and King Richard, who happened to have his eye\nin the focus, started back with a cry of alarm.\n\n\"I cannot describe what I saw,\" the king wrote in his notebook. \"It was\na glimpse of fiery cones, triangles, and circles, ranged in tier behind\ntier with a piercing eye in the center, and the light that came from\nthem resembled nothing that I have ever seen. It seemed to be a _living\nemanation_, and almost paralyzed me.\"\n\n\"We must get away from them,\" cried De Beauxchamps, as soon as the first\noverwhelming effect of the attack upon the bell had passed. And\nimmediately he set the propellers at their highest speed.\n\nThe bell shook and half rolled over, there was a scurrying among the\nmonsters outside, and two or three of them floated away partly in\ncollapse, as if they had been seriously wounded by the short propeller\nblades.\n\nThe direction of flight chanced to carry them past the dome of the\nColumbia University Library, which was standing almost intact, and then\nthey floated near the monumental tomb of General Grant, which had\ncrowned a noble elevation overlooking the Hudson River. A portion of the\nupper part of this structure had been carried away, but the larger part\nremained in position. They saw no more of the globular creatures which\nhad haunted the ruins of the cathedral, but, instead, there appeared\naround the bell an immense multitude of small luminescent animals, many\nof them most beautifully formed, and emitting from their light-producing\norgans various exquisite colors which turned the surrounding water into\nan all-embracing rainbow.\n\n[Illustration: \"AND THEN THEY FLOATED NEAR THE MONUMENTAL TOMB OF\nGENERAL GRANT\"]\n\nBut a more marvelous phenomenon quickly made its appearance, causing\nthem to gasp with astonishment. As they drew near the dismantled dome a\nbrilliant gleam suddenly streamed into the ports on the side turned\ntoward the monument--a gush of light so bright that the air inside the\nbell seemed to have been illuminated with a golden sunrise. They glanced\ntoward the monument, and saw that it was surmounted by some vibrating\nobject which seemed instinct with blinding fire. The colors that sprang\nfrom it changed rapidly from gold to purple, and then, through\nshimmering hues of bronze, to a deep rich orange. It looked like a sun,\npoised on the horizon. The spectacle was so dazzling, so unexpected, so\nbeautiful, and, associated with the architectural memorial of one of the\ngreatest characters in American history, so strangely suggestive, that\neven King Richard and the two Frenchmen were strongly moved, while Cosmo\nand his fellow-countrymen grasped each other by the hand, and the former\nsaid, in solemn tones:\n\n\"My friends, to my mind, this scene, however accidental, has something\nof prophecy about it. It changes the current of my thought--America is\nnot dead; in some way she yet survives upon the earth.\"\n\nLong they gazed and wondered, but at last, partly recovering from their\nastonishment, at the suggestion of De Beauxchamps, they drew nearer the\nmonument. But when they had arrived within a few yards of it, the\nblinding light disappeared as if snuffed out, and they saw nothing but\nthe broken gray walls of the dome. The moving object, which had been\ndimly visible at the beginning, and had evidently been the source of the\nlight, had vanished.\n\n\"The creature that produced the illumination,\" said Professor Abel Able,\n\"has been alarmed by our approach, and has withdrawn into the interior.\"\n\nThis was, no doubt, the true explanation, but they could perceive no\nsigns of life about the place, and they finally turned away from it with\nstrange sensations.\n\nAvoiding the neighborhood of the cathedral, they steered the bell down\nthe former course of the Hudson, but afterward ventured once more over\nthe drowned city until they arrived at the site of the great station of\nthe Pennsylvania Railroad, which they found completely unroofed. They\nsank the bell into the vast space where the tunnels entered from\nunderneath the old river bed, and again they had a startling experience.\nSomething huge, elongated, and spotted, and provided with expanding\nclaw-like limbs, slowly withdrew as their light streamed upon the\nreddish ooze covering the great floor. The nondescript retreated\nbackward into the mouth of a tunnel. They endeavored, cautiously, to\nfollow it, turning a magnifying window in its direction, and obtaining a\nstartling view of glaring eyes, but the creature hastened its retreat,\nand the last glimpse they had was of a grotesque head, which threw out\npiercing rays of green fire as it passed deeper into the tunnel.\n\n\"This is too terrible,\" exclaimed King Richard, shuddering. \"In Heaven's\nname, let us go no farther.\"\n\n\"We must visit Wall Street,\" said Amos Blank. \"We must see what the\nformer financial center of the world now looks like.\"\n\nAccordingly they issued from the ruined station, and, resuming their\ncourse southward, arrived at length over the great money center. The\ntall buildings which had shouldered each other in that wonderful\ndistrict, turning the streets into immense gorges, had, to a certain\nextent, protected one another against the effects of the waves, and the\nskeletons of many were yet standing. In the midst of them the dark spire\nof old Trinity still pointed stoutly upward, as if continuing its\nhopeless struggle against the spirit of worldly grandeur whose aspiring\ncreations, though in ruins, yet dwarfed this symbol of immortality. At\nthe intersection of the Wall and Broad Street ca\u00f1ons they found an\nenormous steel edifice, which had been completed a short time before the\ndeluge, tumbled in ruins upon the classic form of the old Stock\nExchange, the main features of whose front were yet recognizable. The\nweight of the fallen building had been so great that it had crushed the\nroof of the treasure vaults which had occupied its ground floor, and the\nfragments of safes with their contents had been hurled over the northern\nexpanse of Broad Street. The red ooze had covered most of the wasted\nwealth there heaped up, but in places piles of gold showed through the\ncovering. Amos Blank became greatly excited at this. His old\nproclivities seemed to resume their sway and his former madness to\nreturn, and he buried his finger nails in his clenched palms as he\npressed his face against a window, exclaiming:\n\n\"_My gold!_ MY GOLD! Let me out of this! I must have it!\"\n\n\"Nobody can get out of the bell, Mr. Blank,\" said Cosmo soothingly. \"And\nthe gold is now of no use to anybody.\"\n\n\"I tell you,\" cried Blank, \"that that is _my_ gold. It comes from _my_\nvaults, and I _must_ get out!\" And he dashed his fists wildly against\nthe glass until his knuckles were covered with blood. Then he sought\nabout for some implement with which to break the glass. They were\ncompelled to seize him, and a dreadful struggle followed in the\nrestricted space within the bell. In the midst of it Blank's face became\nset, and his eyes stared wildly out of a window.\n\nThe others followed the direction of his gaze, and they were almost\nfrozen into statues. Close beside the bell, which had, during the\nstruggle, floated near to the principal heap of mingled treasure and\nruin, heavily squatted on the very summit of the pile, was such a\ncreature as no words could depict--of a ghastly color, bulky and\nmalformed, furnished with three burning eyes that turned now green, now\nred with lambent flame, and great shapeless limbs, which it uplifted one\nafter the other, striking awkward, pawing blows at the bell! It seemed\nto the horrified onlookers to be the very demon of greed defending its\nspoil. Blank sank helpless on the bottom side of the bell, and the\nothers remained for a time petrified, and unable to speak. Suddenly the\ndreadful creature, making a forward lunge from its perch, struck the\nbell a mighty blow that sent it spinning in a partly upward direction.\nThe inmates were tumbled over one another, bruised and cut by the\nprojections that served for hand and foot holds. So great had been the\nimpact of the blow that the bell continued to revolve for several\nminutes, and they could do nothing to help themselves, except to seize\nthe holds as they came within their grasp, and hang on for dear life.\nThe violent shaking up roused Blank from his trance, and he hung on\ndesperately with the others.\n\nAfter a while the bell ceased to spin, and began to sink again toward\nthe bottom. De Beauxchamps, who had recovered some degree of\nself-command, instantly began to operate the control governing the\npropellers, and in a few minutes he had the bell moving in a fixed\ndirection.\n\n\"This way, this way,\" cried Cosmo, glancing out of the windows to orient\nhimself. \"We have seen enough! We must get back to the cable, and return\nto the Ark!\"\n\nThey were terror-stricken now, and pushing the propellers to their\nutmost, they fled toward the site of the Metropolitan tower. On their\nway, although for a time they passed over the course of the East River,\nthey saw no signs of the great bridges except the partly demolished but\nyet beautiful towers of the oldest of them, which had been constructed\nof heavy granite blocks. They found the cable attached as they had left\nit, and, although they were yet nervous from their recent experience,\nthey had no great difficulty in re-attaching it to the bell. Then, with\na sigh of relief, they signaled, and shouted through the telephone to\nthe Ark.\n\nBut no answer came, and there was no responsive movement of the cable!\nThey signaled and called again, but without result.\n\n\"My God!\" said Cosmo, in a faltering voice. \"Can anything have happened\nto the cable?\"\n\nThey looked at each other with blanched cheeks, and no man found a word\nto reply.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\nNEW AMERICA\n\n\nThere had been great excitement on the Ark when the first communication\nfrom the bell was received, announcing the arrival of the adventurers at\nthe Metropolitan tower. The news spread everywhere in a few seconds, and\nthe man in charge of the signaling apparatus and telephone would have\nbeen mobbed if Captain Arms had not rigorously shut off all\ncommunication with him, compelling the eager inquirers to be content\nwith such information as he himself saw fit to give them. When the\nannouncement was made that the bell had been cut loose, and the\nexploration begun, the excitement was intensified, and a Babel of voices\nresounded all over the great ship.\n\nAs hour after hour passed with no further communication from below the\nanxiety of the multitude became almost unbearable. Some declared that\nthe adventurers would never be able to re-attach the bell to the cable,\nand the fear rapidly spread that they would never be seen again. Captain\nArms strove in vain to reassure the excited passengers, but they grew\nevery moment more demoralized, and he was nearly driven out of his\nsenses by the insistent questioning to which he was subjected. It was\nalmost a relief to him when the lookout announced an impending change of\nweather--although he well new the peril which such a change might bring.\n\nIt came on more rapidly than anybody could have anticipated. The sky, in\nthe middle of the afternoon, became clouded, the sun was quickly hidden,\nand a cold blast arose, quickly strengthening into a regular blow. The\nArk began to drift as the rising waves assailed its vast flanks.\n\n\"Pay out the cable!\" roared Captain Arms through his trumpet.\n\nIf he had not been instantly obeyed it is probable that the cable would\nhave been dragged from its precarious fastening below. Then he instantly\nset the engines at work, and strove to turn the Ark so as to keep it\nnear the point of descent. At first they succeeded very well, but the\ncaptain knew that the wind was swiftly increasing in force, and that he\ncould not long continue to hold his place. It was a terrible emergency,\nbut he proved himself equal to it.\n\n\"We must float the cable,\" he shouted to his first assistant. \"Over with\nthe big buoy.\"\n\nThis buoy of levium had been prepared for other possible emergencies. It\nwas flat, presenting little surface to the wind, and when, working with\nfeverish speed, aided by an electric launch, they had attached the cable\nto it, it sank so low that its place on the sea was indicated only by\nthe short mast, capped with a streamer, which rose above it.\n\nWhen this work was completed a sigh of relief whistled through Captain\nArms's huge whiskers.\n\n\"May Davy Jones hold that cable tight!\" he exclaimed. \"Now for\nnavigating the Ark. If I had my old _Maria Jane_ under my feet I'd defy\nBoreas himself to blow me away from here--but this whale!\"\n\nThe wind increased fast, and in spite of every effort the Ark was driven\nfarther and farther toward the southwest, until the captain's telescope\nno longer showed the least glimpse of the streamer on the buoy. Then\nnight came on, and yet the wind continued to blow. The captain compelled\nall the passengers to go to their rooms. It would be useless to\nundertake to describe the terror and despair of that night. When the sun\nrose again the captain found that they had been driven seventy-five\nmiles from the site of New York, and yet, although the sky had now\npartly cleared, the violence of the wind had not diminished.\n\nCaptain Arms had the passengers' breakfast served in their rooms, simply\nsending them word that all would be well in the end. But in his secret\nheart he doubted if he could find the buoy again. He feared that it\nwould be torn loose with the cable.\n\nAbout noon the wind lulled, and at last the Ark could be effectively\ndriven in the direction of the buoy. But their progress was slow, and\nnight came on once more. During the hours of darkness the wind ceased\nentirely, and the sea became calm. With the sunrise the search for the\nbuoy was begun in earnest. The passengers were now allowed to go upon\nsome of the decks, and to assemble in the grand saloon, but no\ninterference was permitted with the navigators of the Ark. Never had\nCaptain Arms so fully exhibited his qualities as a seaman.\n\n\"We'll find that porpoise if it's still afloat,\" he declared.\n\nAbout half after eight o'clock a cry ran through the ship, bringing\neverybody out on the decks.\n\nThe captain had discovered the buoy through his glass!\n\nIt lay away to the nor'ard, about a mile, and as they approached all\ncould see the streamer, hanging down its pole, a red streak in the\nsunshine.\n\n\"Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!\" The Ark echoed with glad cries from stem to\nstern. A thousand questions were shouted at the captain on his bridge,\nbut he was imperturbable. He only glanced at his watch, and then said,\nin an undertone, to Joseph Smith, who stood beside him:\n\n\"Forty-seven hours and twenty minutes. By the time we can get the cable\nback on the drum it will be full forty-eight hours since they started,\nand the air in the bell could be kept in condition no longer than that.\nIt may take as much as two hours more to draw it up.\"\n\n\"Can you do it so rapidly as that?\" asked Smith, his voice trembling.\n\n\"I'll do it or bust,\" returned the captain. \"Perhaps they may yet be\nalive.\"\n\nSmith turned his eyes upward and clasped his hands. The Ark was put to\nits utmost speed, and within the time estimated by the captain the cable\nwas once more on the great drum. Before starting it the captain attached\nthe telephone and shouted down. There was no reply.\n\n\"Start gently, and then, if she draws, drive for your lubberly lives,\"\nhe said to the men in charge of the big donkey engine.\n\nThe moment it began to turn he inspected the indicator.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" he exclaimed. \"She pulls; the bell is attached.\"\n\nThe crowded decks broke into a cheer. In a few minutes the Ark was\nvibrating with the strokes of the engine. Within five minutes the\nstrong, slender cable was issuing out of the depths at the rate of 250\nfeet a minute. But there were six miles of it! The engineer controlling\nthe drum shook his head.\n\n\"We may break the cable,\" he said.\n\n\"Go on!\" shouted Captain Arms. \"It's their only chance. Every second of\ndelay means sure death.\"\n\nWithin forty minutes the cable was coming up 300 feet a minute. The\nspeed increased as the bell rose out of the depths. It was just one hour\nand forty-five minutes after the drum began to revolve when the anxious\nwatchers were thrown into a furore of excitement by the appearance of a\nshining blue point deep beneath. It was the bell! Again there broke\nforth a tempest of cheers.\n\nRapidly the rising bell grew larger under their eyes, until at last it\nburst the surface of the sea. The engine had been skillfully slowed at\nthe last moment, and the rescued bell stopped at the level of the deck\nopen to receive it. With mad haste it was drawn aboard and the hermetic\ndoor was opened. Those who were near enough glanced inside and turned\npale. Tumbled in a heap at the bottom lay the six men, with yellow faces\nand blank, staring eyes. In an instant they were lifted out and two\ndoctors sprang to the side of each. Were they dead? Could any skill\nrevive them? A hush as of death spread over the great vessel.\n\nThey were not dead. The skill of the physicians brought them, one after\nanother, slowly back to consciousness. But it was two full days before\nthey could rise from their beds, and three before they could begin to\ntell their story--the story of the wonders they had seen, and of the\ndreadful struggle for breath in the imprisoned bell before they had sunk\ninto unconsciousness. Not a word was ever spoken about the strange\noutbreak of Blank at the sight of the gold, although the others all\nrecorded it in their notebooks. He himself never referred to it, and it\nseemed to have faded from his mind.\n\nAs soon as it was evident that the rescued men would recover, Captain\nArms, acting on his own responsibility, had started the Ark on its\nwestward course. It was a long and tedious journey that they had yet\nbefore them, but the monotony was broken by the undying interest in the\nmarvelous story of the adventures of the bell.\n\nThree weeks after they left the vicinity of New York, the observations\nshowed that they must be nearing the eastern border of the Colorado\nplateau. Then one day a bird alighted on the railing of the bridge,\nclose beside Cosmo and Captain Arms.\n\n\"A bird!\" cried Cosmo. \"But it is incredible that a bird should be here!\nHow can it ever have kept itself afloat? It surely could not have\nremained in the air all this time, and it could not have rested on the\nwaves during the downpour from the sky! Its presence here is absolutely\nmiraculous!\"\n\nThe poor bird, evidently exhausted by a long journey, remained upon the\nrail, and permitted Cosmo to approach closely before taking flight to\nanother part of the Ark. Cosmo at first thought that it might have\nescaped from his aviary below.\n\nBut close inspection satisfied him that it was of a different species\nfrom any that he had taken into the Ark, and the more he thought of the\nstrangeness of its appearance here the greater was his bewilderment.\n\nWhile he was puzzling over the subject the bird was seen by many of the\npassengers, flitting from one part of the vessel to another, and they\nwere as much astonished as Cosmo had been, and all sorts of conjectures\nwere made to account for the little creature's escape from the flood.\n\nBut within an hour or two Cosmo and the captain, who were now much\noftener alone upon the bridge than they had been during their passage\nover the eastern continents, had another, and an incomparably greater,\nsurprise.\n\nIt was the call of \"Land, ho!\" from the lookout.\n\n\"Land!\" exclaimed Cosmo. \"Land! How can there be any land?\"\n\nCaptain Arms was no less incredulous, and he called the lookout down,\naccused him of having mistaken a sleeping whale for a landfall, and sent\nanother man aloft in his place. But in a few minutes the same call of\n\"Land, ho!\" was repeated.\n\nThe captain got the bearings of the mysterious object this time, and the\nArk was sent for it at her highest speed. It rose steadily out of the\nwater until there could be no possibility of not recognizing it as the\ntop of a mountain.\n\nWhen it had risen still higher, until its form seemed gigantic against\nthe horizon, Captain Arms, throwing away his tobacco with an emphatic\ngesture, and striking his palm on the rail, fairly shouted:\n\n\"The Pike! By--the old Pike! There she blows!\"\n\n\"Do you mean Pike's Peak?\" demanded Cosmo.\n\n\"Do I mean Pike's Peak?\" cried the captain, whose excitement had become\nuncontrollable. \"Yes, I mean Pike's Peak, and the deuce to him! Wasn't I\nborn at his foot? Didn't I play ball in the Garden of the Gods? And look\nat him, Mr. Vers\u00e1l! There he stands! No water-squirting pirate of a\nnebula could down the old Pike!\"\n\nThe excitement of everybody else was almost equal to the captain's, when\nthe grand mass of the mountain, with its characteristic profile, came\ninto view from the promenade-decks.\n\nDe Beauxchamps, King Richard, and Amos Blank hurried to the bridge,\nwhich they were still privileged to invade, and the two former in\nparticular asked questions faster than they could be answered.\nMeanwhile, they were swiftly approaching the mountain.\n\nKing Richard seemed to be under the impression that they had completed\nthe circuit of the world ahead of time, and his first remark was to the\neffect that Mount Everest appeared to be rising faster than they had\nanticipated.\n\n\"That's none of your pagodas!\" exclaimed the captain disdainfully;\n\"that's old Pike; and if you can find a better crown for the world, I'd\nlike to see it.\"\n\nThe king looked puzzled, and Cosmo explained that they were still near\nthe center of the American continent, and that the great peak before\nthem was the sentinel of the Rocky Mountains.\n\n\"But,\" replied the king, \"I understood you that the whole world was\ncovered, and that the Himalayas would be the first to emerge.\"\n\n\"That's what I believed,\" said Cosmo, \"but the facts are against me.\"\n\n\"So you thought you were going to run over the Rockies!\" exclaimed the\ncaptain gleefully. \"They're no Gaurisankars, hey, M. De Beauxchamps?\"\n\n\"_Vive les Rockies! Vive le Pike!_\" cried the Frenchman, catching the\ncaptain's enthusiasm.\n\n\"But how do you explain it?\" asked King Richard.\n\n\"It's the batholite,\" responded Cosmo, using exactly the same phrase\nthat Professor Pludder had employed some months before.\n\n\"And pray explain to me what is a batholite?\"\n\nBefore Cosmo Vers\u00e1l could reply there was a terrific crash, and the Ark,\nfor the third time in her brief career, had made an unexpected landing.\nBut this time the accident was disastrous.\n\nAll on the bridge, including Captain Arms, who should surely have known\nthe lay of the land about his childhood's home, had been so interested\nin their talk that before they were aware of the danger the great vessel\nhad run her nose upon a projecting buttress of the mountain.\n\nShe was going at full speed, too. Not a person aboard but was thrown\nfrom his feet, and several were severely injured.\n\nThe prow of the Ark was driven high upon a sloping surface of rock, and\nthe tearing sounds showed only too clearly that this time both bottoms\nhad been penetrated, and that there could be no hope of saving the huge\nship or getting her off.\n\nPerhaps at no time in all their adventures had the passengers of the Ark\nbeen so completely terrorized and demoralized, and many members of the\ncrew were in no better state. Cosmo and the captain shouted orders, and\nran down into the hold to see the extent of the damage. Water was\npouring in through the big rents in torrents.\n\nThere was plainly nothing to be done but to get everybody out of the\nvessel and upon the rocks as rapidly as possible.\n\nThe forward parts of the promenade-deck directly overhung the rock upon\nwhich the Ark had forced itself, and it was possible for many to be let\ndown that way. At the same time boats were set afloat, and dozens got\nashore in them.\n\nWhile everybody was thus occupied with things immediately concerning\ntheir safety, nobody paid any attention to the approach of a boat, which\nhad set out from a kind of bight in the face of the mountain.\n\nCosmo was at the head of the accommodation-ladder that was being let\ndown on the starboard side, when he heard a shout, and, lifting his eyes\nfrom his work, was startled to see a boat containing, beside the rowers,\ntwo men whom he instantly recognized--they were President Samson and\nProfessor Pludder.\n\nTheir sudden appearance here astonished him as much as that of Pike's\nPeak itself had done. He dropped his hands and stared at them as their\nboat swiftly approached. The ladder had just been got ready, and the\nmoment the boat touched its foot Professor Pludder mounted to the deck\nof the Ark as rapidly as his great weight would permit.\n\nHe stretched out his hand as his foot met the deck, and smilingly said:\n\n\"Vers\u00e1l, you were right about the nebula.\"\n\n\"Pludder,\" responded Cosmo, immediately recovering his aplomb, and\ntaking the extended hand of the professor, \"you certainly know the truth\nwhen you see it.\"\n\nNot another word was exchanged between them for the time, and Professor\nPludder instantly set to work aiding the passengers to descend the\nladder. Cosmo waved his hand in greeting to the President, who remained\nin the boat, and politely lifted his tall, but sadly battered hat in\nresponse.\n\nThe Ark had become so firmly lodged that, after the passengers had all\ngot ashore, Cosmo decided to open a way through the forward end of the\nvessel by removing some of the plates, so that the animals could be\ntaken ashore direct from their deck by simply descending a slightly\nsloping gangway.\n\nThis was a work that required a whole day, and while it was going\nforward under Cosmo's directions the passengers, and such of the crew as\nwere not needed, found their way, led by the professor and the\nPresident, round a bluff into a kind of mountain lap, where they were\nastonished to see many rough cottages, situated picturesquely among the\nrocks, and small cultivated spaces, with grass and flowers, surrounding\nthem.\n\nHere dwelt some hundreds of people, who received the shipwrecked company\nwith Western hospitality, after the first effects of their astonishment\nhad worn off. It appears that, owing to its concealment by a projecting\npart of the mountain, the Ark had not been seen until just at the moment\nwhen it went ashore.\n\nAlthough it was now the early part of September, the air was warm and\nbalmy, and barn-yard fowls were clucking and scratching about the rather\nmeager soil around the houses and outbuildings.\n\nThere was not room in this place for all the newcomers, but Professor\nPludder assured them that in many of the neighboring hollows, which had\nformerly been mountain gorges, there were similar settlements, and that\nroom would be found for all.\n\nParties were sent off under the lead of guides, and great was the\namazement, and, it may be added, joy, with which they were received in\nthe little communities that clustered about the flanks of the mountain.\n\nAbout half of Cosmo's animals had perished, most of them during the\nterrible experiences attending the arrival of the nucleus, which have\nalready been described, but those that remained were in fairly good\ncondition, and with the possible exception of the elephants, they seemed\nglad to feel solid ground once more under their feet.\n\nThe elephants had considerable difficulty in making their way over the\nrocks to the little village, but finally all were got to a place of\nsecurity. The great Californian cattle caused hardly less trouble than\nthe elephants, but the Astorian turtles appeared to feel themselves at\nhome at once.\n\nCosmo, with King Richard, De Beauxchamps, Amos Blank, Captain Arms, and\nJoseph Smith, became the guests of Professor Pludder and the President\nin their modest dwellings, and as soon as a little order had been\nestablished explanations began. Professor Pludder was the first\nspokesman, the scene being the President's \"parlor.\"\n\nHe told of their escape from Washington and of their arrival on the\nColorado plateau.\n\n\"When the storm recommenced,\" he said, \"I recognized the complete truth\nof your theory, Mr. Vers\u00e1l--I had partially recognized it before--and I\nmade every preparation for the emergency.\n\n\"The downfall, upon the whole, was not as severe here as it had been\nduring the earlier days of the deluge, but it must have been far more\nsevere elsewhere.\n\n\"The sea around us began to rise, and then suddenly the rise ceased.\nAfter studying the matter I concluded that a batholite was rising under\nthis region, and that there was a chance that we might escape\nsubmergence through its influence.\"\n\n\"Pardon me,\" interrupted King Richard, \"but Mr. Vers\u00e1l has already\nspoken of a 'batholite.' What does that mean?\"\n\n\"I imagine,\" replied the professor, smiling, \"that neither Mr. Vers\u00e1l\nnor I have used the term in a strictly technical sense. At least we have\nvastly extended and modified its meaning in order to meet the\ncircumstances of our case.\n\n\"Batholite is a word of the old geology, derived, from a language which\nwas once widely cultivated, Greek, and meaning, in substance, stone, or\nrock, 'from the depths.'\n\n\"The conception underlying it is that of an immense mass of plastic rock\nrising under the effects of pressure from the interior of the globe,\nforcing, and in part melting its way to the surface, or lifting up the\nsuperincumbent crust.\n\n\"Geologists had discovered the existence of many great batholites that\nhad risen in former ages, and there were some gigantic ones known in\nthis part of America.\"\n\n\"That,\" interposed Cosmo, \"was the basis of my idea that the continents\nwould rise again, only I supposed that the rise would first manifest\nitself in the Himalayan region.\n\n\"However, since it has resulted in the saving of so many lives here, I\ncannot say that my disappointment goes beyond the natural mortification\nof a man of science upon discovering that he has been in error.\"\n\n\"I believe,\" said Professor Pludder, \"that at least a million have\nsurvived here in the heart of the continent through the uprising of the\ncrust. We have made explorations in many directions, and have found that\nthrough all the Coloradan region people have succeeded in escaping to\nthe heights.\n\n\"Since the water, although it began to rise again after the first arrest\nof the advance of the sea, never attained a greater elevation than about\n7,500 feet as measured from the old sea-level contours, there must be\nmillions of acres, not to say square miles, that are still habitable.\n\n\"I even hope that the uprising has extended far through the Rocky\nMountain region.\"\n\nProfessor Pludder then went on to tell how they had escaped from the\nneighborhood of Colorado Springs when the readvance of the sea began,\nand how at last it became evident that the influence of the underlying\n\"batholite\" would save them from submergence.\n\nIn some places, he said, violent phenomena had been manifested, and\nsevere earthquakes had been felt, but upon the whole, he thought, not\nmany had perished through that cause.\n\nAs soon as some degree of confidence that they were, after all, to\nescape the flood, had been established, they had begun to cultivate such\nsoil as they could find, and now, after months of fair weather, they had\nbecome fairly established in their new homes.\n\nWhen Cosmo, on his side, had told of the adventures of the Ark, and of\nthe disappearance of the crown of the world in Asia, and when De\nBeauxchamps had entertained the wondering listeners with his account of\nthe submarine explorations of the _Jules Verne_ and the diving bell, the\ncompany at last broke up.\n\nFrom this point--the arrival of the Ark in Colorado, and its wreck on\nPike's Peak--the literature of our subject becomes abundant, but we\ncannot pause to review it in detail.\n\nThe re-emergence of the Colorado mountain region continued slowly, and\nwithout any disastrous convulsions, and the level of the water receded\nyear by year as the land rose, and the sea lost by evaporation into\nspace and by chemical absorption in the crust.\n\nIn some other parts of the Rockies, as Professor Pludder had\nanticipated, an uprising had occurred, and it was finally estimated that\nas many as three million persons survived the deluge.\n\nIt was not the selected band with which Cosmo Vers\u00e1l had intended to\nregenerate mankind, but from the Ark he spread a leaven which had its\neffect on the succeeding generations.\n\nHe taught his principles of eugenics, and implanted deep the germs of\nscience, in which he was greatly aided by Professor Pludder, and, as all\nreaders of this narrative know, we have every reason to believe that our\nnew world, although its population has not yet grown to ten millions, is\nfar superior, in every respect, to the old world that was drowned.\n\nAs the dry land spread wider extensive farms were developed, and for a\nlong time there was almost no other occupation than that of cultivating\nthe rich soil.\n\nPresident Samson was, by unanimous vote, elected President of the\nrepublic of New America, and King Richard became his Secretary of State,\nan office, he declared, of which he was prouder than he had been of his\nkingship, when the sound of the British drumbeat accompanied the sun\naround the world.\n\nAmos Blank, returning to his old methods, soon became the leading\nfarmer, buying out the others until the government sternly interfered\nand compelled him to relinquish everything but five hundred acres of\nground.\n\nBut on this Blank developed a most surprising collection of domestic\nanimals, principally from the stocks that Cosmo had saved in the Ark.\n\nThe elephants died, and the Astorian turtles did not reproduce their\nkind, but the gigantic turkeys and the big cattle and sheep did\nexceedingly well, and many other varieties previously unknown were\ngradually developed with the aid of Sir Wilfrid Athelstone, who found\nevery opportunity to apply his theories in practice.\n\nOf Costak\u00e9 Theriade, and the inter-atomic force, it is only necessary to\nremind the reader that the marvelous mechanical powers which we possess\nto-day, and which we draw directly from the hidden stores of the\nelectrons, trace their origin to the brain of the \"speculative genius\"\nfrom Roumania, whom Cosmo Vers\u00e1l had the insight to save from the great\nsecond deluge.\n\nAll of these actors long ago passed from the scene, President Samson\nbeing the last survivor, after winning by his able administration the\ntitle of the second father of his country. But to the last he showed his\nmagnanimity by honoring Cosmo Vers\u00e1l, and upon the latter's death he\ncaused to be carved, high on the brow of the great mountain on which his\nvoyage ended, in gigantic letters, cut deep in the living rock, and\ncovered with shining, incorrodible levium, an inscription that will\ntransmit his fame to the remotest posterity:\n\n                HERE RESTED THE ARK OF\n                    COSMO VERSAL!\n  _He Foresaw and Prepared for the Second Deluge,\n                  And Although Nature\n             Aided Him in Unexpected Ways,\n  Yet, but for Him, His Warnings, and His Example\n          The World of Man Would Have Ceased\n                     To Exist._\n\n\nIt would be unjust to Mr. Samson to suppose that any ironical intention\nwas in his mind when he composed this lofty inscription.\n\n\n_Postscriptum_\n\nWhile these words are being written, news comes of the return of an\naero, driven by inter-atomic energy, from a voyage of exploration round\nthe earth.\n\nIt appears that the Alps are yet deeply buried, but that Mount Everest\nnow lifts its head more than ten thousand feet above the sea, and that\nsome of the loftiest plains of Tibet are beginning to re-emerge.\n\nThus Cosmo Vers\u00e1l's prediction is fulfilled, though he has not lived to\nsee it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Second Deluge, by Garrett P.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
