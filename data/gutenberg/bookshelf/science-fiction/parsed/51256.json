Since the publication of _Dentist\nAmigovitch_, this house had become known all over the world as Boris\nKnackenpast's villa. Now the house was guarded by a company of\nsoldiers to keep visitors out. From an open window Pashkov heard the\nclicking of a typewriter.\n\n\"It's when they're not like robots that everybody suspects them,\" he\nsaid, climbing into his flier. \"Petchareff will send you word when to\nannounce his 'death'.\"\n\n\"A question, brother.\"\n\n\"No questions.\"\n\n\"Who smuggled the manuscript out of Russia?\"\n\nPashkov frowned convincingly. \"Comrade Petchareff has suspected even\nme.\"\n\nHe took off for Moscow, poking his flier up through the clouds and\nflying close to them, as was his habit. Then he switched on the radio\nand got Petchareff's secretary. \"Nadezhda?\"\n\n\"I know what you're up to, Seven One Three,\" Nadezhda Brunhildova said.\n\"Don't try to fool _me_, you confidence man. You are coming in?\"\n\n\"In ten minutes. What have I done now?\"\n\n\"You were supposed to make funeral arrangements for Knackenpast, so\nwhat are you doing in Stockholm?\"\n\n\"Stockholm?\"\n\n\"You're lying and I'll kill you. Don't you think I know about Anastina,\nthat she-nurse in the Stockholm National Hospital?\"\n\n\"Darling, why so cruel? Anastina is one of our contacts. Besides, she's\ncross-eyed and buck-toothed.\"\n\n\"Beast!\" She switched him to Petchareff.\n\n\"What's been keeping you, Pashkov?\"\n\n\"Consoling Medvedev. Am I supposed to be in Stockholm?\"\n\n\"Never mind, get here at once. What size hospital gown do you wear?\"\n\n\"Hospital gown?\"\n\n\"Stockholm embassy says you're in the National Hospital there. In a\nhospital gown. I got through to Anastina. She says it's Colonel James\nagain. He looks like you now.\"\n\nPashkov grunted.\n\n\"I'll never understand,\" said Petchareff, \"why all top secret agents\nhave to look like bankers. Anastina says Colonel James was operated on\nby a Monsieur Fanti. What do you know about him?\"\n\n\"He's a theatrical surgeon.\"\n\n\"You're not playing one of your jokes, Pashkov?\"\n\n\"Hardly.\"\n\n\"You'd better be in my office in ten minutes. What size hospital gown?\"\n\n\"Short and fat,\" Pashkov said, and switched off.\n\nMost countries wanted to break his neck, and his own Motherland did not\nalways trust him. But he enjoyed his work--enjoyed it as much as his\nclosest professional rival, Colonel James, U.S.A.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPashkov landed on the roof of Intelligence in the northeast corner of\nthe Kremlin, hitched up his pants and rode down.\n\nIn his office, Petchareff removed the cigar from his mouth as Pashkov\ncame in. \"Medvedev get my orders?\"\n\n\"He's preparing a new super-patriotic writer to replace Boris\nKnackenpast,\" Pashkov reported. \"When you give the word, he will call\n_Izvestia_ and tell them Boris is dead.\"\n\nPetchareff glanced at his calendar. \"We have two other state funerals\nthis week. You made it plain, I hope, we want no repetition of\nKnackenpast's peace nonsense?\"\n\n\"No more Gandhi or Schweitzer influences. The new literature,\" Pashkov\npromised, raising a chubby finger, \"will be a pearl necklace of\ngovernment slogans.\"\n\nNadezhda buzzed the intercom. \"The man from the Bolshoi Theater is\nhere, Comrade.\"\n\n\"Send him in.\"\n\nA small man hurried into the room. He had a narrow face and the\nmustache of a mouse and a mousy nose, but his eyes were big rabbit\neyes. He bowed twice quickly, placed a package on the desk with\ntrembling forepaws and bowed twice again.\n\nPetchareff tore open the package. \"You got the real thing? No bad\nimitation?\"\n\n\"Exactly, exactly,\" the mouse piped. \"No difference, Comrade.\" He held\nhis paws as in prayer and his pointed mouth quivered.\n\nPetchareff held up the hospital gown. On the back of the gown was\nprinted in indelible ink:\n\n                      stockholm national hospital\n                              courtesy of\n                               Coca-Cola\n\nPetchareff tossed the gown to Pashkov. \"This is what Colonel James is\nwearing,\" he said, dismissing the mouse, who bowed twice and scurried\nout.\n\n\"Try and split the allies,\" Pashkov muttered, reading the legend on the\ngown.\n\nPetchareff blew cigar smoke in his face. \"If Colonel James makes a\nmonkey of you once more, you're through, Pashkov. You don't take your\njob seriously enough. You bungle this and I'll have you transferred to\nour Cultural Information Center in Chicago.\"\n\nPashkov winced.\n\n\"Now, you'll go to Stockholm and switch places with the American\ncolonel and find out what they're up to. Zubov's kidnaping team is\nthere already, at Hotel Reisen. Any questions?\"\n\n\"I thought Zubov was a zoological warfare expert. What is he doing with\na kidnaping team?\"\n\n\"His team is more agile. On your way.\"\n\nIn the front office, Pashkov stopped to kiss Nadezhda Brunhildova\ngoodby. \"I may not return from this dangerous mission. Give me a tender\nkiss.\"\n\nNadezhda was a big girl with hefty arms, captain of her local broom\nbrigade. \"Monster!\" She seized him by the collar. \"Is Anastina\ndangerous?\"\n\n\"Darling!\"\n\n\"Bitter sweetness!\" she howled, dropping him. \"Go, love. Make me\nmiserable.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPashkov spent an hour at Central Intelligence. Nothing unusual going on\nin Stockholm: an industrial exhibit, the Swedish Academy in session,\na sociology seminar on prison reform, a forty-man trade mission from\nIndia.\n\nAn addendum to the Stockholm file listed two Cuban agents operating\nfrom Fralsningsarmen's Economy Lodgings. They were buying small arms\nand ammunition. He thought a moment, impressed the Cubans' address on\nhis memory, and went to his flier.\n\nHe did not fly to Hotel Reisen at once. Zubov's kidnaping team could\nwait. Coming slowly over Stockholm he spotted the National Hospital and\ncircled.\n\nA line of ambulance fliers was parked on the ground in the ambulance\ncourt. On the hospital roof, he noticed, apart from private fliers,\nstood a flier that resembled his own.\n\nHe veered away, detoured around Riddarholmen, and five minutes later\nlanded on the roof of Fralsningsarmen's Economy Lodgings--the Salvation\nArmy flophouse.\n\n\"My Cuban friends,\" Pashkov inquired in fluent English at the desk on\nthe top floor. \"Are they in?\"\n\nThe old desk clerk looked like a stork. \"Yu, room six fifteen,\" he\nclacked. \"Tree floors down. Aer yu Amerikan?\"\n\n\"Brazil.\"\n\n\"Ah so? You sprikker goot Inglish laik me.\"\n\n\"Very kind of you.\"\n\nHe rode down three floors, found room 615, and stopped as he heard\nvoices within.\n\n\"... _dos, tres, cuatro, cinco, seis, siete_. By seven o'clock tonight,\nokay, Gringo?\"\n\n\"What do you expect for seven thousand bucks--service? Look, boys, I'm\njust a honest businessman. I can't get it for you today. Have a seegar,\nPablo.\"\n\n\"Tfu!\"\n\n\"All rightie, your cause is my cause. Maybe I can get it for you\ntonight. But you'll have to pay in advance. What do you say, Francisco?\"\n\n\"I counted the money. It is waiting for you. You deliver, we pay.\"\n\n\"But how can I trust you? I like you boys, I know you like me, but\nbusiness is business. I gotta give something to my jobber, don't I?\"\n\n\"Gringo!\"\n\nAt that moment Pashkov knocked on the door.\n\nFrom within: \"Shh! _Alguien llama a la puerta._\"\n\nPashkov knocked again and a scuffle ensued within, the crack of a chair\non a skull, the dragging of a beefy body into a closet, and the slam\nof the closet door.\n\n\"_Yu?_\"\n\n\"_Buenas tardes_,\" Pashkov said through the door. \"_Asuntos muy\nimportantes._\"\n\nThe door opened a crack and two dark eyes in a young bearded face\npeered out. \"Eh?\"\n\n\"_Gospodin Pashkov, para servir a usted._\"\n\nThe door opened enough to admit the roly-poly visitor into the room.\nThe other Cuban, also bearded and wearing a fatigue cap, held a\nrevolver.\n\n\"No gun-play, caballeros,\" Pashkov went on in Spanish. \"We are in the\nSalvation Army charity house, not in a two-peso thriller. Besides, I\ndeliver before I ask payment.\"\n\n\"Deliver what, senor?\"\n\n\"We favor any disturbance close to the United States. May I sit down?\"\n\nBetween two beds were stacked some dozen crates of explosives. A small\ntable was littered with papers.\n\nSitting down at the table, Pashkov's elbow rested on an invoice, and\nmoments later the invoice was tucked in his pocket.\n\n\"What kind of ammunition do you need, caballeros?\"\n\nThe Cubans looked at each other. \"Thirty-o-six caliber, two-twenty\ngrain. How much can you deliver?\"\n\n\"Two thousand rounds.\"\n\n\"Not much.\"\n\n\"Maybe three thousand. I'll toss in a box of hand grenades and a can of\nlysergic acid diethylamide.\"\n\n\"You have that? You have LSD-25?\"\n\n\"I have that. When are you leaving Stockholm?\"\n\nAgain the young beards exchanged looks. \"Maybe we stay till tomorrow\nif you have more business. Three thousand rounds is not much. How much\npayment, senor?\"\n\n\"Two thousand kronor,\" Pashkov said, taking an envelope on the table\nand addressing it to Nadezhda Brunhildova, Kremlin, Moscow. No return\naddress.\n\n\"Do you trust us to send the money?\"\n\n\"It is bad for you if I do not trust you,\" Pashkov said, smiling up at\nthem.\n\n\"You can trust us. We shall send the money. Please take a cigar.\"\n\nPashkov took four Havanas from the box they held out to him, stuck\nthree in his breast pocket, and lit one.\n\n\"You come again, senor. We make much business.\"\n\n\"Why not? Help retire Latin-American dictators to Siberia. More gold in\nSiberia than in Las Vegas.\"\n\n\"Hyi, hyi, that is funny. You come again.\"\n\nOn his way up to the roof, Pashkov studied the invoice he had lifted.\nIt was from a manufacturer of sporting arms to Francisco Jesus Maria\nGonzales, Salvation Army Economy Lodgings. He tucked the invoice into\nhis inner pocket with a satisfied grunt, climbed into his flier and\nhopped over to Hotel Reisen, where Zubov's kidnaping team was waiting\nfor him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nComrade Zubov, the kidnaping expert, was pacing the roof of Hotel\nReisen. As Pashkov eased down in his flier, Zubov's big front tooth\nflashed with delight. Pashkov felt like tossing him a bone.\n\n\"Everything in order, Gospodin Pashkov. Constant vigilance maintained\nat hospital by my two assistants. With your pardon, Comrade Petchareff\nurges all haste. Colonel James is due to leave the hospital tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Comrade Petchareff always urges haste. What else?\"\n\nZubov's big tooth settled respectfully over his lower lip. His small\neyes were so closely set that he looked cockeyed when he focused them\non his superior.\n\n\"With your pardon, I shall conduct you to our suite. Plans for\nkidnaping of Colonel James all ready.\"\n\n\"Here's a cigar for you.\"\n\n\"Gratefully accepted. Reduced unavoidable fatalities to six.\" Zubov\ncounted on his long hard fingers. \"Two watchmen, three nurses, one\ndoctor.\"\n\nIn the hotel corridor, Zubov looked before and after, his eyes crossed\nsuspiciously, and peered around corners. They got to their suite\nwithout incident, and Pashkov gave him another cigar.\n\n\"Gratefully accepted. Here is a map of hospital and grounds. Here is a\nmap of twenty-third floor. Here is a map of Colonel James' room. Here\nis hospital routine between midnight and dawn. With your pardon--\"\n\nPashkov picked up the phone, dialed the Soviet embassy, and got the\ncharg\u00e9 d'affaires. \"How is your underdeveloped countries fund?\" he\nasked.\n\n\"Always depleted, always replenished.\"\n\n\"I don't want any Russian brands.\"\n\n\"Nothing but foreign,\" the charg\u00e9 buzzed. \"We got almost everything now\nthrough an American surplus outlet in Hamburg. Nationals get caught\nwith American goods, Americans get blamed. Wonderful confusion. What do\nyou need?\"\n\n\"Thirty-o-six two-twenty, three thousand--if you have it.\"\n\n\"Most popular. What else?\"\n\n\"Pineapples--one crate.\"\n\n\"Only confiscated German potatoes. Will that do?\"\n\n\"Fine. And a small can of sentimental caviar.\"\n\n\"Too risky.\"\n\n\"It's all right. It will fall to local authorities by tomorrow.\"\n\nPashkov put down the receiver. Give the Cubans enough to expect\nmore--make sure they stay in town.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nZubov was cross-checking his kidnaping plans. He said, \"With your\npardon, do we take Colonel James alive or dead-or-alive?\"\n\n\"Alive.\"\n\nZubov pulled a long face. \"Dead-or-alive would be easier, Gospodin\nPashkov. Fast, clean job.\"\n\nPashkov squinted at Zubov's crossed eyes. \"Have you had your eyes\nexamined lately?\"\n\n\"No need,\" Zubov assured him with a smile. \"I see more than most\npeople.\"\n\nPashkov held up his remaining cigar. \"How many cigars in my hand?\"\n\n\"Two.\"\n\nAt that moment the door opened and Zubov's kidnaping team lumbered\nin. They were a couple of big apes dressed in blue canvas shoes, red\ntrousers, yellow jackets, white silk scarves, sport caps and sun\nglasses.\n\n\"What are you doing here?\" cried Zubov. \"Why aren't you observing the\nhospital?\"\n\n\"Dhh, you said to report ... um ... if something happened,\" the first\nape said in a thick voice.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Victim's room lights out,\" the ape said.\n\n\"My assistants,\" Zubov introduced them to Pashkov. \"Line up, line up,\nlads. With your pardon, they are good lads. This is Petya, and this is\nKolya. No, _this_ is Kolya and this one is Petya.\"\n\n\"Twins?\"\n\n\"Not exactly. Same genetic experiment. Good lads. Stand straight,\nPetya. Don't curl your feet like that, Kolya, I've told you before. Why\ndidn't you shave your hands today?\"\n\nKolya looked guiltily at his hands.\n\n\"They've made progress,\" Zubov assured Pashkov, pulling a small whip\nfrom his hip pocket. \"Straight, lads, straight,\" he flicked the whip.\n\"We have company.\"\n\n\"Are their costumes your own idea?\"\n\n\"With your pardon, for purposes of concealment. What are your orders?\"\n\nPashkov told them to pick up the boxes of ammunition at the embassy and\ndeliver them to the Cubans, and then to commandeer a private automobile.\n\n\"We have autos at the embassy pool,\" Zubov suggested.\n\n\"I want a vehicle off the street. Then report back here with your\nlads.\"\n\nPetya gave Kolya a box on the ear.\n\n\"Boys, boys!\" Zubov cracked the whip. \"Out you go. A job for Gospodin\nPashkov, lads. They don't get enough exercise,\" he grinned, backing out\nafter them. \"With your pardon, I'll thrash them later.\"\n\nAnd they were gone. Pashkov turned to the hospital maps and studied\nthem before taking a nap.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShortly before dawn, Zubov's team returned, their mission accomplished.\n\n\"With your pardon, an excellent Mercedes,\" Zubov reported.\n\nPashkov had changed into the hospital gown with the Coca-Cola legend on\nthe back. He glanced at his watch. It was four o'clock in the morning.\n\nHe tossed his bundle of clothing to the first ape. \"Take my flier back\nto Moscow, Kolya lad. Give my clothes to Nadezhda Brunhildova, and tell\nComrade Petchareff to expect Colonel James today.\"\n\nClutching the bundle, Kolya stuck his tongue out at Petya and bounded\nout of the room. They waited at the window until they saw Kolya take\noff in Pashkov's flier. Then they made their way down the service\nstairs to the alley, Pashkov dressed only in the hospital gown; got\ninto the stolen Mercedes and drove to the National Hospital, all three\nleaning forward.\n\nIn the ambulance court, Zubov and Petya moved quickly to a Red Cross\nflier. Pashkov dropped the invoice he had lifted from the Cubans on the\nfront seat of the stolen car, and followed.\n\nA watchman emerged from his hut, looked idly up at the rising\nambulance, and shuffled back to his morning coffee.\n\nAs Petya brought the flier to a hovering stop against Colonel James'\nwindow, Pashkov bounced into the room; Zubov drew his gun and jumped in\nafter.\n\nColonel James awoke, turned on the night lamp, and sat up in the bed,\nhis eyes blinking.\n\nPashkov stood looking at Colonel James. The resemblance between them\nwas remarkable. Zubov's eyes were crossed with astonishment.\n\n\"My dear Gospodin Pashkov!\" Colonel James greeted him in Russian,\nyawning. \"How kind of you to visit me. Do sit down.\" Not only was his\nRussian good; his voice was a good imitation of Pashkov's voice.\n\n\"You're not really sick?\" Pashkov asked, sitting down on the bed.\n\n\"Not physically. But imagine my psychological condition. When I look\nin the mirror--\" The colonel shuddered.\n\n\"I hope your sacrifice won't be permanent?\" Pashkov said.\n\n\"That would be too much. How is my Russian? The truth, now.\"\n\n\"Excellent. Put up your gun, Zubov. Colonel James and I don't get to\ntalk very often.\"\n\n\"And a pity we don't. Good manners accomplish more than an opera full\nof cloaks and daggers. Cigarette?\"\n\n\"Gratefully accepted,\" Zubov said, slipping his gun into its holster\nwith a flourish.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Your treatment is over, then?\" Pashkov asked. \"You are ready for your\nassignment?\"\n\n\"Ready.\"\n\n\"And that is?\"\n\n\"Delicate, very delicate. I must report to the Palace this morning.\"\n\n\"Shall I kidnap him now?\" Zubov interrupted, puffing conceitedly on his\ncigarette.\n\n\"Mind your language, Zubov. May I ask, Colonel--do you want me to think\nI am falling into a trap?\"\n\n\"No, no, my friend. I am only doing my best not to show my surprise at\nseeing you again.\" The colonel got out of bed and sat down on Pashkov's\nother side.\n\n\"Zubov will make your trip to Moscow comfortable. All right, Zubov.\"\n\nZubov focused his crossed eyes on Pashkov.\n\n\"Take him straight to Petchareff,\" Colonel James said to Zubov. \"I'll\nreport as soon as I know what these Swedes are up to.\"\n\nZubov seized Pashkov by the scruff of the neck and dragged him towards\nthe window.\n\n\"Hold your claws, Zubov lad,\" Pashkov said. \"You have got the wrong\nman, can't you see? _That_ is Colonel James.\"\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\n\"Use your eyes, blockhead. _I_ am Pashkov.\"\n\nZubov did use his eyes. He looked from one to the other, and back. The\nmore he focused, the more his eyes crossed. \"Eh?\"\n\nColonel James sat calmly on the bed. He said, \"Carry him out.\"\n\nZubov lifted Pashkov off the floor, crashed with his weight against the\nwall, but held on, grinned and staggered with Pashkov in his arms to\nthe window.\n\n\"You miserable idiot,\" Pashkov shouted. \"You'll get a rest cure for\nthis!\"\n\nZubov dropped him, pulled his gun and backed off into a corner. \"How\ncan I tell you two apart just by looking!\" he cried hysterically. \"I'm\nnot a learned man.\"\n\n\"One small but decisive proof,\" Pashkov said, unbuttoning his hospital\ngown. \"I have a mole.\"\n\nZubov yanked the colonel up by an arm. \"Send _me_ to rest cures, will\nyou?\"\n\nColonel James sighed. \"I guess we have to keep up appearances,\" he\nmuttered, and climbed out the window into the hovering ambulance. Zubov\nleaped in after, and they were off.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe suit of clothes hanging in the closet might have been Pashkov's\nown, identical with the clothes Kolya had taken to Moscow not an hour\nbefore. Even the underwear had facsimiles of the Order of Lenin sewn in.\n\nSatisfied, he crawled into the bed and fell into a pleasant snooze.\n\nHe was awakened by the nurse, Anastina Bjorklund--alias Anastasia\nSemionovna Bezumnaya, formerly of the Stakhanovite Booster's Committee,\nMoscow Third Worker's District.\n\n\"Wonderful morning, Colonel James!\"\n\nPetchareff seldom let one agent know what another was doing.\n\nShe put a big breakfast tray on Pashkov's lap. \"Cloudy, damp, and\nwindy. London stock market caves in, race riots in South Africa, famine\nin India, earthquake in Japan, floods in the United States, general\nstrike in France, new crisis in Berlin. I ask you, what more can an\nidealist want?\"\n\n\"Good morning, Miss Bjorklund.\"\n\nThe breakfast tray was crammed with a liter of orange juice, four\nboiled eggs, six slices of bacon, four pancakes, two pork chops, four\nslices of toast, a tumbler of vodka, a pot of coffee and two cigars.\n\n\"Ah, Colonel,\" Anastina said as Pashkov fell to, \"why did you let them\nchange your face? It does not become you at all.\"\n\n\"Part of my job. Don't you think I am more handsome now?\"\n\nAnastina laughed shrilly. \"That bulbous nose handsome? What woman could\nfall in love with a nose like that?\"\n\n\"It shows determination. I wish I had this nose permanently.\"\n\n\"You mustn't talk like that. But I'll ignore your nose if you tell me\nmore about White Sands Proving Grounds, as you promised.\"\n\n\"With pleasure, with pleasure,\" he said, sinking his teeth into a pork\nchop, having seasoned the chop with the soft-boiled egg yolk. \"But\nright now I'm in a hurry to get to the Palace. Give my shoes an extra\nshine, there's a good girl.\"\n\n\"Oh, you and your secrets!\"\n\nAn hour later, Pashkov landed on the Palace roof in Colonel James'\nflier--an exact copy of his own flier. The Palace roof captain stared\nat him, then smiled nervously.\n\n\"They are waiting for you in the Gustavus room, Colonel.\"\n\n\"Colonel? Do I still look like Colonel James?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, sir.\"\n\n\"Do I talk like Colonel James?\"\n\n\"You've changed completely, sir. If I didn't know, I would swear you\nwere the notorious Gospodin Pashkov.\"\n\n\"I am Gospodin Pashkov now, Captain. To everybody.\"\n\n\"Of course, sir. I'll ring down you are coming.\"\n\nPashkov glanced at his watch. Colonel James would be landing in Moscow\nabout now and taken to Comrade Petchareff for questioning.\n\nA manservant in velvet cutaways, patent leather shoes and white gloves,\nescorted Pashkov through rooms hung with chandeliers, tapestries,\npaintings. Pashkov entered the last room and stopped as the door\nclicked shut behind him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the room were three men, all of whom he recognized: Professor\nKristin of the Swedish Academy, a white-haired old man with a kind,\nintelligent face; the king, Gustavus IX, a thin old man stroking his\nVandyke, sitting under a portrait of Frederick the Great; and Monsieur\nFanti, the make-up surgeon.\n\nPashkov bowed his head. \"Your majesty. Gentlemen.\"\n\n\"Extraordinary!\" Professor Kristin said.\n\nPashkov turned to the surgeon. \"Monsieur, should my face have such a\nfrivolous expression?\"\n\nM. Fanti raised his eyebrows, but did not answer.\n\n\"I thought,\" said Pashkov, \"that Gospodin Pashkov's face has a more\nbrutal look.\"\n\n\"Propaganda,\" said the artist. But he came closer and looked at\nPashkov's face with sudden interest.\n\nProfessor Kristin said, \"Colonel James, we presume you have studied\nthe problem in detail. I'm afraid we have delayed announcing the Nobel\nprize for literature much too long. How soon can you bring Boris\nKnackenpast to Stockholm?\"\n\nSo there it was: Boris Knackenpast a supreme success, as Pashkov had\nsuspected. It would be amusing to tell robotist Medvedev about it.\n\n\"Delicate, very delicate,\" Pashkov said. \"Everything depends on my not\nrunning into Gospodin Pashkov.\"\n\n\"We can't wait any longer,\" Professor Kristin said. \"Fortunately, we\nhave an ally in the enemy camp. The robotist, Medvedev, is expecting\nyou at Knackenpast's villa.\"\n\n\"Bad show,\" M. Fanti said suddenly. \"No good. His left cheekbone is at\nleast four centimeters too high.\"\n\nThe men looked at the surgeon, then at Pashkov.\n\nM. Fanti fingered Pashkov's cheekbone. \"How could I have made such a\nmistake! Just look at him. People laugh at such faces.\"\n\n\"How much time to correct the error then, Monsieur Fanti?\" the king\nasked.\n\n\"A week at least. His skin needs a rest. I must rework the whole left\nside of his face--it's all lopsided.\"\n\n\"But we can't spare a week,\" Professor Kristin said.\n\n\"With your majesty's permission,\" Pashkov offered, \"I am willing to go\nas I am. Indeed, my plans call for immediate departure.\"\n\n\"It is a good thing you do for us, Colonel James,\" Gustavus IX said,\n\"and a courageous thing. Please accept our thanks.\"\n\nProfessor Kristin saw Pashkov to the door. \"One suggestion, Colonel.\nYour r's are still too soft for a real Russian. Why do you Americans\nslur them like that? And I beg you, if you value your life, do not fail\nto watch your fricatives.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe roof captain saluted as Pashkov stepped out of the lift. His flier\nwas serviced and ready.\n\n\"What weather in Moscow, Captain?\"\n\n\"Ceiling four thousand. We're having patrols half way out to sea. They\nare instructed to let you pass.\"\n\nA small incident, the roof captain explained. A Swedish Red Cross flier\nwas missing from the National Hospital. Two Cuban agents had been\narrested and a cache of small arms and ammunition was found. But no\ntrace of the ambulance.\n\n\"I suppose the Cubans deny stealing the ambulance?\" Pashkov asked.\n\n\"They say they've been framed by a fat little Russian. But it's\ntransparent, a clumsy job. Imagine, they left a stolen car in the\nambulance court and in it an invoice for six cases of ammunition. It\nwas traced to the Cubans in half an hour.\"\n\nPashkov climbed into his flier. \"Well, it's fashionable to blame the\nRussians for everything.\" He waved his chubby hand, and took off.\nFlying over the Baltic, he set the controls on the Moscow beam.\n\nTen minutes west of Moscow he tuned the communicator in on Petchareff's\noffice.\n\n\"Seven One Three here, Nadezhda. Tell Petchareff--no, let me talk to\nhim.\"\n\n\"Seven One ... but that's impossible! Gospodin Pashkov is in conference\nwith Comrade Petchareff.\"\n\n\"Stupid!\" Petchareff's voice sounded behind Nadezhda's, and the speaker\nclicked and went dead.\n\nPashkov dove into the clouds and brought his flier to a hovering stop.\n\nPetchareff did not believe he was Pashkov. Colonel James, it was clear,\nwas at that moment in Petchareff's office, impersonating Pashkov. And\nZubov was probably getting a rest cure.\n\nPashkov crawled out of the cloud and skimmed northeast to Mir, Boris\nKnackenpast's villa.\n\n\"You came fast, sir,\" the lieutenant of guards welcomed him at Mir. \"We\ndid not expect you for another fifteen minutes.\"\n\nFifteen minutes. The colonel was not wasting time.\n\n\"Listen carefully, lieutenant.\" Pashkov described the American agent.\n\"But his left cheekbone is lower than mine--about four centimeters. He\nmay be armed, so be careful.\"\n\nThe lieutenant stared. \"Shall we kill him?\"\n\n\"No, no. Put him in a cage.\"\n\nAs Pashkov ran up the steps to the villa, the curtain in the vestibule\nwindow stirred. But when he entered, the vestibule was empty.\n\nHe looked in the dining room, the music room, the library. Nobody.\nThe house was strangely quiet. He came to the door of the study and\nlistened. Not a sound. He went in and there, behind the large writing\ndesk, sat Boris Knackenpast.\n\nThe robot was unscrewing screws imbedded in his neck.\n\n\"My God, sir,\" said Pashkov, \"what are you doing?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe robot's eyes, large disks of glittering mirror, flashed as he\nlooked up. \"Ah, Colonel James,\" Boris said in a voice that seemed to\ncome from a deep well. \"Excuse the poor welcome, but I understand we\nhave little time. You scared my valet; he thought you were Gospodin\nPashkov.\"\n\nThe door burst open and Medvedev rushed in, the old valet at his heels.\nMedvedev stopped, gaped, then seized Pashkov's hand. \"Colonel James!\nWhat an artist, that Monsieur Fanti. But quick, Boris, Pashkov is on\nhis way.\"\n\nBoris pulled off his head, and crawled out of the robot shell. Pashkov\nsaw Boris as he really was, a tall human with a gaunt, ascetic face.\n\nThe sad thing about us, thought Pashkov, is that Medvedev could not\ntrust even me. But then I could not trust Medvedev, either. Yes, that's\nthe trouble with us.\n\n\"I hope you need no luggage, Mister Knackenpast,\" Pashkov said. \"We\nmust be off at once.\"\n\n\"Too late!\" the old valet said from the window.\n\nColonel James had landed. But as he climbed down from his flier, the\nguards closed a circle about him.\n\n\"He'll keep,\" Pashkov said, hitching up his pants. \"Let's be off,\nMister Knackenpast. It won't take long for Petchareff to smell us out.\"\n\n\"Look!\"\n\nThe guards fell back from the flier and snapped to attention. Chewing\non his cigar furiously, out stepped Petchareff.\n\nZubov leaped out next, his big front tooth flashing. Then his two\nassistants, Petya and Kolya, tumbled out in their coats and hats. Last\nof all to emerge from the flier was Nadezhda Brunhildova.\n\n\"Pretend not to know me, will he?\" she yelled at Colonel James, picking\nup a rock.\n\n\"Hold it, citizenress,\" Colonel James said.\n\n\"Citizenress, is it?\" The rock flew over his head and felled Zubov.\n\n\"I warned you both, no kitchen squabbles while on duty,\" Petchareff\nroared. He snapped an order to the lieutenants of guards, and the\nguards surrounded the house.\n\n\"No alarm, no alarm,\" Pashkov said, pulling Boris away from the window.\n\"Mister Knackenpast, when you see your way clear to my flier, run for\nit. But get back into your robot costume.\"\n\n\"I can't operate the machine.\"\n\n\"I'll be right behind you. The rest of us will go out to Petchareff.\"\n\nAs they came out, Petchareff was reviving Zubov by slapping his face.\nThe kidnaping expert lay stretched cold on the ground, and Nadezhda\nBrunhildova stood by, holding the rock and weeping.\n\nColonel James said, \"There he is, the American spy.\"\n\nPetchareff looked up as Pashkov was led forward by the guards. \"Not\nbad,\" Petchareff said. \"We could use Monsieur Fanti. What's his price?\"\n\n\"Don't you know me, chief? Me, Pashkov.\"\n\n\"Curse me,\" Nadezhda said, staring at him. \"Another Pashkov.\"\n\nA terrible howl came from Zubov. Petya and Kolya, imitating\nPetchareff's efforts to revive their master, were battering Zubov's\nface with their slouched hats.\n\n\"Stand back!\" Kolya screamed, smashing his hat into Zubov's face. \"He\nis trying to say something!\"\n\n\"He's moving!\" Petya kicked Zubov and looked up for approval, his hair\nstanding up like spikes.\n\nPetchareff slapped Kolya's face and crushed the glowing end of his\ncigar on Petya's forehead. The apes reeled back to a tree.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPashkov whispered to Colonel James.\n\n\"Capitalist hell and damnation, now I can't tell them apart myself,\"\nPetchareff said. \"Zubov!\"\n\n\"Hhng?\"\n\n\"Which one's the real Pashkov?\"\n\n\"Hhng?\"\n\nBut Colonel James was running to the flier, throwing Nadezhda's rock at\nPetchareff and running.\n\n\"Grenade!\" Pashkov yelled, and flung himself to the ground.\n\nAt the same moment Boris Knackenpast ran from the house to the flier,\nhis robot gear clattering like Don Quixote's armor.\n\nThe guards scattered and dove for cover.\n\n\"Down, lads! Grenade!\" Pashkov yelled.\n\nThe two apes took up the cry, \"Grenade, grenade!\" and flattened\nthemselves behind the tree.\n\nNadezhda and Medvedev collided, digging in behind the valet.\n\nOnly Petchareff remained standing. \"Stop the robot!\"\n\nNobody moved.\n\nBoris reached the flier, Colonel James pulled him in, the engine\nhummed, and they were off. A moment later the flier vanished in the\nclouds towards Stockholm.\n\nPetchareff relit his cigar. \"Tfui, tastes of monkey hair.\"\n\nMedvedev shambled over. \"Was the grenade a dud?\"\n\n\"One of these days I'll catch you, Pashkov,\" Petchareff spat. \"Your\ndeviousness, that's one thing. It could be useful. But your levity--\"\n\n\"Darling!\" Nadezhda threw on Pashkov.\n\n\"Not in public,\" Pashkov said.\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" Petchareff said. \"Nadezhda Brunhildova, how do you\nknow he really is Pashkov? If he's actually Colonel James, I can shoot\nhim summarily. He _does_ look like Colonel James to me.\"\n\n\"But if you're mistaken?\" Medvedev put in nervously.\n\n\"We all make mistakes,\" Petchareff said. \"What would history be without\nmistakes?\"\n\n\"I don't trust him either,\" Nadezhda said. \"But I know my Pashkov. If\nhe's not Pashkov, I shall let you know in the morning.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Cool War, by Andrew Fetler\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE COOL WAR ***\n\n***** This file should be named 51256-8.txt or 51256-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/1/2/5/51256/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
