SMITH\n\nIllustrated by DICK FRANCIS\n\nTranscriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy Science Fiction\nJune 1956. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\ncopyright on this publication was renewed.\n\n     One thing Man never counted on to take along into space with\n     him was the Eternal Triangle--especially a true-blue\n     triangle like this!\n\n\n\"What's the matter, darling?\" James asked anxiously. \"Don't you like the\nplanet?\"\n\n\"Oh, I love the planet,\" Phyllis said. \"It's beautiful.\"\n\nIt was. The blue--really blue--grass, blue-violet shrubbery and,\nloveliest of all, the great golden tree with sapphire leaves and pale\npink blossoms, instead of looking alien, resembled nothing so much as a\nfairy-tale version of Earth.\n\nEven the fragrance that filled the atmosphere was completely delightful\nto Terrestrial nostrils--which was unusual, for most other planets, no\nmatter how well adapted for colonization otherwise, tended, from the\nhuman viewpoint, anyway, to stink. Not that they were not colonized\nnevertheless, for the population of Earth was expanding at too great a\nrate to permit merely olfactory considerations to rule out an otherwise\nsuitable planet. This particular group of settlers had been lucky,\nindeed, to have drawn a planet as pleasing to the nose as to the\neye--and, moreover, free from hostile aborigines.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAs a matter of fact, the only apparent evidence of animate life were the\nsmall, bright-hued creatures winging back and forth through the clear\nair, and which resembled Terrestrial birds so closely that there had\nseemed no point to giving them any other name. There were insects, too,\nalthough not immediately perceptible--but the ones like bees were devoid\nof stings and the butterflies never had to pass through the grub stage\nbut were born in the fullness of their beauty.\n\nHowever, fairest of all the creatures on the planet to James Haut--just\nthen, anyhow--was his wife, and the expression on her face was not a\nlovely one.\n\n\"You do feel all right, don't you?\" he asked. \"The light gravity gets\nsome people at first.\"\n\n\"Yes, I guess I'm all right. I'm still a little shaken, though, and you\nknow it's not the gravity.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe would have liked to take her in his arms and say something\ncomforting, reassuring, but the constraint between them had not yet been\nworn off. Although he had sent her an ethergram nearly every day of the\nvoyage, the necessarily public nature of the messages had kept them from\nachieving communication in the deeper sense of the word.\n\n\"Well, I suppose you did have a bit of a shock,\" he said lamely.\n\"Somehow, I thought I had told you in my 'grams.\"\n\n\"You told me plenty in the 'grams, but not quite enough, it seems.\"\n\nHer words didn't seem to make sense; the strain had evidently been a\nlittle too much. \"Maybe you ought to go inside and lie down for a\nwhile.\"\n\n\"I will, just as soon as I feel less wobbly.\" She brushed back the long,\nlight brown hair which had got tumbled when she fainted. He remembered a\ngolden rather than a reddish tinge in it, but that had been under the\nyellow sun of Earth; under the scarlet sun of this planet, it took on a\ndifferent beauty.\n\n\"How come the preliminary team didn't include--_it_ in their report?\"\nshe asked, avoiding his appreciative eye.\n\n\"They didn't know. We didn't find out ourselves until we'd sent that\nfirst message to Earth. I suppose by the time we did relay the news, you\nwere on your way.\"\n\n\"Yes, that must have been it.\"\n\nThe preliminary exploration team had established the fact that the\nplanet was more or less Earth-type, that its air was breathable, its\ntemperature agreeably springlike, its mineral composition very similar\nto Earth's, with only slight traces of unknown elements, that there was\nplenty of drinkable water and no threatening life-forms. Human beings\ncould, therefore, live on it.\n\nIt remained for the scout team to determine whether human beings would\n_want_ to live on it--whether, in fact, they themselves would want to,\nbecause, if so, they had the option of becoming the first settlers. That\nwas the way the system worked and, in the main, it worked well enough.\n\nAfter less than two weeks, this scout team had beamed back to Earth the\nmessage that the planet was suitable for colonization, so suitable that\nthey would like to give it the name of Elysium, if there was no\nobjection.\n\nThere would be none, Earth had replied, so long as the pioneers bore in\nmind the fact that six other planets had previously been given that\nname, and a human colony currently existed on only one of those. No need\nto worry about a conflict of nomenclature, however, because the name of\nthat other planet Elysium had subsequently been changed by unanimous\nvote of settlers to Hades.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter this somewhat sinister piece of information, Earth had added the\nmore cheerful news that the wives and families of the scouts would soon\nbe on their way, bringing with them the tools and implements necessary\nto transform the wilderness of the frontier into another Earth. In the\nmeantime, the men were to set up the packaged buildings with which all\nscout ships were equipped, so that when the women came, homes would be\nready for them.\n\nThe men set to work and, before the month was out, they discovered that\nElysium was neither a wilderness nor a frontier. It was populated by an\nintelligent race which had developed its culture to the limit of its\nphysical abilities--actually well beyond the limit of what the astounded\nTerrestrials could have conceived its physical abilities to be--then,\nowing to unavoidable disaster, had started to die out.\n\nThe remaining natives were perspicacious enough to see in the\nTerrestrials' coming not a threat but a last hope of revivifying their\nown moribund species. Accordingly, the Earthmen were encouraged to go\nahead building on the sites originally selected, the only ban being on\nthe type of construction materials used--and a perfectly reasonable one\nunder the circumstances.\n\nJames had built his cottage near the largest, handsomest tree in the\narea allotted to him; since there were no hostile life-forms, there was\nno need for a closely knit community. Everyone who had seen it agreed\nthat his house was the most attractive one of all, for, although it was\nonly a standard prefab, he had used taste and ingenuity to make it a\nlittle different from the other unimaginative homes.\n\nAnd now Phyllis, for whom he had performed all this labor of love, for\nwhom he had waited five long months--the tedium of which had been broken\nonly by the intellectual pleasure of teaching English to a sympathetic\nnative neighbor--Phyllis seemed unappreciative. She had hardly looked at\nthe inside of the cottage, when he had shown her through, and now was\nstaring at the outside in a blank sort of way.\n\nThe indoctrination courses had not, he reflected, reconciled her to the\nfrontiersman's necessarily simple mode of living--which was ironic,\nconsidering that one of her original attractions for him had been her\napparent suitability for the pioneer life. She was a big girl, radiantly\nhealthy, even though a little green at the moment.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe just managed to keep his voice steady. \"You don't like the house--is\nthat it?\n\n\"But I _do_ like it. Honestly I do.\" She touched his arm diffidently.\n\"Everything would be perfect if only--\"\n\n\"If only what? Is it the curtains? I'm sorry if you don't like them. I\nbrought them all the way from Earth in case the planet turned out to be\nhabitable. I thought blue was your favorite color.\"\n\n\"Oh, it is, it is! I'm mad about the curtains.\"\n\nPerhaps it wasn't the house that disappointed her; perhaps it was he\nhimself who hadn't lived up to dim memory and ardent expectation.\n\n\"If you want to know what _is_ bothering me--\" she glanced up\napprehensively, lowering her voice as she did--\"it's that tree. It's\nstuck on you; I just know it is.\"\n\nHe laughed. \"Now where did you get a preposterous idea like that, Phyl?\nYou've been on the planet exactly twenty-four hours and--\"\n\n\"--and I have, in my luggage, one hundred and thirty-two ethergrams\ntalking about practically nothing but Magnolia this, Magnolia that. Oh,\nI had my suspicions even before I landed, James. The only thing I didn't\nsuspect was that she was a _tree_!\"\n\n\"What are you talking about, honey? Magnolia and I--we're just friends.\"\n\n\"Purely a platonic relationship, I assure you,\" the tree herself agreed.\nIt would have been silly for her to pretend not to have overheard, since\nthe two were still standing almost directly underneath her. \"Purely\nplatonic.\"\n\n\"She's more like a sister to me,\" James tried to explain.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPhyllis stiffened. \"Frankly, if I had imagined I was going to have a\ntree for a sister-in-law, I would have thought before I married you,\nJames.\" Bursting into tears, she ran inside the cottage.\n\n\"Sorry,\" he said miserably to Magnolia. \"It's a long trip out from Earth\nand an uncomfortable one. I don't suppose the other women were\nespecially nice to her, either. Faculty wives mostly and you know how\nthey are.... No, I don't suppose you would. But she shouldn't have acted\nthat way toward you.\"\n\n\"Not your fault,\" Magnolia told him, sighing with such intensity that he\ncould feel the humidity rise. \"I know how you've been looking forward to\nher arrival. Rather a letdown, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm sure it'll be all right.\" He tried to sound confident. \"And I\nknow you'll like Phyllis when you get to know her.\"\n\n\"Possibly, but so far I'm afraid I must admit--since there never has\nbeen any pretense between us--that she is a bit of a disappointment.\nI--and my sisters also--had expected your females, when they came, to be\nas upright and true blue as you. Instead, what are they? Shrubs.\"\n\nThe door to the cottage flew open. \"A shrub, am I!\" Phyllis brandished\nan axe which, James winced to recall, was an item of the equipment he\nhad ordered from Earth before the scout team had learned that the trees\nwere intelligent. \"I'll shrub you!\"\n\n\"Phyllis!\" He wrested the axe from her grip. \"That would be murder!\"\n\n\"'Woodman,' as the Terrestrial poem goes,\" the tree remarked, \"'spare\nthat tree! Touch not a single bough! In youth it sheltered me and I'll\nprotect it now!'\"\n\nGood of her to take the whole thing so calmly--rather, to pretend to\ntake it so calmly, for he knew how sensitive Magnolia really was--but he\nwas afraid this show of moral courage would not diminish Phyllis's\ndislike for her; those without self-control seldom appreciate those who\nhave it.\n\n\"If you'll excuse us,\" he said, putting his arm around his wife's\nheaving shoulders, \"I'd better see to Phyllis; she's a little upset.\nHoldover from spacesickness, I expect. Poor girl, she's a long way from\nhome and frightened.\"\n\n\"I understand, Jim,\" Magnolia told him, \"and, remember, whatever\nhappens, you can always count on me.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I must say you're not a very admirable representative of Terrestrial\nwomanhood!\" James snapped, as soon as the door had slammed behind him\nand his wife, leaving them alone together in the principal room of the\ncottage. \"Insulting the very first native you meet!\"\n\n\"I did not either insult her. All I said was, 'What beautiful\nflowers--do you suppose the fruit is edible?' How was I to know\nit--_she_ could understand? Naturally I wouldn't dream of eating her\nfruit now. It would probably taste nasty anyway. And how do you think\n_I_ felt when a _tree_ answered me back? You don't care that I fainted\ndead away, and I've never fainted before in my life. All you care about\nis that old vegetable's feelings! It was bad enough, feeling for five\nmonths that someone had come between us, but to find out it wasn't\nsome_one_ but some_thing_--!\"\n\n\"Phyllis,\" he said coldly, \"I'll thank you to keep a civil tongue in\nyour head.\"\n\nDropping into the overstuffed chair, his wife dabbed at her eyes with a\nhandkerchief. \"She wasn't so very polite to me!\"\n\n\"Look, Phyllis--\" he strove to make his voice calm, adult,\nreasonable--\"you happened to have hit on rather a touchy point with her.\nThose trees are dioecious, you know, like us, and she isn't mated. And,\nwell, she has rather a lot of xylem zones--rings, you know.\"\n\n\"Are you trying to tell me she's old?\"\n\n\"Well, she's no sapling any more. And, consideration aside, you know\nit's government's policy for us to establish good relations with any\nintelligent life-form we have to share a planet with. You weren't in\nthere trying.\"\n\nPhyllis put away her handkerchief with what he hoped would be a final\nsniff. \"I suppose I shouldn't have acted that way,\" she conceded.\n\n\"Now you're talking like my own dear Phyllis,\" James said tenderly,\nthough, as a matter of fact, he had a very remote idea of what his own\ndear Phyllis was like. He had met her only a couple of months before the\nscout mission was scheduled, and so their courtship had been brief, and\nthe actual weeks of marriage even briefer. He had remembered Phyllis as\nbeautiful--and she was beautiful. He had not, however, remembered her as\npig-headed--and pig-headed she was, too.\n\n\"How come she hasn't a mate? I didn't think trees were choosy.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe wouldn't take exception to that statement, uncharitable though it\nwas; after all, someone whose only acquaintance with trees had been with\nthe Terrestrial variety would naturally be incapable of appreciating the\ntotal tree at its highest development.\n\n\"It's a great tragedy,\" he told her in a hushed tone. \"There was a\nblight some years back and most of the male trees died off, except for a\nfew on the other side of the planet--well out of bee-shot, even if the\nfemales there would let the females here have any pollen, which they\nabsolutely won't.\"\n\n\"I don't blame them,\" Phyllis said coldly. Of course she would identify\nat once with the trees whose domestic lives seemed to be threatened.\n\n\"It's not that so much. It's that the male trees produce so little\npollen.\"\n\n\"This would be a good place for people with hay fever then, wouldn't\nit?\"\n\n\"And even when there is fruit, so much of it tends to be\nparthenocarpous--no seeds.\" He sighed. \"The entire race is dying out.\"\n\n\"How is it you know so much about botany?\" she asked suspiciously. \"It's\nnot your field.\"\n\n\"I don't know so very much, really,\" he smiled. \"I had to learn a\nlittle, if I wanted to work the land, so I borrowed an elementary text\nfrom Cutler.\" Had he been a trifle idealistic in quitting his snug, if\nuninspiring, job on the faculty to join in this Utopian venture? So many\nof the other men at the university had enrolled, it had seemed a\nsplendid idea until Phyllis's arrival.\n\n\"Daddy never had any trouble working his land and he doesn't know a\nthing about botany. You've been boning up on it just to please _her_!\"\n\n\"Phyllis! How can you jump to conclusions without a shred of evidence?\"\nNot that she wouldn't be able to collect such evidence later, because\nthe allegation happened to be correct. _If, instead of coming to\nElysium, I had merely gone to China, would she have thought it so odd\nthat I studied Chinese? Then why, where the natives are trees, shouldn't\nI study botany? The woman is unreasonable._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"And will her--people let you farm?\"\n\nNow he could show her how cogently and comprehensively he could answer a\nlogical question. \"That aspect of the situation will be all right, dear,\nbecause only the trees are an intelligent species and, even of them,\nsome aren't so bright. They won't have any more objection to our eating\nthe other fruit and vegetables than we would have to an\nextraterrestrial's eating our eggs and chickens, for example. We're\ngoing to try to introduce some Earth plants here, though, as the higher\nforms of vegetation are dying out and we're afraid the lower might\nfollow. Pity it's too late for a sound conservation program.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPhyllis said grimly, \"She doesn't think it's too late for a sound\nconservation program. She still has hopes--far-fetched, maybe, and I'm\nnot so sure they are. Mark my words, James, she's got designs on _you_.\"\n\n\"Don't be idiotic,\" he protested. \"That would be--\" he attempted to\nintroduce a light note--\"it would be miscegenation.\"\n\n\"These foreigners can't be expected to have our standards.\" And she\nburst into tears again. \"A fine thing to go through that miserable\nfive-month trip only to find out a tree has alienated my husband's\naffections.\"\n\n\"Oh, come on, Phyl!\" He still was trying for a smile. \"What would a tree\nsee in me?\"\n\n\"I'm beginning to wonder what I saw in you. You never loved me; you just\nwanted a wife to come out and colonize with you and b-b-breed.\"\n\nWhat could he say? It was almost true. Phyllis was a beautiful girl and\nhe loved her, but, if he had planned to remain as an instructor with the\nRomance Languages Department instead of joining the scout mission, he\nknew he would never have asked her to be his wife ... for her sake, of\ncourse, as well as his own. He should say something to reassure her, but\nthe words wouldn't come.\n\n\"I don't like it here,\" Phyllis sobbed. \"I don't like blue leaves. I\ndon't like blue grass. I like them green, the way they're supposed to\nbe. I hate this nasty planet. It's all wrong. I want to go home.\"\n\nShe was very young--less than eight years younger than he, true, but he\nwas mature for his age. They didn't know each other very well. And,\nfinally, there were more men than women on the planet and he had noticed\nthat the bachelors had seemed readily disposed, upon her arrival the day\nbefore, to overlook the fact that she had no college degree. So he must\nbe patient with her.\n\n\"There's nothing wrong about it, dear. The plants here synthesize\ncyanophyll instead of chlorophyll; that's why the leaves are blue\ninstead of green. And, of course, there are different mineral\nconstituents of the soil--more aluminum and copper, for instance, than\non Earth, and some elements we haven't quite isolated yet. So, you see,\nthey're bound to be a little different from Terrestrial trees.\"\n\n\"A little different I wouldn't mind,\" she said sulkily, \"but they're a\nlot different without being nearly alien enough.\"\n\n\"Look, Phyllis--_dear_--those trees have been very hospitable, very\nkind. We owe them a lot. They themselves suggested that we come here and\nlive with them in, so to speak, symbiosis.\"\n\n\"That's a fine idea!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe beamed. \"I knew you'd understand after I had explained it to you.\"\n\n\"We provide the brains and they provide the furniture.\"\n\n\"Phyllis! What a thing to say!\"\n\n\"I've heard of man-eating trees before. I suppose there could be\nman-loving ones, too.\"\n\n\"Phyllis, these trees are as gentle and sweet as--as--\" He didn't know\nhow he could explain it to her. No one who had never been friends with a\ntree could appreciate the true beauty of the xylemic character. \"Why, we\neven offered to go over to the other side of the planet and fetch some\npollen for them, but they wouldn't hear of it. Unfortunately, they'd\nrather die than be mated to anyone they had never met.\"\n\n\"What a perfectly disgusting idea!\"\n\n\"I don't think so. Trees can be idealistic--\"\n\n\"You fetching pollen for her, I mean. Naturally she wouldn't want pollen\nfrom a tree on the other side of the planet. She wants _you_!\"\n\n\"Don't be silly. Incompatibility usually exists between the pollen of\none species and the stigmata of another. Besides,\" he added patiently,\n\"I haven't got pollen.\"\n\n\"You'd better not, or it won't be her who'll have the stigmata.\"\n\n\"Phyllis--\" he sat down on the arm of her chair and tried to embrace\nher--\"you know that you're the only life-form I love.\"\n\n\"Please, James.\" She pushed him away. \"I guess I love you, too, in spite\nof everything ... but I don't want to make a public spectacle of\nmyself.\"\n\n\"What do you mean now?\"\n\n\"That tree would know everything that goes on. She's telepathic.\"\n\n\"Where did you get a ridiculous idea like that? What kind of rubbish\nhave you been reading?\"\n\n\"All right, tell me: how else did she learn to speak such good English?\"\n\n\"It's because she's of a very high order of intelligence. And I\nsuppose--\" he laughed modestly--\"because I'm such a good teacher.\"\n\n\"I don't care how good a teacher you are--a tree couldn't learn to speak\na language so well in five months. She must be telepathic. It's the only\nexplanation.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Give her time,\" the tree advised later, as James came out on the lawn\nto talk to his only friend on the planet.\n\nHe hadn't seen much of the other scouts since the house-building frenzy\nhad started, and visits among the men had decreased. The base camp,\nwhere the bachelors and the older married couples lived, was located a\ngood distance away from his land, for he had raised his honeymoon\ncottage far from the rest; he had wanted to have his Phyllis all to\nhimself. In the idyll he had visualized for the two of them, she would\nneed no company but his. Little had he imagined that, within twenty-four\nhours of her arrival, he would be looking for company himself.\n\n\"I suppose so,\" he said, kicking at a root. \"Oh, I'm sorry, Maggie; I\ndidn't think.\"\n\n\"That's all right,\" Magnolia said bravely. \"It didn't really hurt. That\nfemale has got you all upset, you poor boy.\"\n\nJames muttered a feeble defense of his wife.\n\n\"Jim, forgive me if I speak frankly,\" the tree went on in a low rustle,\n\"but do you think she's really worthy of you?\"\n\n\"Of course she is!\"\n\n\"Surely on your planet you could have found a mate more admirable,\nhigh-minded, exemplary--more, in short, like yourself. Or are all the\nhuman females inferior specimens like Phyllis?\"\n\n\"They're--she suits me,\" James said doggedly.\n\n\"Of course, of course. It's very noble of you to defend her; you would\nhave disappointed me if you had said anything else, and I honor you for\nit, James.\"\n\nHe kicked at one of the pebbles. The tree meant well, he knew, yet, like\nso many well-meaning friends, she succeeded only in dispiriting him. It\nwas almost like being back at the faculty club.\n\n\"I don't suppose a clod like her would have brought any more books\nalong,\" the tree changed the subject. James's own library had been\ninsufficient to slake the tree's intellectual thirst, so he had gone all\nover the planet to borrow books for Magnolia. Dr. Lakin, at Base, who\nhad formerly taught English literature, possessed a fine collection\nwhich he had been reluctant to lend until he had learned that they were\nnot for James but for a tree. At that, he had fetched the books himself,\nsince he was anxious to meet her.\n\n\"A lot of the trees here have learned the English language,\" he had told\nJames, \"but none seems to have developed a taste for its literature.\nYour Magnolia is undoubtedly a superior specimen. Excellent natural\ntaste, too--perhaps a little unformed when it comes to poetry and the\nmore sophisticated aspects of life, but she'll learn, she'll learn.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUnfortunately, the same, James knew, could hardly be said of his wife.\n\"Phyllis did bring some books,\" he told Magnolia.\n\n\"For you, no doubt. That was kind of her. I'm sure she has many good\nqualities which will unfold one by one, as her meristems start\ndifferentiating. I hope you don't feel I've been too--well, personal,\nJim. I was only trying to help. If I've gone too far....\"\n\n\"Of course not, Maggie. After all--\" he laughed bitterly--\"I do know you\nbetter than I know her.\"\n\n\"We _have_ been good friends, haven't we, Jim? It was rather nice--these\nfive months we spent alone together. For the first time in my life, I\nhave never regretted being so far from my sisters. 'And this our life,\nexempt from public haunt, finds tongues in trees, books in the running\nbrooks, sermons in stones, and good in everything.'\"\n\nHer blue leaves shone violet in the scarlet rays of the setting sun; the\ngold of her trunk was lit with red radiance. She was the most beautiful\ncreature he had ever seen ... but she was a tree, not a woman.\n\n\"I'm sure she'll fit in after a while,\" Magnolia continued. \"Perhaps she\nisn't well. She seems to guttate an awful lot. Do you suppose she's been\noverwatered?\"\n\n\"That wasn't guttation,\" James said heavily. \"It was tears. It means\nshe's unhappy.\"\n\n\"Unhappy? Perhaps she won't fit in on this planet, in which case she\nshould by all means go back to Earth. It's cruel and unfair to keep an\nintelligent--loosely speaking--life-form anywhere against her will,\ndon't you think?\"\n\n\"She'll be happy here,\" James vowed. \"I'll _make_ her happy.\"\n\n\"Well, I certainly hope you can manage it! By the way, do you suppose\nyou'll have a chance to read me the books she brought, or will she be\nkeeping you too busy?\"\n\n\"I'll never be too busy to read to you, Magnolia.\"\n\n\"That's very nitrogenous of you, Jim. Our--intellectual communions have\nmeant a lot to me. I'd hate to have to give them up.\"\n\n\"So would I,\" he said. \"But there won't be any need to. Phyllis will\nunderstand.\"\n\n\"I certainly hope so. I so admire your English literature. It's so\ndeeply cognizant of the really meaningful things in life. And if your\ncoming to this planet has served only to add poetry to our cultural\nheritage, it would be reason enough to welcome you with open limbs. For\nit was a truly perceptive versifier who wrote the immortally simple\nlines: 'Poems are made by fools like me, but only God can make a tree.'\n\n\"And such a charming tune to go with it, too,\" Magnolia went on. \"We\nhave always sung the music that the wind and the rain have taught us,\nbut, until you came, we never thought of putting words and melody\ntogether to form one glorious whole. 'A tree that may in summer wear,'\"\nshe caroled in a pleasing contralto, \"'a nest of robins in her hair.' By\nthe way, Jim, ever since reading that poem, I've been meaning to ask you\nprecisely what are robins and do you think they'd look well in my hair,\nby which, I suppose the bard refers, in a somewhat pedestrian flight of\nfancy, to leaves?\"\n\n\"They're a kind of bird,\" he said drearily.\n\n\"Birds--nesting in my hair! I wouldn't think of allowing it. But then I\nsuppose Terrestrial birds are quite different from ours? More\nhousebroken, shall we say?\"\n\n\"Everything's different,\" James said and, for an irrational moment, he\nhated everything that was blue that should have been green, everything\nsweet that should have been vicious, everything intelligent that should\nhave been mindless.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSince matters could not grow much worse, they improved to a degree.\nAfter a day or two had passed, Phyllis, being a conscientious girl, came\nto realize how wrong it had been for her as a Terrestrial immigrant to\nshow overt hostility toward a native of the planet that had welcomed\nher.\n\n\"But how can she be a--a person?\" Phyllis wanted to know, when they were\ninside the cottage, for she had learned to hold her tongue when they\nwere near Magnolia or any of her sisters, who, though they could not\nspeak the language as fluently as she, understood it very well and\neavesdropped at every possible opportunity in order, they said, to\nimprove their accents. \"She's a tree. A plant. And plants are just\nvegetables.\" She stabbed her needle energetically through the tablecloth\nshe was embroidering.\n\n\"You mustn't project Terrestrial attitudes upon Elysian ones,\" James\nsaid, patiently looking up from his book. \"And don't underestimate\nMagnolia's capabilities. She has sense organs, and motor organs, too.\nShe can't move from where she is, because she's rooted to the ground,\nbut she's capable of turgor movements, like certain Terrestrial forms of\nvegetation--for example, the sensitive plant or blue grass.\"\n\n\"Blue grass,\" Phyllis exclaimed. \"I'm sick of blue grass. I want green\ngrass.\"\n\n\"However, these trees have conscious control of their _pulvini_, whereas\nthe Earth's plants don't, and so they can do a lot of things that Earth\nplants can't.\"\n\n\"It sounds like a dirty word to me.\"\n\n\"_Pulvini_ merely means motor organs.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe closed his book, which was a more advanced botany text, covered with\nthe jacket of a French novel in order to spare Phyllis's feelings.\n\"Darling, can't you get it through your pretty head that they're\nintelligent life-forms? If it'll make it easier for you to think of them\nas human beings who happen to look like trees, then do that.\"\n\n\"That's exactly what I _am_ doing. And I'm quite sure she thinks of you\nas a tree who happens to look like a human being.\"\n\n\"Phyllis, sometimes I think you're being deliberately difficult. Do you\nknow one of the reasons why I took such pains to teach Magnolia English?\nIt was that I hoped she would be a companion for you, that you could\ntalk to each other when I had to be away from home.\"\n\n\"Why do you call her Magnolia? She isn't a lot like one.\"\n\n\"Isn't she? I thought she was. You see, I don't know so much botany,\nafter all.\" Actually, he had picked that name for the tree because it\nexpressed both the arboreal and the feminine at the same time--and also\nbecause it was one of the loveliest names he knew. But he couldn't tell\nPhyllis that; there would be further misunderstanding. \"Of course she\nhas a name in her own language, but I can't pronounce it.\"\n\n\"They _do_ have a language of their own then?\"\n\n\"Naturally, though they don't get much chance to speak it, since they've\ngrown so few and far apart that verbal communication has become\ndifficult. They communicate by a network of roots that they've\ndeveloped.\"\n\n\"I don't think that's so clever.\"\n\n\"I merely said ... oh, what's the use of trying to explain everything to\nyou? You just don't want to understand.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPhyllis put down her needlework and closed her eyes. \"James,\" she said,\nopening them again, \"it's no use pretending. I've been trying to be\nsympathetic and understanding, but I can't do it. That tree--I've forced\nmyself to be nice to her, but the more I see of her, the more convinced\nI am that she's trying to steal you from me.\"\n\nPhyllis was beginning to poison his mind, he thought, because it had\nseemed to him also, in his last conversation with Magnolia, that he had\ndiscerned more than ordinary warmth in her attitude toward him ... and\nperhaps a trace of spite toward his wife?\n\nPreposterous! The tree had only been trying to cheer him up as any\nfriend might reasonably do. After all, a tree and a man.... Nonsense!\nOne had an anabolic metabolism, one a catabolic.\n\nBut this was a different kind of tree. She spoke, she read, she was\ncapable of conscious turgor movements. And he, he had often thought\nsecretly, was a different kind of man. Whereas Phyllis....\n\nBut that was disloyalty--to the type as well as the individual. The tree\ncould be a companion to him, but she could not give him sons to work his\nland; she could not give him daughters to populate his planet; moreover,\nshe did not, could not possibly know what human love meant, while\nPhyllis could at least learn.\n\n\"Look, dear,\" he said, sitting down beside his wife on the couch and\ntaking her hand in his. She didn't draw away this time. \"Suppose that\nwhat you say is true--not that it is, of course. Just because the tree\nhas a crush on me doesn't mean I necessarily have a crush on her, does\nit?\"\n\nHis wife looked up at him, her rose-red lips parted, her moss-gray eyes\nshining. \"Oh, if only I could believe that, James!\"\n\n\"Anyhow, she doesn't know what the whole thing's about, poor kid!\"\n\n\"Poor _kid_!\"\n\n\"Phyllis, you know you're prettier than any tree.\" That was not\nliterally true, but reason was useless; he had to make his point in\nterms she could understand. \"And, remember, she's got a lot of\nrings--she must be centuries old--while you are only nineteen.\"\n\n\"Twenty,\" Phyllis corrected. \"I had a birthday on the ship.\"\n\n\"Well, you certainly must allow me to wish you a happy birthday,\ndarling.\"\n\nShe was in his arms at last; he was about to kiss her, and the tree\nseemed very remote, when she drew back. \"But are you sure she\ndoesn't--she isn't--she can't be watching us?\"\n\n\"Darling, I swear it!\" \"_Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear, that tips\nwith silver all these fruit-tree tops_\".... But he had sense enough not\nto say it, and Elysium had not one blessed moon, but three, and\neverything was all right.\n\nFor a while anyway.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I see your wife is developing a corm,\" the tree remarked, as James\npaused for a chat. He hadn't much time to be sociable those days, for\nthere was such a lot of work to be done, so many preparations to be\nmade, so many things to be requisitioned from Earth. The supply ships\nwere beginning to come now, bringing necessities and an occasional\nluxury for those who could afford it.\n\n\"She's pregnant,\" James explained. \"Happened before I left Earth.\"\n\n\"How do you mean?\"\n\n\"She's about to fruit. Didn't I read that zoology book to you?\"\n\n\"Yes, but--oh, James, it all seems so vulgar! To fruit without ever\nhaving bloomed--how squalid!\"\n\n\"It all depends on how you look at it,\" he said. \"I--that is, we had\nhoped that when the baby came, you would be godmother to it. You know\nwhat that is, don't you?\"\n\n\"Of course I do. You read _Cinderella_ to me. I know it's a great honor.\nBut I'm afraid I must decline.\"\n\n\"Why? I thought you were my--our friend.\"\n\n\"Jim, there is something I must confess: my feelings toward you are not\nmerely those of a friend. Although Phyllis doesn't have too many rings\nof intellect, she is a female, so she knew all along.\" Magnolia's leaves\nrustled diffidently. \"I feel toward you the way I never felt toward any\nintelligent life-form, but only toward the sun, the soil, the rain. I\nsense a tropism that seems to incline me toward you. In fact, I'm\nafraid, Jim, in your own terms, I love you.\"\n\n\"But you're a tree! You can't love me in my own terms, because trees\ncan't love in the way people can, and, of course, people can't love like\ntrees. We belong to two entirely different species, Maggie. You can't\nhave listened to that zoology book very attentively.\"\n\n\"Our race is a singularly adaptable one or we wouldn't have survived so\nlong, Jim, or gone so far in our particular direction. It's lack of\nfertility, not lack of enterprise, that's responsible for our decline.\nAnd I think your species must be an adaptable one, too; you just haven't\nreally tried. Oh, James, let us reverse the classical roles--let me be\nthe Apollo to your Daphne! Don't let Phyllis stand in our way. The Greek\ngods never let a little thing like marriage interfere with their plans.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"But I love Phyllis,\" he said in confusion. \"I love you, too,\" he added,\n\"but in a different way.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know. More like a sister. However, I have plenty of sisters and\nI don't need a brother.\"\n\n\"We're starting a conservation program,\" he tried to comfort her. \"We\nhave every hope of getting some pollen from the other side of the planet\nonce we have explained to the trees there how far we can make a little\ngo, and you've got to accept it; you mustn't be silly about it.\"\n\n\"It isn't the same thing, Jim, and you know it. One of the penalties of\nintelligence is a diffusiveness of the natural instincts. I would\nrather not fruit at all than--\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Magnolia, you just don't understand. No matter how much you--well,\npursue me, I can never turn into a laurel tree.\"\n\n\"I didn't--\"\n\n\"Or any kind of tree! Look, some more books were just sent over from\nBase.\"\n\nMagnolia gave a rueful rustle. \"Just were sent? Didn't they come over a\nmonth ago?\"\n\nJames flushed. \"I know I haven't had a chance to do much reading to you\nin the last few weeks, Maggie--or any at all, in fact--but I've been so\nbusy. After the baby's born, things will be much less hectic and we'll\nbe able to catch up.\"\n\n\"Of course, James. I understand. Naturally your family comes first.\"\n\n\"One of the books that came was an advanced zoology text that might make\nthings a little clearer.\"\n\n\"I should very much like to hear it. When you have the time to spare,\nthat is.\"\n\n\"Tell you what,\" he said. \"I'll get the book and read you the chapter on\nthe reproductive system in mammals. Won't take more than an hour or so.\"\n\n\"If you're in a hurry, it can wait.\"\n\n\"No,\" he told her. \"This will make me feel a little less guilty about\nhaving neglected you.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Whereupon the umbilical cord is severed,\" he concluded, \"and the human\ninfant is ready to take its place in the world as a separate entity. Now\ndo you understand, Magnolia?\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"No,\" she said. \"Where do the bees come in?\"\n\n\"I thought you were in such a hurry to get to Base, James,\" Phyllis\nremarked sweetly from the doorway, wiping her reddening hands on a dish\ntowel.\n\n\"I am, dear.\" He slipped the book behind his back; it was possible that,\nin her present state of mind--induced, of course, by her delicate\ncondition--Phyllis might misunderstand his motive in reading that\nparticular chapter of that particular book to that particular tree. \"I\njust stopped for a chat with Magnolia. She's agreed to be godmother to\nthe baby.\"\n\n\"How very nice of her. Earth Government will be so pleased at such a\n_fine_ example of rapport with the natives. You might even get a medal.\nWouldn't that be nice?... James,\" she hurried on, before he could speak,\n\"you still haven't found any green-leafed plants on the planet, have\nyou? Have you looked everywhere? Have you looked _hard_?\"\n\n\"Haven't I told you time and time again, Mrs. Haut,\" the tree said,\n\"that there aren't any--that there can't be any? It's impossible to\nsynthesize chlorophyll from the light rays given off by our sun--only\ncyanophyll. What do you want with a green-leafed plant, anyway?\"\n\nPhyllis's voice broke. \"I think I'd lose my mind if I was convinced that\nI'd never see a green leaf again. All this awful blue, blue, blue, all\nthe time, and the leaves never fall, or, if they do, there are new ones\nright away to take their place. They're always there--always blue.\"\n\n\"We're everblue,\" Magnolia explained. \"Sorry, but that's the way it is.\"\n\n\"Jim, I hate to hurt your feelings, but I just have to take down those\ncurtains. The colors--I can't stand it!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Pregnant women sometimes get fanciful notions,\" James said to the tree.\n\"It's part of the pregnancy syndrome. Try not to pay any attention.\"\n\n\"Kindly don't explain me to a tree!\" Phyllis cried. \"I have a right to\nprefer green, don't I?\"\n\n\"There is, as your proverb says, no accounting for strange tastes,\" the\ntree murmured. \"However--\"\n\n\"We're going to have a formal christening,\" James interrupted, for the\nsake of the peace. \"We thought we should, since ours will be the first\nbaby born on the planet. Everybody on Elysium will come--that is, all\nthe human beings. Only because they _can_ come, you know; we'd love to\nhave the trees if they were capable of locomotor movement. You'll get to\nwiden your social contacts, Maggie. Dr. Lakin and Dr. Cutler will\nprobably be here; I know you'll be glad to see Dr. Lakin again, and\nyou've been anxious to meet Dr. Cutler. They've been asking after you,\ntoo. I think Dr. Lakin is planning to write a monograph on you for the\n_Journal of the American Association of Professors of English\nLiterature_--with your permission, of course.\"\n\n\"Christening--that's one of your native festivals, isn't it? It should\nbe most interesting.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Phyllis murmured. \"It will be Christmas soon. I'd almost\nforgotten. It'll be the first Christmas I've ever spent away from home.\nAnd there won't be any snow or--or anything.\" She started to guttate--to\ncry again.\n\n\"Cheer up, honey,\" Jim said. \"It won't be as bad as you think, because I\ndidn't forget Christmas was coming. There's something specially nice for\nyou on its way from Earth; I only hope it gets here on time.\" Phyllis\nsniffled. \"Maybe we'll have a Christmas party, too. Would you like\nthat?\" But she remained unresponsive.\n\nHe turned to the tree. \"Christening's entirely different, though,\" he\nexplained. \"It's--I guess naming the fruit would be the best way to\ndescribe it.\"\n\n\"Is that so?\" Magnolia said. \"What kind of fruit do you expect to have,\nMrs. Haut? Oranges? Bananas? As your good St. Luke says, the tree is\nknown by its fruit. You look as if yours might be a watermelon.\"\n\n\"Why, the--idea!\" Phyllis choked. \"Are you going to stand there, James,\nand let that _vegetable_ insult me?\"\n\n\"I'm sure she didn't mean to,\" he protested. \"She got confused by--that\nzoology book I read her.\"\n\nThe door slammed behind his weeping wife.\n\n\"I don't think you quite understand, Maggie,\" he said. \"In fact,\nsometimes I almost think you, too, don't want to understand.\"\n\n\"I know what kind of fruit it's going to be,\" the tree concluded\ntriumphantly. \"Sour apples.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Ouch,\" exclaimed Magnolia, \"that tickles! There's more to acting as a\nChristmas tree than I had anticipated from your glowing descriptions,\nJim.\"\n\n\"Here, dear,\" Phyllis said, \"maybe you'd better let me put the\ndecorations on her.\"\n\n\"You can't get on the ladder in your condition,\" he said, apprehensive\nnot only for her welfare but for the tree's. Phyllis had not taken\nkindly to the idea of having Magnolia as official Christmas tree,\nsuggesting that, if she must participate in the ceremonies, it might be\nbetter in the capacity of Yule log. However, Jim knew Magnolia would be\noffended if any other tree were chosen to be decorated.\n\n\"I'll manage all right,\" he assured his wife. \"If you want to be useful,\nyou might put on some coffee and make sandwiches or something. The\nbachelors are coming over from Base with that equipment that arrived\nyesterday, and they'll probably be glad of a snack before turning in.\"\n\n\"The coffee's already on and the canapes made,\" Phyllis smiled. \"And\nI've baked cookies, too, and whipped up a batch of penuche. What kind of\na Christmas party do you think it would be without refreshments?\"\n\n\"Very efficient, isn't she?\" Magnolia remarked, as the battery-powered\nlights that James had affixed to her began to wink on, for the deep\nred-violet dusk had already fallen and the first moon was rising. \"Have\nyou thought, Mrs. Haut, that if you fruit today, it will save the\nexpense of another festival?\"\n\n\"I don't expect to fruit for another two months,\" Phyllis said coldly,\n\"and why shouldn't we have another festival? We can afford it and I like\nparties. I haven't been to one since the day I landed.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Is the life out here getting a little quiet for you, petiole?\" the tree\nasked solicitously. \"It must be hard when one has no intellectual\nresources upon which to draw.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPhyllis held her peace for ten seconds; then, \"I wonder where those boys\ncan be,\" she said. \"I hope they bring some pickles along. I asked to\nhave some sent, but I'm accustomed to having no attention paid to what I\nwant.\"\n\n\"There's a surprise coming for you, Phyllis,\" James could not help\ntelling her again, hoping to arouse some semblance of interest.\n\"Something I know you'll love.... And for you, too,\" he said courteously\nto Magnolia.\n\n\"You mean the same surprise for both, or a surprise apiece?\" the tree\nasked.\n\n\"Oh, one for each, of course.\"\n\n\"I see the lights of the 'copter now!\" Phyllis cried and, running out\ninto the middle of the lawn, began waving her handkerchief. He hadn't\nseen her so pleasantly excited for a long time.\n\n\"I don't suppose I'll need to turn on the landing lights,\" he said to\nMagnolia. \"You should do the trick.\"\n\n\"Am I all finished?\" she rustled anxiously. \"I do wish I could see\nmyself. How do I look?\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Splendid. I've never had as beautiful a Christmas tree as you, Maggie,\"\nhe told her with complete honesty. \"Not even on Earth.\"\n\n\"I'm glad, Jim, but I still wish I could be more to you than just a\nChristmas tree.\"\n\n\"Shh. The others might hear.\"\n\nFor the helicopter had landed and the visitors were pouring out, with\nshouts of admiration. Not only the bachelors had come--and in full\nforce--but some of the older men from Base, who apparently felt they\ncould manage to do without their wives for twelve hours, even if those\nhours included Christmas Eve. He wondered where he and Phyllis could put\nthem all, but some could sleep outside, if need be, for it was never\ncold on Elysium. The winds were gentle and the rains light and fragrant.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhile the visitors were crowding around Phyllis and the tree, James\nrooted eagerly through the packages they had brought, until he found\nwhat he wanted. Then he rushed over to the group. \"I know I should wait\nuntil tomorrow, but I want to give the girls their presents now.\" The\nother men smiled sympathetically, almost as joyful as he. \"Merry\nChristmas, Magnolia!\" He hoped Phyllis would understand that it was\netiquette which dictated that the alien life-form should get her gift\nfirst.\n\n\"Thank you,\" the tree said. \"I am deeply touched. I don't believe anyone\never gave me a present before. What is it?\"\n\n\"Liquid plant food--vitamins and minerals, you know. For you to drink.\"\n\n\"What fun!\" she exclaimed in pretty excitement. \"Pour some over me right\nnow!\"\n\n\"Not so fast, Jim, boy!\" Dr. Cutler, the biologist, snatched the jug\nfrom James' hand. \"First you-all better let me take a sample of this\nhere stuff back to Base to test on a lower life-form, so's I can make\nsure it won't do anything bad to Miss Magnolia. Might have iron in it\nand I have a theory that iron may not be beneficial for the local\nvegetation.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you!\" the tree rustled. \"It's so very thoughtful of you,\nDoctor, but I'm sure Jim would never give me anything that would injure\nme.\"\n\n\"I'm sure he isn't fixing to do a thing like that, ma'am, but he's no\nbotanist.\"\n\n\"And for you, Phyllis....\" James handed his wife the awkward bundle to\nunwrap for herself.\n\nShe tore the papers off slowly. \"Oh, Jim, darling, it's--it's--\"\n\n\"You wanted a bit of green, so I ordered a plant from Earth. You like\nit? I hope you do.\"\n\n\"Oh, _Jim_!\" She embraced him and the pot simultaneously. \"More than\n_anything_!\"\n\n\"It won't stay green,\" Magnolia observed. \"Either it'll turn blue or\nit'll die. Puny-looking specimen, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said James, \"it's only a youngster. I guess this Christmas is\ntoo early, but next Christmas there ought to be berries. It's a holly\nplant, Phyl.\"\n\n\"Holly,\" she repeated, her voice shaking a little. \"_Holly._\" She and\nDr. Cutler exchanged glances.\n\n\"I told you, Miz Phyllis, ma'am--he may know the first thing about\nbotany, but he doesn't know anything after that.\"\n\n\"Jim,\" Phyllis said, linking her free arm through his, \"I misjudged you.\nDr. Cutler is right. You don't know so very much about botany, after\nall.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe looked at her blankly. Her voice was trembling, and not with tears\nthis time. \"I love this little plant; it's just what I wanted ... but\nthere aren't ever going to be any berries, because, to have berries, you\nhave to have two plants. And the right two. Holly's di--dio--it's just\nlike us.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" James said, feeling thoroughly inadequate. \"I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"But you mustn't be sorry. I'm going to plant it here on Elysium, and I\nhope it will stay green in spite of what she says, and it'll have\nblossoms anyway ... and it was very, very sweet of you, dear.\"\n\nShe kissed his cheek.\n\n\"Is this one a boy or a girl?\" Magnolia asked.\n\n\"You-all can't tell till it blooms, Miss Magnolia, ma'am,\" Dr. Cutler\ninformed her.\n\n\"Maybe I can. Hand it up here, please.\"\n\nPhyllis paused for an irresolute moment, then, smiling nervously at her\nguests, obliged.\n\n\"It's a boy,\" Magnolia announced, after a minute. \"A boy.\" She gave back\nthe pot reluctantly. \"Phyllis,\" she said, \"you and I have never been\nfriends and I admit that it's been my fault just as much as yours.\"\n\n\"As much as mine?\" Phyllis echoed. \"I like that--\" and was going to go\non when she obviously recollected that they had company, and stopped.\n\n\"So I know it's presumptuous of me to ask you a favor.\"\n\n\"Yes, Magnolia?\" Phyllis said, her fine cornsilk eyebrows arched a\ntrifle. \"What is this favor?\"\n\n\"When you plant the little fellow--you said you were going to,\nanyhow--would you plant him near me?\"\n\nPhyllis looked down at the plant she held cradled in her arms and then\nup at the tree. \"Of course, Magnolia,\" she said, frowning slightly. \"I\ndidn't realize....\" Her voice began to tremble. \"I _have_ been pretty\nrotten, haven't I?\" She looked toward James, but he turned his glance\naway.\n\n\"Just because you were a plant,\" Phyllis continued, \"didn't mean I had\nto be a b-b-beast. It must have been awful for you, seeing me like this,\npractically crowing over you, and knowing that you yourself would never\nhave the chance to be a m-m-m-mother.\"\n\n\"'Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,'\" Magnolia said sadly,\n\"'and waste its sweetness on the desert air.'\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPhyllis was crying unashamedly now. \"I'll plant him right next to\nyou--Maggie. I want you to have him. He can be your baby.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Phyl,\" Maggie said softly. \"That's very ... blue of you.\"\n\n\"Although I think that's a jim-dandy idea,\" the biologist said, \"and I\nsure wouldn't want to do anything to discourage it, being real\ninterested in the results of an experiment like that my own self, I\ndon't think you ought to feel so mean about it, Miz Phyllis. If all she\nwanted--begging your pardon, Miss Magnolia, ma'am--was a baby, why\ndidn't she take an interest in the holly until she found out it was a\nmale? Why wouldn't a little old girl holly have done as well?\"\n\n\"Why--why, you scheming vegetable!\" Phyllis exploded at Magnolia,\nclutching the holly plant to her protective bosom. \"He's much too young\nfor you, and I'm going to plant him far away, where he can't possibly\nfall into your clutches.\"\n\n\"Now, Miss Phyllis, we-all mustn't look at things out of their proper\nperspective.\"\n\n\"Then why did you take your hat off when you were introduced to Miss\nMagnolia, Cutler?\" Dr. Lakin asked interestedly.\n\n\"Sir, where I come from, we respect femininity, whether it be animal,\nvegetable or mineral. Nonetheless, we-all got to remember, though Miss\nMagnolia is unquestionably a lady, she is not a woman.\"\n\nPhyllis began to laugh hysterically. \"You're right!\" she gasped. \"I had\nalmost forgotten _she_ was only a tree. And that _it_ is only a little\nChristmas holly plant that's probably going to die, anyway--they almost\nalways do.\"\n\n\"That's cruel, Phyllis,\" James said, \"and you know it is.\"\n\n\"Do you really think I'm cruel? Are you going to tell the Society for\nthe Prevention of Cruelty to Vegetables on me? But why am I cruel? I'm\ngiving her the holly. That's what she wants, isn't it? Do you hear that,\nMiss Magnolia, ma'am? _He_'s all yours. We'll plant _him_ next to\nyou--right away. And I hope _he_ doesn't die. I hope _he_ grows up to\nmake you a good husband.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"She's really quite remarkable,\" Dr. Lakin said to James later that same\nevening, after the planting ceremonies were over and the rest of the\nparty had gone into the cottage for fresh coffee and more sandwiches and\ncookies and penuche. \"Quite remarkable. You're a lucky man, Haut.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" James replied abstractedly. \"I'm sure Phyllis will be\npleased to--\"\n\n\"_Phyllis!_ Oh, Mrs. Haut is a very remarkable woman, of course. A\nhandsome, strong girl; she'll make a splendid mother, I'm sure. But I\nwas referring to Miss Magnolia. She's a credit to you, my boy. If for no\nother reason, your name will go down in the history of our colony as\nthat of the guide and mentor of Miss Magnolia. That's quite a tree you\nhave there.\"\n\nJames looked at the dark form of the tree--for the lights had been\nturned out--silhouetted against the three pale moons and the violet\nnight. \"Yes, she is,\" he said.\n\n\"You're fortunate to be her neighbor ... and her friend.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am.\"\n\n\"Well, I expect I'd better join the rest. Are you coming on in, Jim?\"\n\n\"In a little while, sir. I thought I'd--I wanted to have a word with\nMagnolia. I won't be long.\"\n\n\"Of course, of course. I'm delighted to see that there is such an\nexcellent relationship between you.... Good night, Miss Magnolia!\" he\ncalled.\n\n\"Good night, Dr. Lakin,\" the tree replied, politely enough, but it was\nobvious that she was preoccupied with her new charge, who stood as close\nto her as it was possible to plant him and yet allow room for him to\ngrow.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe door closed. James walked across the lawn until he was quite near\nMagnolia. \"Maggie,\" he whispered, reaching out to touch her\ntrunk--smooth it was, and hard, but he could feel the vibrant life\npulsing inside it. Certainly she was not a plant, not _just_ a plant,\neven though she was a tree. She was a native of Elysium, neither animal\nnor vegetable, unique unto the planet, unique unto herself. \"Maggie.\"\n\n\"Yes, Jim. Don't you think his silhouette is so graceful there in the\nmoonlight? He isn't really puny--just frail.\"\n\n\"Maggie, you're not serious about this holly?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" And still he didn't have her full attention. Would\nhe ever have it again?\n\n\"Serious about raising him to be your--your--\"\n\n\"Why not, Jim?\"\n\n\"It's impossible.\"\n\n\"Is it? It certainly is far more possible with him, isn't it? That much\nI understood from your zoology books.\"\n\n\"I suppose so.\"\n\n\"Besides, I have nothing to lose, have I?\"\n\n\"But even if it were possible, wouldn't it be humiliating for you? The\ncreature's mindless!\"\n\nMagnolia's leaves rustled in the darkness. She was laughing--a little\nbitterly. \"Your Phyllis isn't your intellectual equal, Jim, and yet you\nsay you love her and I suppose you do. Am I not entitled to my follies\nalso?\"\n\nBut she couldn't compare Phyllis to a holly plant! It was unreasonable.\n\n\"He may die, of course,\" Magnolia said. \"I've got to be prepared for\nthat. The soil is different, the air is different, the sun is different.\nBut the chances are, if he survives, he'll turn blue. And if he turns\nblue, who knows what other changes might be brought about? Maybe the\nplants on your Earth aren't inherently mindless, Jim. Maybe they just\ndidn't have a chance. 'Know ye the land where the cypress and myrtle\nare emblems of deeds that are done in their clime...?' That land isn't\nEarth, Jim, so it might just possibly be Elysium.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAgain he didn't say anything. What he wanted to say, he had no right to\nsay, so he kept silent.\n\n\"It'll be a chance for me, too, Jim. At least we're both plants, he and\nI. That gives us a headstart.\"\n\n\"Yes, I suppose it does.\"\n\n\"Intellect doesn't count for much in the propagation of the species.\nLife goes on without regard for reason, and that's mainly what we're\nhere for, to make sure that life goes on--if we're here for anything at\nall. Thanks to your kind, Jim, life will continue on this planet; it\nwill certainly be your kind of life--and I hope it can be ours as well.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"I hope so, too.\"\n\nAnd he did, but he wished it didn't have to continue in quite that way.\nPerhaps it was a trick of the three moons, but the holly plant's leaves\nseemed to have changed color.. They were no longer green, but almost\nblue--powder blue.\n\n\"You'd best be getting on to your party, Jim,\" Magnolia said. \"You\nwouldn't want to be remiss in your duties as host. And please close the\ndoor gently when you go inside. The little holly plant's asleep.\"\n\nAs he closed the door carefully behind him, he heard a burst of laughter\ncoming from the kitchen, where the guests apparently had\nassembled--raucous animal laughter--and, rising shrill and noisy above\nit, Phyllis's company laugh.\n\n\n--EVELYN E.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
