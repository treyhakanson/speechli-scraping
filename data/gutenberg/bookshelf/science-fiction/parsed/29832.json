The entire\n arm tore away from its shoulder....\n\n\nHis fingers moved over the modest packet of bills the invisible\nrockhound had handed to him. He smiled through the eternal night that\nwas his own personal hell. Duggan's Hades.\n\n\"Thanks, Pete,\" he said gratefully. \"Here, have a box of Conmos.\"\n\nHis sensitized fingers found the cigars, handed over a box, and he heard\nthe nervous scuff of the other's shoes.\n\n\"This eight thousand means I can see again--for a while at least. Take\n'em! It's little enough.\"\n\n\"Look, Duggan. I get eight hundred for selling you the ticket on the\nbreakthrough time. Keep the cigars. You need the dough.\"\n\nFeet pounded, thumping into swift inaudibility along the 10th Level's\nyielding walkway. His fingers caressed the crisp notes that his lucky\nguess on the 80th Level's tunnel juncture had won for him, plus the ten\ndollars, that this meager business could ill afford, it had cost to join\nthe rockhounds' pool....\n\nBut now he was free. His own man. He was released from the calculated\neconomies of his wife. Janith knew to within a few dollars what his\nnewsstand on the 10th Level should make. He had never been able to save\nthe necessary thousand dollar deposit, and ten dollars an hour, that a\nrented super mech cost. And she would never listen to his pleas that he\nmust see again--if only for an hour....\n\n\"Waste ten or twenty dollars for nothing,\" she would storm. \"We have all\nyour hospital bills to pay. I need new clothes. Your stock in the stands\nis too small.\"\n\nWhat she left unspoken was the fact that she must secretly have hated\nhis engineering career in the deep levels under Appalachia, and that she\nwas dedicated to preventing his possible return....\n\nAfter three years of blindness, under his wife's firm dominance, Duggan\nfelt only hate for her. With this sudden fortune he could be\nindependent. He could divorce her. He could rent a super mech--even\nreturn to work in the ever-deepening levels of Appalachia City!\n\nFirst of all he must see again.\n\nHe closed up the news-and-cigar stand. With his cane's sensitive radar\nbutton pulsating beneath his fingers he hurried along the walkway toward\nthe nearest super mech showroom. It was less than three blocks....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Be sure that all the contacts are against the skull and neck,\" the\nsalesman was saying, his voice muffled by the mentrol hood covering\nDuggan's head and shoulders.\n\n\"Of course.\" Duggan's impatience made his voice shrill. \"I've used\nmentrols before when inspecting cave-ins and such.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir.\" The man's voice was relieved. Probably he hated his\njob as much as Duggan hated his cigars and news.\n\nDuggan tripped the switches and heard the building hum of power. An odd\nsort of vibration that his mind told him was purely emotional, seemed to\nbe permeating his whole body.\n\nAbruptly the transition was complete. He was no longer lying on the\npadded bench beneath the mentrol hood. He was standing erect, conscious\nof the retaining clamps that held him upright.\n\nHe gulped a deep draught of air into the artificial lungs that did not\nneed oxygen and his mechanical pulse quickened.\n\nHis eyes slitted open, drinking in by degrees the mirrored mentrol booth\nand the pallid, fat, little man sitting beside his hooded body. He\nstepped out of the clamps, his sharpened senses aware of softness, and\nhardness, and scent, and color that human weakness so often blurs.\n\nThis super mech that was linked directly with his brain by twin mentrols\nwas tall, chunky and gray of eye and hair. In a general way it was a\nduplicate of his own body, but there was no facial resemblance.\n\n\"How do you like it, sir?\" The fat smile was empty, almost apologetic.\n\"We have younger, more handsome models....\"\n\n\"Well enough.\" Duggan started donning the clothing that he had removed.\n\"I'll want the mech for five, possibly ten, hours.\"\n\n\"I'll make out the slip for ten hours, sir. We'll refund any balance due\nyou. But after ten hours ...\"\n\n\"I know. You must report the mech missing. But with my body here you\ncan't lose.\"\n\nThe salesman smiled enigmatically. \"We _have_,\" he said.\n\nDuggan shrugged. He was impatient to be outside, feasting his starved\nvision on the stores and parks of the various upper levels. He might\neven take a lift to the Outside. It had been fifteen years ago, while\ntheir youngest son was a baby, that they had taken a weekend motor trip\nto the great scar that had been Manhattan. He remembered the vastness\nand the rawness of the uncontrolled atmosphere. It had been beautiful\nbut also a bit terrifying. It was a ten years delayed honeymoon....\n\nAnd now Merle was in the rocket corps and Janith and he were like\nstrangers.\n\nDuggan zippered shut his gray-checked jacket and left the booth. He\nwalked slowly, savoring every picture of the crowded passenger strips\nbeyond the walkway, and of the fairy spans of moving walkways crossing\nthe travel strips. The soft glow of the level's ceiling, fifty feet\nabove, illuminated the double rows of apartment and store fronts.\n\nIt was good to see again.\n\nEvery twelfth section of the level was a park. The greenery was fresher\nand brighter than he remembered; the tree boles and the branches were\nmarvels of grace and strength. He strolled along the paths, impatient to\nbe moving on, but aching with the emerald beauty around him....\n\nHe took the lifts to the upper levels. He rode the swiftest walkways and\ntravel strips, his eyes drinking in the long-hidden sights. From an\nobservation dome he looked out over the wooded mountain slopes of\nOutside, and saw the telltale ridging of rock and earth that marked the\nscores of hidden vehicular tubes linking Appalachia with its sister\ncities of Ondack and Smoky.\n\nHis five hours stretched into seven, and then, eight. Slowly a\ndetermination to keep these eyes, at whatever cost, was building within\nhim. Always before he had agreed when Janith decided. He had been so\ndependent on her those first terrible weeks. But now, with this money\nfrom the breakthrough pool, he could rent a super mech--live as a man\nshould live!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDuggan left the employment booth on the 20th Level, a badge on his\njacket and a half-grin on his full super mech's lips.\n\nOn the records he was now Al Duggan, a second cousin from Montana. He\nknew that nothing in the world could bring Al further east than Ozarka.\nJust to be safe, however, he decided to drop Al a line to explain.\n\nAs far as his wife was concerned Merle Duggan was gone. Dead and buried.\nShe could get a divorce if she wanted and marry that podgy, pink-skulled\nboss of hers at the advertising agency....\n\n\"Five hundred a month,\" Duggan told himself. \"Two-fifty for the rental,\nfifty for insurance--maybe fifty or so for spare parts--that leaves\nabout a hundred and fifty for me.\"\n\nHe was starting at the bottom as a rock hog, a mucker, a clean-up man in\nthe newly opened 80th Level. And his wages were the minimum union scale.\n\nHe took the lift down to the 79th Level, flashed his new badge at the\nguards, and took the gritty freight lift to the lowest level of the\nsprawling metropolis....\n\n\"You Gaines Short?\" he asked the lanky man bent over the littered desk\nin the rough plastic bubble that served as an office.\n\nSharp black eyes studied him--noted the bright new olive badge, and the\ncreased, obviously new, coveralls.\n\n\"You're the new rock hog?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. Al Duggan.\"\n\n\"Any experience?\"\n\n\"Montana--mining. Had some engineering. Worked in Ozarka on tunnels.\"\n\nThe lank man nodded, expressionless.\n\n\"You'll hog for a while. Later we'll see.... Any relation to the Duggan\nwe lost a couple of years back?\"\n\n\"We're cousins.\"\n\n\"Tough he couldn't see his way clear to try again.\" Short's lips\nthinned. \"He may snap out of it yet.... We could use a few more like\nhim.\"\n\n\"I--I'll talk with him,\" promised Duggan.\n\nHe fought back the words that wanted to pour out. Whether it was a\nstrange sense of loyalty to his wife, or a stubborn sort of pride, he\ncould not bring himself to speak ill of her.\n\n\"A super mech is not so bad, Duggan.\" Short flexed a skinny arm. \"I've\nworn this one since a rock slide crushed my back.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Duggan agreed.\n\nShort scribbled on a form, handed it to Duggan.\n\n\"Take this down to Ted Rusche, he's the short, dark fellow bossing the\nrock hogs. He'll see you're issued your tools.\"\n\nDuggan nodded and turned away.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the super mech hostel, on the 79th Level, Duggan shared a compartment\nof six sleeping and mentrol plates. All of the others were rockhounds,\nand three of them worked in his own clean-up gang. His immediate pusher,\nTed Rusche, was a legless, dark and hairy man, much like his working\nsuper mech. Waide and Myham, the first tall and once-handsome, and the\nlatter, bony and scarred, were both paralytics.\n\nDuggan's share of the attendants' salary amounted to another fifty\ndollars monthly. He was not growing too wealthy!\n\n\"And how do you like it after three weeks, Al?\" Rusche demanded from\nwhere he balanced on the cushioned sleeping plate.\n\nDuggan stretched cramped limbs and turned his sightless face toward\nRusche's voice.\n\n\"Seems good to be working again, Ted,\" he said.\n\n\"This's your last day with us, Al. Orders from Short. He's transferring\nyou. Office work I guess, or maybe he's making you a foreman.\"\n\nRusche's voice was curious.\n\n\"He musta found out something about you, Al. S'funny but you look awful\nfamiliar to me too. And you know more about tunnels than you let on. How\nabout leveling with a guy?\"\n\n\"Not now.\" Duggan was thinking of the other listening men. \"After we've\ncleaned-up and eaten. See you in the park outside the hostel.\"\n\n\"Right.\"\n\nDuggan's thoughts were muddled. Fingerprints probably; at every super\nmech hostel all guests were printed and taped, and possibly through his\nsimilar name. Short must have been suspicious from the first. And if he\nhad come to the hostel to see Duggan's mentrol-hooded face, while Duggan\nworked, his identification must have been sure.\n\nShort knew that he was Merle Duggan, and before too long Janith, and all\nhis friends--if he had any left now--would know he had been in hiding\nhere.\n\nHe hurried to eat and get ready for another period under the mentrol's\nhooded probes.\n\nLess than half an hour later he strode out of the hostel, his super mech\ngleaming and clean and his jacket and shorts newly pressed. He met\nRusche in the park and they headed for the lift to the upper level.\n\nEn route to the 10th Level he explained.\n\n\"I thought you looked like somebody I should know.\" Rusche scrubbed at\nhis pseudo beard's coarseness. \"Accident left you sort of psychoed, huh?\nSo you was scared of the levels? Had to try coming back with a false\nname?\"\n\nDuggan gulped. It made a believable sort of yarn. He hadn't taken time\nto concoct a story.... Why not?\n\n\"Something like that. I guess I was badly shook, Ted.\"\n\n\"So now you go back to being engineer at a thousand or so, and I'm still\na rock hog.\" Rusche shrugged. \"Less headaches anyhow.\"\n\nThey stepped off the lift at the 10th Level and took the high speed\nstrip toward the business section. Duggan had it in his mind to see\nJanith and tell her she had failed--that he was his own man again. She\nwould be at the office. He would tell her off, and leave. And then he'd\nshow Rusche some of the high spots of the low-number levels of\nAppalachia.\n\nThe darkness came about them swiftly. To Duggan it was like a return to\nthe nightmare of sightlessness. Under their feet the racing strip\nfaltered and stalled. They were thrown off their feet and sprawled on\nthe fiber-ribbed squares of the checkerboarded way's surface.\n\n\"What is it?\" demanded Rusche.\n\nHe fought back the panic. This was not true blindness.\n\n\"Criminals. They set off a few dozen 'midnight' bombs and try to rob\nbanks or stores. We get these attacks quite often.\"\n\n\"Last long?\"\n\n\"Emergency ventilation will clear it out in a couple of minutes. And the\nSquads will have them in half an hour. They never get very far.\"\n\nThey sat close together, to wait. From the walkways and stalled strips\nshrieks and frightened cries sounded. The sounds seemed to increase from\nbehind them.\n\n\"This's my first time above the Twentieth Level,\" Rusche confided.\n\"Thirty-five years and I never saw the Outside. I don't think I like it\nup this high.\"\n\n\"It will be over in a little while, Ted. Probably just a group of\nteen-agers looking for thrills.\" He laughed drily. \"They'll end up with\nblanked memories and new faces like those who tried before them.\"\n\n\"Listen,\" muttered Rusche.\n\nIn the lightlessness, and above the wailing of the terrified people\nabout them, they could hear the scuff of running feet. They were coming\ncloser at a swift pace. In a moment the runners would collide with them!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDuggan's years of blindness had given him the ability to judge and gauge\ndistance from sound. At the proper instant he pounced, his hands\nclamping around a body, and a second body crashed into the leader. They\nwent down in a tangle.\n\nHe heard Rusche shouting and fists battering and the tinkle of metal or\ncrystal on metal. He was fighting desperately, his super mech's strength\novertaxed. The unseen man's hands tore at his neck and shoulder, ripping\naway the synthetic flesh and baring the complex framework beneath.\n\nThen his hand caught an arm and he exerted the full strength of his mech\npower, until now carefully subdued. The entire arm tore away from its\nshoulder. And yet the wounded man continued to attack.\n\nIt was only then that he realized this must be a super mech. The\ncriminals must have stolen one or two super mechs and were using them in\nthis robbery.\n\nHe was ruthless, then. He wrenched away the other arm. He battered at\nthe unseen torso. The feet of the desperate mech smashed at his knees\nand thighs, staggering him. Then he bore the armless torso of the mech\nbackward and fell upon it.\n\nThe mech went limp, its mentrols blanked by the distant criminal who\ncontrolled it.\n\nDuggan came to his feet, listening for the sound of battle between\nRusche and his captive. It came from his right, faintly. About ten feet\ndistant, he judged it. And now the emergency vents were clearing the\ndarkness from the travel strips. Twilight faded and vision replaced it.\n\nRusche was sitting astride a prone body, and even as Duggan reached his\nside the struggling criminal's arms and legs went limp. Rusche grunted\nand started to stand.\n\n\"A super mech!\" he said. He rubbed thoughtfully at his disarranged nose\nand cheeks, smoothing them again into their normal contours. \"What about\nyours?\"\n\n\"The same.\"\n\n\"Here's their loot, anyhow,\" Rusche said, holding up a small gray\nplastine bag.\n\n\"Drop it, Ted. We better fade out of here before the Squads arrive, too.\nThey might think we're--\"\n\n\"Not on your life, Al. We should get a reward. Pics on the newswires and\ntapes.\"\n\nDuggan shrugged and smoothed at his own neck and face. Four\nred-uniformed men, their heads hidden by ovoid gas helmets, came hissing\ntoward them along the travel strip. They rode single-wheeled cycles and\ntheir rapid-fire expoders were trained on them.\n\n\"Careful now, Ted. Let me do the talking. They like to use paralysis\nneedles and question later.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"I've lived up here.\"\n\nThe unicycles braked to a halt.\n\n\"Step over here, slow,\" ordered one of the Squadmen.\n\nDuggan obeyed, careful to keep his arms rigid. Of course paralysis\nneedles would cause this mech body no damage, but why make trouble? They\n_had_ more destructive weapons.\n\n\"Ran into us,\" he said mildly. \"We figured something wrong--honest men\nwould be standing where they were. We stopped them.\"\n\nThe four members of the Squad were inspecting the damage.\n\n\"I guess you did,\" one of them said, admiringly. \"You must be super\nmechs too?\"\n\n\"That's right. I'm Duggan, Al--Merle Duggan, and this is my friend, Ted\nRusche. We work on the 80th Level--rockhounds.\"\n\n\"Duggan?\" The man's voice was suddenly strained. \"Maybe you're not so\nclear as you pretend. A woman got in the way by accident, supposedly, of\ntheir getaway from the bank. Her name was Duggan too.\"\n\nDuggan started forward, remembered the ugly expoder muzzles and backed\naway.\n\n\"Was her name Janith?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Radio report didn't say. Contact them, Joe,\" he told one of the other\nfaceless men.\n\n\"Couldn't be you hired these two to kill her and pretend the robbery?\"\nhe inquired.\n\n\"Of course not.\"\n\nOne of the Squad mumbled something. Duggan's interrogator dropped his\nweapon's muzzle.\n\n\"Woman twisted her ankle trying to get out of the way, and fell.\nReceived a cut on her temple and is being taken to the hospital.\nAccidental all right.\"\n\n\"But her name.\"\n\n\"Janith.\"\n\nDuggan felt a strange mingling of anger and of tenderness. The anger was\ndirected toward the criminals.\n\n\"Could I go to her now? Rusche can fill you in on details.\"\n\n\"It's not--oh, all right. Regulations aren't too strict on these levels.\nShe your sister?\"\n\n\"Wife.\" He turned to Rusche.\n\n\"See you at the lift in about an hour,\" he said and headed for the\nadvertising agency where Janith was employed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"We haven't been informed as to her whereabouts yet, Mr. Duggan,\" the\nreceptionist at Duffey's offices said coldly.\n\nDuggan glared down into the carefully pretty face, the solar-lamp tan\nand the knife-smoothed wrinkles.\n\n\"Now see here, Blanche,\" he said, and spluttered impotently.\n\n\"See here yourself, Merle Duggan,\" the woman spat back sharply. \"After\nall! You come running back just because she's hurt. Why didn't you come\nback like this a year ago?\"\n\n\"I was with her a year ago.\"\n\n\"That wasn't you. You didn't have guts enough to rent a super mech and\ngo back to your old job.\" The woman laughed. \"Janith tried to insult and\nneedle you into being a man again. And you just crawled.\"\n\n\"That's a lie,\" Duggan cried. \"I begged her to let me go back. She\nwouldn't listen.\"\n\n\"That's what you say now. You don't want to remember. I know. I was here\nall the time. Many a time Janith has come to the office, crying, and\ntold me how hopeless it seemed.\"\n\n\"You're--you're inventing all this, Blanche,\" he accused.\n\n\"I wish I were. Remember, Merle. Think. Be honest with yourself.\"\nBlanche put her nervous, blue-veined hand on his arm. A detached part of\nhis brain noted how bony and brittle her hand was.\n\n\"She's loved you all these years, Merle.\" The tiny hand dug into his\njacket sleeve. \"To make you well again she risked losing your love--and\nshe lost.\"\n\nBlanche must be all of fifty, perhaps fifty-five, the analytical portion\nof his mind noted. Old-maidish in many ways, despite her five\nex-husbands; yet so sentimental--\n\n\"It's all part of her scheme. Pretend to be the patient, long-suffering\nwife and then secretly forbid me to go back to the deep levels again!\nYou don't know!\"\n\nThe woman's tired eyes sparkled green. Her little fist cracked against\nhis chest. She turned half away from him.\n\n\"But I do know. I sat up with you many nights, while Janith got a few\nhours of rest. You were like a baby, slobbering and whimpering in your\nsleep. The days were worse. You were drunk and shouting and weeping. To\nyou blindness was the end.\"\n\nMerle gulped. He could remember nothing of the sort. Only the accident\nand awakening in the hospital to darkness.... But there was a strange\nblankness, a hiatus in his memories, that ended with his hated job in\nthe cigar stand. He could not recall his first day there or--\n\nCould Blanche be telling the truth?\n\n\"You--spiteful old hag!\" he shouted at her, and rushed out of the\noffices.\n\nHis feet pounded at the yielding softness of the walkway. The hospital\nwas less than two blocks distant--no need to take a travel strip--and he\nneeded the automatic motion of walking to steady his thoughts.\n\nThe forgotten months. Four months, or was it five months, ago, he was in\nthe cigar-and-news stand. That was the day when an old acquaintance from\nthe lower levels sold him the chance on the 80th Level's breakthrough.\n\nThat night he had begged Janith to let him rent a super mech. And she\nhad scoffed at his wastefulness. Yet, now that he remembered it again,\nthere had been a wistful note of hope in her voice.\n\nCould she have been trying to fan his faint desire for sight into\nsomething more powerful and consuming--so he would become again the\nengineering Duggan he had been?\n\nHe had surrendered then, as he did many times afterward. Sullenly, yes,\nbut he had surrendered. Perhaps she knew he was not ready for sight.\nWhen he refused to obey her, when he insisted on hiring a super\nmech--then, perhaps, she would know the cure was complete.\n\nBut that was only theory. He remembered her clearly expressed hatred for\nthe mucking, lower-level life of a rockhound. Always his hatred for her\ngrew as she spoke of his work....\n\nShe had never expressed herself in that way before the accident. She had\ngone with him on many exploratory trips into the caverns that the lower\nlevels of Appalachia cut across. And she had enjoyed the experience--he\nwas sure of that.\n\nRemember! Think back. Back before the cigars and papers. Back to the\ndays and months after the accident. It hurt to think. His temples, here\non the mentrol-hooded sleeping plate, were pounding irregularly....\n\nHuddling in a bed, knees drawn up and head tucked in, trying to gain\nsomehow the safety that an infant once knew. Janith's voice, soft and\nunderstanding, and the acid of panic that set his lips to mumbling\nmeaningless jargon....\n\nWhy had Janith not sent him to the medical centers for mental clearing\nand re-education as was done with all cases of psychoed abnormals? The\nanswer was with him. She loved him as he was, Merle Duggan--not as a new\npersonality in her husband's body.\n\nArtificial amnesia automatically dissolves all marriage partnerships.\nShe had not wanted that. Instead she had three years of hell....\n\nStriking out at emptiness, his fists contacting soft flesh, and the\npained cry, swiftly suppressed, of Janith. His voice, cursing and\nhigh-pitched, as he fought the straps that now were restraining his\nsightless body. The bite of a needle and gradual dissolution of\nfeeling....\n\nMemory was coming reluctantly back to Duggan. This was not the\nself-imagined visionings of an abused helpless man. These memories were\ntrue. He had fought against all mental therapy and turned from those who\nloved him.\n\nNow the hospital entrance was before him. He paused for a moment and\nthen went inside. The automatic hush of the door shutting out the muted\nstreet sounds was all too familiar.\n\n\"Mrs. Janith Duggan,\" he told the crisply white woman at the desk.\n\n\"Room 212, second floor.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe used the steps in preference to the lift. He needed more time to\nthink--would he ever find enough time?\n\nUndoubtedly, now, Janith's love for him was dead. His desertion of her\nmust have finished the dissolution of their marriage. It had been\ncowardly--he should have faced her and declared what he was going to do\nand what she could do.\n\nThese past weeks, working with the rock hogs, had been invaluable. They\nhad restored something of his self-esteem.\n\nThe second floor. Pastel bare walls and soft voices. The odors. 208 and\nopposite, 209. A wheelchair, propelled by a timidly smiling white-haired\nwoman. He nodded automatically.\n\n210. What could he say to her? That he was sorry she was hurt and that\nhe was such a fool? And then back to the super mech hostel and the five\nother cripples who shared the room?\n\n212. The door ajar. A private room. He was glad of that. The headache\nwas more violent now--there was a bitter taste in his mouth as his super\nmech entered the room.\n\nShe was alone, looking tiny and helpless on the high bed. To him, after\nthree years, she was more beautiful than he remembered, even though the\npure whiteness of her once-graying hair startled him.\n\n\"Janith,\" he said uncertainly.\n\nShe turned her head, curiosity in her expression, and then understanding\ncame. There was no mistaking the warmth and welcome that came into her\neyes. She held out her arms.\n\n\"Duggy,\" she commanded, \"come here.\"\n\nAnd he knew then, without ever being told, that his revolt and flight\nhad all been part of the therapy, and Janith had known all the time\nwhere he had been....\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ September 1957.\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
