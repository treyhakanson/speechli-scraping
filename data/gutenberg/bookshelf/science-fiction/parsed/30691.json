There emerged a rat with a man's\n  head and face.\n\n  _It's a poor science that would hide from us the great, deep,\n  sacred infinitude of Nescience, whither we can never penetrate, on\n  which all science swims as mere superficial film._\n\n    --_Carlyle_.\n\n[Illustration: _Sir Basil showed his teeth in his ugly smile. \"A creator\nis never merciful.\"_]\n\n\nThe two _batal\u00f5es_ turned from the open waters of the lower Tapajos\nRiver into the _igarap\u00e9_, the lily-smothered shallows that often mark an\nIndian settlement in the jungles of Brazil. One of the two half-breed\nrubber-gatherers suddenly stopped his _batal\u00f5e_ by thrusting a paddle\nagainst a giant clump of lilies. In a corruption of the Tupi dialect, he\ncalled over to the white man occupying the other frail craft.\n\n\"We dare go no farther, master. The country of the Ungapuks is\nbewitched. It is too dangerous.\"\n\nFearfully he stared over his shoulder toward a spot in the slimy water\nwhere a dim bulk moved, which was only an alligator hunting for his\nbreakfast.\n\nHale Oakham, as long and lanky and level-eyed as Charles Lindbergh, ran\ndespairing fingers through his damp hair and groaned.\n\n\"But how can I find this jungle village without a guide?\"\n\nThe _caboclo_ shrugged. \"The village will find you. It is bewitched,\nmaster. But you will soon see the path through the _matto_.\"\n\n\"Can't you stay by me until time to land? I don't like the looks of\nthese alligators.\"\n\n\"It is better for a white man to face an alligator than for a _caboclo_\nto face an Ungapuk. Once they used to kill and eat us for our strength.\nNow--\" Again his shrug was eloquent.\n\n\"Now?\" Hale prompted impatiently.\n\n\"The white god who put a spell on these one-time cannibals will bewitch\nus and make us wash and rejoice when it is time to die.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe shuddered and spat at a cayman that was lumbering away from his\n_batal\u00f5e._\n\nHale Oakham laughed, a hearty boyish laugh for a rather learned young\nprofessor.\n\n\"Is that all they do to you?\" he asked.\n\n\"No. All who enter this magic _matto_ die soon, rejoicing. Before the\nlast breath comes, it is said their bodies turn into a handful of silver\ndust--poof!--like that.\" He snapped his dirty fingers. \"Then the life\nthat leaves them goes into rocks that walk.\"\n\nHale sighed resignedly. There wasn't any use to argue.\n\n\"Unload your _batal\u00f5e_,\" he ordered testily, \"and get your filthy\ncarcasses away.\"\n\nThe half-breeds obeyed readily. As the departing _batal\u00f5e_ turned from\nthe _igarap\u00e9_ into the open water of the river, the young man repressed\na sudden lifting of his scalp. He was in for it now!\n\nHis long body sprawled out in the _batal\u00f5e_, he paddled about aimlessly\nfor several minutes until he found an aisle through the jungle--the path\nthat led to the jungle village which he was visiting in the name of\nscience, and for a certain award.\n\nBefore plunging into that waiting tangle where life and death carried on\na visible, unceasing struggle, he hesitated. Instinctively he shrank\nfrom losing himself in that mad green world.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe had first heard of the Ungapuks at the convention of the Nescience\nClub in New York, that body of scientists, near-scientists and\nadventurers linked together for the purpose of awarding the yearly\nWoolman prizes for the most spectacular addition of empiric facts to\nvarious branches of science. One of the members of the club, an\nexplorer, had told a wild yarn about a tribe of Brazilian Indians,\nheaded by Sir Basil Addington, an English scientist, who was conducting\nsecret experiments in biochemistry in his jungle laboratory. The\nexplorer had said that the scientist, half-crazed by a powerful\nnarcotic, had seemingly discovered some secret of life which enabled him\nto produce monsters in his laboratory and to change the physical\ncharacteristics of the Ungapuk Indians, who, in five years, had been\ntransformed from cannibals into cultured men and women.\n\nAnd now Hale Oakham, hoping to win one of the Woolman prizes, was here\nin the country of the Ungapuks, entering the jungle path that lead to\nthe unknown.\n\nFifty feet from the _igarap\u00e9_, the path curved sharply away from a giant\ntree. Hale approached the bend with his hand on his gun. Just before he\nreached it, he stopped suddenly to listen.\n\nA woman's voice had suddenly broken forth in a wild, incredibly sweet\nsong. Hale stood entranced, drinking in the heady sounds that stirred\nhis emotions like _masata_, the jungle intoxicant. The singer\napproached the bend in the path, while the young man waited eagerly.\n\nThe first sight of her made him gasp. He had expected to see an Indian\ngirl. No sane traveler would imagine a white woman in the Amazon jungle,\nwith skin as amazingly pale as the great, fleshy victoria regia lilies\nin the _igarap\u00e9_.\n\nWhen she saw Hale, she stopped instantly. With a quick, practiced twist,\nshe reached for the bow flung across her shoulders and fitted a barbed\narrow to the string.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe was a beautiful barbarian, standing quivering before him. In the\nthick dull gold braids hanging over her bare shoulders flamed two\nenormous scarlet flowers, no redder than her own lips pouted in alarm.\nThere was a savage brevity to her clothing, which consisted only of a\nshort skirt of rough native grass and breastplates of beaten gold, held\nin place by strings of colored seeds.\n\nThe girl held out an imperious hand and, in perfect English, said:\n\n\"Go back!\"\n\nHale drew his long body up to its slim height, folded his arms, and gave\nher his most winning smile. His insolence added to his wholesome good\nlooks.\n\n\"Why?\" he exclaimed. \"I've come a couple of thousand miles to call on\nyou.\"\n\nHe saw that the eyes which held his levelly were pure and limpid, and of\nan astonishing orchid-blue.\n\n\"Who are you?\" Her throaty, vibrant voice was a thing of the flesh,\nwhipping Hale's senses to sudden madness.\n\n\"I'm Hale Oakham,\" he said, a little tremulously, \"a lone, would-be\nscientist knocking about the jungle. Won't you tell me your name?\"\n\nShe nodded gravely. \"I am A\u00f1a. I, too, am white.\" Her rich voice was\nquietly proud. \"Come; I'll see if Aimu will receive you.\"\n\nWith surprising, childlike trust, she held out her little hand to him.\nThe gesture was so delightfully natural that Hale, grinning boyishly,\ntook her hand and held it as they walked down the jungle path.\n\n\"Sing for me,\" he demanded abruptly. \"Sing the song you sang just now.\"\n\n\"That?\" asked the girl, turning the virgin-blue fire of her eyes on him.\n\"That was my death-song that I practice each day. Perhaps soon I shall\nbe released from this.\" She passed her hands over her beautiful,\nhalf-clothed body.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHale's warm glance swept over her. \"Do you want to die?\"\n\n\"Yes; don't you? But you do not, or you would not have retreated from my\npoisoned arrow.\"\n\n\"No, A\u00f1a; I want to live.\"\n\n\"To live--and be a slave of _this_?\" Again her hand went over her slim\nbody. \"A slave of a pile of flesh that you must feed and protect from\nthe agonies that attack it on every side? Bah! But I am hoping that my\nturn will come next.\"\n\n\"Your turn for what, A\u00f1a?\"\n\n\"To enter the Room of Release. Perhaps, if Aimu approves of you, you,\ntoo, may taste of death.\" Her gentle smile was beatific.\n\n\"Do you speak of Sir Basil Addington?\"\n\n\"He was called that once, before he came to us. Now he has no name. We\ncan find none holy enough for him; and so we call him Aimu, which means\ngood friend.\" Her beautiful face was sweet with reverence.\n\nAnd now, in the distance, Hale saw that the path led into a large\nclearing. He slowed his pace, for he wanted to know this lovely girl\nbetter before he joined the Ungapuks.\n\n\"Who are you, A\u00f1a?\" he asked suddenly, bending closer to the crinkled,\ndull-gold hair.\n\n\"I am A\u00f1a, a white woman.\" She looked at him frankly.\n\n\"But who are your parents, and how did you get among the Ungapuks?\"\n\nA\u00f1a's red lips curved into a dewy smile. \"I thought all white men were\nwise, like Aimu. But you are stupid. How do you think a white woman\ncould appear in a tribe of Indians who live in the jungle, many weeks'\njourney from what you call civilization?\"\n\nHale looked a little blank and more than a little disconcerted.\n\n\"I suppose I am stupid,\" he said dryly. \"But tell me, A\u00f1a, how did you\nget here?\"\n\n\"Why,\" she exclaimed, \"he made me!\"\n\n\"Made you? Good Lord! What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Just what I said, Hale Oakham. If he can take a few grains of dust and\nmake a shoot that will grow into a giant tree like yonder monster\nitauba, don't you think he can create a small white girl like me?\" Her\norchid-blue eyes glowed innocently into his.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe eager questions that he would have asked froze upon his lips, for a\nparty of Indians approached.\n\nThe six nearly naked red men came close and surveyed him, toying\nnervously with their primitive, feather-decorated weapons.\n\nA tall, handsome young fellow who possessed something of the picturesque\nperfection of the North American plains' Indian stepped forward and, in\nperfect English, said:\n\n\"Good morning, white stranger. What is it you wish of the Ungapuks?\"\n\n\"I came to see your white _cacique_,\" said Hale.\n\n\"Aimu? What is it you wish of Aimu? He is ours, white stranger.\"\n\n\"Yes, he is yours. I come as a friend, perhaps to help him in his great\nwork.\"\n\n\"Perhaps!\" The young Indian folded his bronze, muscular arms over his\nbroad chest and continued his cool survey of Hale. \"White men before you\nhave come: spies and thieves. Some we poisoned with curari. Others Aimu\ntook into the Room of Release.\"\n\nHe turned to A\u00f1a, who was still standing by Hale, and his expression\nsoftened.\n\n\"What shall we do with him, A\u00f1a?\" he asked the question, a fleeting look\nof hunger swept his fine, flashing eyes.\n\nA\u00f1a flushed beautifully, and, moving closer to Hale, with an impulsive,\nalmost childish gesture, slipped her arm through his.\n\n\"Let us take him to our village, Unani Assu!\" she suggested. \"I like\nhim.\"\n\nIt was Hale's turn to flush, which he did like a schoolboy.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUnani Assu's brows drew together in a scowl. The hand holding his\nblow-pipe jerked convulsively.\n\n\"A\u00f1a! Come away!\" he growled. \"You mustn't touch a stranger!\"\n\nA\u00f1a's blue eyes stretched with astonishment. \"But I like to touch him,\nUnani Assu!\"\n\nThe tall Indian, with a half comical gesture of despair, said:\n\n\"Don't misunderstand her, stranger. She is young, very young, ah! And\nshe has known only the reborn men of the Ungapuks.\"\n\nHe stepped firmly over to A\u00f1a, and, taking the girl by the arm, drew her\naway.\n\n\"Run ahead,\" he commanded, \"and tell Aimu that we come.\"\n\nA\u00f1a, her feathered bamboo anklets clicking together, sped away.\n\nUnani Assu bowed courteously to Hale.\n\n\"Come, stranger. If you are an enemy, it is you who must fear.\" He\nmotioned for him to proceed down the jungle path.\n\nThe path ended at a clearing studded with _moloccas_, the Indian grass\nhuts made of plaited straw. Altogether the scene was peaceful and sane\nand far removed from the strange tales that Hale had heard concerning\nthe Ungapuks.\n\nHale was conducted to a long, low stone building, where, in the\ndoorway, stood a tall and emaciated white man.\n\n\"Aimu!\" said the Indians reverently, and bowed themselves.\n\nOver the bare, brown backs, the white man looked at Hale.\n\n\"Sir Basil Addington?\" asked the young man.\n\n\"Yes. You are welcome. Come in.\"\n\nHale entered the building.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was in a book-filled study, furnished with hand-made chairs and a\ndesk. Sir Basil asked him to be seated. He offered the young man long,\nbrown native cigarettes and a very good drink made from yucca.\n\nAfter several minutes of conversation, Sir Basil suddenly changed his\nmanner.\n\n\"And now,\" he shot out, eyeing the young man through narrowed lids,\n\"will you please state the purpose of this visit?\"\n\nHale looked squarely at his questioner. \"Frankly, Sir Basil, I have\ncalled on you because I am so intensely interested in your work among\nthe Ungapuks that I wish to offer my services.\"\n\nHe gave in detail his family history, his education, and his experience\nas a teacher and a scientist.\n\nSir Basil tapped his teeth thoughtfully with a pencil.\n\n\"But why do you think you can be of assistance to me?\"\n\n\"That, of course, is for you to decide.\"\n\nHale thought that the scientist looked like a huge, starved crow in his\nloose-fitting coat. He was so fleshless that, when the light fell\nstrongly on his face as it now did, the bones of his head and hands\nshowed through the skin with horrible clearness.\n\nHale, under Sir Basil's scrutiny, decided instantly that he did not like\nhim.\n\n\"I need a helper,\" the scientist went on, with the air of talking to\nhimself. \"A white assistant who neither loves nor fears me. Unani Assu\nis good enough in his way, but I need a helper who has had technical\ntraining.\" Suddenly he wheeled on Hale and asked sharply, \"How are your\nnerves, young man?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHale started, but managed to answer calmly. \"Excellent. My war record\nisn't half bad, and that was surely backed with good nerves.\"\n\n\"And you say you have no close relatives, no ties of any sort to\ninterfere with work that is dangerous--and something else?\"\n\n\"Not a soul would care if I passed out to-day, Sir Basil.\"\n\n\"Good! And now tell me this: are you one of those scientists whose minds\nare so mechanical, so mathematically made, as it were, that your entire\noutlook on science is based on old, established beliefs, or do you\nbelong to that rare but modern type of trained thinker and dreamer who\nrefuse to permit yesterday's convictions to influence to-day's\nvisions?\"\n\nHale smiled quietly. \"I recently lost my chair in a famous university\nbecause of my so-called unscientific teachings regarding ether-drift.\"\n\nExpressing himself in purely scientific terms, he went into an\nelaboration of his revolutionary theory. When he had finished, Sir Basil\nreached out his clawlike hand to him.\n\n\"Good!\" he approved. \"You have dared to think originally. Now listen to\nmy theory of mind-electrons which has grown into the established fact\nthat I have discovered the secret of life and death.\"\n\nThe long, thin hands reached into a pocket for a box of pills. He\nswallowed one greedily, and immediately his emaciated face seemed\ncharged with new virility.\n\nHe spoke out suddenly. \"Our world, you know, is made up of three powers:\nmatter, energy and what you call life. I might really say that there are\nbut two powers, for matter, in its last analysis, is a form of energy.\nAnd what is life? You can't call it a form of energy, for every\ninorganic atom has energy without having life. Life, Mr. Oakham, is\nmind or consciousness.\"\n\nHe began pacing the floor restlessly. \"Everything that lives has this\nconsciousness, and I say this in defiance of some fixed scientific\nviews. The amoeba in a stagnant pool, a thallophyte on a bit of old\nbread, any of the myriads of trees and plants that you see in the jungle\nall have consciousness as well as you. And why?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe brought his fist down upon the table. \"Because they issue from the\nsame source as you and I, the almighty mind, eternal, indestructible,\nwhich has permitted itself to be enslaved by matter. You are Hale\nOakham. I am Basil Addington, yet we are one and the same. Let me\nillustrate.\"\n\nHe seized a glass and poured it full of _masata_. \"Look! Two portions of\n_masata_. But I pour what is in the glass back into the bottle. The\nmolecules cohere and the two portions become one again. Some day you and\nI--our individual consciousnesses--will flow back to the Whole. That\nsounds mystical, but listen.\n\n\"We scientists hold that the electron explains nearly all the physical\nand chemical phenomena. I go further and say that it explains _all_.\nMatter, electricity, light, heat, magnetism--all can be reduced to the\nultimate unit. So, Mr. Oakham, I am going to make clear to you how life\nitself is electronic.\"\n\nHis long finger touched Hale's arm. \"You, I, yonder mosquito on your\nsleeve, even one of the germs that is causing my malaria, all being\nindividual living things, are the ultimate units of what I shall\npersonify as the Mind. When I say _you_ I do not speak of that mound of\nflesh in which you exist, and which can be reduced to the same familiar\nbasic elements and compounds as make up inorganic structures; I speak of\nyour mind, your consciousness--for that is the real you. Are you\nfollowing me?\"\n\n\"Perfectly, Sir Basil.\" Hale reached for another drink. \"But do you\nmean to say that you and I are no more than a mosquito, a malaria\nprotozoan, or even one of those trees in the jungle?\"\n\nSir Basil's dry skin slipped back into a long smile. \"Startling,\nisn't it? You, I, and all other living organisms are nothing but\nmatter, energy and consciousness. You and I have a larger share of\nconsciousness, because our organic structure permits the mind-electrons\ngreater freedom over the matter than composes our bodies. We are more\nacutely aware of the universe about us, have a greater facility for\nenjoyment and suffering, a more intricate brain and nervous system.\nYet when our bodies die and our consciousness is released, the\nmind-electrons enslaved by our atoms go back to the elemental Whole.\nThis holds good for the protozoan, the tree, the man--for all things\nthat live.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHale was drinking again. \"You mean, Sir Basil, that there is a sort of\nwar waged against what you personify as the Mind by matter; that matter\nis constantly seeking to enslave mind-electrons, so that it may become\nan organism which, for awhile, may enjoy what we call life?\"\n\nSir Basil pushed back his tufted hair and looked happy. \"Yes! And it's\nNature's supreme blunder! In the end, the Mind always conquers and gains\nits release, yet the eternal chain of enslavement goes on and on, and\nwill continue to go on as long as there is a living organism in the\nworld to bind mind to matter.\"\n\nHale was excited now, as much from the fiery intoxicant as from the\nscientist's weird revelation. \"I get you,\" he said, rather inelegantly\nfor a professor. \"You mean that if every living thing in the world\nshould pass out, every man, every plant, every animal, even down to\nmicroscopic infusoria, the Mind would collect all its electrons, and\nthrough some more jealous law of, er, cohesion hold these electrons\ninviolate from matter and energy?\"\n\n\"Right! And again, as in the beginning, the Mind would rule supreme. By\nwhat I have proved, you and I and all other creatures that now have life\nmay, as separate unfleshed electrons, enjoy eternal consciousness as a\npart of the Mind.\" A new passion leaped to his dark eyes. \"When I have\nfinished my mission, no more need we be slaves of the dust, subject to\nall the frightful sufferings of this dunghill of flesh.\"\n\nHe brought his fist down upon his skinny leg with a resounding blow.\n\n\"But you cannot reduce your theory to fact, Sir Basil!\"\n\n\"No?\" Again came that frightful grin to his cadaverous face. \"Can you\nwithstand shock?\"\n\n\"If you mean shock to the eye, let me remind you that I served two years\nin the big fight.\"\n\n\"Then come to my laboratory. Better take another drink.\"\n\nWhile Hale helped himself again from the _masata_ bottle, Sir Basil\nswallowed another pellet.\n\nThen the two went into the adjoining apartment.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSir Basil, his hand over the doorknob, paused.\n\n\"Before we go in,\" he said, \"I want you to remember that we call natural\nthat which is characteristic of the physical world. Everything alive in\nthis laboratory was produced by nature. I merely made available the\nmaterials, or, rather, I made the conditions under which matter was able\nto enslave mind-electrons.\"\n\nHe opened the door, slipped his body through, and, with his ugly,\nteeth-revealing grin, gestured for Hale to follow him.\n\nHale steeled himself and looked around half fearfully. The first glance\ntook in a large and well-equipped laboratory, somewhat fetid with animal\nodors. The second lingered here and there on cages, aquariums,\nincubators, and other containers where creatures moved.\n\nSuddenly, as something scuttled across the floor and disappeared into a\nhole in the wall, Hale cried out and covered his eyes with a hand.\n\nSir Basil laughed aloud. \"Why didn't you examine it closer?\"\n\nHale looked nauseated. \"My God, Sir Basil! A rat with a man's head and\nface!\"\n\nSir Basil's voice was sharp, decisive. \"Before you leave this\nlaboratory, you're going to come out of your foolish belief that man is\na creature apart from other living organisms. You--the conscious you--is\nno greater, no more important in the final balance than the spark of\nconsciousness in that rat. When your body and the rat's body give up\ntheir atoms to nature's laboratory, the little enslaved mind-electron\nthat is you and the one that is the rat will be identical.\"\n\nAgain Hale shivered and turned away from that cold, too-thin face.\n\nThe scientist was speaking. \"Step around to all those cages and pens. I\nwant you to see all my slaves of the dust.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut long before Hale had encircled the room, he was so disturbed at what\nhe saw that he could scarcely complete his frightful inspection. In\nevery enclosure he viewed a monstrosity that in some way resembled a\nhuman. Every reptile, every insect, every queer, misshapen animal not\nonly looked human in some shocking manner, but also seemed to possess\nhuman characteristics. It seemed as though some demented creator with a\nperverted sense of humor had attempted to mock man by calling forth\nmonsters in his image.\n\nAt last the young man cried out: \"How did you breed these freaks?\"\n\n\"They are not freaks, and I did not breed them. They are nature's\nparentless products whose basic elements were brought together in\nthis laboratory, and, by a scientific reproduction of the functions\nof creation, endowed with the life principle, which is merely\nmind-electrons.\" He smoothed his long tuft of hair nervously. \"Would\nyou like to see how life springs from a wedding of matter, energy,\nand consciousness?\"\n\n\"I suspect I can stand anything now,\" Hale admitted.\n\n\"Then come and peep into a very remarkable group of apparatus I have\ndeveloped, where you can watch atoms building molecules and molecules\nbuilding living organisms.\"\n\n\"You say I can see atoms?\"\n\n\"Not directly, of course. The light waves will forever prevent us from\nactually seeing the atom. But I have perfected a system of photography\nwhich magnifies particles smaller than light waves, and, separating\ntheir images from the light waves, renders detail clear in the moving\npictures.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe went to a huge machine or series of machines which took up all the\ncenter floor space of the laboratory, where he busied himself in an\nintricate network of wires, mirrors, electrodes, ray projectors, and\ntraveling metal compartments. Presently he called out to Hale.\n\n\"Let me remind you, Oakham, that while any scientist can break up any of\nthe various proteid molecules which are the basis of all living cells,\nanimal and vegetable, no scientist before me has been able to compound\nthe atoms and build them into a proteid molecule.\"\n\nHe bared his teeth in the smile that Hale hated.\n\n\"I am proud to tell you that the proteid molecule can be built up only\nwhen the third element of nature's trinity is added--the mind-electron.\nI have found a means of capturing the mind-electron and of bringing it\nin contact with proteid elements. And now it is possible to bring forth\nlife in the laboratory. Come closer and watch proteid forming\nprotoplasm, protoplasm forming a cell, and the cell evolving into--well,\nwhat do you want, an animal, plant, or an insect?\"\n\nHale had fallen under the scientist's spell. He did not feel foolish\nwhen he said:\n\n\"Let's have a rat!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHale became so absorbed in the wonders of the laboratory that when lunch\ntime came, Sir Basil had food brought to them. While they were eating a\nvery good vegetable stew, farina, and luscious tropical fruits, a\nsudden, agonized scream rang out, followed by other screams and wails.\n\nSir Basil opened the door and looked out. A\u00f1a came running forward. Her\nblue eyes were flooded with tears.\n\n\"Oh, Aimu!\" she moaned. \"A tree fell on Unani Assu.\"\n\nShe buried her beautiful face in her hands and sobbed aloud.\n\nSir Basil frowned heavily.\n\n\"I can't lose Unani Assu yet,\" he declared. \"He is a wonderful help\naround the laboratory. Is he dead?\"\n\n\"No. We should rejoice if his time of release had come. But his legs,\nAimu! No one wants to suffer and be crippled.\"\n\nEven in her distress, the girl's voice was rich and vibrant, and every\ntone moved Hale curiously.\n\n\"Hurry!\" cried the scientist. \"Have them bring him here before he\ndies.\"\n\nThe girl leaped to her feet and sped away.\n\n\"Come, Oakham,\" continued Sir Basil. \"Here is a rare opportunity for you\nto see how completely I have mastered the laws that govern organic\nmatter. Help me prepare.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor several minutes, Hale worked under the scientist's sharply spoken\ndirections. By the time the injured man was brought to the laboratory,\nSir Basil was ready for him.\n\nUnani Assu was still conscious, but his pale face indicated that he had\nlost much blood. When the improvised stretcher was lowered to the floor,\nSir Basil sent all the Indians away.\n\nUnani Assu opened his eyes and called feebly, \"A\u00f1a!\"\n\n\"Be still!\" ordered Sir Basil. \"A\u00f1a is not here.\"\n\n\"Please!\" gasped the dying man. \"I want her--my A\u00f1a!\"\n\nSir Basil sucked in his breath sharply. \"What's this? Have you been\nmaking love to A\u00f1a again, after my warning to you?\"\n\nThe sufferer stirred uneasily. \"No!\" he panted. \"But perhaps my hour of\nrelease has come, and I want to look at her--once more.\"\n\nThe scientist smiled unpleasantly as he eyed the magnificent body which\nlooked like a broken statue in bronze.\n\n\"Some human characteristics are strange,\" he muttered. \"In spite of\neverything I do, this fellow continues to love A\u00f1a: A\u00f1a whom I intend\nfor myself.\"\n\nHe stepped to the apparatus and swiftly changed one of the adjustments.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" he resumed, with a gleam in his eyes that chilled Hale, \"this\nwill forever cure him.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn another moment, the still, half-dead body was lifted and gently\nslipped into a compartment.\n\nBefore Hale's horrified gaze fastened on the eye-piece which revealed\nmoving pictures of every process that went on within, Unani Assu's body\nwas reduced almost instantly to a fine, silvery dust.\n\n\"Good God!\" he cried. \"You have killed him.\"\n\nThe scientist's teeth showed in his wide smile. \"Think so? Does a woman\ndestroy a dress when she rips it up to make it over?\"\n\n\"Do you mean me to understand that you can reduce a living body to its\nbasic elements and then rebuild these elements into a remade man?\"\n\n\"Watch!\" warned the scientist.\n\nHale looked again and saw the silver dust that was once a living body\nbeing whirled into a tiny, grublike thing. He saw the grub expand into\nan embryo, and the embryo develop into a foetus. From now on the\ndevelopment was slower, and he often stopped to talk with Sir Basil.\n\nOnce he asked: \"If this man had died naturally, could you have brought\nhim back to life?\"\n\nSir Basil shook his head. \"No. When once the mind-electron is completely\nfreed from its enslavement by matter, it is forever beyond recall by the\nbody it has just vacated. Like atomic electrons, whose equilibrium\ndisturbed break away from their planetary system and go dashing off into\nspace, only to be drawn into another planetary system, the mind-electron\nmay be enslaved almost immediately by extraneous matter. Had Unani Assu\ndied, his liberated mind-electron might at once have been captured by a\njungle flower going to seed. Immediately a new seed would be started.\nAnd now the former Unani Assu would be a seed of a jungle flower, later\nto find new life as a plant.\"\n\nSuddenly the scientist threw up his hand and cried: \"You see? The Mind\nwill be eternally enslaved as long as there is life! Oh, for the time of\ndeliverance!\" He gazed fanatically into space, as though he dreamed\nmagnificently.\n\nHale observed him thoughtfully. When that great brain weakened, the\nconsequences would be frightful.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSir Basil, as though he had made a sudden decision, went over to that\npart of his machine which he called the molecule-disintegrator.\n\n\"Oakham!\" he called out. \"I have taken you partly into my confidence.\nNow I want to show you something. Come here.\"\n\nHale obeyed with misgivings. The scientist pointed out the window to a\ngroup of Indians, anxious relatives of Unani Assu.\n\n\"Watch!\" he ordered.\n\nTurning one of the projectors on the machine toward the window, he\nsighted carefully and pressed a button.\n\nImmediately one of the Indians fell to the ground and struggled. His\ncompanions began dancing around him in evident joy. Faintly to the\nlaboratory came a familiar chant, which Hale recognized as A\u00f1a's death\nsong.\n\n    Dust to dust\n    Mind to Mind--\n    He will shed his body\n    As the green snake sheds his skin.\n\nAs Hale watched, the struggling Indian's body seemed to shrink, and\nthen, instantly, it disappeared.\n\n\"Watch them scatter the dust!\" said the scientist.\n\nOne of the Indians stooped and blew upon the grass.\n\n\"What have you done!\" Hale gasped. \"You've killed this one. Oh, I see\nnow! These poor devils are totally ignorant that you are killing them\nfor practice. They worship you while you turn them to--silver dust!\" He\nturned angrily on the scientist as though he longed to strike him.\n\n\"Keep cool, young man!\" Sir Basil held up his fleshless hand. \"There is\nno death! Change, yes; but no permanent blotting out of consciousness.\nCan't you see the horror of it as nature works? When your time for\nrelease comes, as it inevitably will, your mind-electron might find new\nenslavement in a worm!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHale's reply came hotly. \"If that is true, why do you murder these poor\ndevils deliberately!\"\n\n\"My dear Oakham, perhaps you are not so brilliant as I had hoped! All\nthat I have done thus far is only child's play, in preparation for my\nreal work. Haven't you guessed by now what I am getting ready to do?\"\n\n\"No; I'm a poor guesser.\"\n\nThe scientist made a gesture of mock despair. \"Then let me tell you. The\nmolecule-disintegrator is active only on organic structures. When I\nconcentrate it so\"--he reached out again, sighted the projector on some\npoint beyond the window and pressed a button--\"one single living\norganism passes out. See that jupati tree by the rock disappear?\"\n\nBefore Hale's eyes, the tall, slender tree melted into air.\n\n\"But,\" continued Sir Basil, \"if I should _broadcast_ my\nmolecule-disintegrator on electron magnetic waves, destruction would\npass out in all directions, following the curve of the earth's surface,\npenetrating earth, air, water.\" He wet his lips carefully. \"You\nunderstand?\"\n\nHale stiffened suddenly. \"I understand. No life could survive these\nvibrations of destruction? Through every corner of the earth where life\nlurks, they would reach?\"\n\n\"Yes!\" cried Sir Basil. \"There would be not a blade of grass, not a\nliving spore, not a hidden egg! Think of it, Oakham! No more would the\nclean air and the sweet earth reek with life, and at last the ultimate\nmind-electron would be released forever.\"\n\nHe was breathing fast, and his emaciated face burned with two red\nspots.\n\nHale thought rapidly. He was convinced now that the fate of all life lay\nwithin that diabolical network of chemical apparatus.\n\nAt last he said: \"And what of you and I, Sir Basil? Shall we, too, be\ncaught in this wholesale destruction?\"\n\n\"Not immediately,\" replied the scientist. \"Of course, I want to\nremain in the flesh long enough to be sure that my purpose has been\naccomplished. I have provided a way for my own safety. If you desire,\nyou may remain with me.\" He smiled craftily. \"I have planned to keep\nA\u00f1a also, the woman whom I called into life and made as I wished.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis words pounded against Hale's tortured ears with almost physical\nforce. With a supreme effort, the young man controlled his rage and\ndespair. A\u00f1a needed him too much now for him to risk defeat by showing\nhis emotions.\n\nTo Sir Basil he said: \"But if all life disappears from the earth, what\nshall we do for food--you, A\u00f1a, and I?\"\n\nSir Basil lifted his brows. \"You don't think I overlooked that, do you?\nWhat is food? Various combinations of the basic elements. I who have\nconquered the atom need never worry about starving to death.\"\n\nAll this time, the machinery had been humming, and now the humming\nchanged its note to a shrill whistle. Sir Basil went to the eye-piece\nand looked into it. Opening a door in the machinery, he disappeared\ninside. He came out soon, flushed and evidently elated.\n\n\"Bring the stretcher, Oakham,\" he ordered.\n\nHale brought the stretcher, placing it close to the machine. Then Sir\nBasil opened a metal door and gently eased out a human body.\n\nIt was Unani Assu, unconscious but alive and breathing. Hale, helping\nthe scientist to get the man on the stretcher, noticed that the crushed\nlegs were perfectly healed. Together they bore him to a long seat. The\nIndian's eyes were still closed, but his even breathing indicated that\nhe was only sleeping.\n\nSuddenly Hale pointed a finger and cried out. \"My God, Sir Basil, look\nat his hands and feet!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUnani Assu, still lying like a recumbent bronze statue sculptured by a\nmaster, was perfect from shoulder to wrist, from thigh to ankle. But,\nsomewhere in that diabolical machine through which he had passed, his\nhands and feet had undergone a hideous metamorphism which had\ntransformed them from the well-formed extremities of a splendid young\nIndian into the hairy paws of a giant rat!\n\nHale turned away his head, sick with disgust.\n\nSir Basil cut the silence triumphantly:\n\n\"Now he'll never again face A\u00f1a with love in his eyes!\"\n\n\"What!\" broke in Hale. \"Did you plan this monstrous thing?\"\n\n\"Of course! I told you I should forever cure him of his mad\ninfatuation.\"\n\n\"But why didn't you kill him, as you killed the others? It would have\nbeen the most merciful way.\"\n\nSir Basil showed his teeth in his ugly smile. \"A creator is never\nmerciful.\"\n\nA quiver passed through the Indian's body and presently, he sighed\ndeeply and opened his eyes. He seemed dazed, puzzled. He looked from\nHale to the scientist, and turned seeking eyes to other parts of the\nlaboratory.\n\n\"A\u00f1a!\" he called weakly. \"Where is A\u00f1a?\"\n\nHe pulled himself a little unsteadily to his feet--to the spatulated,\nhairy _rodent_ feet that had come out of the life-machine. Staggering,\nhe would have fallen, had he not thrown out his arm to steady himself.\nInstinctively he tried to grasp something for support, and then, for the\nfirst time, he discovered his deformity.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHale was never to forget that expression of horror and disgust that\nswept over the Indian's face as he spread open his revolting extremities\nand stared at them.\n\nA sudden, wild roar of despair rang through the room. \"Aimu! My hands!\"\n\nThe scientist smiled with evident amusement. \"You are a grotesque sight,\nUnani Assu. Do you want to see A\u00f1a now?\"\n\nThe fright and horror faded from the Indian's face, for now he glared\nwith hate into the mad, mocking eyes.\n\n\"You did it!\" the Indian ground out. \"You've made me into a thing from\nwhich A\u00f1a will run screaming.\"\n\nThrough the quiet rage of the perfectly spoken English ran a thread of\nsorrow. \"Aimu, whom we considered too holy to name!\"\n\nChoking, he hobbled away to the door, which he unbolted. As he passed\nout into the open, Sir Basil went over to the machine and began sighting\nthe projector which cast forth the ray of destruction.\n\n\"No!\" cried Hale. \"You've done enough murder for to-day.\"\n\nThe scientist paused. \"I was trying to be merciful. And then, I wonder\nif it is safe to let him go, hating me? Oh, well!\" He shrugged his\nnarrow shoulders. \"I seldom leave the laboratory, and certainly nothing\ncan harm me here.\" He touched the death-projector significantly.\n\nHale made a mental decision. \"I must find out how the damned thing works\nand put it out of commission.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith this determination uppermost in his mind, he assumed a more intense\ninterest in the strange laboratory. For the next two days, he assisted\nSir Basil so assiduously that he learned much about the operation of the\nlife-machine. And gradually he stopped being horrified as the\nfascination of producing life in the laboratory grew upon him.\n\nAfter he had assisted the scientist in building living organisms from\nbasic elements, he ceased to cringe when he remembered that perhaps it\nwas true that A\u00f1a was created in the mysterious life-machine.\n\nOnce the scientist declared, \"She is untainted with inheritance. She is\nthe perfect mate that I called into life so that before I pass from the\nflesh I may taste that one human emotion I've never experienced--love.\"\n\nThat very night Hale kept a secret tryst with A\u00f1a after the village\nslept. Sweet, virginal A\u00f1a, who knew less of the world than a civilized\nchild of twelve--what a sensation she would create in New York with her\nbeauty, her culture, her natural fascination! With her in his arms and\nan orange tropical moon hanging low in the hot, black sky, he ceased to\ncare that she had no ancestors, for now his one passionate desire was to\nsave her from Sir Basil and to hold her forever for himself.\n\nHe might have been content to go on like this for months, tampering with\ncreation in the day time, courting A\u00f1a in secret at night, had not Unani\nAssu come back for revenge.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the fourth night after Unani Assu had disappeared into the jungle,\nHale went to the _igarap\u00e9_ to meet A\u00f1a. He had gone only half the\ndistance when he encountered her, running frantically up the path toward\nhim.\n\n\"Hale!\" she gasped, falling into his opened arms, where she lay panting\nand exhausted.\n\nHale gently patted the long braids, shimmering in silver tangles under\nthe moonlight, and, crushing the soft little trembling body close, he\nmurmured:\n\n\"What's the matter, darling?\"\n\nShe dug her face deeper into the bend of his arm. \"Oh, Hale! I saw Unani\nAssu a few minutes ago.\" For several moments she was unable to go on,\nfor sudden sobs cut off her breath. \"It's terrible, Hale, what Aimu did\nto his hands and feet, but what Unani's going to do to Aimu is still\nmore terrible.\"\n\nHale placed his hand gently under her chin and tilted up her small,\npale, tear-drenched face.\n\n\"Be calm, A\u00f1a, and tell me plainly.\"\n\nStill clinging to him, she went on. \"He told me that Aimu is a devil,\nHale. He showed me his hands and asked me if I could ever get used to\nthem and be--his squaw.\" The round gold breastplates and the necklace of\npainted seeds clinked together over her panting bosom. \"I told him about\nyou, Hale. And then he seemed to go mad. He said he'd kill Aimu\nto-night.\"\n\n\"But, A\u00f1a! Why did he let you go, knowing that you would give the\nalarm?\"\n\n\"He didn't let me go.\" Her petaled lips parted in a faint smile. \"I\nescaped. Unani Assu tied me to a tree by the _igarap\u00e9_. Because he\ndoesn't ... hate me, he could not bear to tie me too tightly.\"\n\n\"Then he must be close to the laboratory now. If he breaks in upon\nAimu--oh, my God!\"\n\nHale remembered the death-projector. If Sir Basil were in danger of\nattack, he would not hesitate to touch the waiting button that would\nbroadcast death throughout the world.\n\nHe seized A\u00f1a's little hand and cried out: \"Run, A\u00f1a! The only safe\nplace now is Aimu's laboratory. Run!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs they dashed on madly, Hale opened wide his nostrils to scent the\nheavy, flower-laden air of the jungle. Any moment all this sweet, rich\nlife might vanish instantly. He had a horrible vision of a world devoid\nof life, a world of bare rocks, dry sand, odorless, dead waters. For it\nwas life that greened the landscape, roughened the stones with moss and\nlichen, thickened the ocean with ooze, and turned the dry sand into\nloam--life that swarmed underfoot, overhead, all around!\n\nAnd now, just as they reached the laboratory door, panting and frantic,\na hoarse shriek broke forth. Dragging A\u00f1a after him, Hale dashed\nforward, conscious of two masculine voices raised in passion.\n\nThe door to the room where the life-machine performed its vile work was\nlocked. Hale pounded against it and called out to Sir Basil, but only\ncurses and the sound of tumbling bodies came from beyond the door.\nAlthough originally the door had been thick and strong, the destructive\nforces of the tropics had pitted and rotted the wood. A few blows of\nHale's shoulder broke it down.\n\nUnder the brilliant electric light, Sir Basil and Unani Assu were\nfighting upon the blood-spattered floor. The struggle was uneven: the\nscientist's emaciated body was no match for the splendid strength of the\nyoung Indian.\n\n\"Help Aimu!\" cried A\u00f1a, pushing Hale forward.\n\nAimu was being choked to death.\n\nHale acted fantastically but efficiently. Catching up a bottle of\nammonia, he moistened a handkerchief and clapped it against Unani Assu's\nnose. Instantly the Indian choked, released Sir Basil, and fell back,\ngasping for breath.\n\nHale thrust the handkerchief into his pocket.\n\n\"Get out!\" he ordered Unani Assu. \"Quick!\" He threatened him with the\nammonia bottle.\n\nBut Unani Assu was not looking at the bottle. \"Aimu!\" he screamed,\npointing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen Hale saw and understood, he leaped across the room to plant his\nbody in front of A\u00f1a; for Sir Basil was behind the life-machine,\nreaching for the controls of the ray projector.\n\nSuddenly, from behind Hale, a silver streak shot across the room. Sir\nBasil groaned and sank to the floor of the laboratory.\n\nA keen-bladed dissecting knife, thrown by A\u00f1a, stuck out from his left\nbreast.\n\nA\u00f1a ran forward, sobbing wildly. \"Oh, Aimu! I'm sorry! I didn't mean for\nit to strike you there. Only your hand, Aimu! I didn't want Hale to die,\nAimu. I didn't--oh!\"\n\nShe was on her knees by the scientist's side, his head held in her\nslender arms.\n\n\"He's breathing!\" she rejoiced. \"Some _masata_, Hale, quick!\"\n\nHale found a bottle of good brandy which he had contributed from his own\nsupplies. Soon Sir Basil gasped and opened his eyes. He stared about him\nwildly, then gasped:\n\n\"I'm dying, Hale Oakham! Quick, the life-machine, before my mind-electron\nescapes.\"\n\nHe tried to pull his body up, but fell back, weak and panting.\n\nHale hesitated, looking doubtfully at A\u00f1a.\n\n\"For God's sake, quick!\" screamed Sir Basil. \"I'm dying, I say! I must\nhave--rebirth. Lift me to the disintegrator. Hurry!...\" His voice\ntrailed off faintly.\n\n\"He is dying,\" snapped Hale. \"We might as well try it.\" He jerked open\nthe door to the disintegrator. \"Here, Unani Assu! Lend a hand!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nInstantly the Indian came forward, a peculiar, pleased expression on his\nhandsome face. In a moment, Sir Basil's body was inside, and the machine\nbegan its weird humming, the humming that indicated the transformation\nof a human body into dust.\n\n\"Now!\" cried Unani Assu exultingly, going behind the machine. \"I have\nhelped him enough to understand that if one changes this--and this--and\nthis\"--he made some rapid adjustments on the machine--\"something that is\nnot pleasant will happen.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" cried Hale. \"What did you change?\"\n\nThe Indian laughed mockingly. \"Wouldn't you like to know? But, yet, you\nshould not worry. You have no cause to love him, have you?\"\n\n\"I can't be a traitor, Unani Assu! Arrange the machine as it was\noriginally, and I give you my word of honor than when Sir Basil comes\nout, I'll wreck the damned thing beyond repair. See, Unani Assu? You and\nI together will smash it.\"\n\nThe Indian folded his arms so that the repulsive things that should have\nbeen hands were hidden.\n\n\"It's too late now,\" he admitted, shaking his head. \"Yet I've done no\nmore to him than he did to me.\"\n\nHale went to the eye-piece in the machine and started to look inside.\nUnani Assu stepped forward, tapped him on the shoulder, and, fingering\nsignificantly the dissecting knife which he had picked up, said:\n\n\"I am operating the machine. Will you sit over there by A\u00f1a and wait? It\nwon't be long. And, white stranger, remember this: I am your friend. I\nam turned against none but our common enemy.\" He pointed significantly\nto the machine.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTwo hours passed, long, silent hours for the watchers in the laboratory.\nA\u00f1a fell asleep, in a sweet, childish bundle upon the piled cushions,\nher golden hair, still decorated with the red flowers which she always\nwore, crushed and withered now. Several times Hale caught Unani Assu\ngazing at her sadly, and his own look saddened when it rested on the\nIndian's strong, outraged body.\n\nThe humming of the machine changed to a whistle. Placing his fingers on\nhis lips in a signal of quiet, Unani Assu whispered:\n\n\"Let A\u00f1a sleep. She mustn't see this.\"\n\nOpening a door in the machine, his handsome face lighted with a grim\nsmile, he whispered exultingly:\n\n\"Watch!\"\n\nA scuttling sound issued forth and then, half drunkenly, an enormous rat\ntumbled out--one of those horrible rats with the hairless, humanlike\nfaces that had so frequently come from the life-machine.\n\nHale could not crush back the cry that issued from his throat.\n\n\"Where is Sir Basil?\" he gasped.\n\n\"There!\" cried the Indian, pointing to the kicking rat, which was fast\ngaining strength.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHale staggered back. \"No! You don't mean it, do you?\"\n\nUnani Assu turned the rat over with a contemptuous toe. \"Yes, I mean it.\nBehold Aimu, the man who thought himself creator and destroyer--the man\nwho said that a human being was no higher than a rat! Perhaps he was\nright, for see this thing that was once a man!\"\n\nHale buried his face in his hands. \"Kill it, Unani Assu! Kill it!\"\n\nUnani Assu's low laugh was metallic. \"You kill it.\"\n\nHale uncovered his face. \"Open the disintegrator.\" Gingerly he reached\nfor the rat's tail.\n\nBut his hand never touched the animal. The hairless face turned for a\nsecond, and the little, beady eyes blinked up at Hale with an expression\nthat his fevered imagination thought almost human. Then, like a dark\nshadow, the rat dashed away. Once around the room it scampered, hunting\nfor an exit. Hale started in pursuit. He was almost upon the animal\nagain, when, leaping up from his grasp, it landed on a low shelf where\nchemicals were stored. Several bottles fell, filling the room with\nfumes.\n\nAnother bottle fell, and, suddenly, amid a thunderous roar, the ceiling\nand walls began falling. Some highly explosive chemical had been stored\nin one of the bottles.\n\nHale was thrown violently against the couch. His hand touched A\u00f1a's\nbody. One last shred of consciousness enabled him to pick her up and\ndrag her out. In the open, he fell, aware, before blackness descended,\nthat flames leaped high over the laboratory building and that Unani Assu\nlay dead within.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHale and A\u00f1a, leaning over the deck-rail of a small steam launch, gazed\ninto the dark waters of the Amazon.\n\n\"We ought to reach Para by morning,\" said Hale, \"and then, dearest,\nwe're off for New York!\"\n\nA\u00f1a, wearing one of the first civilized dresses she had ever donned, and\nlooking as smart as any d\u00e9butante, slipped her little hand into her\nhusband's.\n\n\"Isn't it a shame, Hale,\" she moaned, \"that the fire burned all the\nanimals and insects, the machinery, and even your notes?\" Her beautiful\nface saddened. \"Just one or two specimens might have been proof enough\nfor your What-You-Call-It Club!\"\n\n\"The Nescience Club, darling. No, I can't expect to win the Woolman\nprize, but I've won a prize worth far more.\" He squeezed her little hand\nand looked devotedly into her blue eyes. \"And, A\u00f1a, I've reasoned out\nsomething concerning mind-electrons which even Sir Basil overlooked.\"\n\n\"What is it, Hale?\"\n\n\"He maintained that matter seeks always to enslave mind-electrons, but I\nam convinced that mind-electrons seek to enslave matter. Understand?\nIt's creation, A\u00f1a! Had Sir Basil succeeded in broadcasting death\nthroughout the world, the freed mind-electrons, as in the beginning,\nwould have started again to vitalize inorganic atoms. And, in a few\nmillion years, which is no time to the Mind, the world would be humming\nwith a new civilization. Large thought, eh, sweetheart?\"\n\n\n\n\nA SIGNAL TO THE MOON\n\nThe idea of a radio signal to the moon may sound fantastic, but is\neasily within the range of possibility, says Dr. A. Hoyt Taylor, Chief\nof the Radio Division of the United States Naval Research Laboratories\nat Washington, who plans such an attempt in the near future.\n\n\"We have reason to expect a good chance of getting the signal back in a\ntime interval of slightly less than three seconds,\" said Dr. Taylor.\n\nTo be exact, a radio signal should be reflected back to earth in a time\ninterval of 2.8 seconds, this being the necessary elapsed time for it to\ncarry the 250,000 miles to the moon and return at its speed of 300,000\nkilometers, or 186,000 miles per second.\n\nThe signal would be very weak, Dr. Taylor points out, but not impossible\nof detection with the present refinement of receiving instruments,\nprovided no great absorption took place in interstellar space.\n\nA high frequency wave will be used, as such a wave penetrates readily\nthe earth's atmosphere and probably goes far beyond. The frequency of\nthe wave will range between 20,000 and 30,000 kilocycles. Twenty\nkilowats of power will be used, enough to furnish current for about\nforty flatirons.\n\nThe value of a radio signal to the moon lies in the confirmation of\nwhether there is or not heavy absorption of waves in the upper levels of\nour own atmosphere. If successful it would indicate a reasonably good\nreflection coefficient at the surface of the moon--the power of the\nmoon's surface to act as a joint agent in the perfection of the signal.\n\nThe signal might have some bearing also on whether the moon has an\natmosphere--something pretty much settled already by astronomical\nobservation. It would also lead to the possibility of fairly accurate\ndetermination of wave velocity in free space, all of interest to\nscience, either confirming existing theories or establishing new ones.\n\n\n\n\nThe Pirate Planet\n\nPART TWO OF A FOUR-PART NOVEL\n\n_By Charles W. Diffin_\n\n  It is war. Interplanetary war. And on far distant Venus two\n  fighting Earthlings stand up against a whole planet run amuck.\n\n\nWHAT HAS GONE BEFORE\n\nA flash of light on Venus!--and at Maricopa Flying Field Lieutenant\nMcGuire and Captain Blake laugh at its possible meaning until the\nradio's weird call and the sight of a giant ship in the night sky prove\ntheir wildest thoughts are facts. \"Big as an ocean liner,\" it hangs in\nmidair, then turns and shoots upward at incredible speed until it\ndisappears entirely, in space!\n\nMcGuire goes to Mount Lawson observatory, and there he sees the flash on\nVenus repeated. Professor Sykes, who had observed the first flash,\nconfirms it and sees still more. He sees the enveloping clouds of Venus\ntorn asunder, and beneath them an identifying mark, a continent shaped\nlike the letter \"L.\"\n\nAnd then the great ship comes again. It hovers above the observatory and\nsettles slowly down.\n\n[Illustration: \"Hold them off as long as you can!\"]\n\nBack at Maricopa Field, Captain Blake has tested a new plane for\naltitude, and is now prepared to interview the stranger in the higher\nlevels. McGuire's frantic phone call sends him out into the night with\nthe 91st Squadron of planes in support. It is their last flight, for all\nbut Blake. The invader smothers them in a great sphere of gas, but\nBlake, with his oxygen flasks, flies through to crash beside the\nobservatory. Only Blake survives to see the enemy land, while strange\nman-shapes loot the buildings and carry off McGuire and Sykes.\n\nA bombardment with giant shells dispels the last doubt of the earth\nbeing under attack. The flashes from Venus at regular intervals spout\ndeath and destruction upon the earth; a mammoth gun, sunk into the\nplanet itself, bears once upon the earth at every revolution, until the\nchanging position of the globes take the target out of range.\n\nIn less than a year and a half the planets must meet again. It is war to\nthe death; a united world against an enemy unknown--an enemy who has\nconquered space. And there is less than a year and a half in which to\nprepare!\n\nFar out in the blackness of space McGuire and Sykes are captives in the\ngiant ship. Their stupor leaves them; they find themselves immersed in\nclouds. The clouds part; their ship drops through; and below them is a\nstrange continent shaped like the letter \"L.\" Captives of inhuman but\nman-shaped things, they are landing upon a strange globe--upon the\nplanet Venus itself!\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nMiles underneath the great ship, from which Lieutenant McGuire and\nProfessor Sykes were now watching through a floor-window of thick glass,\nwas a glittering expanse of water--a great ocean. The flickering gold\nexpanse that reflected back the color of the sunlit clouds passed to one\nside as the ship took its station above the island, a continent in size,\nthat had shown by its shape like a sharply formed \"L\" an identifying\nmark to the astronomer.\n\nThey were high in the air; the thick clouds that surrounded this new\nworld were miles from its surface, and the things of the world that\nawaited were tiny and blurred.\n\nAirships passed and repassed far below. Large, some of them--as bulky\nas the transport they were on; others were small flashing cylinders, but\nall went swiftly on their way.\n\nIt must have come--some ethereal vibration to warn others from the\npath--for layer after layer of craft were cleared for the descent. A\nbrilliant light flashed into view, a dazzling pin-point on the shore\nbelow, and the great ship fell suddenly beneath them. Swiftly it dropped\ndown the pathway of light; on even keel it fell down and still down,\ntill McGuire, despite his experience in the air, was sick and giddy.\n\nThe light blinked out at their approach. It was some minutes before the\nwatching eyes recovered from the brilliance to see what mysteries might\nawait, and then the surface was close and the range of vision small.\n\nA vast open space--a great court paved with blocks of black and white--a\nlanding field, perhaps, for about it in regular spacing other huge\ncylinders were moored. Directly beneath in a clear space was a giant\ncradle of curved arms; it was a mammoth structure, and the men knew at a\nglance that this was the bed where their great ship would lie.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe smooth pavement seemed slowly rising to meet them as their ship\nsettled close. Now the cradle was below, its arms curved and waiting.\nThe ship entered their grasp, and the arms widened, then closed to draw\nthe monster to its rest. Their motion ceased. They were finally, beyond\nthe last faint doubt, at anchor on a distant world.\n\nA shrill cackle of sound recalled them from the thrill of this\nadventure, and the attenuated and lanky figure, with its ashen,\nblotchy face that glared at them from the doorway, reminded them that\nthis excursion into space was none of their desire. They were\nprisoners--captives from a foreign land.\n\nA long hand moved its sinuous fingers to motion them to follow, and\nMcGuire regarded his companion with a hopeless look and a despondent\nshrug of his shoulders.\n\n\"No use putting up a fight,\" he said; \"I guess we'd better be good.\"\n\nHe followed where the figure was stepping through a doorway into a\ncorridor beyond. They moved, silent and depressed, along the dimly\nlighted way; the touch of cold metal walls was as chilling to their\nspirits as to their flesh.\n\nBut the mood could not last: the first ray of light from the outside\nworld sent shivers of anticipation along their spines. They were\nlanding, in very fact, upon a new world; their feet were to walk where\nnever man had stood; their eyes would see what mortal eyes had never\nvisioned.\n\nFears were forgotten, and the men clung to each other not for the human\ntouch but because of an ecstasy of intoxicating, soul-filling joy in the\nsheer thrill of adventure.\n\nThey were gripping each other's hand, round-eyed as a couple of\nchildren, as they stepped forward into the light.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBefore them was a scene whose blazing beauty of color struck them to\nfrozen silence; their exclamations of wonder died unspoken on their\nlips. They were in a city of the stars, and to their eyes it seemed as\nif all the brilliance of the heavens had been gathered for its\nbuilding.\n\nThe spacious, open court itself stood high in the air among the masses\nof masonry, and beyond were countless structures. Some towered skyward;\nothers were lower; and all were topped with bulbous towers and graceful\nminarets that made a forest of gleaming opal light. Opalescence\neverywhere!--it flashed in red and gold and delicate blues from every\nwall and cornice and roof.\n\n\"Quartz?\" marveled Sykes after one long drawn breath. \"Quartz or\nglass?--what are they made of? It is fairyland!\"\n\nA jewelled city! Garish, it might have been, and tawdry, in the full\nlight of the sun. But on these weirdly unreal structures the sun's rays\nnever shone; they were illumined only by the soft golden glow that\ndiffused across this world from the cloud masses far above.\n\nMcGuire looked up at that uniform, glowing, golden mass that paled\ntoward the horizon and faded to the gray of banked clouds. His eyes came\nslowly back to the ramp that led downward to the checkered black and\nwhite of the court. Beyond an open portion the pavement was solidly\nmassed with people.\n\n\"People!--we might as well call them that,\" McGuire had told Sykes;\n\"they are people of a sort, I suppose. We'll have to give them credit\nfor brains: they've beaten us a hundred years in their inventions.\"\n\nHe was trying to see everything, understand everything, at once. There\nwas not time to single out the new impressions that were crowding upon\nhim. The air--it was warm to the point of discomfort; it explained the\nloose, light garments of the people; it came to the two men laden with\nstrange scents and stranger sounds.\n\nMcGuire's eyes held with hungry curiosity upon the dwellers in this\nother world; he stared at the gaping throng from which came a bedlam of\nshrill cries. Lean colorless hands gesticulated wildly and pointed with\nlong fingers at the two men.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe din ceased abruptly at a sharp, whistled order from their captor. He\nstood aside with a guard that had followed from the ship, and he\nmotioned the two before him down the gangway. It was the same scarlet\none who had faced them before, the one whom McGuire had attacked in a\nfrenzy of furious fighting, only to go down to blackness and defeat\nbefore the slim cylinder of steel and its hissing gas. And the slanting\neyes stared wickedly in cold triumph as he ordered them to go before\nhim in his march of victory.\n\nMcGuire passed down toward the masses of color that were the ones who\nwaited. There were many in the dull red of the ship's crew; others in\nsky-blue, in gold and pink and combinations of brilliance that blended\ntheir loose garments to kaleidoscopic hues. But the figures were similar\nin one unvarying respect: they were repulsive and ghastly, and their\nfaces showed bright blotches of blood vessels and blue markings of veins\nthrough their parchment-gray skins.\n\nThe crowd parted to a narrow, living lane, and lean fingers clutched\nwrithingly to touch them as they passed between the solid ranks.\n\nMcGuire had only a vague impression of a great building beyond, of lower\nstories decorated in barbaric colors, of towers above in strange forms\nof the crystal, colorful beauty they had seen. He walked toward it\nunseeing; his thoughts were only of the creatures round about.\n\n\"What damned beasts!\" he said. Then, like his companion, he set his\nteeth to restrain all show of feeling as they made their way through the\nlane of incredible living things.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey followed their captor through a doorway into an empty room--empty\nsave for one blue-clad individual who stood beside an instrument board\nlet into the wall. Beyond was a long wall, where circular openings\nyawned huge and black.\n\nThe one at the instrument panel received a curt order: the weird voice\nof the man in red repeated a word that stood out above his curious,\nwordless tone. \"Torg,\" he said, and again McGuire heard him repeat the\nsyllable.\n\nThe operator touched here and there among his instruments, and tiny\nlights flashed; he threw a switch, and from one of the black openings\nlike a deep cave came a rushing roar of sound. It dropped to silence as\nthe end of a cylindrical car protruded into the room. A door in the\nmetal car opened, and their guard hustled them roughly inside. The one\nin red followed while behind him the door clanged shut.\n\nInside the car was light, a diffused radiance from no apparent source,\nthe whole air was glowing about them. And beneath their feet the car\nmoved slowly but with a constant acceleration that built up to\ntremendous speed. Then that slackened, and Sykes and McGuire clung to\neach other for support while the car that had been shot like a\nprojectile came to rest.\n\n\"Whew!\" breathed the lieutenant; \"that was quick delivery.\" Sykes made\nno reply, and McGuire, too, fell silent to study the tremendous room\ninto which they were led. Here, seemingly, was the stage for their next\nexperience.\n\nA vast open hall with a floor of glass that was like obsidion, empty but\nfor carved benches about the walls; there was room here for a mighty\nconcourse of people. The walls, like those they had seen, were decorated\ncrudely in glaring colors, and embellished with grotesque designs that\nproclaimed loudly the inexpert touch of the draughtsman. Yet, above\nthem, the ceiling sprang lightly into vaulted, sweeping curves.\nMcGuire's training had held little of architecture, yet even he felt the\nbeauty of line and airy gracefulness of treatment in the structure\nitself.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe contrast between the flaunting colors and the finished artistry that\nlay beneath must have struck a discordant note to the scientist. He\nleaned closer to whisper.\n\n\"It is all wrong some way--the whole world! Beauty and refinement--then\ncrude vulgarity, as incongruous as the people themselves--they do not\nbelong here.\"\n\n\"Neither do we,\" was McGuire's reply; \"it looks like a tough spot that\nwe're in.\"\n\nHe was watching toward a high, arched entrance across the room. A\nplatform before it was raised some six feet above the floor, and on\nthis were seats--ornate chairs, done in sweeping scrolls of scarlet and\ngold. A massive seat in the center was like the fantastic throne of a\nchild's fairy tale. From the corridor beyond that entrance came a stir\nand rustling that rivetted the man's attention.\n\nA trumpet peal, vibrant and peculiar, blared forth from the ceiling\noverhead, and the red figures of the guards stood at rigid attention\nwith lean arms held stiffly before them. The one in scarlet took the\nsame attitude, then dropped his hands to motion the two men to give the\nsame salute.\n\n\"You go to hell,\" said Lieutenant McGuire in his gentlest tones. And the\nscarlet figure's thin lips were snarling as he turned to whip his arms\nup to their position. The first of a procession of figures was entering\nthrough the arch.\n\nSykes, the scientist, was paying little attention. \"It isn't true,\" he\nwas muttering aloud; \"it can't be true. Venus! Twenty-six million miles\nat inferior conjunction!\"\n\nHe seemed lost in silent communion with his own thoughts; then: \"But\nI said there was every probability of life; I pointed out the\nsimilarities--\"\n\n\"Hush!\" warned McGuire. The eyes of the scarlet man were sending wicked\nlooks in their direction. Tall forms were advancing through the arch.\nThey, too, were robed in scarlet, and behind them others followed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe trumpet peal from the dome above held now on a long-drawn, single\nnote, while the scarlet men strode in silence across the dais and parted\nto form two lines. An inverted \"V\" that faced the entrance--they were an\nassembly of rigid, blazing statues whose arms were extended like those\non the floor below.\n\nThe vibrant tone from on high changed to a crashing blare that shrieked\ndiscordantly to send quivering protest through every nerve of the\nwaiting men. Those about them were shouting, and again the name of Torg\nwas heard, as, in the high arch, another character appeared to play his\npart in a strange drama.\n\nThin like his companions, yet even taller than them, he wore the same\nbrilliant robes and, an additional mark of distinction, a head-dress of\npolished gold. He acknowledged the salute with a quick raising of his\nown arms, then came swiftly forward and took his place upon the massive\nthrone.\n\nNot till he was seated did the others on the platform relax their rigid\npose and seat themselves in the semicircle of chairs. And not till then\ndid they so much as glance at the men waiting there before them--the two\nEarth-men, standing in silent, impassive contemplation of the brilliant\nscene and with their arms held quiet at their sides. Then every eye\nturned full upon the captives, and if McGuire had seen deadly\nmalevolence in the face of their captor he found it a hundred-fold in\nthe inhuman faces that looked down upon them now.\n\nThe inquiring mind of Professor Sykes did not fail to note the\ncharacter of their reception. \"But why,\" he asked in whispers of his\nfellow-prisoner, \"--why this open hatred of us? What possible animus\ncan they have against the earth or its people?\"\n\nThe figure on the throne voiced a curt order; the one who had brought\nthem stepped forward. His voice was raised in the same discordant,\nsinging tone that leaped and wandered from note to note. It conveyed\nideas--that was apparent; it was a language that he spoke. And the\ncentral figure above nodded a brief assent as he finished.\n\nTheir captor took an arm of each in his long fingers and pushed them\nroughly forward to stand alone before the battery of hard eyes.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNow the crowned figure addressed them directly. His voice quavered\nsharply in what seemed an interrogation. The men looked blankly at each\nother.\n\nAgain the voice questioned them impatiently. Sykes and McGuire were\nsilent. Then the young flyer took an involuntary step forward and looked\nsquarely at the owner of the harsh voice.\n\n\"We don't know what you are saying,\" he began, \"and I suppose that our\nlingo makes no sense to you--\" He paused in helpless wonderment as to\nwhat he could say. Then--\n\n\"But what the devil is it all about?\" he demanded explosively. \"Why all\nthe dirty looks? You've got us here as prisoners--now what do you expect\nus to do? Whatever it is, you'll have to quit singing it and talk\nsomething we can understand.\"\n\nHe knew his words were useless, but this reception was getting on his\nnerves--and his arm still tingled where the scarlet one had gripped\nhim.\n\nIt seemed, though, that his meaning was not entirely lost. His words\nmeant nothing to them, but his tone must have carried its own message.\nThere were sharp exclamations from the seated circle. The one who had\nbrought them sprang forward with outstretched, clutching hands; his face\nwas a blood-red blotch. McGuire was waiting in crouching tenseness that\nmade the red one pause.\n\n\"You touch me again,\" said the waiting man, \"and I'll knock you into an\noutside loop.\"\n\nThe attacker's indecision was ended by a loud order from above. McGuire\nturned as if he had been spoken to by the leader on the throne. The thin\nfigure was leaning far forward; his eye were boring into those of the\nlieutenant, and he held the motionless pose for many minutes. To the\nangry man, staring back and upward, there came a peculiar optical\nillusion.\n\nThe evil face was vanishing in a shifting cloud that dissolved and\nreformed, as he watched, into pictures. He knew it was not there, the\nthing he saw; he knew he was regarding something as intangible as\nthought; but he got the significance of every detail.\n\nHe saw himself and Professor Sykes; they were being crushed like ants\nbeneath a tremendous heel; he knew that the foot that could grind out\ntheir lives was that of the one on the throne.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe cloud-stuff melted to new forms that grew clearer to show him the\nearth. A distorted Earth--and he knew the distortion came from the mind\nof the being before him who had never seen the earth at first hand; yet\nhe knew it for his own world. It was turning in space; he saw oceans and\ncontinents; and before his mental gaze he saw the land swarming with\nthese creatures of Venus. The one before him was in command; he was\nseated on an enormous throne; there were Earth people like Sykes and\nhimself who crept humbly before him, while fleets of great Venusian\nships hovered overhead.\n\nThe message was plain--plain as if written in words of fire in the brain\nof the man. McGuire knew that these creatures intended that the vision\nshould be true--they meant to conquer the earth. The slim, khaki-clad\nfigure of Lieutenant McGuire quivered with the strength of his refusal\nto accept the truth of what he saw. He shook his head to clear it of\nthese thought wraiths.\n\n\"Not--in--a--million--years!\" he said, and he put behind his words all\nthe mental force at his command. \"Try that, old top, and they'll give\nyou the fight of your life--\" He checked his words as he saw plainly\nthat the thin cruel face that stared and stared was getting nothing from\nhis reply.\n\n\"Now what do you think about that?\" he demanded of Professor Sykes. \"He\ngot an idea across to me--some form of telepathy. I saw his mind, or I\nsaw what he wanted me to see of it. It's taps, he says, for us, and then\nthey think they're going across and annex the world.\"\n\nHe glanced upward again and laughed loudly for the benefit of those who\nwere watching him so closely. \"Fine chance!\" he said; \"a fat chance!\"\nBut in the deeper recesses of his mind he was shaken.\n\nFor themselves there was no hope. Well, that was all in a lifetime. But\nthe other--the conquest of the earth--he had to try with all his power\nof will to keep from his mind the pictures of destruction these beastly\nthings could bring about.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe chief of this strange council made a gesture of contempt with the\ngrotesque hands that were so translucent yet ashy-pale against his\nscarlet robe, and the down-drawn thin lips reflected the thoughts that\nprompted it. The open opposition of Lieutenant McGuire failed to impress\nhim, it seemed. At a word the one who had brought them sprang forward.\n\nHe addressed himself to the circle of men, and he harangued them\nmightily in harsh discordance. He pointed one lean hand at the two\ncaptives, then beat it upon his own chest. \"They are mine,\" he was\nsaying, as the men knew plainly. And they realized as if the weird talk\ncame like words to their ears that this monster was demanding that the\ncaptives be given him.\n\nAn exchange of dismayed glances, and \"Not so good!\" said McGuire under\nhis breath; \"Simon Legree is asking for his slaves. Mean, ugly devil,\nthat boy!\"\n\nThe lean figures on the platform were bending forward, an expression of\nmirth--distorted, animal smiles--upon their flabby lips. They\nrepresented to the humans, so helpless before them, a race of thinking\nthings in whom no last vestige of kindness or decency remained. But was\nthere an exception? One of the circle was standing; the one beside them\nwas sullenly silent as the other on the platform addressed their ruler.\n\nHe spoke at some length, not with the fire and vehemence of the one who\nhad claimed them, but more quietly and dispassionately, and his cold\neyes, when they rested on those of McGuire and Sykes, seemed more\ncrafty than actively ablaze with malevolent ill-will. Plainly it was the\ncouncilor now, addressing his superior. His inhuman voice was silenced\nby a reply from the one on the throne.\n\nHe motioned--this gold-crowned figure of personified evil--toward the\ntwo men, and his hand swept on toward the one who had spoken. He intoned\na command in harsh gutturals that ended in a sibilant shriek. And the\ntwo standing silent and hopeless exchanged looks of despair.\n\nThey were being delivered to this other--that much was plain--but that\nit boded anything but captivity and torment they could not believe. That\nlast phrase was too eloquent of hissing hate.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe creature rose, tall and ungainly, from his throne; amid the\nsalutations of his followers he turned and vanished through the arch.\nThe others of his council followed, all but the one. He motioned to the\ntwo men to come with him, and the sullen one who had demanded the men\nfor himself obeyed an order from this councilor who was his superior.\n\nHe snapped an order, and four of his men ranged themselves about the\ncaptives as a guard. Thin metal cords were whipped about the wrists of\neach; their hands were tied. The wire cut like a knife-edge if they\nstrained against it.\n\nThe new director of their destinies was vanishing through an exit at one\nside of the great hall; their guard hustled them after. A corridor\nopened before them to end in a gold-lit portal; it was daylight out\nbeyond where a street was filled with hurrying figures in many colors.\nWith quavering shrieks they scattered like frightened fowls as an\nairship descended between the tall buildings that reflected its passing\nin opalescent hues.\n\nIt was a small craft compared with the one that had brought them, and\nit swept down to settle lightly upon the street with no least regard\nfor those who might be crushed by its descent. Consideration for their\nfellows did not appear as a marked characteristic of this strange\npeople, McGuire observed thoughtfully. They swarmed in endless droves,\nthese multicolored beings who made of the thoroughfare an ever-changing\nkaleidoscope--and what was a life or two, more or less, among so many?\nHe found no comfort for themselves in the thought.\n\nShoulder to shoulder, the two followed where the scarlet figure of the\ncouncilor moved toward the waiting ship. Only the professor paid further\nheed to their surroundings; he marveled aloud at the numbers of the\npeople.\n\n\"Hundreds of them,\" he said; \"thousands! They are swarming everywhere\nlike rats. Horrible!\" His eyes passed on to the buildings in their glory\nof delicate hues, as he added, \"And the contrast they make with their\nsurroundings! It is all wrong some way; I wish I knew--\"\n\nThey were in the ship when McGuire replied. \"I hope we live long enough\nto satisfy your curiosity,\" he said grimly.\n\nThe ship was rising beneath them; the opal and quartz of the city's\nwalls were flashing swiftly down.\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nThey were in a cabin at the very nose of the ship, seated on metal\nchairs, their hands unshackled and free. Their scarlet guardian reclined\nat ease somewhat to one side, but despite his apparent disregard his\ncold eyes seldom left the faces of the two men.\n\nWindows closed them in; windows on each side, in front, above them, and\neven in the floor beneath. It was a room for observation whose\nmetal-latticed walls served only as a framework for the glass. And there\nwas much to be observed.\n\nThe golden radiance of sunlit clouds was warm above. They rose toward\nit, until, high over the buildings' tallest spires, there spread on\nevery hand the bewildering beauty of that forest of minarets and sloping\nroofs and towers, whose many facets made glorious blendings of soft\ncolor. Aircraft at many levels swept in uniform directions throughout\nthe sky. The ship they were in hung quiet for a time, then rose to a\nhigher level to join the current of transportation that flowed into the\nsouth.\n\n\"We will call it south,\" said Professor Sykes. \"The sun-glow, you will\nobserve, is not directly overhead; the sun is sinking; it is past their\nnoon. What is the length of their day? Ah, this interesting--interesting!\"\nThe certain fate they had foreseen was forgotten; it is not often given to\nan astronomer to check at first hand his own indefinite observations.\n\n\"Look!\" McGuire exclaimed. \"Open country! The city is ending!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAhead and below them the buildings were smaller and scattered. Their new\nmaster was watching with closest scrutiny the excitement of the men; he\nwhispered an order into a nearby tube, and the ship slowly slanted\ntoward the ground. He was studying these new specimens, as McGuire\nobserved, but the lieutenant paid little attention; his eyes were too\nthoroughly occupied in resolving into recognizable units the picture\nthat flowed past them so quickly. He was accustomed, this pilot of the\narmy air service, to reading clearly the map that spreads beneath a\nplane, but now he was looking at an unfamiliar chart.\n\n\"Fields,\" he said, and pointed to squared areas of pale reds and blues;\n\"though what it is, heaven knows. And the trees!--if that's what they\nare.\" The ship went downward where an area of tropical denseness made a\ntangled mass of color and shadow.\n\n\"Trees!\" Lieutenant McGuire had exclaimed, but these forests were of\ntree-forms in weirdest shapes and hues. They grew to towering heights,\nand their branches and leaves that swayed and dipped in the slow-moving\nair were of delicate pastel shades.\n\n\"No sunlight,\" said the Professor excitedly; \"they have no direct rays\nof the sun. The clouds act as a screen and filter out actinic rays.\"\n\nMcGuire did not reply. He was watching the countless dots of color that\nwere people--people who swarmed here as they had in the city; people\nworking at these great groves, crouching lower in the fields as the ship\nswept close; people everywhere in teeming thousands. And like the\nvegetation about them, they, too, were tall and thin, attenuated of form\nand with skin like blood-stained ash.\n\n\"They need the sun,\" Sykes was repeating; \"both vegetable and animal\nlife. The plants are deficient in chlorophyl--see the pale green of the\nleaves!--and the people need vitamins. Yet they evidently have electric\npower in abundance. I could tell them of lamps--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis comments ceased as McGuire lurched heavily against him. The flyer\nhad taken note of the tense, attentive attitude of the one in scarlet;\nthe man was leaning forward, his eyes focused directly upon the\nscientist's face; he seemed absorbing both words and emotions.\n\nHow much could he comprehend? What power had he to vision the\nidea-pictures in the other's mind? McGuire could not know. But \"Sorry!\"\nhe told Sykes; \"that was clumsy of me.\" And he added in a whisper, \"Keep\nyour thoughts to yourself; I think this bird is getting them.\"\n\nBuildings flashed under them, not massed solidly as in the city, yet\nspaced close to one another as if every foot of ground not devoted to\ntheir incredible agriculture were needed to house the inhabitants. The\nground about them was alive with an equally incredible humanity that\nswarmed over all this world in appalling profusion.\n\nTheir horrid flesh! Their hideous features! And their number! McGuire\nhad a sudden, sickening thought. They were larvae, these crawling\nhordes--vile worm-things that infested a beautiful world--that bred here\nin millions, their numbers limited only by the space for their bodies\nand the food for their stomachs. And he, McGuire, a _man_--he and this\nother man with his clear-thinking scientific brain were prisoners to\nthis horde; captives, to be used or butchered by those vile, crawling\nthings!\n\nAnd again it was this world of contrast that drove home the conviction\nwith its sickening certainty. A world of beauty, of delicate colors, of\nsweeping oceans and gleaming shores and towering cities with their grace\nand beauty and elfin splendor yet a world that shuddered beneath this\ndevouring plague of grublike men.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey swept past cities and towns and over many miles of open land before\ntheir craft swung eastward toward the dark horizon. The master gave\nanother order into the speaking tube and their ship shot forward, faster\nand yet faster, with a speed that pressed them heavily into their seats.\nBehind them was the glory of the sunlit clouds; ahead the gloomy\ngray-black masses that must make a stygian night sky over this lonely\nworld--a world cut off by that vaporous shell from all communion with\nthe stars.\n\nThey were over the water; before them a dark ocean reached out in\nforbidding emptiness to a darker horizon. Ahead, the only broken line in\nthe vast level expanse was a mountain rising abruptly from the sea. It\nwas a volcanic cone surmounting an island; the sunlight's glow reflected\nfrom behind them against the sombre mass that lifted toward the clouds.\nTheir ship was high enough to clear it, but instead it swung, as McGuire\nwatched, toward the south.\n\nThe island drifted past, and again they were on their course. But to\nthe flyer there were significant facts that could not pass unobserved.\nTheir own ship had swung in a great circle to avoid this mountain. And\nall through the skies were others that did the same. The air above and\nabout the grim sentinel peak was devoid of flying shapes.\n\nMcGuire caught the eyes of the councilor, their keeper. \"What is that?\"\nhe asked, though he knew the words were lost on the other. He nodded his\nhead toward the distant peak, and his question was plainly in regard to\nthe island. And for the first time since their coming to this wild\nworld, he saw, flashing across the features of one of these men, a trace\nof emotion that could only be construed as fear.\n\nThe slitted cat eyes lost their look of complacent superiority. They\nwidened involuntarily, and the face was drained of its blotched color.\nThere was fear, terror unmistakable, though it showed for but an\ninstant. He had control of his features almost at once, but the flyer\nhad read their story.\n\nHere was something that gave pause to this race of conquering vermin; a\nplace in the expanse of this vast sea that brought panic to their\nhearts. And there came to him, as he stowed the remembrance away in his\nmind, the first glow of hope. These things could fear a mountain; it\nmight be that they could be brought to fear a man.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe sky was clearing rapidly of traffic and the mountain of his\nspeculations was lost astern, when another island came slanting swiftly\nup to meet them as their ship swept down from the heights. It was a tiny\nspeck in the ocean's expanse, a speck that resolved itself into the\nsquared fields of colored growth, orchards whose brilliant, strange\nfruits glowed crimson in the last light of day, and enormous trees,\nbeyond which appeared a house.\n\nA palace, McGuire concluded, when he saw clearly the many-storied pile.\nLike the buildings they had seen, this also constructed of opalescent\nquartz. There were windows that glowed warmly in the dusk. A sudden wave\nof loneliness, almost unbearable, swept over the man.\n\nWindows and gleaming lights, the good sounds of Earth; home!... And his\nears, as he stepped out into the cool air, were assailed with the\nstrange cackle and calling of weird folk; the air brought him scents,\nfrom the open ground beyond, of fruits and vegetation like none he had\never known; and the earth, the homeland of his vain imaginings, was\nmillions of empty miles away....\n\nThe leader stopped, and McGuire looked dispiritedly at the unfamiliar\nlandscape under dusky lowering skies. Trees towered high in the\nair--trees grotesque and weird by all Earth standards--whose limbs were\npale green shadows in the last light of day. The foliage, too, seemed\nbleached and drained of color, but among the leaves were flashes of\nbrilliance where night-blooming flowers burst open like star-shells to\nfill the air with heavy scents.\n\nBetween the men and the forest growth was a row of denser vegetation,\ngreat ferns twenty feet and more in height, and among them at regular\nintervals stood plants of another growth--each a tremendous pod held in\nair on a thick stalk. Tendrils coiled themselves like giant springs\nbeside each pod, tendrils as thick as a man's wrist. The great pods were\nranged in a line that extended as far as McGuire could see in the dim\nlight.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis shoulders drooped as the guard herded him and his companion toward\nthe building beyond. He must not be cast down--he would not! Who knew\nhow much of such feeling was read by these keen-eyed observers? And the\nonly thought with which he could fill his mind, the one forlorn ghost of\na hope that he could cling to, was that of an island, a volcanic peak\nthat rose from dark waters to point upward toward the heights.\n\nThe guard of four was clustered about; the figures were waiting now in\nthe gathering dark--waiting, while the one in scarlet listened and spoke\nalternately into a jeweled instrument that hung by a slender chain about\nhis neck. He raised one lean hand to motion the stirring guards to\nsilence, listened again intently into the instrument, then pointed that\nhand toward the cloud-filled sky, while he craned his thin neck to look\nabove him.\n\nThe men's eyes followed the pointing hand to see only the sullen black\nof unlit clouds. The last distant aircraft had vanished from the skies;\nnot a ship was in the air--only the enveloping blanket of high-flung\nvapor that blocked out all traces of the heavens. And then!--\n\nThe cloud banks high in the skies flashed suddenly to dazzling, rolling\nflame. The ground under their feet was shaken as by a distant\nearthquake, while, above, the terrible fire spread, a swift, flashing\nconflagration that ate up the masses of clouds.\n\n\"What in thunder--\" McGuire began; then stopped as he caught, in the\nlight from above, the reflection of fierce exultation in the eyes of the\nscarlet one. The evil, gloating message of those eyes needed no words to\nexplain its meaning. That this cataclysm was self-made by these beings,\nMcGuire knew, and he knew that in some way it meant menace to him and\nhis.\n\nYet he groped in thought for some definite meaning. No menace could this\nbe to himself personally, for he and Sykes stood there safe in the\ncompany of the councilor himself. Then the threat of this flaming blast\nmust be directed toward the earth!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe fire vanished, and once more, as Professor Sykes had seen on that\nnight so long ago, the blanket of clouds was broken. McGuire followed\nthe gaze of the scientist whose keen eyes were probing in these brief\nmoments into the depths of star-lit space.\n\n\"There--there!\" Sykes exclaimed in awe-struck tones. His hand was\npointing outward through the space where flames had cleared the sky. A\nstar was shining in the heavens with a glory that surpassed all others.\nIt outshone all neighboring stars, and it sent its light down through\nthe vast empty reaches of space, a silent message to two humans,\ndespondent and heartsick, who stared with aching eyes.\n\nLieutenant McGuire did not hear his friend's whispered words. No need to\nname that distant world--it was Earth! Earth!... And it was calling to\nits own....\n\nThere was a flying-field--so plain before his mental eyes; men in khaki\nand leather who moved and talked and spoke of familiar things ... and\nthe thunder of motors ... and roaring planes....\n\nSome far recess within his deeper self responded strangely. What now of\nthreats and these brute-things that threatened?--he was one with this\npicture he had visioned. He was himself; he was a man of that distant\nworld of men; they would show these vile things how men could meet\nmenace--or death.... His shoulders were back and unconsciously he stood\nerect.\n\nThe scarlet figure was close beside them in the dusk, his voice vibrant\nwith a quality which should have struck fear to his captives' hearts as\nhe ordered them on. But the look in his crafty eyes changed to one of\npuzzled wonder at sight of the men.\n\nHands on each other's shoulders, they stood there in the gathering dark,\nwhere grotesque trees arched twistingly overhead. Their moment of\ndepression had passed; Earth had called, and they had heard it, each\nafter his own fashion. But to each the call had been one of clear\ncourage. No longer cast off and forlorn, they were one with their own\nworld.\n\n\"Down,\" said Professor Sykes with a whimsical smile; \"down, but not\nout!\" And the lieutenant responded in kind.\n\n\"Are we down-hearted?\" he demanded loudly. And the two turned as one man\nto grin at the scarlet one as they thundered. \"N-o-o!\"\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nTwo men grinned in derision at the horrible, man-shaped thing that held\ntheir destinies in his lean, inhuman hands!--but they turned abruptly\naway to look again above them where that bright star still shone through\nan opening in the clouds.\n\n\"The earth! Home!\" It seemed as if they could never tear their eyes away\nfrom the sight.\n\nTheir captor whistled an order, and the guard of four tugged vainly at\nthe two, who resisted that they might gaze upon their own world until\nthe closing clouds should blot it from sight. A cry from one of the red\nguards roused them.\n\nThe dark was closing in fast, and their surroundings were dim. Vaguely,\nMcGuire felt more than saw one of the red figures whirled into the air.\nHe sensed a movement in the jungle darkness where were groves of weird\ntrees and the tangle of huge vegetable growths. What it was he could not\nsay, but he felt the guard who clutched at him quiver in terror.\n\nTheir leader snatched at the instrument that hung about his neck and put\nit to his lips; he whistled an order, sharp and shrill. Blazing light\nthat seemed to flame in the air was the response; the air was aglow with\nan all-pervading brilliance like that in the car that had whirled them\nfrom the landing field. The light was everywhere, and the building\nbefore them was surrounded by a dazzling envelope of luminosity.\n\nWhatever of motion or menace there had been ceased abruptly. Their\nguard, three now in number instead of four, seized them roughly and\nhustled them toward an open door. No time, as they passed, for more than\nfleeting impressions: a hall of warm, glowing light--a passage that\nbranched off--and, at the end, a room into which they were thrown, while\na metal door clanged behind them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThese were no gentle hands that hurled the men staggering through the\ndoorway, and Professor Sykes fell headlong upon the glassy floor. He\nsprang to his feet, his face aflame with anger. \"The miserable beasts!\"\nhe shouted.\n\n\"Take it easy,\" admonished the flyer. \"We're in the hoose-gow; no use of\ngetting all fussed up if they don't behave like perfect gentlemen.\n\n\"There's a bunk in the corner,\" he said, and pointed to a woven hammock\nthat was covered with soft cloths; \"and here's another that I can sling.\nTwin beds! What more do you want?\"\n\nHe opened a door and the splash of falling water came to them. A\nfountain cascaded to the ceiling to fall splashing upon a floor of\ninlaid, glassy tile. McGuire whistled.\n\n\"Room and bath,\" he said. \"And you complained of the service!\"\n\n\"I have an idea,\" he told the scientist, \"that our scarlet friend who\nowns this place intends to treat us decently, even though his helpers\nare a bit rough. My hunch is that he wants to get some information out\nof us. That old bird back there in the council chamber told me as plain\nas day that they think they are going to conquer the earth. Maybe that's\nwhy we are here--as exhibits A and B, for them to study and learn how to\nlick us.\"\n\n\"You are talking what I would have termed nonsense a month ago,\"\nreplied Sykes, \"but now--well, I am afraid you are right. And,\" he said\nslowly, \"I fear that they are equally correct. They have conquered\nspace; they have ships propelled by some unknown power; they have gas\nweapons, as you and I have reason to know. And they have all the\nbeastly ferocity to carry such a plan through to success. But I wonder\nwhat that sky-splitting blast meant.\"\n\n\"Bombardment,\" the flyer told him; \"bombardment of the earth as sure as\nyou're alive.\"\n\n\"More nonsense,\" said Sykes; \"and probably correct.... Well, what are we\nto do?--sit tight and give them as little information as we can? or--\"\nHis question ended unfinished; the alternative, it seemed, was not plain\nto him.\n\n\"There's only one answer,\" said McGuire. \"We must get away; escape\nsomehow.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nProfessor Sykes' eyes showed his appreciation of a spirit that could\nstill dare to hope, but he asked dejectedly: \"Escape? Good idea. But\nwhere to?\"\n\n\"I have an idea,\" the flyer said slowly. \"An idea about an island.\" He\ntold the professor what he had observed--the fact that there was one\nspot of land on this globe from which the traffic of these monsters of\nVenus steered clear. This, he explained, must have some significance.\n\n\"Whatever is there, God only knows,\" he admitted, \"but it is something\nthese devils don't like a little bit. It might be interesting to learn\nmore. We'll make a break for it; find a boat. No, we probably can't do\nit, but we can make a try. Now what is our first step, I wonder.\"\n\n\"Our first step,\" said Professor Sykes, measuring his words as if he\nmight be working out some astronomical calculation, \"is into the\ninverted shower-bath, if you feel as hot as I do. And our next step,\nwhen all is quiet for the night, is through the window I see beyond. I\ncan see the branches of one of those undernourished trees from here.\"\n\n\"Last one in is a lop-eared Venusian!\" said McGuire, throwing off his\njacket. And in that strange room in a strange world, under the shadow of\ndeath and of tortures unknown, the two men stripped with all the\ncare-free abandon of a couple of schoolboys racing to be first in the\nold swimming hole.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was some time later when the door opened and a long red hand pushed a\ntray of food into the room. The tray was of unbreakable crystal--he\nrattled it heedlessly upon the floor--and it held crystal dishes of\nunknown foods.\n\nThey were sampling them all when Sykes remarked plaintively, \"I would\nlike to know what under heaven I am eating.\"\n\n\"I've wished to know that in lots of restaurants,\" McGuire replied. \"I\nremember a place down on--\" He stopped abruptly, then chewed in silence\nupon a fruit like a striped pepper that stung his mouth and tongue while\nhe scarcely felt it. References to Earth things plainly were to be\navoided: the visions they brought before one's eyes were unnerving.\n\nThey made a pretence of sleeping in case they were being observed, and\nit was some hours later when the two stood quietly beside the open\nwindow. As Sykes had seen, there were branches of a pale, twisted\ntree-growth close outside. McGuire tried his weight upon them, then\nswung himself out, hand over hand, upon the branch that bent low beneath\nhim. Sykes was close behind when he clambered to the ground to stand for\nsome minutes, listening silently in the dark.\n\n\"Too easy!\" the lieutenant whispered. \"They are too foxy to leave\na gateway like that--but here we are. The shore is off in this\ndirection.\"\n\nThe dark of a night unrelieved by a single star was about them as they\nmoved noiselessly away. They followed open ground at first. The building\nthat had been their brief prison was upon their right; beyond and at the\nleft was where the ship landed--it was gone now--and beyond that the\nwall of vegetation.\n\nAnd again, in the dark, McGuire had an uncanny sense of motion. Soft\nbodies were slipping quietly one upon another; something that lived was\nthere beyond them in the night. No sound or sign of life came from the\nhouse; no guard had been posted; and McGuire stopped again, before\nplunging into the tangled growth, to whisper, \"Too easy, Sykes! There's\nsomething about this--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe had pushed aside the fronds of a giant fern; a cautious step\nbeyond his hands touched a slippery, pliant vine. And his whisper\nended as he felt the thing turn and twist beneath his hand. It was\nalive!--writhing!--cold as the body of a monster snake, and just as\nvicious and savage in the way that it whipped down and about him in\nthe gloom of the starless night.\n\nThe thing was alive! It threw its coils around his body in an embrace\nthat left him breathless; a slender tendril was tightening about his\nneck; his hands and arms were bound.\n\nHis ankle was grasped as he was whirled aloft--a human hand that gripped\nhim this time--and Sykes, forgetting discretion and the need for\nsilence, was shouting in the darkness that gave no clue to their\nopponent. \"Hang on!\" he yelled. \"I've got you, Mac!\"\n\nHis shouts were cut short by another serpent shape that thrashed him and\nsmashed the softer growing things to earth that it might wrap this man,\ntoo, in its deadly coils.\n\nMcGuire felt his companion's hold loosen as he was lifted from the\nground; there were other arms flailing about him--living, coiling things\nthat seemed to fight one with another for this prize. Abruptly,\nblindingly, the scene was vividly etched before him: the strange trees,\nthe ferns, the writhing and darting serpent-arms! They were illumined in\na dazzling, white light!\n\nHe was in the air, clutched strangely in constricting arms; an odor of\nrotted flesh was in his nostrils, sickening, suffocating! Beyond and\nalmost beneath him a cauldron of green gaped open, and he saw within it\na pool of thick liquid that eddied and steamed to give off the stench\nof putrescence.\n\nAll this in an instant of vision--and in that instant he knew the death\nthey courted. It was a giant pod that held that pool--one of the growths\nhe had seen ranged out like a line of sentinels. But the terrible\ntendrils that had been coiled and at rest were wrapped about him now,\ndrawing him to that reeking pool of death and the waiting thick lips\nthat would close above him. Sykes, too! The tendrils that had clutched\nhim were whisking his helpless body where another gaping mouth was\nopen--\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd then, in the blazing light that was more brilliant than any light of\nday in this world, the hold about McGuire relaxed. He saw, as he fell,\nthe thick, green lips snap shut; and the arms that had held him pulled\nback into harmless, tight-wound coils.\n\nTheir bodies crashed to earth where a great fern bent beneath them to\ncushion their fall. And the men lay silent and gasping for great choking\nbreaths, while from the building beyond came the cackle and shrieking of\nman-things in manifest enjoyment of the frustrated plans.\n\nIt was the laughter that determined McGuire.\n\n\"Damn the plants!\" he said between hoarse breaths. \"Man-eating\nplants--but they're--better--than--those devils! And there's only--one\nline of them: I saw them here before. Shall we go on?--make a break for\nit?\"\n\nSykes rolled to the shelter of an arching frond and, without a word,\nwent crawling away. McGuire was behind him, and the two, as they came to\nopen ground, sprang to their feet and ran on through the weird orchard\nwhere tree trunks made dim, twisting lines. They ran blindly and\nhelplessly toward the outer dark that promised temporary shelter.\n\nA hopeless attempt: both men, knew the futility of it, while they\nstumbled onward through the dark. Behind them the night was hideous\nwith noise as the great palace gave forth an eruption of shrieking,\ninhuman forms that scattered with whistling and wailing calls in all\ndirections.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA mile or more of groping, hopeless flight, till a yellow gleam shone\namong the trees to guide them. A building, beyond a clearing, gave a\nbright illumination to the black night.\n\n\"We've run in a circle,\" choked McGuire, his voice weak and uncertain\nwith exhaustion. \"Like a couple of fools!--\"\n\nHe waited until the heavy breathing that shook his body might be\ncontrolled, then corrected himself. \"No--this is another--a new one--see\nthe towers! And listen--it's a radio station!\"\n\nThe slender frameworks that towered high in air glowed like flame--a\nwarning to the ships whose lights showed now and then far overhead. And,\nclear and distinct, there came to the listening men the steady,\ncrackling hiss of an uninterrupted signal.\n\nAgainst the lighted building moving figures showed momentarily, and\nMcGuire pulled his friend into the safe concealment of a tangle of\ngrowth, while the group of yelling things sped past.\n\n\"Come on,\" he told Sykes; \"we can't get away--not a chance! Let's have a\nlook at this place, and perhaps--well, I have an idea!\" He slipped\nsilently, cautiously on, where a forest of jungle ferns gave promise of\nsafe passage.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSome warning had been sounded; the occupants of the building were\nscattered to aid in the man-hunt. Only one was left in the room where\ntwo Earth-men peeped in at the door.\n\nThe figure was seated upon an insulated platform, and his long hands\nmanipulated keys and levers on a table before him. McGuire and Sykes\nstared amazedly at this broadcasting station whose air was filled with a\npandemonium of crashing sound from some distant room, but McGuire was\nconcerned mainly with the motion of a lean, blood-red hand that swung\nan object like a pointer in free-running sweeps above a dial on the\ntable. And he detected a variation in the din from beyond as the pointer\nmoved swiftly.\n\nHere was the control board for those messages he had heard; this was the\ninstrument that varied the sending mechanism to produce the wailing\nwireless cries that made words in some far-distant ears. McGuire, as he\nslipped into the room and crept within leaping distance of the grotesque\nthing so like yet unlike a man, was as silent as the nameless, writhing\nhorror that had seized them in the dark. He sprang, and the two came\ncrashing to the floor.\n\nLean arms came quickly about him to clutch and tear at his face, but the\nflyer had an arm free, and one blow ended the battle. The man of Venus\nrelaxed to a huddle of purple and yellow cloth from which a ghastly face\nprotruded. McGuire leaped to his feet and sprang to the place where the\nother had been.\n\n\"Hold them off as long as you can!\" he shouted to Sykes, and his hand\nclosed upon the pointer.\n\nDid this station send where he was hoping? Was this the station that had\ncommunicated with the ship that had hovered above their flying field in\nthat far-off land? He did not know, but it was a powerful station, and\nthere was a chance--\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe moved the pointer frantically here and there, swung it to one side\nand another; then found at last a point on the outside of the strange\ndesign beneath his hand where the pointer could rest while the crashing\ncrackle of sound was stilled.\n\nAnd now he swung the pointer--upon the plate--anywhere!--and the noise\nfrom beyond told instantly of the current's passage. He held it an\ninstant, then pushed it back to the silent spot--a dash! A quick return\nthat flashed back again to bring silence--a dot! More dashes and dots\n... and McGuire thanked a kindly heaven that had permitted him to learn\nthe language of the air, while he cursed his slowness in sending.\n\nWould it reach? Would there be anyone to hear? No certainty; he could\nonly flash the wild Morse symbols out into the night. He must try to get\nword to them--warn them! And \"Blake,\" he called, and spelled out the\nname of their field, \"warning--Venus--\"\n\n\"Hold them!\" he yelled to Sykes at the sound of rushing feet. \"Keep them\noff as long as you can!\"\n\n\"... Prepare--for invasion. Blake, this is McGuire....\" Over and over,\nhe worked the swinging pointer into symbols that might in some way, by\nsome fortunate chance, help that helpless people to resist the horror\nthat lay ahead.\n\nAnd while heavy bodies crashed against the door that Sykes was holding,\nthere came from some deep-hidden well of memory an inspiration. There\nwas a man he had once met--a man who had confided wondrous things; and\nnow, with the knowledge of these others who had conquered space, he\ncould believe wholly what he had laughed and joked about before. That\nman, too, had claimed to have travelled far from the earth; he had\ninvented a machine; his name--\n\nThe pointer was swinging in frenzied haste to spell over and over the\nname of a man, and the name, too, of a forgotten place in the mountains\nof Nevada. It was repeating the message; then finished in one long\ncrashing wail as a cloud of vapor shot about McGuire and his hand upon\nthe pointer went suddenly limp.\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nCaptain Blake's game of solitaire had become an obsession. He drove\nhimself to the utmost in the line of duty, and, through the day, the\ndemands of the flying field filled his mind to forgetfulness. And for\nthe rest, he forced his mind to concentrate upon the turn of the cards.\nHe could not read--and he must not think!--so he sat through long\nevenings trying vainly to forget.\n\nHe looked up with an expressionless face as Colonel Boynton entered the\nroom. The colonel saw the cards and nodded.\n\n\"Does that help?\" he asked, and added without waiting for an answer, \"I\ndon't like cards, but I find my mathematics works well.... My old\nproblems--I can concentrate on them, and stop this eternal, damnable\nthinking, thinking--\"\n\nThere was something of the same look forming about the eyes of\nboth--that look that told of men who struggled gamely under the sentence\nof death, refusing to think or to fear, and waiting, waiting,\nimpotently. Blake looked at the colonel with a carefully emotionless\ngaze. \"It's hell in the big towns, I hear.\"\n\nThe Colonel nodded. \"Can't blame them much, if that's what appeals to\nthem. A year and a half!--and they've got to forget it. Why not crowd\nall the recklessness and excesses they can into the time that is\nleft?--poor devils! But for the most part the world is wagging along,\nand people are going through the familiar motions.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Blake, \"I used to wonder at times how a man might feel if\nhe were facing execution. Now we all know. Just going dumbly along,\nfeeling as little as we can, thinking of anything, everything--except\nthe one thing. They've turned to using dope, a lot of them, I hear.\nMaybe it helps; nobody cares much. Only a year and a half.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe raised his face from which all expression was consciously erased.\n\"Any possible hope?\" he asked. \"Or do we take it when it comes and fight\nwith what we've got as long as we can? There was some talk in the papers\nof an invention--Bureau of Standards cooperating with the big General\nCommittee to investigate. Anything come of it?\"\n\n\"A thousand of them,\" said the colonel, \"all futile. No, we can't expect\nmuch from those things. Though there's a whisper that came to me from\nWashington. General Clinton--you may remember him; he was here when the\nthing first broke--says that some scientist, a real one, not another of\nthese half-baked geniuses, has worked out a transformation of some kind.\nIt was too deep for me, but it is based upon changing hydrogen into\nhelium, I think. Liberates some perfectly tremendous amount of power.\nThe general had it all down pat--\"\n\nHe stopped speaking at the change in Captain Blake's face. The careful\nrepression of all emotions was gone; the face was suddenly alive--\n\n\"I know,\" he said sharply; \"I remember something of the theory. There is\na difference in the atoms or their protons--the liberation of an\nelectron from each atom--matter actually transformed into energy;\ntheoretical, what I have read. But--but--Oh my God, Boynton, do you mean\nthat they've got it?--that it will drive us through space?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe colonel drove one fist into the palm of his other hand. \"Fool!\nIdiot!\" he exclaimed, and it was evident that the epithets were intended\nfor himself.\n\n\"I had forgotten that you had been trained along that line. The general\nwants a man to work with them, somewhat as a liason officer to link the\narmy requirements closely with their developments; we are hoping to work\nout a space ship, of course. You are just the man; I will radio him this\nminute. Be ready to leave--\" The slamming of the door marked a hurried\nexit toward the radio room.\n\nAnd abruptly, stifflingly, Captain Blake dared to hope. \"Scientists will\ncome through with something, some new method of propulsion. All the\nworld is looking to them!\" His thoughts were leaping from one\npossibility to another. \"Some miracle of power that will drive a fleet\nthrough space as they have done, to battle with the enemy on his own\nground--\"\n\nCould he help? Was there one little thing that he could do to apply\ntheir knowledge to practical ends? The thought thrilled him with\noverpowering emotion an hour later as he felt the lift of the plane\nbeneath him.\n\n\"Report to General Clinton,\" the colonel's reply had said. \"Captain\nBlake will be assigned to special duty.\" He opened the throttle to his\nship's best cruising speed, but his spirit was soaring ahead to urge on\nthe swift scout ship whose wings drove steadily into the gathering\ndusk.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd then, after long hours, Washington! Brief words with many men--and\ndiscouragement! The seat of government of the United States was a city\nof despondent men, weary, hopeless, but fighting. There was a look of\nstrain on every face; the eyes told a story of sleepless nights and\nfutile thinking and planning. Blake's elation was short lived.\n\nHe was sent to New York and on into the state, where the laboratories of\na great electrical company had turned their equipment from commercial\npurposes to those of war. Here, surely, one might find fuel to feed the\ndying embers of hope; the new development must give greater promise than\nGeneral Clinton had intimated.\n\n\"Nothing you can do as yet,\" he was told, when he had stated his\nmission. \"It is still experimental, but we have worked out the\ntransformation on a small scale, and harnessed the power.\"\n\nCaptain Blake was in no mood for temporizing; he was tired with being\nput off. He stared belligerently at the chief of this department.\n\n\"Power--hell!\" he said. \"We've got power now. How will you apply it? How\nwill we use it for travelling through space?\"\n\nThe great man of science was unmoved by the outburst. \"That is\npoppycock,\" he replied; \"the unscientific twaddle of the sensational\npress. We are practical men here; we are working to give you men who do\nthe fighting better ships and better arms. But you will use them right\nhere on Earth.\"\n\nThe calm assurance of this man who spoke with a voice of such confidence\nand authority left the flyer speechless. His brain sent a chaos of\nprofane and violent expletives to the lips that dared not frame them.\nThere was no adequate reply.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBlake jammed his hat upon his head and walked blindly from the room.\nHeedless of the protests of those he jostled on the street he went\nraging on, but some subconscious urge directed his steps. He found\nhimself at the railway. There was a station, and a grilled window where\nhe was asking for a ticket back to Washington. And on the following\nday--\n\n\"There is nothing I can do,\" he told General Clinton. \"It is hopeless. I\nask to be relieved.\"\n\n\"Why?\" The general snapped the question at him. What kind of man was\nthis that Boynton had sent him?\n\n\"They are fools,\" said Blake bluntly, \"pompous, well-meaning fools! They\nare planning better motors, more power\"--he laughed harshly--\"and they\nthink that with them we can attack ships that are independent of the\nair.\"\n\n\"Still,\" asked General Clinton coldly, \"for what purpose do you wish to\nbe relieved? What do you intend to do?\"\n\n\"Return to the field,\" said Captain Blake, \"to work, and put my planes\nand personnel in the best possible condition; then, when the time comes,\ngo up and fight like hell.\"\n\nAn unusual phrasing of a request when one is addressing one's commander;\nbut the older man threw back his shoulders, that were bending under\nresponsibilities too great for one man to bear, and took a long breath\nthat relaxed his face and seemed to bring relief.\n\n\"You've got the right idea,\"--he spoke slowly and thoughtfully--\"the\nright philosophy. It is all we have left--to fight like hell when the\ntime comes. Give my regards to Colonel Boynton; he sent me a good man\nafter all.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnother long flight, westward this time, and, despite the failure of his\nhopes and of his errand, Blake was flying with a mind at peace. \"It is\nall we have left,\" the general had said. Well, it was good to face\nfacts, to admit them--and that was that! There was no use of thinking or\nworrying.... He lifted the ship to a higher level and glanced at his\ncompass. There were clouds up ahead, and he drove still higher into the\nnight, until he was above them.\n\nAnd again his peace of mind was not to last.\n\nIt was night when he swung the ship over his home port and signalled for\na landing. A flood of light swept out across the field to guide him\ndown. He went directly to the colonel's quarters but found him gone.\n\n\"In the radio room, I think,\" an orderly told him.\n\nColonel Boynton was listening intently in the silent room; he scowled\nwith annoyance at the disturbance of Blake's coming; then, seeing who it\nwas, he motioned quickly for the captain to listen in.\n\n\"Good Lord, Blake,\" he told the captain in an excited whisper; \"I'm glad\nyou're here. Another ship had been sighted; she's been all over the\nearth; just scouting and mapping, probably. And there have been signals\nthe same as before--the same until just now. Listen!--it's talking\nMorse!--it's been calling for you!\"\n\nHe thrust a head set into Blake's hands, then reached for some papers.\n\"Poor reception, but there's what we've got,\" he said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe paper held the merest fragments of messages that the operator had\ndeciphered. Blake examined them curiously while he listened at the\nsilent receiver.\n\n\"Maricopa\"--the message, whatever it was, was meant for them, but there\nwere only parts of words and disjointed phrases that the man had written\ndown--\"Venus attacking Earth ... Captain Blake ... Sykes and....\"\n\nAt the name of Sykes, Blake dropped the paper.\n\n\"What does this mean?\" he demanded. \"Sykes!--why Sykes was the\nastronomer who was captured with McGuire!\"\n\n\"Listen! Listen!\" The colonel's voice was almost shrill with excitement.\n\nThe night was whispering faintly the merest echo of a signal from a\nstation far away, but it resolved itself into broken fragments of sound\nthat were long and short in duration, and the fragments joined to form\nletters in the Morse code.\n\n\"See Winslow,\" it told them, and repeated the message: \"See Winslow at\nSierra....\" Some distant storm crashed and rattled for breathless\nminutes. \"Blake see Winslow. This is McGuire, Blake. Winslow can\nhelp--\"\n\nThe message ended abruptly. One long, wailing note; then again the night\nwas voiceless ... and in the radio room at Maricopa Flying Field two men\nstood speechless, unbreathing, to stare at each other with incredulous\neyes, as might men who had seen a phantom--a ghost that spoke to them\nand called them by name.\n\n\"McGuire--is--alive!\" stammered Blake. \"They've taken him--there!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nColonel Boynton was considering, weighing all the possibilities, and his\nvoice, when he answered, had the ring of conviction.\n\n\"That was no hoax,\" he agreed; \"that quavering tone could never be\nfaked. That message was sent from the same station we heard before. Yes,\nMcGuire is alive--or was up to the end of that sending.... But, who the\ndevil is Winslow?\"\n\nBlake shook his head despairingly. \"I don't know,\" he said. \"And it\nseems as if I should--\"\n\nIt was hours later, far into the night, when he sprang from out of a\nhalf-conscious doze to find himself in the middle of the floor with the\nvoice of McGuire ringing clearly in his ears. A buried memory had\nreturned to the level of his conscious mind. He rushed over to the\ncolonel's quarters.\n\n\"I've got it,\" he shouted to that officer whose head was projecting from\nan upper window. \"I remember! McGuire told me about this Winslow--some\nhermit that he ran across. He has some invention--some machine--said he\nhad been to the moon. I always thought Mac half believed him. We'll go\nover Mac's things and find the address.\"\n\n\"Do you think--do you suppose--?\" began Colonel Boynton doubtfully.\n\n\"I don't dare to think,\" Blake responded. \"God only knows if we dare\nhope; but Mac--Mac's got a level head; he wouldn't send us unless he\nknew! Good Lord, man!\" he exclaimed, \"Mac radioed us from Venus; is\nthere anything impossible after that?\"\n\n\"Wait there,\" said Colonel Boynton; \"I'll be right down--\"\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nLieutenant McGuire awoke, as he had on other occasions, to the smell of\nsickly-sweet fumes and the stifling pressure of a mask held over his\nnose and mouth. He struggled to free himself, and the mask was removed.\nAnother of the man-creatures whom McGuire had not seen before helped him\nto sit up.\n\nA group of the attenuated figures, with their blood-and-ashes faces,\nregarded him curiously. The one who had helped him arise forced the\nothers to stand back, and he gave McGuire a drink of yellow fluid from a\ncrystal goblet. The dazed man gulped it down to feel a following surge\nof warmth and life that pulsed through his paralyzed body. The figures\nbefore him came sharply from the haze that had enveloped them. A window\nhigh above admitted a golden light that meant another day, but it\nbrought no cheer or encouragement to the flyer. McGuire felt crushed and\nhopeless in the knowledge that his life must still go on.\n\nIf only that sleep could have continued--carried him out to the deeper\nsleep of death! What hope for them here? Not a chance! And then he\nremembered Sykes; he mustn't desert Sykes. He looked about him to see\nthe same prison room from which he and Sykes had escaped. The body of\nthe scientist was motionless on the hammock-bed across the room; an\noccasional deep-drawn breath showed that the man still lived.\n\nNo, he must not leave Sykes, even if he had the means of death. They\nwould fight it through together, and perhaps--perhaps--they might yet be\nof service, might find some way to avert the catastrophe that threatened\ntheir world. Hopeless? Beyond doubt. But he must hope--and fight!\n\nThe leader had watched the light of understanding as it returned to the\nflyer's eyes. He motioned now to the others, and McGuire was picked up\nbodily by four of them and carried from the room.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMcGuire's mind was alert once more; he was eager to learn what he could\nof this place that was to be their prison, but he saw little. A glory of\nblending colors beyond, where the golden light from without shone\nthrough opal walls--then he found himself upon a narrow table where\nstraps of metal were thrown quickly about to bind him fast. He was tied\nhand and foot to the table that moved forward on smooth rollers to a\nwaiting lift.\n\nWhat next? he questioned. Not death, for they had been too careful to\nkeep him alive, these repulsive things that stared at him with such cold\nmalevolence. Then what? And McGuire found himself with unpleasant\nrecollections of others he had seen strapped in similar fashion to an\noperating table.\n\nThe lift that he had thought would rise fell smoothly, instead, to stop\nat some point far below ground where the table with its helpless burden\nwas rolled into a great room.\n\nHe could move his head, and McGuire turned and twisted to look at the\nmaze of instruments that filled the room--a super-laboratory for\nexperiments of which he dared not think.\n\n\"Whoever says I'm not scared to death is a liar,\" he whispered to\nhimself, but he continued to look and wonder as he was wheeled before a\ngleaming machine of many coils and shining, metal parts. A smooth sheet\nof metal stood vertically beyond him; painted a grayish-white, he saw;\nbut he could not imagine its use. A throng of people, seated in the\nroom, turned blood-red faces toward the bound man and the metal sheet.\n\n\"Looks as if we were about to put on a show of some kind,\" he told\nhimself, \"and I am cast for a leading role.\" He watched as best he could\nfrom his bound position while a tall figure in robes of lustreless black\nappeared to stand beside him.\n\nThe newcomer regarded him with a face that was devoid of all emotion.\nMcGuire felt the lack of the customary expression of hatred; there was\nnot even that; and he knew he was nothing more than a strange animal,\nbound, and helpless, ready for this weird creature's experiments. The\none in black held a pencil whose tip was a tiny, brilliant light.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAbruptly the room plunged to darkness, where the only visible thing was\nthis one point of light. Ceaselessly it waved back and forth before his\neyes; he followed it in a pattern of strange design; it approached and\nreceded. Again and again the motion was repeated, until McGuire felt\nhimself sinking--sinking--into a passive state of lethargy. His muscles\nrelaxed; his mind was at rest; there seemed nothing in the entire\nuniverse of being but the single point of light that drew him on and on\n... till something whispered from the far reaches of black space....\n\nIt came to him, an insistent call. It was asking about the earth--his\nown world. _What of Earth's armies and their means of defense?_ Vaguely\nhe sensed the demand, and without conscious volition he responded. He\npictured the world he had known; how plainly he saw the wide field at\nMaricopa, and the sweeping flight of a squadron of planes! _Yes--yes!\nHow high could they ascend?_ From one of the planes he saw the world\nbelow; the ships were near their ceiling; this was the limit of their\nclimb. _And did they fight with gas? What of their deadliness?_ And\nagain he was seated in a plane, and he was firing tiny bullets from a\ntiny gun. No. They did not use gas. _But on the ground below--what\nfortifications? What means of defense?_\n\nMcGuire's mind was no longer his own; he could only respond to that\ninvisible questioner, that insistent demand from out of the depths where\nhe was floating. And yet there was something within him that protested,\nthat clamored at his mind and brain.\n\nFortifications! They must know about fortifications--anti-aircraft\nguns--means for combatting aerial attack. Yes, he knew, and he must\nexplain--and the thing within him pounded in the back of his brain to\ndraw him back to himself.\n\nHe saw a battery of anti-aircraft guns in operation; the guns were\nfiring; shells were bursting in little plumes of smoke high in the air.\nAnd that self within him was shouting now, hammering at him; \"You are\nseeing it,\" it told him; \"it is there before you on the screen. Stop!\nStop!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd for an instant McGuire had the strange experience of witnessing his\nown thoughts. Memories, mental records of past experience, were flashing\nthrough his mind; mock battles, and the batteries were firing! And,\nbefore him, on the metal screen, there glowed a vivid picture of the\nsame thing. Men were serving the guns with sure swiftness; the bursts\nwere high in the air--in a flash of understanding Lieutenant McGuire\nknew that he was giving his country's secrets to the enemy. And in that\nsame instant he felt himself swept upward from the depths of that\ndarkness where he had drifted. He was himself again, bound and helpless\nbefore an infernal contrivance of these devil-creatures. They had read\nhis thoughts; the machine beside him had projected them upon the screen\nfor all to see; a steady clicking might mean their reproduction in\nmotion pictures for later study! He, Lieutenant McGuire, was a traitor\nagainst his will!\n\nThe screen was blank, and the lights of the room came on to show the\nthin lips that smiled complacently in a cruel and evil face.\n\nMcGuire glared back into that face, and he tried with all the mental\nforce that he could concentrate to get across to the exultant one the\nfact that they had not wholly conquered him. This much they had got--but\nno more!\n\nThe thin-lipped one had an instrument in his hand, and McGuire felt the\nprick of a needle plunged into his arm. He tried to move his head and\nfound himself powerless. And now, in the darkness of the room where all\nlights were again extinguished, the helpless man was fighting the most\nhorrible of battles, and the battleground was within his own mind. He\nwas two selves, and he fought and struggled with all his consciousness\nto keep those memories from flooding him.\n\nWith one part of himself he knew what it meant: a sure knowledge given\nthese invaders of what they must prepare to meet; he was betraying his\ncountry; the whole of humanity! And that raging, raving self was\npowerless to check the flow of memory pictures that went endlessly\nthrough his mind and out upon the screen beyond....\n\nHe had no sense of time; he was limp and exhausted with his fruitless\nstruggle when he felt himself released from the bondage of the metal\nstraps and placed again in the hammock in his room. And he could only\nlook wanly and hopelessly after the figure of Professor Sykes, carried\nby barbarous figures to the same ordeal.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSleep, through the long night, restored both McGuire and his companion\nto normal strength. The flyer was seated with his head bowed low in his\ncupped hands. His words seemed wrung from an agony of spirit. \"So that's\nwhat they brought us here for,\" he said harshly; \"that's why they're\nkeeping us alive!\"\n\nProfessor Sykes walked back and forth in their bare room while he shook\nhis impotent fists in the air.\n\n\"I told them everything,\" he exploded; \"everything!\" Their astronomical\nknowledge must be limited; under this blanket of clouds they can see\nnothing, and from their ships they could make approximations only.\n\n\"And I have told them--the earth, and its days and seasons--its orbital\nvelocity and motion--its relation to the orbit of this accursed planet.\nThey had documents from the observatory and I explained them; I\ncorrected their time of firing their big gun on its equatorial position.\nOh, there is little I left untold--damn them!\"\n\n\"I wish to heaven,\" said the flyer savagely, \"that we had known; we\nwould have jumped out of their beastly ship somehow ten thousand feet\nup, and we would have taken our information with us.\"\n\nSykes nodded agreement. \"Well,\" he asked, \"how about to-morrow, and the\nnext day, and the next? They will want more facts; they will pump the\nlast drop of information from us. Are we going to allow it?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMcGuire's tone was dry. \"You know the answer to that as well as I do. We\nhave just two alternatives; either we get out of here--find some place\nto hide in, then find some way to put a crimp in their plans; or we get\nout of here for good. It's twenty feet, not twenty thousand, from that\nwindow to the ground, but I think a head-first dive would do it.\"\n\nSykes did not reply at once; he seemed to be weighing some problem in\nhis mind.\n\n\"I would prefer the water,\" he said at last. \"If we _can_ get away and\nreach the shore, and if there is not a possibility of escape--which I\nmust admit I consider highly improbable--well, we can always swim out as\nfar as we can go, and the result will be certain.\n\n\"This other is so messy.\" The man had stopped his ceaseless pacing, and\nhe even managed a cheerful smile at the lieutenant. \"And, remember, it\nmight only cripple us and leave us helpless in their hands.\"\n\n\"Sounds all right to me,\" McGuire agreed, and there was a tone of\nfinality in his voice as he added: \"They've made us do that traitor act\nfor the last time, anyway.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDaylight comes slowly through cloud-filled skies; the window of the\nroom where the fountain sprayed ceaselessly was showing the first hint\nof gold in the eastern sky. Above was the utter darkness of the\ncloud-wrapped night as the two men swung noiselessly out into the\ngrotesque branches of a tree to make their way into the gloom below.\nThere, under the cover of great leaves, they crouched in silence, while\nthe darkness about them faded and a sound of subdued whistling noises\ncame to them from the night.\n\nA wheel creaked, and in the dim light two figures appeared tugging at a\ncart upon which was a cage of woven wire. Beyond them, against the\ndarker background of denser growth, tentacles coiled and twisted above\nthe row of guardian plants that surrounded the house.\n\nOne of the ghostly forms reached within the cage and brought forth a\nstruggling object that whimpered in fear. The low whine came distinctly\nto the hidden men. They saw a vague black thing tossed through the air\nand toward the deadly plants; they heard the swishing of pliant\ntentacles and the yelping cry of a frightened animal. And the cry rose\nto a shriek that ended with the gulping splash of thick liquid.\n\nThe giant pod next in line was open--they could see it dimly--and its\ntentacles were writhing convulsively, hungrily, across the ground.\nAnother animal was taken from the cage and thrown to the waiting,\nserpent forms that closed about and whirled it high in air. Another--and\nanother! The yelps of terror grew faint in the distance as the monsters\npassed on in their gruesome work. And the two men, palpitant with\nmemories of their own experience, were limp and sick with horror.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the growing light they saw more plainly the fleshy, pliant arms that\nwhipped through the air or felt searchingly along the ground. No hope\nthere for bird or beast that passed by in the night; nor for men, as\nthey knew too well. But now, as the golden light increased, the arms\ndrew back to form again the tight-wound coils that flattened themselves\nbeside the monstrous pods whose lips were closing. Locked within them\nwere the pools of liquid that could dissolve a living body into food for\nthese vampires of the vegetable world.\n\n\"Damnable!\" breathed Sykes in a savage whisper. \"Utterly damnable! And\nthis world is peopled with such monsters!\"\n\nThe last deadly arm was tightly coiled when the men stole off through\nthe lush growth that reached even above their heads. McGuire remembered\nthe outlines he had seen from the air and led the way where, if no\nbetter concealment could be found, the ocean waited with promise of rest\nand release from their inhuman captors.\n\nThey counted on an hour's start--it would be that long before their\njailer would come with their morning meal and give the alarm--and now\nthey went swiftly and silently through the stillness of a strange world.\nThe air that flicked misty-wet across their faces was heavy and heady\nwith the perfume of night-blooming plants. Crimson blossoms flung wide\ntheir odorous petals, and the first golden light was filtered through\ntremendous tree-growths of pale lavenders and grays to show as unreal\ncolors in the vegetation close about them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey found no guards; the isolation of this island made the land itself\ntheir prison, and the men ran at full speed through every open space,\nknowing as they ran that there was no refuge for them--only the ocean\nwaiting at the last. But their flight was not unobserved.\n\nA great bird rose screaming from a tangle of vines; its heavy, flapping\nwings flashed red against the pale trees. A pandemonium of shrieking\ncries echoed its alarm as other birds took flight; the forest about them\nwas in an uproar of harsh cries. And faintly, from far in the rear, came\na babel of shrill calls--weird, inhuman!--the voices of the men-things\nof Venus.\n\n\"It's all off,\" said McGuire sharply; \"they'll be on our trail now!\" He\nplunged through where the trees were more open, and Sykes was beside him\nas they ran with a burst of speed toward a hilltop beyond.\n\nThey paused, panting, upon the crest. A wide expanse of foliage in\ndelicate shadings swept out before them to wave gently in a sea of color\nunder the morning breeze, and beyond was another sea that beckoned with\nwhite breakers on a rocky shore.\n\n\"The ocean!\" gasped Sykes, and pointed a trembling hand toward their\ngoal. \"But--I had no idea--that suicide--was--such hard work!\"\n\nThe tall figure of Lieutenant McGuire turned to the shorter, breathless\nman, and he gripped hard at one of his hands.\n\n\"Sykes,\" he said, \"I'll never get another chance to say it--but you're\none good scout!... Come on!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMcGuire fought to force his way through jungle growth, while screaming\nbirds marked where they went. The sounds of their pursuers were close\nbehind them when the two tore their way through the last snarled tangle\nof pale vine to stand on a sheer bluff, where, below, deep waters\ncrashed against a rocky wall. They staggered with weariness and gulped\nsobbingly of the morning air. McGuire could have sworn he was exhausted\nbeyond any further effort, yet from somewhere he summoned energy to\nspring savagely upon a tall, blood-red figure whose purpling face rose\nsuddenly to confront them.\n\nOne hand closed upon the metal tube that the other hand raised, and,\nwith his final reserve of strength, the flyer wrapped an arm about the\ntall body and rushed it stumblingly toward the cliff. To be balked\nnow!--to be brought back to that intolerable prison and the unthinkable\nrole of traitor! The khaki-clad figure wrenched furiously at the deadly\ntube as they struggled and swayed on the edge of the cliff.\n\nHe freed his arm quickly, and, regardless of the clawing thing that tore\nat his face and eyes, he launched one long swing for the horrible face\nabove him. He saw the awkward fall of a lean body, and he swayed\nhelplessly out to follow when the grip of Sykes' hand pulled him back\nand up to momentary safety.\n\nMcGuire's mind held only the desire to kill, and he would have begun a\nstaggering rush toward the shrieking mob that broke from the cover\nbehind them, had not Sykes held him fast. At sight of the weapon, their\nown gas projector, still clutched in the flyer's hand, the pursuers\nhalted. Their long arms pointed and their shrill calls joined in a\nchorus that quavered and fell uncertainly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOne, braver than the rest, dashed forward and discharged his weapon. The\nspurting gas failed to reach its intended victims; it blew gently back\ntoward the others who fled quickly to either side. Above the trees a\ngiant ship nosed swiftly down, and McGuire pointed to it grimly and in\nsilence. The men before them were massed now for a rush.\n\n\"This is the end,\" said the flyer softly. \"I wonder how this devilish\nthing works; there's a trigger here. I will give them a shot with the\nwind helping, then we'll jump for it.\"\n\nThe ship was above them as the slim figure of Lieutenant McGuire threw\nitself a score of paces toward the waiting group. From the metal tube\nthere shot a stream of pale vapor that swept downward upon the others\nwho ran in panic from its touch.\n\nThen back--and a grip of a hand!--and two Earth-men who threw themselves\nout and downward from a sheer rock wall to the cool embrace of deep\nwater.\n\nThey came to the top, battered from their fall, but able to dive under a\nwave and emerge again near one another.\n\n\"Swim!\" urged Sykes. \"Swim out! They may get us here--recover our\nbodies--resuscitate us. And that wouldn't do!\"\n\nAnother wave, and the two men were swimming beyond it; swimming feebly\nbut steadily out from shore, while above them a great cylinder of\nshining metal swept past in a circling flight. They kept on while their\neyes, from the wave tops, saw it turn and come slowly back in a long\nsmooth descent.\n\nIt was a hundred feet above the water a short way out at sea, and the\ntwo men made feeble motions with arms and legs, while their eyes\nexchanged glances of dismay.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA door had opened in the round under-surface, and a figure, whose\ngas-suit made it a bloated caricature of a man, was lowered from beneath\nin a sling. From the stern of the ship gaseous vapor belched downward to\nspread upon the surface of the water. The wind was bringing the misty\ncloud toward them. \"The gas!\" said McGuire despairingly. \"It will knock\nus out, and then that devil will get us! They'll take us back! Our last\nchance--gone!\"\n\n\"God help us!\" said Sykes weakly. \"We can't--even--die--\" His feeble\nstrokes stopped, and he sank beneath the water. McGuire's last picture\nas he too sank and the waters closed over his head, was the shining ship\nhovering beyond.\n\nHe wondered only vaguely at the sudden whirling of water around him. A\nsolid something was rising beneath his dragging feet; a firm, solid\nsupport that raised him again to the surface. He realized dimly the air\nabout him, the sodden form of Professor Sykes some few feet distant. His\nnumbed brain was trying to comprehend what else the eyes beheld.\n\nA metal surface beneath them rose higher, shining wet, above the water;\na metal tube raised suddenly from its shield, to swing in quick aim upon\nthe enemy ship approaching from above.\n\nHis eyes moved to the ship, and to the man-thing below in the sling. Its\nclothes were a mass of flame, and the figure itself was falling headlong\nthrough the air. Above the blazing body was the metal of the ship\nitself, and it sagged and melted to a liquid fire that poured, splashing\nand hissing, to the waters beneath. In the wild panic the great shape\nthrew itself into the air; it swept out and up in curving flight to\nplunge headlong into the depths....\n\nThe gas was drifting close, as McGuire saw an opening in the structure\nbeside him. The voice of a man, human, kindly, befriending, said\nsomething of \"hurry\" and \"gas,\" and \"lift them carefully but make\nhaste.\" The white faces of men were blurred and indistinct as McGuire\nfelt himself lowered into a cool room and laid, with the unconscious\nform of Sykes, upon a floor.\n\nHe tried to remember. He had gone down in the water--Sykes had drowned,\nand he himself--he was tired--tired. \"And this,\"--the thought seemed a\ncertainty in his mind--\"this is death. How--very--peculiar--\" He was\ntrying to twist his lips to a weak laugh as the lighted ports in the\nwall beside him changed from gold to green, then black--and a rushing of\ntorn waters was in his ears....\n\n(_To be continued_)\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n  ASTOUNDING STORIES\n  _Appears on Newsstands_\n  THE FIRST THURSDAY IN EACH MONTH\n\n\n\n\nThe Sea Terror\n\n_By Captain S. P. Meek_\n\n  The trail of mystery gold leads Carnes and Dr. Bird to a\n  tremendous monster of the deep.\n\n[Illustration: \"_The mass hung over the ship._\"]\n\n\n\"I beg your pardon, sir. I'm looking for Dr. Bird.\"\n\nThe famous Bureau of Standards scientist appraised the speaker rapidly.\nKeen blue eyes stared questioningly at him from a mahogany brown face,\ncriss-crossed with a thousand tiny wrinkles. The tattooed anchor on his\nhand and the ill-fitting blue serge suit smacked of the sea while the\nsquareness of his shoulders and the direct gaze of his eye spoke\neloquently of authority.\n\n\"I'm Dr. Bird, Captain. What can I do for you?\"\n\n\"Thank you, Doctor, but I'm not a captain. My name is Mitchell and I am,\nor was, the first mate of the _Arethusa_.\"\n\n\"The _Arethusa_!\" Operative Carnes of the United States Secret Service\nsprang to his feet. \"You said the _Arethusa_? There _were_ no\nsurvivors!\"\n\n\"I believe that I am the only one.\"\n\n\"Where have you been hiding and why haven't you reported the fact of\nyour rescue to the proper authorities? Tell the truth; I'm a federal\nofficer!\"\n\nCarnes flashed the gold badge of the Secret Service and an expression of\nanger crossed Mitchell's face.\n\n\"If I had wished to talk to an officer I could have found plenty in New\nYork,\" he said shortly. \"I came to Washington in order to tell my story\nto Dr. Bird.\"\n\nThe seaman and the detective glared at one another for a moment and then\nDr. Bird intervened.\n\n\"Pipe down, Carnes,\" he said softly. \"Mr. Mitchell undoubtedly has\nreasons, excellent reasons, for his actions. Sit down, Mr. Mitchell, and\nhave a cigar.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMitchell accepted the cigar which the doctor proferred and took a chair.\nHe lighted the weed and after another glance of hostility toward the\ndetective he pointedly ignored him and addressed his remarks to Dr.\nBird.\n\n\"I have no objection to telling you why I haven't spoken earlier,\nDoctor,\" he said. \"When the _Arethusa_ sank, I must have hit my head on\nsomething, for the next thing I knew, I was in the Marine Hospital in\nNew York. I had been picked up unconscious by a fishing boat and brought\nin, and I lay there a week before I knew anything. When I knew what I\nwas doing I heard about the loss of my ship and was told that there were\nno survivors, and I didn't know what to do. The story I had to tell was\nso weird and improbable that I hesitated to speak to anyone about it. I\nwas not sure at first that it was not a trick of a disordered brain, but\nsince my head has cleared I am convinced of the truth of it ... and yet\nI know that it _can't_ be so. I have read about you and some of the\nthings you have done, and so as soon as I was able to travel I came\nhere to tell you about it. You will be better able to judge than I,\nwhether what I tell you really happened or was only a vision.\"\n\nDr. Bird leaned back in his chair and put the tips of his fingers\ntogether. Long, tapering fingers they were, sensitive and well shaped,\nthough sadly marred by acid stains. It was in his hands alone that Dr.\nBird showed the genius in his make-up, the artistry which inspired him\nto produce those miracles of experimentation which had made his name a\nhousehold word in the realm of science. Aside from those hands he more\nresembled a pugilist than a scientist. A heavy shock of unruly black\nhair surmounted a face with beetling black brows and a prognathous jaw.\nHis enormous head, with a breadth and height of forehead which were\namazing, rose from a pillar-like neck which sprang from a pair of\nmassive shoulders and the arching chest of the trained athlete. Dr. Bird\nstood six feet two inches in his socks, and weighed over two hundred\nstripped. As he leaned back a curious glitter, which Carnes had learned\nto associate with keen interest, showed for an instant in his eyes.\n\n\"I will be glad to hear your story, Mr. Mitchell,\" he said softly. \"Tell\nit in your own way and try not to omit any detail, no matter how trivial\nit may be.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe seaman nodded and sat silent for a moment as though marshaling his\nthoughts.\n\n\"The story really starts the afternoon of May 12th,\" he said, \"although\nI didn't realize the importance of the first incident at the time. We\nwere steaming along at good speed, hoping to make New York before too\nlate for quarantine, when a hail came from the forward lookout. I was on\nwatch and I went forward to see what was the matter. The lookout was\nLouis Green, an able bodied seaman and a good one, but a confirmed\ndrunkard. I asked him what the trouble was and he turned toward me a\nface that was haggard with terror.\n\n\"'I've seen a sea serpent, Mr. Mitchell,' he said.\n\n\"'Nonsense!' I replied sharply. 'You've been drinking again.'\n\n\"He swore that he hadn't and I asked him to describe what he had seen.\nHis teeth were chattering so that he could hardly speak, but he gasped\nout a story about seeing a monstrous head, a half mile across, he said,\nwith a long snake body stretching out over the sea until the end of it\nwas lost on the horizon. I turned my glass in the direction he pointed\nand of course there was nothing to be seen. The man's condition was such\nas to make him worse than useless as a lookout, so I relieved him and\nordered him below. I took it for a touch of delirium tremens.\n\n\"We were bucking a head wind, although not a very stiff one, and we\ndidn't make port until after dark, so we anchored at quarantine, just\noff Staten Island, in forty fathoms of water, and Captain Murphy radioed\nfor a Coast Guard boat to come out and lay by us for the night. As you\nhave probably heard, we were carrying four millions in bar gold\nconsigned to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York from the Bank of\nEngland.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDr. Bird and Carnes nodded. The inexplicable loss of the _Arethusa_ had\noccupied much space in the papers ten days earlier.\n\n\"The cutter came out, signalled, and dropped anchor about three hundred\nyards away. So far, everything was exactly as it should be. I walked to\nthe stern of the boat and looked out across the Atlantic and then I\nrealized that Green wasn't the only one who could see things. The wind\nhad fallen and it was getting pretty dark, but not too dark to see\nthings a pretty good distance away. As I looked I saw, or thought I saw,\na huge black leathery mass come to the surface a mile or so away. There\nwere two things on it that looked like eyes, and I had a feeling as\nthough some malignant thing was staring at me. I rubbed my eyes and\nlooked again, but the vision persisted, and I went forward to get a\nglass. When I came back the thing, whatever it was, had disappeared, but\nthe water where it had been was boiling as though there were a great\nspring or something of the sort under the surface.\n\n\"I trained my glass on the disturbed area, and I will take my oath\nthat I saw a huge body like a snake emerge from the water. It lay in\nlong undulations on the waves, and moved with them as though it were\nfloating. It was quite a bit nearer than the first thing had been and\nI could see it plainly with the glass. I would judge it to be fifteen\nor twenty feet thick, and it actually seemed to disappear in the\ndistance as Green had described it. The sight of the thing sent shivers\nup and down my spine, and I gave a hoarse shout. The lookout hurried\nto my side and asked me what the trouble was. I pointed and handed\nhim the glass. He looked through it and handed it back to me with a\ncurious expression.\n\n\"'I can't see nothing, sir,' he said.\n\n\"I took the glass from him and tried to level it but my hands were\ntrembling so that I was forced to rest it on the rail. The lookout was\nright. There was absolutely nothing to be seen and the peculiar\nappearance of the sea had subsided to normal. The lookout was staring at\nme rather curiously and I knew that he was thinking the same thing about\nme as I had thought about Green in the afternoon. I made some kind of an\nexcuse and went below to pull myself together. I caught a glimpse of\nmyself in the glass. I was as white as a sheet, and the sweat was\nrunning off my face in drops.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I shook myself together after a fashion and managed to persuade myself\nthat the whole thing was just a trick of my mind, inspired by Green's\nvivid description of his delirious vision of the afternoon. Eight bells\nstruck, and when Mr. Fulton, the junior officer, relieved me, I laid\ndown and tried to quiet myself. I didn't have much luck. Just before I\ntook the deck again at midnight I slipped down to the forecastle to see\nhow Green was coming along. He was lying in his bunk, wide awake, with\nstaring eyes.\n\n\"'How are you feeling now, Green?' I asked.\n\n\"He looked up at me with an expression of a man who has looked death in\nthe face.\n\n\"'Ain't there no chance of dockin' to-night, Mr. Mitchell?' he asked.\n\n\"'Of course not,' I said rather sharply. 'What's the matter with you?\nAre you afraid your sea serpent will get us?'\n\n\"'He'll get us if we stay out here to-night, sir,' he replied with an\nair of conviction. 'I saw the horrible mouth on him, large enough to\nbite this ship in half; and it had a beak like a bird, like a bloody\nparrot, sir. I saw its horrible body, too, with great black ulcers on\nthe under side of it where the sharks had been after it. For all the\nshark takes a man now and then, he's the seaman's friend, sir, because\nhe kills off the sea serpents who would take ship and all.'\n\n\"'Nonsense, Green!' I said sharply. 'Don't talk any more such\nfoolishness or I'll have you ironed. You've been drinking so much that\nyou are seeing things, and I won't have the crew disturbed by your crazy\ntalk.'\n\n\"'You won't think it's talk when those big eyes stare into yours\nto-night, Mr. Mitchell, and that body twists around you and squeezes the\nlife out of you. I don't care whether you iron me or not; I know that\nI'm doomed and so is everyone else; but I won't talk about it, sir. The\ncrew might as well rest easy while they can, for there's no escape if we\nhave to stay out here to-night.'\n\n\"'Well, be sure you keep a tight mouth then,' I said, and left rather\nhurriedly. I was in a cold sweat, for his air of conviction, together\nwith what I had seen, had shaken me pretty badly. I heard the watch\nchanging up above, and knew there would be men in the forecastle in a\nminute. I didn't want to face them right then.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Mr. Fulton reported everything quiet when I went on deck to relieve\nhim, and although I surveyed the water through a night glass for as far\nas I could see, there was nothing out of the way. The Coast Guard's\nlights were shining less than a quarter of a mile away, and things\nlooked peaceful enough. The wind had gone down with the sun; the sea was\nalmost glassy, and there was a bright moon.\n\n\"After going around the ship, I relieved all of the watch except two men\nfor lookouts, and sent them below to get a good night's sleep. If I\nhadn't done that, some of them might be alive now.\n\n\"I paced the deck for an hour trying to quiet my nerves, but really\ngetting more nervous every minute. Three bells struck and I walked\nforward and leaned on the rail to watch the water. I saw a peculiar\nswirl as though some large body were coming to the surface from below,\nand then I saw--it.\n\n\"Dr. Bird, I take a drink once in a while when I am on shore, but never\nat sea and never in excess, and I know it wasn't a vision of drink\ndelirium. I felt perfectly normal aside from my nervousness, and I don't\nthink it was fever. Either I saw it or I am insane, for it is as vivid\nto me as though I were standing on the _Arethusa's_ deck and that\nmonstrous horror was rising once more before my eyes.\"\n\nThe seaman's face had become drawn and white as he talked, and drops of\nsweat were trickling from his chin. Carnes sat forward absorbed in his\nnarrative while Dr. Bird sat back with a glitter in his black eyes and\nan expression of great attention on his face.\n\n\"Go on, Mr. Mitchell,\" the doctor said soothingly. \"Tell me just what\nyou saw.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMitchell shuddered and glanced quickly around the laboratory as though\nto assure himself that he was safe within four walls.\n\n\"From the surface of the sea,\" he went on, \"rose a massive body, black,\nand of the appearance of wet leather. It must have been a couple of\nhundred yards across, although the size of objects is often magnified by\nmoonlight and my terror may have added to its size. In the midst of it\nwere two great discs, thirty feet across, which glowed red with the\nreflected moonlight. It stared for a moment and then rose higher until\nit towered above the ship; and then I saw, or thought I saw, a huge\ngaping beak like a parrot's. It was as Green had described it, large\nenough to bite the _Arethusa_ in half, and she was a ship of three\nthousand tons.\n\n\"I was frozen with horror and couldn't move or cry out. As I watched, I\nsaw the long snake-like body emerge from the water, and the estimate I\nhad made of the size in the afternoon seemed pitifully inadequate.\nPresently a second and a third snake arose from the water, and then\nmore, until the whole sea and the air above it seemed a writhing mass of\nhuge snakes. I remember wondering why the watch of the Coast Guard\ncutter didn't sound an alarm, and then I realized that the thing had\narisen on our port side and the cutter was on the starboard.\n\n\"The mass of snakes writhed backward and forward, and then two of them\nrose in the air and hung over the ship. I could see the under side and I\nsaw what Green had called the scars where the sharks had attacked. They\nwere great cup-shaped depressions with vile white edges, and they did\nresemble huge sores or ulcers. They wavered over the ship for an\ninstant, and then both of them dropped down on the deck.\n\n\"I found my voice and I think that I gave a yell, but even as I opened\nmy mouth, I realized the futility of it. The _Arethusa_ was sucked down\ninto the sea as though it had been a tiny chip. I saw the water rising\nto the rail, and I think I cried out again. The ship tilted and I felt\nmyself falling. The next thing I knew was when I was in the hospital and\nwas told that I had been raving for a week. I was afraid to tell my\nstory for fear I would be put in an asylum, so I kept a tight tongue in\nmy head until I was discharged.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDr. Bird mused for a moment as the seaman's voice stopped.\n\n\"You cried out all right, Mr. Mitchell,\" he said. \"You gave two distinct\nshouts, both of which were heard by the watch on the _Wren_, the Coast\nGuard cutter. They reported that at 1:30, the _Arethusa_ sank without\nwarning. As soon as he heard your shouts, the watch gave the alarm and\nthe crew piled on deck. The _Arethusa_ was gone completely and the\n_Wren_ was tossing about like 'a chip in a whirlpool' as they\ngraphically described it. The _Wren_ had steam up and they fought the\nwaves and steamed over your anchoring ground looking for survivors, but\nthey found none. The sea gradually subsided and they did the only thing\nthey could do--dropped a buoy, to guide the salvage people, and radioed\nfor assistance. The _Robin_ came out and joined them, and both cutters\nstood by until daylight, but nothing unusual was seen. The insurance\npeople are trying to salvage the wreck now, but so far they have made\nlittle headway.\"\n\n\"That brings me to the rest of the story, the part that made me decide\nto come to you, Doctor,\" said the seaman. \"Did you see what happened to\nthe divers yesterday?\"\n\nDr. Bird nodded.\n\n\"I saw a brief account of it,\" he said. \"It seems that two of them were\nlost through their lines getting fouled and their air connections\nsevered in some way. I don't believe the bodies have been recovered\nyet.\"\n\n\"They never will be recovered, Doctor. I was discharged from the\nhospital yesterday and the papers were just out with an account of it. I\nwent down to the dock where the _John MacLean_, the salvage ship, ties\nup, and I talked to Captain Starley who commands it. I have known him\ncasually for some years, although not intimately, and he gave me a few\nmore details than the press got. He didn't connect me up at first with\nthe Mitchell who was reported lost on the _Arethusa_.\n\n\"The first man to go down from the _MacLean_ was Charley Melrose, an\nexpert diver. He went down in a pressure outfit to the bottom and\nstarted to work. Everything was going along fine until the telephone\nsuddenly rang and the man who answered it heard him say, 'Raise me, for\nGod's sake! Hurry!' The signal for raising was given, but they hadn't\ngot him more than thirty feet from the bottom before there came a tug on\nthe line and he was gone! The air line, the lifting cable and the\ntelephone cord floated free and were reeled in. Melrose had been plucked\noff the end of that line as you or I would pluck off a grape.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDr. Bird leaned forward with the curious glitter again in his eye.\n\n\"Go on,\" he said tersely.\n\n\"Blake, the other diver, donned a suit and insisted on being lowered at\nonce. Starley tried to dissuade him but he insisted on going down. They\nlowered him over the side with a twelve-foot steel-shod pike in his\nhand. He never got to the bottom. He had not been lowered more than a\nhundred feet when a scream came over the telephone, and again there was\na jerk on the lines which threatened to wreck the reel--and the line\ncame aboard with no diver on the end of it. At the same time, Starley\ntold me, the sea boiled and churned as though the whole bottom were\ncoming up, and his ship was tossed about as though it were in a violent\nstorm, although it was calm enough for forty fathom salvage work and\nthat is pretty quiet, you know. Half the time his screws were out of\nwater and he had a hard time to keep from being capsized. He fought his\nway out of the disturbed area, and as soon as he did, it started to\nquiet down, and in ten minutes it was calm again.\n\n\"Starley was pretty badly shaken and besides he had lost both of his\ndivers, so he came in and I saw him at the dock. When I heard his yarn,\nI took him into my confidence and told him what I had seen and that I\nproposed coming to you and asking your advice. I was afraid until I\nheard his story that it was merely a vision that I had had, but it\ncertainly was no vision that plucked those two divers off their lines.\"\n\n\"Has Captain Starley told that story to anyone else yet?\"\n\n\"No, Doctor, he hasn't. He promised not to talk until after I had seen\nyou. I'll vouch for him; he'll keep his word through anything; and he is\nkeeping his whole crew on board until he hears from me.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDr. Bird sprang to his feet.\n\n\"Mr. Mitchell,\" he said energetically, \"you have shown excellent\njudgment. Wire Captain Starley that you have seen me and that he is to\nhold his crew on board and to talk to no one until I get there. Carnes,\ntelephone the Chief of Naval Operations and ask him to receive me in\nconference at once. Have him get the Secretary of the Navy in, too, if\nhe is available. When you have finished that, telephone Bolton that you\nwill be away from Washington indefinitely.\"\n\n\"I'll telephone Admiral Buck for you, Doctor, but I don't dare telephone\nany such message to Bolton; he'd take my head off. He has been running\nthe whole service ragged lately, and this is my first afternoon off duty\nin a fortnight.\"\n\n\"What's the trouble, a flood of new counterfeits?\"\n\n\"No, the counterfeit division is getting along all right. In point of\nfact, they have lent us a dozen men. The trouble is a sudden big\nincrease in Communist activity throughout the country, with the Young\nLabor party behind it. Bolton has been pretty jumpy since that Stokowski\naffair last August and he is afraid of another attempt of some sort on\nthe President.\"\n\n\"The Young Labor party? I thought that gang was bankrupt and out of\nbusiness, since the Coast Guard broke up their alien smuggling scheme.\"\n\n\"They were down and out for a while, but they are in funds again--and\nhow! They must have three or four millions at least.\"\n\n\"Where did they get it?\"\n\n\"That's what we have been trying to find out. The leaders have presented\nbars of gold to a dozen banks throughout the country and demanded\nspecie. The banks shipped the gold to the mint and it was good gold,\nnine hundred and twenty-five fine. What we are trying to find out is how\nthat gold got into the United States.\"\n\n\"A shipment of that size should be easy to trace.\"\n\n\"It would seem so, but it hasn't been. We have accounted for every pound\nof every shipment that has come in through a port of entry, and we have\nchecked almost that close on the output of every mine in the United\nStates. If the gold came from Russia, it would have had to cross Europe,\nand we can't get any trace of it from abroad. It looks as though they\nwere _making_ it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDr. Bird rubbed his head thoughtfully.\n\n\"Possible, but hardly probable,\" he said. \"How much did you say they\nhad?\"\n\n\"Over three millions in thirty-pound bars. Each bar shows signs of\nhaving a mint mark chiselled off, but that don't help much for they have\ndone too good a job. It has us pretty well bluffed.\"\n\nAgain Dr. Bird rubbed his head.\n\n\"Telephone Admiral Buck, and then phone Bolton and tell him exactly what\nI told you to: that you will be away indefinitely. When he gets through\nexploding, tell him that you are going with me and that possibly, just\nbarely possibly, we might be on the trail of that gold shipment.\"\n\n\"On the trail of the gold!\" gasped Carnes. \"Surely, Doctor, you don't\nthink--\"\n\n\"Once in a while, old dear,\" replied the Doctor with a chuckle, \"which\nis more than anyone in the Secret Service does. You might tell Bolton\nthat I said that, but hang up quickly if you do. I don't want the wires\nof my telephone melted off. No, Carnesy, I have no miraculous\ninspiration as to where that gold is coming from; I just have a plain\nold-fashioned hunch, and that hunch is that we are going to have lots of\nfun and more than our share of danger before we see Washington again.\nAfter you get through bearding Bolton in his den, you might call the\nChief of the Air Corps and ask him to have a bomber held at Langley\nField subject to my orders. If he squawks any, I'll talk to him.\"\n\nHe turned to a telephone which stood on his desk and lifted the\nreceiver.\n\n\"Get Mr. Lambertson on the wire,\" he said. \"He is the chief technician\nof the Pyrex Glass Works at Corning, New Jersey.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe _U.S.S. Minneconsin_ steamed out of New York harbor and headed down\ntoward the lower bay. On her forward deck rested a huge globe. The\nbottom quarter of the sphere was made of some dark opaque substance but\nthe upper portion was transparent as crystal. Through the walls could be\nseen a quantity of apparatus resting on the opaque bottom portion. Two\nmechanics from the Bureau of Standards were making final adjustments of\none of the pieces of apparatus, which resembled a tank fitted with a\npiston geared to an electric motor. From the tank, tubes ran to four\nhollow pipes, an inch and a half in diameter, which ran through the skin\nand extended thirty inches from the outer skin of the twenty-foot\nsphere. Dr. Bird stood near talking with the executive officer of the\nship and from time to time giving a brief word of direction to the\nmechanics.\n\n\"It's safer than you might think, Commander,\" he said. \"In the first\nplace, that globe is not made of ordinary glass; it is made of\nvitrilene, a new semi-malleable glass which was developed at the Bureau\nand which is being made on an experimental scale for us by the Pyrex\npeople. It is much stronger than ordinary glass, and is not sensitive to\nshock. It is also perfectly transparent to ultra-violet light, being\nsuperior even to rock crystal or fused quartz in that respect. The\nwalls, as you have noticed, are four inches thick, and I have calculated\nthat the ball will stand a uniform external pressure of thirty-five\nhundred atmospheres, the pressure which would be encountered at a depth\nof about twenty miles. I believe that it will stand a squeeze of six\nthousand tons without buckling, and it is impossible to fracture it by\nshock. It could be dropped from the top of the Woolworth Building, and\nit would just bounce.\"\n\n\"It seems incredible that it could stand such a pressure as you have\nnamed.\"\n\n\"My figures are conservative ones. Lambertson calculated them even\nhigher, but we allowed for the fact that this is the first large mass of\nthe material to be cast, and lowered them.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"But suppose your lifting cable should break?\" objected the naval\nofficer. \"The outfit weighs a good many tons.\"\n\n\"You notice that the lower quarter is made of lead. The specific gravity\nof the entire globe when sealed up tight with two men in it is only a\nlittle more than unity. In the water its weight is so little that a\nthree-inch manilla hawser would raise it, let alone a steel cable. I\nhave another safety device. Granted that the cable should snap, I can\ndetach the lead from it and it would shoot to the surface like a\nrocket.\"\n\n\"How long can you remain under water in it?\"\n\n\"A week, if necessary. I have an oxygen tank and a carbon dioxide\nremoving apparatus which will keep the air in good condition. The globe\nis electrically lighted, and can be heated if necessary. Should my\ntelephone line become fouled and broken, I have a radio set which will\nenable me to communicate with you. I can't see that it is especially\ndangerous; not nearly as much so as a submarine.\"\n\n\"What is your object in going down, if I may ask?\"\n\n\"To take pictures and to explore the wreck if we can. The globe is\nequipped with huge floodlights and excellent cameras. The salvage people\nare having a little trouble and we are trying to help them out.\"\n\n\"You mentioned exploring. Can you leave the globe while it is under\nwater?\"\n\n\"Yes. There is a locking device for doing so. A man in a diving suit can\nenter the lock and fill it with water. Once the external pressure is\nreleased he can open the outer door and step out. Coming back, he seals\nthe outer door and the man inside blows out the lock and compressed air\nand then the inner door can be opened. It is the same principle as a\ntorpedo tube.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA jangle of bells interrupted them and the _Minneconsin_ slowed down.\nCommander Lawrence stepped to the rail and gave a sharp order to the\nnavigating officer on the bridge. The bells jangled again and the ship's\nengines stopped.\n\n\"We are almost over the buoy, Doctor,\" he said.\n\nDr. Bird nodded and spoke to the two mechanics. With a few final\ntouches to the apparatus they emerged from the globe and Dr. Bird\nentered.\n\n\"Come on, Carnes,\" he called. \"No backing out at the last minute.\"\n\nCarnes stepped forward with a sickly smile and joined the Doctor in the\nhuge sphere.\n\n\"All right, boys; close her up.\"\n\nThe mechanics swung the outer door into place with a crane. Both the\nedge of the door and the surface against which it fitted had been ground\nflat and were in addition faced with soft rubber. Bolts were fastened in\nthe door which passed through holes in the main sphere, and Dr. Bird\nspun nuts onto them and tightened them with a heavy wrench. He and\nCarnes lifted the smaller inner door into place and bolted it tight. Dr.\nBird stepped to the telephone.\n\n\"Lower away,\" he directed.\n\nFrom a boom attached to the _Minneconsin's_ forward fighting top, a huge\nsteel cable swung down, and the latch at the end of the cable was closed\nover a vitrilene ring which was fastened to the top of the sphere. The\ncable tightened and the globe with the two men in it was lifted over the\nside of the battleship and lowered gently into the water. Carnes\ninvoluntarily ducked and threw up his hand as the waters closed over\nthem. Dr. Bird laughed.\n\n\"Look up, Carnes,\" he said.\n\nCarnes gasped as he looked up and saw the surface of the water above\nhim. Dr. Bird laughed again and turned to the telephone.\n\n\"Lower away,\" he said. \"Everything is tight.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe globe descended into the depths of the sea. Darker and darker it\ngrew until only a faint twilight glow filled the sphere. A dark bulk\nloomed before them. Dr. Bird snapped on one of his huge floodlights and\npointed.\n\n\"The _Arethusa_,\" he said.\n\nThe ill-fated vessel lay on her side with a huge jagged hole torn in her\nfabric amidships.\n\n\"That's where her boilers burst,\" explained the Doctor. \"Luckily we have\na hard bottom to deal with. Let's see if we can locate any of Mitchell's\nsea serpents.\"\n\nHe turned on other flood lights and swept the bottom of the sea with\nthem. The huge beams bored out into the water for a quarter of a mile,\nbut nothing unusual was to be seen. Dr. Bird turned his attention again\nto the wreck.\n\n\"Things look normal from this side,\" he said after a prolonged scrutiny.\n\"I'll have the _Minneconsin_ steam around it while we look it over.\"\n\nIn response to his telephone orders the ship above them swung around the\nwreck in a circle, and Carnes and the Doctor viewed each side in turn.\nBut nothing of a suspicious nature made its appearance. The sphere\nstopped opposite the hole in the side and Dr. Bird turned to Carnes.\n\n\"I'm going to put on a diving suit and explore that wreck,\" he said. \"If\nthere ever was any danger, it isn't apparent now; and I can't find out\nanything until I get inside.\"\n\n\"Don't do it, Doctor!\" cried Carnes. \"Remember what happened to the\nother divers!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"We don't know what happened to them, Carnes. No matter what it was,\nthere is no danger apparent right now, and I've got to get into that\nship before I can get any real information. We could have lowered an\nunder-sea camera and learned as much as we have so far.\"\n\n\"Let me go instead of you, Doctor.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry to refuse you, old dear, but frankly, I wouldn't trust your\njudgment as to what you had seen if you went alone; and we can't both\ngo.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"If we both went, who would work the air to let us back in? No, this is\na one-man job and I'm the one to do it. While I am gone, keep a sharp\nlookout, and if you see anything unusual call me at once.\"\n\n\"How can I call you?\"\n\n\"On this small radio phone. A pair of receivers tuned to the right\nwave-length are in my diving helmet, and I will be able to hear you\nalthough I can't reply. I won't be gone long: I have only a small air\ntank, large enough to keep me going for thirty minutes. Now help me into\nmy suit and keep a sharp watch. A timely warning may save my life if\nanything happens.\"\n\nWith Carnes' assistance, Dr. Bird donned a deep-sea diving outfit and\nscrewed down the helmet. He crawled through the inner door into the lock\nand lifted the inner door into place. Carnes fastened the door with nuts\nand the Doctor opened a pair of valves in the outer door and filled the\nlock with water. He removed the outer door; and, taking in one hand a\nsteel-shod twelve-foot pike with a hook on the end, and in the other a\nwaterproof flashlight, he sallied forth. As he left the shell he paused\nfor a moment, and then returned and picked up the heavy wrench with\nwhich he had removed the nuts holding the outer door into place. He\nfastened the tool to the belt of his suit. Then, with a wave of his hand\ntoward the detective, he approached the hulk.\n\nThe hole in the side was too high for him to reach, but he hooked the\nend of his pike in one of the joints of the _Arethusa's_ plates and\nclimbed slowly and painfully up the side of the vessel. As he\ndisappeared into the hull, Carnes realized with a sudden start that he\nhad been watching his friend and neglecting the duty imposed on him of\nkeeping a sharp watch. He turned quickly to the floodlights and searched\nthe sea bottom.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNothing appeared, and the minutes moved as slowly as hours should.\nCarnes felt that he had been submerged alone for weeks, and his nerves\ngrew so tense that he felt that he would scream in another instant. A\nsudden thought sobered him like a dash of cold water. If he screamed,\nDr. Bird would take it for an alarm signal and possibly be afraid to\nemerge from the vessel. His watch showed him that the Doctor had been\ngone for twenty-five minutes and he moved slowly to the radio\ntransmitter.\n\n\"Dr. Bird,\" he said slowly and distinctly, \"you have been gone nearly\nthirty minutes. Nothing alarming has appeared but I will feel better\nwhen I see you coming back.\"\n\nHe glued his eyes on the opening in the ship's side and waited. Five\nminutes passed, and then ten, with no signs of the Doctor. Carnes moved\nagain to the receiver.\n\n\"It has been over half an hour. Doctor,\" he cried in a pleading voice.\n\"If you are all right, for God's sake show yourself. I am frantic with\nworry.\"\n\nAnother five minutes passed, and the sweat dripped in a steady stream\nfrom the detective's chin. Suddenly he gave a sob of relief and sank\nback against the side of the globe. A bulky figure showed at the edge of\nthe hole, and Dr. Bird climbed slowly and heavily out of the hold and\ndropped to the sea bottom. He lay prone for a moment before he rose and\nmade his way with evident effort toward the sphere. He entered the\ncompartment and with a heroic effort lifted the outer door into place,\nand feebly and with fumbling fingers placed nuts on the bolts. His hands\nwandered uncertainly toward the valves and closed the upper one. He\nwaved his hand toward Carnes and sank in a heap on the floor of the\nlock.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith trembling hands Carnes connected the air and opened the valve. Air\nflowed into the lock and the water was gradually forced out. When the\nlock was empty, he waited for Dr. Bird to close the outer valve but the\nDoctor did not move. Carnes tore at the bolts which held the inner door\nand threw his weight against it. It held against his assault, and he\nthought frantically. An inspiration came to him, and he disconnected\nthe air valve. With a whistling rush, the air from the lock rushed into\nthe sphere and he forced open the inner door. A stream of sea water\ndrove against his feet through the open valve, and he reached for the\nvalve to close it. The force of the water held it open for a moment, but\nhe threw every ounce of his strength into the effort. The valve slowly\nclosed.\n\nIt was beyond his strength to haul the heavy Doctor with his pressure\ndiving suit through the restricted confines of the inner door, so Carnes\nwormed his way into the lock and with trembling fingers unscrewed the\nhelmet of the Doctor's diving suit. The helmet clanged to the floor and\nCarnes scooped up his hands full of water and dashed it into the\nDoctor's face. There was no response and he was at his wit's end. He\nsprang for the radio to order the sphere hauled up when his glance fell\non the oxygen tank. It took him only a moment to connect a rubber hose\nto the tank, and in a few seconds a blast of the life-giving gas was\nblowing into the scientist's face. Dr. Bird gave a convulsive gasp or\ntwo and opened his eyes.\n\n\"Shut off the juice, Carnes,\" he said faintly. \"Too much of that's\nbad.\"\n\nCarnes shut off the oxygen and Dr. Bird struggled to a sitting position\nand inhaled deep breaths.\n\n\"That was a narrow squeak, old dear,\" he said faintly. \"Give me a hand\nand I'll climb in.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith the detective's aid he climbed into the sphere and Carnes fastened\nthe inner door. Slowly the Doctor rid himself of the diving suit and lay\nprone on the floor, his breath still coming in gasps.\n\n\"Thanks for your warning about the time, Carnes,\" he said. \"I knew that\nmy air supply was running short but I was caught down there and couldn't\nreadily free myself. I thought for a while that my time had come, but it\nwasn't so written. By the looks of things, I freed myself just in\ntime.\"\n\n\"Did you find out anything?\" asked the detective eagerly.\n\n\"I did,\" replied Dr. Bird grimly. \"For one thing, the gold is no longer\nin the hold of the _Arethusa_.\"\n\n\"It's gone?\"\n\n\"Clean as a whistle, every bar of it. A hole has been cut in the vault\naround the combination, and the bars slid back and the door opened. The\ngold has been stolen.\"\n\n\"Might it not have been stolen before the vessel sank?\"\n\n\"The idea occurred to me of course, and I examined things pretty\ncarefully. I know that the theft occurred after the vessel sank.\"\n\n\"How could you tell?\"\n\n\"For one thing, the hole was cut with an under-water cutting torch. For\nthe second, look here.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Doctor rolled up his trousers and showed the detective his leg.\nCarnes cried out as he saw huge purple welts on it.\n\n\"What caused that?\" he cried.\n\n\"As I entered the vault, I stepped full into a steel bear trap which was\nset there for the purpose of catching and holding anyone who entered.\nSomeone has visited the _Arethusa_, since she sank, and looted her, and\nalso arranged so that any diver who got as far as the vault would never\nreturn to the surface to tell of it. Luckily for myself, I carried a\nheavy wrench and was able to free myself. Most divers don't carry such a\nthing.\"\n\n\"But who could have done it?\"\n\n\"That's what we have got to find out, and we aren't going to do it down\nhere. Give the word to have us hauled up; and, Carnes, don't mention\nanything about the looting of the vessel. Allow it to be understood that\nI couldn't get into the hold. We'll head back for New York at once. I\nwant to have a few small changes made in this sphere before we use it\nagain. While I am doing that, I want you to get hold of the Coast Guard\nor the Immigration Service or whoever it is that has the complete\nrecords in that case of alien smuggling, by the Young Labor party. When\nyou get the information, report to me and we'll go over it. You might\nalso drop a hint to Captain Starley that will stop all further attempts\nat salvage operations for a few days. Tell him that I'll arrange to have\na Coast Guard cutter guard the locality of the wreck.\"\n\n\"Won't that be rather risky for the cutter?\"\n\n\"I think not. The gold is gone and there is no reason to apprehend any\nfurther danger in that locality, at least for the present.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt nine o'clock next morning Carnes and Dr. Bird sat in the office of\nLieutenant Commander Minden of the United States Coast Guard, listening\nintently to the history of the alien smuggling case. Commander Minden\nwas saying:\n\n\"Their boats would load up and clear ostensibly for Rio de Janeiro or\nsome other South American port, but once they were in the Atlantic, they\nwould alter their course and head from the Massachusetts coast. Of\ncourse, we had no right to interfere with them on the high seas, and\nthey never came closer than fifty miles of our coast line. When they got\nthat close, they would cruise slowly back and forth for a few days and\nthen steam away south to the port they had cleared for. When they got\nthere, of course there were no passengers on board.\n\n\"We patrolled the coast carefully while they were around but we never\ngot any indication of any landing of aliens and yet we knew they were\nbeing landed in some way. We drew lines so close that a cork couldn't\nget by without being seen and we even had the air patrolled, but with no\nresults. Eventually the air patrol was the thing that gave them away.\n\n\"They had been operating so successfully that they evidently got\ncareless and started a load off late in the night so they didn't reach\nthe coast by dawn. A Navy plane was flying along the coast-line about\ntwelve miles off when they spotted a submarine running parallel with the\ncoast, headed north. It didn't look like an American craft and they went\non and radioed Washington and found that we had no under-sea craft in\nthat neighborhood. They returned to their patrol and followed the sub\nfor a matter of thirty or forty miles up the coast, and then it turned\nin right toward the shore. The shore line there is rocky, and, at the\npoint where the sub was heading, it falls sheer about two hundred\nfathoms. The sub ran right at the cliff and disappeared from view.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLieutenant Commander Minden paused impressively. Carnes and Dr. Bird set\nforward in their chairs, for it was evident that the crux of the story\nwas at hand.\n\n\"When the plane reported what they had seen, we knew how those aliens\nwere being landed. The point where the sub went in gave us a good idea\nof the location of their base and we threw a cordon of men around and\nsearched. A Navy sub was sent to the scene and they reported that there\nwas a tunnel opening into the rock, about a hundred fathoms under water,\nrunning for they had no idea how far under the land. They stayed to\nguard the hole while we combed the land. It took us a week to locate the\nplace, but we traced some truck loads of food and finally found it. This\ntunnel ran under the land for a mile and then ended in a large cave\nunderground. The Young Labor party had established a regular receiving\ndepot there, and took the aliens from the sub and kept them for a day or\ntwo until they had a chance to load them into trucks and run them into\nBoston or some other town in the night.\n\n\"Once we had the place spotted, we sent a gang in and captured the whole\nworks without any trouble. The underground cavern had no natural opening\nto the surface, but one had been made by blasting. We captured the\nwhole lot and then sealed the end of the hole with rock and concrete.\nThat was the end of the affair.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Commander; you have given us a very graphic description of\nit. I suppose you could find the entrance which was sealed up?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Easily. I led the raiding party. I forgot to mention one blunder we\nmade. Evidently some word of our plans leaked out, for the sub which was\nguarding the outer end of the tunnel was called away by a radio message\nsupposed to be from the Navy Department. It had gone only a short\ndistance, however, when the commander smelled a rat and made his way\nback. He was too late. He was just in time to see the sub emerge from\nthe hole and head into the open sea. He gave chase, but the other sub\nwas faster than the Navy boat and it got clear away. The leader of the\ngang must have been on it, for we didn't get him.\"\n\n\"Who was the leader?\"\n\n\"From some records we captured, his name was Ivan Saranoff. I never saw\nhim.\"\n\n\"Saranoff?\" said Dr. Bird thoughtfully. \"The name seems familiar. Where\nhave I--Thunder! I know now. He was at one time a member of the faculty\nof St. Petersburg. He was one of the leading biologists of his time.\nCarnes, we've found our man.\"\n\n\"If you are thinking of Saranoff, I am afraid you are mistaken, Doctor,\"\nsaid Commander Minden. \"Neither he nor his submarine have ever been\nheard of since and it has been generally conceded that they were lost at\nsea. We had some pretty rough weather just after that affair.\"\n\n\"Rough weather doesn't mean much to a sub, Commander. I expect that he's\nour man. At any rate, the place we want to go is the end of that\ntunnel.\"\n\n\"I'm at your service, Doctor.\"\n\n\"Carnes, get the location of that tunnel entrance from Commander Minden\nand order the _Minneconsin_ to proceed north along the coast to that\nvicinity and stand by for radio orders. I am going to telephone Mitchell\nField and get a plane. We have no time to lose.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe plane from Mitchell Field roared down to a landing, and Carnes, Dr.\nBird and Commander Minden dismounted from the rear cockpit and looked\naround. They had landed in a smooth field at the base of a rise almost\nrugged enough to be called a mountain. A group of three men were\nstanding near them as they got out of the plane. One of the men\napproached.\n\n\"Dr. Bird?\" asked the newcomer. \"I am Tom Harron, United States Marshal.\nThese two men are deputies. I understand that I am to report to you for\norders.\"\n\n\"I'm glad to know you, Mr. Harron. This is Operative Carnes of the\nSecret Service and Commander Minden of the Coast Guard. We are going to\nexplore an underground cavern that is located in this vicinity.\"\n\n\"Do you mean the one where they used to smuggle aliens? That is closed\nup. I was in charge of that work and we closed it tight as a drum two\nyears ago.\"\n\n\"Can you find the entrance?\"\n\n\"Sure. It isn't over a mile from here.\"\n\n\"Lead the way, then. We want to take a look at it.\"\n\nThe marshal led the way toward the eminence and took a path which led up\na gully in its side. He paused for a moment to take his bearings and\nthen turned sharply to his left and climbed part way up the side of the\nravine.\n\n\"Here it is,\" he announced. An expression of astonishment crossed his\nface and he examined the ground closely. \"By Golly, Doc,\" he went on as\nhe straightened up, \"this place has been opened since I left it!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDr. Bird hurried forward and joined him. The heavy stone and concrete\nwith which the entrance to the cavern had been sealed were undisturbed,\nbut in the side of the hill was set a steel door beside the concrete.\nThere was no sign of a keyhole or other means of entering it.\n\n\"Was this steel door part of your work?\" asked Carnes.\n\n\"No, sir, it wasn't. We sealed it solid. That door has been put there\nsince.\"\n\nDr. Bird closely examined the structure. He tapped it and went around\nthe edges and then straightened up and took a small pocket compass from\nhis pocket and opened the case. The needle swung crazily for a moment\nand then pointed straight toward the door.\n\n\"A magnetic lock,\" he exclaimed. \"If we could find the power line it\nwould be easy to force, but finding that line might take us a week. At\nany rate, we have found out what we were after. This is their base from\nwhich they are operating. Mr. Harron, I want you to station a guard\narmed with rifles at this door day and night until I personally relieve\nyou. Remember, until I relieve you, in person. Verbal or written orders\ndon't go. Capture or kill anyone who tries to enter or leave the cavern\nthrough this entrance. Just now we'll find that cavern more vulnerable\nfrom the sea end, and that is where I mean to attack. We'll force that\ndoor and explore from this end later. Commander Minden, you may stay\nhere with Mr. Harron, if you like, or you may come with Carnes and me.\nWe are going on board the _Minneconsin_.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Mitchell Field plane roared to a take-off and bore south along the\ncoast. Half an hour of flying brought them in view of the battleship\nsteaming at full speed up the coast. Dr. Bird radioed instructions to\nthe ship, and an hour later a launch picked them up from the beach and\ntook them out. As soon as they were on board they resumed their\nprogress, and in two hours the peak that Dr. Bird had marked as a\nlandmark was opposite.\n\n\"Steam in as close to the shore as you can safely,\" he said, \"and then\nlower us. Once we are down, you will be guided by our telephoned\ninstructions. Come on, Carnes, let's go.\"\n\nThe detective followed him into the sphere as the _Minneconsin_ edged up\ntoward the shore. The huge ball was lifted from the deck and lowered\ngently into two hundred fathoms of water. It was pitch dark at that\ndepth, and Dr. Bird switched on one floodlight and studied the cliff\nwhich rose a hundred yards from them.\n\n\"We have missed the place, Carnes,\" he said. \"We'll have them pull us up\na few hundred feet and then steam along the coast.\"\n\nHe turned to the telephone and the sphere rose while the battleship\nsteamed slowly ahead, the vitrilene ball following in her wake. For a\nquarter of a mile they continued on their way, and then Dr. Bird halted\nthe ship.\n\n\"What depth are we?\" he asked. \"Eighty fathoms? All right, lower us,\nplease.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe ball sank until it rested on the sea bottom, and Dr. Bird turned on\ntwo additional floodlights and studied the surroundings. The bed of the\nocean was literally covered with lobster and crab shell, with the bones\nof fish scattered here and there among them. A few bones of land animals\nwere mixed with the debris and Carnes gave a gasp as Dr. Bird pointed\nout to him a diving helmet.\n\n\"We are on the right track,\" said the scientist grimly. He stepped to\nthe telephone and ordered the sphere raised to one hundred fathoms. The\nship moved forward along the coast until Dr. Bird again stepped to the\ntelephone and halted it. Before them yawned the entrance to the\nunderground tunnel. It was about two hundred feet high and three hundred\nacross, and their most powerful beams would not penetrate to the end of\nit. A pile of debris could be seen on the floor of the tunnel and\nCarnes fancied that he could see another diving helmet among the litter.\nDr. Bird pointed toward the side of the cavern.\n\n\"See those floodlights fastened to the cliff so that their beams will\nsweep across the mouth of the tunnel when they are lighted?\" he said.\n\"Apparently the cave is used as a prison and the light beams are the\nbars. The creature is not at home just now or the bars would be up. My\nGod! Look at that, Carnes!\"\n\nCarnes stared and echoed the Doctor's cry of surprise. Clinging to a\nshelf of rock which extended out from the wall of the cavern and half\nhidden among the seaweed was a huge marine creature. It looked like a\nhuge black slug with rudimentary eyes and mouth. The thing was fifty\nfeet in length and fully fifteen feet in diameter. It hung there, moving\nsluggishly as though breathing, and rudimentary tentacles projecting\nfrom one end moved in the water.\n\n\"What is it, Doctor?\" asked Carnes in a voice of awe.\n\n\"It is a typical trochosphere of the giant octopus, the devil fish of\nIndian Ocean legend, multiplied a thousand times,\" he replied. \"When the\noctopus lays its eggs, they hatch out into the larval form. The free\nswimming larva is known as a trochosphere, and I am positive that that\nis what we see; but look at the size of the thing! Man alive, if that\never developed, I can't conceive of its dimensions!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I have seen pictures of a huge octopus pulling down a ship,\" said\nCarnes, \"but I always fancied they were imaginary.\"\n\n\"They are. This monstrosity before us is no product of nature. A dozen\nof them would depopulate the seas in a year. It is a hideous parody of\nnature conceived in the brain of a madman and produced by some glandular\ndisturbance. Saranoff spent years in glandular experimentation, and no\ndoubt he has managed to stimulate the thyroid of a normal octopus and\nproduce a giant. I fancy that the immediate parent of the thing before\nus was of normal size, and so, probably, are its brothers and sisters.\nThe phenomenon of giantism of this nature occurs in alternate\ngenerations and then only in rare instances. Its grandparent may not be\nfar away, however. I wish it was safe to use a submarine to explore that\ncavern.\"\n\n\"Why isn't it?\"\n\n\"Any creature powerful enough to pull the _Arethusa_ under water would\ncrush a frail submarine without effort. Anyway, a Navy sub isn't built\nfor under-water exploration like this ball is. The window space is quite\nlimited and they aren't equipped with powerful floodlights. I would like\nto be able to reach that thing and destroy it, but it can wait until\nlater. The best thing we can do is to put out our lights and wait.\"\n\nHis hand sought the light switch, and the globe became dark. Only a tiny\nglimmer of light came down to them from the surface, a hundred fathoms\nabove. In the darkness they stared into the depths of the sea.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor an hour they waited and then Dr. Bird grasped Carnes by the\nshoulder and pointed. Far in the distance could be seen a tiny point\nof light. It wavered and winked and at times disappeared, but it was\ngradually approaching them. Dr. Bird stepped to the telephone and the\n_Minneconsin_ moved a hundred yards further from the shore. The light\ndisappeared again as though hidden by some opaque body. Their eyes\nhad become accustomed to the dim light and they could dimly see a long\nsnake-like body approach the globe and then suddenly withdraw.\n\nThe light appeared again only a few hundred yards away. The water\nswirled and the sphere swayed drunkenly as some gigantic body moved past\nit with express train speed and entered the mouth of the cavern. The\nlight turned toward them and they could see the dim outlines of a small\nsubmarine on which it was mounted. Another rush of water came as the\nobject which had entered the cave started to leave it, and the light\nswung around. It bore on a huge black body, and was reflected with a red\nglow from huge eyes, and the creature backed again into the cave. Back\nand forth across the mouth of the cavern the light played, and the\nwatchers caught a glimpse of a huge parrot beak which could have\nengulfed a freight car. From the cavern projected twisting tentacles of\ngargantuan dimensions, and red eyes, thirty feet in diameter, glared\nbalefully at them. For several minutes the light of the submarine played\nacross the mouth of the cave, and then the floodlights on the cliff\nsprang into full glow and bathed the ball and the mouth of the tunnel in\na flood of light.\n\nBefore their horrified gaze was an octopus of a size to make them\ndisbelieve their eyes. The submarine had moved up to within a few feet\nof them, and the light from it played full on the ball. The submarine\nmaneuvered in the vicinity, keeping the ball full in the beam of its\nlight, and then drew back. As it did so, the floodlights on the cliff\ndied out and the beam of the submarine's light was directed away from\nthem. Dr. Bird jumped to the telephone.\n\n\"Head straight out to sea and full speed ahead!\" he shouted. \"Don't try\nto pull us in; tow us!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe ball swayed as the _Minneconsin's_ mighty engines responded to his\norders and the cliff wall disappeared.\n\n\"As long as they know we're here, we might as well announce our presence\nin good style,\" said the doctor grimly as he closed a switch and threw\nall of the sphere's huge lights into action. He had turned on the lights\njust in time, for even as he did so a mighty tentacle shot out of the\ndarkness and wrapped itself around the ball. For a moment it clung there\nand then was withdrawn.\n\n\"The thing can't stand light,\" remarked the doctor as he threw off the\nswitch. \"That sub was herding it like a cow by the use of a light beam.\nAs long as we are lighted up we are safe from attack.\"\n\n\"Then for God's sake turn on the lights!\" cried Carnes.\n\n\"I want it to attack us,\" replied the doctor calmly. \"We have no\noffensive weapons and only by meeting an attack can we harm the thing.\"\n\nAs he spoke there came a soft whisper of sound from the vitrilene walls\nand they were thrown from their feet by a sudden jerk. Dr. Bird stumbled\nto the switch and closed it, and the ball was flooded with light. Two\narms were now on them but they were slowly withdrawn as the lights\nglared forth. The huge outlines of the beast could be seen as it\nfollowed them toward the surface. Its great eyes glared at them\nhungrily. The submarine was visible only as a speck of light in the\ndistance.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe _Minneconsin's_ speed was picking up under the urge of her huge\nsteam turbines, and the ball was nearing the surface. The sea was light\nenough now that they could see for quite a distance. The telephone bell\njangled and Dr. Bird picked the receiver from its hook.\n\n\"Hello,\" he said. \"What's that? You can? By all means, fire. Yes,\nindeed, we're well out of danger; we must be thirty or forty feet down.\nWatch the fun now,\" he went on to Carnes as he replaced the receiver.\n\"The beast is showing above the surface and they're going to shell it.\"\n\nThey watched the surface and suddenly there came a flash of light\nfollowed by a dull boom of sound. The huge octopus suddenly sank below\nthem, thrashing its arms about wildly.\n\n\"A hit!\" shouted Dr. Bird into the telephone. \"Get it again if it shows\nup. I want it to get good and mad.\"\n\nHe turned off the lights in the ball and the octopus attacked again. The\nshell had taught it caution and it kept well down, but three huge arms\ncame up from the depths of the sea and wrapped themselves about the\nball. The forward motion stopped for a moment, and then came a jerk that\nthrew them down. The ball started to sink.\n\n\"Our cable has parted!\" cried the doctor. \"Turn on the lights!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCarnes closed the switch. The ball was so covered with the huge\ntentacles that they could see nothing, but the light had its usual\neffect and they were released. The ball sank toward the bottom and they\ncould see the huge cephalopod lying below watching them. Blood was\nflowing from a wound near one of its eyes where the _Minneconsin's_\nshell had found its mark.\n\nToward the huge monster they sank until they lay on the bottom of the\nocean and a few yards from it. In an instant the sea became opaque and\nthey could see nothing.\n\n\"He has shot his ink!\" cried the doctor. \"Here comes the real attack.\nStrap yourself to the wall where you can reach one of the motor\nswitches.\"\n\nThrough the darkness huge arms came out and wrapped themselves around\nthe ball. The heavy vitrilene groaned under the enormous pressure which\nwas applied, but it held. The ink was clearing slightly and they could\nsee that the sphere was covered by the arms. The mass moved and the huge\nmaw opened before them. The pipes projecting from the sides of the ball\nwere buried in the creature's flesh.\n\n\"Good Lord, he's going to swallow us!\" gasped the doctor. \"Quick,\nCarnes, the motor switch.\"\n\nHe closed one of them as he spoke, and the powerful little electric\nmotors began to hum, forcing forward the piston attached to the tank\nconnected to the hollow rods. Steadily the little motors hummed, and the\ntank emptied through the rods into the body of the giant cephalopod.\n\n\"I hope the stuff works fast,\" groaned the doctor as they approached\ncloser to the giant maw. \"I never tried giving an octopus a hypodermic\ninjection of prussic acid before, but it ought to do the business.\nThere's enough acid there to kill half New York City.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCarnes blanched as the ball approached the mouth. One by one the arms\nunwound until only one was holding them and the jaws opened wider. They\nwere almost in them when the motion stopped. They could feel a shudder\nrun through the arm which held them. For a moment the arm alternately\nexpanded and contracted, almost releasing them only to clutch them\nagain. Another arm came from the depths and whipped about the ball, and\nagain the vitrilene groaned at the pressure which was applied. The arms\nwere suddenly withdrawn and the ball started to sink.\n\n\"Drop the lead, Carnes!\" cried the doctor. With the aid of the detective\nhe operated the electric catches which held the huge mass of lead to the\nbottom, and the sphere shot up through the water like a rocket. It\nleaped clear of the water and fell back with a splash. A half mile away\nthe _Minneconsin_ was swinging in a wide circle to head back toward\nthem. They turned their gaze toward the shore.\n\nAs they looked a giant arm shot a hundred yards up into the air,\ntwisting and writhing frantically. It disappeared, and another, and then\nhalf a dozen flashed into the air. The arms dipped below the surface. A\nhuge black body reared its bulk free from the water for a moment, and\nthe sea boiled as though in a violent storm. The body sank and again the\narms were thrown up, twisting and turning like a half dozen huge snakes.\nThe whole creature sank below the waves and the ball tossed back and\nforth, often buried under tons of water and once tossed thirty feet into\nthe air by the huge waves.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA momentary lull came in the waves. Carnes gave a cry of astonishment\nand pointed toward the shore. With an effort, Dr. Bird twisted himself\nin his lashing and looked in that direction. The huge body had again\ncome to the surface, and three of the arms were towering into the air.\nGrasped in them was a long, black, cigar-shaped object. As they watched\nthe object was torn into two parts and the fragments crushed by the\nenormous power of the octopus. Again the arms writhed in torment, and\nthen they stiffened out. For a moment they towered in the air and then\nslowly sank below the surface of the sea.\n\n\"The cyanide has worked,\" cried the doctor, \"and in its last agonies the\ncreature has turned on its creator and destroyed him. It is a shame, for\nSaranoff was a brilliant although perverted genius, and besides, I would\nhave liked to have learned his method. However, I may find something\nwhen we open the land end and raid the cave; and really, he was too\nbrilliant a man to hang for murder. Once we open the cave and I get any\ndata that is there, my connection with the case will end. Trailing down\nthe gold and recovering it is a routine matter for Bolton, and one in\nwhich he won't need my help.\"\n\n\"What about that creature we saw in the cave, Doctor? Won't it hatch\ninto another terror of the sea like the thing that destroyed the ship?\"\n\n\"The trochosphere? No, I'm not worried there. It won't try to leave the\ncave for some days yet, and by that time we'll have the land end opened\nand the floodlights turned on. They will keep it there and it will\nstarve to death. We could send down a sub to feed it a torpedo, but\nthere's no need. Nature will dispose of it. Meanwhile, I hope the\n_Minneconsin_ rigs up a jury tackle pretty soon and takes us on board.\nI'm getting seasick.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_IN THE NEXT ISSUE_\n\n  THE FIFTH-DIMENSION CATAPULT\n\n  _A Novelette of an Extraordinary Interdimensional Rescue_\n  _By_ Murray Leinster\n\n\n  THE GATE TO XORAN\n\n  _A Thrilling Story of a Metal Man's Visit to Earth_\n  _By_ Hal K.

He rode the skies\n  like an avenging god.\n\n[Illustration: _There came a stabbing pencil of light from over Karl's\nshoulder._]\n\n\nBeneath the huge central arch in Cooper Square a meeting was in\nprogress--a gathering of the gray-clad workers of the lower levels of\nNew York. Less than two hundred of their number were in evidence, and\nthese huddled in dejected groups around the pedestal from which a\nfiery-tongued orator was addressing them. Lounging negligently at the\nedge of the small crowd were a dozen of the red police.\n\n\"I tell you, comrades,\" the speaker was shouting, \"the time has come\nwhen we must revolt. We must battle to the death with the wearers of the\npurple. Why work out our lives down here so they can live in the lap of\nluxury over our heads? Why labor day after day at the oxygen generators\nto give them the fresh air they breathe?\"\n\nThe speaker paused uncertainly as a chorus of raucous laughter came to\nhis ears. He glared belligerently at a group of newcomers who stood\naloof from his own gathering. Seven or eight of them there were, and\nthey wore the gray with obvious discomfort. Slummers! Well, they'd hear\nsomething they could carry back with them when they returned to their\nhomes!\n\n\"Why,\" he continued in rising tones, \"do we sit at the controls of the\npneumatic tubes which carry thousands of our fellows to tasks equally\nirksome, while they of the purple ride their air yachts to the pleasure\ncities of the sky lanes? Never in the history of mankind have the poor\nbeen poorer and the rich richer!\"\n\n\"Yah!\" shouted a disrespectful voice from among the newcomers. \"You're\nfull o' bunk! Nothing but bunk!\"\n\nAn ominous murmur swelled from the crowd and the red police roused from\ntheir lethargy. The mounting scream of a siren echoed in the vaulted\nrecesses above and re-echoed from the surrounding columns--the call for\nreserves.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll was confusion in the Square. The little group of newcomers\nimmediately became the center of a m\u00eal\u00e9e of dangerous proportions. Some\nof the more timid of the wearers of the gray struggled to get out of the\ncrowd and away. Others, not in sympathy with the speaker, rushed to the\nsupport of the besieged visitors. The police were, for the moment,\noverwhelmed.\n\nThe orator, mad with resentment and injured pride, hurled himself into\nthe group. A knife flashed in his hand; rose and fell. A scream of agony\nshrilled piercingly above the din of the fighting.\n\nThen came the reserves, and the wielder of the knife turned to escape.\nHe broke away from the milling combatants and made speedily for the\nshadows that lay beyond the great pillars of the Square. But he never\nreached them, for one of the red guards raised his riot pistol and\nfired. There was a dull _plop_, and a rubbery something struck the\nfleeing man and wrapped powerful tentacles around his body, binding him\nhand and foot in their swift embrace. He fell crashing to the pavement.\n\nA lieutenant of the red police was shouting his orders and the din in\nthe Square was deafening. With their numbers greatly augmented, the\nguards were now in control of the situation and their maces struck left\nand right. Groans and curses came from the gray-clad workers, who now\nfought desperately to escape.\n\nThen, with startling suddenness, the artificial sunlight of the\ncavernous Square was gone, leaving the battle to continue in utter\ndarkness.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCooper Square, in the year 2108, was the one gathering place in New York\nCity where the wearers of the gray denim were permitted to assemble and\ndiscuss their grievances publicly. Deep in the maze of lower-level ways\nseldom visited by wearers of the purple, the grottolike enclosure bore\nthe name of a philanthropist of the late nineteenth century and still\ncarried a musty air of certain of the traditions of that period.\n\nIn Astor Way, on the lowest level of all, there was a tiny book shop.\nNestled between two of the great columns that provided foundation\nsupport for the eighty levels above, it was safely hidden from the gaze\nof curious passersby in the Square. Slumming parties from afar, their\npurple temporarily discarded for the gray, occasionally passed within a\nstone's throw of the little shop, never suspecting the existence of such\na retreat amidst the dark shadows of the pillars. But to the initiated\nfew amongst the wearers of the gray, and to certain of the red police,\nit was well known.\n\nRudolph Krassin, proprietor of the establishment, was a bent and\nwithered ancient. His jacket of gray denim hung loosely from his\nspare frame and his hollow cough bespoke a deep-seated ailment.\nLooking out from behind thick lenses set in his square-rimmed\nspectacles, the watery eyes seemed vacant; uncomprehending. But old\nRudolph was a scholar--keen-witted--and a gentleman besides. To his\nmany friends of the gray-clad multitude he was an anomaly; they\ncould not understand his devotion to his well-thumbed volumes. But they\nlistened to his words of wisdom and, more frequently than they could\nafford, parted with precious labor tickets in exchange for reading\nmatter that was usually of the lighter variety.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen the fighting started in the Square, Rudolph was watching and\nlistening from a point of vantage in the shadows near his shop. This\nfellow Leontardo, who was the speaker, was an agitator of the worst\nsort. His arguments always were calculated to arouse the passions of his\nhearers; to inflame them against the wearers of the purple. He had\nnothing constructive to offer. Always he spoke of destruction; war;\nbloodshed. Rudolph marveled at the patience of the red police. To-day,\nthese newcomers, obviously a slumming party of youngsters bent on\nwhatever mischief they could find, were interfering with the speaker.\nThe old man chuckled at the first interruption. But at signs of real\ntrouble he scurried into the shadows and vanished in the blackness of\nfirst-level passages known only to himself. He knew where to find the\nautomatic sub-station of the Power Syndicate.\n\nReturning to the darkness he had created in the Square, he was relieved\nto find that the sounds of the fighting had subsided. Apparently most of\nthe wearers of the gray had escaped. He skirted the avenue of pillars\nalong Astor Way, feeling his way from one to another as he progressed\ntoward his little shop. Peering into the blackness of the square he saw\nthe feeble beams of several flash-lamps in the hands of the police. They\nwere searching for survivors of the fracas, maces and riot pistols held\nready for use. A sobbing gasp from close by set his pulses throbbing. He\ncrept stealthily in the direction from which the sound had come.\n\n\"Steady now,\" came a whispered voice. \"My uncle's shop is close by.\nHe'll take you in. Here--let me lift you.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a shuffling on the opposite side of the pillar at which\nRudolph had halted; another grunt of pain.\n\n\"Karl!\" hissed the old man. It was his nephew.\n\n\"Uncle Rudolph?\" came the guarded response.\n\n\"Yes. Can I help you?\"\n\n\"Quick--yes--he's fainted.\"\n\nThe old man was around the huge base of the column in an instant. He\ngroped in the darkness and his hands encountered human bodies.\n\n\"Who is it?\" he breathed.\n\n\"One of the hecklers, Uncle. A young lad; and of the purple I think.\nHe's been knifed.\"\n\nTogether they dragged the inert form into the shelter of the long line\nof pillars. There was a trampling of many men in the square. That would\nbe a second detachment of reserves. A ray of light filtered through and\ndancing shadows of the giant columns made grotesque outlines against the\nwalls of the Way. A portable searchlight had been brought to the scene.\nThey must hurry.\n\nImpeded by the dead weight of their burden, they made sorry progress and\nseveral times found it necessary to halt in the shadow of a pillar while\nthe red police passed by in their search of the Square. It was with a\nsigh of relief that Rudolph opened the door of his shop and with still\ngreater satisfaction closed and bolted it securely. His nephew\nshouldered the limp form of the unconscious youth and carried it to his\nown bed in one of the rear rooms.\n\n\"Ugh!\" exclaimed old Rudolph as he ripped open the young man's shirt,\n\"it's a nasty cut. Warm water, Karl.\"\n\nThe gaping wound was washed and bound tightly. Rudolph's experienced\nfingers told him the knife had not reached a vital spot. The youth would\nrecover.\n\n\"But Karl,\" he objected, \"he wears the purple. Under the gray. See!\nIt'll get us in trouble if we keep him.\"\n\nHe was stripping the young man of his clothing to prepare him for bed.\nSuddenly there was revealed on the white skin a triangular mark. Bright\nscarlet it was and just over the right hip. He made a hasty attempt to\nhide it from the watching eyes of Karl.\n\n\"Uncle!\" snapped his nephew, \"--the mark you call cursed! He has it,\ntoo!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe tall young man in gray was on his knees, tearing the hands of the\nold man away. He saw the mark clearly now. There was no further use of\nattempting to conceal it. Rudolph rose and faced his angered nephew, his\nwatery eyes inscrutable.\n\n\"You told me, Rudolph, that it was a brand that cursed me. I have seen\nit on him, too. You have lied to me.\"\n\nThe old man's eyes wavered. He trembled violently.\n\n\"Why did you lie?\" demanded Karl. \"Am I not your nephew? Am I not really\ncursed as you've maintained? Tell me--tell me!\"\n\nHe had the old man by the shoulders, shaking him cruelly.\n\n\"Karl--Karl,\" begged the helpless ancient, \"it was for your good. I\nswear it. You were born to the purple. That's what that mark means--not\nthat you're degraded to the gray, as I said. But there's a reason. Let\nme explain.\"\n\n\"Bah! A reason! You've kept me in this misery and squalor for a reason!\nWho's my father?\"\n\nHe flung Rudolph to the floor, where the old man crouched in apprehensive\nmisery.\n\n\"Please Karl--don't! I can explain. Just give me time. It's a long\nstory.\"\n\n\"Time! Time! For twenty-odd years you've lied to me; cheated me. My\nbirthright--where is it?\"\n\nHe menaced his supposed uncle; was about to strike him. Then suddenly he\nwas ashamed. He turned on his heel.\n\n\"I'm leaving,\" he said shortly.\n\n\"Karl--my boy,\" begged Rudolph Krassin, struggling to his feet. \"You\ncan't! That lad in there--he--\"\n\nBut Karl was too angry to reason.\n\n\"To hell with him!\" he raged, \"and to hell with you! I'm through!\"\n\nHe stamped from the room and out into the eery shadows of the Way. Karl\nwas done with his old life. He'd go to the upper levels and claim his\nrights. Some day, too, he'd punish the man who'd stolen them away. God!\nBorn to the purple! To think he'd missed it all! Probably was kidnaped\nby the old rascal he'd been calling uncle. But he'd find out. Rudolph\ndidn't have to explain. Fingerprint records would clear his name;\nestablish his rightful station in life. He dived into a passage that\nwould lead him to one of the express lifts. He'd soon be overhead.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA sergeant of the red police looked up startled from his desk as a tall\nyouth in the gray denim of forty levels below appeared before him.\n\n\"Well?\" he growled. The stalwart young worker had stared belligerently\nand insolently, he thought.\n\n\"I want to check my fingerprint record, Sergeant.\"\n\n\"Hm. Pretty cocky, aren't you? The records for such as you are down\nbelow, where you belong.\"\n\n\"Not mine, I think.\"\n\n\"So? And who the devil are you?\"\n\n\"That's what I'm here to find out. I've got a triangle branded on my\nright hip.\"\n\n\"A what?\"\n\n\"Triangle. Here--look!\"\n\nThe amazing youngster had raised his jacket and was pulling at his\nshirt. The sergeant stared at what was revealed, his eyes bulging as he\nlooked.\n\n\"Lord!\" he gasped, \"a Van Dorn--in the gray!\"\n\nQuickly he turned to the radiovision and made rapid connection with\nseveral persons in turn--important ones, by the appearance of the\nfeatures of each in the brilliant disc of the instrument.\n\nKarl was confused by the sudden turn of things. The sergeant talked so\nrapidly he could not catch the sense of his words. And that name, Van\nDorn, eluded him. He knew he had heard it before, in the little shop\ndown there in Astor Way. But he could not place it. He wished fervently\nthat he had paid more attention to the desires of old Rudolph; had\nstudied more and read the books the old man had begged him to read. His\nnew surroundings confused him, too, and he knew that he was the center\nof some great new excitement.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen they were in the room; two individuals, one in the red uniform of a\ncaptain of police, the other a pompous, whiskered man in purple. Others\nfollowed and it seemed to Karl that the room was filled with them,\nstrangers all, and they stared at him and chattered incessantly. He\nexperienced an overwhelming impulse to run, but mastered it and faced\nthem boldly.\n\nA square of plate glass was placed under his outstretched fingers. It\nwas smeared with something sticky and he watched the whiskered man as he\nheld it up to the light and studied the impressions. Then there was more\nconfusion. Everyone talked at once and the pompous one in purple made\nuse of the radiovision, holding the square of glass near its disc for\nobservation by the person he had called. The identification number was\nrepeated aloud, a string of figures and letters that were a meaningless\njumble to Karl. The room became quiet while the police captain thumbed\nthe pages of a huge book he had taken from among many similar ones that\nfilled a rack behind the desk.\n\nKarl's blood froze in his veins at the rumbling swish of a car speeding\nthrough the pneumatic tube beneath their feet. His nerves were on edge.\nThen the captain of police looked up from the book and there was a\npeculiar glint in his eyes as he spoke.\n\n\"Peter Van Dorn. Missing since 2085. Wanted by Continental Government.\nHa!\"\n\nThe words came to Karl's ears through a growing sensation of unreality.\nIt seemed that the speaker was miles away and that his voice and\nfeatures were those of a radiovision likeness. Wanted by the great power\nacross the Atlantic! It was unthinkable. Why, he had been but an infant\nin 2085! What possible crime could he have committed? But the red police\ncaptain was speaking again, this time in a chill voice. And the room of\nthe police, thick with the smoke of a dozen cigars, became suddenly\nstifling.\n\n\"Where have you been these twenty-three years, Peter Van Dorn?\" asked\nthe captain. \"Who have you lived with, I mean?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSomething warned him to protect old Rudolph. And somehow he wished\nhe had not treated the old fellow as he did when he left. His\nself-possession returned. A wave of hot resentment swept over him.\n\n\"That's my affair,\" he said defiantly.\n\nThe captain shrugged his shoulders. \"Oh, well,\" he said, \"you needn't\nanswer--now. We'll find out when it's necessary. In the meanwhile we'll\nhave to turn you over to the Continental Ambassador.\"\n\nTwo of the red police advanced toward him and the rest drew back.\n\n\"You mean I'm under arrest?\" asked Karl incredulously.\n\n\"Certainly. Of course you're not to be harmed.\"\n\nOne of the guards had him by the arm and he saw the glint of handcuffs.\nThey couldn't do this! If it had been for rioting in the Square it\nwould be different. But this! It meant he was a prisoner of a foreign\ngovernment, for what reason he could not guess. He lost his head\ncompletely.\n\nThe captain cried out in amazement as one of his huskiest guards went\nsprawling under a well-planted punch. This youngster must be as crazy as\nwas his father before him. But he was a whirlwind. Before he could be\nstopped he had tackled the other guard and with a mighty heave flung him\nhalfway across the room where he fell with a thud that left him dazed\nand gasping. The pompous little man in the purple crawled under the desk\nas the sergeant leveled a slender tube at the young giant in gray.\n\nKarl ducked instinctively at sight of the weapon, but the spiteful\ncrackle of its mechanism was too quick for him. A faintly luminous ray\nstruck him full in the breast and stopped him in his tracks. A thrill of\nintense cold chased up his spine and a thunderbolt crashed in his brain.\nThe captain caught his stiffened body as he fell.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKarl--refusing to think of himself as Peter Van Dorn--came to his senses\nas from a troubled sleep. His head ached miserably and he turned it\nslowly to view his surroundings. Then, in a flash, he remembered. The\nparalyzing ray of the red police! They never used it in the lower\nlevels; but overhead--why, the swine! He sat suddenly erect and glared\ninto a pair of green eyes that regarded him curiously.\n\nA quick glance showed him that he was in a small padded compartment like\nthat of the pneumatic tube cars. At one end there was an amazing array\nof machinery with glittering levers and handwheels--a control board on\nwhich numberless tiny lights blinked and flickered in rapid succession.\nAt these controls squatted the twisted figure of a dwarf. A second of\nthe creatures sat at his side and stared with those horrible green\neyes.\n\n\"Lord!\" he muttered. \"Am I still asleep?\"\n\n\"No,\" smiled the dwarf, \"you're awake, Peter Van Dorn.\" The misshapen\ncreature did not seem unfriendly.\n\n\"Then where am I, and who are you?\"\n\n\"You're in one of the Zar's rocket cars, speeding toward Dorn. We are\nbut two of the Zar's servants--Moon men.\"\n\n\"Rocket car? Moon men?\" Karl was aghast. He wanted to pinch himself. But\na hollow roar to the rear told him he was in a rapidly moving vessel of\nsome sort. Certainly, too, these dwarfs were not figments of his\nimagination.\n\n\"You've been kept completely ignorant?\" asked the dwarf.\n\n\"It--it seems so.\" Karl was bewildered. \"You mean we are out in the\nopen--traveling in space--to the Moon perhaps?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe dwarf laughed. \"No, I wish we were,\" he replied. \"But we are about\nhalfway to the capital of the Continental Empire, greatest of world\npowers. We'll be there in an hour.\"\n\n\"But I don't understand.\"\n\n\"Stupid. Didn't you ever hear of the rocket ships that cross the ocean\nlike a projectile, mounting a thousand miles from the surface and making\nthe trip in two hours?\"\n\n\"No!\" Karl was aghast. \"Are we really in such a contraption?\" he\nfaltered.\n\n\"Say! Are you kidding me?\" The dwarf was incredulous. \"Do you mean to\ntell me you know so little of your world as that? Have you never read\nanything? The news broadcasts, the thought exchangers--don't you follow\nthem at all?\"\n\nKarl shook his head in growing wonder. Truly Rudolph had kept him in\nignorance. Or was it his own fault? He had refused to dig into the\nvolumes old Krassin had begged him to read. The broadcasts and the\nthought machines--well, only those of the purple had access to those.\n\n\"Hey, Laro!\" called the dwarf to his companion, \"this mole is as dumb as\ncan be. Doesn't know he's alive hardly. And a Van Dorn!\"\n\nThe two laughed uproariously and Karl raged inwardly. Mole! So that's\nwhat they called wearers of the gray! He clenched his fists and rose\nunsteadily to his feet.\n\n\"Sorry,\" apologized his tormentor. \"Mustn't get sore now. It seems so\nfunny to us though. And listen, kid, you'll never have another chance to\nhear it all. So, if you'll sit down and calm yourself a bit I'll give\nyou an earful.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMollified, Karl listened. A marvelous tale it was, of a disgruntled\nscientist of the Eastern Hemisphere who had conquered that portion of\nthe world with the aid of the inhabitants he had found on the outer side\nof the Moon; of the scientist who still ruled the East--Zar of the\nContinental Empire. A horrible war--in 2085, the year of his own\nbirth--depopulated the countries of Asia, Europe and Africa and reduced\nthem to subjection. There was no combatting the destructive rays and\nchemical warfare of the Moon men. The United Americas, still weakened\nfrom a civil war of their own, remained aloof and, for some strange\nreason, the Zar left them in peace, contenting himself with his conquest\nof practically all of the rest of the world. Now, it seemed, the two\nmajor powers were as separate as if on different planets, there being no\ntraffic between them save by governmental sanction; and that was rarely\ngiven.\n\nIt grew uncomfortably warm in the compartment as the rocket car entered\nthe lower atmosphere but Karl listened spellbound to the astounding\nrevelations of the Moon man. There came a pause in the discourse of the\ndwarf as a number of relays clicked furiously on the control board and\nthe vessel slackened its speed perceptibly.\n\n\"But,\" said Karl, thinking aloud rather than meaning to interrupt,\n\"what has all this to do with me? Why does the government of this Zar\nwant me?\"\n\nThe dwarf bent close and eyed him cautiously. \"Poor kid!\" he whispered,\n\"it doesn't seem right that you should suffer for something that\nhappened when you were born; something you know nothing about. But the\nZar knows best. You--\"\n\nThere came a stabbing pencil of light from over Karl's shoulder and the\ngreen eyes of the dwarf went wide with horrified surprise. He clutched\nat his breast where the flame had contacted, then slowly collapsed in a\npitiful, distorted heap. Karl recoiled from the odor of putrefaction\nthat immediately filled the compartment. He whirled to face the new\ndanger but saw nothing but the padded walls.\n\nThen they were in darkness save for the blinking lights of the control\nboard. He was thrown forward violently and the piercing screech of\ncompressed air rushing past the vessel told him they had entered the\nreceiving tube at their destination and were being retarded in speed for\nthe landing. This much he had gathered from the explanations of the now\nsilenced dwarf.\n\nLaro, the other Moon man, remained mute at the controls. His companion\nevidently had talked too much.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe vessel had stopped and a section of the padded rear wall of the\ncompartment moved back to reveal a second chamber. There were three\nother occupants of the ship and Karl knew now at whose hands the\ntalkative Moon man had met his death. One of the three--all wearers of\nthe purple--still held the generator of the dazzling ray in his hands.\nHe decided wisely that resistance was useless and followed meekly when\nhe was led from the ship.\n\nEndlessly they rode upward in a high-speed lift, dismounting finally at\na pneumatic tube entrance. A special car whisked them roaring into the\nblackness. Then they were shot forth into the open and Karl saw the\nlight of the sun for the first time in many years. They were on the\nupper surface of a great city, Dorn, the capital of the Continental\nEmpire.\n\nThe air was filled with darting ships of all sorts and sizes, most of\nthem being pleasure craft of the wearers of the purple. To Karl it was\nthe sudden realization of his dreams. He was one of them. He, too,\nshould be wearing the purple. Then his heart sank as one of his guards\nprodded him into action. His dream already was shattered for they stood\nat the entrance to a great crystal pyramid that rose from the flat\nexpanse of the roofs of Dorn. It was the palace of the Zar.\n\nIt seemed then that fairyland had opened its gates to the young man in\ngray denim. He immediately fell under its influence when they traversed\na long lane between rows of brightly colored growing things which filled\nthe air with sweet odors. Feathered creatures fluttered about and\ntwittered and caroled in the sheer joy of being alive. It was sweeter\nmusic than he had ever believed possible or even imagined as existing.\nAgain he forgot the menace of the imperial edict which had brought him\nfrom the other side of the world.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen rudely, he was brought back to earth. He was in the presence of the\nmighty Zar and his three escorts were bowing themselves from the huge\nroom in which the wizened monarch sat enthroned. They had finished their\nduties.\n\nA shriveled face; beady eyes; trembling hands with abnormally large\nknuckles; a cruel and determined mouth--these were the features that\nmost impressed Karl as he stared wordlessly at this Zar of the Eastern\nHemisphere. The magnificence of the royal robe was lost on the young\nwearer of the gray.\n\n\"Well, well, so this is Peter Van Dorn, my beloved nephew.\" The Zar was\nspeaking and the chilly sarcasm in which the words were uttered belied\nthe friendliness they otherwise might have implied.\n\n\"That's what I'm told,\" replied Karl, \"though I didn't know I'm supposed\nto be the nephew of so great a figure as yourself.\"\n\nNot bad that, for an humble wearer of the gray.\n\n\"Oh, yes, yes, indeed. Why else should I have sent for you?\"\n\n\"I have wondered why--and still wonder.\"\n\n\"Oh, you wonder, eh?\" The Zar inspected him carefully and then broke\ninto a cackle of horrible laughter. \"A Van Dorn in gray denim!\" he\nchortled. \"A mole of the Americas! And to think that even the Zar has\nbeen unable to find him in all these years!\"\n\n\"Stop!\" bellowed Karl. \"I'll not have your ridicule. Come to the point\nnow and have it over with. Kill me if you will, but tell me the story!\"\nHe had seen the slender tube in the Zar's hand.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAn expression of surprise, almost of admiration, flickered in the beady\neyes of the Zar and was gone. He spoke coldly.\n\n\"Very well, I shall explain. You, Peter, are actually my nephew. Your\nfather, Derek Van Dorn, was my brother; he a king of Belravia and I a\npoor but experienced scientist. He scorned me and he paid, for I learned\nof the ancient race of the other side of the Moon, the side we can not\nsee from the earth. I went to them and enlisted their aid in warring\nupon my brother. When we returned to carry on this war I learned that I\nhad a son. So, too, did Derek. But my son was born in obscurity and\nDerek's son--you, Peter--in the lap of luxury. The war was short and, to\nme, sweet. Belravia was first to fall, and I had your father removed\nfrom this life by the vibrating death.\"\n\n\"You monster!\" cried Karl. But the slender rod menaced him.\n\n\"A moment, my hot-headed nephew. I vowed I'd have your life, Peter, but\nyour father had a few friends and one of these spirited you away. So\ntemporarily you escaped. But now I have you where I can keep that vow.\nYou, too, shall die. By the vibration. But first--ha! ha!--I'll give you\na taste of the purple. Just so the going will be harder.\"\n\nKarl kept his temper as best he could. He thought, conscience-stricken,\nof old Rudolph, that good friend of his father. Then he thought of that\nyouth he had taken from the Square.\n\n\"Your son?\" he asked gently. \"Has he the triangular brand?\"\n\nThe Zar was taken aback. \"He has, yes. Why?\" he asked.\n\n\"I have seen him in the Americas. He now lies wounded and in peril of\nhis life. What do you think of that?\"\n\nKarl was triumphant as the Zar paled.\n\n\"You lie, Peter Van Dorn!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut the beady eyes saw that the young man was truthful. Sudden fury\nassailed the monarch of the East. A bell pealed its mellow summons and\nthree Moon men entered the Presence.\n\n\"Quick, Taru--the radiovision! Our ambassador in the Americas!\" The Zar\nwas on his feet, his hard features terrible in fear and anger. \"By God!\"\nhe vowed, \"I'll lay waste the Americas if harm has come to my son. And\nyou\"--turning to Karl--\"I'll reserve for you an even more terrible fate\nthan the vibrating death!\"\n\nThe radiovision was wheeled in and in operation. A frightened face\nappeared in its disc: the Zar's ambassador across the sea.\n\n\"Moreau--my son!\" snapped the Zar. \"Where is he?\"\n\n\"Majesty! Have mercy!\" gasped Moreau. \"Paul has eluded us. He was\nskylarking--in the lower levels of New York. But our secret agents are\ncombing the passages. We'll have him in twenty-four hours. I promise!\"\n\nThe rage of the Zar was terrible to see. Karl expected momentarily that\nthe white flame would lay him low, for the anger of the mad ruler was\ndirected first at Moreau, then at himself. But a quick, evil calm\nsucceeded the storm.\n\n\"You, Peter,\" he stated, in tones suddenly silky, \"shall have that\ntwenty-four hours--no more. If Moreau has not produced my son in that\ntime you shall be dismembered slowly. A finger; an ear; your tongue; a\nhand--until you reveal the whereabouts of the heir to my throne!\"\n\n\"Never! You scum!\" Karl was on the dais in a single bound. He had the\nZar by the throat, his fingers twisting in the flabby flesh. Might as\nwell have it over at once. \"Fratricide--murderer of my father, I'll take\nyou with me!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut it was not to be. The throne room was filled with retainers of the\nmad emperor. Strong hands tore him away and he was borne, struggling and\nfighting, to the floor. A sharp pain in his forearm. A deadening of the\nmuscles. He was powerless, save for the painful ability to crawl to his\nknees, swaying drunkenly. A delicious languor overcame him. Nothing\nmattered now. He saw that a tall man in the purple had withdrawn the\nneedle of the hypodermic and was replacing the instrument in its case.\nEver so slowly, it seemed.\n\nThe Zar was laughing. That horrible cackle. But Karl didn't care. They'd\nhave their sport with him. Let 'em! Then it'd be over. Lord! If only he\nhad been a little quicker. He'd have torn the old Zar's windpipe from\nits place!\n\n\"My word,\" laughed the Zar. \"The sacred word of a Van Dorn. I gave it.\nHe'll wear the purple for a day. Take him from my sight!\"\n\nKarl was walking, quite willingly now. The effects of the drug were\naltering. His muscular strength returned but his mental state underwent\na complete change. Always he'd wanted a taste of the purple. For years\nhe'd listened to the orators of the Square, to the conflicting\nstatements of old Krassin. But now he'd see. He'd know the joys of the\nupper levels; the pleasure cities, perhaps. For one day. But what did it\nmatter? He found himself laughing and joking with his companion, a\nheavy-set wearer of the purple. They were in a luxurious apartment.\nServants! Moon men all of them, but so efficient. They stripped him of\nhis gray denim; discarded it contemptuously. Karl kicked the heap into a\ncorner and laughed delightedly. His bath was waiting.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMuch can happen in a day. Clothed in the purple, Karl--Peter Van Dorn,\nhe was, now--expanded. Turgid emotions surged through his new being. He\nwas a new man. In his rightful place. He was delighted with the\ncompanionship of his new friend of the purple, Leon Lemaire. An\neuphonious name! A fine fellow! Fool that the Zar must be, to leave him\nin the care of so amiable a man. Why, Leon couldn't hold him! None of\nthem could. He'd escape them all--if he wished. Twenty-four hours,\nindeed!\n\nThey were in the midst of a gay company. Wine flowed freely, and Leon\nhad attached to their party a pair of beautiful damsels, young, and easy\nto know. There was music and dancing. Lights of marvelous color played\nover the assemblage in the huge hall, swaying their senses at the will\nof some expert manipulator. Peter was a different person now. He was\nexhilarated to the point of intoxication, but not by the wine. Somehow\nhe couldn't bear the taste of the amber fluid the others were imbibing\nwith such gusto. The effects of the drug had left a coppery taste in his\nmouth. But no matter! Rhoda, his lovely companion at the table leaned\nclose. Her breath was hot at his throat. He swept her into his arms.\nLeon and the other girl laughed approvingly.\n\nThere were many such places in the upper levels of Dorn and they\ntraveled from one to another. Now their party was larger, it having\nbeen augmented by the appearance of other of Leon's friends. Fine\ncompanions, these men of the purple, and the women were incomparable.\nEspecially Rhoda. They understood one another perfectly now. It was all\nas he had pictured it.\n\nSomeone proposed that they visit the intermediate levels. It would be\nsuch a lark to watch the mechanicals. They made the drop in a lift. A\nlaughing, riotous party. And Peter was one of them! He felt that he had\nknown them for years. Rhoda clung to his arm, and the languorous glances\nfrom under her long lashes set the blood racing madly in his veins.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the levels of the mechanicals they romped boisterously. To them the\nstrange robots--creatures of steel and glass and copper--were objects of\nridicule. Poor, senseless mechanisms that performed the tasks that made\nthe wearers of the purple independent of labor. Here they saw the\npreparation of their synthetic food, untouched by human hands. In one\nchamber a group of mechanicals, soulless and brainless, engaged in the\ndelicate chemical compounding of raw materials that went into the making\nof their clothing. Here was a nursery, where tiny tots born to the\npurple were reared to adolescence by unfeeling but efficient mechanical\nnurses. The mothers of the purple could not be bothered with their\noffspring until they had reached the age of reason. The whirring\nmachinery of a huge power plant provided much amusement for the feminine\nmembers of the party. It was all so massive; throbbing with energy. But\ndirty! Ugh! Lucky the attendants could be mechanicals.\n\n\"We have visited the lower levels,\" whispered Rhoda in his ear, \"but not\noften. It isn't pleasant. Ignorant fools in the gray denim--too many of\nthem. I don't know why we permit their existence. Fools who will not\nlearn. Education made us as we are, and they won't take it. Sullen\nlooks and evil leers are all that they have for us. Hope nobody suggests\ngoing down there now.\"\n\n\"Me, too,\" said Peter. He had forgotten that once he was Karl Krassin, a\nwearer of the despised gray.\n\nSomeone in the party was becoming restless. They must move on.\n\n\"Where to?\" asked Peter.\n\n\"Sans Dolor, sweet boy. A pleasure city within a hundred kilometers of\nDorn. You'll love it, Peter.\"\n\nA pleasure city! Fondest dream of the wearers of the gray! In the dim\npast, when he was Karl, he had dreamed it often. Now he was to visit\none!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey were atop the city now and the crystal palace of the Zar shimmered\nin the sunlight off there across the flat upper surface of Dorn. But it\nseemed so far away that Peter did not give it a second thought. He was\nliving in the present.\n\nA swift aero took them into the skies and they roared out above the\nwilderness that was everywhere between the great cities of earth. Funny\nnobody thought of leaving the cities and exploring the jungles of the\noutside. But, of course, it wasn't necessary. They had everything they\nneeded within the cities. All of their wants were supplied by the\nmechanicals and by the few toilers in the gray who still persisted in\nignorance and in some perverse ideas that they must work in order to\nlive. Besides, the jungle was dangerous.\n\nSans Dolor loomed into view, a great island floating in the air a\nthousand meters above the tossing waters of the ocean. Peter gave not a\nthought to the forces that kept it suspended. Dimly he recalled certain\nwords of old Rudolph, words regarding the artificial emanations that had\nbeen discovered as capable of counteracting the force of gravity. But\nhis mind was intent on the pleasures to come.\n\nThey were over the city. Carefully tended foliage lined its streets and\na smooth lagoon glistened in its center. Its towers and spires were\ndecorated with gay colors. The streets were filled with wearers of the\npurple and the nude bodies of bathers in the lagoon gleamed white in the\nstrong sunlight.\n\nHe sensed anew the nearness of Rhoda. Her soft warm hand nestled in his\nand she responded instantly to his sudden embrace.\n\nThere came a shock and the party was stilled in dismay. The aero\ncareened violently and the pilot struggled with controls that were dead.\nSans Dolor dropped rapidly away beneath them. They were shooting\nskyward, drawn by some inexplicable and invisible energy from above.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRhoda screamed and held him close, trembling violently. All of the women\nscreamed and the men cursed. Leon arose to his feet and stared at Peter.\nThe friendliness was gone from his features and he spat forth an\naccusation. A glistening mechanism appeared in his hand as if by magic.\nA ray generator! He had been appointed by the Zar to guard this upstart\nand, whatever happened, he'd not let him escape with his life. The girl\nshuddered at sight of the weapon and extricated herself from his arms.\nHer affection too had been a pose.\n\nPeter's mind was clearing from the effects of the drug. He had not the\nslightest idea of what might have caused the quick change in the\nsituation but he resolved he would die fighting, if die he must. Leon\nfumbled with the catch of the generator. It refused to operate. The\nforce that was drawing them upward had paralyzed all mechanisms aboard\nthe little aero. Flinging it from him in disgust he sprang for Peter.\n\nTheir minds befuddled, the rest of the men watched dully. The women\nhuddled together in a corner, whimpering. They were a sorry lot after\nall, thought Karl. He was no longer Peter Van Dorn, and he thrilled to\nthe joy of battle.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLeon Lemaire was no mean antagonist. His flailing arms were everywhere\nand a huge fist caught Karl on the side of his head and sent him\nreeling. But this only served to clear his mind further and to fill him\nwith a cold rage. He bored in unmercifully and Lemaire soon was on the\ndefensive. A blow to his midsection had him puffing and Karl hammered in\nrights and lefts to the now sinister face that rocked his opponent to\nhis heels. But the minion of the Zar was crafty. He slid to the floor as\nif groggy, then with catlike agility, dove for Karl's knees, bringing\nhim down with a crash.\n\nThe air whistled by them as the ship was drawn upward with ever-increasing\nspeed. The other passengers cowered in fright as the two men rolled over\nand over on the floor, banging at each other indiscriminately. Both\nwere hurt. Karl's lip was split, and bleeding profusely. One eye was\nclosing. But now he was on top and he pummeled his opponent to a pulp.\nLong after he ceased resisting them, the blows continued until the\nfeatures of Leon Lemaire were unrecognizable. The infuriated Karl did not\nsee that one of the members of the party was creeping up on him from\nbehind. Neither was he aware that the upward motion of the aero had\nceased and that they now hung motionless in space. A terrific blow at\nthe base of his skull sent him sprawling. Must have been struck by a\nrocket, one of those funny ships that crossed the ocean so quickly. A\nmillion lights danced before his aching eyeballs.\n\nLying prone across the inert body of his foe, dimly conscious and\nfingers clutching weakly, he knew that the cabin was filled with people.\nAlien voices bellowed commands. There was the screaming of women; the\nsound of blows; curses ... then all was silence and darkness.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was a far cry to the little book shop off Cooper Square, but Karl was\ncalling for Rudolph when he next awoke to the realization that he was\nstill in the land of the living. His head was bandaged and his tongue\nfurry. A terrible hangover. Then he heard voices and they were\ndiscussing Peter Van Dorn. He opened one eye as an experiment. The other\nrefused to open. But it might have been worse. At least he was alive; he\ncould see well enough with the one good optic.\n\n\"Sh-h!\" whispered one of the voices. \"He's recovering!\"\n\nHe looked solemnly into the eyes of an old man; a pair of wise and\ngentle eyes that reminded him somehow of Rudolph's.\n\n\"Quiet now, Peter,\" said the old man. \"You'll be all right in a few\nminutes. Banged up a bit, you are, but nothing serious.\"\n\n\"Don't call me Peter,\" objected Karl. He loathed the sound of the name;\nloathed himself for his recent thoughts and actions. \"I am Karl\nKrassin,\" he continued, \"and as such will remain until I die.\"\n\nThere were others in the room and he saw glances of satisfaction pass\nbetween them. This was a strange situation. These men were not of the\npurple. Neither were they of the gray. Their garments shone with the\nwhiteness of pure silver. And that's what they were; of finely woven\nmetallic cloth. Was he in another world?\n\n\"Very well, Karl.\" The kind old man was speaking once more. \"I merely\nwant you to know that you are among friends--your father's friends.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSurprised into complete wakefulness, Karl struggled to a seated position\nand surveyed the group that faced him. They were a fine looking lot,\nmostly older men, but there was a refreshing wholesomeness about them.\n\n\"My father?\" he faltered. \"He's not alive.\"\n\n\"No, my poor boy. Derek Van Dorn left this life at the hands of your\nuncle, Zar Boris. But we, his friends, are here to avenge him and to\nrestore to you his throne.\"\n\n\"But--but--I still do not understand.\"\n\n\"Of course not, because we've kept ourselves hidden from the world for\nmore than twenty-two years, waiting for this very moment. There are\nforty-one of us, including Rudolph, my brother. We have lived in the\njungle since Boris conquered the Eastern Hemisphere. But amongst our\nnumbers were several scientists, two greater than was Boris, even in his\nheyday. They have done wonderful things and we are now prepared to take\nback what was taken from Derek--and more. His life we can not\nrestore--Heaven rest him--but his kingdom we can. And to his son it\nshall be returned.\n\n\"You were given into Rudolph's care when little more than a babe in arms\nand he has cared for you well. We've watched, you know, in the\ndetectoscopes--long range radiovision mechanisms that can penetrate\nsolid walls, the earth itself, to bring to us the images and voices of\npersons who may be on the other side of the world. We've followed your\nevery move, my boy, and the first time we feared for you was yesterday\nwhen the drug of the Zar's physician stole away your sense of right and\nwrong. But we were in time to save you, and now we are ready to kneel at\nyour feet and proclaim you our king. First there is the Zar to be dealt\nwith and then we shall set up the new regime. Are you with us?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKarl gazed at the speaker in wonder. He a king? Always to live amongst\nthe wearers of the purple? To be responsible for the welfare of half the\nworld? It was unthinkable! But Zar Boris, the murderer of his own\nfather--he must be punished, and at the hands of the son!\n\n\"I'll do it,\" he said simply. \"That is, I'll do whatever you have\nplanned in the way of exterminating the Zar. Then we'll talk of the new\nempire. But how is the Zar to be overcome? I thought he was invincible,\nwith his Moon men and terrible weapons.\"\n\n\"Ah! That, my boy, is where our scientists have triumphed. True, his\nrays were terrible. They could not be combatted when he first returned.\nThe strange chemicals and gases of the Moon men defied analysis or\nduplication. His citadel atop the city of Dorn is proof against them\nall; proof against explosives and rays of all kinds known to him. The\ndisintegration and decomposition rays have no effect on the crystal of\nits walls. It is hermetically sealed from the outer air so can not be\ngassed. The vibration impulses have no effect upon its reinforced\nstructure. But there is a ray, a powerful destructive agent, against\nwhich it is not proof. And our scientists have developed this agency.\nYou shall have the privilege of pressing the release of the energy that\ndestroys the arch-fiend in his lair. His dominance over, the empire will\nfall. We shall take it--for you.\"\n\nA strange exaltation shone from the faces of those in the room, and Karl\nfound that it was contagious. His bosom swelled and he itched to handle\nthe controls of this wonderful ray.\n\n\"This ray,\" continued the brother of old Rudolph, \"carries the longest\nvibrations ever measured, the vibrations of infra-red, the heat-ray. We\nhave succeeded in concentrating a terrific amount of power in its\nproduction, and with it are able to produce temperatures in excess of\nthat of the interior of the earth, where all substances are molten or\ngaseous. The Zar's crystal palace cannot withstand it for a second. He\ncannot escape!\"\n\n\"How'll you know he's there at the time?\" Karl was greatly excited, but\nhe was curious too.\n\n\"Come with me, my boy. I'll show you.\" The old man led him from the room\nand the others followed respectfully.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey stopped at a circular port and Karl saw that they were high above\nthe earth in a vessel that hovered motionless, quivering with what\nseemed like human eagerness to be off.\n\n\"This vessel?\" he asked.\n\n\"It's a huge sphere; the base of our operations. To it we drew the aero\non which you were fighting. A magnetic force discovered by our\nscientists and differing only slightly from that used in counteracting\ngravity. We let the rest of them go; foolishly I think. But it's done\nnow and we have no fear. From this larger vessel we shall send forth\nsmaller ones, armed with the heat-ray. The flagship of the fleet is to\nbe yours and you'll lead the attack on Dorn. Here--I'll show you the\nZar.\"\n\nThey had reached the room of the detectoscopes--a mass of mechanisms\nthat reminded Karl of nothing so much as the vitals of the intermediate\nlevels which he had visited with Leon--and Rhoda. He knew that he\nflushed when he thought of her. What a fool he had been!\n\nA disc glowed as one of the silver-robed strangers manipulated the\ncontrols. The upper surface of Dorn swung into view. Rapidly the image\ndrew nearer and they were looking at the crystal pyramid that was the\nZar's palace. Down, down to its very tip they passed. Karl recoiled from\nthe image as it seemed they were falling to its glistening sides. The\nsensation passed. They were through, penetrating solid crystal, masonry,\nsteel and duralumin girders. Room after room was opened to their view.\nIt was magic--the magic of the upper levels.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNow they were in the throne room. A group of purple-clad men and women\nstood before the dais. Leon, Rhoda--all of his wild companions were\nthere, facing the dais. The Zar was raging and the words of his speech\ncame raucously to their ears through the sound-producing mechanism.\n\n\"You've failed miserably, all of you,\" he screamed. \"He's gotten away\nand you know the penalty. Taru--the vibrating ray!\"\n\nThe Moon man already was fussing with a gleaming machine, a machine with\nbristling appendages having metallic spheres on their ends, a machine in\nwhich dozens of vacuum tubes glowed suddenly.\n\nRhoda screamed. It was a familiar sound to Karl. He noted with\nsatisfaction that Leon could hardly stand on his feet and that his face\nwas covered with plasters. Then, startled, he saw that Leon was\nshivering as with the ague. His outline on the screen grew dim and\nindistinct as the rate of vibration increased. Then the body bloated and\nbecame misty. He could see through it. The vibrating death! His father\nhad gone the same way!\n\nKarl groaned at the thought. The whine of the distant machine rose in\npitch until it passed the limit of audibility. Tiny pin-points of\nincandescence glowed here and there from the Zar's victims as periods of\nvibration were reached that coincided with the natural periods of\ncertain of the molecules of their structure. They were no longer\nrecognizable as human beings. Shimmering auras surrounded them. Suddenly\nthey were torches of cold fire, weaving, oscillating with inconceivable\nrapidity. Then they were gone; vanished utterly.\n\nThe Zar laughed--that horrible cackle again.\n\n\"Great God!\" exclaimed Karl, \"let's go! The fiend must not live a moment\nlonger than necessary. Are you ready?\"\n\nRudolph's brother smiled. \"We're ready Karl,\" he said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe great vessel hummed with activity. The five torpedo-shaped aeros of\nthe battle fleet were ready to take off from the cavities in the hull.\nIn the flagship Karl was stationed at the control of the heat-ray. His\ninstructions in its operation had been simple. A telescopic sight with\ncrosshairs for the centering of the object to be attacked; a small\nlever. That was all. He burned with impatience.\n\nThen they were dropping; falling clear of the mother ship. The pilot\npressed a button and the electronic motors started. A burst of roaring\nenergy streamed from the tapered stern of their vessel and the earth\nlurched violently to meet them. Down, down they dived until the rocking\nsurface of Dorn was just beneath them. Then they flattened out and\ncircled the vast upper surface. From the corner of his eye Karl saw that\nthe other four vessels of his fleet were just behind. There was a flurry\namong the wasplike clouds of pleasure craft over the city. They scurried\nfor cover. Something was amiss!\n\n\"Hurry!\" shouted Karl. \"The warning is out! There is no time to lose!\"\n\nHe pressed his face to the eye-piece of his sight, his finger on the\nrelease lever of the ray. The crystal pyramid crossed his view and was\ngone. Again it crossed, more slowly this time. And now his sight was\ndead on it, the gleaming wall rushing toward him. Pressure on the tiny\nbutton. They'd crash into the palace in another second! But no, a\nbrilliant flash obscured his vision, a blinding light that made the sun\nseem dark by comparison. They roared on and upward. He took his eye from\nthe telescope and stared ahead, down. The city was dropping away, and,\nwhere the crystal palace had stood, there was a spreading blob of molten\nmaterial from which searing vapors were drifting. The roofs of the city\nwere sagging all around and great streams of the sparkling, sputtering\nliquid dripped into the openings that suddenly appeared. Derek Van Dorn\nwas avenged.\n\n\"Destroy! Destroy!\" yelled Karl madly. A microphone hung before him and\nhis words rang through every vessel of his convoy.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe lust of battle was upon him. A fleet of the Zar's aeros had risen\nfrom below; twenty of them at least. These would be manned by Moon\ncreatures, he knew, and would carry all of the dreadful weapons which\nhad originated on that strange body. But he did not know that his own\nships were insulated against most of the rays used by the Zar's forces.\nHe knew only that he must fight; fight and kill; exterminate every last\none of the Zar's adherents or be exterminated in the attempt.\n\nKill! Kill! The madness was contagious. His pilot was a marvel and drove\nhis ship straight for the massed ships of the foe. The air was vivid\nwith light-streamers. A ray from an enemy vessel struck the thick glass\nof the port through which he looked and the outer surface was shattered\nand pock-marked. But a cloud of vapor and a dripping stream of fiery\nliquid told him his own ray had taken effect on a vessel of the enemy.\nOne! They wheeled about and spiraled, coming up under another of the\nZar's aeros. It vanished in a puff of steam and they narrowly missed\nbeing covered by the falling remnants of incandescent liquid. Two!\nKarl's aim was good and he gloated in the fact. Three! They climbed and\nturned over, dropping again into the fray. Four!\n\nThe air grew stifling, for the expended energy of the enemies' rays must\nneeds be absorbed. It could not disintegrate them nor decompose their\nbodies, but the contacts were many and the liberation of heat enormous.\nThey were suffocating! But Karl would not desist. They drove on, now\nbeneath, now above an enemy ship. He lost count.\n\nOne of his own vessels was in trouble. The report came to him from the\nlittle speaker at his ear. He looked around in alarm. A glowing object\nreeled uncertainly over there between two of the aeros of the Zar. The\nconcentration of beams of vibrations was too much for the sturdy craft.\nIt was red hot and its occupants burned alive where they sat. Suddenly\nit slipped into a spin and went slithering down into the city, leaving a\ngaping opening where it fell. This sobered him somewhat, but he went\ninto the battle with renewed fury.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHow many had they brought down? Fifteen? Sixteen? He tore his purple\njacket from his body. The perspiration rolled from his pores. His own\nship would be next. But what did it matter? Kill! Kill! He shouted once\nmore into the microphone, then dived into battle. Another and another!\nIn Heaven's name, how many were there? It was maddening. If only he\ncould breathe. His lungs were seared; his eyes smarting from the heat.\nAnd then it was over.\n\nThree of the Zar's aeros remained, and these turned tail to run for it.\nNo! They were falling, nose down, under full power; diving into the city\nfrom which they had come. Suicide? Yes. They couldn't face the\nrecriminations that must come to them. And anything was better than\nfacing that burning death from the strange little fighters which had\ncome from out the skies. Dorn was a mass of wreckage.\n\nKarl tore at the fastenings of the ports, searing his fingers on the\nheated metal. His pilot had collapsed, the little aero heading madly\nskyward with no guiding hand. Air! They must have air! He loosened the\npilot's jacket; slapped frantically at his wrists in the effort to bring\nhim to consciousness. Then he was at the controls of the vessel, tugging\non first one, then the other. The aero circled and spun, executing the\nmost dangerous of sideslips and dives. A little voice was speaking to\nhim--the voice of the radio--instructing him. In a daze he followed\ninstructions as best he could. The whirlings of the earth stabilized\nafter a time and he found he was flying the vessel; climbing rapidly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA sense of power came to him as the little voice of the radio continued\nto instruct. Here were the controls of the electronic motor; there the\ngravity-energy. He was proceeding in the wrong direction. But what did\nit matter? He learned the meaning of the tiny figures of the altimeter;\nthe difference between the points of the compass. Still he drove on.\n\n\"East! Turn East!\" begged the little voice from the radio. \"You're\nheading west. Your speed--a thousand kilometers an hour--it's too fast.\nTurn back, Zar Peter!\"\n\nHe tore the loud speaker of the radio from its fastenings. West! He\nwanted to go west! On and on he sped, becoming more and more familiar\nwith the workings of the little vessel as he progressed. A cooling\nbreeze whistled from the opened ports, a breeze that smelled of the sea.\nHis heart sang with the wonder of it all. He could fly. And fly he did.\nZar Peter? Never! He knew now where he belonged; knew what he wanted.\nHe'd find the coast of North America. Follow it until he located New\nYork. A landing would be easy, for had not the voice instructed him in\nthe use of the gravity-energy? He'd make his way to the lower levels, to\nthe little book shop of Rudolph Krassin. A suit of gray denim awaited\nhim there and he'd never discard it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOnward he sped into the night, which was falling fast. He held to his\nwestward course like a veteran of the air lanes. The pilot had ceased to\nbreathe and Karl was sorry. Game little devil, that pilot. Have to shove\nhis body overboard. Too bad.\n\nRudolph's brother would understand. He'd be watching in the detectoscope.\nAnd the others--those who had wished to seat him on a throne--they'd\nunderstand, too. They'd have to!\n\nRudolph would forgive him, he knew. Paul Van Dorn--his own cousin--the\nsecret agents of the Zar would never locate him! Too many friends of\nRudolph's were of the red police.\n\nHe gave himself over to happy thoughts as the little aero sped on in the\ndarkness. Home! He was going home! Back to the gray denim, where he\nbelonged and where now he would remain content.\n\n\n\n\nThe Ape-Men of Xlotli\n\n_By David R. Sparks_\n\n  A beautiful face in the depths of a geyser--and Kirby plunges into\n  a desperate mid-Earth conflict with the dreadful Feathered\n  Serpent.\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nKirby did not know what mountains they were. He did know that the\nMannlicher bullets of eleven bad Mexicans were whining over his head and\nwhizzing past the hoofs of his galloping, stolen horse. The shots were\nmingled with yelps which pretty well curdled his spine. In the\ncircumstances, the unknown range of snow mountains towering blue and\nwhite beyond the arid, windy plateau, offering he could not tell what\ndangers, seemed a paradise. Looking at them, Kirby laughed harshly to\nhimself.\n\nAs he dug the heels of his aviator's boots into the stallion's flanks,\nthe animal galloped even faster than before, and Kirby took hope. Then\nmore bullets and more yelps made him think that his advantage might\nprove only temporary. Nevertheless, he laughed again, and as he became\naccustomed to the feel of a stallion under him, he even essayed a few\npistol shots back at the pack of frantic, swarthy devils he had fooled.\n\n[Illustration: _His head wavered back and forth and his hiss filled the\nnight._]\n\nThree hours ago he had been eating a peaceful breakfast with his friend\nand commandant, Colonel Miguel de Castanar, in the sunlit patio of the\ncommandant's hacienda. Castanar, chief of the air patrol for the\ndistrict, had waxed enthusiastic over the suppression of last spring's\nrevolutionists and the cowed state of up-country bandits. Captain\nFreddie Kirby, American instructor of flying to Mexican pilots in the\nmaking, had agreed with him and asked for one of the Wasps and three\ndays' leave with which to go visiting in Laredo. The simple matter of a\nbroken fuel line, a forced landing two hundred kilometres from nowhere,\nand the unlucky proximity of the not-so-cowed horsemen, were the things\nwhich had changed the day from what it had been to what it was.\n\nThe one piece of good fortune which had befallen him since the bandits\nhad surrounded the wrecked Wasp, looted it, and taken its lone pilot\nprisoner, was the break he was getting now. During the squadron's first\nhalt to feed, he had knocked down his guards and made a bolt for the\ngrazing stallion. So far, the attempt was proving worth while.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn and on the stallion lunged toward the white mountains. Kirby's eyes\nbecame red rimmed now from fatigue and the glare of the sun and the dust\nof the pitilessly bare plateau. A negligible scalp wound under his mop\nof straw-colored hair, slight as it was, did not add to his comfort. But\nstill he would not give up, for the horse, as if it sensed what its\nrider needed most, was making directly for a narrow ravine which\ndebouched on the plateau from the nearest mountain flank.\n\nIt was the promise of cover afforded by the jagged rocks and jungle\ngrowth of that ravine which kept hope alive in Kirby's throbbing brain.\n\nThe stallion was blown and staggering. Foam from the heavily bitted\nmouth flashed back in great yellow flakes against Kirby's dust-caked\naviator's tunic. But just the same, the five mile gallop had carried\nboth horse and rider beyond range of any but the most expert rifle shot.\nAnd Kirby knew that if his own splendid mount was almost ready to crash,\nthe horses of his pursuers must be in worse shape still. So for the\nthird time since the fight had begun, he laughed. This time there was no\nharshness, but only relief, in the sound which came from his dry lips.\n\nTen minutes later, he flung himself out of his saddle. Like the caress\nof a vast, soothing hand, the shadowed coolness of the ravine lay upon\nhim. As his feet struck ground, they splashed in the water overflowing\nfrom a spring at the base of an immense rock. At once Kirby dropped the\nreins on the stallion's neck, giving him his freedom, and as the horse\nlowered his head to drink, Kirby stooped also.\n\nThere was cover everywhere. Kirby's first move after pulling both\nhimself and the horse away from the spring, was to glance up the long,\ndeeply shaded canyon which he had entered--a gash hacked into the breast\nof the steep mountain as by a titanic ax. Then, reassured as to the\npossibilities for a defensive retreat, he glanced back toward the\ndazzling, bare plateau.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was what he saw taking place amongst the sombreroed bandits out there\nwhich made the grin of satisfaction fade from his broad mouth. His last\nglance backward, before bolting into the canyon mouth, had showed him a\nragged squadron of men left far behind, yet galloping after him still.\nBut now--\n\nPresently a puzzled frown made wrinkles in Freddie Kirby's wide\nsunburned forehead. He relaxed his grip upon the heavy Luger, which, in\nhis big hands, looked like a cap pistol, and rubbed his eyes.\n\nBut he was not mistaken. The horsemen had halted! Out there on the\nglaring, alkali-arid plateau, they were standing as still as so many\nstatues. Looking toward the canyon mouth which had swallowed their\nquarry, they certainly were, but they were halted as completely as men\nstruck dead.\n\n\"Huh,\" Kirby grunted, and scratched behind his ear.\n\nThe next second he swung around to look at his horse, uncertain what he\nwas going to do next, but aware of the fact that right now, with a lot\nof unknown country between himself and Castanar's sunlit patio, the\nstallion was going to be a friend in need.\n\nAs he turned, however, prepared to take up the loose reins, something\nelse happened. The stallion let out a neigh as shrill as a trumpet\nblast. As Kirby jumped, grabbed for the bridle, his fingers found empty\nair. Like a crazy animal the stallion leaped past him, barely missing\nhim. Out toward the plain the horse jumped, out and away from the shaded\ncanyon mouth, out toward the spot where other horses waited. And despite\nthe animal's blown condition, the speed he put into his retreat left\nKirby dazed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter a helpless, profanity-filled second, Kirby scratched behind his\near again. As certain as the fact that almost his sole hope of getting\nback to civilization depended upon the stallion, was the fact that the\nbrute did not intend to stop running until he dropped.\n\n\"Now what in the hell ever got into his crazy head?\" Kirby muttered\ngrimly.\n\nThen he turned around to glance up the shadow-filled slash of a canyon,\nand sniffed.\n\n\"Huh!\"\n\nFaintly in the air had risen an odor the like of which he had never\nencountered in his life. A combination, it was, of the unforgetable\nstench which hangs over a battlefield when the dead are long unburied,\nand of a fragrance more rare, more heady, more poignantly sweet than any\nessence ever concocted by Parisian perfumer.\n\nWith the drifting scent came a sound. Faint, carrying from a distance,\nthe rumble which Kirby heard was almost certainly that of a geyser.\n\nThere was no telling what had brought the troop of horsemen to a halt,\nbut after a time Kirby knew that the cause of his horse's sudden\ndeparture must have been a whiff of the strange perfume.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor a long time he stood still, watching the crazy stallion dwindle in\nsize, watching the line of unexpectedly timid bandits. Then, when it\nbecame apparent that the horsemen were going to stay put either until he\ncame out, or showed that he never was coming out, he shrugged, and swung\non his heel so that he faced up the canyon.\n\nThe odor was dying away now, and the geyser rumble was gone. In Kirby's\nheart came a mingled feeling of tense uneasiness and fascinated\ncuriosity. Momentarily he was almost glad that his horse _had_ bolted,\nand that his pursuers _were_ blocking any lane of retreat except that\noffered by the canyon. If things had been different, the queer behavior\nof the Mexicans, the unaccountable actions of his horse and the equally\nstrange growth of his own uneasiness might have made him uncertain\nwhether he would go up the canyon or not. Now it was the only thing to\ndo, and Kirby was glad because, fear or no fear, he wanted to go on.\n\n\"I wonder,\" he said out loud as he started, \"just what the denizens of\nFirst Street in Kansas would say to a layout like this!\"\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nAt the end of an hour he was still wondering.\n\nAt midday the canyon was chill and dank, lit only by a half light which\nat times dwindled to a deep dusk as the rock walls beetled together\nhundreds of feet above his head. Always when he stumbled through one of\nthe darkest passages, he heard and half saw immense gray bats flapping\nabove him. In the half-lit reaches, he hardly took a step without seeing\ngreat rats with gray coats, yellow teeth, and evil pink eyes. But rats\nand bats combined were not as bad as the snakes. They were almost white,\nand nowhere had he seen rattlers of such size. If his caution relaxed\nfor a second, they struck at him with fangs as long and sharp as\nneedles.\n\nThe tortured, twisted cedars, the paloverdi, occatilla, cholla, opunti,\nthrough which he edged his laborious way, all offered an almost animate,\narmed hostility.\n\nAltogether this journey was the least sweet he had taken anywhere. Yet\nhe went on.\n\nWhy had eleven Mexican bandits refused to advance even to within decent\nrifle range of the canyon's mouth? What was there about the putrid yet\ngorgeous perfume that had made the stallion go off his nut, so to\nspeak?\n\nAfter a time, Kirby veered away from a fourteen-foot rattler which\nflashed in a loathsome coil on his left hand. Hungry, weakened by all he\nhad been through since breakfast time, he plodded doggedly on.\n\nBut a moment later he stumbled past a twisted cedar, and then stopped,\nforgetting even the snakes.\n\nAt his feet lay the bleached skeleton of a man.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBeside the right hand, in a position which indicated that only the final\nrelaxation of death had loosened his grip upon a precious object, lay a\ncylinder, carefully carved, of rich, yellow gold.\n\nOf the science of anthropology Kirby knew enough to make him sure that\nthe dolicocephalic skull and characteristically shaped pelvic and thigh\nbones of the skeleton had belonged to a white man.\n\nAs for the cylinder--But he was not so sure what that was.\n\nRegardless of the dry swish of a rattler's body on the rocks behind\nhim, he lifted the object from the spot in which it had lain for no man\nknew how long. Of much the size and shape of an old-time cylindrical wax\nphonograph record, the softly gleaming thing weighed, he judged, almost\ntwo pounds.\n\nTwo pounds of soft, virgin gold of a quality as fine as any he had seen\namongst all the treasures brought out of Mexico, Yucatan, and Peru\ncombined!\n\nBut the gold was not the only thing. If Kirby was human enough to think\nin terms of treasure, he was also enough of an amateur anthropologist to\nhold his breath over the carvings on the yellow surface.\n\nFirst he recognized the ancient symbols of Sun and Moon. And then a\nrepresentation, semi-realistic, semi-conventionalized, of Quetzalcoatl,\nthe Feathered Serpent, known in all the annals of primitive Mexican\nreligions.\n\nGood enough.\n\nBut the mere symbols by no means told the whole story of the cylinder.\nThe workmanship was archaic, older than any Aztec art Kirby knew, older\nthan Toltec, older far, he ventured to guess, than even earliest archaic\nMayan carvings.\n\nGod, what a find!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor a moment it seemed almost impossible that he, Freddie Kirby, native\nof Kansas, unromantic aviator, should have been the one to discover this\nrelic of an unknown, lost race. Yet the cylinder of gold was there, in\nhis hand.\n\nAfter a long minute Kirby looked around him, then listened.\n\nFrom up the canyon came the provocative rumble of the geyser. It was\ncloser now, and Kirby, glancing at his watch which had been spared to\nhim in the Wasp's crash, noted that just forty-four minutes had passed\nsince the last eruption. There was nothing to be done about the bleached\nskeleton. So, tucking the precious cylinder into his tunic, Kirby\nheaded on up the gash of a canyon.\n\nFar away indeed seemed the neat, maple-shaded asphalt street, the rows\nof parked cars and farm wagons, the telephone office and drug store and\nbank, of the Kansas town where he had grown up.\n\nTime passed until again he heard the geyser, and again was dizzied by\nthe perfume. As the fragrance--close and powerful now--died away, he\nflailed with one arm at a two-foot bat which flapped close to his head.\n\nAnd then he trudged his dogged way around a deeply shadowed bend, and\nfound the chasm not only almost wholly dark, but narrower than it had\nbeen at any previous point.\n\n\"Holy mackerel,\" Kirby groaned. \"Phew! If this keeps up, I--\"\n\nHe stopped. His jaw dropped.\n\n\"Oh, hell!\"\n\nThe beetling walls narrowed in until the gash was scarcely fifteen feet\nwide. Further progress was barred by a smooth wall which rose sheer in\nfront of him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKirby did not know how many seconds passed before he made out through\nthe gloom that the wall was man-made and carved with the same symbols of\nSun, Moon, and Feathered Serpent, which ornamented the cylinder of gold.\nBut when he did realize at last, the shout with which he expressed his\nfeeling was anything but a groan.\n\nIt simply meant that the skeleton which once had been a man, had almost\nsurely found the golden cylinder beyond the wall and not in the canyon.\nAnd if the dead man had passed that smooth, carved barrier, another man\ncould do it!\n\nKirby jumped forward, began to search in the darkness for some hidden\nentrance.\n\nMinute after minute passed. He gave another cry. He saw a long, upright\ncrack in the stone surface, and a quick push of his hands made the\nstones in front of him give almost an inch.\n\nAll at once his shoulder was planted, and behind that square shoulder\nwas straining all the muscle of his two hundred pound body. The result\nwas all that he desired. When he ceased pushing, a slab of rock gaped\nwide before him, giving entrance to a pitch dark tunnel.\n\nFor a moment he held the portal back, then, releasing his pressure, he\nstepped into the dark passage. By the time a ponderous grating of rocks\nassured him that the door had swung shut of its own weight, he had\nproduced matches and struck a light.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe puny flame showed him a curving passage hewn smoothly through the\nheart of bedrock. Before the flare died he walked twenty feet, and as\nanother match burned to his fingers, he found the right hand curve of\nthe passage giving way to a left hand twist. After that he dared use no\nmore of his precious matches. But just when the darkness was beginning\nto wear badly on his nerves, he uttered a low cry.\n\nAs he increased his rapid walk to a run, the faint light he had suddenly\nseen ahead of him grew until it became a circular flare of daylight\nwhich marked the tunnel's end.\n\nOut of the passage Kirby strode with shoulders square and head up, his\ncool, level, practical blue eyes wide with wonder. Out of the tunnel he\nstrode into the valley of the perfumed geyser.\n\n\"God above!\"\n\nThe words were vibrant with hoarse reverence. He saw the sunlight of a\ncliff-surrounded diminutive Garden of Eden. He saw a vale of flowering\ngrass, of palms and live oaks, saw patches of lilies so huge as to\ntranscend belief, and dizzying clumps of tree cactus almost as tall as\nthe palms themselves.\n\nWhat was more, he saw in the center of this upland, cliff-guarded\nvalley, a gaping black orifice which every faculty of judgment told him\nwas the mouth of the geyser of perfume. And beside it, outstretched on a\nsmooth sheet of rock which glistened as though coated with a layer of\nclear, sparkling glass, he saw--\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKirby blinked his eyes rapidly, hardly believing what he saw.\n\nOn the glistening rock lay the perfectly preserved figure of a Spanish\nConquistadore in full armor. Morion and breast-plate were in place, and\nglistened as though they had been burnished this morning. And the\nSpaniard's dark, handsome, bearded face! Kirby saw instantly that no\ndecay had touched it, that even the hairs of the beard were perfect. The\nwhole armor-clad corpse gleamed softly with a covering of the same\nglassy substance which covered the rock.\n\nKirby glanced at his watch, saw that twelve minutes must elapse before\nthe geyser spouted again. Then his eyes narrowed. He remained standing\nwhere he was, hard by the mouth of the tunnel, knowing that a wise man\nwould conduct cautiously his exploration of this valley of wonders.\n\nArsenic! Silicon!\n\nThe two words stood out sharply in his thought. In Africa existed plenty\nof springs whose waters contained enough arsenic to bring death to those\nwho drank. Might not the Spaniard's presence here be explained, then, by\nassuming that the geyser water was charged with a strong arsenic\ncontent, and, in addition, with some sort of silicon solution which,\nleft to dry in the air, hardened to glass?\n\nLord, what a discovery to take back with him to Kansas! Almost it made\nthe discovery of the golden cylinder pale by comparison. Why, the\ncommercial uses to which this silicon water might be put were almost\nwithout limit, and the owner of the concession might confidently expect\nto make millions!\n\nIt was while Kirby stood there, breathless and jubilant, waiting for\nthe geyser to spout, that he began to feel that _he was being watched_.\n\nSuddenly, with a start, he shot a sweeping glance over the whole grove.\nBut that did no good. He saw nothing save sunlight and waving green\nleaves.\n\nEleven days were to pass before he discovered all that was to be\ninvolved in that sensation of being gazed at by unseen eyes.\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nAt the beginning of the eleventh morning in the valley, Kirby had again\nposted himself close to the mouth of the black tunnel, and again felt\nthat hidden eyes were observing him.\n\nBut this morning differed from the first morning, because now, for the\nfirst time, he was ready to do something about the watcher or watchers.\nExploration of the whole valley had not helped. Therefore, there lay at\nhis feet a considerable coil of rope, the manufacture of which from\nplaited strands of the tough grass in his Eden had taken him whole days.\nWith what patience he could find, he was waiting for the gigantic spout\nof milky-colored, perfumed water which would mean that the geyser had\ngone off and would erupt no more for exactly forty-four minutes.\n\nEleven days in the valley!\n\nWhile he waited, Kirby considered them. Who had made the beautiful\nfootprints beside him, when he had slept at last after his arrival here?\nWhy had so many of the queer, fuzzy topped shrubs with immense\nyam-shaped roots, which grew here been taken away during that first\nsleep, and during all his other periods of sleep? Who had taken them?\nEarly in his stay, he had learned that the tuberlike roots were good to\neat and would sustain life, and he supposed that the unseen people of\nthe valley took them for food. But who were these people of the valley?\n\nWho had laid beside him during his first sleep the immense lily with\nperfume like that which came with the milky geyser spray--that spray of\ndeath and delight mingled? Why had someone scratched a line in the earth\nfrom him directly to the distant orifice of the geyser? Was this, as he\nbelieved, a signal to come not only to the edge of the orifice, _but to\nlower himself down into its depths_? And if the line were intended as a\nsignal, did the persons who came to the valley while he slept, always\neluding him, wish him well or mean to do him harm?\n\nLast question of all: had the beautiful girl's face he believed he had\nseen just once, been real or an hallucination? It had been while he was\nkneeling at the very edge of the geyser cone, staring down its many\ncolored throat, that the vision had appeared. Misty white amidst the\ngreen gloom, the face had been turned up to him, smiling, its lips\nforming a kiss, and its great eyes beckoning. Had the face been real or\na dream?\n\nEleven days in the valley! Now, with his braided rope ready at last, he\nwas going to do something which might help to answer his questions.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKirby reached out and began to run his grass rope, yard by yard, through\nhis hands, searching carefully for any flaw. A canyon wren made the air\nsweet above him, while the morning sun began to wink and blink against\nthe shadows which still lay against the face of the guardian cliffs.\nKirby glanced at his watch and got up.\n\nCrossing beyond the mouth of the geyser, he grinned good morning at his\nfriend the Conquistadore, and marched on into the shade of the live oak\nwhich grew nearest the geyser. Here he made one end of his rope fast to\nthe gnarled trunk, inspected his pistol, patted his tunic to make sure\nthat the cylinder of gold was safe, then stood by to await the geyser.\n\nWith the passing of three minutes there came from the still empty\norifice a sonorous rumbling. Kirby grinned.\n\nFrom deep in the earth issued a sound of fizzing and bubbling, and\nthen, to the accompaniment of subterranean thunder, burst loose the\nmilky, upward column which had never ceased to awe the man who watched\nso eagerly this morning. As the titanic jet leaped skyward now, the\nslanting rays of the sun caught it, and turned the water, fanning out,\ninto a fire opal, into a sheet of living color.\n\nKirby, hard headed to the last, drew from the supply in one pocket of\nhis tunic, a strip of one of the tuberlike roots, and munched it.\n\nThe thunder ceased. The waters receded.\n\nAfter that Kirby hesitated not a second. Promptly he moved forward,\nflung his coil of line down into the geyser tunnel, and swung on to the\nline. By the time he had swallowed the last bite of his breakfast, the\nworld he knew had been left behind, and he was climbing down to a new.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt became at once apparent that the gorgeously colored, glassy-smooth\nthroat glowed with tints which were unfamiliar to him. He could perceive\nthese new shades of color, yet had no name for them.\n\nAs he stopped after fifty feet to breathe, the color phenomenon made him\nwonder if the tuber roots he had been eating had affected his vision;\nthen decided they had not. In addition to food value, the roots had some\npower to stimulate courage and a slight mental exhilaration. But the\ndrug had proved non-habit forming, and Kirby knew that his powers of\nperception were not now, and never had been, affected.\n\nHe swung down further.\n\nJust a moment after he began that progress was when things began to\nhappen to him. First he heard what seemed to be the low titter of a\nhuman voice laughing sweetly. Next came a far off, unutterably lovely\nstrumming of music. And then he realized that, at a depth of about a\nhundred feet, he was hanging level with a hole which marked the mouth\nof another tunnel.\n\nThis new tunnel sloped down into the earth on his right hand. The floor\nand walls were glassy smooth, and the angle of descent was steep, but by\nno means as steep as the drop of the vertical geyser shaft in which he\nnow hung.\n\nLaughter, music, the new tunnel suddenly aroused an excitement which\nmade him quiver.\n\n\"When I saw _her_,\" he gasped, \"she was standing here, in the mouth of\nthis tunnel, looking up at me!\"\n\nViolently, Freddie Kirby forgot the maple-shaded street of his Kansas\ntown, forgot everything but desire to reach the mouth of the new tunnel,\nwhere the girl of the exquisite face and beckoning lips had stood.\nTightening his grip on the rope, he began to swing himself back and\nforth like a pendulum.\n\nIt seemed probable that when the geyser water shot up past the\nhorizontal tunnel, its force was so great that no water at all entered.\nHe redoubled his efforts to widen his swing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen his feet scraped on the floor, and in a second he had alighted\nthere. He still hung stoutly to his line, however, for the tunnel sloped\ndown sharply enough, and was slippery enough, to prohibit the\nmaintenance of footing unaided.\n\nThe music which issued from the depths of that stunningly mysterious\npassage swelled to a crescendo--and stopped. Kirby clung there to his\nprecarious perch, his feet slipping on the glass under them with every\nmove he made, and feelings stirred in his heart which had never been\nthere before.\n\nThen, as silence reigned where the music had been, something prompted\nhim to look up. The next instant he stifled a cry.\n\nWith widening eyes he saw the flash of a white arm and the gleam of a\nknife hovering over the spot where his taut rope passed out of the\ngeyser opening into the sunshine of the outer world. Again he stifled a\ncry. For crying out would do no good. While the suppressed sound was\nstill on his lips, the knife flickered.\n\nThen Kirby was shooting downward, the severed line whipping out after\nhim. The first plunge flung him off his feet. A long swoop which he took\non his back dizzied him. But as the fall continued, he was able to slow\nit a little by bracing arms and legs against the tunnel walls.\n\n\"Holy Jeehosophat!\" he gurgled.\n\nBut there seemed to be no particular danger. The slide was as smooth as\nmost of the chutes he had ever encountered at summer swimming pools. If\never the confounded spiral passage came to an end, he might find that he\nwas still all right. As seconds passed and he fell and fell, it seemed\nthat he was bound for the center of the earth. It seemed that--\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe swished around a multiple bend, and eyes which had been accustomed to\ndarkness were blinded by light.\n\nIt was light which radiated in all colors--blue, yellow, browns,\npurples, reds, pinks, and then all the new colors for which he had no\nname. Somehow Kirby knew that he had shot out of the tunnel, which\nemerged high up in the face of a cliff, and that he was dropping through\nperfumed, brilliant air resonant with the sound of birds and insects and\nhuman cries. The funny thing was that the pull of gravity was not right,\nsomehow, and he was dropping fairly slowly. From far below, a body of\nwhat looked like water was sweeping up to meet him. Kirby closed his\neyes.\n\nWhen he opened them again, his whole body was stinging with the slap of\nhis impact, and he found that it was water which he had struck. The\nproof of it lay in the fact that he was swimming, and was approaching a\nshore.\n\nBut such water! It was milky white and perfumed as the geyser flow had\nbeen, and it seemed luminous as with a radium fire. Had he not realized\npresently that the fluid probably contained enough arsenic to finish a\nthousand like him, he would have thought of himself as bathing in the\nwaters of Paradise.\n\nBut then he began to forget about the poison which might already be at\nwork upon him.\n\nAhead of him, stretched out in the gorgeous, colored light, ran a beach\nwhich was backed by heavy jungle. And on the beach stood the lovely\ncreatures, all clad in shimmering, glistening garments, whose flutelike\ncries had come to him as he fell.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKirby looked, and became almost powerless to continue his swim. The\nbeauty of those frail women was like the reputed beauty of bright\nangels. That paralyzing effect of wonder, however, did not last long.\n\nThe girls moved forward to the water's edge, and, laughing amongst\nthemselves, beckoned to him with lovely slender hands whose every motion\nwas a caress.\n\n\"Be not afraid,\" called one in a curious patois dialect, about\nfive-sixths of which seemed made up of Spanish words, distorted but\nrecognizable.\n\n\"The water would kill you,\" called another, \"as it killed the Spaniard\nin armor. But we are here to save you. I will give you a draught to\ndrink which will defeat the poison. Come on to us!\"\n\nKirby's heart was almost literally in his mouth now, because the girl\nwho promised him salvation was she whose lips had formed a kiss at him\nfrom the green-gloomy throat of the geyser.\n\nHis feet struck a shale bottom. Panting, he stood up and was conscious\nof the fact that despite his forlornly dripping and dishevelled\ncondition, he was tall and straight and big, and that for some reason\nall of the girls on the gleaming sand, and one girl in particular, were\nanxious to receive him here.\n\nThe one girl had drawn a small, gleaming flask of gold from the misty\nbodice of her gown, and was holding it out while she laughed with red\nlips and great, dazzling dark eyes.\n\n\"_Pronto!_\" she called in pure Spanish, and other girls echoed the word.\n\"Oh,\" went on the bright owner of the flask, \"we thought you would\n_never_ have done with your work on the rope. It took you so long!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKirby left the smooth lake behind him and stood dripping on the sand.\nThe moment the air touched his clothes, he felt that they were\nstiffening slightly. Yet the sensation brought no terror. He could not\nfeel terror as he faced the girls.\n\n\"Give him the flask, Naida!\" someone exclaimed.\n\n\"Ah, but the Gods _have_ been kind to us!\" echoed another.\n\nThe girl with the flask made a gesture for silence.\n\n\"Is it Naida you are called?\" Kirby put in quickly, and as he spoke the\nSpanish words, the roll of them on his tongue did much to make him know\nthat he was sane and awake, and not dreaming, that this was still the\nTwentieth Century, and that he was Freddie Kirby.\n\nAnswering his question, Naida nodded, and gave him the flask.\n\n\"A single draught will act as antidote to the poison,\" she said.\n\n\"I drink,\" said Kirby as he raised the flask, \"to the many of you who\nhave been so gracious as to save me!\"\n\nA flashing smile, a blush was his answer. And then he had wetted his\nlips with, and was swallowing, a limpid liquid which tasted of some\ndrug.\n\n\"Enough!\" Naida ordered in a second.\n\nAs she reached for the flask, her companions closed in as though a\nceremony of some sort had been completed.\n\n\"Is it time to tell him yet, Naida?\" piped one of the girls, younger\nthan the rest, whom someone had called Elana.\n\n\"Oh, _do_ begin, Naida,\" chorused two more. \"We can't wait _much_ longer\nto find out if he is going to help us!\"\n\nKirby turned to Naida, while a soothing sensation crept through him from\nthe draught he had taken.\n\n\"Pray tell me what it is that I am to be permitted to do for you. I\ncan promise you that the whole of my life and strength, and such\nintelligence as I possess, is yours to command.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nExcited small cries and a clapping of hands answered him. As for Naida,\nher face lighted with glowing joy.\n\n\"Oh, one who could say that, _must_ be the friend and protector of whom\nwe have stood in such bitter need!\"\n\n\"What,\" asked Kirby, \"is this need which made one of you cut my rope, so\nthat I should come here?\"\n\nA momentary silence was broken only by the hum of insects in the\nperfumed air, and by the golden thrilling of a bird back in the jungle.\nThen Kirby beheld Naida bowing to him.\n\n\"So be it,\" she said in a voice low and flutelike. \"I will speak now\nsince you request it. Already you have seen that you are here in our\nworld because we conspired amongst ourselves to bring you here. Our\nreason--\"\n\nShe paused, looked deep into his eyes.\n\n\"Amigo,\" she continued slowly, \"we whom you see here are the People of\nthe Temple. For more centuries than even our sages can tell, our\nprogenitors have dwelt here, where you find us, knowing always of your\nouter world, but remaining always unknown by it. But now the time has\ncome when those of us who are left amongst our race need the help of one\nfrom the outer races we have shunned. Dangers of various orders confront\nus who have waited here for your coming. When we first discovered you in\nthe Valley of the Geyser, the idea came to me that we must make you\nunderstand our troubles, and ask of you--\"\n\nBut then she stopped.\n\nAs Kirby stared at her, the gentleness of her expression was replaced by\na swift strength which made her majestic.\n\nThe next moment bedlam reigned upon the beach.\n\n\"_They are after us!_\" gasped one of the girls in terror. \"Quick, Naida!\nQuick! Quick!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhatever it was that threatened, Naida did not need to be told that the\nneed for action was pressing. She shouted at her companions some order\nwhich Kirby did not understand. From a pouch at her side, she snatched\nout a greyish, spherical vegetable substance which looked almost like a\ntennis ball. Then she braced herself as if to withstand an assault.\n\n\"Stand back!\" she cried to Kirby.\n\nHe had long ago ceased to wonder at anything that might happen here.\nDisappointed that Naida's story had been interrupted, wondering what was\nwrong, he obeyed Naida's order to keep clear.\n\nAs he fell back and stood motionless, there came from behind a dense\nscreen of shrubs which would have resembled aloe and prickly pear\nbushes, save that they were as big as oak trees, a ghastly howling. The\nnext second, hopped and hurtled across the beach toward the girls, a\ngroup of hair-covered, shaggy creatures which were neither apes nor men.\nThe faces, contorted with lust, were hideously leathery and brown, the\nforeheads small and beetling, and the mouths enormous, with immense\nyellow teeth.\n\nHelpless, Kirby realized that Naida and all the others had clapped over\ntheir faces curious masks which seemed to be made of some crystalline\nsubstance, and that now others had armed themselves with the tennis\nballs. And that was the last observation he made before the battle\nopened furiously.\n\nWith a cry muffled behind her mask, Naida leaped out in front of her\nsquadron and cut loose her queer vegetable ball with whizzing aim and\nforce.\n\nFull into the snarling face of one of the ape-men the thing smashed,\nfilling the air all about the creature with a yellow, mistlike powder.\nKirby was half deafened by the yells of rage and terror which went up\nfrom the entire attacking band. The creature who had been hit fell to\nhis knees the while he made agonized tearing movements at his face and\nuttered shrill, jabbering yelps.\n\nOther balls flashed instantly from Naida's ranks, and each brought about\nthe same ghastly result as the first. But then Kirby saw that the whole\njungle seethed with the hairy, awful men.\n\n\"Keep back!\" Naida shrieked at him through her mask. \"We have no mask\nfor you. If the powder from our fungi touches you, it will be the end!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith gaps in the advancing line filled as soon as each screeching ape\nwent down, the attackers leaped on until Kirby knew they would be upon\nthe girls in a matter of seconds. A sweat broke out on his neck.\n\nBut then an idea gripped him, and suddenly, without even a last glance\nat Naida, he leaped away even as she had commanded.\n\nA great boulder lay on the shore fifty yards away. Toward it Kirby\nstreaked as though he had become coward. But he had not turned coward.\n\nBy the time he reached the shelter which would protect him from the\nfungus mist, a turning point had come in the battle. The ape-men had\nclosed in on the girls, were swarming about them, and the mist balls had\nalmost ceased to fly. But the thing which gave Kirby hope was that the\napes were not attempting to harm the girls. They seemed victors, but\nthey were not committing atrocities.\n\nIt was the sharp intuition that something like this might happen which\nhad sent Kirby fleeing from the fight. He believed he might yet prove\nuseful.\n\nThe thickest group of attackers were jostling about Naida. As the\nscreams and sobs of the girls quivered out, mingled with the guttural\nroaring of the men, Naida was shut off by a solid wall of aggressors.\n\nThen Kirby saw her again. But now two of the most powerful of the\nape-men had caught her up and was carrying her. Her kicking and writhing\nand biting accomplished nothing. The apes were headed directly back to\nthe jungle.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNow, however, most of the yellow mist had disappeared, and that was all\nKirby had been waiting for. With a growling shout, he tore out from\nbehind his boulder, his Luger ready. Naida's captors were in full\nretreat, and other pairs of men were snatching up other girls and\nhopping after them. Toward Naida Kirby ran madly but not blindly.\n\n\"Naida! Naida!\" he bellowed.\n\nHe got in two strides for every one the apes made.\n\n\"Naida!\" he shouted, and at last saw her look at him.\n\nHer face was pallid with loathing and terror. As her glimmering dark\neyes met his, they flashed a plea which made his heart thrash against\nhis lungs.\n\nWith a final roar of encouragement Kirby closed in on the hair-covered\nmen, and fired instantly a shot which caught one full in the heart. The\ncreature wavered on its legs, looked at the unexpected enemy with\ndismayed, swinish little red eyes, and relaxing his hold upon Naida,\ndropped without making a sound.\n\nAfter that--\n\nBut suddenly Kirby found himself unable to comprehend fully the other\nterrific results of his intervention. Before the echoes of his shot\ndied, there came to him the rumble of what seemed to be tons of falling\nrock. In the bright air a slight mist was precipitated. To all of which\nwas added the effect upon the ape-men of fear of a weapon and a type of\nfighter utterly new to them.\n\nKirby had fired believing that he would have to fight other ape-men\nwhen the first fell. But not so. Instead of that--\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe blinked rapidly as he took in the scene.\n\nNaida had been released. Lying on the sand beside the dead ape-man, she\nwas looking up at him in stupefied wonder. And her other captor, instead\nof remaining to fight, had clapped shaggy hands over his ears, and was\nleaping headlong for the protection of the jungle!\n\nMoreover, the soprano cries of the girls and the deep howls of the men\nwere rising everywhere, and everywhere the ape-men were dropping their\ncaptives and plunging away after their leader.\n\n\"Huh,\" Kirby muttered aloud, and wondered what the citizens of Kansas\nwould have to say about _this_.\n\nNaida looked at the dead and bleeding ape-man and shuddered, and then at\nthe score or so of others brought down by the puff balls. Then she\nlooked up at Kirby, raised her arms for his support, and smiled up into\nhis brown face.\n\nKirby forgot Kansas, lifted her, warm and alive, radiantly beautiful, in\nhis arms.\n\n\"Our friends the enemies,\" she whispered as she remained for a second in\nhis embrace and then drew away, \"will attack no more this day--thanks to\nyou.\"\n\nThere was no possible need for another shot, Kirby saw. In terrified\nsilence, the first of the apes had already floundered behind the prickly\npear and aloe bushes, and the last stragglers were using all the power\nin their legs to catch up. On the beach, Naida's followers were picking\nthemselves up, and already a few of them had burst into ringing\nlaughter.\n\n\"Come on, all of you,\" Naida said to them, and, including Kirby in her\nglance, added, \"We may as well go to the caciques now, and have it over\nwith.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nIt was with Naida at his side and the other girls grouped about them,\nthat they started their journey to the \"caciques,\" whoever they might\nbe, \"to have it over with,\" whatever that might mean. As they strode\nalong in silence, Kirby did what he could to straighten out in his mind\nthe many curious things which had happened since he sat testing his rope\nin the upper world this morning.\n\nIn final analysis, it seemed to him that, extraordinary as his\nexperience had been, there was nothing so much out of the way about it,\nafter all. The only unusual thing was the existence of this inhabited\npocket in the earth. For the rest, the strange colors to which he could\nnot put a name, were simply some manifestation of infra-reds and\nultra-violets. And then the startling effect of his single shot at the\nape-men--that was simply the old story of savage creatures running from\na new weapon and a new enemy; naturally the shot had sounded loud in\nthis enclosed cavern. Lastly, the pull of gravity down here seemed upset\nsomehow. But why should it not seem so, at this distance within the\nearth? The American was no scientist; the conclusions he reached seemed\nvery reasonable to him.\n\nAll told, the last thing Kirby found he needed to do was pinch himself\nto see if he was awake.\n\nA place of indefinite extent, the cavern seemed to be exactly what he\nhad already judged it--a giant pocket within the earth. The ceiling, or\nthe sky, was of some kind of natural glass--no doubt the same kind which\nwas crackling on his clothes now--and from it emanated the brilliant,\nmany colored glow which lighted the cavern. Radium? Perhaps it was that.\nPerhaps the rays were cast off from some other element even less\nunderstood than mysterious radium. As for the plant and animal life with\nwhich the cavern teemed, it was amazing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut Kirby did not give himself up to silent observation any longer.\n\n\"Will you finish telling me,\" he asked of Naida, \"about the task I am to\nperform for you here?\"\n\nNaida, walking with lithe strides along a path jungle-hemmed on both\nsides, smiled at him.\n\n\"You are to be our leader.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\nNow both Naida and the other girls became sober.\n\n\"You will lead us in a revolt.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" Kirby whistled softly.\n\n\"In a revolt against the caciques--the wise men--whose kind have\ngoverned the People of the Temple since the beginning.\"\n\nHer statement was received with acclaim by the whole troop, who crowded\nclose around, the while they smiled at Kirby.\n\n\"You mean I am to lead a revolt,\" he asked, \"against these same caciques\nwhom we are going now to face?\"\n\nNaida nodded emphatically.\n\n\"Yes, if revolt proves necessary. And it probably will.\"\n\n\"Hum.\" Kirby scratched behind his ear. \"You'd better tell me what you\ncan about it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen, as they hurried on, Naida spoke rapidly.\n\nThe situation before the People of the Temple was that for a long time\nnow, the only children to be born had been girls. Worse still, not even\na girl had been born during a period equal to sixteen upper-world years.\nThe only remaining members of a race which had flourished in this\nunderground land for countless thousands of years, consisted of the\ncaciques, a handful of aged people, and the thirty-four girls, including\nNaida, who accompanied Kirby now.\n\nOn one hand was promised extinction through lack of reproduction. On the\nother, even swifter and more terrible extinction at the hands of the\nape-men, whom Naida called the Worshippers of Xlotli, the Rabbit God,\nthe God of all bestiality and drunkenness.\n\nIt was the menace of the ape-men, rather than the less appalling one of\nlack of reproduction, which was making the most trouble now. Ages ago,\nwhen the People of the Temple had flourished as a race, they had been\nuntroubled by the Worshippers of Xlotli. But now the ape-men were by far\nthe stronger; and they desired the girls who had been born as the last\ngeneration of an ancient race. The battle of this morning had been only\none of many.\n\nDissension between the caciques, who ruled the People of the Temple, and\ntheir girl subjects, had arisen on the subject of the best way of\ndealing with the ape-man menace.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSome time ago, Naida, heading a council of all the girls, had proposed\nto the caciques that support be sought amongst the people of the upper\nworld. This would be done judiciously, by bringing to the lower realm a\nfew men who were wise and strong, men who would make good husbands, and\nwho could fight the ape-men.\n\nThis proposal the priests had promptly quashed. They would never\nreceive, they said, any members of the teeming outer races from whom the\nPeople of the Temple had so long been hidden. Those few who had\nblundered into the Valley of the Geyser during the centuries, and who\nhad never escaped, were enough. Better, said the caciques, that a\ncompromise be arranged with the subjects of the Rabbit God.\n\nFlatly then, the priests had proposed that some of the girls, the number\nto be specified later, should be given to the ape-men, and peace won.\nDuring the time of reprieve which would thus be afforded, prayers and\nsacrifices could be offered the Lords of the Sun and Moon, and to\nQuetzalcoatl, the Feathered Serpent. In answer to these prayers, the\nGods would surely send the aged people who alone were left as\nprospective parents, a generation of sons.\n\nOnce the priests' program of giving up some of the girls to the ape-men\nhad been made definite, it had not taken Naida and the others long to\ndecide that they would never submit. And then, while matters were at an\nacute stage, a tall, blond white man had come to the Valley of the\nGeyser--Kirby.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs Naida had finished her story, Kirby mustered a smile despite the\nsoberness which had come upon him.\n\n\"So the white man came,\" he repeated after her, \"and all of you decided\nforthwith to stage your revolt.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" Naida answered. \"We observed you until we were sure you\npossessed the qualities of leadership we wanted. After that, we did what\nwe could to coax you to come here.\"\n\nKirby grinned at that.\n\n\"Now,\" Naida ended simply, \"we will go to the caciques. If they accept\nyou, and grant our requests to them, there will be peace. If they rage,\nit will be war.\"\n\nSuddenly she drew closer to Kirby as they swung along, and slipped her\nhand into his, looking up at him in silent entreaty.\n\n\"How much farther,\" he asked in a voice which became sharp, \"until we\nreach the headquarters of these caciques?\"\n\n\"They live in a castle which our ancestors built ages ago on a protected\nplateau,\" Naida answered tensely. \"It is a good distance still, but we\nwill cover it soon enough.\"\n\nThey crossed now one edge of a shadow-filled forest composed principally\nof immense, pallid palmlike trees. Farther on, the path wound through a\nbelt of swampy land covered by gigantic reeds which rustled above their\nheads with a glassy sound, and by things which looked like the cat-tails\nof the upper world, but were a hundred times larger. Everywhere hovered\nodd little creatures like birds, but with teeth in their long snouts and\nsmall frondlike growths on each side of their tails. About some swamp\nplants with very large blooms resembling passion flowers, flitted dragon\nflies of jeweled hues and enormous size, and under the flowers hopped\nstrange toadlike creatures equipped with two pair of gauzy wings.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFinally, through a tunnel composed of ferns a hundred feet high, they\nemerged to a still densely overgrown but higher country which Naida said\nwas a part of the Rorroh forest.\n\nIn the forest, Kirby gained a hazy impression of bronzy, immense cycads\nand what appeared to be tree chrysophilums with gorgeous blossoms. Then\nhe received a much clearer impression of other trees with blossoms of\nbright orange yellow and very thick petals, each tipped with a glassy\nsharp point. The disconcerting thing about the tree was that, as they\napproached, the scaly limbs began to tremble and wave, and suddenly\nlashed out as though making a human effort to snatch at the bright\ntravelers.\n\nNaida and all the others hurried along without offering comment, and\nKirby asked no questions.\n\nOnce he thought he saw a group of gorilla creatures parallelling their\ncourse back amongst the forest growth, but if Naida observed the\nanimals, she paid no attention. The one thing which had any effect upon\nthe company was the appearance, presently, of two vast, birdlike\ncreatures. As these things approached, Naida signaled to all to crouch\nbeneath the shelter of a tall rock beside the path.\n\nEnormous, the birds had bat wings, and carried with them, as they\napproached, the stink of putrid flesh. The long beaks were overfull of\nsharp teeth. The heads, set upon bodies of glistening white-grey, were\nblack. Reddish grey eyes searched the jungle as the creatures flapped\nalong. But, the Pterodactyls--if they were that--passed above Naida's\nband without offering attack, and presently Naida gave the command to\nadvance again.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn time, they came to a chasmlike gorge across which was suspended\na slender long thread of a bridge. Not far above the bridge, a\nconsiderable river emptied itself into the gorge in a mirrorlike\nribbon. Kirby could not hear the torrent fall--or rather could not\nhear it strike any solid bottom. But from somewhere in the unlighted,\nunfathomed depths of the abyss rose strange bubbling and whistling\nsounds.\n\nAt the bridge, Naida paused and pointed to the land across the river.\nAnd as Kirby looked in the direction indicated, he beheld a rocky\neminence rising for several hundred feet straight up from the expanse of\na level, tree and grass covered plain. Atop of the plateau, glimmered\nthe complex towers and turrets, the crenellated walls of a castle which,\nin its grey antiquity, seemed as old as the race of men.\n\n\"It is behind those walls that the caciques dwell,\" Naida said quickly.\n\"It is behind the castle, in a series of separate houses, that the older\nmembers of the race dwell. We shall go and look upon them presently. But\nfirst we will force an interview with the caciques.\"\n\nIn silence Kirby took her hand, and, with the others following, they\nmoved out upon the swaying, perilous causeway which hung above the\nchasm. After that, the trip across the plain to the foot of the plateau\ncliffs was quickly accomplished.\n\nHere, however, Kirby thought they must face trouble, for he found that\nthe great walls, of a sparkling, almost glassy smoothness, shot up to a\nheight of at least three hundred feet, and that no path of any sort was\nvisible.\n\n\"We're here,\" he said, \"but how can we get up?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut understanding began to dawn as Naida laughed, and produced from the\npouch at the side of her gauzy dress four pliable discs of a substance\nwhich resembled rubber.\n\n\"You are very strong, are you not?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then you will have no trouble in following us up the cliff. Our Serpent\nGod, Quetzalcoatl, taught us how to climb long ago.\"\n\nWith that she handed Kirby the set of vacuum discs, and producing\nanother for herself, moistened them in a pool of water close at hand.\nThen, as all of the girls followed her action, she strapped them to her\nhands and feet, and in a moment they had begun the ascent.\n\n\"Why,\" Kirby said presently, \"with these things you could hang by your\nfeet and walk on a smooth ceiling!\"\n\nNaida laughed, and they worked their way upward.\n\nWhen the climb was accomplished and the discs were put away, Kirby found\nhimself standing on the outer edge of a mediaeval paradise, of a\nmagnificent plateau partly fortified by nature, partly by the hand of\nman.\n\n\"Ah!\" he cried in deep admiration, then followed Naida.\n\nThe building--the castle--in the near distance, resembled a castle of\nSpain, save that there was greater beauty and subtlety of architecture.\nTurreted on all four corners, constructed of material which looked like\nblocks of natural glass, the fairylike structure was crowned by a\ngigantic tower of something which resembled obsidian. Up and up this\ntower soared until its gleaming black tip seemed almost to touch the\nglassy-radiant sky of the cavern.\n\nNo people showed themselves, and Kirby saw that the bronze-studded\nportals set in the front of the castle were closed.\n\nAdmiringly, he glanced at the surrounding land laid out in checkerboard\npatches of gardens and orchards where grew a bewildering variety of\nunknown fruits and blooms. Butterflies drifted past, and the air was\nfreighted with the scent of flowers. Inside a walled enclosure, Kirby\nsaw a good-sized plot heavily grown with the plant on which he had been\nsubsisting. As they passed this ground, each of the girls, Naida\nleading, made a strange little bowing, gliding genuflection, and Kirby\nwondered.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNow, however, new sights distracted him as they crossed a port\ndrawbridge above a deep moat which was a fairyland of aquatic plants.\nAlthough not a sound had come from the castle, the great entrance doors\nwere swinging back.\n\n\"Be ready,\" Naida whispered, \"for almost anything. The doors are being\nopened by some of the palace guard. I have little doubt that word was\nlong ago rushed to the caciques that we are come to them with an\nupper-world man!\"\n\nKirby answered with a nod. Then they passed the outer doors, passed\ninside, and Kirby blinked at what he saw.\n\nIn a long hall decorated bewilderingly with a carven frieze in which\nappeared all of the symbols common to early Mexican religions, and many\nnew ones, stood a row of bright suits of armor of the Sixteenth Century.\nFrom each suit peered the glassy face and shovel beard of a dead\nConquistadore.\n\nSo this was what happened to intruders from the upper world! The\nConquistadore who kept his long watch beside the geyser was not the only\none! Kirby felt an involuntary chill prickle up his back. But he was not\ngiven long to think before Naida, ignoring the gruesome array, clasped\nhis arm.\n\n\"Look! Behold!\"\n\nAnd Kirby saw that with almost magical silence the whole wall at the end\nof the corridor was sliding back to reveal an enormous amphitheatre in\nthe center of which stood a vast circular table. Ranged in a semicircle\nabout that table, stood fifteen incredibly ancient men clad in long,\nglistening grey robes. Blanched beards trailed down the front of the\ngarments until they all but touched the floor.\n\nThe caciques!\n\nKirby, on the threshold of the amphitheatre, squared his shoulders and\nheld his head high. Then with Naida on his right, his own eyes boring\nunyieldingly into the smouldering, narrowed eyes which stared at him, he\nadvanced.\n\nBut in front of him the priests moved suddenly. From Naida burst a\nshriek. In the radiant glare of the council room flashed the long, thin,\ncruel blade of a sacrificial knife.\n\nThe cacique who had whipped it from his robe flew at Kirby with a condor\nswoop, talon-hands outstretched, his wrinkled, bearded face contorted\nwith fury.\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nBefore Kirby was more than half set to fight, the priest was clawing at\nhis throat, and a gnarled old fist was poised to drive the knife in a\ndeath stroke.\n\nKirby did the only thing he could do quickly--sprang to one side. The\nmove saved him. The knife whipped past his shoulder, and the cacique\nnearly fell. But it had been a close enough squeak for all that.\n\nNor was it over. After Kirby the priest sprang with unexpected agility,\nand before Kirby could snatch at his pistol the talon-hands were lunging\nat his throat once more.\n\nWith the gasps of the girls ringing in his ears, Kirby bunched himself\nfor another side leap only to find the cacique all over him like an\noctopus. Momentarily the knife hung above his chest, and Kirby, dismayed\nat the powers of his opponent, almost felt that the thing must plunge\nbefore he could break the octopus hold.\n\nBut he had no intention of being defeated, and now he was getting used\nto the fight. The priest's left arm swiftly clenched about his neck and\nshoulders, and the right arm, with the knife, attempted a drive through\nto the heart. Suddenly, however, Kirby lurched sideways and backward,\nand as the octopus grip slackened for a flash, he himself got a\nwrestler's grip that left him ready to do business. As the priest broke\nfree, he slid around in an attempt to fasten himself on Kirby's back.\nQuickly, tensely Kirby doubled, and knew that he had done enough. The\ncacique shot over his shoulders, described a somersault in midair, and\nlanded with a sharp crack of head and shoulders against unyielding\nstone.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFrom the semicircle of other priests went up a gasp. From Naida came a\nstrangled cry of joy. Kirby made one leap for the knife which had fallen\nfrom the cacique's hand as he slumped into unconsciousness, and then he\nstraightened up with the weapon safe in his possession.\n\n\"There, you old billygoat,\" he croaked in English, \"maybe you won't try\nany more fast ones for awhile.\"\n\nA second later he stepped over the sprawled body to stand beside Naida.\n\nUpon the wrinkled countenances of the remaining caciques was stamped a\nlook of dismay and hatred which boded no good. It was plain to Kirby\nthat in battering up the man detailed to kill him, he had committed a\ndesecration of first order.\n\n\"Is there anyone else who cares to fight?\" he flung at them in Spanish,\nshowing a contempt as great as their rage.\n\nThe response he got was instant. From one old gullet, then from others,\ncame choking, snarling sounds which presently became words. By those\nwords Kirby heard himself cursed with a vituperation which made him,\neven in his temporary triumph, feel grave.\n\nBut he did not let that soberness trouble him long. For the main point\nnow was that no one made a move to fight further, which was what he had\nexpected. He had flung them the challenge, knowing that he was possessed\nof their knife, and suspecting that it was their only weapon. The belief\nthat no one would care to try a barehanded conflict, no matter what\ninsult was waiting to be avenged, seemed justified as none of the\ncaciques advanced, and as even the cursing presently ceased.\n\n\"No?\" Kirby asked. \"There is to be no more fighting?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOne of the caciques now came forward a few steps.\n\n\"No,\" he answered with a lameness which was not to be denied. \"But you,\na criminal interloper in our realm, have been marked as a victim for\nsacrifice, and from this there is no power in the universe which can\nsave you.\"\n\nKirby, after a reassuring glance at Naida, looked at the floored priest\nwho was sitting up now, looking stupidly about, and feeling himself all\nover, and Kirby suppressed a grin.\n\n\"Ah, I am to be sacrificed, eh? But what happens until that time comes?\nListen my Wise Ones--\"\n\nHe stabbed a finger at them, and his eyes flashed.\n\n\"Listen! What you mean to say is that I have defeated you, and you must\nlay off me until you can launch another attack. But I have a few things\nto say to that. One is that I am not going to permit myself to _be_\nsacrificed. Another is that I demand, right here and now, that you begin\nto discuss with me certain agreements which are going to regulate the\nfuture conduct of affairs in this world to which I have come.\"\n\nA low exclamation answered that, but it came from no priest. They\nremained sullen and staggered. It was Naida who murmured, and there was\nexcitement and pleasure in her voice. Suddenly she placed her lips\nagainst Kirby's ear.\n\n\"You must not treat with them,\" she said. \"Tell them you want to see the\nDuca, and will destroy them all unless he comes!\"\n\nUnderstanding burst over Kirby. The Duca! Then these men were only the\nrepresentatives of a High Priest, the Duca!\n\n\"Yes,\" he repeated resolutely to the assembled greybeards, \"a meeting is\ngoing to be held in this chamber of council at once. But I will not\ndeal with you! Do you understand me? I must see the Duca. I leave it to\nyou to decide whether you will summon him, or force me to fight my way\nthrough to wherever he is staying.\"\n\n\"The Duca!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe words burst in dismay from the gimlet-eyed cacique who had said\nthere would be no more fighting. He looked at Naida, well aware of the\nfact that it was her interference which had made Kirby extend his\ndemand. And his look was black.\n\nKirby slid between Naida and the cacique.\n\n\"Yes,\" he spat out, \"the Duca! Will you summon him, or--\"\n\nHe did not repeat what he would do as an alternative. A second passed in\nsilence. It seemed as if the cacique who had been speaking was ready to\nburst.\n\n\"Answer me!\" Kirby thundered.\n\nAnd then the priest obeyed.\n\n\"Very well,\" he growled in a voice which quaked with rage. \"I obey. But\nyou will wish you had never made the demand!\"\n\nThe next second he swung on his heel, and leaving his company behind as\na guard, headed toward a stair which led upward from one side of the\namphitheatre, and which was protected by a door of heavy, grilled metal\nwork. The stairway seemed to be spiral, and was all enclosed. Kirby\nrealized that it must lead into the tall and beautiful tower of obsidion\nwhich he had seen outside.\n\n\"Oh,\" Naida whispered as looks and smiles of approval came from all of\nthe girls, \"you have been magnificent! Mark now, what we must do. You\nmust be the one to state our terms, because you have already won a\nvictory for us. Tell the Duca that we will not submit to any compromise\nwith the ape-men, and least of all will we let any of our number go to\nthe ape-men.\"\n\nA deep flush crept into Kirby's cheeks at thought of what he would like\nto do to the man who had proposed that sacrifice.\n\n\"Then tell him,\" Naida continued, \"that we want men brought to our world\nfrom the world above. And finally tell him we will live under his\ndictatorship no longer, and hereafter demand a voice in all councils\naffecting temporal affairs.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Kirby spoke grimly. \"I'll tell him. Naida, is this high\npriest we're waiting for, the one who proposed sacrifice of some of you\nto the apes?\"\n\nNaida nodded.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNext moment, she, Kirby, and all the others, including the row of\nglowering caciques, became silent. At sounds from above, all looked\ntoward the grilled doorway to the tower. Then Kirby realized that all of\nthe girls, as well as the caciques, were dropping to their knees.\n\n\"No!\" he commanded quickly. \"Get up! You must not abase--\"\n\nHe had not finished, and Naida had scarcely risen, when the heavy door\nswung on noiseless hinges.\n\nThe light in the amphitheatre seemed to become more intense. Then,\nagainst the great glow, Kirby beheld majesty, beheld one who represented\nthe apotheosis of priestly rank and power.\n\nClad in robes of filmy material which glimmered white beside the gray\nrobes of his underlings, the Duca wore about his waist the living flame\nof a girdle composed of alternate cut diamonds and blood red rubies each\nlarger than a golf ball. And Kirby, searching for comparisons, realized\nthat the Duca's face, upheld to others, would be as remarkable as his\njewels must be when compared to ordinary gems. It was a chiseled face,\nseamed by a thousand wrinkles, which a god might have carved from ivory\nbefore endowing it with the flush and glow of life. A mane of snow white\nhair cascaded back from a tremendous forehead to fall about thin but\nsquare shoulders and mingle with the downward sweep of pure white\nbeard. The eyes, black as polished jet, flamed now with the glare of\nbaleful fires.\n\nAs Naida, stealing close to Kirby, trembled, and even the abased\ncaciques trembled, Kirby himself felt as if icy water was trickling over\nhim.\n\nHe fought the sensation off. For suddenly he knew that in spite of first\nimpressions which made the man seem a living god, the old Duca was\nhuman. And what was more, he was in the wrong. All of which being true,\nthe thing to do was keep a level head and fight.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll at once Kirby spoke across the silence in the great room.\n\n\"I have sent for you,\" he said, weighing words carefully.\n\n\"And I,\"--the Duca's voice was mellow and deep--\"have come. But I am not\nhere because you summoned me.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" Kirby let sarcasm edge his words. \"Well, I won't quibble about\nyour motives for coming. Did my messenger tell you why we are here and\ndemand your presence?\"\n\n\"Your messenger,\" the old man said calmly, \"told me.\"\n\n\"Very well. Do you consent to listen to Naida's and my terms? If you\n_will_ listen--\"\n\n\"But wait a moment,\" the Duca interrupted, still calmly, but with a look\nin his eyes which Kirby did not like. \"Are you asking _me_, to my face,\nwhether I will listen to terms which you offer as self-styled victor of\na battle with my caciques?\"\n\nKirby nodded. His apprehension increased.\n\n\"Ah,\" said the Duca softly. And then, amazingly, a smile deepened every\nwrinkle of his parchment face. \"But do you not remember that I said I\nhad _not_ come here because you summoned me?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Kirby said solidly. \"I remember very well.\"\n\n\"The thing which brought me here was the failure of my followers to\naccomplish an assignment which I had given them--namely, that of ending\nyour life.\"\n\n\"Hum.\" Kirby scratched behind his ear. \"You are _not_ interested in\narranging terms of peace, then.\"\n\n\"I am here,\"--suddenly the Duca's voice filled the room--\"to do that\nwhich my priests were unable to do. And the moment has come when the\nGods will no longer trifle with you. You dog! You thieving intruder!\nYou--\"\n\nSwiftly the Duca plunged one withered but still powerful hand into the\nfolds of his robe above the flaming girdle. Then his hand flashed out,\nand in it he held--\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut Kirby did not get to see.\n\nA strangled cry of terror smote his ears. Naida leaped toward him from\none side, while Elana, the lovely youngest girl, sprang from another\ndirection, hurled Naida aside, and stopped in front of Kirby.\n\nThrough the glaring room flickered a tiny red serpentine creature which\nthe Duca hurled from a crystalline tube in his hand. As the minute snake\nstruck Elana's breast, she gave a choked cough, and then, as she half\nturned to smile at both Naida and Kirby over her shoulder, her eyes went\nblank, and she collapsed gently to the polished stones of the\nfloor--dead.\n\nA second later came squirming out from under her the ghastly, glimmering\nlittle snake which had struck.\n\nSlowly, while every mortal in the room stood paralyzed, Kirby stepped\nforward and set his heel upon the writhing thing. When he raised his\nboot, the snake was only a blotch on the floor.\n\nThe Duca was standing as still as girls and caciques. The laughter with\nwhich he had started to greet what he had thought would be Kirby's\nextermination had faded to a look of wonder--and fear. He was an easy\nmark.\n\nUp to him Kirby rolled, and with all the force of soul and muscular\nbody, drove his fist into the Duca's face.\n\n\"By God,\" he roared, \"you want war, and you shall have it!\"\n\nThe Duca was simply out--not dead. Since Kirby did not want him dead, he\ndid not strike again, but swung back from the sprawled body, faced\nNaida, and pointed to the tower door.\n\n\"Up there!\" he snapped. \"Seize the tower. I have a reason!\"\n\nAt the Duca's crashing downfall, had come to the caciques a tension\nwhich made Kirby know they would not be dummy figures much longer. His\neyes never left them.\n\n\"Quick, Naida!\" he snapped again. \"We must hold the tower!\"\n\nNaida, all of the girls, were staring dazedly at Elana, dead.\n\n\"The tower!\" she choked. \"But we cannot go there. It is the Duca's!\"\n\n\"Because it is the Duca's,\" Kirby said firmly, \"is exactly why we must\nhold it. Come, Naida, please--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd then he saw comprehension begin to dawn at last.\n\nHe also saw two of the caciques glide from the wooden line, and slink\ntoward him past the unconscious Duca, stealthily.\n\nAs Naida suddenly cried out to her companions, pushed at two of them,\nand then darted like a rainbow nymph toward the silent and forbidding\nupward spiral of steps, Kirby faced the gliding caciques.\n\nOne he clutched with viselike hands, and lifted him. As the other\nshrieked and sprang, he was mowed down by the hurtling body of his\nfellow priest which Kirby flung forward mightily.\n\nThe rest of the caciques were howling. While Naida waited beside the\ntower door, the other girls flashed up the steps. The Duca still lay\nwhere he had fallen, a thread of blood oozing from his mouth. Kirby,\nafter his last look over all, solemnly stooped and gathered in his arms\nthe limp, radiant little body of the girl who had given her life that\nher friends might be left with a leader.\n\nA moment later, he was standing on the steps. Naida, unopposed by the\nstill stupefied caciques, swung shut the tower door and shot a double\nbolt.\n\n\"Naida--\" Kirby whispered as he held Elana closer to him, \"oh, I am so\nsorry that we could have won only at such a price.\"\n\nAs Naida stooped to kiss the pale little forehead with its halo of\ngolden hair, sobs came. But then she raised her eyes, and they were, for\nKirby, alight with the message that she could and would accept Elana's\nsacrifice, because she would gladly have made it herself.\n\n\"We will not forget,\" she whispered. \"Carry her tenderly, and come.\"\n\nFor better, for worse, the Duca's tower was theirs.\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nAt the end of an hour, Kirby was taking a turn of guard duty at the foot\nof the steps, while the others remained with Elana in a chamber above.\nTo Kirby, with things thus far along, it seemed that the seizure of the\ntower had proved a shrewd stroke.\n\nIt seemed that the tower was to the Duca what hair was to Sampson. From\nNaida had come the information that the Duca lived hidden within the\ngreat shaft of obsidion, and appeared but seldom even before his\ncaciques. Apparently a large part of his hold upon his subjects was\nmaintained by the mystery with which he kept himself surrounded. And now\nhis retreat was lost to him! Such had been the moral effect of the loss\nupon both Duca and caciques, that his whole first hour had gone by\nwithout their doing anything.\n\nKirby, standing just around the first turn of the winding stairway,\npresently cocked his ears to listen to the conclave being held in the\namphitheatre.\n\n\"Why not starve them out, O Holy One?\" he heard one of the caciques ask\nof the Duca, only to be answered by a growl of negation.\n\nThe Duca, Kirby had gathered before this, wanted to fight.\n\n\"But there is no food in the tower, is there?\" the cacique still pressed\non, and this time he was supported by other voices.\n\n\"No,\" the Duca rumbled back. \"But am I to be deprived of my retreat,\nleft here like a common dog amongst other dogs, while these accursed\nfiends starve slowly to death? No! I tell you, you must fight for me!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut he had told them so several times before and nothing had happened.\nKirby grinned at the thought of the caste the Duca was losing by being\ndriven to this belittling parley.\n\n\"Holy One,\" exclaimed a new priest in answer to the urge to fight, \"what\ncan we do against the golden haired fiend? The stairs are so narrow that\nhe could defend them alone. And then there are the gates of bronze. If\nwe could shatter the first, at the foot of the steps, we should only\nencounter others. The Duca must remember that his tower was built to\nwithstand attack.\"\n\n\"Even so,\" the Duca snapped back, \"it must be attacked! I--\"\n\nBut then he fell silent, having been made so by the sounds of dissension\nwhich arose amongst his caciques. Kirby, laughing to himself, turned\naway from his listening post, and tip-toed up the steps.\n\nAfter he had closed and bolted behind him three of the bronze portals so\nfeared by the caciques, he turned to the entrance of the chamber in\nwhich he had left Naida and the others. Here all was silent, and he\nfound his friends grouped about a couch on which lay Elana. Feeling the\nsolemnity of the moment, he would have taken his place quietly amongst\nthe mourners.\n\nNaida, however, came to him at once, and in a low voice asked for news\nfrom the amphitheatre, and when Kirby answered that the caciques were\nunanimously in favor of leaving them alone until they starved, she\nexclaimed:\n\n\"Oh, then it is good news!\"\n\nAfter that, however, a shadow of doubt flickered in her great eyes.\n\n\"And yet, is it? It means temporary immunity, of coarse.\nBut--starvation!\"\n\nKirby assured her with a grin.\n\n\"If we had to starve we might worry. But there is more food here than\nthe Duca thinks. Look!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFrom a bulging pocket of his tunic he fished a strip of the roots on\nwhich he had subsisted so comfortably. Naida's eyes widened, and several\nof the girls gave low cries.\n\n\"Yes,\" Naida exclaimed, \"but such food! Why--why, do you know what you\nare offering us? Why, this is the sacred Peyote! Only the Duca eats it,\nand, at rare intervals, his priests.\"\n\nKirby was really startled now.\n\n\"But surely you and the others have taken quantities of the stuff away\nfrom the Valley of the Geyser. Do you mean--\"\n\n\"Because we gathered the Peyote does not mean that we have ever tasted\nit. We gather it for the Duca. To taste would be complete, utter\nsacrilege. Have _you_ been eating it?\"\n\nInwardly Kirby was chuckling at this added proof of the buncumbe with\nwhich the Duca--and other Ducas--had fooled all.\n\n\"Of course I've been eating the Peyote.\"\n\n\"And--and nothing has happened to you?\" Naida asked.\n\n\"Hardly. I certainly haven't been blasted by the Lords of the Sun and\nMoon, or the Serpent either!\"\n\nNaida and all the others were silent. The conflict between their\nreverence for the food and their clear desire to eat it, now that it was\nbecome the food of their leader, was pathetic.\n\nKirby put one of the strips in Naida's hand.\n\n\"Why not?\" he asked. \"We have bested the Duca in fair fight. We have\nseized his tower. Why not eat his food?\"\n\nAs he had hoped it would, the suggestion at last settled the matter. A\nmoment later, as Naida nibbled her first bite, she smiled.\n\n\"Why, it--it's good!\"\n\nWith the question of provisions settled at least for a time, Kirby's\nnext thought was of the tower. The present lull of peace seemed made for\nexploration.\n\n\"Come along,\" he said to Naida, \"we've plenty to do,\" and then, when he\nexplained, they set out, accompanied by Nini, a cousin of Naida's, and\nIvana, a younger sister.\n\nAll of the others remained with little Elana.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhile they climbed spiral stairs, Naida explained that the chamber they\nhad just left was used by the Duca as a place in which he prayed before\nand after contacts with caciques or subjects. A sort of halfway station\nbetween earth and heaven, as it were, where the Duca might be purged of\nany sullying influence gained from human relationships.\n\nAt thought of the rank, egotistical hypocrisy implied by the story,\nKirby smiled grimly. Then they came to a new door, heavier than that\nwhich barricaded the prayer chamber. Unlocked, the thing swung\nponderously at Kirby's push, and with the three girls pressing close\nbeside him, he entered--and stopped.\n\n\"Naida!\" he gasped.\n\n\"Oh, _oh_!\" she cried, and while Nini and Ivana gasped, she clapped her\nhands in an instinctive, feminine reaction of joy. \"But there are things\nhere which I believe none but the Ducas of our race have ever seen! Oh!\nWhy, the sacred girdle is as nothing compared to this display!\"\n\nBy \"display\" she meant a treasure which took Kirby's breath away, which\nmade his heart act queerly.\n\nThe walls of the chamber were fashioned of polished blocks of obsidion\non which stood out in heavy bas-relief a maze of decorative figures\nfashioned of pure, beaten gold--the same kind of gold which had gone\ninto the making of the cylinder of gold. With his first glance at the\ngorgeously wrought motifs of Feathered Serpent and Sun and Moon symbols,\nKirby knew to a certainty whence the golden cylinder had come\noriginally.\n\nBut even the gold--literally tons of it there must have been--was\nnothing compared to the gems.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey were spread out in blinding array upon a great table in the center\nof the room. There were pearls as big as turkey eggs and whiter, softer\nthan the light of a June morning growing in the East. There were rubies.\nOne amongst the many was the size of a baseball and glowed like the\nheart of a red star. The least of the two or three hundred gems would\nhave outclassed the greatest treasures of the Crown jewels of England\nand Russia combined.\n\nMost overwhelming of all, however, was the jewel which rested against a\nsquare of black cloth all its own in the center of the table. While his\nheart still acted queerly, while Naida, Nini, and Ivana hung back,\ndelighted, but still too bewildered to move, Kirby advanced and took\ngingerly in his hands a single white diamond about eighteen inches long,\nand almost as wide and deep as it was long.\n\nThe thing was carved with exquisite cunning to a likeness of the living\nhead of Quetzalcoatl, the Feathered Serpent.\n\nKirby dared not guess how many pounds the carven hunk of flashing,\nblue-white carbon weighed. He knew only that like it there was no other\ndiamond in the world, and that the thing was real. Naida and the two\ngirls were silent now, and suddenly Kirby realized that to their awe of\nthe gem was added awe of deepest religious nature. Slowly he put the\ndiamond head of the Serpent back upon its square of cloth.\n\n\"We--we had heard that this thing existed,\" Naida said presently, voice\nhushed, \"but no one except the holy men of our race has ever beheld\nit.\"\n\n\"But, what is it?\" Kirby asked. \"Whence came it?\"\n\nHowever, when Naida would have answered, he interrupted.\n\n\"But wait! Tell me as we go. We could stay here for the rest of our\nlives without much trouble, but we've got to cover the rest of the tower\nand get back to the others.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was after they had closed the door to the treasure room that Naida\ntold him the story.\n\n\"There is not so much to tell,\" she began. \"The diamond itself is so\ngorgeous that it is hard to talk about. But here is the story. A great\nmany ages ago one of the Ducas of our race found the diamond, decided to\ncarve it into a perfect likeness of the head of the Serpent God. All of\nthe craftsmen of the race helped him and when they were done, they took\ntheir image to Quetzalcoatl himself, and showed him what they had done.\n\n\"Quetzalcoatl was pleased. So pleased, that he promised all of the wise\nmen that he would cease to prey upon them as he had in the past, and\nhenceforward would take his toll of sacrifice from the ape-men alone.\nThem he hated and would continue to hate because they worshipped not him\nbut Xlotli.\n\n\"And so it came about,\" Naida went on slowly, looking up at Kirby as\nthey still mounted wide steps to the upper reaches of the tower, \"that\nour people gained immunity from a God which had always before harmed and\ndestroyed them. Our race presently began to build this castle here on\nthe high plateau, and Quetzalcoatl kept his compact with them. He still\ncomes out of his chasm at intervals and preys upon the ape-men, but no\none of our race has seen him for thousands of years, and he has always\nlet us alone. And there is the whole myth and explanation of why the\ngreat diamond is revered among us as a holy of holies.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey had mounted to a new door which Kirby guessed might give entrance\nto the Duca's living quarters. But he was in no mood to open it at\nonce.\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" he said as they all paused. \"You say that, although\nnone of your race has seen Quetzalcoatl since the diamond head was\ncarved, he still comes out of his chasm and makes trouble for the\nape-men. Just what does that mean?\"\n\n\"Why--\" Naida looked at him wonderingly. \"I mean what I have said. The\nSerpent comes out of his chasm and--\"\n\n\"What chasm?\" Kirby asked sharply.\n\n\"Why, the one we crossed this morning. It extends to the far reaches of\nour country, beyond the Rorroh forest, where the ape-men dwell but which\nour people never visit. It is in that distant part of the chasm that the\nSerpent dwells.\"\n\n\"But--but--Oh, good Lord!\" Kirby whistled softly. \"Naida, do you mean to\ntell me that Quetzalcoatl was not simply a mythical monster, but an\nactual, living serpent which is alive _now_?\"\n\nNaida and the others shrugged.\n\n\"Why not?\" she answered. \"Sometimes we have captured a few ape-men, and\nthey tell us stories of how Quetzalcoatl kills them. _They_ say he is\nvery much alive.\"\n\n\"But,\" Kirby mumbled in increasing wonder, \"is this living creature the\nsame which your ancestors worshipped first as long ago, perhaps, as a\nmillion years?\"\n\n\"That,\" Naida answered unhesitatingly, \"I'm not sure of. Our caciques\nbelieve that the Serpent, although it lives longer than any other\nsentient thing, finally dies and is succeeded by a new Serpent which is\nreproduced by itself, within its own body.\"\n\nSo overwhelming did Kirby find this unexpected sequel to their discovery\nof the great diamond head, so staggered was he by the fact that\nQuetzalcoatl, of Aztecan myth, might exist as a sentient creature here\nin this cavern world, that he had little heart left for exploring other\nwonders.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNevertheless, he presently pushed open the new door before which they\nhad paused, and behind it found, as he had expected, the Duca's living\nquarters.\n\nThese were as severe as the jewel chamber had been gorgeous. A thin\npallet spread upon a frame of wood formed the bed, and beside it stood a\nsingle stiff chair. That was all. The walls of glistening obsidion were\nbare.\n\nThere was, however, a door in one circular wall, and as Kirby flung this\nopen, his previous disappointment changed to delight. For shelves along\nthe walls of the small chamber held roll after roll of parchment covered\nwith script. And in one corner lay six undamaged, almost new Mannlichers\nand several hundred rounds of ammunition!\n\n\"Naida,\" he exclaimed, \"do you know what those are?\"\n\n\"I suppose that they are weapons of the sort you used against the\nape-men this morning?\"\n\nKirby grinned.\n\n\"They are the same kind I used, and then some. With these weapons we can\ndo what we never could with the smaller one. How did they get here?\"\n\n\"They came when I was much younger,\" Naida answered with a shade of\nsadness in her voice. \"The men who had them penetrated the Valley of the\nGeyser, coming by a different route from the one you followed. When the\nDuca learned they were there, he sent such men of the race as were still\nable to fight to kill them. That order of the Duca's was one of the\nfirst things to turn me against him. The men were not harming us, and\nthey should have been permitted to go away. But the Duca insisted that\nthey be killed, and in the fight were lost eight of our youngest and\nstrongest men.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKirby stooped to inspect the rifles.\n\n\"Has no one learned to use these weapons?\"\n\n\"No,\" Naida answered. \"The Duca kept them for himself.\"\n\n\"We think,\" put in Ivana, \"that he hoped to learn to use them, and was\nafraid for us to have the knowledge.\"\n\nKirby filled one of the magazines, and felt the heft of the gun with\npleasure.\n\n\"Very well,\" he said. \"It looks to me as though your time to learn the\nart of shooting has come at last. Come, I think we had better be getting\nback downstairs.\"\n\nKirby took three guns himself, and with the others lugging the rest,\nthey started back. The parchment rolls, he decided, must be left for\nexamination later on.\n\nThey were all elated when they rejoined the girls in the prayer chamber,\nand high spirits were still further increased by the report, promptly\ngiven, that all had remained quiet in the amphitheatre. Save only for\nthe presence of Elana, radiant and calm in death, the give and take of\nquestions would have been accompanied by actual gaiety.\n\nBut the time of peace did not last much longer. While Naida was in the\nmidst of answering incessant questions about the wonders of the jewel\nchamber, Kirby heard a sound from below, and suddenly went over to the\ndownward-winding steps.\n\n\"Listen,\" he called sharply back to the others.\n\nHe had not been mistaken. Many footsteps echoed from the amphitheatre,\nand he made out that the caciques were coming toward the bolted gate at\nthe foot of the steps. While he listened, and Naida came eagerly to his\nside, silence fell.\n\nBut then clear words came up to them.\n\n\"Let the upper-world man come to the foot of the steps,\" called the\nDuca. \"I have an offer to make him!\"\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nTo himself Kirby chuckled. Such real entreaty filled the Duca's voice\nthat there seemed no danger of further treachery from him at the\nmoment.\n\nWith a grin, Kirby took Naida's hand and led her down the steps,\nunbolting each bronze gate but the last.\n\n\"What do you want?\" he asked in a cool voice a moment later, when he\nstopped on the final step and faced the Duca from behind the protection\nof the final gate.\n\nClearly the parley was going to be a blunt one.\n\n\"I want you to leave our world,\" the Duca rumbled promptly.\n\nHe was drawn up in a posture intended to display dignity. But his left\ncheek, where Kirby had hammered him, was pulpy and discolored, and\nsomehow he seemed to Kirby more than ever merely human.\n\n\"Under what conditions am I to leave?\"\n\n\"If you will vacate my tower at once,\" the Duca said with a flush of\neagerness which he could not conceal, \"I will permit Naida and one of my\ncaciques to escort you back to the Valley of the Geyser. I will also\ngive you directions by which you may travel in safety from there to the\nouter world.\"\n\nKirby, wanting more details, made himself seem thoughtful.\n\n\"And what will happen to me, and to the girls, if I decline?\"\n\nEncouraged, the Duca made an impressive gesture.\n\n\"You will be left in the tower to die of starvation. Mine is not a\ncomplicated offer. It should require no complicated decision. What is\nyour answer?\"\n\nKirby dropped his carefully assumed mask of thought.\n\n\"My answer is this,\" he lashed out. \"I will not leave! The tower is\nours, and we will hold it until you have accepted Naida's peace terms on\nyour priestly oath!\"\n\n\"But if you stay in the tower you will starve!\" thundered the Duca.\n\n\"No, we won't starve! We won't starve because we eat the food of\nDucas!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn silence, Kirby took from his pocket a strip of the sacred Peyote and\nbit off one end of it. Suddenly the hush in the amphitheatre became\ncomplete. As he watched Kirby chewing, the Duca gasped and choked.\n\n\"Moreover,\" Kirby announced with slow emphasis, \"I have taken possession\nof the weapons which you took from men of the upper world, and which\nhave already sent men of your race to their death. I have no wish to\nkill either you or your caciques, but if you do not presently discuss\npeace with me, you will certainly find yourself embroiled in a struggle\nmore bitter than the mild one of this morning.\"\n\nWith that said, he swung on his heel, and taking Naida's hand again,\nstarted with her up the steps.\n\n\"I have nothing more to say,\" he called over his shoulder to a Duca\nwhose white haired majesty had been stripped from him.\n\n\"We're getting on,\" he whispered to Naida a moment later. \"The best\nthing for us is just to sit still now, and wait.\"\n\nWith the questions he wanted to ask Naida about her world becoming\ninsistent, he found himself, as a matter of fact, glad for the prospect\nof further respite. As both of them rejoined the girls in the Duca's\nprayer chamber, the first thing he did was to take from his tunic the\ncylinder of gold which he had found in the canyon.\n\n\"What is this, Naida?\" he asked, hoping to start talk that would make\nall of them forget the Duca and politics, and at the same time help him\nto learn much that he wished to know.\n\nBut a queer thing happened. Naida's reaction to the carven gold was as\nunexpected as it was marked.\n\n\"_Oh!_\" she cried in a voice which suddenly trembled with surprise, with\nblank dismay. Somehow, the cylinder of gold brought to her face things\nwhich not even the Serpent's head of the diamond had evoked.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe prospect of a long session of talk began to fade out in Kirby's\nmind.\n\n\"But Naida, whatever is there about this fragment of gold to startle you\nas it does?\"\n\nBy this time all of the thirty-odd other girls had come flocking about\nthem, and all were staring at the cylinder as fascinatedly as Naida.\n\n\"Do you see what he has there?\" Naida finally asked, ignoring Kirby in\nher continued excitement.\n\n\"Do we _see_?\" answered the girl she had addressed. \"Naida, surely it is\nthe carving which was lost!\"\n\nNaida was quivering with feeling now.\n\n\"Do you realize what it means to our cause that it should have been\nreturned to us in this way?\"\n\nThe girl to whom she had spoken, and the others, simply looked at her,\nbut in one face after another presently dawned awe and joy.\n\nKirby stood still, puzzled and interested, until at last Naida was\nrecovered enough to speak to him.\n\n\"Where did you get this thing which you call 'a fragment of gold'?\" she\nasked in a hushed voice.\n\n\"I found it,\" Kirby answered, \"lying beside the skeleton of an\nupper-world man, while I was ascending the canyon which brought me to\nthe Valley of the Geyser.\"\n\n\"And you do not know what the cylinder is? But no, of course you could\nnot.\"\n\n\"_What_ is it, Naida?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNaida glanced at her friends, then laid her hand on Kirby's.\n\n\"Next to the great diamond, it is the most cherished possession of our\nrace. In some respects it is even more holy than the Serpent's head. The\ncylinder happens to be the first work in gold which was ever produced by\nour people. It was made when the race was new. It was because our first\nwise men had found they could create things of beauty like this\ncylinder, that they decided to attempt the creation of the Serpent's\nhead, which is supposed to have brought all of our blessings upon us.\"\n\nKirby thought he was beginning to understand the excitement which his\nintroduction of the cylinder had created. He also thought he could see\nwhat Naida had meant by implying that the cylinder could be made to aid\ntheir cause.\n\n\"Tell me,\" he asked in a mood approaching reverence, \"how the cylinder\ncame to be lying beside a dead man's bones.\"\n\n\"It was stolen,\" Naida answered in the breathless silence which the\nothers were keeping. \"When I was very young, an upper-world man found\nhis way here, and the Duca captured and meant to sacrifice him. But\nwhile they were leading him to the temple where such special ceremonies\nare held--the building stands on another plateau, beyond this--the man\nbroke away. Some of the priests in the procession were carrying the\ncylinder, for it was an occasion of great importance. The prisoner\nknocked them down, got the cylinder away from them, and finally escaped\nby the same route over which you came.\"\n\n\"And he escaped,\" said Kirby wonderingly, \"only to be killed by a\nrattlesnake before he ever reached the civilized world. But do you mean\nthat you never knew your sacred cylinder was so close to you all these\nyears?\"\n\nNaida shook her head.\n\n\"We never got to the canyon of which you speak, for a special reason\nwhich I shall explain some day. And besides that, I think the Duca was\nafraid of this man who fought so bravely. So he counted the cylinder as\nlost. And that is one of the reasons why he killed the men with the\nrifles, who appeared in the Valley a few years later.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKirby looked at her thoughtfully. The mood for discussing all the\nwonders of this lower world, which had made him bring out the cylinder\noriginally, had quite vanished.\n\n\"I suppose,\" he said, \"that anyone who was responsible for the return of\nthe cylinder to its rightful owners, would be held in some respect?\"\n\nNaida nodded vigorously, while little lightnings of excitement flickered\nin her eyes.\n\n\"He might be held in more than respect.\"\n\n\"What, then, do you suggest that we do next?\"\n\nAgain the small lightnings darted, and Naida reached for the cylinder.\n\n\"Do you mind if I take it for a moment?\"\n\n\"Of course not.\"\n\nPromptly then she faced around.\n\n\"Wait here, everyone,\" she ordered.\n\nAnd with that she waved the cylinder in a flashing little arc before\ntheir eyes, and darted to the door.\n\nIt was all so unexpected that she was gone before Kirby could speak.\nSlowly, with all of the suddenly gay company of girls following after\nhim, he went to the doorway, and stood on the steps leading to the\namphitheatre.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA minute passed. He heard voices downstairs. He heard Naida's voice\nringing clearly, though he could not distinguish her words. He heard a\ngreat cry from a score of male throats. More minutes passed. Words that\nwere low and tense poured out in a rumbling volume. Above the rumble,\nNaida's voice presently sounded again, clear and sweet, but incisive.\nThen, when no more than five or six minutes had gone, Kirby heard the\nclang of the bronze gate at the foot of the steps, heard light, swift\nfootsteps ascending.\n\n\"Naida!\" he called softly.\n\nShe flashed upward toward him around the last curve in the stairway.\nStraight to his outstretched arms she went.\n\n\"It is done! It is done!\" she whispered.\n\n\"Tell us!\" cried first one girl and then others.\n\nNaida drew away from Kirby at last.\n\n\"I told the Duca,\" she said to all of them, \"that our leader would keep\nthe cylinder for a period of time equal to one upper-world year. If the\nDuca grants all the terms of peace which we will ask of him, and if he\naccepts the upper-world man as our temporal ruler, and all goes well for\na year, then we will consider replacing the cylinder where it belongs.\"\n\n\"And what,\" Kirby asked exultantly, \"does the Duca say?\"\n\nSuddenly, without warning, Naida dropped before him on one knee, and\nfrom that position gazed up at him laughing.\n\n\"He says he will make you our King, to govern all temporal affairs\nwithin our realm! He is waiting for you to come and hold a conclave\nnow.\"\n\n\"_What?_\"\n\nStill kneeling half in fun, half in sincere reverence, Naida held out\nthe precious, potent cylinder of gold.\n\n\"Guard it carefully!\" she exclaimed. \"So long as you keep it away from\nthe Duca, making him hope to win it back, he will consent to almost\nanything. Yes, he is waiting with the caciques in the amphitheatre now;\nwaiting to draw up terms of peace.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nTo be King amongst these people! A queer sensation tugged at Kirby's\nheart as he descended the steps with Naida at his right, and all of\nher--and his--dainty and gracious friends following after. Yet, intense\nas his emotion was, never for a second was he able to doubt the evidence\nof his senses which told him that all of this was real. As they\ndescended the black steps of the tower, Naida's sweetness, her grace,\nthe warm humanity of her, made him humble with gratitude for the\nextraordinary fortune which had come to him, an unromantic aviator born\nin Kansas.\n\nThen they were standing in the brilliant light of the amphitheatre, and\nthe Duca, surrounded by his caciques, was advancing to meet them.\n\nIt was not a long conference which followed. Kirby saw from the start\nthat the Duca was indeed ready to come to terms. So treasured an object,\nit seemed, was the cylinder of gold, that the mere fact that Kirby\npossessed it made the Duca respect the possessor, whether he would or\nno. With this initial advantage, it did not take long to make demands\nand win acceptance.\n\nIt was agreed that some systematic campaign of extermination should be\nplanned and carried out against the ape-men. Further, the project for\neventually bringing other upper-world men to the realm was accepted.\nMost notable of all, it was agreed that while the Duca should retain a\nvoice in the regulation of temporal affairs, Kirby should possess an\nabsolute veto over his word.\n\nNaida said there must be some formal ceremony to celebrate Kirby's\nascendency to power. To this the Duca consented, and established the\ndate as a fortnight hence, and the place as the temple on the plateau\nbeyond the plateau of the castle, where the Ducas had been invested with\ntheir robes of state from time immemorial. At the end, it was decided\nthat little Elana should be left in the prayer chamber until a burial\nceremony could be held on the morrow.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn less than an hour, Kirby, Naida, and the others withdrew from the\namphitheatre to return to the regular dwelling places of the girls. Deep\nin his mind, Kirby did not know how sincere the Duca was, and fear\nlingered, somehow, but he put it aside for the present.\n\nAs they came out of the castle, proceeding in a gay procession across\nthe drawbridge above the moat of beautiful aquatic plants, Kirby saw\nthat the light from the glass sky was fading to a glow like that of\nspring twilight in the upper world. Naida answered his question about\nthe phenomenon by saying that day and night in the cavern corresponded\nto the same period above. What quality of the glass sky gave out light,\nshe did not know, but it seemed definite that the element was sensitive\nto the presence of light in the upper world, and when the sun sank\nthere, the glow faded here.\n\nA flower embroidered path led them around the castle to a group of\nlittle crystalline houses all overgrown with bougainvillea vines and\nhoneysuckle. In front of the first, Naida paused, and while the others\nwent on to the other houses, she looked at Kirby.\n\n\"It is Elana's dwelling,\" she said simply, \"and it will be vacant now.\nElana would want you to take it. Will you, please?\"\n\nThe twilight was deepening swiftly. Kirby nodded reverently, then drew\nclose to Naida.\n\n\"Naida?\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\nHe took her hand.\n\n\"I can stay here, I can consent to become, after a fashion, a King, only\nif you will reign with me as Queen. Will you, Naida? Will you love me as\nI have learned to love you during this single day in Paradise?\"\n\nShe did not answer. But presently Kirby's mind went blank for sheer joy.\nFor then Naida raised her face, and he kissed her lips.\n\nIt made no difference then that, despite the day's victory, Kirby could\nsee trouble ahead, and feared, rather than rejoiced at, the Duca's too\neasy acceptance of terms. The future could take care of itself. This\nmoment in the dusk belonged to him and Naida.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe two weeks which passed for Kirby after that particular twilight sped\nquickly. During the first morning, all attended the ceremony which was\nheld for Elana's burial in the plot of gardened ground where lay her\nancestors. Ensuing mornings were devoted to conferences in the\namphitheatre with Duca and caciques.\n\nAfter the fourth day Kirby, at Naida's insistence, moved into splendid\nquarters in the castle--a suite of chambers across the amphitheatre from\nthose in which the caciques dwelt. In practically forcing the move on\nKirby, Naida won his consent finally by agreeing to have their wedding\nceremony performed on the day of his coronation; then she would come to\nthe castle with him.\n\nThe afternoons of that first fortnight before the wedding and coronation\nwere spent in hunting and fishing. Also Kirby and Naida visited often\nthe aged people of the race, who dwelt in crystalline, vine covered\nhouses like those of the girls, but removed from them. Naida's relatives\nwere dead, but she had relatives there, and to all these aged ones, who\nsat living in the past, she did what she could to explain present\ndevelopments in the affairs of the younger generation.\n\nLast but not least, Kirby set aside certain hours each afternoon which\nhe devoted to the formation of a rifle squad amongst the girls. Six\nrifles he had, and in turn he trained each of the girls in their use,\nhaving set up a range at the foot of the plateau cliffs. The results he\ngained made him feel that the day would come soon enough when he would\ndare launch an offensive against the ape-people; and especially pleasing\nwas the sense of power over the Duca which he gained. The Duca showed no\nsign of treachery. Yet Kirby did not trust him. Never did he quite\nforget the misgivings which had lingered in his mind after the first\nconclave.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs for his relationship with Naida, that grew with every moment they\ncould steal to spend with each other. And side by side with their\ngrowing knowledge of each other grew, for Kirby, an increasing store of\nknowledge of the realm.\n\nHe learned, amongst other things, what seemed the origin of the worship\nof the Serpent, Quetzalcoatl, amongst primitive Mexican races. The time\nhad been when the People of the Temple had mingled freely with the races\nabove them; and, that they might have ready means of egress to the\nworld, they had built the tunnel through which Kirby had entered the\nValley of the Geyser. Thus, going and coming as they did, they had\nspread their cult of the worship of Quetzalcoatl; and when, eventually,\nstrife arose between the peoples of upper world and lower, and the\nPeople of the Temple withdrew to their realm, they left behind them the\nSerpent myth which was to live through countless centuries.\n\nThe tunnel, Naida said, had been abandoned when her people left the\nupper world once and for all, and its use for any reason prohibited.\nThis, Naida gave as the reason why none of them went near the tunnel\nnow, and why the cylinder of gold had lain in the canyon undiscovered.\nIt was the explanation she had promised on the day in the tower, when\nfirst she saw the cylinder.\n\nSo the days passed, until the day set aside for wedding and coronation\ndawned. On that morning, Kirby, having concluded a long conference with\nthe Duca, was walking with Naida in the gardens outside the castle.\n\n\"Tell me,\" he said to her: \"do you yourself believe that this Serpent\nhas the powers of a God?\"\n\nNaida looked at him quickly, a sudden fright in her eyes.\n\n\"I believe the Serpent exists to-day, somewhere in the distant reaches\nof the chasm, beyond the Rorroh forest.\"\n\n\"Yes, but do you believe the Serpent is God?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nActually frightened now, she looked swiftly about. But when she saw that\nthey were alone, confidence returned.\n\n\"No!\" she exclaimed. \"I do not believe Quetzalcoatl is a god. I believe\nhe is the most terrible creature anywhere in our realm, and that men\nfirst worshipped him through fear. I believe our race would be better a\nhundred times if they had never made him their God.\"\n\nKirby whistled.\n\n\"Then you do _not_ believe that the Ducas of past ages talked with him.\nYou do not believe it was Quetzalcoatl's pleasure over the great diamond\nwhich made him cease preying on your people?\"\n\n\"No! Long habit makes me show respect for these myths, and adhere to the\ncustoms of our cult, but I do not believe. I think our race gained\nimmunity for the Serpent's ravages, not through a compact with\nQuetzalcoatl, but because our builders were intelligent enough to erect\nthe castle up here on the plateau, where Quetzalcoatl could not reach\nthem. To tell the truth, I think the whole cult is false and wrong, and\nI wish Quetzalcoatl were dead and gone from the world!\"\n\nKirby smiled. In spite of Naida's reverence for certain features of the\ncult, he had long suspected that her true feelings were those she had\njust expressed. And he was glad for this new bond of understanding\nbetween them. He glanced at her with understanding and perfect trust.\n\n\"Naida, since we have talked so frankly, there is one more thing which I\nmust bring out.\"\n\nShe looked up at him.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"The Duca.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe drew closer, her perfumed body brushing his, her great eyes\ncaressing him.\n\n\"Naida, I am afraid of the man.\"\n\n\"And so am I!\" she confessed suddenly.\n\n\"It has all been too easy,\" Kirby said in a slow voice. \"There is no\ndoubt whatever that our possession of the cylinder of gold has had great\ninfluence on the Duca, and yet--\"\n\nHe paused, taking her hand.\n\n\"And yet,\" she went on for him, \"you do not believe he would have\nconceded what he has, unless he intends to make trouble?\"\n\nKirby nodded twice, emphatically.\n\n\"Well, you have trained all of us to use the rifles.\"\n\nHe smiled gravely at her understanding.\n\n\"Yes, I have. And your skill, and that of the others, with the rifles,\nwill always help us. Yet even so--\"\n\nCloser still she drew now, and there was sadness in her eyes.\n\n\"I think I see,\" she said in a voice which choked. \"When do you think he\nwill make a move to start trouble?\"\n\nKirby hesitated, then drew a long breath.\n\n\"To-day!\"\n\n\"On--on the day of our union?\" Naida echoed in dismay. \"Can you tell\nwhere or how he will strike at us?\"\n\nKirby shook his head.\n\n\"There are a hundred things he could do. Naida, I--I--Well, somehow I am\nafraid of the ceremony this afternoon--the wedding ceremony!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe felt a little shiver go through her, and would have taken her in his\narms, save that a gay cry rang in the garden then.\n\n\"Naida, Naida!\" It was her cousin, Nini, a bronze-haired youngster as\nelfin and Pucklike as her name. \"I thought we should never find you! Do\nyou realize this is your _wedding_ day, and that you're acting as if\nthere was nothing to be done?\"\n\nNini darted a mocking glance at Kirby, who grinned.\n\n\"Do come, Naida!\" cried another girl. \"Your gown is ready, and we want\nyou to ourselves for awhile.\"\n\nOther girls joined them, some singing and some carrying an obligato on\nthe sweet, flutelike instruments which Kirby had first heard as he hung\nin the throat of the geyser. In front of them all, Kirby laughed and\nkissed Naida on the forehead. But as he took leave of her thus, he\nwhispered:\n\n\"We must not let our guard relax for a second this afternoon. And I\nthink there is a more definite precaution which I will take, besides.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nSome hours later, Kirby smiled with tight-lipped satisfaction at thought\nof that precaution which he had taken. What it was only he, Nini, Ivana,\nand three other girls knew, which secrecy pleased him as much as the\nprecautionary measure itself.\n\nSeated alone in a dimly-lighted, thick-walled cell of the ancient temple\nin which the dual ceremony of wedding and coronation would take place,\nhe was waiting for the moment when the festivities would begin. Thus far\nthe Duca had done nothing. Yet Kirby's uneasiness would not leave him,\nand he continued to be thankful that, if trouble should start, the Duca\nmight not find as many trumps in his hand as he expected.\n\nA couple of hours after Kirby had left Naida and the other girls in the\ngarden, all had begun the two-mile journey from the castle to the small\nplateau on which stood this temple, where the ceremony would be held.\nNow, while Kirby waited alone, the Duca and his caciques had gone to\nanother wing of the temple. Naida, attended by her bridesmaids, had been\nassigned to a cell of their own, and the rest of the girls were waiting\nin the nave of the temple. Unable to attend the walk from their plateau\nto this, the old people of the race had remained in their crystal\nhouses.\n\nWith ten minutes more to wait, Kirby rose from a bench on which he had\nbeen seated, and began to pace his cell. It was this archaic pile of\nstone, he finally decided, which was causing his depression. Unlike the\nbright and cheerful castle, this place, older than any other building in\nthe realm, was squat, thick-walled, and gloomy. Here, in the dusky cells\nwhich lined labyrinthine corridors, the early generations of the race\nhad found protection from outside dangers. All of which was all right,\nKirby thought, but just the same he wished he had insisted upon being\nwedded in the brilliant and cheerful amphitheatre.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut presently he stopped pacing and faced the door of his cell. Then he\nbreathed a sigh of relief.\n\nFrom down the twisting corridors which wound out to the central nave,\nstole the high sweetness of soprano voices, the whisper of flutes, and\nthe mellow resonance of little gongs of jade and gold. It was the signal\nfor which he had waited.\n\nIt had been the Duca's instructions that he should come out into the\ntemple when the music began, and meet Naida there. Both would advance to\nthe altar, and when they were in place, the Duca would come to them.\nKirby, therefore, after a glance at the blue trousers and tunic of\ntanager scarlet which the girls had made for him, opened the door of his\ncell, and stepped out.\n\nIn a moment he traversed the windings of the corridor, and halted under\na flat arch at one side of the temple nave.\n\nAs he paused so, to await the appearance of Naida and her bridesmaids\nunder a similar arch directly across the temple, he held his breath. Not\neven nymphs could be as graceful as were the twenty-six girls who were\nperforming the dance of Life Immortal, which tradition decreed should be\ngiven before the ceremony by which, in this realm, two souls were\nwedded. The flash of rainbow gowns was like the swirling of light in a\nsky at dawning. The music of voices, flutes, and the little gongs of\njade, would have stirred the souls of the dead.\n\nIf only the confounded sense of approaching disaster would leave him,\nKirby thought grimly, this would be a magnificent moment. As it was, he\nturned his eyes away from the girls, and began to examine the temple.\n\nJust as Naida had told him the case would be, he found both sides of the\nnave surrounded by arches similar to the one under which he was\nstanding. Everywhere, dim and tortuous corridors led to cells like the\none he had just left. Then, in one end of the nave, loomed a closed door\nfrom behind which the Duca and caciques would appear when the couple to\nbe wedded were in place, before the altar.\n\nThe altar itself, a rectangular mass of some jadelike stone, stood at a\ndistance of perhaps twenty paces in front of the closed door. On top of\nthe greenish stones, resting on a cushion of some crimson material,\nflashed the crown which would be used at the coronation. Kirby's eyes\nwidened as he beheld a single rose-cut diamond two inches in diameter,\nmounted in an exquisitely simple bandeau of wrought gold. But, a moment\nlater, even the crown which would be his--if nothing happened--seemed\nonly a bauble compared to the other prize which he had won in this world\nbeneath the world.\n\nNaida!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe realized that the dance was ended, the music stilled, and that the\nrainbow garbed girls had formed a double line in the center of the\ntemple. Suddenly his heart beat fast, and for just a moment, as he dared\nlook full and deeply at Naida, and she smiled back at him across the\ndistance, he even forgot to be depressed.\n\nBut even as he advanced to meet her, his uneasiness returned.\n\nNow the girls were singing again, their voices raised in a triumphant\nchorale as beautiful as Naida's face with its warm red lips and smiling\neyes, as beautiful as her wedding gown that might have been woven, in\nits filminess, of mist from the sea. The bridesmaids, silent, their\nlovely faces alight, paused. But Naida came on.\n\nFrom her floated to Kirby a fragrance more overwhelming than even the\nperfume of the geyser. Presently he felt her hand on his arm, and at\nlast they stood side by side. Now again, his premonition of evil left\nhim for a flash; but again it returned.\n\n\"I love you,\" he whispered.\n\n\"I love _you_.\"\n\n\"But I am still afraid.\"\n\nNaida's smile faded.\n\n\"And I too. Oh, I've been terribly afraid! We will keep our guard!\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn front of them, on the altar, the crown diamond winked and shimmered\nin a dim light. The swelling chorus of triumph, in which the bridesmaids\nhad joined now, made the whole temple ring. Slowly, while Naida moved\neasily beside him, Kirby began to march to the altar.\n\nThen it was done, and they were halted. After both of them had given a\nlingering glance at the crown whose diamond shimmered now within their\nreach, they raised their eyes to the closed door behind the altar.\n\nThe thing was swinging open. An inch it moved, two inches.\n\nKirby waited, never taking his eyes away from the widening crack. With a\ncrashing final volume of sound, the chorus swept magnificently to its\nclimax. Then the door was flung wide.\n\nStill Kirby stood stiffly before the altar, with Naida drawn up\nsplendidly beside him. After two seconds, however, he moved.\n\nDuca and caciques were not standing in the corridor.\n\nIn the semi-darkness, the only figures visible there were squatting,\ngrotesque things whose bodies were covered with whitish hair and whose\nleathery faces were disfigured by gashes of mouths filled with enormous\nteeth.\n\nA feeling of standing face to face with final disaster, turned Kirby\nsick. As he jerked back from the altar, sweeping a paralyzed Naida with\nhim, the ape-men let out gibbering howls, half-human. With gigantic,\nhopping strides, the foremost rank of the creatures swung forward,\nstraight into the temple.\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nKirby, already falling back toward the other girls, caught Naida up in\nhis arms, and ran.\n\n\"Nini!\" he bellowed. \"Ivana! Get the rifles!\"\n\nWhile the two whom he had ordered sprang to a corridor, and four others\nfollowed, Kirby fell in with the others and dropped Naida on her feet.\nSick as he was, there was still a ray of hope, because the hard-headed\nprecaution he had taken against treachery this morning was to have Nini\nand Ivana bring the rifles here and hide them.\n\nThe first of the ape-men, snarling, laughing, had hopped beyond the\naltar, and the yellow foam of madness was slavering from his jaws. Over\nhis shoulder he howled some jargon which made his hairy legion struggle\nto catch up with him.\n\n\"Have you got any puff balls?\" Kirby snapped at Naida.\n\nShe shook her head numbly, just as Nini and Ivana swung forward with the\nMannlichers.\n\n\"No. But you had sense enough to bring the rifles! Oh, what does it\nmean?\"\n\n\"The Duca has sold himself out to the ape-man! He was helpless against\nus, and has brought them to destroy us for him. Here, Ivana, give me a\nrifle! Everyone for herself!\"\n\nThe next moment he had a Mannlicher at his shoulder.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs the thing kicked, an ape who would have reached him in two more jumps\ncrashed over with his heart torn out, the temple echoed with sound which\nthreatened to rip its solid walls apart, and bright flashes at Kirby's\nright and left told him that other rifles were getting under way.\n\nHe fired again, twice more, slaughtering an ape with each shot. The five\nother rifles were creating havoc.\n\nBlocked by a dozen torn and bleeding bodies on the floor, the\nreenforcements which still poured from the corridor, began to mill\naround amongst themselves, and the forward charge slowed down. All the\npanic which had sent the ape-men scuttling from the beach at their first\nexperience of gunfire, seemed ready to break loose again now.\n\nKirby felt it was good enough for the work of a minute.\n\n\"Get into line as I showed you how!\" he shouted. \"Rifles in the front\nrank, the others behind them. We're all right now! Keep firing!\"\n\n\"Keep behind me!\" he ordered Naida, still unarmed.\n\nThen he placed a shell in the chest of one brute who was broader and\nheavier than the others--a leader--and saw that he had increased the\ndemoralization; and from the hastily-formed front rank a volley leaped\nhot and jagged.\n\nThen the rout which had threatened broke loose. As eight ape-men slumped\ninto blubbering, bleeding heaps, the milling remainder of the horde\nturned, and in a fighting, scrambling frenzy attempted to get back to\nthe corridor.\n\nKirby let his triumph take the form of thoughts about what he would do\nto the Duca when that personage could be rounded up.\n\n\"Follow after them!\" he ordered. \"Don't stop until we have located the\nDuca. He is the one we must settle--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut he never finished.\n\nAs he himself, holding fire for a second, prepared to follow up the\nretreat, he found himself confronted by the utterly unexpected.\n\nA voice unquestionably the Duca's began to shout orders at the ape-men\nfrom somewhere down the corridor! And, riot or no riot, the tones of\nthat voice seemed to inspire the creatures with more fear than the rifle\nfire.\n\nSo suddenly the change came, that by the time Kirby flung his rifle\nagain to his shoulder, the crazy retreat had been halted, and as he\nfired again, the ape-men swung in their tracks and began to charge!\n\nThere was no time to guess by what power the Duca had turned the tables.\nThere was not even time for orders. Kirby fired twice, knowing that the\nape-men had been infused with some spirit which would bring them on in\nspite of rifle fire.\n\nNaida, unarmed, cried out behind him, and he shoved his gun at her.\n\n\"Take it!\"\n\nHe had just inserted a new clip. He handed her others.\n\n\"Fire for your lives!\" he shouted to the girls.\n\n\"But you!\" Naida gasped. \"You are unarmed!\"\n\n\"I'll be all right.\"\n\nOn the floor lay a jagged, hand-chipped knife of obsidion which had\nfallen as some ape died. Kirby grabbed it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn another second the flood of ape-men had burst in all its fury over\nhim. Crashing, thundering shots were dinning in his ears, animal death\nscreams and the Valkyrie battle cries of the girls filled the temple. He\ncould not tell how many of the apes were fighting him. As a cave-man's\nclub whizzed past his head, he drove his knife once, and yanked it\ndripping from hairy, yielding flesh to plunge it again. A sudden\nside-step carried him away from another assailant. He dropped the knife\nto snatch the gigantic club of one of the creatures he had killed.\n\nQuicker in every movement than the ape-men, he laid on, right and left,\nwith such power that blood spurted in a dozen places, and heads were\nsplit open on every side. And because of his speed, the frantic, clumsy\nblows and knife thrusts which were directed at him proved harmless.\n\nA terrific drive which smashed a snarling face into pulp, left Kirby\nfree for a second, and he emerged from the first round of battle ready\nto cut in and help the girls. But then he saw that he had gotten\nseparated from the main body.\n\n\"Naida!\" he called. \"Naida!\"\n\nA series of shots answered him, and as several apes fell, a gap was\nopened through which he saw her conducting a well ordered retreat of all\nthe girls toward the dark corridors surrounding the temple. Again Kirby\nfell to with his club, swinging, hacking, fighting with his whole\nstrength to catch up. He made headway, and hope began to come again. The\nape-men would not kill, or even harm, the girls. What they wanted was to\ncarry them off. If he and Naida together could get their party rounded\nup in the corridors, the chances were good.\n\n\"Naida!\" he shouted again. \"Coming!\"\n\nBattering down an ape in front of him, he jumped up on the corpse, and\nsaw that already the vanguard of girls had reached the first sheltering\ncorridor. Naida had been cut off from the others by eight or ten apes.\nBut even so her fire made her mistress of the situation, and she seemed\nall right.\n\nIt was just as Kirby started to jump down from the corpse that he saw\nsomething which put another complexion on the matter, and left him\nfrozen where he was.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBehind Naida, directly in the path in which her slavering aggressors\nwere slowly forcing her, a huge stone slab in the temple floor had begun\nto tilt up as if it were a trapdoor raised by an invisible hand. Within\nthe yawning opening, Kirby caught a glimpse of stone steps winding down\ninto blackness.\n\nIn a flash he saw that it was Naida, and her alone, that the ape-men\nwere after. The Duca's determination was to capture her, and it was the\npresence of this trapdoor, making capture possible, which had brought on\nthe second charge of the apes.\n\nA scream, high and wild, from Naida released Kirby from his trance of\nhorror. He leaped off the corpse, and smashed a suddenly presented skull\nlike an egg shell. Momentarily he saw Naida, too terrified to fire,\nstaring at the open trapdoor. Kirby felled two apes and felt their blood\non his arms.\n\n\"Ivana!\" he yelled. \"Help Naida, for God's sake!\"\n\nAn answering shout, not from Ivana alone but from many girls, encouraged\nhim, and he swung his club with a speed and force which would let\nnothing stand before him. But then another scream from Naida rang in his\nears.\n\n\"Naida!\" he shouted. \"It's all right! We're coming!\"\n\nHe knew, though, that it _wasn't_ all right. Fighting like a maniac, he\nopened another lane down which he glimpsed her. Fighting still, in a\nlast terrific effort to force his way down the lane to her side, he saw\nthe black opening gape at her feet; and, as Naida screamed again, a\ndozen hairy arms reached it at once, twisted the empty rifle out of her\nhands, and lifted her shining body as if it had been a feather.\n\nShouts and murderous fire were coming from the other girls, and Kirby\nswung his club as never before. But even as he fell upon the last two or\nthree apes which kept him away from Naida, those who had snatched her,\nbolted down the steps.\n\nKirby was left with the memory of Naida's great eyes fixed upon his,\nfear-filled, beseeching his protection. In a second, the ponderous\ntrapdoor crashed into place, and she was gone.\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nDazed and grief-stricken, Kirby stood in the bloody, corpse-filled nave\nof the temple, surrounded by thirty-two girls whose faces were blanched\nand most of whose eyes were tear-bright. The fight was over, and they\nwere assembled to decide what must be done, but for a time no one\nspoke.\n\nGaining the trapdoor just as it was pinioned from beneath, Kirby had\ntorn at it with bare hands. But that had been hopeless. Then he had\nbegun to fight again. But that had been hopeless also. With howls and\nscreams they started to retreat, and it had not taken Kirby long to find\nout that every part of their raid had been carefully planned, even to\nthis retreat under fire. Straight into the damp black tunnel which led\naway from the corridor behind the altar, the ape-men had leaped. And\nKirby, in hot pursuit, had heard the Duca's voice driving them on. Too\nmuch the soldier to follow in that darkness where the Duca knew every\nfoot of the way, and he knew nothing, Kirby had seen that he must go\nback to the girls and take stock.\n\nNow he looked at the strewn ape corpses, smelled the corrosive reek of\nburned powder, and tried to put aside his grief.\n\n\"The Duca,\" he said at last, \"must have been planning this with the apes\never since the first morning in the castle.\"\n\nIvana, Naida's sister, nodded.\n\n\"The Duca brought the ape-people here, kept them in the tunnel, and then\nherded them back when their work was done. I suppose it was one of the\ncaciques who opened the door when the time was right.\"\n\n\"Does anyone think we ought to try the tunnels now?\" Kirby asked.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSeveral girls shook their heads. He knew that already they felt he had\nbeen wise in giving up the pursuit. Ivana spoke.\n\n\"If the Duca and his horde stay underground, we shouldn't have a chance\nagainst them. And if they don't, we're better here.\"\n\nKirby shot a searching glance at her, somehow sure that her thoughts\nwere running parallel with his.\n\n\"You don't think they're going to stay here, do you?\"\n\n\"No, and you don't either,\" Ivana answered.\n\n\"It seems to me that they will retreat into the Rorroh as fast as they\ncan,\" Kirby then observed.\n\n\"And do you think the Duca and all the caciques will go with the apes?\"\nThis time it was Nini who spoke, and with the council so well launched,\nKirby began to feel better.\n\n\"I think,\" he answered Nini, \"that the Duca has gone over to Xlotli\naltogether. We fooled him to-day. Instead of killing or capturing us\nall, he--he only got Naida. But he won't give up. I think he is taking\nthe apes off to some place from which he can launch a new attack. And\nwe've got to stop him before he is ready to deliver another blow.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Ivana now asked.\n\n\"Do you know where the villages of the ape-people are?\"\n\n\"Yes. None of us has been very far into the Rorroh, but I could guess\nwhere some of the villages may stand.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSilence fell after that, but Kirby knew from the glint in Ivana's eyes,\nand the quick breaths which other girls drew, that they understood.\n\n\"Ivana,\" he said suddenly, \"will you go with me into the Rorroh jungle,\nand stay with me, facing down every danger it may conceal, until we have\nfound Naida and brought her back?\"\n\nA flush of life crept into Ivana's pallid cheeks.\n\n\"Yes!\"\n\nKirby faced the other girls, all of them keyed up now.\n\n\"Nini, will you go?\"\n\nNini, bronze-haired, dainty nymph of a girl, who had yet the stamina of\na man, looked at him with brave eyes. Then her hands tightened on her\nrifle, and she stepped forward.\n\n\"When will you have us start?\" Ivana asked in a low voice.\n\n\"Now!\" Kirby answered, and, taking up the rifle which lay beside\nhim--the same with which Naida had fought--he looked at the other\ngirls.\n\n\"There is not one of you,\" he said slowly, \"who would not go willingly\non this quest. But the pursuit party must be small and mobile. And\nthere is another duty. To all of you I leave the care of the castle and\nthe plateau. Take the three rifles I shall leave behind, do what you can\nto reassure the old people, and hold the plateau safe until we return.\"\n\nA murmur of girls' voices sounded in the temple. Kirby motioned to Nini\nand Ivana, and followed by a low cheer, they moved off together.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe night was on them, where they crouched in a cave above a swiftly\nflowing river. Kirby, rifle across his knees, sat peering out across the\nblack, invisible stretches of the forest. His nostrils quivered to this\nmingled smells of fresh growth and fetid decay of the grotesque land. In\nhis ears shrilled the creaking and scraping of insects, the flap of\nunseen wings, the distant bellowing grunt of some unseen, unknown\nanimal.\n\n\"I cannot sleep,\" Ivana said presently, from back in the cave.\n\n\"Hush,\" he whispered, \"you will wake Nini.\"\n\n\"But I am already awake!\" came her answer. \"I--I cannot forget the white\nsnakes which slid from that tree when you tried to cut firewood.\"\n\n\"Hush,\" Kirby murmured again. \"Presently the moon will rise on the earth\nabove, and light will come here. Even if the jungle is terrible, were\nyou not born with courage? Go to sleep now, both of you, because you\nmust relieve me soon.\"\n\nAs silence fell again, he knew that the real thing behind their\nnervousness was their ghastly doubt about what the night was bringing to\nNaida. But none of them spoke of Naida. So sickening were the\npossibilities that Kirby would not permit conjecture to occupy even his\nmind when, at length, the sound of even breathing told him that Nini and\nIvana slept.\n\nAfter dreary passing of an hour, a faint light grew over the jungle,\nsilver and clear, and Kirby let his mind run back to the two deserted\nape-men communities which they had found and searched before dusk sent\nthem to the cave. From the signs of hasty departure, it looked as though\na far-reaching order had taken the brutes away from their dwellings, and\nsent them--somewhere.\n\nThat somewhere seemed likely to be the great central community which\nIvana said was rumored to exist in the far reaches of the Rorroh. The\nproblem was how to locate the community through the hideous country. But\nKirby presently drove the question from his head. To-morrow's evils\ncould best be faced when morrow dawned.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEnough light had grown now so that the swirling bosom of the river, and\na strip of sand directly below the cliff in which their cave was set,\nwere visible. As Kirby let his eyes wander to the lush growth beyond the\nsand, he heard something which made him stir uneasily. Some creature\nwhich suggested power and hugeness immeasurable was moving there.\n\nThe brush parted, and he saw plainly an animal with the bulk of a\ntwo-story house. On two feet the nightmare thing stood, as lightly as a\ncat, and then came down on all four feet as it ambled out on the sand\nand extended into the lapping river a tremendous beak studded with\nteeth. A smell of crushed weeds and the musty odor like that of a lion\nhouse filled the night. The tyranosaur--it was more like a tyranosaur\nthan anything else--breathed heavily and guzzled in great mouthfuls of\nwater.\n\nKirby sat perfectly still. He hoped the thing would go away. But the\ntyranosaur did not go away. All at once it hissed loudly and stood up,\nits eyes glowing green and baleful, and Kirby leaned forward.\n\nFrom the water was slithering another creature with a gigantic,\nquivering, jelly body. Kirby saw to his horror that, in addition to four\nshort legs with webbed, claw-tipped feet, there sprouted from the body a\nnumber of octopus tentacles. From the scabrous mottle of the head,\ncruel, unintelligent, bestial eyes glared at the rearing tyranosaur.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOne of the serpentine tentacles whipped out, slapped against the\ntyranosaur's fore-shoulder to call forth a hiss and a short bellow. Then\nother tentacles waved in the moonlight, and in a flash the tyranosaur\nwas enmeshed as by a score of slimy cables. He was not altogether\nhelpless. Suddenly the steam shovel of a beak buried itself in the jelly\nbody of the water animal, and there spurted out a flood of inky liquid.\nThe water animal emitted a sickening gurgle. But the tyranosaur's\nadvantage was only temporary. Closer and closer drew the ugly, scabrous\ntentacles. The tyranosaur never had a chance. Its green eyes flared, the\nshovel beak plunged and slashed, but never for a second did the\ntentacles relax. As Kirby stared, he saw the water animal begin to back\nup, dragging its gigantic enemy with it. For a second the whole night\nwas hideous with the sound of hisses, gurgles, dashing water. Then the\nriver boiled once and for all, and both animals sank in its depths.\n\nKirby chafed cold hands together and shivered a little, then turned to\nsee if Nini and Ivana had heard the struggle.\n\nFortunately, however, they still slept. And as if this peace which was\nupon them were an omen of good, the jungle continued quiet for the next\nhour. Kirby wakened them at last, and after a snatched nap, was in turn\nawakened.\n\nThe three of them started again when the first glimmerings of dawn came\nto the forest. Of food there was plenty--fruits which grew in profusion,\nand some roots which Nini grubbed out of the earth. Having started along\nthe first trail which they encountered beside the river bank, they ate\nas they walked.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKirby judged they had kept their steady gait for more than two hours\nbefore a slight widening of the trail roused him from the preoccupation\ninto which he had fallen.\n\n\"See there,\" he exclaimed to both girls, and pointed at a grove of trees\nwith fanlike leaves which towered up to the right of the trail. \"What\nare those big bundles fastened to the lower limbs?\"\n\nIvana glanced at Nini, who nodded as if in answer to a question.\n\n\"This must be one of the places where the ape-people leave their dead,\"\nNini answered. \"The bundles--But come over to them.\"\n\nKirby forced his way ahead until he stood beneath a huge, unsavory\nbundle wrapped in roughly woven brown fibre, and wedged in a fork\nbetween two limbs. Judging from the ugly odor which overhung the grove,\nthere could be no question about what the bundle contained. Nini and\nIvana, glancing at the scores of similar bundles which burdened the\ntrees of the whole grove, made wry faces. Kirby slung his rifle in the\ncrook of his arm, and nodded toward the trail.\n\n\"There must be a village somewhere near,\" he said.\n\nA mile farther on they found what they were seeking, a colony of seventy\nor eighty conical dwellings of mud and thatch, which were ranged in a\ndouble circle about a central common of bare, well-trodden earth. It\ntook no long reconnaissance to discover that the town was deserted\ncompletely of all inhabitants.\n\nIvana beckoned and darted to one of the nearest huts, and Kirby,\nfollowing her, found lying on the uneven earth floor within, a\nhalf-skinned animal which resembled a small antelope. An obsidion knife\nbeside the carcass, the disordered condition of a couch of grass, the\nsour odor of recent animal occupancy, all told their story.\n\n\"The owner left in a hurry,\" Kirby observed aloud.\n\nNini, who had gone beyond, to a larger hut which might have belonged to\na king ape, called out excitedly to them.\n\n\"A great number of apes have eaten a hurried meal here!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKirby entered the shadowed, foul-smelling interior of the central hut to\nfind her statement true. Broken meats, some raw, some cooked, lay on the\ndirt floor, and scattered bits of fruit were mingled with them. The\nashes of a burned out fire at the hut entrance were cold, but had not\nbeen for long.\n\n\"Do you think--\" Ivana began.\n\n\"I think the whole of the Duca's horde came this way, fed, and went on,\ntaking everyone with them,\" Kirby finished.\n\n\"But which direction did they take?\" asked Nini, who was standing at the\ndoor of the big hut and had already begun to examine the crowding,\ngreen, inscrutable walls of jungle which foamed up to the clearing on\nall sides.\n\nNo less than seven trails wound away into the dark country beyond, and\nKirby saw that the question would not be an easy one.\n\nHaving hastily circled the clearing and peered down one trail after\nanother without finding a clue, he knew that it was the Duca's\nintelligence which had made the ape-people depart without leaving even\ntracks behind them. He did not like the situation.\n\n\"Well,\" he rumbled to his companions, \"we may as well take our choice.\nOne chance in seven of coming out right!\"\n\nBut the words were hardly out of his mouth before he pulled himself up\nwith a jerk, and cursed himself for having given in.\n\n\"Ivana! Nini!\" Sharpness, a sudden ring of hope edged his voice. \"Am I\nseeing things, or is that--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs he pointed to a huge aloe bush down one of the trails to their left,\nthey started to run. Then Kirby knew that he was not seeing things. What\nhis first inspection of the trails had failed to show, he saw plainly\nnow.\n\nTied loosely to one branch of the aloe bush, almost concealed amidst the\ndeep green of foliage, was a bit of white cloth! In a second Kirby was\nholding out to his companions a tiny strip of Naida's wedding gown.\n\n\"She knew we would come!\" He stared down the trail with narrowed, keen\neyes.\n\nHow Naida had contrived to leave her signal was more than they knew. The\nfact that she _had_ done so, sent all three of them down the trail at\ndriving speed.\n\nAn hour passed, then another, and the morning which had been barely born\nwhen they first took the trail, wore on to the sultriness and vast,\ncolored light of a tropical noon. Twice the main trail forked, and twice\nthey found an unobtrusive bit of cloth to guide them beyond the works.\nWhen the hands of Kirby's still useful watch pointed to twelve, they\npaused to eat and rest. Then they pushed on.\n\nMeanwhile, the country through which they passed left Kirby with a clear\nunderstanding of why Naida and her people had shunned the Rorroh forest\ndown the centuries of time.\n\nJust one thing which stuck in his head was the sight of a small creature\nlike a marmoset, sticking an inquisitive nose into the heart of a\nsickly-sweet plant which resembled a terrestrial nepenthe. No sooner had\nthe little pink snout touched the green and maroon splotched petals,\nthan the plant writhed, closed its leaves, and swallowed the monkey\nwhole. Little squeaks of agony and terror sounded for a moment, and\nceased.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt midafternoon they paused in a spot where a forest of trees with\nwhorled tops were slowly being strangled to death by immense orchids of\nevery conceivable shape and color, and by a kind of creeping mistletoe\nwhich grew almost as they watched. Here also, the ground was covered\nwith fluffy, grey-green moss which seethed constantly as if it were a\ncarpet of maggots. Both Ivana and Nini warned Kirby on his life not to\ntouch or go near the moss, and a moment later he knew why.\n\nFrom the forest came the flash of a small, five-toed horse being pursued\nby some animal with a hyena head that barked. At the edge of the mossy\nglade the hyena swerved aside, but the terrified horse plunged straight\nout on the carpet of moss. Instantly the air was filled with the sound\nof animal screams, and a series of tiny, muffled explosions. A cloud of\ngreenish-red mist swirled about the horse. Quivering, still screaming,\nthe animal went down on its knees, and as the reddish green smoke fell\non him and settled, it became a mass of growing moss spores.\n\nBefore Kirby's eyes, the pitiful animal was covered by a shroud of green\nthat spread over him and cloaked him, licking over all with tiny sounds\nlike far off muffled drums as fresh spore cases developed and burst. The\nscreams died. Even as Kirby drew the girls to him and they passed on,\nthe horse's nostrils, eyes, mouth were filled with choking green moss;\nand he lay still.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn and on, deeper into the jungle Kirby pushed, and never for a moment\ndid his companions falter. But the way was not so easy now, for nerves\nwere jaded, muscles sore, and no human will could have been powerful\nenough to cast aside the growing fear for Naida.\n\nFear came finally to a head when, toward dusk, Kirby sighted a fork\nahead of them, approached it confidently to look for Naida's sign, and\nfound nothing.\n\n\"Oh Lord!\" he muttered, and realized that it was the first time any of\nthem had spoken for long.\n\n\"There must be something to guide us!\" Ivana exclaimed as she searched\nwith questing eyes through the swiftly deepening gloom of evening.\n\nNini, making an effort to keep up hope in spite of the paleness which\ncame to her lovely face, darted down both paths, glancing as she went at\nevery bush and shrub. But she returned in a moment, and as she shook\nher head, her great eyes were somber.\n\nKirby grunted, scratched behind his ear. Then, however, he stifled an\nexclamation, and clutched at the hands of both girls.\n\nOn one of the two trails appeared suddenly in the dusk an ape-creature.\nKirby saw at once that the thing was small--a female undoubtedly--and\nthat it had spied them and was moving toward them with all speed. And\nborne in upon him most certainly was the fact that the ape-woman was\nmaking signals of peace. In her outstretched hand flickered through the\ngloom a strip of cloth that was gauzy and white.\n\nAgain--a strip of Naida's gown.\n\n\"If you know any words of her tongue, call to her,\" Kirby said sharply.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIvana obeyed. All three of them started forward. The ape-woman, after\nreturning the hail in creaking gutturals, came up to them, and with an\nunexpected look of pathos and entreaty in her face, began to address the\ngirls with a flood of talk.\n\nWord after creaking word she poured out while Nini and Ivana listened in\nsilence. Finally Kirby could stand the suspense no longer.\n\n\"What is it, Ivana? What does she say? Your eyes are lighting up with\nhope! Tell me--\"\n\nIvana smiled and turned toward him, while the ape-woman still looked her\nentreaty.\n\n\"She says,\" Ivana announced bluntly, \"that she and the other women\namongst their people, do not want any of the girls of our race to be\ntaken by their males. Already the men are quarreling about Naida. They\nwill not look at their own women. Naida told this woman that we would be\nfollowing, and sent her to lead us to the place where the ape-people are\nassembling!\"\n\nKirby felt his lips tightening in a grim smile at the thought that\njealousy was not unknown even to the semi-human creatures of this\nneither world. He looked at Nini and Ivana during a stretched out\nsecond. Then he moved.\n\n\"Good,\" he snapped. \"We go on at once.\"\n\nThat was his only recognition of what was surely one of the important\nhappenings of a lifetime. But for all that, his tired brain, which so\nlately had felt the chill of black depression, was suddenly set on fire\nwith triumph and thanksgiving.\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nAs they marched rapidly, the ape-woman, who called herself Gori,\nsucceeded in making them understand that most of the ape-tribes,\ncommanded by the Duca and his caciques, were assembled in the central\ncommunity toward which they were heading, that grave danger of some sort\nthreatened Naida, and that the need for haste was great. But what the\ndanger was, the two girls could not understand.\n\n\"We can't make out what is going to happen--what they plan to do\nto-night,\" Ivana whispered at last to Kirby. \"All Gori says is that we\nmust rescue Naida and take her away, and must take the Duca away so that\nhe cannot influence the men any more. And she keeps repeating that we\nmust hurry.\"\n\n\"And you can't find out what we must rescue Naida _from_?\"\n\nIvana shook her head.\n\n\"I'm afraid we're facing something of an appalling nature, as dangerous\nto ourselves as to Naida. But I know nothing more.\"\n\nBy the time the silver glow which corresponded to moonlight flooded the\njungle, Gori had left the open trail, and was leading them across\ncountry which humans could not have negotiated without the guidance she\noffered. Advancing cautiously always, she stopped for long seconds at a\ntime to reconnoitre, shifting her huge ears about and changing their\nshape, twitching her nostrils, and glancing hither and thither with\nbright little eyes. Sometimes they passed immense spike-tipped flowers\nten feet in diameter, with fleshy yellow leaves which gave out a\nnauseating stench. Vines with long, recurved thorns and blossoms of deep\nscarlet, laced the undergrowth together and made passing dangerous.\nFire-flies drifted past, and all above and about them flapped moths as\nbig as bats.\n\nKirby, his clothes almost torn from his body, sweat pouring from every\npore, heard the labored breathing of the girls, and wondered how they\ncould hang on. But they did, and after a long time, Gori, halting in the\nmidst of a slight clearing, held up a warning hand.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA queer sensation came over Kirby. As he stared and listened, he\nrealized that the twinkles he saw far ahead were not fire-flies, as he\nhad thought, but lights. In the frosted moon glow, Nini and Ivana drew\nclose, and Kirby clasped their hands and pressed them for a second. Too\ntired to exult further he was, even though they seemed close to their\ngoal of goals.\n\nGori swung her hairy arm in a signal, and with rifles clasped carefully,\nthey began to advance. When, five minutes later, they stood in the heart\nof a rank glade beyond which they could see nothing, Gori spoke to the\ntwo girls in her creaking whisper, and Nini laid a restraining hand on\nKirby's.\n\n\"We have gone as far as Gori dares! She says we must climb a tree here,\nand watch what will go on in a clearing just beyond this thicket.\"\n\n\"And we still don't know what we're getting into,\" Kirby muttered.\n\nBut at any rate they had reached the end of their march.\n\nExultation did come to Kirby now, but still he was too completely\nfagged, as were both girls, to give much sign. Gori pointed to a tree\nsome fifty feet away, which shot up to a great, foliage-crowned height.\nThey moved toward it, and in a moment were climbing, Gori first, the\ngirls after her, and Kirby last.\n\n\"Here we are,\" Ivana presently whispered, at the same time drawing\nherself out on a limb just beneath one on which Gori and Nini had\ncrawled.\n\nKirby found himself hedged in by tasselated leaves through which he\ncould not see. The foliage thinned, however, and soon Ivana halted,\nperched herself in a comfortable position. Kirby, making himself at ease\nbeside her, and seeing that Nini and Gori were in place, turned his eyes\nslowly, expectantly downward.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt first, all that he saw from his bird's-eye perch, was a circular\nclearing two hundred yards across, which was surrounded on all sides by\nlowering jungle. In the exact center of the circle, like a splotch of\nink on gray paper, there gaped a deep hole which might have measured six\nfeet in diameter. Around this hole, eight poles as tall and stout as\ntelephone poles stood up in bristling array. The moonlight showed that\nthe whitish earth of the clearing was tamped smooth as though thousands\nof creatures had danced or walked about there for centuries. But not a\nliving form was visible.\n\nA grunt of disappointment escaped Kirby after that one look. When he\nlooked beyond the clearing, however, a change came to his feelings.\n\nA quarter of a mile away, lights were twinkling--the same ones which had\nbeen visible on the last stretch of the journey. And the moonlight\ntouched the little conical roofs of fully two hundred huts of the\nape-people. No sound was audible save the soughing of night wind in the\ntrees, the shrilling of insects. Nevertheless, there stole over Kirby\nall at once a feeling that the great ape-village was crowded to\noverflowing. What was more, he felt himself touched by an eery\nsensation--familiar these days--of evil to come.\n\nIvana, seated with her rifle across her knees, stirred on the limb\nbeside him.\n\n\"Oh,\" she whispered suddenly, \"I am afraid of this place!\"\n\nKirby took her hand.\n\n\"I know. Maybe it is the sensation of all the legions of the apes herded\ntogether so silently in their village. I wish we knew what to expect\nfrom them. I wish--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut he broke off, and called softly to Nini on the limb above. She\nlooked down with a drawn expression about her mouth.\n\n\"Are you all right?\" Kirby whispered.\n\n\"Yes. But--Well, are both of _you_ all right? Gori says we have reached\nhere in time, but I--\" A gasp of uneasiness escaped her, and Kirby heard\nIvana echo it. \"There is something about that black, silent hole out\nthere in the clearing, and about those poles sticking up like fangs,\nthat makes me terribly, terribly afraid. Oh, what are they planning?\nWhere is Naida? What are they going to do to her?\"\n\nKirby whistled in a low key. He had not thought about the black hole in\nthe clearing.\n\n\"Hum,\" he muttered, \"that's interesting. Ivana, Nini, what do you\nsuppose--\"\n\nBut he got no answer. Gori's twitching lips grimaced them to silence.\n\nThe next instant, the stillness of the night was hurled aside by a\nhowling, gurgling shout from a hundred, a thousand hysterically\ndistended ape throats. With the sickening sound came from the village\nthe sullen roaring of drums.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTen minutes later, a Kirby who was cold with apprehension and wonder\nlooked down from his leaf-crowned height at such a spectacle as he knew\nhuman eyes had never before seen. The shouting had died away, the drums\nwere silenced. Crammed into the clearing, their foul, hairy bodies\npacked close together, the silver light glinting against rolling red\neyes and grinning white teeth, stood fully a thousand apes!\n\nOnce the first tumult of shouting in the village had died, they had come\non in silence, and in orderly procession. Those who bore the\ndrums--huge gourds with heads of stretched skin--had formed a line\nentirely around the outer diameter of the circular clearing. Then\nothers, lugging vats of a dark, heady-smelling liquor, had deposited\ntheir burden beside the drums, and formed a second circle. The balance\nof the thousand had crowded itself together as best it might, leaving\nbare the center of the clearing with its black hole and fangs of poles.\nKirby, looking down at these legions, did not wonder that cold sweat\nwetted his back.\n\nCapable of thinking about only one thing--Naida--he was trying with all\nhis strength not to think. Ivana, her face blanched in the light which\nfiltered their camouflage of leaves, sat rigid, her hands locked about\nher cold rifle. On the branch above, Nini and Gori were as still as\nmummies. No one had spoken since the vanguard of apes had appeared.\n\nBut at last Nini leaned close to Kirby.\n\n\"Have you any idea of what all this means?\"\n\nA draught of hot night air carried up a stench of drunkenness, and the\ngoaty odor of massed animal bodies.\n\n\"No,\" Kirby whispered. \"I suppose, from Gori's having brought us here,\nthat Naida is going to appear somehow. We've simply got to trust that\nGori knows what she is about.\"\n\n\"But listen--\" Ivana suppressed a shudder. \"Suppose they should bring\nNaida here presently to force her to take part in some ceremony at which\nwe can only guess. Gori, who thinks we can work miracles, supposes we\ncan rescue Naida. But I--I'm not so certain. Is there _anything_ we can\ndo?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was exactly that question which had made Kirby fight to keep himself\nfrom thinking. His face turned gray before he answered. But answer he\ndid, finally.\n\n\"Yes, there is one thing we can do, Ivana. We've got to be frank with\neach other, and so far, this is the _only_ thing I've been able to\nfigure out. If Naida is brought here, and they make any move to harm her\nor torture her, we can, and we will, shoot her quickly, before harm or\npain comes.\"\n\nA grim silence settled once more. During the last miles of march in the\njungle, there had persisted in Kirby's heart the hope that there would\nbe at least _something_ favorable in whatever situation they might\nencounter. His spirits were so low now that he dared not speak again.\n\nAmongst the noiseless sea of ape-men below them came, every now and\nagain, a little ripple of motion as some anthropoid shadow fell out of\nhis place, approached the liquor vats, and swilled down the black brew,\na quart at a gulp. But mostly there was little commotion. Ivana drew a\nsibilant breath and said that she wished something would happen.\n\n\"I wish,\" Kirby answered tensely, \"that we knew _what_ is going to\nhappen.\"\n\nBut the nightmare waiting was not to go on forever. Kirby leaned forward\nand pointed.\n\nIt was only instinct that had made him know action must come. For a\nsecond, no change in the expression of the ape-men, no movement in their\ncrammed ranks, was visible. Then, however, a queer, subdued grunting\nrumbled deep down in many throats, and those who had faced the\nhundred-foot space in the center of the clearing squatted down on their\nhams.\n\nIn the back of the crowd necks were craned. The stronger shoved the\nweaker in an effort to get a better view of the cleared stage, and a few\nape-men who had been drinking hurried on unsteady legs to their places.\n\n\"The drums!\" Kirby whispered then.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith almost military precision, the scores of leather-faced creatures\nwho had led the procession into the clearing, clasped the skin-headed\ngourds to their shaggy bellies, and stood with free arm raised as\nthough awaiting a signal. Nini moved in her position, and Kirby felt\nIvana shiver and edge close to him.\n\nFrom the front rank of the crowd, there sprang up a great male creature\nwith the face of a gargoyle and the body of a jungle giant. Just once he\nreeled on his feet, as though black alcohol had befuddled him, then he\nsteadied himself, flung both arms above his head, and rolled out a\ncommand which burst upon Kirby's ears like thunder.\n\nIt was as if the whole cavern of the lower world, and the whole of the\nround earth itself, had been rocked uneasily, dreadfully by the\nbellowing, crashing explosion of the drums. Maddened by the turmoil he\nhad let loose, the gargoyle-faced giant ape-man leered about him with\nblood-shot, drunken eyes, and beat on his cicatrized chest with massive\nfists. Suddenly he let out a bellow. Straight up into the air he sprang\nin a wild leap. When he came down, he was dancing, and the portentious,\nthe sickeningly mysterious ceremony for which such solemn preparation\nhad been made, was begun.\n\nKirby drew a rasping breath. Knowing that there must be some definite\nreason for the dance having begun just when and as it had, he looked\nbeyond the solitary dancing giant, on beyond the crowded legions of the\napes, toward the village. There, where the main trail from the community\napproached the clearing, he saw precisely the thing which he had both\nhoped desperately and dreaded terribly to find.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHeaded directly toward the clearing, moving down the trail with slow,\nmajestic pace, came a procession headed by a bodyguard of ape-men and\naugmented by other men whose nakedness was covered by unmistakable,\nunforgetable priestly robes of gray.\n\nAll at once the ape-people in the clearing began to scuffle apart,\nopening a lane down which the procession might pass to the central\nstage with its dancer, its ink spot orifice, and its fangs of tall\npoles. Kirby, watching the congregation, watching the majestic approach\nof gray robes through the night, wiped away from his forehead a sweat of\nfear.\n\n\"I think,\" Nini called in a voice pitched high to outsound the drums,\n\"that the--the Duca is with them!\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Kirby pointed jerkily. \"In the middle of the procession, there,\nsurrounded by his caciques!\"\n\nThe Duca!\n\nYet his approach did not hold Kirby. Directly behind the priests were\nemerging now from the jungle a new company of ape-men. Squinting his\neyes, Kirby saw that two of them were lugging on a pole across their\nshoulders a curious burden--a sort of monstrous bird cage of barked\nwithes. Crouched on the floor of the cage in a little motionless, white\nheap--\n\nBut Kirby closed his eyes. Ivana, cowering against him, gulped as though\nshe were going to be sick. Nini leaned down from above and looked at\nthem with dilated eyes. Although none of them spoke, all knew that they\nhad found Naida at last.\n\nKirby was the first to pull himself up. Opening his eyes, he stared long\nat the white gowned, motionless shape within the cage. Next summing up\nthe whole situation--the cage surrounded by an armed band, the clearing\ncrammed with a thousand ape-men--he shook his head. Afterward, he made a\nquick movement with his hands.\n\nIvana, seeing that movement, seeing the expression on his face, started\nout of her daze.\n\n\"No! No! Oh, there must be some other way out for her! There must--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHer cry, half a shriek, did not change Kirby's look. What he had done\nwith his hands was to throw a shell into the chamber of his rifle. Now\nhe held the rifle grimly, ready to carry it to his shoulder.\n\nThe procession with the bodyguard of ape-men at its head, the renegade\nDuca and his caciques following next, and the cage bringing up the rear,\nadvanced relentlessly down the lane to the central stage. The\ngargoyle-faced ape-man who held the stage alone danced with increasing\nwildness, writhing, twisting, with weird suppleness. Upon the dancing\ngiant the procession bore down, and before him it finally halted.\n\nThe halt left the Duca and the king ape facing each other, and the ape\nended his dance. After each had given a salute made by raising their\narms, both Duca and the king ape turned to face the creatures who were\nstanding with the cage slung across their shoulders. Whereupon the\nbearers of the cage advanced with it until they stood between two of the\ntall poles. There, facing the ominous hole in the center of the\nclearing, with a pole on either side of them, the ape-men lowered the\ncage to the ground.\n\nKirby felt his last hope and courage ebbing. Now he noticed that each\npole was equipped with a rope which passed through a hole near its top,\nlike a thread through the eye of a needle. And while he stared at the\ndangling ropes, the ape-men made one end of each fast to a ring in the\ntop of the cage. The next instant they leaped back, and began to heave\nat the other end of the lines.\n\nFrom the drums came a quicker pounding, a more head-splitting volume of\nthunder. Over all the ape-people who watched the show, passed a shiver\nof what seemed to be whole-souled, ecstatic satisfaction. Slowly, as the\ntwo ape-men heaved hard, the cage swung off the ground, and slowly rose\nhigher and higher into the moonlit air.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen finally the thing hung high above the heads of the multitude,\nswaying midway between its tall supports, the ape-men who had done the\nhoisting fastened their lines to cleats on the poles. Then they turned\nto the Duca and the giant king who stood behind them, executed a queer,\nlumbering bow, and fell back to the rear.\n\nThe next moment it seemed as though every creature in the clearing--men\nand those who were only half men--had gone crazy. The king flung himself\ninto the air as if he were a mass of bounding rubber. Following his\nlead, the whole assembly let out howls that drowned even the drums, and\nthen began to sway, to squirm, to leap, even as their king was doing\nbefore them.\n\nThe caciques and the Duca joined in the madness of foul dancing as\nheartily as any there. Their eyes were flaming, their long robes\nflapping, their beards streaming.\n\nOn his perch in the tree Kirby muttered an oath which was lost, swept\naway like a breath, in the shrieking turmoil of sound. Then he turned to\nIvana.\n\n\"They've brought Naida here to sacrifice her.\"\n\n\"But _why_?\" Ivana's sweet face was frozen in lines of horror. \"I've\nbeen able to guess what was going to happen to her. But--_sacrifice_.\nWhy will it be that?\"\n\n\"Don't you see?\" Looking up to include Nini, Kirby found his hands\nquivering against his rifle. \"It is easy to understand. In the temple\nyesterday, what the Duca hoped to do was to kidnap most, or all, of the\ngirls for the ape-people. But he was able to get only Naida. The first\nresult was that the ape-men started to quarrel over the one girl. From\nwhat Gori says, trouble started on all sides at once. It became\ninadvisable to let Naida live. So the Duca, in his shrewdness, planned a\nsacrifice. By sacrificing Naida, he rids himself of a source of\ncontention amongst the ape-men. He also hopes his act will win favor\nfrom his Gods, and make them help him when he is ready to launch a new\nattempt to capture _all_ the girls.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIvana and Nini looked at each other, then at Kirby, and horror was\netched deeper into their faces.\n\n\"I think,\" gulped Ivana, \"that you--are right. I--begin to understand.\"\n\nNini leaned close to them.\n\n\"Tell us, then, _how_ this sacrifice is to be made.\"\n\nSilent at that, Kirby presently made a heavy gesture toward the\nmaelstrom of howling, leaping animals below them.\n\n\"I couldn't guess at first. Now I think I can. They have placed her in\nthat cage and swung it high above the black hole you were afraid of.\nWhat can that mean except that she is to be offered to--to--\"\n\nIt was a monstrous theory which had stunned his hope and courage, and to\nvoice the thing in words was too gruesome.\n\nHis bare suggestion, however, made Ivana pass a hand limply over her\nforehead and look at him with blank, stricken eyes. Nini tottered so\nuncertainly that Gori, who had remained motionless and silent\nthroughout, had to steady her with muscular arms. If it was impossible\nfor Kirby to utter his fears aloud, he had no need to speak to make them\nunderstood.\n\n\"And--and we can do nothing?\" Nini choked at last.\n\n\"You can see for yourself how she is surrounded. If we had been able to\nget here sooner, we might have done something. Now--\"\n\nKirby's voice trailed off, and he gave an agonized look at his rifle.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe terrific dance in the clearing was going forward with madness which\nincreased second by second. It had been a general debauch at first, with\nthe whole thousand of the apes bellowing and squirming. Now a change was\nbecoming apparent. Red eyes which had caught the glare of ultimate\nmadness, focused upon the caciques, the Duca, and the great king, all of\nwhom were swaying together on the central stage. As they looked, the\nhorde of ape-men broke loose with a heightened frenzy of noise and\nmovement too overwhelming for Kirby to follow. He leaned forward, making\nan effort to see what actions of Duca and king could be so influencing\nthe congregation. And then he saw.\n\nBoth of those central figures, the one with hair-covered giant's body\nand evilly grimacing face, the other with white robes and whipping\nsilver hair, were definitely emulating the motions of a serpent!\n\nIt was as if the angles and joints had disappeared from their bodies.\nThey were become gliding lengths of muscle as swift, as loathsome in\ntheir supple dartings and coilings as any snake lashing across the\nexpanses of primeval jungle. Lost in what they did, unconscious of the\nnightmare, demoniac legion before which they danced, they had eyes only\nfor the empty, ominous hole beneath Naida's cage. As they circled the\nhole, drawing ever and ever closer to it, they opened and closed their\narms with the motion of great serpent jaws biting and striking.\n\n\"God in Heaven!\" Kirby cried in a voice which shrilled with horror and\nthen broke.\n\nIt was not alone the Duca's dance which had wrung the shout from him. As\nNina and Ivana shrieked and cowered, as Gori twitched, gasped, buried\nher head in trembling arms, Kirby knew that Naida was fully aware of\nwhat was going on--had been, perhaps, from the beginning.\n\nSlowly, numbly she raised herself from her huddled position, rose to her\nknees, and clutching with despairing hands at the sides of her cage,\nlooked out from between the bars.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe king and Duca edged closer to the hole until they were dancing upon\nits very brink. From that position, they stared down into the depths,\ntheir faces tense and strained. And then their look became radiant,\nexalted, joyous. Suddenly the Duca leaped back. He shrieked something\nat the gargoyle ape, and they flung their arms high in a commanding,\nmighty signal which was directed across the nightmare legion of ape-men,\nto the drums.\n\nAs Kirby winced in expectancy, the drums ceased to roar. Over the night\nsmashed a hideous concussion of silence, deafening, absolute. And the\nape-men--all of them--and the Duca, his caciques, and the king, ceased\nto dance. As if a whirlwind had hurled them, the caciques scattered in\nall directions. The Duca, having already leaped back from the gaping\norifice, suddenly turned and ran with blurred speed over to the\nslobbering, deadly still front rank of the congregation. An instant\nlater the king crouched down beside him, and the whole stage was left\nbare and deserted.\n\nKirby gave one look at Naida, found her staring down, deeper and deeper\ndown, into the hole which yawned beneath her so blackly. Then Kirby\nlowered his eyes until he, too, stared at the opening.\n\nAmidst the pressing silence there stole from the earth an uneasy sound\nas of some immense thing waking and stirring. Came a hissing note as of\nescaping steam. The tribes of the ape-men waited in silent rapture.\nKirby saw Naida still looking down, and felt Ivana crouch against him,\nfainting. He held his rifle tighter, and continued to stare.\n\nSomething red, like two small flames, licked up above the edge of the\npit. Then Kirby gasped and all but went limp. Up and out into the\nmoonlight slid a glistening white lump that moved from side to side and\nlicked at the night with flickering black and red tipped forked tongue.\n\nThe glistening white lump was the head of Quetzalcoatl, buried God of\nthe People of the Temple. It was wider and bigger than an elephant's,\nand the round snake body could not have been encircled by a man's two\narms. Kirby guessed at the probable length of the Serpent in terms of\nhundreds of feet.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSick, numb, he glanced at Naida, who was still staring silently, and\nhitched his rifle half up to his shoulder. But he did not look down the\nsights yet. Although it was time, and more than time, that he fired, he\nwould not do it until the last possible second, when nothing else\nremained.\n\nSlowly from the hole slid a fifteen or twenty-foot column of the body,\nand Quetzalcoatl, thus reared, looked about him with a pair of eyes\nimmense and not like snake's eyes, but heavily lidded and lashed; eyes\nthat stared in a wise, evil way; eyes glittering and round and black as\nink. After a time the mouth opened in a silent snarl, showing great\nwhite fangs and recurved simitars of teeth. The head was snow white,\nleperous in its scabby, scaly roughness, with here and there a patch of\nwhat looked like greenish fungus. From the rounded body trailed a short,\nunnatural, sickening growth of--feathers. Old and evil and very wise the\nFeathered Serpent seemed as his forked tongue flickered in and out and\nhe stared at the ape horde, who stared back silently.\n\nHe seemed in no hurry to devote his attention to the cage set forth for\nhis delectation. The black eyes rolled beneath their lashes, staring now\nat the Duca in his robes, and again at the huddled ape-people. But after\nghastly seconds, Quetzalcoatl at last had seen enough.\n\nAgain the moonlight glinted against simitar teeth as the great, white,\npuffy mouth yawned in its silent snarl. Quetzalcoatl reared his head a\nlittle higher, slid further from his hole, and then looked up at the\ndangling cage of barked withes.\n\nIn Kirby's mind stirred cloudily a remembrance of moments in the past:\nthe feel of Naida's first kiss, her look as they advanced to the altar\nin the temple. Then he saw things as they were now, with Naida\nsurrounded by all the tribes of the apes, and with Quetzalcoatl staring\nfrom beneath heavily lidded lashes at the whiteness of her.\n\nSuddenly Kirby stirred to free his shoulder of Ivana's supine weight\nagainst it, and he made himself look down his rifle. He let the breath\nhalf out of his lungs, and nursed the trigger.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut he did not fire.\n\nAll at once he started so violently that he almost hurtled from the\ntree. Suddenly, trembling, he lowered his rifle.\n\n\"Oh, thank God!\" he yelped in the silence of the night.\n\nThe idea which had transformed him was perhaps the conception of a\nlunatic. But it was still an idea, and offered a chance.\n\nAgain Kirby peered down his rifle. But he no longer aimed at Naida. As\nQuetzalcoatl lifted white fangs, Kirby aimed deliberately at him, and\nturned loose his fire.\n\nWith the first shot, the Serpent lurched back from the cage, snapped his\njaws, and closed evil, black eyes. From one lidded socket squirted dark\nblood. As a second and third shot crashed into the cavernous fanged\nmouth, and others ripped into the flat skull, Quetzalcoatl seemed dazed.\nHis head wavered back and forth and his hiss filled the night, but he\ndid nothing.\n\nBut all at once Kirby felt that he was _going_ to do something in a\nsecond, and a great calm came upon him. He quickly jammed home a fresh\nclip of shells.\n\n\"Nini! Ivana! Fire at the Serpent. Give him everything you've got! Do\nyou understand? Fire! He thinks that the ape-people have hurt him, and\nhe will be after them in a second. If we have any luck, he will do to\nthem what we never could have done, and maybe destroy himself at the\nsame time! Me, I'm going down there and get Naida now!\"\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nNo sooner did Kirby see comprehension in the girls' faces than he swung\naround and let go of his perch. As he crashed, caught the next limb\nbelow him, and let go to crash to another, he had all he could do to\nsuppress a yelp of joy. For all at once every voice in the ape\ncongregation was raised in howls and screams of devastated terror.\n\nHe did not care how he got down from the tree. Seconds and half seconds\nwere what counted. From the last limb above the ground he swung into\nspace, and a split second later staggered to his feet, clutched his\nrifle, and started for the clearing. His lungs seemed collapsed and both\nankles shattered. He did not care. Not when the ape screams were growing\nlouder with every step he took. Not when he heard Nini and Ivana pouring\ndown from their tree a continuation of the scorching fire he had\nstarted.\n\nPanting, his breath only half regained, but steeled to make the fight of\nhis life, he tore from the jungle into the clearing just in time to see\na twisting, pain-convulsed seventy-foot coil of white muscle lash up and\nstrike Naida's cage a blow which knocked it like a ball in the air.\nNaida screamed and hung to the bars.\n\nBut she was all right. It was not against her that Quetzalcoatl was\nventing his wrath: the blow had been blind accident. As Kirby stood at\nthe clearing's edge, he knew to a certainty that Quetzalcoatl's reaction\nto sudden pain had been all he had dared hope.\n\nIn front of him forty or fifty ape-bodies lay in a crushed heap. While\nyard after yard of the Serpent's bleached length streamed out of the\nhole, the hundreds of feet of coils already in the clearing suddenly\nwhipped about a whole squadron of ape-men, and with a few constrictions\nannihilated them as if they had been ants. Across the clearing, the\nleperous head reared up as high as the trees and swooped down, fangs\ngleaming. The howls of the ape-men trying to flee, the screams of those\nwho had been caught, rose until they became all one scream.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut Kirby had not left the safety of the tree merely to get a ringside\nview of carnage. He faced his next, his final task unhesitatingly.\nStraight out he leaped from the shadows of the jungle into the clearing,\nout into the presence of the beleagured, screaming ape-men. Well enough\nhe knew that those creatures, despite their frenzy, might sight him and\nfall upon him at any second; well enough he knew that a single flick of\nthe white coils all over the clearing could crush him instantly. But the\ntime to worry about those hazards would be when they beset him. With a\nyell as piercing as any in the whole bedlam, Kirby rushed forward.\n\nHigh up in the moonlit vault of the night, swaying between the two poles\nwhich supported it, hung the white cage which was Naida's prison. By the\ntime Kirby had sprinted fifty yards, he knew that his yells had reached\nNaida. For she staggered to her knees and looked straight at him. A\nsecond later, though, he realized that the almost inevitable recognition\nof him by ape-men had come to pass.\n\nEight or ten of the creatures, left unmolested for a second by the\nSerpent, halted in the mad run they were making for the sheltering\njungle, and while one pointed with hairy arm, the others let out\nshrieks. Kirby gritted his teeth in something like despair. Then he\nrealized that the worst danger--Quetzalcoatl's blurred coils--was not\nthreatening him so far. And he went on, straight toward the ape-men.\n\nHe did not look where, how, or at whom he struck. All he knew was that\nhis rifle blazed, and as he clubbed at soft flesh with the butt, blood\nspurted, and new screams filled the night. He felt and half saw big,\nstinking bodies going down, and clawed his way forward, around them,\nover them. Then he felt no more bodies, and knew that he was through. A\nlittle farther he ran over the trampled earth, and stopped and looked\nup.\n\nThe howls of the living, the shrieks of the dying deafened him. Renewed\nshots from the rifles in the tree, made the Serpent lash about in a\ndazzling white blur, smashing trees, apes, everything in its path. But\nKirby, finding himself still safe, scarcely heard or saw. His eyes,\nturned upward, saw one thing only.\n\n\"Naida!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe had snapped two of the withes of the cage and was leaning forward\nthrough the opening. Her face was livid with horror and exhaustion, but\nshe was able to look at him with eyes that glowed.\n\n\"You--you came!\" she gasped. \"You came to me!\"\n\nIn a flash Kirby jumped over to the poles and began to cast off one of\nthe lines which held the cage aloft.\n\n\"Get ready for a bump!\" he shouted, as he lowered away, arms straining.\n\nPaying out the one line left the cage suspended from the second, but let\nit sweep from its position between the poles, down toward one pole. As\nthe thing struck the tall support, Kirby bounded over to stand beneath\nit, only too sharply aware of the death waiting for him on every side,\nbut ignoring it. Naida still hung suspended a good twenty feet above\nhim, but there was no time to let go the other line. He braced himself\nand held up his arms.\n\n\"Jump!\" he yelled.\n\nThen he saw the white gown sweeping down toward him, felt the crash of a\nsoft body against his, and staggered back. Recovered in a tenth of a\nsecond, he drew a deep breath, and looked at Naida beside him, tall and\nbrave, unhurt.\n\n\"Are you able to run?\" he snapped, and then, the moment she nodded,\nmotioned toward the jungle.\n\nBehind them, in front, on all sides, rose screams so horrible that he\nwondered even then if he would ever forget. As he started to run, he\nrealized that when Naida had finally landed in his arms, the nearest\nsquirming loop of the Serpent had been no more than four yards away, and\nthat, right now, if their luck failed, a single unfortunate twist of the\nincredible hundreds of feet of white muscle could still end things for\nthem.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut luck was not going to fail. Somehow Kirby knew it as they sprinted\nside by side, and the sheltering jungle loomed closer every second. And\na moment later, something beside his own inner faith made him know it,\ntoo.\n\n\"Look, Naida! Look!\" he screeched all at once.\n\nAt the upper end of the clearing, where an unthinkable slaughter was\ngoing on, there leaped out from amongst a surging mass of apes, leaped\nout from almost directly beneath a downward smashing blur of white snake\nfolds, a figure which Kirby had not seen or thought about for many\nseconds.\n\nThe Duca's robe hung in tatters from his body. Blood had smeared his\nwhite hair. His eyes were those of a man gone mad from fear. And as he\nescaped the tons of muscle which so nearly had engulfed him, he began to\nrun even as Kirby felt himself running.\n\nStraight toward him and Naida, Kirby saw the man spurt, but whether the\nmad eyes recognized them or not, he could not tell, nor did he care. All\nat once his feeling that they would escape the clearing, became\nconviction.\n\nFor suddenly the same single twitch of Quetzalcoatl's vast folds which\nmight have finished them, if luck had not held, put an end to the Duca's\nretreat. At one moment the man's path was clear. The next--\n\nKirby, running for dear life, gasped, and heard Naida cry out beside\nhim.\n\nThe great loops flashed, twisted, and where had been an open way for\nthe Duca, loomed a wall of scaly white flesh. The living wall twitched,\nclosed in; and as the Duca dodged and leaped to no avail, a cry shrilled\nacross the night--a cry that cut like a knife.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKirby saw no more. But it was likely that most, if not all, of the\ncaciques had gone with the Duca.\n\nSomehow, anyhow, in but a few seconds more, Kirby dove into the spot\nfrom which he had left the jungle to enter the clearing. As Naida\npressed against him, winded but still strong, he found his best hopes\nfor immediate retreat realized, for Gori, Nini, and Ivana, down from\ntheir tree, ran toward them.\n\n\"She is all right,\" he said with a gesture which cut short the outbursts\nready to come. \"But we've got to keep going. Ivana, tell Gori that her\npeople are gone, wiped out, but that if she will cast her lot with us,\nwe will not forget what she has done. Come on!\"\n\nWith Gori leading them they ran, stumbling, recovering themselves,\nstumbling again. To breathe became an agony. But not until many minutes\nlater, when they plowed into the cover of a fern belt whose blackness\nnot even the moonlight had pierced, did Kirby call a halt.\n\nHere he swept a final glance behind him, listened long for sounds of\npursuit, and relaxed a little only when none came to disturb the night\nstillness. However, that relaxation, now that he permitted it at last,\nmeant something.\n\nThe complete silence gave him final conviction that what he had said\nabout the whole ape-people being destroyed was true. As for the\nSerpent--well, perhaps he was destroyed even as they were. Perhaps not.\nIn any case the grip which Quetzalcoatl held upon the imagination of the\nPeople of the Temple had been destroyed by this night's work, and that\nwas what counted most. The Serpent would be worshipped no longer.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKirby reached out in the darkness and found Naida's hand.\n\n\"Come along,\" he said to all of the party. \"I think the past is--the\npast. And with Gori to guide us out of the jungle, and our own brains to\nguide us through the jungle of self-government after that, I think the\nfuture ought to be bright enough.\"\n\nIvana and Nini both chuckled as they moved again, and Gori, hearing her\nname spoken in a kindly voice, twitched her ears appreciatively. Naida\ndrew very close to Kirby.\n\n\"What are you thinking about?\" she asked presently.\n\n\"The--temple,\" he answered.\n\n\"About the crown which probably is still lying on the altar there?\"\n\nKirby looked up in surprise.\n\n\"Why, I had forgotten about that!\"\n\n\"What was it, then?\"\n\n\"But what could I have been thinking about except how you looked when we\ncame together in that gloomy place, and walked forward, side by side?\n_Now_ have I told you enough?\"\n\nNaida laughed.\n\n\"There is so much to be done!\" Kirby exclaimed then. \"As soon as\npossible, we must climb to the Valley of the Geyser, go on into the\nouter world, and there seek carefully for men who are willing, and fit,\nto come here. And that is only one task. Others come crowding to me\nevery second. But first--\"\n\n\"What?\" Naida asked softly.\n\n\"The temple. Naida, we will reach the plateau sometime to-morrow. All of\nthe girls who kept watch there will be waiting for us, and it will be a\ntime of happiness. May we not, then, go to the temple? There will be no\npriests. But we will make our pledges without them. Tell me, may I hope\nthat it will be so--to-morrow?\"\n\nNaida did not answer at once. She did not even nod. But presently her\nshoulder, still fragrant with faint perfume, brushed his. She clasped\nhis hand then, and as they walked on in silence, Kirby knew.\n\n\n\n\nThe Reader's Corner\n\n[Illustration: The Readers' Corner\n\nA Meeting Place for Readers of\nAstounding Stories]\n\n\n\"Literature\"\n\nDear Editor:\n\nAfter comparison with various other magazines which specialize in the\npublication of Science Fiction, we--The Scientific Fiction Library\nAss'n, of 1457 First Ave., New York City--have found that your magazine,\nAmazing Stories, publishes stories to which the term \"literature\" may be\napplied in its real sense. A fine example of this is the story \"Murder\nMadness,\" by Murray Leinster. Others of the finer novels are: \"The\nBeetle Horde,\" by Victor Rousseau, and, up to the present installment,\n\"Earth, the Marauder,\" by Arthur J. Burks. \"Brigands of the Moon,\" by\nRay Cummings, was interesting and well-written, but it was not\nliterature (not a story which you will remember and read over again). Of\nthe shorter stories, the novelettes, the best are: \"Spawn of the Stars,\"\nby Charles W. Diffin, \"Monsters of Moyen,\" by Arthur J. Burks, and \"The\nAtom Smasher,\" by Victor Rousseau.\n\nSince the magazine started, there are only three stories that did not\nbelong in the magazine, and were not even interesting. These are: \"The\nCorpse on the Grating,\" by Hugh B. Cave; \"The Stolen Mind,\" by M.\nStaley, and the last (I wonder that the editors who used such good sense\nin picking the other finer stories, let it pass), \"Vampires of Venus,\"\nby Anthony Pelcher. May you keep up the high standard of fiction you are\npublishing at present.--Nathan Greenfeld, 873 Whitlock Ave., New York\nCity.\n\n\nYou See--It Didn't!\n\nDear Editor:\n\nFirstly, let me say that I am sending a year's subscription to\nAstounding Stories, which will tell you that they are good.\n\nOn the average, the stories are of good literary merit and plot.\nHowever, there is one thing that seems to be getting rather pushed\ninto the background and that is the second part of your title,\n\"Super-Science.\" If this is to be a Science Fiction magazine let us have\nit so. I am kicking against stories like \"Murder Madness\" and the like.\nThey are really excellent in every way but just need that tincture of\na little scientific background to make them super-excellent. \"Brigands\nof the Moon\" and \"The Moon Master\" seem to me more the type of story\n\"our mag\" should publish, from its name.\n\nNo doubt this criticism will leave you cold and this effusion find its\nway into the nearest waste paper basket, but I find that a number of\nyour readers in Australia think somewhat the same as I do.\n\nMore brickbats--I hope not! and more bouquets--I hope so! the next time\nI write.--N.W. Alcock, 5 Gaza Rd., Naremburn, N.S.W., Australia.\n\n\nNot in de Head!!\n\nDear Editor:\n\nI shall be glad to take advantage of your cordial invitation to come\nover to \"The Readers' Corner.\" In the first place, I find your magazine\nthe best of its kind on the market, and you are to be congratulated on\nhaving such excellent authors as Ray Cummings, Murray Leinster and\nCaptain S. P. Meek. Nevertheless, there are so many things to be\ncriticized that I hardly know where to begin.\n\nLet's start of with stories of future warfare. Although this class is\npotentially one of the most interesting, it is at the same time one of\nthe most abused. Ray Cummings can write classics in this field, but the\nefforts of most the others are atrocities. I'll wager that their\nfavorite childhood sport was mowing down whole regiments of lead\nsoldiers with oxy-acetylene torches. It shows in their writings. Why\ncan't they think of something original? Why can't they make their\nstories logical? The merits of a story are not dependent on the number\nof people wiped out by one blast of a death ray! But they all stick to\nthe same old plot. A merciless but well-meaning scientist, or hordes\nfrom a foreign planet, wipe out thousands of American citizens at one\nblow. Hundreds of airplanes are disintegrated before they discover that\nthe enemy is invulnerable. An ultimatum in domineering tones gives the\nterror-stricken populace forty-eight hours in which to surrender. But,\nall unknown to the dastardly villains, an obscure young scientist labors\nto save his country and the girl he loves. Fifteen minutes before the\ntime set in the ultimatum he perfects a new weapon that soon sends the\ninvaders to their well merited fate.\n\nSurely you realize how ridiculous the whole affair is. It is only\nslightly less nauseating than the plot used in the stories of advanced\ncivilizations where the hero is conducted on a sight-seeing tour by the\nindividual in whose path he popped upon entering this new world. I can't\nbelieve that more than a handful of my fellow beings are of such low\nintelligence that they can find enjoyment in such trash. You will notice\nthat although every reader has a different list of favorite authors, Ray\nCummings has his name in practically every list. He is easily your\nfavorite author. Ray Cummings does not wipe out whole cities at one\ntime. His heroes do not save the world by inventing a new weapon at a\nmoment's notice. His wars are not of forty-eight hours' duration. His\nconquerors do not attempt to win the war by one great attack on New York\nCity. Do try to have your authors write logical stories.\n\nI would now like to criticize the love element in your stories. I do not\nclaim that there should be none whatever from cover to cover of your\nmagazine, but I do claim that there should be none unless it really\nhelps the plot. Most of your authors seem to think that a girl is\nnecessary in every plot and so they bring her in, disregarding the fact\nthat they do not know how to handle such material. The way it stands\nnow, the heroine is introduced in a lame, routine fashion; is rescued\nonce or twice; and accepts the hero as a husband in an altogether lame\nfashion.\n\nThere are many other points but they can wait. Logical war stories, no\nUtopias or sight-seeing tours, sensible love element, plus your present\npolicy will make a corking magazine.--Philip Waite, 3400 Wayne Ave., New\nYork, N.Y.\n\n\nNo Present Plans\n\nDear Editor:\n\nThanks for the new color cover. It certainly is a big improvement. The\npicture on the front of \"our\" magazine was just as astounding as the\nstory by R. F. Starzl from which it was drawn. Let's have more stories\nfrom the pen of Mr. Starzl.\n\nIn my opinion \"Beyond the Heaviside Layer\" is the best story I have read\nin Astounding Stories to date. I am very pleased that you intend to\nprint a sequel to it.\n\nNow I would like to ask you a question. Do you intend to print an Annual\nor Quarterly, or do think you will ever enlarge the size of this\nmagazine? I don't care so much whether you enlarge the magazine or not,\nbut I certainly would like to read an Annual or Quarterly.\n\nEven though this letter meets the fate of thousands of other such\nletters and sees the inside of your wastebasket, I will at least have\nhad the pleasure of writing to you and wishing \"our\" magazine success to\nthe nth degree.--Forrest J. Ackerman, 236-\u00bd N. New Hampshire, Los\nAngeles, Calif.\n\n\n\"Excellent\" to \"So-So\"\n\nDear Editor:\n\nI notice a large number of subscribers are giving their opinions of\nAstounding Stories. I hate to be with the crowd, but I have to side with\nthe majority in this case and say it's just about right.\n\nMy favorite writers are R. F. Starzl (that \"Planet of Dread\" was a\npeach). Chas. W. Diffin, A. Merritt, Ralph Milne Farley, Murray Leinster\nand Ray Cummings.\n\nNow as to the August issue, here is how I rate them:\n\n\"Planet of Dread\"--more than 20c. worth at the first crack. A real\nstory.\n\n\"Lord of Space\"--excellent. I meant to include Victor Rousseau in my\nlist of favorites above.\n\n\"The Second Satellite\"--so-so.\n\n\"Silver Dome\"--so.\n\n\"Earth the Marauder\"--too deep for me. And that Beryl stuff is sheer\nbunk.\n\n\"Murder Madness\"--a real story. Get more like this.\n\n\"The Flying City\"--too much explanation and description and not enough\naction.\n\nPerhaps it looks like I'm sort of critical after all, but I didn't mean\nit just that way. What I'm driving at is that Astounding Stories is by\nfar superior to its competitors, and I'm telling you so because it might\nmake you feel better to know it. If you want to print this testimonial,\ngo to it. To tell the truth, I'll be looking for it.--Leslie P. Mann,\n1227 Ogden Ave., Chicago, Illinois.\n\n\n\"Too Many Serials\"\n\nDear Editor:\n\nI have just finished the August issue, and I would like to tell you my\nopinion of it and the magazine as a whole.\n\nThe stories in order of merit were:\n\n1--\"The Second Satellite\"; 2--\"The Flying City\"; 3--\"Silver Dome\";\n4--\"The Lord of Space\"; 5--\"The Planet of Dread.\"\n\nI won't pass judgment upon the serials, as I have not read all the\nparts.\n\nIn \"The Flying City\" there are a number of points I am hazy about. How\ncould Cor speak English? However, this could be cleared up by saying\nthat Cor sent out men to get the language, etc.\n\nAs a whole, Astounding Stories is a good magazine. There are too many\nserials, however, but since other readers like them I won't complain.\n\nYou have a fine array of Science Fiction authors. With such writers as\nVincent, Meek, Hamilton, Starzl and Ernst, your magazine can't be\nanything but a success.\n\nThe September layouts look good to me. I hope it is.--E. Anderson, 1765\nSouthern Blvd., New York, N.Y.\n\n\nThanks, Mr. Glasser\n\nDear Editor:\n\nSomewhat belatedly I am writing to commend you most heartily on the\nAugust issue of Astounding Stories, which I consider by far the finest\nnumber since the inception of the magazine last January. The authors\nwhose work appeared in this issue are among the greatest modern writers\nof fantasy and scientific fiction. Leinster, Burks, Hamilton,\nRousseau--what a brilliant galaxy! And Starzl, Vincent, Rich; all\nwriters of note. If ever a magazine merited the designation \"all-star\nnumber,\" your August issue filled the bill.\n\nHowever, I am confident that even this superb achievement will be\nsurpassed by some future edition of Astounding Stories, for each\nsucceeding number to date has improved on the one before. And with a new\nCummings novel in the offing, it seems the August issue, despite its\nexcellence, will speedily be eclipsed.--Allen Glasser, 1510 University\nAve., New York, N.Y.\n\n\nAre Our Covers Too \"Gaudy\"?\n\nDear Editor:\n\nThis is the first time that I have ventured to air my views to any\nmagazine, but as yours interests me greatly I hereby shed my reticence.\n\nI believe, of all magazine of your type, you have come nearest\nperfection. But there are just a few things that bother me, and, no\ndoubt, others like me. In the first place, must you make your covers as\nlurid and as contradictory to good design as they are? Really, I blush\nwhen my newsdealer hands me the gaudy thing. People interested in\nscience do not usually succumb to circus poster advertising.\n\nThen there are the stories. I realize that you must cater to all tastes,\nbut some of them are very childish, slightly camouflaged fairy tales.\nScience Fiction can be written very convincingly, as is testified by the\nstories of H. G. Wells, Ray Cummings, Jules Verne, and others. These\nwriters attain their effects by the proper use of the English language,\nwithout silly and obviously tacked-on romance, the use of known\nscientific facts elaborated sensibly and by not trying to make a novel\nout of a short story.\n\nThe stimulation of the imagination from Science Fiction is most\nenjoyable and I shall continue to read your magazine even though my\nfault finding is not considered, for, as I said before, you certainly\nhave come nearer my ideal than any of the others.--Hector D. Spear, 867\nW. 181st St., The Tri-Sigma Fraternity, New York City.\n\n\nNossir--Our Astronomy Is O. K.\n\nDear Editor:\n\nI am taking advantage of your invitation to write to you. Since\nAstounding Stories is available you have given me a lot of pleasure, and\nI hope you may get a little pleasure out of reading this.\n\nFirst, I want to say that you're hitting the ball as far as I'm\nconcerned. I could hardly suggest an improvement.\n\nIn the August issue I liked \"Planet of Dread,\" by R. F. Starzl, best.\nWhen that thing in the \"pipe\" grabbed me, I mean Gunga, wow! And it gave\nme a lot of satisfaction to see the Master in \"Murder Madness,\" by\nMurray Leinster, get it in the neck. \"Lord of Space\" was good, too. In\nfact all the stories were good. I have only read two or three I really\ndid not like since you started.\n\nSay, I never heard of a planet named Inra. Don't you think your author\nought to brush up on his astronomy? I also noticed some other authors\nare a little weak on astronomy; not that I'm complaining. The stories\nare O. K. with me.--Harry Johnson, 237 E. 128th St., New York City.\n\n\nMr. Yetter Checks Up on Us\n\nDear Editor:\n\nAs I am a constant reader of Astounding Stories I wish to say that\nthough S. P. Meek is one of my favorite authors his story, \"Cold Light,\"\nwas a little wrong when he called the \"Silver Range\" by the name of\n\"Stillwater Range.\" I also think it would have been better if he had had\na car take Dr. Bird and Carnes out to the hills, became even in Fallon a\nburro is a strange sight.\n\nBut Meek, Cummings, Burks and all the rest of our famous authors'\nstories should be in the magazine often. If Verrill, Wells, Nathenson\nand Hamilton would also write, the magazine would be perfect.\n\nI like all the stories, though some seem to be copies, and others lack\nscience.\n\nHere is for a long life for Astounding Stories!--Frank Yetter, 369\nRailroad Ave., Fallon, Nevada.\n\n\n\"Charm All Its Own\"\n\nDear Editor:\n\nLet me congratulate you. I have just read \"The Planet of Dread,\" by R.\nF. Starzl, in your August issue of Astounding Stories.\n\nReal science, you know, is pretty rigidly limited, but super-science of\nthe kind you seem to run has a freshness and charm all its own.\n\nI came upon your magazine quite by accident, and from now on no doubt\nwill look for it as I stand before the racks of magazines, trying to\ndecide upon something to read--Anton J. Sartori, 1330 W. 6th St., Los\nAngeles, Calif.\n\n\nInra Could Exist\n\nDear Editor:\n\nYou will have to excuse this old telegraph office typewriter. It is all\nI have to express my appreciation to you for the tremendously\ninteresting magazine you put out. I have only read the last three\nissues, but those are enough to convince me that Astounding Stories\nfills a long-felt want. I read all the others too, but from now on I'm\ngoing to look over their offerings at the stand before I buy. They have\nto go some to come up to the standard set by you, especially in the\nAugust copy.\n\nThat story, \"The Planet of Dread,\" was the most weird, exciting,\nthrilling, satisfying--in short, the most \"astounding\" story I have ever\nread. Nothing has seemed so real since I first read Wells' stories. I\nliked the characters. Poor Gunga. I could just see him, trying to\nsacrifice the man he obviously worshipped to stop that horrible noise.\nThe picture of Gunga on the cover was just exactly what I would expect\nthe Martian to look like. You have a good artist. I liked Mark\nForepaugh, too. He didn't lose his nerve for one minute--not Mark. Who\nsays civilization is going down, when the future holds men like that?\n\nNext to \"The Planet of Dread\" I liked \"The Lord of Space.\" That was a\nvivid and well-drawn story, too. Those two, I think, were the\noutstanding stories for August. But I must not forget \"Murder Madness,\"\nthe serial; it was thrilling and convincing. That's the only kick I\nhave: so many stories sound thin. I don't believe them when I read them.\nI also want to mention \"The Forgotten Planet\" and \"From An Amber Block.\"\nGood, exciting, and you can believe them without too much strain.\n\nOh, by the way, the author of \"The Planet of Dread\" made a mistake when\nhe chose a mythical planet for his terrific adventures. Why not Venus or\nMercury? If they have water the conditions on them would be similar to\nwhat he described for Inra. There ain't no such planet. But why expect\nperfection! I'm satisfied.\n\nI wish you success. That's a late wish. You're a success already.--Tom\nP. Fitzgerald, Newcastle, Nebraska.\n\n\nThus Ended the Quest\n\nDear Editor:\n\nThis is my first letter to your magazine, and right away I'm asking for\na pair of sequels. One of these is to \"The Moon Master,\" by Charles W.\nDiffin. These sad endings depress me greatly, but if I looked at the\nending first to see whether or not it was sad it would ruin the story;\nand besides sad endings usually have good stories in front of them. The\nother sequel I want is to \"From The Ocean's Depths,\" by Sewell P.\nWright, and its sequel \"Into The Ocean's Depths.\"\n\nIn looking over my back copies of the magazine I find that I have not\ndisliked a single story. Thus endeth my quest for a brickbat.\n\nAre you going to put out a quarterly? Both the other Science Fiction\nmagazines that I get do so, and I observe that it gives opportunity for\na story of full novel length all in one piece. Not that I object to\nserials, but I like once in a while to sit down to a long story without\nhaving to dig out three or four magazines. However, please continue the\nlong serials, for what is life without the element of suspense?--Hugh M.\nGilmore, 920 N. Vista St., Hollywood, Cal.\n\n\n\"The Readers' Corner\"\n\nAll Readers are extended a sincere and cordial invitation to \"come over\nin 'The Readers' Corner'\" and join in our monthly discussion of stories,\nauthors, scientific principles and possibilities--everything that's of\ncommon interest in connection with our Astounding Stories.\n\nAlthough from time to time the Editor may make a comment or so, this is\na department primarily for _Readers_, and we want you to make full use\nof it.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
