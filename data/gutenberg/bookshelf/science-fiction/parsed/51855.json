But the men of Fruyling's\nWorld lived on borrowed time, knowing that slavery was outlawed\nthroughout the Confederation--and that only the slave labor of the\nreptilian natives could produce the precious metals the Confederation\nneeded!\n\nAs the first hints of the truth about Fruyling's World emerge, the\ntension becomes unbearable--to be resolved only in the shattering\nclimax of this fast-paced, thought-provoking story of one of today's\nmost original young writers.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"On Saturday, July 30, Dr. Johnson and I took a sculler at the\nTemple-stairs, and set out for Greenwich. I asked him if he really\nthought a knowledge of the Greek and Latin languages an essential\nrequisite to a good education. JOHNSON. 'Most certainly, Sir; for\nthose who know them have a very great advantage over those who do not.\nNay, Sir, it is wonderful what a difference learning makes upon people\neven in the common intercourse of life, which does not appear to be\nmuch connected with it.' 'And yet, (said I) people go through the\nworld very well, and carry on the business of life to good advantage,\nwithout learning.' JOHNSON. 'Why, Sir, that may be true in cases where\nlearning cannot possibly be of any use; for instance, this boy rows\nus as well without learning, as if he could sing the song of Orpheus\nto the Argonauts, who were the first sailors.' He then called to the\nboy, 'What would you give my lad, to know about the Argonauts?' 'Sir,\n(said the boy) I would give what I have.' Johnson was much pleased with\nhis answer, and we gave him a double fare. Dr. Johnson then turning to\nme, 'Sir, (said he) a desire of knowledge is the natural feeling of\nmankind; and every human being, whose mind is not debauched, will be\nwilling to give all that he has, to get knowledge.'\"\n\n--James Boswell,\n\n_The Life of Samuel Johnson, L.

Like so many catchwords, this one is recognizable as nonsense\nas soon as it is closely examined. Given that the upkeep of the slaves\nis less than the price of full automation (and _its_ upkeep), I do\nnot think we shall prove ourselves morally so very superior to our\ngrandfathers.\"\n\n--H. D. Abel,\n\n_Essays in History and Causation_\n\n\n\n\nPART ONE\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\"I would not repeat myself if it were not for the urgency of this\nmatter.\" Dr. Haenlingen's voice hardly echoed in the square small room.\nShe stood staring out at the forests below, the coiling gray-green\ntrees, the plants and rough growth. A small woman whose carriage was\nalways, publicly, stiff and erect, whose iron-gray eyes seemed as\nsolid as ice, she might years before have trained her voice to sound\nimprobably flat and formal. Now the formality was dissolving in anger.\n\"As you know, the mass of citizens throughout the Confederation are a\npotential source of explosive difficulty, and our only safety against\nsuch an explosion lies in complete and continuing silence.\" Abruptly,\nshe turned away from the window. \"Have you got that, Norma?\"\n\nNorma Fredericks nodded, her trace poised over the waiting pad. \"Yes,\nDr. Haenlingen. Of course.\"\n\nDr. Haenlingen's laugh was a dry rustle. \"Good Lord, girl,\" she said.\n\"Are you afraid of me, too?\"\n\nNorma shook her head instantly, then stopped and almost smiled. \"I\nsuppose I am, Doctor,\" she said. \"I don't quite know why--\"\n\n\"Authority figure, parent-surrogate, phi factor--there's no mystery\nabout the why, Norma. If you're content with jargon, and we know\nall the jargon, don't we?\" Now instead of a laugh it was a smile,\nsurprisingly warm but very brief. \"We ought to, after all; we ladle it\nout often enough.\"\n\nNorma said: \"There's certainly no real reason for fear. I don't want\nyou to think--\"\n\n\"I don't think,\" Dr. Haenlingen said. \"I never think. I reason when I\nmust, react when I can.\" She paused. \"Sometimes, Norma, it strikes me\nthat the Psychological Division hasn't really kept track of its own\noccupational syndromes.\"\n\n\"Yes?\" Norma waited, a study in polite attention. The trace fell slowly\nin her hand to the pad on her knees and rested there.\n\n\"I ask you if you're afraid of me and I get the beginnings of a\nself-analysis,\" Dr. Haenlingen said. She walked three steps to the\ndesk and sat down behind it, her hands clasped on the surface, her\neyes staring at the younger woman. \"If I'd let you go on I suppose you\ncould have given me a yard and a half of assorted psychiatric jargon,\ncomplete with suggestions for a change in your pattern.\"\n\n\"I only--\"\n\n\"You only reacted the way a good Psychological Division worker is\nsupposed to react, I imagine.\" The eyes closed for a second, opened\nagain. \"You know, Norma, I could have dictated this to a tape and had\nit sent out automatically. Did you stop to think why I wanted to talk\nit out to you?\"\n\n\"It's a message to the Confederation,\" Norma said slowly. \"I suppose\nit's important, and you wanted--\"\n\n\"Importance demands accuracy,\" Dr. Haenlingen broke in. \"Do you think\nyou can be more accurate than a tape record?\"\n\nA second of silence went by. \"I don't know, then,\" Norma said at last.\n\n\"I wanted reaction,\" Dr. Haenlingen said. \"I wanted somebody's\nreaction. But I can't get yours. As far as I can see you're the white\nhope of the Psychological Division--but even you are afraid of me, even\nyou are masking any reaction you might have for fear the terrifying Dr.\nAnna Haenlingen won't like it.\" She paused. \"Good Lord, girl, I've got\nto know if I'm getting through!\"\n\nNorma took a deep breath. \"I'm sorry,\" she said at last. \"I'll try to\ngive you what you want--\"\n\n\"There you go again.\" Dr. Haenlingen shoved back her chair and stood\nup, marched to the window and stared out at the forest again. Below,\nthe vegetation glowed in the daylight. She shook her head slowly. \"How\ncan you give me what I want when I don't know what I want? I need to\nknow what _you_ think, how _you_ react. I'm not going to bite your head\noff if you do something wrong: there's nothing wrong that you _can_ do.\nExcept not react at all.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Norma said again.\n\nDr. Haenlingen's shoulders moved, up and down. It might have been a\nsigh. \"Of course you are,\" she said in a gentler voice. \"I'm sorry,\ntoo. It's just that matters aren't getting any better--and one false\nmove could crack us wide open.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Norma said. \"You'd think people would understand--\"\n\n\"People,\" Dr. Haenlingen said, \"understand very little. That's what\nwe're here for, Norma: to make them understand a little more. To make\nthem understand, in fact, what we want them to understand.\"\n\n\"The truth,\" Norma said.\n\n\"Of course,\" Dr. Haenlingen said, almost absently. \"The truth.\"\n\nThis time there was a longer pause.\n\n\"Shall we get on with it, then?\" Dr. Haenlingen said.\n\n\"I'm ready,\" Norma said. \"'Complete and continuing silence.'\"\n\nDr. Haenlingen paused. \"What?... Oh. It should be perfectly obvious\nthat the average Confederation citizen, regardless of his training or\ninformation, would not understand the project under development here\nno matter how carefully it was explained to him. The very concepts of\nfreedom, justice, equality under the law, which form the cornerstone\nof Confederation law and, more importantly, Confederation societal\npatterns, will prevent him from judging with any real degree of\nobjectivity our actions on Fruyling's World, or our motives.\"\n\n\"Actions,\" Norma muttered. \"Motives.\" The trace flew busily over the\npad, leaving its shorthand trail.\n\n\"It was agreed in the original formation of our project here that\nsilence and secrecy were essential to the project's continuance. Now,\nin the third generation of that project, the wall of silence has been\nbreached and I have received repeated reports of rumors regarding our\nrelationship with the natives. The very fact that such rumors exist\nis indication enough that an explosive situation is developing. It is\npossible for the Confederation to be forced to the wall on this issue,\nand this issue alone: I cannot emphasize too strongly the fact that\nsuch a possibility exists. Therefore--\"\n\n\"Doctor,\" Norma said.\n\nThe dictation stopped. Dr. Haenlingen turned slowly. \"Yes?\"\n\n\"You wanted reactions, didn't you?\" Norma said.\n\n\"Well?\" The word was not unfriendly.\n\nNorma hesitated for a second. Then she burst out: \"But they're so\nfar away! I mean--there isn't any reason why they should really\ncare. They're busy with their own lives, and I don't really see why\nwhatever's done here should occupy them--\"\n\n\"Because you're not seeing them,\" Dr. Haenlingen said. \"Because\nyou're thinking of the Confederation, not the people who compose the\nConfederation, all of the people on Mars, and Venus, the moons and\nEarth. The Confederation itself--the government--really doesn't care.\nWhy should it? But the people do--or would.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Norma said, and then: \"Oh. Of course.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Dr. Haenlingen said. \"They hear about freedom, and all\nthe rest, as soon as they're old enough to hear about anything. It's\npart of every subject they study in school, it's part of the world they\nlive in, it's like the air they breathe. They can't question it: they\ncan't even think about it.\"\n\n\"And, of course, if they hear about Fruyling's World--\"\n\n\"There won't be any way to disguise the fact,\" Dr. Haenlingen said. \"In\nthe long run, there never is. And the fact will shock them into action.\nAs long as they continue to live in that air of freedom and justice and\nequality under the law, they'll want to stop what we're doing here.\nThey'll have to.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Nonna said. \"Of course.\"\n\nDr. Haenlingen, still looking out at the world below, smiled faintly.\n\"Slavery,\" she said, \"is such an _ugly_ word.\"\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nThe Commons Room of the Third Building of City One was a large affair,\nwhose three bare metal walls enclosed more space than any other\nsingle living-quarters room in the Building; but the presence of the\nfourth wall made it seem tiny. That wall was nearly all window, a\nnon-shatterable clear plastic immensely superior to that laboratory\nmaterial, glass. It displayed a single unbroken sweep of forty feet,\nand it looked down on the forests of Fruyling's World from a height of\nsixteen stories. Men new to the Third Building usually sat with their\nbacks to that enormous window, and even the eldest inhabitants usually\nplaced their chairs somehow out of line with it, and looked instead at\nthe walls, at their companions, or at their own hands.\n\nFruyling's World was disturbing, and not only because of the choking\nprofusion of forest that always seemed to threaten the isolated\nclusters of human residence. A man could get used to forests. But at\nany moment, looking down or out across the gray-green vegetation, that\nman might catch sight of a native--an Elder, perhaps heading slowly out\ntoward the Birth Huts hidden in the lashing trees, or a group of Small\nOnes being herded into the Third Building itself for their training. It\nwas hard, perhaps impossible, to get used to that: when you had to see\nthe natives you steeled yourself for the job. When you didn't have to\nsee them you counted yourself lucky and called yourself relaxed.\n\nIt wasn't that the natives were hideous, either. Their very name had\nbeen given to them by men in a kind of affectionate mockery, since\nthey weren't advanced enough even to have such a group-name of their\nown as \"the people.\" They were called Alberts, after a half-forgotten\ncharacter in a mistily-remembered comic strip dating back before space\ntravel, before the true beginnings of Confederation history. If you\nignored the single, Cyclopean eye, the rather musty smell and a few\nother even more minor details, they looked rather like two-legged\nalligators four feet tall, green as jewels, with hopeful grins on their\nfaces and an awkward, waddling walk like a penguin's. Seen without\npreconceptions they might have been called cute.\n\nBut no man on Fruyling's World could see the Alberts without\npreconceptions. They were not Alberts: they were slaves, as the men\nwere masters. And slavery, named and accepted, has traditionally been\nharder on the master than the slave.\n\nJohn Dodd, twenty-seven years old, master, part of the third\ngeneration, arranged his chair carefully so that it faced the door of\nthe Commons Room, letting the light from the great window illumine the\nback of his head. He clasped his hands in his lap in a single, nervous\ngesture, never noticing that the light gave him a faint saintlike halo\nabout his feathery hair. His companion took another chair, set it at\nright angles to Dodd's and gave it long and thoughtful consideration,\nas if the act of sitting down were something new and untried.\n\n\"It's good to be off-duty,\" Dodd said violently. \"Good. Not to have to\nsee them--not to have to think about them until tomorrow.\"\n\nThe standing man, shorter than Dodd and built heavily, actually turned\nand looked out at the window. \"And then tomorrow what do you do?\"\nhe asked. \"Give up your job? You're just letting the thing get you,\nJohnny.\"\n\n\"I'd give up my job in twenty seconds if I thought it would do any\ngood,\" Dodd said. He shook his head. \"I give up a job here in the\nBuildings, and then what do I do? Go out and starve in the jungle?\nNobody's done it, nobody's ever done it.\"\n\n\"Well?\" the squat man said. \"Is that an excuse?\"\n\nDodd sighed. \"Those who work get fed,\" he said. \"And housed. And\nclothed. And--God help us--entertained, by 3D tapes older than our\nfathers are. If a man didn't work he'd get--cast out. Cut off.\"\n\n\"There's more than 3D tapes,\" the squat man said, and grinned.\n\n\"Sure.\" Dodd's voice was tired. \"But think about it for a minute,\nAlbin. Do you know what we've got here?\"\n\n\"We've got a nice, smooth setup,\" Albin said. \"No worries, no fights,\na job to do and a place to do it in, time to relax, time to have fun.\nIt's okay.\"\n\nThere was a little silence. Dodd's voice seemed more distant. \"Marxian\neconomics,\" he said. \"Perfect Marxian economics, on a world that would\nmake old Karl spin in his grave like an electron.\"\n\n\"I guess so,\" Albin said. \"History's not my field. But--given the\nsetup, what else could there be? What other choice have you got?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\" Again a silence. Dodd's hands unclasped: he made\na gesture as if he were sweeping something away from his face.\n\"There ought to be something else. Even on Earth, even before the\nConfederation, there were conscientious objectors.\"\n\n\"History again,\" Albin said. He walked a few steps toward the window.\n\"Anyhow, that was for war.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Dodd said. His hands went back into his lap, and his\neyes closed. He spoke, now, like a man in a dream. \"There used to be\nall kinds of jobs. I guess there still are, in the Confederation. On\nEarth. Back home where none of us have ever been.\" He repeated the\nwords like an echo: \"Back home.\" In the silence nothing interrupted\nhim: behind his head light poured in from the giant window. \"A man\ncould choose his own job,\" he went on, in the same tone. \"He could be\na factory-worker or a professor or a truck-driver or a musician or--a\nlot of jobs. A man didn't have to work at one, whether he wanted to or\nnot.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Albin said. \"Okay. So suppose you had your choice. Suppose\nevery job in every damn history you've ever heard of was open to you.\nJust what would you pick? Make a choice. Go ahead, make--\"\n\n\"It isn't funny, Albin,\" Dodd said woodenly. \"It isn't a game.\"\n\n\"Okay, it isn't,\" Albin said. \"So make it a game. Just for a minute.\nThink over all the jobs you can and make a choice. You don't like\nbeing here, do you? You don't like working with the Alberts. So where\nwould you like to be? What would you like to do?\" He came back to the\nchair, his eyes on Dodd, and sat suddenly down, his elbows on his knees\nand his chin cupped in his hands, facing Dodd like a gnome out of\npre-history. \"Go on,\" he said. \"Make a choice.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Dodd said without opening his eyes. His voice became more\ndistant, dreamlike. \"Okay,\" he said again. \"I--there isn't one job,\nbut maybe a kind of job. Something to do with growing things.\" There\nwas a pause. \"I'd like to work somewhere growing things. I'd like to\nwork with plants. They're all right, plants. They don't make you feel\nanything.\" The voice stopped.\n\n\"Plants?\" Albin hooted gigantically. \"Good God, think about it! You're\nstuck on a planet that's over seventy per cent plant life--trees and\nweeds and jungles all over the land and even mats of green stuff\ncovering the oceans and riding on the rivers--a planet that's just\nabout nothing but plants, a king-sized hothouse for every kind of leaf\nand blade and flower and fruit you could ever dream up--\"\n\n\"It's not the same,\" Dodd said.\n\n\"You,\" Albin said, \"are out of your head. So if you're crazy for\nplants, so grow them in your spare time. If you've got a window in your\nroom you can put up a window-box. If not, something else. Me, I think\nit's damn silly: with the plants all around here, what's the sense of\ngrowing more? But if you like it, God knows Fruyling's World is ready\nto provide it for you.\"\n\n\"As a hobby,\" Dodd said flatly.\n\n\"Well, then, a hobby,\" Albin said. \"If you're interested in it.\"\n\n\"Interested.\" The word was like an echo. A silence fell. Albin's eyes\nstudied Dodd, the thin face and the play of light on the hair. After a\nwhile he shrugged.\n\n\"So it isn't plants,\" he said. \"It isn't any more than the Alberts\nand working with them. You want to do anything to get away from\nthem--anything that won't remind you you have to go back.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Dodd said. \"Sure I do. So do all of us.\"\n\n\"Not me,\" Albin said instantly. \"Not me, brother. I get my food and\nmy clothing and my shelter, just like good old Marx, I guess, says I\nshould. I'm a trainer for the Alberts, supportive work in the refining\nprocess, and some day I'll be a master trainer and get a little more\npay, a little more status, you know?\" He grinned and sat straight.\n\"What the hell,\" he said \"It's a job. It pays my way. And there's\nenough leisure time for fun--and when I say fun I don't mean 3D tapes,\nDodd. I really don't.\"\n\n\"But you--\"\n\n\"Look,\" Albin said. \"That's what's wrong with you, kid. You talk as if\nwe all had nothing to do but work and watch tapes. What you need is a\nlittle education--a little real education--and I'm the one to give it\nto you.\"\n\nDodd opened his eyes. They looked very large and flat, like the eyes\nof a jungle animal. \"I don't need education,\" he said. \"And I don't\nneed hobbies. I need to get off this planet, that's all. I need to stop\nworking with the Alberts. I need to stop being a master and start being\na man again.\"\n\nAlbin sighed. \"Slavery,\" he said. \"You think of slavery and it all\nrises up in front of you--Greece, India, China, Rome, England, the\nUnited States--all the past before the Confederation, all the different\nslaves.\" He grinned again. \"You think it's terrible, don't you?\"\n\n\"It is terrible,\" Dodd said. \"It's--they're people, just like us. They\nhave a right to their own lives.\"\n\n\"Sure they do,\" Albin said. \"They have the right to--oh, to starve\nand die in that forest out there, for instance. And work out a lot\nof primitive rituals, and go through all the Stone Age motions for\nthousands of years until they develop civilization like you and me.\nInstead of being kept nice and warm and comfortable and taken care of,\nand taught things, by the evil old bastards like--well, like you and me\nagain. Right?\"\n\n\"They have rights,\" Dodd said stubbornly. \"They have rights of their\nown.\"\n\n\"Sure they do,\" Albin agreed with great cheerfulness. \"How'd you like\nit if they got some of them? Dodd, maybe you'd like to see them starve?\nBecause it's going to be a long, long time before they develop anything\nlike a solid civilization, kiddo. And in the meantime a lot of them are\ngoing to die of things we can prevent. Right? And how'd you like that,\nDodd? How would you like that?\"\n\nDodd hesitated. \"We ought to help them,\" he muttered.\n\n\"Well,\" Albin said cheerfully, \"that's what we are doing. Keeping them\nalive, for instance. And teaching them.\"\n\n\"Teaching,\" Dodd said. Again his voice had the faintly mocking sound of\nan echo. \"And what are we teaching them? Push this button for us. Watch\nthis process for us. If anything changes push this button. Dig here.\nCarry there.\" He paused. \"Wonderful--for us. But what good does it do\nthem?\"\n\n\"We've got to live, too,\" Albin said.\n\nDodd stared. \"At their expense?\"\n\n\"It's a living,\" Albin said casually, shrugging. Then: \"But I'm\nserious. One good dose of real enjoyment will cure you, friend. One\ngood dose of fun--by which, kiddo, I mean plain ordinary old sex, such\nas can be had any free evening around here--and you'll stop being\ndepressed and worried. Uncle Albin Cendar's Priceless Old Recipe,\nkiddo, and don't argue with me: it works.\"\n\nDodd said nothing at all. After a few seconds his eyes slowly closed\nand he sat like a statue in the room.\n\nAlbin, watching him, whistled inaudibly under his breath. A minute went\nby silently. The light in the room began to diminish.\n\n\"Sun's going down,\" Albin offered.\n\nThere was no response. Albin got up again and went to the window.\n\n\"Maybe you're right,\" he said with his back to Dodd's still figure.\n\"There ought to be some way of getting people off-planet, people who\njust don't want to stay here.\"\n\n\"Do you know why there isn't?\" Dodd's voice was a shock, stronger than\nbefore.\n\n\"Sure I know,\" Albin said. \"There's--\"\n\n\"Slavery,\" Dodd said. \"Oh, sure, maybe somebody knows about it, but\nit's got to be kept quiet. And if anybody got back--well, look.\"\n\n\"Don't bother me with it.\" Albin's voice was suddenly less sure.\n\n\"Look,\" Dodd said. \"The Confederation needs the metal. It exists pure\nhere, and in quantity. But if they knew, really knew, how we mined and\nsmelted and purified it and got it ready for shipment....\"\n\n\"So suppose somebody goes back,\" Albin said. \"Suppose somebody talks.\nWhat difference does it make? It's just rumor, nothing official. No,\nthe reason nobody goes back is cargo space, pure and simple. We need\nevery inch of cargo space for the shipments.\"\n\n\"If somebody goes back,\" Dodd said, \"the people will know. Not the\ngovernment, not the businesses, the people. And the people don't like\nslavery, Albin. No matter how necessary a government finds it. No\nmatter what kind of a jerry-built defense you can put up for it.\"\n\n\"Don't be silly,\" Albin said. There was less conviction in his voice;\nhe looked out at the sunset as if he were trying to reassure himself.\n\n\"Nobody's allowed to leave,\" Dodd said, more quietly. \"We're--they're\ntaking every precaution they can. But some day--maybe some day,\nAlbin--the people are going to find out in spite of every precaution.\"\nHe sat straighter. \"And then it'll all be over. Then they'll be wiped\nout, Albin. Wiped out.\"\n\n\"They need us,\" Albin said uncertainly. \"They can't do without us.\"\n\nDodd swung round to face him. The sunset was a deepening blaze in the\nCommons Room. \"Wait and find out,\" he said in a voice that suddenly\nrang on the metal walls. \"Wait and find out.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter a long time Albin said. \"Damn it, what you need is education. A\ncure. Fun. What I've been saying.\" He paused and took a breath. \"How\nabout it, Dodd?\"\n\nDodd didn't move. Another second passed. \"All right, Albin,\" he said\nslowly, at last. \"I'll think about it. I'll think about it.\"\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nThe sleeping room for the Small Ones was, by comparison with the great\nCommons Room only the masters inhabited, a tiny place. It had only the\nsmallest of windows, so placed as to allow daylight without any sight\nof the outside; the windows were plastic-sheeted slits high up on the\nmetal walls, no more. The room was, at best, dim, during the day, but\nthat hardly mattered: during the day the room was empty. Only at night,\nwhen the soft artificial lights went on, shedding the glow from their\nwall-shielded tubes, was the room fit for normal vision. There were\nno decorations, of course, and no chairs: the Alberts had no use for\nchairs, and decorations were a refinement no master had yet bothered to\nthink of. The Alberts were hardly taught to appreciate such things in\nany case: that was not what they had come to learn: it was not useful.\n\nThe floor of the room was covered with soft leaves striped a glossy\nbrown over the pervasive gray-green of the planet's foliage. These\nserved as a soft mat for sleeping, and were also the staple food of the\nAlberts. These were not disturbed to find their food strewn in such\nirregular heaps and drifts across the metal floor: in their birth sacs,\nthey had lived by ingestion from the floor of the forest, and, later,\nthey had been so fed in the Birth Huts to which the Elders had taken\nthem, and where they had been cleaned and served and taught, among\nother matters, English.\n\nWhat they had been taught was, at any rate, English of a sort, bearing\nwithin it the seeds of a more complex tongue, and having its roots far\nback in the pre-space centuries, when missionaries had first begun to\nvisit strange lands. Men had called it pidgin and Beche-le-mer and a\nhundred different names in a hundred different variations. Here, the\nmasters called it English. The Alberts called it words, and nothing\nmore.\n\nNow, after sunset, they filed in, thirty or so jewel-green cyclopean\nalligators at the end of their first day of training, waddling clumsily\npast the doorway and settled with a grateful, crouching squat on the\nleaves that served as bed and food. None were bothered by the act of\nsitting on the leaves: for one thing, they had no concept of dirt. In\nthe second place, they were rather remarkably clean. They had neither\nsex organs, in any human sense of the word, or specific organs of\nevacuation: their entire elimination was gaseous. Air ducts in the room\nwould draw off the waste products, and the Alberts never noticed them:\nthey had, in fact, no conception of evacuation as a process, since to\nthem the entire procedure was invisible and impalpable.\n\nThe last of them filed in, and the masters--two of them, carrying long\nmetal tubes--shut the door. The Alberts were alone. The door's clang\nwas followed by other sounds as the lock was thrown. The new noises,\nand the strangeness of bare metal walls and artificial light, still\nnovel after only a single day's training, gave rise to something very\nlike a panic, and a confused babble of voices arose from the crowd.\n\n\"What is this?\"\n\n\"What place is this?\"\n\n\"It is a training place.\"\n\n\"My name Hortat. My name Hortat.\"\n\n\"What is training?\"\n\n\"There is food here.\"\n\n\"What place is this?\"\n\n\"Where are elders?\"\n\n\"Are masters here?\"\n\n\"My food.\"\n\n\"Is this a place for sleeping?\"\n\n\"Training is to do what a master says. Training--\"\n\n\"There are no elders. My name Hortat.\"\n\n\"My place.\"\n\n\"My food.\"\n\n\"Where is this?\"\n\n\"Where is this place?\"\n\nLike the stirring of a child in sleep, the panic lasted only a little\nwhile, and gave way to an apathetic peace. Here and there an Albert\nmunched on a leaf, holding it up before his wide mouth in the pose of a\ngiant squirrel. Others sat quietly looking at the walls or the door or\nthe window, or at nothing. One, whose name was Cadnan, stirred briefly\nand dropped the leaf he was eating and turned to the Albert next to him.\n\n\"Marvor,\" he said. \"Are you troubled?\"\n\nMarvor seemed slighter than Cadnan, and his single eye larger, but\nboth looked very much alike to humans, as members of other races, and\nparticularly such races as the human in question judges inferior, are\nprone to do. \"I do not know what happens,\" he said in a flat tone. \"I\ndo not know what is this place, or what we do.\"\n\n\"This is the place of masters,\" Cadnan said. \"We train here, and we\nwork here, and live here. It is the rule of the masters.\"\n\n\"Yet I do not know,\" Marvor said. \"This training is a hard thing, and\nthe work is also hard when it comes.\"\n\nCadnan closed his eye for a second, to relax, but he found he wanted to\ntalk. His first day in the world of the masters had been too confusing\nfor him to order it into any sensible structure. Conversation, of\nwhatever kind, was a release, and might provide more facts. Cadnan was\nhungry for facts.\n\nHe opened his eye again.\n\n\"It is what the masters say,\" he told Marvor. \"The masters say we do a\nthing, and we do it. This is right.\"\n\nMarvor bent toward him. \"Why is it right?\" he asked.\n\n\"Because the masters say it is right,\" Cadnan told him, with the\nsurprised air of a person explaining the obvious. \"The elders, too, say\nit before we come to this place.\" He added the final sentence like a\ntotally unnecessary clincher--unimportant by comparison with the first\nreason, but adding a little weight of its own, and making the whole\nstory even more satisfying.\n\nMarvor, however, didn't seem satisfied. \"The masters always speak\ntruth,\" he said. \"Is this what you tell me?\"\n\n\"It is true,\" Cadnan said flatly.\n\nMarvor reflected for a second. \"It may be,\" he said at last. He turned\naway, found a leaf and began to munch on it slowly. Cadnan picked up\nhis own leaf quite automatically, and it was several seconds before he\nrealized that Marvor had ended the conversation. He didn't want it to\nend. Talk, he told himself dimly, was a good thing.\n\n\"Marvor,\" he said, \"do you question the masters?\" It was a difficult\nsentence to frame: the idea itself would never have occurred to him\nwithout Marvor's prodding, and it seemed now no more than the wildest\npossible flight of fancy. But Marvor, turning, did not treat it\nfancifully at all.\n\n\"I question all,\" he said soberly. \"It is good to question all.\"\n\n\"But the masters--\" Cadnan said.\n\nMarvor turned away again without answering.\n\nCadnan stared at his leaf for a time. His mind was troubled, and there\nwere no ready solutions in it. He was not of the temperament to fasten\nhimself to easy solutions. He had instead to hammer out his ideas\nslowly and carefully: then when he had reached a conclusion of some\nkind, he had confidence in it and knew it would last.\n\nMarvor was just the same--but perhaps there had been something wrong\nwith him from the beginning. Otherwise, Cadnan realized, he would\nnever have questioned the masters. None of the Alberts questioned the\nmasters, any more than they questioned their food or the air they\nbreathed.\n\nAfter a time Marvor spoke again. \"I am different,\" he said, \"I am not\nlike others.\"\n\nCadnan thought this too obvious to be worth reply, and waited.\n\n\"The elders tell me in the hut I am different,\" Marvor went on. \"When\nthey come to bring food they tell me this.\"\n\nCadnan took a deep breath of the air. It was, of course, scented with\nthe musk of the Alberts, but Cadnan could not recognize it: like his\nfellows, he had no sense of smell. \"Different is not good,\" he said,\nperceiving a lesson.\n\n\"You find out how different I am.\" Marvor sat very still. His voice was\nstill flat but the tone carried something very like a threat. Cadnan,\ninvolved in his own thinking, ignored it.\n\n\"The masters are big and we are small,\" he said slowly. \"The masters\nknow better than we know.\"\n\n\"That is silliness,\" Marvor said instantly. \"I want things. They make\nme do training. Why can I not do what I want to do?\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" Cadnan said with care, \"it is bad.\"\n\nMarvor made a hissing sound. \"Maybe they are bad,\" he said. \"Maybe the\nmasters and the elders are bad.\"\n\nMatters had gone so far that even this thought found a tentative\nlodgment in Cadnan's mind. But, almost at once, it was rejected as a\nserious concept. \"They give us leaves to eat,\" he said. \"They keep us\nhere, warm and dry in this place. How is this bad?\"\n\nMarvor closed his eye and made the hissing sound again; it was\nequivalent to a laugh of rejection. He turned among the leaves and\nfound enough room to lie down: in a few seconds he was either asleep\nor imitating sleep very well. Cadnan looked at him hopefully, and then\nturned away. A female was watching him from the other side, her eyes\nwide and unblinking.\n\n\"You ask many questions,\" the female said. \"You speak much.\"\n\nCadnan blinked his eye at her. \"I want to learn,\" he said.\n\n\"Is it good to learn?\" the female asked. The question made Cadnan\nuncomfortable: who knew, for certain, what was good? He knew he would\nhave to think it out for a long time. But the female wanted an answer.\n\n\"It is good,\" he said casually.\n\nThe female accepted that with quiet passivity. \"My name is Dara,\" she\nsaid. \"It is what I am called.\"\n\nCadnan said: \"I am Cadnan.\" He found himself tired, and Dara apparently\nsaw this and withdrew, leaving him to sleep.\n\nBut his sleep was troubled, and it seemed a long time before day came\nand the door opened again to show the masters with their strange metal\ntubes standing outside in the corridor.\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\"I'm not going to take no for an answer.\"\n\nAlbin stood in the doorway of his room, slouching against the metal\nlintel and looking even more like a gnome. Dodd sighed softly and got\nup from the single chair. \"I'm not anxious for a party,\" he said. \"All\nI want to do is go to sleep.\"\n\n\"At nine o'clock?\" Albin shook his head.\n\n\"Maybe I'm tired.\"\n\n\"You're not tired,\" Albin said. \"You're scared. You're scared of what\nyou might find out there in the cold, cruel world, friend. You're\nscared of parties and strange people and noise. You want to be left\nalone to brood, right?\"\n\n\"No, I--\"\n\n\"But I'm not going to leave you alone to brood,\" Albin said. \"Because\nI'm your friend. And brooding isn't good for you. It's brooding that's\ngot you into such a state--where you worry about growing things, for\nGod's sake, and about freedom and silly things like that.\" Albin\ngrinned. \"What you've got to do is stop worrying, and I know how to get\nyou to do that, kiddo. I really do.\"\n\n\"Sure you do,\" Dodd said, and his voice began to rise. He went to the\nbed, walked along its length to the window, as he talked, never facing\nAlbin. \"You know how to make me feel just fine, no worries at all, no\ncomplications, just a nice, simple life. With nothing at all in it,\nAlbin. Nothing at all.\"\n\n\"Now, come on--\" Albin began.\n\n\"Nothing,\" Dodd said. \"Go to parties, drink, meet a girl, forget, go\nright on forgetting, and then one day you wake up and it's over and\nwhat have you got?\"\n\n\"Parties,\" Albin said. \"Girls. Drinks. What else is there?\"\n\n\"A lot,\" Dodd said. \"I want--oh, God, I don't know what I want. Too\nmuch. Too many ideas ... trapped here being a master, and that's no\ngood.\"\n\n\"Dodd,\" Albin said, in what was almost a worried tone, \"what the hell\nare you talking about?\"\n\n\"Being a master,\" Dodd said. \"There shouldn't be masters. Or slaves.\nJust--beings, able to do what they want to do ... what makes me any\nbetter than the Alberts, anyhow?\"\n\n\"The Belbis beam, for one thing,\" Albin said. \"Position, power,\nprotection, punishment. What makes anybody better than anybody else?\"\n\n\"But that's the point--don't you see?\"\n\nAlbin stood upright, massaging his arm. \"What I see is a case of\nworry,\" he said, \"and as a doctor I have certain responsibilities. I've\ngot to take care of that case of worries, and I'm not going to take no\nfor an answer.\"\n\n\"Leave me alone,\" Dodd said. \"Just do me a favor. Leave me alone.\"\n\n\"Come with me,\" Albin said. \"This once. Look--what can you lose? Just\nonce can't hurt you--you can do all the brooding you want to do some\nother time. Give me a present. Come to the party with me.\"\n\n\"I don't like parties.\"\n\n\"And I don't like going alone,\" Albin said. \"So do me a favor.\"\n\n\"Where is it?\" Dodd asked after a second.\n\nAlbin beamed. \"Psych division,\" he said. \"Come on.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe metal door was festooned with paper drapery in red and blue.\nDodd turned before they got to it, standing about five feet down the\ncorridor. \"How did you find out about a party in Psych division?\" he\nasked.\n\nAlbin shrugged. \"I'm an active type,\" he said. \"I've got friends all\nover. You'd be surprised how many friends a man can have, Dodd, if he\ngoes to parties. If he meets people instead of brooding.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Dodd said. \"I'm here, aren't I? You've convinced me--stop\nthe propaganda.\"\n\n\"Sure.\" Albin went up to the door and knocked. From inside they could\nhear a dim babel of voices. After a second he knocked again, more\nloudly.\n\nA voice rose above the hum. \"Who's there?\"\n\n\"A friend,\" Albin said. \"The password is Haenlingen-on-fire.\"\n\nThe voice broke into laughter. \"Oh,\" it said. It was now\ndistinguishingly a female voice. \"It's you, Cendar. But hold it down on\nthe Haenlingen stuff: she's supposed to be arriving.\"\n\n\"At a party?\" Albin said. \"She's a hundred and twelve--older than that.\nWhat does she want with parties? Don't be silly.\"\n\nThe door opened. A slim, blonde girl stood by it, her mouth still\ngrinning. \"Cendar, I mean it,\" she said. \"You watch out. One of these\ndays you're going to get into trouble.\"\n\nBehind her the hum had risen to a chorus of mad clatter, conversation,\nlaughter, song--the girl dragged Albin and Dodd inside and shut the\ndoor. \"I'm always in trouble,\" Albin was saying. \"It keeps life\ninteresting.\" But it was hard to hear him, hard to hear any single\nvoice in the swell of noise.\n\n\"Thank God for soundproofing,\" the girl said. \"We can do whatever we\nlike and there's no noise out there.\"\n\n\"The drapes give you away,\" Albin said.\n\n\"Let the drapes give us away,\" the girl said. \"We're entitled to have\nquiet little gatherings, right? And who knows what goes on behind the\ndrapes?\"\n\n\"Right,\" Albin said. \"You are right. You are absolutely, incredibly,\nstunningly right. And to prove how right you are I'm going to do you a\nfavor.\"\n\n\"What kind of favor?\" the girl said with mock suspicion.\n\n\"Greta,\" Albin said, \"I'm going to introduce you to a nice young man.\"\n\n\"You don't know any nice young men.\"\n\n\"I know this one,\" Albin said. \"Greta Forzane, Johnny Dodd. Take good\ncare of him, kiddo--he needs it.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, good care of him?\" she said. But Albin was gone,\ninto the main body of the party, a melee confused enough so that he was\nlost in twenty steps. Greta turned back almost hopeless eyes.\n\nA second passed.\n\n\"You a friend of Cendar's?\" Greta asked.\n\nJohnny blinked and came back to her. \"Oh, Albin?\" he said.\n\"We're--acquaintances.\"\n\n\"Friends,\" Greta said firmly. \"That's nice. He's such a nice guy--I\nbet you are, too.\" She smiled and took his arm. Her hand was slightly\nwarm and very dry. Johnny took his first real look at her: she seemed\nshining, somehow, as if the hair had been lacquered, the face sprayed\nwith a clear polish. The picture she made was vaguely unpleasant, and a\nlittle threatening.\n\n\"A nice guy?\" he said. \"I wouldn't know, Miss Forzane.\"\n\n\"Oh, come on, now,\" she said. \"The name is Greta. And you're\nJohnny--right?\"\n\n\" ... Right.\"\n\n\"You know,\" Greta said, \"you're cute.\"\n\nBehind her the party was still going on, but its volume seemed to have\ndiminished a little. Or maybe, Johnny thought, he was getting used to\nit. \"You're cute too,\" he said awkwardly, not knowing any more what he\ndid want to do, or where he wanted to be. Her grasp on his arm was the\nmain fact in the world.\n\n\"Thanks,\" she said. \"Here.\"\n\nAnd as suddenly as that she was in his arms, plastered up against him,\npressed to him as tightly as he could imagine, her mouth on his, her\nhands locked behind his neck: he was choking, he couldn't breathe, he\ncouldn't move....\n\nThe door behind him opened and shoved him gently across his back.\n\nHe fell, and he fell on top of her.\n\nIt seemed as if the entire party had stopped to watch him. There was no\nnoise. There was no sound at all. He climbed to his feet to face the\neyes and found they were not on him, but behind him.\n\nA tiny white-haired woman stood there, her mouth one thin line of\ndisapproval. \"Well,\" she said. \"Having a good time?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn Dodd's mind, then and later, the sign began.\n\nThat was, as far as he could ever remember, the first second he had\neven seen it. It was there, behind his eyes, blinking on and off, like\na neon sign. Sometimes he paid no attention to it, but it was always\nthere, always telling him the same thing.\n\n_This is the end._\n\n_This is the end._\n\n_This is the end._\n\nHe looked into that ancient grim face and the sign began. And from then\non it never stopped, never stopped at all--\n\nUntil, of course, the end.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n                          PUBLIC OPINION ONE\n\n    Being an excerpt from a speech delivered by Grigor Pellasin\n    (Citizen, white male, age forty-seven, two arrests for Disorderly\n    Conduct,  occupation variable, residence variable) in the district\n    of Hyde Park, city of London, country of England, planet Earth of\n    the Confederation, in the year of the Confederation two hundred and\n    ten, on May fourteenth, from two-thirty-seven P. M. (Greenwich)\n    until three-forty-six P. M. (Greenwich), no serious incidents\n    reported.\n\nThey all talk about equality, friends, and you know what equality is?\nEquality is a license to rob you blind and steal you blind, to cut you\nup and leave the pieces for the garbage collector, to stuff what's left\nof you down an oubliette, friend, and forget about you. That's what\nequality is, friends, and don't you let them tell you any different.\n\nWhy, years ago there used to be servants, people who did what you told\nthem. And the servants got liberated, friends, they all got freedom and\nequality so they were just like us. Maybe you can remember about those\nservants, because they're all in the history books, and the historical\nnovels, and maybe you do a little light reading now and then, am I\nright about that?\n\nWell, sir, those servants got themselves liberated, and do you think\nthey liked it? Do you think they liked being free and equal?\n\nOh, don't ask the government, friends, because the government is going\nto tell you they liked it just fine, going to tell you they loved it\nbeing just like everybody else, free and equal and liberated at last.\n\nThe government's going to tell you a lot of things, and my advice\nis, friends, my advice is do some looking and listening for yourself\nand think it all out to the right conclusions. Otherwise you're\njust letting the government do all your thinking for you and that's\nsomething you don't want.\n\nNo, friends, you do your own thinking and you figure out whether they\nliked being free, these servants.\n\nYou know what being free meant for them?\n\nIt meant being out of work.\n\nAnd how do you think they liked that?\n\nNow, maybe here among us today, among you kind people listening to what\nI've got to say to you, maybe there are one or two who've been out of\nwork during their lifetimes. Am I right? Well, friends, you tell the\nothers here what it felt like.\n\nIt felt hopeless and dragged-out and like something you'd never want to\ngo through again, am I right?\n\nOf course I'm right, friends. But there was nothing you could do about\nbeing out of work. If you were out of work that was that, and you were\nthrough, no chance, no place to move.\n\nThese servants, friends, they liked being servants. I know that's hard\nto believe because everybody's been telling you different all your\nlives, but you just do a little independent thinking, the way I have,\nand you'll see. It was a good job, being a servant. It was steady and\ndependable and you knew where you stood.\n\nBetter than being out of work? You bet your last credit, you bet your\nvery last ounce of bounce on that, friends.\n\nAnd better than a lot of other things, too. They were safe and warm and\nhappy, and they felt fine.\n\nAnd then a lot of busybodies came along and liberated them.\n\nWell, friends, some of them went right back and asked to be servants\nagain--they did so. It's a historical fact. But that was no good: the\nmachines had taken over and there was no room for them.\n\nThey were liberated for good.\n\nAnd the lesson you learn from that, friends, is just this: don't go\naround liberating people until you know what they want. Maybe they're\nhappier the way they are.\n\nNow, out on a far planet there's a strange race. Maybe you've heard\nabout them, because they work for us, they help get us the metals we\nneed to keep going. They're part of the big line of supply that keeps\nus all alive, you and me both.\n\nAnd there are some people talking about liberating those creatures,\ntoo, which aren't even human beings. They're green and they got one\neye apiece, and they don't talk English except a little, or any\nConfederation tongue.\n\nYet even so there are people who want to liberate those creatures.\n\nNow, you sit back and think a minute. Do those creatures want to be\nliberated? Is it like liberating you and me, who know what's what and\ncan think and make decisions? Because being free and equal means voting\nand everything else. Do you want these green creatures voting in the\nsame assemblies as yours?\n\nIf it were cruel to keep them the way they are, working on their own\nworld and being fed and kept warm and safe, why, I'd say go ahead and\nliberate them. But what's cruel about it, friends?\n\nThey're safe--safer than they would be on their own.\n\nThey're fed well and kept warm.\n\nAnd remember those servants, friends. Maybe the greenies like their\nlife, too. It's their world and their metal--they have a right to help\nsend it along.\n\nYou don't want to act hastily, friends, now do you?\n\nMy advice to you is this: just let the greenies alone. Just let them\nbe, the way they want to be, and don't go messing around where there's\nno need to mess around. Because if anybody starts to do that, why, it\ncan lead to trouble, friends, to a whole lot of unnecessary bother and\ntrouble.\n\nAm I right?\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\"I don't mind parties, Norma, not ordinary parties. But that one didn't\nlook like an ordinary party.\"\n\nNorma stood her ground in front of the desk. This, after all, was\nimportant \"But, Dr. Haenlingen, we--\"\n\n\"Don't try to persuade me,\" the little old woman said sharply. \"Don't\ntry to cozen me into something: I know all the tricks, Norma. I\ninvented a good third of them, and it's been a long time since I had to\nuse a textbook to remember the rest.\"\n\n\"I'm not trying to persuade you of anything.\" The woman wouldn't\nlisten, that was the whole trouble: in the harsh bright light of\nmorning she sat like a stone statue, casting a shadow of black on the\npolished desk. This was Dr. Haenlingen--and how did you talk to Dr.\nHaenlingen? But it was important, Norma reminded herself again: it was\nperfectly possible that the entire group of people at the party would\nbe downgraded, or at the least get marked down on their records. \"But\nwe weren't doing anything harmful. If you have a party you've got to\nexpect people to--oh, to get over-enthusiastic, maybe. But certainly\nthere was nothing worth getting angry about. There was--\"\n\n\"I'm sure you've thought all this out,\" Dr. Haenlingen said tightly.\n\"You seem to have your case well prepared, and it would be a pleasure\nto listen to you.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Unfortunately,\" the woman continued in a voice like steel, \"I have a\ngreat deal of work to do this morning.\"\n\n\"Dr. Haenlingen--\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" she said, but she didn't sound sorry in the least. Her\neyes went down to a pile of papers on the desk. A second passed.\n\n\"You've got to listen to me,\" Norma said. \"What you're doing is unfair.\"\n\nDr. Haenlingen didn't look up. \"Oh?\"\n\n\"They were just--having fun,\" Norma said. \"There was nothing wrong,\nnothing at all. You happened to come in at a bad moment, but it didn't\nmean anything, there wasn't anything going on that should have bothered\nyou....\"\n\n\"Perhaps not,\" Dr. Haenlingen said. \"Unfortunately, what bothers me is\nnot reducible to rule.\"\n\n\"But you're going to act on it,\" Norma said. \"You're going to--\"\n\n\"Yes?\" Dr. Haenlingen said. \"What am I going to do?\"\n\n\"Well, you--\"\n\n\"Downgrade the persons who were there?\" Dr. Haenlingen asked. \"Enter\nremarks in the permanent records? Prevent promotion? Just what am I\nsupposed to have in mind?\"\n\n\"Well, I thought--I--\"\n\n\"I plan,\" Dr. Haenlingen said, \"nothing whatever. Not just at present.\nI want to think about what I saw, about the people I saw. At present,\nnothing more.\"\n\nThere was a little silence. Norma felt herself relax. Then she asked:\n\"At present?\"\n\nDr. Haenlingen looked up at her, the eyes ice-cold and direct. \"What\naction I determine to take,\" she said, \"will be my responsibility. Mine\nalone. I do not intend to discuss it, or to attempt to justify it, to\nyou or to anyone.\"\n\n\"Yes, Dr. Haenlingen.\" Norma stood awkwardly. \"Thank you--\"\n\n\"Don't thank me--yet,\" Dr. Haenlingen said. \"Go and do your own work.\nI've got quite a lot to oversee here.\" She went back to her papers.\nNorma turned, stopped and then walked to the door. At the door she\nturned again but Dr. Haenlingen was paying no visible attention to\nher. She opened the door, went out and closed it behind her.\n\nIn the corridor she took one deep breath and then another.\n\nThe trouble was, you couldn't depend on the woman to do anything. She\nmeant exactly what she had said: \"For the present.\" And who could tell\nwhat might happen later?\n\nNorma headed for her own cubicle, where she ignored the papers and the\ntelephone messages waiting for her and reached for the intercom button\ninstead. She pushed it twice and a voice said:\n\n\"What happened?\"\n\n\"It's not good, Greta,\" Norma said. \"It's--well, undecided, anyhow:\nwe've got that much going for us.\"\n\n\"Undecided?\" the voice asked.\n\n\"She said she wouldn't do anything--yet. But she left it open.\"\n\n\"Oh. Lord. Oh, my.\"\n\nNorma nodded at the intercom speaker. \"That's right. Anything's\npossible--you know what she's like.\"\n\n\"Oh, Lord. Do I.\"\n\n\"And--Greta, why did you have to be there, right by the door, with that\nstrange type--as if it had been set up for her? Right in front of her\neyes....\"\n\n\"An accident,\" Greta said. \"A pure by-God accident. When she walked\nin, when I saw her, believe me, Norma, my blood ran absolutely cold.\nTemperature of ice, or something colder than ice.\"\n\n\"Just that one look, just that one long look around.\" Norma said, \"and\nshe was gone. As if she'd memorized us, every one of us, filed the\nwhole thing away and didn't need to see any more.\"\n\n\"I would have explained. But there wasn't any time.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Norma said. \"Greta, who was he, anyhow?\"\n\n\"Him?\" Greta said. \"Who knows? A friend of Cendar's--you know Cendar,\ndon't you?\"\n\n\"Albin Cendar?\"\n\n\"That's the one. He--\"\n\n\"But he's not from Psych.\" Norma said.\n\n\"Neither is his friend, I guess,\" Greta said. \"But they come over, you\nknow that--Cendar's always around.\"\n\n\"And you had to invite them....\"\n\n\"Invite?\" Greta said. \"I didn't invite anybody. They were there, that's\nall. Cendar always shows up. You know that.\"\n\n\"Great,\" Nonna said. \"So last night he had to bring a friend and the\nfriend got grabby--\"\n\n\"No,\" Greta said. \"He was--well, confused maybe. Never been to a party\nof ours before, or anyhow not that I remember. I was trying to--loosen\nhim up.\"\n\n\"You loosened everybody up,\" Norma said.\n\nThere was a silence.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Norma said. \"All right. You couldn't have known--\"\n\n\"I didn't know anything,\" Greta's voice said. \"She was there, that's\nall.\"\n\n\"I wonder whether Dr. Haenlingen knew him,\" Norma said. \"The new one, I\nmean.\"\n\n\"His name was Johnny something,\" Greta said.\n\n\"We'll just have to wait and find out,\" Norma said. \"Whatever she's\ngoing to do, there isn't any way to stop it. I did the best I could--\"\n\n\"Sure you did,\" Greta said. \"We know that. Sure.\"\n\n\"Cendar and his friends--\" Norma began.\n\n\"Oh, forget about that,\" Greta said. \"Who cares about them?\"\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nThe party had meant nothing, nothing at all, and Albin told himself he\ncould forget all about it.\n\nIf Haenlingen wanted to take any action, he insisted, she'd take it\nagainst her own division. The Psych people would get most of it. Why,\nshe probably didn't even know who Albin Cendar was....\n\nBut the Psych division knew a lot they weren't supposed to know. Maybe\nshe would even....\n\nForget about it, Albin told himself. He closed his eyes for a second\nand concentrated on his work. That, at least, was something to keep him\nfrom worrying: the whole process of training was something he could\nuse in forgetting all about the party, and Haenlingen, and possible\nconsequences.... He took a few breaths and forced his mind away from\nall of that, back to the training.\n\nTraining was a dreary waste of time, as a matter of fact--except that\nit happened to be necessary. There was no doubt of that: without\nsufficient manual labor, the metal would not be dug, the smelters\nwould not run, the purifying stages and the cooling stages and even\nthe shipping itself would simply stop. Automation would have solved\neverything, but automation was expensive. The Alberts were cheap--so\nFruyling's World used Alberts instead of transistors and cryogenic\nrelays.\n\nAnd if you were going to use Alberts at all, Albin thought, you sure as\nhell had to train them. God alone knew what harm they could do, left\nalone in a wilderness of delicate machinery without any instructions.\n\nAll the same, \"dreary\" was the word for it. (An image of Dr.\nHaenlingen's frozen face floated into his mind. He pushed it away. It\nwas morning. It was time for work.)\n\nHe met Derban at the turn in the corridor, perhaps fifty feet before\nthe Alberts' door. That wasn't strictly according to the rules, and\nAlbin knew it: he had learned the code as early as anyone else. But the\nrules were for emergencies--and emergencies didn't happen any more. The\nAlberts weren't about to revolt.\n\nHe was carrying his Belbis beam, of course. The little metal tube\ndidn't look like much, but it was guaranteed to stop anything short\nof a spaceship in its tracks, and by the very simple method of making\nholes. The Belbis beam would make holes in nearly anything: Alberts,\npeople or most materials. It projected a quarter-inch beam of force in\nas near a straight line as Einsteinian physics would allow, and it was\nextremely efficient. Albin had been practicing with it for three years,\ntwice a week.\n\nEverybody did. Not that there's ever been a chance to use it.\n\nAnd there wasn't going to be a chance, Albin decided. He exchanged a\nword or two absently with Derban and they went to the door together.\nAlbin reached for the door but Derban's big brown hand was already on\nit. He grinned and swung the door open.\n\nAir conditioning had done something to minimize the reek inside, but\nnot much. Albin devoted most of his attention to keeping his face a\ncomplete mask. The last thing he wanted was to retch--not in front of\nthe Alberts, who didn't really exist for him, but in front of Derban.\nAnd the party (which he wasn't going to think about) hadn't left his\nstomach in perfect shape.\n\nThe Alberts, seeing these masters enter stirred and rose. Albin barked\nat them in a voice that was only very slightly choked: \"Form a line.\nForm a line.\"\n\nThe Alberts milled around, quite obviously uncertain what a line was.\nAlbin gripped his beam tighter, not because it was a weapon but just\nbecause he needed something handy to take out his anger on.\n\n\"Damn it,\" he said tightly, \"a line. Form a straight line.\"\n\n\"It's only their second day,\" Derban said in a low voice. \"Give them\ntime.\" Albin could barely hear him over the confused babble of the\nAlberts. He shook his head and felt a new stab of anger.\n\n\"One behind the other,\" he told the milling crowd. \"A line, a straight\nline.\"\n\nAfter a little more confusion, Albin was satisfied. He sighed heavily\nand beckoned with his beam: the Alberts started forward, through the\ndoor and out into the corridor.\n\nAlbin went before, Derban behind, falling naturally into step. They\ncame to the great elevator and Albin pushed a stud. The door slid open.\n\nThe Alberts, though, didn't want to go in. They huddled, looking at\nthe elevator with big round eyes, muttering to themselves and to\neach other. Derban spoke up calmly: \"This is the same room you were\nin yesterday. It won't hurt you. Just go through the door. It's all\nright.\" But the words had very little effect. A few of the Alberts\nmoved closer and then, discovering that they were alone, hurriedly\nmoved back again. The elevator door remained open, waiting.\n\nAlbin, ready to shriek with rage by now, felt a touch at his arm. One\nof the Alberts was standing near him, looking up. Its eye blinked: it\nspoke. \"Why does the room move?\" The voice was not actually unpleasant,\nbut its single eye stared at Albin, making him uncomfortable. He told\nhimself not to blow up. Calm. _Calm._\n\n\"The room moves because it moves,\" he said, a little too quickly.\n\"Because the masters tell it to move. What do you want to know for?\"\n\n\"I want to learn,\" the Albert said calmly.\n\n\"Well, don't ask questions,\" Albin said. He kept one eye on the\nshifting mob. \"If there's anything good for you to know, you'll be\ntold. Meanwhile, just don't ask any questions.\"\n\nThe Albert looked downcast. \"Can I learn without questions?\"\n\nAlbin's control snapped. \"Damn it, you'll learn what you have to!\" he\nyelled. \"You don't have to ask questions--you're a slave. A slave! Get\nthat through your green head and shut up!\"\n\nThe tone had two effects. First, it made the Albert near him move back,\nstaring at him still with that single bright eye. Second, the others\nstarted for the elevator, apparently pushed more by the tone than the\nwords. A master was angry. That, they judged, meant trouble. Acceding\nto his wishes was the safest thing to do.\n\nAnd so, in little, frightened bunches, they went in. When they were all\nclear of the door, Albin and Derban stepped in, too, and the doors slid\nshut. Derban took a second to mutter secretly: \"You don't have to lose\nyour temper. You're on a hell of a thin edge this morning.\"\n\nAlbin flicked his eyes over the brown face, the stocky, stolid figure.\n\"So I'm on a thin edge,\" he said. \"Aren't you?\"\n\n\"Training is training,\" Derban said. \"Got to put up with it, because\nwhat can you do about it?\"\n\nAlbin grinned wryly. \"I told somebody else that, last night,\" he said.\n\"Man named Dodd--hell, you know Johnny Dodd. Told him he needed some\nfun. Holy jumping beavers--fun.\"\n\n\"Maybe you need some,\" Derban said.\n\n\"Not like last night, I don't,\" Albin said, and the elevator door\nopened.\n\nNow others took over, guiding the Alberts to their individual places on\nthe training floor. Each had a small room to himself, and each room had\na spy-TV high up in a corner as a safeguard.\n\nBut the spy-eyes were just as much good as the beams, Albin thought.\nThey were useless precautions: rebellion wasn't about to happen. It\nmade more sense, if you thought about it, to worry the way Johnny Dodd\nworried, about the Confederation--against which spy-eyes and Belbis\nbeams weren't going to do any good anyhow. (And nothing was going to\nhappen. Nothing, he told himself firmly, was going to happen. Nothing.)\n\nThe Alberts were shunted off without trouble. Albin, heaving a small\nsigh, fixed the details of his next job in his mind: quality control\nin a smelting process. It took him a few seconds to calm down and get\nready, and then he headed for room six, where one Albert waited for\nhim, trying to think only of the job ahead, and not at all of the\nparty, of Dr. Haenlingen, of Johnny Dodd, of rebellion and war.\n\nHe nearly succeeded.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen he opened the door the Albert inside turned, took a single look at\nhim, and said: \"I do not mean to make masters troubled.\"\n\nAlbin said: \"What?\"\n\n\"I do not ask questions now.\" Albin blinked, and then grinned.\n\n\"Oh,\" he said. \"You're the one. Damn right you don't ask questions. You\njust listen to what I tell you--got that?\"\n\n\"I listen,\" the Albert said.\n\nAlbin shut the door and leaned against it. \"Okay,\" he said. \"Now the\nfirst thing, you come over here and watch me.\" He went to the far side\nof the room, flicked on the remote set, and waited for it to warm up.\nIn a few seconds it held a strong, steady picture: a single smelter, a\nladle, an expanse of flooring.\n\n\"I see this when you teach me before,\" the Albert said in almost a\ndisappointed tone.\n\n\"I know,\" Albin told it. Routine was taking over and he felt almost\ncheerful again. There was a woman working in the food labs in Building\nTwo. He'd noticed her a few times in the past weeks. Now he thought of\nher again, happily. Maybe tonight \"This time I'm going to show you what\nto do,\" he told the Albert, and swept a hand over a row of buttons. In\nthe smelter, metal began to heat.\n\nThe job was simple enough: the metal, once heated, had to be poured\nout into the ladle, which acted as a carrier to take the stuff on to\nits next station. The only critical point was the color of the heated\nliquid, and the eyes of Alberts and humans saw the same spectrum,\nwith perhaps a little more discrimination in the eyes of the Alberts.\nThis Albert had to be taught to let the process go unless the color\nwas wrong, when a series of buttons would stop everything and send a\nquality alarm into men's quarters.\n\nA machine could have done the job very easily, but machines were\nexpensive. An Albert could be taught in a week.\n\nAnd this one seemed to learn more quickly than most. It grasped the\nidea of button-pushing before the end of the day, and Albin made a\nmental note to see if he could speed matters up, maybe by letting the\nAlbert have a crack at actually doing the job on its own by day four or\nfive instead of day six.\n\n\"You learn fast,\" he said, when work was finally over. He felt both\ntired and tense, but the thought of relaxation ahead kept him nearly\ngenial.\n\n\"I want to learn,\" the Albert said.\n\n\"Good boy,\" Albin said absently. \"What's your name?\"\n\n\"Cadnan.\"\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nBut Cadnan, he knew, was only a small name: it was not a great name. He\nknew now that he had a great name, and it made him proud because he was\nno longer only small Cadnan: he was a slave.\n\nIt was good, he knew, to be a slave. A slave worked and got food and\nshelter from the masters, and the masters told him what he could know\nwithout even the need of asking a question. The elders were only\nelders, but the masters were masters, and Cadnan was a slave. It made\nhim feel great and wise when he thought of it.\n\nThat night he could hardly wait to tell his news to Marvor--but Marvor\nacted as if he knew it already and was even made angry by the idea.\n\"What is a slave?\" he asked, in a flat, bad tone.\n\nCadnan told him of the work, the food, the shelter....\n\n\"And what is a master?\" Marvor asked.\n\n\"A master is a master,\" Cadnan said. \"A master is the one who knows.\"\n\n\"A master tells you what to do,\" Marvor said. \"I am training and there\nis more training to come and then work. This is because of the masters.\"\n\n\"It is good,\" Cadnan said. \"It is important.\"\n\nMarvor shook his head, looking very much like a master himself. \"What\nis important?\" he said.\n\nCadnan thought for a minute. \"Important is what a master needs for\nlife,\" he said at last. \"The masters need a slave for life, because a\nslave must push the buttons. Without this work the masters do not live.\"\n\n\"Then why do the masters not push the buttons?\" Marvor said.\n\n\"It is good they do not,\" Cadnan said stubbornly. \"A slave is a big\nthing, and Cadnan is only a little thing. It is better to be big than\nlittle.\"\n\n\"It is better to be master than slave,\" Marvor said sullenly.\n\n\"But we are not masters,\" Cadnan said, with the air of a person trying\nto bring reason back to the discussion. \"We do not look like masters,\nand we do not know what they know.\"\n\n\"You want to learn,\" Marvor said. \"Then learn what they know.\"\n\n\"They teach me,\" Cadnan said. \"But I am still a slave, because they\nteach me. I do not teach them.\"\n\nMarvor hissed and at the same time shook his head like a master. The\neffect was not so much frightening as puzzling: he was a creature,\nsuddenly, who belonged to both worlds, and to neither. \"A master is one\nwho does what he wants,\" he said. \"If I do what I want, am I a master?\"\n\n\"That is silliness,\" Cadnan said. Marvor seemed about to reply, but\nboth were surprised instead by the opening of the door.\n\nA master stood in the lighted entrance, holding to the sides with both\nhands.\n\nAnyone with a thorough knowledge of men could have told that he was\ndrunk. Any being with a sense of smell could have detected the odors of\nthat drunkenness. But the Alberts knew only that a master had come to\nthem during the time for eating and sleeping. They stirred, murmuring\nrestlessly.\n\n\"It's all right,\" the master said, slurring his words only very\nslightly. \"I wanted to come and talk. I wanted to talk to one of you.\"\n\nBefore anyone else could move, Cadnan was upright. \"I will talk,\" he\nsaid in a loud voice. The others stared at him, including Marvor. Even\nCadnan himself was a little surprised at his own speed and audacity.\n\n\"Come on over,\" the master said from the doorway. \"Come on over.\" He\nmade a beckoning motion.\n\nCadnan picked his way across the room over wakeful Alberts.\n\nWhen he had reached the master, the master said: \"Sit down.\" He looked\nstrange, Cadnan realized, though he could not tell exactly how.\n\nCadnan sat and the master, closing the door, sat with his back against\nit. There was a second of silence, which the master broke abruptly.\n\n\"My name's Dodd,\" he said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I am called Cadnan,\" Cadnan said. He couldn't resist bringing out his\nlatest bit of knowledge for display. \"I am a slave.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Dodd said dully. \"I know. The rest of them say I shouldn't, but\nI think about you a lot. About all of you.\"\n\nCadnan, not knowing if this were good or bad, said nothing at all, but\nwaited. Dodd sighed, shook his head and closed his eyes. After a second\nhe went on.\n\n\"They tell me, let the slaves have their own life,\" he said. \"But\nI don't see it that way. Do you see it that way? After all, you're\npeople, aren't you? Just like us.\"\n\nCadnan tried to untangle the questions, and finally settled for a\nsimple answer. \"We are slaves,\" he said. \"You are masters.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Dodd said. \"But I mean people. And you want the same things\nwe do. You want a little comfort out of life, a little security--some\nfood, say, and enough food for tomorrow. Right?\"\n\n\"It is good to have,\" Cadnan said. He was determined to keep his end of\nthe odd conversation up, even if it seemed to be leading nowhere.\n\n\"It isn't as if we've been here forever,\" Dodd said. \"Only--well, a\nhundred or so of your years. Three generations, counting me. And here\nwe are lording it over you, just because of an accident. We happen to\nbe farther advanced than you, that's all.\"\n\n\"You are masters,\" Cadnan said. \"You know everything.\"\n\n\"Not quite,\" Dodd said. \"For instance, we don't know about you. You\nhave--well, you have got mates, haven't you? Hell, of course you do.\nMale or female. Same as us. More or less.\"\n\n\"We have mates, when we are ready for mates,\" Cadnan said.\n\nDodd nodded precariously. \"Uh-huh,\" he said. \"Mates. They tell me I\nneed mates, but I tried it and I got into trouble. Mates aren't the\nanswer, kid. Cadnan. They simply aren't the answer.\"\n\nCadnan thought, suddenly, of Dara. He had not spoken to her again,\nbut he was able to think of her. When the time of mating came, it was\npossible that she would be his mate....\n\nBut that was forbidden, he told himself. They came from the same tree\nin the same time. The rule forbade such matings.\n\n\"What we ought to do,\" Dodd said abruptly, \"is we ought to do a\nthorough anthropological--anthropological study on you people. A really\nbig job. But that's uneconomic, see? Because we know what we have to\nknow. Where to find you, what to feed you, how to get you to work. They\ndon't care about the rest.\"\n\n\"The masters are good,\" Cadnan said stolidly into the silence. \"They\nlet me work.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Dodd said, and shrugged, nearly losing his balance. He\nrecovered, and went on as if nothing at all had happened. \"They let\nyou work for them,\" he said. \"And what do you get out of it? Food and\nshelter and security, I guess. But how would you like to work for\nyourself instead?\"\n\nCadnan stared. \"I do not understand,\" he said slowly.\n\nDodd shook his head. \"No,\" he said. \"How would you like it if there\nwere no masters? Only people, just you and your people, living your own\nlives and making your own decisions? How about that, kid?\"\n\n\"We would be alone,\" Cadnan said simply. \"No master would feed us. We\nwould die.\"\n\n\"No,\" Dodd said again. \"What did you do before we came?\"\n\n\"It was different,\" Cadnan said. \"It was not good. This is better.\" He\ntried to imagine a world without masters, but the picture would not\ncome. Obviously, then, the world he lived in was better: it was better\nthan nothing.\n\n\"Slaves,\" Dodd said to himself. \"With a slave mentality.\" And then:\n\"Tell me, Cadnan, do they all think like you?\"\n\nCadnan didn't think of Marvor. By now he was so confused by this\nstrange conversation that his answer was automatic. \"We do not talk\nabout it.\"\n\nDodd looked at him mistily. \"I'm disturbing you for nothing,\" he said.\n\"Nothing I can do but get killed trying to start up a slave revolt.\nWhich might be okay, but I don't know. If you get me--I don't know\nabout that, kid. Right?\" He stood up, a little shakily, still leaning\nagainst the door. \"And frankly,\" he said, \"I don't want to get killed\nover a lot of alligators.\"\n\n\"No one wishes to die,\" Cadnan said.\n\n\"You'd be surprised,\" Dodd told him. He moved and opened the door.\nFor a second he stood in the entrance. \"People can wish for almost\nanything,\" he said. \"You'd be surprised.\" The door banged shut and he\nwas gone.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCadnan sat staring at the door for a second, his mind a tangle of ideas\nand of new words for which he had no referents whatever. When he turned\naway at last his eye fell on Dara, curled in a far corner. She was\nlooking at him but when he saw her he looked away. That disturbed him,\ntoo: the rules were very clear on matings.\n\nCadnan wanted to tell someone what he felt. He wanted information,\nand he wanted someone to follow. But the masters were masters: he\ncould not be like them. And in the room where he slept there were no\nelders. The thought of speaking with an elder, in any case, gave him no\nsatisfaction. He did not want an elder: he could not join the masters\nand ask questions.\n\nSomewhere, he told himself, there would be someone....\n\nSomewhere....\n\nOf course, there was Marvor. Later in the night, while Cadnan still lay\nawake trying to put thoughts and words together in his mind, Marvor\nmoved closer to him.\n\n\"I want you with me,\" he said.\n\nBut Marvor, Cadnan had decided, was bad. \"I sleep here,\" Cadnan said, a\ntrifle severely. \"I do not move my place.\"\n\nIn the dimness Marvor shook his head _no_, like a master. \"I want you\nwith me in the plan I have,\" he said. \"I want you to help me.\"\n\nThat was different. The rules of the elders covered such a request.\n\"Does a brother refuse help to a brother?\" Cadnan asked. \"We are from\nthe same tree and the same time. Tell me what I must do.\"\n\nMarvor opened his mouth wide, wider, until Cadnan saw the flash of his\nmany teeth, and a second passed in silence. Then Marvor snapped his\njaws shut, hissing, and spoke. \"The masters tell us what to do. They\nmake our life for us.\"\n\n\"This is true,\" Cadnan muttered.\n\n\"It is evil,\" Marvor said. \"It is bad. We must make our own lives.\nEvery thing makes its own life.\"\n\n\"We are slaves,\" Cadnan said. \"This is our life. It is our place.\"\n\nMarvor sat up suddenly. Around them the others muttered and stirred.\n\"Does the plant grow when a master tells it?\" he asked. \"Does the tree\nbud when a master tells it? So we must also grow in our own way.\"\n\n\"We are not plants or trees,\" Cadnan said.\n\n\"We are alive,\" Marvor said in a fierce, sudden whisper. \"The masters,\ntoo, are alive. We are the same as they. Why do they tell us what to\ndo?\"\n\nCadnan was very patient. \"Because they know, and we do not,\" he said.\n\"Because they tell us, that is all. It is the way things are.\"\n\n\"I will change the way things are,\" Marvor said. He spoke now more\nsoftly still. \"Do you want to be a master?\"\n\n\"I am no master,\" Cadnan said wearily. \"I am a slave.\"\n\n\"That is a bad thing.\" Cadnan tried to speak, but Marvor went on\nwithout stopping. \"Dara is with me,\" he said, \"and some of the others.\nThere are not many. Most of the brothers and sisters are cowards.\"\n\nThen he had to define \"coward\" for Cadnan--and from \"coward\" he\nprogressed to another new word, \"freedom.\" That was a big word but\nCadnan approached it without fear, and without any preconception.\n\n\"It is not good to be free,\" he said at last, in a reasonable, weary\ntone. \"In the cold there is a bad thing. In the rain there is a bad\nthing. To be free is to go to these bad things.\"\n\n\"To be free is to do what you want,\" Marvor said. \"To be free is to be\nyour own master.\"\n\nAfter some thought Cadnan asked: \"Who can be his own master? It is like\nbeing your own mate.\"\n\nMarvor seemed to lose patience all at once. \"Very well,\" he said. \"But\nyou will not tell the masters what I say?\"\n\n\"Does a brother harm a brother?\" Cadnan asked. That, too, was in the\nrules: even Marvor, he thought sleepily, had to accept the rules.\n\n\"It is good,\" Marvor said equably. \"Soon, very soon, I will make you\nfree.\"\n\n\"I do not want to be free.\"\n\n\"You will want it,\" Marvor said. \"I tell you something you do not know.\nFar away from here there are free ones. Ones without masters. I hear\nof them in the Birth Huts: they are elders who bring up their own in\nhiding from the masters. They want to be free.\"\n\nCadnan felt a surge of hope. Marvor might leave, take away the\ndisturbance he always carried with him. \"You will go and join them?\"\n\n\"No,\" Marvor said. \"I will go to them and bring them back and kill all\nthe masters. I will make the masters dead.\"\n\n\"You cannot do it,\" Cadnan said instantly, shocked.\n\n\"I can,\" Marvor said without raising his voice. \"Wait and you will see.\nSoon we will be free. Very soon now.\"\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nThis is the end.\n\nDodd woke with the words in his mind, flashing on and off like a\nlighted sign. Back in the Confederation (he had seen pictures) there\nwere moving stair-belts, and at the exits, at turnoffs, there were\nflashing signs. The words in his mind were like that: if he ignored\nthem he would be carried on past his destination, into darkness and\nstrangeness.\n\nBut his destination was strange, too. His head pounded, his tongue was\nthick and cottony in a dry mouth: drinking had provided nothing of an\nescape and the price he had to pay was much too high.\n\n_This is the end._\n\nThere was no escape, he told himself dimly! The party had resulted\nonly in that sudden appearance, the grim-mouthed old woman. Drinking\nhad resulted in no more than this new sickness, and a cloudy memory of\nhaving talked to an Albert, some Albert, somewhere.... He opened his\neyes, felt pain and closed them again. There was no escape: the party\nAlbin had taken him to had led to trouble, his own drunkenness had led\nto trouble. He saw the days stretching out ahead of him and making\nyears.\n\nIt was nearly time now to begin work. To begin the job of training,\nwith the Alberts, the job he was going to do through all those days and\nyears lying ahead.\n\n_This is the end._\n\nHe found himself rising, dressing, shaving off the stubble of beard.\nHis head hurt, his eyes ached, his mouth was hardly improved by a\ngargle, but all that was far away, as distant as his own body and his\nown motions.\n\nHis head turned and looked at the clock set into his wall. The eyes\nnoted a position of the hands and passed the information to the brain:\n8:47. The brain decided that it was time to go on to work. The body\nmoved itself in accustomed patterns, opening the door, passing through\nthe opening, shutting the door again, walking down the hallway.\n\nAll that was very distant. Dodd, himself, was--somewhere else.\n\nHe met his partner standing before a group of the Alberts. Dodd's eyes\nnoted the expression on his partner's face. The brain registered the\ninformation, interpreted it and predicted. Dodd knew he would hear, and\ndid hear, sounds: \"What's wrong with _you_ this morning?\"\n\nThe correct response was on file. \"Drinking a little too much last\nnight, I guess.\" It was all automatic: everything was automatic. The\nAlberts went into their elevator, and Dodd and his partner followed.\nDodd's body did not stumble. But Dodd was somewhere else.\n\nThe elevator stopped, the Alberts went off to their sections, Dodd's\npartner went to his first assignment, Dodd found his body walking away\ndown the hall, opening a door, going through the opening, shutting the\ndoor. The Albert inside looked up.\n\n\"Today we are going to do the work together.\" Dodd heard his own\nvoice: it was all perfectly automatic, there were no mistakes. \"Do you\nunderstand?\"\n\n\"Understand,\" the Albert said.\n\n_This is the end._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt the end of the day he was back from wherever he had been, from the\ndarkness that had wrapped his mind like cotton and removed him. There\nwas no surprise now. There was no emotion at all: his work was over and\nhe could be himself again. In the back of his mind the single phrase\nstill flashed, but he had long since stopped paying attention to that.\n\nHe finished supper and went into the Commons Room, walking aimlessly.\n\nShe was sitting in a chair, with her back to the great window. As Dodd\ncame in she looked up at him. \"Hello, there.\"\n\nDodd waved a hand and, going over, found a chair and brought it to\nhers. \"I'm sorry about the other night--\"\n\n\"Think nothing of it,\" the girl said. \"Anyhow, we're not in any\ntrouble, and we would have been by now, if you see what I mean.\"\n\n\"I'm glad.\" He was no more than polite. There was no more in him, no\nemotion at all. He had reached a blank wall: there was no escape for\nhim or for the Alberts. He could see nothing but pain ahead.\n\nAnd so he had turned off the pain, and, with it, everything else.\n\n\"Do you come here often?\" the girl was saying. He had been introduced\nto her once, but he couldn't remember her name. It was there, filed\naway....\n\n\"Greta Forzane,\" he said involuntarily.\n\nShe smiled at him, leaning a little forward. \"That's right,\" she said.\n\"And you're Johnny Dodd. And do you come here often?\"\n\n\"... Sometimes.\" He waited. Soon she would stop, and he could leave,\nand....\n\nAnd?\n\n\"Anyhow, it was just as much my fault as yours,\" Greta was saying. \"And\nthere's no reason why we can't be friends. All right?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\nThere was a brief silence, but he hardly noticed that.\n\n\"I'm sorry if I'm bothering you,\" she said.\n\n\"Not at all.\" His eyes were looking at her, but that made no\ndifference. There was nothing left, nothing.\n\nHe could feel himself tighten, as if he were truly waiting for\nsomething. But there was nothing to wait for.\n\nWas there?\n\n\"Is there something wrong?\"\n\n\"Nothing. I'm fine.\"\n\n\"You look--\"\n\nShe never finished the sentence. The storm broke instead.\n\nDodd found himself weeping, twisting himself in the chair; reaching\nout with his hands, violently racked in spasms of grief: it seemed as\nif the room shook and he grasped nothing until she put her hands on\nhis shoulders. His eyes were blind with water, his body in a continual\nseries of spasms. He heard his own voice, making sounds that had never\nbeen words, crying for--for what? Help, peace, understanding?\n\nSomewhere his mind continued to think, but the thoughts were powerless\nand very small. He felt the girl's hands on his shoulders, trying to\nhold him, and masked by the sounds of his own weeping he heard her\nvoice, too:\n\n\"It's all right ... calm down now ... you'll be all right....\"\n\n\"... I ... can't....\" He managed to get two words out before the\nwhirlpool sucked him down again, the reasonless, causeless whirlpool of\ngrief and terror, his body shaking, his mouth wide open and calling in\nbroken sounds, the tears as hot as metal marking his face as his eyes\nsqueezed shut.\n\n\"It's all right,\" the voice went on saying. \"It's all right.\"\n\nAt last he was possessed by the idea that someone else might come\nand see them. He drew in a breath and choked on it, and the weeping\nbegan again, but after a time he was able to take one breath and then\nanother. He was able to stop. He reached into his pocket and found a\nhandkerchief, wiped his eyes and looked into her face.\n\nNothing was there but shock, and a great caution. \"What happened?\" she\nasked. \"Are you all right?\"\n\nHe took a long time answering, and the answer, because it was true,\nsurprised him. He was capable of surprise, he was capable of truth. \"I\ndon't know,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\nPART TWO\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n\"You will not tell me how to run my own division.\" The words were\nspaced, like steel rivets, evenly into the air. Dr. Haenlingen looked\naround the meeting-room, her face not even defiant but simply assured.\n\nWillis, of Labor, was the first to recover. \"It's not that we'd like to\ninterfere--\" he began.\n\nShe didn't let him finish. \"That's a lie.\" Her voice was not excited.\nIt carried the length of the room, and left no echoes.\n\n\"Now, Dr. Haenlingen--\" Rogier, Metals chairman and head of the\nmeeting, began.\n\n\"Don't soft-soap me,\" the old woman snapped. \"I'm too old for it and\nI'm too tough for it. I want to look at some facts, and I want you to\nlook at them, too.\" She paused, and nobody said a word. \"I want to\nstart with a simple statement. We're in trouble.\"\n\n\"That's exactly the point,\" Willis began in his thin, high voice. \"It's\nbecause we all appreciate that fact--\"\n\n\"That you want to tamper,\" the old woman said. \"Precisely.\" The\nothers were seated around the long gleaming table of native wood. Dr.\nHaenlingen stood, her back rigid, at one end, facing them all with a\ncold and knowing eye. \"But I won't allow tampering in my department. I\ncan't allow it.\"\n\nRogier took a deep breath. The words came like marshmallow out of\nhis overstuffed body. \"I would hardly call a request for information\n'tampering',\" he said.\n\n\"I would,\" Dr. Haenlingen told him tartly. \"I've had a very good\nreason, over the years, to keep information about my section in my own\nhands.\"\n\nRogier's voice became stern. \"And that is?\"\n\n\"That is,\" Dr. Haenlingen said, \"fools like you.\" Rogier opened\nhis mouth, but the old woman gave him no chance. \"People who think\npsychology is a game, or at any rate a study that applies only to\nother people, never to them. People who want to subject others to the\ndisciplines of psychology, but not themselves.\"\n\n\"As I understand it--\" Rogier began.\n\n\"You do not understand it,\" the old woman said flatly. \"I understand\nit because I have spent my life learning to do so. You have spent your\nlife learning to understand metals, and committees. Doubtless, Dr.\nRogier, you understand metals--and committees.\"\n\nHer glance swept once more round the table, and she sat down. There was\na second of silence before Dward, of Research, spoke up. Behind glassy\ncontact lenses his eyes were, as always, unreadable. \"Perhaps Dr.\nHaenlingen has a point,\" he said. \"I know I'd hate to have to lay out\nmy work for the meeting before I had it prepared. I'm sure we can allow\na reasonable time for preparation--\"\n\n\"I'm afraid we can't,\" Rogier put in, almost apologetically.\n\n\"Of course we can't,\" the old woman added. \"First of all, I wasn't\nasking for time for preparation. I was asking for non-interference.\nAnd, second, we don't have any time at all.\"\n\n\"Surely matters aren't that serious,\" Willis put in.\n\n\"Matters,\" the old woman said, \"are a good deal more serious than that.\nHas anyone but me read the latest reports from the Confederation?\"\n\n\"I think we all have,\" Rogier said calmly.\n\n\"Well, then,\" the old woman asked, \"has anyone except myself understood\nthem?\" The head turned, the eyes raked the table. \"Dr. Willis hasn't,\nor he wouldn't be sounding so hopeful. The rest of you haven't, or you\nwouldn't be talking about time. Rogier, you haven't, or you'd quit\ntrying to pry and begin trying to prepare.\"\n\n\"Preparations have begun,\" Rogier said. \"It's just for that reason that\nI want to get some idea of what your division--\"\n\n\"Preparations,\" she said. The word was like a curse. \"There's been a\nleak, and a bad leak. We may never know where it started. A ship's\nofficer, taking metals back, a stowaway, anything. That doesn't matter:\nanyone with any sense knew there had to be a leak sooner or later.\"\n\n\"We've taken every possible precaution,\" Willis said.\n\n\"Exactly,\" Dr. Haenlingen told him. \"And the leak happened. I take it\nthere's no argument about that--given the figures and reports we now\nhave?\"\n\nThere was silence.\n\n\"Very well,\" she went on. \"The Confederation is acting just as it has\nalways been obvious they would act: with idealism, stupidity and a\ngross lack of what is called common sense.\" She paused for comment:\nthere was none. \"Disregarding the fact that they need our shipments,\nand need them badly, they have begun to turn against us. Against what\nthey are pleased to call slavery.\"\n\n\"Well?\" Rogier asked. \"It is slavery, isn't it?\"\n\n\"What difference do labels make?\" she asked. \"In any case, they have\nturned against us. Public opinion is swinging heavily around, and there\nisn't much chance of pushing it back the other way. The man in the\nstreet is used to freedom. He likes it. He thinks the Alberts ought to\nbe free, too.\"\n\n\"But if they are,\" Willis said, \"the man in the street is going to lose\na lot of other things--things dependent on our shipments.\"\n\n\"I said they were illogical,\" Dr. Haenlingen told him patiently.\n\"Idealism almost always is. Logic has nothing to do with this--as\nanyone but a fool might know.\" She got up again, and began to walk\nback and forth along the end of the table. \"There are still people who\nare convinced, God knows why, that minds work on logic. Minds do not\nwork on anything resembling logic. The laws on which they do work are\nonly now beginning to be understood and codified: but logic was thrown\nout the window in the days of Freud. That, gentlemen, was a long time\nago. The man in the Confederation street is going to lose a lot if\nhe insists on freeing the Alberts. He hasn't thought of that yet, and\nhe won't think of it until after it happens.\" She paused, at one end\nof her walk, and put her hands on her hips. \"That man is suffering\nfrom a disease, if putting it that way makes it easier for you to see.\nThe disease is called idealism. Its main symptom is a disregard for\nconsequences in favor of principles.\"\n\n\"But surely--\" Willis began.\n\n\"Dr. Willis, you are outdoing yourself,\" the old woman cut in. \"You\nsound as if you are hopeful about idealism resting somewhere even in\nus. And perhaps it does, perhaps it does. It is a persistent virus. But\nI hope we can control its more massive outbreaks, gentlemen, and not\nattempt to convince ourselves that this disease is actually a state of\nhealth.\" She began to pace again. \"Idealism is a disease,\" she said.\n\"In epidemic proportions, it becomes incurable.\"\n\n\"Then there is nothing to be done?\" Dward asked.\n\n\"Dr. Rogier has his preparations,\" the old woman said. \"I'm sure they\nare as efficient as they can be. They are useless, but he knows that as\nwell as I do.\"\n\n\"Now wait a--\" Rogier began.\n\n\"Against ships of the Confederation, armed with God alone knows what\nafter better than one hundred years of progress? Don't be silly, Dr.\nRogier. Our preparations are better than nothing, perhaps, but not much\nbetter. They can't be.\"\n\nHaving reached her chair again, she sat down in it. The meeting was\nsilent for better than a minute. Dr. Rogier was the first to speak.\n\"But, don't you see,\" he said, \"that's just why we need to know what's\ngoing on in your division. Perhaps a weapon might be forged from the\narmory of psychology which--\"\n\n\"Before that metaphor becomes any more mixed,\" Dr. Haenlingen said, \"I\nwant to clear one thing up. I am not going to divulge any basic facts\nabout my division, now or ever.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"I want you to listen to me carefully,\" she said. \"The tools of\npsychology are both subtle and simple. Anyone can use a few of them.\nAnd anyone, in possession of only those few, will be tempted to put\nthem to use. That use is dangerous, more dangerous than a ticking bomb.\nI will not run the risk of such danger.\"\n\n\"Surely we are all responsible men--\" Rogier began.\n\n\"Given enough temptation,\" Dr. Haenlingen said, \"there is no such thing\nas a responsible man. If there were, none of us would be here, on\nFruyling's World. None of us would be masters, and none of the Alberts\nslaves.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I'll give you an example,\" she said after a little time. \"The Psych\ndivision has parties, parties which are rather well-known among other\ndivisions. The parties involve drinking and promiscuous sex, they get\nrather wild, but there is no great harm done by these activities.\nIndeed, they provide a useful, perhaps a necessary release.\" She\npaused. \"Therefore I have forbidden them.\"\n\nWillis said: \"What?\" The others waited.\n\n\"I have forbidden them,\" she said, \"but I have not stopped them. Nor\nwill I. The fact that they are forbidden adds a certain--spice to\nthe parties themselves. My 'discovery' of one of them does shake the\nparticipants up a trifle, but this is a minor damage: more important,\nit keeps alive the idea of 'forbidden fruit'. The parties are extremely\npopular. They are extremely useful. Were I to permit them, they would\nsoon be neither popular nor useful.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I don't quite see that,\" Dward put in.\n\nDr. Haenlingen nodded. For the first time, she put her arms on the\ntable and leaned a little forward. \"Many of the workers here,\" she\nsaid, \"are infected by the disease of idealism. The notion of slavery\nbothers them. They need to rebel against the establishment in order to\nmake that protest real to them, and in order to release hostility which\nmight otherwise destroy us from the inside. In my own division this has\nbeen solved simply by creating a situation in which the workers fear\nme--fear being a compound of love, or awe, and hatred. This, however,\nwill not do on a scale larger than one division: a dictatorship complex\nis set up, against which rebellion may still take place. Therefore, the\nparties. They serve as a harmless release for rebellious spirits. The\nparties are forbidden. Those who attend them are flouting authority.\nTheir tension fades. They become good workers, for us, instead of\nidealistic souls, against us.\"\n\n\"Interesting,\" Rogier said. \"May we take it that this is a sample of\nthe work you have been doing?\"\n\n\"You may,\" the old woman said flatly.\n\n\"And--about the current crisis--your suggestions--\"\n\n\"My suggestion, gentlemen, is simple,\" Dr. Haenlingen said. \"I can\nsee nothing except an Act of God which is going to stop the current\nConfederation movement against us. The leak has occurred: we are done\nfor if it affects governmental policy. My suggestion, gentlemen, is\njust this: pray.\"\n\nUnbelievingly, Willis echoed: \"Pray?\"\n\n\"To whatever God you believe in, gentlemen,\" Dr. Haenlingen said. \"To\nwhatever God permits you to remain masters on a slave world. Pray to\nhim--because nothing less than a God is going to stop the Confederation\nfrom attacking this planet.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n                          PUBLIC OPINION TWO\n\n    Being an excerpt from a conversation between Mrs. Fellacia Gordon,\n    (Citizen, white female, age thirty-eight, occupation housewife,\n    residence 701-45 West 305 Street, New York, U. S. A., Earth) and\n    Mrs. Gwen Brandon (Citizen, oriental female, age thirty-six,\n    occupation housewife, residence 701-21 West 313 Street, New York,\n    U. S. A., Earth) on a Minimart bench midway between the two homes,\n    in the year of the Confederation two hundred and ten, on May\n    sixteenth, afternoon.\n\nMRS. GORDON: They've all been talking about it, how those poor things\nhave to work and work until they drop, and they don't even get paid for\nit or anything.\n\nMRS. BRANDON: What do you mean, don't get paid? Of course they get\npaid. You have to get paid when you work, don't you?\n\nMRS. GORDON: Not those poor things. They're slaves.\n\nMRS. BRANDON: Slaves? Like in the olden times?\n\nMRS. G.: That's what they say. Everybody's talking about it.\n\nMRS. B.: Well. Why don't they do something about it, then, the ones\nthat are like that? I mean, there's always something you can do.\n\nMRS. G.: They're just being forced to work until they absolutely drop,\nis what I hear. And all for a bunch of people who just lord it over\nthem with guns and everything. You see, these beings--they're green,\nnot like us, but they have feelings, too--\n\nMRS. B.: Of course they do, Fellacia.\n\nMRS. G.: Well. They don't have much education, hardly know anything. So\nwhen people with guns come in, you see, there just isn't anything they\ncan do about it.\n\nMRS. B.: Why are they let, then?\n\nMRS. G.: Who, the people with guns? Well, nobody lets them, not just\nlike that. It's just like we only found out about it now.\n\nMRS. B.: I didn't hear a word on the news.\n\nMRS. G.: You listen tonight and you'll hear a word, Gwen dear.\n\nMRS. B.: Oh, my. That sounds like there's something up. Now, what have\nyou been doing?\n\nMRS. G.: Don't you think it's right, for these poor beings? I mean, no\npay and nothing at all but work, work, work until they absolutely drop?\n\nMRS. B.: What have you been doing? I mean, what can any one person do?\nOf course it's terrible and all that, but--\n\nMRS. G.: We talked it over. I mean the group I belong to, you know. On\nWednesday. Because all of us had heard something about it, you see, and\nso we brought it up and discussed it. And it's absolutely true.\n\nMRS. B.: How can you be sure of a thing like that?\n\nMRS. G.: We found out--\n\nMRS. B.: When it isn't even on the news or anything.\n\nMRS. G.: We found out that people have been talking from other places,\ntoo. Downtown and even in the suburbs.\n\nMRS. B.: Oh. Then it must be--but what can you do, after all? It's not\nas if we were in the government or anything.\n\nMRS. G.: Don't you worry about that. There's something you can do and\nit's not hard, either. And it has an effect. A definite effect, they\nsay.\n\nMRS. B.: You mean collecting money? To send them?\n\nMRS. G.: Money won't do them any good. No. What we need is the\ngovernment, to do something about this.\n\nMRS. B.: It's easy to talk.\n\nMRS. G.: And we can get the government to do something, too. If there\nare enough of us--and there will be.\n\nMRS. B.: I should think anybody who hears about these people, Fellacia--\n\nMRS. G.: Well, they're not people, exactly.\n\nMRS. B.: What difference does that make? They need help, don't they?\nAnd we can give them help. If you really have an idea?\n\nMRS. G.: We discussed it all. And we've been writing letters.\n\nMRS. B.: Letters? Just letters?\n\nMRS. G.: If a Senator gets enough letters, he has to do something,\ndoesn't he? Because the letters are from the people who vote for him,\nyou see?\n\nMRS. B.: But that means a lot of letters.\n\nMRS. G.: We've had everybody sending postcards. Fifteen or twenty each.\nThat mounts up awfully fast, Gwen dear.\n\nMRS. B.: But just postcards--\n\nMRS. G.: And telephone calls, where that's possible. And visits. And\nstarting even more talk everywhere. Just everywhere.\n\nMRS. B.: Do you really think it's going to work? I mean, it seems like\nso little.\n\nMRS. G.: It's going to work. It's got to.\n\nMRS. B.: What are they working at? I mean the--the slaves.\n\nMRS. G.: They're being forced, Gwen dear. Absolutely forced to work.\n\nMRS. B.: Yes, dear, but what at? What do they do?\n\nMRS. G.: I don't see where that makes any difference. Actually, nobody\nhas been very clear on the details. But the details don't matter, do\nthey, Gwen dear? The important thing is, we have to do something.\n\nMRS. B.: You're right, Fellacia. And I'll--\n\nMRS. G.: Of course I'm right.\n\nMRS. B.: I'll start right in with the postcards. A lot of them.\n\nMRS. G.: And don't forget to tell other people. As many as you can\nmanage. We need all the help we can get--and so do the slaves.\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nThe days passed and the training went on, boring and repetitious as\neach man tried to hammer into the obdurate head of an Albert just\nenough about his own particular section of machinery so that he could\nrun it capably and call for help in case of emergencies. And, though\nevery man on Fruyling's World disliked every moment of the job, the\njob was necessary, and went on: though they, too, were slaves to a\ngreat master, none thought of rebelling. For the name of the master was\nnecessity, and economic law, and from that rule there are no rebels.\nThe days passed evenly and the work went slowly on.\n\nAnd then the training was finished. The new Alberts went on a daily\nwork-schedule, supervised only by the spy-sets and an occasional,\ndeliberately random visit from a master. The visits were necessary,\ntoo: the Alberts had not the sophistication to react to a spy-set,\nand personal supervision was needed to convince them they were still\nbeing watched, they still had to work. A master came, a master saw them\nworking: that, they could understand.\n\nThat--and the punishments. These went under the name of discipline, and\nhad three grades. The Belbis beams administered all three, by means of\na slight readjustment in the ray. It was angled as widely as possible,\nand the dispersed beam, carefully controlled, acted directly on the\nnervous system.\n\nCadnan, troubled by Marvor's threats and by his own continuing\nthoughts of Dara, was a trifle absent-minded and a little slower than\nstandard. He drew punishment twice, both times in the first grade only.\nAlbin administered both punishments, explaining to his partner Derbis\nthat he didn't mind doing it--and, besides, someone had to.\n\nSometimes Dodd thought of Albin giving out discipline, and of all of\nhis life on Fruyling's World, in terms of a sign he had once seen. It\nhad been a joke, he remembered that clearly, but it was no more a joke\nnow than the words which flashed nearly ignored at the back of his\nmind. Once or twice he had imagined this new sign hanging luridly over\nthe entire planet, posted there in the name of profit, in the name of\nnecessity, in the name of economic law.\n\n                EVERYTHING NOT COMPULSORY IS FORBIDDEN\n\nThe Alberts had to be trained. The Alberts had to be disciplined. The\nmen had to work with them. The men were forbidden to leave the planet.\n\nAnd who were the slaves?\n\nThat, Dodd told himself cloudily, was far from an easy decision.\n\nEverything not compulsory was forbidden. Even the parties were\nforbidden ... though it was always possible to find one. Dodd had\navoided them completely, afraid now of another breakdown, this time in\npublic. He had not seen Greta or called her (though he had her number\nnow): he had stayed alone as much as possible.\n\nHe had no idea what had happened to him: and that added to his fright\nand to his fear of a recurrence.\n\nBut Albin, he knew, was having his fun, and so were others. The older\nmen, it seemed, devoted themselves to running the place, to raising\ntheir families and giving good advice, to keeping production up and\ncosts down.\n\nThe younger men had fun.\n\nDodd had thought of marriage. (Now, it was no more than a memory,\na hope he might once have had. Now, the end had come: there was no\nmarriage. There was no life. Only the idea of hope remained.) He had\nnever had the vestige of a real female image in his mind. Sometimes he\nhad told himself to be more out-going, to meet more women--but, then,\nhow did a man meet women?\n\nHe had fun.\n\nAnd Dodd had never enjoyed that particular brand of fun--Albin's brand.\n\nThere was a Social, an acceptable party that would get him into no\ntrouble, in Building One. Dodd felt like lying down and letting the day\ndrain out of him into the comforting mattress there in his room. He\nfelt like relaxing in his own company--and that, he saw suddenly, was\ngoing to mean drinking.\n\nHe could see the future unroll before him. He could see the first\ndrink, and the tenth. Because drink was an escape, and he needed some\nescape from the world he was pledged to uphold, the world of slavery.\n\nHe could not afford to drink again.\n\nSo, naturally, he was getting ready to go to the Social. Albin would\nbe there, undoubtedly, some of the older men would be there--and\na scattering of women would be there, too. (He remembered himself\nthinking, long ago before such a party: Tonight might be the night.) He\nshaved very carefully, faithful to memory, dressed in the best he could\nfind in his closet, and went out, heading for the elevator.\n\nTonight might be the night--but it made no difference, not any longer.\n\nThe trip to Sub-basement took a few whooshing seconds. He stepped out\ninto a lighted, oil-smelling underground corridor, took a deep breath\nand headed off through gleaming passages toward another elevator at\nthe far end. Before he reached it he took a turning, and then another:\nafter a magnificently confusing trip through an unmarked labyrinth, he\nfound the elevator that led him up into the right section of Building\nOne. That was no special feat, of course: people had been doing the\nlike ever since the first housing-project days, on pre-Confederation\nEarth. Dodd never gave it a second thought: his mind was busy.\n\nThe phrase had floated to the forefront of his brain again, right\nbehind his eyes, lighting up with a regularity that was almost\nsoothing, almost reassuring.\n\n_This is the end._\n\n_This is the end._\n\n_This is the end._\n\nWhen the elevator door slid open he was grim-faced, withdrawn, and he\nstepped out like a threat into a cheerful, brightly dressed crowd of\npeople.\n\n\"Here he is!\" someone shouted. \"I told you he'd be here ... I told\nyou....\" Dodd turned but the words weren't meant for him. Down the\ncorridor a knot of men and women was surrounding a new arrival from\nsomewhere else, laughing and talking. As he stepped forward, his eyes\nstill on that celebration, a pathway opened up for him; he was in sober\nblack and he went through the corridor like a pencil-mark down paper,\nleaving an open trail as he passed.\n\nA girl stopped him before he reached the door of the party room. She\nstepped directly into his path and he saw her, and his expression began\nto change, a little at a time, so that his eyes were, for long seconds,\nhappier than his face, and he looked like a young bull-terrier having a\nbirthday party.\n\n\"Am I in your way?\" the girl said, without budging an inch. She was\ndressed in a bright green material that seemed to fade so near the\nglowing happiness of her face. Her hair was brown, a quite ordinary\nbrown, and even in that first second Dodd noticed her hands. They were\nlong and slim, the thumbs pointed outward, and they were clasped at her\nbreast in a pose that should have been mocking, but was only pleasant.\n\nHe couldn't think of anything to say. Finally he settled on: \"My name's\nDodd,\" as the simplest and quickest way of breaking the ice that\nsurrounded him.\n\n\"Very well, then, Mr. Dodd,\" the girl said--she _wouldn't_ go along\nwith polite forms--\"am I in your way? Because if I am, I'm terribly\nsorry.\"\n\n\"You're not in my way at all,\" Dodd said heavily. \"I just--didn't\nnotice you.\" And that was a lie, but there was nothing else to say. The\nthousands of words that arranged themselves so neatly into patterns\nwhen he was alone had sunk to the very bottom of his suddenly leaden\nmind, almost burying the flashing sign. He felt as if he were growing\nextra fingers and ears.\n\n\"I noticed you,\" the girl said. \"And I said to myself, I said: 'What\ncan a person as grim as all that be doing at a Social as gay as all\nthis?' So I stopped you to see if I could find out.\"\n\nDodd licked his lips. \"I don't know,\" he said. \"I thought maybe I'd\nmeet somebody. I just thought I'd like to come.\"\n\n\"Well,\" the girl said, \"you've met somebody. And now what?\"\n\nDodd found some words, not many but enough. \"I haven't met you yet,\" he\nsaid in what he hoped was a bright tone. \"What's your name?\"\n\nThe girl smiled, and Dodd saw for the first time that she hadn't been\nsmiling before. Her face, in repose, was light enough and to spare;\nwhen she smiled, he wanted smoked glasses. \"Very well,\" she said. \"My\nname is Fredericks. Norma Fredericks. And yours is--\"\n\n\"Dodd,\" he said. \"John Dodd. They call me Johnny.\"\n\n\"All right, John,\" she said. \"You haven't been to many Socials, have\nyou? Because I'd have seen you--I'm at every one I can find time for.\nYou'd be surprised how many that is. Or maybe you wouldn't.\"\n\nThere was no answer to the last half of that, so Dodd backtracked,\nfeeling a shocking relief that she hadn't been to the party at which\nhe and the other girl (whose name he could very suddenly no longer\nremember) had made fools of themselves. He gave her an answer to the\nfirst half of her question. \"I haven't been to many Socials, no,\" he\nsaid. \"I--\" He shrugged and felt mountainous next to her. \"I stay by\nmyself, mostly,\" he said.\n\n\"And now you want to meet people,\" Norma said. \"All right, Johnny\nDodd--you're going to meet people!\" She took him by the arm and\nhalf-led, half-dragged him to the door of the party room. Inside, the\nnoise was like a blast of heat, and Dodd stepped involuntarily back.\n\"Now, that's no way to be,\" Norma said cheerfully, and piloted him\nsomehow inside, past a screaming crew of men and women with disposable\nglasses in their hands, past an oblivious couple, two couples, four,\nseven--past mountains and masses of color and noise and drink and\nsinging horribly off-key, not bothersome at all, loud and raucous\nand somehow, Dodd thought wildly, entirely fitting. This was Norma's\nelement, he told himself, and allowed her to escort him to a far corner\nof the room, where she sat him down in a chair, said: \"Don't go away,\ndon't move,\" and disappeared.\n\nDodd sat stock-still while the noise washed over him. People drifted by\nbut nobody so much as looked in his direction, and he saw neither Albin\nnor that other forgettable girl, for all of which he was profoundly\ngrateful. He hadn't been to a Social since his last mistake, and\nbefore that it had been--almost two years, he realized with wonder.\nHe'd forgotten just how much of everything it could be. He devoted a\ncouple of minutes to catching his breath, and then he just watched\npeople, drifting, standing, forming new combinations every second. He\nthought (once) he saw Albin in the middle of a crowd near the door,\nbut he told himself he was probably mistaken. There was no one else he\nrecognized. He didn't grow tired, but sitting and watching, he found,\nwas exhilarating enough.\n\nIn another minute, he was sure Norma wasn't going to come back.\nProbably she had found someone else, he told himself in what he thought\nwas a reasonable manner. After all, he wasn't a very exciting person:\nshe had probably started off to get him a drink or something, with the\nbest of intentions, and met someone more interesting on the way.\n\nHe had just decided that, after all, he couldn't really _blame_ her,\nwhen she appeared at his side.\n\n\"The punch,\" she announced, \"is authentic. It is totally authentic. One\nglass and you forget everything. Two, and you remember. Three--I don't\nknow what happens with the third glass yet. But I'm going to find out.\"\n\nHe looked at her hands. She was holding two disposable glasses, full\nof purple liquid. He took one from her and got up. \"Well,\" he said,\n\"cheers.\"\n\n\"Also down the hatch,\" she said. \"And any other last year's slang you\nhappen to have around and want to get rid of.\" She lifted the glass.\n\"Here's to you, John Dodd,\" she said, and tipped the glass at her\nlips--just that. He had never before seen anyone drink in just that\nway, or drink so quickly. In seconds, before he had taken a sip (he\nwas so amazed, watching her), the glass was empty. \"Whoosh,\" she said\nclearly. \"That ought to hold me for at least six minutes.\"\n\nThen she noticed that he hadn't started his own drink yet, so he took a\ncautious sip. It tasted like grape juice, like wine, like--he couldn't\nidentify the ingredients, and besides he was watching her face. He took\nanother sip.\n\n\"That's the way,\" Norma approved. \"Soon you'll be drinking with the big\nboys.\"\n\nAnd whether she was making fun of him or not hardly mattered. He felt\ncareless: maybe the drink had done it. \"Why did you pick me?\" he heard\nhimself say. \"Why did you stop me, out of all those people?\"\n\nShe hesitated, and when she spoke it sounded like the truth, perhaps\ntoo much like the truth to be true. \"You looked like a puppy,\" she said\nseriously. \"Like a puppy trying to act fierce. Maybe I've always had a\nweakness for dumb animals: no offense meant, John Dodd.\"\n\nThe idea of being offended hadn't occurred to him, but he tried it out\nexperimentally and discovered he didn't like it. Before he could say\nanything, though, Norma had become energetic again.\n\n\"Enough analysis,\" she said abruptly, so strongly that he wasn't sure\nwhat she meant by the words. \"Sit down--sit down.\" He felt for the\nchair behind him and sat. Norma cast a keen eye over the nearby crowds,\nspotted an empty chair and went off for it. \"Later,\" she told him, when\nshe had placed herself next to him, \"we can join the crowd. For now,\nlet's get--let's get better acquainted. Johnny.\"\n\n\"That's the first time you've called me Johnny,\" he said.\n\n\"So it is,\" she said. Her face was a mask: and then it lightened. \"What\ndo you work at, Johnny?\"\n\n\"I'm in Building Three,\" he said: it was easier to answer her than\nanatomize the confusions he felt. \"I work with smelting and quality\ncontrol--you know.\" He took another sip of his drink, and found to his\nsurprise that it was more than half gone.\n\n\"With the Alberts,\" she said. \"I know.\"\n\nHe thought he read her look correctly. \"I don't like it either,\" he\ntold her earnestly. \"But somebody has to do it. I think--\"\n\n\"You don't have to get defensive,\" Norma said. \"Relax. Enjoy yourself.\nJoin the party. Did I look at you as if you were a murderer of small\nchildren?\"\n\n\"I just--don't like it,\" he said carefully. \"I--well, there isn't\nanything I can do about it, is there?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't know,\" she said, and then (had she made a decision? He\ncouldn't tell) she went on: \"I'm in Psych, myself.\"\n\n\"Psych? You?\"\n\n\"Psych, me,\" she said. \"So I'm every bit as responsible as you are. And\nmaybe the reason there's nothing to do is--is because it's already been\ndone.\"\n\n\"Already been done?\" Dodd swallowed the rest of his drink in one gulp\nand leaned toward her. Norma looked down at her own empty glass.\n\n\"There are rumors,\" she said. \"Frankly, I'd rather they didn't get\naround. And if I hadn't had too much to drink--or something--I wouldn't\neven be mentioning them. I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"No,\" he said, surprising himself. \"Tell me. What rumors?\"\n\nNorma kept her eyes on her glass. \"Nothing,\" she said, in a new,\nstrained voice.\n\nDodd remained in the same position, feeling more tense than he could\never remember having felt. \"Tell me,\" he said. \"Come on. If you've gone\nthis far--\"\n\n\"I suppose I have,\" she said. \"I suppose I've gone too far now, haven't\nI?\"\n\n\"You've got to tell me.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"It's--they say the Confederation knows. I mean knows\nwhat we're doing here. Officially. Everything.\" She dropped the glass\nthen and Dodd stooped ridiculously to pick it up: it lay between their\nchairs. He felt the blood rushing to his head. There was pounding in\nhis temples. He got the glass and gave it to her but she took it\nabsently, as if she hardly noticed him. \"Of course, it's just a rumor,\"\nshe said in a low voice.\n\n\"The people know,\" Dodd said. \"It's out. It's all out. About the\nslavery. Is that what you mean?\"\n\nShe nodded. \"I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"But it's important--\" he began, and stopped. He looked at his glass,\nstill empty. He took a breath, began again. \"I work with them. I'm part\nof it. It's important to me.\"\n\n\"Just as important to me,\" Norma said. \"Believe me, Johnny. I'm\nresponsible, too.\"\n\n\"But you're in Psych,\" he said. \"That's--morale. Nothing more than\nmorale, as far as I know--\"\n\nShe raised her head and looked him full in the face, her eyes like a\nbright challenge. Her face was quite sober when she spoke. \"I'm in\nPsych, but it's more than morale, Johnny. We're--always thinking up new\nways to keep the little Alberts in their place. Put it that way. Though\nnobody's really come up with an improvement on the original notion.\"\n\n\"The original notion?\"\n\nNow her smile gave light and no heat, a freak of nature. \"The original\nspecific,\" she said. She paused for a second and the mockery in her\nvoice grew more broad. \"That old-time religion,\" she said, drawing the\nwords out like fine, hot wire. \"That old-time religion, Johnny Dodd.\"\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\nThe work went on, for Cadnan as well as for the masters. Days passed\nand he began to improve slightly: he received no further discipline,\nand he was beginning to settle into a routine. Only thoughts of Dara\ndisturbed him--those, and the presence of Marvor, who was still\napparently waiting to make good his incomprehensible threat.\n\nMarvor had said he was going to leave, but he still appeared every\nevening in the same room. Cadnan had hardly dared to question him, for\nfear of being drawn into the plan, whatever it was: he could only wait\nand watch and wish for someone to talk to. But, of course, there was no\none.\n\nAnd then, one day during the first part of his working shift, a master\ncame into the room, the very master who had gone with Cadnan through\nhis training. \"You're Cadnan?\" he asked.\n\nCadnan said: \"I am Cadnan.\"\n\nThe master beckoned through the open door of Cadnan's working-room, and\ntwo more masters appeared, strange ones, leading between them an elder.\nThe elder, Cadnan saw at once, had lived through many matings: the\ngreen skin of his arms was turning to silver, and his eye was no longer\nbright, but dulling fast with age. He looked at the working-room and at\nthe young Albert with blank caution.\n\n\"This one is called Gornom,\" the master said. \"He'll be with you when\nyou work. He's going to help you work--you can teach him all he has to\nknow. Just make sure you don't let him handle the buttons until we\ngive you the word. All right?\"\n\nCadnan understood. \"All right,\" he said, and the three masters left the\nroom without more words. The door shut behind them and Gornom visibly\nrelaxed. Yet there was still wariness behind the old eye. \"I work in\nthe field,\" he said after a second. \"I am good worker in the field.\"\n\nCadnan knew from gossip about the field: that was the place where the\nmetal lay. Alberts worked there, digging it up and bringing it to the\nbuildings where Cadnan and many like him took over the job. He nodded\nslowly, bending his body from the waist instead of from the neck like\nthe masters, or Marvor. \"If you are in the field,\" he said, \"why do you\ncome here? This is not a place for diggers.\"\n\n\"I am brought here,\" Gornom said. \"I am an elder many times. What the\nmasters say, I do. Now they say I come here, and I come.\"\n\nCadnan looked doubtful. \"You are to work with me?\"\n\n\"So the masters say.\" That was unanswerable, and Cadnan accepted it.\nHe flicked a glance at the TV screen which showed him the smelting\nprocess, and leaped for the buttons. After a few minutes of action he\nwas finished: there was a slight breathing-space.\n\n\"I am to tell you what to do,\" he said.\n\nGornom looked grave. \"I see what it is you do,\" he said. \"It is a\nlesson. When you act for the masters, the great machines obey you.\"\n\n\"It is true,\" Cadnan said.\n\n\"This is the lesson,\" Gornom said slowly, as if it were truly\nimportant. \"We are shown the machines so that we may learn to be like\nthe machines. When the master tells us what to do, we are to do it.\nThere is nothing else.\"\n\nCadnan thought about that. It made sense: it made a structure he could\nunderstand, and it made the world a less confusing place. \"You have\nsaid a truth,\" he judged at last.\n\n\"It is one of many truths,\" Gornom said. And that was an invitation,\nCadnan recognized. He hesitated no more than a second.\n\n\"Where may I learn the others?\" But Gornom didn't answer, and Cadnan's\nbreathing-space was over. He had to be back at the board, pushing\nbuttons, watching carefully. Gornom stood behind him, peering over his\nshoulder with a cloudy eye. Neither said a word until the new spell of\nwork was over. Then Cadnan repeated his question.\n\n\"It is not for all,\" Gornom said distantly. \"One must be chosen.\"\n\n\"You have come to me,\" Cadnan said. \"You have been sent to me. Is this\nwhat you call chosen?\"\n\nIt was the right answer, perhaps the only right answer. Gornom\npretended to consider the matter for a minute, but his mind was already\nmade up. \"We are above you, on the floor over yours,\" he said. \"When\nour work is finished I will take you there.\"\n\nCadnan imagined a parade of new truths, a store of knowledge that would\nlay all his questions to rest and leave him, as after a meal, entirely\nsatisfied. He went back to work and contemplated the first of the\ntruths: he was to be like the machine. He promised himself he would try\nto imitate the machine, doing only what the masters ordered. And for\nthe rest of that day, indeed, life seemed to make perfect calming sense.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut, after all, Gornom was only an elder and not a master. He could be\nwrong.\n\nThe doubt appeared at the end of the day, but by then Gornom had the\nyounger Albert in tow. They took the elevator up one flight and went\nto Gornom's room: the novelty of all of this excited Cadnan so that\nhe nearly forgot his new doubts. They shrank perceptibly without\ndisappearing altogether.\n\nGornom opened the door of the new room. Inside, Cadnan saw six elders,\nsitting in a circle on the floor. The circle, incomplete, was open\ntoward the door, and all six big eyes were staring at the newcomers.\nThe floor was nearly bare: the leaves had been brushed into mounds that\nlay in the corners.\n\nWithout a word, Gornom sat in the circle and motioned Cadnan to a place\nbeside him. Moving slowly and uncertainly, Cadnan came forward and sat\ndown. There was a second of absolute silence.\n\nOne of the other elders said: \"You bring a new one to us?\"\n\n\"I bring a new one,\" Gornom said.\n\nThe other elder, leaning forward from the waist, peered at Cadnan. His\neye was larger than normal, and glittering cold. Cadnan, awestruck,\nneither spoke nor moved, and the elder regarded him for a time and then\nsaid abruptly: \"Not all are called to the truth.\"\n\n\"He has been called,\" Gornom said. \"He has been chosen.\"\n\n\"How is he chosen?\"\n\nGornom explained. When he had finished, a silence thick as velvet\ndescended upon the room. Then, very suddenly, all the elders spoke at\nonce.\n\n\"May the masters live forever.\"\n\nCadnan, by this time, was nearly paralyzed with fright. He sat very\nstill. The elders continued, in a slow, leaden chorus:\n\n\"May the masters live forever.\n\n\"May the words live forever.\n\n\"May the lessons live forever.\n\n\"May the truths live forever.\"\n\nThen the velvet silence came down again, but the words rang through it\nfaintly until Gornom broke the spell with speech.\n\n\"The young one has come to learn. He has come to know the truths.\" He\nlooked around at the others and then went on: \"His name is Cadnan. He\nwishes to have your names. Let him have your names.\"\n\nThe elder who had spoken first identified himself as Lonak. The others\ngave their names in order: Dalor, Puna, Grudoc, Burlog, Montun. Cadnan\nstared with fascinated eyes at Puna, who was older than anyone he had\never seen. His skin was nearly all white, and in the dim room it seemed\nto have a faint shine. His voice was very high and thin, like a wind\nsighing in tall tree-branches. Cadnan shivered, but didn't take his eye\nfrom Puna until, as if at a signal, all the elders rose. Awkwardly,\nthen, Cadnan rose with them, again confused and still frightened.\n\nHe saw Gornom raise his hands over his head and chant: \"Tall are the\nmasters.\"\n\nAll the others repeated the words.\n\n\"Wise are the masters.\"\n\nCadnan, this time, repeated the phrase with the elders.\n\n\"Good are the masters.\"\n\nWhen the antiphon had been delivered Gornom waited a full second and\nthen fell prostrate to the floor. The others followed his example,\nexcept for Cadnan, who, afraid to let himself fall on bare metal,\ncrouched down slowly instead.\n\n\"Weak are the slaves,\" Gornom whispered.\n\nThe answer was a whisper, too.\n\n\"Small are the slaves.\"\n\nThe others whispered.\n\n\"They are like small ones all the days of their lives, and only the\nmasters are elders.\"\n\n\"The masters are elders.\"\n\n\"As the machine obeys,\" Gornom said, \"so the slave obeys. As the tree\nobeys, so the slave obeys. As the metal obeys, so the slave obeys. As\nthe ground obeys, so the slave obeys.\"\n\n\"So the slave obeys.\"\n\nThen there was silence again, not as profound as before. Through it,\nCadnan could hear the others whispering, but he couldn't quite catch\ntheir words. He was later told what praying was, though he never had a\nchance to practice it.\n\nAnd then everyone returned to the original circle, and squatted. In\nwhat was almost a normal tone Gornom said: \"Here is our new one. He\nmust be told.\"\n\nPuna himself rose. \"I will tell him.\" And Cadnan, frightened by the\nvery look of the elder, could do nothing but follow him as he beckoned\nand went to a corner near a mound of leaves. The others, scattered,\nwere eating. Cadnan picked up a leaf, but Puna took it gently out of\nhis hand.\n\n\"We do not eat until it is over,\" he said quietly.\n\nCadnan accepted this without words, and Puna told him the legend.\nDuring the entire tale, Cadnan, stock-still, didn't even think of\ninterrupting. At first his attention wandered to the leaves, but as\nPuna's voice went on he listened more and more closely, and even his\nfright began to leave him under the legend's fascination.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Long ago, the masters come to the world, sent by the Great Elder. We\nare no more than children. We do not work, we do nothing except eat and\nsleep and live out our lives in the world. The Great Elder makes us the\ngift of talking and the gift of trees, and he makes the rules of the\ntrees.\n\n\"Then he does nothing more for us. First we must become more than\nchildren, more than small ones.\n\n\"For this he sends the masters.\n\n\"The masters are good because they show us work and give us machines\nthat have power. Our power is over the masters because of the machines.\nBut we may not use such power. They are elder to us: they are wiser\nthan we are. Only when we become so wise we use power against them,\nand in that day master and slave are one. In that day the Great Elder\nreturns to his small ones.\n\n\"In this time there is the work, and the work makes us always more\nlike the masters. We live in the buildings like masters. We work with\nmachines like masters. We do what the masters say. Soon we are all the\nsame.\n\n\"No one can tell when we are like masters in all things. We know of it\nwhen the Great Elder returns to us. All must watch and wait for that\nday. In this time, we only remember and tell ourselves the truths over\nand over. There are many truths and some I can not speak. Here are the\nothers:\n\n\"The masters are our elders.\n\n\"The machines are under obedience to us while we obey the masters.\n\n\"The Great Elder wishes our obedience to the masters.\n\n\"If we disobey the masters the machines and the trees will not obey us,\nand there will be no more work and no small ones. For this is the order\nof the world: some obeying and some to be obeyed. It is visible and\nplain. When the chain is broken all the chain breaks.\"\n\nPuna paused, and then repeated the last sentence.\n\n\"When the chain is broken all the chain breaks.\"\n\n\"It is true,\" Cadnan said excitedly. \"It is true. Yet there is more\ntruth--\"\n\n\"There is,\" Puna said soberly. \"We meet again in five days' time. I can\ncount five days, and so the others will know, and you will know. At\nthis next meeting you will be told more truths.\" His smile was thin and\ndistant. \"Now eat.\"\n\nCadnan reached numbly for a leaf and, without thinking, began to\nnibble. The world had been set in order: he had no more questions now.\nInstead, he felt empty spaces, waiting to be filled with the great\nknowledge of Puna and of Gornom and all the others, at the next meeting.\n\nAnd at other meetings, after that....\n\nHe put that thought away: it was too much and too large. The one\ncertain thing was that in five days' time (whenever that was) he would\nknow more. In five days they would all meet again.\n\nHe hoped five days was not too long.\n\nAs matters turned out, of course, he need not have worried. The meeting\nhe was waiting for never happened.\n\nAnd, after that, there were no more meetings at all.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n                         PUBLIC OPINION THREE\n\n    Being excerpts from memo directives sent between executives of\n    Associated Metallic Products, Ltd., a corporation having its main\n    offices within Dome Two, Luna City, Luna, and associated offices on\n    all three inhabited planets, the memo directives being dated\n    between May fourteenth and May twenty-first, in the Year of the\n    Confederation two hundred and ten.\n\nTO: John Harrison\n\nFROM: Fredk.

By next year the entire situation may\nhave changed.\n\nI'm asking for your support, then, as a matter of practical politics.\nIn a risky matter like this one, support can make all the difference\nbetween....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTO: James Oliver Gogarty\n\nFROM: John Harrison\n\nRE: My memo May 19\n\nJ. O., I mean it.\n\nNow lay off.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTO: Williston Reed\n\nFROM: John Harrison\n\nRE: Current memo series\n\nAs you know, I'm keeping you up to date whenever I have a minute\nbetween appointments: a publicity chief ought to know everything,\ninside as well as public-issue material, if only so he can be conscious\nof what to hide. I've tried to work with you as well as I can, and if\nthere are delays in reporting, you'll understand that pressure of other\nduties....\n\n... The story behind all of this is simple enough. The takeover Gogarty\nand Ramsbotham have been trying to pull is interfering with practical\nbusiness. Frankly, AMP'S competitors are happy enough to jump in and\nstir the pot: I think they've been buying up Senators here and there\n(for which there is, God knows, enough precedent; the entire Senate\nhasn't been bought since the Dedrick mutiny forty years back but you\ndon't _need_ the entire Senate if you have a few key men, and I've\nalways thought Dedrick's lawyers were wasteful), and beyond what the\ncompetition's been active in, there are always the fanatics. Freedom\nfor all--you know the sort of thing.\n\nNow the big danger is that if R. and G. succeed in keeping things\nmessed up the rest of the metals boys will step in, push the government\ninto the right moves, and kill Fruyling's World deader than Dedrick\nhimself. Which (according to the statistical breakdown) won't put us\ninto the bankruptcy courts, but will slide us from a first-or-second\nspot to a ninth-or-tenth one. The big question is whether you'd rather\nbe a small frog in a big puddle or the reverse. Me, I'd rather be a big\nfrog in a big puddle than any other combination I can think of, and in\nspite of everything I think I'm going to go on being just that.\n\nFruyling's World has been around for a long time, but the current AMP\nfight gives the competition the opportunity they need, and they're\npushing it. If we can weather the storm....\n\nWell, I'm being gloomy. Of course we can weather the storm. I'll swing\nGogarty back, and that will leave Ramsbotham nowhere to go....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTO: John Harrison\n\nFROM: Fredk. Ramsbotham\n\nRE: Fruyling's World\n\n...

Mr. Harrison stated that he\ndisagreed with the particular stand taken by Mr. Ramsbotham in this\nmatter, but sympathized with his strong feelings of duty toward the\nshareholders of the concern.\n\nConfederation response was reported to be \"immediate and strong\" by\nsources high in the government, but as yet no final word has been\nreceived regarding what action, if any, is contemplated....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTO: Fredk.

I'm through. I think\nyou are, too--whether you know it or not just yet.\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n\"That old-time religion.\"\n\nDodd heard the words echoing in his mind that night, and the next\nnight, and the next. All that she had said:\n\n\"We set up a nice pie-in-the-sky sort of thing, all according to the\nbest theory, just the thing to keep the Alberts happy and satisfied and\nworking hard for us. It started right after the first setup here, and\nby now I guess the Alberts think they invented it all by themselves, or\ntheir Great Elder came down from a tree and told them.\"\n\n\"It's horrible,\" he had said.\n\n\"Of course it is.\" There was a silence. \"But you said it yourself: what\ncan we do? We're here and we're stuck here.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\nNorma didn't want to argue, but the argument went on in Dodd's mind,\nand it still continued, circling in his mind like a buzzard. There\nwas nothing he could do about it, nothing Norma could do about it. He\navoided even the thought of seeing her for a few days, and then he\nfound himself making an excuse to go over to Building One. He met her\nthere, after lounging about for hours.\n\nAnd what she had disclosed to him, what they spoke of, made no\ndifference that he could see in what he felt.\n\nHe was happy. Slowly he realized that he had hardly ever been happy\nbefore.\n\nHe even forgot, for a time, about the rumors, the threat of\nConfederation troops that had hung over her words like a gray cloud:\nall he could think of was Norma, and the terrible thing in which they\nwere both bound up.\n\nHe told himself grimly that it would never have bothered Albin, for\ninstance. Albin would have had his fun with Norma, and that would have\nbeen that.\n\nBut it bothered Johnny Dodd.\n\nHe was still worrying over it, and in spite of himself finding\nhappiness, when the escape came, and the end.\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\n\"There's nothing to be done about it.\" Dr. Haenlingen delivered the\nwords and sat down rigidly behind her desk. Norma nodded, very slowly.\n\n\"I know that,\" she said. \"I started out--I started to do just what you\nwanted. To talk to him, draw him out, find out just what he did feel\nand what he planned.\"\n\n\"And then something happened,\" Dr. Haenlingen said tightly. \"I know.\"\n\nNorma paced to the window and looked out, but the day was gray: she saw\nonly her own reflection. \"Something happened,\" she murmured. \"I--guess\nI had too much to drink. I wanted to talk.\"\n\n\"So I understand,\" Dr. Haenlingen said. \"And you talked. And--whatever\nhis situation--you managed to increase his tension rather than\nunderstand or lessen it.\"\n\nNorma shook her head at the reflection. \"I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"I have often found,\" Dr. Haenlingen said, \"that sorrow following an\naction is worse than useless. It usually implies a request to commit\nthe same action again.\"\n\n\"But I wouldn't--\" Norma said, turning, and then stopped before the\ncalm gaze of the old woman.\n\n\"No?\" Dr. Haenlingen said.\n\n\"I'll try to--\"\n\nDr. Haenlingen lifted a hand and brushed the words aside. \"It doesn't\nmatter,\" she said. \"I am beginning to see that it doesn't matter.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"All we can do now is wait,\" Dr. Haenlingen said. \"We are--outplayed.\"\n\nThere was a little silence. Norma waited through it without moving.\n\n\"Would you like to have a lesson in psychology?\" Dr. Haenlingen said\nin the graying room. \"Would you like to learn a little, just a little,\nabout your fellow man?\"\n\nNorma felt suddenly frightened. \"What's wrong?\"\n\n\"Nothing is wrong,\" Dr. Haenlingen said. \"Everything is moving along\nexactly as might have been predicted. If we had known what the\nConfederation planned, and exactly the timetable of their actions ...\nbut we did not, and could not. Norma, listen to me.\"\n\nThe story she told was very simple. It took a fairly long time to tell.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSlavery takes a toll of the slaves (as the Confederation was beginning\nto find out, as the idealists, the do-gooders, were beginning, however\nslowly to realize). But it takes a toll of the masters, too.\n\nThe masters can't quite rid themselves of the idea that beings which\nreact so much like people may really (in spite of everything, in spite\nof appearance, in spite of laws and regulations and social practices)\nbe people, after all, in everything but name and training.\n\nAnd it just wouldn't be right to treat _people_ that way....\n\nSlaves feel pain. In simple reciprocity, masters feel guilt.\n\nAnd because (according to the society, and the laws, and the\nappearances, and the regulations) there was no need for guilt, the\nmasters of Fruyling's World had, like masters anywhere and any time,\nburied the guilt, hidden it even from themselves, forbidden its\nexistence and forgotten to mention it to their thoughts.\n\nBut the guilt remained, and the guilt demanded.\n\nPunishment was needed.\n\n\"They're going to fight,\" Dr. Haenlingen said. \"When the Confederation\nattacks, they're going to fight back. It's senseless: even if we\nwon, the Confederation fleet could blockade us, prevent us getting a\nshipment out, bottle us up and starve us for good. But they don't need\nsense, they need motive, which is quite a different thing. They're\ngoing to fight--both because they need the punishment of a really good\nlicking, and because fighting is one more way for them to deny their\nguilt.\"\n\n\"It seems complex,\" Norma said.\n\n\"Everything is complex,\" Dr. Haenlingen said, \"as soon as human beings\nengage in it. The action is simple enough: warfare.\"\n\n\"We've got to stop them--\"\n\nDr. Haenlingen went on as if she hadn't heard. \"The action serves two\ndifferent, indeed two contradictory purposes. If you think that's\nsomething rare in the actions of mankind, you must be more naive than\nyou have any right to be.\"\n\n\"We've got to stop them,\" Norma said again. \"Got to. They'll die--we'll\nall die.\"\n\n\"There is nothing to do,\" Dr. Haenlingen said. \"We are outplayed--by\nthe Confederation, by our own selves. We are outplayed: there are no\nmoves left. There is nothing I can offer, nothing anyone can offer,\nquite as attractive as the double gift of punishment and denial.\"\nShockingly, for the first time, the old woman sounded tired. Her voice\nwas thin in the gray room. \"Nothing we can do, Norma. You're dismissed:\ngo back to work.\"\n\n\"But you can't just give up--you can show them there aren't any real\nreasons, show them they're not being rational--\"\n\n\"Oh, but they'll be rational,\" Dr. Haenlingen said in the same still\nvoice. \"Wait for the rumors to start, Norma. Wait for them to begin\ntelling each other that the Confederation is going to kill them all\nanyhow, take them back and hang them as war criminals--\"\n\n\"That's ridiculous!\"\n\n\"Perhaps.\"\n\n\"Then--\"\n\n\"Rumors during a war are almost always ridiculous. That fact makes\nno difference at all. They'll be believed--because they have to be\nbelieved.\"\n\nNorma thought. \"We can start counter-rumors.\"\n\n\"Which would not be believed. They offer nothing, nothing that these\npeople want. Oh, yes, people can be changed--\" Dr. Haenlingen paused.\n\"Given sufficient time and sufficient equipment, it is possible to make\nanyone into anything, anything at all. But to change these people, to\nmake them act as we want--the time required is more than ten years,\nNorma. And we haven't got ten years.\"\n\n\"We've got to try,\" Norma said earnestly.\n\n\"What we have got,\" Dr. Haenlingen said, \"is more like ten days.\nAnd there is nothing to do in ten days. The people have spoken.\nVox populi....\" The eyes closed. There was a silence Norma waited,\nastonished, horrified. \"Perhaps it is necessary,\" Dr. Haenlingen's\nvoice said. \"Perhaps ... we must wait. _Ich kann nicht anders...._\"\n\n\"What?\" Norma asked.\n\n\"Martin Luther,\" Dr. Haenlingen's voice said, remote and thin. \"It\nmeans: 'I can do nothing else.' He wrote it as his justification for\na course of action that was going to get him excommunicated, perhaps\nkilled.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\nDr. Haenlingen said nothing, did nothing. The body sat behind its desk\nin the gray room. Norma stared, then turned and fled.\n\n\n\n\n14\n\n\nThe mixture of feelings inside Cadnan was entirely new to him, and\nhe couldn't control it very well. He found himself shaking without\nmeaning to, and was unable to stop himself. There was relief, first of\nall, that it was all over, that he no longer had to worry about what\nMarvor might have planned, or whether Marvor were going to involve\nhim. There was fright, seeing anyone carry through such a foolhardy,\nalmost impious idea in the teeth of the masters. And there was simple\ndisappointment, the disappointment of a novice theologue who has seen\nhis pet heretic slip the net and go free.\n\nFor Cadnan had tried, earnestly, night after night, to convert Marvor\nto the new truths the elders had shown him. They were luminously\nobvious to Cadnan, and they set the world in beautiful order; but,\nsomehow, he couldn't get through to Marvor at all, couldn't express\nthe ideas he had well enough or convincingly enough to let Marvor see\nhow beautiful and true all of them really were. For a time, in fact,\nhe told himself with bitterness that Marvor's escape had really been\nall his own fault. If he'd only had more talks with Marvor, he thought\ncloudily, or if he'd only been able to speak more convincingly....\n\nBut regret is part of a subjunctive vocabulary. At least one writer\nhas noted that the subjunctive is the mark of civilization. This may\nbe true: it seems true: in Cadnan's case, at any rate, it certainly\nwas true. Uncivilized, he spent little time in subjunctive moods.\nAll that he had done, all that Marvor had done, was open to him, and\nhe remembered it often--but, once the bad first minutes were past, he\nremembered everything with less and less regret. The mixture, as it\nstood, was heady enough for Cadnan's untrained emotions.\n\nHe had tried to talk to Marvor about the truths, of course. Marvor,\nthough, had been obstinately indifferent. Nothing made any impression\non his hardened, stubborn mind. And now he was gone.\n\nDara had the news first. She came into their common room at the end of\nthe day, very excited, her hands still moving as if she were turning\nhandles in the refinery even after the close of work. Cadnan, still\nfeeling an attraction for her, and perceiving now that something had\ndisturbed her, stayed where he was squatting. Attraction for Dara, and\nhelp given to her, might lead to mating, and mating was against the\nrule. But Dara came to him.\n\n\"Do you know what happens with Marvor?\" she said. Her voice, always\nquiet, was still as sweet to Cadnan as it had ever been. \"He is gone,\nand the masters do not know where.\"\n\nThe mixture of emotions began: surprise and relief first, then regret\nand disappointment, then fear, all boiling and bubbling inside him like\na witch's stew. He spoke without thinking: \"He is gone to break the\nchain of obedience. He is gone to find others who think as he thinks.\"\n\n\"He is escaped,\" Dara said. \"It is the word the masters use, when they\nspeak of this.\"\n\n\"It happens before now,\" Cadnan told her. \"There are others, whom he\njoins.\"\n\nDara shut her eye. \"It is true. But I know what happens when there is\nan escape. In the place where my work is, there is one from Great Bend\nTree. She tells me of what happens.\"\n\nDara fell silent and Cadnan watched her nervously. But he had no chance\nto speak: she began again, convulsively.\n\n\"When this other escapes it is from a room of Great Bend Tree.\"\nCadnan nodded: he and Dara were of Bent Line Tree, and hence in a\ndifferent room. The segregation, simple for the masters, was handy and\nunimportant, and so it was used. Cadnan thought it natural: every tree\nhad its own room.\n\n\"Do they find the one who escapes?\" he asked.\n\n\"They find him. The masters come in and they punish the others from the\nroom.\"\n\nPrecedent was clearly recognizable, even though it made no sense.\nThose who had not escaped surely had no reason to be punished, Cadnan\nthought. But what the masters had done to Great Bend Tree they would do\nto Bent Line Tree.\n\nEveryone would be punished.\n\nWith a shock he realized that \"everyone\" included Dara.\n\nHe heard himself speak. \"You must go.\"\n\nDara looked at him innocently. \"Go?\" she said.\n\n\"You must go as Marvor has gone. The masters do not take you for\npunishment if you go.\"\n\n\"There is nothing for me to do,\" she said, and her eye closed. \"No. I\nwait for you, but only to tell you this: there is nothing I can do.\"\n\n\"Marvor is gone,\" Cadnan said slowly. \"You, too, can go. Maybe the\nmasters do not find you. If you stay you are punished. If you go and\nthey do not find you there is no punishment for you.\" It amazed him\nthat she could not see so clear a point.\n\n\"Then all can go,\" she said. \"All can escape punishment.\"\n\nCadnan grunted, thinking that over. \"Where one goes,\" he said at last,\n\"one can go. Maybe many can not go.\"\n\nHer answer was swift. \"And you?\"\n\n\"I stay here,\" he said, trying to sound as decisive as possible.\n\nDara turned away. \"I do not listen to your words,\" she said flatly. \"I\ndo not hear you or see you.\"\n\nCadnan hissed in anguish. She had to understand.... \"What do I say that\nis wrong? You must--\"\n\n\"You speak of my going alone,\" she said. \"But that is me, and no more.\nWhat of the others?\"\n\n\"Marvor,\" Cadnan said after a second. \"He is to come and aid them. He\ntells me this. We join him and come back with him, away from here, to\nwhere he stays now. Then none of us are punished.\" He paused. \"It will\nbe a great punishment.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Dara said. \"Yet one does not go alone.\"\n\nHer voice was so low that Cadnan could barely hear it, but the words\nwere like sharp stones, stabbing fear into his body. For the first\ntime, he saw clearly exactly what she was driving at. And after a long\npause, she spoke again.\n\n\"Where one goes, two may go. Where Marvor goes, two may follow, one to\nlead the other.\"\n\n\"One goes alone,\" Cadnan said, feeling himself tremble and trying to\ncontrol it. \"You must go.\"\n\nIt seemed a long time before she spoke again, and Cadnan held himself\ntightly, until his muscles began to ache.\n\n\"We go together,\" she said at last \"Two go where one has gone. Only so\ndo I leave at all.\"\n\nIt was an ultimatum, and Cadnan understood what was behind it. But an\nattraction between Dara and himself ... he said: \"There is the rule of\nthe tree,\" but it was like casting water on steel.\n\n\"If we leave here,\" Dara said, \"why think of a smaller rule?\"\n\nCadnan tried to find words, but there were no words. She had won,\nand he knew it. He could not let Dara stay behind to draw a great\npunishment, possibly even to die, to be no more Dara. And there was no\nway of forcing her to go and escape that fate--no way except to go with\nher.\n\n\"We must wait until they sleep,\" Dara said in a sudden return to\npracticality. \"Then we go.\"\n\nCadnan looked around at the huddled, vaguely stirring forms of his\ncompanions. Fear was joined by a sort of sickness he had never known\nbefore. He was a slave, and that was good--but once outside where\nwould he find work, or food, or a master? Where there was no master,\nCadnan told himself, there was no slave: he was nothing, nameless,\nnon-existent.\n\nBut there was neither word nor action for him now. He tried once more\nto argue but his words were parried with a calm tenacity that left\nno room for discussion. In the end he was ready to do what he had to\ndo--had to do in order, simply, to save Dara. There was no other\nreason: he needed none.\n\nHe had heard of the attraction of male for female, though some did not\nexperience it until the true time of mating. He had not until that\nmoment known how strong the attraction could be.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe waiting, though it seemed like positive days, didn't take long. The\nothers in the room fell asleep, by habit, one by one, and soon Dara and\nCadnan were the only ones left awake. Neither was tempted to sleep:\ntheir own terror and their decision kept them very effectively alert.\n\nCadnan said: \"If the masters see us?\"\n\nDara turned on him a face that seemed completely calm. \"They do not see\nus,\" she said flatly. \"Now do not speak.\"\n\nThey rose and, silently, went to the door. The door opened just as\nquietly, and shut once again behind them.\n\nThe corridor was filled with watching eyes, Cadnan felt: but there were\nno masters in evidence. They stood for a second, waiting, and then Dara\nstarted down toward the big room at the end, her feet silent on the\nfloor, and Cadnan followed her.\n\nNo masters were visible. There should have been guards, but the guards\nmight have been anywhere: one escape had hardly served to alert a lazy,\nuninterested group who performed their duties out of no more than\nhabit. Wherever the guards were resting, they were not in the corridor:\neverything went smoothly. It was smoother than Cadnan was willing to\nbelieve.\n\nSoon, though, they were actually in the great lobby of the building.\nIt, too, was dark and empty. They stood dwarfed by the place, the\ngigantic doors that led to freedom no more than a few feet away.\n\nCadnan kept telling himself that where Marvor had gone he, too, could\ngo. But Marvor had had a plan, and Cadnan had none.\n\nYet they were safe--so far, so far. They walked toward the door now,\na step at a time. Each step seemed to take an hour, a full day. Dara\nwalked ahead, straight and tall: Cadnan caught up with her, and she put\nout her hand. There was no more than an instant of hesitation. He took\nthe hand.\n\nThat pledged them to each other, until the time of mating. But what was\none more law now?\n\nAnother step. Another.\n\nCadnan, in the silence, was suddenly tempted to make a noise, any sort\nof noise--but it seemed impossible to create sound. The quiet dimness\nwrapped him like a blanket. He took another step.\n\nMating, he thought. If the chain of obedience was broken would the\ntrees refuse to obey, in their turn? Puna had said so, and it was true.\nAnd if the trees refused to obey there would be no mating....\n\nYet Dara would be safe. That was the important thing. One thing at a\ntime.\n\nAnother step.\n\nAnd then, at last, the door.\n\nCadnan pushed at it, and it opened--and then there was sound, plenty of\nsound, more sound than he could have imagined, sound to fill the great\nlobby, to fill the entire building with rocking, trembling agonies of\nnoise!\n\nThere was an alarm-bell, to be exact, an alarm-buzzer, combinations and\nsolo cadenzas. The guards were, after all, no more than dressing: the\nautomatic machinery never slept, and it responded beautifully and with\nenthusiasm.\n\nCadnan and Dara ran crazily out into the darkness. The building fell\nbehind them and the jungle was ahead: still they ran, but Cadnan felt\nthe ground, bumpy instead of smooth, and stumbled once, nearly falling.\nHe saw Dara ahead of him. Getting up and beginning again was automatic:\npanic beat at him. The noise grew and grew. His feet moved, his heart\nthudded....\n\nAnd then the lights went on.\n\nAutomatic sweep searchlights were keyed in. The machinery continued to\nrespond.\n\nCadnan found himself suddenly struck blind: ahead of him, Dara made a\nsingle, lonely, terrified sound that overrode all the alarms.\n\nCadnan tried to shout: \"We must run! In the dark the masters cannot\nsee--\"\n\nBut, of course, by then it was too late to move.\n\nThe masters were all around them.\n\nThe escape was over.\n\n\n\n\n15\n\n\nOf course there was Norma, Dodd told himself.\n\nThere was Norma to make everything worth-while--except that Norma\nneeded something, too, and he couldn't provide it. No one could provide\nit, not as long as no one was allowed off-planet. And it was quite\ncertain, Dodd told himself gloomily, that the restrictions that had\nbeen in force yesterday were going to look like freedom and carefree\njoy compared with the ones going into effect tomorrow, or next week.\n\nIf, of course, there was going to be a tomorrow ... that, he thought,\nwas always in doubt. He managed sometimes to find a sort of illusory\npeace in thinking of himself as dead, scattered into component atoms,\nfinished, forever unconscious, no longer wanting anything, no longer\nseeing the blinking words in his mind. Somewhere in his brain a small\ngerm stirred redly against the prospect, but he tried to ignore it:\nthat was no more than brute self-preservation, incapable of reasoning.\nThat was no more than human nature.\n\nAnd human nature, he knew with terror, was about to be overthrown once\nmore.\n\nIt was only human, after all, to find the cheapest way to do necessary\nwork. It was only human to want the profits high and the costs low.\nIt was only human to look on other races as congenitally inferior, as\nless-than-man in any possible sense, as materials, in fact, to be used.\n\nThat was certainly human: centuries of bloody experience proved it.\nBut the Confederation didn't want to recognize human nature. The\nConfederation didn't like slavery.\n\nThe rumor he'd heard from Norma was barely rumor any more: instead, it\nhad become the next thing to an officially announced fact. Everyone\nknew it, even if next to no one spoke of it. The Confederation was\ngoing to send ships--had probably sent ships already. There was going\nto be a war.\n\nThe very word \"war\" roused that red spark of self-preservation. It was\nharder, Dodd had found, to live with hope than to live without it: it\nwas always possible to become resigned to a given state of affairs--but\nnot if you kept thinking matters would improve. So he stamped on the\nspark, kept it down, ignored it. You had to accept things, and go on\nfrom there.\n\nIt was too bad Norma didn't know that.\n\nHe'd tried to tell her, of course. They'd even been talking, over in\nBuilding One, on the very night of the near-escape. He'd explained it\nall very clearly and lucidly, without passion (since he had cut himself\noff from hope he found he had very few passions of any kind left, and\nthat made it easy); but she hadn't been convinced.\n\n\"As long as there's a fighting chance to live, I want to live,\" she'd\nsaid. \"As long as there's any chance at all--the same as you.\"\n\n\"I know what I want,\" he told her grimly.\n\n\"What?\" she asked, and smiled. \"Do you like what you're doing? Do you\nlike what I'm doing--what the whole arrangement is here?\"\n\nHe shrugged. \"You know I don't.\"\n\n\"Then get out of it,\" she said, still smiling. \"You can, you know.\nIt's easy. All you have to do is stop living--just like that! No more\ntrouble.\"\n\n\"Don't be sil--\"\n\n\"It can be done,\" she went on flatly. \"There are hundreds of ways.\"\nThen the smile again. \"But you'd rather live, Johnny. You'd rather\nlive, even this way, being a slaver, than put an end to it and to\nyourself.\"\n\nHe paused. \"It's not the same thing.\"\n\n\"No,\" she said. \"This way, you'd have to do the killing yourself. When\nthe ships come, you can let them do it for you, just sit and wait for\nsomeone to kill you. Like a cataleptic. But you won't, Johnny.\"\n\n\"I will,\" he said.\n\nShe shook her head, the smile remaining. Her voice was quiet and calm,\nbut there was a feeling of strain in it: there was strain everywhere,\nnow. Everyone looked at the sky, and saw nothing: everyone listened for\nthe sound of engines, and there were no engines to hear. \"Catalepsy\nis a kind of death, Johnny. And you'll have to inflict that much on\nyourself. You won't do it.\"\n\n\"You think I--\" He stopped and swallowed. \"You think I like living this\nway, don't you?\"\n\n\"I think you like living,\" Norma said. \"I think we all do, no matter\nhow rough it gets. No matter how it grates on the nerves, or the flesh,\nof the supersensitive conscience. And I know how you feel, Johnny, I\ndo--I--\" She stopped very suddenly.\n\nHe heard his voice say: \"I love you.\"\n\nThere was a silence.\n\n\"Johnny,\" she said, and her hands reached out for him blindly. He saw,\nincredibly, tears like jewels at the corners of her eyes. \"Johnny--\"\n\nIt was at that moment that the alarm-bell rang. It was heard only\nfaintly in Building One, but that didn't matter. Dodd knew the\ndirection, and the sound. He turned to go, for a second no more than a\nmachine.\n\nNorma's voice said: \"Escape?\"\n\nHe came back to her. \"I--the alarm tripped off. This time they must\nhave tried it through the front door, or a window. The last one must\nhave tunnelled through--\"\n\nHe had to leave her. Instead he stood silently for a second. She said\nnothing.\n\n\"There are spots the steel's never covered,\" he said. \"You can tunnel\nthrough if you're lucky.\" A pause. \"I--\"\n\n\"It's all right, Johnny,\" she said.\n\n\"Norma--\"\n\n\"It's all right I understand. It's all right.\"\n\nHer voice. He hung on to it as he turned and walked away, found the\nelevator, started away from the room, the Building where she was,\nstarted off to do his duty.\n\nHis duty as a slaver.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe night was long, so long it could have been the night before the end\nof the world, the universe drawing one last deep breath before blowing\nout the candles and returning, at last, to peace and darkness and\nsilence. Dodd spent it posted as one of the guards around the two cells\nwhere the Alberts were penned.\n\nHe had plenty of time to think.\n\nAnd, in spite of Norma, in spite of everything, he was still sure of\none thing. Because he was a slaver, because he acted, still, as a\nslaver and a master, hated by the Confederation, hated by the Alberts,\nhated by that small part of himself which had somehow stayed clean of\nthe foulness of his work and his life, because of all that....\n\nIt was going to be very easy to die.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n                          PUBLIC OPINION FOUR\n\n    Being an excerpt from a directive issued by the Executive and his\n    Private Council, elected and confirmed by the Confederation, and\n    upheld by majority vote of the Senate: the directive preserved in\n    Confederation Archives, and signed under date of May 21 in the year\n    two hundred and ten of the Confederation.\n\n... It is therefore directed that sufficient ships be fitted out\nwith all modern armaments, said fitting to be in the best judgment\nof the competent and assigned authorities, and dispatched without\ndelay toward the planet known as Fruyling's World, both to subdue any\narmed resistance to Confederation policy, and to affirm the status of\nFruyling's World as a Protectorate of the Confederation, subject to\nConfederation policy and Confederation judgment.\n\nAn act of this nature cannot be undertaken without grave thought and\nconsideration. We affirm that such consideration has been given to this\nstep.\n\nIt is needless to have fear as to the outcome of this action. No\nisolated world can stand against, not only the might, but the moral\njudgment of the Confederation. Arms can be used only as a last resort,\nbut times will come in the history of peoples when they must be so\nused, when no other argument is sufficient to force one party to cease\nand desist from immoral and unbearable practices.\n\nIn accordance with the laws of the Confederation, no weapons shall be\nused which destroy planetary mass.\n\nIn general, Our efforts are directed toward as little blood-shed\nas possible. Our aim is to free the unfortunate native beings of\nFruyling's World, and then to begin a campaign of re-education.\n\nThe fate of the human beings who have enslaved these natives shall be\nleft to the Confederation Courts, which are competent to deal in such\nmatters by statute of the year forty-seven of the Confederation. We\npledge that We shall not interfere with such dealings by the Courts.\n\nWe may further reassure the peoples of the Confederation that no\nfurther special efforts on their part will be called for. This is not\nto be thought of as a war or even as a campaign, but merely as one\nisolated, regretted but necessary blow at a system which cannot but be\na shock to the mind of civilized man.\n\nThat blow must be delivered, as We have been advised by Our\nCouncillors. It shall be delivered.\n\nThe ships, leaving as directed, will approach Fruyling's World, leaving\nthe FTL embodiments and re-entering the world-line, within ten days.\nFull reports will be available within one month.\n\nIn giving this directive, We have been mindful of the future status of\nany alien beings on worlds yet to be discovered. We hereby determine,\nfor ourselves and our successors, that nowhere within reach of the\nConfederation may slavery exist, under any circumstances. The heritage\nof freedom which We have protected, and which belongs to all peoples,\nmust be shared by all peoples everywhere, and to that end we direct Our\nactions, and Our prayers.\n\nGiven under date of May 21, in the year two hundred and ten of the\nConfederation, to be distributed and published everywhere within the\nConfederation, under Our hand and seal:\n\n    Richard Germont\n    by Grace of God Executive\n    of the Confederation\n    together with\n    His Council in judgment assembled\n    all members subscribing thereto.\n\n\n\n\n16\n\n\nThe room had no windows.\n\nThere was an air-conditioning duct, but Cadnan did not know what such\na thing was, nor would he have understood without lengthy and tiresome\nexplanations. He didn't know he needed air to live: he knew only that\nthe room was dark and that he was alone, boxed in, frightened. He\nguessed that somewhere, in another such room, Dara was waiting, just as\nfrightened as he was, and that guess made him feel worse.\n\nSomehow, he told himself, he would have to escape. Somehow he would\nhave to get to Dara and save her from the punishment, so that she did\nnot feel pain. It was wrong for Dara to feel pain.\n\nBut there was no way of escape. He had crept along the walls, pushing\nwith his whole body in hopes of some opening. But the walls were metal\nand he could not push through metal. He could, in fact, do nothing\nat all except sit and wait for the punishment he knew was coming. He\nwas sure, now, that it would be the great punishment, that he and\nDara would be dead and no more. And perhaps, for his disobedience, he\ndeserved death.\n\nBut Dara could not die.\n\nHe heard himself say her name, but his voice sounded strange and he\nbarely recognized it. It seemed to be blotted up by the darkness. And\nafter that, for a long time, he said nothing at all.\n\nHe thought suddenly of old Gornom, and of Puna. They had said there\nwas an obedience in all things. The slaves obeyed, the masters obeyed,\nthe trees obeyed. And, possibly, the chain of obedience, if not\nalready broken by Marvor's escape and what he and Dara had tried to\ndo, extended also to the walls of his dark room. For a long time he\nconsidered what that might mean.\n\nIf the walls obeyed, he might be able to tell them to go. They would\nmove and he could leave and find Dara. Since it would not be for\nhimself but for Dara, such a command might not count as an escape: the\nchain of obedience might work for him.\n\nThis complicated chain of reasoning occupied him for an agonized time\nbefore he finally determined to put it to the test. But, when he did,\nthe walls did not move. The door, which he tried as soon as it occurred\nto him to do so, didn't move either. With a land of terror he told\nhimself that the chain of obedience had been broken.\n\nThat thought was too terrible for him to contemplate for long, and\nhe began to change it, little by little, in his mind. Perhaps (for\ninstance) the chain was only broken for him and for Marvor: perhaps it\nstill worked as well as ever for all those who still obeyed the rules.\nThat was better: it kept the world whole, and sane, and reasonable. But\nalong with it came the picture of Gornom, watching small Cadnan sadly.\nCadnan felt a weight press down on him, and grow, and grow.\n\nHe tried the walls and the door again, almost mechanically. He felt his\nway around the room. There was nothing he could do. But that idea would\nnot stay in his mind: there had to be something, and he had to find\nit. In a few seconds, he told himself, he would find it. He tried the\nwalls again. He was beginning to shiver. In a few seconds, only a few\nseconds, he would find the way, and then....\n\nThe door opened, and he whirled and stared at it. The sudden light\nhurt his eye, but he closed it for no more than a second. As soon as\nhe could he opened it again, and stood, too unsure of himself to move,\nwatching the master framed in the doorway. It was the one who was\ncalled Dodd.\n\nDodd stared back for what seemed a long time. Cadnan said nothing,\nwaiting and wondering.\n\n\"It's all right,\" the master said at last. \"You don't have to be\nafraid, Cadnan. I'm not going to hurt you.\" He looked sadly at the\nslave, but Cadnan ignored the look: there was no room in him for more\nguilt.\n\n\"I am not afraid,\" he said. He thought of going past Dodd to find Dara,\nbut perhaps Dodd had come to bring him to her. Perhaps Dodd knew where\nshe was. He questioned the master with Dara's name.\n\n\"The female?\" Dodd asked. \"She's all right. She's in another room, just\nlike this one. A solitary room.\"\n\nCadnan shook his head. \"She must not stay there.\"\n\n\"You don't have to worry,\" Dodd said. \"Nobody's doing anything to her.\nNot right now, anyhow. I--not right now.\"\n\n\"She must escape,\" Cadnan said, and Dodd's sadness appeared to grow. He\npushed at the air as if he were trying to move it all away.\n\n\"She can't.\" His hands fell to his sides. \"Neither can you, Cadnan.\nI'm--look, there's a guard stationed right down the corridor, watching\nthis door every second I'm here. There are electronic networks in the\ndoor itself, so that if you manage somehow to open it there'll be an\nalarm.\" He paused, and began again, more slowly. \"If you go past me,\nor if you get the door open, the noise will start again. You won't get\nfifteen feet.\"\n\nCadnan understood some of the speech, and ignored the rest: it wasn't\nimportant. Only one thing was important: \"She can not die.\"\n\nDodd shook his head. \"I'm sorry,\" he said flatly. \"There's nothing\nI can do.\" A silence fell and, after a time, he broke it. \"Cadnan,\nyou've really messed things up. I know you're right--anybody knows it.\nSlavery--slavery is--well, look, whatever it is, the trouble is it's\nnecessary. Here and now. Without you, without your people, we couldn't\nlast on this world. We need you, Cadnan, whether it's right or not: and\nthat has to come first.\"\n\nCadnan frowned. \"I do not understand,\" he said.\n\n\"Doesn't matter,\" Dodd told him. \"I can understand how you feel. We've\ntreated you--pretty badly, I guess. Pretty badly.\" He looked away with\nwhat seemed nervousness. But there was nothing to see outside the door,\nnothing but the corridor light that spilled in and framed him.\n\n\"No,\" Cadnan said earnestly, still puzzled. \"Masters are good. It is\ntrue. Masters are always good.\"\n\n\"You don't have to be afraid of me,\" Dodd said, still looking away.\n\"Nothing I could do could hurt you now--even if I wanted to hurt you.\nAnd I don't, Cadnan. You know I don't.\"\n\n\"I am not afraid,\" Cadnan said. \"I speak the truth, no more. Masters\nare good: it is a great truth.\"\n\nDodd turned to face him. \"But you tried to escape.\"\n\nCadnan nodded. \"Dara can not die,\" he said in a reasonable tone. \"She\nwould not go without me.\"\n\n\"Die?\" Dodd asked, and then: \"Oh. I see. The other--\"\n\nThere was a long silence. Cadnan watched Dodd calmly. Dodd had turned\nagain to stare out into the hallway, his hands nervously moving at his\nsides. Cadnan thought again of going past him, but then Dodd turned and\nspoke, his head low.\n\n\"I've got to tell you,\" he said. \"I came here--I don't know why, but\nmaybe I just came to tell you what's happening.\"\n\nCadnan nodded. \"Tell me,\" he said, very calmly.\n\nDodd said: \"I--\" and then stopped. He reached for the door, held it\nfor a second without closing it, and then, briefly, shook his head.\n\"You're going to die,\" he said in an even, almost inhuman tone. \"You're\nboth going to die. For trying to escape. And the whole of your--clan,\nor family, or whatever that is--they're going to die with you. All\nof them.\" It was coming out in a single rush: Dodd's eyes fluttered\nclosed. \"It's my fault. It's our fault. We did it. We....\"\n\nAnd the rush stopped. Cadnan waited for a second, but there was no\nmore. \"Dara is not to die,\" he said.\n\nDodd sighed heavily, his eyes still closed. \"I'm--sorry,\" he said\nslowly. \"It's a silly thing to say: I'm sorry. I wish there was\nsomething I could do.\" He paused. \"But there isn't. I wish--never\nmind. It doesn't matter. But you understand, don't you? You understand?\"\n\nCadnan had room for only one thought, the most daring of his entire\nlife. \"You must get Dara away.\"\n\n\"I can't,\" Dodd said, unmoving.\n\nCadnan peered at him, half-fearfully. \"You are a master.\" One did not\ngive orders to masters, or argue with them.\n\nBut Dodd did not reach for punishment. \"I can't,\" he said again. \"If I\nhelp Dara, it's the jungle for me, or worse. And I can't live there. I\nneed what's here. It's a matter of--a matter of necessity. Understand?\"\nHis eyes opened, bright and blind. \"It's a matter of necessity,\" he\nsaid. \"It has to be that way, and that's all.\"\n\nCadnan stared at him for a long second. He thought of Dara, thought of\nthe punishment to come. The master had said there was nothing to do:\nbut that thought was insupportable. There had to be something. There\nhad to be a way....\n\nThere was a way.\n\nShouting: \"Dara!\" he found himself in the corridor, somehow having\npushed past Dodd. He stood, turning, and saw another master with a\npunishment tube. Everything was still: there was no time for anything\nto move in.\n\nHe never knew if the tube had done it, or if Dodd had hit him from\nbehind. Very suddenly, he knew nothing at all, and the world was blank,\nblack, and distant. If time passed he knew nothing about it.\n\nWhen he woke again he was alone again: he was back in the dark and\nsolitary room.\n\n\n\n\n17\n\n\nThe office was dim now, at evening, but the figure behind the desk was\nrigid and unchanging, and the voice as singular as ever. \"Do what you\nwill,\" Dr. Haenlingen said. \"I have always viewed love as the final\naberration: it is the trap which lies in wait for the unwary sane. But\nno aberration is important, any more....\"\n\n\"I'm trying to help him--\" Norma began.\n\n\"You can't help him, child,\" Dr. Haenlingen said. Her eyes were closed:\nshe looked as if she were preparing, at last, for death. \"You feel too\nclosely for him: you can't see him clearly enough to know what help he\nneeds.\"\n\n\"But I've got to--\"\n\n\"Nothing is predicated on necessity but action,\" Dr. Haenlingen said.\n\"Certainly not success.\"\n\nNorma went to the desk, leaned over it, looking down into the still,\nblank face. \"It's too soon to give up,\" she said tensely. \"You're just\nbacking down, and there's no need for that yet--\"\n\n\"You think not?\" The face was still.\n\n\"There are lots of rumors, that's true,\" Norma said. \"But--even if the\nworst comes to the worst--we have time. They aren't here yet. We can\nprepare--\"\n\n\"Of course,\" the voice said. \"We can prepare--as I am doing. There is\nnothing else for us, not any more. Idealism has taken over, and what we\nare and what we've done can go right on down the drain. Norma, you're\na bright girl--\"\n\n\"Too bright to sit around and do nothing!\"\n\n\"But you don't understand this. Maybe you will, some day. Maybe I'll\nhave a chance--but that's for later. Not now.\"\n\nNorma almost reached forward to shake some sense into the old woman.\nBut she was Dr. Haenlingen, after all--\n\nNorma's hand drew back again. \"You can't just sit back and wait for\nthem to come!\"\n\n\"There is nothing else to do.\" The words were flat, echoless.\n\n\"Besides,\" Norma said desperately, \"they're only rumors--\"\n\nShe never finished her sentence. The blast rocked the room, and the\nwindow thrummed, steadied and then suddenly tinkled into pieces on the\ncarpeted floor.\n\nNorma was standing erect. \"What's that?\"\n\nDr. Haenlingen had barely moved. The eyes, in dimness, were open now.\n\"That, my dear,\" the old woman said, \"was your rumor.\"\n\n\"My--\"\n\nThe blast was repeated. Ornaments on the desk rattled, a picture came\noff the far wall and thudded to the carpet. The air was filled with a\nfine dust and, far below, Norma could hear noise, a babel of voices....\n\n\"They're here!\" she screamed.\n\nDr. Haenlingen sat very still, saying nothing. The eyes watched, but\nthe voice made no comment. The hands were still, flat on the desk.\nBelow, the voices continued: and then Dr. Haenlingen spoke.\n\n\"You'd better go,\" the calm voice said. \"There will be others needing\nhelp--and you will be safer underground, in any case.\"\n\n\"But you--\" Norma began.\n\n\"I may be lucky,\" Dr. Haenlingen said. \"One of their bombs may actually\nkill me.\"\n\nHer mouth open in an unreasoning accession of horror, Norma turned and\nfled. The third blast rattled the corridor as she ran crazily along it.\n\n\n\n\n18\n\n\nDodd stayed on his post because he had to: as a matter of fact, he\nhardly thought of leaving, or of doing anything at all. Minutes passed,\nand he stood in the hallway, quite alone. The other guard had spoken to\nhim when Cadnan had been picked up and tossed back into solitary, but\nDodd hadn't answered, and the guard had gone back to his own post. Dodd\nstood, hardly thinking, and waiting--though he could not have said what\nfor.\n\n_This is the end._ He had hit Cadnan: in those few seconds he had acted\njust as a good slaver was supposed to act. And that discovery shocked\nhim: even more than his response during the attempted escape, it showed\nhim what he had become.\n\nHe had thought the words he used had some meaning. Now he knew they had\nnext to none: they were only catch-phrases, meant to make him feel a\nlittle better. He was a slaver, he had been trained as a slaver, and he\nwould remain a slaver. What was it Norma had said?\n\n\"You'd rather live....\"\n\nIt was true, it was all true. But there was (he told himself dimly)\nstill, somewhere, hope: the Confederation would come. When they did, he\nwould die. He would die at last. And death was good, death was what he\nwanted....\n\nNo matter what Norma had told him, death was what he wanted.\n\nHe was still standing, those few thoughts expanding and filling his\nmind like water in a sponge, when the building, quite without warning,\nshook itself.\n\nHe heard the guard at the end of the corridor shouting. The building\nshook again, underneath and around him, dancing for a second like a man\nhaving a fit. Then he caught the first sounds of the bombardment.\n\n\"Norma!\" He heard himself scream that one word over the sounds of blast\nand shout, and then he was out of the corridor, somehow, insanely,\nrunning across open ground. Behind him the alarms attached to the front\ndoors of Building Three went off, but he hardly heard that slight\naddition to the uproar. God alone knew whether the elevators would be\nworking ... but they had to be, they had to stand up. After he found\nBuilding One (he could hardly trust the basement levels, choked by\npanic-stricken personnel from everywhere) he had to get an elevator and\nfind Norma.... He had to find Norma.\n\nOverhead there was a flash and a dull roar. Dodd stared before him at\na tangled, smoking mass of blackness. A second before, it had been a\nfringe of forest. Smoke coiled round toward him and he turned and ran\nfor the side of Building Three. There were other sounds behind him,\nscreams, shouts....\n\nAs he passed the Building the ground shook again and there was a\nsudden rise in the chorus of screams. He smelled acrid smoke, but\nnever thought of stopping: the Building still stood gleaming in the\nbombardment flashes, and he went round the corner, behind it, and found\nhimself facing the dark masses of One and Two, five hundred feet away\nover open ground.\n\nAs he watched there was a flash too bright for his eyes: he blinked and\nturned away, gasping. When he could look again a piece of Building Two\nwas gone--looking, from five hundred feet distance, as if it had been\nbitten cleanly from the top, taking about four floors from the right\nside, taking the topmast, girders, and all ... simply gone.\n\nBut that was Building Two, not Building One. Norma was still safe.\n\nShe had to be safe. He heaved in a breath of smoky air, and ran.\n\nBehind him, around him, the bombardment continued.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n                          PUBLIC OPINION FIVE\n\n    Being an excerpt from Chapter Seven of _A Fourth Grade Reader in\n    Confederation History_, by Dr. A. Lindell Jones, with the\n    assistance of Mary Beth Wilkinson, published in New York, U. S. A.,\n    Earth in September of the year one hundred and ninety-nine of the\n    Confederation and approved for use in the public schools by the\n    Board of Education (United) of the U. S. A., Earth, in January of\n    the year two hundred of the Confederation.\n\n... The first explorers on Fruyling's World named the new planet after\nthe heroic captain of their ship, and prepared long reports on the\nplanet for the scientists back home in the Confederation. The reports\nmentioned large metallic deposits, and this rapidly became important\nnews.\n\nThe metallic deposits were badly needed by the Confederation for making\nmany of the things which still are found in your homes: such useful\nobjects as cleaners, whirlostats and such all require metal from\nFruyling's World.\n\nOf course, there were not many explorers on the new planet, and it was\na hard job for them to dig out the metal the Confederation needed.\n\nBut the planet had natives on it already. The natives were called\nAlberts, and here is a picture of them. Aren't they funny-looking?\n\nThe Alberts were happy to help with the digging in exchange for some of\nthe good things the explorers talked about, because they didn't have\nmany good things. But the explorers built houses for them and gave them\nfood and taught them English, and the Alberts dug in the ground and\nhelped get the metal ready to ship back to the Confederation.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n... The following list of Review Questions may be helpful to the\ninstructor:\n\n1. Why is Fruyling's World called by that name? After whom was it named?\n\n2. What is so valuable about Fruyling's World?\n\n3. Who helps the explorers dig up the metal?\n\n4. Why do they help?\n\n\n\n\n19\n\n\nFor Cadnan, the time passed slowly.\n\nConsciousness came back, along with a thudding ache in the head and a\ngrowing hunger: but there were no leaves on the smooth metal of the\nfloor, and the demands of his body had to be ignored. His mind began to\ndrift: once he heard a voice, but when he told himself that the voice\nwas not real, it went away. He found his hands moving as if he were\npushing the buttons of his job. He stopped them and in a second they\nwere moving again.\n\nThen the room itself began to shake.\n\nCadnan had no doubts of his sanity: this was different from the\nimaginary voice. The room shook again and he wondered whether this were\nsome new sort of punishment. But it did not hurt him.\n\nThe rumbling sound of the bombardment came to him only dimly, and for\nbrief seconds. To Cadnan, it sounded like a great machine, and he\nwondered about that, too, but he could find no answers.\n\nThe rumbling came again, and sounded nearer. Cadnan thought of machines\nshaking his small room, perhaps making it hot as the machines made\nmetal hot. If that happened, he knew, he would die.\n\nHe called: \"Dara.\" It was hard to hear his own voice. There was no\nanswer, and he had expected none: but he had had to call.\n\nThe rumbling came again. Surely, he told himself, this was a new\npunishment, and it was death.\n\nThere was only one thing for him to do. He sat crosslegged on the\nsmooth floor as the rumble and the other sounds continued, and in\nopposition to them he made his song, chanting in a loud and even voice.\nHe had learned that a song was to be made when facing death: he had\nlearned that in the birth huts, and he did not question it.\n\nThe song was necessary, and his voice, carrying over the sounds that\nfiltered through to him, was clear and strong.\n\n    \"I am Cadnan,\n    I am Cadnan of Bent Line Tree,\n    I work for the masters,\n    I push buttons and the machine obeys me,\n    I push buttons when the masters say to do it.\n    My song is short. I am near the dead.\n    I have broken the chain, the chain of obedience.\n    I do not want to break this chain.\n    I must break it. Dara says I go.\n    If I do not go then Dara does not go.\n    Dara must go. I break the chain.\n    For this I am near the dead and the room shakes.\n    It is my death and my song.\n    I am Cadnan and Bent Line Tree and I work.\"\n\nAfter the song was over, he remained sitting, waiting for what had to\ncome. The rumbling continued, and the room shook more strongly. For\nsome seconds he waited, and then he was standing erect, because he\ncould see.\n\nThe door, sprung from its lock by the shaking of the building, had\nfallen a little open. As Cadnan watched, it opened a bit more, and he\nwent and pushed at it. Under a very light shove, it swung fully open,\nand the corridor, lights flickering down its length, stood visible. As\nCadnan peered out, the lights blinked off, and then came on again.\n\nThe rumbling was very loud now, but he saw no machines. He went into\nthe corridor in a kind of curious daze: there were no masters anywhere,\nnone to watch or hurt him. He called once more for Dara, but now he\ncould not hear himself at all: the rumbling was only one of the sounds\nthat battered at him dizzily. There were bells and buzzes, shrieks and\ncascades of brutal, grinding sounds more powerful than could be made by\nany machine Cadnan could imagine.\n\nHe started down the corridor: the masters had taken Dara in that\ndirection, opposite to his own. Suddenly, one of his own kind stood\nbefore him, and he recognized a female, Hortat, through the dusty air.\nHortat was staring at him with a frozen expression in her eye.\n\n\"What is it?\" she asked. \"What happens?\"\n\nCadnan, without brutality, brushed her aside. \"I do not know. The\nmasters know. Wait and they tell you.\" He did not consider whether\nthe statement were true, or false, or perhaps (under these new\ncircumstances) entirely meaningless: it was a noise he had to make in\norder to get Hortat out of his way. She stood against the corridor wall\nas he passed, watching him.\n\nHe went on past her, moving faster now, into the central room from\nwhich corridors radiated. The lights went off again and then came on:\nhe peered round but there were no masters. Besides, he thought, if the\nmasters found him the worst they could do would be to kill him, and\nthat was unimportant now: he already had his song.\n\nIn a corridor at the opposite side of the central room he saw a knot\nof Alberts, among whom he recognized only Puna. The elder was speaking\nwith some others, apparently trying to calm them. Cadnan pushed his way\nto Puna's side and heard the talk die down, while all stared at the\naudacious newcomer.\n\n\"I am looking for Dara,\" Cadnan said loudly, to be heard over the\ncontinuous noise from elsewhere.\n\nPuna said: \"I do not know Dara,\" and turned away. Another shouted:\n\n\"Where are the masters? Where is work?\"\n\nCadnan shouted: \"Wait for the masters,\" and went on, pushing his way\nthrough the noise, through the babbling crowd of Alberts. There were no\nmasters visible anywhere: that was a new thing and a strange one, but\ntoo many new things were happening. Cadnan barely noticed one more.\n\nAt the front of his mind now was only the thought of Dara. Behind that\nwas a vague, nagging fear that he was the cause of all the rumbling and\nshaking of the building, and all else, by his breaking of the chain of\nobedience. Now, he told himself, the buildings even did not obey.\n\nThen he heard a voice say: \"Cadnan,\" and all other thought fled. The\nvoice was hers, Dara's. He saw her, ahead, and went to her quickly.\n\nShe had not been hurt.\n\nThat fact sent a wave of relief through him, a wave so strong that for\na second he could barely stand.\n\n\"The door opens,\" she said when he had reached her, in a small and\nfrightened voice. \"The masters are not here.\"\n\n\"They return,\" Cadnan said, but without complete assurance. In this\nbarrage of novelty, who could make any statement certain?\n\nDara nodded. \"Then we must go,\" she said. \"If they are not here, then\nmaybe they do not hear the noise when we open the door: and there is\nmuch noise already to hide it. Maybe they do not see us.\"\n\n\"And if they do?\"\n\nDara looked away. \"I have my song,\" she said.\n\n\"And I have mine.\" It was settled.\n\nAs they headed toward the big front doors others followed, but there\nwas no use bothering about that. When Cadnan opened the door, in fact,\nthe others fell back and remained, staring, until it had shut behind\nthem. There was the great noise of bells and buzzers--but that had been\ngoing on, Cadnan realized, even before they had begun. Outside, the\nspot-lights seemed weaker. There was smoke everywhere, and ahead the\nforest was a black and frightening mass.\n\nHe looked at Dara, who showed her fear for one instant.\n\n\"I am also afraid,\" he told her, and was rewarded by a look of\ngratitude. \"But we must go on.\" He took her hand.\n\nThey walked slowly into the smoke and the noise. As they reached the\nedge of the forest, the sound began to diminish, very slowly; and,\nahead of them, through the haze and beyond the twisted trees, the sun\nbegan to rise.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey walked for a long while, and by the time they had finally stopped\nthe noise was gone. There was a haze over everything, but through the\nhaze a morning sun shone, and a heavy peace hung over the world.\n\nThere were trees, but these were neither like Bent Line Tree, for\nmating, nor for food. Perhaps, Cadnan thought, they were for building,\nbut he did not know, and had no way to know until an elder showed him.\n\nAnd there were no elders any more. There were neither elders nor\nmasters: there was only Cadnan, and Dara--and, somewhere, Marvor and\nthe group he had spoken of. Cadnan peered round, but he saw no one.\nThere were small new sounds, and those were frightening, but they were\nso tiny--rustles, squeaks, no more--that Cadnan could not feel greatly\nfrightened by them.\n\nThe green-gray light that filtered through the trees and haze bathed\nboth Alberts in a glow that enhanced their own bright skin-color. They\nstood for a few seconds, listening, and then Dara turned.\n\n\"I know these sounds,\" she said. \"I talk to others in our room, and\nsome of these work outside. They tell me of these sounds and this\nplace: it is called a jungle.\"\n\nCadnan made a guess. \"The trees make the sound.\"\n\n\"Small beings make it,\" Dara corrected him. \"There are such small\nbeings, not slaves and not masters. They have no speech but they make\nsound.\"\n\nCadnan meditated on this new fact for a short time. Then Dara spoke\nagain.\n\n\"Where is Marvor? The time of mating is near.\"\n\nCadnan saw her meaning. It was necessary to find Bent Line Tree, or\nsome like it, and advising elders, all before the time of mating. Yet\nhe did not know how. \"Maybe masters come,\" he suggested hopefully, \"and\ntell us what to do.\"\n\nDara shook her head. \"No. The masters kill us. They do not lead us any\nmore. Only we lead ourselves.\"\n\nCadnan thought privately that such an idea was silly, almost too silly\nfor words: how could a person lead himself? But he said nothing to\nDara, not wanting to hurt her. Instead, he pretended, helplessly, to\nagree with her: \"You are right. We lead ourselves now.\"\n\n\"But we must know where Marvor stays.\"\n\nThat sounded more reasonable. Cadnan considered it for a minute.\nWherever Marvor was hiding, it had to be somewhere in the jungle. And\nso, in order to find him, they had only to walk through it.\n\nAnd so they set out--on a walk long enough to serve as an aboriginal\nOdyssey for the planet. The night-beasts, soft glowing circles of eyes\nand mouths which none of their race had ever seen before: the giant\nflesh-eating plants: the herd of bovine monsters which, confused,\nstampeded at them, shaking the ground with their tread and making the\nfeathery trees shake as if there were a hurricane: all this might have\nmade an epic, had there been anyone to record it. But Cadnan expected\nno more and no less: the world was strange. Any piece of it was as\nstrange as any other.\n\nOnce they came across a grove of food-trees, and ate their fill, but\nthey saved little to take with them, being unused to doing their own\nplanning. So they went on, hungry and in the midst of dangers scarcely\nrecognized, sleeping at night however they could, travelling aimlessly\nby day. And after a time that measured about three days they stopped in\na small clearing and heard a voice.\n\n\"Who is there?\"\n\nCadnan, frightened by the sudden noise, managed to says \"I am Cadnan\nand there is one with me called Dara. We look for Marvor.\"\n\nThe strange voice hesitated a second, but its words, when it did speak,\nwere in a tone that was peaceful enough.\n\n\"I know of Marvor and will take you to him. It is not far to where he\nstays.\"\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\nAfter the first rush of battle, matters began to quiet a little.\nAgainst tremendous odds, and in a few brief hours, the armaments of\nFruyling's World had managed to beat off the Confederation fleets, and\nthese had withdrawn to reform and to prepare for a new phase of the\nengagement.\n\nIn the far-off days before the age of Confederation, war had, perhaps,\nbeen an affair of grinding, constant attack and defense. No one could\nsay for sure: many records were gone, much had been destroyed. But\nnow there was waiting, preparation, linked batteries of armaments and\ncalculators for prediction--and then the brief rush and flurry of\nbattle, followed by the immense waiting once more.\n\nFor Dodd, it was a time to breathe and to look around. He had enough\nwork to do: the damage to Building Three, and the confusion among the\nAlberts, had to be dealt with, and all knew time was short. Very few\nof the Alberts had actually escaped--and most of those, Dodd told\nhimself bitterly, would die in their own jungles, for lack of knowledge\nor preparation. Most, though, simply milled around, waiting for the\nmasters, wondering and worrying.\n\nNorma was safe, of course: after a frantic search Dodd had found her\nbelow-ground in the basements of Building One, along with most of\nthe Psych division. Without present duties forcing them to guard or\nmaintain the Alberts, the Psych division had holed up almost entire in\nthe steel corridors that echoed with the dull booms of the battle.\nHe'd gasped out some statement of relief, and Norma had smiled at him.\n\n\"I knew you'd be safe,\" she said. \"I knew you had to be.\"\n\nAnd of course she was right. Even if what she said had sounded cold,\nremoved--he had to remember she was under shock, too, the attack had\ncome unexpectedly on them all. It didn't matter what she said: she was\nsafe. He was glad of that.\n\nOf course he was, he thought. Of course he was.\n\nEven if the things she said, the cold-blooded way she looked at the\nworld, sometimes bothered him....\n\nAnd, a day later, when everyone was picking up the scattered pieces of\nthe world and attempting, somehow, to rig a new defense, she'd said\nmore. Not about herself, or about him. Tacitly, they knew all of that\nhad to wait for a conclusion to the battle. But about the Alberts....\n\n\"Of course they're not disloyal,\" she told him calmly. \"They don't even\nknow what disloyalty means: we've seen to that. The masters are as\nmuch a part of their world as--as food, I suppose. You don't stage a\nrebellion against food, do you?\"\n\nDodd frowned. \"But some of them have escaped.\"\n\n\"Wandered, you mean. Just wandered off. And--oh, I suppose a few have.\nOur methods aren't perfect. But they are pretty good, Johnny: look at\nthe number of Alberts who simply stayed around.\"\n\n\"We're making them slaves.\"\n\n\"No.\" She shook her head, violently. \"Nobody can make a slave. All\nwe've done is seize an opportunity. Think of our own history, Johnny:\nfirst the clan, or the band--some sort of extended family group. Then,\nwhen real leadership is needed, the slave-and-master relationship.\"\n\n\"Now, wait a minute,\" Dodd said. Norma had been brain-washed into some\nsilly set of slogans: it was his job to break them down. \"The clan can\nelect leaders--\"\n\n\"Sure it can,\" she said. \"But democracy is a civilized commodity,\nJohnny--in a primitive society it's a luxury the society can't afford.\nWhat guarantees have you got that the clan will elect the best\npossible leader? Or that, having elected him, they'll follow him along\nthe best paths?\"\n\n\"Self-interest--\"\n\nBut again she cut him off. \"Self-interest is stupid,\" she said\ncasually. \"A child needs to learn. Schooling is in the best interest of\nthat child. Agreed?\"\n\n\"Yes, but--\"\n\n\"Did you ever hear of a child who liked school, Johnny?\" she asked.\n\"Did you ever hear of a child who went to school, regularly, eagerly,\nwithout some sort of force being applied, physical, mental or moral?\nNo, Johnny, self-interest is short-sighted. Force is all that works.\"\n\n\"But--\" He was sure she was wrong, but he couldn't see where. \"Who are\nwe to play God for them?\" he said at last.\n\n\"They need somebody,\" Norma said. \"And we need them. Even.\"\n\nShe seemed harder now, somehow, more decided. Dodd saw that the one\nattack had changed a lot--in Norma, in everyone. Albin, for instance,\nwasn't involved with fun any more: he had turned into a fanatical\ndrill-sergeant, with a squad of Alberts under him, and it was even\nrumored that he slept in their quarters.\n\nAnd Norma ... what had happened to her? After the fighting was over,\nand they could talk again, could relax and reach out for each other\nonce again....\n\nShe had become so hard....\n\nOne new fear ran through the defenders. The Alberts who had escaped\nmight return, some said, vowing vengeance against the masters....\n\n\n\n\n21\n\n\nCadnan had learned much in a very short time. Everyone was hurried\nnow, as the time of mating approached more and more quickly and as\nthe days sped by: knowledge was thrown at Cadnan and at Dara in vast,\nindigestible lumps, and they were left to make what they could of it,\nwhile the others went about their normal assigned work.\n\nHe learned about the invasion, for instance--or as much about it as\nMarvor, the elders and a few other late arrivals could piece together.\nTheir explanations made surprisingly good sense, in the main, though\nnone of them, not even Marvor, could quite comprehend the notion of\nmasters having masters above them: it appeared contrary to reason.\n\nCadnan learned, also, the new trees in this new place, which the elders\nhad found. There were food trees nearby, and others whose leaves were\nmeant for building, and there were also trees of mating like his own\nBent Line Tree. No one could tell Cadnan where Bent Line Tree itself\nmight be: and so he became resigned to his first mating with a new\ntree, which the elders had called Great Root Tree. It was not truly\nright, he told himself, but there was nothing to do about it.\n\nThe life in the jungle made Cadnan uncomfortable: he was nothing larger\nthan himself, and he felt very small. When he had masters, he was a\npart of something great, of the chain of obedience. But here, in the\njungle, there was no chain (and would the trees obey when their time\ncame?) and each felt himself alone. It was not good to feel alone,\nCadnan decided; yet, again, there was nothing he could do. It mattered\nfor a time, and then it ceased to matter.\n\nThe time of mating came closer and closer, and Cadnan felt his own\nneeds grow with the hours. The sun rose, and fell, and rose again.\n\nThen the time came.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was dark. There were others near them, but they were alone. Cadnan\nknew Dara was standing near him in the darkness, though he saw nothing.\nHe heard her breath coming slowly at first, and then a little faster.\nHe did not hear his own, but that was no matter. There was a sound from\na small night-animal, but it did not come near. He stood with Dara near\nto Great Root Tree: if he put out his hand, he could touch it.\n\nBut he kept his hand at his side. Touching the tree, at that moment,\nwas wrong. There were the old rules, the true rules, and to think of\nthem made him feel better.\n\nDara said nothing: it was not necessary for her to speak. They knew\neach other, and the attraction was very strong. Cadnan had felt the\nattraction before, but until that moment he had not known how strong it\nwas. And then it grew, and grew.\n\nStill they did not move. Darkness covered both, and there was no more\nsound. The very feeling of the presence of others disappeared: there\nwas nothing but Cadnan, and Dara, and Great Root Tree.\n\nIt called to him, but not to him alone. He knew what he had to do. He\nfelt the front of his body growing warm and then hot. He felt the first\ntouch of the liquid.\n\nHe touched Dara: their fronts touched. That alone was more than Cadnan\nhad ever imagined yet it was not enough. Still there was more he was\ncalled on to do: he did not think about it, or know of it until it was\ndone. He moved against Dara, as she against him: he was not himself. He\nwas more and less, he was only the front of his body and he was Great\nRoot Tree, he was all trees, all worlds....\n\nWhen he stepped back it was like dying, but he could not die, since\nthere was more for him to do. He stood still, very close to Dara, and,\nremaining close, he went to the tree. It was not far and both knew the\npath, but it seemed far. Cadnan could feel the mixed liquids on his\nfront, his and Dara's: Great Root Tree seemed to call these liquids to\nitself, and himself and Dara with them.\n\nThey walked to it. In the darkness they could not see it, but they knew\nthe tree: they had spent time knowing it before that night. Cadnan\nreached out a slow hand and touched the back of the tree, almost\nas smooth as metal, with only minute irregularities throughout its\nsurface. Once again a long time seemed to pass, but it was not long.\n\nThen he was against the tree while Dara stood behind, waiting. He\npressed himself against the bark and he felt himself becoming part of\nGreat Root Tree, becoming the tree itself; and this lasted for all time\nand no time, and he was separated from it and saw Dara come to where he\nhad pressed, and move delicately and then fiercely upon the bark; then\nhe saw nothing but heard her breathing faster and faster, and all sound\nstopped ... there was a long silence ... and then her breathing began\nagain, very slowly, very slowly.\n\nShe returned to Cadnan and took his hand. It was finished. Soon the\ntree would bud with the results of the liquids rubbed on it: after\nthat, there would be small ones, and Cadnan would be an elder. All\nof this was in the future and it was very dim in Cadnan's mind, but\neverything was dim: he lay on the ground and Dara lay near him, both\nvery tired, too tired to think of anything, and he felt himself shaking\nfor a time and his breath hissed in and out until the shaking stopped.\n\nDara, too, was quiet at last. The darkness had not changed. There was\nno sound, and no motion.\n\nIt was over.\n\n\n\n\n22\n\n\nWhen the Confederation forces reformed, they came on with a crash. Dodd\nhad heard for months that Fruyling's World could never stand up to a\nreal assault: he had even thought he believed it. But the first attack\nhad bolstered his gloomy confidence, and the results of the second came\nnot only as a surprise but as a naked shock.\n\nThe Alberts in spite of a few fearful masters, had been issued Belbis\ntubes and fought valiantly with them; the batteries did everything\nexpected of them, and the sky was lit with supernal flashes of blinding\ncolor throughout one hard-fought night. Dodd himself, carrying a huge\nBelbis beam, braced himself against the outer wall of Building One and\nplayed the beam like a hose on any evidence of Confederation ships up\nthere in the lightning-lit sky: he felt only like a robot, doing an\nassigned and meaningless job, and it was only later that he realized he\nhad been shivering all the time he had used the killing beam. As far as\nhe could tell he had hit nothing at all.\n\nThe battle raged for six hours, and by its end Dodd was half-deafened\nby the sound and half-blinded by the sporadic rainbow flashes that\nmeant a hit or a miss or a return-blow, lancing down from the ships to\nshake buildings and ground. At first he had thought of Norma, safe in\nthe bunkers below Building One. Then she had left his mind entirely and\nthere was only the battle, the beginning of all things and the end\n(only the battle and the four constant words in his mind): even when\nthe others began to retreat and Dodd heard the shouted orders he never\nmoved. His hands were frozen to the Belbis beam, his ears heard only\nbattle and his eyes saw only the shining results of his own firing.\n\nThere was a familiar voice--Albin's: \"... get out while you've got a\nchance--it's over....\"\n\nAnother voice: \"... better surrender than get killed....\"\n\nThe howls of a squad of Alberts as a beam lanced over them, touching\nthem only glancingly, not killing but only subjecting them to an\ninstant of \"punishment\"; and the howls ceased, swallowed up in the\ngreater noise.\n\nA voice: \"... Johnny....\"\n\nIt meant nothing. Dodd no longer knew he had a name: he was only\nan extension of his beam, firing with hypnotized savagery into the\nlimitless dark.\n\n\"Johnny....\"\n\nHe heard his own voice answering. \"Get back to the bunker. You'll be\nsafe in the bunker. Leave me alone.\" His voice was strange to his ears,\nlike an echo of the blasts themselves, rough and loud.\n\nDawn was beginning to color the sky, very slightly. That was good: in\ndaylight he might be able to see the ships. He would fire the beam and\nsee the ships die. That was good, though he hardly knew why: he knew\nonly that it pleased him. He watched the dawn out of a corner of one\neye.\n\n\"Johnny, it's all over, we've lost, it's finished. Johnny, come with\nme.\"\n\nNorma's voice. But Norma was in the bunker. Norma had caused the\nbattle: she had made the slaves. Now she was safe while he fought.\nThe thought flickered over his mind like a beam blast, and sank into\nblackness.\n\n\"Johnny, please ... Johnny ... come on, now. Come on. You'll be safe.\nYou don't want to die....\"\n\nNo, of course he didn't. He fired the beam, aimed, fired again, aimed\nagain. He could die when his enemies were dead. He could die when\neveryone who was trying to kill him was dead. Then he could die, or\nlive: it made no difference.\n\nHe fired again, aimed again, fired....\n\n\"Johnny, please....\" The voice distracted him a little. No wonder\nhe couldn't kill all the ships, with that voice distracting him.\nIt went on and on: \"Johnny, you don't have to die ... you're not\nresponsible.... Johnny, you aren't a slaver, you just had a job to\ndo.... Killing isn't the answer, Johnny, death isn't the answer....\"\n\nThe voice went on and on, but he tried to ignore it. He had to keep\nfiring: that was his job, and more than his job. It was his life. It\nwas all of his life that he had left.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDr. Haenlingen had told her she was too close to see properly, and, of\ncourse, she was. Perhaps she knew that, in the final seconds. Perhaps\nshe never did. But that Dodd, who wanted to die and who considered\ndeath the only proper atonement for his life, could have displaced\nthat wish onto the Confederation, onto his \"enemies,\" and so reached a\nprecarious and temporary balance, never occurred to her. And if it had,\nperhaps she could have done nothing better ... time had run out.\n\nTime had run out. Johnny Dodd's enemies wanted him dead, and so he had\nto kill them (and so avoid killing himself, and so avoid recognizing\nhow much he himself wanted to be dead). But the balance wasn't\ncomplete. There was still the guilt, still the terrible guilt that made\nit _right_ for the Confederation to kill him.\n\nThe guilt had to be displaced, too.\n\nNorma did what she could, did what she thought right. \"You don't have\nto die,\" she told him. \"You're not responsible.\"\n\nThat was what he heard, and it was enough. He hadn't made the Alberts\ninto slaves. He hadn't made the Alberts into slaves.\n\nBut he knew who had. Long before, it had all been carefully explained\nto him. All of the tricks that had been used....\n\nOf course, Dodd thought. Of course he wasn't responsible.\n\nHe felt an enormous peace descend on him, like a cloak, as he turned\nwith the beam in his hand and smiled at Norma. She began, tentatively,\nto return his smile.\n\nThe beam cut her down where she stood and left a swathe of jungle\nbehind her black and smoking.\n\nDodd, his job completed, dropped the beam. For one instant four words\nlit up in his mind, and then everything went out into blankness and\npeace. The body remained, the body moved, the body lived, for a time.\nBut after those four words, blinding and bright and then swallowed up,\nJohnny Dodd was gone.\n\nHe had found what he needed.\n\n_This is the end._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n                          PUBLIC OPINION SIX\n\n    From A Cultural Record of Fruyling's World\n\n    Personal Histories of the Natives (called Alberts)\n\n    As Dictated and Preserved on Tape by Historical Commission HN3-40-9\n\n    Subject (called) Cadnan\n\n... Dara is dead in the returning, when new masters come to us and say\nthe fighting is over. It is an accident which kills her, a stumble,\nthey say, against a plant which is dangerous to animal life and to our\nkind. The accident is over and Dara is dead, and we return.\n\nI find Marvor after the fighting, once only, and I ask him what it\nis that is so important about this fighting. The Confederation--the\nmasters we now have--are only masters like the ones we know. Marvor\nlooks at me with a look as if he, too, is a master.\n\n\"Freedom is that important,\" he says. \"Freedom is the most important\nthing.\"\n\nI know that Marvor is not right, because I know the most important\nthing: it is the dead. For me Dara is most important, and I remember\nPuna, who is dead in the fighting: the rest does not matter. I say this\nnow, knowing that the talk-machine hears me and that the Confederation\nhears me.\n\nI say: \"Can freedom make me feel happy?\"\n\nMarvor looks more like a master. \"Freedom is good,\" he says.\n\n\"And yet Dara is dead,\" I say. \"And others are dead. How do I feel\nhappy when I know this?\"\n\n\"In freedom,\" Marvor tells us, \"Dara would be safe, and the others.\"\n\n\"Yet it is freedom that kills them,\" I say.\n\nMarvor says: \"Not freedom but the war. The fight against our masters\nhere, the old masters, to make them give us freedom.\"\n\nI say: \"Do not our old masters have freedom?\"\n\n\"They do,\" Marvor says, \"now.\"\n\nThis puzzles me. I say: \"But they have freedom at all times. They have\nwhat they want, and if freedom is a good, and they want it, then they\nhave it.\"\n\nMarvor says: \"It is true. They have freedom for themselves.\"\n\n\"Yet these other masters tell them what to do,\" I say, \"and fight them\nto make them do it. This is not the freedom you tell of.\"\n\nMarvor says: \"There is a difference.\"\n\nI do not see this difference, and he can not tell it to me though he\ntries hard. But I think maybe the new masters can tell me what it is.\nMarvor is going to what they call a school and I also go. This is a\nplace where masters tell things, and we must remember them. Remembering\nis not hard, but we must think also, and do work. It is not enough to\nask a question and find an answer. It is necessary to find our own\nanswers.\n\nA master asks us to count, and then to do things with the numbers we\nuse in our counting. This is called arithmetic. We must do things with\nthe numbers every day, and if we do not the masters are not happy with\nus. This arithmetic is hard: it is all new. Yet if I do it right I do\nnot find more food or a better place or any thing I want. I do not see\nwhat is the use of this arithmetic.\n\nBut the use does not matter. The master tells me a use. He says\narithmetic and all of the things in the school raise the cultural\nlevel. I do not know what a cultural level is or if it is good to be\nraised. The masters do not care whether I know this. They make me do\nwhat they want me to do.\n\nAnd it is not simple like pushing buttons and watching a machine. It\nis not simple like all the things I do since I am small Cadnan. It is\nhard, very hard, and all the time it is more hard.\n\nEvery day there is a school. Every day there is hard work. Marvor says\nthat freedom means doing for yourself what you want and deciding right\nand wrong. I say freedom is bad because the masters know right and\nwrong and we do not. Others say with me: there are some who know the\nold truths and think it is better when we, too, can understand right\nand wrong.\n\nBut the masters say what we have is freedom. I say it is not so. The\nmasters tell us what to do: they tell us to do arithmetic, to do all\nother school things, and we do not do for ourselves what we want. We do\nnot do anything for ourselves, but always the masters tell us.\n\nThis is the same as before the fighting. It is always the same. A\nmaster is a master.\n\nBut the old masters were the best. I remember the old masters and the\nold work, and I want this time to come again. I want the old work,\nwhich is easy, and not this new work, which is hard. I want the old\nslavery, where we know right and wrong, and not the new slavery, where\nonly the masters know and they say they cannot tell us.\n\nIf I am free, if I can decide for myself what it is that I want, then\nthis is what I decide.\n\nI want the old masters back again.\n\nI, Cadnan, say this.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n                         PUBLIC OPINION SEVEN\n\n    From the speech of Dr. Anna Haenlingen\n\n    Before the High Court (Earth) of the Confederation\n\n    Preparatory to the Passing of Sentence\n\n...

As head of the Psychological Division\non Fruyling's World previous to the unjustified intervention of\nConfederation force in the affairs of that world, I feel it incumbent\non me to define a position which even our own advocates do not seem to\nunderstand.\n\nI bear a good deal of the responsibility for conditions on Fruyling's\nWorld, and I have not shirked that responsibility. I found the\nnatives of that world in a condition of slavery, due to the work of\nmy predecessors. I maintained them in that slavery, and made no move\nwhatever to free them or to mitigate their status.\n\nThis is, in truth, a cynical position. I do not believe, and I have\nnever believed, that freedom is necessarily a good for all people at\nall times. Like any other quality, it can be used for good or for ill.\n\nIn the contact between any barbarian people and any civilized people,\nsome species of slavery is necessary. The barbarian does not know\nthat he is a barbarian, and the only way to convey to him the fact\nthat he stands at the bottom of a long ladder--a ladder so long\nthat we have by no means reached its end, and have perhaps not yet\nseen its midpoint--is to force him to make contact with elements of\ncivilization, and to utilize continuous force to keep this contact\nalive and viable.\n\nThe alien--the barbarian--will not of himself continue contact in any\nmeaningful manner. The gap is too great between his life and that\nof the civilized person, and a disparity so great becomes, simply,\ninvisible. Under conditions of equality, the civilized person must\ndegenerate to barbarian status: his mind can comprehend the barbarian,\nand he can move in that direction. The barbarian, incapable of\ncomprehension of the civilized world, cannot move toward that which he\ncannot see.\n\nIn order to bring him into motion, slavery and subjection appear\nnecessities. There has been no civilization of which we have record\nwhich has not passed through a period of subjection to another, more\nforceful civilization: the Greeks, the Romans, the Jews, all the great\ncivilizations of which there is available record have passed through a\nperiod of slavery. Nor is this accidental.\n\nSome force must be applied to begin the motion toward civilization.\nThat force--disguise it how you will--is slavery. It is clearly the\nattempt to make another person do what he would not do, does not\nwish to do, and sees no personal profit in doing, under threat of\npunishment. It is subjection. That subjection is all we mean by slavery.\n\nAnd slavery is a necessity.\n\nPerhaps we were wrong: perhaps the slavery which was dictated to us by\nthe conditions which prevailed upon Fruyling's World was not the best\nsort available. But freedom is not, in any case, the answer. A man may\ndie as the result of too much oxygen: a culture, likewise, may die of\ntoo much freedom.\n\nI have no fear of the sentence of this court. My death is unimportant,\nand I do not fear it. I might fear that my work be left undone, were I\nnot certain that, under whatever name, the Confederation will find it\nnecessary to maintain slavery on Fruyling's World.\n\nOf this, I am quite sure.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n    From the Report of Genmo. Darad Farnung, Commanding Confederation\n    Expeditionary Force, 3rd Sector From Base of Occupation, Fruyling's\n    World (NC34157:495:4)\n\n... In the three planetary months (approx. ninety-two Solar days) since\noccupation of this world, no serious incidents have been reported.\nThe previous \"rulers\" of this world have been transshipped to Earth\nfor disposal there by Confederation governmental process. With the\nintroduction of fully automated machinery, the world's primary\nresources are being utilized for the good of the Confederation without\nthe introduction of any form of slavery or forced labor whatever....\n\n... Regarding education and aid as involving the native population,\nthe initial shipments of teachers, investigators and experts in\nxenopsychology have enabled the occupation force to begin a full\neducational program for the benefit of the natives. This program has\nbeen accepted by the natives without delay and without any untoward\nincidents, and reports to the contrary are assumed to have been\ninitiated by disaffected personnel. The program of education in a\ndemocratic and workable form of government for these natives is, and\nmust remain, one of the shining examples of the liberative effects of\nConfederation doctrine and government, and should provide a valuable\nprecedent in future cases....\n\n... Reports that the profits of the major business of this world,\nsince the introduction of automated machinery and experts for the\nrepair and upkeep thereof, have decreased to the vanishing point should\nnot be taken as serious: this is assumed to be merely a temporary\nhardship due to the transfer workload from the natives to the automated\nstructure.... Since the only alternative is the placement of the\nworkload on enslaved natives of this world, the temporary rise in taxes\ndue to the loss on essential product profit should be taken as a needed\nand welcome sacrifice in the name of liberty by the peoples of the\nConfederation....\n\n... A list of further urgent materials, together with a list of\nspecialties now urgently required in order to maintain full production\nhere, and a revised schedule of budgetary requirements to include these\nadditional requisitions, is hereby appended....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nTHE MASTERS\n\n_johnny dodd:_ he had everything a man could want on Fruyling's\nWorld--except freedom from the horror of being there.\n\n_dr. haenlingen:_ icy, reserved, the architect of the system that kept\nmen on top and aliens enslaved.\n\n_norma:_ warm and human, she was Dodd's one hope for salvation.\n\nTHE SLAVES\n\n_cadnan:_ he did what he was told ... until the Masters told him to die.\n\n_marvor:_ the first of his race to have an independent idea--an idea\nthat was dangerous and deadly.\n\n_dara:_ green and reptilian, but beautiful enough to inspire Cadnan to\nthe slave world's worst crime.\n\nAs the space fleets of an outraged Terran Confederation close in on the\noutlaw planet of Fruyling's World, the destinies of slave and master\nmeet explosively, and from the shock of battle and its aftermath come\nan unexpected and awesome conclusion.\n\nPYRAMID PRESENTS\n\nROBERT BLOCH\n\nBOGEY MEN (F-839)\n\n\nA PYRAMID BOOK 40\u00a2\n\nCover painting by Jack Gaughan\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Slave Planet, by Laurence Janifer\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK SLAVE PLANET ***\n\n***** This file should be named 51855-8.txt or 51855-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/1/8/5/51855/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
