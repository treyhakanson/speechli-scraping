Earth's first colony in Space. Men killed for the coveted ticket\nthat allowed them to go there. And, once there, the killing went on....\n\n\nMARS\n\n... Ralph Graham's goal since boyhood--and he was Mars-bound with\nauthority that put the whole planet in his pocket--if he could live\nlong enough to assert it!\n\n\nMARS\n\n... source of incalculable wealth for humanity--and deadly danger for\nthose who tried to get it!\n\n\nMARS\n\n... in Earth's night sky, a symbol of the god of war--in this tense\nnovel of the future, a vivid setting for stirring action!\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nI'd known for ten minutes that something terrible was going to happen.\nIt was in the cards, building to a zero-count climax.\n\nThe spaceport bar was filled with a fresh, washed-clean smell, as if\nall the winds of space had been blowing through it. There was an autumn\ntang in the air as well, because it was open at both ends, and out\nbeyond was New Chicago, with its parks and tall buildings, and the big\ninland sea that was Lake Michigan.\n\nIt was all right ... if you just let your mind dwell on what was\noutside. Men and women with their shoulders held straight and a\nnew lift to the way they felt and thought, because Earth wasn't a\nclosed-circuit any more. Kids in the parks pretending they were\nspacemen, bundled up in insulated jackets, having the time of their\nlives. A blue jay perched on a tree, the leaves turning red and yellow\naround it. A nurse in a starched white uniform pushing a perambulator,\nher red-gold hair whipped by the wind, a dreamy look in her eyes.\n\nNothing could spoil any part of that. It was there to stay and I\nbreathed in deeply a couple of times, refusing to remember that in\nthe turbulent, round-the-clock world of the spaceports, Death was an\ninveterate barhopper.\n\nThen I did remember, because I had to. You can't bury your head in the\nsand to shut out ugliness for long, unless you're ostrich-minded and\nare willing to let your integrity go down the drain.\n\nI didn't know what time it was and I didn't much care. I only knew that\nDeath had come in late in the afternoon, and was hovering in stony\nsilence at the far end of the bar.\n\nHe was there, all right, even if he had the same refractive index as\nthe air around him and you could see right through him. The sixth-sense\nkind of awareness that everyone experiences at times--call it a\npremonition, if you wish--had started an alarm bell ringing in my mind.\n\nIt was still ringing when I raised my eyes, and knew for sure that all\nthe furies that ever were had picked that particular time and place to\nhold open house.\n\nI saw it begin to happen.\n\nIt began so suddenly it had the impact of a big, hard-knuckled fist\ncrashing down on the spaceport bar, startling everyone, jolting even\nthe solitary drinkers out of their private nightmares.\n\nActually the violence hadn't quite reached that stage. But it was a\nsafe bet that it would in another ten or twelve seconds. And when it\ndid there was no chain or big double lock on Earth that could keep it\nfrom terminating in bloodshed.\n\nThe tipoff was the way it started, as if a fuse had been lit that would\nblow the place apart. Just two voices for an instant, raised in anger,\none ringing out like a pistol shot. But I knew that something was\ndangerously wrong the instant I caught sight of the two men who were\ndoing the arguing.\n\nThe one whose voice had made every glass on the long bar vibrate like a\ntuning fork was a blond giant, six-foot-four at least and built massive\naround the shoulders. His shirt was open at the throat and his chest\nwas sweat-sheened and he had the kind of outsized ruggedness that made\nyou feel it would have taken a heavy rock-crushing machine a full half\nhour to flatten him out.\n\nThe other was of average height and only looked small by contrast.\nHe was more than holding his own, however, standing up to the Viking\ncharacter defiantly. His weather-beaten face was as tight as a\ndrum, and his hair was standing straight up, as though a charge of\nhigh-voltage electricity had passed right through him.\n\nHe just happened to have unusually bristly hair, I guess. But it gave\nhim a very weird look indeed.\n\nI don't know why someone picked that critical moment to shout a\nwarning, because everyone could see it was the kind of argument that\ncouldn't be stopped by anything short of strong-armed intervention.\nAdvice at that point could be just as dangerous as pouring kerosene on\nthe fuse, to make it burn faster.\n\nBut someone did yell out, at the top of his lungs. \"Pipe down, you two!\nWhat do you think this is, a debating society?\"\n\nIt could have turned into that, all right, the deadliest kind of\ndebating society, with the stoned contingent taking sides for no sane\nreason. It could have started off as a free-for-all and ended with five\nor six of the heaviest drinkers lying prone, with bashed-in skulls.\n\nThe barkeep made a makeshift megaphone of his two hands and added\nto the confusion by shouting: \"Get back in line or I'll have you run\nright out of here. I'll show you just how tough I can get. Every time\nsomething like this happens I get blamed for it. I'm goddam sick of\nbeing in the middle.\"\n\n\"That's telling them, John! Need any help?\"\n\n\"No, stay where you are. I can handle it.\"\n\nI didn't think he could, not even if he was split down the middle into\ntwo men twice his size. I didn't think anyone could, because by this\ntime I'd had a chance to take a long, steady, camera-eye look at the\nexpression on the Viking character's face.\n\nI'd seen that expression before and I knew what it meant. The Viking\ncharacter was having a virulent sour grapes reaction to something\nAverage Size had said. It had really taken hold, like a smallpox\nvaccination that's much too strong, and his inner torment had become\njust agonizing enough to send him into a towering rage.\n\nAverage Size had probably been boasting, telling everyone how lucky he\nwas to be on the passenger list of the next Mars-bound rocket. And in\na crowded spaceport bar, where Martian Colonization Board clearances\nare at a terrific premium, you don't indulge in that kind of talk. Not\nunless you have a suicide complex and are dead set on leaving the earth\nwithout traveling out into space at all.\n\nNow things were coming to a head so fast there was no time to cheat\nDeath of his cue. He was starting to come right out into the open,\nscythe swinging, punctual to the dot. I was sure of it the instant I\nsaw the gun gleaming in the Viking character's hand and the smaller man\nrecoiling from him, his eyes fastened on the weapon in stark terror.\n\n_Oh, you fool!_ I thought. _Why did you provoke him? You should have\nexpected this, you should have known. What good is a Mars clearance if\nyou end up with a bullet in your spine?_\n\nFor some strange reason the Viking character seemed in no hurry to\nblast. He seemed to be savoring the look of terror in Average Size's\neyes, letting his fury diminish by just a little, as if by allowing a\ntenth of it to escape through a steam-spigot safety valve he could make\nmore sure of his aim. It made me wonder if I couldn't still get to them\nin time.\n\nThe instant I realized there was still a chance I knew I'd have to try.\nI was in good physical trim and no man is an island when the sands are\nrunning out. I didn't want to die, but neither did Average Size and\nthere are obligations you can't sidestep if you want to go on living\nwith yourself.\n\nI moved out from where I was standing and headed straight for the\nViking character, keeping parallel with the long bar. I can't recall\never having moved more rapidly, and I was well past the barkeep--he was\nblinking and standing motionless, as white as a sheet now--when the\nViking character's voice rang out for the second time.\n\n\"You think you're better than the rest of us, don't you? Sure you do.\nWhy deny it? Who are you, who is anybody, to come in here and strut and\nput on airs? I'm going to let you have it, right now!\"\n\nThe blast came then, sudden, deafening. They were standing so close to\neach other I thought for a minute the gun had misfired, for Average\nSize didn't stiffen or sag or change his position in any way and his\nface was hidden by smoke from the blast.\n\nI should have known better, for it was a big gun with a heavy charge,\nand when a man is half blown apart his body can become galvanized for\nan instant, just as if he hasn't been hit at all. Sometimes he'll be\nlifted up and hurled back twenty feet and sometimes he'll just stand\nrigid, with the life going out of him in a rush, an instant before his\nknees give way and there's a terrible, welling redness to make you\nrealize how mistaken you were about the shot going wild.\n\nThe smoke thinned out fast enough, eddying away from him in little\nspirals. But one quick look at him sinking down, passing into eternity\nwith his head lolling, was all I had time for. Pandemonium was breaking\nloose all around me, and my only thought was to make a mad dog killer\npay for what he had done before someone got between us.\n\nMad dog killers enrage me beyond all reason. Given enough provocation\nalmost any man can go berserk and commit murder. But the Viking\ncharacter had let a provocation that merited no more than a rebuke rip\nhis self-control to shreds.\n\nThe naked brutality of it sickened me. Something primitive and very\ndangerous--or perhaps it was something super-civilized--made me out to\nbeat him into insensibility before he could kill again. I felt like a\nman confronting a poisonous snake, who knows he must stamp on it or\nblast off its head before it can sink its fangs in his flesh.\n\nI was not alone in feeling that way. All around me there was an angry\nmuttering, a cursing and a shouting. If I needed support, sturdy\nbacking, I had it. But right at that moment I didn't need it. An\nangry giant had come to life inside of me and we exchanged nods and\nunderstood each other.\n\nThere was a crash behind me, but I ignored it. What was harder to\nignore was the barkeep straddling the bar and coming down flatfooted in\nthe wake of two reeling drunks who were lunging for the killer with a\ncrazy, wild look in their eyes. I didn't want them to get to him ahead\nof me.\n\nHe hadn't moved at all and had a frightened look on his face, as if the\nblast had jolted some sanity back into him and made him realize that\nyou can't gun a man down in a crowded bar without adjusting a noose to\nyour own throat and giving fifty men a chance to draw it tight.\n\nThe gun he'd killed with might still have saved him, if he'd swung\nabout and started shooting up the bar. But I didn't give him a chance\nto recover.\n\nI ploughed into him, wrenched the gun from him and sent him reeling\nback against the bar with a solidly delivered blow to the jaw, luckily\naimed just right.\n\nThen they were on him, five or six of them, and I couldn't see him for\na moment.\n\nI held the gun tightly and looked at it. It was still warm and just the\nfeel of it sent a shiver up my spine. A gun that has just been wrenched\nfrom the hand of a killer is unlike any other weapon. There's blood on\nit, even if no laboratory test can bring it out.\n\nI didn't know I'd lost anything until I looked down and saw my\nwallet lying on the floor at my feet. The energy I'd put into the\nblow had not only sent a stab of pain up my wrist to my elbow. It\nhad jarred something loose from my inner breast pocket that had a\ndanger-potential, right at that moment, that could have turned the tide\nof rage that was sweeping the bar away from the killer and straight in\nmy direction. Some of it anyway, splitting it down the middle, causing\nthe drunks who were divided in their minds about what he had done to\nchange sides abruptly.\n\nIn my wallet was a perforated card, all stippled with tiny dots down\none side, and it said that I was on the passenger list of the next\nMars-bound rocket, and that the Martian Colonization Board clearance\nwas of a peculiar kind ... very special.\n\nThe wallet had fallen open and the card was in plain view for anyone\nto read. It could be recognized by its color alone--a light shade of\nblue--and if anyone who felt the way the killer had done about Average\nSize had caught sight of it and made a grab for the wallet--\n\nI was bending to pick it up when a voice whispered close to my ear.\n\"Don't let anyone see that card--if you want to stay in one piece.\nYou'd better get out of here before they start asking questions. They\nwon't wait for the Spaceport Police to get here. Too many of them\nwill be in trouble if they don't find out fast where everyone stands.\nThey'll know how to go about it.\"\n\nI couldn't believe it for a minute, because I hadn't seen her come in.\nI'd noticed two women at the bar, but not this one--it would have been\nimpossible for me to have failed to notice so slim a waist or hips so\nenchantingly rounded, or the honey-blonde hair piled high, or the wide,\ndark-lashed eyes that were staring at me out of a face that would have\nmade a good many men with their lives at stake forget the meaning of\ndanger.\n\nEven if she'd been wedged in tightly between two male escorts at the\nbar, I'd have noticed a part of all that. Just one glimpse of the\nback of her head, with the indefinable, special quality that makes\nbeauty like that perceptible at a glance, so that you know what the\nwhole woman will look like when she turns, would have made so deep\nan impression on me that not even the violence I'd participated in a\nmoment afterwards could have blotted it from my mind.\n\nIt left me speechless for an instant. I just snatched up the wallet,\nput it safely back in my pocket and returned her stare in complete\nsilence.\n\n\"Better keep the gun,\" she advised. \"Your fingerprints are all over it\nnow. You could clear yourself all right, considering who you are. But\nit would be much simpler just to toss it into Lake Michigan, especially\nif they decide to let him go and lie about who did the killing.\"\n\nI could have wiped the gun clean and tossed it on the floor, but I knew\nwhat was in her mind. You just don't leave a murder weapon lying around\nin plain view when you've picked it up right after a killing. It can\nlead to all kinds of complications.\n\nI nodded and stood up. \"Thanks for the advice,\" I said, finding my\nvoice at last. \"There are enough eye-witnesses here to convict him\nwithout this, if just a few of them have a conscience.\"\n\n\"Don't count on it,\" she said. \"They're angry enough to kill him right\nnow, because they don't like to see anyone gunned down like that. But\nwhen they've had time to think it over--\"\n\nShe was right, of course. There were six or seven men struggling with\nthe killer now but there were others who weren't. A fight had started\nnear the middle of the bar and someone was shouting: \"The ugly son\ndeserved what he got! Every man who gets a Mars clearance now has to\nplay along with the Colonization Board! He has to turn informer and\nhelp them set a trap for anyone who gets in their way. Just depriving\nus of our rights doesn't satisfy them. They're scheming to get the\nwhole Mars Colony for themselves.\"\n\nIt was the Big Lie--the charge that had done more damage to the Mars\nColony than the shortages of food and desperately needed construction\nmaterials, and almost as much damage as the two major power conflicts\nand the transportation difficulties that never seemed to get solved.\n\nI wanted to go right up to him and grab hold of him and hit him as hard\nas I'd hit the Viking character, because he was a killer too--a killer\nof the dream.\n\nBut the blonde who seemed to know all the answers and what was wise\nand sane and sensible was tugging at my arm and I couldn't ignore the\nurgency in her voice.\n\n\"Time's running out on you, Mr. Important Man. If they find out just\nwho you are, you won't have a chance of getting out of here alive.\nEvery one of them will be clamoring for your blood. The pity of it, the\nterrible pity, is that most of them hate violence as much as you do.\nThey hate what that wild beast just did. But the Big Lie has made them\nhate the Colonization Board even more. Do we go?\"\n\nIt came as a surprise that she was leaving with me, and that was\ndownright idiotic, in a way. With the place in an uproar, a killer\nstill trying to break loose and a fight under way it would have been\nmadness for her to stay, and the two other women had vanished without\nstopping to talk to anyone. But in moments of stress you can overlook\nthe obvious and wonder about it afterward.\n\nWe had to move fast and we ran into trouble when two struggling drunks\ngot in our way. I shouldered one aside and rammed an elbow into the\nstomach of the other and we reached the street without being stopped by\nanyone who didn't want us to leave. The card was back in my pocket and\nnot a single one of them had X-ray eyes.\n\nIn another minute or two someone would have probably remembered that\nI'd disarmed the Viking character and could have had a reason for the\nfast violent way I'd gone about it. Then I'd have been in for the kind\nof questioning the blonde had mentioned--a kangaroo court interrogation\nbefore the Spaceport Police could get there. And if my answers had\nfailed to satisfy them they would have wasted no time in turning my\npockets inside out.\n\nI'd been spared all that, thanks to that same blonde. And--I didn't\neven know her name!\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nWe'd been talking for twenty minutes and I still didn't know her\nname. She wasn't being secretive or coy or holding out on me\nbecause she didn't trust me as much as I trusted her. I just hadn't\ngotten around to asking her, because we were both still talking\nabout what had happened at the bar and it was so closely tied in\nwith what was happening in New York and London and Paris and every\nbig city on Earth--and on Mars as well--that it dwarfed our puny\nselves--extra-special as the blonde's puny self happened to be from the\nmale point of view.\n\nI didn't know whether she was Helen or Barbara, Anne or Ruth or\nTanya. I just knew that she was beautiful and that we were sipping\nMartinis and looking out through a wide picture window at New Chicago's\nlakeshore parklands enveloped in a twilight glow.\n\nThe restaurant was called the Blue Mandarin and it conformed in all\nrespects to the picture that name conjures up--a diaphanous blue,\noriental-ornate eating establishment with nothing to offer its patrons\nthat was new, original, exciting, unique.\n\nBut there it was and there it would remain--until Lake Michigan\nfroze solid. For the moment its artificial decor wasn't important to\neither of us. Only the Big Lie and what it was doing to the Martian\nColonization Project.\n\n\"My father was one of the first,\" she said. \"Do you know what it means,\nto stand in an empty, desolate waste, forty million miles from home,\nand realize you're one of the chosen few--that a city will some day\ngrow from the seeds you've planted and nourished with your life blood?\"\n\n\"I think I do,\" I said. \"I hope I do.\"\n\n\"He died,\" she said, \"when he was thirty years old, from a Martian\nvirus they hadn't discovered how to combat until two-thirds of the\nfirst two thousand colonists succumbed to it.\"\n\n\"Why didn't he take you with him?\" I asked. \"There were no passenger\nrestrictions then. The Colonization Board had great difficulty in\nfinding enough volunteers.\"\n\n\"My mother refused to go,\" she said. \"I'm afraid ... most women are\nmore conservative than men. Father died alone, and five years later\nMother married a man who didn't want to be one of the first ten\nthousand--or the first sixty thousand. He had no problem. He wasn't\nlike the men we saw tonight.\"\n\n\"If every man and woman on Earth wanted to go to Mars,\" I said, \"the\nColonization Board would have no problem. A demand on so colossal a\nscale could not be met--in a century and a half. And laws would be\npassed to prevent the scheming that's taking place everywhere, the\nhatred and the violence. The Big Lie would not be believed.\"\n\n\"I know,\" she said. \"It's when only twenty thousand can go and five\nmillion want to go that you have a problem. A little hope filters\nthrough, and the five million become envious and enraged.\"\n\nI looked at her. I was feeling the glow now, the warmth creeping\nthrough the cells of my brain, the recklessness that alcohol can\ngenerate in a man with a worry that looms as big as the Big Lie, to\nthe part of himself that isn't dedicated to combating the Lie. The\nego-centered, demandingly human part, the woman-needing part, the old\nAdam that's in all of us.\n\nAnd suddenly I found myself thinking of Paris in the Spring, and the\nsparkling Burgundies of France and vineyards in the dawn and what it\nhad meant to have a woman always at my side--or almost always--and in\nmy bed as well.\n\nNew York, flag-draped for Autumn, London in a swirling fog, the old\nhouses, the dreaming spires, anywhere on the round green Earth where\nthere was laughter and music and a woman to share it with....\n\nAll that had been mine for ten years. But now, like a fool, I wanted\nMars as well. Mars was in my blood and I could no longer rest content\nwith what I had.\n\nTake it with me to Mars? And why not? It was no problem ... when you\ndidn't have my problem. A quite simple problem, really. The woman I'd\nmarried wouldn't go with me to Mars.\n\nShe seemed to sense that I was having some kind of inward struggle,\nand was feeling a decided glow at the same time, for she reached out\nsuddenly and took firm hold of my hand.\n\n\"Something's troubling you,\" she said. \"Why don't you tell me about it\nwhile you're feeling mellow. Considering the kind of world we're living\nin, mellow is the best way to feel. It wears off quickly enough and\nnext day you pay for it. But while it lasts, I believe in making the\nmost of it. Don't you?\"\n\nShould I tell her, dared I? I might have to pay for it with a\nvengeance, for she'd probably think me quite mad. And I still had some\nold-fashioned ideas about loyalty and happened to be in love with my\nwife.\n\nIt was crazy, it made no sense, but that's the way it was.\n\nI looked at the woman sitting opposite me and wondered how a man could\nbe in love with one woman and find another so attractive that he'd been\non the verge of coming right out and asking her if she'd go with him to\nMars.\n\nI looked at her blonde hair piled up high, and her pale beautiful face\nand wondered how it would be if I hadn't been married to Joan at all.\n\nI shut my eyes for a moment, thinking back, remembering the quarrel I'd\nhad with my wife that morning, the quarrel I'd tried my best to forget\nover four straight whiskies at the spaceport bar late in the afternoon.\n\nIt was almost as if it was taking place again, right there at the\ntable, with another woman sitting opposite me who could not hear Joan's\nangry voice at all.\n\n\"I mean every word I'm saying, Ralph Graham. You either tell them\nyou're staying right here in New Chicago or I'm divorcing you. I won't\ngo to Mars with you--tomorrow or next year or five years from now. Is\nthat plain?\"\n\nIt was plain enough. To cushion the shock of it, and ease the pain\na little I stared into the fireplace, seeing for an instant in the\nhigh-leaping flames a red desert landscape and a city that towered to\nthe brittle stars ... white, resplendent, swimming in a light that\nnever was on sea or land.\n\nAll right, the first Earth colony on Mars wasn't that kind of a city.\nIt was rugged and sprawling and rowdy. It was filled with tumult and\nshouting, its prefabricated metal dwellings scoured and pitted by the\nharsh desert winds. But I liked it better that way.\n\nI wanted to walk its crooked streets, to rejoice with its builders and\ncreators, to be one of the first sixty thousand. With my mind and heart\nand blood and guts I wanted to be there before the cautious, solemn,\nover-serious people ruined it for the kind of man I was.\n\n\"I mean it, Ralph,\" Joan said. \"If you go--you'll go alone. All of my\nfriends are here, all of my roots. I won't tear myself up by the roots\neven for you. Much as I love you, I just won't.\"\n\nIt was five in the morning, and we'd been arguing half the night. In\ntwo more hours daylight would come flooding into the apartment again,\nand I'd probably have the worst talk-marathon hangover of my life.\n\nI suddenly decided to go out into the cool dawn without saying another\nword to her, slamming the door after me to make sure she'd realize just\nhow angry she'd made me.\n\nI wouldn't even switch on the five A.M. news telecast or stop to take\nin the cat on my way out. Women and cats had a great deal in common, I\ntold myself bitterly. They were arbitrary and stubborn and mysteriously\nintent on having their own way and keeping you guessing as to their\nreal motives.\n\nBy heaven ... if I had to go alone to Mars I'd go.\n\nSo I'd really hung one on, had gone out and made a round of the\nlakeside bars. All morning until noon and then I'd sobered up over\ncoffee and a sandwich and started out again early in the afternoon. It\njust goes to show what a quarrel like that can do to a man's nerves and\npeace of mind and all of his plans for the future, for I'm not even a\nmoderately heavy drinker.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEarly morning bar traveling is barbarous, a lunatic-fringe pastime, and\nit was the first time in my life I'd resorted to it. But resort to it\nI did, and as the day wore on I gravitated from the lakeside taverns\ntoward the spaceport in slow stages, and twice in five hours reached\nthe stage where I couldn't have passed the straight-line test. If I\nhadn't sobered up a little at noon I'd have reached the big, dangerous\nbar as high as a man can get without falling flat on his face.\n\nThe Colonization Board hadn't even tried to stop what goes on there\naround the clock, because there are explosive tensions and hard to\nuncover areas of criminality in a city as big as New Chicago it's\nwise to provide a safety valve for--when Mars fever is running so\nhigh practically all of us are living in the shadow of a totally\nunpredictable kind of violence.\n\nIf anyone had asked me toward the middle of the afternoon what was\ndrawing me, despite all of my better instincts, in the direction of\ndeath and violence I'd have come right out and told him.\n\nI had Mars fever too. I hated the Big Lie and all of its ramifications,\nknew that every charge that was being hurled at the Colonization Board\nwas untrue. But I knew exactly how all of the tormented, desperate\nmen felt, the ones who fought the Big Lie and still had the fever and\nneeded to be cradled in strangeness and vastness--needed space and a\nnew frontier to keep from feeling strapped down, walled in, prisoners\nin a completely new kind of torture chamber.\n\nThe restlessness was growing because Man had lived too long in a\nclosed-circuit that had almost destroyed him. The great barrier that\nwas no longer there had brought the world to the brink of a universal\nholocaust, and just knowing that it had been shattered forever was\nenabling men and women everywhere to lead healthier lives, set their\ngoals higher.\n\nThere was nothing wrong with that. Only--not one man or woman in\nfifty thousand would see with their own eyes the rust-red plains of\nMars, and the play of light and shadow on a world covered over much of\nits surface with wide zones of abundant vegetation. Not one in fifty\nthousand would have a new world to rejoice in, after the long journey\nthrough interplanetary space. A world laden with springtime scents, in\nthe wake of the crash and thunder of the polar ice caps dissolving.\n\nOr possibly snow piled high on a sleeping landscape, with a thaw just\nstarting, and the prints of small furry creatures on the white blanket\nof snow, for the first colonists had taken animals with them.\n\nIt would take another thirty years for newer, swifter rockets to be\nbuilt and the supply problem to be brought under control and the colony\nto outgrow its birth pangs and its tumultuous adolescence and become a\nwhite and towering city, as huge as New Chicago.\n\nAnd there were some who could not wait, for whom waiting was\ndestructive to body and mind, a kind of living death too terrible to be\nsanely endured.\n\nThe fingers of the woman sitting opposite me were becoming restive,\ntightening a little on my hand. It seemed incredible to me that I could\nhave gone off on that kind of thinking-back tangent when I was so close\nto paradise.\n\nFor paradise was there, seated directly across the table from me,\nin that crazy twilight hour, if I'd had the courage to seize it\nboldly--and if I hadn't been still in love with Joan.\n\nI could still make a stab at finding out for sure, I told myself, if\nI brushed aside all obstacles, if I refused to let my mind dwell on\nhow I'd feel if something happened to Joan and I lost her forever. How\ncould she have been so stubborn and foolish, when she was sophisticated\nenough to know that no man is insulated against temptation when he is\nlonely and despairing and paradise can be his for the taking, if he can\nkill just one part of himself and let the rest survive.\n\n\"What is it?\" she asked. \"You haven't said a word for five minutes.\nI'm a good listener, you know. I always have been--perhaps too good a\nlistener.\"\n\nIt was the moment of truth, when I had to decide. Mars--and a woman\ntoo. Mars--and the big, important job, and the clatter and bright\nwonder of tremendous machines, with swiftly moving parts, whirring,\nblurring, dust and the stars of morning, and a woman like that in my\narms.\n\nI had to decide.\n\n\"What is it?\" she asked. \"Can't you tell me?\"\n\n\"Someday I'll tell you,\" I said. \"But not now. I've a feeling we'll\nmeet again. Where and how and when I don't know, because by this time\ntomorrow I'll be on my way to Mars.\"\n\nA pained look came into her eyes and she quickly released my hand.\n\n\"But we've just started to get acquainted,\" she protested. \"You know\nnothing about me--or hardly anything. I thought--\"\n\n\"It might be best not to know,\" I said, and I think she must have\nrealized then just how it was, must have read the truth in my eyes, for\na faint flush suffused her face and she said quickly: \"All right. If\nthat's the way it must be.\"\n\nI nodded and beckoned to the waiter, hoping she wouldn't suspect how\nvulnerable I still was, how dangerously easy it would have been for me\nto alter my decision.\n\nTen minutes later I was alone again, with Lake Michigan glimmering at\nmy back, and only the stars for company. And I still didn't know her\nname.\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nIt happened so suddenly it would have taken me completely by surprise,\nif the alarm bell hadn't started ringing again in some shadowy corner\nof my mind. It wasn't clamorous this time, but it was loud enough to\nmake me straighten in alarm, with every nerve alert.\n\nI was standing by a high wall of foliage, close to the lakeside and\nhad just started to light a cigarette. All at once, directly overhead,\nthere was a rustling sound that was hard to mistake, for I'd heard it\nmany times before, and it had a peculiar quality which set it apart\nfrom all other sounds.\n\nSomething was moving through the shadows above me, rustling dry leaves,\nslithering down toward me with a dull, mechanical buzzing.\n\nThe buzzing stopped abruptly and there was a flash of brightness,\na long-drawn whining sound. I braced myself, letting my arms swing\nloosely at my side.\n\nWith startling swiftness something long, glistening and snakelike\ndescended upon me and wrapped itself around my right leg just above the\nknee. Before I could shake it loose it contracted into a tight knot and\nthe whining turned into a shrill scream, prolonged, ghastly. It was\nquite unlike the scream of an animal. There was something metallic,\nrasping about it, as if more than animal ferocity was giving voice to\nits pent-up rage in a shrill mechanical monotone.\n\nThe constriction increased and an agonizing stab of pain lanced up\nmy thigh. I raised my right arm and brought the edge of my hand down\nwith an abrupt, chopping motion. I chopped downward three times, not\nat random, but with a calculated, deadly precision, for I knew that a\nmisdirected blow could have cost me my life.\n\nI was in danger only for an instant, and not a very long instant at\nthat. The damage I'd done to it caused it to release its grip on my\nleg, shudder convulsively and drop to the ground.\n\nDamaged where it was most vulnerable, it writhed along the ground with\ngroping, disjointed movements of its entire body. Tiny fragments of\nshattered crystal glistened in its wake, and two long wires dangled\nfrom its cone-shaped head.\n\nIts segmented body-case glowed with a blood-red sheen as it writhed\nacross a flat gray stone on the edge of the lakeshore embankment, and\nreared up for an instant like an enormous, sightlessly groping worm.\nThen, abruptly, all the animation went out of it, and it flattened out\nand lay still. Both of the optical disks which had enabled it to move\nswiftly through the darkness had been smashed. I was no longer in any\ndanger and it was very pleasant just to know that.\n\nVery pleasant indeed.\n\nAn attempt had been made on my life. There could be no blinking\nthe fact. That little mechanical horror, with its complex interior\nmechanisms, had been set upon me from a distance with all of its\nelectronic circuits clicking by remote control.\n\nFrom just how great a distance I had no way of knowing. But I didn't\nthink he'd be staying around, near enough for me to get my hands on\nhim. Killers who made use of such gadgets usually kept their distance,\nand were very cautious.\n\nBut at least I knew now that I had a dangerous enemy, someone who\nwanted me dead. And there was nothing pleasant about that.\n\nThe human mind is a very strange instrument and it's hard to predict\njust how profoundly you'll be upset by an occurrence that's difficult\nto dismiss with a shrug.\n\nYou can either turn morbid and brood about it, or rise superior to it\nand pigeon-hole it, at least for the moment. By a kind of miracle I was\nable to pigeon-hole it, to keep it from standing in the way of what\nI'd made up my mind to do before I'd heard the rustling in the foliage\ndirectly overhead.\n\nI walked back and forth for a moment, resting most of my weight on my\nright leg, to make sure I could keep using it without limping and when\nI was satisfied a long walk wouldn't be in the least painful I left the\nembankment with a feeling of relief and took the first turn on my left.\nI was pretty sure it would take me no more than twenty minutes to get\nback to the spaceport.\n\nI knew that what I'd made up my mind to do wasn't going to be easy.\nI had to find out exactly how important a job the Colonization Board\nhad mapped out for me on Mars. She'd called me \"Mr. Important Man\"\nbecause--you don't get a clearance stamped the way mine was unless\nthere's a big undertaking in store for you which has to be handled\nin just the right way. The walk gave me a chance to think about it.\nMy leg didn't trouble me at all and I was very grateful for that....\nI stood for a moment just outside the spaceport's railed-off,\nelectronically-protected launching platforms, staring up at the\nthree-hundred-foot passenger rockets gleaming with a dull metallic\nluster in the moonlight, their nose-cones pointing skyward.\n\nThe New Chicago Spaceport has and always will attract sightseers,\nbecause there's no other rocket launching site on Earth that can\ncompare with it. It's not only the largest and the most elaborately\nequipped. It was built to last. Fifty years from now, in 2070, say, it\nwas a safe bet the big Mars rockets would be taking off at four-hour\nintervals night and day. Now they took off only twice a month and there\nwere fifty million people in the United States alone who would have\ngiven up comfort, leisure, a well-paying job and every joy they'd ever\nexperienced or could hope to experience on Earth to be on one of those\nbig sky ships.\n\nAs far back as I can remember I'd hated to force a showdown with people\nwho trusted me and believed in me. And that went double for the Martian\nColonization Board, whose members were doing everything possible to\nkeep me informed. Secrecy sometimes has to be imposed, and if you\ntry to crack an information clamp-down prematurely you deserve to be\nslapped down.\n\nBut now I had no choice. I had to find out if my trip could be\npostponed, if I could wait one more week--a month, even--to get Joan to\nsee things my way. And that meant I had to find out just how big a job\nthey had lined up for me.\n\nI had no trouble getting in to see him. There was a guard at the main\nentrance of the Administration Building, and when I identified myself\nand the massive, double-doors swung inward I had to go through it a\nsecond time, and six more times in all before I reached his private\noffice on the twentieth floor. But you couldn't call it trouble,\nbecause all I had to do was take out my wallet and display the pale\nblue card that was only an incitement to violence in certain quarters.\n\nIn that massive, almost half-mile-long building, on every floor, there\nwere guards who knew me and guards who had never set eyes on me before.\nBut what that card stood for was treated with respect.\n\nI'd known that building to hum with activity, to come to life with a\nroar. But now only one floor blazed with light and the rest of the\nbuilding was as silent as a mausoleum.\n\nIt happens sometimes and when it does everyone is grateful--including\nthe man I'd come to visit.\n\nHis private office was at the end of a long corridor in Section C 10\nY, and I knew I'd find him there, because a small circle of cold light\nhad been glowing above the office listing board on the main floor.\nThere was a name plate above the numbered listings--BROWN. His name\nwasn't Brown, of course. Or Smith, or Jones. The \"Brown\" was just a\nsafety precaution--the sign and seal of immense power being modest in a\ngenuine way and for expediency's sake as well.\n\nNo man without the kind of card I carried had ever gotten as far as\nthat office listing board and I doubt if the most ingenious assassin\nwould have cared to try. But it was just as well to be on the\ncompletely safe side.\n\nA saluting guard stepped back and what was perhaps the narrowest, least\nimpressive door in the entire building opened and closed and I found\nmyself in his presence.\n\nUnless you're a Gobi desert dweller or live in the precise middle of\nthe Sahara you've seen the blue-eyed, mild-mannered little man who was\nJonathan Trilling on a hundred lighted screens. In all respects but one\nhe is the kind of man most people would go right past on the street\nwithout a second glance.\n\nThe thing that made him really not like that at all was something you\ncouldn't pin down and analyze. If you tried, you'd get nowhere. But it\nwas there, all right, an emanation you couldn't mistake that stamped\nhim for what he was, radiating out from him.\n\nEquate immense simplicity with immense power and you might come up with\na part of the answer. But not all of it.\n\nThe office was stripped of all non-essentials; a hermit's cell couldn't\nhave been barer. And it seemed to please him when my eyes swept over\nthe almost bare desk, with just an inkwell and a single sheet of paper\non it, before coming to rest on his face.\n\nI'm pretty sure he interpreted it as an indication that I was trying to\ncatch him up on something he took pride in, and he admired me for it,\nand greeted me with a chuckle.\n\n\"Well, Ralph!\" he said. \"I didn't expect to see you here tonight. I\nthought you'd be home wearing Joan's patience ragged with the kind of\nlast-minute preparations women never seem to understand. They like to\nthink they never forget anything. But they do. They're worse that way\nthan we are, but just try getting them to admit it.\"\n\nThere was only one chair in the office and he was occupying it. I\nhardly expected him to get up and wave me toward it, but that's\nprecisely what he did.\n\n\"Sit down, Ralph,\" he said. \"I sit too much. We all do here, I guess.\nCan't be helped, but it doesn't give a man of fifty-five much chance\nto get the exercise he ought to have, if he's going to keep his weight\ndown.\"\n\n\"No--don't get up for me, sir!\" I said, then realized I was being\nunnecessarily formal.\n\nThe chair was empty and he expected me to take it. And I could see that\nhe didn't like the \"sir.\" He never had.\n\n\"Sit down, sit down. What is it, Ralph? Something worrying you? You'll\nhave plenty of time for that when you get to Mars. Why start now?\"\n\nI decided to come right out with it. I favored bluntness as much as he\ndid, and there was nothing to be gained by talking around what I'd have\nto ask him before I left.\n\n\"There's something I'd like to know,\" I said. \"Is the major part of my\nassignment still under wraps, or could you tell me more about it--even\nif you'd prefer not to?\"\n\nHe looked at me steadily for a moment, his lips tightening a little.\n\"Well--I certainly haven't kept it a complete secret, Ralph. You'll\nget full instructions in code later on. There's naturally a reason for\nthat. I shouldn't have to go into it, because we've discussed it at\ngreat length right here in this office.\"\n\n\"I realize that,\" I said. \"But could you see your way clear to telling\nme much more than you have, if I can convince you that it would help me\nsolve a problem I can't solve otherwise.\"\n\nHis eyebrows went up a little at that. \"What kind of problem, Ralph?\"\n\n\"It's as old as the hills,\" I said. \"The really ancient kind with\nfossils embedded in them. It goes right back to the Old Stone Age,\nand maybe a lot earlier. Joan doesn't want to go to Mars. She's very\nstubborn, very determined about it. If I can't make her change her mind\nI'll have to go alone. And I guess I don't have to tell you what that\nwould do to me. If I just had a little more time, another week or two--\"\n\n\"So that's it,\" he said. \"You want me to tell you that your assignment\ncan be put off, that you're not really needed on Mars. We're just\nsending you there because we like to do whimsical things occasionally,\nto break the God-awful monotony of thinking about the problems the\nproject is confronted with in a serious way.\"\n\nI was startled, because I'd never known him to indulge in deliberate\nirony before. He had all the intellectual equipment for it, but his\nmind just didn't work that way.\n\nThen I suddenly realized he was going to tell me everything I wanted\nto know and had just used that approach to make me a little angry and\nkeep me alert and analytical, so that I wouldn't underestimate the\nseriousness of what he was about to say.\n\n\"All right, Ralph,\" he said. \"I'll risk angering a third of the Board.\nI'm going to tell you exactly why the Mars Colony is in trouble, and\njust how tremendous your task will be. You'll be in the middle, Ralph,\nin the biggest clash of interests a new and growing society has ever\nknown.\n\n\"A clash of interests can destroy any society, if they're violent\nenough and have powerful enough backing and the population is divided\nin its loyalties and lacks firm and courageous leadership.\n\n\"That's especially true if the society is on a pioneering level, with\nserious scarcities developing everywhere and with every man, to some\nextent at least, in fierce competition with his neighbors, all apart\nfrom the massive power monopolies that are in even fiercer competition\namong themselves.\n\n\"Don't you see, Ralph, don't you realize what that kind of\ncross-purpose distribution of power in a new and pioneering society\ncan mean? When you have a three or four-way conflict, when everyone\nis bidding for what you've got and can't afford to sell, or what you\nhaven't got but would like to sell, or what you can't sell for what\nyou'd like to get?\"\n\nHe smiled suddenly, for the barest instant, and then the seriously\nconcerned look which the smile had replaced came back into his eyes.\n\"I didn't intend that to sound facetious. It probably did, because it\nhas a slightly humorous side to it, like most major tragedies. I'm just\ngiving you the broad outlines now, the general situation. Frustration,\nbitterness, thousands of colonists who can be swayed one way or the\nother by corrupt pressures, self-interest, greedy power monopolies.\"\n\n\"But there's a more specific situation you have in mind, is that it?\" I\nasked. \"Everything you've just said is common knowledge.\"\n\nTrilling nodded. \"Yes--but the general situation has to be underscored.\nIt is the crucial factor in everything that is taking place on Mars. In\na more stable, and highly developed society the raw power conflict of\nthe two major power monopolies would not take so destructive a form.\"\n\n\"Two?\" I said. \"I was under the impression--\"\n\nHe waved my objection aside. \"Oh, there are a dozen power combines.\nBut only the two giants--Wendel Atomics and Endicott Fuel--have fought\neach other to a standstill and threaten the peace, and stability of\nthe entire colony. I'm putting it too mildly. There's an explosive\npotential in that conflict that could destroy the colony overnight.\"\n\nHe tightened his lips and took a turn up and down the office, then\ncame back to where I was sitting and gripped me by the shoulder.\n\"Ralph, listen. This is vital. I'll try to sum it up as briefly as\npossible. You know what it cost to set up atomic generators, turbines,\ntransmission lines, and keep utilities no city can do without in\noperation right here in New Chicago, in just one small section of the\ncity? How much more do you think it costs to do the same thing on Mars?\nThe transportation of materials alone--Have you any idea how much the\ntotal expenditures come to?\"\n\n\"I guess so,\" I said. \"I don't like to think about it.\"\n\n\"Who does? But we had to think about it. We had to give Wendel Atomics\na thirty-year monopoly. No other power combine had sufficient monetary\nresources to undertake it. And we had to give Endicott Fuel the same\nkind of monopoly. They transport both atomic and liquid fuels at a cost\nthat would turn your hair white.\"\n\n\"And now you say they're locked in a power conflict. But why? I should\nthink Wendel Atomics would purchase all the fuel it needs directly from\nEndicott. And Endicott would--\"\n\nI paused, troubled.\n\n\"What would Endicott do, Ralph? It has no use for atomic generators.\nIt isn't geared to install them, even if it could somehow absorb the\nterrific expense of transporting them. And that, of course, would be\nimpossible. No combine is wealthy enough to undertake that kind of\ntwo-pronged enterprise.\"\n\n\"But it wouldn't have to be a two-way exchange of commodities,\" I said.\n\"Not if Wendel continued to buy all of its fuel from Endicott. It\nwould, of course, have a tendency to dwarf Endicott, make it the lesser\nof the two monopolies.\"\n\n\"It would do more than that, Ralph. It could bankrupt Endicott. You\nsee, Wendel Atomics suddenly decided it was paying Endicott too much\nfor the fuel it used, and cut the price it was paying in half. And\nEndicott could barely meet expenses.\"\n\n\"Good Lord,\" I said.\n\n\"Naturally Wendel Atomics couldn't get along without fuel,\" Trilling\nsaid. \"And it couldn't transport fuel for its own exclusive use from\nEarth. The two-pronged enterprise factor again. So Endicott struck back\nby refusing to sell its fuel to Wendel.\"\n\n\"A complete stalemate, you mean?\"\n\n\"Not quite, Ralph. If it were, one side or the other would have to give\nin eventually. Endicott seized on the bright idea of selling atomic and\nliquid fuel directly to the Colonists. A wildcat kind of madness. The\ncolonists buy the fuel on margin and wait for the price to skyrocket.\nAnd every so often it does, because Wendel has to keep its generators\noperating. It won't buy from Endicott, but it has no choice but to buy\nfrom the colonists.\n\n\"Do you realize what such wild and dangerous wildcat speculation can\ndo to a new, rough-and-tumble, frontier kind of society, Ralph? The\ncolonists don't know whether they're rich or poor from one day to\nthe next. And with all their desperate needs, their frustrations,\ntheir scrambling after scarce goods and services, their fierce\ncompetitiveness, they are at each other's throats half of the time.\"\n\n\"I'm beginning to get the picture,\" I said.\n\n\"It's a very ugly picture, Ralph. Wendel Atomics buys its fuel\nsporadically, cheats, steals, connives, beating the price down\nartificially and then sending it skyrocketing again. It has its own\nprivate police force. Translate--brutal roughnecks who know exactly how\nto keep the colonists in line and frighten them into selling when the\nfuel market sags and spending every cent they possess to buy more fuel\non speculation when the price soars.\n\n\"Endicott doesn't care what happens to the colonists. It's out to make\nWendel Atomics come to terms and has methods of its own to keep the\ncolonists inflamed and reckless. The whole situation has even taken\non a political cast. There are pro-Wendel colonists, who work hand in\nglove with the Wendel police and colonists who would willingly lay down\ntheir lives in defense of noble, altruistic Endicott. It's the right of\neveryone to buy fuel on speculation, isn't it?\"\n\n\"I see,\" I said. \"And my job will be to step right into the middle of\nall that, and try to bring order out of chaos.\"\n\nTrilling didn't say anything for a moment. He just looked at me, but\nhis gaze was not unsympathetic.\n\n\"There's something I'd like to have you hear, Ralph,\" he said, when the\nsilence had lengthened between us and become almost minute-long. \"We\nhave a new, round-the-clock recording to replace the one we've been\ntransmitting at intervals, night and day, for five years. I won't even\nask you how many times you've heard it, because you travel around a lot\nand must have memorized it word for word. But this one is better, I\nthink. At least, it appeals to me more. A hundred million people will\nhear it, starting tomorrow. It will be on every tele-screen.\"\n\nHe bent over his desk and removed a miniature tape-recorder from the\nupper right hand drawer. He set it down on the desk and clicked it on.\n\n\"Just one passage I'd like you to listen to, Ralph. Not the whole\nrecording. This is it--\"\n\nThe voice that came from the tape was a very good reading voice, one\nof the best I'd ever heard. The man was probably a poet. But the words\nthemselves interested me more.\n\n\"... so bright with promise has Man's future become that all of the old\nanimosities, the old hates, will soon seem alien to us and strange. A\nnew world is in the making. Who can deny it? The colonization of Mars\nhas fulfilled the deepest instincts of Man's nature, and provided scope\nfor a growth that is as natural to him as breathing.\n\n\"The desire to know more, to explore the unknown, to reach out toward\nconstantly expanding horizons can only be satisfied by boldly accepting\nwhat the advance of modern science has brought within our grasp. The\ncolonization of Mars is a tribute to Man's stubborn refusal to be\neasily discouraged or to let mechanical difficulties, no matter how\nformidable, stand in his way. A tribute as well to his constructive\ngenius, his daring and breadth of vision.\"\n\nTrilling clicked the tape recorder off, returned it to his desk, and\nturned to face me again.\n\n\"That, Ralph, is the dream,\" he said. \"You and I know what the reality\nis like. But the millions who will listen to that recording do not.\nThey still believe--and hope.\"\n\nI was silent for a moment, not quite sure how he'd take what I was\ngoing to say. I went over it in my mind, searching for just the right\nwords. It took me a full minute to find them, but he didn't grow\nimpatient.\n\n\"I'm not sure the Board is wise in putting out that kind of propaganda.\nOr any kind of propaganda. After all, we're not trying to sell Mars to\nanyone. We're doing something that has to be done--you might almost\nsay we're just trying, in a very earnest way, to plug up a gap in the\nbiggest dam that was ever built, to keep the flood waters from carrying\nus all to destruction.\"\n\n\"You're wrong, Ralph,\" he said. \"It isn't just propaganda. A dream\nalways has to go striding on ahead of reality. It may seem strange to\nyou, but the reality does not frighten or discourage me. Mars is a new\nworld and on a new world there has to be--not one, but many beginnings.\"\n\nHe paused an instant, then added: \"That's why we're sending you to\nMars, Ralph. There will have to be another beginning. It won't show\ntoo much on the surface. No matter how successful you are, for the\ncolony will remain what it is basically--an experiment in survival.\nAll of a new world's energy will remain, and the turbulence and the\nhard-to-endure disappointments. But you can help the Colonists go\nback, and feel the way they did when the first passenger rocket settled\ndown on the red desert sand forty million miles from Earth and the\nSpace Age took on a new dimension.\"\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nThere was only one small window in Trilling's office. But I could see\nthat the sky outside was still bright with stars, and the glimmer of\nthe ceiling lamp made the metal surface above us seem to fall away and\ndissolve into a much wider expanse of star-studded space.\n\nThe ceiling-mirrored image of the lamp itself looked like the Sun,\nblazing in noonday brightness directly overhead and out beyond were\ngalaxies and super-galaxies strung like beads on a wire across the\ngreat curve of the universe.\n\nIt was just an illusion, of course. You could see the same thing in the\nlight-mirroring depths of a glass of wine, if you stared hard enough.\nBut for an instant it seemed to bring bigness, vastness right into the\nroom with us.\n\nI was conscious of the silence again, lengthening, hanging heavy\nbetween us, as if we'd each said too much, or possibly ... not quite\nenough.\n\nThen Trilling bent and removed something else from his desk. I couldn't\nsee what it was until he set it down directly in front of me, because\nit was much smaller than the midget tape recorder and his hand covered\nit.\n\nA flat metal box, wafer-thin, doesn't provide much scope for\nspeculation, and I was pretty sure that the object inside was a tiny\nmetal precision instrument or a watch or a medal even before he said:\n\"This should make Joan change her mind, Ralph!\" and snapped the box\nopen.\n\nThe insignia caught and held the light, a two-inch silver hawk with its\nwings outspread. The white lining of the box made it stand out, as if\nit were flying through fleecy clouds high in the sky, and symboling in\nits flight far more than just the elevation of one man to the highest\ncommand post the Martian Colonization Board had the authority to bestow.\n\nThe significance of that finely-wrought, seldom-worn silver bird\nwas not lost on me. In the maze of a hundred legends, a hundred\nwitness-confirmed stories of triumph and disappointment, of heroic\nprogress and tragic back-tracking, it had remained an important link\nbetween Earthside expectations and what was actually taking place on\nMars.\n\nOnly one man could wear it at any one time, and only four men had worn\nit since the establishment of the colony. All four were dead now, their\ngravestones a white gleaming on the red desert sand a few miles north\nof the colony.\n\n\"Well, Ralph?\" Trilling said.\n\nI tried hard to maintain my composure, to say just the right thing,\nbecause I'd lived long enough to know there are depths beyond depths to\nsome emotions that can't be put into words. Attempt to talk the way you\nfeel, and you're sure to sound a little ridiculous. I was only certain\nof one thing. No man could wear that insignia and not feel, resting\nupon his shoulders, a responsibility so tremendous that whatever pride\nhe might take in it would have to be tempered by humility--if he wanted\nto go on wearing it for long.\n\nTrilling seemed aware of what was passing through my mind, for he made\nit easy for me. He simply smiled, snapped the box shut with a briskness\nthat was almost casual, and handed it to me.\n\n\"You've got real massive military prestige now, Ralph,\" he said. \"Right\nat the moment the Board would be gravely concerned if you wore that\ninsignia in public. But there's nothing to prevent you from wearing\nit in the privacy of your own home. Later on the Board may decide you\ncan accomplish more by coming right out and letting the colonists know\nthere's a lion in the streets who intends to do more than just roar.\nA safe, protective kind of lion--dangerous only to over-ambitious men\nwith destructive ideas.\"\n\nI started to reply but he waved me to silence. \"Hold on, Ralph--let me\nfinish. You won't be wearing that insignia in public straight off. But\nI hope you'll have enough good sense to make the best possible use of\nit to overcome the first really big obstacle in your path.\"\n\nHe nodded. \"It will be a kind of blackmail, in a way--morally\nreprehensible. You'll be taking advantage of something it isn't in a\nwoman's nature to resist. But you have no choice. You've got to go to\nMars and if you went alone you'd be about as useful to us as a celibate\nkangaroo, all packaged and ready to be sent on a journey to the\ntaxidermist.\"\n\nHe seemed to realize it wouldn't have to be quite that drastic, for\nhe grimaced wryly. \"All right, all right. You could go out and find\nanother woman and I probably could talk the Board into being the\nopposite of stuffy about it. But I happen to know what kind of man you\nare, and how you feel about Joan. I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure\nshe's the only woman in the world for you.\"\n\nThere was nothing I could say to that. I had the insignia in my\ninner breast pocket, and I knew that there were few obstacles it\ncouldn't blast away on Earth or on Mars, if I kept remembering what it\nsymbolized with Joan at my side.\n\nI went out into the cool night again, past that long tremendous\nbuilding with just one of its floors ablaze, past the big sky ships\nlooming like sentinel ghosts on their launching pads, past winking\nlights and speeding cars and pedestrians walking slowly and something\ninside of me made me feel I'd undergone a kind of sea change, and could\nface whatever the future might hold without grabbing for a life-line\nthat didn't exist.\n\nIt was a good way to feel. A man had to sink or swim without having\na life-line thrown to him--if he hoped to live long enough to change\nthings around in an important way on Mars. He had to keep his head and\nbreast the raging currents with the sturdiest kind of overhand strokes,\nor be drawn down into the undertow and battered senseless against the\nrocks that lined the shoreline.\n\nThe change must have shown a little on the surface, in the set of\nmy jaw or just the way I was walking, because no less than three\npedestrians turned to stare at me as I went striding past them on my\nway to the New Chicago Underground.\n\nI was almost at the northern entrance of the big, tree-lined square\ndirectly opposite the Administration Building when it hit me--the\nmemory-recall, the swift emergence from its cubby-hole deep in my mind\nof the narrow brush I'd had with Death and hadn't even discussed with\nTrilling.\n\nIt had been a mistake not to discuss it, because it concerned the Board\nas much as it did me. Someone who knew about the insignia--or had made\na shrewd guess as to just how big a job was awaiting me on Mars--had\nwanted me dead. The attempt on my life took on a much larger, more\ncrucial dimension when viewed in that light.\n\nThere were three hundred million people in the United States, and if\nI'd been just a private citizen, with no more than my own safety at\nstake, I could have lost myself in that immense ocean of humanity for\na week or a month and gained a brief respite. There are plenty of ways\nyou can protect yourself against a surprise attempt on your life, if\nyou have the time to take safety precautions. When there's a would-be\nassassin at large who is dead set on measuring you for a coffin you\nhave to work the problem out carefully, with a minimum of risk.\n\nIt takes skill and psychological insight, but it can be done. You've\njust got to remember that an assassin is never quite normal. Even when\na socio-political motivation is the governing passion of his life\nyou're one jump ahead of him the instant you've figured out exactly how\nhis mind works.\n\nIn fact, one of those safety precautions could have been protecting me\nas I crossed the square, if I hadn't let my stubborn pride stand in the\nway. Why hadn't I asked Trilling to provide me with armed protection?\n\nTwo alert bodyguards, trailing me on the street and down into the\nUnderground and standing watch outside my apartment all night long--and\nstaying fifty paces behind me until the Mars' rocket zero-count ended\nand the big sky ship took off with a roar ... would have given the\nBoard the kind of reassurance they had a right to expect.\n\nI started to turn back, then changed my mind abruptly. I'd taken just\nas great a risk by walking from the lakeside to the skyport right after\nthe attack, hadn't I? And I'd be in the Underground in another three or\nfour minutes, with people around me and--\n\nAll right. It was an out-of-focus rationalization and nothing more--an\nattempt to find an excuse for not turning back. But when I do something\nreckless for complicated reasons, when I've forged ahead despite\nmy better judgment, I'm usually just impulsive enough to carry the\nfolly-ball all the way across the goal line.\n\nIt was the thing I'd have to guard most against on Mars, that\ndamnable twisted pride and impulsiveness, that taking of too much for\ngranted when I started to do something I knew was unwise, but had an\noverpowering urge to carry out anyway.\n\nEvery weaving shadow beneath the double row of trees that towered\non both sides of me could have cloaked a crouching figure adjusting\nanother small mechanical killer to the deadliest possible angle of\nflight. But I had another reason for not wanting to go back. Trilling\nmight fall in with the armed guard idea but I doubted it like hell.\nI could picture him saying instead: \"Ralph, even an armed car can be\nblown up. You're staying under lock and key all night ... right here in\nthe Administration Building.\"\n\nI could even picture him saying much the same thing to Joan, her image\nbright enough on his office tele-screen to be visible from where I'd be\nstanding: \"He's not coming home tonight, Joan. We're sending an armored\ncar to pick you up in the morning. Wait, hold on--I'll let you talk to\nhim!\"\n\nAnd I could almost hear her replying: \"Don't bother to send the car.\nI'm not going with him. Please don't think too harshly of me, please\ntry to understand. I just can't--\"\n\nI started down the long boulevard on the far side of the square, still\nwalking rapidly and feeling suddenly confident I'd been justified\nin not turning back. I could see the entrance to the Underground\nglimmering in the darkness a hundred feet ahead of me and there were\npeople all around me walking in both directions. I wasn't even troubled\nby the feeling that everyone gets at times--that something terrible and\nunexpected can happen right in the midst of a crowd, if only because\nthe presence of many people exposes you to a dangerously wide range of\nunpredictable human emotions.\n\nFor the barest instant, when I crossed the narrow strip of pavement\ndirectly in front of the kiosk, fear tugged at my nerves and I felt\nmyself growing tense. But I became calm again the moment I looked\naround and saw that the only pedestrian within thirty feet of me was a\nhurrying girl with a portfolio under her arm. When she saw how intently\nI was staring at her she frowned and a look of annoyance came into her\neyes.\n\nOh, for God's sake, I told myself, get rid of this nagging uncertainty,\nand stop behaving like a fool. If he intended to try again tonight I'd\nknow by now. He's missed a dozen very good chances, so something must\nbe making him super-cautious, if he hasn't keeled over just from the\nstrain of watching me refuse to die. Killing's never easy, even for a\nprofessional. It must be a little like being cut open, watching your\nown blood pouring out of you, because all violence inflicts a two-way\ntrauma ... severe enough at times to make even a mad slayer fling down\nhis gun before going on a rampage of indiscriminate slaughter.\n\nThere were arguments I could have used to wrap it up even tighter--such\nas the way he'd be trapped and blasted down almost instantly if he\nlaunched another attack on me so close to the spaceport's three\ninterlocking, hyper-sensitive security alert systems.\n\nBut I didn't even pause to weigh them, because right up to that minute\nI'd done very well, and the fear which had come upon me had been as\nbrief as an autumnal flurry of wind when you're coming around a tall\nbuilding at breakneck speed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI let the girl dart past me, taking my time, and in another five\nseconds was descending into the big, brightly lighted cavern that was\nNew Chicago's intercity pride.\n\nAs every school kid knows, the New Chicago Underground is six years\nold, and is the largest, smoothest-running transportation system in the\nworld. It cost seven billion dollars to build and has almost as many\ntracks and suburban off-shoots as station guards.\n\nIt interlocks, spirals outward in a half dozen directions and\ncircles back upon itself. In a way, it's like the serpent you see\nin bas-reliefs dating back three thousand years, in Babylonian and\nPre-Dynastic Egyptian tombs, for instance, or on totem poles in the\nNorthwest ... a serpent that's continually swallowing its own tail.\nIt's the oldest archeological art-form on Earth and is supposed to\nsymbolize Eternal Life.\n\nBut to some people at least the New Chicago Underground symbolizes\nsomething far more gloomy. If you're not careful to board just the\nright train you can get lost in its tomblike, spiraling immensity and\nfeel as helpless as a wandering ghost or an experimental laboratory\nanimal caught up in a blind maze. You can be carried fifty miles\nin the wrong direction and look out through the windows of a train\ntraveling at half the speed of sound, and see a country landscape or\nthe wide sweep of Lake Michigan five minutes after you've settled down\nin a comfortable chair and become absorbed in the news of the day on\nmicro-film.\n\nYou'll stare out and the section of the city where your home is located\njust won't be sweeping past. You'll have to get off at the next\nstation, perhaps twenty or thirty miles further on, ride back, and\nboard another train. It's seldom quite as frustrating as that, but only\nbecause most of the riders have been conditioned to keep their wits\nabout them through a nightmare kind of trial-and-error apprenticeship.\n\nYou've got to stay alert until you've boarded a train with just the\nright combination of numerals on its destination plate. It isn't hard\nto do, unless you're carrying a tiny silver hawk in a wafer-thin\ncase, and your destination may be changed without warning and with\nunbelievable infamy by someone capable of great evil who would much\nprefer not to have you board a train at all.\n\nI could almost picture him weaving in and out between the platform\ncrowds--faceless so far, but quite possibly glassy-eyed with little\nwaltzing death-heads in the depth of his pupils. An unknown human\ncipher intent on my destruction, refusing to be discouraged by the\nfailure of a small mechanical killer to do the job for him.\n\nIf I'd had a strong reason to believe I actually was being followed, if\nhe'd come right out into the open and I could have caught a glimpse of\nhim, however brief, I'd have felt a subconscious relief that would have\nkept me on guard and confident. It would have given me an edge that not\neven the fact that I had no gun could have taken away from me.\n\nIt's the unknown and unpredictable that's unnerving, the realization\nthat invisible eyes may be scrutinizing you from a distance and the\nbrain behind them deciding that it would be a great mistake to let a\nfailure of nerve or concern for the consequences interfere with what\nhad to be done.\n\nHe wouldn't be wanting me to wear that insignia ever--on Earth or on\nMars--and just knowing that made me almost miss my train as it came\nrushing toward me.\n\nThe train was so crowded I had to stand, but I had no complaint on\nthat score. In a seat, with people jamming the aisle in front of me,\nI'd have been wedged in even more securely. In a standing position I\ncould edge forward and back and keep an eye on the passengers who were\nholding fast to the horizontal support rail on both sides of me.\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nThere were twenty-five or thirty passengers wedged into the middle\nsection of the train, all standing in slightly cramped postures and\nmost of them unsmiling. I knew exactly how they felt. Not being able\nto get a seat in an off-hour in the evening can be irritating. But\nright at the moment there was no room in my mind for annoyance. A\nslow, hard-to-pin-down uneasiness was creeping over me again, as if a\npendulum were swinging back and forth somewhere close to me, ticking\nout a warning in rhythm--and I couldn't shut out the sound of it.\n\nJust my over-strained nerves, of course. How could it have been\nanything else? I turned and looked at the man standing next to me. He\nwas middle-aged, conservatively dressed, and had a square-jawed, rather\nhandsome face, with a dusting of gray at his temples.\n\nHe was frowning slightly and his expression didn't change when I broke\nthe rule of silence which was customarily observed in the Underground.\n\n\"No reason for all the seats to be gone at this hour,\" I said.\n\nThe crazy kind of over-exuberance mixed with peevishness that makes\nsome people say things like that to total strangers a dozen times a day\nhad always seemed inexcusable to me. But when you're under tension you\nsometimes break all the habits of rational behavior you've imposed on\nyourself in small matters.\n\nMy excuse was that I simply wanted to test the firmness and steadiness\nof my own voice, to make sure that, deep down, I wasn't nearly as\napprehensive as I was beginning to feel.\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" the gray-templed man agreed. \"It burns me up a little\ntoo. But I guess it just can't be helped at times. Operating an\nUnderground this size must be an awful train-scheduling headache.\"\n\n\"Headache or not,\" I said. \"There's no excuse for it.\"\n\nHe smiled abruptly, exposing large, white teeth and I noticed that\nthere was something almost birdlike in the way his eyes lighted up.\nSmall, black, very bright eyes they were, under short-lashed lids, and\nquite suddenly he made me think of a magpie alighting on a limb, taking\noff and alighting again, hardly able to restrain an impulse to chatter.\n\n\"What it boils down to,\" he said, \"is the old quarrel between a\npedestrian and a man in a car. Neither can understand or sympathize\nwith the other's point of view. Fifteen million people ride this\nUnderground every day and to them it's a poor slob's service at best.\nThat's because they feel themselves to be the victims, at the receiving\nend. But you've got to remember that safety precautions pose a problem.\nAvoiding accidents comes first and the New Chicago Transportation\nSystem, considering its colossal size, does pretty well in that\nrespect.\"\n\n\"People have been killed,\" I said, and could have bitten my tongue\nout. Why let him even suspect that I was thinking about something that\nwasn't tied in with his argument at all, why give him the slightest\nhint? The Underground's accident record was good and couldn't have\njustified such cynicism on my part. And just suppose he wasn't the\ngarrulous, middle-aged business man he appeared to be--\n\nA very sinister game can start in just that way, with everything\nfavoring the alerted party until he lets the other know that he's on\nhis guard and is having uneasy thoughts. That's where the danger lies,\nin a subconscious betrayal, a slip of the tongue that will precipitate\nviolence faster than it would ordinarily occur.\n\nIf a killer feels that he must move swiftly, before suspicion can\nbecome a certainty, the odds shift in his favor. He has the advantage\nof surprise. He becomes alerted too, and necessity acts as a goad--a\nkind of trigger-mechanism. He'll act more quickly and decisively,\nwithout the careful planning that may prompt him to talk too much and\ngive himself away.\n\nHe'll take risks that are dangerous and could destroy him, strike\nwith witnesses present and all escape routes blocked. If he has to,\nhe'll strike even in a crowded Underground train with the next station\nminutes away. And that kind of audacity sometimes pays off.\n\nI told myself that I was imagining things, jumping to a completely\nunwarranted conclusion. The conversation of the man next to me was\nexactly what you'd expect from a magpie. He was carefully sidestepping\nall realistic appraisals of the Underground's shortcomings, trying his\nbest to look at the problem from all sides, even if it meant being\nshallow and over-optimistic. He was the citizen with a smiling face,\nthe rather likeable guy--why should one hold it against him?--who was\ntrying his best to be fair to everybody, even if he had to burst a\nblood-vessel doing it.\n\nRealizing all that made me feel less tense and part of the nightmare\nfeeling I'd been experiencing went away. But not quite all of it and\nwhen the train passed into an unlighted tunnel and the aisle went dark\napprehension began to mount in me again.\n\nWhat if he was putting on an act, and wasn't the kind of man he\nappeared to be at all? What does a killer look like? Certainly age had\nnothing to do with it. He can be young or old--eighteen or seventy-five.\n\nHis appearance, his clothes? There were wild-eyed killers with \"psycho\"\nstamped all over them, and dignified, soberly-dressed men who looked no\ndifferent from your next door neighbor and had criminal records a yard\nlong, including, in all likelihood, a murder or two the Law would have\na difficult time proving.\n\nI didn't have to speculate about it. I _knew_, because I'd done more\nthan my share of social research. There was nothing to prevent a man of\ndistinction from becoming a killer, if he had a secret life that was\nugly and devious and a powerful enough motive.\n\nBut now he was talking again, despite the darkness, and I was listening\nwith my nerves on edge. I was completely in the dark as to why\nsomething about him had set the alarm bells ringing but I was sure I\ncould hear them, very faint and distant this time, but clearly enough.\nIt was funny. Sometimes it meant something and sometimes it didn't. I\ncould feel that danger was hovering right at my elbow and in the end\ndiscover I'd been completely mistaken.\n\nI hoped I was mistaken this time, but I knew there was a\npossibility--remote, perhaps, but dangerous to ignore--that the man\nwho had set the small mechanical killer in motion by the Lakeside had\nfollowed me from the Administration Building into the Underground and\nwas standing by my side.\n\n\"You take one of the really big power combines,\" he was saying.\n\"Like, say, Wendel Atomics. It has its defenders and detractors, and\nI daresay there are quite a few people who would be happy to see its\nBoard of Directors behind bars. I'm not defending the Wendel monopoly,\nunderstand. If I was a Martian colonist I might feel quite differently\nabout it. But you've got to remember that when you give the go-ahead\nsignal for a project that big you're asking fifty or a hundred key\nexecutives to do the impossible--or pretty close to the impossible.\"\n\n\"The impossible?\" I said, trying to sound no more than mildly\ninterested, because I didn't want him to suspect what a jolt his\nmention of Wendel Atomics had given me.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" he went on. \"That's what it boils down to. Every one of\nthose men will be as human as you or I. They'll react in highly\nindividual ways to every problem that comes up, every frustration,\nevery serious interference with their private lives. You've got to\nremember that a man's private life is the most important thing in the\nworld--to him personally. Every one of those fifty or a hundred men\nwill have health worries, money worries, love life worries, every kind\nof worry you can think of. And on Mars worries can pile up.\"\n\n\"So I've heard,\" I said.\n\n\"Well, that's all. That sums it up. I'm simply citing Wendel as an\nexample of what the New Chicago Transportation System is up against.\nI'd say, in general, that most of the directors are doing their best,\nwhen the Old Adam in them isn't in the driver's seat, to keep the\ntrains running on schedule.\"\n\nHe stopped talking abruptly. I didn't think anything of it for a\nmoment, for a loquacious man will often pause in the middle of a\nconversation to wonder what kind of dent he's been making on the party\nwho's doing most of the listening. But when a full minute passed and\nthe darkness held, and he didn't say a word, when I couldn't even hear\nhim breathing, I began to grow uneasy.\n\nReach out and touch him? Well, why not? It was the simplest, quickest\nway of finding out whether he was still at my side and he could hardly\nbe offended if my hand grazed his elbow in a jostling motion that would\nseem accidental.\n\nIt was very strange. I didn't think he was the man I'd feared he might\nbe any longer, because of what he'd said, because he had brought Wendel\nAtomics into the conversation. If he'd _had_ designs on my life giving\nhis hand away like that would have been the height of folly. It would\nhave been like giving me cards and spades, and a detailed history of\nhis activities for the past five years.\n\nIt didn't take any gifted reasoning to figure that out and I didn't\npride myself on it. Even a child could have done it. What disturbed me\nand kept me from feeling relieved was something quite different. The\nalarm bells were still ringing. _They were still ringing._\n\nLouder now and with a dirgelike persistence, as if I was already dead\nand buried. And neither a child nor a grown man could have figured that\none out.\n\nThat's why I felt I had to reach out and touch him, had to start him\ntalking again ... had to be sure he was still there at my side.\n\nHe was there, all right. He was there in the most alarming possible\nway, as a dead weight lurching against me, then swaying and screaming\nas I tried to straighten him up, and stop the terrible downward drag of\nhis sagging body.\n\nHe was sinking lower and lower, clutching at my knees now, refusing\nto take advantage of the support I was offering him. I strained and\ntugged, but it was no use. He was too heavy to raise and I could hear\nthe breath wheezing out of his throat and there could be no mistaking\nthe weight of horror that was making him twist and writhe as he\nsagged--the deadliness of whatever it was that had struck at him in the\ndarkness without making a sound.\n\nHe screamed again. It was the kind of agonized protest which could only\nhave come from the throat of a man who hardly knew what was happening\nto him ... a man with his terror heightened and made more acute by\nthe awful, groping-in-the-dark realization that he was experiencing a\ntorment he was powerless to explain.\n\nThere had to be an answer but I didn't know what it was, and when\nthe scream died away and the tugging stopped all I could hear for an\ninstant was the steady droning of the train. Then there was another\nviolent movement close to me and a harsh intake of breath.\n\nMy hand shot out, grazed something smooth that whipped away from me and\ncaught hold of a wrist that was much thinner than a man's wrist had any\nright to be.\n\nMuch softer too, velvety soft, and it tugged and jerked in a frantic\neffort to free itself, holding tight to the knife that it would have\ntaken all of a woman's strength to plunge deep into my heart.\n\nBut she could have done it, whoever she was, for there was a wiry\nstrength in her--a strength so great that I had to twist her wrist\ncruelly before her fingers relaxed and the knife dropped to the floor\nof the train.\n\nShe gasped in pain--or was it fury?--and exerted all of her strength\nagain in a desperate effort to break my grip. And this time luck was on\nher side. No, call it what it was. Luck may have figured, but most of\nit was plain blundering stupidity on my part. I was pretty sure I knew\nwhat her first, misdirected blow with the knife had done to the man I'd\nbeen talking to, and the thought so sickened and unnerved me that my\nfingers relaxed a little when the knife went clattering, and she took\nadvantage of that to break free.\n\nThe passengers were crowding me now, pushing, shoving in alarm, and I\nknew it would be easy enough for her to force her way between them,\nstill exerting all of her strength and get far enough away to be just\none of the thirty terrified people when the train roared out into the\nlight again. They'd all look disheveled, on the verge of panic and I\nwouldn't have a chance of identifying her.\n\nHow could I have identified her with any certainty, even if she'd\nbeen the only one with a guilty stare? I hadn't the least idea what\nshe looked like. I only knew that she wasn't old, was all woman in\nher lithe softness, the opposite of an Amazon despite her strength.\nThe femininity which had emanated from her--how instantly it can make\nitself felt, how instinctively overwhelming it can be!--had made me\nfeel like a brute for an instant, even though I'd known it was her life\nor mine and I would have been quite mad to spare her.\n\nThere were men I could think of, the opposite of brutes, who would have\nknocked her unconscious with a blow to the head. To spare a determined\nkiller is potentially suicidal, but I doubted if I could have done that.\n\nI was still doubting it an instant later, when the train emerged from\nthe unlighted tunnel and the bright glare of the Underground lamps\nflooded the aisle, bringing the man she'd stabbed by accident into\nclear view.\n\nI was sure by now that she'd stabbed him by accident in a try for me,\nbut that wasn't going to help him at all. He had flopped over on his\nback and was lying sprawled out in the middle of the aisle, and his\neyes stared up at me, sightless and glazed.\n\nThere was no blood either on or beside him, but that only meant that\nhe'd been stabbed in the back and there hadn't been time for blood from\nthe wound to stain the edge of his clothes and trickle out from beneath\nhim across the aisle.\n\nHis face had the pallor of death and his lips were drawn back over the\nlarge white teeth I'd noticed when he'd been talking to me. Drawn back\nin a stiff, unnatural grin and I didn't have to bend down and listen\nfor a heartbeat I knew I wouldn't hear to be completely sure that the\nwords he'd spoken to me would be the last he'd ever speak on Earth.\n\nJust the way his head lolled, back and forth with the rhythmic\nthrobbings of the train, would have clinched it for me. And I couldn't\nhave bent down, because the other passengers were all staring at him\ntoo now, and elbowing me away from him to get a closer look, torn\nbetween morbid curiosity and stark terror.\n\nI was too shaken, too sick at heart, to resent the elbowing. There was\nanger in me too, cold, uncompromising and right at that moment I could\nno longer even think of her as a woman.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was past midnight when I got home and let myself into the apartment.\nI was more shaken than I would have cared to admit to anyone who didn't\nknow me as well as Trilling did, because casual acquaintances can do\nyou an injustice and judge the extent of your control by the way you\nhappen to be looking at the moment.\n\nI was quite sure that I was looking _very_ bad, and however severely\nI'd been shaken up by what had happened I still had a fair measure of\ncontrol over my emotions.\n\nI hadn't stayed in the train or on the platform to assist in the\ninvestigation, but I didn't feel guilty about it. Trilling could square\nall that with the authorities easily enough and he wouldn't have wanted\nme to talk to the police and have to identify myself. I was sure of\nthat. My evidence would be taken down and turned over to the proper\nauthorities in good time. The rule for me--the only rule I had a right\nto consider--was no entanglements.\n\nI shut and locked the front door and almost called out: \"It's me,\ndarling!\" as I usually do when I come home late, because when Joan is\nalone in the apartment and hears a door opening and closing she gets\nangry when I just walk in unannounced. It's part woman-curiosity, part\nfear, I guess--the thought that it could be a prowler and why should\nshe be kept in suspense while I'm hanging up my hat and coat?\n\nBut this time something prevented me from calling out. Possibly the\nquarrel we'd had was still rankling a little deep in my mind and I\nwasn't quite sure how she'd take the \"Darling.\"\n\nMy stubborn pride again. Or possibly it was just the feeling I had that\nthe apartment was quieter than usual, that when you're keyed up and\nalert enough to hear a pin drop and you hear nothing--just a stillness\nthat's a little on the weird side--your anxiety becomes too great to be\nrelieved by calling out a cheery greeting.\n\nI felt somehow that it would be wiser, and set better with the way I\nfelt, if I just hung up my coat and walked into the living room without\nsaying a word.\n\nSo I walked into the living room without saying a word and she was\nsitting right in the middle of it, on a straight-back chair with all of\nher bags packed and standing on the floor by the window, and with all\nof my bags packed and standing cheek-by-jowl with hers, and the three\ntrunks that were going with me to Mars all sealed up and double-locked,\nand she wasn't angry or shaking her head or looking at the luggage with\nscorn.\n\nThere was pride in her lustrous brown eyes and the adorable tilt of\nher chin, and a warmth and a tenderness, and she was smiling at me and\nnodding.\n\n\"Oh, darling,\" she said. \"Darling ... darling ... come here. Did you\nthink I'd ever let you go to Mars without me? It was just talk--just\nstubborn, wild, crazy talk and it didn't mean a thing.\"\n\nIf you marry a woman like Joan and ever have a moment of doubt ...\nwell, it means you ought to have your head examined. But you're twice\nas far removed from sanity if you throw away the check. For you can\nalways be sure it will be redeemed eventually, in full measure and\nbrimming over.\n\nI didn't even have to put on my uniform and attach the small silver\nhawk to it.\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nWe were not the only passengers in the eight-cabined forward section\nof the big sky ship which had been assigned to us. But it had taken us\nalmost a week to get acquainted. To get really acquainted, that is, so\nthat we could relax and feel at ease and really enjoy one another's\ncompany.\n\nWe were sitting in lounge chairs on the long promenade deck that ran\nparallel with all eight of the cabins, staring out through translucent\ncrystal at a wide waste of stars.\n\nSitting in the first chair was a tall, sturdily built man of\nthirty-eight, with keen blue eyes and a dusting of gray at his temples.\nHis name was Clifton Maddox and he was an electronic engineer. He had\nstories on tap that could turn your hair white, because he had been to\nMars and back eight times.\n\nSeated next to him, with her hand resting lightly on his arm, was a\nwoman in her early twenties, with honey-blonde hair and eyes that held\nunfathomable glints and an enigmatical ingenuousness that could keep a\nman guessing in an exciting way. Her name was Helen Melton and she had\neyes only for the man at her side. She had managed to make of the trip\na continuous honeymoon, despite a few lovers' quarrels and the stern\nexactions which her work as a medical laboratory technician had imposed\non her.\n\nI mention these two because they were fairly typical of the group as a\nwhole. They were all unusual individuals, the kind of people you take\na liking to straight off, when you meet them casually at a party and\nexchange a few words with them that you keep remembering for days.\n\nJoan and I sat in the last two chairs on the promenade deck, a little\napart from the others. Joan was deep in a book and a little weary of\ntalking and I ... was thinking about the robots.\n\nThe robots were a story in themselves--a story that could bear a great\ndeal of re-telling. If right at that moment I'd had a son--a bright and\neager lad of six or eight--I'd have set him on my knee and talked about\nthe robots.\n\nThe five hundred passengers in the big sky ship were not alone in the\nlong journey through interplanetary space. In the last years of the\ntwentieth century, I'd have taken pains to make very clear to him, and\nin the early years of the twenty-first, a great new science had grown\nfrom an infant into a giant.\n\nThe science of cybernetics, of giant computers that could do much\nof Man's thinking for him on a specialized technological level, had\ntransformed the face of the Earth and was continuing to transform it at\na steadily accelerating pace.\n\nThe rocket's four giant computers were of the newest and most efficient\ntype--humanoid in aspect, with conical heads, massive metal body-boxes,\nand three-jointed metal limbs which had all of Man's flexible\nadaptability in the carrying out of complex and difficult tasks.\n\nRobotlike and immense, they towered in the chart room with their\nsix-digited metal hands on their metal knees, their electronic circuits\nclicking, their tiers of memory banks in constant motion, but otherwise\noutwardly indifferent to the human activity that was taking place\naround them.\n\nFour metal giants in a metal rocket, functioning cooperatively with\nMan in the gulfs between the planets, might have made an imaginative\nfiction writer of an earlier age catch his breath and glory in\nthe fulfillment of a prophecy. An H. G. Wells perhaps, or an Olaf\nStapledon. But the reality was an even greater tribute to the human\nmind's inventive brilliance than the Utopian dream had been.\n\nThe four giant computers were capable of solving problems too technical\nfor the human mind to master without assistance, usually with\nastounding swiftness and always with the more-than-human accuracy of\nthinking machines whose prime function was to correlate without error\nthe data supplied to them on punched metallic tapes, and to perform\nintricate mechanical tasks based upon that data.\n\nThe robots were tremendous, by any yardstick you might care to apply,\nand if I'd had a son--\n\nI stopped thinking about the robots abruptly and sat very still,\nlistening. A sound I'd heard a moment before had come again, much\nlouder this time--a chill, unearthly screeching.\n\nThe chart room was just outside the eight-cabin section and I could\nhear the sound clearly. My nerves again, my over-stimulated imagination?\n\nIn space strange and unusual sounds are as common as pips on a radar\nscreen. It was queer how quickly you got used to them. You had to\nwalk around with your ears plugged up, in a sense, but the plugs\ndidn't have to be inserted. They were just natural growths inside your\nears--invisible and without substance, but plugs notwithstanding.\nThey produced a kind of psycho-somatic deafness which didn't otherwise\ninterfere with your hearing.\n\nJust the very unusual sounds, the totally inexplicable raspings,\ndronings, creakings--usually of short duration--were blotted out.\n\nYou didn't hear them unless something deep in your mind whispered:\n\"This one is different. This is an emergency. Take heed!\"\n\nThe screeching was very different. It was like nothing I'd ever heard\nbefore, on Earth or in space.\n\nThe others must have heard it too, for it had been too loud, the second\ntime, to be ignored. But apparently that strange acceptance of strange\nnoises in space which goes with the kind of deafness I've mentioned\nhad only been shattered for me. The six men and women in the lounge\nchairs had looked a little startled for a moment and exchanged puzzled\nglances. Which meant, of course, that they had heard it despite the\nmental earplugs in some inner recess of their minds. But that didn't\nprevent them from shrugging it off and resuming their conversation.\n\nJoan also looked a trifle uneasy. She stopped reading just long enough\nto raise her eyes and frown, then became absorbed in the book again.\n\nI got up quietly and pressed her wrist. \"See you,\" I said.\n\nShe shut the book abruptly and straightened in her chair. \"Where are\nyou going, Ralph?\"\n\n\"Just stay right where you are, kitten,\" I said. \"I'll be back in a\nmoment.\"\n\n\"That screeching noise,\" she said. \"I was wondering about it, Ralph. I\nguess you'd better see what's causing it.\"\n\nSo she'd been disturbed by it too, and ignoring it had taken a\ndeliberate effort of will which I hadn't realized she was exerting. It\nmade me happy in an odd inner way, because it proved again what I'd\nalways known ... that we were very close and there were currents of\nunderstanding which flowed back and forth between us and I had a wife I\ncould be proud of.\n\n\"It's probably nothing,\" I said, not wanting to alarm her. \"But I might\nas well take a look. It seems to be coming from the chart room.\"\n\n\"All right,\" she said and squeezed my hand.\n\nI had to open and shut two sliding panels and pass along a blank-walled\npassageway to get to the chart room. To my surprise the door was\nstanding open. It's usually kept locked, because there's no section of\nthe sky ship where a man who didn't want anyone to suspect that he\nharbored within himself the most dangerous kind of destructive impulses\ncould do more damage.\n\nThe shattering of a photo-electric eye or the ripping out of a single\nlive connection in just one of the four cybernetic robots could have\nwrecked the rocket, and sent it spiraling down through the space gulfs\nin flaming ruin, depending on just how vital to the robot's functioning\nthe shattered part happened to be.\n\nThere was a security alert system which would have to be disconnected\nfirst, but anyone resourceful enough to get inside the chart room\nat all, without identification-disk proof that he had a right to be\nthere, would have known precisely how to take care of the preliminary\nobstacles.\n\nI didn't waste any time in getting to that wide-open door, for my mind\nwas racing on ahead of me like the most alerted kind of alarm system,\nits jaggling warning me that every second counted and that what I\ndreaded most might very well be true.\n\nWhat I actually saw, when I reached the doorway and stood there looking\nin, took me completely by surprise. It wasn't the way I'd pictured it\nat all. But it was just as unnerving, just as much of a threat to the\nsafety of the ship and it startled me so I must have looked almost\ncomic, standing there idiot-still. But there was nothing comic about\nwhat I saw.\n\nThe woman I'd almost asked to go to Mars with me was staring straight\nat me, her hair still piled up high, a look of terrified appeal in her\neyes. She wasn't alone. She was struggling furiously with a crewman I'd\ntalked to a few times and neither liked nor disliked--a heavyset man\nwith high cheekbones and pale blue eyes. He was gripping her savagely\nby the wrist and they were both backed up against one of the robot\ngiants.\n\nSuddenly as I stared her head went back and a convulsive trembling\nseized her. She began to scream.\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nIt was a christ-awful moment--for her and for me. For her because she\nhad no right to be in the Chart Room, or even on the ship, as far as\nI knew, and there was a look on the crewman's face that chilled me to\nthe core of my being. It went beyond the anger of a duty-obsessed man,\noutraged by her infringement of the regulations. It was a completely\ndifferent kind of anger. There was a savage cruelty, a killing rage in\nhis eyes, impossible to misinterpret.\n\nIt was just as awful a moment for me, because I wasn't sure I could get\nto him before he broke her wrist or did something worse to her. I'd\nseen a woman kneed in the groin once, by just such an enraged human\nanimal, and the memory of it had never left me. A strong man, turned\nmaniacal, could kill with his hands in a matter of seconds. I'd seen\nthat happen too, and the victim hadn't been a woman, but a man as\npowerful as the killer.\n\nI crossed the Chart Room in a running leap, grabbed him by the\nshoulders and swung him about, raining blows on him more or less at\nrandom. I just tried to hit him as hard as I could without caring\nmuch where the blows landed, so long as they resounded with a meaty\nsmack where they would do the most good. My only aim was to stun\nand, if possible, cripple him in a terrible, punishing way, so that\nhe'd release his grip on the wrist of the woman he'd been trying to\nhurt before she screamed again and her hand dangled with a sickening\nlimpness, making me want to permanently demolish him in slow and\npainful stages.\n\nFor a moment I was only sure of one thing. My fist had smashed very\nsolidly into his face at least twice and drawn blood. I could see the\ngleam of blood on his jaw as he reeled back, and I was almost sure I'd\nheard his nose crack. There was nothing wrong with that, but it didn't\nsatisfy me. I wanted to turn his face into quivering jelly. But most\nof all I was hoping, praying that she'd break free before I set about\ndoing that, because a voice was screaming deep in my mind that if she\ncouldn't he might still be capable of injuring her cruelly.\n\nShe broke free. Just how I don't know, because the punishment I'd\ndished out hadn't stunned him. He could still have fractured her wrist,\njudging by the look of blazing fury he trained on me.\n\nHis determination to repay me in full probably explained it. He needed\nboth of his hands free for that, because I could see that what he would\nhave liked to do most was get a strangler's grip on my throat.\n\nThe human windpipe doesn't fracture easily, as every experienced\nmedical examiner knows. It's elastic and it gives, and post-mortem\nappearances prove that you can die by strangulation with your windpipe\nintact. But I have a horror of anything like that, and I didn't intend\nto let his fingers come anywhere near my throat.\n\nI smashed my fist into his groin twice, putting so much\nshoulder-to-elbow resilience into the blows that he bent almost double,\nwrapped his arms about his middle just above his groin and went\nstaggering backwards.\n\nThey were below-the-belt beltings, but I didn't give a damn about that.\nManhandling a woman just because she hasn't the strength of a male has\nalways seemed to be just about the worst crime on the books. All\nright ... attacking a child is worse but you certainly forfeit all\nright to Queensberry Rules consideration when you're called to account\nfor using your strength against anyone weaker than yourself, unless\nhe or she has done something vicious and there's a hell of a good\njustification for it.\n\nI no longer wanted to permanently demolish him, now that she'd broken\nfree. But I had no control over what happened. The deck of the Chart\nRoom is all smooth metal, and the polishing preparation that's used to\nkeep it bright makes it almost as skid-slippery as a skating rink, if\nyou happen to be thrown a little off-balance.\n\nHe was off-balance just enough to change his backward lurch from a\nstagger to a swaying, spinning glide that sent him crashing against the\nbase of a robot giant.\n\nUp to that instant the four robot giants had looked exactly alike. But\na robot in motion looks quite different from a robot at rest, with\nits massive metal hands on its metal knees, and its gleaming central\nsection in an upright position. The crash was followed by a splintering\nsound which continued for several seconds without stopping. There was\na whirring as well, and a blinding flash of light came from the metal\ngiant's conical head. Almost instantly the robot was in motion, and\nthe way it swayed as it raised its segmented right arm high into the\nair so alarmed me that I shouted a warning to the man I'd just finished\ntrying to send to the sick bay for a stay of at least two weeks.\n\nThe jerky, erratic way the robot giant was swaying could only mean\nthat the crash had damaged its internal gadgetry, and it had gone\ncompletely out of control. It was shaking and quivering all over and\neven its ponderous central section seemed to bulge a little, as if from\nhunger-bloat.\n\nThat, of course, was absurd. But it's natural enough to think of a\nrobot as human and take refuge in absurdity when you know that a\ncybernetic brain, encased in a functional body, can do just as much\ndamage as a madman running amuck with a deadly weapon. Just as much ...\nmore ... when it's out of control.\n\nYou don't want to face up to it squarely, you shrink from it, because\nsome instinct tells you it would be dangerous to let the horror of\nit come sweeping into your mind too fast. So you take refuge in\nabsurdity, you imagine things that are a little on the ludicrous side.\nA hunger-bloat, a maniacal glare in photo-electric eyes.\n\nBut when you've done that, you have to stand and watch the horror take\nplace before your eyes and in the end you've gained nothing ... because\nwhen anything as terrible as what I saw sears its way into your brain\nthe memory of it will remain with you until you die.\n\nThe robot giant's massive metal hand swept downward, descending on the\nhead and shoulders of the man who'd crashed into it. It hurled him to\nthe deck, and flattened him out with a hammer blow that crushed his\nskull, broke his ribs, and tore a deep gash in his back. A red stain\nspread over his ripped shirt. I shut my eyes, sickened. There was a\nscreaming behind me. I swung dully about and went to her and held her\nhead against my chest, stroking her hair, whispering soothing words\ninto her ear. I could do that without endangering the safety of the sky\nship, because the robot giant had ceased to move. With the descent of\nits hand all of the whirrings had ceased and it remained in a bent-over\nposition, utterly rigid, its mace-like metal palm still resting on the\nunstirring crewman's back.\n\nI was quite sure that no jury on Earth would have held me criminally\nresponsible for his death. It had been brought about by an accident I\ncouldn't have foreseen. Every man has the right to defend himself when\nhe's under attack, and not just my own life had been in danger. There\nwas no doubt in my mind ... not the slightest.... His rage had been\nhomicidal and he would have killed me if I'd given him the chance.\n\nJustifiable homicide. There could be no other verdict, if the insignia\nthe Board had given me hadn't conferred legal immunity when an\naccidental death stemmed from my right to stay alive and I had been\nforced to return to Earth and clear myself in court.\n\nI felt no moral guilt, but still--I was badly shaken. I had been\ninstrumental in causing his death, however unintentionally, and it's\nalways better if a man can live out his life without experiencing the\ndeep sadness that goes with that kind of knowledge.\n\nThe only difference is--moral guilt never leaves you and grows worse\nwith the years. But there are so many tragic sadnesses in life that\nthey have a way of merging into one big, onrushing stream and when you\nmeasure that stream against a brighter one, the joy-stream, the scales\nseem to stay just about even, with the balance maybe just a little\nheavier on the joyful side.\n\nRight at the moment there was another big, onrushing stream running\nparallel with the sadness. The sober-obligation stream. Or maybe\nduty-stream would be a better name for it. We spend at least a third\nof our lives immersed in it up to our necks and swimming against the\ntoughest kind of currents. Sometimes I think we could do without it\nentirely.\n\nWhat was it Baudelaire said about boredom? \"But well you know that\ndainty monster, thou, hypocrite reader, fellow man, my brother.\" You\ncould practically say the same thing about duty.\n\nBut the stream is there, and if you just stay on the bank watching\nthe other swimmers you won't really have the right to plunge into the\njoy-stream with a clear conscience.\n\nThe first thing I had to do was get her out of the Chart Room before\nshe collapsed. She was close to hysteria and I didn't even want her\nto look at the body again. I was careful to stand between her and the\nrobot, and when I guided her gently toward the door I kept my hand on\nthe back of her head and kept her face pressed to my chest.\n\nIt was more difficult than it would have looked on a cinema\nscreen--more awkward and less romantic, and that was the way I wanted\nit to be, because nothing could have been further from my mind at that\nmoment than the romantic glow I'd felt when I had been sitting across a\ntable from her in a lakeside tavern on Earth, and hadn't fully realized\nthat Joan was still the only really important woman in my life.\n\nOh, all right. You can't have a head that beautiful nestling in the\nmiddle of your chest without feeling a certain ... well, a quickening\nof your pulse, at least. It can happen even in the presence of death,\nwhen you've just been shaken to the depths in a ghastly way. Perhaps\nbecause of that....\n\nSex and death. Don't be morbid, Ralphie boy. Don't turn the clock\nback and let the old Freudian catch-alls of a century ago confuse and\nmislead you. Half of all that has been made clearer because we know now\nwhat Man was like five million years ago when he was a very predatory\nape.\n\nSure, sex and death are closely linked. Dawn man went hunting and slew\na cave bear and threw it down before his mate, all bloody, with pride\nswelling in him and just the excitement of the hunt, the thrill and\ndanger of it, made him want to make love in just as exciting a way.\n\nBut sex and life are even more closely linked, and in life there are\nloyalties to consider and one woman becomes more important to you than\nall the rest and you don't need that kind of stimulation to enable you\nto make love to her in the most exciting possible way.\n\nThe old stirring is still there, the death-sex linkage, and it can hit\nyou hard at times and you have to keep a tight grip on yourself to keep\nfrom succumbing to it. But you can do it if you try.\n\nOf course I was being unfair to her. The sex-death linkage had no\nmore relation to the glow I'd felt back in the lakeside tavern than\nit did now to her as an individual. I'd have felt the same stirring\nif I'd been guiding Joan out of the Chart Room with her head on my\nbreast--more of a stirring because Joan was the one woman in the world\nfor me.\n\nWhat it really meant was that the woman with the hair piled up high on\nher head filled me with a two-way sense of guilt. The life-sex linkage\nwas better than the death-sex linkage, and the one and only woman\nfeeling better than the promiscuous amorousness which any beautiful\nwoman can arouse in the male. And right at the moment she represented\nboth of the more primitive aspects of sex.\n\nBut the dice had just fallen that way. It wasn't her fault and now she\nwas close to hysteria and needed reassurance and all the comfort I\ncould give her.\n\nAs soon as we were out in the passageway I asked her to tell me who\nshe was. Her name. So much had happened between us that it seemed\nunbelievable that I still didn't know that much about her.\n\n\"I thought I told you right after we left the spaceport,\" she said. \"I\nthought you knew. It's Helen ... Helen Barclay.\"\n\nSo ... the old wonder name, the magical name, the Topless Towers of\nIllium name. How often it seemed to go with her kind of woman. How\ncould she have been Margaret or Janice or Barbara ... attractive as\nthose names were. Lilith perhaps ... yes. Or Eva ... because I've often\nfelt that Eve must have been a woman of glamor, red-headed and with\na temper a little on the fiery side, because how else could she have\ncome down to us as Earth's first legendary temptress? But otherwise ...\nHelen, the glamor name that led the list.\n\nWhy was I letting my mind go off at such an absurd tangent, when right\nahead of me the stern-obligation stream I've mentioned was widening\nout, filling with rapids, becoming a river which could have swallowed\nup the sky ship, or wrecked it ... if I failed to take up a giant's\nstance right in the middle of it. Wade in and thrust the waters aside,\nRalphie boy. It's your duty. Try to think of yourself as a giant.\n\nWhat made it tough was ... I didn't feel at all like a giant. But what\nhad just happened in the Chart Room couldn't be ignored. A lot of\nquestions would have to be asked fast, and if the explanations sounded\nlike lies, if Helen Barclay refused to cooperate, some very drastic\naction might have to be taken. I hoped she didn't have anything ugly\nto conceal. Just the thought was hateful to me, because I believed\nin her and trusted her. But the way I felt had nothing to do with an\nobligation I had no right to sidestep for as short a distance as the\nwidth of an electron-microscoped virus.\n\nI was glad that I wouldn't have to do the questioning. Not straight\noff, anyway--not until I knew much more than I did, and all of the big,\nvital questions had been answered with candor and I could go right on\nfeeling the way I did about her with a clear conscience. I hoped to God\nit would be with candor. If someone is dying and you can do nothing\nto save him and what he's done or hasn't done is of no importance to\nanyone but himself ... you don't ply him with questions. But what she'd\ndone or hadn't done could send the sky ship down into the gulfs in\nflaming ruin, because all of the passengers are encased in a fragile\nkind of bubble and the slightest pinprick could puncture it.\n\nThe pinprick, for instance, of an Earthside conspirator, traveling\nalong with the bubble out into space and awaiting just the right moment\nto insert the tiny, darkly gleaming point of the pin under the skin of\nthe bubble.\n\nAnd she wasn't dying, but alive--and could, if she had nothing to\nconceal, have no trouble in convincing the commander of the sky ship\nthat any such fear was groundless.\n\nI had to take her straight to the Commander. Otherwise I'd have to\ntake it up with someone of lesser authority and show him the insignia\nand question her myself in private. I couldn't see any advantage to be\ngained by that. It would leave the corpse in the Chart Room entirely\nunexplained and the Commander would not take kindly to having anything\nas disturbing as that left lying around in a loose-end way for him to\nworry about.\n\nIt would mean, of course, that I would have to show him the insignia.\nThat was the bad part, the one thing I wanted most to avoid. But I\ncould see no effective way of avoiding it now, because he was, after\nall, in command of the sky ship and directly responsible for its\nsafety. He had every right to be the first to question her, unless I\nchose to supplant that right with what the insignia represented. To do\nso would not have been wise for a dozen reasons, the chief one being\nthat when a man is in a firm position to exercise reasonably high\nauthority it's always a mistake to go over his head unless you're sure\nyou can make a better job of it than he could, despite his specialized\nknowledge. I didn't think for a moment I could come anywhere near\nequaling Commander Littlefield's competence in guarding the safety of a\nMars' rocket ... so to curtail his authority in a high-handed way would\nhave been worse than inexcusable.\n\nBut I would still have to show him the insignia ... or I would not be\npermitted to sit in on the questioning.\n\nWe were at the end of the passageway now and just by making a sharp\nleft turn I could have taken her into the cabin section and introduced\nher to Joan. Perhaps, out of compassion, I should have done that ...\nlet her relax in a lounge chair and look out at the cool, untroubled\nstars, and regain a little more of her composure. Some of it was coming\nback, she wasn't trembling quite so violently now, and women seem\nto know better than men how to ease shock-engendered agitation ...\nespecially when it's another woman they have to soothe and sympathize\nwith. I could trust Joan to handle it like an expert. \"Of course, you\npoor darling. I know just how you feel. Ralph will know what to do.\nDon't think about it. Just stay right here with us until Ralph comes\nback.\"\n\nIt would have been the kind thing to do, all right and for an instant I\nhesitated and almost committed an act of madness.\n\nWhen you've something to conceal, it's much easier to avoid a\nthoughtless admission, a damaging slip of the tongue, when you've had\ntime to collect your thoughts and decide in advance exactly how much\nof the truth it's wise to reveal. She was too agitated now to guard\nagainst slips and our chances of getting at the truth would be much\nbetter. And like the short-on-brains, over-chivalrous lug I could be on\nrare occasions--I hoped they were rare--I'd almost torn it.\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nUnlike Jonathan Trilling, Commander Littlefield was the kind of man\nwho was what he was in an uncomplicated way. You didn't have to try to\nanalyze why he impressed you as he did, because it was all there on\ndisplay, right out in the open. He was big and robust looking, with\na granite-firm jaw and the kind of features that take a long time to\ndevelop the lines of character that are etched into them, because a\nman who has his emotions well under control in his youth will pass\ninto middle-age before you can tell from his expression just how much\nmaturity and strength resides in him.\n\nThere are bland-faced lads who seem to have no lines of character at\nall in their countenances up to about the age of twenty-eight. But when\nyou hear them talk you change your mind very quickly about them, and\nwhen they are forty-five the lines are all there, deeply-etched, and\nthe mystery is explained. Commander Littlefield was that kind of man.\n\nWe had several very serious things to discuss, because five hours had\npassed since I'd sat facing him in the same chair and Helen Barclay\nhad sat in another chair at right angles to a third chair, which he\nhad drawn out from his desk and occupied for a full hour without a\ncoffee break, his eyes searching her face as she talked. His stare\nwas a kind of interrogation in itself, and it must have been hard for\nher to endure. I think it would have angered me a little, if I hadn't\nsuspected what was behind it.\n\nHer story stood up very well and had the ring of truth and her eyes\nnever wavered. But he was hoping they would, then he could detect in\nher eyes a flicker of hesitation, of evasiveness, which would give her\naway.\n\nBut he hadn't. Her story had stood up almost _too_ well ... because the\ntruth always has a few flaws and inconsistencies in it. Memory is never\na perfect enough mirror to permit anyone to avoid contradictions when\nthey are doing their best to tell nothing but the truth, even under\noath.\n\nBut she hadn't seemed to be lying, and in the end I think she convinced\nhim completely, because toward the end he stopped looking at her as if\nevery word she said was impressing him unfavorably.\n\nAnd now she was in the sick bay, recovering from shock, and I was back\nagain for another talk with the Commander.\n\nHe began by saying: \"I don't know just how I should address you, Mr.\nGraham--sir. That silver hawk gives you a Colonization Board clearance\nthat's a little on the special side ... you'll have to admit. The\nfirst man who wore it got a little angry when anyone addressed him as\n'General' because that's a strictly military title, and military titles\nhaven't been in common use for forty years. There's not supposed to be\nany army anymore--on Earth or on Mars. But I've always sort of liked\n'General' and that insignia is practically the equivalent of five\nstars.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I don't like 'General' at all,\" I said. \"The title is ...\nRalph.\"\n\n\"Well ... suit yourself. _Ralph._ I'm a simple soldier at heart, I\nsuppose--always will be, even though I hold the rank of Commander.\nYou're young enough to be my son, so that informal crap doesn't go too\nmuch against the grain, if you're that serious about it.\"\n\n\"I'm serious about it,\" I said. \"And you're not old enough to be my\nfather. An older brother, perhaps. You can't stretch it any further\nthan that.\"\n\n\"What do you mean I can't? I'm an old man of forty-eight. Hair\nthinning, going a little to fat. My God, a Wendel Atomics or Endicott\nFuel top executive couldn't look any older, and they've got a head\nstart on the rest of us. They start burning out at thirty-five.\"\n\n\"There's not an ounce of fat on you, as far as I can see,\" I assured\nhim.\n\n\"That's going to handicap you on Mars, Ralph. Eyesight not what it\nshould be in a five-star general. Look again, look closer. I've got\na pot belly you'd notice, all right, if I didn't exercise to keep it\ndown.\"\n\nI'd skipped over his reference to Wendel Atomics and Endicott, maybe\nsubconsciously, but it must have registered belatedly in a very\npronounced way, because something in my expression turned him dead\nserious in an instant. No man ever speaks with complete levity about\nhis age, but what there was of ironic amusement in his gray eyes\nvanished and his lips tightened.\n\n\"Well ... suppose we go over what we've got,\" he said. \"I'll be\ngrateful for any ideas, any suggestions you may care to make. I've\nfound out something that's going to give you a jolt. It may even rock\nyou back on your heels, depending on how easily you can be rocked. But\nit will keep ... until we've discussed what she told us. What do you\nthink of her story?\"\n\n\"I believe it,\" I said. I didn't think it was necessary to elaborate.\n\n\"Well ... I'm afraid I do too, more's the pity. If I thought she was\nlying I'd have more of a lever to pry what we don't know loose.\"\n\nThere was a thin sheet of paper covered with very fine handwriting on\nhis desk. He picked it up and ran his eyes over it.\n\n\"I sort of summarized what she told us,\" he said. \"But there's no sense\nin your reading this. I can summarize it even more briefly by skipping\ntwo-thirds of what I have here.\"\n\n\"You might as well,\" I told him. \"She talked and we listened\nfor at least twenty minutes. Then we both questioned her. In a\nquestion-and-answer session like that the vital points are apt to get a\nlittle blurred.\"\n\n\"Well, we know she did something no one has ever done before--stowed\naway on a Mars' ship. I'd have said it couldn't be done ... and so\nwould you, I'm sure, because you're as familiar with the inspection\nroutine as I am. You passed through it. No one could possibly get\ninside a Mars' rocket without a Board clearance and a personal,\nten-point identification check every step of the way. In other words,\nyou can't just ascend the launching pad, be whisked up to the passenger\nsection and walk right in. There's only one way you can get inside\nwithout passing the four inspection points, with machines X-raying you\nfrom head to toe.\"\n\n\"I know,\" I said. \"It was a damn clever stunt.\"\n\n\"It was more than a stunt. It was an achievement on the creative genius\nlevel. It took planning and foresight. And ... luck. A great deal of\nluck. But that doesn't detract from the brilliance of it. She found out\nthat we were installing a new cybernetic robot, to replace one that had\ndeveloped electronic fatigue and had to be removed for repairs and a\nlong rest. And she knew that we wouldn't X-ray a robot or subject it to\nany of the usual tests. It would just be wheeled right in.\"\n\nLittlefield paused an instant, then went on. \"She knew there was plenty\nof room inside a cybernetic robot that large, between the tiers of\nmemory banks and all the other gadgetry, for the carrying out of what\nshe had in mind--a stowaway gamble that was almost sure to succeed. She\nprovided for her comfort during the long trip in half-dozen ingenious\nways, as we know, and made sure that the food concentrates she took\nalong were high in essential proteins.\n\n\"She knew, of course, that she couldn't stay inside the robot without\ncoming out at all. She'd have to emerge occasionally, if only to ease\nthe psychological strain. But she used good judgment and only emerged\nwhen she was absolutely sure that it would be safe.\"\n\n\"But once she didn't,\" I said.\n\n\"Once she didn't. Once she felt she couldn't stand the tensions that\nwere building up in her any longer and she took a chance and came out\nwhen she wasn't sure the Chart Room would be deserted. You told me\nyou thought it was never left unguarded. Well ... that isn't strictly\ntrue. There's a built-in security alert system in all of the robots and\nwe can risk leaving it unguarded for a few minutes, when every member\nof the crew is needed elsewhere, to take care of some particularly\ntroublesome space headache. That's what we call the small and seldom\nvery serious emergencies which are always arising in a sky ship this\nlarge.\"\n\n\"But if she heard someone moving about ... she must have been crazy to\nemerge,\" I said.\n\n\"That's just it. She wasn't sure she heard anyone. In fact, she was\nalmost sure it would be safe to emerge. She'd learned to trust her\ninstincts, and the silence was almost unbroken. Just once she thought\nshe heard a slight sound, but she put it down to the tension that was\nbuilding up in her. She felt she _had_ to emerge.\"\n\n\"And he caught her,\" I said, nodding. \"And was more enraged than he\nhad any right to be. His fury was maniacal. If you'd seen the look on\nhis face and the way he was twisting her wrist you'd have been sure as\nI was that he was quite capable of killing her. And that's the most\npuzzling part of it. We can't explain it--and neither can she. That's\nthe one part of her story I was afraid you wouldn't believe.\"\n\n\"I didn't for a moment,\" Littlefield said. \"I was sure she was\nlying ... until the look of bewilderment in her eyes convinced me she\nwas telling the truth.\"\n\n\"You didn't want to talk about him until you'd examined the body,\" I\nsaid. \"I guess I got a little angry when you were so damned insistent\non that point. I was just about to--well, use that silver bird to make\nyou change your mind. That used to be called 'pulling rank' on someone\nyou respect and who has every right to tell you off. Since you like to\nplay soldier--and I mean that in a complimentary way--you're free to go\nahead and tell me off now, if you want to.\"\n\n\"Hell no. You had every right to press me. I just felt a little guilty\nand ashamed, I guess--to think that I'd let a crewman come aboard this\nsky ship who had managed in some way to deceive the Board. I was pretty\nsure, even then, that his clearance papers must have been forged, but\nI wanted a chance to examine the body before I committed myself, one\nway or the other.\"\n\n\"I guess I'd have done the same,\" I said\n\n\"Yes.... Well, I'd have gone right down to the Chart Room and examined\nthe body before I listened to what she had to say ... if you hadn't\ngiven me some very sound advice. If we questioned her while she was in\na keyed up state we'd have a better chance of getting at the truth.\"\n\nI'd almost tripped over that one myself, so I didn't rate the\ncompliment he was paying me. But it was too minor to make me feel\nconscience-bound to disillusion him.\n\n\"You saw me click the officer-section communicator on and talk into\nit for a minute or two,\" he went on. \"I ordered a double guard posted\nin the Chart Room, but I told them not to touch the body until I had\na chance to get down there myself. It's just as well I did, because\nsomething was found on the body I wouldn't have wanted anyone else to\nsee.\"\n\nHe was smiling a little and I wondered why, until he exploded the\nbombshell--the thing he'd said would rock me back on my heels.\n\n\"He'd deceived the Board with a vengeance, apparently. There was a\nsealed envelope on him and when I tore it open there was a card in\nit. It wasn't a Board clearance card. It was a Wendel Atomics private\npolice card and it identified him as the kind of secret agent you'd\ntrade in for a snake if you _had_ to have something poisonous on\nboard and were given a free choice in the matter. The Wendel police\nare little better than hired killers--although perhaps a few of them\nare generous-minded enough to feel that when you've beaten a man\ninsensible it's going a little too far to put a bullet in him as well.\nAnd the Wendel secret agents are the worst sadists of the lot. They're\nhand-picked for shrewdness and when you get intelligence along with\nbrutality there's no refinement of cruelty that won't be resorted to\nwhen the going gets rough.\"\n\n\"Good God!\" I said. \"So that's why--No ... no. It doesn't quite explain\nwhy just the sight of Helen Barclay emerging from the robot enraged him\nthe way it did. Just the fact that there was a woman stowaway on Board\nshouldn't have angered him at all. It wasn't his headache, because\nhe was merely masquerading as a crewman. Even a man who felt some\nresponsibility in the matter would have only been a little angered.\"\n\nLittlefield nodded. \"Don't think that hasn't occurred to me. If he'd\nnever set eyes on her before, or had no idea who she was ... it's hard\nto see why he should have become enraged, as you say. That's why I've\ngone to such lengths to make sure she was telling us the full truth\nwhen she explained why getting to Mars was so important to her.\"\n\nHe didn't have to read from the paper he was still holding to help\nme recall in detail everything she'd said during that part of the\nquestion-and-answer session. It had made too deep an impression on\nme. It had also struck a vital nerve, because it was tied in with my\nassignment. Not directly, because I could have completed my big job\nwithout so much as talking to her again. But she was going to Mars\nbecause of something that Wendel Atomics had done.\n\nWendel Atomics was the exposed nerve, because anything that had to do\nwith the Martian power combines was of vital interest to me, if only on\nthe general information level.\n\nIn her case it was a personal matter, just between Wendel and herself.\nA very small matter to Wendel but overwhelmingly important to her.\n\nHer brother, an electronic engineer, was dying by inches in a Wendel\nlaboratory. Slow, radio-active poisoning meant very little to Wendel\nAtomics apparently, when just one small human cog was afflicted with it\nand they still needed his services.\n\nSo she had used her own knowledge of electronics and a very great\nresourcefulness and a high I.Q. to stow away in a cybernetic robot and\nwas on her way to Mars to see what a woman of courage, entirely alone,\ncould do to save the life of the only brother she had.\n\nShe had tried to get a clearance from the Board and failed and that\nexplained how she happened to be in the New Chicago spaceport bar when\nmy own life had been in even more immediate danger ... because slow,\nradio-active poisoning takes a long time to kill and if you can stop it\nin time there's always a chance that the victim will recover.\n\n\"I've been checking up ever since you left,\" Littlefield was saying.\n\"I managed to get through to Earth on the needle frequencies and\nTrilling knows now that you showed me the silver bird. The code\nI used to tell him that was too complicated to be broken by the\nbig-brained inhabitants of Alpha Centauri's third planet, if--as seems\nunlikely--such a planet exists.\"\n\n\"And you didn't even tell me,\" I said. \"I suppose I should be burned up\nabout it.\"\n\n\"No, you shouldn't be. I just saved you a lot of unnecessary\nexplaining. You can talk to Trilling all you want to from here on in,\nbut I've cushioned the shock for you, taken a little of the edge off\nthe way he seemed to feel for a minute or two.\"\n\n\"Well ... all right,\" I said. \"Just what did you tell him.\"\n\n\"I asked him to do what he could to confirm her story. So far\neverything she told us seems to check out. Of course, they haven't been\nable to turn up too much, and she could still be lying. But we may get\nmore on it later on. Don't count on it, though. I may not even be able\nto contact Trilling again. The needle frequencies are as unreliable as\nhell, as you know.\"\n\n\"But you just said I could talk to Trilling myself--\"\n\n\"If we're lucky. You can't express yourself with precision when you're\nas troubled as I am right now.\"\n\nI was troubled too ... perhaps more than he was. But just trying to\nmake that concern dwindle a little by turning all the knobs on and off\nkept me from thinking about it.\n\n\"Well ... he could have recognized her,\" I said. \"There could have\nbeen a link there, since he was a Wendel secret agent and her brother\nworks for Wendel. Maybe they sent him her brother's photograph over the\nneedle frequencies and said: 'Look around for a girl who resembles this\nman and keep an eye on her. She's one little girl we're worried about.\"\n\n\"Oh, sure, that could be it.\"\n\n\"It wouldn't sound quite so ludicrous, Commander, if it was her\nphotograph they managed somehow to send him. Maybe they secured one\nfrom her brother without his knowing about it. But still--it wouldn't\nmake much sense. Why should they fear her enough to put a secret agent\non her trail? One helpless woman forty million miles from Mars. He\ncouldn't have known she'd smuggle herself on board the rocket in a\ncybernetic robot ... because his rage when he discovered her precluded\nthat. And why would he make the trip if he was out to get her and, for\nall he knew to the contrary, she was still somewhere in New Chicago?\"\n\n\"If he was trailing her he could have suspected she might be on board\nand may have been searching everywhere for her,\" Littlefield pointed\nout. \"That would even explain his rage when he finally got his hands\non her, if we remember the kind of sadistic human animal he was.\nFrustration alone could produce a rage as violent as that in a Wendel\nagent--days and nights of fruitless searching. But ... I agree with you\nthat it doesn't make sense otherwise. The stumbling block, as you say,\nis the difficulty in imagining how Wendel Atomics could possibly regard\nher as that serious a menace. Or fear her at all, for that matter.\"\n\nThat was as far as we got. The officer-section communication\ninstrument on Littlefield's desk started buzzing and he swung about to\npick it up, with an almost joyful eagerness.\n\nI was sure that at any other time he'd have accepted that call with\nno visible display of emotion, just as a routine necessity. But when\nyou've reached a stone wall in a discussion of vital importance and the\nodds against your making any further progress seem insurmountable, for\nthe moment at least, practically any interruption will be as welcome as\nsunlight after a drenching rain or a peasoup fog. It's certainly better\nthan beating your head against stone.\n\nHe listened for perhaps ten seconds with the instrument pressed to his\near, with no pronounced change of expression. Then his face blanched\nand a look of horror came into his eyes.\n\nHe slammed the instrument down and headed for the door on the run,\ncompletely unmindful of his dignity. Then he seemed to remember that he\nowed me an explanation--a man of principle will usually take a second\nor two out for that even when his home is in flames--and turned a yard\nfrom the door to shout at me.\n\n\"Someone got the nose-cone panel open, climbed outside and is crawling\nalong the airframe toward the jet section! He's wearing magnetic boots\nand if I'm not mistaken he's equipped with everything he needs to blow\nthe rocket apart.\"\n\nWhen he saw the look on my face he added reassuringly. \"We've still got\na good chance of stopping him in time, because he just climbed out.\nBut we'll have to bring most of the airframe into sharp focus on the\nviewplate, and pinpoint his every movement.\"\n\nIt came as such a shock to me that I felt I had a good chance of\nsuffocating, just from the way my throat tightened up and my heart\nstarted pumping blood at twice its usual rate.\n\nI'm not quite sure how I managed to follow him at a distance of not\nmore than fifteen feet, down three intership ladders and along four\nbranching passageways, without once stopping to get my breath back. I\ndoubt if I could have done that anyway.\n\nRight foot, then left, right left, right left, Ralphie boy, and don't\ngive up the ship. Never give up the ship when there's a chance to save\nit. There's nothing painful about being vaporized in space. Remember\nthat, keep it firmly in mind. Nothing painful, nothing sad ... just a\nquick end to all you've had.\n\nI don't know why I thought the Chart Room looked deserted, like\na big, unoccupied mausoleum with tiers for coffins--dozens of\ncoffins--running up both of its sides. No coffins yet, just the empty\nshelves, for burial time had not yet arrived. But how could the Chart\nRoom have looked deserted, when it wasn't at all?\n\nThere were a dozen officers standing in front of the big lighted screen\nand when we crossed the room to join them without announcing our\narrival--well, that made fourteen.\n\nI can't even explain how I got the idea there was a chill in the air\nthat seemed to wrap itself around me in moist, clinging folds, because\nno section of the sky ship was more comfortably heated.\n\nI didn't spend more than a minute or two trying to puzzle it out,\nbecause the \"furious sick shapes of nightmare,\" to quote from a poem\nI wasn't sure I'd ever read, only disturb you when you give them more\nencouragement than they're entitled to.\n\nThe only really important thing was that we could see him in bent\nlight on the big screen--a tiny, spacesuited figure climbing along the\nairframe, laden down with something cumbersome that he kept pushing\nbefore him in a completely weightless way as he inched further and\nfurther toward the rocket's stern.\n\nAll at once, I knew what was going to happen to him. I was as sure of\nit as I am that I have two big toes that point a little inward and that\nJoan sometimes tenderly jokes about.\n\nBetween Earth and Mars space isn't empty. It hasn't been empty for more\nthan half a century, which is a pretty good record on the survival\nscale for man-made, mechanical implants. The early Sputniks didn't last\none-tenth as long.\n\nI knew without waiting for Commander Littlefield to finish what he\nwas saying to one of the officers and issue a command that the needle\nfrequencies scattered throughout the void on all sides of us were the\nonly composite weapon we could count on to save the sky ship and all\nthe people between its decks who didn't want to be vaporized. And that\ntook in practically everyone on board.\n\nSure, I know. Everyone had thought that the millions of filament-thin\nwires which had been put into orbit around Earth in the seventh and\neighth decades of the twentieth century and later into orbit around\nMars and far out into interstellar space would only be used for\npurposes of communication. Project Needles, or, if you want to be\nstrictly technical, Project West Ford.\n\nGod grant that they may some day be used in no other way. But when a\nman climbs out on the airframe of a sky ship, for the sole purpose of\nblowing it up----\n\nThere is only one way I can do justice to the speed with which it\nhappened and the awful, mind-numbing finality of it. It is not\nsomething which should be recorded in a paragraph, a page, but in two\nsentences at most.\n\nCommander Littlefield issued a command, and a light on the instrument\npanel blinked, and a million magnetized filaments converged, united and\nso united, converged again on the airframe of the sky ship. There was a\nblinding flash of light and the tiny human figure was gone.\n\nThe first words Commander Littlefield spoke, after that, were to me.\n\n\"Whoever he was, he must have wanted her dead pretty badly ... to have\nbeen willing to blow up the sky ship and kill himself in the process.\"\n\nThere was a strange look on his face and his gray eyes met mine with a\nquestion in them.\n\nThen he spoke the question aloud. \"Or was it you, Ralph, whom he had in\nmind?\"\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\nThe clang of the opening port was still ringing in my ears when I\nwalked out of the sky ship with Joan on my arm and looked down over the\nbig metal corkscrew directly beneath me. I knew straight off I'd made\na mistake. I should have looked up at the sky instead. I should have\nsquared my shoulders, drawn the crisp, tangy air deep into my hangs and\nestablished rapport with Mars more gradually.\n\nA delay of only a moment or two would have spared me the too sudden\nshock of finding myself three hundred feet in the air, dazzled by an\nunexpected brightness, and supported by nothing I'd have cared to trust\nmy weight to on Earth.\n\nWe were standing on a thin strip of metal, a mere spiderweb tracery,\nand if I'd lost my balance and gone crashing through the guard rail\nthere would have been no mountaineer's rope to save me. What was worse,\nI'd have taken Joan with me.\n\nThe danger was illusionary, of course ... solely in my mind. The\nunderwriters go to a great deal of expense and trouble to make sure\nthere will be no tragic accidents when the big risks have been left\nbehind in space.\n\nThe guard rail was chest-high and sturdy enough, and no one had ever\ngone crashing through it. But you can't reason with a feeling, and for\nan instant the yawning emptiness beneath me made me feel that I was\nalready past the rail, twisting and turning, flailing the air in a\nthree-hundred-foot plunge.\n\nI was sure that Joan was experiencing the same kind of irrational\ngiddiness, for she drew in her breath sharply and a shiver went\nthrough her. A fear of great heights is one phobia that is shared by\npractically everyone.\n\nThe big metal corkscrew beneath us was the landing frame into which\nthe rocket had descended and we were standing high up on that enormous\nspiral, which curved down and outward like an immense silvery cocoon.\n\nA figure of speech, sure. But not as wide of the mark as most of the\nimages that flash across your mind when you're keyed up abnormally and\na lot of new colors, and sights and sounds rush in on you and upset all\nof your calculations as to how sober-minded you're going to stay. Your\ngrasp on reality slips a little, as if you were holding it right before\nyour eyes like a book, and wearing glasses so strong that the print\nblurs. You're in a fantasy world of your own creating, seeing things\nthat can't be blamed on whoever wrote the book. A fussy, unimaginative\nlittle guy, perhaps, who has spent most of his life within sight of his\nown doorstep and has never felt the great winds of space blowing cold\nupon him.\n\nThere's a big, night-flying Sphinx moth with death-heads on each of its\nwings, and there were times when I'd thought of the Mars ship as not so\ndifferent from that kind of moth. And now it was as if the sky ship had\nturned back into a caterpillar again, and spun a cocoon for itself, and\nwas quietly reposing in the pupa stage, its rust-red end vanes folded\nback, its long length mottled and space-eroded where the atomic jets\nhad seared it.\n\nThere was nothing wrong in giving my imagination carte-blanche to go\ninto free fall like that, because when you're standing on a dizzy\nheight staring down at a new world forty million miles from Earth\nyou've got to let the strangeness and bursting wonder of it ... along\nwith the dire forebodings ... take firm hold of you. Otherwise you\nwon't feel yourself to be a part of it, won't be equipped with what it\ntakes to probe beneath the surface of things in a realistic way and\nfeel like a native son even in the presence of the unknown.\n\nThree hundred feet below me more activity was taking place than I had\never seen crowded into an area of equal size on Earth. Just as a guess,\nI'd have said that the spaceport's disembarkation section was about six\nhundred feet square. But right at that moment I had no real stomach for\nguessing games--only a hollowness where my stomach was supposed to be.\n\nFar below the disembarkation section was in high gear, and the clatter\nof it, the rushings to and fro, the grinding and screeching of giant\ncranes, and atomic tractors, and rising platforms crowded to capacity\nwith specialized robots, most of them scissor-thin and all of them\noperated by remote control ... would have half-deafened me if I'd been\nstanding a hundred feet lower down.\n\nEven from the top of the spiral the clamor had to be heard to be\nbelieved. But what astounded me most was the newness, brightness,\nsharply delineated aspect of everything within range of my vision.\nI could see clear to the edge of the spaceport, and the four other\nsecurely-berthed rockets stood out with a startling clarity, their nose\ncones gleaming in the bright Martian sunlight. The big lifting cranes\nstood out just as sharply, and although the zigzagging tractors looked\nlike painted toys, red and blue and yellow, I would have sworn under\noath that not one of them cast a shadow.\n\nThe twenty-five or thirty human midgets who were moving in all\ndirections across the field, between machines that seemed too\nformidable to be trusted had the brittle, sheen-bright look of figures\ncut out of isinglass.\n\nAnother illusion, of course. There had to be shadows, because there\nwas nothing on Mars that could have brought about that big a change in\nthe laws of optics. But by the same token the length and density of\nshadows can be altered a bit by atmospheric conditions, making light\ninterception turn playful. So I didn't strain my eyes searching for\ndeep purple halos around the human midges.\n\nMy only immediate concern was to reassure Joan in a calm and forceful\nway and escort her safely down to ground level, without letting her\nsuspect that I shared her misgivings as to the stability of the spiral.\n\nIt was ridiculous on the face of it. But, as I've said, you can't argue\nwith a feeling that whispers that your remote, dawn age ancestors must\nhave felt the same way when they climbed out on a limb overhanging a\nprecipice, and felt the whole tree begin to sway and shake beneath them.\n\n\"Hold tight to the rail and don't look down,\" I cautioned. \"There's\nno real danger ... because a first-rate welding job was done on this\nstructure. Barring an earthquake, it should be just as safe a century\nfrom now.\"\n\nI shot a quick, concerned glance at her along with the warning. I guess\nI must have thought she'd be more shaken than she was, for she smiled\nwhen she saw the look of surprise in my eyes. It took me half a minute\nto realize that my guess as to how she'd be taking it hadn't gone so\nwide of the mark. Her pallor gave her away.\n\n\"A century would be much too long to wait,\" she breathed. \"Another five\nminutes would be too long. If it's going to collapse, I'd rather find\nout right now.\"\n\nI nodded and we started down. Several other passengers had emerged from\nthe port and were looking up at the sky or downward as I'd done. Three\nmen and a woman had emerged ahead of us and were almost at the base of\nthe spiral. So far nothing had happened to them.\n\nI've often toyed with the thought that there may be windows in the mind\nwe can see out of sometimes--at oblique angles and around corners and\nwithout turning our heads. I could visualize the passengers who were\ndescending behind us more clearly than you usually can in a mind's eye\npicture. Each face was in sharp focus and there was no blurring of\ntheir images as they moved. It was as if I was staring straight up at\nthem through a crystal-clear pane of glass.\n\nIn that astonishingly bright inner vision--why look up and back when I\ndid not doubt its accuracy?--Commander Littlefield was wasting no time\nin setting a good example. He'd descended the spiral so many times that\ngreat height meant nothing to him. He'd be ascending and descending at\nleast ten more times just in the next few hours. But this was his big\nmoment. I could already picture him striding across the disembarkation\nsection to the Administration Unit with his shoulders held straight,\nand announcing officially, with a ring of pride in his voice, that the\ntrip had been completed in record time, and the rocket had been berthed\nsuccessfully. He was descending now with a confident smile on his lips,\nhis Mars' legs buoyantly supporting him.\n\nBehind him came the small group who had been closest to us in space.\nThey were doing their best to stay calm, but there was a slight flicker\nof apprehension in their eyes. Our section had been the first to\ndisembark, because Littlefield had agreed with me that it might have\nseemed a little strange if I'd been accorded that privilege and it had\nbeen denied to the others. Why give anyone who might have outwitted\nevery screening precaution the idea that I might be a man apart, with\nso big a job awaiting me on Mars that getting started on it without\ndelay was damned important to me. It was natural enough for one or two\nsections to be cleared fast and emerge with the Commander. But others\nwould have to await their turn in line and quarantine checkups could\ndrag along for hours.\n\n\"It's funny how long it takes to get even a little lower when you're\nthis high up,\" Joan said, her fingers tightening on my arm. \"We're not\nanything like as high as when we started. But nothing down below looks\nany larger.\"\n\n\"We're not a fourth of the way down, and the human eye is a very poor\njudge of distances,\" I said, reassuringly. \"It would be better if you\nlet go of my arm and just kept your right hand on the rail. We sway\nmore this way.\"\n\n\"When you look down from the observation roof of the North-Western\nUniversity Building you can see all of New Chicago, and practically\nhalf of Lake Michigan,\" she complained breathlessly. \"But it never made\nme feel as giddy as this.\"\n\n\"You had a firmer support under you,\" I said. \"But not a safer one.\nThere's no danger at all. You can be absolutely sure of that. What\ncould happen to us?\"\n\nIt was one of those silly questions you sometimes ask when you want to\nreassure someone you're a little concerned about. But a silly question\ncan sometimes be answered in a totally unexpected way--suddenly,\nterribly and with explosive violence. It can be answered by a voice\nof thunder out of the sky, or a wild, savage cry in the night, or in\na quieter way, but with just as terrifying an outcome. There are a\nhundred cataclysms of nature which can give the lie to what you thought\nwas only a silliness.\n\nNo matter where you are or how secure you feel, never ask what\ncould happen in a world where nothing is sure, where no one is ever\ncompletely safe. Death is death. From end to end of his big estate may\nbe a lifetime's journey for some men. But he can cover the distance\nwith the speed of light, because Death is one space traveler--the only\none--who knows exactly how to outdistance light.\n\nEven if you're alone in a steel-walled vault it's a dangerous question\nto ask. It's ten times as dangerous when you're descending a swaying\nmetal corkscrew forty million miles from Earth and there may be someone\neighty feet above you who has failed twice as Death's emissary and\nwould be covered with shame if it happened again.\n\nI felt hardly anything for an instant when the dart sliced deep into\nthe soft flesh between my shoulder blades. I didn't even know it was\na dart and kept right on walking. It was as if a bee had stung me--a\ntired bee who couldn't sting very hard. There was just a little stab of\npain, a burning sensation that lasted less than a second.\n\nI felt it, all right. But it didn't startle me enough to stop me dead\nin my tracks. A thing like that seldom does, if you're moving steadily\nforward. It takes a second or two after you've felt the pain for the\nimplications to dawn on you.\n\nWhen they did the pain was back, and this time it was excruciating.\nMy whole shoulder was laced with fire, as if a red-hot iron had been\nlaid against it. If right at that moment I'd smelled an odor of burning\nflesh I'd have been sure there could be no other explanation, despite\nits transparent absurdity.\n\nEven then I kept right on walking. I staggered a little but I bit\ndown hard on my underlip to avoid crying out. I didn't want to alarm\nJoan until I was sure. It could still have been just a very severe\nmuscular spasm--the kind of agonizing cramp that can hit you in the leg\nsometimes in the middle of the night, so that you awake out of a deep\nsleep bathed in cold sweat, and with your teeth chattering.\n\nThat was what seemed to be happening now. My teeth started chattering\nand I could feel sweat oozing out all over me. There was only one\ndifference. The pain was in my shoulder, not my leg, and it wasn't\neasing up the way spasm pain does after a minute or two. It couldn't\nhave gotten worse, because it had been excruciating from the beginning.\nBut other things started getting worse fast. The burning sensation\nspread to my lungs and my throat muscles started constricting, so that\nevery breath I drew was an agony.\n\nI couldn't pretend any longer, and I didn't try to. I went down on\nmy knees, clutching at my chest and swaying back against the rail. I\nsuppose I must have groaned or made some sort of sound, because Joan\nswung about and was kneeling beside me in an instant, her face ashen.\n\nI must have looked terrible, or all of the color would not have drained\nout of her face so fast, or her eyes gone quite so wide with alarm.\n\nI made a half-hearted try at straightening up, but only succeeded in\nbringing my collapse closer to zero-count by sagging more heavily back\nagainst the rail.\n\n\"Darling, what is it? _Tell me!_\" Her voice was demanding, wildly\ninsistent. \"Please ... I've got to know. If it's your heart--\"\n\nI shook my head. I went through a kind of little death just trying to\nget a few words out. \"Something struck me ... in the back. See ... what\nit is. Feel around with your hand.\"\n\n\"All right, darling. Just don't move. No--you'll have to lift yourself\nup a little more. Try, darling. Your back's right against the rail.\"\n\nI did more than try. I helped her by gritting my teeth and flopping\nover on my stomach. But the pain that lanced through my chest made me\nalmost black out for an instant.\n\nThere was a clamor above us now, and I thought I heard Littlefield's\nvoice raised in a shout, followed by a scream of terror. Possibly\nsomeone had seen me slump and jumped to the conclusion that the spiral\nwas collapsing.\n\nThere was no chance of that, so I couldn't have cared less how close to\npanic the people up above were. Right at the moment it didn't concern\nme. I was only concerned with what Joan might find when her fingers\nstarted probing. If a bullet had ploughed into me and her fingers came\naway wetly red I'd know for sure whether it was as bad as I feared. It\nhelps to know, when there's a tormenting uncertainty in your mind along\nwith the physical pain.\n\nI could feel her hand fumbling with my shirt, getting it loosened. Then\nthey were moving up, down and across my back. Cautiously, gently, with\nthe nurselike competence which women usually manage to summon to their\naid in an emergency, no matter how shaken they are.\n\nAfter a moment her fingers stopped moving and she drew in her breath\nsharply.\n\nBeing in agony and on the verge of blacking out carries with it a\npenalty. You can't always hear what someone close to you may be saying,\neven when it's of life-and-death importance.\n\nI caught a few words, however, just enough to know it was a dart before\nI lost consciousness. And her look told me what kind of dart it was.\n\nOr maybe it wasn't her look, just what I knew about darts in general.\nThe kind of dart that's in common use today as a weapon is quite unlike\nthe primitive blowgun darts of South American Indians a century ago.\nScience, like everything else, progresses, especially in the field of\nweapons. The modern dart is just as simple, in a way, but you take it\nout of a wafer-thin metal case as you would a hypodermic needle and\nyou fit the three parts very carefully together and you use a liquid\npropellant to blow it out of a very slender tube of gleaming metal. And\nthere's space in it for poison.\n\nIt's handier, tidier than the small robot killers with their intricate\ninternal gadgetry, even though it requires precision aiming and you're\nmuch more likely to be observed while you're taking aim, and be\ncompelled to pay the customary penalty for murder.\n\nI'd managed to roll back on my side, and lying then in agony, trying to\ncatch what Joan was saying, sort of telescoped all that for me, so that\nit registered in my mind in a more rapid way than it does when you're\ntrying to explain it academically. Everything I knew about darts came\nsweeping into my mind, and I remembered something else that helped to\nexplain the agony.\n\nThe modern dart changes shape the instant it enters a man's body,\nopening up like a pair of six-bladed scissors, cutting, slashing,\nsevering veins and muscles and nerve ganglions. And if it strikes an\nartery--\n\nIt doesn't even have to be a poisoned dart to kill a man. The feathered\npart remains in the wound, only slightly embedded. But if you have any\nsense you resist an impulse to pull it out, because when you do that\nit's very difficult to stop the bleeding. It's a job for a skilled\nsurgeon and Joan's look told me that there was no time to be lost. The\nwisest thing I could do was to put my complete trust in Commander\nLittlefield. The quicker he got one of the passengers or a crewman to\nhelp him carry me down to ground level and bundle me into an ambulance\nthe better my chances would be.\n\nJoan seemed to be one jump ahead of me, for she leapt up quickly\nand started back up the spiral. She didn't even press my hand in\nreassurance, but that was all right with me. I knew why she hadn't.\nEvery second counted, and she loved me too much to be anything but\nfirmly practical about it.\n\nI remember thinking, just before I blacked out, _how adequate are the\nhospital facilities here? And what about the surgeons? Oh God, what if\nthey are fifth-raters, what if the hospital is understaffed? What if\nthey bungle it, but good?_\n\nWhen you black out and stay blacked out for a long period, questions\nlike that lose most of their tormenting aspects. You may still feel\nemotionally disturbed by them, when the darkness lifts a little and\nyou remember having asked yourself questions someone somewhere should\nhave answered--if you'd only stayed around long enough to make a lot\nof friends and influence people and make them eager to oblige you in\nevery possible way. But it isn't too disturbing, because you can't even\nremember what the questions were.\n\nThe trouble was ... I didn't stay blacked out. Not completely. I woke\nup at intervals and heard snatches of conversation and I even saw--the\nMars Colony.\n\nI saw quite a bit of the Colony before they eased me down in a hospital\nbed, and covered me with warm blankets and I blacked out again.\n\nI saw the streets I'd traveled forty million miles to visit, and the\npeople I'd come to make friends with, and the kids in their space\nhelmets, looking precisely as they did on Earth. (What further frontier\ndid they hope to explore ... Alpha Centauri or just one of the giant\nouter planets?) I saw the prefabricated metal buildings, four, eight\nand twenty stories high, with their slanting roofs, rust-red and\nverdigris-green blue in the early morning sunlight and the stores\nthat were all glass and the strange looking supermarkets with their\nalmost cathedral-like domes. And just for good measure, eight or ten\nbar-flanked streets with big parking lots where the bars gave way\nto barracks that straggled out into the desert and had a primitive,\ntwentieth century, shanty-town look.\n\nThere were people everywhere, but when you're propped up on a cot in\na speeding ambulance you can't tell whether the people who go flying\npast look just the way people do on Earth, or have a more robust,\nhappier look. Or a more restless and discontented look. It's even\nhard to tell whether young people or middle-aged people predominate,\nor just how many very old people there are. Or how many infants in\narms, except that there did seem to be an exceptionally large number\nof children, either being wheeled or carried or toddling along in the\nwake of their parents, or playing games with the fierce competitiveness\nof twelve-year-olds in fenced-in sand lots which no one had taken the\ntrouble to pave.\n\nThere were theaters too--places of amusement, anyway--which you could\ntell featured lively entertainment just from the gaudy blue and yellow\nposters on their facades.\n\nThat there were machines clattering past goes without saying. A\ntremendous amount of new construction was under way in every part of\nthe Colony and if you just say \"Mars\" in a word association test one\nman or woman in three will come right back with \"Machinery.\"\n\nThere were pipes, too--huge and branching, big, shining metal tubes\nthat arched above buildings and ran parallel with almost every street\nin the Colony. A tremendous brood of writhing snakes was what they\nreminded me of--the artificial kind that kids delight in scaring people\nwith at birthday parties, all mottled over with the bronze sheen of\ncopperheads, but looking more like boa constrictors in their tremendous\ngirth.\n\nAnother kind of snake image flashed into my mind as I stared out\nthrough the windows of the ambulance at that interlocking power-fuel\nnetwork. It came swimming right out of the history books I'd poured\nover in fascination when I was knee-high to a grasshopper. Sure, they\nwere Diamond Back rattlesnakes and the Mars Colony was right out of the\nOld West of covered-wagon and gold-prospecting days.\n\nOf course it wasn't, because the twenty-first century technology had\nmade it completely modern in some respects. But it was like the Old\nWest in a good many other ways. It had the same rugged, mirage-bright\npioneer look, as if the desert sands were blowing right into the heart\nof the colony, swirling about, filling the windy places and the sand\nlots where the kids were playing with a haze that could just as easily\nhave been gold dust that some careless, giant-size prospector had\nspilled by accident when he'd brought it in from the hills for weighing.\n\nActually, there's nothing on Earth or Mars that can completely shatter\nthat cyclic aspect of history. There's nothing so new that you can look\nat it and say, \"There's nothing of the past here. The break is complete\nand the past is gone forever and can never return again.\"\n\nIt's just not true. The past does return, shining brightly beneath the\nbold new pattern, the daring new way of life that Man likes to think he\nhas chiseled from a block of marble that human hands have never touched\nor human eyes rested upon before.\n\nThere's no such block of marble in all the universe of stars. Not\nreally, because what Man can visualize he has already seen and it\nhas become a part of his heritage and the past of that heritage goes\nflowing into it and he starts off with a veined monolith that is\nbrimming over with human memory patterns, with not a few buried deep in\nthe stone.\n\nBut I've forgotten to mention the most important aspect of everything\nI saw through the windows of that speeding ambulance. It was ... the\nblurred aspect, the way everything kept changing shape and disappearing\nand pinwheeling at times. It wasn't surprising, because the agony was\nstill with me and I saw everything in fitful starts, in brief flashes,\nbetween bouts of blacking out and coming to and blacking out again. But\nwhat I did see I saw clearly, with the heightened awareness that often\naccompanies almost unbearable pain. When white-hot needles of pain are\njabbing at your nerves a strange, almost blinding kind of illumination\nseems to sweep into the brain. But instead of blinding you it makes\neverything stand out with a startling clarity and you can think clearly\ntoo, and even speculate about what you've seen.\n\nIt's as if you were caught up in a kind of sharper-than-life dream\nsequence, or sitting in a darkened theater watching events take place\non a dazzlingly bright screen. You may be doubled up with pain, but\nyou keep your eyes on the screen and very little that is happening\nto the actors and actresses on a dramatic level is lost on you. You\neven notice small details of background scenery that would escape\nyour attention ordinarily, and exactly what kind of clothes the\nactresses are wearing. Light summer dresses with plunging necklines or\ntight-fitting, form-molded swim suits--things you can't help noticing\neven when you're doubled up with pain. It's why most of us fight to\nstay alive, because Nature has made us that way to keep us from letting\ngo of the one thing that makes us stay in the pitcher's box when Death\nis batting a thousand.\n\nPutting that much stress just on the engendering of life may be a trick\nand a snare, when Death has set so cruel a trap for the winners, but\nyou seldom hear anyone complaining about it. It takes an awful lot\nof grief and despair and pain to make anyone angrily resent the sex\nsnare, and take to eulogizing Death instead.\n\nIt wasn't the reason everything I saw through the windows of the\nambulance registered so sharply in fitful flashes, because I had _that_\nright at my side. Joan was holding my hand and squeezing it and I only\nhad to turn my head to make me just about the toughest adversary Death\never had. But what I said about the lighted cinema screen still holds.\nWhat I did see, I saw with eyes that missed very little. And between\nthe bouts of blacking out the snatches of conversation I overheard came\nto me just as distinctly.\n\nPart of the time it was a woman's voice I heard and I knew it had to be\nJoan's voice, because there was no other woman in the ambulance with\nme. But she wasn't talking to me. She was talking to one of the two men\nin white who were sitting opposite me. They seemed about a half-mile\naway most of the time, but occasionally the long bench they were\nsitting on floated a little closer.\n\nThe conversation, as I've said, came to me in snatches and it could\nhardly have been called a running dialogue. The continuity alone would\nhave gotten a professional script writer fired, no matter how brilliant\nhe was otherwise.\n\nThe only way I can whip it into shape is by recording it as if it were\ncontinuous, filling in the part I overheard between blackouts with what\nI didn't hear--staying close enough to what was probably being said to\nkeep the script writer on the job and eating.\n\nI'm pretty sure this is a fairly accurate re-write.\n\nJoan: What kind of a hospital is it? I'm sorry, I ... I guess I\nshouldn't have asked you that. You're on the staff. No matter how frank\nyou might want to be....\n\nDoctor Mile-Away: If I thought it wasn't a good hospital I wouldn't\nsay so, naturally. But it happens to match up very well with the eight\nor ten you'd want him to be taken to Earthside, if you had a choice.\nThe facilities are first-rate, completely up to date. There are four\nsurgeons I'd trust my life to with equal confidence ... and one of them\nhappens to be my dad.\n\nJoan: I hope to God he gets one of them.\n\nDoctor: There are only four surgeons. We don't get too many surgical\ncases in the Colony--not nearly as many as you might think. There's as\nmuch violence here, perhaps, as there is in New Chicago but it takes a\ndifferent form. We can't keep atomic hand-guns out of criminal hands as\neasily as you can in New Chicago, because the lawless element in the\nColony has more socio-political power and can get more weapons in that\ndestructive category smuggled in. As you know, an atomic hand-gun has\na very limited destructive potential, since there's no fallout and it\ncan only kill a man standing directly in its path. But when it does ...\nthere isn't much margin left for surgery.\n\nJoan: You mean _criminals_ are in control here?\n\nDoctor: Oh, it's not quite that bad. Possibly about one colonist in\ntwenty has dangerous criminal tendencies. The proportion is larger here\nonly because it's a new society, with a pioneering outlook. You might\ncall it a wolf-eat-wolf society. On Earth the dog-eat-dog tendencies\nwill probably never be completely eradicated but we've gone a long way\nin that respect just in the last half-century. Here we have further to\ngo, because the dogs are still wolves.\n\nJoan: Will you ever tame them? My husband may be dying right here; that\ndoesn't look so tame! I think your Mars Colony is a filthy jungle!\n\nDoctor: I didn't have much time to talk with Commander Littlefield. But\nfrom what _he_ said I'm pretty sure you don't really feel that way.\nI don't know why you and your husband are here, but the Colonization\nBoard seldom gives clearance to people who feel that way about the\nfuture of the Colony. In fact ... I can't remember ever having met a\nman or woman who managed to deceive the Board, because the screening\nis the opposite of superficial. They go into your past history, I\nunderstand, and give you psychological tests I'm not even sure I could\npass, convinced as I am that the Colony is still Man's best hope in a\nworld where to stand still is always disastrous. There's no other sane\nsolution to the population problem, just to mention one of the fifty or\nsixty major problems we'll have to solve or perish in in the next two\ncenturies. I have my moments of doubt and cynicism....\n\nJoan: You should be having one right now. How would _you_ feel if you\nwere taking your wife to the hospital for an emergency operation and\ndidn't know whether she was going to live or die? Suppose it was your\nwife instead of my husband? We didn't even have time to set foot in the\nColony. If there's that much danger before you even--\n\nDoctor: Just hold on a minute. Let's get this straightened out right\nnow. It will make you feel better. No one in the Colony tried to kill\nyour husband. That dart was aimed at him from above--by one of the\npassengers. They're all being held for questioning and if the firing\nmechanism is found on one of them--\n\nThat, for me, was the end of the dialogue. But just before I blacked\nout for the last time I saw a sign high up over one of the buildings.\nIt read: WENDEL ATOMICS.\n\nAnd I went down into the darkness with that sign flashing in big\nilluminated letters right in the middle of the darkness. WENDEL\nATOMICS. WENDEL. WENDEL ATOMICS. And in much smaller letters, which\nwere not nearly as bright: _Endicott Fuel_.\n\nThe big letters growing larger, brighter ... the small letters\ndwindling.\n\nJust as I felt myself to be dwindling ... as I passed deeper and deeper\ninto the darkness.\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\"He's a big man,\" I heard a woman's voice say. \"It took every ounce of\nmy strength to lift him. But he had to be moved to the edge of the bed,\ndoctor. The sheets had to be changed.\"\n\nA whirling in my head, needles darting in and out. I had to strain my\nears to catch what another voice was saying in reply. It was a man's\nvoice, but gruff, deep-throated and somehow less distinct than the\nfirst voice. Perhaps Gruff Voice was standing further from the bed. Or\npossibly he didn't want me to hear what he was telling the nurse.\n\nShe had to be a nurse, because Gruff Voice wasn't addressing her\nby name. He wasn't calling her Miss Hadley or Miss Betty Anne\nSimpson-Cruickshank. He was saying \"Nurse this,\" and \"Nurse that\" and\nspeaking with crisp authority, as if there was a gulf between a nurse\nand a doctor which even the kindliest, least hidebound of physicians\nhad no right to ignore.\n\nI rather liked his voice, gruff as it was. He spoke with the air of a\nman who knew his business, with a kind of restrained sympathy--the \"no\nnonsense\" approach. Too much calm self-assurance can be irritating,\nbecause it usually goes with the inflated egos of people who think very\nhighly of themselves. But in a doctor you don't object to that sort of\nthing so much.\n\n\"He's waking up,\" Gruff Voice was saying. \"Just let him rest and don't\nencourage him to talk. No more sedation--he won't need it. Did you take\nhis temperature, Nurse?\"\n\n\"Just ten minutes ago, Doctor. It's on the chart. I always--\"\n\n\"Put it down immediately? Who do you think you're kidding, Susan,\nmy love? Once in awhile you put it off, when this kind of emergency\ncase makes you wish you had a dozen pairs of hands. You put if off\nfor fifteen or twenty minutes, when you've no reason to think some\nwhite-coated drum major is going to barge in unexpectedly, just to lean\non you. Did you ever know me to lean, Susan--heavily or otherwise?\nYou're doing the best you can and it's a very good 'best.' I wish we\nhad more 'bests' like it.\"\n\n\"I do feel ... sort of wobbly, Roger. I deserve to be leaned on,\nbecause once you start feeling that way you're no longer at peak\nefficiency and you become nervously over-scrupulous. That's both good\nand bad, if you know what I mean.\"\n\n\"What did you expect, Susan? I could have had a nurse in here to\nrelieve you hours ago if you hadn't been so stubborn. You've been\nworrying your cute blonde head off without stopping to rest for sixteen\nhours, and you never set eyes on the guy before this morning. What is\nthere about some men--\"\n\n\"It was touch and go, Roger. You said yourself that a little of the\npoison got into his blood. You told me a tenth of a cc would have been\nfatal.\"\n\n\"That was when I first looked at the lab analysis and took the\ngloomiest possible view of his chances. I didn't even know you heard\nme. Damn it all, Susan. Can't a doctor think out loud without giving\nhis most competent nurse a martyr complex? What is there about him? I'm\nasking you. If he wasn't married I could perhaps understand it. I could\nat least make a stab at trying to figure it out. But you've seen his\nwife. A man with a wife as attractive as she is would have to be even\nmore susceptible than I am to look twice at another woman. That's just\nanother way of saying it couldn't happen.\"\n\n\"I've had two long talks with her, Roger. She loves him so much that\nif anything happened to him I'm afraid to think what she might do. All\nalone on Mars, with no close relatives or friends to turn to for help\nand warmth and comfort. She'd need a lot of support, because there's\nnothing shallow about her. She's the intense type, very deep in her\nemotions. I'm that way myself.\"\n\n\"You don't have to tell me,\" I could hear him saying. \"You're the\nempathy-plus type. It's what makes a good many otherwise sensible women\nembrace the toughest profession on the list. Hard-boiled, unemotional\nwomen make good nurses too. But I prefer the kind of nurse you can't\nhelp being. Only ... a little moderation even in people who go all out\ncan be a saving grace.\"\n\n\"But don't you see, Roger? It means I can identify with her. I know\nexactly how terrible the uncertainty must be for her, because if I\nloved a man that much and lost him I'd probably go right out and kill\nmyself. If you want the full truth ... there's probably a little of\nthe male-female absurdity mixed up in it too. It's an absurdity in a\nsituation like this, where it makes no sense. But just the fact that\nhe's a man and I'm a woman--\"\n\n\"Talk like that will get you nowhere,\" he said. \"I'm too sure of you.\"\n\nThere was a rustling sound and a sudden gasp and I was pretty sure I\nknew what it meant. He'd taken her into his arms and was kissing her.\nI don't know why I didn't open my eyes. I was fully awake now, aware\nof every movement in the room. But I just remained quiet and listened,\ngrateful that the needles had stopped jabbing at my temples and my\ndizziness was practically gone.\n\nSometimes when you awake suddenly from a deep sleep your eyes feel\nglued shut, and it takes an effort just to open them. You let it ride\nfor a moment, while you pull yourself together ... especially if it's a\nnightmare you've just awakened from. There's a kind of pleasure in it.\n\nHe was talking again. \"I've yet to meet a woman who doesn't think that\nclinical self-analysis will keep a man guessing about her. But that\nkind of candor will get you nowhere with me, kiddo. I know you too\nwell. Are you convinced?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, with a meekness that surprised me.\n\nHe didn't say anything for a moment, but I could hear him moving about\nand a metallic click, as if he were folding up his stethoscope or\nreturning a hypodermic to its case.\n\nA sound like that is always a little unnerving and an operating table\nand a long row of gleaming instruments flashed evanescently across\nmy mind. I wondered how bad it was and if Martian hospitals were\nwell-equipped, and had just the right facilities to take care of an\nemergency case requiring major surgery.\n\nBut he'd said I was out of danger, hadn't he ... that I didn't even\nneed more sedation? Sure he had. I'd been stabbed with a poisoned\ndart, but that didn't mean I'd have to go on the operating table. They\nwould never have let the dart stay inside me. If an operation had been\nneeded, it would have been performed immediately....\n\nPerhaps it had. Well, to hell with it. I was out of danger now and\nbeginning to mend and that was the only thing that counted. It had been\ntouch and go, she'd said. And Joan loved me so much that....\n\nHold on tight to that, Ralphie boy. It's the best news you'll ever\nhear, even though you knew it all along, were sure of it on the day you\nmarried her. What they didn't know and would have to guess about was\nthe feeling of oneness we had whenever we were together.\n\nI let that ride too, sweet as it was to dwell upon, and thought about\nhow mistaken I'd been about the doctor. He wasn't the kind of guy\nI'd thought him. The \"nurse this, nurse that\" talk had been either a\nperformance, put on for my benefit just in case I was a little more\nthan semiconscious or--a routine, quickly-dropped formality.\n\nThe second supposition seemed the most likely. A kind of ritual they\nwent through from habit, and because it's more ethical to keep a\ndoctor-nurse relationship on a formal plane when the patient is under\nclinical scrutiny. After that, they could relax and be human.\n\nI had no complaint, because I liked both aspects of Gruff Voice's\npersonality. That I liked the nurse goes without saying, not only\nbecause of what she'd said about Joan, but because of a certain\nsomething....\n\nAll right. Gruff Voice had said that he was susceptible beyond the\naverage and so was I. A sweet soft woman bending over you, denying\nherself sleep just to make sure you'll stay alive, doing her best to\nease your pain, sort of ... does things to you. It had nothing to do\nwith the way I felt about Joan. It wasn't actual disloyalty ... didn't\ncome within a mile of disloyalty. It was just the man-woman absurdity\nshe'd mentioned, only ... it wasn't an absurdity and never had been.\n\nIt may be a hard thing for a woman to understand, sometimes. But it's\nnever hard for a man to understand, if he's honest with himself and\nknows just how powerful the mating impulse can be in human beings.\nCall it sex attraction if you want to, but when you've called it that\nit's important to remember that the mating impulse is the basic,\nanthropological prime mover. Sex is simply its _modus operandi_. On\nEarth and on Mars, whenever a normal man and a normal woman are in\nclose proximity, even for ten or twelve seconds, the mating impulse\nstarts unwinding. On another planet of another star the _modus\noperandi_ may not be sex as we know it, but something quite different,\nif you can imagine another way of choosing a mate, building a home, and\nfilling it with healthy, happy children.\n\nIt's a coiled-spring, trigger-mechanism kind of impulse and neither the\nman nor the woman have to be attracted to each other on the personality\nlevel, unless you want to be technical and regard the purely physical\nas an attribute of personality. They can be young or old, plain or good\nlooking. Some attraction will be present, even under the most adverse\ncircumstances. But when the woman is young and beautiful and the\npersonality level warm and appealing you'll be deceiving yourself if\nyou think the impulse can be kept from arising just because you already\nhave a mate you're desperately in love with.\n\nYou can conquer the impulse if you try hard enough and your love for\nsomeone else is strong enough. That's what is meant by loyalty. But you\ncan't keep the impulse from arising and it makes no sense at all to\nfeel guilty about it.\n\nThe human brain is a resourceful instrument and there are a dozen ways\nof keeping a tight grip on your nerves when you wake up on a hospital\ncot and hear unfamiliar voices talking about you. I chose the way that\nwas most natural to me. I concentrated on the scientific construct\nI've just summarized, letting my mind glide over, and play around with\nit for a minute or two and telling myself that I must thank the nurse\nfor all that she had done for me. When Gruff Voice left there would be\na glow, a brief moment of warmth between us that might have become a\nhigh-leaping flame if I hadn't been in love with Joan and she hadn't\nbeen carrying a torch for Gruff Voice.\n\nI wasn't even sure she was beautiful, but it seemed likely, because you\ncan tell a great deal about a woman just from the sound of her voice.\nEven if she bent over and kissed me, her eyes shining a little because\nshe'd helped me outdistance Death a yard from the finish line and was\nfeeling grateful and thrilled about it ... well, that would have been\nall right too. I didn't think Joan or the man who had just taken her\ninto his arms would have held that kind of kiss against us.\n\nI had the feeling that Gruff Voice was a generous-minded, all right\nguy, and if an operation had been necessary to save my life he'd done\nhis best to increase my chances with all of the surgical know-how at\nhis command.\n\nJust that thought made me decide to open my eyes and try to raise\nmyself a little, because he had a right to know how grateful I felt.\n\nHe was just going through the door. I could see that he was tall, blond\nand rather sturdily built, but a wave of dizziness made me sink back\nagainst the pillows again before I could get a really good look at him.\nIt's hard to tell what a man looks like anyway, when he's facing away\nfrom you, and you can only see his disappearing shoulders and the back\nof his head.\n\nWhen I opened my eyes for the second time, a full minute later, the\neyes that looked back at me were just as I'd pictured them. A deep,\nlustrous brown. Her face was very much as I'd pictured it too, except\nthat I'd no way of knowing whether she was a blonde or a brunette. She\nlooked a little like Joan. Her hair was done up in a different way, and\nher lips were a little fuller than Joan's and her cheekbones not quite\nso prominent. Her nose, too, was a fraction of an inch shorter. But\notherwise she could have passed for Joan's sister. Not a twin sister,\nfor the resemblance wasn't anything like that pronounced. But it was\nclose to the family likeness you see quite often in portraits of two\nsisters when one is smiling and the other looks seriously troubled.\n\nIt flashed across my mind that if they had been standing side by side,\nboth wearing the same expression, the resemblance would have been\nconsiderably more striking.\n\nIt shouldn't have surprised me too much, because of what she'd said\nto the doctor. Women who think and feel in much the same way are very\nlikely to bear a family resemblance physically. It's the sort of thing\nwhich makes an anthropologist shake his head in vigorous denial. But\nfacts are facts and who was I to dispute them?\n\n\"Just lie quiet,\" she whispered, patting me on the shoulder. \"Dr.\nCrawford says you mustn't try to talk. You're going to be all right.\nI'm Miss Cherubin, your day nurse.\"\n\nShe smiled, her eyes crinkling a little at the corners. \"You should\nhave a night nurse too, but I've been staying on in her place.\"\n\nCherubin. An angel? No--cherubim was spelt with an \"M.\" And she wasn't\n_that_ young or quite as rosy-cheeked as cherubs are supposed to be.\n\nWhat made it really tragic was my inability to reach out and touch her\nor ask her a single question, because right at that moment another wave\nof dizziness swept over me and I blacked out again.\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\nRight at this point there has to be a shift in the way I've been\nrecording events as they happened, because what happened next took\nplace elsewhere, while I was flat on my back in the hospital. By \"what\nhappened next\" I mean ... to me and Joan personally and to Commander\nLittlefield and the Martian Colonization Board and everything I'd come\nto Mars to take cognizance of, and do my best to change for the better.\n\nI know, I know. Ten million separate events are taking place all the\ntime on Earth and on Mars and by no stretch of the imagination could\nthey be thought of as an immediate part of this record. But when\nthe threads all start to draw together and tighten about you in a\ndestiny-altering way you have to keep the time-sequence in order and\nrecord developments as they take place. Otherwise when they become of\nimmediate concern later on the entire picture will seem out of focus.\nThe frame will start lengthening out and the people in the picture will\nbe out-of-kelter also, and scattered all over the landscape. The only\nway you can keep them sharply in focus is to record what happens to\nthem _when_ it happens.\n\nIt shouldn't be too difficult, because there's a seeing eye that hovers\nover the Mars' Colony day and night. The big Time-Space eye that\nrecords everything that takes place in the universe, so that nothing\nis ever really lost beyond re-capture. The past, the present and the\nfuture keep flickering, in a backward-forward way, across that immense\nretina, and some day a technique may be developed for running history\noff in reverse and you'll see events that took place thousands of years\nago as if they were happening today on a lighted screen.\n\nSo ... let's look through that Big Eye straight down at the Mars\nColony, you and I together. And remember. In this particular instance\nwe won't need a history-reversing gimmick at all, because what we'll\nsee and hear is NOW. It starts as a two-person conversation:\n\n\"John, I'm frightened. What if the insulation isn't absolutely\nfoolproof? What if one of those Endicott Fuel containers isn't\nshielded in just the right way? Suppose the radio-active stuff inside\nbuilds up to what the nuclear physicists call critical mass and there's\nan atomic explosion? Blowups have happened ... even in the Endicott\nLaboratories under the strictest kind of supervision.\"\n\n\"Now look. There's not the slightest danger. Do you think for one\nmoment Endicott would take that big a risk--even though Wendel has the\nentire combine backed into a corner?\"\n\n\"They'd take any kind of risk now, because they have no choice. John,\nif you were going to give me another baby you'd have given me fair\nwarning. I could have steeled myself to endure the harshness and\nunfairness of it. But when you bring death home with you--\"\n\nThe woman had been very pretty once. You could see that just by\nglancing at her. But now her face had a drawn, haggard look and her\npallor was more than pronounced. It verged on grayness. Her hair was\nthinning and turning white and only her eyes remained lustrous, truly\nalive, as if all that remained of the woman she had once been had\nbeen drawn to a focus in the gaze she was training on her husband in\ndesperate appeal.\n\n\"Why did you do it, John? You're not just endangering your life and\nmine. If we didn't have four children ... maybe I wouldn't be talking\nthis way.\"\n\n\"I told you I was forced into it, didn't I? Wendel is calling\nEndicott's bluff. We can no longer go on buying Endicott fuel cylinders\nopenly on margin, hundreds of them and letting all of them stay in\nWendel's custody, because we don't really own them at all. The price\ngoes up or the price goes down and we sell out and buy again--and we're\nsupposed to own four-fifths of the Endicott Combine. But there's not\na single Colonist who owns the equivalent of four or five cylinders\noutright. I don't own these six cylinders. But I had to bring them home\nwith me.\"\n\n\"I just don't understand why. It's too complicated for me. A nuclear\nexplosion would be much easier for me to understand.\"\n\n\"All right ... I'll go over it again. But try to listen more carefully\nthis time. Before this big, cut-throat war started only one man\nsuspected that one of the two competing combines might try to sell\nits fluid property to the Colonists on margin. They were supposed to\ncooperate, not compete, because it was thought that Wendel couldn't\npossibly keep its nuclear generators operating without fuel. It can't,\nof course, but only one man suspected that Endicott might refuse to be\ndwarfed by Wendel in a sharp-practice duel and fight to stay big and\npowerful by letting the Colonists buy and sell fuel on speculation.\nThat would put the Colonists right in the middle, don't you see?\"\n\n\"Yes ... I do,\" the woman who had once been almost beautiful said.\n\"Thank you for giving me credit for having that much intelligence. You\nseem to forget that I have a fairly good memory too. We've gone over\nthis a hundred times.\"\n\n\"Sure we have. But it doesn't seem to have made too deep an impression\non you. You can sum it all up by saying that _on paper_, from day to\nday, it's the Colonists who now own the Endicott Combine, or most\nof it. So it's the Colonists who are carrying the battle directly\nto Wendel, fighting for the right to go on wildcatting, to get rich\novernight or end up pauperized. It's wildcatting in a sense, just as\nit was when oil instead of atomic fuel was the big prize to be fought\nover Earthside. When a Colonist buys Endicott fuel cylinders on margin,\nit's practically the same as if he were digging an oil well in his own\nbackyard.\"\n\n\"Go on, John,\" the woman said wearily.\n\n\"There's that much uncertainty in it, don't you see? And he's really\ndoing it entirely single-handed and on his own, because he's digging in\nwhat is practically a paper graveyard in some respects, unless he's one\nof the lucky ones. Endicott keeps the fuel. It doesn't go out of their\nhands. But Wendel still has to buy it directly from the Colonists, who\nare supposed to own it, and the price fluctuations keep Wendel from\nbecoming all-powerful and Endicott from going under or being dwarfed.\n\n\"In the main, it's the Colonists who have most to gain by keeping\nEndicott powerful and solvent ... although the battle lines aren't so\ntightly drawn that it doesn't become profitable, at times, to go over\nto the Wendel side. There's a lot of sniping between the lines.\"\n\n\"I know all that, John.\"\n\n\"Well, here's what it all boils down to, what you didn't seem to grasp.\nYou asked me why I brought these six cylinders home. It's because\nof the one man who did suspect, right from the first, and when the\ncharters were drawn up, that a war of this kind might be waged. I can't\neven tell you his name. He was probably a minor legal expert or auditor\nemployed by the Board, who had shrewd prophetic gifts ... enough\nforesight, at least ... to insert in fine print in both of the charters\na provision that Wendel is now using to call Endicott's bluff.\n\n\"That provision doesn't say that Endicott can't sell some of their\nfluid assets on margin. But it sets a limit to that kind of speculative\nbuying and selling. The same limit would apply to Wendel, but Wendel\nhas no fluid assets to sell on margin, and it can't very well break\nup its generators and big transmission lines and sell them to the\nColonists piecemeal, even on margin. It wouldn't look right, because\nyou can't pretend that a fragment of a pipe that is still being\noperated by a combine is a speculative commodity that has passed into\nother hands and is subject to day-to-day fluctuations.\n\n\"If you want to think of fluid assets as simply a share in a Combine's\nprofits, that's another matter. But I'm not talking about that kind of\nfluid asset. Endicott has been selling to the Colonists in a literal\nsense--_moveable fluid assets_. And in fine print in the Endicott\ncharter it says that Endicott can only sell about a third of its fuel\ncylinders on margin. The others have to be purchased outright and\ncarried home and held by the purchaser until the price is right and he\ncan dispose of them at a profit. Or sell at a loss, as property.\"\n\n\"But you say you didn't buy those cylinders outright. How could you\nhave done that?\" the woman protested. \"Just one cylinder would cost--a\nthird of a million dollars.\"\n\n\"Naturally I didn't buy them outright. I bought them on margin. But\nWendel can't prove that. Endicott is covering up for me and because\nI've brought them home and can slap my hand on the cool metal and tell\nWendel to go to hell if they try to dispute my ownership--Endicott\nstill has a chance to come out on top. Wendel is calling Endicott's\nbluff, sure. But Endicott is countering with another bluff and they can\nmake it stick. Their auditing department knows just how to do that.\nSo every Colonist who wants to go on wildcatting now has to bring a\nfew cylinders home, to make it look as if he'd bought them outright.\nPossession puts you nine-tenths on the winning side in any legal\nargument. You ought to know that!\"\n\n\"Ought I? Just suppose I did. Would that stop me from becoming\nterrified, when I know exactly what could happen if the metal isn't\nas cool as you hope it will be when you slap your hand on it, and the\nWendel police stay cold-blooded about it, and wait around for the\nfissionable material inside to reach critical mass.\"\n\n\"You know damn well it would take an awful lot of accidental jarring\nand jolting to trigger a fuel cylinder and make it blow up. It probably\ncouldn't happen, _except_ in a laboratory where they're careless about\nsuch things because of overconfidence.\"\n\n\"Dinner's on the table,\" the woman said. \"We may as well go back into\nthe house while we've still got a home, and gather the children around\nus, and tell them a few more lies about what the future is going to\nbe like in the Colony, now that one father in three will be bringing\nnuclear fuel cylinders home with him.\"\n\nThe man--his name was John Lynton--nodded and they returned into the\npre-fab. Lynton preceded his wife into the dwelling and the woman\npaused for an instant in the doorway to stare back at the long metal\nshed where the six cylinders were reposing ... letting her gaze take\nin as well the double row of foot-high cactus plants which encircled\nthe yard and the sun-reddened stretch of open desert beyond. Then she\nlet the door swing shut behind her, and turned to face her four hungry\nchildren.\n\nOne thought alone sustained Grace Lynton at that moment. There had\nnever been any need, so far, for the children to go to bed hungry.\nTheir hunger was due solely to the demands of healthy young appetites\nwhen dinner was a little delayed and they had been playing strenuously\nin the yard all afternoon or going on exploring expeditions.\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\nThey were all downstairs now, waiting to be fed, hardy perennials like\nall children everywhere. Thomas with his shining morning face--it\nseemed to stay that way right up until bedtime--and Susan, seven, and\nstill doll-wedded, and the twins, Hedy and Louise. Three girls and one\nboy, and Grace Lynton felt a little sorry for her son at times, until\nshe remembered that a boy of thirteen isn't troubled by too many girls\nin a family when he's seven or eight years their senior. The girls were\nsimply very young children to him and he was--well, right next door at\nleast to being grown up.\n\n\"All right,\" John Lynton said, seating himself at the head of the\ntable. \"Let's fall to and see who gets through first.\"\n\n\"Did you have a tough day, Dad?\" Thomas asked, reaching for a knife and\nfork, and drawing a still steaming serving bowl toward him. His unruly\nhair was so blond it seemed almost white and there was a double row of\nfreckles across the bridge of his nose.\n\nThe other three children were brunettes, with hair ranging in color\nfrom chestnut brown to jet black. Even the twins did not closely\nresemble each other, as non-identical twins so often fail to do.\n\n\"Don't annoy your father with questions now, Thomas ... please,\" Grace\nLynton said.\n\n\"Why not?\" Lynton asked, frowning at his wife. \"I did have a tough day\nand there's no sense in soft-pedaling it. Sometimes I almost wish we\nhadn't come to Mars. No matter how rigorous a Board screening is ...\nthere are some things it can't tell you about yourself. Will you make a\ngood father on a world without trees or grass, with no way of getting\nout into the green countryside and sitting down on the moss-covered\nbank of a trout stream, with your kid at your side and having a heart\nto heart talk with him in the cool shade of a big oak or cedar.\"\n\n\"The stew's good, Mom,\" Thomas said. \"Is it all right if I fill up my\nplate again?\"\n\n\"Did I ever say you couldn't, Thomas?\" Grace Lynton snapped, unable\nto keep irritation out of her voice, despite her son's compliment.\n\"There'll never be any food shortages in this house, if we have to sell\nall of the furniture.\"\n\n\"Leave enough for me, Thomas,\" Hedy Lynton said.\n\n\"Don't worry, I will,\" Thomas said. \"But if you keep on eating the way\nyou do you'll grow up fat, and no man in the Colony will marry a fat\nwoman when there are so many thin ones.\"\n\n\"That's very well put, Thomas,\" Lynton said. \"I have a brilliant\nson--practically a genius. But don't let it go to your head, boy.\nUnless you're in the electronic field or have some other technical\nspecialty a straightforward, rugged he-man can do more for the Colony.\"\n\n\"What kind of talk is that, John?\" Grace Lynton demanded. \"There's\nnothing unmanly about a genius, in any field.\"\n\n\"No, I suppose not. But I wouldn't want him to be a poet or a painter.\nThey just stand back and observe life and I'd like to see my son wade\nin fighting.\"\n\nThe daylight outside had started fading before Lynton and his wife had\nreturned indoors. But now the quickly-arriving Mars' night was almost\nat hand, and the twilight had deepened outside and was giving way to\ncomplete darkness at the edge of the desert.\n\nThe two adults and four children seated about the table hadn't once\nglanced toward the window, for the food and contentious conversation\nhad absorbed all of their attention.\n\nIt was Thomas who saw the light first, flickering on and off close to\nthe shed. He had always wanted, deep down, in a secret way that he\nhad never dared to discuss with anyone, to be an artist and paint at\nleast a hundred pictures that would show the people who looked at them\nexactly what life on Mars was like. And his father's gaze, trained\nupon him in such a steady way, had made him squirm inwardly, as if his\nsecret might at any moment be exposed. To avoid his father's gaze he'd\nlooked straight out the window and seen the strange light flickering on\nand off.\n\n\"Dad!\" he said.\n\n\"What is it, son?\"\n\n\"There's a light moving around out in the yard, close to the shed.\"\n\nIf Thomas had suddenly toppled over dead his father could not have\nleapt up from the table with more horror in his eyes.\n\n\"Why ... why ... Good God! Wendel wouldn't go _that_ far! It would be\nan act of madness!\"\n\n\"John, you don't think--\"\n\nThomas' mother was on her feet too now, her face drained of all color,\nher eyes darting to the window and back to the tight-lipped, violently\ntrembling man at the head of the table. John Lynton's face had gone as\nwhite as her own.\n\nFor a minute Thomas thought that his father was going to rush right out\ninto the yard and grab hold of the intruder, as fast as he'd leapt up\nfrom the table. Then he saw he'd guessed wrong about that.\n\nLynton crossed the room in five long strides, swung open the weapon\nlocker and grabbed hold of a holstered hand-gun instead. He strapped\nthe holster to his waist before whipping out the weapon and snapping\noff the safety mechanism.\n\nHe was starting for the door when Grace Lynton called out warningly:\n\"John, don't! _John!_\"\n\nHe swung about, staring at her in consternation. \"Don't what? If\nthey've tampered with those cylinders I'll make sure they won't live to\nblow up another man's home--or half the Colony!\"\n\n\"You can't blast them down!\" Her voice rose shrilly. \"No, John! A\nhand-gun blast that close to a fuel cylinder would set off a chain\nreaction--\"\n\n\"No, it won't. The blast is channeled. Don't be a fool, Grace. I know\nwhat I'm doing.\"\n\n\"You're the fool! You'll get us all killed!\"\n\n\"If they've tampered with just one of those cylinders we won't have to\nworry about what a hand-gun blast will do. But they won't save their\nown skins before the _big_ blast hits us. That's one thing I can make\nsure of.\"\n\nHe turned and was gone. She started to follow him out into the yard,\nbut became aware of how dangerous that would be just in time. If she\nfollowed her husband the children would almost certainly follow her,\nfor she couldn't order them to stay indoors and hope to be obeyed.\n\nShe rushed to the window and stared out, her face pressed to the pane.\n\nShe could feel Thomas pressing close to her--or was it Hedy or Susan?\nThere was a heaviness in his body which made her almost sure it was\nThomas. But that meant nothing, because she loved all of her children\nequally.\n\nSuddenly she was sure it was Thomas, because he was speaking to her.\n\"Take it easy, Mom! Dad'll take care of whoever it is. He's got a\nhand-gun to protect him.\"\n\n\"Oh, I know he has!\" she wanted to scream. \"It will be a beautiful way\nof protecting us all ... by sending us straight into eternity. God,\ndear God, don't let him blast. Don't--\"\n\nThe blast came then, lighting up the darkness outside, making the\nwindowpanes rattle. For an instant Grace Lynton could see her husband\nclearly, standing by the shed with a white flare spreading outward from\nhis shoulders.\n\nThen the flare dwindled and vanished and Grace Lynton had no way of\nknowing what had happened outside in the dark. She was sure of only\none thing. She couldn't stay inside the house with her husband moving\nabout a few feet from fuel cylinders that might blow up at any moment,\nfor there was at least a fifty percent likelihood that the intruder had\naccomplished what he'd come to do, before Thomas had seen the light\nbobbing about in the yard.\n\nShe had straightened and was hugging her son to her, just starting to\nturn, when John Lynton's voice rang out sharply from the doorway.\n\n\"Grace! I blasted at him but he got away! Listen carefully. I've only a\nmoment to talk.\"\n\nHe was standing in the doorway with the hand-gun reholstered at his\nwaist, its handle gleaming dully. His pallor was startling, for it went\nfar beyond mere paleness, as if all the blood had been drawn from his\nface artificially, leaving the skin gray and shrunken.\n\n\"I can't be sure, but I think ... one of the cylinders has been\ntriggered to blow up,\" he went on quickly. \"It isn't heating up.\nThere'd be no heat--just a faint vibration. When I put my hand on the\nmetal I was almost sure I could feel a vibration. We've got just one\nchance of staying alive--and I'll have to move fast. I'm going to take\nit to the Spaceport--I can get there in the conveyor truck in ten\nminutes--and have them dismantle it. They'll know how. I don't. I'll\ntake all six of the cylinders, to make sure.\"\n\n\"John, no! It will blow up in the truck. I'm sure of it. We'd better\nall get out in the desert, as far away from it as we can. If we start\nright now and run--\"\n\n\"We could go in the truck, Dad!\" Thomas cried.\n\nLynton shook his head. \"If just one cylinder blows up--it will take\nthree miles of desert with it. If all six go ... twenty miles of\ndesert. There are at least six thousand Colonists within three or four\nmiles of us. There are less than a thousand people at the Spaceport.\nOnly one big sky ship is still unloading. Better a thousand deaths than\nsix or seven thousand ... if it blows up before they can dismantle it.\"\n\n\"But John--Oh, God, I don't know.\"\n\n\"It's the best way, the surest way. We can't think only of ourselves.\nIf I drove straight out into the desert with it and it blows up within\ntwenty minutes the fallout would still kill several thousand Colonists.\nThe Spaceport's in the other direction, completely isolated. And I\ncan get there in fifteen minutes ... even if I'm stopped by the Wendel\npolice and have to blast my way to it.\"\n\n\"Why should they try to stop you? They'd die themselves--\"\n\n\"Why did they send someone to trigger that bomb? They'll take any risk\nnow, because they know that Endicott's new bluff could smash them. That\ncylinder is smaller than the first atomic bomb ever built--much smaller\nthan the one that was dropped on Hiroshima--and if they have to explode\na half-dozen of them in different parts of the Colony to demoralize the\nColonists and discredit Endicott they're prepared to do it, apparently.\nEven if it kills thirty thousand people. Or maybe they figured the one\nI'm taking to the Spaceport--and I _am_ taking it there, Grace--would\nmake the Colonists think twice about taking any more Endicott fuel\ncylinders home with them.\"\n\n\"You're right, John,\" Grace Lynton said, with a firmness in her voice\nwhich surprised her. \"We can't think only of ourselves. Until you come\nback--every moment will be a living death. But--you must do it. There's\nno other way.\"\n\n\"I'll be back,\" Lynton said. \"I--I love you, Grace.\"\n\n\"And I love you, John--even though I've said cruel, cutting things at\ntimes. I love you very much.\"\n\n\"Take care of yourself, Dad,\" Thomas said.\n\n\"I will, son. Don't worry. Just be the man of the family and keep the\nkids in line until I get back.\"\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\nI had no way of knowing how long I remained on the outer fringes of\nwhat was probably just a weakness-produced blackout before the outlines\nof the hospital room wavered back, becoming so clear again that I could\nsee the foot of the bed, and a glass-topped table covered with small\nbottles and a roll of gauze bandage that looked about as big as a\nliquid fuel cylinder.\n\nSomeone who couldn't have been the doctor was sitting in a chair by\nthe bed, leaning a little forward, his eyes level with mine. I was\nmore than startled. An ice-cold measuring worm came out at the base of\nmy spine and started inching its way upward, bunching itself up and\nlengthening out again, the way measuring worms do when they're trying\nto decide if you're just the right fit for a human-style coffin.\n\nI had a visitor whose face would have chilled a perfectly well man\nprepared to defend himself against violence at the drop of a hat. He\nwas looking at me with a glacial animosity in his stare, as if he\nresented the fact that I was still alive and would do something about\nit if I gave him the slightest encouragement.\n\nEven without encouragement I had the feeling that my life hung by a\nthread which could snap at any moment, so long as he remained that\nclose to me with no one standing by to interfere if he lost control of\nhimself.\n\nHe didn't have a moronic or particularly brutal looking face.\nIntelligence of a high order had given his features a cast you\ncouldn't mistake. It was the kind of look that went with disciplined\nthinking--long years of it--and behavior that was based on intellectual\ndiscernment, however much that discernment had been abused during\nmoments of uncontrollable rage. Uncontrollable rage, as every\npsychologist knows, can tie the reasoning part of any man's mind into\nknots. Everything that was primitive in him seemed to be at the helm\nnow, as if he bore me so much ill-will that he might be capable of\ntrying to take my life with just his bare hands, if he happened to be\nunarmed. And I was far from sure of that.\n\nHis glacial gray eyes seemed to say: \"I've got you exactly where I\nwant you, chum. It won't do you any good to shout for help. It stands\nto reason that if I could get in here to talk to you at a time like\nthis, throwing my weight around a little further would be no problem\nat all. Five minutes of privacy will suit me fine. After all, how long\nwill killing you take?\"\n\nHe was a fairly big man, compactly built, with hands that looked strong\nenough to bend a steel bar, if he didn't mind chancing a rush of blood\nto the head that might have been a little risky in a man his age.\n\nI had no idea why he was sitting there, only that the alarm bells were\nringing again. Only this time it wasn't taking place in a crowded\nsubway train in total darkness, or up near the top of a swaying spiral\nwhere an assassin's aim could be a little less than sure. It was man to\nman, tete-a-tete, in a well-lighted hospital room.\n\nI was flat on my back and weak as hell and Death was looking straight\nat me out of ice-blue eyes. I had only one straw to clutch at. The\nhospital room might just possibly be under surveillance and an act of\nviolence that's likely to boomerang can give an assassin pause.\n\nHis first words ripped that straw from me and crumpled it up, with such\nvigor I was sure I could hear a crunching sound.\n\n\"I've just a few questions to ask you,\" he said, in a surprisingly mild\ntone. \"We've made sure that there are no recording devices in this\nroom. We always make a careful check as a matter of routine, when we're\nforced to demand complete privacy during an interrogation of this sort.\nIt's something we'd prefer not to do, but there are times--\"\n\nHe shrugged, as if he'd made the point clear enough and resented the\nnecessity of making it any plainer.\n\n\"When the internal security of the Colony is endangered,\" he went on\nimpatiently, \"we do not hesitate to invoke all of our authority. We\nhave no choice. Too many people take it for granted that a privately\nowned combine is exceeding its authority when it undertakes police\ninvestigations not specifically authorized by its charter. They\nforget that such police powers are implicit in every charter which\nprovides for the exercise of reasonable vigilance in the public domain.\nSafe-guarding the public, which Wendel Atomics serves, would not be\npossible if we did not exercise such authority.\"\n\nHow true that was I didn't have enough legal knowledge at my\nfinger-tips to decide. But I was pretty sure it was a bald-faced lie.\nBut just his use of the word \"power\" explained how he'd managed to get\nas close to me as he'd done, with no one within earshot to hear me if I\nburst my lungs shouting.\n\nThe kind of power the Board had given me the right to exercise\nsuperceded whatever display of authority Wendel Atomics had used to\nturn the hospital room into a prison cell. But who would know or make\na move to save me--if the silver bird didn't get a chance to flap its\nwings on my uniform until they were pumping embalming fluid into my\nveins and making plans to lower me, with a ceremonial flourish, into a\ndesert grave?\n\n\"There are a few things Wendel Atomics has a right to know,\" Glacial\nStare was saying. \"A legal right--make no mistake about that. I'd\nadvise you not to lie to me. If you do--\"\n\nHe shrugged again.\n\nI said something then that surprised me, because I didn't think right\nat the moment I had that much defiance on tap.\n\n\"Shove it!\" I said.\n\nHe couldn't have heard me, because he went on with no change of\nexpression. \"Commander Littlefield is within his rights in refusing\nto permit us to question him as to what took place on board the Mars'\nrocket. We have no jurisdiction over such ... irregularities in space.\nIf we questioned just one of his officers, the Board would have every\nright to revoke our charter. But two of the officers have come to\nus and voluntarily submitted information which we cannot ignore. We\nbelieve that the internal security of the Colony is in danger and we\nintend to take steps to make sure that none of the questions we have a\nright to ask will remain unanswered.\"\n\nHe was laying it on the line, all right, speaking with an almost\nsurgical kind of precision, so that I couldn't claim later--if I turned\nstubborn--that I'd failed to understand him. It's funny how a man who's\nholding all the cards will sometimes do that, just on the off-chance\nthat you may have an ace up your sleeve and may use it to make trouble\nfor him later on.\n\nHe must have been pretty sure I didn't have a concealed ace, however,\nfor he backed up what he was saying with the most dangerous kind of\nthreat. Dangerous to him ... if there _had_ been a hidden listening\ndevice in the room and a tape with that threat on it had come to the\nattention of the Board.\n\n\"I hope, for your sake,\" he said, \"that you'll keep nothing back. It\nis very unpleasant to sit in a Big-Image interrogation room and have\npart of your mind destroyed. The part you value most, that makes you\nwhat you are--destroyed, sliced away. Yes ... _sliced away_ is quite\naccurate, even though no instrument would be needed and not a hand\nwould be laid on you. You can cut deep into the brain with vibrations\nalone. But nothing ... _physical_ ever takes place in the Big-Image\ninterrogation room. No knife or vibrator, as you know. The destruction\nis brought about in a quite different way. But it's just as drastic and\nirreversible as a prefrontal lobotomy.\"\n\nHe stopped talking abruptly, looking past me at the opposite wall,\nas if he could already see the shadow of a broken and tormented man\nprojected there. I could see it too, and I didn't like to think that I\nwas coming that close to sharing his thoughts. But it was useless to\npretend that the man who was casting that shadow might not turn out to\nbe me.\n\nSo they had them on Mars, too, with the Wendel police on hand to\nmake sure that the big screen with its multiple sound tracks and the\nsmoothly operating projector were kept carefully hidden from the law.\nBig-Image interrogation rooms--a cruel vestige of the brain-washing\ntechniques that had so outraged world opinion in the middle decades of\nthe twentieth century that they had been castigated and outlawed by\nthe United Nations, the World Court and every responsible Governmental\nagency on Earth.\n\nBut the criminal mind has very little respect for world opinion or\nrestrictions on brutal practices that are very difficult to enforce.\nBig-Image interrogation had begun as a police investigation procedure,\nwhich made it easy for the wrong kind of police force to resort to it\nand claim historic precedent and moral justification as a cover-up if\ntheir activities ever came to light.\n\nI was sure that Glacial Stare had mentioned it solely to turn the screw\nas far as it would go, hoping I'd turn pale and answer his questions\nin a completely cooperative way. I was sure that if I did he'd stop\nthreatening me immediately, listen with attentive ear to what I had to\nsay and apologize for letting me think, even for a moment, that it was\njust a part of my mind he'd been planning to destroy. Why should he\nwant to upset me that way, when the only thing he'd had in mind from\nthe start was to persuade me to talk and then relieve me of all anxiety\nby killing me?\n\nHe wasn't giving me credit for having the kind of brain it would have\nbeen worth taking the trouble to destroy, even in part, but there was\nnothing to be gained by reminding him of that.\n\nYou don't have to be a professional historian or even a data-collecting\nresearch specialist in the police procedure field to pinpoint the\norigin of Big-Image interrogation in the middle years of the twentieth\ncentury.\n\nThree out of five well-informed people can tell you exactly how it\nbegan, if you jog them into remembering by showing them a micro-film\nrecording of what took place during just one of those interrogations\nsixty or seventy years ago.\n\nMy memory didn't need to be jogged. I'd examined too many micro-film\nrecordings made even earlier than that--so many years before I was born\nthat the grooves have to be altered if you want to run them off in the\nprojectors that were in common use at the turn of the century, because\nthey ante-date even those old-style machines.\n\nAs early as 1965 someone had discovered and pointed out that the cinema\nwas no longer just an entertainment medium. Everyone at the time, I\nsuppose, had made that discovery already, in a private sort of way,\nbut an entire society can have a blind spot and go right on clinging\nto established patterns of thought, if only because people in general\nare a little reluctant to discuss openly anything that threatens to\noverturn the apple cart.\n\nAt any rate, about 1965 someone whose name has not come down to\nus--quite possibly he was a drama critic, that most curious of\nbreeds--had pointed out that the cinema had become a potentially\nmind-shattering instrument of torture, which could be used to\nbrain-wash a spectator until he became a hopeless psychotic, incapable\nof distinguishing reality from illusion. Schizophrenic or manic\ndepressive, take your pick.\n\nIt was the bigger-than-life illusion that could do that--the strange,\noften terrifying sense of being caught up in some super-reality that\nhad no real existence in time or space, in the ordinary way that\ntime-and-space manifests itself to us in everyday life.\n\nThe cinema became potentially that kind of torture medium the instant\nthe first of the twenty-million-dollar spectacles in full color\nappeared on the screen.\n\nWe know what that kind of illusion can do today and when we watch a\nscreen spectacle that distorts reality for three or four hours by\nmaking everything seem fifty or a hundred times as large as life ... we\nmake sure that we are entering a theater that is Government supervised\nand not a Big-Image interrogation room presided over by a sadist in\npolice uniform.\n\nEveryone knows how it is today, and stays on guard, perpetually\nalert. But back in the twentieth century the danger wasn't clearly\nunderstood, and that lack of understanding was taken advantage of by\nthe brain-washers in uniform to exact confessions at a terrible price.\n\nEveryone is familiar with the disorientation I'm talking about. Even\nthe old stage plays and the earlier black-and-white movies and not\na few books could bring it about to some extent, when you left the\ntheater or closed the book, and passed from a world of dramatically\nheightened illusion into the drabness of everyday life.\n\nBut the big screen spectacles in full color, with electronic sound\neffects, make the world of illusion and the world of sober reality seem\nas far apart as two contradictory constructs in symbolic logic. When\nyou look at that kind of motion picture you get the illusion that all\nof the events on the screen, even the intimate, two-person closeups,\nare taking place on a gigantic scale.\n\nThe sharpness and brightness of everything, the brilliance of the\ncolorama, the dramatic selectivity which makes each scene burn its\nway into your brain as a titan encounter in a world of giants is so\noverwhelming that when you emerge from the theater after watching such\na film the world of reality seems small, stunted, anaemic by contrast.\n\nYou look at the men and women walking past you on the street and they\nseem to have nothing in common with the men and women you've just\nseen on the screen. That quiet little guy puffing on a cigarette and\nreturning your stunned stare with a perplexed frown may be the director\nof a big power combine, with just as much lightning at his finger-tips.\nBut he seems like a pygmy. It would be impossible to visualize him as\na helmeted giant stripped to the waist, breasting wild seas at the\nhelm of a Viking ship or a spacesuited giant in a colorama with a\npresent-day background.\n\nIn the big screen spectacles all of the men seem gigantic, with\ntremendous, muscular torsos. Even the little guys look like titan\nfigures, fifty or a hundred times as large as they seem outside the\ntheater. And the women--with the possible exception of the very\nfeminine ones with overwhelming sex appeal--look like Amazons.\n\nYou can't even equate the violence you encounter in everyday life with\nthe violence that takes place in a big screen spectacle. After you've\nwatched the spectacle kind of violence for three or four hours an\narmy equipped with the most formidable of modern weapons, closing in\non a half-bombed out city would look infinitely less formidable--toy\nsoldiers in a kindergarten world which the big-image, colorama giants\ncould topple and scatter just by inflating their cheeks and blowing on\nthem.\n\nEven the Big Mushroom, which we've miraculously managed to keep from\nblowing Earth apart for almost a century now, looks fifty times as\ndestructive when you see it on the screen, spiraling skyward as the\ncrowning spectacle of a sound-color, fifty-million-dollar Armageddon.\n\nBut remember this. It doesn't cost anything like that much to put\nfour or five giants from that kind of motion picture on a screen in a\nBig-Image interrogation room. The cost, in fact, is negligible, because\njust one scene can be repeated over and over. You're seated all alone\nin the middle of what looks like a medieval torture chamber--if you\nleave out the racks and thumbscrews and iron maidens and just think of\nsuch a chamber as a blank-walled, cell-like horror--and on the screen,\nfifty or a hundred times lifesize, are the lads who have been given the\ntask of cutting you down to size.\n\n_You're_ still very much a part of the puny world outside the theater\nyou've lived in most of your life. You know it, you feel it ... you\ncan't escape from it. When a big screen production has been designed\nsolely to entertain you, you can identify yourself with the giants\nto some extent. You become a part of the illusion. But how can you\nidentify with four or five brutish looking lads with no resemblance to\nyourself, with a look on their faces which says they hate your guts and\nare out for blood and won't be satisfied until they've brain-washed you.\n\nOh, it looks easy. Resistance, laughing in their faces, should be no\nproblem at all, because you know damn well it's nothing but an illusion.\n\nBut just how long do you think you can go on believing that those\nNeanderthaler types with five-pronged metal whip-lashes dangling from\ntheir wrists aren't flesh-and-blood tormentors?\n\nAll right, you still think it should be easy. All I can say is ... just\nsit for five hours in a Big-Image interrogation room and try staying\nsane. Go ahead, insist on being granted that privilege. It might be a\nlittle difficult to come as close to it as I was right at that moment,\nflat on my back in a hospital bed with Glacial Stare reminding me just\nhow terrible it could be. But you never know until you try. On Mars\nbringing that about shouldn't be too difficult ... with Wendel Atomics\ndetermined to build up a reputation for ruthlessness to protect its\ninterests in the war it was waging with Endicott Fuel and all of the\ncolonists who were being forced to wildcat in a commodity field so\nexplosive that it could turn them into killers of the dream and blow\nthem apart for good measure.\n\nBut let's go back to the Big-Image interrogation room for a moment.\nYou're sitting there, staring up at the Neanderthaler-type giants\nand they're staring down at you. Their eyes are slitted and they're\nstripped to the waist and there is a fine sheen of sweat on their\nchests. There is nothing trim or athletic looking about them. They're\nheavyset, almost muscle-bound, with the outsize, very ugly-looking kind\nof physical massiveness you see in some wrestlers, but hardly ever in a\nprofessional boxer even in the heavyweight class.\n\n\"Well, pal!\" one of them says, winking at you.\n\n\"I have an idea he'd like to high-hat us,\" another chimes in, winking\nalso, but at Muscle Bound Number One instead of at you.\n\n\"We'll have to do something about that,\" Muscle Bound Number Three\ninsists.\n\n\"Oh, we will ... we will. But we ought to give him a little time to get\nbetter acquainted with us. Maybe we can soften him up a little just by\ntalking to him. What do you say?\"\n\n\"Sure, why not? You see a guy flat on his face, with his skull bashed\nin, and you start feeling sorry for him. Right off, that's bad. It\nkeeps you from really setting to work on him.\"\n\nAt first you can laugh, almost, because who ever heard of a screen\ngiant stepping out from the screen and slashing you across the chest\nwith a five-pronged metal whiplash? But if you know what's coming you\ndon't feel much like laughing, even at first.\n\nBecause ... it goes on and on and on. It builds up and there's no way\nyou can shut it out, because they inject a drug just under your eyelids\nwhich forces you to keep your eyes open. You can't close them no matter\nhow hard you try. And you can't turn your head aside, because you're\nstrapped to the seat and there's a clamp at the back of your head that\nprevents you from moving it.\n\nIt goes on and on, and after a while the giants are no longer on the\nscreen, but right in the interrogation room with you. One of them is\nraising and lowering his arm, bringing the whiplash down on your bare\nshoulders.... You can feel the thongs cutting into your flesh, and not\neven screaming will put a stop to it, because you can't put a stop to\nan illusion that is ripping your mind apart and letting all of the\nsanity drain out of you.\n\nIt's the hundred-times-bigger-than-life gimmick that does it, although\nthat slang-neat little word doesn't begin to do justice to what a\nBig-Image interrogation can do to you. They're big, _big_, BIG, with\nall the brutishness blown up, and showing on their faces. And they seem\nto be leaning out from the screen before they emerge from it and you\ncan hear the whiplash swishing through the air and the sound of it is\nmagnified too, and just the whiplash alone seems large enough to rip\nthe hide off a mastodon.\n\nWorst of all, that hundred-times-bigger-than-life illusion doesn't\ndepend on size alone, as I've pointed out. It depends on the over-all\nmagnification of reality that takes place in a big screen spectacle,\nthe disorientation that makes the real world seem to shrivel into\ninsignificance.\n\nIt seldom takes longer than five hours to complete the brain-washing.\nYou pass through three stages. At the end of an hour--or two,\nat most--when the torment becomes almost unbearable you start\nto hallucinate a little, but you're still sane enough to answer\nmost of the questions they ask you. Then you become so hopelessly\npsychotic that your answers can no longer be relied on. But they're\nsatisfied, they've got what they wanted from you when they started the\ninterrogation.\n\nWithout wasting any more time they go on to the third stage. They\ncalm you down and \"cure\" you with the mental-torture equivalent of a\nprefrontal lobotomy. They do that to make sure you'll lose the part of\nyour mind that can resent what's been done to you, and summon enough\nwill power to turn accuser.\n\nAnd now I was lying flat on my back, unsure of how much strength was\nleft in me, and Glacial Stare was threatening me with _that_! Not\njust an hour or two with the barrel-chested lads--on rare occasions\nthey stopped just short of the third stage--but the full, deep-cut\ntreatment.\n\n\n\n\n14\n\n\nHe'd made it plain that he was representing Wendel. But he hadn't come\nright out and identified himself, and I had no way of knowing exactly\nwhat kind of Wendel agent he was. The worst kind, beyond a doubt. But\nwhat I would have liked to know took in more territory than that.\n\nWas he ... a replacement? Had he been instructed to step into the\nshoes of the secret agent the robot had killed in space? If he had,\nthe satisfaction he'd get from killing me would probably exceed the\npleasure a run-of-the-mill Wendel police officer would experience.\n\nIt would be easier for him to identify with the slain crewman and feel\na sense of personal outrage strong enough to make him think of himself\nas an avenger. The fact that he wasn't wearing a uniform lent support\nto that grim possibility. When a man has a strong personal reason for\nwanting you dead it can make the official reason seem twice as urgent.\nIt could also bring into his face the kind of look that Glacial Stare\nwas still keeping trained on me.\n\nThere was only one thing I knew with absolute certainty. Answering his\nquestions would do me no good--would only make the danger greater the\ninstant I stopped talking. I'd be signing my own death warrant with a\nvengeance if I co-operated with him right there in the hospital room\nand spared him the trouble of having me bound and gagged and smuggled\nout of the hospital into a Big-Image interrogation room.\n\nWhy make him a present of the only card I was holding? Why be that\ncharitable when ... God, how silly could you get? If I'd had my\nstrength or there had been anyone within earshot to dispute his\nauthority if I shouted for help--a one in fifty chance of it, even--I\nmight have been holding at least a Jack or a Queen. But never an Ace,\nor four of a kind or a Royal Flush. About all I was holding was the\njoker. In some games the joker can be the highest card in the deck, but\nnot in the kind of game the three of us were playing.\n\nIt was the third player who was holding all of the really high cards.\nHe was hovering just behind Glacial Stare, with a shroud with my name\nembroidered on it draped over his arm. He could see my hand clearly,\nbecause he was looking straight at me out of eyes like holes in a skull.\n\nThat scythe-and-sickle round is almost unbeatable because of the way\nDeath has of just quietly raising the ante until all hope is gone.\nSometimes you've no choice but to let him call your bluff, lay your\ncards face up on the table, and wait for the blow to fall.\n\nSometimes ... but not always. Death is a weird-o who doesn't really\nwant anyone to live to a crusty old age and that can anger you, and\nthere are no limits to what a certain kind of resentment can do for\nyou. You'll take desperate chances when you know the sands have just\nabout run out.\n\nI came up out of the bed so fast the electricity my body generated made\nthe sheets crackle. It wasn't the helplessly weak body I'd thought\nit. Not at all. When I whipped back my arm I could feel a thrust of\npower and resilience in my shoulder muscles that amazed me, because it\nshouldn't have been there. There was no flabbiness or lack of muscle\ntone.\n\nI crashed into him before my feet hit the floor, sinking my fist into\nhis mid-section and sending the chair he was sitting in skidding half\nacross the hospital room.\n\nHe clung to both arms of the chair, too jolted to straighten up and try\nto heave himself out of it before I shortened the distance between us\nby hurling myself directly at him again. I just missed fumbling that\ncrucial follow-up, because my legs were deficient in muscle tone and\nthey almost collapsed under me before I got to him.\n\nI dragged him out of the chair and had him down on the floor and was\nbanging his head against the floor before he could get any kind of grip\non me. I wasn't in the least bit gentle about it. If I'd been banging\nhim around for five or ten minutes without stopping I couldn't have\nheightened the look of shock and absolute horror in his eyes.\n\nThe best he could do was twist about under me and try desperately to\nraise himself a little, thrusting his head forward to keep me from\nbringing it so violently into contact with the floor. He seemed to\nbe trying so hard to get out from under that I decided to help him.\nI lifted him clean off the floor and slammed him back against the\nwall--not once, but several times.\n\nI don't know where my strength came from, but even my legs were doing\nall right now. They were still the weakest part of me, but they went\nright on supporting me until I'd finished clouting him with something\nthat was just as good as a sledgehammer--the firm wall itself,\ncompletely stationary as it was. If I'd been standing behind it using\nit as a forward-thrusting shield his skull couldn't have cracked\nagainst it any harder.\n\nI suppose it wasn't really the hospital room wall I was clouting him\nwith, because, as I say, it was stationary. But when you're extracting\nthe fangs of a dangerous little reptile who has just threatened you\nwith Big-Image interrogation and know that your strength may give out\nat any moment cause and effect get swallowed up in an urgency that\ncan distort reality. His face was a confused blur for a moment. But a\nsecond or two before all of the expression drained out of it and he\nslumped jerkily to the floor my vision steadied and I saw that his look\nof absolute horror had been replaced by the deadliest kind of hatred.\n\nIt's always a little jolting, no matter how you slice it, to know that\na man who should be incapable of feeling anything but shock and pain\ncan pass out cold with that kind of look in his eyes.\n\nI'd gone berserk for a moment, but when I have to, when there's some\ncompelling reason for it, I can cool off fast. _Calm down_ would be\na more accurate way of phrasing it, for I knew it would take a long\ntime for the way I felt about Glacial Stare to turn from anger to\nenlightened scientific detachment. He couldn't really help being what\nhe was, because what is known as the bastard-pattern gets grooved\ninto the poor unhappy devils who are afflicted with it way back in\nchildhood. They injure themselves more than they injure others, even\nthough what they do to others in the process often doesn't bear\nthinking about.\n\nRight at the moment Glacial Stare had injured himself, but not\ndeliberately. I had done most of the injuring for him. But there would\nbe times when he'd punish himself twice as remorselessly, and he'd go\non doing it to the end of his days. If there's a hell on Earth the\nsadistic bastards occupy it, and it's unscientific to feel anything but\npity for them.\n\nIt was equally unscientific for me to feel anything but concern for\nmy own safety right at the moment, because I was still trapped in a\nhospital room with all of the physical weakness I'd felt a few minutes\nbefore creeping back and with no guarantee that if I walked out of the\nroom in a tottering condition I wouldn't run smack into another Wendel\nagent.\n\nQuite possibly they had the hospital surrounded and when they saw what\nI'd done to Glacial Stare they wouldn't talk with me as long as he had\ndone before I'd belted him unconscious.\n\nThey'd either blast me down, cold-bloodedly and on the spot, with one\nof the compact little hand-guns Doctor Mile-Away had discussed with\nJoan on the ambulance--how many days, weeks away that ride seemed--or\ngag and bind me and carry me out on a stretcher.\n\nGlacial Stare himself no longer worried me. He'd be out for as long as\nit would take me to decide whether it would be better to go staggering\nout of the hospital room and trust the first person I collided with not\nto betray me, or flop back on the bed and shout for help from there.\n\nYou do crazy things, sometimes, when you're that uncertain. There\nwasn't a chance of his coming to immediately, but just automatically I\ncrouched beside him and rolled one of his eyelids back with my thumb.\nThe glazed pupil that stared sightlessly back at me gave me a jolt,\nbecause it could have meant that I'd killed him. I thrust my hand under\nhis shirt and felt around for a heartbeat and found no trace of one.\nHis skin was clammy and very cold.\n\nThen I saw that he was still breathing. His chest rose and fell and\nthere was a sudden, dull thumping where my palm was resting.\n\nAll right, that took care of him. He would live to turn vicious again.\nBut it didn't take care of me. I was still in the worst kind of danger,\nand sounding off might be the unwisest thing I could do. But what\nchance would I have otherwise? Someone would have to know or I'd likely\nas not take all of the wrong risks.\n\nI had to fight off the weakness that was coming back and be ready for\nanything--even a set-to with another Wendel agent or a half-dozen of\nthem. But I had to have an ally, someone who knew the hospital as well\nas I knew the lines of my palm. I had to be briefed in advance, or I'd\nhave no way of knowing how good my chances were.\n\nHow long could I stay on my feet, despite the weakness, if I decided\non a desperate gamble and attempted to get out of the hospital alive?\nDid any of the doctors have enough authority to oppose Wendel, if I\ntold them who I was and they believed me. Or did Wendel have so much\npower here they'd have to actually see the silver bird to take risks\non my behalf which would bring the entire staff an exceptional courage\ncitation from the Board--if I lived to set the record straight.\n\nAnd where was the silver bird and my secret-code identification papers?\nNot on my person. All of my clothes had been removed and I was wearing\njust a one-piece, in-patient garment with no pockets in it. It stood to\nreason they'd gone through my clothes before attaching a tag to them\nand filing them away, on the off-chance I might live to reclaim them.\nIn an emergency case they'd have displayed that much curiosity, at\nleast. It would have been no more than a routine procedure.\n\nUnless--Commander Littlefield had warned them not to tamper with my\nclothes and to return them to him immediately. No, no--that was crazy.\nThe chances were he'd removed the silver bird and the identification\npapers from my inner breast pocket before they'd bundled me into the\nambulance and they were now safely in his possession. Or perhaps Joan\nhad them. It was all pure guesswork, but I was fairly certain of one\nthing. They hadn't found the silver bird or Glacial Stare would never\nhave been permitted--\n\nHell ... why not face it. I couldn't even be completely sure of that.\nIf Wendel was all-powerful here the doctors' hands would be tied, no\nmatter how much they knew about me. I'd have to be in robust health and\non my feet, with the silver bird gleaming on my shoulder, to overcome\nthat kind of power.\n\nActually, I didn't think Commander Littlefield had told them anything.\nIt was the kind of secret he'd guard with his life, unless he'd had\nreason to suspect that Wendel would send an agent to kill me before\nI had a chance to tell him whether or not I thought the danger was\ngreat enough to justify abandoning all secrecy ... immediately and as\na simple safety precaution. He'd respect my wishes in the matter, and\ncould certainly be excused for not having had the foresight to take\nmaximum precautions on his own initiative. It could very easily be\nargued that he should have done so ... that he had blundered badly. But\nI refused to condemn him for keeping the secrecy obligation so firmly\nin mind that he'd failed to realize precisely how fast and ruthlessly\nWendel could move. And even if I'd been ringed about with security\nprecautions Wendel might have succeeded in convincing the hospital\nstaff that the silver bird was a lead counterfeit and Littlefield an\nanti-Colony conspirator.\n\nA lot of suspicion hovered over the heads of the big sky ship\ncommanders, anyway--a sinister, shadowy aura woven of lies and slander\nthat accompanied them everywhere and greatly curtailed their authority\nwhen they attempted to intervene in the affairs of the Colony.\n\nAll that passed through my mind as I stood staring down at Glacial\nStare and helped me come to a decision. If I lived to get out of\nthe hospital I'd be on my own with a vengeance. But Littlefield was\nstill my best bet I'd be completely alone in totally unfamiliar\nsurroundings, facing a challenge such as no man had ever faced before\nand survived to tell about it.\n\nI'd have to make my way through the Colony on foot, a stranger in\na world I'd had no time to adjust to and get back to the sky ship\nsomehow--even if it meant talking my way into the good graces of\ncriminals and hiding in dark alleys and learning new ways of thinking\nand acting the hard way--but fast--and resorting to every dodge in the\nbook to keep one jump ahead of the Wendel agents.\n\nThere'd be a hue and cry--and they'd be out for my blood. I had no\nidentification papers--nothing. I'd be as naked and vulnerable as the\nday I was born in more ways than one--except that I'd be a grown man in\nbody and mind with a grown man's resourcefulness.\n\nI could only hope I'd prove equal to the task and acquit myself well\nand succeed in silencing the skeptical part of myself that was shaking\nits head in furious disbelief.\n\nI'd decided to make no attempt to get anyone into the room by sounding\noff. Much as I needed an ally, the risk would be too great. No one had\ncome rushing in, and the fact that I'd been able to prevent Glacial\nStare from uttering a sound by taking him by complete surprise and\nbattering his skull against the wall until he folded was a point in my\nfavor. Not to regard it as a break and take full advantage of it would\nhave been foolish.\n\nSlipping quickly from the room and taking my chances made more sense\nthan waiting around for an ally to come to my assistance, because he\nmight not be an ally at all, but another Wendel agent.\n\nI was deliberately shutting my mind to the greatest danger--the Big One.\n\nYou're deliberately shutting your mind to the Big One, Ralphie boy.\nGetting back to the sky ship will be tough sledding, every foot of\nthe way, and you'll have to dodge and weave about and you may end up\ndead in the darkest of Martian alleys, half blown apart by an atomic\nhand-gun. But the Big One is getting out of the hospital itself, and\nyou're afraid to let yourself think about that because you know how\nheavily the odds will be stacked against you.\n\nYou don't know what the hospital is like--how big it is, even. You\ndon't know how many corridors there are, or how many alarm bells will\nstart ringing the instant anyone sees you. There may be a dozen nurses\nto a floor and doctors constantly on the move from the operating rooms\nto the recovery wards, and a Wendel agent or two on guard at the end\nof each corridor.\n\nAll the exits may be blocked, with Wendel agents aimed with atomic\nhand-guns just waiting for you to show up running. You don't even know\nhow far the hospital is from the center of the Colony, only that--just\nbefore you blacked out for the last time in the ambulance--you seemed\nto be quite a distance from the heart of the Colony.\n\nEven if there are no guards at any of the exits and no one tries to\nstop you how will you be able to find your way back to the spaceport\nwithout a compass if the hospital is ten or fifteen miles from the\nColony, and all about you is a waste of desert sand and there are no\noutgoing ambulances standing by to give you a lift.\n\nHigh up in one of the rooms there'll be a Wendel agent you've belted\ninto insensibility and he'll be stirring and calling out for help and\nwhen they come swarming into the hospital room to lift him up--the\nnurses and the doctors who can't help but blanch a little when he\nreminds them just how powerful the Wendel Combine is--he'll have only\none thing to say to them.\n\n\"Get me the Central Police Agency on the tele-communicator.\"\n\nYou'll be out in the red desert, fighting your way toward the Colony\nthrough a sandstorm perhaps, but ten or twelve minutes after that call\ngoes through you'll hear a droning overhead and that will be the end of\nyou.\n\nThe hell of it was--no man ever needed an ally more desperately. I\nneeded a confederate, right at that moment in the room with me, if only\nbecause I couldn't hope to cheat death for ten minutes running if I\never reached the streets of the Colony without some Colony-type clothes\nto replace the one-piece, in-patient garment I was wearing. A doctor's\nwhite smock wouldn't do, and neither would a nurse's uniform. I didn't\nhave the right build to pass for a nurse even inside the walls of the\nhospital, not to mention the craggy cast of my features and the heavy\ngrowth of stubble which covered my cheeks.\n\n\n\n\n15\n\n\nFar back in the twentieth century, when World War II was just coming\nto a close, the anti-Nazi underground movement had helped quite a few\nsoldiers escape from prison camps disguised as women. It certainly\nwasn't a stratagem to be rejected out of hand, when your life was at\nstake. But somehow my masculine pride was affronted by the thought and\nI did not take kindly to it.\n\nThere had to be a lot of male patient's clothes hanging somewhere in\nthe hospital, but how was I to get my hands on a complete outfit if\nI had to leave the hospital like a thief in the night, just one leap\nahead of Death in a Wendel police uniform?\n\nStealth? Would that solve it? If I moved very cautiously at first,\nputting the thought of what could happen out of my mind, and trying to\nfind a room where clothes were hanging?\n\nNo--I couldn't afford to move too cautiously. I'd have to move fast and\nboldly, trusting to blind ruck to protect me. But the clothes problem\nstill remained, and unless I could solve it--\n\nShe solved it for me. I didn't know that at first and neither did\nshe--I mean, she had no idea when she came back into the room that any\nsuch problem would confront her. All she saw was Glacial Stare lying\nslumped against the wall, his jaw sagging and the patient she'd left\nflat on his back a short while before standing in the middle of the\nroom with his in-patient garment twisted grotesquely about his bony,\nknobby knees and looking one hell of a mess. It's always been hard\nfor me to understand how a woman can find the angular, bony body of\na man attractive, especially when it's in a state of half-undress.\nBut there's no explaining the mystery of sex, and I'll give her this\nmuch--she didn't give me a second glance for a moment. She had eyes\nonly for Glacial Stare. She stood staring down at him with all the\nblood draining from her face, as if she'd never seen a dead man before\nor a man as close to death as Glacial Stare seemed to be.\n\nI saw the scream coming just in time. I stepped in front of her and\nclamped my hand over her mouth, drawing her close to me, and keeping a\ntight grip on her shoulder to prevent her from breaking away from me\nand making a dash for the door.\n\nI couldn't blame her for being scared or feeling, as she obviously did,\nthat I was responsible for the terrible state Glacial Stare was in. And\nwhatever Joan had told her about me ... and despite everything _she'd_\ntold the doctor ... she'd been a nurse long enough to know that even a\nwoman who has been married to a man for many years can never be sure\nhe won't develop some odd, wild quirk of character which will turn him\ninto a murderer overnight.\n\nAnd that's even more true of a hospital patient who has been close to\ndeath and running a fever and may still be in an irresponsible state,\nhis reason undermined by the suffering he's undergone.\n\nAnd she was completely right about one thing. I was entirely\nresponsible for the terrible state Glacial Stare was in. Only ... there\nhad been a reason for the violence I had unleashed against him, and I\nwanted her to hear the full story as quickly as possible, so that she\nwould calm down and become a responsible person again herself.\n\nHysteria is a woman's worst enemy ... and a man's too, for that matter.\nBut since it's ten times as common in women as in men it's a very\nspecial problem which every man should know how to deal with. I was no\nexpert at it, but she helped me by listening to what I had to say in\nmy own defense as if her life depended on it. And when I was through\nshe seemed to agree with me that if someone had put an ether cone over\nGlacial Stare's face in his sleep and relieved him of life's burdens in\na painless, merciful way they would have been doing humanity a service.\n\n\"It's not right to feel that way,\" she said. \"It makes you wonder about\nyourself when you even think you'd like to see someone who's that\nruthless removed from a world that has too many merciless people in it.\nBut I guess everyone who isn't that way ... thinks about it at times.\"\n\n\"I did more than think about it,\" I said. \"But in the main I battered\nhim unconscious just to give myself a one in ten chance of staying\nalive. The odds against me have shrunk a little, but not much. Unless I\ncan get out of here fast--\"\n\n\"You can!\" she breathed. \"I'll help you. No one will try to stop us,\nif we make it look as if I was just walking with you to the end of\nthe corridor and back. We get patients right out of bed after minor\nsurgery, to keep them from losing their strength. It's the best way.\"\n\n\"Minor surgery! You mean--\"\n\nNurse Cherubin nodded. \"They didn't have to probe to get the dart out.\nIt didn't go deep into your back. It was the poison that made you so\nill. The dart struck a bone and that jammed the poison mechanism. The\ndart splintered just a little, but not enough poison got into your\nbloodstream to kill you. But you ran a fever and once or twice I was\nreally frightened, because your pulse started fluttering and you almost\nstopped breathing.\"\n\n\"Good God!\" I looked at her, wondering. \"If I was that close to death\nhow could my strength have come back so fast? I don't feel too good\nright now. But I had enough strength when I crashed into him to drag\nhim from the chair, lift him up and slam him back against the wall.\"\n\nShe nodded. \"Even a dying man can do that sometimes, if he's threatened\nin a violent enough way and desperately wants to stay alive. But\nyou weren't that weak, and you're not going to die. You've got more\nstrength right now than you realize. And you'll get stronger--not\nweaker. After minor surgery the post-operative shock is usually minor\ntoo, and the fever didn't last long enough to seriously weaken you. The\nlast blood test was good. No poison--not even a millionth of a c.c. You\nperspired freely, and that helped to save your life.\"\n\n\"All right,\" I said. \"That's good news. Just the fact that you're the\nonly one who knows what would happen if I don't get out of here fast\nwould be better news--the best there is. Except that--\"\n\nI shook my head and looked past her toward the door. \"What good would a\nwalk up the corridor do me if there's a Wendel agent stationed at the\nend of it? A doctor might be taken in, but a Wendel agent would wonder\nwhy a nurse was helping me to keep my strength up when I could answer\nquestions better flat on my back. He'd come right back into this room\nwith us, to find out what happened.\"\n\n\"There are no Wendel agents anywhere in the hospital,\" she said. \"The\nhospital would have put up a fight if a Wendel police officer had\ninsisted on questioning you as _he_ did--in private. It would have\nbeen a losing battle, and we couldn't have held out for very long. By\ntomorrow an armed guard would have demanded that you be released in\nWendel custody and you can't run a hospital in the Colony if you defy\nthe Wendel police to that extent.\"\n\nI stared at her, amazed. \"Then how did he get in here to see me?\"\n\nIt was then that she exploded the bombshell.\n\n\"If the Wendel Combine, with all of its socio-political power, came\nhere in the person of just one man and threatened to make full use of\nthat power if he was not allowed to talk to you in strict privacy ...\nand that man was Henry Wendel himself--\"\n\nShe shrugged, glancing steadily for a moment at the slumped form of\nGlacial Stare, with just an uncanny silence hovering over him. No trace\nnow of the power-aura that must have made hundreds of his yes-men turn\npale and snap to attention at various times in the past, if the look\nhe'd trained on me was ingrained and habitual with him. And I rather\nthought it was.\n\nMr. Big himself! And I'd banged him around without knowing, without\neven suspecting that I was slamming the Wendel Power Combine back\nagainst a hospital-room wall. All the immense height and depth and\nweight of it, the big atomic transmission lines, the towering black\nturbines, the boa constrictor coils that snaked in all directions\nthrough the center of the Colony. The war, too--the wolf-eat-wolf war\nthat was being waged with Endicott Fuel, and the demoralization that\nwas sounding taps over graves that hadn't been dug yet but would bear\nthe Wendel trademark.\n\nThe lawful authority that the silver bird had conferred on me would\nhave given me the right to act as his executioner then and there. But\nyou can't solve problems that way and hope to gain by it ... because\nthere are always other Mr. Bigs waiting to step into the shoes of the\nMr. Big you've taken care of in behalf of the common weal, with more\ncocksureness than you've any right to exercise.\n\nWhen you cut off the head of that kind of boa constrictor and leave the\nbig coils intact the new head may be twice or three times as dangerous.\n\nThat he had come to the hospital alone, completely unguarded, would\nhave been hard to believe if I hadn't remembered that an attempt had\nbeen made to blast the sky ship apart in space solely because Wendel\nwanted me out of the way. I was sure of that now. And if he wanted me\ndead that bad, safe-guarding his person would probably have seemed of\nminor importance to him. It could be waived--an inconsequential detail.\nI had to be questioned and then killed, and he was the best man for the\njob. He could trust no one else to handle it as well.\n\nThe joker was--he had botched it.\n\nThere were a lot more questions I wanted to ask Nurse Cherubin but\nthere just wasn't time for them. We'd wasted four or five minutes\nalready, just discussing the state of my health, and at any moment\nsomeone might come through the door who would refuse to let me leave\nwhen he saw what I'd done to Wendel.\n\nIt wouldn't have to be a Wendel agent. No doctor who wasn't keen\nabout committing suicide would have let me go until Wendel came to,\nand our two stories could be compared. I didn't have the silver bird\nto back up my story, and when Wendel came to he'd simply step to a\ntele-communicator and the hospital would be swarming with Wendel agents\nbefore I could hope to win any converts. The fact that he'd come to\nvisit me unguarded didn't mean he'd placed himself in any real\njeopardy ... in his book at least. He couldn't have known I'd knock him\nout cold, and even if the hospital was located fifteen miles from the\nColony it wouldn't take the Wendel police long to get to him. Ten or\ntwelve minutes, at most.\n\nPerhaps they were already on the way. It stood to reason. He'd hurried\nhimself and arrived ahead of them, but he'd want them to be there as\nsoon as he killed me, to dump my body on a stretcher and carry it out\nunder guard.\n\nWhen he killed me--God, how easy it was to overlook the most vital\nthings! I hadn't even searched him. If he had a weapon on him I could\ncertainly use it, for nothing can boost your morale quite so much when\nyour life is at stake as the firm, cool feel of an atomic hand-gun\nagainst your palm.\n\nI was starting toward him when Nurse Cherubin said: \"Stay here, and\nkeep the door locked until I come back. I'll tap three times. I've got\nto get you some clothes.\"\n\nI nodded, feeling overwhelmingly grateful, tempted to take another\nminute--precious as every minute was--to tell how wonderful I thought\nher. She seemed to know without my saying a word, for her wide mouth\nsmiled a little and she was gone.\n\nI stepped to the door and locked it, and then returned across the room\nand bent over Mr. Big.\n\nI found the weapon but I had to roll him over to get at it, because it\nwas in a holster at his hip. His body was a dead weight, but when I got\nthe weapon free he stirred a little and groaned. I clouted him on the\njaw and he stopped groaning. Brutal? You bet it was, but I couldn't\nafford to take any chances on his coming to.\n\nWhat would you have done? If I'd killed him right then and there, the\nBoard would not have censured me. I was sure of that. Not to have done\nso was perhaps foolish, a weakness in me. I was cutting down my chances\nof getting as far as the Colony, before a security alert went out, and\nthe Wendel police started after me with instructions to blast me down\non sight.\n\nBut somehow I couldn't do it. Not only for the reasons I've\nmentioned ... because a new head on the Wendel boa constrictor would\nhave solved nothing ... but because it went against the grain. I'd have\nhad a feeling of guilt I never could have completely thrown off. He'd\nintended to kill me, all right ... no doubt of that. But I couldn't\nreturn the compliment in the same coin. It made no sense, perhaps, but\nthat's the way it was.\n\nThe weapon pleased me. It was an atomic hand-gun that had cost a small\nfortune to construct--intricate, extremely compact, the latest model,\nthe finest, the best. Fortunately I knew a great deal about such\nweapons, because unusual-type firearms have always fascinated me.\n\nThis one I was sure I could aim and fire with accuracy, even though\nsome of the precision gadgetry was new to me. Twenty-five thousand\ndollars at least that gun had set Henry Wendel back, but what was\ntwenty-five thousand to a man with a fortune of eight or ten billion?\n\nIt seemed tragic and a pity that all of that money should have been\nspent on a weapon that would pass out of his hands into the possession\nof a man unfriendly to him. But it didn't sadden me too much and I felt\neven less sad when I'd unbuckled the holster also, strapped it to my\nown hip and thrust the hand-gun back into it.\n\nShe knocked three times, as she'd promised and came in with some\nclothes that some poor devil in another room would never live to put\non again. She told me as much while I was taking off my one-piece\nin-patient garment.\n\n\"Cancer,\" she said. \"They're keeping him under sedation. You think\nyou're in trouble, that the game is hardly worth the candle, until you\nsee something like that. Then you realize how lucky you are--just to be\nalive.\"\n\n\"You don't have to tell me,\" I said. \"I've often thought along those\nlines.\"\n\nShe wasn't embarrassed when I stood for a moment stark naked before\nher, as most nurses aren't. I wasn't particularly embarrassed either,\nbecause right at that moment I had no more sex awareness than a totem\npole.\n\nThe clothes were a little small for me, but I had a feeling that in\nthe Colony not too much attention was paid to the way clothes fitted\nyou--or failed to fit. In a pioneering society ill-fitting clothes are\naccepted as an indication that you are a rough-and-tumble sort of guy,\nknow your way around and are, for good measure, an old-timer, with\nearly-settler prestige.\n\nThere were two more questions I had to ask her before I became a\nbabe-in-the-woods kind of grown man on Mars, with just the hand-gun and\na few highly trained areas of native intelligence to protect me--if I\nsucceeded in getting out of the hospital alive. It was still a very big\n_if_, but the questions were just as vital, and were directly tied in\nwith it.\n\nJust how far _was_ the hospital from the Colony? And what was she going\nto tell Joan to keep her from succumbing to panic when my darling\nwanted to know what had become of me?\n\nBefore we left the room she answered the second question reassuringly.\nIt had been weighing so heavily on my mind I'd been afraid to even let\nmyself bring it right out into the open and face it squarely. Mr. Big\nhadn't even mentioned Joan in the ugly little talk I'd had with him,\nand if she was still somewhere in the hospital I had a feeling he'd\nhave used her nearness as one more way of tightening the thumbscrew.\n\nI'd been right about that, apparently. \"She had a talk with Commander\nLittlefield on the tele-communicator,\" Nurse Cherubin said. \"He advised\nher to return to the Mars' rocket a few hours ago. He wanted to talk to\nher ... said it was urgent ... and promised to check on your progress\nreport every half hour. She left in one of the outgoing ambulances. She\ntold me she'd be back just as soon as you regained consciousness. It's\na very short trip in an ambulance. The hospital is only eight miles\nfrom the Colony.\"\n\nSo that answered my first question too, but only in part. If there was\njust a waste of blowing sand outside it would certainly cut down my\nchances. But there had to be a firm-packed road for the ambulances to\ntravel over, didn't there?\n\n\"No,\" she said, answering me in full a half-minute later, when the\ndoor of the hospital room had been firmly closed behind us and we were\ncommitted to the big risk and there could be no turning back. She\npaused an instant to urge me to be cautious, to stagger a little and\ngrip her arm for support and try to look in all respects like a patient\ntaking his first uncertain walk after a minor operation. I didn't have\nto worry about looking pale, but when she went on and explained what\nshe'd meant by the \"no\" relief swept over me and probably marred a\nlittle the impression it was important to give anyone who chanced to\nglance our way.\n\n\"There's no desert to cross,\" she said. \"It's all built up. You'll\nbe passing between high stone walls with massive metal grills set\ndeep in the stone most of the time, with here and there a gap and a\nfew scattered pre-fabs occupied by aereator-system workers and their\nfamilies.\"\n\nSo that was it! I knew all about the Martian aerator-system and the big\nturbines that pumped oxygen out over the Colony. So much oxygen, under\nsuch stabilized pressure, that it stayed in equilibrium and didn't fly\noff into space even under the light gravity. Even without the aerators\nthere was enough oxygen in the thin Martian atmosphere to enable a man\nto stay alive for a short period, if he didn't mind going about with\nhis shoulders bent, gasping for breath and turning blue at intervals.\nHis cheeks, anyway, with the veins on his forehead standing out like\nwhipcords.\n\nThe first colonists, as everyone knows, went about with oxygen tanks\nstrapped to their backs and took a whiff or two of the stuff in\nEarth-atmosphere concentration through a flexible metal tube whenever\ntheir lungs started burning. And inside the early pre-fabs, of course,\nthere were miniature aerator systems which made living indoors as\ncomfortable as it was Earthside.\n\nBut the big aerator-system had completely eliminated the need--a health\nhazard-diminishing need at best and never actually mandatory--of the\nhuge glass dome which imaginative science writers in the first three\ndecades of the Space Age had predicted as a _must_ for successful\nMartian colonization. There are seldom any _musts_ when science\nadvances in seven league boots and you're right on the scene in person,\nbreathing in a planet's atmosphere for yourself and finding out that\nthere just happens to be a little more oxygen in it than precision\ninstruments on Earth had led you to anticipate.\n\nIt wasn't a precision instrument of any kind I was needing right at\nthat moment--even to reassure me about my heart beat. I knew exactly\nhow fast it was beating--much too fast. We passed a doctor in a smock\nso spotless it didn't seem as if he could have been wearing it for\nlonger than a few minutes. But the look of quick suspicion he trained\non us was ageless, the kind of look that comes into the eyes of a\ntrained professional man when he can't be quite sure that a subordinate\nis doing the wise thing.\n\nWhat right had the nurse to take me for a walk along the corridor\nwhen I looked that close to caving in? I feared for an instant I was\noverdoing the act, but when the suspicion faded and he went past us\nalong the corridor I breathed more freely again. We passed a nurse who\ndidn't even glance at us and another--blonde and pert-nosed--who smiled\nand nodded, just as if we were old friends. I wondered what she saw in\nme.\n\nThen we were standing before an elevator at the end of the corridor and\nthe red down light came on ... because Nurse Cherubin had pressed the\ndown button ... and she was urging me to be cautious for the second\ntime.\n\n\"We're going down three flights to the admitting ward,\" she said. She\nsmiled, as if she'd suddenly remembered there's nothing like a touch of\nlevity to relieve strain, even if it has to be forced. \"But don't let\nthat dishearten you. Patients are discharged from the admitting ward\ntoo. It's not quite as long as this corridor but it will be busier.\nPatients, nurses--at least three doctors. We'll just walk right through\nas if we had every right to be there. Just outside the emergency exit,\na few steps further on, there's a driveway which curves around behind\nthe hospital. Ambulances with accident victims use it, but there's not\nlikely to be an ambulance standing there. You go down a narrow flight\nof stairs to get to it. Is that clear?\"\n\nI nodded. \"What do I do then?\"\n\n\"You just follow the driveway until it forks and the left turn will\ntake you into the clear-away between the aerators which leads directly\nto the Colony. You won't have to pass in front of the hospital at all.\nAmbulances may pass you before you get to the Colony, but you won't be\nstopped and questioned. They'll think you're one of the aeration-system\nworkers.\"\n\nI had an impulse to give her a hug and tell her I loved her, quite sure\nthat she'd know what I meant, even if I did it inside the elevator\nwhere it would have more an aspect of intimacy. You love people who go\nall out to help you and they don't even have to be young and beautiful.\nBut when they are there's an added warmth somehow--\n\nWe carried it off better than I'd dared to hope. We descended in the\nelevator, emerged arm in arm and walked right through the admitting\nward without even glancing at the fifteen or twenty people we had to\npass to get to the emergency exit she'd mentioned, a third of them\nin white. No one stopped or questioned us, and we followed the same\nnurse-helping-patient routine which had proved its worth on the third\nfloor of the hospital.\n\nAnd then--I did hug and kiss her, just once briefly before I went out\nthrough the exit and down the stairs to the driveway. I hoped Joan\nwouldn't mind if she ever got to hear about it.\n\n\"Goodbye,\" I said. \"And thank you.\"\n\n\n\n\n16\n\n\nThere was no waiting ambulance in the driveway. I descended the\nstairway, twelve metal steps railed in on both sides, feeling grateful\nfor what she'd said right after I kissed her. \"Don't worry about your\nwife. If Wendel tries to make us send for her we'll find a way to roast\nhim over a slow fire until you're together again. There are three\ndoctors who will put up a stiff fight and I'm going to set to work on\nall of them. You've no idea what a hospital can do with just the right\nkind of delaying tactics.\"\n\nIt took me less than two minutes to half-encircle the driveway, take\nthe turn she'd recommended and strike out for the Colony between the\ntowering gray walls of the aerators.\n\nThe Big Grayness. I'd seen photographs of that tremendous engineering\nproject in my hell-bent-for-adventure years, when I'd sat at a desk\nin a schoolroom, and imagined what it would be like to take part in\nthe construction work, standing on a dizzy height with an electronic\nriveter in my hand, watching blue lights go on and off and sparks fly\nup into the cool Martian night beneath a wilderness of stars.\n\nThe reality was very much as I'd imagined it as a school kid, except\nthat I wasn't a construction worker looking down over it, a human fly\nwith a man-size job to do, but a guy that kid wouldn't have recognized,\nhis footsteps echoing on the catwalk at the base of it. I had a\ngiant-size job to do, but how could he have known it would some day\nturn into anything _that_ big?\n\nIt wasn't even a project anymore--half of it still in the blueprint\nstage. It was completed and the towering gray walls were firm and\nsolid, and the grills were sending oxygen spiraling out over the Colony\nwithout making me feel light-headed at all.\n\nRight at that moment I'd have welcomed a little oxygen intoxication\nbut the aerator-system didn't work that way. The flow was regulated\ndirectly at the source, kept under controlled pressure and diffused\noutward high up by rotary circulators. As it spread out over the Colony\nit was drawn down to breathing level by another system of circulators,\nstationed at intervals about the Colony and extending twenty-five miles\nout into the surrounding desert.\n\nIf you wanted to experience oxygen intoxication you had to strap a tank\nto your back and breathe the stuff in through a tube in the old way.\nBut no one in his right mind would do that deliberately, for an excess\nof oxygen can be five-ways dangerous on a planet where what you have to\nworry about most is over-stimulation.\n\nThere were catwalks on both sides of the aerator walls, with a central\nlane wide enough for vehicles to pass in opposite directions. I kept\nto the right hand side all the way to the Colony, and it took me about\nthirty minutes to get there. My strength amazed me. It probably wasn't\nquite up to par. But I only had to stop twice to rest and then only for\na minute or two.\n\nTwo ambulances passed me, their red tail-lights blinking, but the\ndrivers didn't even turn their heads as the vehicles went droning\nthrough the Big Grayness. Up above the sunlight was waning, and\nturning red, but only a diffuse glow filled that two hundred-foot-high\nartificial cavern.\n\nThree aerator-system workers, walking shoulder to shoulder, gave me a\nbad jolt for a moment, for they had the look of Wendel police agents.\nI encountered them just beyond a break in the cavern wall, where a\ncluster of pre-fabs with children playing in the yards made five or six\nacres of stony ground resemble a manufacturing town suburb Earthside.\n\nI should have known better than to be alarmed, because the three men\napproaching me looked eager and expectant, as if they knew that a few\nsteps more would bring relaxation after toil and the warmth and glow of\na family reunion.\n\nBut they had the husky build and sharp-angled features of Wendel police\nofficers and I stayed alert until one of them came to a dead halt and\nlooked me over genially. \"New on the job, aren't you, Buster? Don't\nremember having run into you before. They keep putting on so many new\nmen it's hard to be sure.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" I said. \"I live about two miles further on.\"\n\n\"Well, it isn't the best job in the world, Buster, as I guess you've\nfound out already. You get sucked into a grill sometimes, and breathe\nnothing but oxygen until you feel like a blue baby they're trying their\nbest to save, even if they have to fanny-whack him to get the stuff out\nof his lungs for a week or two afterwards.\"\n\n\"Don't discourage him, Pete,\" the tallest of the three chided. \"You\nhave a cold, cold heart. It doesn't happen often.\"\n\n\"You bet it doesn't ... or my wife would have been a widow long before\nthis. Well ... good luck, Buster. Be seeing you around ... I hope.\"\n\nI felt so relieved I didn't even resent the \"Buster.\" He was just a big\ngrinning ape who liked to kid the living daylights out of his fellow\nworkers, whenever he thought he could get away with it. No harm in him,\nand though there might have been times when I'd have been tempted to\ntake a poke at him ... I had no such impulse now. I just wanted to be\nable to look back and see him dwindling in the distance.\n\nI ran into only one other person before the Big Grayness terminated.\nShe was a stout, matronly-looking woman carrying a baby and she nodded\nand smiled warmly when she saw me staring at the infant, as if she\nwouldn't have at all minded if I had been its father.\n\nFor an instant there flashed into my mind the nerve-relaxing picture\nthat every normal male has of himself at times--the humble-station\nhusband, big-bosomed wife picture. You're Mr. Run-of-the-Mill, just a\nsimple guy, working hard at a lathe or feeding processed food tins into\na vacuumator. You come home at night with no worries, kick off your\nshoes and she's there to make the creature comforts seem important.\nA good meal on the table, fit for a king with a hearty appetite--do\nkings ever have that kind of appetite?--children romping all over the\nhouse--a round half-dozen upstairs and down--and the kind of night's\nsleep you don't get when you have responsibilities weighing on you. The\ntop-echelon kind that can drive you half out of your mind. It's there\nfor the taking if you really want it, if you don't wear a silver bird\non your uniform when they add up the score and ask you why in hell you\nhaven't done better?\n\nIt's not quite an accurate picture, because that kind of guy has\nworries too--plenty of them. He has to buy shoes for the children and\ngrin and be tolerant when his wife turns shrewish, as every woman with\na large family and a big grocery bill is bound to do at times. But\nstill, when you balance the good against the bad, who gets the most out\nof life--Mr. Run-of-the-Mill or Mr. Big?\n\nWell ... however much I might fume about it ... I had to be what I was.\nI could honestly say that I'd never had any driving ambition to be the\nkind of Mr. Big Wendel was. I just had a kind of inner compulsion to\nbe true to the best that was in me, to preserve my integrity and use\nwhatever wild talents I had to enrich human life and have some fun\nwhile doing it. If I couldn't always have fun, if illness or death\nor just plain bad luck prevented me from living life to the full and\nenjoying it ... I'd known that when I'd cut the cards, hadn't I? You\nhave to play whatever cards destiny hands you.\n\nJust before I reached the last quarter mile of the aerator marathon I\npassed another dwelling section, with more kids scampering about and\nthree or four women standing in the doorways of the pre-fabs. They\ndidn't look big-bosomy, but slender as willow trees and very beautiful.\n\nI certainly wasn't running, but it was a marathon in my book, the\nwalking kind where you keep your body held rigid, your arms bent\nsharply at the elbows. There was only one good thing about it. I didn't\nhave to worry about out-distancing the other walkers, because it was a\none-man marathon.\n\nI came out into the biggest square I'd ever seen. The one opposite the\nskyport I'd crossed with just as much tension and uncertainty mounting\nin me an eternity ago on Earth was just about one-fourth as large, give\nor take a few square yards of shadowy pavement.\n\nIn a way, the Big Grayness was still with me, because there were\ngigantic, interlocking shadows everywhere and although there was\nnothing but open sky overhead spirals of wind-blown sand were swirling\nacross it, half-blotting out the waning sunlight.\n\nWhen you're sure that Death hasn't played his final trump or even\nrelaxed his vigilance and you could be yanked right back to confront\nhim at any moment a square as big and empty and desolate-looking as\nthat doesn't give you any support at all.\n\nAll right, there was life and movement in it, if you want to call a\nlong line of tractors standing end to end on the far side, one of them\nsnail-active, life and movement.\n\nOne of the trucks seemed to be backing up a little and edging out from\nbetween the others, but I couldn't even be sure of that before an\near-splitting blast of sound and a blinding flash of light shattered my\nlast link with the sane universe.\n\n\n\n\n17\n\n\nI was lifted up and hurled backwards, so violently that if blind luck\nhadn't saved me I'd have fractured my skull or felt, ripping through\nmy chest, the beaten-drum agony that sets in right after you've shaken\nhands with a spinal concussion.\n\nI came down heavily, hitting the pavement with a thud. But in falling I\nwent into a kind of half-spin, and landed on my side in a loose-jointed\nsprawl that just shook me up a little.\n\nI rolled over on my back and stared up in horror. For an instant I was\nsure that the whole sky had burst into flame. Then the flare dimmed and\nvanished and I could see that the dust spirals were still there.\n\nI raised myself on one elbow and stared out across the square. The\nlong line of tractors was still there, too. Not one of the vehicles\nhad been blown sky high. And as if that wasn't enough of a miracle\nthe snail-paced one had turned about and was heading straight in my\ndirection.\n\nIt wasn't moving at a snail's pace now. It was coming directly at me\nfrom mid-way in the square, rumbling and clattering as it came, its\nheavy treads so ponderously in motion that the pavement under me was\nbeginning to vibrate.\n\nNearer it came and nearer, swaying a little, and if the driver had been\nsome crazy killer bent on crushing me to death under the treads he\ncouldn't have gone about it more expertly, for he was maneuvering the\nvehicle just enough to make sure that it would pass directly over me.\n\nHow could I doubt it? It had veered slightly and swung back into a\nstraight-line course again, and if I'd tried to drag myself out of its\npath there was room enough for it to veer again before I could hope to\nsave myself.\n\nIt takes several seconds to recover from a scare like that, even when\nthe danger evaporates right before your eyes. All at once the tractor\n_was_ veering again, but far enough to the left to make me feel certain\nthat I wouldn't be flattened to a pancake if I stayed where I was.\nBut you can feel certain about something like that and go right on\nremembering what big tractors have done at various times in the past to\nmen unfortunate enough to be caught off guard when there's a killer in\nthe driver's seat.\n\nThe vehicle came to a jolting, grinding halt a few yards to the left of\nme, and the driver swung himself out of the glass-shielded front seat,\ndescended lightly to the ground, and was grabbing me by the arm and\nhelping me to rise before I could get a really good look at him.\n\nHe'd descended from the tractor lightly because he was that kind of\na man--just about the most fragile-looking guy I'd ever seen. He was\nlean to the point of emaciation, with gaunt cheeks and sparse white\nhair that was fluffed out like thistledown by the wind that was blowing\nacross the square.\n\nHe had deepset brown eyes, very sharp and piercing and they were\nglowing now with a kind of feverish brightness, as if his agitation\nmatched my own or had reached a peak that was just a trifle higher.\nThere was nothing surprising about that, if he knew exactly what had\nhappened and it was as bad as I feared it might be.\n\nDespite his frailness, he had the features of a strong-willed man, the\nchin and mouth firm, the nose pinched a little at the nostrils, as if\nstubbornness in adversity had become an ingrained habit with him. I had\nthe feeling I'd seen that face before, but I couldn't remember where or\nunder what circumstances.\n\nI was certainly seeing it now under the most nerve-shattering of all\ncircumstances and would not be likely to forget it a second time.\n\n\"How are you, all right?\" he asked, his eyes searching my face as if\nhe was far from sure I knew myself and the way I looked would tell\nhim more than just a guess on my part. \"That explosion was miles from\nhere,\" he went on breathlessly, \"but it lifted the tractor right off\nthe ground, treads and all, for a second. I had the craziest kind\nof floating sensation until it settled down and kept right on in\nthis direction. I increased the speed, because I sort of felt that a\nfast-moving machine would have a better chance of not overturning.\"\n\nI stared at him half-dazedly, feeling like a pawn on a chessboard that\nhad tilted just far enough to make me wonder if it might not still be\nprecariously poised and go crashing at any moment. And since I couldn't\nsee the players I didn't know what the rules of that particular game\nwere or how far they had been abrogated.\n\n\"How do you feel?\" he asked.\n\nHis solicitude amazed me, because if what he'd just said was true--and\nI had no reason to doubt it--he should have been more shaken up than\nI was and he seemed to have something on his mind that was making him\nstare straight past me toward the Big Grayness.\n\nI was staring in the opposite direction. \"I'm all right,\" I assured\nhim. \"Just feel ... a little dizzy.\" I gestured toward the tractors on\nthe far side of the square. \"What's over there? Did the explosion come\nfrom there?\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"No. I told you it was miles from here, in the\ndirection of the spaceport. That's the Endicott Administration\nBuilding, fuel conveyor sections and two-thirds of the distributing\nunits. The tractors are all owned by Endicott. I backed this one out\nfrom between them and had just about gotten it turned around when the\nblast hit me.\"\n\n\"I know,\" I said. \"I saw you. I wondered why only one tractor--\"\n\nThat was as far as I got, because what hit me then was more jolting\nthan any blast could have been, and it wasn't even physical. Just one\nword he'd let drop with a delayed-action fuse attached to it made me\nsnap my head back and look at him in desperation. He had no way of\nknowing what was in my mind, but you don't think of that when you want\nsomeone to do you a favor that's of life-and-death importance to you.\n\nI wanted him to withdraw that one word, to pretend at least that he\nhadn't said it. It didn't have to be true, he could have been just\nguessing.\n\nThe word was \"spaceport.\" It couldn't matter that much to him, surely.\nIt wasn't his wife but mine who was at the spaceport, and if he was\nwrong about where the explosion had taken place it would cost him\nnothing to be merciful and admit that he was far from sure about it.\n\nBut before I could hope to get such an admission out of him he sounded\na knell to the granting of favors by saying: \"Wendel technicians are\nactivating Endicott fuel cylinders in different sections of the Colony.\nThey're trying to turn the Colonists against Endicott by committing\nmass murder. The cylinders will only destroy an area of a few square\nmiles, because they're not in the multiple-megaton, nuclear warhead\ncategory. We never thought they'd be turned into bombs.\"\n\nThen came the knell. \"We were warned about this, by a Colonist who's on\nhis way to the spaceport with one of the cylinders. Or he may be there\nalready. He just spoke to us briefly on the tele-communicator. That\nexplosion came from the direction of the spaceport, but it may not be\nthe one we were warned about. They may be trying to dismantle another\ncylinder at the spaceport right now. They won't succeed, because only\nan Endicott technician would know how to go about it.\"\n\n\"Do you know?\"\n\nHe nodded. \"Yes ... I can dismantle it. I can get to the spaceport in\nabout fifteen minutes, if I drive between the aerators and turn right\njust before I get to the hospital. The clear-away from that point on\nwill take me through a section of the Colony and then straight out\nacross the desert to the spaceport. The Colonist who talked with us\nmade a serious mistake, but it wasn't his fault. He had no way of\nknowing that it takes a fuel cylinder at least forty-five minutes\nto build up to critical mass after it's been activated. In some\ncases--fifty or fifty-five minutes.\"\n\nHe paused an instant, then went on quickly. \"He should have brought it\nhere. We could have dismantled it in time. But he was afraid it would\nkill several thousand people if it went off anywhere near his home,\nor in this section of the Colony. He also over-estimated the area\nthat would be demolished by the blast. When he talked to us he was\ntwo-thirds of the way to the spaceport and if we'd told him to turn\nback then and bring the cylinder here the risks would have been too\ngreat. We had to let him go on. I said they can't dismantle it at the\nspaceport. But there's a slim chance they can ... because there may\nbe an Endicott man there or someone who knows enough about Endicott\ncylinders to make a hit-or-miss try. With luck, he may just possibly\nsucceed. But I doubt it.\"\n\n\"You doubt it? Good God--\"\n\n\"I doubt it very much. That's why it's so important for me to get there\nas fast as I can. It's my responsibility--and I refuse to share it with\nanyone. There are times when a man must face death alone.\"\n\n\"Who are you?\" I asked.\n\n\"A man with much to answer for, the opposite of a good man. I'm Kenneth\nH. Hillard, President of the Endicott Combine.\"\n\nIt stunned me for a moment, because it was as big a bombshell as Nurse\nCherubin had exploded back at the hospital when she'd nodded toward a\nslumped caricature of a man and told me exactly who I'd been banging\naround.\n\nBut it didn't stun me for long, because even the showdown miracle of\ntwo Mr. Big's taking matters into their own hands when all of the chips\nwere down--Hillard was also a giant despite his frailness and a better\nman than Wendel could ever hope to be--even the wonder and strangeness\nof it was of less concern to me at that moment than the danger that\nJoan was in.\n\nI told him then. \"I'm going with you,\" I said. \"I've every right. If\nI'm cutting in on your yen to face death alone ... that's just too bad.\nI'm going with you, or you don't go at all. I pack quite a wallop, and\nyou may as well know it. Wendel does.\"\n\n\"Your wife. I see....\"\n\n\"I hope to Christ you do--\"\n\n\"Get in!\" he said sharply. \"I may need you. I'm not a well man. My\nheart--\"\n\nWe climbed in and he tugged at the brakes, releasing them and the big\nvehicle lumbered into motion.\n\nIt was already pointed in the right direction, and in less than half\na minute--the second time within fifteen minutes for me--we were deep\nin the Big Grayness, with the walls of the aerators looming up on both\nsides of us.\n\nUp above all of the sunlight had dwindled to the vanishing point and\nthe gigantic artificial cavern was lighted now along its entire length\nby cold light lamps embedded in the walls at fifty-foot intervals. The\nsolid, three-dimensional world outside our minds, whatever segment of\nreality we happen to be passing through, never looks quite the same\nto any two individuals. It is always, in a sense, a special creation,\ncolored and altered by the human imagination.\n\nTo me the cold light lamps were chillingly like enormous eyes, keeping\nus under constant scrutiny. The scrutiny of giants, standing motionless\nin shadows, with just their luminous eye-sockets visible. It was as\nif any moment, promoted by some wild whim, the giant forms might take\na violent dislike to us, might raise mace-like metal fists and smash\nthe tractor, very much as a robot giant had smashed a Wendel agent in\nspace, with a fiendishly mechanical rancor.\n\nBut to the frail man at my side the aerator walls may have been\nchilling in a quite different way, if he was giving the Big Grayness\nany thought at all.\n\nApparently he wasn't, because when his voice rose above the rumble of\nthe treads he didn't once mention the aerators or the pale blue light\nthat was glimmering on the hood of the tractor.\n\n\"It's the beginning of the end--either one way or the other,\" he\nshouted. \"Either Wendel will be destroyed by the Colonists themselves\nfor committing mass murder, or we'll go down under a juggernaut that\ncan't be stopped. Sometimes you can't smash absolute evil, when it's\nbacked up by absolute power.\"\n\nI raised my voice as high as he'd done, because I wanted to be sure\nhe'd hear me. \"It will always be stopped in the end, I think--if\nyou have enough moral courage. That's a dynamic in itself, the most\nformidable of all weapons. All history confirms it.\"\n\n\"I wish I could believe that!\" he shouted back. \"But I'm not so sure.\nAnd you have to fight with reasonably clean hands. Endicott is almost\nas guilty as Wendel, except that it would rather be destroyed than\nresort to mass murder.\"\n\n\"That's two-thirds of the right,\" I shouted back. \"That's where the\nbiggest dividing line comes. Every tyranny in human history that has\nresorted to mass murder has gone down into everlasting night and\ndarkness and very quickly. The few that survived to die a natural death\ndrew back at that point. The great, utterly ruthless destroyers always\nperish.\"\n\nWe both fell silent then, because there are times when the whole of\nthe future and everything that human anger and courage can do to\nsafeguard the future and keep it from destruction seems less important\nthan coming to grips with an immediate, life-and-death emergency. When\nyou do that you're going all out to safeguard the future as well, but\nyou don't think of it in that way. Just getting to the spaceport in\ntime--Oh, God, yes, in time to be at least a little ahead of time, so\nthat Hillard would have steady nerves and could dismantle the cylinder\nwith cautious precision, with no zero-count demoralization to make his\nfingers stray from the right wires--just getting there and finishing\nthe job before the spaceport could become a translucent cone of fire\nwas a million times as important to me, right at that moment, as the\nWendel-Endicott war.\n\nA million times as important, Ralphie boy. Don't be ashamed of feeling\nthat way. If the spaceport blows up, and there's no Joan any more, and\nthe universe comes to an end for you, you've no sure guarantee that the\nactors who will step into your shoes and occupy the center of the stage\nwill make any better job of it than you've been doing. So it will be a\nloss, however you slice it, because the death of two lovers is always\na loss. You fight better when you've been given that best of all head\nstarts.\n\n\n\n\n18\n\n\nWe stayed silent until the tractor had rumbled past eight or ten of the\nbreaks in the Big Grayness. They were shrouded in dusk-light now, with\nno kids playing in the front yards of the housing area pre-fabs. Then,\njust as we were turning into the clear-away that branched off from the\none I'd taken on leaving the hospital, Hillard shouted: \"We've got to\nget over to the left! There's an ambulance right up ahead!\"\n\nI heard the siren before I saw it, a banshee-like wail cutting through\nthe twilight, unnerving in its shrillness. It took a moment or two for\nits winking red headlights to come sweeping toward us and if Hillard\nhad seen them before that it had to mean he had exceptionally sharp\neyesight.\n\nIt careened past without slowing, almost grazing the hood of the\ntractor. I thought for an instant, when the banshee wail became shrill\nagain, that it was still coming from the same ambulance. Then I saw\nfour more furiously blinking headlights coming out of the dusk ahead of\nus, and another ambulance swept past, as swiftly as the first had done,\nbut missing us by a wider margin.\n\nA third followed it at a distance of less than a hundred feet, its\nsiren at such full blast that it no longer sounded like a banshee wail.\n\nYou can be gripped by a dread that's practically breath-stopping and\nstill manage to shout, if your only other choice is to die inwardly.\n\nIt may have been more of a groan than a shout. My voice sounded ragged\nand it almost broke. \"Could those ambulances be coming from the\nspaceport? Do you think--\"\n\nHe cut me off. I probably couldn't have gone on anyway.\n\n\"They could never have gotten out there and back so fast!\" he shouted.\n\"We'll be passing through a section of the Colony in about two more\nminutes. It's closer to the hospital, so it's just possible they've\npicked up a few victims at the fringe of the blast area who didn't have\nour luck.\"\n\n\"The fallout area must be pretty wide!\" I shouted back. \"Wherever the\nexplosion took place--\"\n\nHe cut me off again. \"No fallout--or very little. What there is is gone\nwithin four or five minutes. Safe to go in after that, for the residue\nwouldn't mutate a fruitfly. Colonists don't know that ... closely\nguarded Endicott trade secret. Reason we let the Colonists store them.\nA fuel cylinder can be converted into a nuclear bomb, all right, but\nit will be the cleanest midget bomb ever built. Take fifteen or twenty\nof them to blow up even a third of the Colony. But that doesn't mean\nthat one couldn't blow up the spaceport, or seriously injure hundreds\nof people throughout the fringe area. The ground tremor alone could\ndo that. I told you what it did to this tractor. Has the force of a\nsmall earthquake, except that the tremors are three times as erratic.\nThey can just shake you up a little, or break every bone in your body.\nDepends on where you happen to be standing. It follows a zigzagging\npattern, so it can pass right by you.\"\n\nAll that didn't come in one shout, but I'm recording it that way\nbecause I didn't interrupt him, and though he must have stopped once\nor twice to take a deep breath, and keep a sharp lookout for another\nambulance I wasn't aware of any break in what he was saying. He was\ntrying his best to make it crystal clear, if only to calm me down a\nlittle.\n\nSome of it was reassuring, but not what he'd said about the spaceport.\nA clean bomb with little or no fallout can leave you just as dead if\nyou're unfortunate enough to be blown up by it.\n\nYou see things sometimes you can't bring yourself to talk about, even\nto close friends when the horror has receded a little and you know it\ncan't come back in a physical way to torment you.\n\nSo I'm going to draw the veil over most of what we saw when we passed\nthrough about five square miles of the Colony, before the clear-away\nbroadened out to twice its previous width and we headed out across the\ndesert toward the spaceport.\n\nWe couldn't be sure, even then, just where the explosion had taken\nplace, because it was only the fringe area we passed through. It hadn't\nbeen laid waste by the blast and there were only five or six demolished\nbuildings. If the big square which stretched between the Endicott plant\nand the aerators had been a built-up section instead of a square the\nproperty damage might have been just as great and would not have seemed\nruinous.\n\nBut there was one other difference. The Endicott square had been\nunpopulated, with just one tractor moving out from the long line of\ntractors on the far side. The five miles of Colony we passed through\nhad been the opposite of unpopulated. Its streets and squares and\nplaygrounds and vehicle-parking areas had been thronged with people.\n\nThey were still thronged with people but some of them were lying prone,\nand others were leaning dazedly against the walls of buildings which\nhad remained for the most part undamaged and still others, who no\nlonger seemed to be in a state of shock, were bending over the slumped\nbodies of the grievously injured and the dying, doing their best to\nconsole them and ease their pain.\n\nI'm drawing the veil on the rest of it--the blood and the\nscreaming--because it was pretty awful, and what possible purpose would\nbe served if I described it? How could it benefit anyone? It would\nserve as a reminder of how cruel life can be at times, how uncertain\nand terrible. We know that, don't we? So ... to hell with it ... I say\nthat in a very reverent way, with awe and respect, and not profanely.\nBut it's best to consign it where it belongs, to hell, and not let it\nparalyze all action and make you give up when there are still sunsets,\nand the laughter of children, and the happiness of lovers, and ten\nthousand other things that are worth fighting to preserve.\n\nIt took us less than eight minutes to arrive at the spaceport, dusty\nfrom head to foot, with sand choking our lungs and gasping a little\nfrom oxygen shortage, because when there's a stiff wind blowing over\nthe desert the aerators don't function at peak efficiency.\n\nI didn't know there was anything wrong until the tractor began to\nzigzag a little, about three hundred feet from the massive, steel-mesh\ngates of the spaceport.\n\nHe had strength enough left to tug at the brakes and bring the tractor\nto a grinding halt before he slumped against me, with a strangled sob\nthat chilled me to the core of my being. It chilled me and stunned me\nand frightened me, because I'd never thought that anything like that\ncould happen.\n\nHe was frail, all right, and had the look of a man whose health had\nbeen steadily failing ... no doubt partly brought about by the battle\nhe'd been waging with Wendel. And he'd mentioned something about\nheart-trouble--\n\nThe trouble was, I hadn't taken all that too seriously, because you\nnever think that someone who has displayed extraordinary energy and\nfirmness of will is going to collapse right when you need him most.\n\nI swung about and looked at him, and his pallor gave me an even worse\njolt than the way he'd moaned and sagged heavily against me.\n\nHe gripped my arm and tried to speak, but the words wouldn't come. His\nlips moved soundlessly for a moment and then--they stopped moving. His\nbody stopped moving too. All at once, as if a clock had stopped ticking\ninside of him, and Time had stopped ticking for him forever just\nbecause his life and the clock were bound up together, intricate parts\nof the same mechanism, and if the clock stopped there was no way his\nlife could be prolonged.\n\nI knew he was dead before I reached out and touched him. I could tell\nby the dull, unseeing glaze which had over-spread his pupils and the\nterrible stillness which had come upon him. A stillness and a rigidity\nthat made it impossible for me to doubt what the alarm bells were\ntelling me as well. They had started ringing again, but this time it\nwasn't so much an alarm they were sounding as a dirge.\n\nIt was impossible for me to doubt, but I still had to make sure, as\nhe would have wanted me to do, by feeling for a heartbeat that wasn't\nthere and satisfying myself in other ways. It was an obligation I\ncouldn't evade and had no intention of evading.\n\nIt took me less than a minute and a half--a time limit I kept firmly in\nmind--to fulfill that obligation. Then I descended from the tractor and\nheaded for the steel-mesh gates of the spaceport on the run.\n\n\n\n\n19\n\n\n\"Ralph!\" she cried, running to meet me as I walked into the big,\nsteel-walled enclosure where Commander Littlefield and eight or ten or\npossibly twelve men in gray skyport-technician uniforms were working\nover a long metal cylinder that Death had started working on well ahead\nof them. He was the expert and they were just amateurs doing the best\nthey could to beat the time limit he had set for them. With a grim\nchuckle, no doubt, because, as I said once before, Death is a weird-o.\n\nJoan's arms went around my shoulders and she crushed herself against\nme, and kissed me hard on the mouth. Then she let go of me and moved\nquickly to one side, so that Commander Littlefield could talk to me\nwithout interference or a moment's delay. She seemed to know without\nwaiting for me to say a word how important that was.\n\nOne look at Littlefield's white face told me all I really wanted to\nknow. But I decided that if he could fill in the details for me in\nhalf a minute I could risk setting another time-limit in my mind and\nclocking him second by second by second as he talked.\n\n\"A nurse at the hospital got word to us you'd be doing your best to get\nback here, Ralph,\" he said. \"The Wendel police have orders to blast you\ndown on sight, but now that you're here I can protect you--or you can\nprotect yourself. I've got your papers and insignia. Right now that's\nnot so urgent as what's happening inside this Endicott fuel cylinder.\nIt's been triggered to build up to critical mass by a Wendel agent. A\nColonist brought it here and we've been trying to dismantle it. But we\ndon't know just how to go about it and we don't dare experiment. We've\ntaken a few _small_ risks, naturally. We've had to. But we're getting\nnowhere, and what looks like a small risk could turn out to be a big\none. We don't even know how much time we've got!\"\n\nHe spoke almost calmly, without raising his voice, but there was\nnothing calm about the way he looked. The time limit I'd set to clock\nhim by had run out and now it was my turn. I was going to have to ask\nhim to do something that might seem only a little less terrible to him\nthan being blown apart by a nuclear explosion.\n\nBut it would have to be done--and fast.\n\nI clocked myself as I talked, allowing myself about forty seconds.\n\"Those cylinders build up to critical mass when they've been tampered\nwith and triggered to explode in about forty-five minutes,\" I said.\n\"Don't ask me how I know, because I haven't time to explain. I _do_\nknow--you can take my word for it. I knew the cylinder was here, and I\nwas hoping you'd find a way--\"\n\nI caught myself up. \"Never mind that now. Just listen. I don't know\nhow long it took the Colonist to bring it here or how long you've been\nworking over it. But it hasn't exploded yet. _So there's still a chance\nwe can get it out into space before it blows up!_\"\n\nHe looked at me as if he thought I'd gone suddenly quite mad. I\nfinished what I had to say fast, because I knew it would take eight or\nten more minutes for him to recover from his first shock, and issue\norders, and have the cylinder carried on board his big sky ship--his\npride and glory--and for the sky ship to rise from its launching pad\nand be blown apart in space.\n\nHe'd have to get all of the crewmen off as well and set the robot\ncontrols and if there were any passengers still on board--I refused to\nlet myself think about that.\n\n\"It may be too late,\" I went on. \"We may all be as good as dead right\nnow. But we've got to try. Do you understand? You've got to get that\ncylinder on the sky ship, set the controls and send it out into space.\n_It must be done at once. Every second counts._\"\n\nHe recovered from the shock faster than I'd dared to hope. The grin\nthat hovered for the barest instant on his lips startled me until I\nrealized it was a very special kind of grin--the kind of grin only\na man who is about to part with something that means just about as\nmuch to him as his own life would be capable of ... if he had a\nnon-eradicable streak of wry humor deep in his nature as well.\n\n\"Ralph, I've always looked upon people who put property above human\nlife as just about the lowest worms that crawl. But for a minute--God\npity me--I almost felt that way. It's just that--it's fifty billion\ndollars worth of big, tremendous sky ship and that cylinder is so\nsmall--\"\n\n\"It won't seem small if it blows up and takes the spaceport with it,\" I\nsaid. \"It won't seem small at all.\"\n\n\"I know, Ralph. I said once I was old enough to be your father and I\nstill think I am. But if you put me across your knee and gave me the\ndrubbing a dumb six-year old would rate I'd have no right to complain.\nI should have thought of it myself.\"\n\n\"We don't always think of things that stand out like sore thumbs when\nwe're under tremendous stress,\" I said. \"Don't blame yourself for being\nhuman, Commander.\"\n\n\"I hope it won't take me much longer than that to finish the job,\nRalph,\" he said. \"I'll do my best. There are only three crewmen on\nboard and all of the passengers have been cleared.\"\n\nHe swung about without another word and went striding out of the\nenclosure.\n\nI would have followed him if Joan hadn't picked that moment to come\nback into my arms. It held me up for a minute or two.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe incandescent burst of flame that makes a big sky ship's ascent into\nspace seem for an instant almost cataclysmic, as if the sky itself\nhad been ripped apart in some terrible and incomprehensible way, came\nexactly eight minutes, thirty-two seconds later.\n\nI timed it myself, not mentally this time but with a watch in my hand.\nI stood with Joan at my side a hundred feet from the launching pad,\nwatching the cylinder disappear into the sky. It was the cylinder and\nnot the big rocket itself that I seemed to see as I stared upward,\nas if the sky ship had turned to glass and the deadly thing it was\ncarrying out into space was beginning to stir and vibrate in a quite\nghastly way, with its contours enlarged to sky-spanning dimensions\nunder the glass.\n\nTo my inward vision it was bigger than the ship itself and it was hard\nto understand how even a huge sky ship could be carrying anything so\nenormous and death-freighted when a short while before it had been\ndischarging passengers in the bright Martian sunlight who had given\nno thought to Death ... only what life had in store for them on a new\nworld.\n\nMy fingers were clenched around the watch and I wasn't even aware that\nCommander Littlefield had joined me until he tapped me on the arm.\n\n\"We can see and hear it when it happens--all of it, just as if we were\ntaking it out into space ourselves. Every tele-communicator on the sky\nship is turned on and tuned to big screen wave length. If there was a\ncrewman on board he could talk to us and we could talk to him.\"\n\n\"Thank God there isn't a living man on board,\" I breathed.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, nodding. \"Yes, we can be thankful for that. And for\nour lives as well. There are four big screens here, but we may as well\nwatch the one in the port clearance building. It's the largest of the\nfour--if size makes any difference when about all we'll see when the\ncylinder explodes is a blinding flare. We won't see the bulkheads\ncollapsing, or a robot cyb crumbling, that's for sure. It will happen\ntoo fast.\"\n\n\"What good will it do us to watch at all?\" Joan asked. \"I'd rather stay\nright here. We'll see the flash, won't we?\"\n\n\"You'll see it, all right,\" Littlefield said, grimly. \"It will look\nlike an exploding star for about ten seconds. My sky ship--an exploding\nstar. I never thought it would ever come to that.\"\n\nHe started to turn away, thinking, no doubt, that I'd fallen in with\nJoan's idea of passing up a view of it on the screen. But I hadn't at\nall and when he started walking toward the port clearance building I\nwas right at his side. So was Joan, because she was that kind of a\nwife. There were a lot of questions I wanted to ask him--questions of\nthe utmost urgency, such as how much progress he'd made in finding out\nwho had shot the dart at me from high up on the spiral and just what\nnews he'd received from the hospital, when Nurse Cherubin had informed\nhim I was trying to get back to the spaceport, that went beyond that\nbare statement--I was sure she'd briefed him in detail--and ... well,\na lot of questions. But this hardly seemed the right time to ask him,\nbecause his inner torment was too great.\n\nI could sympathize and understand, because I knew what a hell he was\npassing through. Nothing could prevent the destruction of his sky ship,\nbut he had to see it with his own eyes, no matter how much agony it\ncaused him.\n\nHe didn't have to do any explaining to the Port Clearance men, because\nthey'd either assumed he'd pick out their screen well in advance of our\narrival or their own curiosity had proved overmastering.\n\nThe screen was lighted and the sound tracks whirring when we walked\ninto the projection room. It was just like walking into the sky ship's\nchart room and staring across it at the four robot giants who had\nfollowed both emergency instructions in space and the routine kind and\nwere doing their best to perform a man's job now. A mechanical best,\nwhich meant, of course, that they had no way of knowing how close they\nwere to annihilation. They would be blown apart without pain and had\nnothing to lose that a man would have valued. But they were not men,\nand who can be sure that mechanical brains and the thought processes\nwhich take place in them are not faintly tinged with emotional\ncoloration?\n\nProbably not ... for it would have been something that laboratory\ntests have never succeeded in establishing. A cybernetic brain can\nbecome fatigued, yes--but it is not really a human fatigue. It is on\nthe metal-fatigue level. But knowing all that, a chill would have gone\nthrough me if the robots had been able to talk to us.\n\nThe image on the screen was three-dimensional, and in full color and\nthe illusion that we were standing right in the sky ship's chart room\nwas so startling that Joan whispered: \"I wish we'd stayed outside. It's\nterrifying. Almost as if ... we could be blown up ourselves when the\nblast comes.\"\n\n\"No danger of that,\" I said, squeezing her hand reassuringly. \"You'd\nbetter sit down.\"\n\nThere were ten hollow-tubed metal chairs in the room, but all except\none were occupied. I reached out and drew it toward her, but she shook\nher head. \"No, I'll stand, Ralph. I may want to leave in a minute.\"\n\nOne of the port clearance lads got up and offered Commander Littlefield\nhis chair, assuming I'd take the one that Joan had refused. But we were\nboth of one mind about standing. Only Littlefield sat down, as if the\nburden of torment which rested upon him had added ten years to his age.\n\nNo sound at all came from the screen for a full minute. Then a scream\nbroke the stillness. It was so totally unexpected, so horrifying, that\ntwo of the port clearance men leapt to their feet, sending their chairs\nspinning backwards. Commander Littlefield was on his feet too, but he\nhadn't leapt up. He'd arisen jerkily, his hands pressed to his temples,\nas if to shut out the sound or keep his head from bursting.\n\nWe saw her then. She had come into the chart room and was staring\ndirectly at us, and just knowing she could see us as clearly as we\ncould see her made her plight seem even more terrible. To me, at least,\nbecause it wasn't hard to imagine what was passing through her mind.\n\n_I'm alone on the ship ... just as I feared. They've sent me out alone\ninto space. If Commander Littlefield isn't on board ... if he's in that\nroom watching me with all those other men ... what else can it mean?_\n\nShe'd be ten times as sure of it if she'd been inside the port\nclearance projection room and knew what it looked like, and I was\nalmost certain she had, because there was an unmistakable look of\nrecognition in her eyes, and the Port Clearance building was where they\ntook passengers for questioning.\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\nShe looked as she always had, with her hair piled up high on her head\nand the full lips drowsily sensuous, and her breasts thrusting firmly\nupward against the tight-clinging fabric that ensheathed them just\nbelow the curve of her throat, and the soft whiteness of her upper\nbosom.\n\nOnly her eyes had changed. Stark terror looked out of them and suddenly\nas she stared at us she pressed one hand to her throat and swayed back\nagainst the bulkhead on the right side of the doorway. It brought\nher up short. But I was sure that if it hadn't she'd have gone right\non retreating backwards until she either started screaming again or\ncrumpled to the floor in a dead faint.\n\nShe neither screamed again nor fainted, for Commander Littlefield gave\nher no time to succumb to utter panic. But if his voice hadn't rung out\nas sharply as it did--at the precise moment that it did--the outcome\nmight have been quite different.\n\n\"Why did you return to the ship?\" he shouted. \"Why did you do such a\nreckless thing? Was it because we suspected you? Was it because you\nknew we were about to place you under arrest? Answer me! Your life may\ndepend on it.\"\n\n\"Yes ... I went back,\" she said. \"But only to get ... something I\ndidn't want you to find. I was pretty sure I'd hidden it where you'd\nnever think of searching, but when you started suspecting me--\"\n\n\"I see. A damaging piece of evidence? Something of the sort?\"\n\nShe nodded. \"Yes ... yes ... a paper. It would have proven my guilt.\"\n\n\"You admit your guilt then? We can still save you, but not if you go on\nlying, clinging to the story you told us. Every part of that is false.\"\n\n\"No, no!\" She almost screamed the words. \"Most of what I told you was\ntrue. My brother did work for Wendel and ... I didn't know that he had\ndied. I just found that out a few hours ago. I came to Mars to help\nhim, to save him if I could. I was a Wendel agent, but only because I\nhad no choice. They threatened to kill my brother ... used that as a\nweapon to make me spy for them and do--uglier things.\"\n\nHer voice rose pleadingly. \"Bring the ship back. Don't send me out\nalone into space. You can't be that cruel--\"\n\n\"We can't bring the ship back. But we can save you. Just tell the\ntruth. Wendel knew that the Board was sending someone to Mars to\ninvestigate the combine, a man who couldn't be bribed to shut his eyes\nto what he was sure to see here. You had instructions to kill that man\nbefore he could set foot on Mars. Wendel wanted him killed because they\nknew the Board was backing him to the hilt and he had been given enough\nauthority to make him the most dangerous kind of adversary. Wendel also\nknew that you were the most resourceful and intelligent agent in their\nemploy.\n\n\"You proved that, to my satisfaction, when you did what no one has\never done before--outwitted a Mars' rocket security alert system\nby concealing yourself in a cybernetic robot. I'm sure it didn't\ntake Wendel long to discover that you are as intelligent as you are\nbeautiful--both valuable assets in a secret agent. Priceless assets.\nThe time is very short. Am I right so far?\"\n\n\"Yes ... it's all true. Please ... help me!\"\n\n\"You tried to kill, without success, the man the Board was sending to\nMars to investigate and crack down on both Wendel and Endicott. You\ntried to kill him three times.\"\n\n\"No, only once. I'm telling you the truth. I didn't fire that dart.\nThere were other Wendel agents on board. One tried to blow up the ship.\nAnd there were other Wendel agents in New Chicago, with instructions to\nassassinate him if they could.\"\n\n\"I see. But you did try to kill him in New Chicago. Why did you come to\nMars, if you didn't intend to try again?\"\n\n\"I told you. I didn't lie when I said I came to save my brother, that I\nwanted to see Wendel exposed ... forced to face criminal charges. When\nI tried to stab him in the New Chicago Underground and failed ... I\nrealized what Wendel had done to me, what a vicious person I'd become.\nI decided I couldn't go on being that kind of person any longer, not\neven to save my brother. I took the only other way I could think of\nto keep Wendel from killing my brother. I _am_ a resourceful woman, I\n_am_ intelligent ... why should I deny it? I might have made the Wendel\nCombine think twice about killing him. But now my brother's dead and--\"\n\nHer shoulders sagged and a look of torment came into her eyes.\n\n\"All right. One thing more. When that Wendel agent surprised you in the\nchart room and the man you'd tried to kill saved you ... why were you\nso frightened? Why did the agent go into such a rage? You must have\nthought he intended to kill you. And if you were both Wendel agents--\"\n\n\"I wasn't supposed to be on the ship. He knew it, and must have been\npretty sure I'd turned traitor. He knew all about my brother. There\nwasn't much he didn't know about me, because he was a very high-placed\nagent. He knew I had every reason to hate Wendel. And I think he was\nalso the kind of man who turns sadistic when he has a woman completely\nat his mercy.\"\n\nShe saw me then. I could tell by the way her eyes widened and then\nfastened on me, staring straight past Littlefield as if he was no\nlonger her only accuser.\n\nBut she was mistaken if she thought I had any desire to accuse her.\nI was furious with Littlefield, sickened by his relentless attack on\nher and if I hadn't been stunned for a moment, caught up in a kind\nof hypnotic spell by the suddenness of that attack and the startling\ncandor she'd displayed in replying to it I'd have interfered sooner.\n\nWhat she'd told him was evidence. It would help me to smash Wendel in\na legal way, which is always the best way, when backed up as it would\nhave to be by armed, completely lawful authority. All I'd have to do\nwould be to put what she'd just said into one package and what Wendel\nagents had done to an Endicott fuel cylinder in a densely populated\nsection of the Colony in another and bring the two packages together\nand there would take place, on Earth and on Mars, the kind of explosion\nthat would blow the Wendel Combine into the rubbish bin of history. The\nWendel-Endicott war would be over, and the Colonists would have a new\nbirth of freedom.\n\nA death-bed confession has the strongest kind of legal validity and\nwhen a woman thinks she has been sent out into space on an unmanned\nrocket perhaps to die ... she is not likely to lie about anything.\nAn unforeseeable accident--a blind fluke of circumstance--had dealt\nLittlefield a winning hand and he had taken full advantage of it. He\nhad done it to help me, God pity him ... for I hated him for it.\n\nEvery question he'd asked her and every reply she'd taken a minute or\ntwo to make explicit had cut down her chances of staying on this side\nof eternity.\n\nShe was looking straight at me.\n\n\"Ralph!\" she said. \"I don't want to die alone in space! What are they\ntrying to do to me?\"\n\nIt was as much as I could take.\n\nI grabbed Littlefield by the shoulders and swung him about and\ndemanded. \"You said you could save her. How? Were you lying? If you\nwere ... I'll kill you.\"\n\n\"Let go of me, Ralph,\" he said. \"A chance like that would never come\nagain. I had to risk it.\"\n\n\"All right--you've risked it. Now ... can you save her? That's all I\nwant to know. Nothing else matters.\"\n\n\"Yes ... I think so. If the cylinder doesn't blow up for three or four\nmore minutes. If she puts on a vacuum suit and goes out into space and\nwe're able to pick her up tomorrow or the next day--\"\n\n\"Then for God's sake tell her. You'll have to tell her about the\ncylinder, or she won't know how great the danger is. She may take her\ntime about it.\"\n\n\"All right,\" he said. \"I'll take care of it.\"\n\nHe was talking to her in the big screen when Joan and I walked out of\nthe port clearance building.\n\nWe walked out because, if the explosion had come while he was talking,\njust watching it would have killed me. No worse death can come to a\nman than the one that can take place inwardly, for it can shrivel and\nblacken his soul and leave him a burnt-out shell of a man until he dies\nphysically. And Joan could sense that, and wanted to get me out of\nthere as quickly as possible.\n\nThe explosion came a full ten minutes later, which meant that even\nHillard hadn't known how variable the critical mass buildup could be in\nat least a few of the Endicott cylinders.\n\nWe were standing in the open, two hundred feet from the nearest rocket\nlaunching pad, when we saw it--Littlefield's exploding star high up in\nthe night sky. The brightness lasted less than ten seconds.\n\n\n\n\n21\n\n\nYou can be holding high cards, practically unbeatable, in the final\ndeal of a poker game and still not be sure of winning. You have to call\nyour opponent's hand before he gets the idea that just by drawing out\na gun and shooting you dead he can gather up all the chips, and cash\nthem in by threatening further violence. Assuming, of course, that he's\ncapable of that kind of violence and is in all respects the opposite of\nan honest gambler.\n\nYou can be even less sure of winning when it isn't a game of cards\nyou're on the point of winning, but a duel to the death with a ruthless\npower combine and time is running out on you.\n\nI had all the evidence I needed now to smash the Wendel Combine. But it\nhad to be built up by legal experts, and stripped down as well, until\nthe documentation had the sinewy, blockbusting persuasiveness of a\nchampion's punch.\n\nIt would have to stir popular fury on Earth on a very wide scale,\nbe made so convincing that no one could possibly mistake it for a\ntrumped-up shakedown in another grab for power. And that would take\ntime--two or three weeks, at least.\n\nAnd right at the moment Wendel was almost certainly out of the hospital\nand back in the Wendel plant, getting ready to close in on the skyport\nwith his army of goons.\n\nThe problem that confronted me can be summarized in just one sentence.\nI had to get into my uniform, pin the silver bird into place and\ncomplete just two visits, or Wendel would dig my grave wide and deep.\n\nNot just my own grave, of course--but when you fight to stay alive you\nremember all of the things you want to protect and stay alive for.\nThere are men, I suppose, who are chiefly concerned with survival on a\nmore primitive plane, but I think I can honestly say I've never been\nthat kind of man.\n\nMy first visit was going to be to one hell of a live man--Joseph\nSherwood. Sherwood had undisputed custody, by authority of the Board,\nof every nuclear weapon in the Colony with enough large-scale\ndestructive potential to make open defiance of that authority an\nextremely risky undertaking.\n\nI was now his superior in rank, but I had no intention of making\nchanges in his command or questioning the wisdom of the decisions he\nwas more than qualified to make. The measures he had taken to protect\nthe Colony I regarded as absolutely correct and he knew far more\nabout nuclear armaments than I did. There were limits to what those\nmeasures could accomplish, because a large-scale thermonuclear weapon\ncan destroy thousands of innocent victims, and the Wendel Combine knew\nprecisely how far it could go without bringing down the thunder.\n\nAll I had to do was convince Wendel that it had now gone too far and\nthat the thunder was very close. Basically it would be quite a simple\nundertaking. I would simply have to walk into the Wendel plant and talk\nto him in a calm way, at the risk of being blown apart.\n\nI was standing before a full-length mirror in a small, windowless room\nwhich the skyport officials had assured me wasn't wired for sound.\nIt sure had privacy. Not that I'd need it while I was putting on my\nuniform, because I'd be wearing it when I emerged and they would all\nsee the silver bird. And Joan was the only woman in the building ...\nwhich made privacy a little absurd on more than one count.\n\nIt was just that--well, when you stand before a mirror and pin that\nkind of insignia on a quite ordinary, regulation-fit uniform it does\nsomething to the wearer which changes the way he looks in a quite\nstartling way.\n\nI guess I just didn't want anyone to see me observing the change\nin a mirror and grin, which would have forced me to do something I\njust hadn't time for--take a sock at him. I suppose there's a little\ngarden-variety vanity in me--show me a man who claims he hasn't a trace\nof it in his nature and I'll show you a first-class liar--but right at\nthe moment I wouldn't have been lying if I'd said that nothing could\nhave been further from my mind than preening myself on the way I looked.\n\nBut it was just as well I had privacy, because I had to stand before\nthe mirror for three full minutes to get accustomed to the change, and\nfeel relaxed and casual about it.\n\nI'd forgotten to tell Commander Littlefield I'd be needing a tractor,\nwarmed up and ready to roll, and that the place to find it waiting for\nme would be right outside the gate. The one I'd left there with a dead\nman sitting in it didn't have quite the trim, speedy look of three or\nfour I'd noticed standing about the skyport and if he could get me a\nlighter one so much the better.\n\nJoan was taking care of it for me. She came back just as I was turning\nfrom the mirror, with the silver bird gleaming on my right shoulder.\nShe'd seen me wearing it before, of course, so she wasn't startled. But\nthe tall, stoop-shouldered man with graying temples who had followed\nher into the room had enough startlement in his eyes to have made her a\npresent of half of it and still made the grade in that respect.\n\nHe kept staring at the silver bird in tight-lipped silence until I\ndarted a questioning glance at Joan and he seemed to realize he was\nputting a strain on my patience.\n\n\"My name's John Lynton,\" he said, hesitantly. \"Commander Littlefield\ntold me you'll be needing a tractor. I have one, and I'll be glad to\ndrive you, sir. I brought the Endicott fuel cylinder to the skyport,\nso I naturally feel pretty strongly about everything that's happened.\nThere's just one thing I'd like to see happen to Wendel. But I guess I\ndon't have to spell it out for you, sir.\"\n\nI stared at him in amazement. I'd taken it for granted that the\nColonist who had delivered the cylinder was no longer at the skyport,\nbecause no one had pointed him out to me, and I'd been under too much\nof a strain to question Littlefield about it.\n\n\"Well ... that takes care of one thing that puzzled me,\" I said. \"I\ncouldn't understand why you'd just deliver the cylinder and clear out.\nBut people here seem to feel they're privileged to do pretty much as\nthey please at times. So it didn't puzzle me too much.\"\n\n\"I was in the Administration Building, talking to a sky ship officer,\nwhen you were in the shed, sir,\" he explained. \"But I saw you come into\nthe projection room--\"\n\n\"All right,\" I said. \"We haven't time to discuss it and it's not\nimportant anyway. I know how to drive a tractor, but I'm not an expert\nat it. If you've got your own tractor you'll know what to do if it\nbreaks down. That's an advantage I'd be a fool to pass up. But if\nyou're going with me, you may as well know we'll be in danger the\ninstant we pass through the gate. The Wendel agents have orders to\nblast me down on sight.\"\n\nI shouldn't have said that, for it made Joan bite down hard on her\nunderlip and say in a kind of talking-to-herself whisper, \"An armed\nescort would cut down the danger. Littlefield could--\"\n\nI shook my head. \"We'd be certain to be stopped then and an open clash\nwith Wendel agents in the streets of the Colony would wrap it up--but\ngood. There's no way of packaging it that would please Wendel more.\"\n\nThe instant Lynton realized, just from the way I was looking at Joan,\nthat I wanted to be alone with her he said: \"I'd better check over the\ntractor once more. I'll drive it through the gate, draw in to the side\nof the clear-away and keep a sharp eye on the incoming traffic--if any.\nI'll keep the motor running, sir.\"\n\nThe instant the door closed behind him Joan was in my arms. For the\nmost part all we did was embrace without saying a word, which is one\nway of saying as much as you possibly can in the space of half a minute.\n\nI was a little afraid that Joan would break down and burst into tears,\nwhich would have spoiled everything. I could see the tears trembling\non the fringes of her eyelids, and decided right then and there that\nshe was one hell of a precious woman. And when you're parting with\nsomething very precious you can break your heart in two if you let\nyourself do too much thinking.\n\nSo I just kissed her very firmly on the mouth for the tenth time, swung\nabout and walked out of that small, windowless room without looking\nback to see if she was still doing her best to keep the tears from\nflowing.\n\nIn the ambulance on the way to the hospital I'd seen more of the Colony\nthan I could have covered on foot in half a day. Jogging through the\nstreets again with Lynton doing the driving I could have taken in even\nmore of it in a sight-seeing way. I could have--but I didn't.\n\nI saw no reason to make myself conspicuous, and somehow removing\nthe insignia from my shoulder so soon after I'd pinned it on would\nhave gone against the grain. And it wasn't just my uniform or the\nsilver bird which would have made me a sitting duck to a Wendel agent\nstationed anywhere along the way with my description dear and sharp in\nhis mind. It was a safe bet we'd pass at least a dozen of the Combine's\ngoons, strutting about in their private police uniforms, so I took care\nto remain in a seated position in the back of the tractor, with my head\nwell below sight-seeing level.\n\nThis time I didn't look, wonder or black out at intervals. I kept a\ntight grip on my nerves and refused to even let myself think what an\nimpasse I'd be facing if my talk with Arms Custodian Sherwood didn't\nbring the kind of results I was counting on.\n\nIt's hard to maintain just one rigid mental stance when you're keeping\na great many hard-to-control emotions bottled up in your mind with a\nclamped-down safety valve. But I didn't have to maintain the stance\nfor long, because twenty minutes after we left the skyport the tractor\nrumbled to a halt before a massive, fortress-like building which stood\na considerable distance from the buildings on both sides of it and\nwas protected in its isolation by steel walls, pacing guards and a\nwell-guarded stockpile of thermonuclear weapons.\n\nNo Wendel agent would have risked blasting away at me within three\nmiles of that stronghold--unless he was tired of living and didn't want\nto see another Martian sunrise. It made me feel secure enough to stand\nup and descend from the tractor without making a production out of it,\nas if I was two-thirds convinced I'd be blown apart before I could\nadvance twenty feet.\n\nI neither hurried nor wasted time, just stood calmly by the tractor\nuntil I was satisfied no one who had seen us drive up--I was quite sure\nwe were under long-range binocular scrutiny--would come striding out\nof the forest to question us at gunpoint. Then I nodded to Lynton, and\nwalked straight toward the big gray building. I'd told him not to move\nfrom his seat until I came out, so there was no need to caution him\nfurther.\n\nI can't remember at exactly what point in my approach to the\nhigh-walled gate the silver bird became a thunder-bird, or exactly how\neach of the three guards looked when they first caught sight of it.\n\nI was too startled just by the way the oldest of the three, who must\nhave been a tow-headed twelve-year-old when the first wearer of the\ninsignia walked the streets of the Colony, stared at me, snapped to\nattention and grounded the heavy weapon he'd been holding slantwise\nacross his chest with a thud. The other two guards quickly followed\nsuit. Quite possibly they had merely taken their cue from him and\ndidn't want to risk an official reprimand. But they certainly put on a\nconvincing performance, as if what they feared most was a full-dress\ncourt martial. If I'd dropped down out of the sky in a golden chariot\nand was Apollo, maybe, or the Aztec Sun God, I couldn't have been\naccorded more deference.\n\nA moment later the high steel gate opened and shut with a clang and I\nwas on the inside, with more guards on both sides of me. I'd paused\na moment, of course, to explain to the elderly guard who had first\nsaluted me, just why I was there and whom I wanted to see.\n\nI had an escort of six guards as I walked to the end of the\nfirst-floor corridor, and ascended a short flight of stairs and they\ncontinued to escort all the way to the door of Sherwood's office.\n\nSome men can be jolted almost speechless by an unexpected visit and\nrecover their composure so rapidly they seem to have retained it from\nthe beginning. It was that way with Sherwood. He was a big man in his\nearly forties, with close-cropped reddish hair and handsome features.\n\nHe was sparing of words, but everything he told me was in direct answer\nto my questions and a man who can confine himself to just giving you\nthe information you need without wasting words is likely to be the kind\nof man you can depend on in an emergency.\n\nHis final answer was the clincher. It came at the end of a\nfifteen-minute conversation.\n\n\"We can do it if we've no other choice,\" he said.\n\n\"All right,\" I said. \"I want you to tell Wendel exactly what you've\njust told me, on a two-way televisual hookup. I'll be at the Wendel\nplant in fifteen minutes, and I'm sure I can persuade him to talk to\nyou on the screen, right after I've laid it on the line for him.\n\n\"If,\" I added \"--and it's a very big _if_--I can get in to see him\nwithout ending up dead. His goons have orders to blast me down on\nsight.\"\n\nHe looked at me steadily for a moment, with a concerned tightening of\nhis lips. Then he leaned back and some of the strain left his face.\n\n\"Have any of his goons ever seen you with that insignia on your\nshoulder?\" he asked.\n\nIt was a good question and it confirmed the opinion I'd formed of him.\n\n\"No, they haven't,\" I said. \"But it doesn't alter the possibility\nI'll be blasted down before I can get in to see Wendel. Remember--the\nWendel Combine has taken the big gamble and is waging an undeclared,\nbut all out war. This insignia makes me Target Number One. If I took\nit off before entering the plant his goons would probably recognize\nme anyway--too quickly for me to save myself by shouting at them and\ntrying to make them see that Wendel would want them to withhold their\nfire. I may not have a chance to do any explaining, because they may\nrecognize me just from the description that's been furnished them.\"\n\nSherwood nodded. \"Yes ... it would be foolish to deny you won't be\nexposing yourself to danger. And you'll have to be wearing the insignia\nwhen you confront Wendel. But I've a feeling that Wendel's goons\nwill take you straight to him. I could be mistaken, of course. But\nsomehow I can't picture them firing pointblank at Target Number One\nwithout prior authorization. They'd be sticking out their necks with a\nvengeance, because their instructions to blast you on sight were issued\nbefore you pinned that bird on your shoulder.\"\n\n\"I hope you're right,\" I said. \"But goons are funny people.\"\n\n\"I'll be right here at my desk when the screen lights up,\" he said.\n\"Don't worry too much. I'll handle my end of it with very careful\ntiming....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFifteen minutes later my tractor rumbled to a halt for the second time,\ndirectly in front of the Wendel plant.\n\nLike the Endicott plant, it faced a big square and there were no\npedestrians in sight on the side we parked on.\n\n\"This time I'm going with you,\" Lynton said, very firmly.\n\nSo he was going with me! All right, it was an obligation I owed him,\nand I couldn't pull rank on him, because he was a civilian and it\nwouldn't have done the least bit of good. Moreover, he'd gotten over\nbeing dazzled by the silver bird, if it had ever really dazzled him,\nwhich I doubted. He was a too tough-fibered, independent, non-authority\nconscious kind of guy. You find them in every rugged, pioneering\nsociety--guys who will stand up in a public meeting and tell a\ngovernmental big shot that the speech he's just delivered has a phony\nring to it and he'd be well advised to try again.\n\nI descended from the tractor a little more cautiously this time,\nkeeping my eye on the ground-floor windows of the plant and wondering\nhow long it would take me to cross from the car to the building's wide\nmain entrance and if the steel-mesh blinds on the windows might not be\na cover-up for nuclear weapons pointed straight in our direction.\n\nBut actually, despite the uneasiness which we both felt, we crossed\nfrom the tractor to the plant without hurrying and with our shoulders\nheld straight.\n\nThere were two guards in Wendel private police uniforms with nuclear\nhand-guns clamped to their hips standing just inside the entrance and\nthe instant we came into view their hands darted to the holstered\nweapons and their eyes took on a steely glint.\n\nThen--both guards did a swift double take. They didn't stiffen to\nattention the way the guards at the gate of the nuclear fortress had\ndone, but something happened to their faces which made them seem to be\nwearing frozen masks. Only their eyes remained alive, alert, the steely\nglint replaced by a look of stunned incredulity.\n\nI spoke sharply, without giving them time to reach a decision on their\nown initiative which might have had tragic consequences, for you can\nnever tell what desperate, completely unjustified measures a badly\njolted man will take it into his head to resort to.\n\n\"I'm here to see Wendel,\" I said. \"Nobody else will do. I guess I don't\nhave to tell you that this is an order. You'd be very foolish not to\nunbar that gate, for I have the authority to take you into custody if\nyou prevent me from entering the plant. You may be just guards, but\nthat will not prevent the Colonization Board from imprisoning you on a\ntreason charge.\"\n\nTheir eyes never left the insignia while they were swinging open the\nbig, iron-barred entrance gate for me. It was set well back from the\nstreet, with enough walled-in space in front of it to accommodate a\ndozen bloody corpses. I had an idea they would have tried to make use\nof it in that way, if I'd attempted to force my way past them with an\narmed escort and hadn't been wearing the silver bird.\n\nThe strain and uncertainty eased a little once we were fairly sure we\nwouldn't be blasted down without warning. It didn't take long for that\nnear-assurance to harden into a conviction, for what happened after the\nbig gate clanged shut behind us was almost a repeat of what had taken\nplace in the nuclear fortress.\n\nMore armed Wendel police guards fell into step on both sides of us,\nwith much the same look on their faces the two at the entrance had worn\nten seconds after their eyes had rested on the silver bird.\n\nJust one small incident took place which made it a little unlike the\nreception which had been accorded me when I'd asked to see Sherwood. We\nwere held up at the end of a branching corridor while one of the guards\nwent into a small, blank-walled room and buzzed Wendel on an interplant\ncommunicator, announcing our arrival.\n\nWe didn't know that until later, because he was careful to shut the\ndoor of the room before he spoke into the communicator. When he came\nout there was a hardness around his eyes, a look of grim satisfaction\nthat should have warned me that we were in danger. But you don't always\nattach as much weight as you should to a quick change of expression on\nthe face of a man whose job requires him to resort to brutal violence\ntwo or three times a week. The face of such a man can harden just from\nhabit.\n\nBecause it was the kind of mistake it was easy to make and the other\nguards were keeping their hostility under wraps we didn't know or even\nsuspect that we were walking straight into a trap until we were almost\nat the door of Wendel's office on the second floor of the plant.\n\nIf you're the head of a big power combine, and shrewd, as Wendel\nunquestionably was, and there's a threat to your survival coming\nstraight toward you along an echoing corridor and you want to be sure\nin advance he'll be a broken man when you talk with him in strict\nprivacy, with the chips scattered widely and the game almost at an\nend--you'll either take care of it yourself, or assign just one man you\ncan trust to do the job for you.\n\nNot a dozen men--or half a dozen--but just one. It's more efficient\nthat way, more certain, the right way to go about it.\n\nI had no way of knowing that, of course, no way of looking through a\nwall at Wendel standing motionless or possibly seated in a chair, his\neyes gleaming triumphantly, as we approached the door of his office,\nwith just one guard walking a few paces behind us.\n\nExcept that--deep in my mind the alarm bells were ringing again. They\nwere ringing, all right, but very, very faintly and I don't know to\nthis day what made me turn my head and look behind me just as he was\nwhipping out the heavy metal thong.\n\nI caught only the barest glimpse of the thong gleaming in the corridor\nlight. But even if he'd kept it concealed for a few seconds longer his\nface would have given him away. His eyes were blazing with a savage\nenmity, and he started for me the instant he realized that I had been\nforewarned.\n\nI gripped Lynton by the arm and fell back against the wall, tugging\nhim around so that he was far enough behind me to give me a chance to\ngrapple with Hard Eyes head-on, with complete freedom of movement.\n\nHe made the mistake of coming at me too fast. It might not have been a\nmistake if he hadn't been so reckless with the thong, trying to lash me\nacross the chest with it before he was sure of his balance. The sheer\nweight of the weapon carried him forward, straight past me, and it went\nswishing through the air without hitting anything.\n\nI made a grab for his wrist and before he could recover his balance I\nwas twisting it relentlessly and slamming my fist against the side of\nhis head. He sank to his knees and I kept right on hammering away at\nhim, hitting him first on the right temple and then on the left and not\neven stopping to take the thong away from him.\n\nThere was no need for me to relieve him of the thong, for he flattened\nout on the floor still holding on to it and passed out cold. It seemed\nonly reasonable and just to let him keep it as a souvenir.\n\nI was out of breath and feeling a little dizzy, because when you hit\nanyone as hard as I'd hit Hard Eyes, not caring much whether I killed\nhim or not, it takes a minute or two to recover. I still hadn't quite\ngotten my breath back when the door of Wendel's office slammed open and\nWendel himself stood there, staring down at the guard with a look of\nconsternation on his face.\n\nI became a little alarmed when I saw that Lynton had moved out from\nthe wall and was making straight for him with his arm drawn back.\nHell--that's an understatement. I became very much alarmed, because the\none thing I didn't want was to have Wendel belted unconscious and laid\nout on the floor at the guard's side before I could have a talk with\nhim.\n\nI got between them just in time, and I grabbed Wendel by the shoulders\nand hurled him back into his office and when he staggered a little and\nalmost fell I grabbed hold of him for the second time, and slammed him\ndown in the chair in front of his big, metal-topped desk.\n\nHe looked up at me for a moment with a killing rage in his eyes, but\nI didn't give him a chance to get his breath back. For the barest\ninstant, though, if he had been quick enough, he might have succeeded\nin getting to his feet and lashing out at me, for I saw something on\nthe opposite side of the room that seemed almost too good to be true,\nand I took three full seconds out to stare at it.\n\nIt was a big tele-communicator screen--just the kind of screen I had\nbeen sure I'd find somewhere in the plant, but hardly in Wendel's\nprivate office. The fact that Sherwood had one in his office was not\nquite so surprising, for Sherwood's custodianship of thermonuclear\nweapons had made him more communication-conscious.\n\nI'd counted on being able to persuade Wendel to accompany me to\nwherever the plant's screen happened to be located, after I'd had a\nserious talk with him. But since he hadn't wanted me to have a talk\nwith him until he'd done his best to get me killed or crippled for\nlife, and I would now have to keep him boxed up in his office by force\nwhile we conducted the talk, having the screen so accessible was one\nhell of a lucky break.\n\n\"Shut the door,\" I told Lynton. \"And lock it.\"\n\nI waited until Lynton had complied, my hands on Wendel's shoulders\nwith so fierce a clamp-hold that he gave up trying to rise.\n\n\"You'll never get out of here alive!\" he choked. \"If you think--\"\n\n\"Don't press your luck, Wendel,\" I said, warningly. \"I might be tempted\nto break your neck.\"\n\n\"That insignia you're wearing doesn't mean a thing now, Graham. Don't\nyou understand? You couldn't command a fly to crawl over a bread crumb.\nThe Wendel Combine is taking over the Colony.\"\n\n\"Not a fly, Wendel,\" I said. \"The Wendel Combine. A big boa\nconstrictor has nothing in common with a fly and I'm not interested\nin bread crumbs. And this will surprise you. _You're_ going to do\nthe commanding. You're going to command the boa constrictor to start\ndisgorging--every kill it's ever swallowed. It's going to flatten\nitself out until it's just a mass of cold mottled skin, which the Board\nwill know how to deal with.\"\n\n\"Who's going to make me?\"\n\n\"I am,\" I said. \"You have just ten minutes to make up your mind. You\neither turn over all of the Combine's nuclear weapons to the Board,\nbreak the back of the Wendel police force by arresting all of its\nofficers and placing yourself under house arrest and order every Wendel\nemployee to cooperate with the Board or--Joseph Sherwood will vaporize\nthe plant with a thermonuclear bomb. The rocket will be guided by\nremote control and will hover directly above the plant until the bomb\nhas been dropped. Only the plant will be destroyed. There will be no\nzone of spreading radio-active contamination.\"\n\nAll of the color drained from Wendel's face, leaving it ashen. \"You\nmust be mad!\" he gasped. \"You'd die too.\"\n\n\"I'm aware of that,\" I said. \"We'll all be vaporized together. But it\nisn't too bad a way to die, Wendel. You feel no pain, never know--\"\n\n\"Do you expect me to take that threat seriously?\" he breathed.\n\n\"I'm afraid I do,\" I said. I gestured toward the tele-communicator.\n\"Sherwood will tell you how serious it is. He's waiting to talk to you.\nSuppose we turn that screen on and listen to what he has to say. I'm\nsure you know how to get the right wave-length. The Wendel spy network\nwould hardly fail to keep you informed when Sherwood changes the code\nfrequencies.\"\n\n\"You said ten minutes,\" Wendel was breathing harshly now and the veins\non his forehead were thick blue cords. \"You'd have to let Sherwood\nknow when to drop the bomb. You haven't been in communication with\nhim since you arrived here. Suppose I refuse to dial? That's a very\nintricate, highly specialized communicator. You couldn't operate it.\"\n\nThat made me change my mind about letting him do the dialing. I\nwas pretty sure I'd experience no difficulty in getting in contact\nwith Sherwood and I didn't want to give Wendel a chance to make the\ncommunicator even more specialized by ripping put some of the wiring.\n\nI turned to Lynton and indicated by tapping Wendel forcibly on the\nshoulder that I was about to relinquish my hold on the Combine's\ndifficult president, and would he kindly take my place behind the chair.\n\n\"Don't let him move,\" I cautioned, when we'd changed places. \"Keep a\ntight grip on his shoulders.\"\n\n\"Don't worry,\" Lynton said. \"If he moves an inch I'll do what you said\nmight not be a bad idea--break his neck.\"\n\nIt didn't take me long to discover that Wendel had lied about the\ncommunicator, which meant, of course, that he had been hoping I'd give\nhim a chance to do a quick job of sabotage on the wiring.\n\nIt was just a run-of-the-mill, two-way televisual communicator, with\nnothing specialized about it.\n\nThere was a humming sound for a few seconds right after I'd finished\ndialing and it gave me a chance to scrutinize Wendel's face to see how\nhe was taking it.\n\nHe was terrified, all right. But his lips were still set in defiant\nlines and I was sure that if he could have gotten a grip on my throat\nright at that moment getting his fingers unlocked wouldn't have been\neasy.\n\nI thought that when Sherwood's image appeared on the screen there would\nbe just one minute of hard-to-live-through uncertainty--that he'd back\nup what I'd told Wendel with his hand on the rocket release button and\nlook straight at me, as if awaiting a signal I had no intention of\ngiving.\n\nBut I suddenly realized I didn't know just how it was going to be.\nWould Wendel stay defiant right up to the end, would he defeat me\nthrough sheer stubbornness, even though he was mortally terrified?\n\nBut there was one thing I did know. For the first time, as I waited\nfor Sherwood's image to appear on the screen, I knew with absolute\ncertainty, beyond any possibility of doubt, that I could never go\nthrough with it.\n\nThe rocket had to be prepared and ready--the nuclear deterrent had to\nbe a reality--or I could never have carried the bluff through with the\nkind of confidence that just the knowledge that you're holding the\nhighest cards in the deck can give you.\n\nI had to feel that I _just might give the signal_.\n\nBut vaporizing the plant would have cost the lives of thirty thousand\npeople and not more than a fourth of them were vicious criminals. I\njust couldn't see myself ordering a nuclear bomb to be dropped on more\nthan twenty thousand completely innocent Wendel plant engineers and\nlaboratory technicians.\n\nPerhaps I shouldn't have felt that way, because if the Wendel Combine\ntook over the Colony three or four times that number of innocent people\nwould perish, or sink into degradation and become completely enslaved.\nBut I did feel that way and--well, I wouldn't have to live with what\nI'd done, because I'd be killed by the blast. But I didn't want that on\nmy conscience even as a dead man.\n\nI couldn't go through with it, but had I ever really intended to? It\ndidn't mean I couldn't win, didn't change what I'd come to do. If\nI could carry my bluff through without flinching, right up to the\nzero-count instant, there was a very good chance that Wendel would\ncrack. A very good chance still.\n\nI had the highest cards in the deck and was only handicapped in one\nway. If the zero-count instant came and Wendel didn't crack I couldn't\nplay them.\n\nI've never really believed in miracles. But if you're holding what\nyou think are the highest cards, and something happens to your hand\nyou never dreamed could happen--if you look and see you've got a card\nthat's even higher, just slipped in between the others as a gift ...\nwell, that's pretty close to a miracle, isn't it?\n\nI thought when Sherwood's image appeared on the screen he'd be sitting\nalone behind his desk, with his thumb on the rocket-release button.\nBut he wasn't alone and when I saw who was with him I almost stopped\nbreathing....\n\nJoan was with him and she was looking straight at me out of the screen.\n\n\"Don't do it, Ralph!\" she pleaded. \"Oh, God, no--\"\n\nThen I saw that she was staring past me and without turning I knew that\nshe was appealing to Wendel with the same look of pleading desperation\nin her eyes. \"If he gives the signal his command will be obeyed. And\nhe'll do it unless you stop him! When you've lived with a man in the\nintimacy of marriage--yes, that's important and I have to say it--you\nknow him better than anyone else. You know what he's capable of. He'll\ngive the signal unless you do as he says, because the insignia he's\nwearing gives him no choice. If you don't stop him now ... _you'll die\nwith him_!\"\n\nI turned then and stared straight at Wendel. I'd never seen a man sag\nbefore in quite the way he did. All of the life seemed to go out of his\neyes. His defiance gave way to a look of utter hopelessness, of abject\nsurrender, and he sank so low in his chair that he seemed on the verge\nof slumping to the floor, despite Lynton's grip on his shoulders.\n\nHis voice, when he spoke, scarcely rose above a whisper. \"All right,\nGraham,\" he said. \"You win.\"\n\nAs I turned back to the screen and saw the look of overwhelming relief\nand gratefulness in Joan's eyes I couldn't help wondering how close she\nhad been to being right. Had the insignia really given me any choice?\nIf Wendel had stayed defiant and refused to crack--would I have gone\nthrough with it? How much does any man know about _himself_?\n\nI'd probably never know the answer.\n\nIn the days that followed every one of the Wendel agents were rounded\nup and returned to Earth to stand trial. I never did find out the\nidentity of the agent who had shot the dart at me from high up on\nthe spiral or the one who had sent a little mechanical killer in my\ndirection by the shores of Lake Michigan in New Chicago.\n\nIt didn't worry me at all, because I was sure that both of those\ndelightful characters were among the agents who had been rounded up in\nthe mopping up operations.\n\nOh, yes--they rescued her with her hair in disarray and no longer\nstanding high up on her head. Three days later, drifting through empty\nspace about three hundred thousand miles from Mars. She's in prison now\nand will have to answer charges. But I intend to go all out in the plea\nI'll make in her defense when she comes up for trial.\n\nSome judges are enlightened and merciful and others are harsh tyrants,\nbut with the backing of the Board I'm not too worried about the\noutcome. If it goes against us, I'll take it to the highest court in\nthe land, and the backing of the Board carries plenty of weight there\ntoo.\n\nEventually I forgave Commander Littlefield.\n\n\"I'm a hard man, Ralph,\" he said, standing in the starlight outside\nthe Port Administration Section with a crumpled sheet of paper in his\nhand, right after he'd received assurances from Earth he'd be placed in\ncommand of a new sky ship. \"I did what I did because I am what I am. I\nknew that her life hung in the balance, that every word we exchanged\nincreased the danger. But when I weighed that against the future of\nthe Colony--I felt I had no choice. I knew what a full confession would\nmean to us.\"\n\nI never saw Nurse Cherubin again. She married her doctor and they were\nhoneymoon passengers on the next scheduled Earth trip, which took place\nwhile I was busy making sure that the whole Wendel Combine would come\napart at the seams. It was a little like watching a volcanic explosion\nand keeping the lava flow channeled with the full weight of the Board's\nauthority.\n\nJoan and I have become Martian Colony residents for the duration. I\nmean by that there will always be new battles to be fought in a war\nthat will never end ... as long as Man stays a part of the universe.\nThere's something embattled about him that you don't find in any other\nspecies. Maybe it's good and maybe it's bad, but it helps to explain\nwhy he keeps building for the future, He never knows--and just not\nknowing makes him want to build as sturdily as he can.\n\nYou never prize anything so much as when you feel you're about to lose\nit. So you fight to preserve it, and when you've done that you've built\nup enough excess energy to want to make a stab at something better. And\nwhen that's threatened you'll fight again and so on until the final\ncurtain.\n\nIt's just the way things are.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\nFOR SCIENCE FICTION FANS\n\nA space-age collection of startling adventures\n\n\nWORLDS OF WHEN\n\nGroff Conklin.

It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations.

Information about the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Newby\n    Chief Executive and Director\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
