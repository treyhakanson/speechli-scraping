It presents the latest discoveries among the planets of the\nsolar system, and shows their bearing upon the question of life in those\nplanets. It points out the resemblances and the differences between the\nearth and the other worlds that share with it in the light of the sun.\nIt shows what we should see and experience if we could visit those\nworlds.\n\nWhile basing itself upon facts, it does not exclude the discussion of\ninteresting probabilities and theories that have commanded wide popular\nattention. It points out, for instance, what is to be thought of the\nidea of interplanetary communication. It indicates what must be the\noutlook of the possible inhabitants of some of the other planets toward\nthe earth. As far as may be, it traces the origin and development of the\nother worlds of our system, and presents a graphic picture of their\npresent condition as individuals, and of their wonderful contrasts as\nmembers of a common family.\n\nIn short, the aim of the author has been to show how wide, and how rich,\nis the field of interest opened to the human mind by man's discoveries\nconcerning worlds, which, though inaccessible to him in a physical\nsense, offer intellectual conquests of the noblest description.\n\nAnd, finally, in order to assist those who may wish to recognize for\nthemselves these other worlds in the sky, this book presents a special\nseries of charts to illustrate a method of finding the planets which\nrequires no observatory and no instruments, and only such knowledge of\nthe starry heavens as anybody can easily acquire.\n\nG.P.S.\n\n\nBOROUGH OF BROOKLYN, NEW YORK CITY,\n_September, 1901._\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n_INTRODUCTORY_

Every day we hear people asking one\nanother if it is true that we shall soon be able to communicate with\nsome of the far-off globes, such as Mars, that circle in company with\nour earth about the sun. One of the masters of practical electrical\nscience in our time has suggested that the principle of wireless\ntelegraphy may be extended to the transmission of messages across space\nfrom planet to planet. The existence of intelligent inhabitants in some\nof the other planets has become, with many, a matter of conviction, and\nfor everybody it presents a question of fascinating interest, which has\ndeeply stirred the popular imagination.\n\nThe importance of this subject as an intellectual phenomenon of the\nopening century is clearly indicated by the extent to which it has\nentered into recent literature. Poets feel its inspiration, and\nnovelists and romancers freely select other planets as the scenes of\ntheir stories. One tells us of a visit paid by men to the moon, and of\nthe wonderful things seen, and adventures had, there. Lucian, it is\ntrue, did the same thing eighteen hundred years ago, but he had not the\naid of hints from modern science to guide his speculations and lend\nverisimilitude to his narrative.\n\nAnother startles us from our sense of planetary security with a\nrealistic account of the invasion of the earth by the terrible sons of\nwarlike Mars, seeking to extend their empire by the conquest of foreign\nglobes.\n\nSometimes it is a trip from world to world, a kind of celestial pleasure\nyachting, with depictions of creatures more wonderful than--\n\n    \"The anthropophagi and men whose heads\n    Do grow beneath their shoulders\"--\n\nthat is presented to our imagination; and sometimes we are informed of\nthe visions beheld by the temporarily disembodied spirits of trance\nmediums, or other modern thaumaturgists, flitting about among the\nplanets.\n\nThen, to vary the theme, we find charming inhabitants of other worlds\nrepresented as coming down to the earth and sojourning for a time on our\ndull planet, to the delight of susceptible successors of father Adam,\nwho become, henceforth, ready to follow their captivating visitors to\nthe ends of the universe.\n\nIn short, writers of fiction have already established interplanetary\ncommunication to their entire satisfaction, thus vastly and indefinitely\nenlarging the bounds of romance, and making us so familiar with the\npeculiarities of our remarkable brothers and sisters of Mars, Venus,\nand the moon, that we can not help feeling, notwithstanding the many\ndivergences in the descriptions, that we should certainly recognize them\non sight wherever we might meet them.\n\nBut the subject is by no means abandoned to the tellers of tales and the\ndreamers of dreams. Men of science, also, eagerly enter into the\ndiscussion of the possibilities of other worlds, and become warm over\nit.\n\nAround Mars, in particular, a lively war of opinions rages. Not all\nastronomers have joined in the dispute--some have not imagination\nenough, and some are waiting for more light before choosing sides--but\nthose who have entered the arena are divided between two opposed camps.\nOne side holds that Mars is not only a world capable of having\ninhabitants, but that it actually has them, and that they have given\nvisual proof of their existence and their intelligence through the\nchanges they have produced upon its surface. The other side maintains\nthat Mars is neither inhabited nor habitable, and that what are taken\nfor vast public works and engineering marvels wrought by its\nindustrious inhabitants, are nothing but illusions of the telescope, or\ndelusions of the observer's mind. Both adduce numerous observations,\ntelescopic and spectroscopic, and many arguments, scientific and\ntheoretic, to support their respective contentions, but neither side has\nyet been able to convince or silence the other, although both have made\nthemselves and their views intensely interesting to the world at large,\nwhich would very much like to know what the truth really is.\n\nAnd not only Mars, but Venus--the beauteous twin sister of the earth,\nwho, when she glows in the evening sky, makes everybody a lover of the\nstars--and even Mercury, the Moor among the planets, wearing \"the\nshadowed livery of the burnished sun,\" to whom he is \"a neighbor and\nnear bred,\" and Jupiter, Saturn, and the moon itself--all these have\ntheir advocates, who refuse to believe that they are lifeless globes,\nmere reflectors of useless sunshine.\n\nThe case of the moon is, in this respect, especially interesting, on\naccount of the change that has occurred in the opinions held concerning\nits physical condition. For a very long time our satellite was\nconfidently, and almost universally, regarded as an airless, waterless,\nlifeless desert, a completely \"dead world,\" a bare, desiccated skull of\nrock, circling about the living earth.\n\nBut within a few years there has been a reaction from this extreme view\nof the lifelessness of the moon. Observers tell us of clouds suddenly\nappearing and then melting to invisibility over volcanic craters; of\nevidences of an atmosphere, rare as compared with ours, yet manifest in\nits effects; of variations of color witnessed in certain places as the\nsunlight drifts over them at changing angles of incidence; of what seem\nto be immense fields of vegetation covering level ground, and of\nappearances indicating the existence of clouds of ice crystals and\ndeposits of snow among the mountainous lunar landscapes. Thus, in a\nmanner, the moon is rehabilitated, and we are invited to regard its\nsilvery beams not as the reflections of the surface of a desert, but as\nsent back to our eyes from the face of a world that yet has some slight\nremnants of life to brighten it.\n\nThe suggestion that there is an atmosphere lying close upon the shell of\nthe lunar globe, filling the deep cavities that pit its face and\npenetrating to an unknown depth in its interior, recalls a speculation\nof the ingenious and entertaining Fontenelle, in the seventeenth\ncentury--recently revived and enlarged upon by the author of one of our\nmodern romances of adventure in the moon--to the effect that the lunar\ninhabitants dwell beneath the surface of their globe instead of on the\ntop of it.\n\nNow, because of this widespread and continually increasing interest in\nthe subject of other worlds, and on account of the many curious\nrevelations that we owe to modern telescopes and other improved means of\ninvestigation, it is certainly to be desired that the most important and\ninteresting discoveries that have lately been made concerning the\nvarious globes which together with the earth constitute the sun's\nfamily, should be assembled in a convenient and popular form--and that\nis the object of this book. Fact is admittedly often stranger and more\nwonderful than fiction, and there are no facts that appeal more\npowerfully to the imagination than do those of astronomy. Technical\nbooks on astronomy usually either ignore the subject of the habitability\nof the planets, or dismiss it with scarcely any recognition of the\noverpowering human interest that it possesses. Hence, a book written\nspecially from the point of view of that subject would appear calculated\nto meet a popular want; and this the more, because, since Mr. Proctor\nwrote his Other Worlds than Ours and M. Flammarion his Pluralit\u00e9 des\nMondes Habit\u00e9s, many most important and significant discoveries have\nbeen made that, in several notable instances, have completely altered\nthe aspect in which the planets present themselves for our judgment as\nto their conditions of habitability.\n\nNo doubt the natural tendency of the mind is to regard all the planets\nas habitable worlds, for there seems to be deeply implanted in human\nnature a consciousness of the universality of life, giving rise to a\nconviction that one world, even in the material sense, is not enough for\nit, but that every planet must belong to its kingdom. We are apt to say\nto ourselves: \"The earth is one of a number of planets, all similarly\ncircumstanced; the earth is inhabited, why should not the others also be\ninhabited?\"\n\nWhat has been learned of the unity in chemical constitution and\nmechanical operation prevailing throughout the solar system, together\nwith the continually accumulating evidence of the common origin of its\nvarious members, and the identity of the evolutionary processes that\nhave brought them into being, all tends to strengthen the _a priori_\nhypothesis that life is a phenomenon general to the entire system, and\nonly absent where its essential and fundamental conditions, for special\nand local, and perhaps temporary, reasons, do not exist.\n\nIf we look for life in the sun, for instance, while accepting the\nprevalent conception of the sun as a center of intense thermal action,\nwe must abandon all our ideas of the physical organization of life\nformed upon what we know of it from experimental evidence. We can not\nimagine any form of life that has ever been presented to our senses as\nexisting in the sun.\n\nBut this is not generally true of the planets. Life, in our sense of it,\nis a planetary, not a solar, phenomenon, and while we may find reasons\nfor believing that on some of the planets the conditions are such that\ncreatures organized like ourselves could not survive, yet we can not\npositively say that every form of living organism must necessarily be\nexcluded from a world whose environment would be unsuited for us and our\ncontemporaries in terrestrial life.\n\nAlthough our sole knowledge of animated nature is confined to what we\nlearn by experience on the earth, yet it is a most entertaining, and by\nno means unedifying, occupation, to seek to apply to the exceedingly\ndiversified conditions prevailing in the other planets, as astronomical\nobservations reveal them to us, the principles, types, and limitations\nthat govern the living creatures of our world, and to judge, as best we\ncan, how far those types and limits may be modified or extended so that\nthose other planets may reasonably be included among the probable abodes\nof life.\n\nIn order to form such judgments each planet must be examined by itself,\nbut first it is desirable to glance at the planetary system as a whole.\nTo do this we may throw off, in imagination, the dominance of the sun,\nand suppose ourselves to be in the midst of open space, far removed both\nfrom the sun and the other stars. In this situation it is only by\nchance, or through foreknowledge, that we can distinguish our sun at\nall, for it is lost among the stars; and when we discover it we find\nthat it is only one of the smaller and less conspicuous members of the\nsparkling host.\n\nWe rapidly approach, and when we have arrived within a distance\ncomparable with that of its planets, we see that the sun has increased\nin apparent magnitude, until now it enormously outshines all the other\nstars, and its rays begin to produce the effect of daylight upon the\norbs that they reach. But we are in no danger of mistaking its apparent\nsuperiority to its fellow stars for a real one, because we clearly\nperceive that our nearness alone makes it seem so great and\noverpowering.\n\nAnd now we observe that this star that we have drawn near to has\nattending it a number of minute satellites, faintly shining specks, that\ncircle about it as if charmed, like night-wandering insects, by its\nsplendor. It is manifest to us at the first glance that without the sun\nthese obedient little planets would not exist; it is his attraction that\nbinds them together in a system, and his rays that make them visible to\none another in the abyss of space. Although they vary in relative size,\nyet we observe a striking similarity among them. They are all globular\nbodies, they all turn upon their axes, they all travel about the sun in\nthe same direction, and their paths all lie very nearly in one plane.\nSome of them have one or more moons, or satellites, circling about them\nin imitation of their own revolution about the sun. Their family\nrelationship to one another and to the sun is so evident that it colors\nour judgment about them as individuals; and when we happen to find, upon\ncloser approach, that one of them, the earth, is covered with vegetation\nand water and filled with thousands of species of animated creatures, we\nare disposed to believe, without further examination, that they are all\nalike in this respect, just as they are all alike in receiving light and\nheat from the sun.\n\nThis preliminary judgment, arising from the evident unity of the\nplanetary system, can only be varied by an examination of its members in\ndetail.\n\nOne striking fact that commands our attention as soon as we have entered\nthe narrow precincts of the solar system is the isolation of the sun and\nits attendants in space. The solar system occupies a disk-shaped, or\nflat circular, expanse, about 5,580,000,000 miles across and relatively\nvery thin, the sun being in the center. From the sun to the nearest\nstar, or other sun, the distance is approximately five thousand times\nthe entire diameter of the solar system. But the vast majority of the\nstars are probably a hundred times yet more remote. In other words, if\nthe Solar system be represented by a circular flower-bed ten feet\nacross, the nearest star must be placed at a distance of nine and a half\nmiles, and the great multitude of the stars at a distance of nine\nhundred miles!\n\nOr, to put it in another way, let us suppose the sun and his planets to\nbe represented by a fleet of ships at sea, all included within a space\nabout half a mile across; then, in order that there might be no shore\nrelatively nearer than the nearest fixed star is to the sun, we should\nhave to place our fleet in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, while the\ndistance of the main shore of the starry universe would be so immense\nthat the whole surface of the earth would be far too small to hold the\nexpanse of ocean needed to represent it!\n\nFrom these general considerations we next proceed to recall some of the\ndetails of the system of worlds amid which we dwell. Besides the earth,\nthe sun has seven other principal planets in attendance. These eight\nplanets fall into two classes--the terrestrial planets and the major, or\njovian, planets. The former class comprises Mercury, Venus, the earth,\nand Mars, and the latter Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. I have\nnamed them all in the order of their distance from the sun, beginning\nwith the nearest.\n\nThe terrestrial planets, taking their class name from _terra_, the\nearth, are relatively close to the sun and comparatively small. The\nmajor planets--or the jovian planets, if we give them a common title\nbased upon the name of their chief, Jupiter or Jove--are relatively\ndistant from the sun and are characterized both by great comparative\nsize and slight mean density. The terrestrial planets are all included\nwithin a circle, having the sun for a center, about 140,000,000 miles\nin radius. The space, or gap, between the outermost of them, Mars, and\nthe innermost of the jovian planets, Jupiter, is nearly two and a half\ntimes as broad as the entire radius of the circle within which they are\nincluded. And not only is the jovian group of planets widely separated\nfrom the terrestrial group, but the distances between the orbits of its\nfour members are likewise very great and progressively increasing.\nBetween Jupiter and Saturn is a gap 400,000,000 miles across, and this\nbecomes 900,000,000 miles between Saturn and Uranus, and more than\n1,000,000,000 miles between Uranus and Neptune. All of these distances\nare given in round numbers.\n\nFinally, we come to some very extraordinary worlds--if we can call them\nworlds at all--the asteroids. They form a third group, characterized by\nthe extreme smallness of its individual members, their astonishing\nnumber, and the unusual eccentricities and inclinations of their orbits.\nThey are situated in the gap between the terrestrial and the jovian\nplanets, and about 500 of them have been discovered, while there is\nreason to think that their real number may be many thousands. The\nlargest of them is less than 500 miles in diameter, and many of those\nrecently discovered may be not more than ten or twenty miles in\ndiameter. What marvelous places of abode such little planets would be if\nit were possible to believe them inhabited, we shall see more clearly\nwhen we come to consider them in their turn. But without regard to the\nquestion of habitability, the asteroids will be found extremely\ninteresting.\n\nIn the next chapter we proceed to take up the planets for study as\nindividuals, beginning with Mercury, the one nearest the sun.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nMERCURY, A WORLD OF TWO FACES AND MANY CONTRASTS\n\n\nMercury, the first of the other worlds that we are going to consider,\nfascinates by its grotesqueness, like a piece of Chinese ivory carving,\nso small is it for its kind and so finished in its eccentric details. In\na little while we shall see how singular Mercury is in many of the\nparticulars of planetary existence, but first of all let us endeavor to\nobtain a clear idea of the actual size and mass of this strange little\nplanet. Compared with the earth it is so diminutive that it looks as if\nit had been cut out on the pattern of a satellite rather than that of an\nindependent planet. Its diameter, 3,000 miles, only exceeds the moon's\nby less than one half, while both Jupiter and Saturn, among their\nremarkable collections of moons, have each at least one that is\nconsiderably larger than the planet Mercury. But, insignificant though\nit be in size, it holds the place of honor, nearest to the sun.\n\nIt was formerly thought that Mercury possessed a mass greatly in excess\nof that which its size would seem to imply, and some estimates, based\nupon the apparent effect of its attraction on comets, made it equal in\nmean density to lead, or even to the metal mercury. This led to curious\nspeculations concerning its probable metallic composition, and the\npossible existence of vast quantities of such heavy elements as gold in\nthe frame of the planet. But more recent, and probably more correct,\ncomputations place Mercury third in the order of density among the\nmembers of the solar system, the earth ranking as first and Venus as\nsecond. Mercury's density is now believed to be less than the earth's in\nthe ratio of 85 to 100. Accepting this estimate, we find that the force\nof gravity upon the surface of Mercury is only one third as great as\nupon the surface of the earth--i.e., a body weighing 300 pounds on the\nearth would weigh only 100 pounds on Mercury.\n\nThis is an important matter, because not only the weight of bodies, but\nthe density of the atmosphere and even the nature of its gaseous\nconstituents, are affected by the force of gravity, and if we could\njourney from world to world, in our bodily form, it would make a great\ndifference to us to find gravity considerably greater or less upon other\nplanets than it is upon our own. This alone might suffice to render some\nof the planets impossible places of abode for us, unless a decided\nchange were effected in our present physical organization.\n\nOne of the first questions that we should ask about a foreign world to\nwhich we proposed to pay a visit, would relate to its atmosphere. We\nshould wish to know in advance if it had air and water, and in what\nproportions and quantities. However its own peculiar inhabitants might\nbe supposed able to dispense with these things, to _us_ their presence\nwould be essential, and if we did not find them, even a planet that\nblazed with gold and diamonds only waiting to be seized would remain\nperfectly safe from our invasion. Now, in the case of Mercury, some\ndoubt on this point exists.\n\nMessrs. Huggins, Vogel, and others have believed that they found\nspectroscopic proof of the existence of both air and the vapor of water\non Mercury. But the necessary observations are of a very delicate\nnature, and difficult to make, and some astronomers doubt whether we\npossess sufficient proof that Mercury has an atmosphere. At any rate,\nits atmosphere is very rare as compared with the earth's, but we need\nnot, on that account, conclude that Mercury is lifeless. Possibly, in\nview of certain other peculiarities soon to be explained, a rare\natmosphere would be decidedly advantageous.\n\nBeing much nearer the sun than the earth is, Mercury can be seen by us\nonly in the same quarter of the sky where the sun itself appears. As it\nrevolves in its orbit about the sun it is visible, alternately, in the\nevening for a short time after sunset and in the morning for a short\ntime before sunrise, but it can never be seen, as the outer planets are\nseen, in the mid-heaven or late at night. When seen low in the twilight,\nat evening or morning, it glows with the brilliance of a bright\nfirst-magnitude star, and is a beautiful object, though few casual\nwatchers of the stars ever catch sight of it. When it is nearest the\nearth and is about to pass between the earth and the sun, it temporarily\ndisappears in the glare of the sunlight; and likewise, when it it is\nfarthest from the earth and passing around in its orbit on the opposite\nside of the sun, it is concealed by the blinding solar rays.\nConsequently, except with the instruments of an observatory, which are\nable to show it in broad day, Mercury is never visible save during the\ncomparatively brief periods of time when it is near its greatest\napparent distance east or west from the sun.\n\nThe nearer a planet is to the sun the more rapidly it is compelled to\nmove in its orbit, and Mercury, being the nearest to the sun of all the\nplanets, is by far the swiftest footed among them. But its velocity is\nsubject to remarkable variation, owing to the peculiar form of the orbit\nin which the planet travels. This is more eccentric than the orbit of\nany other planet, except some of the asteroids. The sun being situated\nin one focus of the elliptical orbit, when Mercury is at perihelion, or\nnearest to the sun, its distance from that body is 28,500,000 miles, but\nwhen it is at aphelion, or farthest from the sun, its distance is\n43,500,000 miles. The difference is no less than 14,000,000 miles! When\nnearest the sun Mercury darts forward in its orbit at the rate of\ntwenty-nine miles in a second, while when farthest from the sun the\nspeed is reduced to twenty-three miles.\n\nNow, let us return for a moment to the consideration of the wonderful\nvariations in Mercury's distance from the sun, for we shall find that\ntheir effects are absolutely startling, and that they alone suffice to\nmark a wide difference between Mercury and the earth, considered as the\nabodes of sentient creatures. The total change of distance amounts, as\nalready remarked, to 14,000,000 miles, which is almost half the entire\ndistance separating the planet from the sun at perihelion. This immense\nvariation of distance is emphasized by the rapidity with which it takes\nplace. Mercury's periodic time, i.e., the period required for it to make\na single revolution about the sun--or, in other words, the length of its\nyear--is eighty-eight of our days. In just one half of that time, or in\nabout six weeks, it passes from aphelion to perihelion; that is to say,\nin six weeks the whole change in its distance from the sun takes place.\nIn six weeks Mercury falls 14,000,000 miles--for it _is_ a fall, though\nin a curve instead of a straight line--falls 14,000,000 miles toward the\nsun! And, as it falls, like any other falling body it gains in speed,\nuntil, having reached the perihelion point, its terrific velocity\ncounteracts its approach and it begins to recede. At the end of the next\nsix weeks it once more attains its greatest distance, and turns again to\nplunge sunward.\n\nOf course it may be said of every planet having an elliptical orbit\nthat between aphelion and perihelion it is falling toward the sun, but\nno other planet than Mercury travels in an orbit sufficiently eccentric,\nand approaches sufficiently near to the sun, to give to the mind so\nvivid an impression of an actual, stupendous fall!\n\nNext let us consider the effects of this rapid fall, or approach, toward\nthe sun, which is so foreign to our terrestrial experience, and so\nappalling to the imagination.\n\nFirst, we must remember that the nearer a planet is to the sun the\ngreater is the amount of heat and light that it receives, the variation\nbeing proportional to the inverse square of the distance. The earth's\ndistance from the sun being 93,000,000 miles, while Mercury's is only\n36,000,000, it follows, to begin with, that Mercury gets, on the\naverage, more than six and a half times as much heat from the sun as the\nearth does. That alone is enough to make it seem impossible that Mercury\ncan be the home of living forms resembling those of the earth, for\nimagine the heat of the sun in the middle of a summer's day increased\nsix or seven fold! If there were no mitigating influences, the face of\nthe earth would shrivel as in the blast of a furnace, the very stones\nwould become incandescent, and the oceans would turn into steam.\n\nStill, notwithstanding the tremendous heat poured upon Mercury as\ncompared with that which our planet receives, we can possibly, and for\nthe sake of a clearer understanding of the effects of the varying\ndistance, which is the object of our present inquiry, find a loophole to\nadmit the chance that yet there may be living beings there. We might,\nfor instance, suppose that, owing to the rarity of its atmosphere, the\nexcessive heat was quickly radiated away, or that there was something in\nthe constitution of the atmosphere that greatly modified the effective\ntemperature of the sun's rays. But, having satisfied our imagination on\nthis point, and placed our supposititious inhabitants in the hot world\nof Mercury, how are we going to meet the conditions imposed by the\nrapid changes of distance--the swift fall of the planet toward the sun,\nfollowed by the equally swift rush away from it? For change of distance\nimplies change of heat and temperature.\n\nIt is true that we have a slight effect of this kind on the earth.\nBetween midsummer (of the northern hemisphere) and midwinter our planet\ndraws 3,000,000 miles nearer the sun, but the change occupies six\nmonths, and, at the earth's great average distance, the effect of this\nchange is too slight to be ordinarily observable, and only the\nastronomer is aware of the consequent increase in the apparent size of\nthe sun. It is not to this variation of the sun's distance, but rather\nto the changes of the seasons, depending on the inclination of the\nearth's axis, that we owe the differences of temperature that we\nexperience. In other words, the total supply of heat from the sun is not\nfar from uniform at all times of the year, and the variations of\ntemperature depend upon the distribution of that supply between the\nnorthern and southern hemispheres, which are alternately inclined\nsunward.\n\nBut on Mercury the supply of solar heat is itself variable to an\nenormous extent. In six weeks, as we have seen, Mercury diminishes its\ndistance from the sun about one third, which is proportionally ten times\nas great a change of distance as the earth experiences in six months.\nThe inhabitants of Mercury in those six pregnant weeks see the sun\nexpand in the sky to more than two and a half times its former\nmagnitude, while the solar heat poured upon them swiftly augments from\nsomething more than four and a half times to above eleven times the\namount received upon the earth! Then, immediately, the retreat of the\nplanet begins, the sun visibly shrinks, as a receding balloon becomes\nsmaller in the eyes of its watchers, the heat falls off as rapidly as it\nhad previously increased, until, the aphelion point being reached, the\nprocess is again reversed. And thus it goes on unceasingly, the sun\ngrowing and diminishing in the sky, and the heat increasing and\ndecreasing by enormous amounts with astonishing rapidity. It is\ndifficult to imagine any way in which atmospheric influences could\nequalize the effects of such violent changes, or any adjustments in the\nphysical organization of living beings that could make such changes\nendurable.\n\nBut we have only just begun the story of Mercury's peculiarities. We\ncome next to an even more remarkable contrast between that planet and\nour own. During the Paris Exposition of 1889 a little company of\nastronomers was assembled at the Juvisy observatory of M. Flammarion,\nnear the French capital, listening to one of the most surprising\ndisclosures of a secret of nature that any _savant_ ever confided to a\nfew trustworthy friends while awaiting a suitable time to make it\npublic. It was a secret as full of significance as that which Galileo\nconcealed for a time in his celebrated anagram, which, when at length he\nfurnished the key, still remained a riddle, for then it read: \"The\nMother of the Loves imitates the Shapes of Cynthia,\" meaning that the\nplanet Venus, when viewed with a telescope, shows phases like those of\nthe moon. The secret imparted in confidence to the knot of astronomers\nat Juvisy came from a countryman of Galileo's, Signor G. V.\nSchiaparelli, the Director of the Observatory of Milan, and its purport\nwas that the planet Mercury always keeps the same face directed toward\nthe sun. Schiaparelli had satisfied himself, by a careful series of\nobservations, of the truth of his strange announcement, but before\ngiving it to the world he determined to make doubly sure. Early in 1890\nhe withdrew the pledge of secrecy from his friends and published his\ndiscovery.\n\nNo one can wonder that the statement was generally received with\nincredulity, for it was in direct contradiction to the conclusions of\nother astronomers, who had long believed that Mercury rotated on its\naxis in a period closely corresponding with that of the earth's\nrotation--that is to say, once every twenty-four hours. Schiaparelli's\ndiscovery, if it were received as correct, would put Mercury, as a\nplanet, in a class by itself, and would distinguish it by a peculiarity\nwhich had always been recognized as a special feature of the moon, viz.,\nthat of rotating on its axis in the same period of time required to\nperform a revolution in its orbit, and, while this seemed natural enough\nfor a satellite, almost nobody was prepared for the ascription of such\neccentric conduct to a planet.\n\nThe Italian astronomer based his discovery upon the observation that\ncertain markings visible on the disk of Mercury remained in such a\nposition with reference to the direction of the sun as to prove that the\nplanet's rotation was extremely slow, and he finally satisfied himself\nthat there was but one rotation in the course of a revolution about the\nsun. That, of course, means that one side of Mercury always faces toward\nthe sun while the opposite side always faces away from it, and neither\nside experiences the alternation of day and night, one having perpetual\nday and the other perpetual night. The older observations, from which\nhad been deduced the long accepted opinion that Mercury rotated, like\nthe earth, once in about twenty-four hours, had also been made upon the\nmarkings on the planet's disk, but these are not easily seen, and their\nappearances had evidently been misinterpreted.\n\nThe very fact of the difficulty of seeing any details on Mercury tended\nto prevent or delay corroboration of Schiaparelli's discovery. But there\nwere two circumstances that contributed to the final acceptance of his\nresults. One of these was his well-known experience as an observer and\nthe high reputation that he enjoyed among astronomers, and the other was\nthe development by Prof. George Darwin of the theory of tidal friction\nin its application to planetary evolution, for this furnished a\nsatisfactory explanation of the manner in which a body, situated as near\nthe sun as Mercury is, could have its axial rotation gradually reduced\nby the tidal attraction of the sun until it coincided in period with its\norbital revolution.\n\nAccepting the accuracy of Schiaparelli's discovery, which was\ncorroborated in every particular in 1896 by Percival Lowell in a special\nseries of observations on Mercury made with his 24-inch telescope at\nFlagstaff, Arizona, and which has also been corroborated by others, we\nsee at once how important is its bearing on the habitability of the\nplanet. It adds another difficulty to that offered by the remarkable\nchanges of distance from the sun, and consequent variations of heat,\nwhich we have already discussed. In order to bring the situation home to\nour experience, let us, for a moment, imagine the earth fallen into\nMercury's dilemma. There would then be no succession of day and night,\nsuch as we at present enjoy, and upon which not alone our comfort but\nperhaps our very existence depends, but, instead, one side of our\nglobe--it might be the Asiatic or the American half--would be\ncontinually in the sunlight, and the other side would lie buried in\nendless night. And this condition, so suggestive of the play of pure\nimagination, this plight of being a two-faced world, like the god\nJanus, one face light and the other face dark, must be the actual state\nof things on Mercury.\n\nThere is one interesting qualification. In the case just imagined for\nthe earth, supposing it to retain the present inclination of its axis\nwhile parting with its differential rotation, there would be an\ninterchange of day and night once a year in the polar regions. On\nMercury, whose axis appears to be perpendicular, a similar phenomenon,\naffecting not the polar regions but the eastern and western sides of the\nplanet, is produced by the extraordinary eccentricity of its orbit. As\nthe planet alternately approaches and recedes from the sun its orbital\nvelocity, as we have already remarked, varies between the limits of\ntwenty-three and thirty-five miles per second, being most rapid at the\npoint nearest the sun. But this variation in the speed of its revolution\nabout the sun does not, in any manner, affect the rate of rotation on\nits axis. The latter is perfectly uniform and just fast enough to\ncomplete one axial turn in the course of a single revolution about the\nsun. The accompanying figure may assist the explanation.\n\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM SHOWING THAT, OWING TO THE ECCENTRICITY OF ITS\nORBIT, AND ITS VARYING VELOCITY, MERCURY, ALTHOUGH MAKING BUT ONE TURN\nON ITS AXIS IN THE COURSE OF A REVOLUTION ABOUT THE SUN, NEVERTHELESS\nEXPERIENCES ON PARTS OF ITS SURFACE THE ALTERNATION OF DAY AND NIGHT.]\n\nLet us start with Mercury in perihelion at the point _A_. The little\ncross on the planet stands exactly under the sun and in the center of\nthe illuminated hemisphere. The large arrows show the direction in which\nthe planet travels in its revolution about the sun, and the small curved\narrows the direction in which it rotates on its axis. Now, in moving\nalong its orbit from _A_ to _B_ the planet, partly because of its\nswifter motion when near the sun, and partly because of the elliptical\nnature of the orbit, traverses a greater angular interval with reference\nto the sun than the cross, moving with the uniform rotation of the\nplanet on its axis, is able to traverse in the same time. As drawn in\nthe diagram, the cross has moved through exactly ninety degrees, or one\nright angle, while the planet in its orbit has moved through\nconsiderably more than a right angle. In consequence of this gain of the\nangle of revolution upon the angle of rotation, the cross at _B_ is no\nlonger exactly under the sun, nor in the center of the illuminated\nhemisphere. It appears to have shifted its position toward the west,\nwhile the hemispherical cap of sunshine has slipped eastward over the\nglobe of the planet.\n\nIn the next following section of the orbit the planet rotates through\nanother right angle, but, owing to increased distance from the sun, the\nmotion in the orbit now becomes slower until, when the planet arrives at\naphelion, _C_, the angular difference disappears and the cross is once\nmore just under the sun. On returning from aphelion to perihelion the\nsame phenomena recur in reverse order and the line between day and night\non the planet first shifts westward, attaining its limit in that respect\nat _D_, and then, at perihelion, returns to its original position.\n\nNow, if we could stand on the sunward hemisphere of Mercury what, to our\neyes, would be the effect of this shifting of the sun's position with\nregard to a fixed point on the planet's surface? Manifestly it would\ncause the sun to describe a great arc in the sky, swinging to and fro,\nin an east and west line, like a pendulum bob, the angular extent of the\nswing being a little more than forty-seven degrees, and the time\nrequired for the sun to pass from its extreme eastern to its extreme\nwestern position and back again being eighty-eight days. But, owing to\nthe eccentricity of the orbit, the sun swings much faster toward the\neast than toward the west, the eastward motion occupying about\nthirty-seven days and the westward motion about fifty-one days.\n\n[Illustration: THE REGIONS OF PERPETUAL DAY, PERPETUAL NIGHT, AND\nALTERNATE DAY AND NIGHT ON MERCURY. IN THE LEFT-HAND VIEW THE OBSERVER\nLOOKS AT THE PLANET IN THE PLANE OF ITS EQUATOR; IN THE RIGHT-HAND VIEW\nHE LOOKS DOWN ON ITS NORTH POLE.]\n\nAnother effect of the libratory motion of the sun as seen from Mercury\nis represented in the next figure, where we have a view of the planet\nshowing both the day and the night hemisphere, and where we see that\nbetween the two there is a region upon which the sun rises and sets once\nevery eighty-eight days. There are, in reality, two of these lune-shaped\nregions, one at the east and the other at the west, each between 1,200\nand 1,300 miles broad at the equator. At the sunward edge of these\nregions, once in eighty-eight days, or once in a Mercurial year, the sun\nrises to an elevation of forty-seven degrees, and then descends again\nstraight to the horizon from which it rose; at the nightward edge, once\nin eighty-eight days, the sun peeps above the horizon and quickly sinks\nfrom sight again. The result is that, neglecting the effects of\natmospheric refraction, which would tend to expand the borders of the\ndomain of sunlight, about one quarter of the entire surface of Mercury\nis, with regard to day and night, in a condition resembling that of our\npolar regions, where there is but one day and one night in the course of\na year--and on Mercury a year is eighty-eight days. One half of the\nremaining three quarters of the planet's surface is bathed in perpetual\nsunshine and the other half is a region of eternal night.\n\nAnd now again, what of life in such a world as that? On the night side,\nwhere no sunshine ever penetrates, the temperature must be extremely\nlow, hardly greater than the fearful cold of open space, unless\nmodifying influences beyond our ken exist. It is certain that if life\nflourishes there, it must be in such forms as can endure continual\ndarkness and excessive cold. Some heat would be carried around by\natmospheric circulation from the sunward side, but not enough, it would\nseem, to keep water from being perpetually frozen, or the ground from\nbeing baked with unrelaxing frost. It is for the imagination to picture\nunderground dwellings, artificial sources of heat, and living forms\nsuited to unearthlike environment.\n\nWhat would be the mental effects of perpetual night upon a race of\nintelligent creatures doomed to that condition? Perhaps not quite so\ngrievous as we are apt to think. The constellations in all their\nsplendor would circle before their eyes with the revolution of their\nplanet about the sun, and with the exception of the sun itself--which\nthey could see by making a journey to the opposite hemisphere--all the\nmembers of the solar system would pass in succession through their\nmid-heaven, and two of them would present themselves with a magnificence\nof planetary display unknown on the earth. Venus, when in opposition\nunder the most favorable circumstances, is scarcely more than 24,000,000\nmiles from Mercury, and, showing herself at such times with a fully\nilluminated disk--as, owing to her position within the orbit of the\nearth, she never can do when at her least distance from us--she must be\na phenomenon of unparalleled beauty, at least four times brighter than\nwe ever see her, and capable, of course, of casting a strong shadow.\n\nThe earth, also, is a splendid star in the midnight sky of Mercury, and\nthe moon may be visible to the naked eye as a little attendant circling\nabout its brilliant master. The outer planets are slightly less\nconspicuous than they are to us, owing to increase of distance.\n\nThe revolution of the heavens as seen from the night side of Mercury is\nquite different in period from that which we are accustomed to, although\nthe apparent motion is in the same direction, viz., from east to west.\nThe same constellations remain above the horizon for weeks at a time,\nslowly moving westward, with the planets drifting yet more slowly, but\nat different rates, among them; the nearer planets, Venus and the earth,\nshowing the most decided tendency to loiter behind the stars.\n\nOn the side where eternal sunlight shines the sky of Mercury contains no\nstars. Forever the pitiless blaze of day; forever,\n\n    \"All in a hot and copper sky\n    The bloody sun at noon.\"\n\nAs it is difficult to understand how water can exist on the night\nhemisphere, except in the shape of perpetual snow and ice, so it is\nhard to imagine that on the day hemisphere water can ever be\nprecipitated from the vaporous form. In truth, there can be very little\nwater on Mercury even in the form of vapor, else the spectroscope would\nhave given unquestionable evidence of its presence. Those who think that\nMercury is entirely waterless and almost, if not quite, airless may be\nright. In these respects it would then resemble the moon, and, according\nto some observers, it possesses another characteristic lunar feature in\nthe roughening of its surface by what seem to be innumerable volcanic\ncraters.\n\nBut if we suppose Mercury to possess an atmosphere much rarer than that\nof the earth, we may perceive therein a possible provision against the\nexcessive solar heat to which it is subjected, since, as we see on high\nmountains, a light air permits a ready radiation of heat, which does not\nbecome stored up as in a denser atmosphere.\n\nAs the sun pours its heat without cessation upon the day hemisphere the\nwarmed air must rise and flow off on all sides into the night\nhemisphere, while cold air rushes in below, to take its place, from the\nregion of frost and darkness. The intermediate areas, which see the sun\npart of the time, as explained above, are perhaps the scene of\ncontending winds and tempests, where the moisture, if there be any, is\nprecipitated, through the rapid cooling of the air, in whelming floods\nand wild snow-storms driven by hurrying blasts from the realm of endless\nnight.\n\nEnough seems now to have been said to indicate clearly the hopelessness\nof looking for any analogies between Mercury and the earth which would\nwarrant the conclusion that the former planet is capable of supporting\ninhabitants or forms of life resembling those that swarm upon the\nlatter. If we would still believe that Mercury is a habitable globe we\nmust depend entirely upon the imagination for pictures of creatures able\nto endure its extremes of heat and cold, of light and darkness, of\ninstability, swift vicissitude, and violent contrast.\n\nIn the next chapter we shall study a more peaceful and even-going world,\nyet one of great brilliancy, which possesses some remarkable\nresemblances to the earth, as well as some surprising divergences from\nit.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nVENUS, THE TWIN OF THE EARTH\n\n\nWe come now to a planet which seems, at the first glance, to afford a\nfar more promising outlook than Mercury does for the presence of organic\nlife forms bearing some resemblance to those of the earth. One of the\nstrongest arguments for regarding Venus as a world much like ours is\nbased upon its remarkable similarity to the earth in size and mass,\nbecause thus we are assured that the force of gravity is practically the\nsame upon the two planets, and the force of gravity governs numberless\nphysical phenomena of essential importance to both animal and vegetable\nlife. The mean diameter of the earth is 7,918 miles; that of Venus is\n7,700 miles. The difference is so slight that if the two planets were\nsuspended side by side in the sky, at such a distance that their disks\nresembled that of the full moon, the eye would notice no inequality\nbetween them.\n\nThe mean density of Venus is about nine tenths of that of the earth, and\nthe force of gravity upon its surface is in the ratio of about 85 to 100\nas compared to its force on the surface of the earth. A man removed to\nVenus would, consequently, find himself perceptibly lighter than he was\nat home, and would be able to exert his strength with considerably\ngreater effect than on his own planet. But the difference would amount\nonly to an agreeable variation from accustomed conditions, and would not\nbe productive of fundamental changes in the order of nature.\n\nBeing, like Mercury, nearer to the sun than the earth is, Venus also is\nvisible to us only in the morning or the evening sky. But her distance\nfrom the sun, slightly exceeding 67,000,000 miles, is nearly double that\nof Mercury, so that, when favorably situated, she becomes a very\nconspicuous object, and, instead of being known almost exclusively by\nastronomers, she is, perhaps, the most popular and most admired of all\nthe members of the planetary system, especially when she appears in the\ncharming r\u00f4le of the \"evening star.\" As she emerges periodically from\nthe blinding glare of the sun's immediate neighborhood and begins to\nsoar, bright as an electric balloon, in the twilight, she commands all\neyes and calls forth exclamations of astonishment and admiration by her\nsingular beauty. The intervals between her successive reappearances in\nthe evening sky, measured by her synodic period of 584 days, are\nsufficiently long to give an element of surprise and novelty to every\nreturn of so dazzling a phenomenon.\n\nEven the light of the full moon silvering the tree tops does not\nexercise greater enchantment over the mind of the contemplative\nobserver. In either of her r\u00f4les, as morning or as evening star, Venus\nhas no rival. No fixed star can for an instant bear comparison with her.\nWhat she lacks in vivacity of light--none of the planets twinkles, as do\nall of the true stars--is more than compensated by the imposing size of\nher gleaming disk and the striking beauty of her clear lamplike rays.\nHer color is silvery or golden, according to the state of the\natmosphere, while the distinction of her appearance in a dark sky is so\ngreat that no eye can resist its attraction, and I have known an\nunexpected glimpse of Venus to put an end to an animated conversation\nand distract, for a long time, the attention of a party of ladies and\ngentlemen from the social occupation that had brought them together.\n\nAs a telescopic object Venus is exceedingly attractive, even when\nconsidered merely from the point of view of simple beauty. Both Mercury\nand Venus, as they travel about the sun, exhibit phases like those of\nthe moon, but Venus, being much larger and much nearer to the earth than\nMercury, shows her successive phases more effectively, and when she\nshines as a thin crescent in the morning or evening twilight, only a\nvery slight magnifying power is required to show the sickle form of her\ndisk.\n\nA remarkable difference between Venus and Mercury comes out as soon as\nwe examine the shape of the former's orbit. Venus's mean distance from\nthe sun is 67,200,000 miles, and her orbit is so nearly a circle, much\nmore nearly than that of any other planet, that in the course of a\nrevolution her distance from the sun varies less than a million miles.\nThe distance of the earth varies 3,000,000 miles, and that of Mercury\n14,000,000. Her period of revolution, or the length of her year, is 225\nof our days. When she comes between the sun and the earth she approaches\nus nearer than any other planet ever gets, except the asteroid Eros, her\ndistance at such times being 26,000,000 miles, or about one hundred and\nten times the distance of the moon.\n\nBeing nearer to the sun in the ratio of 67 to 93, Venus receives almost\ntwice as much solar light and heat as we get, but less than one third as\nmuch as Mercury gets. There is reason to believe that her axis, instead\nof being considerably inclined, like that of the earth, is perpendicular\nto the plane of her orbit. Thus Venus introduces to us another novelty\nin the economy of worlds, for with a perpendicular axis of rotation she\ncan have no succession of seasons, no winter and summer flitting, one\nupon the other's heels, to and fro between the northern and southern\nhemispheres; but, on the contrary, her climatic conditions must be\nunchangeable, and, on any particular part of her surface, except for\nlocal causes of variation, the weather remains the same the year around.\nSo, as far as temperature is concerned, Venus may have two regions of\nperpetual winter, one around each pole; two belts of perpetual spring in\nthe upper middle latitudes, one on each side of the equator; and one\nzone of perpetual summer occupying the equatorial portion of the planet.\nBut, of course, these seasonal terms do not strictly apply to Venus, in\nthe sense in which we employ them on the earth, for with us spring is\ncharacterized rather by the change in the quantity of heat and other\natmospheric conditions that it witnesses than by a certain fixed and\ninvariable temperature.\n\nTo some minds it may appear very undesirable, from the point of view of\nanimate existences, that there should be no alternation of seasons on\nthe surface of a planet, but, instead, fixed conditions of climate; yet\nit is not clear that such a state of affairs might not be preferable to\nthat with which we are familiar. Even on the earth, we find that\ntropical regions, where the seasonal changes are comparatively moderate,\npresent many attractions and advantages in contrast with the violent and\noften destructive vicissitudes of the temperate zones, and nature has\nshown us, within the pale of our own planet, that she is capable of\nbringing forth harvests of fruit and grain without the stimulus of\nalternate frost and sunshine.\n\nEven under the reign of perpetual summer the fields and trees find time\nand opportunity to rest and restore their productive forces.\n\nThe circularity of Venus's orbit, and the consequently insignificant\nchange in the sun's distance and heating effect, are other elements to\nbe considered in estimating the singular constancy in the operation of\nnatural agencies upon that interesting planet, which, twin of the earth\nthough it be in stature, is evidently not its twin in temperament.\n\nAnd next as to the all-important question of atmosphere. In what\nprecedes, the presence of an atmosphere has been assumed, and,\nfortunately, there is very convincing evidence, both visual and\nspectroscopic, that Venus is well and abundantly supplied with air, by\nwhich it is not meant that Venus's air is precisely like the mixture of\noxygen and nitrogen, with a few other gases, which we breathe and call\nby that name. In fact, there are excellent reasons for thinking that the\natmosphere of Venus differs from the earth's quite as much as some of\nher other characteristics differ from those of our planet. But, however\nit may vary from ours in constitution, the atmosphere of Venus contains\nwater vapor, and is exceedingly abundant. Listen to Professor Young:\n\n\"Its [Venus's] atmosphere is probably from one and a half to two times\nas extensive and as dense as our own, and the spectroscope shows\nevidence of the presence of water vapor in it.\"\n\nAnd Prof. William C. Pickering, basing his statement on the result of\nobservations at the mountain observatory of Arequipa, says: \"We may feel\nreasonably certain that at the planet's [Venus's] surface the density of\nits atmosphere is many times that of our own.\"\n\nWe do not have to depend upon the spectroscope for evidence that Venus\nhas a dense atmosphere, for we can, in a manner, _see_ her atmosphere,\nin consequence of its refractive action upon the sunlight that strikes\ninto it near the edge of the planet's globe. This illumination of\nVenus's atmosphere is witnessed both when she is nearly between the sun\nand the earth, and when, being exactly between them, she appears in\nsilhouette against the solar disk. During a transit of this kind, in\n1882, many observers, and the present writer was one, saw a bright\natmospheric bow edging a part of the circumference of Venus when the\nplanet was moving upon the face of the sun--a most beautiful and\nimpressive spectacle.\n\nEven more curious is an observation made in 1866 by Prof. C.S. Lyman, of\nYale College, who, when Venus was very near the sun, saw her atmosphere\n_in the form of a luminous ring_. A little fuller explanation of this\nappearance may be of interest.\n\nWhen approaching inferior conjunction--i.e., passing between the earth\nand sun--Venus appears, with a telescope, in the shape of a very thin\ncrescent. Professor Lyman watched this crescent, becoming narrower day\nafter day as it approached the sun, and noticed that its extremities\ngradually extended themselves beyond the limits of a semicircle, bending\nto meet one another on the opposite side of the invisible disk of the\nplanet, until, at length, they did meet, and he beheld a complete ring\nof silvery light, all that remained visible of the planet Venus! The\nring was, of course, the illuminated atmosphere of the planet refracting\nthe sunlight on all sides around the opaque globe.\n\nIn 1874 M. Flammarion witnessed the same phenomenon in similar\ncircumstances. One may well envy those who have had the good fortune to\nbehold this spectacle--to actually see, as it were, the air that the\ninhabitants of another world are breathing and making resonant with all\nthe multitudinous sounds and voices that accompany intelligent life. But\nperhaps some readers will prefer to think that even though an atmosphere\nis there, there is no one to breathe it.\n\n[Illustration: VENUS'S ATMOSPHERE SEEN AS A RING OF LIGHT.]\n\nAs the visibility of Venus's atmosphere is unparalleled elsewhere in the\nsolar system, it may be worth while to give a graphic illustration of\nit. In the accompanying figure the planet is represented at three\nsuccessive points in its advance toward inferior conjunction. As it\napproaches conjunction it slowly draws nearer the earth, and its\napparent diameter consequently increases. At _A_ a large part of the\nluminous crescent is composed of the planet's surface reflecting the\nsunshine; at _B_ the ratio of the reflecting surface to the illuminated\natmosphere has diminished, and the latter has extended, like the curved\narms of a pair of calipers, far around the unilluminated side of the\ndisk; at _C_ the atmosphere is illuminated all around by the sunlight\ncoming through it from behind, while the surface of the planet has\npassed entirely out of the light--that is to say, Venus has become an\ninvisible globe embraced by a circle of refracted sunshine.\n\nWe return to the question of life. With almost twice as much solar heat\nand light as we have, and with a deeper and denser atmosphere than ours,\nit is evident, without seeking other causes of variation, that the\nconditions of life upon Venus are notably different from those with\nwhich we are acquainted. At first sight it would seem that a dense\natmosphere, together with a more copious supply of heat, might render\nthe surface temperature of Venus unsuitable for organic life as we\nunderstand it. But so much depends upon the precise composition of the\natmosphere and upon the relative quantities of its constituents, that it\nwill not do to pronounce a positive judgment in such a case, because we\nlack information on too many essential points.\n\nExperiment has shown that the temperature of the air varies with changes\nin the amount of carbonic acid and of water vapor that it contains. It\nhas been suggested that in past geologic ages the earth's atmosphere was\ndenser and more heavily charged with vapors than it is at present; yet\neven then forms of life suited to their environment existed, and from\nthose forms the present inhabitants of our globe have been developed.\nThere are several lines of reasoning which may be followed to the\nconclusion that Venus, as a life-bearing world, is younger than the\nearth, and, according to that view, we are at liberty to imagine our\nbeautiful sister planet as now passing through some such period in its\nhistory as that at which the earth had arrived in the age of the\ncarboniferous forests, or the age of the gigantic reptiles who ruled\nboth land and sea.\n\nBut, without making any assumptions as to the phase of evolution which\nlife may have attained on Venus, it is also possible to think that the\nplanet's thick shell of air, with its abundant vapors, may serve as a\nshield against the excessive solar radiation. Venus is extraordinarily\nbrilliant, its reflective power being greatly in excess of Mercury's,\nand it has often been suggested that this may be due to the fact that a\nlarge share of the sunlight falling upon it is turned back before\nreaching the planet's surface, being reflected both from the atmosphere\nitself and from vast layers of clouds.\n\nEven when viewed with the most powerful telescopes and in the most\nfavoring circumstances, the features of Venus's surface are difficult\nto see, and generally extremely difficult. They consist of faint shadowy\nmarkings, indefinite in outline, and so close to the limit of visibility\nthat great uncertainty exists not only as to their shape and their\nprecise location upon the planet, but even as to their actual existence.\nNo two observers have represented them exactly alike in drawings of the\nplanet, and, unfortunately, photography is as yet utterly unable to deal\nwith them. Mr. Percival Lowell, in his special studies of Venus in 1896,\nusing a 24-inch telescope of great excellence, in the clear and steady\nair of Arizona, found delicate spokelike streaks radiating from a\nrounded spot like a hub, and all of which, in his opinion, were genuine\nand definite markings on the planet's surface. But others, using larger\ntelescopes, have failed to perceive the shapes and details depicted by\nMr. Lowell, and some are disposed to ascribe their appearances to\nVenus's atmosphere. Mr. Lowell himself noticed that the markings seemed\nto have a kind of obscuring veil over them.\n\nIn short, all observers of Venus agree in thinking that her atmosphere,\nto a greater or less extent, serves as a mask to conceal her real\nfeatures, and the possibilities of so extensive an atmosphere with\nreference to an adjustment of the peculiar conditions of the planet to\nthe requirements of life upon it, are almost unlimited. If we could\naccurately analyze that atmosphere we would have a basis for more exact\nconclusions concerning Venus's habitability.\n\nBut the mere existence of the atmosphere is, in itself, a strong\nargument for the habitability of the planet, and as to the temperature,\nwe are really not compelled to imagine special adaptations by means of\nwhich it may be brought into accord with that prevailing upon the earth.\nAs long as the temperature does not rise to the _destructive_ point,\nbeyond which our experience teaches that no organic life can exist, it\nmay very well attain an elevation that would mean extreme discomfort\nfrom our point of view, without precluding the existence of life even in\nits terrestrial sense.\n\nAnd would it not be unreasonable to assume that vital phenomena on other\nplanets must be subject to exactly the same limitations that we find\ncircumscribing them in our world? That kind of assumption has more than\nonce led us far astray even in dealing with terrestrial conditions.\n\nIt is not so long ago, for instance, since life in the depths of the sea\nwas deemed to be demonstrably impossible. The bottom of the ocean, we\nwere assured, was a region of eternal darkness and of frightful\npressure, wherein no living creatures could exist. Yet the first dip of\nthe deep-sea trawl brought up animals of marvelous delicacy of\norganization, which, although curiously and wonderfully adapted to live\nin a compressed liquid, collapsed when lifted into a lighter medium, and\nwhich, despite the assumed perpetual darkness of their profound abode,\nwere adorned with variegated colors and furnished with organs of\nphosphorescence whereby they could create for themselves all the light\nthey needed.\n\nEven the fixed animals of the sea, growing, like plants, fast to the\nrocks, are frequently vivid with living light, and there is a splendid\nsuggestion of nature's powers of adaptation, which may not be entirely\ninapplicable to the problems of life on strange planets, in Alexander\nAgassiz's statement that species of sea animals, living below the depths\nto which sunlight penetrates, \"may dwell in total darkness and be\nilluminated at times merely by the movements of abyssal fishes through\nthe forests of phosphorescent alcyonarians.\"\n\nIn attempting to judge the habitability of a planet such as Venus we\nmust first, as far as possible, generalize the conditions that govern\nlife and restrict its boundaries.\n\nOn the earth we find animated existence confined to the surface of the\ncrust of the globe, to the lower and denser strata of the atmosphere,\nand to the film of water that constitutes the oceans. It does not exist\nin the heart of the rocks forming the body of the planet nor in the void\nof space surrounding it outside the atmosphere. As the earth condensed\nfrom the original nebula, and cooled and solidified, a certain quantity\nof matter remained at its surface in the form of free gases and unstable\ncompounds, and, within the narrow precincts where these things were,\nlying like a thin shell between the huge inert globe of permanently\ncombined elements below, and the equally unchanging realm of the ether\nabove, life, a phenomenon depending upon ceaseless changes, combinations\nand recombinations of chemical elements in unstable and temporary union,\nmade its appearance, and there only we find it at the present time.\n\nIt is because air and water furnish the means for the continual\ntransformations by which the bodies of animals and plants are built up\nand afterward disintegrated and dispersed, that we are compelled to\nregard their presence as prerequisites to the existence, on any planet,\nof life in any of the forms in which we are acquainted with it. But if\nwe perceive that another world has an atmosphere, and that there is\nwater vapor in its atmosphere--both of which conditions are fulfilled by\nVenus--and if we find that that world is bathed in the same sunshine\nthat stimulates the living forces of our planet, even though its\nquantity or intensity may be different, then it would seem that we are\njustified in averring that the burden of proof rests upon those who\nwould deny the capability of such a world to support inhabitants.\n\nThe generally accepted hypothesis of the origin of the solar system\nleads us to believe that Venus has experienced the same process of\nevolution as that which brought the earth into its present condition,\nand we may fairly argue that upon the rocky shell of Venus exists a\nregion where chemical combinations and recombinations like those on the\nsurface of the earth are taking place. It is surely not essential that\nthe life-forming elements should exist in exactly the same states and\nproportions as upon the earth; it is enough if some of them are\nmanifestly present. Even on the earth these things have undergone much\nvariation in the course of geological history, coincidently with the\ndevelopment of various species of life. Just at present the earth\nappears to have reached a stage where everything contributes to the\nmaintenance of a very high organization in both the animal and vegetable\nkingdoms.\n\nSo each planet that has attained the habitable stage may have a typical\nadjustment of temperature and atmospheric constitution, rendering life\npossible within certain limits peculiar to that planet, and to the\nspecial conditions prevailing there. Admitting, as there is reason for\ndoing, that different planets may be at different stages of development\nin the geological and biological sense, we should, of course, not expect\nto find them inhabited by the same living species. And, since there is\nalso reason to believe that no two planets upon arriving at the same\nstage of evolution as globes would possess identical gaseous\nsurroundings, there would naturally be differences between their organic\nlife forms notwithstanding the similarity of their common phase of\ndevelopment in other respects. Thus a departure from the terrestrial\ntype in the envelope of gases covering a planet, instead of precluding\nlife, would only tend to vary its manifestations.\n\nAfter all, why should the intensity of the solar radiation upon Venus be\nregarded as inimical to life? The sunbeams awaken life.\n\nIt is not impossible that relative nearness to the sun may be an\nadvantage to Venus from the biologic point of view. She gets less than\none third as much heat as Mercury receives on the average, and she gets\nit with almost absolute uniformity. At aphelion Mercury is about two and\nfour tenths times hotter than Venus; then it rushes sunward, and within\nforty-four days becomes six times hotter than Venus. In the meantime the\ntemperature of the latter, while high as compared with the earth's,\nremains practically unchanged. Not only may Mercury's temperature reach\nthe destructive point, and thus be too high for organic life, but\nMercury gets nothing with either moderation or constancy. It is a world\nboth of excessive heat and of violent contrasts of temperature. Venus,\non the other hand, presents an unparalleled instance of invariableness\nand uniformity. She may well be called the favorite of the sun, and,\nthrough the advantages of her situation, may be stimulated by him to\nmore intense vitality than falls to the lot of the earth.\n\nIt is open, at least to the writers of the interplanetary romances now\nso popular, to imagine that on Venus, life, while encompassed with the\nserenity that results from the circular form of her orbit, and the\nunchangeableness of her climates, is richer, warmer, more passionate,\nmore exquisite in its forms and more fascinating in its experiences,\nkeener of sense, capable of more delicious joys, than is possible to it\namid the manifold inclemencies of the colder earth.\n\nWe have seen that there is excellent authority for saying that Venus's\natmosphere is from one and a half to two times as dense and as extensive\nas ours. Here is an interesting suggestion of aerial possibilities for\nher inhabitants. If man could but fly, how would he take to himself\nwings and widen his horizons along with the birds! Give him an\natmosphere the double in density of that which now envelopes him, take\noff a little of his weight, thereby increasing the ratio of his strength\nand activity, put into his nervous system a more puissant stimulus from\nthe life-giving sun, and perchance he _would_ fly.\n\nWell, on Venus, apparently, these very conditions actually exist. How,\nthen, do intellectual creatures in the world of Venus take wing when\nthey choose? Upon what spectacle of fluttering pinions afloat in\niridescent air, like a Raphael dream of heaven and its angels, might we\nnot look down if we could get near enough to our brilliant evening star\nto behold the intimate splendors of its life?\n\nAs Venus herself would be the most brilliant member of the celestial\nhost to an observer stationed on the night side of Mercury, so the earth\ntakes precedence in the midnight sky of Venus. For the inhabitants of\nVenus Mercury is a splendid evening and morning star only, while the\nearth, being an outer planet, is visible at times in that part of the\nsky which is directly opposite to the place of the sun. The light\nreflected from our planet is probably less dazzling than that which\nVenus sends to us, both because, at our greater distance, the sunlight\nis less intense, and because our rarer atmosphere reflects a smaller\nproportion of the rays incident upon it. But the earth is, after all, a\nmore brilliant phenomenon seen from Venus than the latter is seen from\nthe earth, for the reason that the entire illuminated disk of the earth\nis presented toward our sister planet when the two are at their nearest\npoint of approach, whereas, at that time, the larger part of the surface\nof Venus that is turned earthward has no illumination, while the\nilluminated portion is a mere crescent.\n\nOwing, again, to the comparative rarity of the terrestrial atmosphere,\nit is probable that the inhabitants of Venus--assuming their\nexistence--enjoy a superb view of the continents, oceans, polar snows,\nand passing clouds that color and variegate the face of the earth. Our\nastronomers can study the full disk of Venus only when she is at her\ngreatest distance, and on the opposite side of the sun from us, where\nshe is half concealed in the glare. The astronomers of Venus, on the\nother hand, can study the earth under the most favorable conditions of\nobservation--that is to say, when it is nearest to them and when, being\nin opposition to the sun, its whole disk is fully illuminated. In fact,\nthere is no planet in the entire system which enjoys an outlook toward a\nsister world comparable with that which Venus enjoys with regard to the\nearth. If there be astronomers upon Venus, armed with telescopes, it is\nsafe to guess that they possess a knowledge of the surface of the earth\nfar exceeding in minuteness and accuracy the knowledge that we possess\nof the features of any heavenly body except the moon. They must long ago\nhave been able to form definite conclusions concerning the meteorology\nand the probable habitability of our planet.\n\nIt certainly tends to increase our interest in Venus when, granting\nthat she is inhabited, we reflect upon the penetrating scrutiny of which\nthe earth may be the object whenever Venus--as happens once every 584\ndays--passes between us and the sun. The spectacle of our great planet,\nglowing in its fullest splendor in the midnight sky, pied and streaked\nwith water, land, cloud, and snow, is one that might well excite among\nthe astronomers of another world, so fortunately placed to observe it,\nan interest even greater than that which the recurrence of total solar\neclipses occasions upon the earth. For the inhabitants of Venus the\nstudy of the earth must be the most absorbing branch of observational\nastronomy, and the subject, we may imagine, of numberless volumes of\nlearned memoirs, far exceeding in the definiteness of their conclusions\nthe books that we have written about the physical characteristics of\nother members of the solar system. And, if we are to look for attempts\non the part of the inhabitants of other worlds to communicate with us by\nsignals across the ether, it would certainly seem that Venus is the\nmost likely source of such efforts, for from no other planet can those\nfeatures of the earth that give evidence of its habitability be so\nclearly discerned. Of one thing it would seem we may be certain: if\nVenus has intellectual inhabitants they possess far more convincing\nevidence of our existence than we are likely ever to have of theirs.\n\nIn referring to the view of the earth from Mercury it was remarked that\nthe moon is probably visible to the naked eye. From Venus the moon is\nnot only visible, but conspicuous, to the naked eye, circling about the\nearth, and appearing at times to recede from it to a distance of about\nhalf a degree--equal to the diameter of the full moon as we see it. The\ndisk of the earth is not quite four times greater in diameter than that\nof the moon, and nowhere else in the solar system is there an instance\nin which two bodies, no more widely different in size than are the moon\nand the earth, are closely linked together. The moons of the other\nplanets that possess satellites are relatively so small that they\nappear in the telescope as mere specks beside their primaries, but the\nmoon is so large as compared with the earth that the two must appear, as\nviewed from Venus, like a double planet. To the naked eye they may look\nlike a very wide and brilliant double star, probably of contrasted\ncolors, the moon being silvery white and the earth, perhaps, now of a\ngolden or reddish tinge and now green or blue, according to the part of\nits surface turned toward Venus, and according, also, to the season that\nchances to be reigning over that part.\n\nSuch a spectacle could not fail to be of absorbing interest, and we can\nnot admit the possibility of intelligent inhabitants on Venus without\nsupposing them to watch the motions of the moon and the earth with the\nutmost intentness. The passage of the moon behind and in front of the\nearth, and its eclipses when it goes into the earth's shadow, could be\nseen without the aid of telescopes, while, with such instruments, these\nphenomena would possess the highest scientific interest and importance.\n\nBecause the earth has a satellite so easily observable, the astronomers\nof Venus could not remain ignorant of the exact mass of our planet, and\nin that respect they would outstrip us in the race for knowledge, since,\non account of the lack of a satellite attending Venus, we have been able\nto do no more than make an approximate estimate of her mass.\n\nWith telescopes, too, in the case of a solar eclipse occurring at the\ntime of the earth's opposition, they could see the black spot formed by\nthe shadow of the moon, where the end of its cone moved across the earth\nlike the point of an invisible pencil, and could watch it traversing\ncontinents and oceans, or thrown out in bold contrast upon the white\nbackground of a great area of clouds. Indeed, the phenomena which our\nglobe and its satellite present to Venus must be so varied and wonderful\nthat one might well wish to visit that planet merely for the sake of\nbeholding them.\n\nThus far we have found so much of brilliant promise in the earth's twin\nsister that I almost hesitate to approach another phase of the subject\nwhich may tend to weaken the faith of some readers in the habitability\nof Venus. It may have been observed that heretofore nothing has been\nsaid as to the planet's rotation period, but, without specifically\nmentioning it, I have tacitly assumed the correctness of the generally\naccepted period of about twenty-four hours, determined by De Vico and\nother observers. This period, closely accordant with the earth's, is, as\nfar as it goes, another argument for the habitability of Venus.\n\nBut now it must be stated that no less eminent an authority than\nSchiaparelli holds that Venus, as well as Mercury, makes but a single\nturn on its axis in the course of a revolution about the sun, and,\nconsequently, is a two-faced world, one side staring eternally at the\nsun and the other side wearing the black mask of endless night.\n\nSchiaparelli made this announcement concerning Venus but a few weeks\nafter publishing his discovery of Mercury's peculiar rotation. He\nhimself appears to be equally confident in both cases of the\ncorrectness of his conclusions and the certainty of his observation. As\nwith Mercury, several other observers have corroborated him, and\nparticularly Percival Lowell in this country. Mr. Lowell, indeed, seems\nunwilling to admit that any doubt can be entertained. Nevertheless, very\ngrave doubt is entertained, and that by many, and probably by the\nmajority, of the leading professional astronomers and observers. In\nfact, some observers of great ability, equipped with powerful\ninstruments, have directly contradicted the results of Schiaparelli and\nhis supporters.\n\nThe reader may ask: \"Why so readily accept Schiaparelli's conclusions\nwith regard to Mercury while rejecting them in the case of Venus?\"\n\nThe reply is twofold. In the first place the markings on Venus, although\nMr. Lowell sketched them with perfect confidence in 1896, are, by the\nalmost unanimous testimony of those who have searched for them with\ntelescopes, both large and small, extremely difficult to see,\nindistinct in outline, and perhaps evanescent in character. The sketches\nof no two observers agree, and often they are remarkably unlike. The\nfact has already been mentioned that Mr. Lowell noticed a kind of veil\npartially obscuring the markings, and which he ascribed, no doubt\ncorrectly, to the planet's atmosphere. But he thinks that,\nnotwithstanding the atmospheric veil, the markings noted by him were\nunquestionably permanent features of the planet's real surface.\nInasmuch, however, as his drawings represent things entirely different\nfrom what others have seen, there seems to be weight in the suggestion\nthat the radiating bands and shadings noticed by him were in some manner\nillusory, and perhaps of atmospheric origin.\n\nIf the markings were evidently of a permanent nature and attached to the\nsolid shell of the planet, and if they were of sufficient distinctness\nto be seen in substantially the same form by all observers armed with\ncompetent instruments, then whatever conclusion was drawn from their\napparent motion as to the period of the planet's rotation would have to\nbe accepted. In the case of Mercury the markings, while not easily seen,\nappear to be sufficiently distinct to afford confidence in the result of\nobservations based upon them, but Venus's markings have been represented\nin so many different ways that it seems advisable to await more light\nbefore accepting any extraordinary, and in itself improbable, conclusion\nbased upon them.\n\nIt should also be added that in 1900 spectroscopic observations by\nBelopolski at Pulkova gave evidence that Venus really rotates rapidly on\nher axis, in a period probably approximating to the twenty-four hours of\nthe earth's rotation, thus corroborating the older conclusions.\n\nBelopolski's observation, it may be remarked, was based upon what is\nknown as the Doppler principle, which is employed in measuring the\nmotion of stars in the line of sight, and in other cases of rapidly\nmoving sources of light. According to this principle, when a source of\nlight, either original or reflected, is approaching the observer, the\ncharacteristic lines in its spectrum are shifted toward the blue end,\nand when it is retreating from the observer the lines are shifted toward\nthe red end. Now, in the case of a planet rotating rapidly on its axis,\nit is clear that if the observer is situated in, or nearly in, the plane\nof the planet's equator, one edge of its disk will be approaching his\neye while the opposite edge is retreating, and the lines in the spectrum\nof a beam of light from the advancing edge will be shifted toward the\nblue, while those in the spectrum of the light coming from the\nretreating edge will be shifted toward the red. And, by carefully noting\nthe amount of the shifting, the velocity of the planet's rotation can be\ncomputed. This is what was done by Belopolski in the case of Venus, with\nthe result above noted.\n\nSecondly, the theory that Venus rotates but once in the course of a\nrevolution finds but slight support from the doctrine of tidal friction,\nas compared with that which it receives when applied to Mercury. The\neffectiveness of the sun's attraction in slowing down the rotation of a\nplanet through the braking action of the tides raised in the body of the\nplanet while it is yet molten or plastic, varies inversely as the sixth\npower of the planet's distance. For Mercury this effectiveness is nearly\nthree hundred times as great as it is for the earth, while for Venus it\nis only seven times as great. While we may admit, then, that Mercury,\nbeing relatively close to the sun and subject to an enormous braking\naction, lost rotation until--as occurred for a similar reason to the\nmoon under the tidal attraction of the earth--it ended by keeping one\nface always toward its master, we are not prepared to make the same\nadmission in the case of Venus, where the effective force concerned is\ncomparatively so slight.\n\nIt should be added, however, that no certain evidence of polar\ncompression in the outline of Venus's disk has ever been obtained, and\nthis fact would favor the theory of a very slow rotation because a\nplastic globe in swift rotation has its equatorial diameter increased\nand its polar diameter diminished. If Venus were as much flattened at\nthe poles as the earth is, it would seem that the fact could not escape\ndetection, yet the necessary observations are very difficult, and Venus\nis so brilliant that her light increases the difficulty, while her\ntransits across the sun, when she can be seen as a round black disk, are\nvery rare phenomena, the latest having occurred in 1874 and 1882, and\nthe next not being due until 2004.\n\nUpon the whole, probably the best method of settling the question of\nVenus's rotation is the spectroscopic method, and that, as we saw, has\nalready given evidence for the short period.\n\nEven if it were established that Venus keeps always the same face to the\nsun, it might not be necessary to abandon altogether the belief that she\nis habitable, although, of course, the obstacles to that belief would be\nincreased. Venus's orbit being so nearly circular, and her orbital\nmotion so nearly invariable, she has but a very slight libration with\nreference to the sun, and the east and west lunes on her surface, where\nday and night would alternate once in her year of 225 days, would be so\nnarrow as to be practically negligible.\n\nBut, owing to her extensive atmosphere, there would be a very broad band\nof twilight on Venus, running entirely around the planet at the inner\nedge of the light hemisphere. What the meteorological conditions within\nthis zone would be is purely a matter of conjecture. As in the case of\nMercury, we should expect an interchange of atmospheric currents between\nthe light and dark sides of the planet, the heated air rising under the\ninfluence of the unsetting sun in one hemisphere, and being replaced by\nan indraught of cold air from the other. The twilight band would\nprobably be the scene of atmospheric conflicts and storms, and of\nimmense precipitation, if there were oceans on the light hemisphere to\ncharge the air with moisture.\n\nIt has been suggested that ice and snow might be piled in a vast circle\nof glaciers, belting the planet along the line between perpetual day\nand night, and that where the sunbeams touched these icy deposits near\nthe edge of the light hemisphere a marvelous spectacle of prismatic\nhills of crystal would be presented!\n\nIt may be remarked that it would be the inhabitants of the dark\nhemisphere who would enjoy the beautiful scene of the earth and the moon\nin opposition.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nMARS, A WORLD MORE ADVANCED THAN OURS\n\n\nMars is the fourth planet in the order of distance from the sun, and the\noutermost member of the terrestrial group. Its mean distance is\n141,500,000 miles, variable, through the eccentricity of its orbit, to\nthe extent of about 13,000,000 miles. It will be observed that this is\nonly a million miles less than the variation in Mercury's distance from\nthe sun, from which, in a previous chapter, were deduced most momentous\nconsequences; but, in the case of Mars, the ratio of the variation to\nthe mean distance is far smaller than with Mercury, so that the effect\nupon the temperature of the planet is relatively insignificant.\n\nMars gets a little less than half as much solar light and heat as the\nearth receives, its situation in this respect being just the opposite\nto that of Venus. Its period of orbital revolution, or the length of its\nyear, is 687 of our days. The diameter of Mars is 4,200 miles, and its\ndensity is 73 per cent of the earth's density. Gravity on its surface is\nonly 38 per cent of terrestrial gravity--i.e., a one hundred-pound\nweight removed from the earth to Mars would there weigh but thirty-eight\npounds. Mars evidently has an atmosphere, the details of which we shall\ndiscuss later.\n\nThe poles of the planet are inclined from a perpendicular to the plane\nof its orbit at very nearly the same angle as that of the earth's poles,\nviz., 24\u00b0 50\u00b4. Its rotation on its axis is also effected in almost the\nsame period as the earth's, viz., 24 hours, 37 minutes.\n\nWhen in opposition to the sun, Mars may be only about 35,000,000 miles\nfrom the earth, but its average distance when in that position is more\nthan 48,000,000 miles, and may be more than 60,000,000. These\ndifferences arise from the eccentricities of the orbits of the two\nplanets. When on the farther side of the sun--i.e., in conjunction with\nthe sun as seen from the earth--Mars's average distance from us is about\n235,000,000 miles. In consequence of these great changes in its\ndistance, Mars is sometimes a very conspicuous object in the sky, and at\nother times inconspicuous.\n\nThe similarity in the inclination of the axis of the two planets results\nin a close resemblance between the seasons on Mars and on the earth,\nalthough, owing to the greater length of its year, Mars's seasons are\nmuch longer than ours. Winter and summer visit in succession its\nnorthern and southern hemispheres just as occurs on the planet that we\ninhabit, and the torrid, temperate, and frigid zones on its surface have\nnearly the same angular width as on the earth. In this respect Mars is\nthe first of the foreign planets we have studied to resemble the earth.\n\nAround each of its poles appears a circular white patch, which visibly\nexpands when winter prevails upon it, and rapidly contracts, sometimes\nalmost completely disappearing, under a summer sun. From the time of\nSir William Herschel the almost universal belief among astronomers has\nbeen that these gleaming polar patches on Mars are composed of snow and\nice, like the similar glacial caps of the earth, and no one can look at\nthem with a telescope and not feel the liveliest interest in the planet\nto which they belong, for they impart to it an appearance of likeness to\nour globe which at first glance is all but irresistible.\n\nTo watch one of them apparently melting, becoming perceptibly smaller\nweek after week, while the general surface of the corresponding\nhemisphere of the planet deepens in color, and displays a constantly\nincreasing wealth of details as summer advances across it, is an\nexperience of the most memorable kind, whose effect upon the mind of the\nobserver is indescribable.\n\nEarly in the history of the telescope it became known that, in addition\nto the polar caps, Mars presented a number of distinct surface features,\nand gradually, as instruments increased in power and observers in\nskill, charts of the planet were produced showing a surface diversified\nsomewhat in the manner that characterizes the face of the earth,\nalthough the permanent forms do not closely resemble those of our\nplanet.\n\nTwo principal colors exist on the disk of Mars--dark, bluish gray or\ngreenish gray, characterizing areas which have generally been regarded\nas seas, and light yellowish red, overspreading broad regions looked\nupon as continents. It was early observed that if the dark regions\nreally are seas, the proportion of water to land upon Mars is much\nsmaller than upon the earth.\n\nFor two especial reasons Mars has generally been regarded as an older or\nmore advanced planet than the earth. The first reason is that, accepting\nLaplace's theory of the origin of the planetary system from a series of\nrings left off at the periphery of the contracting solar nebula, Mars\nmust have come into existence earlier than the earth, because, being\nmore distant from the center of the system, the ring from which it was\nformed would have been separated sooner than the terrestrial ring. The\nsecond reason is that Mars being smaller and less massive than the earth\nhas run through its developments a cooling globe more rapidly. The\nbearing of these things upon the problems of life on Mars will be\nconsidered hereafter.\n\nAnd now, once more, Schiaparelli appears as the discoverer of surprising\nfacts about one of the most interesting worlds of the solar system.\nDuring the exceptionally favorable opposition of Mars in 1877, when an\nAmerican astronomer, Asaph Hall, discovered the planet's two minute\nsatellites, and again during the opposition of 1879, the Italian\nobserver caught sight of an astonishing network of narrow dark lines\nintersecting the so-called continental regions of the planet and\ncrossing one another in every direction. Schiaparelli did not see the\nlittle moons that Hall discovered, and Hall did not perceive the\nenigmatical lines that Schiaparelli detected. Hall had by far the larger\nand more powerful telescope; Schiaparelli had much the more steady and\nfavorable atmosphere for astronomical observation. Yet these differences\nin equipment and circumstances do not clearly explain why each observer\nshould have seen what the other did not.\n\nThere may be a partial explanation in the fact that an observer having\nmade a remarkable discovery is naturally inclined to confine his\nattention to it, to the neglect of other things. But it was soon found\nthat Schiaparelli's lines--to which he gave the name \"canals,\" merely on\naccount of their shape and appearance, and without any intention to\ndefine their real nature--were excessively difficult telescopic objects.\nEight or nine years elapsed before any other observer corroborated\nSchiaparelli's observations, and notwithstanding the \"sensation\" which\nthe discovery of the canals produced they were for many years regarded\nby the majority of astronomers as an illusion.\n\nBut they were no illusion, and in 1881 Schiaparelli added to the\nastonishment created by his original discovery, and furnished additional\ngrounds for skepticism, by announcing that, at certain times, many of\nthe canals geminated, or became double! He continued his observations at\neach subsequent opposition, adding to the number of the canals observed,\nand charting them with classical names upon a detailed map of the\nplanet's surface.\n\nAt length in 1886 Perrotin, at Nice, detected many of Schiaparelli's\ncanals, and later they were seen by others. In 1888 Schiaparelli greatly\nextended his observations, and in 1892 and 1894 some of the canals were\nstudied with the 36-inch telescope of the Lick Observatory, and in the\nlast-named year a very elaborate series of observations upon them was\nmade by Percival Lowell and his associates, Prof. William C. Pickering\nand Mr. A.E. Douglass, at Flagstaff, Arizona. Mr. Lowell's charts of the\nplanet are the most complete yet produced, containing 184 canals to\nwhich separate names have been given, besides more than a hundred other\nmarkings also designated by individual appellations.\n\nIt should not be inferred from the fact that Schiaparelli's discovery\nin 1877 excited so much surprise and incredulity that no glimpse of the\npeculiar canal-like markings on Mars had been obtained earlier than\nthat. At least as long ago as 1864 Mr. Dawes, in England, had seen and\nsketched half a dozen of the larger canals, or at least the broader\nparts of them, especially where they connect with the dark regions known\nas seas, but Dawes did not see them in their full extent, did not\nrecognize their peculiar character, and entirely failed to catch sight\nof the narrower and more numerous ones which constitute the wonderful\nnetwork discovered by the Italian astronomer. Schiaparelli found no less\nthan sixty canals during his first series of observations in 1877.\n\nLet us note some of the more striking facts about the canals which\nSchiaparelli has described. We can not do better than quote his own\nwords:\n\n\"There are on this planet, traversing the continents, long dark lines\nwhich may be designated as _canals_, although we do not yet know what\nthey are. These lines run from one to another of the somber spots that\nare regarded as seas, and form, over the lighter, or continental,\nregions a well-defined network. Their arrangement appears to be\ninvariable and permanent; at least, as far as I can judge from four and\na half years of observation. Nevertheless, their aspect and their degree\nof visibility are not always the same, and depend upon circumstances\nwhich the present state of our knowledge does not yet permit us to\nexplain with certainty. In 1879 a great number were seen which were not\nvisible in 1877, and in 1882 all those which had been seen at former\noppositions were found again, together with new ones. Sometimes these\ncanals present themselves in the form of shadowy and vague lines, while\non other occasions they are clear and precise, like a trace drawn with a\npen. In general they are traced upon the sphere like the lines of great\ncircles; a few show a sensible lateral curvature. They cross one another\nobliquely, or at right angles. They have a breadth of two degrees, or\n120 kilometres [74 miles], and several extend over a length of eighty\ndegrees, or 4,800 kilometres [nearly 3,000 miles]. Their tint is very\nnearly the same as that of the seas, usually a little lighter. Every\ncanal terminates at both its extremities in a sea, or in another canal;\nthere is not a single example of one coming to an end in the midst of\ndry land.\n\n\"This is not all. In certain seasons these canals become double. This\nphenomenon seems to appear at a determinate epoch, and to be produced\nsimultaneously over the entire surface of the planet's continents. There\nwas no indication of it in 1877, during the weeks that preceded and\nfollowed the summer solstice of that world. A single isolated case\npresented itself in 1879. On the 26th of December, this year--a little\nbefore the spring equinox, which occurred on Mars on the 21st of\nJanuary, 1880--I noticed the doubling of the Nile [a canal thus named]\nbetween the Lakes of the Moon and the Ceraunic Gulf. These two regular,\nequal, and parallel lines caused me, I confess, a profound surprise,\nthe more so because a few days earlier, on the 23d and the 24th of\nDecember, I had carefully observed that very region without discovering\nanything of the kind.\n\n\"I awaited with curiosity the return of the planet in 1881, to see if an\nanalogous phenomenon would present itself in the same place, and I saw\nthe same thing reappear on the 11th of January, 1882, one month after\nthe spring equinox--which occurred on the 8th of December, 1881. The\nduplication was still more evident at the end of February. On this same\ndate, the 11th of January, another duplication had already taken place,\nthat of the middle portion of the canal of the Cyclops, adjoining\nElysium. [Elysium is a part of one of the continental areas.]\n\n\"Yet greater was my astonishment when, on the 19th of January, I saw the\ncanal Jamuna, which was then in the center of the disk, formed very\nrigidly of two parallel straight lines, crossing the space which\nseparates the Niliac Lake from the Gulf of Aurora. At first sight I\nbelieved it was an illusion, caused by fatigue of the eye and some new\nkind of strabismus, but I had to yield to the evidence. After the 19th\nof January I simply passed from wonder to wonder; successively the\nOrontes, the Euphrates, the Phison, the Ganges, and the larger part of\nthe other canals, displayed themselves very clearly and indisputably\nduplicated. There were not less than twenty examples of duplication, of\nwhich seventeen were observed in the space of a month, from the 19th of\nJanuary to the 19th of February.\n\n\"In certain cases it was possible to observe precursory symptoms which\nare not lacking in interest. Thus, on the 13th of January, a light,\nill-defined shade extended alongside the Ganges; on the 18th and the\n19th one could only distinguish a series of white spots; on the 20th the\nshadow was still indecisive, but on the 21st the duplication was\nperfectly clear, such as I observed it until the 23d of February. The\nduplication of the Euphrates, of the canal of the Titans, and of the\nPyriphlegethon also began in an uncertain and nebulous form.\n\n\"These duplications are not an optical effect depending on increase of\nvisual power, as happens in the observation of double stars, and it is\nnot the canal itself splitting in two longitudinally. Here is what is\nseen: To the right or left of a pre-existing line, without any change in\nthe course and position of that line, one sees another line produce\nitself, equal and parallel to the first, at a distance generally varying\nfrom six to twelve degrees--i.e., from 350 to 700 kilometres (217 to 434\nmiles); even closer ones seem to be produced, but the telescope is not\npowerful enough to distinguish them with certainty. Their tint appears\nto be a quite deep reddish brown. The parallelism is sometimes\nrigorously exact. There is nothing analogous in terrestrial geography.\nEverything indicates that here there is an organization special to the\nplanet Mars, probably connected with the course of its seasons.\"[1]\n\n[Footnote 1: L'Astronomie, vol. i, 1882, pp. 217 _et seq._]\n\nSchiaparelli adds that he took every precaution to avoid the least\nsuspicion of illusion. \"I am absolutely sure,\" he says, \"of what I have\nobserved.\"\n\nI have quoted his statement, especially about the duplication of the\ncanals, at so much length, both on account of its intrinsic interest and\nbecause it has many times been argued that this particular phenomenon\nmust be illusory even though the canals are real.\n\nOne of the most significant facts that came out in the early\nobservations was the evident connection between the appearance of the\ncanals and the seasonal changes on Mars. It was about the time of the\nspring equinox, when the white polar caps had begun to melt, that\nSchiaparelli first noticed the phenomenon of duplication. As the season\nadvanced the doubling of the canals increased in frequency and the lines\nbecame more distinct. In the meantime the polar caps were becoming\nsmaller. Broadly speaking, Schiaparelli's observation showed that the\ndoubling of the canals occurred principally a little after the spring\nequinox and a little before the autumn equinox; that the phenomenon\ndisappeared in large part at the epoch of the winter solstice, and\ndisappeared altogether at the epoch of the summer solstice. Moreover, he\nobserved that many of the canals, without regard to duplication, were\ninvisible at times, and reappeared gradually; faint, scarcely visible\nlines and shadows, deepened and became more distinct until they were\nclearly and sharply defined, and these changes, likewise, were evidently\nseasonal.\n\nThe invariable connection of the canals at their terminations with the\nregions called seas, the fact that as the polar caps disappeared the\nsealike expanses surrounding the polar regions deepened in color, and\nother similar considerations soon led to the suggestion that there\nexisted on Mars a wonderful system of water circulation, whereby the\nmelting of the polar snows, as summer passed alternately from one\nhemisphere to the other, served to reenforce the supply of water in the\nseas, and, through the seas, in the canals traversing the broad\nexpanses of dry land that occupy the equatorial regions of the planet.\nThe thought naturally occurred that the canals might be of artificial\norigin, and might indicate the existence of a gigantic system of\nirrigation serving to maintain life upon the globe of Mars. The\ngeometrical perfection of the lines, their straightness, their absolute\nparallelism when doubled, their remarkable tendency to radiate from\ndefinite centers, lent strength to the hypothesis of an artificial\norigin. But their enormous size, length, and number tended to stagger\nbelief in the ability of the inhabitants of any world to achieve a work\nso stupendous.\n\nAfter a time a change of view occurred concerning the nature of the\nexpanses called seas, and Mr. Lowell, following his observations of\n1894, developed the theory of the water circulation and irrigation of\nMars in a new form. He and others observed that occasionally canals were\nvisible cutting straight across some of the greenish, or bluish-gray,\nareas that had been regarded as seas. This fact suggested that, instead\nof seas, these dark expanses may rather be areas of marshy ground\ncovered with vegetation which flourishes and dies away according as the\nsupply of water alternately increases and diminishes, while the reddish\nareas known as continents are barren deserts, intersected by canals; and\nas the water released by the melting of the polar snows begins to fill\nthe canals, vegetation springs up along their sides and becomes visible\nin the form of long narrow bands.\n\nAccording to this theory, the phenomena called canals are simply lines\nof vegetation, the real canals being individually too small to be\ndetected. It may be supposed that from a central supply canal irrigation\nditches are extended for a distance of twenty or thirty miles on each\nside, thus producing a strip of fertile soil from forty to sixty miles\nwide, and hundreds, or in some cases two or three thousands, of miles in\nlength.\n\nThe water supply being limited, the inhabitants can not undertake to\nirrigate the entire surface of the thirsty land, and convenience of\ncirculation induces them to extend the irrigated areas in the form of\nlong lines. The surface of Mars, according to Lowell's observation, is\nremarkably flat and level, so that no serious obstacle exists to the\nextension of the canal system in straight bands as undeviating as arcs\nof great circles.\n\nWherever two or more canals meet, or cross, a rounded dark spot from a\nhundred miles, or less, to three hundred miles in diameter, is seen. An\nastonishing number of these appear on Mr. Lowell's charts. Occasionally,\nas occurs at the singular spot named Lacus Solis, several canals\nconverging from all points of the compass meet at a central point like\nthe spokes of a wheel; in other cases, as, for instance, that of the\nlong canal named Eumenides, with its continuation Orcus, a single\nconspicuous line is seen threading a large number of round dark spots,\nwhich present the appearance of a row of beads upon a string. These\ncircular spots, which some have regarded as lakes, Mr. Lowell believes\nare rather oases in the great deserts, and granting the correctness of\nhis theory of the canals the aptness of this designation is apparent.[2]\n\n[Footnote 2: The reader can find many of these \"canals\" and \"oases,\" as\nwell as some of the other regions on Mars that have received names, in\nthe frontispiece.]\n\nWherever several canals, that is to say, several bands of vegetation or\nbands of life, meet, it is reasonable to assume that an irrigated and\nhabitable area of considerable extent will be developed, and in such\nplaces the imagination may picture the location of the chief centers of\npopulation, perhaps in the form of large cities, or perhaps in groups of\nsmaller towns and villages. The so-called Lacus Solis is one of these\nlocalities.\n\nSo, likewise, it seems but natural that along the course of a broad,\nwell-irrigated band a number of expansions should occur, driving back\nthe bounds of the desert, forming rounded areas of vegetation, and thus\naffording a footing for population. Wherever two bands cross such areas\nwould be sure to exist, and in almost every instance of crossing the\ntelescope actually shows them.\n\nAs to the gemination or duplication of many of the lines which, at the\nbeginning of the season, appear single, it may be suggested that, in the\ncourse of the development of the vast irrigation system of the planet\nparallel bands of cultivation have been established, one receiving its\nwater supply from the canals of the other, and consequently lagging a\nlittle behind in visibility as the water slowly percolates through the\nsoil and awakens the vegetation. Or else, the character of the\nvegetation itself may differ as between two such parallel bands, one\nbeing supplied with plants that spring up and mature quickly when the\nsoil about their roots is moistened, while the plants in the twin band\nrespond more slowly to stimulation.\n\nObjection has been made to the theory of the artificial origin of the\ncanals of Mars on the ground, already mentioned, that the work required\nto construct them would be beyond the capacity of any race of creatures\nresembling man. The reply that has been made to this is twofold. In the\nfirst place, it should be remembered that the theory, as Mr. Lowell\npresents it, does not assert that the visible lines are the actual\ncanals, but only that they are strips of territory intersected, like\nHolland or the center of the plain of Lombardy, by innumerable\nirrigation canals and ditches. To construct such works is clearly not an\nimpossible undertaking, although it does imply great industry and\nconcentration of effort.\n\nIn the second place, since the force of gravity on Mars is in the ratio\nof only 38 to 100 compared with the earth's, it is evident that the\ndiminished weight of all bodies to be handled would give the inhabitants\nof Mars an advantage over those of the earth in the performance of\nmanual labor, provided that they possess physical strength and activity\nas great as ours. But, in consequence of this very fact of the slighter\nforce of gravity, a man upon Mars could attain a much greater size, and\nconsequently much greater muscular strength, than his fellows upon the\nearth possess without being oppressed by his own weight. In other words,\nas far as the force of gravity may be considered as the decisive factor,\nMars could be inhabited by giants fifteen feet tall, who would be\nrelatively just as active, and just as little impeded in their movements\nby the weight of their bodies, as a six-footer is upon the earth. But\nthey would possess far more physical strength than we do, while, in\ndoing work, they would have much lighter materials to deal with.\n\nWhether the theory that the canals of Mars really are canals is true or\nnot, at any rate there can now be no doubt as to the existence of the\nstrange lines which bear that designation. The suggestion has been\noffered that their builders may no longer be in existence, Mars having\nalready passed the point in its history where life must cease upon its\nsurface. This brings us to consider again the statement, made near the\nbeginning of this chapter, that Mars is, perhaps, at a more advanced\nstage of development than the earth. If we accept this view, then,\nprovided there was originally some resemblance between Mars's life forms\nand those of the earth, the inhabitants of that planet would, at every\nstep, probably be in front of their terrestrial rivals, so that at the\npresent time they should stand well in advance. Mr. Lowell has, perhaps,\nput this view of the relative advancement in evolution of Mars and its\ninhabitants as picturesquely as anybody.\n\n\"In Mars,\" he says, \"we have before us the spectacle of a world\nrelatively well on in years, a world much older than the earth. To so\nmuch about his age Mars bears witness on his face. He shows unmistakable\nsigns of being old. Advancing planetary years have left their mark\nlegible there. His continents are all smoothed down; his oceans have all\ndried up.... Mars being thus old himself, we know that evolution on his\nsurface must be similarly advanced. This only informs us of its\ncondition relative to the planet's capabilities. Of its actual state our\ndata are not definite enough to furnish much deduction. But from the\nfact that our own development has been comparatively a recent thing, and\nthat a long time would be needed to bring even Mars to his present\ngeological condition, we may judge any life he may support to be not\nonly relatively, but really older than our own. From the little we can\nsee such appears to be the case. The evidence of handicraft, if such it\nbe, points to a highly intelligent mind behind it. Irrigation,\nunscientifically conducted, would not give us such truly wonderful\nmathematical fitness in the several parts to the whole as we there\nbehold.... Quite possibly such Martian folk are possessed of inventions\nof which we have not dreamed, and with them electrophones and\nkinetoscopes are things of a bygone past, preserved with veneration in\nmuseums as relics of the clumsy contrivances of the simple childhood of\nthe race. Certainly what we see hints at the existence of beings who are\nin advance of, not behind us, in the journey of life.\"[3]\n\n[Footnote 3: Mars, by Percival Lowell, p. 207 _et seq._]\n\nGranted the existence of such a race as is thus described, and to them\nit might not seem a too appalling enterprise, when their planet had\nbecome decrepit, with its atmosphere thinned out and its supply of water\ndepleted, to grapple with the destroying hand of nature and to prolong\nthe career of their world by feats of chemistry and engineering as yet\nbeyond the compass of human knowledge.\n\nIt is confidence, bred from considerations like these, in the superhuman\npowers of the supposed inhabitants of Mars that has led to the popular\nidea that they are trying to communicate by signals with the earth.\nCertain enigmatical spots of light, seen at the edge of the illuminated\ndisk of Mars, and projecting into the unilluminated part--for Mars,\nalthough an outer planet, shows at particular times a gibbous phase\nresembling that of the moon just before or just after the period of full\nmoon--have been interpreted by some, but without any scientific\nevidence, as of artificial origin.\n\nUpon the assumption that these bright points, and others occasionally\nseen elsewhere on the planet's disk, are intended by the Martians for\nsignals to the earth, entertaining calculations have been made as to the\nquantity of light that would be required in the form of a \"flash signal\"\nto be visible across the distance separating the two planets. The\nresults of the calculations have hardly been encouraging to possible\ninvestors in interplanetary telegraphy, since it appears that\nheliographic mirrors with reflecting surfaces measured by square miles,\ninstead of square inches, would be required to send a visible beam from\nthe earth to Mars or _vice versa_.\n\nThe projections of light on Mars can be explained much more simply and\nreasonably. Various suggestions have been made about them; among others,\nthat they are masses of cloud reflecting the sunshine; that they are\nareas of snow; and that they are the summits of mountains crowned with\nice and encircled with clouds. In fact, a huge mountain mass lying on\nthe terminator, or the line between day and night, would produce the\neffect of a tongue of light projecting into the darkness without\nassuming that it was snow-covered or capped with clouds, as any one may\nconvince himself by studying the moon with a telescope when the\nterminator lies across some of its most mountainous regions. To be sure,\nthere is reason to think that the surface of Mars is remarkably flat;\nyet even so the planet may have some mountains, and on a globe the\ngreater part of whose shell is smooth any projections would be\nconspicuous, particularly where the sunlight fell at a low angle across\nthem.\n\nAnother form in which the suggestion of interplanetary communication has\nbeen urged is plainly an outgrowth of the invention and surprising\ndevelopments of wireless telegraphy. The human mind is so constituted\nthat whenever it obtains any new glimpse into the arcana of nature it\nimmediately imagines an indefinite and all but unlimited extension of\nits view in that direction. So to many it has not appeared unreasonable\nto assume that, since it is possible to transmit electric impulses for\nconsiderable distances over the earth's surface by the simple\npropagation of a series of waves, or undulations, without connecting\nwires, it may also be possible to send such impulses through the ether\nfrom planet to planet.\n\nThe fact that the electric undulations employed in wireless telegraphy\npass between stations connected by the crust of the earth itself, and\nimmersed in a common atmospheric envelope, is not deemed by the\nsupporters of the theory in question as a very serious objection, for,\nthey contend, electric waves are a phenomenon of the ether, which\nextends throughout space, and, given sufficient energy, such waves could\ncross the gap between world and world.\n\nBut nobody has shown how much energy would be needed for such a purpose,\nand much less has anybody indicated a way in which the required energy\ncould be artificially developed, or cunningly filched from the stores of\nnature. It is, then, purely an assumption, an interesting figment of\nthe mind, that certain curious disturbances in the electrical state of\nthe air and the earth, affecting delicate electric instruments,\npossessing a marked periodicity in brief intervals of time, and not yet\notherwise accounted for, are due to the throbbing, in the all-enveloping\nether, of impulses transmitted from instruments controlled by the\n_savants_ of Mars, whose insatiable thirst for knowledge, and presumably\nburning desire to learn whether there is not within reach some more\nfortunate world than their half-dried-up globe, has led them into a\ndesperate attempt to \"call up\" the earth on their interplanetary\ntelephone, with the hope that we are wise and skilful enough to\nunderstand and answer them.\n\nIn what language they intend to converse no one has yet undertaken to\ntell, but the suggestion has sapiently been made that, mathematical\nfacts being invariable, the eternal equality of two plus two with four\nmight serve as a basis of understanding, and that a statement of that\ntruth sent by electric taps across the ocean of ether would be a\nconvincing assurance that the inhabitants of the planet from which the\nmessage came at least enjoyed the advantages of a common-school\neducation.\n\nBut, while speculation upon this subject rests on unverified, and at\npresent unverifiable, assumptions, of course everybody would rejoice if\nsuch a thing were possible, for consider what zest and charm would be\nadded to human life if messages, even of the simplest description, could\nbe sent to and received from intelligent beings inhabiting other\nplanets! It is because of this hold that it possesses upon the\nimagination, and the pleasing pictures that it conjures up, that the\nidea of interplanetary communication, once broached, has become so\npopular a topic, even though everybody sees that it should not be taken\ntoo seriously.\n\nThe subject of the atmosphere of Mars can not be dismissed without\nfurther consideration than we have yet given it, because those who think\nthe planet uninhabitable base their opinion largely upon the assumed\nabsence of sufficient air to support life. It was long ago recognized\nthat, other things being equal, a planet of small mass must possess a\nless dense atmosphere than one of large mass. Assuming that each planet\noriginally drew from a common stock, and that the amount and density of\nits atmosphere is measured by its force of gravity, it can be shown that\nMars should have an atmosphere less than one fifth as dense as the\nearth's.\n\nDr. Johnstone Stoney has attacked the problem of planetary atmospheres\nin another way. Knowing the force of gravity on a planet, it is easy to\ncalculate the velocity with which a body, or a particle, would have to\nstart radially from the planet in order to escape from its gravitational\ncontrol. For the earth this critical velocity is about seven miles per\nsecond; for Mars about three miles per second. Estimating the velocity\nof the molecules of the various atmospheric gases, according to the\nkinetic theory, Dr. Stoney finds that some of the smaller planets, and\nthe moon, are gravitationally incapable of retaining all of these gases\nin the form of an atmosphere. Among the atmospheric constituents that,\naccording to this view, Mars would be unable permanently to retain is\nwater vapor. Indeed, he supposes that even the earth is slowly losing\nits water by evaporation into space, and on Mars, owing to the slight\nforce of gravity there, this process would go on much more rapidly, so\nthat, in this way, we have a means of accounting for the apparent drying\nup of that planet, while we may be led to anticipate that at some time\nin the remote future the earth also will begin to suffer from lack of\nwater, and that eventually the chasms of the sea will yawn empty and\ndesolate under a cloudless sky.\n\nBut it is not certain that the original supply of atmospheric elements\nwas in every case proportional to the respective force of gravity of a\nplanet. The fact that Venus appears to have an atmosphere more extensive\nand denser than the earth's, although its force of gravity is a little\nless than that of our globe, indicates at once a variation as between\nthese two planets in the amount of atmospheric material at their\ndisposal. This may be a detail depending upon differences in the mode,\nor in the stage, of their evolution. Thus, after all, Dr. Stoney's\ntheory may be substantially correct and yet Mars may retain sufficient\nwater to form clouds, to be precipitated in snow, and to fill its canals\nafter each annual melting of the polar caps, because the original supply\nwas abundant, and its escape is a gradual process, only to be completed\nby age-long steps.\n\nEven though the evidence of the spectroscope, as far as it goes, seems\nto lend support to the theory that there is no water vapor in the\natmosphere of Mars, we can not disregard the visual evidence that,\nnevertheless, water vapor exists there.\n\nWhat are the polar caps if they are not snow? Frozen carbon dioxide, it\nhas been suggested; but this is hardly satisfactory, for it offers no\nexplanation of the fact that when the polar caps diminish, and in\nproportion as they diminish, the \"seas\" and the canals darken and\nexpand, whereas a reasonable explanation of the correlation of these\nphenomena is offered if we accept the view that the polar caps consist\nof snow.\n\nThen there are many observations on record indicating the existence of\nclouds in Mars's atmosphere. Sometimes a considerable area of its\nsurface has been observed to be temporarily obscured, not by dense\nmasses of cloud such as accompany the progress of great cyclonic storms\nacross the continents and oceans of the earth, but by comparatively thin\nveils of vapor such as would be expected to form in an atmosphere so\ncomparatively rare as that of Mars. And these clouds, in some instances\nat least, appear, like the cirrus streaks and dapples in our own air, to\nfloat at a great elevation. Mr. Douglass, one of Mr. Lowell's associates\nin the observations of 1894 at Flagstaff, Arizona, observed what he\nbelieved to be a cloud over the unilluminated part of Mars's disk,\nwhich, by micrometric measurement and estimate, was drifting at an\nelevation of about fifteen miles above the surface of the planet. This\nwas seen on two successive days, November 25th and November 26th, and it\nunderwent curious fluctuations in visibility, besides moving in a\nnortherly direction at the rate of some thirteen miles an hour. But,\nupon the whole, as Mr. Lowell remarks, the atmosphere of Mars is\nremarkably free of clouds.\n\nThe reader will remember that Mars gets a little less than half as much\nheat from the sun as the earth gets. This fact also has been used as an\nargument against the habitability of the planet. In truth, those who\nthink that life in the solar system is confined to the earth alone\ninsist upon an almost exact reproduction of terrestrial conditions as a\n_sine qua non_ to the habitability of any other planet. Venus, they\nthink, is too hot, and Mars too cold, as if life were rather a happy\naccident than the result of the operation of general laws applicable\nunder a wide variety of conditions. All that we are really justified in\nasserting is that Venus may be too hot and Mars too cold for _us_. Of\ncourse, if we adopt the opinion held by some that the temperature on\nMars is constantly so low that water would remain perpetually frozen, it\ndoes throw the question of the kind of life that could be maintained\nthere into the realm of pure conjecture.\n\nThe argument in favor of an extremely low temperature on Mars is based\non the law of the diminution of radiant energy inversely as the square\nof the distance, together with the assumption that no qualifying\ncircumstances, or no modification of that law, can enter into the\nproblem. According to this view, it could be shown that the temperature\non Mars never rises above -200\u00b0 F. But it is a view that seems to be\ndirectly opposed to the evidence of the telescope, for all who have\nstudied Mars under favorable conditions of observation have been\nimpressed by the rapid and extensive changes that the appearance of its\nsurface undergoes coincidently with the variation of the planet's\nseasons. It has its winter aspect and its summer aspect, perfectly\ndistinct and recognizable, in each hemisphere by turns, and whether the\npolar caps be snow or carbon dioxide, at any rate they melt and\ndisappear under a high sun, thus proving that an accumulation of heat\ntakes place.\n\nProfessor Young says: \"As to the temperature of Mars we have no certain\nknowledge. On the one hand, we know that on account of the planet's\ndistance from the sun the intensity of solar radiation upon its surface\nmust be less than here in the ratio of 1 to (1.524)^2--i.e., only about\n43 per cent as great as with us; its 'solar constant' must be less than\n13 calories against our 30. Then, too, the low density of its\natmosphere, probably less at the planet's surface than on the tops of\nour highest mountains, would naturally assist to keep down the\ntemperature to a point far below the freezing-point of water. But, on\nthe other hand, things certainly _look_ as if the polar caps were really\nmasses of _snow_ and _ice_ deposited from vapor in the planet's\natmosphere, and as if these actually melted during the Martian summer,\nsending floods of water through the channels provided for them, and\ncausing the growth of vegetation along their banks. We are driven,\ntherefore, to suppose either that the planet has sources of heat\ninternal or external which are not yet explained, or else, as long ago\nsuggested, that the polar 'snow' may possibly be composed of something\nelse than frozen _water_.\"[4]\n\n[Footnote 4: General Astronomy, by Charles A. Young. Revised edition,\n1898, p. 363.]\n\nEven while granting the worst that can be said for the low temperature\nof Mars, the persistent believer in its habitability could take refuge\nin the results of recent experiments which have proved that bacterial\nlife is able to resist the utmost degree of cold that can be applied,\nmicroscopic organisms perfectly retaining their vitality--or at least\ntheir power to resume it--when subjected to the fearfully low\ntemperature of liquid air. But then he would be open to the reply that\nthe organisms thus treated are in a torpid condition and deprived of all\nactivity until revived by the application of heat; and the picture of a\nworld in a state of perpetual sleep is not particularly attractive,\nunless the fortunate prince who is destined to awake the slumbering\nbeauty can also be introduced into the romance.[5]\n\n[Footnote 5: Many of the present difficulties about temperatures on the\nvarious planets would be beautifully disposed of if we could accept the\ntheory urged by Mr. Cope Whitehouse, to the effect that the sun is not\nreally a hot body at all, and that what we call solar light and heat are\nonly local manifestations produced in our atmosphere by the\ntransformation of some other form of energy transmitted from the sun;\nvery much as the electric impulses carried by a wire from the\ntransmitting to the receiving station on a telephone line are translated\nby the receiver into waves of sound. According to this theory, which is\nhere mentioned only as an ingenuity and because something of the kind so\nfrequently turns up in one form or another in popular semi-scientific\nliterature, the amount of heat and light on a planet would depend mainly\nupon local causes.]\n\nTo an extent which most of us, perhaps, do not fully appreciate, we are\nindebted for many of the pleasures and conveniences and some of the\nnecessities of life on our planet to its faithful attendant, the moon.\nNeither Mercury nor Venus has a moon, but Mars has two moons. This\nstatement, standing alone, might lead to the conclusion that, as far as\nthe advantages a satellite can afford to the inhabitants of its master\nplanet are concerned, the people of Mars are doubly fortunate. So they\nwould be, perhaps, if Mars's moons were bodies comparable in size with\nour moon, but in fact they are hardly more than a pair of very\nentertaining astronomical toys. The larger of the two, Phobos, is\nbelieved to be about seven miles in diameter; the smaller, Deimos, only\nfive or six miles. Their dimensions thus resemble those of the more\nminute of the asteroids, and the suggestion has even been made that they\nmay be captured asteroids which have fallen under the gravitational\ncontrol of Mars.\n\nThe diameters just mentioned are Professor Pickering's estimates, based\non the amount of light the little satellites reflect, for they are much\ntoo small to present measurable disks. Deimos is 14,600 miles from the\ncenter of Mars and 12,500 miles from its surface. Phobos is 5,800 miles\nfrom the center of the planet and only 3,700 from the surface. Deimos\ncompletes a revolution about the planet in thirty hours and eighteen\nminutes, and Phobos in the astonishingly short period--although, of\ncourse, it is in strict accord with the law of gravitation and in that\nsense not astonishing--of seven hours and thirty-nine minutes.\n\nSince Mars takes twenty-four hours and thirty-seven minutes for one\nrotation on its axis, it is evident that Phobos goes round the planet\nthree times in the course of a single Martian day and night, rising,\ncontrary to the general motion of the heavens, in the west, running in a\nfew hours through all the phases that our moon exhibits in the course of\na month, and setting, where the sun and all the stars rise, in the east.\nDeimos, on the other hand, has a period of revolution five or six hours\nlonger than that of the planet's axial rotation, so that it rises, like\nthe other heavenly bodies, in the east; but, because its motion is so\nnearly equal, in angular velocity, to that of Mars's rotation, it shifts\nvery slowly through the sky toward the west, and for two or three\nsuccessive days and nights it remains above the horizon, the sun\novertaking and passing it again and again, while, in the meantime, its\nprotean face swiftly changes from full circle to half-moon, from\nhalf-moon to crescent, from crescent back to half, and from half to\nfull, and so on without ceasing.\n\nAnd during this time Phobos is rushing through the sky in the opposite\ndirection, as if in defiance of the fundamental law of celestial\nrevolution, making a complete circuit three times every twenty-four\nhours, and changing the shape of its disk four times as rapidly as\nDeimos does! Truly, if we were suddenly transported to Mars, we might\nwell believe that we had arrived in the mother world of lunatics, and\nthat its two moons were bewitched. Yet it must not be supposed that all\nthe peculiarities just mentioned would be clearly seen from the surface\nof Mars by eyes like ours. The phases of Phobos would probably be\ndiscernible to the naked eye, but those of Deimos would require a\ntelescope in order to be seen, for, notwithstanding their nearness to\nthe planet, Mars's moons are inconspicuous phenomena even to the\nMartians themselves. Professor Young's estimate is that Phobos may shed\nupon Mars one-sixtieth and Deimos one-twelve-hundredth as much reflected\nmoonlight as our moon sends to the earth. Accordingly, a \"moonlit night\"\non Mars can have no such charm as we associate with the phrase. But it\nis surely a tribute to the power and perfection of our telescopes that\nwe have been able to discover the existence of objects so minute and\ninconspicuous, situated at a distance of many millions of miles, and\nhalf concealed by the glaring light of the planet close around which\nthey revolve.\n\nIf Mars's moons were as massive as our moon is they would raise\ntremendous tides upon Mars, and would affect the circulation of water in\nthe canals, but, in fact, their tidal effects are even more\ninsignificant than their light-giving powers. But for astronomers on\nMars they would be objects of absorbing interest.\n\nUpon quitting Mars we pass to the second distinctive planetary group of\nthe solar system, that of the asteroids.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nTHE ASTEROIDS, A FAMILY OF DWARF WORLDS\n\n\nBeyond Mars, in the broad gap separating the terrestrial from the Jovian\nplanets, are the asteroids, of which nearly five hundred have been\ndiscovered and designated by individual names or numbers. But any\nstatement concerning the known number of asteroids can remain valid for\nbut a short time, because new ones are continually found, especially by\nthe aid of photography. Very few of the asteroids are of measurable\nsize. Among these are the four that were the first to be\ndiscovered--Ceres, Pallas, Juno, and Vesta. Their diameters, according\nto the measurements of Prof. E.E. Barnard, of the Yerkes Observatory,\nare as follows: Ceres, 477 miles; Pallas, 304 miles; Juno, 120 miles;\nVesta, 239 miles.\n\nIt is only necessary to mention these diameters in order to indicate how\nwide is the difference between the asteroids and such planets as the\nearth, Venus, or Mars. The entire surface of the largest asteroid,\nCeres, does not equal the republic of Mexico in area. But Ceres itself\nis gigantic in comparison with the vast majority of the asteroids, many\nof which, it is believed, do not exceed twenty miles in diameter, while\nthere may be hundreds or thousands of others still smaller--ten miles,\nfive miles, or perhaps only a few rods, in diameter!\n\nCuriously enough, the asteroid which appears brightest, and which it\nwould naturally be inferred is the largest, really stands third in the\norder of measured size. This is Vesta, whose diameter, according to\nBarnard, is only 239 miles. It is estimated that the surface of Vesta\npossesses about four times greater light-reflecting power than the\nsurface of Ceres. Some observations have also shown a variation in the\nintensity of the light from Vesta, a most interesting fact, which\nbecomes still more significant when considered in connection with the\ngreat variability of another most extraordinary member of the asteroidal\nfamily, Eros, which is to be described presently.\n\nThe orbits of the asteroids are scattered over a zone about 200,000,000\nmiles broad. The mean distance from the sun of the nearest asteroid,\nEros, is 135,000,000 miles, and that of the most distant, Thule,\n400,000,000 miles. Wide gaps exist in the asteroidal zone where few or\nno members of the group are to be found, and Prof. Daniel Kirkwood long\nago demonstrated the influence of Jupiter in producing these gaps.\nAlmost no asteroids, as he showed, revolve at such a distance from the\nsun that their periods of revolution are exactly commensurable with that\nof Jupiter. Originally there may have been many thus situated, but the\nattraction of the great planet has, in the course of time, swept those\nzones clean.\n\nMany of the asteroids have very eccentric orbits, and their orbits are\ncuriously intermixed, varying widely among themselves, both in\nellipticity and in inclination to the common plane of the solar system.\n\nConsidered with reference to the shape and position of its orbit, the\nmost unique of these little worlds is Eros, which was discovered in 1898\nby De Witt, at Berlin, and which, on account of its occasional near\napproach to the earth, has lately been utilized in a fresh attempt to\nobtain a closer approximation to the true distance of the sun from the\nearth. The mean distance of Eros from the sun is 135,000,000 miles, its\ngreatest distance is 166,000,000 miles, and its least distance\n105,000,000 miles. It will thus be seen that, although all the other\nasteroids are situated beyond Mars, Eros, at its mean distance, is\nnearer to the sun than Mars is. When in aphelion, or at its greatest\ndistance, Eros is outside of the orbit of Mars, but when in perihelion\nit is so much inside of Mars's orbit that it comes surprisingly near the\nearth.\n\nIndeed, there are times when Eros is nearer to the earth than any other\ncelestial body ever gets except the moon--and, it might be added,\nexcept meteors and, by chance, a comet, or a comet's tail. Its least\npossible distance from the earth is less than 14,000,000 miles, and it\nwas nearly as close as that, without anybody knowing or suspecting the\nfact, in 1894, four years in advance of its discovery. Yet the fact,\nstrange as the statement may seem, had been recorded without being\nrecognized. After De Witt's discovery of Eros in 1898, at a time when it\nwas by no means as near the earth as it had been some years before,\nProf. E.C. Pickering ascertained that it had several times imprinted its\nimage on the photographic plates of the Harvard Observatory, with which\npictures of the sky are systematically taken, but had remained\nunnoticed, or had been taken for an ordinary star among the thousands of\nstar images surrounding it. From these telltale plates it was\nascertained that in 1894 it had been in perihelion very near the earth,\nand had shone with the brilliance of a seventh-magnitude star.\n\nIt will, unfortunately, be a long time before Eros comes quite as near\nus as it did on that occasion, when we failed to see it, for its close\napproaches to the earth are not frequent. Prof. Solon I. Bailey selects\nthe oppositions of Eros in 1931 and 1938 as probably the most favorable\nthat will occur during the first half of the twentieth century.\n\nWe turn to the extraordinary fluctuations in the light of Eros, and the\nequally extraordinary conclusions drawn from them. While the little\nasteroid, whose diameter is estimated to be in the neighborhood of\ntwenty or twenty-five miles, was being assiduously watched and\nphotographed during its opposition in the winter of 1900-1901, several\nobservers discovered that its light was variable to the extent of more\nthan a whole magnitude; some said as much as two magnitudes. When it is\nremembered that an increase of one stellar magnitude means an accession\nof light in the ratio of 2.5 to 1, and an increase of two magnitudes an\naccession of 6.25 to 1, the significance of such variations as Eros\nexhibited becomes immediately apparent. The shortness of the period\nwithin which the cycle of changes occurred, about two hours and a half,\nmade the variation more noticeable, and at the same time suggested a\nready explanation, viz., that the asteroid was rapidly turning on its\naxis, a thing, in itself, quite in accordance with the behavior of other\ncelestial bodies and naturally to be expected.\n\nBut careful observation showed that there were marked irregularities in\nthe light fluctuations, indicating that Eros either had a very strange\ndistribution of light and dark areas covering its surface, or that\ninstead of being a globular body it was of some extremely irregular\nshape, so that as it rotated it presented successively larger and\nsmaller reflecting surfaces toward the sun and the earth. One\ninteresting suggestion was that the little planet is in reality double,\nthe two components revolving around their common center of gravity, like\na close binary star, and mutually eclipsing one another. But this theory\nseems hardly competent to explain the very great fluctuation in light,\nand a better one, probably, is that suggested by Prof. E.C. Pickering,\nthat Eros is shaped something like a dumb-bell.\n\nWe can picture such a mass, in imagination, tumbling end over end in its\norbit so as to present at one moment the broad sides of both bells,\ntogether with their connecting neck, toward the sun, and, at the same\ntime, toward the observer on the earth, and, at another moment, only the\nend of one of the bells, the other bell and the neck being concealed in\nshadow. In this way the successive gain and loss of sixfold in the\namount of light might be accounted for. Owing to the great distance the\nreal form of the asteroid is imperceptible even with powerful\ntelescopes, but the effect of a change in the amount of reflecting\nsurface presented produces, necessarily, an alternate waxing and waning\nof the light. As far as the fluctuations are concerned, they might also\nbe explained by supposing that the shape of the asteroid is that of a\nflat disk, rotating about one of its larger diameters so as to present,\nalternately, its edge and its broadside to the sun. And, perhaps, in\norder completely to account for all the observed eccentricities of the\nlight of Eros, the irregularity of form may have to be supplemented by\ncertain assumptions as to the varying reflective capacity of different\nparts of the misshapen mass.\n\nThe invaluable Harvard photographs show that long before Eros was\nrecognized as an asteroid its light variations had been automatically\nregistered on the plates. Some of the plates, Prof. E.C. Pickering says,\nhad had an exposure of an hour or more, and, owing to its motion, Eros\nhad formed a trail on each of these plates, which in some cases showed\ndistinct variations in brightness. Differences in the amount of\nvariation at different times will largely depend upon the position of\nthe earth with respect to the axis of rotation.\n\nAnother interesting deduction may be made from the changes that the\nlight of Eros undergoes. We have already remarked that one of the larger\nasteroids, and the one which appears to the eye as the most brilliant\nof all, Vesta, has been suspected of variability, but not so extensive\nas that of Eros. Olbers, at the beginning of the last century, was of\nthe opinion that Vesta's variations were due to its being not a globe\nbut an angular mass. So he was led by a similar phenomenon to precisely\nthe same opinion about Vesta that has lately been put forth concerning\nEros. The importance of this coincidence is that it tends to revive a\nremarkable theory of the origin of the asteroids which has long been in\nabeyance, and, in the minds of many, perhaps discredited.\n\nThis theory, which is due to Olbers, begins with the startling\nassumption that a planet, perhaps as large as Mars, formerly revolving\nin an orbit situated between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, was\ndestroyed by an explosion! Although, at first glance, such a catastrophe\nmay appear too wildly improbable for belief, yet it was not the\nimprobability of a world's blowing up that led to a temporary\nabandonment of Olbers's bold theory. The great French mathematician\nLagrange investigated the explosive force \"which would be necessary to\ndetach a fragment of matter from a planet revolving at a given distance\nfrom the sun,\" and published the results in the Connaissance des Temps\nfor 1814.\n\n\"Applying his results to the earth, Lagrange found that if the velocity\nof the detached fragment exceeded that of a cannon ball in the\nproportion of 121 to 1 the fragment would become a comet with a direct\nmotion; but if the velocity rose in the proportion of 156 to 1 the\nmotion of the comet would be retrograde. If the velocity was less than\nin either of these cases the fragment would revolve as a planet in an\nelliptic orbit. For any other planet besides the earth the velocity of\nexplosion corresponding to the different cases would vary in the inverse\nratio of the square root of the mean distance. It would therefore\nmanifestly be less as the planet was more distant from the sun. In the\ncase of each of the four smaller planets (only the four asteroids,\nCeres, Pallas, Juno, and Vesta, were known at that time), the velocity\nof explosion indicated by their observed motion would be less than\ntwenty times the velocity of a cannon ball.\"[6]\n\n[Footnote 6: Grant's History of Physical Astronomy, p. 241.]\n\nInstead, then, of being discredited by its assumption of so strange a\ncatastrophe, Olbers's theory fell into desuetude because of its apparent\nfailure to account for the position of the orbits of many of the\nasteroids after a large number of those bodies had been discovered. He\ncalculated that the orbits of all the fragments of his exploded planet\nwould have nearly equal mean distances, and a common point of\nintersection in the heavens, through which every fragment of the\noriginal mass would necessarily pass in each revolution. At first the\norbits of the asteroids discovered seemed to answer to these conditions,\nand Olbers was even able to use his theory as a means of predicting the\nposition of yet undetected asteroids. Only Ceres and Pallas had been\ndiscovered when he put forth his theory, but when Juno and Vesta were\nfound they fell in with his predictions so well that the theory was\ngenerally regarded as being virtually established; while the\nfluctuations in the light of Vesta, as we have before remarked, led\nOlbers to assert that that body was of a fragmental shape, thus strongly\nsupporting his explosion hypothesis.\n\nAfterward, when the orbits of many asteroids had been investigated, the\nsoundness of Olbers's theory began to be questioned. The fact that the\norbits did not all intersect at a common point could easily be disposed\nof, as Professor Newcomb has pointed out, by simply placing the date of\nthe explosion sufficiently far back, say millions of years ago, for the\nsecular changes produced by the attraction of the larger planets would\neffectively mix up the orbits. But when the actual effects of these\nsecular changes were calculated for particular asteroids the result\nseemed to show that \"the orbits could never have intersected unless some\nof them have in the meantime been altered by the attraction of the\nsmall planets on each other. Such an action is not impossible, but it is\nimpossible to determine it, owing to the great number of these bodies\nand our ignorance of their masses.\"[7]\n\n[Footnote 7: Popular Astronomy, by Simon Newcomb, p. 335.]\n\nYet the theory has never been entirely thrown out, and now that the\ndiscovery of the light fluctuations of Eros lends support to Olbers's\nassertion of the irregular shape of some of the asteroids, it is very\ninteresting to recall what so high an authority as Professor Young said\non the subject before the discovery of Eros:\n\n\"It is true, as has often been urged, that this theory in its original\nform, as presented by Olbers, can not be correct. No _single_ explosion\nof a planet could give rise to the present assemblage of orbits, nor is\nit possible that even the perturbations of Jupiter could have converted\na set of orbits originally all crossing at one point (the point of\nexplosion) into the present tangle. The smaller orbits are so small\nthat, however turned about, they lie wholly inside the larger and can\nnot be made to intersect them. If, however, we admit a _series_ of\nexplosions, this difficulty is removed; and if we grant an explosion at\nall, there seems to be nothing improbable in the hypothesis that the\nfragments formed by the bursting of the parent mass would carry away\nwithin themselves the same forces and reactions which caused the\noriginal bursting, so that they themselves would be likely enough to\nexplode at some time in their later history.\"[8]\n\n[Footnote 8: General Astronomy, by Charles A. Young. Revised edition,\n1898, p. 372.]\n\nThe rival theory of the origin of the asteroids is that which assumes\nthat the planetary ring originally left off from the contracting solar\nnebula between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter was so violently perturbed\nby the attraction of the latter planet that, instead of being shaped\ninto a single globe, it was broken up into many fragments. Either\nhypothesis presents an attractive picture; but that which presupposes\nthe bursting asunder of a large planet, which might at least have borne\nthe germs of life, and the subsequent shattering of its parts into\nsmaller fragments, like the secondary explosions of the pieces of a\npyrotechnic bomb, certainly is by far the more impressive in its appeal\nto the imagination, and would seem to offer excellent material for some\nof the extra-terrestrial romances now so popular. It is a startling\nthought that a world can possibly carry within itself, like a dynamite\ncartridge, the means of its own disruption; but the idea does not appear\nso extremely improbable when we recall the evidence of collisions or\nexplosions, happening on a tremendous scale, in the case of new or\ntemporary stars.[9]\n\n[Footnote 9: \"Since the discovery of Eros, the extraordinary position of\nits orbit has led to the suggestion that possibly Mars itself, instead\nof being regarded as primarily a major planet, belonging to the\nterrestrial group, ought rather to be considered as the greatest of the\nasteroids, and a part of the original body from which the asteroidal\nsystem was formed.\"--J. Bauschinger, Astronomische Nachrichten, No.\n3542.]\n\nComing to the question of life upon the asteroids, it seems clear that\nthey must be excluded from the list of habitable worlds, whatever we\nmay choose to think of the possible habitability of the original planet\nthrough whose destruction they may have come into existence. The largest\nof them possesses a force of gravity far too slight to enable it to\nretain any of the gases or vapors that are recognized as constituting an\natmosphere. But they afford a captivating field for speculation, which\nneed not be altogether avoided, for it offers some graphic illustrations\nof the law of gravitation. A few years ago I wrote, for the\nentertainment of an audience which preferred to meet science attired in\na garb woven largely from the strands of fancy, an account of some of\nthe peculiarities of such minute globes as the asteroids, which I\nreproduce here because it gives, perhaps, a livelier picture of those\nlittle bodies, from the point of view of ordinary human interest, than\ncould be presented in any other way.\n\n\nA WAIF OF SPACE\n\nOne night as I was waiting, watch in hand, for an occultation, and\nstriving hard to keep awake, for it had been a hot and exhausting\nsummer's day, while my wife--we were then in our honeymoon--sat\nsympathetically by my side, I suddenly found myself withdrawn from the\ntelescope, and standing in a place that appeared entirely strange. It\nwas a very smooth bit of ground, and, to my surprise, there was no\nhorizon in sight; that is to say, the surface of the ground disappeared\non all sides at a short distance off, and beyond nothing but sky was\nvisible. I thought I must be on the top of a stupendous mountain, and\nyet I was puzzled to understand how the face of the earth could be so\nfar withdrawn. Presently I became aware that there was some one by me\nwhom I could not see.\n\n\"You are not on a mountain,\" my companion said, and as he spoke a cold\nshiver ran along my back-bone; \"you are on an asteroid, one of those\nminiature planets, as you astronomers call them, and of which you have\ndiscovered several hundred revolving between the orbits of Mars and\nJupiter. This is the little globe that you have glimpsed occasionally\nwith your telescope, and that you, or some of your fellows, have been\nkind enough to name Menippe.\"\n\nThen I perceived that my companion, whose address had hardly been\nreassuring, was a gigantic inhabitant of the little planet, towering up\nto a height of three quarters of a mile. For a moment I was highly\namused, standing by his foot, which swelled up like a hill, and\nstraining my neck backward to get a look up along the precipice of his\nleg, which, curiously enough, I observed was clothed in rough homespun,\nthe woolly knots of the cloth appearing of tremendous size, while it\nbagged at the knee like any terrestrial trousers' leg. His great head\nand face I could see far above me, as it were, in the clouds. Yet I was\nnot at all astonished.\n\n\"This is all right,\" I said to myself. \"Of course on Menippe the people\nmust be as large as this, for the little planet is only a dozen miles\nin diameter, and the force of gravity is consequently so small that a\nman without loss of activity, or inconvenience, can grow three quarters\nof a mile tall.\"\n\nSuddenly an idea occurred to me. \"Just to think what a jump I can make!\nWhy, only the other day I was figuring it out that a man could easily\njump a thousand feet high from the surface of Menippe, and now here I\nactually am on Menippe. I'll jump.\"\n\nThe sensation of that glorious rise skyward was delightful beyond\nexpression. My legs seemed to have become as powerful as the engines of\na transatlantic liner, and with one spring I rose smoothly and swiftly,\nand as straight as an arrow, surmounting the giant's foot, passing his\nknee and attaining nearly to the level of his hip. Then I felt that the\nmomentum of my leap was exhausted, and despite my efforts I slowly\nturned head downward, glancing in affright at the ground a quarter of a\nmile below me, on which I expected to be dashed to pieces. But a\nmoment's thought convinced me that I should get no hurt, for with so\nslight a force of gravity it would be more like floating than falling.\nJust then the Menippean caught me with his monstrous hand and lifted me\nto the level of his face.\n\n\"I should like to know,\" I said, \"how you manage to live up here; you\nare so large and your planet is so little.\"\n\n\"Now, you are altogether too inquisitive,\" replied the giant. \"You go!\"\n\nHe stooped down, placed me on the toe of his boot, and drew back his\nfoot to kick me off.\n\nIt flashed into my mind that my situation had now become very serious. I\nknew well what the effects of the small attractive force of these\ndiminutive planets must be, for I had often amused myself with\ncalculations about them. In this moment of peril I did not forget my\nmathematics. It was clear that if the giant propelled me with sufficient\nvelocity I should be shot into space, never to return. How great would\nthat velocity have to be? My mind worked like lightning on this problem.\nThe diameter of Menippe I knew did not exceed twelve miles. Its mean\ndensity, as near as I could judge, was about the same as that of the\nearth. Its attraction must therefore be as its radius, or nearly 660\ntimes less than that of the earth. A well-known formula enables us to\ncompute the velocity a body would acquire in falling from an infinite\ndistance to the earth or any other planet whose size and force of\ngravity are known. The same formula, taken in the opposite sense, of\ncourse, shows how fast a body must start from a planet in order that it\nmay be freed from its control. The formula is V = square root of (2\ngr.), in which \"g\" is the acceleration of gravity, equal for the earth\nto 32 feet in a second, and \"r\" is the radius of the attracting body. On\nMenippe I knew \"g\" must equal about one twentieth of a foot, and \"r\"\n31,680 feet. Like a flash I applied the formula while the giant's\nmuscles were yet tightening for the kick: 31,680 \u00d7 1/20 \u00d7 2 = 3,168, the\nsquare root of which is a fraction more than 56. Fifty-six feet in a\nsecond, then, was the critical velocity with which I must be kicked off\nin order that I might never return. I perceived at once that the giant\nwould be able to accomplish it. I turned and shouted up at him:\n\n\"Hold on, I have something to say to you!\"\n\nI dimly saw his mountainous face puckered into mighty wrinkles, out of\nwhich his eyes glared fiercely, and the next moment I was sailing into\nspace. I could no more have kept a balance than the earth can stand\nstill upon its axis. I had become a small planet myself, and, like all\nplanets, I rotated. Yet the motion did not dizzy me, and soon I became\nintensely interested in the panorama of creation that was spread around\nme. For some time, whenever my face was turned toward the little globe\nof Menippe, I saw the giant, partly in profile against the sky, with his\nback bent and his hands upon his knees, watching me with an occasional\napproving nod of his big head. He looked so funny standing there on his\nlittle seven-by-nine world, like a clown on a performing ball, that,\ndespite my terrible situation, I shook my sides with laughter. There was\nno echo in the profundity of empty space.\n\nSoon Menippe dwindled to a point, and I saw her inhospitable inhabitant\nno more. Then I watched the sun and the blazing firmament around, for\nthere was at the same time broad day and midnight for me. The sunlight,\nbeing no longer diffused by an atmosphere, did not conceal the face of\nthe sky, and I could see the stars shining close to the orb of day. I\nrecognized the various planets much more easily than I had been\naccustomed to do, and, with a twinge at my heart, saw the earth\ntraveling along in its distant orbit, splendid in the sunshine. I\nthought of my wife sitting alone by the telescope in the darkness and\nsilence, wondering what had become of me. I asked myself, \"How in the\nworld can I ever get back there again?\" Then I smiled to think of the\nridiculous figure I cut, out here in space, exposed to the eyes of the\nuniverse, a rotating, gyrating, circumambulating astronomer, an\nanimated teetotum lost in the sky. I saw no reason to hope that I should\nnot go on thus forever, revolving around the sun until my bones,\nwhitening among the stars, might be revealed to the superlative powers\nof some future telescope, and become a subject of absorbing interest,\nthe topic of many a learned paper for the astronomers of a future age.\nAfterward I was comforted by the reflection that in airless space,\nalthough I might die and my body become desiccated, yet there could be\nno real decay; even my garments would probably last forever. The\n_savants_, after all, should never speculate on my bones.\n\nI saw the ruddy disk of Mars, and the glinting of his icy poles, as the\nbeautiful planet rolled far below me. \"If I could only get there,\" I\nthought, \"I should know what those canals of Schiaparelli are, and even\nif I could never return to the earth, I should doubtless meet with a\nwarm welcome among the Martians. What a lion I should be!\" I looked\nlongingly at the distant planet, the outlines of whose continents and\nseas appeared most enticing, but when I tried to propel myself in that\ndirection I only kicked against nothingness. I groaned in desperation.\n\nSuddenly something darted by me flying sunward; then another and\nanother. In a minute I was surrounded by strange projectiles. Every\ninstant I expected to be dashed in pieces by them. They sped with the\nvelocity of lightning. Hundreds, thousands of them were all about me. My\nchance of not being hit was not one in a million, and yet I escaped. The\nsweat of terror was upon me, but I did not lose my head. \"A comet has\nmet me,\" I said. \"These missiles are the meteoric stones of which it is\ncomposed.\" And now I noticed that as they rushed along collisions took\nplace, and flashes of electricity darted from one to another. A pale\nluminosity dimmed the stars. I did not doubt that, as seen from the\nearth, the comet was already flinging the splendors of its train upon\nthe bosom of the night.\n\nWhile I was wondering at my immunity amid such a rain of\ndeath-threatening bolts, I became aware that their velocity was sensibly\ndiminishing. This fact I explained by supposing that I was drawn along\nwith them. Notwithstanding the absence of any collision with my body,\nthe overpowering attraction of the whole mass of meteors was overcoming\nmy tangential force and bearing me in their direction. At first I\nrejoiced at this circumstance, for at any rate the comet would save me\nfrom the dreadful fate of becoming an asteroid. A little further\nreflection, however, showed me that I had gone from the frying-pan into\nthe fire. The direction of my expulsion from Menippe had been such that\nI had fallen into an orbit that would have carried me around the sun\nwithout passing very close to the solar body. Now, being swept along by\nthe comet, whose perihelion probably lay in the immediate neighborhood\nof the sun, I saw no way of escape from the frightful fate of being\nbroiled alive. Even where I was, the untempered rays of the sun scorched\nme, and I knew that within two or three hundred thousand miles of the\nsolar surface the heat must be sufficient to melt the hardest rocks. I\nwas aware that experiments with burning-glasses had sufficiently\ndemonstrated that fact.\n\nBut perforce I resigned myself to my fate. At any rate it would the\nsooner be all over. In fact, I almost forgot my awful situation in the\ninterest awakened by the phenomena of the comet. I was in the midst of\nits very head. I was one of its component particles. I was a meteor\namong a million millions of others. If I could only get back to the\nearth, what news could I not carry to Signor Schiaparelli and Mr.\nLockyer and Dr. Bredichin about the composition of comets! But, alas!\nthe world could never know what I now saw. Nobody on yonder gleaming\nearth, watching the magnificent advance of this \"specter of the skies,\"\nwould ever dream that there was a lost astronomer in its blazing head. I\nshould be burned and rent to pieces amid the terrors of its perihelion\npassage, and my fragments would be strewn along the comet's orbit, to\nbecome, in course of time, particles in a swarm of aerolites. Perchance,\nthrough the effects of some unforeseen perturbation, the earth might\nencounter that swarm. Thus only could I ever return to the bosom of my\nmother planet. I took a positive pleasure in imagining that one of my\ncalcined bones might eventually flash for a moment, a falling star, in\nthe atmosphere of the earth, leaving its atoms to slowly settle through\nthe air, until finally they rested in the soil from which they had\nsprung.\n\nFrom such reflections I was aroused by the approach of the crisis. The\nhead of the comet had become an exceedingly uncomfortable place. The\ncollisions among the meteors were constantly increasing in number and\nviolence. How I escaped destruction I could not comprehend, but in fact\nI was unconscious of danger from that source. I had become in spirit an\nactual component of the clashing, roaring mass. Tremendous sparks of\nelectricity, veritable lightning strokes, darted about me in every\ndirection, but I bore a charmed life. As the comet drew in nearer to\nthe sun, under the terrible stress of the solar attraction, the meteors\nseemed to crowd closer, crashing and grinding together, while the whole\nmass swayed and shrieked with the uproar of a million tormented devils.\nThe heat had become terrific. I saw stone and iron melted like snow and\ndissipated in steam. Stupendous jets of white-hot vapor shot upward,\nand, driven off by the electrical repulsion of the sun, streamed\nbackward into the tail.\n\nSuddenly I myself became sensible of the awful heat. It seemed without\nwarning to have penetrated my vitals. With a yell I jerked my feet from\na boiling rock and flung my arms despairingly over my head.\n\n\"You had better be careful,\" said my wife, \"or you'll knock over the\ntelescope.\"\n\nI rubbed my eyes, shook myself, and rose.\n\n\"I must have been dreaming,\" I said.\n\n\"I should think it was a very lively dream,\" she replied.\n\nI responded after the manner of a young man newly wed.\n\nAt this moment the occultation began.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nJUPITER, THE GREATEST OF KNOWN WORLDS\n\n\nWhen we are thinking of worlds, and trying to exalt the imagination with\nthem, it is well to turn to Jupiter, for there is a planet worth\npondering upon! A world thirteen hundred times as voluminous as the\nearth is a phenomenon calculated to make us feel somewhat as the\ninhabitant of a rural village does when his amazed vision ranges across\nthe million roofs of a metropolis. Jupiter is the first of the outer and\ngreater planets, the major, or Jovian, group. His mean diameter is\n86,500 miles, and his average girth more than 270,000 miles. An\ninhabitant of Jupiter, in making a trip around his planet, along any\ngreat circle of the sphere, would have to travel more than 30,000 miles\nfarther than the distance between the earth and the moon. The polar\ncompression of Jupiter, owing to his rapid rotation, amounts in the\naggregate to more than 5,000 miles, the equatorial diameter being 88,200\nmiles and the polar diameter 83,000 miles.\n\nJupiter's mean distance from the sun is 483,000,000 miles, and the\neccentricity of his orbit is sufficient to make this distance variable\nto the extent of 21,000,000 miles; but, in view of his great average\ndistance, the consequent variation in the amount of solar light and heat\nreceived by the planet is not of serious importance.\n\nWhen he is in opposition to the sun as seen from the earth Jupiter's\nmean distance from us is about 390,000,000 miles. His year, or period of\nrevolution about the sun, is somewhat less than twelve of our years\n(11.86 years). His axis is very nearly upright to the plane of his\norbit, so that, as upon Venus, there is practically no variation of\nseasons. Gigantic though he is in dimensions, Jupiter is the swiftest of\nall the planets in axial rotation. While the earth requires twenty-four\nhours to make a complete turn, Jupiter takes less than ten hours (nine\nhours fifty-five minutes), and a point on his equator moves, in\nconsequence of axial rotation, between 27,000 and 28,000 miles in an\nhour.\n\nThe density of the mighty planet is slight, only about one quarter of\nthe mean density of the earth and virtually the same as that of the sun.\nThis fact at once calls attention to a contrast between Jupiter and our\nglobe that is even more significant than their immense difference in\nsize. The force of gravity upon Jupiter's surface is more than two and a\nhalf times greater than upon the earth's surface (more accurately 2.65\ntimes), so that a hundred-pound weight removed from the planet on which\nwe live to Jupiter would there weigh 265 pounds, and an average man,\nsimilarly transported, would be oppressed with a weight of at least 400\npounds. But, as a result of the rapid rotation of the great planet, and\nthe ellipticity of its figure, the unfortunate visitor could find a\nperceptible relief from his troublesome weight by seeking the planet's\nequator, where the centrifugal tendency would remove about twenty pounds\nfrom every one hundred as compared with his weight at the poles.\n\nIf we could go to the moon, or to Mercury, Venus, or Mars, we may be\ncertain that upon reaching any of those globes we should find ourselves\nupon a solid surface, probably composed of rock not unlike the rocky\ncrust of the earth; but with Jupiter the case would evidently be very\ndifferent. As already remarked, the mean density of that planet is only\none quarter of the earth's density, or only one third greater than the\ndensity of water. Consequently the visitor, in attempting to set foot\nupon Jupiter, might find no solid supporting surface, but would be in a\nsituation as embarrassing as that of Milton's Satan when he undertook to\ncross the domain of Chaos:\n\n    \"Fluttering his pinions vain, plumb down he drops,\n    Ten thousand fathom deep, and to this hour\n    Down had been falling had not, by ill chance,\n    The strong rebuff of some tumultuous cloud.\n    Instinct with fire and niter, hurried him\n    As many miles aloft; that fury stayed,\n    Quenched in a boggy Syrtis, neither sea\n    Nor good dry land, nigh foundered, as he fares,\n    Treading the crude consistence, half on foot,\n    Half flying.\"\n\nThe probability that nothing resembling a solid crust, nor, perhaps,\neven a liquid shell, would be found at the visible surface of Jupiter,\nis increased by considering that the surface density must be much less\nthan the mean density of the planet taken as a whole, and since the\nlatter but little exceeds the density of water, it is likely that at the\nsurface everything is in a state resembling that of cloud or smoke. Our\nimaginary visitor upon reaching Jupiter would, under the influence of\nthe planet's strong force of gravity, drop out of sight, with the speed\nof a shot, swallowed up in the vast atmosphere of probably hot, and\nperhaps partially incandescent, gases. When he had sunk--supposing his\nidentity could be preserved--to a depth of thousands of miles he might\nnot yet have found any solid part of the planet; and, perchance, there\nis no solid nucleus even at the very center.\n\nThe cloudy aspect of Jupiter immediately strikes the telescopic\nobserver. The huge planet is filled with color, and with the animation\nof constant movement, but there is no appearance of markings, like those\non Mars, recalling the look of the earth. There are no white polar caps,\nand no shadings that suggest the outlines of continents and oceans. What\nevery observer, even with the smallest telescope, perceives at once is a\npair of strongly defined dark belts, one on either side of, and both\nparallel to, the planet's equator. These belts are dark compared with\nthe equatorial band between them and with the general surface of the\nplanet toward the north and the south, but they are not of a gray or\nneutral shade. On the contrary, they show decided, and, at times,\nbrilliant colors, usually of a reddish tone. More delicate tints,\nsometimes a fine pink, salmon, or even light green, are occasionally to\nbe seen about the equatorial zone, and the borders of the belts, while\nnear the poles the surface is shadowed with bluish gray, imperceptibly\ndeepening from the lighter hues of the equator.\n\nAll this variety of tone and color makes of a telescopic view of Jupiter\na picture that will not quickly fade from the memory; while if an\ninstrument of considerable power is used, so that the wonderful details\nof the belts, with their scalloped edges, their diagonal filaments,\ntheir many divisions, and their curious light and dark spots, are made\nplain, the observer is deeply impressed with the strangeness of the\nspectacle, and the more so as he reflects upon the enormous real\nmagnitude of that which is spread before his eye. The whole earth\nflattened out would be but a small blotch on that gigantic disk!\n\nThen, the visible rotation of the great Jovian globe, whose effects\nbecome evident to a practised eye after but a few minutes' watching,\nheightens the impression. And the presence of the four satellites, whose\nmotions in their orbits are also evident, through the change in their\npositions, during the course of a single not prolonged observation,\nadds its influence to the effectiveness of the scene. Indeed, color and\nmotion are so conspicuous in the immense spectacle presented by Jupiter\nthat they impart to it a powerful suggestion of life, which the mind\ndoes not readily divest itself of when compelled to face the evidence\nthat Jupiter is as widely different from the earth, and as diametrically\nopposed to lifelike conditions, as we comprehend them, as a planet\npossibly could be.\n\nThe great belts lie in latitudes about corresponding to those in which\nthe trade-winds blow upon the earth, and it has often been suggested\nthat their existence indicates a similarity between the atmospheric\ncirculation of Jupiter and that of the world in which we live. No doubt\nthere are times when the earth, seen with a telescope from a distant\nplanet, would present a belted appearance somewhat resembling that of\nJupiter, but there would almost certainly be no similar display of\ncolors in the clouds, and the latter would exhibit no such persistence\nin general form and position as characterizes those of Jupiter. Our\nclouds are formed by the action of the sun, producing evaporation of\nwater; on Jupiter, whose mean distance from the sun is more than five\ntimes as great as ours, the intensity of the solar rays is reduced to\nless than one twenty-fifth part of their intensity on the earth, so that\nthe evaporation can not be equally active there, and the tendency to\nform aerial currents and great systems of winds must be proportionally\nslight. In brief, the clouds of Jupiter are probably of an entirely\ndifferent origin from that of terrestrial clouds, and rather resemble\nthe chaotic masses of vapor that enveloped the earth when it was still\nin a seminebulous condition, and before its crust had formed.\n\nAlthough the strongest features of the disk of Jupiter are the great\ncloud belts, and the white or colored spots in the equatorial zone, yet\nthe telescope shows many markings north and south of the belts,\nincluding a number of narrower and fainter belts, and small light or\ndark spots. None of them is absolutely fixed in position with\nreference to others. In other words, all of the spots, belts, and\nmarkings shift their places to a perceptible extent, the changes being\ngenerally very slow and regular, but occasionally quite rapid. The main\nbelts never entirely disappear, and never depart very far from their\nmean positions with respect to the equator, but the smaller belts toward\nthe north and south are more or less evanescent. Round or oblong spots,\nas distinguished from belts, are still more variable and transient. The\nmain belts themselves show great internal commotion, frequently\nsplitting up, through a considerable part of their length, and sometimes\napparently throwing out projections into the lighter equatorial zone,\nwhich occasionally resemble bridges, diagonally spanning the broad space\nbetween the belts.\n\n[Illustration: JUPITER AS SEEN AT THE LICK OBSERVATORY IN 1889. THE\nGREAT RED SPOT IS VISIBLE, TOGETHER WITH THE INDENTATION IN THE SOUTH\nBELT.]\n\nPerhaps the most puzzling phenomenon that has ever made its appearance\non Jupiter is the celebrated \"great red spot,\" which was first noticed\nin 1878, although it has since been shown to be probably identical with\na similar spot seen in 1869, and possibly with one noticed in 1857.\nThis spot, soon after its discovery in 1878, became a clearly defined\nred oval, lying near the southern edge of the south belt in latitude\nabout 30\u00b0. Its length was nearly one third of the diameter of the disk\nand its width almost one quarter as great as its length. Translated into\nterrestrial measure, it was about 30,000 miles long and 7,000 miles\nbroad.\n\nIn 1879 it seemed to deepen in color until it became a truly wonderful\nobject, its redness of hue irresistibly suggesting the idea that it was\nsomething hot and glowing. During the following years it underwent\nvarious changes of appearance, now fading almost to invisibility and now\nbrightening again, but without ever completely vanishing, and it is\nstill (1901) faintly visible.\n\nNobody has yet suggested an altogether probable and acceptable theory as\nto its nature. Some have said that it might be a part of the red-hot\ncrust of the planet elevated above the level of the clouds; others that\nits appearance might be due to the clearing off of the clouds above a\nheated region of the globe beneath, rendering the latter visible through\nthe opening; others that it was perhaps a mass of smoke and vapor\nejected from a gigantic volcano, or from the vents covering a broad area\nof volcanic action; others that it might be a vast incandescent slag\nfloating upon the molten globe of the planet and visible through, or\nabove, the enveloping clouds; and others have thought that it could be\nnothing but a cloud among clouds, differing, for unknown reasons, in\ncomposition and cohesion from its surroundings. All of these hypotheses\nexcept the last imply the existence, just beneath the visible cloud\nshell, of a more or less stable and continuous surface, either solid or\nliquid.\n\nWhen the red spot began to lose distinctness a kind of veil seemed to be\ndrawn over it, as if light clouds, floating at a superior elevation, had\ndrifted across it. At times it has been reduced in this manner to a\nfaint oval ring, the rim remaining visible after the central part has\nfaded from sight.\n\nOne of the most remarkable phenomena connected with the mysterious spot\nis a great bend, or scallop, in the southern edge of the south belt\nadjacent to the spot. This looks as if it were produced by the spot, or\nby the same cause to which the spot owes its existence. If the spot were\nan immense mountainous elevation, and the belt a current of liquid, or\nof clouds, flowing past its base, one would expect to see some such bend\nin the stream. The visual evidence that the belt is driven, or forced,\naway from the neighborhood of the spot seems complete. The appearance of\nrepulsion between them is very striking, and even when the spot fades\nnearly to invisibility the curve remains equally distinct, so that in\nusing a telescope too small to reveal the spot itself one may discover\nits location by observing the bow in the south belt. The suggestion of a\nresemblance to the flowing of a stream past the foot of an elevated\npromontory, or mountain, is strengthened by the fact, which was\nobserved early in the history of the spot, that markings involved in the\nsouth belt have a quicker rate of rotation about the planet's axis than\nthat of the red spot, so that such markings, first seen in the rear of\nthe red spot, gradually overtake and pass it, and eventually leave it\nbehind, as boats in a river drift past a rock lying in the midst of the\ncurrent.\n\nThis leads us to another significant fact concerning the peculiar\ncondition of Jupiter's surface. Not only does the south belt move\nperceptibly faster than the red spot, but, generally speaking, the\nvarious markings on the surface of the planet move at different rates\naccording as they are nearer to or farther from the equator. Between the\nequator and latitude 30\u00b0 or 40\u00b0 there is a difference of six minutes in\nthe rotation period--i.e., the equatorial parts turn round the axis so\nmuch faster than the parts north and south of them, that in one rotation\nthey gain six minutes of time. In other words, the clouds over Jupiter's\nequator flow past those in the middle latitudes with a relative\nvelocity of 270 miles per hour. But there are no sharp lines of\nseparation between the different velocities; on the contrary, the\nswiftness of rotation gradually diminishes from the equator toward the\npoles, as it manifestly could not do if the visible surface of Jupiter\nwere solid.\n\nIn this respect Jupiter resembles the sun, whose surface also has\ndifferent rates of rotation diminishing from the equator. Measured by\nthe motion of spots on or near the equator, Jupiter's rotation period is\nabout nine hours fifty minutes; measured by the motion of spots in the\nmiddle latitudes, it is about nine hours fifty-six minutes. The red spot\ncompletes a rotation in a little less than nine hours and fifty-six\nminutes, but its period can not be positively given for the singular\nreason that it is variable. The variation amounts to only a few seconds\nin the course of several years, but it is nevertheless certain. The\nphenomenon of variable motion is not, however, peculiar to the red spot.\nMr. W.F. Denning, who has studied Jupiter for a quarter of a century,\nsays:\n\n\"It is well known that in different latitudes of Jupiter there are\ncurrents, forming the belts and zones, moving at various rates of speed.\nIn many instances the velocity changes from year to year. And it is a\nsingular circumstance that in the same current a uniform motion is not\nmaintained in all parts of the circumference. Certain spots move faster\nthan others, so that if we would obtain a fair value for the rotation\nperiod of any current it is not sufficient to derive it from one marking\nalone; we must follow a number of objects distributed in different\nlongitudes along the current and deduce a mean from the whole.\"[10]\n\n[Footnote 10: The Observatory, No. 286, December, 1899.]\n\nNor is this all. Observation indicates that if we could look at a\nvertical section of Jupiter's atmosphere we should behold an equally\nremarkable contrast and conflict of motions. There is evidence that some\nof the visible spots, or clouds, lie at a greater elevation than others,\nand it has been observed that the deeper ones move more rapidly. This\nfact has led some observers to conclude that the deep-lying spots may be\na part of the actual surface of the planet. But if we could think that\nthere is any solid nucleus, or core, in the body of Jupiter, it would\nseem, on account of the slight mean density of the planet, that it can\nnot lie so near the visible surface, but must be at a depth of\nthousands, perhaps tens of thousands, of miles. Since the telescope is\nunable to penetrate the cloudy envelope we can only guess at the actual\nconstitution of the interior of Jupiter's globe. In a spirit of mere\nspeculative curiosity it has been suggested that deep under the clouds\nof the great planet there may be a comparatively small solid globe, even\na habitable world, closed round by a firmament all its own, whose vault,\nraised 30,000 or 40,000 miles above the surface of the imprisoned\nplanet, appears only an unbroken dome, too distant to reveal its real\nnature to watchers below, except, perhaps, under telescopic scrutiny;\nenclosing, as in a shell, a transparent atmosphere, and deriving its\nillumination partly from the sunlight that may filter through, but\nmainly from some luminous source within.\n\nBut is not Jupiter almost equally fascinating to the imagination, if we\ndismiss all attempts to picture a humanly impossible world shut up\nwithin it, and turn rather to consider what its future may be, guided by\nthe not unreasonable hypothesis that, because of its immense size and\nmass, it is still in a chaotic condition? Mention has been made of the\nresemblance of Jupiter to the sun by virtue of their similar manner of\nrotation. This is not the only reason for looking upon Jupiter as being,\nin some respects, almost as much a solar as a planetary body. Its\nexceptional brightness rather favors the view that a small part of the\nlight by which it shines comes from its own incandescence. In size and\nmass it is half-way between the earth and the sun. Jupiter is eleven\ntimes greater than the earth in diameter and thirteen hundred times\ngreater in volume; the sun is ten times greater than Jupiter in diameter\nand a thousand times greater in volume. The mean density of Jupiter, as\nwe have seen, is almost exactly the same as the sun's.\n\nNow, the history of the solar system, according to the nebular\nhypothesis, is a history of cooling and condensation. The sun, a\nthousand times larger than Jupiter, has not yet sufficiently cooled and\ncontracted to become incrusted, except with a shell of incandescent\nmetallic clouds; Jupiter, a thousand times smaller than the sun, has\ncooled and contracted until it is but slightly, if at all, incandescent\nat its surface, while its thickening shell, although still composed of\nvapor and smoke, and still probably hot, has grown so dense that it\nentirely cuts off the luminous radiation from within; the earth, to\ncarry the comparison one step further, being more than a thousand times\nsmaller than Jupiter, has progressed so far in the process of cooling\nthat its original shell of vapor has given place to one of solid rock.\n\nA sudden outburst of light from Jupiter, such as occurs occasionally in\na star that is losing its radiance through the condensation of\nabsorbing vapors around it, would furnish strong corroboration of the\ntheory that Jupiter is really an extinguished sun which is now on the\nway to become a planet in the terrestrial sense.\n\nNot very long ago, as time is reckoned in astronomy, our sun, viewed\nfrom the distance of the nearer fixed stars, may have appeared as a\nbinary star, the brighter component of the pair being the sun itself and\nthe fainter one the body now called the planet Jupiter. Supposing the\nlatter to have had the same intrinsic brilliance, surface for surface,\nas the sun, it would have radiated one hundred times less light than the\nsun. A difference of one hundredfold between the light of two stars\nmeans that they are six magnitudes apart; or, in other words, from a\npoint in space where the sun appeared as bright as what we call a\nfirst-magnitude star, its companion, Jupiter, would have shone as a\nsixth-magnitude star. Many stars have companions proportionally much\nfainter than that. The companion of Sirius, for instance, is at least\nten thousand times less bright than its great comrade.\n\nLooking at Jupiter in this way, it interests us not as the probable\nabode of intelligent life, but as a world in the making, a world,\nmoreover, which, when it is completed--if it ever shall be after the\nterrestrial pattern--will dwarf our globe into insignificance. That\nstupendous miracle of world-making which is dimly painted in the grand\nfigures employed by the writers of Genesis, and the composers of other\ncosmogonic legends, is here actually going on before our eyes. The\ntelescope shows us in the cloudy face of Jupiter the moving of the\nspirit upon the face of the great deep. What the final result will be we\ncan not tell, but clearly the end of the grand processes there in\noperation has not yet been reached.\n\nThe interesting suggestion was made and urged by Mr. Proctor that if\nJupiter itself is in no condition at present to bear life, its\nsatellites may be, in that respect, more happily circumstanced. It can\nnot be said that very much has been learned about the satellites of\nJupiter since Proctor's day, and his suggestion is no less and no more\nprobable now than it was when first offered.\n\nThere has been cumulative evidence that Jupiter's satellites obey the\nsame law that governs the rotation of our moon, viz., that which compels\nthem always to keep the same face turned toward their primary, and this\nwould clearly affect, although it might not preclude, their\nhabitability. With the exception of the minute fifth satellite\ndiscovered by Barnard in 1892, they are all of sufficient size to retain\nat least some traces of an atmosphere. In fact, one of them is larger\nthan the planet Mars, and another is of nearly the same size as that\nplanet, while the smallest of the four principal ones is about equal to\nour moon. Under the powerful attraction of Jupiter they travel rapidly,\nand viewed from the surface of that planet they would offer a wonderful\nspectacle.\n\nThey are continually causing solar eclipses and themselves undergoing\neclipse in Jupiter's shadow, and their swiftly changing aspects and\ngroupings would be watched by an astronomer on Jupiter with undying\ninterest.\n\nBut far more wonderful would be the spectacle presented by Jupiter to\ninhabitants dwelling on his moons. From the nearer moon, in particular,\nwhich is situated less than 220,000 miles from Jupiter's surface, the\ngreat planet would be an overwhelming phenomenon in the sky.\n\nIts immense disk, hanging overhead, would cover a circle of the\nfirmament twenty degrees in diameter, or, in round numbers, forty times\nthe diameter of the full moon as seen from the earth! It would shed a\ngreat amount of light and heat, and thus would more or less effectively\nsupply the deficit of solar radiation, for we must remember that Jupiter\nand his satellites receive from the sun less than one twenty-fifth as\nmuch light and heat as the earth receives.\n\nThe maze of contending motions, the rapid flow and eddying of cloud\nbelts, the outburst of strange fiery spots, the display of rich, varied,\nand constantly changing colors, which astonish and delight the\ntelescopic observer on the earth, would be exhibited to the naked eye of\nan inhabitant of Jupiter's nearest moon far more clearly than the\ngreatest telescope is able to reveal them to us.\n\nHere, again, the mind is carried back to long past ages in the history\nof the planet on which we dwell. It is believed by some that our moon\nmay have contained inhabitants when the earth was still hot and glowing,\nas Jupiter appears to be now, and that, as the earth cooled and became\nhabitable, the moon gradually parted with its atmosphere and water so\nthat its living races perished almost coincidently with the beginning of\nlife on the earth. If we accept this view and apply it to the case of\nJupiter we may conclude that when that enormous globe has cooled and\nsettled down to a possibly habitable condition, its four attendant moons\nwill suffer the fate that overtook the earth's satellite, and in their\nturn become barren and death-stricken, while the great orb that once\nnurtured them with its light and heat receives the Promethean fire and\nbegins to bloom with life.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nSATURN, A PRODIGY AMONG PLANETS\n\n\nOne of the first things that persons unaccustomed to astronomical\nobservations ask to see when they have an opportunity to look through a\ntelescope is the planet Saturn. Many telescopic views in the heavens\ndisappoint the beginner, but that of Saturn does not. Even though the\nplanet may not look as large as he expects to see it from what he has\nbeen told of the magnifying power employed, the untrained observer is\nsure to be greatly impressed by the wonderful rings, suspended around it\nas if by a miracle. No previous inspection of pictures of these rings\ncan rob them of their effect upon the eye and the mind. They are\noverwhelming in their inimitable singularity, and they leave every\nspectator truly amazed. Sir John Herschel has remarked that they have\nthe appearance of an \"elaborately artificial mechanism.\" They have even\nbeen regarded as habitable bodies! What we are to think of that\nproposition we shall see when we come to consider their composition and\nprobable origin. In the meantime let us recall the main facts of\nSaturn's dimensions and situation in the solar system.\n\nSaturn is the second of the major, or Jovian, group of planets, and is\nsituated at a mean distance from the sun of 886,000,000 miles. We need\nnot consider the eccentricity of its orbit, which, although relatively\nnot very great, produces a variation of 50,000,000 miles in its distance\nfrom the sun, because, at its immense mean distance, this change would\nnot be of much importance with regard to the planet's habitability or\nnon-habitability. Under the most favorable conditions Saturn can never\nbe nearer than 744,000,000 miles to the earth, or eight times the sun's\ndistance from us. It receives from the sun about one ninetieth of the\nlight and heat that we get.\n\n[Illustration: SATURN IN ITS THREE PRINCIPAL PHASES AS SEEN FROM THE\nEARTH. From a drawing by Bond.]\n\nSaturn takes twenty-nine and a half years to complete a journey about\nthe sun. Like Jupiter, it rotates very rapidly on its axis, the period\nbeing ten hours and fourteen minutes. Its axis of rotation is inclined\nnot far from the same angle as that of the earth's axis (26\u00b0 49\u00b4), so\nthat its seasons should resemble ours, although their alternations are\nextremely slow in consequence of the enormous length of Saturn's year.\n\nNot including the rings in the calculation, Saturn exceeds the earth in\nsize 760 times. The addition of the rings would not, however, greatly\nalter the result of the comparison, because, although the total surface\nof the rings, counting both faces, exceeds the earth's surface about 160\ntimes, their volume, owing to their surprising thinness, is only about\nsix times the volume of the earth, and their mass, in consequence of\ntheir slight density, is very much less than the earth's, perhaps,\nindeed, inappreciable in comparison.\n\nSaturn's mean diameter is 73,000 miles, and its polar compression is\neven greater than that of Jupiter, a difference of 7,000 miles--almost\ncomparable with the entire diameter of the earth--existing between its\nequatorial and its polar diameter, the former being 75,000 and the\nlatter 68,000 miles.\n\nWe found the density of Jupiter astonishingly slight, but that of Saturn\nis slighter still. Jupiter would sink if thrown into water, but Saturn\nwould actually float, if not \"like a cork,\" yet quite as buoyantly as\nmany kinds of wood, for its mean density is only three quarters that of\nwater, or one eighth of the earth's. In fact, there is no known planet\nwhose density is so slight as Saturn's. Thus it happens that,\nnotwithstanding its vast size and mass, the force of gravity upon Saturn\nis nearly the same as upon our globe. Upon visiting Venus we should find\nourselves weighing a little less than at home, and upon visiting Saturn\na little more, but in neither case would the difference be very\nimportant. If the relative weight of bodies on the surfaces of planets\nformed the sole test of their habitability, Venus and Saturn would both\nrank with the earth as suitable abodes for men.\n\nBut the exceedingly slight density of Saturn seems to be most reasonably\naccounted for on the supposition that, like Jupiter, it is in a vaporous\ncondition, still very hot within--although but slightly, if at all,\nincandescent at the surface--and, therefore, unsuited to contain life.\nIt is hardly worth while to speculate about any solid nucleus within,\nbecause, even if such a thing were possible, or probable, it must lie\nforever hidden from our eyes. But if we accept the theory that Saturn is\nin an early formative stage, and that, millions of years hence, it may\nbecome an incrusted and habitable globe, we shall, at least, follow the\nanalogy of what we believe to have been the history of the earth, except\nthat Saturn's immense distance from the sun will always prevent it from\nreceiving an amount of solar radiation consistent with our ideas of what\nis required by a living world. Of course, since one can imagine what he\nchooses, it is possible to suppose inhabitants suited to existence in a\nworld composed only of whirling clouds, and a poet with the imagination\nof a Milton might give us very imposing and stirring images of such\ncreatures and their chaotic surroundings, but fancies like these can\nhave no basis in human experience, and consequently can make no claim\nupon scientific recognition.\n\nOr, as an alternative, it might be assumed that Saturn is composed of\nlighter elements and materials than those which constitute the earth and\nthe other solid planets in the more immediate neighborhood of the sun.\nBut such an assumption would put us entirely at sea as regards the forms\nof organic life that could exist upon a planet of that description, and,\nlike Sir Humphry Davy in the Vision, that occupies the first chapter of\nhis quaintly charming Consolations in Travel, or, the Last Days of a\nPhilosopher, we should be thrown entirely upon the resources of the\nimagination in representing to ourselves the nature and appearance of\nits inhabitants. Yet minds of unquestioned power and sincerity have in\nall ages found pleasure and even profit in such exercises, and with\nevery fresh discovery arises a new flight of fancies like butterflies\nfrom a roadside pool. As affording a glimpse into the mind of a\nremarkable man, as well as a proof of the fascination of such subjects,\nit will be interesting to quote from the book just mentioned Davy's\ndescription of his imaginary inhabitants of Saturn:\n\n\"I saw below me a surface infinitely diversified, something like that of\nan immense glacier covered with large columnar masses, which appeared as\nif formed of glass, and from which were suspended rounded forms of\nvarious sizes which, if they had not been transparent, I might have\nsupposed to be fruit. From what appeared to me to be analogous to\nbright-blue ice, streams of the richest tint of rose color or purple\nburst forth and flowed into basins, forming lakes or seas of the same\ncolor. Looking through the atmosphere toward the heavens, I saw\nbrilliant opaque clouds, of an azure color, that reflected the light of\nthe sun, which had to my eyes an entirely new aspect and appeared\nsmaller, as if seen through a dense blue mist.\n\n\"I saw moving on the surface below me immense masses, the forms of which\nI find it impossible to describe. They had systems for locomotion\nsimilar to those of the morse, or sea-horse, but I saw, with great\nsurprise, that they moved from place to place by six extremely thin\nmembranes, which they used as wings. Their colors were varied and\nbeautiful, but principally azure and rose color. I saw numerous\nconvolutions of tubes, more analogous to the trunk of the elephant than\nto anything else I can imagine, occupying what I supposed to be the\nupper parts of the body. It was with a species of terror that I saw one\nof them mounting upward, apparently flying toward those opaque clouds\nwhich I have before mentioned.\n\n\"'I know what your feelings are,' said the Genius; 'you want analogies,\nand all the elements of knowledge to comprehend the scene before you.\nYou are in the same state in which a fly would be whose microscopic eye\nwas changed for one similar to that of man, and you are wholly unable to\nassociate what you now see with your former knowledge. But those beings\nwho are before you, and who appear to you almost as imperfect in their\nfunctions as the zoophytes of the polar sea, to which they are not\nunlike in their apparent organization to your eyes, have a sphere of\nsensibility and intellectual enjoyment far superior to that of the\ninhabitants of your earth. Each of those tubes, which appears like the\ntrunk of an elephant, is an organ of peculiar motion or sensation. They\nhave many modes of perception of which you are wholly ignorant, at the\nsame time that their sphere of vision is infinitely more extended than\nyours, and their organs of touch far more perfect and exquisite.'\"\n\nAfter descanting upon the advantages of Saturn's position for surveying\nsome of the phenomena of the solar system and of outer space, and the\nconsequent immense advances that the Saturnians have made in\nastronomical knowledge, the Genius continues:\n\n\"'If I were to show you the different parts of the surface of this\nplanet you would see the marvelous results of the powers possessed by\nthese highly intellectual beings, and of the wonderful manner in which\nthey have applied and modified matter. Those columnar masses, which seem\nto you as if rising out of a mass of ice below, are results of art, and\nprocesses are going on within them connected with the formation and\nperfection of their food. The brilliant-colored fluids are the results\nof such operations as on the earth would be performed in your\nlaboratories, or more properly in your refined culinary apparatus, for\nthey are connected with their system of nourishment. Those opaque azure\nclouds, to which you saw a few minutes ago one of those beings directing\nhis course, are works of art, and places in which they move through\ndifferent regions of their atmosphere, and command the temperature and\nthe quantity of light most fitted for their philosophical researches,\nor most convenient for the purposes of life.'\"[11]\n\n[Footnote 11: Davy, of course, was aware that, owing to increase of\ndistance, the sun would appear to an inhabitant of Saturn with a disk\nonly one ninetieth as great in area as that which it presents to our\neyes.]\n\nBut, while Saturn does not appear, with our present knowledge, to hold\nout any encouragement to those who would regard it as the abode of\nliving creatures capable of being described in any terms except those of\npure imagination, yet it is so unique a curiosity among the heavenly\nbodies that one returns again and again to the contemplation of its\nstrange details. Saturn has nine moons, but some of them are relatively\nsmall bodies--the ninth, discovered photographically by Professor\nPickering in 1899, being especially minute--and others are situated at\ngreat distances from the planet, and for these reasons, together with\nthe fact that the sunlight is so feeble upon them that, surface for\nsurface, they have only one ninetieth as much illumination as our moon\nreceives, they can not make a very brilliant display in the Saturnian\nsky. To astronomers on Saturn they would, of course, be intensely\ninteresting because of their perturbations and particularly the effect\nof their attraction on the rings.\n\nThis brings us again to the consideration of those marvelous appendages,\nand to the statement of facts about them which we have not yet recalled.\n\nIf the reader will take a ball three inches in diameter to represent the\nglobe of Saturn, and, out of the center of a circular piece of\nwriting-paper seven inches in diameter, will cut a round hole three and\nthree quarter inches across, and will then place the ball in the middle\nof the hole in the paper, he will have a very fair representation of the\nrelative proportions of Saturn and its rings. To represent the main gap\nor division in the rings he might draw, a little more than three eighths\nof an inch from the outer edge of the paper disk, a pencil line about a\nsixteenth of an inch broad.\n\nPerhaps the most striking fact that becomes conspicuous in making such a\nmodel of the Saturnian system is the exceeding thinness of the rings as\ncompared with their enormous extent. They are about 170,000 miles across\nfrom outer edge to outer edge, and about 38,000 miles broad from outer\nedge to inner edge--including the gauze ring presently to be\nmentioned--yet their thickness probably does not surpass one hundred\nmiles! In fact, the sheet of paper in our imaginary model is several\ntimes too thick to represent the true relative thickness of Saturn's\nrings.\n\nSeveral narrow gaps in the rings have been detected from time to time,\nbut there is only one such gap that is always clearly to be seen, the\none already mentioned, situated about 10,000 miles from the outer edge\nand about 1,600 miles in width. Inside of this gap the broadest and\nbrightest ring appears, having a width of about 16,500 miles. For some\nreason this great ring is most brilliant near the gap, and its\nbrightness gradually falls off toward its inner side. At a distance of\nsomething less than 20,000 miles from the planet--or perhaps it would\nbe more correct to say above the planet, for the rings hang directly\nover Saturn's equator--the broad, bright ring merges into a mysterious\ngauzelike object, also in the form of a ring, which extends to within\n9,000 or 10,000 miles of the planet's surface, and therefore itself has\na width of say 10,000 miles.\n\nIn consequence of the thinness of the rings they completely disappear\nfrom the range of vision of small telescopes when, as occurs once in\nevery fifteen years, they are seen exactly edgewise from the earth. In a\ntelescope powerful enough to reveal them when in that situation they\nresemble a thin, glowing needle run through the ball of the planet. The\nrings will be in this position in 1907, and again in 1922.\n\nThe opacity of the rings is proved by the shadow which they cast upon\nthe ball of the planet. This is particularly manifest at the time when\nthey are edgewise to the earth, for the sun being situated slightly\nabove or below the plane of the rings then throws their shadow across\nSaturn close to its equator. When they are canted at a considerable\nangle to our line of sight their shadow is seen on the planet, bordering\ntheir outer edge where they cross the ball.\n\nThe gauze ring, the detection of which as a faintly luminous phenomenon\nrequires a powerful telescope, can be seen with slighter telescopic\npower in the form of a light shade projected against the planet at the\ninner edge of the broad bright ring. The explanation of the existence of\nthis peculiar object depends upon the nature of the entire system,\nwhich, instead of being, as the earliest observers thought it, a solid\nring or series of concentric rings, is composed of innumerable small\nbodies, like meteorites, perhaps, in size, circulating independently but\nin comparatively close juxtaposition to one another about Saturn, and\npresenting to our eyes, because of their great number and of our\nenormous distance, the appearance of solid, uniform rings. So a flock of\nducks may look from afar like a continuous black line or band, although\nif we were near them we should perceive that a considerable space\nseparates each individual from his neighbors.\n\nThe fact that this is the constitution of Saturn's rings can be\nconfidently stated because it has been mathematically proved that they\ncould not exist if they were either solid or liquid bodies in a\ncontinuous form, and because the late Prof. James E. Keeler demonstrated\nwith the spectroscope, by means of the Doppler principle, already\nexplained in the chapter on Venus, that the rings circulate about the\nplanet with varying velocities according to their distance from Saturn's\ncenter, exactly as independent satellites would do.\n\nIt might be said, then, that Saturn, instead of having nine satellites\nonly, has untold millions of them, traveling in orbits so closely\ncontiguous that they form the appearance of a vast ring.\n\nAs to their origin, it may be supposed that they are a relic of a ring\nof matter left in suspension during the contraction of the globe of\nSaturn from a nebulous mass, just as the rings from which the various\nplanets are supposed to have been formed were left off during the\ncontraction of the main body of the original solar nebula. Other similar\nrings originally surrounding Saturn may have become satellites, but the\nmatter composing the existing rings is so close to the planet that it\nfalls within the critical distance known as \"Roche's limit,\" within\nwhich, owing to the tidal effect of the planet's attraction, no body so\nlarge as a true satellite could exist, and accordingly in the process of\nformation of the Saturnian system this matter, instead of being\naggregated into a single satellite, has remained spread out in the form\nof a ring, although its substance long ago passed from the vaporous and\nliquid to the solid form. We have spoken of the rings as being composed\nof meteorites, but perhaps their component particles may be so small as\nto answer more closely to the definition of dust. In these rings of\ndust, or meteorites, disturbances are produced by the attraction of the\nplanet and that of the outer satellites, and it is yet a question\nwhether they are a stable and permanent feature of Saturn, or will, in\nthe course of time, be destroyed.[12]\n\n[Footnote 12: For further details about Saturn's rings, see The Tides,\nby G.H. Darwin, chap. xx.]\n\nIt has been thought that the gauze ring is variable in brightness. This\nwould tend to show that it is composed of bodies which have been drawn\nin toward the planet from the principal mass of the rings, and these\nbodies may end their career by falling upon the planet. This process,\nindefinitely continued, would result in the total disappearance of the\nrings--Saturn would finally swallow them, as the old god from whom the\nplanet gets its name is fabled to have swallowed his children.\n\nNear the beginning of this chapter reference was made to the fact that\nSaturn's rings have been regarded as habitable bodies. That, of course,\nwas before the discovery that they were not solid. Knowing what we now\nknow about them, even Dr. Thomas Dick, the great Scotch popularizer of\nastronomy in the first half of the nineteenth century, would have been\ncompelled to abandon his theory that Saturn's rings were crowded with\ninhabitants. At the rate of 280 to the square mile he reckoned that they\ncould easily contain 8,078,102,266,080 people.\n\nHe even seems to have regarded their edges--in his time their actual\nthinness was already well known--as useful ground for the support of\nliving creatures, for he carefully calculated the aggregate area of\nthese edges and found that it considerably exceeded the area of the\nentire surface of the earth. Indeed, Dr. Dick found room for more\ninhabitants on Saturn's rings than on Saturn itself, for, excluding the\ngauze ring, undiscovered in his day, the two surfaces of the rings are\ngreater in area than the surface of the globe of the planet. He did not\nattack the problem of the weight of bodies on worlds in the form of\nbroad, flat, thin, surfaces like Saturn's rings, or indulge in any\nreflections on the interrelations of the inhabitants of the opposite\nsides, although he described the wonderful appearance of Saturn and\nother celestial objects as viewed from the rings.\n\nBut all these speculations fall to the ground in face of the simple fact\nthat if we could reach Saturn's rings we should find nothing to stand\nupon, except a cloud of swiftly flying dust or a swarm of meteors,\nswayed by contending attractions. And, indeed, it is likely that upon\narriving in the immediate neighborhood of the rings they would virtually\ndisappear! Seen close at hand their component particles might be so\nwidely separated that all appearance of connection between them would\nvanish, and it has been estimated that from Saturn's surface the rings,\ninstead of presenting a gorgeous arch spanning the heavens, may be\nvisible only as a faintly gleaming band, like the Milky Way or the\nzodiacal light. In this respect the mystic Swedenborg appears to have\nhad a clearer conception of the true nature of Saturn's rings than did\nDr. Dick, for in his book on The Earths in the Universe he says--using\nthe word \"belt\" to describe the phenomenon of the rings:\n\n\"Being questioned concerning that great belt which appears from our\nearth to rise above the horizon of that planet, and to vary its\nsituations, they [the inhabitants of Saturn] said that it does not\nappear to them as a belt, but only as somewhat whitish, like snow in the\nheaven, in various directions.\"\n\nIn view of such observations as that of Prof. E.E. Barnard, in 1892,\nshowing that a satellite passing through the shadow of Saturn's rings\ndoes not entirely disappear--a fact which proves that the rings are\npartially transparent to the sunlight--one might be tempted to ask\nwhether Saturn itself, considering its astonishing lack of density, is\nnot composed, at least in its outer parts, of separate particles of\nmatter revolving independently about their center of attraction, and\npresenting the appearance of a smooth, uniform shell reflecting the\nlight of the sun. In other words, may not Saturn be, exteriorly, a globe\nof dust instead of a globe of vapor? Certainly the rings, incoherent and\ntranslucent though they be, reflect the sunlight to our eyes, at least\nfrom the brighter part of their surface, with a brilliance comparable\nwith that of the globe of the planet itself.\n\nAs bearing on the question of the interior condition of Saturn and\nJupiter, it should, perhaps, be said that mathematical considerations,\nbased on the figures of equilibrium of rotating liquid masses, lead to\nthe conclusion that those planets are comparatively very dense within.\nProfessor Darwin puts the statement very strongly, as follows: \"In this\nway it is known with certainty that the central portions of the planets\nJupiter and Saturn are much denser, compared to their superficial\nportions, than is the case with the earth.\"[13]\n\n[Footnote 13: The Tides, by G.H. Darwin, p. 333.]\n\nThe globe and rings of Saturn witness an imposing spectacle of gigantic\nmoving shadows. The great ball stretches its vast shade across the full\nwidth of the rings at times, and the rings, as we have seen, throw their\nshadow in a belt, whose position slowly changes, across the ball,\nsweeping from the equator, now toward one pole and now toward the\nother. The sun shines alternately on each side of the rings for a space\nof nearly fifteen years--a day fifteen years long! And then, when that\nface of the ring is turned away from the sun, there ensues a night of\nfifteen years' duration also.\n\nWhatever appearance the rings may present from the equator and the\nmiddle latitudes on Saturn, from the polar regions they would be totally\ninvisible. As one passed toward the north, or the south, pole he would\nsee the upper part of the arch of the rings gradually sink toward the\nhorizon until at length, somewhere in the neighborhood of the polar\ncircle, it would finally disappear, hidden by the round shoulder of the\ngreat globe.\n\n\nURANUS, NEPTUNE, AND THE SUSPECTED ULTRANEPTUNIAN PLANET\n\nWhat has been said of Jupiter and Saturn applies also to the remaining\nmembers of the Jovian group of planets, Uranus and Neptune, viz., that\ntheir density is so small that it seems probable that they can not, at\nthe present time, be in a habitable planetary condition. All four of\nthese outer, larger planets have, in comparatively recent times, been\nsolar orbs, small companions of the sun. The density of Uranus is about\none fifth greater than that of water, and slightly greater than that of\nNeptune. Uranus is 32,000 miles in diameter, and Neptune 35,000 miles.\nCuriously enough, the force of gravity upon each of these two large\nplanets is a little less than upon the earth. This arises from the fact\nthat in reckoning gravity on the surface of a planet not only the mass\nof the planet, but its diameter or radius, must be considered. Gravity\nvaries directly as the mass, but inversely as the square of the radius,\nand for this reason a large planet of small density may exercise a less\nforce of gravity at its surface than does a small planet of great\ndensity.\n\nThe mean distance of Uranus from the sun is about 1,780,000,000 miles,\nand its period of revolution is eighty-four years; Neptune's mean\ndistance is about 2,800,000,000 miles, and its period of revolution is\nabout 164 years.\n\nUranus has four satellites, and Neptune one. The remarkable thing about\nthese satellites is that they revolve _backward_, or contrary to the\ndirection in which all the other satellites belonging to the solar\nsystem revolve, and in which all the other planets rotate on their axis.\nIn the case of Uranus, the plane in which the satellites revolve is not\nfar from a position at right angles to the plane of the ecliptic; but in\nthe case of Neptune, the plane of revolution of the satellites is tipped\nmuch farther backward. Since in every other case the satellites of a\nplanet are situated nearly in the plane of the planet's equator, it may\nbe assumed that the same rule holds with Uranus and Neptune; and, that\nbeing so, we must conclude that those planets rotate backward on their\naxes. This has an important bearing on the nebular hypothesis of the\norigin of the solar system, and at one time was thought to furnish a\nconvincing argument against that hypothesis; but it has been shown that\nby a modification of Laplace's theory the peculiar behavior of Uranus\nand Neptune can be reconciled with it.\n\nVery little is known of the surfaces of Uranus and Neptune. Indications\nof the existence of belts resembling those of Jupiter have been found in\nthe case of both planets. There are similar belts on Saturn, and as they\nseem to be characteristic of large, rapidly rotating bodies of small\ndensity, it was to be expected that they would be found on Uranus and\nNeptune.\n\nThe very interesting opinion is entertained by some astronomers that\nthere is at least one other great planet beyond Neptune. The orbits of\ncertain comets are relied upon as furnishing evidence of the existence\nof such a body. Prof. George Forbes has estimated that this, as yet\nundiscovered, planet may be even greater than Jupiter in mass, and may\nbe situated at a distance from the sun one hundred times as great as the\nearth's, where it revolves in an orbit a single circuit of which\nrequires a thousand years.\n\nWhether this planet, with a year a thousand of our years in length, will\never be seen with a telescope, or whether its existence will ever, in\nsome other manner, be fully demonstrated, can not yet be told. It will\nbe remembered that Neptune was discovered by means of computations based\nupon its disturbing attraction on Uranus before it had ever been\nrecognized with the telescope. But when the astronomers in the\nobservatories were told by their mathematical brethren where to look\nthey found the planet within half an hour after the search began. So it\nis possible the suspected great planet beyond Neptune may be within the\nrange of telescopic vision, but may not be detected until elaborate\ncalculations have deduced its place in the heavens. As a populous city\nis said to furnish the best hiding-place for a man who would escape the\nattention of his fellow beings, so the star-sprinkled sky is able to\nconceal among its multitudes worlds both great and small until the most\npainstaking detective methods bring them to recognition.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nTHE MOON, CHILD OF THE EARTH AND THE SUN\n\n\nVery naturally the moon has always been a great favorite with those who,\neither in a scientific or in a literary spirit, have speculated about\nthe plurality of inhabited worlds. The reasons for the preference\naccorded to the moon in this regard are evident. Unless a comet should\nbrush us--as a comet is suspected of having done already--no celestial\nbody, of any pretensions to size, can ever approach as near to the earth\nas the moon is, at least while the solar system continues to obey the\norganic laws that now control it. It is only a step from the earth to\nthe moon. What are 240,000 miles in comparison with the distances of the\nstars, or even with the distances of the planets? Jupiter, driving\nbetween the earth and the moon, would occupy more than one third of the\nintervening space with the chariot of his mighty globe; Saturn, with\nbroad wings outspread, would span more than two thirds of the distance;\nand the sun, so far from being able to get through at all, would overlap\nthe way more than 300,000 miles on each side.\n\nIn consequence, of course, of its nearness, the moon is the only member\nof the planetary system whose principal features are visible to the\nnaked eye. In truth, the naked eye perceives the larger configurations\nof the lunar surface more clearly than the most powerful telescope shows\nthe details on the disk of Mars. Long before the time of Galileo and the\ninvention of the telescope, men had noticed that the face of the moon\nbears a resemblance to the appearance that the earth would present if\nviewed from afar off. In remote antiquity there were philosophers who\nthought that the moon was an inhabited world, and very early the\nromancers took up the theme. Lucian, the Voltaire of the second century\nof our era, mercilessly scourged the pretenders of the earth from an\nimaginary point of vantage on the moon, which enabled him to peer down\ninto their secrets. Lucian's description of the appearance of the earth\nfrom the moon shows how clearly defined in his day had become the\nconception of our globe as only an atom in space.\n\n\"Especially did it occur to me to laugh at the men who were quarreling\nabout the boundaries of their land, and at those who were proud because\nthey cultivated the Sikyonian plain, or owned that part of Marathon\naround Oenoe, or held possession of a thousand acres at Acharn\u00e6. Of\nthe whole of Greece, as it then appeared to me from above, being about\nthe size of four fingers, I think Attica was in proportion a mere speck.\nSo that I wondered on what condition it was left to these rich men to be\nproud.\"[14]\n\n[Footnote 14: Ikaromenippus; or, Above the Clouds. Prof. D.C. Brown's\ntranslation.]\n\nSuch scenes as Lucian beheld, in imagination, upon the earth while\nlooking from the moon, many would fain behold, with telescopic aid,\nupon the moon while looking from the earth. Galileo believed that the\ndetails of the lunar surface revealed by his telescope closely resembled\nin their nature the features of the earth's surface, and for a long\ntime, as the telescope continued to be improved, observers were\nimpressed with the belief that the moon possessed not only mountains and\nplains, but seas and oceans also.\n\nIt was the discovery that the moon has no perceptible atmosphere that\nfirst seriously undermined the theory of its habitability. Yet, as was\nremarked in the introductory chapter, there has of late been some change\nof view concerning a lunar atmosphere; but the change has been not so\nmuch in the ascertained facts as in the way of looking at those facts.\n\nBut before we discuss this matter, it will be well to state what is\nknown beyond peradventure about the moon.\n\nIts mean distance from the earth is usually called, for the sake of a\nround number, 240,000 miles, but more accurately stated it is 238,840\nmiles. This is variable to the extent of more than 31,000 miles, on\naccount of the eccentricity of its orbit, and the eccentricity itself is\nvariable, in consequence of the perturbing attractions of the earth and\nthe sun, so that the distance of the moon from the earth is continually\nchanging. It may be as far away as 253,000 miles and as near as 221,600\nmiles.\n\nAlthough the orbit of the moon is generally represented, for\nconvenience, as an ellipse about the earth, it is, in reality, a varying\ncurve, having the sun for its real focus, and always concave toward the\nlatter. This is a fact that can be more readily explained with the aid\nof a diagram.\n\n[Illustration: THE MOON'S PATH WITH RESPECT TO THE SUN AND THE EARTH.]\n\nIn the accompanying cut, when the earth is at _A_ the moon is between it\nand the sun, in the phase called new moon. At this point the earth's\norbit about the sun is more curved than the moon's, and the earth is\nmoving relatively faster than the moon, so that when it arrives at _B_\nit is ahead of the moon, and we see the latter to the right of the\nearth, in the phase called first quarter. The earth being at this time\nahead of the moon, the effect of its attraction, combined with that of\nthe sun, tends to hasten the moon onward in its orbit about the sun, and\nthe moon begins to travel more swiftly, until it overtakes the earth at\n_C_, and appears on the side opposite the sun, in the phase called full\nmoon. At this point the moon's orbit about the sun has a shorter radius\nof curvature than the earth's. In traveling from _C_ to _D_ the moon\nstill moves more rapidly than the earth, and, having passed it, appears\nat _D_ to the left of the earth, in the phase called third quarter. Now,\nthe earth being behind the moon, the effect of its attraction combined\nwith the sun's tends to retard the moon in its orbit about the sun,\nwith the result that the moon moves again less rapidly than the earth,\nand the latter overtakes it, so that, upon reaching _E_, the two are\nonce more in the same relative positions that they occupied at _A_, and\nit is again new moon. Thus it will be seen that, although the real orbit\nof the moon has the sun for its center of revolution, nevertheless, in\nconsequence of the attraction of the earth, combined in varying\ndirections with that of the sun, the moon, once every month, makes a\ncomplete circuit of our globe.\n\nThe above explanation should not be taken for a mathematical\ndemonstration of the moon's motion, but simply for a graphical\nillustration of how the moon appears to revolve about the earth while\nreally obeying the sun's attraction as completely as the earth does.\n\nThere is no other planet that has a moon relatively as large as ours.\nThe moon's diameter is 2,163 miles. Its volume, compared with the\nearth's, is in the ratio of 1 to 49, and its density is about six\ntenths of the earth's. This makes its mass to that of our globe about as\n1 to 81. In other words, it would take eighty-one moons to\ncounterbalance the earth. Before speaking of the force of gravity on the\nmoon we will examine the character of the lunar surface.\n\nTo the naked eye the moon's face appears variegated with dusky patches,\nwhile a few points of superior brilliance shine amid the brighter\nportions, especially in the southern and eastern quarters, where immense\ncraters like Tycho and Copernicus are visible to a keen eye, gleaming\nlike polished buttons. With a telescope, even of moderate power, the\nsurface of the moon presents a scene of astonishing complexity, in which\nstrangeness, beauty, and grandeur are all combined. The half of the moon\nturned earthward contains an area of 7,300,000 square miles, a little\ngreater than the area of South America and a little less than that of\nNorth America. Of these 7,300,000 square miles, about 2,900,000 square\nmiles are occupied by the gray, or dusky, expanses, called in lunar\ngeography, or selenography, _maria_--i.e., \"seas.\" Whatever they may\nonce have been, they are not now seas, but dry plains, bordered in many\nplaces by precipitous cliffs and mountains, varied in level by low\nridges and regions of depression, intersected occasionally by immense\ncracks, having the width and depth of our mightiest river ca\u00f1ons, and\nsprinkled with bright points and crater pits. The remaining 4,400,000\nsquare miles are mainly occupied by mountains of the most extraordinary\ncharacter. Owing partly to roughness of the surface and partly to more\nbrilliant reflective power, the mountainous regions of the moon appear\nbright in comparison with the dull-colored plains.\n\nSome of the lunar mountains lie in long, massive chains, with towering\npeaks, profound gorges, narrow valleys, vast amphitheaters, and beetling\nprecipices. Looking at them with a powerful telescope, the observer\nmight well fancy himself to be gazing down from an immense height into\nthe heart of the untraveled Himalayas. But these, imposing though they\nare, do not constitute the most wonderful feature of the mountain\nscenery of the moon.\n\nAppearing sometimes on the shores of the \"seas,\" sometimes in the midst\nof broad plains, sometimes along the course of mountain chains, and\nsometimes in magnificent rows, following for hundreds of miles the\nmeridians of the lunar globe, are tremendous, mountain-walled, circular\nchasms, called craters. Frequently they have in the middle of their\ndepressed interior floors a peak, or a cluster of peaks. Their inner and\nouter walls are seamed with ridges, and what look like gigantic streams\nof frozen lava surround them. The resemblance that they bear to the\ncraters of volcanoes is, at first sight, so striking that probably\nnobody would ever have thought of questioning the truth of the statement\nthat they are such craters but for their incredible magnitude. Many of\nthem exceed fifty miles in diameter, and some of them sink two, three,\nfour, and more miles below the loftiest points upon their walls! There\nis a chasm, 140 miles long and 70 broad, named Newton, situated about\n200 miles from the south pole of the moon, whose floor lies 24,000 feet\nbelow the summit of a peak that towers just above it on the east! This\nabyss is so profound that the shadows of its enclosing precipices never\nentirely quit it, and the larger part of its bottom is buried in endless\nnight.\n\nOne can not but shudder at the thought of standing on the broken walls\nof Newton, and gazing down into a cavity of such stupendous depth that\nif Chimborazo were thrown into it, the head of the mighty Andean peak\nwould be thousands of feet beneath the observer.\n\nA different example of the crater mountains of the moon is the\ncelebrated Tycho, situated in latitude about 43\u00b0 south, corresponding\nwith the latitude of southern New Zealand on the earth. Tycho is nearly\ncircular and a little more than 54 miles across. The highest point on\nits wall is about 17,000 feet above the interior. In the middle of its\nfloor is a mountain 5,000 or 6,000 feet high. Tycho is especially\nremarkable for the vast system of whitish streaks, or rays, which\nstarting from its outer walls, spread in all directions over the face of\nthe moon, many of them, running, without deviation, hundreds of miles\nacross mountains, craters, and plains. These rays are among the greatest\nof lunar mysteries, and we shall have more to say of them.\n\n[Illustration: THE LUNAR ALPS, APENNINES, AND CAUCASUS.\nPhotographed with the Lick Telescope.]\n\nCopernicus, a crater mountain situated about 10\u00b0 north of the equator,\nin the eastern hemisphere of the moon, is another wonderful object, 56\nmiles in diameter, a polygon appearing, when not intently studied, as a\ncircle, 11,000 or 12,000 feet deep, and having a group of relatively low\npeaks in the center of its floor. Around Copernicus an extensive area of\nthe moon's surface is whitened with something resembling the rays of\nTycho, but more irregular in appearance. Copernicus lies within the edge\nof the great plain named the _Oceanus Procellarum_, or \"Ocean of\nStorms,\" and farther east, in the midst of the \"ocean,\" is a smaller\ncrater mountain, named Kepler, which is also enveloped by a whitish\narea, covering the lunar surface as if it were the result of extensive\noutflows of light-colored lava.\n\nIn one important particular the crater mountains of the moon differ from\nterrestrial volcanoes. This difference is clearly described by Nasmyth\nand Carpenter in their book on The Moon:\n\n\"While the terrestrial crater is generally a hollow on a mountain top,\nwith its flat bottom high above the level of the surrounding country,\nthose upon the moon have their lowest points depressed more or less\ndeeply below the general surface of the moon, the external height being\nfrequently only a half or one third of the internal depth.\"\n\nIt has been suggested that these gigantic rings are only \"basal wrecks\"\nof volcanic mountains, whose conical summits have been blown away,\nleaving vast crateriform hollows where the mighty peaks once stood; but\nthe better opinion seems to be that which assumes that the rings were\nformed by volcanic action very much as we now see them. If such a crater\nas Copernicus or the still larger one named Theophilus, which is\nsituated in the western hemisphere of the moon, on the shore of the \"Sea\nof Nectar,\" ever had a conical mountain rising from its rim, the height\nattained by the peak, if the average slope were about 30\u00b0, would have\nbeen truly stupendous--fifteen or eighteen miles!\n\nThere is a kind of ring mountains, found in many places on the moon,\nwhose forms and surroundings do not, as the craters heretofore described\ndo, suggest at first sight a volcanic origin. These are rather level\nplains of an oval or circular outline, enclosed by a wall of mountains.\nThe finest example is, perhaps, the dark-gray Plato, situated in 50\u00b0 of\nnorth latitude, near an immense mountain uplift named the Lunar Alps,\nand on the northern shore of the _Mare Imbrium_, or \"Sea of Showers.\"\nPlato appears as an oval plain, very smooth and level, about 60 miles in\nlength, and completely surrounded by mountains, quite precipitous on the\ninner side, and rising in their highest peaks to an elevation of 6,000\nto 7,000 feet. Enclosed plains, bearing more or less resemblance to\nPlato--sometimes smooth within, and sometimes broken with small peaks\nand craters or hilly ridges--are to be found scattered over almost all\nparts of the moon. If our satellite was ever an inhabited world like the\nearth, while its surface was in its present condition, these valleys\nmust have presented an extraordinary spectacle. It has been thought that\nthey may once have been filled with water, forming lakes that recall the\ncurious Crater Lake of Oregon.\n\n[Illustration: THE MOON AT FIRST AND LAST QUARTER (WESTERN AND EASTERN\nHEMISPHERES). Photographed with the Lick Telescope.]\n\nIt is not my intention to give a complete description of the various\nlunar features, and I mention but one other--the \"clefts\" or \"rills,\"\nwhich are to be seen running across the surface like cracks. One of the\nmost remarkable of these is found in the _Oceanus Procellarum_, near the\ncrater-mountain Aristarchus, which is famed for the intense brilliance\nof its central peak, whose reflective power is so great that it was once\nsupposed to be aflame with volcanic fire. The cleft, or crack, in\nquestion is very erratic in its course, and many miles in length, and\nit terminates in a ringed plain named Herodotus not far east of\nAristarchus, breaking through the wall of the plain and entering the\ninterior. Many other similar chasms or ca\u00f1ons exist on the moon, some\ncrossing plains, some cleaving mountain walls, and some forming a\nnetwork of intersecting clefts. Mr. Thomas Gwyn Elger has this to say on\nthe subject of the lunar clefts:\n\n\"If, as seems most probable, these gigantic cracks are due to\ncontractions of the moon's surface, it is not impossible, in spite of\nthe assertions of the text-books to the effect that our satellite is now\na 'changeless world,' that emanations may proceed from these fissures,\neven if, under the monthly alternations of extreme temperatures, surface\nchanges do not now occasionally take place from this cause also. Should\nthis be so, the appearance of new rills and the extension and\nmodification of those already existing may reasonably be looked for.\"\n\nMr. Elger then proceeds to describe his discovery in 1883, in the\nring-plain Mersenius, of a cleft never noticed before, and which seems\nto have been of recent formation.[15]\n\n[Footnote 15: The Moon, a Full Description and Map of its Principal\nFeatures, by Thomas Gwyn Elger, 1895.\n\nThose who desire to read detailed descriptions of lunar scenery may\nconsult, in addition to Mr. Elger's book, the following: The Moon,\nconsidered as a Planet, a World, and a Satellite, by James Nasmyth and\nJames Carpenter, 1874; The Moon, and the Condition and Configurations of\nits Surface, by Edmund Neison, 1876. See also Annals of Harvard College\nObservatory, vol. xxxii, part ii, 1900, for observations made by Prof.\nWilliam H. Pickering at the Arequipa Observatory.]\n\nWe now return to the question of the force of lunar gravity. This we\nfind to be only one sixth as great as gravity on the surface of the\nearth. It is by far the smallest force of gravity that we have found\nanywhere except on the asteroids. Employing the same method of\ncomparison that was made in the case of Mars, we compute that a man on\nthe moon could attain a height of thirty-six feet without being\nrelatively more unwieldy than a six-foot descendant of Adam is on the\nearth.\n\nWhether this furnishes a sound reason for assuming that the lunar\ninhabitants, if any exist or have ever existed, should be preposterous\ngiants is questionable; yet such an assumption receives a certain degree\nof support from the observed fact that the natural features of the moon\nare framed on an exaggerated scale as compared with the earth's. We have\njust observed that the moon is characterized by vast mountain rings,\nattaining in many cases a diameter exceeding fifty miles. If these are\nvolcanic craters, it is evident, at a glance, that the mightiest\nvolcanoes of the earth fall into insignificance beside them. Now, the\nslight force of gravity on the moon has been appealed to as a reason why\nvolcanic explosions on the lunar globe should produce incomparably\ngreater effects than upon the earth, where the ejected materials are so\nmuch heavier. The same force that would throw a volcanic bomb a mile\nhigh on the earth could throw it six miles high on the moon. The giant\ncannon that we have placed in one of our coast forts, which is said to\nbe able to hurl a projectile to a distance of fifteen miles, could send\nthe same projectile ninety miles on the moon. An athlete who can clear a\nhorizontal bar at a height of six feet on the earth could clear the same\nbar at a height of thirty-six feet on the moon. In other words, he could\njump over a house, unless, indeed, the lunarians really are giants, and\nlive in houses proportioned to their own dimensions and to the size of\ntheir mountains. In that case, our athlete would have to content himself\nwith jumping over a lunarian, whose head he could just clear--with the\nhat off.\n\nThese things are not only amusing, but important. There can be no\nquestion that the force of gravity on the moon actually is as slight as\nit has just been described. So, even without calling in imaginary\ninhabitants to lend it interest, the comparative inability of the moon\nto arrest bodies in motion becomes a fact of much significance. It has\nled to the theory that meteorites may have originally been shot out of\nthe moon's great volcanoes, when those volcanoes were active, and may\nhave circulated about the sun until various perturbations have brought\nthem down upon the earth. A body shot radially from the surface of the\nmoon would need to have a velocity of only about a mile and a half in a\nsecond in order to escape from the moon's control, and we can believe\nthat a lunar volcano when in action could have imparted such a velocity,\nall the more readily because with modern gunpowders we have been able to\ngive to projectiles a speed one half as great as that needed for\nliberation from lunar gravity.\n\nAnother consequence of the small gravitative power of the moon bears\nupon the all-important question of atmosphere. According to the theory\nof Dr. Johnstone Stoney, heretofore referred to, oxygen, nitrogen, and\nwater vapor would all gradually escape from the moon, if originally\nplaced upon it, because, by the kinetic theory, the maximum velocities\nof their molecules are greater than a mile and a half per second. The\nescape would not occur instantly, nor all at once, for it would be only\nthe molecules at the upper surface of the atmosphere which were moving\nwith their greatest velocity, and in a direction radial to the center of\nthe moon, that would get away; but in the course of time this gradual\nleakage would result in the escape of all of those gases.[16]\n\n[Footnote 16: The discovery of free hydrogen in the earth's atmosphere,\nby Professor Dewar, 1901, bears upon the theory of the escape of gases\nfrom a planet, and may modify the view above expressed. Since hydrogen\nis theoretically incapable of being permanently retained in the free\nstate by the earth, its presence in the atmosphere indicates either that\nthere is an influx from space or that it emanates from the earth's\ncrust. In a similar way it may be assumed that atmospheric gases can be\ngiven off from the crust of the moon, thus, to a greater or less extent,\nsupplying the place of the molecules that escape.]\n\nAfter it had been found that, to ordinary tests, the moon offered no\nevidence of the possession of an atmosphere, and before Dr. Stoney's\ntheory was broached, it was supposed by many that the moon had lost its\noriginal supply of air by absorption into its interior. The oxygen was\nsupposed to have entered into combination with the cooling rocks and\nminerals, thus being withdrawn from the atmosphere, and the nitrogen was\nimagined to have disappeared also within the lunar crust. For it seems\nto have always been tacitly assumed that the phenomenon to be accounted\nfor was not so much the _absence_ of a lunar atmosphere as its\n_disappearance_. But disappearance, of course, implies previous\nexistence. In like manner it has always been a commonly accepted view\nthat the moon probably once had enough water to form lakes and seas.\n\nThese, it has been calculated, could have been absorbed into the lunar\nglobe as it cooled off. But Johnstone Stoney's theory offers another\nmethod by which they could have escaped, through evaporation and the\ngradual flight of the molecules into open space. Possibly both methods\nhave been in operation, a portion of the constituents of the former\natmosphere and oceans having entered into chemical combinations in the\nlunar crust, and the remainder having vanished in consequence of the\nlack of sufficient gravitative force to retain them.\n\nBut why, it may be asked, should it be assumed that the moon ever had\nthings which it does not now possess? Perhaps no entirely satisfactory\nreply can be made. Some observers have believed that they detected\nunmistakable indications of alluvial deposits on lunar plains, and of\nthe existence of beaches on the shores of the \"seas.\" Messrs. Loewy and\nPuiseux, of the Paris Observatory, whose photographs of the moon are\nperhaps the finest yet made, say on this subject:\n\n\"There exists, from the point of view of relief, a general similarity\nbetween the 'seas' of the moon and the plateaux which are covered to-day\nby terrestrial oceans. In these convex surfaces are more frequent than\nconcave basins, thrown back usually toward the verge of the depressed\nspace. In the same way the 'seas' of the moon present, generally at the\nedges, rather pronounced depressions. In one case, as in the other, we\nobserve normal deformations of a shrinking globe shielded from the\nerosive action of rain, which tends, on the contrary, in all the\nabundantly watered parts of the earth to make the concave surfaces\npredominate. The explanation of this structure, such as is admitted at\npresent by geologists, seems to us equally valid for the moon.\"[17]\n\n[Footnote 17: Comptes Rendus, June 26, July 3, 1899.]\n\nIt might be urged that there is evidence of former volcanic activity on\nthe moon of such a nature that explosions of steam must have played a\npart in the phenomena, and if there was steam, of course there was\nwater.\n\nBut perhaps the most convincing argument tending to show that the moon\nonce had a supply of water, of which some remnant may yet remain below\nthe surface of the lunar globe, is based upon the probable similarity in\ncomposition of the earth and the moon. This similarity results almost\nequally whether we regard the moon as having originated in a ring of\nmatter left off from the contracting mass that became the earth, or\nwhether we accept the suggestion of Prof. G.H. Darwin, that the moon is\nthe veritable offspring of the earth, brought into being by the\nassistance of the tidal influence of the sun. The latter hypothesis is\nthe more picturesque of the two, and, at present, is probably the more\ngenerally favored. It depends upon the theory of tidal friction, which\nwas referred to in Chapter III, as offering an explanation of the manner\nin which the rotation of the planet Mercury has been slowed down until\nits rotary period coincides with that of its revolution.\n\nThe gist of the hypothesis in question is that at a very early period in\nits history, when the earth was probably yet in a fluid condition, it\nrotated with extreme rapidity on its axis, and was, at the same time,\ngreatly agitated by the tidal attraction of the sun, and finally huge\nmasses were detached from the earth which, ultimately uniting, became\nthe moon.[18]\n\n[Footnote 18: The Tides, by G.H. Darwin, chapter xvi.]\n\nBorn in this manner from the very substance of the earth, the moon would\nnecessarily be composed, in the main, of the same elements as the globe\non which we dwell, and is it conceivable that it should not have carried\nwith it both air and water, or the gases from which they were to be\nformed? If the moon ever had enough of these prime requisites to enable\nit to support forms of life comparable with those of the earth, the\ndisappearance of that life must have been a direct consequence of the\ngradual vanishing of the lunar air and water. The secular drying up of\nthe oceans and wasting away of the atmosphere on our little neighbor\nworld involved a vast, all-embracing tragedy, some of the earlier scenes\nof which, if theories be correct, are now reenacted on the\nhalf-desiccated planet Mars--a planet, by the way, which in size, mass,\nand ability to retain vital gases stands about half-way between the\nearth and the moon.\n\nOne of the most interesting facts about the moon is that its surface\naffords evidence of a cataclysm which has wiped out many, and perhaps\nnearly all, of the records of its earlier history, that were once\nwritten upon its face. Even on the earth there have been geological\ncatastrophes destroying or burying the accumulated results of ages of\nundisturbed progress, but on the moon these effects have been\ntranscendent. The story of the tremendous disaster that overtook the\nmoon is partly written in its giant volcanoes. Although it may be true,\nas some maintain, that there is yet volcanic action going on upon the\nlunar surface, it is evident that such action must be insignificant in\ncomparison with that which took place ages ago.\n\nThere is a spot in the western hemisphere of the moon, on the border of\na placid bay or \"sea,\" that I can never look at without a feeling of awe\nand almost of shrinking. There, within a space about 250 miles in length\nby 100 in width, is an exhibition of the most terrifying effects of\nvolcanic energy that the eye of man can anywhere behold. Three immense\ncraters--Theophilus, 64 miles across and 3-1/2 miles deep; Cyrillus, 60\nmiles across and 15,000 feet deep; and Catharina, 70 miles across and\nfrom 8,000 to 16,000 feet deep--form an interlinked chain of mountain\nrings, ridges, precipices, chasms, and bottomless pits that take away\none's breath.\n\nBut when the first impression of astonishment and dismay produced by\nthis overwhelming spectacle has somewhat abated, the thoughtful observer\nwill note that here the moon is telling him a part of her wonderful\nstory, depicted in characters so plain that he needs no instruction in\norder to decipher their meaning. He will observe that this ruin was not\nall wrought at once or simultaneously. Theophilus, the crater-mountain\nat the northwestern end of the chain, whose bottom lies deepest of all,\nis the youngest of these giants, though the most imposing. For a\ndistance of forty miles the lofty wall of Theophilus has piled itself\nupon the ruins of the wall of Cyrillus, and the circumference of the\ncircle of its tremendous crater has been forcibly thrust within the\noriginal rim of the more ancient crater, which was thus rudely compelled\nto make room for its more vigorous rival and successor.\n\nThe observer will also notice that Catharina, the huge pit at the\nsoutheastern end of the chain, bears evidence of yet greater age. Its\noriginal walls, fragments of which still stand in broken grandeur,\ntowering to a height of 16,000 feet, have, throughout the greater part\nof their circuit, been riddled by the outbreak of smaller craters, and\ntorn asunder and thrown down on all sides.\n\nIn the vast enclosure that was originally the floor of the\ncrater-mountain Catharina, several crater rings, only a third, a\nquarter, or a fifth as great in diameter, have broken forth, and these\nin turn have been partially destroyed, while in the interior of the\noldest of them yet smaller craters, a nest of them, mere Etnas,\nCotopaxis, and Kilaueas in magnitude, simple pinheads on the moon, have\nopened their tiny jaws in weak and ineffective expression of the waning\nenergies of a still later epoch, which followed the truly heroic age of\nlunar vulcanicity.\n\nThis is only one example among hundreds, scattered all over the moon,\nwhich show how the surface of our satellite has suffered upheaval after\nupheaval. It is possible that some of the small craters, not included\nwithin the walls of the greater ones, may represent an early stage in\nthe era of volcanic activity that wrecked the moon, but where larger and\nsmaller are grouped together a certain progression can be seen, tending\nfinally to extinction. The internal energies reached a maximum and then\nfell off in strength until they died out completely.\n\nIt can hardly be supposed that the life-bearing phase of lunar\nhistory--if there ever was one--could survive the outbreak of the\nvolcanic cataclysm. North America, or Europe, if subjected to such an\nexperience as the continental areas of the moon have passed through,\nwould be, in proportion, worse wrecked than the most fearfully battered\nsteel victim of a modern sea fight, and one can readily understand that,\nin such circumstances, those now beautiful and populous continents would\nexhibit, from a distance, scarcely any token of their present\ntopographical features, to say nothing of any relics of their occupation\nby living creatures.\n\nThere are other interesting glimpses to be had of an older world in the\nmoon than that whose scarred face is now beautified for us by distance.\nNot far from Theophilus and the other great crater-mountains just\ndescribed, at the upper, or southern, end of the level expanse called\nthe \"Sea of Nectar,\" is a broad, semicircular bay whose shores are\nformed by the walls of a partially destroyed crater named Fracastorius.\nIt is evident that this bay, and the larger part of the \"Sea of Nectar,\"\nhave been created by an outwelling of liquid lavas, which formed a\nsmooth floor over a portion of the pre-existing surface of the moon, and\nbroke down and submerged a large part of the mountain ring of\nFracastorius, leaving the more ancient walls standing at the southern\nend, while, outlined by depressions and corrugations in the rocky\nblanket, are certain half-defined forms belonging to the buried world\nbeneath.\n\nNear Copernicus, some years ago, as Dr. Edward S. Holden pointed out,\nphotographs made with the great Lick telescope, then under his\ndirection, showed, in skeleton outline, a huge ring buried beneath some\nvast outflow of molten matter and undiscerned by telescopic observers.\nAnd Mr. Elger, who was a most industrious observer and careful\ninterpreter of lunar scenery, speaks of \"the undoubted existence of the\nrelics of an earlier lunar world beneath the smooth superficies of the\n_maria_.\"\n\nAlthough, as already remarked, it seems necessary to assume that any\nlife existing in the moon prior to its great volcanic outburst must have\nceased at that time, yet the possibility may be admitted that life could\nreappear upon the moon after its surface had again become quiet and\ncomparatively undisturbed. Germs of the earlier life might have\nsurvived, despite the terrible nature of the catastrophe. But the\nconditions on the moon at present are such that even the most confident\nadvocates of the view that the lunar world is not entirely dead do not\nventure to assume that anything beyond the lowest and simplest organic\nforms--mainly, if not wholly, in the shape of vegetation--can exist\nthere. The impression that even such life is possible rests upon the\naccumulating evidence of the existence of a lunar atmosphere, and of\nvisible changes, some apparently of a volcanic character and some not,\non the moon's surface.\n\nProf. William H. Pickering, who is, perhaps, more familiar with the\ntelescopic and photographic aspects of the moon than any other American\nastronomer, has recorded numberless instances of change in minute\ndetails of the lunar landscapes. He regards some of his observations\nmade at Arequipa as \"pointing very strongly to the existence of\nvegetation upon the surface of the moon in large quantities at the\npresent time.\" The mountain-ringed valley of Plato is one of the places\nin the lunar world where the visible changes have been most frequently\nobserved, and more than one student of the moon has reached the\nconclusion that something very like the appearances that vegetation\nwould produce is to be seen in that valley.\n\nProfessor Pickering has thoroughly discussed the observations relating\nto a celebrated crater named Linn\u00e9 in the _Mare Serenitatis_, and after\nreading his description of its changes of appearance one can hardly\nreject his conclusion that Linn\u00e9 is an active volcanic vent, but\nvariable in its manifestations. This is only one of a number of similar\ninstances among the smaller craters of the moon. The giant ones are\nevidently entirely extinct, but some of the minor vents give occasional\nsigns of activity. Nor should it be assumed that these relatively slight\nmanifestations of volcanic action are really insignificant. As Professor\nPickering shows, they may be regarded as comparable with the greatest\nvolcanic phenomena now witnessed on the earth, and, speaking again of\nPlato, he says of its evidences of volcanic action:\n\n\"It is, I believe, more active than any area of similar size upon the\nearth. There seems to be no evidences of lava, but the white streaks\nindicate apparently something analogous to snow or clouds. There must be\na certain escape of gases, presumably steam and carbonic acid, the\nformer of which, probably, aids in the production of the white\nmarkings.\"[19]\n\n[Footnote 19: Annals of Harvard College Observatory, vol. xxxii, part\nii, 1900.]\n\nTo Professor Pickering we owe the suggestion that the wonderful rays\nemanating from Tycho consist of some whitish substance blown by the\nwind, not from Tycho itself, but from lines of little volcanic vents or\ncraters lying along the course of the rays. This substance may be\nvolcanic powder or snow, in the form of minute ice crystals. Mr. Elger\nremarks of this theory that the \"confused network of streaks\" around\nCopernicus seems to respond to it more happily than the rays of Tycho\ndo, because of the lack of definiteness of direction so manifest in the\ncase of the rays.\n\nAs an encouragement to amateur observers who may be disposed to find out\nfor themselves whether or not changes now take place in the moon, the\nfollowing sentence from the introduction to Professor Pickering's\nchapter on Plato in the Harvard Observatory Annals, volume xxxii, will\nprove useful and interesting:\n\n\"In reviewing the history of selenography, one must be impressed by the\nsingular fact that, while most of the astronomers who have made a\nspecial study of the moon, such as Schroeter, Maedler, Schmidt, Webb,\nNeison, and Elger, have all believed that its surface was still subject\nto changes readily visible from the earth, the great majority of\nastronomers who have paid little attention to the subject have quite as\nstrenuously denied the existence of such changes.\"\n\nIn regard to the lunar atmosphere, it may be said, in a word, that even\nthose who advocate the existence of vegetation and of clouds of dust or\nice crystals on the moon do not predicate any greater amount, or greater\ndensity, of atmosphere than do those who consider the moon to be wholly\ndead and inert. Professor Pickering himself showed, from his\nobservations, that the horizontal refraction of the lunar atmosphere,\ninstead of being less than 2\u00b4\u00b4, as formerly stated, was less than 0.4\u00b4\u00b4.\nYet he found visual evidence that on the sunlit side of the moon this\nrare atmosphere was filled to a height of four miles with some absorbing\nmedium which was absent on the dark side, and which was apparently an\nemanation from the lunar crust, occurring after sunrise. And Messrs.\nLoewy and Puiseux, of the Paris Observatory, say, after showing reasons\nfor thinking that the great volcanic eruptions belong to a recent period\nin the history of the moon, that \"the diffusion of cinders to great\ndistances infers a gaseous envelope of a certain density.... The\nresistance of the atmosphere must have been sufficient to retard the\nfall of this dust [the reference is to the white trails, like those from\nTycho], during its transport over a distance of more than 1,000\nkilometers [620 miles].\"[20]\n\n[Footnote 20: Comptes Rendus, June 23, July 3, 1899.]\n\nWe come now to a brief consideration of certain peculiarities in the\nmotions of the moon, and in the phenomena of day and night on its\nsurface. The moon keeps the same side forever turned toward the earth,\nbehaving, in this respect, as Mercury does with regard to the sun. The\nconsequence is that the lunar globe makes but one rotation on its axis\nin the course of a month, or in the course of one revolution about the\nearth. Some of the results of this practical identity of the periods of\nrotation and revolution are illustrated in the diagram on page 250. The\nmoon really undergoes considerable libration, recalling the libration of\nMercury, which was explained in the chapter on that planet, and in\nconsequence we are able to see a little way round into the opposite\nlunar hemisphere, now on this side and now on the other, but in the\ndiagram this libration has been neglected. If it had been represented we\nshould have found that, instead of only one half, about three fifths of\nthe total superficies of the moon are visible from the earth at one time\nor another.\n\n[Illustration: PHASES AND ROTATION OF THE MOON.]\n\nPerhaps it should be remarked that in drawing the moon's orbit about the\nearth as a center we offer no contradiction to what was shown earlier\nin this chapter. The moon does travel around the earth, and its orbit\nabout our globe may, for our present purpose, be treated independently\nof its motion about the sun. Let the central globe, then, represent the\nearth, and let the sun be supposed to shine from the left-hand side of\nthe diagram. A little cross is erected at a fixed spot on the globe of\nthe moon.\n\nAt _A_ the moon is between the earth and the sun, or in the phase of new\nmoon. The lunar hemisphere facing the earth is now buried in night,\nexcept so far as the light reflected from the earth illuminates it, and\nthis illumination, it is interesting to remember, is about fourteen\ntimes as great--reckoned by the relative areas of the reflecting\nsurfaces--as that which the full moon sends to the earth. An inhabitant\nof the moon, standing beside the cross, sees the earth in the form of a\nhuge full moon directly above his head, but, as far as the sun is\nconcerned, it is midnight for him.\n\nIn the course of about seven days the moon travels to _B_. In the\nmeantime it has turned one quarter of the way around its axis, and the\nspot marked by the cross is still directly under the earth. For the\nlunar inhabitant standing on that spot the sun is now on the point of\nrising, and he sees the earth no longer in the shape of a full moon, but\nin that of a half-moon. The lunar globe itself appears, at the same\ntime from the earth, as a half-moon, being in the position or phase that\nwe call first quarter.\n\nSeven more days elapse, and the moon arrives at _C_, opposite to the\nposition of the sun, and with the earth between it and the solar orb. It\nis now high noon for our lunarian standing beside the cross, while the\nearth over his head appears, if he sees it at all, only as a black disk\nclose to the sun, or--as would sometimes be the case--covering the sun,\nand encircled with a beautiful ring of light produced by the refraction\nof its atmosphere. (Recall the similar phenomenon in the case of Venus.)\nThe moon seen from the earth is now in the phase called full moon.\n\nAnother lapse of seven days, and the moon is at _D_, in the phase called\nthird quarter, while the earth, viewed from the cross on the moon, which\nis still pointed directly at it, appears again in the shape of a huge\nhalf-moon.\n\nDuring the next seven days the moon returns to its original position at\n_A_, and becomes once more new moon, with \"full earth\" shining upon it.\n\nNow it is evident that in consequence of the peculiar law of the moon's\nrotation its days and nights are each about two of our weeks, or\nfourteen days, in length. That hemisphere of the moon which is in the\nfull sunlight at _A_, for instance, is buried in the middle of night at\n_C_. The result is different than in the case of Mercury, because the\nbody toward which the moon always keeps the same face directed is not\nthe luminous sun, but the non-luminous earth.\n\nIt is believed that the moon acquired this manner of rotation in\nconsequence of the tidal friction exercised upon it by the earth. The\ntidal attraction of the earth exceeds that of the sun upon the moon\nbecause the earth is so much nearer than the sun is, and tidal\nattraction varies inversely as the cube of the distance. In fact, the\nbraking effect of tidal friction varies inversely as the sixth power of\nthe distance, so that the ability of the earth to stop the rotation of\nthe moon on its axis is immensely greater than that of the sun. This\npower was effectively applied while the moon was yet a molten mass, so\nthat it is probable that the moon has rotated just as it does now for\nmillions of years.\n\nAs was remarked a little while ago, the moon traveling in an elliptical\norbit about the earth has a libratory movement which, if represented in\nour picture, would cause the cross to swing now a little one way and now\na little the other, and thus produce an apparent pendulum motion of the\nearth in the sky, similar to that of the sun as seen from Mercury. But\nit is not necessary to go into the details of this phenomenon. The\nreader, if he chooses, can deduce them for himself.\n\nBut we may inquire a little into the effects of the long days and nights\nof the moon. In consequence of the extreme rarity of the lunar\natmosphere, it is believed that the heat of the sun falling upon it\nduring a day two weeks in length, is radiated away so rapidly that the\nsurface of the lunar rocks never rises above the freezing temperature\nof water. On the night side, with no warm atmospheric blanket such as\nthe earth enjoys, the temperature may fall far toward absolute zero, the\nmost merciful figure that has been suggested for it being 200\u00b0 below the\nzero of our ordinary thermometers! But there is much uncertainty about\nthe actual temperature on the moon, and different experiments, in the\nattempt to make a direct measurement of it, have yielded discordant\nresults. At one time, for instance, Lord Rosse believed he had\ndemonstrated that at lunar noon the temperature of the rocks rose above\nthe boiling-point of water. But afterward he changed his mind and\nfavored the theory of a low temperature.\n\nIn this and in other respects much remains to be discovered concerning\nour interesting satellite, and there is plenty of room, and an abundance\nof original occupation, for new observers of the lunar world.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nHOW TO FIND THE PLANETS\n\n\nThere is no reason why everybody should not know the principal planets\nat sight nearly as well as everybody knows the moon. It only requires a\nlittle intelligent application to become acquainted with the other\nworlds that have been discussed in the foregoing chapters, and to be\nable to follow their courses through the sky and recognize them wherever\nthey appear. No telescope, or any other instrument whatever, is required\nfor the purpose. There is but one preliminary requirement, just as every\nbranch of human knowledge presupposes its A B C. This is an acquaintance\nwith the constellations and the principal stars--not a difficult thing\nto obtain.\n\nAlmost everybody knows the \"Great Dipper\" from childhood's days,\nexcept, perhaps, those who have had the misfortune to spend their youth\nunder the glare of city lights. Some know Orion when he shines\ngloriously in the winter heavens. Many are able to point out the north\nstar, or pole star, as everybody should be able to do. All this forms a\ngood beginning, and may serve as the basis for the rapid acquirement of\na general knowledge of the geography of the heavens.\n\nIf you are fortunate enough to number an astronomer among your\nacquaintance--an amateur will do as well as a professor--you may, with\nhis aid, make a short cut to a knowledge of the stars. Otherwise you\nmust depend upon books and charts. My Astronomy with an Opera-Glass was\nprepared for this very purpose. For simply learning the constellations\nand the chief stars you need no opera-glass or other instrument. With\nthe aid of the charts, familiarize yourself with the appearance of the\nconstellations by noticing the characteristic arrangements of their\nchief stars. You need pay no attention to any except the bright stars,\nand those that are conspicuous enough to thrust themselves upon your\nattention.\n\nLearn by observation at what seasons particular constellations are on,\nor near, the meridian--i.e., the north and south line through the middle\nof the heavens. Make yourself especially familiar with the so-called\nzodiacal constellations, which are, in their order, running around the\nheavens from west to east: Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo,\nLibra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricornus, Aquarius, and Pisces. The\nimportance of these particular constellations arises from the fact that\nit is across them that the tracks of the planets lie, and when you are\nfamiliar with the fixed stars belonging to them you will be able\nimmediately to recognize a stranger appearing among them, and will\ncorrectly conclude that it is one of the planets.[21] How to tell\nwhich planet it may be, it is the object of this chapter to show you. As\nan indispensable aid--unless you happen already to possess a complete\nstar atlas on a larger scale--I have drawn the six charts of the\nzodiacal constellations and their neighbors that are included in this\nchapter.\n\n[Footnote 21: In our latitudes, planets are never seen in the northern\nquarter of the sky. When on the meridian, they are always somewhere\nbetween the zenith and the southern horizon.]\n\n[Illustration: CHART NO. 1.--FROM RIGHT ASCENSION 0 HOURS TO 4 HOURS;\nDECLINATION 30\u00b0 NORTH TO 10\u00b0 SOUTH.]\n\nHaving learned to recognize the constellations and their chief stars on\nsight, one other step, an extremely easy one, remains to be taken before\nbeginning your search for the planets--buy the American Ephemeris and\nNautical Almanac for the current year. It is published under the\ndirection of the United States Naval Observatory at Washington, and can\nbe purchased for one dollar.\n\nThis book, which may appear to you rather bulky and formidable for an\nalmanac, contains hundreds of pages and scores of tables to which you\nneed pay no attention. They are for navigators and astronomers, and are\nmuch more innocent than they look. The plain citizen, seeking only an\nintroduction to the planets, can return their stare and pass by,\nwithout feeling in the least humiliated.\n\n[Illustration: CHART NO. 2.--FROM RIGHT ASCENSION 4 HOURS TO 8 HOURS;\nDECLINATION 30\u00b0 NORTH TO 10\u00b0 SOUTH.]\n\nIn the front part of the book, after the long calendar, and the tables\nrelating to the sun and the moon, will be found about thirty pages of\ntables headed, in large black letters, with the names of the\nplanets--Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, etc. Two months are\nrepresented on each page, and opposite the number of each successive day\nof the month the position of the planet is given in hours, minutes, and\nseconds of right ascension, and degrees, minutes, and seconds of north\nand south declination, the sign + meaning north, and the sign - south.\nDo not trouble yourself with the seconds in either column, and take the\nminutes only when the number is large. The hours of right ascension and\nthe degrees of declination are the main things to be noticed.\n\nRight ascension, by the way, expresses the distance of a celestial body,\nsuch as a star or a planet, east of the vernal equinox, or the first\npoint of Aries, which is an arbitrary point on the equator of the\nheavens, which serves, like the meridian of Greenwich on the earth, as a\nstarting-place for reckoning longitude. The entire circuit of the\nheavens along the equator is divided into twenty-four hours of right\nascension, each hour covering 15\u00b0 of space. If a planet then is in right\nascension (usually printed for short R.A.) 0 h. 0 m. 0 s., it is on the\nmeridian of the vernal equinox, or the celestial Greenwich; if it is in\nR.A. 1 h., it will be found 15\u00b0 east of the vernal equinox, and so on.\n\n[Illustration: CHART NO. 3.--FROM RIGHT ASCENSION 8 HOURS TO 12 HOURS;\nDECLINATION 30\u00b0 NORTH TO 10\u00b0 SOUTH.]\n\nDeclination (printed D. or Dec.) expresses the distance of a celestial\nbody north or south of the equator of the heavens.\n\nWith these explanations we may proceed to find a planet by the aid of\nthe Nautical Almanac and our charts. I take, for example, the ephemeris\nfor the year 1901, and I look under the heading \"Jupiter\" on page 239,\nfor the month of July. Opposite the 15th day of the month I find the\nright ascension to be 18 h. 27 m., neglecting the seconds. Now 27\nminutes are so near to half an hour that, for our purposes, we may say\nJupiter is in R.A. 18 h. 30 m. I set this down on a slip of paper, and\nthen examine the declination column, where I find that on July 15\nJupiter is in south declination (the sign - meaning south, as before\nexplained) 23\u00b0 17\u00b4 52\u00b4\u00b4, which is almost 23\u00b0 18\u00b4, and, for our purposes,\nwe may call this 23\u00b0 20\u00b4, which is what I set down on my slip.\n\n[Illustration: CHART NO. 4.--FROM RIGHT ASCENSION 12 HOURS TO 16 HOURS;\nDECLINATION 10\u00b0 NORTH TO 30\u00b0 SOUTH.]\n\nNext, I turn to Chart No. 5, in this chapter, where I find the meridian\nline of R.A. 18 h. running through the center of the chart. I know that\nJupiter is to be looked for about 30 m. east, or to the left, of that\nline. At the bottom and top of the chart, every twenty minutes of R.A.\nis indicated, so that it is easy, with the eye, or with the aid of a\nruler, to place the vertical line at some point of which Jupiter is to\nbe found.\n\n[Illustration: CHART NO. 5.--FROM RIGHT ASCENSION 16 HOURS TO 20 HOURS;\nDECLINATION 10\u00b0 NORTH TO 30\u00b0 SOUTH.]\n\nThen I consult my note of the declination of the planet. It is south 23\u00b0\n20\u00b4. On the vertical borders of the chart I find the figures of the\ndeclination, and I observe that 0\u00b0 Dec., which represents the equator of\nthe heavens, is near the top of the chart, while each parallel\nhorizontal line across the chart indicates 10\u00b0 north or south of its\nnext neighbor. Next to the bottom of the chart I find the parallel of\n20\u00b0, and I see that every five degrees is indicated by the figures at\nthe sides. By the eye, or with the aid of a ruler, I easily estimate\nwhere the horizontal line of 23\u00b0 would fall, and since 20\u00b4 is the third\nof a degree I perceive that it is, for the rough purpose of merely\nfinding a conspicuous planet, negligible, although it, too, can be\nincluded in the estimate, if thought desirable.\n\nHaving already found the vertical line on which Jupiter is placed and\nhaving now found the horizontal line also, I have simply to regard their\ncrossing point, which will be the situation of the planet among the\nstars. I note that it is in the constellation Sagittarius in a certain\nposition with reference to a familiar group of stars in that\nconstellation, and when I look at the heavens, there, in the place thus\nindicated, Jupiter stands revealed.\n\n[Illustration: CHART NO. 6.--FROM RIGHT ASCENSION 20 HOURS TO 24 HOURS\n(0 II.); DECLINATION 10\u00b0 NORTH TO 30\u00b0 SOUTH.]\n\nThe reader will readily perceive that, in a precisely similar manner,\nany planet can be located, at any time of the year, and at any point in\nits course about the heavens. But it may turn out that the place\noccupied by the planet is too near the sun to render it easily, or at\nall, visible. Such a case can be recognized, either from a general\nknowledge of the location of the constellations at various seasons, or\nwith the aid of the Nautical Almanac, where at the beginning of each set\nof monthly tables in the calendar the sun's right ascension and\ndeclination will be found. In locating the sun, if you find that its\nright ascension differs by less than an hour, one way or the other, from\nthat of the planet sought, it is useless to look for the latter. If the\nplanet is situated west of the sun--to the right on the chart--then it\nis to be looked for in the east before sunrise. But if it is east of the\nsun--to the left on the chart--then you must seek it in the west after\nsunset.\n\nFor instance, I look for the planet Mercury on October 12, 1901. I find\nits R.A. to be 14 h. 40 m. and its Dec. 18\u00b0 36\u00b4. Looking at the sun's\nplace for October 12th, I find it to be R.A. 13 h. 8 m. and Dec. 7\u00b0 14\u00b4.\nPlacing them both on Chart No. 4, I discover that Mercury is well to the\neast, or left hand of the sun, and will consequently be visible in the\nwestern sky after sundown.\n\nAdditional guidance will be found by noting the following facts about\nthe charts:\n\nThe meridian (the north and south line) runs through the middle of Chart\nNo. 1 between 11 and 12 o'clock P.M. on November 1st, between 9 and 10\no'clock P.M. on December 1st, and between 7 and 8 o'clock P.M. on\nJanuary 1st.\n\nThe meridian runs through the middle of Chart No. 2 between 11 and 12\no'clock P.M. on January 1st, between 9 and 10 o'clock P.M. on February\n1st, and between 7 and 8 o'clock P.M. on March 1st.\n\nThe meridian runs through the middle of Chart No. 3 between 11 and 12\no'clock P.M. on March 1st, between 9 and 10 o'clock P.M. on April 1st,\nand between 7 and 8 o'clock P.M. on May 1st.\n\nThe meridian runs through the middle of Chart No. 4 between 11 and 12\no'clock P.M. on May 1st, between 9 and 10 o'clock P.M. on June 1st, and\nbetween 7 and 8 o'clock P.M. on July 1st.\n\nThe meridian runs through the middle of Chart No. 5 between 11 and 12\no'clock P.M. on July 1st, between 9 and 10 o'clock P.M. on August 1st,\nand between 7 and 8 o'clock P.M. on September 1st.\n\nThe meridian runs through the middle of Chart No. 6 between 11 and 12\no'clock P.M. on September 1st, between 9 and 10 o'clock P.M. on October\n1st, and between 7 and 8 o'clock P.M. on November 1st.\n\nNote well, also, these particulars about the charts: Chart No. 1\nincludes the first four hours of right ascension, from 0 h. to 4 h.\ninclusive; Chart No. 2 includes 4 h. to 8 h.; Chart No. 3, 8 h. to 12\nh.; Chart No. 4, 12 h. to 16 h.; Chart No. 5, 16 h. to 20 h.; and Chart\nNo. 6, 20 h. to 24 h., which completes the circuit. In the first three\ncharts the line of 0\u00b0, or the equator, is found near the bottom, and in\nthe last three near the top. This is a matter of convenience in\narrangement, based upon the fact that the ecliptic, which, and not the\nequator, marks the center of the zodiac, indicates the position of the\ntracks of the planets among the stars; and the ecliptic, being inclined\n23\u00b0 to the plane of the equator, lies half to the north and half to the\nsouth of the latter.\n\nThose who, after all, may not care to consult the ephemeris in order to\nfind the planets, may be able to locate them, simply from a knowledge of\ntheir situation among the constellations. Some ordinary almanacs tell in\nwhat constellations the principal planets are to be found at various\ntimes of the year. Having once found them in this way, it is\ncomparatively easy to keep track of them thereafter through a general\nknowledge of their movements. Jupiter, for instance, requiring a period\nof nearly twelve years to make a single journey around the sun, moves\nabout 30\u00b0 eastward among the stars every year. The zodiacal\nconstellations are roughly about 30\u00b0 in length, and as Jupiter was in\nSagittarius in 1901, he will be in Capricornus in 1902. Saturn,\nrequiring nearly thirty years for a revolution around the sun, moves\nonly between 12\u00b0 and 13\u00b0 eastward every year, and, being in conjunction\nwith Jupiter in Sagittarius in 1901, does not get beyond the border of\nthat constellation in 1902.\n\nJupiter having been in opposition to the sun June 30, 1901, will be\nsimilarly placed early in August, 1902, the time from one opposition of\nJupiter to the next being 399 days.\n\nSaturn passes from one opposition to the next in 378 days, so that\nhaving been in that position July 5, 1901, it reaches it again about\nJuly 18, 1902.\n\nMars requires about 687 days to complete a revolution, and comes into\nconjunction with the earth, or opposition to the sun--the best position\nfor observation--on the average once every 780 days. Mars was in\nopposition near the end of February, 1901, and some of its future\noppositions will be in March, 1903; May, 1905; July, 1907; and\nSeptember, 1909. The oppositions of 1907 and 1909 will be unusually\nfavorable ones, for they will occur when the planet is comparatively\nnear the earth. When a planet is in opposition to the sun it is on the\nmeridian, the north and south line, at midnight.\n\nMercury and Venus being nearer the sun than the earth is, can never be\nseen very far from the place of the sun itself. Venus recedes much\nfarther from the solar orb than Mercury does, but both are visible only\nin the sunset or the sunrise sky. All almanacs tell at what times these\nplanets play their respective r\u00f4les as morning or as evening stars. In\nthe case of Mercury about 116 days on the average elapse between its\nreappearances; in the case of Venus, about 584 days. The latter, for\ninstance, having become an evening star at the end of April, 1901, will\nbecome an evening star again in December, 1902.\n\nWith the aid of the Nautical Almanac and the charts the amateur will\nfind no difficulty, after a little practise, in keeping track of any of\nthe planets.\n\nIn the back part of the Nautical Almanac will be found two pages headed\n\"Phenomena: Planetary Configurations.\" With the aid of these the student\ncan determine the position of the planets with respect to the sun and\nthe moon, and with respect to one another. The meaning of the various\nsymbols used in the tables will be found explained on a page facing the\ncalendar at the beginning of the book. From these tables, among other\nthings, the times of greatest elongation from the sun of the planets\nMercury and Venus can be found.\n\nIt may be added that only bright stars, and stars easily seen, are\nincluded in the charts, and there will be no danger of mistaking any of\nthese stars for a planet, if the observer first carefully learns to\nrecognize their configurations. Neither Mars, Jupiter, nor Saturn ever\nappears as faint as any of the stars, except those of the first\nmagnitude, included in the charts. Uranus and Neptune being invisible to\nthe naked eye--Uranus can occasionally be just glimpsed by a keen\neye--are too faint to be found without the aid of more effective\nappliances.\n\n\n\n\nINDEX\n\n\nAgassiz, Alexander, on deep-sea animals, 63.\n\nAsteroids, the, 16, 129.\n  brightness of, 130.\n  imaginary adventures on, 146.\n  life on, 144.\n  number of, known, 129.\n  orbits of, 132.\n  origin of, 138, 143.\n  size of, 129.\n\nAristarchus, lunar crater, 226.\n\nAtmosphere, importance of, 20.\n\n\nBailey, Solon I., on oppositions of Eros, 134.\n\nBarnard, E.E., discovers fifth satellite of Jupiter, 181.\n  measures asteroids, 129.\n  on Saturn's rings, 205.\n\nBelopolski, on rotation of Venus, 79.\n\n\nCeres, an asteroid, 129, 130.\n\nClefts in the moon, 226.\n\nCopernicus, lunar crater, 223, 242.\n\n\nDarwin, George H., on Jupiter and Saturn, 206.\n  on origin of moon, 235.\n  theory of tidal friction, 32.\n\nDavy, Sir Humphry, on Saturn, 190.\n\nDawes sees canals on Mars, 93.\n\nDeimos, satellite of Mars, 125.\n\nDenning, W.F., description of Jupiter, 175.\n\nDe Vico on rotation of Venus, 76.\n\nDewar, James, discovers free hydrogen in air, 232.\n\nDe Witt discovers Eros, 133.\n\nDick, Thomas, on Saturn, 201.\n\nDouglass, A.E., sees Mars's canals, 92.\n  sees clouds in Mars, 119.\n\nDoppler's principle, 79, 200.\n\n\nEarth and moon's orbit, 217.\n  birth of moon from, 236.\n  change of distance from sun, 27.\n  less advanced than Mars, 89.\n  older than Venus, 58.\n  seen from Mercury, 41.\n  seen from Venus, 69-71, 75.\n  seen from moon, 214.\n\nEarth, similarity to Venus, 46.\n  supposed signals to and from Mars, 110.\n\nElger, T.G., on cracks in moon, 227.\n  on Tycho's rays, 246.\n\nEphemeris, how to use, 260, 264.\n\nEros, an asteroid, 131-134, 136, 137.\n\n\nFlammarion, C., observes Venus's atmosphere, 56.\n  on plurality of worlds, 8.\n\nForbes, Prof. George, on ultra-Neptunian planet, 210.\n\n\nGalileo on lunar world, 215.\n\nGravity, as affecting life on planets, 20, 46.\n\n\nHall, Asaph, discovers Mars's moons, 90.\n\nHerodotus, lunar crater, 227.\n\nHerschel, Sir John, on Saturn, 185.\n\nHolden, E.S., on photograph of lunar crater, 242.\n\nHuggins on Mercury's atmosphere, 21.\n\n\nInhabitants of foreign planets, 1, 4, 5.\n\nInterplanetary communication, 1, 3, 72, 110, 112.\n\n\nJuno, an asteroid, 129.\n\nJupiter, cloudy aspect of, 165.\n  density of, 162.\n  distance of, 161.\n  equatorial belts on, 165.\n  future of, 180.\n  gravity on, 162.\n  great red spot on, 169.\n  markings outside the belts, 168.\n  and the nebular theory, 178.\n  once a companion star, 179.\n  polar compression of, 161.\n  possibly yet incandescent, 177.\n  question of a denser core, 176.\n  resemblance of, to sun, 174.\n  rotation of, 161, 173.\n  satellites of, 166, 181.\n  seen from satellites, 182.\n  size of, 160.\n  solar light and heat on, 182.\n  south belt of, 172.\n  surface conditions of, 163.\n  theories about the red spot, 170.\n  trade-winds and the belts of, 167.\n  various rates of rotation of, 173.\n  visibility of rotation of, 166.\n\n\nKeeler, J.E., on Saturn's rings, 200.\n\nKepler, lunar crater, 223.\n\nKinetic theory of gases, 116.\n\nKirkwood, Daniel, on asteroids, 131.\n\n\nLagrange on Olbers's theory, 139.\n\nLick Observatory and Mars's canals, 92.\n\nLife, a planetary phenomenon, 10.\n  in sea depths, 62.\n  on planets, 62, 63.\n  prime requisites of, 64.\n  resisting extreme cold, 123.\n  universality of, 9.\n\nLoewy and Puiseux, on lunar atmosphere, 248.\n  on lunar \"seas,\" 234.\n\nLowell, Percival, description of Mars, 108.\n  on markings of Venus, 60.\n  on Mercury's rotation, 33.\n  on rotation of Venus, 77.\n  sees Mars's canals, 92.\n  theory of Martian canals, 101.\n\nLucian, on appearance of earth from moon, 213.\n\nLyman, C.S., observes Venus's atmosphere, 55.\n\n\nMars, age of, 89.\n  atmosphere of, 86, 115, 117.\n  bands of life on, 104.\n  canals on, 90.\n    described by Schiaparelli, 93.\n    gemination of, 91, 105.\n    have builders of, disappeared?

GROOS.\n\nThe Play of Man.\n\nBy KARL GROOS, Professor of Philosophy in the University of Basel, and\nauthor of \"The Play of Animals.\" Translated, with the author's\ncooperation, by Elizabeth L. Baldwin, and edited, with a Preface and\nAppendix, by Prof. J. Mark Baldwin, of Princeton University. 12mo.\nCloth, $1.50 net; postage, 12 cents additional.\n\n     The results of Professor Groos's original and acute investigations\n     are of peculiar value to those who are interested in psychology and\n     sociology, and they are of great importance to educators. He\n     presents the anthropological aspects of the subject treated in his\n     psychological study of the Play of Animals, which has already\n     become a classic. Professor Groos, who agrees with the followers of\n     Weismann, develops the great importance of the child's play as\n     tending to strengthen his inheritance in the acquisition of\n     adaptations to his environment. The influence of play on character,\n     and its relation to education, are suggestively indicated. The\n     playful manifestations affecting the child himself and those\n     affecting his relations to others have been carefully classified,\n     and the reader is led from the simpler exercises of the sensory\n     apparatus through a variety of divisions to inner imitations and\n     social play. The biological, \u00e6sthetic, ethical, and pedagogical\n     standpoints receive much attention from the investigator. While\n     this book is an illuminating contribution to scientific literature,\n     it is of eminently practical value. Its illustrations and lessons\n     will be studied and applied by educators, and the importance of\n     this original presentation of a most fertile subject will be\n     appreciated by parents as well as by those who are interested as\n     general students of sociological and psychological themes.\n\nD.

By\nJAMES HARRISON WILSON, A.M., LL.D., late Major-General United States\nVolunteers, and Brevet Major-General United States Army. Third edition,\nrevised throughout, enlarged, and reset. 12mo. Cloth, $1.75.\n\n     General Wilson's second visit to China and his recent active\n     service in that country have afforded exceptional chances for a\n     knowledge of present conditions and the possibilities of the\n     future. In the light of the information thus obtained at first hand\n     in the country itself, General Wilson is enabled to write with a\n     peculiar authoritativeness in this edition, which brings his study\n     of China down to the present day. In addition to the new chapters\n     which have been added explaining the origin and development of the\n     Boxer insurrection, the relief of the legations, and the outlook\n     for the future, the author has revised his book throughout, and has\n     added much valuable matter in the course of his narrative. This\n     book, which is therefore in many respects new, puts the reader in\n     possession of a broad and comprehensive knowledge of Chinese\n     affairs, and this includes the latest phases of the subject. The\n     practical and discriminating character of the author's study of\n     China will be appreciated more than ever at this time when\n     practical questions relating to Chinese administration, commerce,\n     and other matters of the first importance, are engaging so much\n     attention.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://www.gutenberg.org/about/contact\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
