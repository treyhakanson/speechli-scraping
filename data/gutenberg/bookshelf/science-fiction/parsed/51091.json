RUZIC\n\n                         Illustrated by DILLON\n\n           [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n                  Galaxy Science Fiction March 1957.\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n\n\n             There wasn't a single mistake in the plan for\n              survival--and that was the biggest mistake!\n\n\nFor centuries, the rains swept eight million daily tons of land into\nthe sea. Mountains slowly crumpled to ocean floors. Summits rose again\nto see new civilizations heaped upon fossils of the old.\n\nIt was the way of the Earth and men knew it and did not worry. The end\nwas always in the future. Ever since men first learned to make marks on\ncave walls, the end remained in the future.\n\nThen the future came. The records told men how the Sun was before, so\nthey knew it was swollen now. They knew the heat was not always this\nhot, or the glacier waters so fast, the seas so high.\n\nThey adapted--they grew tanner and moved farther pole-ward.\n\nWhen the steam finally rose over equatorial waters, they moved to the\nlast planet, Pluto, and their descendants lived and died and came to\nknow the same heat and red skies. Finally there came the day when they\ncouldn't adapt--not, at least, in the usual way.\n\nBut they had the knowledge of all the great civilizations on Earth, so\nthey built the last spaceship.\n\nThey built it very slowly and carefully. Their will to live became\nthe will to leave this final, perfect monument. It took a hundred and\nfifty years and during all that time they planned every facet of its\noperation, every detail of its complex mechanisms. Because the ship had\na big job to do, they named it _Destiny_ and people began to think of\nit not as the last of the spaceships, but as the first.\n\nThe dying race sowed the ship with human seed and hopefully named its\nunborn passengers Adam, Eve, Joseph and Mary. Then they launched it\ntoward the middle of the Milky Way and lay back in the red light of\ntheir burning planet.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll this was only a memory now, conserved in the think-tank of a\nmachine that raced through speckled space, dodging, examining,\nclassifying, charting what it saw. Behind, the Sun shrank as once it\nswelled, and the planets that were not consumed turned cold in their\norbits. The Sun grew fainter and went out, and still the ship sped\nforward, century after century, cometlike, but with a purpose.\n\nAt many of the specks, the ship circled, sucking in records, passing\njudgment, moving on--a bee in the garden of stars. Finally, hundreds\nof light-years from what had been its home, it located an Earth-type\nworld, accepted it from a billion miles off, and swung into an approach\nthat would last exactly eighteen years.\n\nImmediately, pumps delivered measured quantities of oxygen and nitrogen\natoms. Circuits closed to move four tiny frozen eggs next to frozen\nspermatozoa. The temperature gradually increased to a heat once\nmaintained by animals now extinct.\n\nThe embryos grew healthily and at term were born of plastic wombs.\n\nThe first voices they heard were of their real mothers. Soft, caressing\nsongwords. Melodious, warm, recorded women voices, each different,\nbell-clear, vivacious, betraying nothing of the fact that they were\ndead these long centuries.\n\n\"I am your mother,\" each voice told its belated offspring. \"You can see\nme and hear me and touch what appears to be me, and together with your\ncousins, you'll grow strong and healthy....\"\n\nThe voices sang on and the babies gurgled in their imported terran\natmosphere. The words were meaningless but important, for it had been\nlearned on the now dead world that these sounds were one of the factors\nin love and learning.\n\nDay after day, the voices lapped warm over the children. Plastic\nfeeders provided nutrition as noiseless pumps removed excess carbon\ndioxide.\n\nIn one end of the ship, a miniature farm was born hydroponically, its\nautomatic grinders pre-digesting ripe vegetables for the children.\nAnimals were born, too, for food, but also companionship, and later to\nstock New Earth ahead.\n\nAs the babies began to understand, the woman voices merged into\none mechanical mother who could be heard and seen and summoned on\npanel screens throughout the ship. Everything became as Earthlike as\npossible, but because the environment was artificial, the children grew\naware of their purpose in life at an age rarely reached on ancient\nEarth.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey were two years old when their Mecmother informed them: \"You are\nunlike any children ever born. You are the last of a dead race, but\nyou must live. You must not be afraid. You must do everything humanly\npossible to live.\"\n\nWhen they were four, Mecmother introduced them to Mecteacher and said\nto pay attention for five hours each day. Mecteacher took their IQs and\nexplained to Adam that he had a greater capacity than Eve, Joseph and\nMary, and was therefore their leader.\n\nSoon afterward, all the children started \"school,\" but Adam excelled.\nAt seven, he knew all about landing the ship. He played that he was\nalready eighteen and the ship was no longer on automatic.\n\nHe was in everything and everywhere. His tow hair poked above the\ncontrol board. His busy fingers hand-picked an experimental meal from\nthe farmroom. When he learned how to turn the artificial gravity switch\noff in the recroom, his child legs floated haphazardly somewhere above\nhis head. And in the sunroom, where heat-lamp walls were triggered by\nthe degree of an occupant's tan, Adam's freckled face stared through\nthe visiport, seeing in his mind's eye the New Earth he would one day\nconquer.\n\nHe lived fully, asking questions, accepting the answers, receiving\ninstructions. Some of them he testily disobeyed, was punished\ncompassionately, and learned respect and a kind of love for the mecs.\n\nHe played the games of childhood, but he played them alone. Once he was\ngazing out a port, imaginatively sorting the stars of his universe into\nshapes of the animals in the ship's farm. Mecfather lit up at a nearby\npanel, glowing faintly red. Adam resisted an impulse to shiver--the\npanel always made him flinch when it glowed red. Red, he was being\nconditioned, was his conscience, brought out by Mecfather until he grew\nold enough to bring it out himself.\n\n\"Why aren't you playing with the other children?\" Mecfather asked.\n\"I've been watching you all day and you've avoided them on every\noccasion.\"\n\nThough he feared him, Adam loved Mecfather as he had been taught to\ndo and did not hesitate to confide. But how could he explain that the\nother children did not seem as _real_ to him as the mecs?\n\n\"I don't know,\" Adam answered truthfully.\n\n\"They don't ignore you. They ask you to play, but you always go off by\nyourself. Don't you like them?\"\n\n\"They're flat, Father. They're not deep--like you.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSilent hidden computers assembled the answer, correlated, circuited a\nmechanical smile. Certainly--a child brought up with only three real\nchildren and three talking images in his universe could not distinguish\nbetween reality and appearance. On the screen, Adam saw Mecfather\nsmile, the panel no longer red.\n\nThe voice was quiet now and full of understanding. \"It is I who am\nflat, Adam. I am only an image, a voice. I am here when you need me to\nhelp, but I am not deep. Your cousins are deep; I am the flat one. You\nwill understand better when you grow older.\"\n\nElectronically, Mecfather was worried. He called a \"conference\" of the\nother mecs and their circuits joined in a complicated analog: What was\nthe probable outcome of this beginning of disharmony? There were too\nmany variables for an immediate answer, but the query was stored in\neach mec's memory banks for later answer.\n\nWhen the mecconference began, the panel switched off and Adam walked\nthoughtfully through the ship's corridors. Unexpectedly, he spotted the\nother children. He turned quickly into a room before they saw him and\nducked behind the largest of the couches.\n\nHe was in the aft recroom, he realized, not having paid attention to\nwhere he was going. What was it all about? Did Mecfather really mean it\nwhen he said the cousins were deeper than the mecs? Adam could believe\nhe was different from his parents and teacher--after all, he was\nonly seven--but he couldn't accept the information that he was _not_\ndifferent from his cousins. Somehow, he thought, I am alone....\n\nHe heard noises, the loud boisterousness of Joseph, the high-pitched\nsqueal of Eve, the grating laugh of Mary. Adam cringed deeper behind\nthe big couch. He _was_ different. _He_ didn't make sounds like that.\n\n\"Adam! Oh, A-dam! A-dam!\" the cousins called, each their own way. \"Come\nout wherever you are, Adam! Come out and play!\"\n\nFrom behind the couch, Adam saw the beginnings of an infantile but\nsystematic search. The three of them were looking behind things, under\nfurniture, in back of hatches. They tried moving everything they saw,\nbut couldn't budge the heavy couch Adam hid behind.\n\nLooking for escape, Adam's eyes caught a round metallic handle set\nflush into the heavy deck carpet. He lifted it and pulled. Nothing\nhappened. He stood up, bracing his feet against the deck and heaved\nwith all his strength. It didn't move.\n\nThen he experimentally turned the handle--to the right until it\nclicked faintly, then the left, around twice, another faint click, but\ndifferent, a left-hand click, he knew somehow. So he turned again to\nthe left, this time three turns--and then the click was heavy, almost\naudible. He pulled the handle and a door formed out of the carpet,\nswinging easily open.\n\nJust then, Joseph peered behind the couch. \"Boo!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAdam jumped into the opening, the heavy door slamming shut overhead.\nBelow, he stood erect and was surprised to feel the hair on his head\nbrush the ceiling.\n\nHe was frightened, but he calmed when he realized there were many\nplaces on the ship he hadn't been before. Mecteacher revealed them\nto him, but very slowly, and he supposed he would not be told about\n_everything_ for many years. As he recovered his sense of balance, he\nbecame aware of a faint luminescence around him. It seemed to have no\nsource, but was stronger in the distance.\n\nHe began to explore, groping at first, then more smoothly, efficiently,\nas his eyes adjusted to the semi-darkness. A long corridor opened\nup before him and what appeared before to be an illusion of distance\nactually _was_ distance. He guessed he was near the engine compartment\nand vaguely sensed that the luminescence had something to do with the\nnuclear engines that Mecteacher told him moved the ship.\n\nIt was warm in here. Not physically warm but friendy warm, like when\nMecmother spoke her comfort. The similarity almost made him cry, for he\nunderstood, even in his seven years, that Mecmother was but the image\nof his real mother who lived long ago and said those words of sympathy\nto a child yet unborn. He wanted her now, even her image, but he didn't\ncall because he'd have to explain why he was hiding from his cousins.\n\nHe shivered then, thinking that Mecfather and Mecteacher knew where\nhe was and would light up their panels red. He thought, \"Are you down\nhere, Mecfather?\" Nothing answered, so he spoke the thought, and again\nthe walls stayed dark.\n\nThat was why it was so friendy warm in here, he realized. His\nmecconscience was left above!\n\nDeciding that the others might miss him, he retraced his steps, located\nthe trapdoor in the ceiling, pushed it open and ascended. The others\nwere sitting on the floor, dumbfounded, as Adam climbed out and\nslammed the hatch shut.\n\n\"How did you get down there?\" Joseph asked.\n\nAdam remained silent. After a moment, Eve and Mary lost interest in the\nquestion and started skipping a length of rope.\n\nJoseph persisted. \"How? I pulled, too!\"\n\nAdam didn't answer. He knew the bigger boy would forget about it if he\nchanged the subject. \"How is it you're not with Mecteacher?\"\n\n\"We were. But he made us look for you.\"\n\nThe closest wall panel lit bright red. It was Mecteacher. \"_Adam! How\ndid you open that?_\"\n\n\"I turned it--a certain way,\" he said evasively. Adam didn't want his\ncousins to learn how.\n\n\"But how did you know?\"\n\n\"I--I reasoned it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe image faded as the new information was assimilated. Mecteacher's\nvoice said, \"Wait a while, Adam.\"\n\nThe computer circuited the other mec's memory banks. After ten minutes,\nthe \"conference\" was over and Mecteacher returned to the screen. He\nasked Adam to come alone to the classroom. The others were dismissed.\n\nReluctantly, Adam did as he was told. In the classroom, he stood\nstiffly in front of the central panels. All three mecs lit up, their\ncolor this time a tranquilizing blue.\n\n\"Adam, we are not real people in the _now_,\" Mecmother began. \"Do you\nunderstand that?\"\n\n\"Y-yes, I understand. You are--planned--fixed before.\"\n\n\"That's right, Adam. We are pre-set. We have a very large number of\nchoices and actions, but we are not infinite.\"\n\n\"Infinite?\"\n\n\"We are limited in the help we can give you. We were real--like you--a\nlong, long time ago. We exist now only to help you and the other\nchildren. We are here to educate you, to love and console you--and one\nother thing. We are here to settle your conflicts, to make sure you\ndon't hurt each other.\"\n\n\"But I didn't hurt anyone, Mecmother!\"\n\n\"Not yet, Adam, but avoiding the others the way you do could be the\nfirst sign of trouble.\"\n\n\"How do you _know_? How can you talk if you aren't real?\"\n\n\"What you hear is a combination of recorded words that are\nelectronically put together to answer an almost infinite number of your\nquestions. But do not think of me as not real. I was merely in another\ntime. Do you understand that?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then you also are able to see that your ability to reason things--to\nunderstand what I am telling you now, for instance, is a remarkable\nthing.\"\n\n\"You mean because I'm not like the others?\"\n\n\"You have a superior mind. You are the leader, but do not regard\nyourself as better than the others. You have more intelligence, yes,\nbut do not look down on your cousins for that. They may develop other\nqualities better than yours. Stay simple, Adam, and you will be able to\nlive among them and thereby make the human race live again. The name of\nthis ship is _Destiny_. Do you know why?\"\n\n\"Yes--I know.\"\n\n\"Be with the other children then. Play with them. You'll need each\nother to live on New Earth--eleven years from now.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe thought sullenly, how can I play with them when they're _flat_? But\nhe didn't object out loud to Mecmother. He didn't like her this way.\nExplanation was Mecteacher's job and discipline Mecfather's. Mecmother\nshould be warm and loving.\n\nMecteacher appeared and asked Adam to call in the other children so the\nscience lesson could start.\n\nHe found them tanning in the sunroom, their unclothed bodies evenly\nbrowned from invisible light. They followed Adam without question, but\nseemed to take a long time doing it. Joseph insisted first in donning\nclothes, but he put on protective clothing first. Then, realizing the\nabsurdity of it, he switched to his formality suit--the loose-fitting\nrobe Mecteacher instructed the children to wear to lend dignity to the\nclasswork.\n\nDuring Joseph's delay, the girls ambled off somewhere and returned only\nwhen Adam shouted after them in exasperation. Quickening his pace,\nAdam reached the classroom first and asked Mecteacher, \"Are the other\nchildren--deep?\"\n\n\"Deep? Yes, Adam, Mecfather explained that to you. Why are you\nconfused? It's us, the mecs, who are flat. The other children are\nhealthy, living beings. The cells from which all of you were born were\nselected after years of controlled breeding. Your parents were the\nfinest the human race could produce--intelligent, strong, healthy, high\nsurvival quotient. Is this what you mean by deep?\"\n\n\"Partly, but also--_feeling_. I think I feel things better.\"\n\nThe other children waddled in, took their seats and switched on\nrobomonitors in the ritual of classroom procedure. They all looked at\nMecteacher in the central panel.\n\nMecteacher motioned Adam to his chair-desk and began the lesson. He\ndescribed Old Earth and how it circled Old Sol with the other worlds\nand the way the moons circled the planets--all of them condensed into\nspheres and all the spheres turning in harmony.\n\nHe interrupted himself when Mary's robomonitor registered only partial\ncomprehension. \"What don't you understand, Mary? Is it _sphere_?\"\n\n\"I know what a sphere is,\" she said, remembering a previous lesson. \"A\nsphere is an apple or an orange--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMecteacher detected a covert wince from Adam's monitor. The teacher\nappeared to Adam on his desk panel where the others couldn't see or\nhear. \"Do not think this is because she is not--deep, Adam. She is only\nseven and not as advanced for her age as you are. You understand how we\nmecs are pre-set?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"In the classroom, then, if we don't go fast enough for you, try to\nbe patient. We can only deviate within set limits. It is not a new\nproblem, Adam. On Earth, it impeded the educational system from the\nbeginning.\"\n\nSimultaneously with his conversation with Adam, Mecteacher held up\nan apple on the central panel and re-explained the age-old analogy\nbetween the apple and the Earth, the red skin and the Terran crust, and\nfurther, the supposition that New Earth ahead would be like Old Earth\nand the apple.\n\nEve wanted to know whether New Earth would have a New Moon.\n\n\"That's an interesting question, Eve. But we are still too many\nmillions of miles away to know yet. Before you are ready to leave the\nship, you will know.\"\n\nIn the months that passed, Adam tried associating more with the other\nchildren. He played their games, which seemed to him to be played\nwithout a purpose, but they wouldn't or couldn't play his--with one\nexception.\n\nHe showed them how to turn off the artificial gravity in the recroom\nand they became obsessed with the same physical euphoria he had\ndiscovered for himself. But even while in free-fall, Adam maintained\nhis need for reason and couldn't indulge their pointless pastimes for\nlong. Often, when he grew tired of free-falling, he visited his lonely\nchamber under the deck and explored the working parts of the ship.\n\nOn almost each occasion when he returned, he was caught by one of the\nmecs and punished with fiercely glowing red panels. Remembering a\nprevious conversation with the mecs, Adam reasoned that their present\ndissatisfaction with him was not real. After all, he recalled, they\nwere pre-set. They _had_ to act like that when he disobeyed them. Going\nagainst them wasn't necessarily the same as doing wrong.\n\nIt took an act of will and intelligence far in advance of his\nseven years, for Adam realized that if he continued like this, the\nconditioning would eat at his brain like acid and guilt would rise\nin the etch. So, from under the ship's deck, he turned the mecs\npermanently off.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe stars changed with the passing years. The blue giant Adam used to\nwatch from the darkside port was now a diamond chip lost in starmilk\nnight. Ahead, a new jewel grew larger in the quartz port, a sapphire\nblazing hot and big--bigger than any star in his memory, closer than\nthe _Destiny_ had ever come to a star.\n\nAdam understood why the star was so big. He was eighteen Old Earth\nyears of age now and the star was New Sol. Soon there would be a New\nEarth and maybe a New Moon. His destiny was near, his job decided. He\nwould locate the planet, orbit it, search for a clear space and land.\nThen he and the others--\n\nThe others. The repulsive, flighty, inconsistent trio. They were\nalike, all right, with never a serious thought in their heads. Why\nweren't they concerned with their destiny as he was? If he were a\ngenius as the mecs once told him, why weren't the others also geniuses?\nThey all came from the best stock of Old Earth. No, it wasn't just that\nhe was supernormal; the others were--flat, undeep.\n\nFor years, he had kept peace by yielding to their demands. He suffered\ntheir company, succumbed to their activities. But every so often, when\nhe felt especially disgusted, he retreated to his private sanctum under\nthe deck. This was such a time now, he felt, as Eve and Mary giggled\nover to him.\n\nThey were not nude as had been the custom aboard the ship ever since he\nturned off the mecs. They had clothes draped over parts of them that\nseemed somehow to make them more than nude. But they wore red coloring\non their lips that he thought was repulsive.\n\nHe ducked behind the couch, clicked open the familiar combination and\ndescended into the only peace he ever knew. He sat at a chair-table he\nhad lowered into the compartment long ago, and peered pensively at the\ndrawings before him. If Mecteacher were here, he thought, the orbit\nwouldn't be so difficult to calculate. He'd explain how to do it.\n\nAnd then, he wondered, would Mecteacher have taught the others how\nto be deep? Or was depth something inside, something that could not\nbe altered by education? If this were a world with other people, he\nthought, would my cousins be considered abnormals--or would I?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe pondered the question for a moment, then decided, as he had so often\nin the past, that it was truly the cousins who were the flat ones. They\nwere deviants from an average that couldn't exist on the _Destiny_,\nbut which must have once existed elsewhere. They had been flat at\nseven--perhaps when children are supposed to be flat, as Mecmother had\nsuggested--but they stayed that way. At eighteen, as at seven, they\nstill played the same games with scarcely any variation.\n\nHe heard them rummaging above, attempting again and again to pull open\nthe hatch. It had happened this way for years: They'd try to open the\ntrapdoor for an hour or two, then give it up and turn their attention\nto something else. They never thought to turn the handle. Maybe an\nundeep person wouldn't be able to reason the combination clicks, but\nonly a completely flat one would persist in pulling when it always\nended in failure.\n\nPossibly, he thought, the cosmic rays had been more destructive to\ntheir egg cells. Or maybe the alien radiations subtracted something\nfrom the other cells to add to his. If this were true, he was partly a\nproduct of the others and owed his depth to them.\n\nAdam felt sorry for his cousins then and wished he hadn't hurt them\nby avoiding their presence. Despite their undepth, they must have\nfeelings. The mecs probably wouldn't have been able to give them depth\nbut, he remembered, the other role of the mecs was to prevent each one\nof them from harming the others. In their role as arbitrator, Adam\nrealized, they might have stopped him from hurting them so.\n\nFilled with remorse, he left his desk-chair and walked stoop-shouldered\nunder the low ceiling. At the trapdoor, he opened the combination on\nthe inside lock handle and pushed upward. It wouldn't open. He tried\nagain, but it wasn't the lock that was stuck. They must have slid\nsomething heavy over the hatch, something he couldn't move.\n\nHe tried calling to them, but his voice was lost in the insulative\nmetal of the deck. Finally he sat down, conserving his strength for a\nfinal onslaught.\n\nIf he couldn't open the hatch, he realized vividly it would be not\nonly his failure, but the failure of the human race.\n\nBut maybe it did not have to be so. Maybe the differences in the others\nweren't biological--maybe they were environmental. And with that\nthought, he made his way through the narrow passageway and reversed his\ndeed of eleven years past. He turned the mecs back on.\n\nReturning to the hatch, he reworked the combination to make sure it was\nnot the lock that held him. He pushed upward with all his strength,\nsteadily with increasing pressure, until the beads of perspiration\nturned into gulleys that streamed down his face.\n\nExhausted, he crawled back to his chair and lay across the desk\nlittered with calculations of a landing he would never make. The soft\nluminescence from the _Destiny's_ nuclear engines crept forward and\ncaressed him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the aft recroom, Eve and Mary were admiring Joseph's strength in\nbeing able to push the heavy couch over Adam's trapdoor.\n\nThree wall panels lit red. All the mecs appeared together. \"It's time\nfor your science lesson,\" one said. \"But where is Adam?\"\n\n\"He's in the trapdoor,\" they answered flatly.\n\nThe panel turned green, reserving its redness for the delinquent Adam\nwhen he would choose to appear.\n\nMecteacher began, \"Now about the Solar System....\"\n\nBut the cousins didn't listen. Joseph had turned the gravity switch off\nand they were too busy floating upended, trying new positions, laughing\nat each other's ridiculous postures in the ship without bottom. The\ngame was not a new one, but it was newly discovered and they reveled in\nits glories.\n\nMonth after month, they played their weightless games while the\nmecs implored them to come down. The constellations shifted in the\nvisiports. New Sol grew larger and then smaller as the _Destiny_ sped\ntoward its unseen planet.\n\nIn the recroom, the mecvoices were only noises to the trio now,\nannoying noises that could be silenced, they discovered, with forceful\nkicks to the red-glowing panels.\n\nWhen all the mecscreens had been smashed and the weightless games grew\nboring, Mary looked out the sunroom port. She was surprised to see a\nrust-yellow sphere hanging in the sky. She watched it seriously for a\ntime, frowning as it grew bigger and filled a third of her horizon.\nThen she called Eve and Joseph.\n\nMary pointed and they all stared in bewilderment. She opened her eyes\nwide and laughed with glee. \"It's an apple,\" she said. \"An apple in the\nsky!\"\n\nBut Joseph wasn't fooled. Dimly he remembered something Adam had told\nhim--something about a thing that would appear in the sky. He fought\nhard bringing it to conscious memory. Then he started aft toward the\nrecroom. In there, under the couch, he remembered, was Adam. Adam would\nremind him what it was.\n\nSuddenly Joseph smiled, his face flushed. He turned back to the sunroom\nport. He wouldn't have to ask Adam, after all. For a moment, he watched\nto make sure, while the huge yellow sphere swam closer.\n\n\"No, Mary,\" he said triumphantly. \"It's not an apple in the sky. Apples\nare red. It's an orange!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Deep One, by Neil P.

In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations.

The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Newby\n    Chief Executive and Director\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
