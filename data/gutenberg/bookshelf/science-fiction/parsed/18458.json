And,\nalthough it was still but midafternoon, Dalgard pointed the outrigger\ninto the promised shelter, the dip of his steering paddle swinging in\nharmony with that wielded by Sssuri in the bow of their narrow,\nwave-riding craft.\n\nThe two voyagers were neither of the same race nor of the same\nspecies, yet they worked together without words, as if they had\nestablished some bond which gave them a rapport transcending the need\nfor speech.\n\nDalgard Nordis was a son of the Colony; his kind had not originated on\nthis planet. He was not as tall nor as heavily built as those Terran\noutlaw ancestors who had fled political enemies across the Galaxy to\nestablish a foothold on Astra, and there were other subtle differences\nbetween his generation and the parent stock.\n\nThin and wiry, his skin was brown from the gentle toasting of the\nsummer sun, making the fairness of his closely cropped hair even more\nnoticeable. At his side was his long bow, carefully wrapped in\nwater-resistant flying-dragon skin, and from the belt which supported\nhis short breeches of tanned duocorn hide swung a two-foot blade--half\nwood-knife, half sword. To the eyes of his Terran forefathers he would\nhave presented a barbaric picture. In his own mind he was amply clad\nand armed for the man-journey which was both his duty and his\nheritage to make before he took his place as a full adult in the\nCouncil of Free Men.\n\nIn contrast to Dalgard's smooth skin, Sssuri was covered with a fluffy\npelt of rainbow-tipped gray fur. In place of the human's steel blade,\nhe wore one of bone, barbed and ugly, as menacing as the spear now\nresting in the bottom of the outrigger. And his round eyes watched the\nsea with the familiarity of one whose natural home was beneath those\nsame waters.\n\nThe mouth of the cove was narrow, but after they negotiated it they\nfound themselves in a pocket of bay, sheltered and calm, into which\ntrickled a lazy stream. The gray-blue of the seashore sand was only a\nfringe beyond which was turf and green stuff. Sssuri's nostril flaps\nexpanded as he tested the warm breeze, and Dalgard was busy\ncataloguing scents as they dragged their craft ashore. They could not\nhave found a more perfect place for a camp site.\n\nOnce the canoe was safely beached, Sssuri picked up his spear and,\nwithout a word or backward glance, waded out into the sea,\ndisappearing into the depths, while his companion set about his share\nof camp tasks. It was still early in the summer--too early to expect\nto find ripe fruit. But Dalgard rummaged in his voyager's bag and\nbrought out a half-dozen crystal beads. He laid these out on a\nflat-topped stone by the stream, seating himself cross-legged beside\nit.\n\nTo the onlooker it would appear that the traveler was meditating. A\nwide-winged living splotch of color fanned by overhead; there was a\ndistant yap of sound. Dalgard neither looked nor listened. But perhaps\na minute later what he awaited arrived. A hopper, its red-brown fur\nsleek and gleaming in the sun, its eternal curiosity drawing it,\npeered cautiously from the bushes. Dalgard made mind touch. The\nhoppers did not really think--at least not on the levels where\ncommunication was possible for the colonists--but sensations of\nfriendship and good will could be broadcast, primitive ideas\nexchanged.\n\nThe small animal, its humanlike front pawhands dangling over its\ncreamy vest, came out fully into the open, black eyes flicking from\nthe motionless Dalgard to the bright beads on the rock. But when one\nof those paws shot out to snatch the treasure, the traveler's hand was\nalready cupped protectingly over the hoard. Dalgard formed a mental\npicture and beamed it at the twenty-inch creature before him. The\nhopper's ears twitched nervously, its blunt nose wrinkled, and then it\nbounded back into the brush, a weaving line of moving grass marking\nits retreat.\n\nDalgard withdrew his hand from the beads. Through the years the Astran\ncolonists had come to recognize the virtues of patience. Perhaps the\nmutation had begun before they left their native world. Or perhaps the\nchange in temperament and nature had occurred in the minds and bodies\nof that determined handful of refugees as they rested in the frozen\ncold sleep while their ship bore them through the wide, uncharted\nreaches of deep space for centuries of Terran time. How long that\nsleep had lasted the survivors had never known. But those who had\nawakened on Astra were different.\n\nAnd their sons and daughters, and the sons and daughters of two more\ngenerations were warmed by a new sun, nourished by food grown in alien\nsoil, taught the mind contact by the amphibian mermen with whom the\nspace voyagers had made an early friendship--each succeeding child\nmore attuned to the new home, less tied to the far-off world he had\nnever seen or would see. The colonists were not of the same breed as\ntheir fathers, their grandfathers, or great-grandfathers. So, with\nother gifts, they had also a vast, time-consuming patience, which\ncould be a weapon or a tool, as they pleased--not forgetting the\ninstantaneous call to action which was their older heritage.\n\nThe hopper returned. On the rock beside the shining things it\ncoveted, it dropped dried and shriveled fruit. Dalgard's fingers\nseparated two of the gleaming marbles, rolled them toward the animal,\nwho scooped them up with a chirp of delight. But it did not leave.\nInstead it peered intently at the rest of the beads. Hoppers had their\nown form of intelligence, though it might not compare with that of\nhumans. And this one was enterprising. In the end it delivered three\nmore loads of fruit from its burrow and took away all the beads, both\nparties well pleased with their bargains.\n\nSssuri splashed out of the sea with as little ado as he had entered.\nOn the end of his spear twisted a fish. His fur, slicked flat to his\nstrongly muscled body, began to dry in the air and fluff out while the\nsun awoke prismatic lights on the scales which covered his hands and\nfeet. He dispatched the fish and cleaned it neatly, tossing the offal\nback into the water, where some shadowy things arose to tear at the\nunusual bounty.\n\n\"This is not hunting ground.\" His message formed in Dalgard's mind.\n\"That finned one had no fear of me.\"\n\n\"We were right then in heading north; this is new land.\" Dalgard got\nto his feet.\n\nOn either side, the cliffs, with their alternate bands of red, blue,\nyellow, and white strata, walled in this pocket. They would make far\nbetter time keeping to the sea lanes, where it was not necessary to\nclimb. And it was Dalgard's cherished plan to add more than just an\ninch or two to the explorers' map in the Council Hall.\n\nEach of the colony males was expected to make his man-journey of\ndiscovery sometimes between his eighteenth and twentieth year. He went\nalone or, if he formed an attachment with one of the mermen near his\nown age, accompanied only by his knife brother. And from knowledge so\ngained the still-small group of exiles added to and expanded their\ninformation about their new home.\n\nCaution was drilled into them. For they were not the first masters of\nAstra, nor were they the masters now. There were the ruins left by\nThose Others, the race who had populated this planet until their own\nwars had completed their downfall. And the mermen, with their\ntraditions of slavery and dark beginnings in the experimental pens of\nthe older race, continued to insist that across the sea--on the\nunknown western continent--Those Others still held onto the remnants\nof a degenerate civilization. Thus the explorers from Homeport went\nout by ones and twos and used the fauna of the land as a means of\ngathering information.\n\nHoppers could remember yesterday only dimly, and instinct took care of\ntomorrow. But what happened today sped from hopper to hopper and could\nwarn by mind touch both merman and human. If one of the dread\nsnake-devils of the interior was on the hunting trail, the hoppers\nsped the warning. Their vast curiosity brought them to the fringe of\nany disturbance, and they passed the reason for it along. Dalgard knew\nthere were a thousand eyes at his service whenever he wanted them.\nThere was little chance of being taken by surprise, no matter how\ndangerous this journey north might be.\n\n\"The city--\" He formed the words in his mind even as he spoke them\naloud. \"How far are we from it?\"\n\nThe merman hunched his slim shoulders in the shrug of his race. \"Three\ndays' travel, maybe five. And it\"--though his furred face displayed no\nreadable emotion, the sensation of distaste was plain--\"was one of the\naccursed ones. To such we have not returned since the days of falling\nfire--\"\n\nDalgard was well acquainted with the ruins which lay not many miles\nfrom Homeport. And he knew that that sprawling, devastated metropolis\nwas not taboo to the merman. But this other mysterious settlement he\nhad recently heard of was still shunned by the sea people. Only\nSssuri and a few others of youthful years would consider a journey to\nexplore the long-forbidden section their traditions labeled as\ndangerous land.\n\nThe belief that he was about to venture into questionable territory\nhad made Dalgard evasive when he reported his plans to the Elders\nthree days earlier. But since such trips were, by tradition, always\nthrusts into the unknown, they had not questioned him too much. All in\nall, Dalgard thought, watching Sssuri flake the firm pink flesh from\nthe fish, he might deem himself lucky and this quest ordained. He went\noff to hack out armloads of grass and fashion the sleep mats for the\nsun-warmed ground.\n\nThey had eaten and were lounging in content on the soft sand just\nbeyond the curl of the waves when Sssuri lifted his head from his\nfolded arms as if he listened. Like all those of his species, his\nvestigial ears were hidden deep in his fur and no longer served any\nreal purpose; the mind touch served him in their stead. Dalgard caught\nhis thought, though what had aroused his companion was too rare a\nthread to trouble his less acute senses.\n\n\"Runners in the dark--\"\n\nDalgard frowned. \"It is still sun time. What disturbs them?\"\n\nTo the eye Sssuri was still listening to that which his friend could\nnot hear.\n\n\"They come from afar. They are on the move to find new hunting\ngrounds.\"\n\nDalgard sat up. To each and every scout from Homeport the unusual was\na warning, a signal to alert mind and body. The runners in the\nnight--that furred monkey race of hunters who combed the moonless dark\nof Astra when most of the higher fauna were asleep--were very\ndistantly related to Sssuri's species, though the gap between them was\nthat between highly civilized man and the jungle ape. The runners were\nharmless and shy, but they were noted also for clinging stubbornly to\none particular district generation after generation. To find such a\nclan on the move into new territory was to be fronted with a puzzle it\nmight be well to investigate.\n\n\"A snake-devil--\" he suggested tentatively, forming a mind picture of\nthe vicious reptilian danger which the colonists tried to kill on\nsight whenever and wherever encountered. His hand went to the knife at\nhis belt. One met with weapons only that hissing hatred motivated by a\nbrainless ferocity which did not know fear.\n\nBut Sssuri did not accept that explanation. He was sitting up, facing\ninland where the thread of valley met the cliff wall. And seeing his\nabsorption, Dalgard asked no distracting questions.\n\n\"No, no snake-devil--\" after long moments came the answer. He got to\nhis feet, shuffling through the sand in the curious little half dance\nwhich betrayed his agitation more strongly than his thoughts had done.\n\n\"The hoppers have no news,\" Dalgard said.\n\nSssuri gestured impatiently with one outflung hand. \"Do the hoppers\nwander far from their own nest mounds? Somewhere there--\" he pointed\nto the left and north, \"there is trouble, bad trouble. Tonight we\nshall speak with the runners and discover what it may be.\"\n\nDalgard glanced about the camp with regret. But he made no protest as\nhe reached for his bow and stripped off its protective casing. With\nthe quiver of heavy-duty arrows slung across his shoulder he was ready\nto go, following Sssuri inland.\n\nThe easy valley path ended less than a quarter of a mile from the sea,\nand they were fronted by a wall of rock with no other option than to\nclimb. But the westering sun made plain every possible hand and foot\nhold on its surface.\n\nWhen they stood at last on the heights and looked ahead, it was across\na broken stretch of bare rock with the green of vegetation beckoning\nfrom at least a mile beyond. Sssuri hesitated for only a moment or\ntwo, his round, almost featureless head turning slowly, until he\nfixed on a northeasterly course--striking out unerringly as if he\ncould already sight the goal. Dalgard fell in behind, looking over the\ncountry with a wary eye. This was just the type of land to harbor\nflying dragons. And while those pests were small, their\nlightning-swift attack from above made them foes not to be\ndisregarded. But all the flying things he saw were two moth birds of\ndelicate hues engaging far over the sun-baked rock in one of their\ngraceful winged dances.\n\nThey crossed the heights and came to the inland slope, a drop toward\nthe central interior plains of the continent. As they plowed through\nthe high grasses Dalgard knew they were under observation. Hoppers\nwatched them. And once through a break in a line of trees he saw a\nsmall herd of duocorns race into the shelter of a wood. The presence\nof those two-horned creatures, so like the pictures he had seen of\nTerran horses, was insurance that the snake-devils did not hunt in\nthis district, for the swift-footed duocorns were never found within a\nday's journey of their archenemies.\n\nLate afternoon faded into the long summer twilight and still Sssuri\nkept on. As yet they had come across no traces of Those Others. Here\nwere none of the domed farm buildings, the monorail tracks, the other\nrelics one could find about Homeport. This wide-open land could have\nbeen always a wilderness, left to the animals of Astra for their own.\nDalgard speculated upon that, his busy imagination supplying various\nreasons for such tract. Then the voiceless communication of his\ncompanion provided an explanation.\n\n\"This was barrier land.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nSssuri turned his head. His round eyes which blinked so seldom stared\ninto Dalgard's as if by the intensity of that gaze he could drive home\ndeeper his point.\n\n\"What lies to the north was protected in the days before the falling\nfire. Even _Those_\"--the distorted mermen symbol for Those Others was\nsharpened by the very hatred of all Sssuri's kind, which had not paled\nduring the generations since their escape from slavery to Astra's\none-time masters--\"could not venture into some of their own private\nplaces without special leave. It is perhaps true that the city we are\nseeking is one of those restricted ones and that this wilderness is a\nboundary for it.\"\n\nDalgard's pace slowed. To venture into a section of land which had\nbeen used as a barrier to protect some secret of Those Others was a\nhighly risky affair. The first expedition sent out from Homeport after\nthe landing of the Terran refugee ship had been shot down by\nrobot-controlled guns still set against some long-dead invader. Would\nthis territory be so guarded? If so they had better go carefully now--\n\nSssuri suddenly struck off at an angle, heading not northeast now, but\ndirectly north. The brush lands along the foot of the cliffs gave way\nto open fields, bare except for the grass rippled by the wind. It was\nnot the type of country to attract the night runners, and Dalgard\nwondered a little. They should discover water, preferably a shallow\nstream, if they wanted to find what the monkey creatures liked best.\n\nWithin a quarter-hour he knew that Sssuri was not going wrong. Cradled\nin a sudden dip in the land was the stream Dalgard had been looking\nfor. A hopper lifted a dripping muzzle from the shore ripples and\nstared at them. Dalgard contacted the animal. It was its usual curious\nself, nothing had alarmed or excited its interest. And he did not try\nto establish more than a casual contact as they made their way down\nthe bank to the edge of the stream, Sssuri splashing in ankle-deep for\nthe sheer pleasure of feeling liquid curl about his feet and legs once\nmore.\n\nWater dwellers fled from their passing and insects buzzed and hovered.\nOtherwise they moved through a deserted world. The stream bed widened\nand small islands of gravel, swept together in untidy piles by the\nspring floods, arose dry topped, some already showing the green of\nventuresome plants.\n\n\"Here--\" Sssuri stopped, thrusting the butt of his spear into the\nshore of one such islet. He dropped cross-legged on his choice, there\nto remain patiently until those he sought would come with the dark.\nDalgard withdrew a little way downstream and took up a similar post.\nThe runners were shy, not easy to approach. And they would come more\nreadily if Sssuri were alone.\n\nHere the murmur of the stream was loud, rising above the rustle of the\nwind-driven grass. And the night was coming fast as the sun, hidden by\nthe cliff wall, sank into the sea. Dalgard, knowing that his night\nsight was far inferior to that of the native Astran fauna, resignedly\nsettled himself for an all-night stay, not without a second regretful\nmemory of the snug camp by the shore.\n\nTwilight and then night. How long before the runners would make their\nappearance? He could pick up the sparks of thought which marked the\ncoming and going of hoppers, most hurrying off to their mud-plastered\nnests, and sometimes a flicker from the mind of some other night\ncreature. Once he was sure he touched the avid, raging hunger which\nmarked a flying dragon, though they were not naturally hunters by\ndarkness.\n\nDalgard made no move to contact Sssuri. The merman must be left\nundisturbed in his mental quest for the runners.\n\nThe scout lay back on his miniature island and stared up into the sky,\ntrying to sort out all the myriad impressions of life about him. It\nwas then that he saw it....\n\nAn arrow of fire streaking across the black bowl of Astra's night sky.\nA light so vivid, so alien, that it brought him to his feet with a\nchill prickle of apprehension along his spine. In all his years as a\nscout and woodsman, in all the stories of his fellows and his elders\nat Homeport--he had never seen, never heard of the like of that!\n\nAnd through his own wonder and alert alarm, he caught Sssuri's added\npuzzlement.\n\n\"Danger--\" The merman's verdict fed his own unease.\n\nDanger had crossed the night, from east to west. And to the west lay\nwhat they had always feared. What was going to happen now?\n\n\n\n\n2\n\nPLANETFALL\n\n\nRaf Kurbi, flitter pilot and techneer, lay on the padded shock cushion\nof his assigned bunk and stared with wide, disillusioned eyes at the\nstretch of stark, gray metal directly overhead. He tried to close his\nears to the mutter of meaningless words coming from across the narrow\ncabin. Raf had known from the moment his name had been drawn as crew\nmember that the whole trip would be a gamble, a wild gamble with the\nodds all against them. _RS 10_--those very numbers on the nose of the\nship told part of the story. Ten exploring fingers thrust in turn out\ninto the blackness of space. _RS 3_'s fate was known--she had\nblossomed into a pinpoint of flame within the orbit of Mars. And _RS\n7_ had clearly gone out of control while instruments on Terra could\nstill pick up her broadcasts. Of the rest--well, none had returned.\n\nBut the ships were built, manned by lot from the trainees, and sent\nout, one every five years, with all that had been learned from the\nprevious job, each refinement the engineers could discover\nincorporated into the latest to rise from the launching cradle.\n\n_RS 10_--Raf closed his eyes with weary distaste. After months of\nbeing trapped inside her ever-vibrating shell, he felt that he knew\neach and every rivet, seam, and plate in her only too well. And there\nwas no reason yet to believe that the voyage would ever end. They\nwould just go on and on through empty space until dead men manned a\ndrifting hulk--\n\nThere--to picture that was a danger signal. Whenever his thoughts\nreached that particular point, Raf tried to think of something else,\nto break the chain of dismal foreboding. How? By joining in Wonstead's\nmonologue of complaint and regret? Raf had heard the same words over\nand over so often that they no longer had any meaning--except as a\nseries of sounds he might miss if the man who shared this pocket were\nsuddenly stricken dumb.\n\n\"Should never have put in for training--\" Wonstead's whine went up the\nscale.\n\nThat was unoriginal enough. They had all had that idea the minute\nafter the sorter had plucked their names for crew inclusion. No matter\nwhat motive had led them into the stiff course of training--the\nfabulous pay, a real interest in the project, the exploring fever--Raf\ndid not believe that there was a single man whose heart had not sunk\nwhen he had been selected for flight. Even he, who had dreamed all his\nlife of the stars and the wonders which might lie just beyond the big\njump, had been honestly sick on the day he had shouldered his bag\naboard and had first taken his place on this mat and waited, dry\nmouthed and shivering, for blast-off.\n\nOne lost all sense of time out here. They ate sparingly, slept when\nthey could, tried to while away the endless hours artificially divided\ninto set periods. But still weeks might be months, or months weeks.\nThey could have been years in space--or only days. All they knew was\nthe unending monotony which dragged upon a man until he either lapsed\ninto a dreamy rejection of his surroundings, as had Hamp and Floy, or\nflew into murderous rages, such as kept Morris in solitary confinement\nat present. And no foreseeable end to the flight--\n\nRaf breathed shallowly. The air was stale, he could almost taste it.\nIt was difficult now to remember being in the open air under a sky,\nwith fresh winds blowing about one. He tried to picture on that dull\nstrip of metal overhead a stretch of green grass, a tree, even the\nblue sky and floating white clouds. But the patch remained stubbornly\ngray, the murmur of Wonstead went on and on, a drone in his aching\nears, the throb of the ship's life beat through his own thin body.\n\nWhat had it been like on those legendary early flights, when the\nsecret of the overdrive had not yet been discovered, when any who\ndared the path between star and star had surrendered to sleep, perhaps\nto wake again generations later, perhaps never to rouse again? He had\nseen the few documents discovered four or five hundred years ago in\nthe raided headquarters of the scientific outlaws who had fled the\nregimented world government of Pax and dared space on the single hope\nof surviving such a journey in cold sleep, the secret of which had\nbeen lost. At least, Raf thought, they had escaped the actual\ndiscomfort of the voyage.\n\nHad they found their new world or worlds? The end of their ventures\nhad been debated thousands of times since those documents had been\nmade public, after the downfall of Pax and the coming into power of\nthe Federation of Free Men.\n\nIn fact it was the publication of the papers which had given the\nadditional spur to the building of the _RS_ armada. What man had dared\nonce he could dare anew. And the pursuit of knowledge which had been\nso long forbidden under Pax was heady excitement for the world.\nResearch and discovery became feverish avenues of endeavor. Even the\nslim hope of a successful star voyage and the return to Terra with\nsuch rich spoils of information was enough to harness three quarters\nof the planet's energy for close to a hundred years. And if the _RS\n10_ was not successful, there would be _11_, _12_, more--flaming into\nthe sky and out into the void, unless some newer and more intriguing\nexperiment developed to center public imagination in another\ndirection.\n\nRaf's eyes closed wearily. Soon the gong would sound and this period\nof rest would be officially ended. But it was hardly worth rising. He\nwas not in the least hungry for the concentrated food. He could repeat\nthe information tapes they carried dull word for dull word.\n\n\"Nothing to see--nothing but these blasted walls!\" Again Wonstead's\nvoice arose in querulous protest.\n\nYes, while in overdrive there was nothing to see. The ports of the\nship would be sealed until they were in normal space once more. That\nis, if it worked and they were not caught up forever within this thick\ntrap where there was no time, light, or distance.\n\nThe gong sounded, but Raf made no move to rise. He heard Wonstead\nmove, saw from the corner of his eye the other's bulk heave up\nobediently from the pad.\n\n\"Hey--mess gong!\" He pointed out the obvious to Raf.\n\nWith a sigh the other levered himself up on his elbows. If he did not\nmove, Wonstead was capable of reporting him to the captain for strange\nbehavior, and they were all too alert to a divagation which might mean\ntrouble. He had no desire to end in confinement with Morris.\n\n\"I'm coming,\" Raf said sullenly. But he remained sitting on the edge\nof the pad until Wonstead left the cabin, and he followed as slowly as\nhe could.\n\nSo he was not with the others when a new sound tore through the\nconstant vibrating hum which filled the narrow corridors of the ship.\nRaf stiffened, the icy touch of fear tensing his muscles. Was that the\nred alarm of disaster?\n\nHis eyes went to the light at the end of the short passage. But no\nblink of warning red shown there. Not danger--then what--?\n\nIt took him a full moment to realize what he had heard, not the signal\nof doom, but the sound which was to herald the accomplishment of their\nmission--the sound which unconsciously they had all given up any hope\nof ever hearing. They had made it!\n\nThe pilot leaned weakly against the wall, and his eyes smarted, his\nhands were trembling. In that moment he knew that he had never really,\nhonestly, believed that they would succeed. But they had! _RS 10_ had\nreached the stars!\n\n\"Strap down for turnout--strap down for turnout--!\" The disembodied\nvoice screaming through the ship's speecher was that of Captain\nHobart, but it was almost unrecognizable with emotion. Raf turned and\nstumbled back to his cabin, staggered to throw himself once more on\nhis pad as he fumbled with the straps he must buckle over him.\n\nHe heard rather than saw Wonstead blunder in to follow his example,\nand for the first time in months the other was dumb, not uttering a\nword as he stowed away for the breakthrough which should take them\nback into normal space and the star worlds. Raf tore a nail on a\nfastening, muttered.\n\n\"Condition red--condition red--Strap down for breakthrough--\" Hobart\nchanted at them from the walls. \"One, two, three\"--the count swung on\nnumeral by numeral; then--\"ten--Stand by--\"\n\nRaf had forgotten what breakthrough was like. He had gone through it\nthe first time when still under take-off sedation. But this was worse\nthan he remembered, so much worse. He tried to scream out his protest\nagainst the torture which twisted mind and body, but he could not\nutter even a weak cry. This, this was unbearable--a man could go mad\nor die--die--die....\n\nHe aroused with the flat sweetness of blood on his tongue, a splitting\npain behind the eyes he tried to focus on the too familiar scrap of\nwall. A voice boomed, receded, and boomed again, filling the air and\nat last making sense, in it a ring of wild triumph!\n\n\"Made it! This is it, men, we've made it; Sol-class sun--three\nplanets. We'll set an orbit in--\"\n\nRaf licked his lips. It was still too much to swallow in one mental\ngulp. So, they had made it--half of their venture was accomplished.\nThey had broken out of their own solar system, made the big jump, and\nbefore them lay the unknown. Now it was within their reach.\n\n\"D'you hear that, kid?\" demanded Wonstead, his voice no longer an\naccusing whine, more steady than Raf ever remembered hearing it. \"We\ngot through! We'll hit dirt again! Dirt--\" his words trailed away as\nif he were sinking into some blissful daydream.\n\nThere was a different feeling to the ship herself. The steady drone\nwhich had ached in their ears, their bones, as she bored her way\nthrough the alien hyper-space had changed to a purr as if she, too,\nwere rejoicing at the success of their desperate try. For the first\ntime in weary weeks Raf remembered his own duties which would begin\nwhen the _RS 10_ came in to a flame-cushioned landing on a new world.\nHe was to assemble and ready the small exploration flyer, to man its\ncontrols and take it up and out. Frowning, he began to run over in his\nmind each step in the preparations he must make as soon as they\nplaneted.\n\nInformation came down from control, where now the ports were open on\nnormal space and the engines were under control of the spacer's pilot.\nTheir goal was to be the third planet, one which showed signs of\natmosphere, of water and earth ready and waiting.\n\nThose who were not on flight duty crowded into the tiny central cabin,\nwhere they elbowed each other before the viewer. The ball of alien\nearth grew from a pinpoint to the size of an orange. They forgot time\nin the wonder which none had ever thought in his heart he would see on\nthe screen. Raf knew that in control every second of this was being\nrecorded as they began to establish a braking orbit, which with luck\nwould bring them down on the surface of the new world.\n\n\"Cities--those must be cities!\" Those in the cabin studied the plate\nwith awe as the information filtered through the crew. Lablet, their\nxenobiologist, sat with his fingers rigid on the lower bar of the visa\nplate, so intent that nothing could break his vigil, while the rest\nspeculated wildly. Had they really seen cities?\n\nRaf went down the corridor to the door of the sealed compartment that\nheld the machine and the supplies for which he was responsible. These\nlast hours of waiting were worse with their nagging suspense than all\nthe time which had gone before. If they could only set down!\n\nHe had, on training trips which now seemed very far in the past, trod\nthe rust-red desert country of Mars, waddled in a bulky protective\nsuit across the peaked ranges of the dead Moon, known something of the\nlarger asteroids. But how would it feel to tread ground warmed by the\nrays of another sun? Imagination with which his superiors did not\ncredit him began to stir. Traits inherited from a mixture of races\nwere there to be summoned. Raf retreated once more into his cabin and\nsat on his bunk pad, staring down at his own capable mechanic's hands\nwithout seeing them, picturing instead all the wonders which might lie\njust beyond the next few hours' imprisonment in this metallic shell he\nhad grown to hate with a dull but abiding hatred.\n\nAlthough he knew that Hobart must be fully as eager as any of them to\nland, it seemed to Raf, and the other impatient crew members, that\nthey were very long in entering the atmosphere of the chosen world. It\nwas only when the order came to strap down for deceleration that they\nwere in a measure satisfied. Pull of gravity, ship beaming in at an\nangle which swept it from night to day or night again as it encircled\nthat unknown globe. They could not watch their objective any longer.\nThe future depended entirely upon the skill of the three men in\ncontrol--and last of all upon Hobart's judgment and skill.\n\nThe captain brought them down, riding the flaming counter-blasts from\nthe ship's tail to set her on her fins in an expert point landing, so\nthat the _RS 10_ was a finger of light into the sky, amid wisps of\nsmoke from brush ignited by her landing.\n\nThere was another wait which seemed endless to the restless men\nwithin, a wait until the air was analyzed, the countryside surveyed.\nBut when the go-ahead signal was given and the ramp swung out, those\nfirst at the hatch still hesitated for an instant or so, though the\nway before them was open.\n\nBeyond the burnt ground about the ship was a rolling plain covered\nwith tall grass which rippled under the wind. And the freshness of\nthat wind cleansed their lungs of the taint of the ship.\n\nRaf pulled off his helmet, held his head high in that breeze. It was\nlike bathing in air, washing away the smog of those long days of\nimprisonment. He ran down the ramp, past the little group of those who\nhad preceded him, and fell on his knees in the grass, catching at it\nwith his hands, a little over-awed at the wonder of it all.\n\nThe wide sweep of sky above them was not entirely blue, he noted.\nThere was the faintest suggestion of green, and across it moved clouds\nof silver. But, save for the grass, they might be in a dead and empty\nworld. Where were the cities? Or had those been born of imagination?\n\nAfter a while, when the wonder of this landing had somewhat worn away,\nHobart summoned them back to the prosaic business of setting up base.\nAnd Raf went to work at his own task. The sealed storeroom was opened,\nthe supplies slung by crane down from the ship. The compact assembly,\nstreamlined for this purpose, was all ready for the morrow.\n\nThey spent the night within the ship, much against their will. After\nthe taste of freedom they had been given, the cramped interior weighed\nupon them, closing like a prison. Raf lay on his pad unable to sleep.\nIt seemed to him that he could hear, even through the heavy plates,\nthe sigh of that refreshing wind, the call of the open world lying\nready for them. Step by step in his mind, he went through the process\nfor which he would be responsible the next day. The uncrating of the\nsmall flyer, the assembling of frame and motor. And sometime in the\nmidst of that survey he did fall asleep, so deeply that Wonstead had\nto shake him awake in the morning.\n\nHe bolted his food and was out at his job before it was far past dawn.\nBut eager as he was to get to work, he paused just to look at the\nearth scuffed up by his boots, to stare for a long moment at a stalk\nof tough grass and remember with a thrill which never lessened that\nthis was not native earth or grass, that he stood where none of his\nrace, or even of his kind, had stood before--on a new planet in a new\nsolar system.\n\nRaf's expert training and instruction paid off. By evening he had the\nflitter assembled save for the motor which still reposed on the\nturning block. One party had gone questing out into the grass and\nreturned with the story of a stream hidden in a gash in the plain, and\nWonstead carried the limp body of a rabbit-sized furred creature he\nhad knocked over at the waterside.\n\n\"Acted tame.\" Wonstead was proud of his kill. \"Stupid thing just stood\nand watched me while I let fly with a stone.\"\n\nRaf picked up the little body. Its fur was red-brown, plush-thick, and\nvery soft to the touch. The breast was creamy white and the forepaws\ncuriously short with an uncanny resemblance to his own hands. Suddenly\nhe wished that Wonstead had not killed it, though he supposed that\nChou, their biologist, would be grateful. But the animal looked\nparticularly defenseless. It would have been better not to mark their\nfirst day on this new world with a killing--even if it were the\nknocking over of a stupid rabbit thing. The pilot was glad when Chou\nbore it off and he no longer had to look at it.\n\nIt was after the evening meal that Raf was called into consultation by\nthe officers to receive his orders. When he reported that the flitter,\nbarring unexpected accidents, would be air-borne by the following\nafternoon, he was shown an enlarged picture from the records made\nduring the descent of the _RS 10_.\n\nThere was a city, right enough--showing up well from the air. Hobart\nstabbed a finger down into the heart of it.\n\n\"This lies south from here. We'll cruise in that direction.\"\n\nRaf would have liked to ask some questions of his own. The city\nphotographed was a sizable one. Why then this deserted land here? Why\nhadn't the inhabitants been out to investigate the puzzle of the space\nship's landing? He said slowly, \"I've mounted one gun, sir. Do you\nwant the other installed? It will mean that the flitter can only carry\nthree instead of four--\"\n\nHobart pulled his lower lip between his thumb and forefinger. He\nglanced at his lieutenant then to Lablet, sitting quietly to one side.\nIt was the latter who spoke first.\n\n\"I'd say this shows definite traces of retrogression.\" He touched the\nphotograph. \"The place may even be only a ruin.\"\n\n\"Very well. Leave off the other gun,\" Hobart ordered crisply. \"And be\nready to fly at dawn day after tomorrow with full field kit. You're\nsure she'll have at least a thousand-mile cruising radius?\"\n\nRaf suppressed a shrug. How could you tell what any machine would do\nunder new conditions? The flitter had been put through every possible\ntest in his home world. Whether she would perform as perfectly here\nwas another matter.\n\n\"They thought she would, sir,\" he replied. \"I'll take her up for a\nshakedown run tomorrow after the motor is installed.\"\n\nCaptain Hobart dismissed him with a nod, and Raf was glad to clatter\ndown ladders into the cool of the evening once more. Flying high in a\nformation of two lanes were some distant birds, at least he supposed\nthey were birds. But he did not call attention to them. Instead he\nwatched them out of sight, lingering alone with no desire to join\nthose crew members who had built a campfire a little distance from the\nship. The flames were familiar and cheerful, a portion, somehow, of\ntheir native world transported to the new.\n\nRaf could hear the murmur of voices. But he turned and went to the\nflitter. Taking his hand torch, he checked the work he had done during\nthe day. To-morrow--tomorrow he could take her up into the blue-green\nsky, circle out over the sea of grass for a short testing flight. That\nmuch he wanted to do.\n\nBut the thought of the cruise south, of venturing toward that\nsprawling splotch Hobart and Lablet identified as a city was somehow\ndistasteful, and he was reluctant to think about it.\n\n\n\n\n3\n\nSNAKE-DEVIL'S TRAIL\n\n\nDalgard drew the waterproof covering back over his brow, making a\ncheerful job of it, preparatory to their pushing out to sea once more.\nBut he was as intent upon what Sssuri had to tell as he was on his\noccupation of the moment.\n\n\"But that is not even a hopper rumor,\" he was protesting, breaking\ninto his companion's flow of thought.\n\n\"No. But, remember, to the runners yesterday is very far away. One\nnight is like another; they do not reckon time as we do, nor lay up\nmemories for future guidance. They left their native hunting grounds\nand are drifting south. And only a very great peril would lead the\nrunners into such a break. It is against all their instincts!\"\n\n\"So, long ago--which may be months, weeks, or just days--there came\ndeath out of the sea, and those who lived past its coming fled--\"\nDalgard repeated the scanty information Sssuri had won for them the\nnight before by patient hour-long coaxing. \"What kind of death?\"\n\nSssuri's great eyes, somber and a little tired, met his. \"To us there\nis only one kind of death to be greatly feared.\"\n\n\"But there are the snake-devils--\" protested the colony scout.\n\n\"To be hunted down by snake-devils is death, yes. But it is a quick\ndeath, a death which can come to any living thing that is not swift or\nwary enough. For to the snake-devils all things that live and move are\nmerely meat to fill the aching pit in their swollen bellies. But there\nwere in the old days other deaths, far worse than what one meets under\na snake-devil's claws and fangs. And those are the deaths we fear.\" He\nwas running the smooth haft of his spear back and forth through his\nfingers as if testing the balance of the weapon because the time was\nnot far away when he must rely upon it.\n\n\"Those Others!\" Dalgard shaped the words with his lips as well as in\nhis mind.\n\n\"Just so.\" Sssuri did not nod, but his thought was in complete\nagreement.\n\n\"Yet they have not come before--not since the ship of my fathers\nlanded here,\" Dalgard protested, not against Sssuri's judgment but\nagainst the whole idea.\n\nThe merman got to his feet, sweeping his arm to indicate not only the\ncove where they now sheltered but the continent behind it.\n\n\"Once they held all this. Then they warred and killed, until but a\nhandful lay in cover to lick their wounds and wait. It has been many\nthrees of seasons since they left that cover. But now they come\nagain--to loot their place of secrets--Perhaps in the time past they\nhave forgotten much so that now they must renew their knowledge.\"\n\nDalgard stowed the bow in the bottom of the outrigger. \"I think we had\nbetter go and see,\" he commented, \"so that we may report true tidings\nto our Elders--something more than rumors learned from night runners.\"\n\n\"That is so.\"\n\nThey paddled out to sea and turned the prow of the light craft north.\nThe character of the land did not change. Cliffs still walled the\ncoast, in some places rising sheer from the water, in others broken by\na footing of coarse beach. Only flying things were to be sighted over\ntheir rocky crowns.\n\nBut by midday there was an abrupt alteration in the scene. A wide\nriver cut through the heights and gave birth to a fan-shaped delta\nthickly covered with vegetation. Half hidden by the riot of growing\nthings was a building of the dome shape Dalgard knew so well. Its\nwindowless, doorless surface reflected the sunlight with a glassy\nsheen, and to casual inspection it was as untouched as it had been on\nthe day its masters had either died within it or left it for the last\ntime, perhaps centuries before.\n\n\"This is one way into the forbidden city,\" Sssuri announced. \"Once\nthey stationed guards here.\"\n\nDalgard had been about to suggest a closer inspection of the dome but\nthat remark made him hesitate. If it had been one of the\nfortifications rimming in a forbidden ground, there was more than an\neven chance that unwary invaders, even this long after, might stumble\ninto some trap still working automatically.\n\n\"Do we go upriver?\" He left it to Sssuri, who had the traditions of\nhis people to guide him, to make the decision.\n\nThe merman looked at the dome; it was evident from his attitude that\nhe had no wish to examine it more closely. \"They had machines which\nfought for them, and sometimes those machines still fight. This river\nis the natural entrance for an enemy. Therefore it would have been\nwell defended.\"\n\nUnder the sun the green reach of the delta had a most peaceful\nappearance. There was a family of duck-dogs fishing from the beach,\nscooping their broad bills into the mud to locate water worms. And\nmoth birds danced in the air currents overhead. Yet Dalgard was ready\nto agree with his companion--beware the easy way. They dipped their\npaddles deep and cut across the river current toward the cliffs to the\nnorth.\n\nTwo days of steady coastwise traveling brought them to a great bay.\nAnd Dalgard gasped as the full sight of the port confronting them\nburst into view.\n\nTiers of ledges had been cut and blasted in the native rock, extending\nfrom the sea back into the land in a series of giant steps. Each of\nthem was covered with buildings, and here the ancient war had left its\nmark. The rock itself had been brought to a bubbling boil and sent in\nnow-frozen rivers down that stairway in a half-dozen places,\noverwhelming all structures in its path, and leaving crystallized\nstreams to reflect the sun blindingly.\n\n\"So this is your secret city!\"\n\nBut Sssuri shook his round head. \"This is but the sea entrance to the\ncountry,\" he corrected. \"Here struck the day of fire, and we need not\nfear the machines which doubtless lie in wait elsewhere.\"\n\nThey beached the outrigger and hid it in the shell of one of the\nruined buildings on the lowest level. Dalgard sent out a questing\nthought, hoping to contact a hopper or even a duck-dog. But seemingly\nthe ruins were bare of animal life, as was true in most of the other\ntowns and cities he had explored in the past. The fauna of Astra was\nshy of any holding built by Those Others, no matter how long it may\nhave been left to the wind, and cleansing rain.\n\nWith difficulty and detours to avoid the rivers of once-molten rock,\nthey made their way slowly from ledge to ledge up that giant's\nstaircase, not stopping to explore any of the buildings as they\npassed. There was a taint of alien age about the city which repelled\nDalgard, and he was eager to get out of it into the clean countryside\nonce more. Sssuri sped on silent feet, his shoulders hunched, his\ndistaste for the structures to be read in every line of his supple\nbody.\n\nWhen they reached the top, Dalgard turned to gaze down to the restless\nsea. What a prospect! Perhaps Those Others had built thus for reasons\nof defense, but surely they, too, must have paused now and then to be\nproud of such a feat. It was the most impressive site he had yet seen,\nand his report of it would be a worthy addition to the Homeport\nrecords.\n\nA road ran straight from the top of the stair, stabbing inland without\ntaking any notice of the difficulties of the terrain, after the usual\narrogant manner of the alien engineers. But Sssuri did not follow it.\nInstead he struck off to the left, avoiding that easy path, choosing\nto cross through tangles which had once been gardens or through open\nfields.\n\nThey were well out of the sight of the city before they flushed their\nfirst hopper, a full-grown adult with oddly pale fur. Instead of\ndisplaying the usual fearless interest in strangers, the animal took\none swift look at them and fled as if a snake-devil had snorted at its\nthumping heels. And Dalgard received a sharp impression of terror, as\nif the hopper saw in him some frightening menace.\n\n\"What--?\" Honestly astounded, he looked to Sssuri for enlightenment.\n\nThe hoppers could be pests. They stole any small bright object which\naroused their interest. But they could also be persuaded to trade, and\nthey usually had no fear of either colonist or merman.\n\nSssuri's furred face might not convey much emotion, but by all the\nsigns Dalgard _could_ read he knew that the merman was as startled as\nhe by the strange behavior of the grass dweller.\n\n\"He is afraid of those who walk erect as we do,\" he made answer.\n\n_Those who walk erect_--Dalgard was quick to interpret that.\n\nHe knew that Those Others were biped, quasi-human in form, closer in\nphysical appearance to the colonists than to the mermen. And since\nnone of Dalgard's people had penetrated this far to the north, nor had\nthe mermen invaded this taboo territory until Sssuri had agreed to\ncome, that left only the aliens. Those strange people whom the\ncolonists feared without knowing why they feared them, whom the mermen\nhated with a hatred which had not lessened with the years of freedom.\nThe faint rumor carried by the migrating runners must be true, for\nhere was a hopper afraid of bipeds. And it must have been recently\nprovided with a reason for such fear, since hoppers' memories were\nvery short and such terror would have faded from its mind in a matter\nof weeks.\n\nSssuri halted in a patch of grass which reached to his waist belt. \"It\nis best to wait until the hours of dark.\"\n\nBut Dalgard could not agree. \"Better for you with your night sight,\"\nhe objected, \"but I do not have your eyes in my head.\"\n\nSssuri had to admit the justice of that. He could travel under the\nmoonless sky as sure-footed as under broad sunlight. But to guide a\nblundering Dalgard through unknown country was not practical. However,\nthey could take to cover and that they did as speedily as possible,\nusing a zigzag tactic which delayed their advance but took them from\none bit of protecting brush or grove of trees to the next, keeping to\nthe fields well away from the road.\n\nThey camped that night without fire in a pocket near a spring. And\nwhile Dalgard was alert to all about them, he knew that Sssuri was\nmind questing in a far wider circle, trying to contact a hopper, a\nrunner, any animal that could answer in part the inquiries they had.\nWhen Dalgard could no longer hold open weary eyes, his last waking\nmemory was that of his companion sitting statue-still, his spear\nacross his knees, his head leaning a trifle forward as if what he\nlistened to was as vocal as the hum of night insects.\n\nWhen the colony scout roused in the morning, his companion was\nstretched full length on the other side of the spring, but his head\ncame up as Dalgard moved.\n\n\"We may go forward without fear,\" he shaped the assurance. \"What has\ntroubled this land has gone.\"\n\n\"A long time ago?\"\n\nDalgard was not surprised at Sssuri's negative answer. \"Within days\n_they_ have been here. But they have gone once more. It will be wise\nfor us to learn what they wanted here.\"\n\n\"Have they come to establish a base here once more?\" Dalgard brought\ninto the open the one threat which had hung over his own clan since\nthey first learned that a few of Those Others still lived--even if\noverseas.\n\n\"If that is their plan, they have not yet done it.\" Sssuri rolled over\non his back and stretched. He had lost that tenseness of a hound in\nleash which had marked him the night before. \"This was one of their\nsecret places, holding much of their knowledge. They may return here\non quest for that learning.\"\n\nAll at once Dalgard was conscious of a sense of urgency. Suppose that\nwhat Sssuri suggested was the truth, that Those Others were attempting\nto recover the skills which had brought on the devastating war that\nhad turned this whole eastern continent into a wilderness? Equipped\nwith even the crumbs of such discoveries, they would be enemies\nagainst which the Terran colonists could not hope to stand. The few\nweapons their outlaw ancestors had brought with them on their\ndesperate flight to the stars were long since useless, and they had\nhad no way of duplicating them. Since childhood Dalgard had seen no\narms except the bows and the sword-knives carried by all venturing\naway from Homeport. And what use would a bow or a foot or two of\nsharpened metal be against things which could kill from a distance or\nturn rock itself into a flowing, molten river?\n\nHe was impatient to move on, to reach this city of forgotten knowledge\nwhich Sssuri was sure lay before them. Perhaps the colonists could\ndraw upon what was stored there as well as Those Others could.\n\nThen he remembered--not only remembered but was corrected by Sssuri.\n\"Think not of taking _their_ weapons into your hands.\" Sssuri did not\nlook up as he gave that warning. \"Long ago your fathers' fathers knew\nthat the knowledge of Those Others was not for their taking.\"\n\nA dimly remembered story, a warning impressed upon him during his\nfirst guided trips into the ruins near Homeport flashed into Dalgard's\nmind. Yes, he knew that some things had been forbidden to his kind.\nFor one, it was best not to examine too closely the bands of color\npatterns which served Those Others as a means of written record. Tapes\nof the aliens' records had been found and stored at Homeport. But not\none of the colonists had ventured to try to break the color code and\nlearn what lay locked in those bands. Once long ago such an experiment\nhad led to the brink of disaster, and such delvings were now\nconsidered too dangerous to be allowed.\n\nBut there was no harm in visiting this city, and certainly he must\nmake some report to the Council about what might be taking place here,\nespecially if Those Others were in residence or visited the site.\n\nSssuri still kept to the fields, avoiding the highway, until\nmid-morning, and then he made an abrupt turn and brought them out on\nthe soil-drifted surface of the road. The land here was seemingly\ndeserted. No moth birds performed their air ballets overhead, and they\ndid not see a single hopper. That is, they did not until the road\ndipped before them and they started down into a cupped hollow filled\nwith buildings. The river, whose delta they had earlier seen, made a\nhalf loop about the city, lacing it in. And here were no signs of the\nwarfare which had ruined the port.\n\nBut in the middle of the road lay a bloody bunch of fur and splintered\nbone, insects busy about it. Sssuri used the point of his spear to\nstraighten out the small corpse, displaying its headlessness. And\nbefore they reached the outer buildings of the city they found four\nmore hoppers all mangled.\n\n\"Not a snake-devil,\" Dalgard deduced. As far as he knew only the huge\nreptiles or their smaller flying-dragon cousins preyed upon animals.\nBut a snake-devil would have left no remains of anything as small as a\nhopper, one mouthful which could not satisfy its gnawing hunger. And a\nflying dragon would have picked the bones clean.\n\n\"_Them_!\" Sssuri's reply was clipped. \"They hunt for sport.\"\n\nDalgard felt a little sick. To his mind, hoppers were to be treated\nwith friendship. Only against the snake-devils and the flying dragons\nwere the colonists ever at war. No wonder that hopper had run from\nthem back on the plain during yesterday's journey!\n\nThe buildings before them were not the rounded domes of the isolated\nfarms, but a series of upward-pointing shafts. They walked through a\ntall gap which must have supported a now-disappeared barrier gate, and\ntheir passing was signaled by a whispering sound as they shuffled\nthrough the loose sand and soil drifted there in a miniature dune.\n\nThis city was in a better state of preservation than any Dalgard had\npreviously visited. But he had no desire to enter any of the gaping\ndoorways. It was as if the city rejected him and his kind, as if to\nthe past that brooded here he was no more than a curious hopper or a\nfluttering, short-lived moth bird.\n\n\"Old--old and with wisdom hidden in it--\" he caught the trail of\nthought from Sssuri. And he was certain that the merman was no more at\nease here than he himself was.\n\nAs the street they followed brought them into an open space surrounded\nby more imposing buildings, they made another discovery which blotted\nout all thoughts of forbidden knowledge and awakened them to a more\nnormal and everyday danger.\n\nA fountain, which no longer played but gave birth to a crooked stream\nof water, was in the center. And in the muddy verge of the stream,\npressed deep, was the fresh track of a snake-devil. Almost full grown,\nDalgard estimated, measuring the print with his fingers. Sssuri\npivoted slowly, studying the circle of buildings about them.\n\n\"An hour--maybe two--\" Dalgard gave a hunter's verdict on the age of\nthe print. He, too, eyed those buildings. To meet a snake-devil in the\nopen was one thing, to play hide-and-seek with the cunning monster in\na warren such as this was something else again. He hoped that the\nreptile had been heading for the open, but he doubted it. This mass of\nbuildings would provide just the type of shelter which would appeal to\nit for a lair. And snake-devils did not den alone!\n\n\"Try by the river,\" Sssuri gave advice. Like Dalgard, he accepted the\nnecessity of the chase. No intelligent creature ever lost the chance\nto kill a snake-devil when fortune offered it. And he and the scout\nhad hunted together on such trails before. Now they slipped into\nfamiliar roles from long practice.\n\nThey took a route which should lead them to the river, and within a\nmatter of yards, came across evidence proving that the merman had\nguessed correctly; a second claw print was pressed deep in a patch of\ndrifted soil.\n\nHere the buildings were of a new type, windowless, perhaps\nstorehouses. But what pleased Dalgard most was the fact that most of\nthem showed tightly closed doors. There was no chance for their prey\nto lurk in wait.\n\n\"We should smell it.\" Sssuri picked that worry out of the scout's mind\nand had a ready answer for it.\n\nSure--they should smell the lair; nothing could cloak the horrible\nodor of a snake-devil's home. Dalgard sniffed vigorously as he padded\nalong. Though odd smells clung to the strange buildings none of them\nwere actively obnoxious--yet.\n\n\"River--\"\n\nThere was the river at the end of the way they had been following, a\nway which ended in a wharf built out over the oily flow of water.\nBlank walls were on either side. If the snake-devil had come this way,\nhe had found no hiding place.\n\n\"Across the river--\"\n\nDalgard gave a resigned grunt. For some reason he disliked the thought\nof swimming that stream, of having his skin laved by the turgid water\nwith its brown sheen.\n\n\"There is no need to swim.\"\n\nDalgard's gaze followed Sssuri's pointing finger. But what he saw\nbobbing up and down, pulled a little downstream by the current, did\nnot particularly reassure him. It was manifestly a boat, but the form\nwas as alien as the city around them.\n\n\n\n\n4\n\nCIVILIZATION\n\n\nRaf surveyed the wide sweep of prairie where dawn gave a gray tinge to\nsoften the distance and mark the rounded billows of the ever-rippling\ngrass. He tried to analyze what it was about this world which made it\nseem so untouched, so fresh and new. There were large sections of his\nown Terra which had been abandoned after the Big Burn-Off and the\natomic wars, or later after the counterrevolution which had defeated\nthe empire of Pax, during which mankind had slipped far back on the\nroad to civilization. But he had never experienced this same feeling\nwhen he had ventured into those wildernesses. Almost he could believe\nthat the records Hobart had showed him were false, that this world had\nnever known intelligent life herding together in cities.\n\nHe walked slowly down the ramp, drawing deep breaths of the crisp air.\nThe day would grow warmer with the rising sun. But now it was just the\nsort of morning which led him to be glad he was alive--and young!\nMaybe part of it was because he was free of the ship and at last not\njust excess baggage but a man with a definite job before him.\n\nSpacemen tended to be young. But until this moment Raf had never felt\nthe real careless freedom of youth. Now he was moved by a desire to\ndisobey orders--to take the flitter up by himself and head off into\nthe blue of the brightening sky for more than just a test flight, not\nto explore Hobart's city but to cruise over the vast sea of grass and\nfind out its wonders for himself.\n\nBut the discipline which had shaped him almost since birth sent him\nnow to check the flyer and wait, inwardly impatient, for Hobart,\nLablet, and Soriki, the com-tech, to join him.\n\nThe wait was not a long one since the three others, with equipment\nhung about, tramped down the ramp as Raf settled himself behind the\ncontrol board of the flyer. He triggered the shield which snapped over\nthem for a windbreak and brought the flitter up into the spreading\ncolor of the morning. Beside him Hobart pressed the button of the\nautomatic recorder, and in the seat behind, Soriki had the headset of\nthe com clamped over his ears. They were not only making a record of\ntheir trip, they were continuing in constant communication with the\nship--now already a silver pencil far to the rear.\n\nIt was some two hours later that they discovered what was perhaps one\nreason for the isolation of the district in which the _RS 10_ had set\ndown. Rolling foothills rose beneath them and miles ahead the\nwhite-capped peaks of a mountain range made a broken outline against\nthe turquoise sky. The broken lands would be a formidable barrier for\nany foot travelers: there were no easy roads through that series of\nsharp lifts and narrow valleys. And the one stream they followed for a\nshort space descended from the heights in spectacular falls. Twice\nthey skimmed thick growths of trees, so tightly packed that from the\nair they resembled a matted carpet of green-blue. And to cut through\nsuch a forest would be an impossible task.\n\nThe four in the flitter seldom spoke. Raf kept his attention on the\ncontrols. Sudden currents of air were tricky here, and he had to be\nconstantly alert to hold the small flyer on an even keel. His glimpses\nof what lay below were only snatched ones.\n\nAt last it was necessary to zoom far above the vegetation of the lower\nslopes, to reach an altitude safe enough to clear the peaks ahead.\nSince the air supply within the windshield was constant they need not\nfear lack of oxygen. But Raf was privately convinced, as they soared,\nthat the range might well compare in height with those Asian mountains\nwhich dominated all the upflung reaches of his native world.\n\nWhen they were over the sharp points of that chain disaster almost\novertook them. A freakish air current caught the flitter as if in a\ngiant hand, and Raf fought for control as they lost altitude past the\nmargin of safety. Had he not allowed for just such a happening they\nmight have been smashed against one of the rock tips over which they\nskimmed to a precarious safety. Raf, his mouth dry, his hands sweating\non the controls, took them up--higher than was necessary--to coast\nabove the last of that rocky spine to see below the beginning of the\ndownslopes leading to the plains the range cut in half. He heard\nHobart draw a hissing breath.\n\n\"That was a close call.\" Lablet's precise, lecturer's voice cut\nthrough the drone of the motor.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Soriki echoed, \"looked like we might be sandwich meat there\nfor a while. The kid knows his stuff after all.\"\n\nRaf grinned a little sourly, but he did not answer that. He _ought_ to\nknow his trade. Why else would he be along? They were each specialists\nin one or two fields. But he had good sense enough to keep his mouth\nshut. That way the less one had to regret minutes--or hours--later.\n\nThe land on the south side of the mountains was different in character\nto the wild northern plains.\n\n\"Fields!\"\n\nIt did not require that identification from Lablet to point out what\nthey had already seen. The section below was artificially divided into\nlong narrow strips. But the vegetation growing on those strips was no\ndifferent from the northern grass they had seen about the spacer.\n\n\"Not cultivated now,\" the scientist amended his first report. \"It's\nreverting to grassland--\"\n\nRaf brought the flitter closer to the ground so that when a domed\nstructure arose out of a tangle of overgrown shrubs and trees they\nwere not more than fifty feet above it. There was no sign of life\nabout the dwelling, if dwelling it was, and the unkempt straggle of\ngrowing things suggested that it had been left to itself through more\nthan one season. Lablet wanted to set down and explore, but the\ncaptain was intent upon reaching the city. A solitary farm was of\nlittle value compared with what they might learn from a metropolis.\nSo, rather to Raf's relief, he was ordered on.\n\nHe could not have explained why he shrank from such investigation.\nWhere earlier that morning he had wanted to take the flitter and go\noff by himself to explore the world which seemed so bright and new,\nnow he was glad that he was only the pilot of the flyer and that the\nothers were not only in his company but ready to make the decisions.\nHe had a queer distaste for the countryside, a disinclination to land\nnear that dome.\n\nBeyond the first of the deserted farms they came to the highway and,\nsince the buckled and half-buried roadway ran south, Hobart suggested\nthat they use it as a visible guide. More isolated dome houses showed\nin the course of an hour. And their fields were easy to map from the\nair. But nowhere did the Terrans see any indication that those fields\nwere in use. Nor were there any signs of animal or bird life. The\nweird desolation of the landscape began to work its spell on the men\nin the flitter. There was something unnatural about the country, and\nwith every mile the flyer clocked off, Raf longed to be heading in the\nopposite direction.\n\nThe domes drew closer together, made a cluster at crossroads, gathered\ninto a town in which all the buildings were the same shape and size,\nlike the cells of a wasp nest. Raf wondered if those who had built\nthem had not been humanoid at all, but perhaps insects with a hive\nmind. And because that thought was unpleasant he resolutely turned his\nattention to the machine he piloted.\n\nThey passed over four such towns, all marking intersections of roads\nrunning east and west, north and south, with precise exactness. The\nsun was at noon or a little past that mark when Captain Hobart gave\nthe order to set down so that they could break out rations and eat.\n\nRaf brought the flitter down on the cracked surface of the road,\nmistrusting what might lie hidden in the field grass. They got out and\nwalked for a space along pavement which had once been smooth.\n\n\"High-powered traffic--\" That was Lablet. He had gone down on one\nknee and was tracing a finger along the substance.\n\n\"Straight--\" Soriki squinted against the sun. \"Nothing stopped them,\ndid it? We want a road here and we'll get it! That sort of thing. Must\nhave been master engineers.\"\n\nTo Raf the straight highways suggested something else. Master\nengineering, certainly. But a ruthlessness too, as if the builders,\nwho refused to accept any modifications of their original plans from\nnature, might be as arrogant and self-assured in other ways. He did\nnot admire this relic of civilization; in fact it added to his vague\nuneasiness.\n\nThe land was so still, under the whisper of the wind. He discovered\nthat he was listening--listening for the buzz of an insect, the squeak\nof some grass dweller, anything which would mean that there was life\nabout them. As he chewed on the ration concentrate and drank sparingly\nfrom his canteen, Raf continued to listen. Without result.\n\nHobart and Lablet were engrossed in speculation about what might lie\nahead. Soriki had gone back to the flitter to make his report to the\nship. The pilot sat where he was, content to be forgotten, but eager\nto see an animal peering at him from cover, a bird winging through the\nair.\n\n\"--if we don't hit it by nightfall--But we can't be that far away!\nI'll stay out and try tomorrow.\" That was Hobart. And since he was\ncaptain what he said was probably what they would do. Raf shied away\nfrom the thought of spending the night in this haunted land. Though,\non the other hand, he would be utterly opposed to lifting the flitter\nover those mountains again except in broad daylight.\n\nBut the problem did not arise, for they found their city in the\nmidafternoon, the road bringing them straight to an amazing collection\nof buildings, which appeared doubly alien to their eyes since it did\nnot include any of the low domes they had seen heretofore.\n\nHere were towers of needle slimness, solid blocks of almost windowless\nmasonry looking twice as bulky beside those same towers, archways\nstringing at dizzy heights above the ground from one skyscraper to the\nnext. And here time and nature had been at work. Some of the towers\nwere broken off, a causeway displayed a gap--Once it had been a\nbreathtaking feat of engineering, far more impressive than the\nhighway, now it was a slowly collapsing ruin.\n\nBut before they had time to take it all in Soriki gave an exclamation.\n\"Something coming through on our wave band, sir!\" He leaned forward to\ndig fingers into Hobart's shoulder. \"Message of some kind--I'd swear\nto it!\"\n\nHobart snapped into action. \"Kurbi--set down--there!\"\n\nHis choice of a landing place was the flat top of a near-by building,\none which stood a little apart from its neighbors and, as Raf could\nsee, was not overlooked except by a ruined tower. He circled the\nflitter. The machine had been specially designed to land and take off\nin confined spaces, and he knew all there was possible to learn about\nits handling on his home world. But he had never tried to bring it\ndown on a roof, and he was very sure that now he had no margin for\nerror left him, not with Hobart breathing impatiently beside him, his\nhands moving as if, as a pilot of a spacer, he could well take over\nthe controls here.\n\nRaf circled twice, eyeing the surface of the roof in search of any\nbreak which could mean a crack-up at landing. And then, though he\nrefused to be hurried by the urgency of the men with him, he came in,\ncutting speed, bringing them down with only a slight jar.\n\nHobart twisted around to face Soriki. \"Still getting it?\"\n\nThe other, cupping his earphones to his head with his hands, nodded.\n\"Give me a minute or two,\" he told them, \"and I'll have a fix. They're\nexcited about something--the way this jabber-jabber is coming\nthrough--\"\n\n\"About us,\" Raf thought. The ruined tower topped them to the south.\nAnd to the east and west there were buildings as high as the one they\nwere perched on. But the town he had seen as he maneuvered for a\nlanding had held no signs of life. Around them were only signs of\ndecay.\n\nLablet got out of the flitter and walked to the edge of the roof,\nleaning against the parapet to focus his vision glasses on what lay\nbelow. After a moment Raf followed his example.\n\nSilence and desolation, windows like the eye pits in bone-picked\nskulls. There were even some small patches of vegetation rooted and\ngrowing in pockets erosion had carved in the walls. To the pilot's\nuninformed eyes the city looked wholly dead.\n\n\"Got it!\" Soriki's exultant cry brought them back to the flitter. As\nif his body was the indicator, he had pivoted until his outstretched\nhand pointed southwest. \"About a quarter of a mile that way.\"\n\nThey shielded their eyes against the westering sun. A block of solid\nmasonry loomed high in the sky, dwarfing not only the building they\nwere standing on but all the towers around it. Its imposing lines made\nclear its one-time importance.\n\n\"Palace,\" mused Lablet, \"or capitol. I'd say it was just about the\nheart of the city.\"\n\nHe dropped his glasses to swing on their cord, his eyes glistening as\nhe spoke directly to Raf.\n\n\"Can you set us down on that?\"\n\nThe pilot measured the curving roof of the structure. A crazy fool\nmight try to make a landing there. But he was no crazy fool. \"Not on\nthat roof!\" he spoke with decision.\n\nTo his relief the captain confirmed his verdict with a slow nod.\n\"Better find out more first.\" Hobart could be cautious when he wanted\nto. \"Are they still broadcasting, Soriki?\"\n\nThe com-tech had stripped the earphones from his head and was rubbing\none ear. \"Are they!\" he exploded. \"I'd think you could hear them clear\nover there, sir!\"\n\nAnd they could. The gabble-gabble which bore no resemblance to any\nlanguage Terra knew boiled out of the phones.\n\n\"Someone's excited,\" Lablet commented in his usual mild tone.\n\n\"Maybe they've discovered us.\" Hobart's hand went to the weapon at his\nbelt. \"We must make peaceful contact--if we can.\"\n\nLablet took off his helmet and ran his fingers through the scrappy\nginger-and-gray fringe receding from his forehead. \"Yes--contact will\nbe necessary--\" he said thoughtfully.\n\nWell, he was supposed to be their expert on that. Raf watched the\nolder man with something akin to amusement. The pilot had a suspicion\nthat none of the other three, Lablet included, was in any great hurry\nto push through contact with unknown aliens. It was a case of dancing\nalong on shore before having to plunge into the chill of autumn sea\nwaves. Terrans had explored their own solar system, and they had\nspeculated learnedly for generations on the problem of intelligent\nalien life. There had been all kinds of reports by experts and\nwould-be experts. But the stark fact remained that heretofore mankind\nas born on the third planet of Sol had _not_ encountered intelligent\nalien life. And just how far did speculations, reports, and arguments\ngo when one was faced with the problem to be solved practically--and\nspeedily?\n\nRaf's own solution would have been to proceed with caution and yet\nmore caution. Under his technical training he had far more imagination\nthan any of his officers had ever realized. And now he was certain\nthat the best course of action was swift retreat until they knew more\nabout what was to be faced.\n\nBut in the end the decision was taken out of their hands. A muffled\nexclamation from Lablet brought them all around to see that distant\ncurving roof crack wide open. From the shadows within, a flyer\nspiraled up into the late afternoon sky.\n\nRaf reached the flitter in two leaps. Without orders he had the spray\ngun ready for action, on point and aimed at the bobbing machine\nheading toward them. From the earphones Soriki had left on the seat\nthe gabble had risen to a screech and one part of Raf's brain noted\nthat the sounds were repetitious: was an order to surrender being\nbroadcast? His thumb was firm on the firing button of the gun and he\nwas about to send a warning burst to the right of the alien when an\norder from Hobart stopped him cold.\n\n\"Take it easy, Kurbi.\"\n\nSoriki said something about a \"gun-happy flitter pilot,\" but, Raf\nnoted with bleak eyes, the com-tech kept his own hand close to his\nbelt arm. Only Lablet stood watching the oncoming alien ship with\nplacidity. But then, as Raf had learned through the long voyage of the\nspacer, a period of time which had left few character traits of any of\nthe crew hidden from their fellows, the xenobiologist was a fatalist\nand strictly averse to personal combat.\n\nThe pilot did not leave his seat at the gun. But within seconds he\nknew that they had lost the initial advantage. As the tongue-shaped\nstranger thrust at them and then swept on to glide above their heads\nso that the weird shadow of the ship licked them from light to dark\nand then to light again, Raf was certain that his superiors had made\nthe wrong decision. They should have left the city as soon as they\npicked up those signals--if they could have gone then. He studied the\nother flyer. Its lines suggested speed as well as mobility, and he\nbegan to doubt if they _could_ have escaped with that craft trailing\nthem.\n\nWell, what would they do now? The alien flyer could not land here, not\nwithout coming down flat upon the flitter. Maybe it would cruise\noverhead as a warning threat until the city dwellers were able to\nreach the Terrans in some other manner. Tense, the four spacemen stood\nwatching the graceful movements of the flyer. There were no visible\nportholes or openings anywhere along its ovoid sides. It might be a\nrobot-controlled ship, it might be anything, Raf thought, even a bomb\nof sorts. If it was being flown by some human--or nonhuman--flyer, he\nwas a master pilot.\n\n\"I don't understand,\" Soriki moved impatiently. \"They're just\nshuttling around up there. What do we do now?\"\n\nLablet turned his head. He was smiling faintly. \"We wait,\" he told the\ncom-tech. \"I should imagine it takes time to climb twenty flights of\nstairs--if they have stairs--\"\n\nSoriki's attention fell from the flyer hovering over their heads to\nthe surface of the roof. Raf had already looked that over without\nseeing any opening. But he did not doubt the truth of Lablet's\nsurmise. Sooner or later the aliens were going to reappear. And it did\nnot greatly matter to the marooned Terrans whether they would drop\nfrom the sky or rise from below.\n\n\n\n\n5\n\nBANDED DEVIL\n\n\nFamiliar only with the wave-riding outriggers, Dalgard took his seat\nin the alien craft with misgivings. And oddly enough it also bothered\nhim to occupy a post which earlier had served not a nonhuman such as\nSssuri, whom he admired, but a humanoid whom he had been taught from\nchildhood to avoid--if not fear. The skiff was rounded at bow and\nstern with very shallow sides and displayed a tendency to whirl about\nin the current, until Sssuri, with his instinctive knowledge of\nwatercraft, used one of the queerly shaped paddles tucked away in the\nbottom to both steer and propel them. They did not strike directly\nacross the river but allowed the current to carry them in a diagonal\npath so that they came out on the opposite bank some distance to the\nwest.\n\nSssuri brought them ashore with masterly skill where a strip of sod\nangled down to the edge of the water, marking, Dalgard decided, what\nhad once been a garden. The buildings on this side of the river were\nnot set so closely together. Each, standing some two or three stories\nhigh, was encircled by green, as if this had been a section of private\ndwellings.\n\nThey pulled the light boat out of the water and Sssuri pointed at the\nopen door of the nearest house. \"In there--\"\n\nDalgard agreed that it might be well to hide the craft against the\nreturn. Although as yet they had found no physical evidence, other\nthan the dead hoppers, that they might not be alone in the city, he\nwanted a means of escape ready if such a flight would be necessary. In\nthe meantime there was the snake-devil to track, and that wily\ncreature, if it had swum the river, might be lurking at present in the\nnext silent street--or miles away.\n\nSssuri, spear ready, was trotting along the paved lane, his head up as\nhe thought-quested for any hint of life about them. Dalgard tried to\nfollow that lead. But he knew that it would be Sssuri's stronger power\nwhich would warn them first.\n\nThey cast east from where they had landed, studying the soil of each\ngarden spot, hunting for the unmistakable spoor of the giant reptile.\nAnd within a matter of minutes they found it, the mud still moist as\nDalgard proved with an exploring fingertip. At the same time Sssuri\ntwirled his spear significantly. Before them the lane ran on between\ntwo walls without any breaks. Dalgard uncased his bow and strung it.\nFrom his quiver he chose one of the powerful arrows, the points of\nwhich were kept capped until use.\n\nA snake-devil, with its nervous system controlled not from the tiny,\nbrainless head but from a series of auxiliary \"brains\" at points along\nits powerful spine, could and would go on fighting even after that\nhead was shorn away, as the first colonists had discovered when they\ndepended on the deadly ray guns fatal to any Terran life. But the\npoison-tipped arrow Dalgard now handled, with confidence in its\ncomplete efficiency, paralyzed within moments and killed in a\nquarter-hour one of the scaled monstrosities.\n\n\"Lair--\"\n\nDalgard did not need that warning thought from his companion. There\nwas no mistaking that sickly sweet stench born of decaying animal\nmatter, which was the betraying effluvium of a snake-devil's lair. He\nturned to the right-hand wall and with a running leap reached its\nbroad top. The lane curved to end in an archway cut through another\nwall, which was higher than Dalgard's head even when he stood on his\npresent elevation. But bands of ornamental patterning ran along the\ntaller barrier, and he was certain that it could be climbed. He\nlowered a hand to Sssuri and hoisted the merman up to join him.\n\nBut Sssuri stood for a long moment looking ahead, and Dalgard knew\nthat the merman was disturbed, that the wall before them had some\nterrifying meaning for the native Astran. So vivid was the impression\nof what could only be termed horror--that Dalgard dared to ask a\nquestion:\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\nThe merman's yellow eyes turned from the wall to his companion. Behind\nhis hatred of this place there was another emotion Dalgard could not\nread.\n\n\"This is the place of sorrow, the place of separation. But _they_\npaid--oh, how they paid--after that day when the fire fell from the\nsky.\" His scaled and taloned feet moved in a little shuffling war\ndance, and his spear spun and quivered in the sunlight, as Dalgard had\nseen the spears of the mer-warriors move in the mock combats of their\nunexplained, and to his kind unexplainable, rituals. \"Then did our\nspears drink, and knives eat!\" Sssuri's fingers brushed the hilt of\nthe wicked blade swinging from his belt. \"Then did the People make\nseparations and sorrows for _them_! And it was accomplished that we\nwent forth into the sea to be no longer bond but free. And _they_ went\ndown into the darkness and were no more--\" In Dalgard's head the chant\nof his friend skirled up in a paean of exultation. Sssuri shook his\nspear at the wall.\n\n\"No more the beast and the death,\" his thoughts swelled, a shout of\nvictory. \"For where are _they_ who sat and watched many deaths? _They_\nare gone as the wave smashes itself upon the coast rocks and is no\nmore. But the People are free and never more shall Those Others put\nbonds upon them! Therefore do I say that this is a place of nothing,\nwhere evil has turned in upon itself and come to nothing. Just as\nThose Others will come to nothing since their own evil will in the end\neat them up!\"\n\nHe strode forward along the wall until he came to the barrier,\nseemingly oblivious of the carrion reek which told of a snake-devil's\nden somewhere about. And he raised his arm high, bringing the point of\nhis spear gratingly along the carved surface. Nor did it seem to\nDalgard a futile gesture, for Sssuri lived and breathed, stood free\nand armed in the city of his enemies--and the city was dead.\n\nTogether they climbed the barrier, and then Dalgard discovered that it\nwas the rim of an arena which must have seated close to a thousand in\nthe days of its use. It was a perfect oval in shape with tiers of\nseats now forming a staircase down to the center, where was a section\nringed about by a series of archways. A high stone grille walled this\nportion away from the seats as if to protect the spectators from what\nmight enter through those portals.\n\nDalgard noted all this only in passing, for the arena was occupied,\nvery much occupied. And he knew the occupiers only too well.\n\nThree full-grown snake-devils were stretched at pulpy ease, their\nfilled bellies obscenely round, their long necks crowned with their\ntiny heads flat on the sand as they napped. A pair of half-grown\nmonsters, not yet past the six-foot stage, tore at some indescribable\nremnants of their elders' feasting, hissing at each other and aiming\nvicious blows whenever they came within possible fighting distance.\nThree more, not long out of their mothers' pouches scrabbled in the\nearth about the sleeping adults.\n\n\"A good catch,\" Dalgard signaled Sssuri, and the merman nodded.\n\nThey climbed down from seat to seat. This could not rightfully be\ntermed hunting when the quarry might be picked off so easily without\nrisk to the archer. But as Dalgard notched his first arrow, he sighted\nsomething so surprising that he did not let the poisoned dart fly.\n\nThe nearest sleeping reptile which he had selected as his mark\nstretched lazily without raising its head or opening its small eyes.\nAnd the sun caught on a glistening band about its short foreleg just\nbeneath the joint of the taloned pawhands. No natural scales could\nreflect the light with such a brilliant glare. It could be only one\nthing--metal! A metal bracelet about the tearing arm of a snake-devil!\nDalgard looked at the other two sleepers. One was lying on its belly\nwith its forearms gathered under it so that he could not see if it,\nalso, were so equipped. But the other--yes, it was banded!\n\nSssuri stood at the grille, one hand on its stone divisions. His\nsurprise equaled Dalgard's. It was not in his experience either that\nthe untamed snake-devils, regarded by merman and human alike as so\ndangerous as to be killed on sight, could be banded--as if they were\npersonal pets!\n\nFor a moment or two a wild idea crossed Dalgard's mind. How long was\nthe natural life span of a snake-devil? Until the coming of the\ncolonists they had been the undisputed rulers of the deserted\ncontinent, stupid as they were, simply because of their strength and\nferocity. A twelve-foot, scale-armored monster, that could tear apart\na duocorn with ease, might not be successfully vanquished by any of\nthe fauna of Astra. And since the monsters did not venture into the\nsea, contact between them and the mermen had been limited to casual\nencounters at rare intervals. So, how long did a snake-devil live?\nWere these creatures sprawled here in sleep ones that had known the\ndomination of Those Others--though the fall of the master race of\nAstra must have occurred generations, hundreds of years in the past?\n\n\"No,\" Sssuri's denial cut through that. \"The smaller one is not yet\nfull-grown. It lacks the second neck ring. Yet it is banded.\"\n\nThe merman was right. That unpleasant wattle of armored flesh which\nnecklaced the serpent throat of the devil Dalgard had picked as his\ntarget was thin, not the thick roll of fat such as distinguished its\ntwo companions. It was not fully adult, yet the band was plain to see\non the foreleg now stretched to its full length as the sun bored down\nto supply the heavy heat the snake-devils relished next to food.\n\n\"Then--\" Dalgard did not like to think of what might be the answer to\nthat \"then.\"\n\nSssuri shrugged. \"It is plain that these are not wild roamers. They\nare here for a purpose. And that purpose--\" Suddenly his arm shot out\nso that his fingers protruded through the slits in the stone grille.\n\"See?\"\n\nDalgard had already seen, in seeing he knew hot and terrible anger.\nOut of the filthy mess in which the snake-devils wallowed, something\nhad rolled, perhaps thrown about in play by the unspeakable offspring.\nA skull, dried scraps of fur and flesh still clinging to it, stared\nhollow-eyed up at them. At least one merman had fallen prey to the\nnightmares who ruled the arena.\n\nSssuri hissed and the red rage in his mind was plain to Dalgard. \"Once\nmore they deal death here--\" His eyes went from the skull to the\nmonsters. \"Kill!\" The command was imperative and sharp.\n\nDalgard had qualified as a master bowman before he had first gone\nroving. And the killing of snake-devils was a task which had been set\nevery colonist since their first brush with the creatures.\n\nHe snapped the cap off the glass splinter point, designed to pin and\nthen break off in the hide so that any clawing foot which tore out an\narrow could not rid the victim of the poisonous head. The archer's\nmark was under the throat where the scales were soft and there was a\nchance of piercing the skin with the first shot.\n\nThe growls of the two feeding youngsters covered the snap of the bow\ncord as Dalgard shot. And he did not miss. The brilliant scarlet\nfeather of the arrow quivered in the baggy roll of flesh.\n\nWith a scream which tore at the human's eardrums, the snake-devil\nreared to its hind feet. It made a tearing motion with the banded\nforearm which scraped across the back of one of its companions. And\nthen it fell back to the blood-stained sand, limp, a greenish foam\ndrooling from its fangs.\n\nAs the monster that the dead devil had raked roused, Dalgard had his\nchance for another good mark. And the second scarlet shaft sped\nstraight to the target.\n\nBut the third creature which had been sleeping belly down on the sand\npresented only its armored back, a hopeless surface for an arrow to\npierce. It had opened its eyes and was watching the now motionless\nbodies of its fellows. But it showed no disposition to move. It was\nalmost as if it somehow understood that as long as it remained in its\npresent position it was safe.\n\n\"The small ones--\"\n\nDalgard needed no prompting. He picked off easily enough the two\nhalf-grown ones. The infants were another problem. Far less sluggish\nthan their huge elders they sensed that they were in danger and fled.\nOne took refuge in the pouch of its now-dead parent, and the others\nmoved so fast that Dalgard found them difficult targets. He killed one\nwhich had almost reached an archway and at length nicked the second in\nthe foot, knowing that, while the poison would be slower in acting, it\nwould be as sure.\n\nThrough all of this the third adult devil continued to lie motionless,\nonly its wicked eyes giving any indication that it was alive. Dalgard\nwatched it impatiently. Unless it would move, allow him a chance to\naim at the soft underparts, there was little chance of killing it.\n\nWhat followed startled both hunters, versed as they were in the usual\nmechanics of killing snake-devils. It had been an accepted premise,\nthrough the years since the colonists had known of the monsters, that\nthe creatures were relatively brainless, mere machines which fought,\nate, and killed, incapable of any intelligent reasoning, and therefore\nonly dangerous when one was surprised by them or when the hunter was\nforced to face them inadequately armed.\n\nThis snake-devil was different, as it became increasingly plain to the\ntwo behind the grille. It had remained safe during the slaughter of\nits companions because it had not moved, almost as if it had wit\nenough _not_ to move. And now, when it did change position, its\nmaneuvers, simple as they were, underlined the fact that this one\ncreature appeared to have thought out a solution to its situation--as\nrational a solution as Dalgard might have produced had it been his\nproblem.\n\nStill keeping its soft underparts covered, it edged about in the sand\nuntil its back, with the impenetrable armor plates, was facing the\ngrille behind which the hunters stood. Retracting its neck between its\nshoulders and hunching its powerful back limbs under it, it rushed\nfrom that point of danger straight for one of the archways.\n\nDalgard sent an arrow after it. Only to see the shaft scrape along the\nheavy scales and bounce to the sand. Then the snake-devil was gone.\n\n\"Banded--\" The word reached Dalgard. Sssuri had been cool enough to\nnote that while the human hunter had been only bewildered by the\nuntypical actions of his quarry.\n\n\"It must be intelligent.\" The scout's statement was more than half\nprotest.\n\n\"Where _they_ are concerned, one may expect many evil wonders.\"\n\n\"We've got to get that devil!\" Dalgard was determined on that. Though\nto run down, through this maze of deserted city, an enraged\nsnake-devil--above all, a snake-devil which appeared to have some\nreasoning powers--was not a prospect to arouse any emotion except grim\ndevotion to duty.\n\n\"It goes for help.\"\n\nDalgard, startled, stared at his companion. Sssuri was still by the\ngrille, watching that archway through which the devil had disappeared.\n\n\"What kind of help?\" For a moment Dalgard pictured the monster\nreturning at the head of a regiment of its kind, able to tear out this\ngrille and get at their soft-fleshed enemies behind it.\n\n\"Safety--protection,\" Sssuri told him. \"And I think that the place to\nwhich it now flees is one we should know.\"\n\n\"Those Others?\" The sun had not clouded, it still streamed down in the\ntorrid heat of early afternoon, warm on their heads and shoulders. Yet\nDalgard felt as chill as if some autumn wind had laid its lash across\nthe small of his back.\n\n\"_They_ are not here. But they have been--and it is possible that they\nreturn. The devil goes to where it expects to find them.\"\n\nSssuri was already on his way, running about the arena's curve to\nreach the point above the archway through which the snake-devil had\nraced. Dalgard padded after him, bow in hand. He trusted Sssuri\nimplicitly when it came to tracking. If the merman said that the\nsnake-devil had a definite goal in view, he was right. But the scout\nwas still a little bemused by a monster who was able to have any goal\nexcept the hunting and devouring of meat. Either the one who fled was\na freak among its kind or--There were several possibilities which\ncould answer that \"or,\" and none of them were very pleasant to\nconsider.\n\nThey reached the section above the archway and climbed the tiers of\nseat benches to the top of the wall. Only to see no exit below them.\nIn fact nothing but a wide sweep of crushed brown tangle which had\nonce been vegetation. It was apparent that there was no door below.\n\nSssuri sped down again. He climbed the grille and was on his way to\nthe sand when Dalgard caught up with him. Together they ventured into\nthe underground passage which the snake-devil had chosen.\n\nThe stench of the lair was thick about them. Dalgard coughed, sickened\nby the foul odor. He was reluctant to advance. But, to his growing\nrelief, he discovered that it was not entirely dark. Set in the roof\nat intervals were plates which gave out a violet light, making a dim\ntwilight which was better than total darkness.\n\nIt was a straight passage without any turns or openings. But the\nhorrible odor was constant, and Dalgard began to think that they might\nbe running head-on into another lair, perhaps one as well populated as\nthat they had left behind them. It was against nature for the\nsnake-devils he had known to lair under cover; they preferred narrow\nrocky places where they could bask in the sun. But then the devil they\nnow pursued was no ordinary one.\n\nSssuri reassured him. \"There is no lair, only the smell because they\nhave come this way for many years.\"\n\nThe passage opened into a wide room and here the violet light was\nstronger, bright enough to make plain the fact that alcoves opened off\nit, each and every one with a barred grille for a door. There was no\nmistaking that once this had been a prison of sorts.\n\nSssuri did no exploring but crossed the room at his shuffling trot,\nwhich Dalgard matched. The way leading out on the opposite side\nslanted up, and he judged it might bring them out at ground level.\n\n\"The devil waits,\" Sssuri warned, \"because it fears. It will turn on\nus when we come. Be ready--\"\n\nThey were at another door, and before them was a long corridor with\ntall window openings near the ceiling which gave admittance to the\nsunlight. After the gloom of the tunnel, Dalgard blinked. But he was\naware of movement at the far end, just as he heard the hissing scream\nof the monster they trailed.\n\n\n\n\n6\n\nTREASURE HUNT\n\n\nRaf, squatting on a small, padded platform raised some six inches from\nthe floor, tried to study the inhabitants of the room without staring\noffensively. At the first glance, in spite of their strange clothing\nand their odd habit of painting their faces with weird designs, the\ncity people might have been of his own species. Until one saw their\ntoo slender hands with the three equal-length fingers and thumb, or\ncaught a glimpse, under the elaborate head coverings, of the stiff,\nspiky substance which served them for hair.\n\nAt least they did not appear to be antagonistic. When they had reached\nthe roof top where the Terrans had landed their flitter, they had come\nwith empty hands, making gestures of good will and welcome. And they\nhad had no difficulty in persuading at least three of the exploring\nparty to accompany them to their own quarters, though Raf had been\nseparated from the flyer only by the direct order of Captain Hobart,\nan order he still resented and wanted to disobey.\n\nThe Terrans had been offered refreshment--food and drink. But knowing\nthe first rule of stellar exploration, they had refused, which did not\nmean that the hosts must abstain. In fact, Raf thought, watching the\naliens about him, they ate as if such a feast were novel. His two\nneighbors had quickly divided his portion between them and made it\ndisappear as fast, if not faster, than their own small servings.\n\nAt the other end of the room Lablet and Hobart were trying to\ncommunicate with the nobles about them, while Soriki, a small palm\nrecorder in his hand, was making a tape strip of the proceedings.\n\nRaf glanced from one of his neighbors to the other. The one on his\nright had chosen to wear a sight-torturing shade of crimson, and the\nmaterial was wound in strips about his body as if he were engulfed in\nan endless bandage. Only his fluttering hands, his three-toed feet and\nhis head were free of the supple rolls. Having selected red for his\nclothing, he had picked a brilliant yellow paint for his facial\nmakeup, and it was difficult for the uninitiated to trace what must be\nhis normal features under that thick coating of stuff which fashioned\na masklike strip across his eyes and a series of circles outlining his\nmouth, circles which almost completely covered his beardless cheeks.\nMore twists of woven fabric, opalescent and changing color as his head\nmoved, made a turban for his head.\n\nMost of the aliens about the room wore some variation of the same\nbandage dress, face paint, and turban. An exception, one of three\nsuch, was the feaster on Raf's left.\n\nHis face paint was confined to a conservative set of bars on each\ncheek, those a stark black and white. His sinewy arms were bare to the\nshoulder, and he wore a shell of some metallic substance as a\nbreast-and back-plate, not unlike the very ancient body armor of Raf's\nown world. The rest of his body was covered by the bandage strips, but\nthey were of a dead black, which, because of the natural thinness of\nhis limbs, gave him a rather unpleasant resemblance to a spider.\nVarious sheaths and pockets hung from a belt pulled tight about his\nwasp middle, and a helmet of the metal covered his head. Soldier? Raf\nwas sure that his guess was correct.\n\nThe officer, if officer he was, caught Raf's gaze. His small round\nmouth gaped, and then his hands, with a few quick movements which Raf\nfollowed, fascinated, pantomimed a flyer in the air. With those\ntalking fingers, he was able to make plain a question: was Raf the\npilot of the flitter?\n\nThe pilot nodded. Then he pointed to the officer and forced as\ninquiring an expression as he could command.\n\nThe answer was sketched quickly and readably: the alien, too, was\neither a pilot or had some authority over flyers. For the first time\nsince he had entered this building, Raf knew a slight degree of\nrelaxation.\n\nThe wrinkleless, too smooth skin of the alien was a darkish yellow.\nHis painted face was a mask to frighten any sensible Terran child; his\ngeneral appearance was not attractive. But he was a flyer, and he\nwanted to talk shop, as well as they could with no common speech.\nSince the scarlet-wound nobleman on Raf's right was completely\nengrossed in the feast, pursuing a few scraps avidly about the dish,\nthe Terran gave all his attention to the officer.\n\nTwittering words poured in a stream from the warrior's lips. Raf shook\nhis head regretfully, and the other jerked his shoulders in almost\nhuman impatience. Somehow that heartened Raf.\n\nWith many guesses to cover gaps, probably more than half of which were\nwrong, Raf gathered that the officer was one of a very few who still\nretained the almost forgotten knowledge of how to pilot the remaining\nairworthy craft in this crumbling city. On their way to the building\nwith the curved roof, Raf had noted the evidences that the inhabitants\nof this metropolis could not be reckoned as more than a handful and\nthat most of these now lived either within the central building or\nclose to it. A pitiful collection of survivors lingering on in the\nruins of their past greatness.\n\nYet he was impressed now by no feeling that the officer, eagerly\ntrying to make contact, was a degenerate member of a dying race. In\nfact, as Raf glanced at the aliens about the room, he was conscious of\nan alertness, of a suppressed energy which suggested a young and\nvigorous people.\n\nThe officer was now urging him to go some place, and Raf, his dislike\nfor being in the heart of the strangers' territory once more aroused,\nwas about to shake his head in a firm negative when a second idea\nstopped him. He had resisted separation from the flitter. Perhaps he\ncould persuade the alien, under the excuse of inspecting a strange\nmachine, to take him back to the flyer. Once there he would stay. He\ndid not know what Captain Hobart and Lablet thought they could\naccomplish here. But, as for himself, Raf was sure that he was not\ngoing to feel easy again until he was across the northern mountain\nchain and coming in for a landing close by the _RS 10_.\n\nIt was as if the alien officer had read his thoughts, for the warrior\nuncrossed his black legs and got nimbly to his feet with a lithe\nmovement, which Raf, cramped by sitting in the unfamiliar posture,\ncould not emulate. No one appeared to notice their withdrawal. And\nwhen Raf hesitated, trying to catch Hobart's eye and make some\nexplanation, the alien touched his arm lightly and motioned toward one\nof the curtained doorways. Conscious that he could not withdraw from\nthe venture now, Raf reluctantly went out.\n\nThey were in a hall where bold bands of color interwove in patterns\nimpossible for Terran eyes to study. Raf lowered his gaze hurriedly to\nthe gray floor under his boots. He had discovered earlier that to try\nto trace any thread of that wild splashing did weird things to his\neyesight and awakened inside him a sick panic. His space boots, with\nthe metal, magnetic plates set in the soles, clicked loudly on the\npavement where his companion's bare feet made no whisper of sound.\n\nThe hall gave upon a ramp leading down, and Raf recognized this. His\nconfidence arose. They were on their way out of the building. Here the\nmurals were missing so that he could look about him for reference\npoints.\n\nHe was sure that the banquet hall was some ten stories above street\nlevel. But they did not go down ten ramps now. At the foot of the\nthird the officer turned abruptly to the left, beckoning Raf along.\nWhen the Terran remained stubbornly where he was, pointing in the\ndirection which, to him, meant return to the flitter, the other made\ngestures describing an aircraft in flight. His own probably.\n\nRaf sighed. He could see no way out unless he cut and ran. And long\nbefore he reached the street from this warren they could pick him up.\nAlso, in spite of all the precautions he had taken to memorize their\nway here, he was not sure he could find his path back to the flyer,\neven if he were free to go. Giving in, he went after the officer.\n\nTheir way led out on one of the spider-web bridges which tied building\nand tower into the complicated web which was the city. Raf, as a pilot\nof flitter, had always believed that he had no fear of heights. But he\ndiscovered that to coast above the ground in a flyer was far different\nthan to hurry at the pace his companion now set across one of these\nnarrow bridges suspended high above the street. And he was sure that\nthe surface under them vibrated as if the slightest extra poundage\nwould separate it from its supports and send it, and them, crashing\ndown.\n\nLuckily the distance they had to cover was relatively short, but Raf\nswallowed a sigh of relief as they reached the door at the other end.\nThey were now in a tower which, unluckily, proved to be only a way\nstation before another swing out over empty space on a span which\nsloped down! Raf clutched at the guide rail, the presence of which\nsuggested that not all the users of this road were as nonchalant as\nthe officer who tripped lightly ahead. This must explain the other's\nbare feet--on such paths they were infinitely safer than his own\nboots.\n\nThe downward sloping bridge brought them to a square building which\nsomehow had an inhabited look which those crowding around it lacked.\nRaf gained its door to become aware of a hum, a vibration in the wall\nhe touched to steady himself, hinting at the drive of motors, the\nthrob of machinery inside the structure. But within, the officer\npassed along a corridor to a ramp which brought them out, after what\nwas for Raf a steep climb, upon the roof. Here was not one of the\ntongue-shaped craft such as had first met them in the city, but a\ngleaming globe. The officer stopped, his eyes moving from the Terran\nto the machine, as if inviting Raf to share in his own pride. To the\npilot's mind it bore little resemblance to any form of aircraft past\nor present with which he had had experience in his own world. But he\ndid not doubt that it was the present acme of alien construction, and\nhe was eager to see it perform.\n\nHe followed the officer through a hatch at the bottom of the globe,\nonly to be confronted by a ladder he thought at first he could not\nclimb, for the steps were merely toe holds made to accommodate the\nlong, bare feet of the crew. By snapping on the magnetic power of his\nspace boots, Raf was able to get up, although at a far slower speed\nthan his guide. They passed several levels of cabins before coming\nout in what was clearly the control cabin of the craft.\n\nTo Raf the bank of unfamiliar levers and buttons had no meaning, but\nhe paid strict attention to the gestures of his companion. This was\nnot a space ship he gathered. And he doubted whether the aliens had\never lifted from their own planet to their neighbors in this solar\nsystem. But it was a long-range ship with greater cruising power than\nthe other flyer he had seen. And it was being readied now for a voyage\nof some length.\n\nThe Terran pilot squatted down on the small stool before the controls.\nBefore him a visa plate provided a clear view of the sky without and\nthe gathering clouds of evening. Raf shifted uncomfortably. That\nsignal of the passing of time triggered his impatience to be\naway--back to the _RS 10_. He did not want to spend the night in this\ncity. Somehow he must get the officer to take him back to the\nflitter--to be there would be better than shut up in one of the alien\ndwellings.\n\nMeanwhile he studied the scene on the visa plate, trying to find the\nroof on which they had left the flitter. But there was no point he was\nable to recognize.\n\nRaf turned to the officer and tried to make clear the idea of\nreturning to his own ship. Either he was not as clever at the sign\nlanguage as the other, or the alien did not wish to understand. For\nwhen they left the control cabin, it was only to make an inspection\ntour of the other parts of the globe, including the space which held\nthe motors of the craft and which, at another time, would have kept\nRaf fascinated for hours.\n\nIn the end the Terran broke away and climbed down the thread of ladder\nto stand on the roof under the twilight sky. Slowly he walked about\nthe broad expanse of the platform, attempting to pick out some\nlandmark. The central building of the city loomed high, and there were\nany number of towers about it. But which was the one that guarded the\nroof where the flitter rested? Raf's determination to get back to his\nship was a driving force.\n\nThe alien officer had watched him, and now a three-fingered hand was\nlaid on Raf's sleeve while its owner looked into Raf's face and\nmouthed a trilling question.\n\nWithout much hope the pilot sketched the set of gestures he had used\nbefore. And he was surprised when the other led the way down into the\nbuilding. This time they did not go back to the bridge, which had\nbrought them across the canyons of streets, but kept on down ramps\nwithin the building.\n\nThere was a hum of activity in the place. Aliens, all in tight black\nwrappings and burnished metal breastplates, their faces barred with\nblack and white paint, went on errands through the halls or labored at\ntasks Raf could not understand. It now seemed as if his guide were\neager to get him away.\n\nIt was when they reached the street level that the officer did pause\nby one door, beckoning Raf imperiously to join him. The Terran obeyed\nreluctantly--and was almost sick.\n\nHe was staring down at a dead, very dead body. By the stained rags\nstill clinging to it, it was one of the aliens, a noble, not one of\nthe black-clad warriors. The gaping wounds which had almost torn the\nunfortunate apart were like nothing Raf had ever seen.\n\nWith a guttural sound which expressed his feelings as well as any\nwords, the officer picked up from the floor a broken spear, the barbed\nhead of which was dyed the same reddish yellow as the blood still\nseeping from the torn body. Swinging the weapon so close to Raf that\nthe Terran was forced to retreat a step or two to escape contact with\nthe grisly relic, the officer burst into an impassioned speech. Then\nhe went back to the gestures which were easier for the spaceman to\nunderstand.\n\nThis was the work of a deadly enemy, Raf gathered. And such a fate\nawaited any one of them who ventured beyond certain bounds of safety.\nUnless this enemy were destroyed, the city--life itself--was no\nlonger theirs--\n\nSeeing those savage wounds which suggested that an insane fury had\ndriven the attacker, Raf could believe that. But surely a primitive\nspear was no equal to the weapons his guide could command.\n\nWhen he tried to suggest that, the other shook his head as if\ndespairing of making plain his real message, and again beckoned Raf to\ncome with him. They were out on the littered street, heading away from\nthe central building where the rest of the Terran party must still be.\nAnd Raf, seeing the lengthening shadows, the pools of dusk gathering,\nand remembering that spear, could not resist glancing back over his\nshoulder now and then. He wondered if the metallic click of his boot\nsoles on the pavement might not draw attention to them, attention they\nwould not care to meet. His hand was on his stun gun. But the officer\ngave no sign of being worried; he walked along with the assurance of\none who has nothing to fear.\n\nThen Raf caught sight of a patch of color he had seen before and\nrelaxed. They _were_ on their way back to the flitter! He had come\ndown this very street earlier. And he did not mind the long climb\nback, ramp by steep ramp, which brought him out at last beside the\nflyer. His relief was so great that he put out his hand to draw it\nalong the sleek side of the craft as he might have caressed a\nwell-loved pet.\n\n\"Kurbi?\"\n\nAt Hobart's bark he stiffened. \"Yes, sir!\"\n\n\"We camp here tonight. Have to make some plans.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\" He agreed with that. To attempt passage of the mountains\nin the dark was a suicide mission which he would have refused. On the\nother hand, to his mind, they would sleep more soundly if they were\nout of the city. He speculated whether he dared suggest that they use\nthe few remaining moments of twilight to head into the open and\nestablish a camp somewhere in the countryside.\n\nThe alien officer made some comment in his slurred speech and faded\naway into the shadows. Raf saw that the others had already dragged out\ntheir blanket rolls and were spreading them in the shelter of the\nflitter while Soriki busied himself at the com, sending back a message\nto the _RS 10_.\n\n\"... should not be too difficult to establish a common speech form,\"\nLablet was saying as Raf climbed into the flitter to tug loose his own\nroll. \"Color and pitch both seem to carry meaning. But the basic\npattern is there to study. And with the scanner to sort out those\nrecord strips--did you adjust them, Soriki?\"\n\n\"They're all ready for you to push the button. If the scanner can read\nthem, it will. I got all that speech the chief, or king, or whatever\nhe was, made just before we left.\"\n\n\"Good, very good!\" In the light of the portable lamp by Soriki's com,\nLablet settled down, plugged the scanner tubes in his ears, absently\naccepting a ration bar the captain handed him to chew on while he\nlistened to the playback of the record the com-tech had made that\nafternoon.\n\nHobart turned to Raf. \"You went off with that officer. What did he\nhave to show you?\"\n\nThe pilot described the globe and the body he had been shown and then\nadded what he had deduced from the sketchy explanations he had been\ngiven. The captain nodded.\n\n\"Yes, they have aircraft, have been using them, too. But I think that\nthere's only one of the big ones. And they're fighting a war all\nright. We didn't see the whole colony, but I'll wager that there are\nonly a handful of them left. They're holed up here, and they need help\nor the barbarians will finish them off. They talked a lot about that.\"\n\nLablet pulled the ear plugs from his ears. In the lamplight there was\nan excited expression on his face. \"You were entirely right, Captain!\nThey were offering us a bargain there at the last! They are offering\nus the accumulated scientific knowledge of this world!\"\n\n\"What?\" Hobart sounded bewildered.\n\n\"Over there\"--Lablet made a sweep with his arm which might indicate\nany point to the east--\"there is a storehouse of the original learning\nof their race. It's in the heart of the enemy country. But the enemy\nas yet do not know of it. They've made two trips over to bring back\nmaterial and their ship can only go once more. They offer us an equal\nshare if we'll make the next trip in their company and help them clean\nout the storage place--\"\n\nHobart's answer was a whistle. There was an avid hunger on Lablet's\nlean face. No more potent bribe could have been devised to entice him.\nBut Raf, remembering the spear-torn body, wondered.\n\n_In the heart of the enemy country_, he repeated to himself.\n\nLablet added another piece of information. \"After all, the enemy they\nface is only dangerous because of superior numbers. They are only\nanimals--\"\n\n\"Animals don't carry spears!\" Raf protested.\n\n\"Experimental animals that escaped during a world-wide war generations\nago,\" reported the other. \"It seems that the species have evolved to a\nsemi-intelligent level. I must see them!\"\n\nHobart was not to be hurried. \"We'll think it over,\" he decided. \"This\nneeds a little time for consideration.\"\n\n\n\n\n7\n\nMANY EYES, MANY EARS\n\n\nThis was not the first time Dalgard had faced the raging fury of a\nsnake-devil thirsting for a kill. The slaying he had done in the arena\nwas an exception to the rule, not the usual hunter's luck. And now\nthat he saw the creature crouched at the far end of the hall he was\nready. Sssuri, also, followed their familiar pattern, separating from\nhis companion and slipping along the wall toward the monster, ready to\nattract its attention at the proper moment.\n\nOnly one doubt remained in Dalgard's mind. This devil had not acted in\nthe normal brainless fashion of its kin. What if it was able to assess\nthe very simple maneuvers, which always before had completely baffled\nits species, and attacked not the moving merman but the waiting\narcher?\n\nIt was backed against another door, a closed one, as if it had fled\nfor refuge to some aid it had expected and did not find. But as Sssuri\nmoved, its long neck straightened until it was almost at right angles\nwith its narrow shoulders, and from its snake's jaws proceeded a\nhorrific hissing which arose to a scream as its leg muscles tensed for\na spring.\n\nAt just the right moment Sssuri's arm went back, his spear sang\nthrough the air. And the snake-devil, with an incredible twist of its\nneck, caught the haft of the weapon between its teeth, crunching the\niron-hard substance into powder. But with that move it exposed its\nthroat, and the arrow from Dalgard's bow was buried head-deep in the\nsoft inner flesh.\n\nThe snake-devil spat out the spear and tried to raise its head. But\nthe muscles were already weakening. It fought the poison long enough\nto take a single step forward, its small red eyes alight with\nbrainless hate. Then it crashed and lay twisting. Dalgard lowered his\nbow. There was no need for a second shot.\n\nSssuri regarded the remains of his spear unhappily. Not only was it\nthe product of long hours of work, but no merman ever felt fully\nequipped to face the world without such a weapon to hand. He salvaged\nthe barbed head and broke it free of the shred of haft the snake-devil\nhad left. Knotting it at his belt he turned to Dalgard.\n\n\"Shall we see what lies beyond?\"\n\nDalgard crossed the hall to test the door. It did not yield to an\ninward push, but rolled far enough into the wall to allow them\nthrough.\n\nOn the other side was a room which amazed the scout. The colonists had\ntheir laboratory, their workshops, in which they experimented and\ntried to preserve the remnants of knowledge their forefathers had\nbrought across space, as well as to discover new. But the extent of\nthis storehouse with its bewildering mass of odd machines, tanks,\nbales, and stocked shelves and tables, was too much to be taken in\nwithout a careful and minute examination.\n\n\"We are not the first to walk here.\" Sssuri had given little attention\nto what was stacked about him. Instead he bent over the disturbed dust\nin one aisle. Dalgard noted as he went to join the merman that there\nwere gaps on those tables which ran the full length of the room, lines\nleft in the grimy deposit of years which told of things recently\nmoved. And then he saw what had interested Sssuri: tracks, some\nresembling those which his own bare feet might leave, except that\nthere were only three toes!\n\n\"_They._\"\n\nDalgard who had been a hunter and a tracker before he was an explorer\ncrouched for a clearer view. Yes, they were recent, yet not made today\nor even yesterday; there was a thin film of dust resettled in each.\n\n\"Some days ago. They are not in the city now,\" the merman declared\nwith certainty. \"But they will come again.\"\n\n\"How do you know that?\"\n\nSssuri's hand swept about to include the wealth around them. \"They\nhave taken some, perhaps to them the most needful. But they will not\nbe able to resist gathering the rest. Surely they will return, perhaps\nnot once but many times. Until--\"\n\n\"Until they come to stay.\" Dalgard was grim as he completed that\nsentence for the other.\n\n\"That is what they will work for. This land was once under their\nmastery. This world was theirs before they threw it away warring among\nthemselves. Yes, they dream of holding all once more. But\"--Sssuri's\nyellow eyes took on some of the fire which had shone in those of the\nsnake-devil during its last seconds of life--\"that must not be so!\"\n\n\"If they take the land, you have the sea,\" Dalgard pointed out. The\nmermen had a means of escape. But what of his own clansmen? Large\nfamilies were unknown among the Terran colonists. In the little more\nthan a century they had been on this planet their numbers, from the\nforty-five survivors of the voyage, had grown to only some two hundred\nand fifty, of which only a hundred and twenty were old enough or young\nenough to fight. And for them there was no retreat or hiding place.\n\n\"We do not go bask to the depths!\" There was stern determination in\nthat declaration from Sssuri. His tribe had been long hunted, and it\nwasn't until they had made a loose alliance with the Terran colonists\nthat they had dared to leave the dangerous ocean depths, where they\nwere the prey of monsters more ferocious and cunning than any\nsnake-devil, to house their families in the coast caves and on the\nsmall islands off-shore, to increase in numbers and develop new skills\nof civilization. No, knowing the stubbornness which was bred into\ntheir small, furry bodies, Dalgard did not believe that many of the\nsea people would willingly go back into the sunless depths. They would\nnot surrender tamely to the rulership of the loathed race.\n\n\"I don't see,\" Dalgard spoke aloud, half to himself, as he studied the\ntables closely packed, the machines standing on bases about the walls,\nthe wealth of alien technology, \"what we can do to stop them.\"\n\nThe restriction drilled into him from early childhood, that the\nknowledge of Those Others was not for his race and in some way\ndangerous, gave him an uneasy feeling of guilt just to be standing\nthere. Danger, danger which was far worse than physical, lurked\nthere. And he could bring it to life by merely putting out his hand\nand picking up any one of those fascinating objects which lay only\ninches away. For the pull of curiosity was warring inside him against\nthe stern warnings of his Elders.\n\nOnce when Dalgard had been very small he had raided his father's trip\nbag after the next to the last exploring journey the elder Nordis had\nmade. And he had found a clear block of some kind of greenish crystal,\nin the heart of which threadlike lines of color wove patterns which\nwere utterly strange. When he had turned the block in his hand, those\nlines had whirled and changed to form new and intricate designs. And\nwhen he had watched them intently it had seemed that something\nhappened inside his mind and he knew, here and there, a word, a\nfragment of alien thought--just as he normally communicated with the\ncub who was Sssuri or the hoppers of the field. And his surprise had\nbeen so great that he had gone running to his father with the cube and\nthe story of what happened when one watched it.\n\nBut there had been no praise for his discovery. Instead he had been\nhurried off to the chamber where an old, old man, the son of the Great\nMan who had planned to bring them across space, lay in his bed. And\nForken Kordov himself had talked to Dalgard in his old voice, a voice\nas withered and thin as the hands crossed helplessly on his shrunken\nbody, explaining in simple, kindly words that the knowledge which lay\nin the cubes, in the oddly shaped books which the Terrans sometimes\ncame across in the ruins, was not for them. That his own\ngreat-grandfather Dard Nordis, who had been one of the first of the\nmutant line of sensitives, had discovered that. And Dalgard, impressed\nby Forken, by his father's concern, and by all the circumstances of\nthat day, had never forgotten nor lost that warning.\n\n\"_We_ cannot hope to stop them,\" Sssuri pointed out. \"But we must\nlearn when they will come again and be waiting for them--with your\npeople and mine. For I tell you now, brother of the knife, they must\nnot be allowed to rise once more!\"\n\n\"And how can we foretell their coming?\" Dalgard wanted to know.\n\n\"Perhaps that alone we cannot do. But when they come they will not\nleave speedily. They have stayed here before without harm, and their\ndistrust has been lulled. When next they come, it will be only\naccording to their natures that they will wish to stay longer. Not\nsnatching up the closest to hand of these treasures of theirs, but\nchoosing out with care those things which will give them the best\nresults. Therefore they may make a camp, and we can summon others to\naid us.\"\n\n\"To return to Homeport will take several days even if we push,\"\npointed out the scout.\n\n\"Word can pass swifter than man,\" the merman returned, with confidence\nin his own plan of action. \"We shall put other eyes, other ears, many\neyes, many ears, to service for us. Be assured we are not the only\nones to fear the return of Those Others from overseas.\"\n\nDalgard caught his meaning. Yes, it would not be the first time the\nhoppers and other small animals living in the grasslands, the runners\nand even the moth birds that only the mermen could mind touch, would\nrelay a message across the land. It might not be an accurate\nmessage--to transmit that by small animal brains was impossible--but\nthe meaning would reach both merman and colony Elders: trouble in the\nnorth, help needed there. And since Dalgard was the only explorer at\npresent who had chosen the northern trails, his people would know that\nhe had sent that warning and would act upon it, as Sssuri's message\nwould in turn be heeded by the warriors of his tribe.\n\nYes, it could be done. But what of the traces they had left here--the\nslaughtered snake-devils--?\n\nSssuri had an answer for that also. \"Let them believe that one of my\nrace came here, or that a party of us ventured to explore inland. We\ncan make it appear that way. But they must not know of you. I do not\nbelieve that they ever learned of you or how your fathers came from\nthe sky. And so that may swing the battle in our favor if it comes to\nopen warfare.\"\n\nWhat the merman said was sensible enough, and Dalgard was willing to\nobey orders. As he left the storehouse, Sssuri trailed him, scuffing\neach dusty print the scout left. Perhaps a master of trailcraft could\nunravel that spoor, but the colonist was ready to believe that no such\nmaster existed in the ranks of Those Others.\n\nIn the outer hall the merman approached the now dead snake-devil and\njerked from its loose skin the arrow which had killed it. Loosing the\nhead of his ruined spear from his belt, he dug and gouged at the small\nwound, tearing it so that its original nature was concealed forever.\nThen they retraced their way through the underground passages until\nthey reached the sanded arena. Already insects buzzed hungrily about\nthe hulks of the dead monsters.\n\nThere was a shrill squeal as the remaining infant reptile fled from\nthe pouch where it had hidden. Sssuri hurled his knife, and the blade\ncaught the small devil above the shoulder line, half cutting, half\nsnapping its tender neck, so that it bounded aimlessly on to crash\nagainst the wall and fall back squirming feebly.\n\nThey collected the darts which had killed the others. Dalgard took the\nopportunity to study those bands on the forearms of the adults. To his\ntouch they had the slick smoothness of metal, yet he was unfamiliar\nwith the material. It possessed the ruddy fire of copper, but through\nit ran small black veins. He would have liked to have taken one with\nhim for investigation, but it was out of the question to pry it off\nthat scaled limb.\n\nSssuri straightened up from his last gruesome bit of stage-setting\nwith a sigh of relief. \"Go ahead.\" He pointed to one of the other\narchways. \"I will confuse the trail.\"\n\nDalgard obeyed, treading as lightly as he could, avoiding all\nstretches in which he could leave a clear print. Sssuri ran lightly\nback and forth mixing the few impressions to the best of his ability.\n\nThey backtracked to the river, retrieved the boat and recrossed, to\nleave the city behind and strike into the open country beyond its\nsinister walls. Night was falling, and Dalgard was very glad that he\nwas not to spend the time of darkness within those haunted buildings.\nBut he knew that it was more than a dislike for being shut up in the\nalien dwellings which had brought Sssuri out into the fields. The\nsecond part of their plan must be put into operation.\n\nWhile Dalgard willed his body motionless, the merman lay relaxed upon\nthe ground before him as he might have floated upon his beloved waves\nin some secluded cove. His brilliant eyes were closed. Yet Dalgard\nknew that Sssuri was far from asleep, and with all his own power he\ntried to join in the broadcast: that urgency which should send some\nhopper, some night runner, on to spread the rumor that there was\ntrouble in the north, that danger existed and must be investigated.\nThey had already met one colony of runners ranging southward to\nescape. But if they could send another such tribe traveling, arouse\nand aim south a hopper exodus, the story would spread until the fringe\nwould reach the animals who lived in peace within touch of Homeport.\n\nThe sun was gone, the dark gathered fast. Dalgard could not even see\nthe clustered buildings of the city now. And since he lacked Sssuri's\nrange and staying power, he had no idea whether their efforts had met\nwith even a shadow of success. He shivered in the bite of the wind and\ndared to lay his hand on Sssuri's shoulder, feeling anew the electric\nshock of warmth and bursting life which was always there.\n\nHaving so broken the other's absorption he asked a question: \"Would it\nnot be well, brother of the knife, if with the rising sun you returned\nto the sea and struck out to join your tribesmen, leaving me here to\nwatch until you return?\"\n\nSssuri's answer came with a speed which suggested that he, too, had\nbeen considering that problem. \"We shall see what happens with the\nsun's rising. It is true that in the sea I can travel with greater\nspeed, that there are hunting parties of my people striking into these\nwaters. But they will not come to this city without good reason. It is\nan accursed place.\"\n\nWith the early morning the city drew them once more. Dalgard's\ncuriosity pulled him to that storehouse. He could not stifle the hope\nthat with luck he might find something there which would solve their\nproblem for them. If there could only be a way to avoid open conflict\nwith Those Others, some solution whereby the aliens need never know of\nthe existence of the Colony. For so many generations, even centuries,\nthe aliens had been confined, or had confined themselves, safely\noverseas on the western continent. Perhaps if now they were faced by\nsome new catastrophe, they would never attempt to come east again. He\nhad visions of discovering and activating some trap set to protect\ntheir treasures which could be turned against them. But he realized\nthat he lacked the technical knowledge which would have aided him in\nthe search for such a weapon.\n\nThe remnants of Terran science and mechanics, which the outlaws had\nbrought with them from their native world, had been handed on; the\nexperiments they had managed since with crude equipment had been\ncarefully recorded, and he was acquainted with the outlines of most of\nthem. But the few destructive arms they had imported were long since\nworn out or lacked charges, and they had not been able to duplicate\nthem. Just as they had torn asunder the ship in which they had crossed\nspace, to use its parts for the building of Homeport, so had they\nhoarded all else they had brought. But they were limited by lack of\nmaterials on Astra, and their fear of the knowledge of the aliens had\nkept them from experimenting with things found in the ruins.\n\nThere might be hundreds of objects on the shelves of that storage\nplace, which, properly used, would reduce not only just the room and\nits contents to glowing slag, but take half the city with it. But he\nhad no idea which, or which combination, would do it.\n\nAnd here Sssuri could be no help. The mermen had made great strides\nforward in biological and mental sciences, but mechanics was a closed\nsection of learning because of their enforced habitat under the sea,\nand of machines they knew less than the colonists.\n\n\"I have been thinking--\" Sssuri broke into his companion's chain of\nreasoning, \"of what we may do. And perhaps there is a way to reach the\nsea more swiftly than by returning overland.\"\n\n\"Downriver? But you said that way may have its watching devices.\"\n\n\"Which would be centered on objects coming upstream, not down. But in\nthis city there should be yet another way--\"\n\nHe did not enlarge upon that, but since he apparently knew what he was\ndoing, Dalgard let him play guide once more. They recrossed the\nsluggish river, the scout looking into its murky depths with little\nrelish for it as a means of transportation. Though it had an oily,\nflowing current, there was a suggestion of stagnant water with\nunpleasant surprises waiting beneath its turgid surface.\n\nFor the second time they entered the arena. Avoiding the bodies,\nSssuri made a circuit of the sanded floor. He did not turn in at the\narchway which led to the storage place, but paused before another as\nif there lay what he had been searching for.\n\nDalgard's less sensitive nostrils picked up a new scent, the\nnot-to-be-missed fetor of damp underground ways where water stood.\nThe merman edged around a barred gate as Dalgard sniffed again. The\nsmell of damp was crossed by other and even less appetizing odors, but\nhe did not catch the stench of the snake-devils. And, relying on\nSssuri's judgment, he followed the merman into the dark.\n\nOnce again patches of violet light glimmered over their heads as the\npassage narrowed and sloped downward. Dalgard tried to remember the\ngeneral geography of the section which was above them now. He had\nassumed that this way with its dank chill must give on the river. But\nwhen they had pattered on for a long distance, he knew that either\nthey had passed beneath the stream or that he was totally lost as to\ndirection.\n\nAs their eyes adjusted to the gloom of the passage the violet light\ngrew stronger. So Dalgard saw clearly when Sssuri whirled and faced\nback along the way they had come, his body in a half crouch, his knife\nready in his hand.\n\nDalgard, his bow useless in the damp, drew his own sword-knife. But,\nthough his mind probed and he listened, he could sense or hear nothing\non their trail.\n\n\n\n\n8\n\nAIRLIFT\n\n\nThey were air-borne once more, but Raf was not pleased. In the seat\nbeside him, which Captain Hobart should be occupying, there now\nsquirmed an alien warrior who apparently was uncomfortable in the\nchair-like depression so different from the low stools he was\naccustomed to. Soriki was still in the second passenger place, but he,\ntoo, shared that with another of the men from the city who rested\nacross bony knees a strange weapon rather like a Terran rifle.\n\nNo, the spacemen were not prisoners. According to the official\nstatement they were allies. But, Raf wondered, as against his will he\nfollowed the globe in a northeastern course, how long would that\nfiction last if they refused to fall in with any suggestions the\naliens might make? He did not doubt that there was on board the globe\nsome surprise which could shoot the flitter out of the air, if, for\nexample, he adjusted the controls before him and bore west toward the\nmountains and the safety of the space ship. Either of the aliens he\nnow transported could bring him under control by using those weapons,\nwhich might do anything from boiling a man in some unknown ray to\nsmothering him in gas. He had not seen the arms in action, and he did\nnot want to.\n\nYet Hobart and Lablet did not, as far as he could tell, share his\nsuspicions. Lablet was eager to see the mysterious storehouse, and the\ncaptain was either moved by the same desire or else had long since\ndeduced the folly of trying to make a break for it Thus they were now\nheading seaward with the captain and Lablet sharing quarters with the\nleaders of the expedition on board the globe, and Raf and the\ncom-tech, with companions--or guards--bringing up the rear. The aliens\nhad even insisted on stripping the flitter of much of its Terran\nequipment before they left the city, pointing out that the cleared\nstorage space would be filled with salvage when they made the return\nvoyage.\n\nThe globe had been trailing along the coastline, and now it angled out\nto glide over a long finger of cape, rocky and waterworn, which\npointed at almost a right angle into the sea. This dwindled into a\nreef of rock, like the nail on a finger. The sea ahead was no unbroken\nexpanse. Instead there was a series of islands, some merely tops of\nreefs over which the waves broke, others more substantial, rising well\nabove the threatening water, and one or two showing the green of\nvegetation.\n\nThe chain of islets extended so far out that when the flitter passed\nover the last one the main continent was out of sight. Now only water\nstretched beneath them. The globe skidded on as if its pilot had given\nit an extra burst of power, and Raf accelerated in turn, having no\ndesire to lose his guide. But they were not to make the ocean-wide\ntrip in one jump.\n\nAt midday he saw again a break in the smooth carpet of waves, another\nisland, or perhaps the southern tip of a northern continent for the\nland swept in that direction as far as he could see. The globe\nspiraled down to make a neat landing on a flat plateau, and Raf\nprepared to join it. When the undercarriage of the flitter jarred\nlightly on the rock, he saw signs that this was a man-or\nalien-fashioned place which must have had much use in the dim past\nwhen his new companions ruled all their native world.\n\nThe rock had been smoothed off to a flat surface, and at its perimeter\nwere several small domed buildings. Yet, as there had been in the\ncountryside and in the city, except at its very heart, there was an\naura of desertion at the site.\n\nBoth his alien passengers jumped out of the flitter, as if only too\npleased at their release from the Terran flyer. For the first time Raf\nwas shaken out of his own preoccupation with his dislike for the\naliens to wonder if they could be moved by a similar distaste for\nTerrans. Lablet might be interested in that as a scientific\nproblem--the pilot only knew how he felt and that was not comfortable.\n\nSoriki got out and walked across the rock, stretching. But for a long\nmoment Raf remained where he was, behind the controls of the flyer. He\nwas as cramped and tired of travel as the com-tech, perhaps even more\nso since the responsibility of the flight had been his. And had they\nlanded in open country he would have liked to have thrown himself down\non the ground, taking off his helmet and unhooking his tunic collar to\nlet the fresh wind blow through his hair and across his skin. Perhaps\nthat would take away the arid dust of centuries, which, to his mind,\nhad grimed him since their hours in the city. But here was no open\ncountry, only a landing space which reminded him too much of the roof\nof the building in the metropolis.\n\nA half-dozen of the breastplated warriors filed out of the globe and went\nto the nearest dome, returning with heavy boxes. Fuel--supplies--Raf\nshrugged off the problem. The pilot was secretly relieved when Captain\nHobart dropped out of the hatch in the globe and made his way over to the\nflitter.\n\n\"Everything running smoothly?\" he asked with a glance at the two\naliens who were Raf's passengers.\n\n\"Yes, sir. Any idea how much farther--?\" Raf questioned.\n\nHobart shrugged. \"Until we work out basic language difficulties,\" he\nmuttered, \"who knows anything? There is at least one more of these way\nstations. They don't run on atomics, need some kind of fuel, and they\nhave to have new supplies every so often. Their head man can't\nunderstand why it isn't necessary for us to do the same.\"\n\n\"Has he suggested that his techneers want a look at our motors, sir?\"\n\nHobart unbent a little. It was as if in that question he had read\nsomething which pleased him. \"So far we've managed not to understand\nthat. And if anyone tries it on his own, refer him to me--understand?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir!\" Some of the relief in Raf's tone came through, and he saw\nthat the captain was watching him narrowly.\n\n\"You don't like these people, Kurbi?\"\n\nThe pilot replied with the truth. \"I don't feel easy with them, sir.\nNot that they've shown any unfriendliness. Maybe it's because they're\nalien--\"\n\nHe had said the wrong thing and knew it immediately.\n\n\"That sounds like prejudice, Kurbi!\" Hobart's voice carried the snap\nof a reprimand.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Raf said woodenly. That had done it as far as the captain\nwas concerned. The fierce racial and economical prejudices which had\nbeen the keystones of the structure of Pax had left their shadow on\nTerra's thinking. Nowadays a man would better be condemned for murder\nthan for prejudice against another--it was the unforgivable crime. And\nin that unconsidered answer Raf had rendered unreliable in the eyes of\nauthority any future report on the aliens which he might be forced to\nmake.\n\nSilently cursing his lack of judgment, Raf made a careful check of the\nflyer, which might not be necessary but going through the motions of\ndoing his duty gave him some relief. Once the idea struck him of\nclaiming some trouble that would take them back to the spacer for\nrepairs. But Hobart was too good a mechanic himself not to see through\nthat.\n\nThey covered the second stage of their flight by evening, this time\nputting down on an island where, by some ancient and titanic feat of\nlabor, the top had been sheared off a central mountain to make a base.\nA ring of reefs cut off the land from the action of the waves. At once\na party of aliens left the main company and made their way down the\nmountain to prowl along the shore. They made a discovery of sorts, for\nRaf saw them ring in some object they had pulled up on the sand. What\nit was and what meaning it had for them they did not try to explain to\nthe Terrans.\n\nThe party spent the night there, the four spacemen wrapped in their\nsleeping rolls by the flitter, the aliens in their globe ship. The\nTerrans did not miss the fact that the others had unobtrusively posted\nguards at the only two places where the mountain could be climbed. And\neach of those guards cradled in the crook of his arm one of the rifle\nweapons.\n\nThey were aroused shortly after dawn. As far as Raf could see the\nisland was barren of life, or else any creature native to it kept\nprudently out of the way while the flyers were there. They took off,\nthe globe rising like a balloon into the morning sky, the flitter\nwaiting until it was air-borne before scaling after it.\n\nThe mountainous island where they had based was the sea sentinel of an\narchipelago, which they saw spread out below them as if someone had\nflung a handful of pebbles into a shallow pool. Most of the islands\nwere merely rocky crags. But there were two which showed the green of\nsmall open fields, and Raf thought he caught a glimpse of a dome house\non the last.\n\nThey were now over a region thick with islands, the first collection\ngiving way to a second and then a third. Raf, expecting no sudden move\non the part of the globe he trailed, was startled when the alien ship\nmade a downward swoop. At the same time the warrior seated beside him\ntugged at the sleeve of his tunic and jabbed a finger toward the\nground, clearly an order to follow. Raf cut speed and cautiously lost\naltitude, determined that he was not going to be rushed into any move\nfor which he did not know the reason.\n\nThe globe was hovering over a small island set a little apart from the\nothers. A moment later Soriki's excited voice drew Raf's attention\nfrom his controls to what was going on below.\n\n\"There's, people down there! Look at them run!\"\n\nThey were too far away to be sure of the nature of the brown-gray\nthings so close to the color of the sea-washed rock that they could\nonly be detected when they moved. But it was evident that they were\nalive, and as Raf brought the flitter closer, he was also certain that\nthey ran on their two hind feet instead of on an animal's four pads.\n\nFrom the under part of the globe ship licked a tongue of fire. With\nthe force of a whiplash it coursed across the rock and in its passing\nembrace, the creatures below writhed and withered to charred heaps.\nThey had no chance under that methodical blasting. The alien beside\nRaf signaled again for a drop. He patted the weapon that he held and\nmotioned for Raf to release the covering of the windshield. But the\npilot shook his head firmly.\n\nThis might be war. The aliens could have a very good reason for their\ndeadly attack on the creatures surprised below. But he wanted no part\nof it, nor did he want to get any closer to the scene of slaughter.\nAnd he made an emphatic gesture that the windshield could not be\nopened while the flitter was air-borne.\n\nBut as he did so they glided down, and he caught a single good look at\nwhat was going on on the rock--a look which remained to haunt his\ndreams for long years to come. For now he saw clearly the creatures\nwho ran fruitlessly for safety. Some reached the edge of the cliff and\nleaped to what was an easier death in the sea. But too many others\ncould not make it and died in flaming agony. And they were not all of\none size!\n\nChildren! There was no mistaking the infant in its mother's arms, the\ntwo small ones who fled hand in hand until one stumbled and the\nburning lash caught them both as the other strove to pull the fallen\nto its feet. Raf gagged. He triggered the controls and soared up and\naway, fighting the heaving in his middle, shaking off with one savage\njerk the insistent pawing hand of the alien who wanted to join in the\nfun.\n\n\"Did you see that?\" he demanded of Soriki.\n\nFor once the com-tech sounded subdued. \"Yes,\" he replied shortly.\n\n\"Those were children,\" Raf hammered home the point.\n\n\"Young ones anyway,\" the com-tech conceded. \"Maybe they aren't people.\nThey had fur all over them--\"\n\nRaf grinned mirthlessly. Should he now accuse Soriki of prejudice?\nWhat did it matter if a thinking creature was clothed in a space suit,\nsilken bandages, or natural fur--it was still a thinking creature. And\nhe was sure that those had been intelligent creatures he had just seen\nblasted without a chance to fight back. If these were the enemy the\naliens feared, he could understand the vicious cruelty of the attack\nwhich had killed the man he had been shown back in the city. Fire\nagainst primitive spears was not equal, and when the spears got their\nchance they must make up for much to balance the scales of justice.\n\nHe did not even wonder why his emotions were so wholeheartedly\nenlisted upon the side of the furred people. Nor did he try to analyze\nhis feelings. He was only sure that more than ever he wanted to be\nfree of the aliens and out of this whole venture.\n\nThe warrior sharing his seat was sulking now, twisting about to look\nback at the island as Raf circled in ever-widening glides to get away\nfrom the site and yet not lose track of the globe when it would have\nfinished its dirty business and take once more to the air. But the\nalien ship was in no hurry to leave.\n\n\"They are making sure,\" Soriki reported. \"Giving the whole island a\nfire bath. I wonder what that stuff is--\"\n\n\"I'd just as soon not know,\" Raf returned from between set teeth. \"If\nthat is one of their pieces of precious knowledge, we're as well off\nwithout it--\" he stopped short. Perhaps he had said too much. But\nTerra had been racked by the torrid horror of atomic war, until all\nhis kind had been so revolted that it was bred into them not to meddle\nagain with such weapons. And war by fire aroused in them that old\nhorror. Surely Soriki must feel it too, and when the com-tech did not\ncomment, Raf was sure of that. He hoped that the slaughter had made\nsome impression on the captain and on Lablet into the bargain.\n\nBut when, as if sated with killing, the globe rose again from its\nposition over the island, moving almost sluggishly into the fresh sky,\nhe had to follow it on. More islands were below, and he feared that\neach one might show some sign of life and tempt the killers to a\nsecond hunting.\n\nLuckily that did not happen. The chains of islands became a cape as\nthey had on the coast of the western continent. And now the globe\nswung to the south, trailing the shore line. Forests made green\nsplotches with bluish overtones running from the sea cliffs back to\ncarpet the land. So far no signs of civilization were to be seen. This\nland was as untouched as that where the spacer had landed.\n\nThen they saw the bay, stretching out wide arms to engulf the sea. It\ncould have harbored a whole fleet. And marching down to its waters\nwere broad levels of buildings, a giant's staircase leading from sea\nto cliff tops.\n\n\"They had it here--!\"\n\nRaf saw what Soriki meant by that outburst. Destruction had struck. He\nhad seen the atomic ruins of his own world, those which were free\nenough from radiation to explore. But he had never seen anything like\nthese chilling scars. In long strips the very stone which provided\nfoundation for the tiered city had been churned and boiled, had run in\nrivulets of lava down to the sea, enclosing narrow tongues of still\nuntouched structures. The fire whip the globe had used, magnified to\nsome infinitely greater extent--? It could be.\n\nThe alien at his side pressed tightly against the windshield gazing\ndown at the ruins. And now he mouthed a gabble of words which was\nechoed by his fellow sitting with Soriki. Their excitement must mean\nthat this was their goal. Raf slacked speed, waiting for the globe to\npoint a way to a landing.\n\nBut to his surprise the alien ship shot forward inland. The long day\nwas almost over as they came to a second city with a river knotting a\nribbon through its middle. Here were no traces of the fury which had\nladed the seaport with havoc. This collection of buildings seemed\nwhole and perfect.\n\nThere was, oddly enough, no landing strip within the city. The globe\ncoasted over the rough oval and came down in open fields to the west.\nIt was a maneuver which Raf copied, though he first dropped a flare as\na precaution and brought the flier down in its red glare, with the\nwarrior expressing shrill disapproval.\n\n\"I don't think they like fireworks,\" Soriki remarked.\n\nRaf snorted. \"So they don't like fireworks! Well, I don't like\ncrack-ups, and I'm the pilot!\" But he didn't believe that the com-tech\nwas really protesting. Soriki had been very quiet since they had\nwitnessed the attack on the island.\n\n\"Grim-looking place,\" was his second comment as they touched ground.\n\nSince Raf privately had held that opinion of all the alien settlements\nhe had so far seen, he agreed. Their two alien passengers were out of\nthe flitter as soon as he opened the bubble shield. And as they stood\nby the Terran flyer, they held their weapons ready, facing out into\nthe dusk as if they half expected trouble. After the earlier episode\nthat day, Raf did not wonder at their preparedness. Terror begets\nterror, and ruthlessness arouses retaliation in kind.\n\n\"Kurbi! Soriki!\" Hobart's voice sounded out of the shadows. \"Stay\nwhere you are for the present.\"\n\nSoriki settled deeper in his seat. \"He doesn't have to tell me to\nbrake jets,\" he muttered. \"I like it here--\"\n\nRaf did not need to echo that. He had a strong surmise that had he\nbeen tempted to roam away from the flitter the move would not have\nbeen encouraged by the alien guardsmen. If this was their treasure\ncity, they would not welcome any independent investigation by\nstrangers.\n\nWhen the captain joined them, he was accompanied by the officer who\nhad first shown Raf the globe. And the warrior was either disturbed or\nangry, for he was talking in a steady stream and his hands were\nwhirling in explanatory gestures.\n\n\"They didn't like that flare,\" Hobart remarked. But there was no\nreproof in his words. As a spacer pilot he knew that Raf had only done\nwhat duty demanded. \"We're to remain here--for the night.\"\n\n\"Where's Lablet?\" Soriki wanted to know.\n\n\"He's staying with Yussoz, the alien commander. He thinks he has the\nlanguage problem about solved.\"\n\n\"Good enough.\" Soriki pulled out his bed roll. \"We're out of touch\nwith the ship--\"\n\nThere was a second of silence, unduly prolonged it seemed to Raf. Then\nHobart spoke:\n\n\"We couldn't expect to keep in call forever. The best com has its\nrange. When did you lose contact?\"\n\n\"Just before these wrapped-up heroes played with fire back there. I\ngave the boys all I knew up until then. They know we were headed west,\nand they had us beamed as long as they could.\"\n\nSo it wasn't too bad, thought Raf. But he didn't like it, even with\nthat mitigating factor. To all purposes the four Terrans were now\nsurrounded by some twenty times their number, in an unknown country,\nout of all communication with the rest of their kind. It could add up\nto disaster.\n\n\n\n\n9\n\nSEA GATE\n\n\n\"What is it?\" Dalgard asked his question as Sssuri, his attention still\non their back trail, stole along cautiously on a retracing of their\npath.\n\nBut that retreat ended abruptly with the merman plastered against the\nwall, his whole shadowy form a tense warning which stopped Dalgard\nshort. In that moment the answer flashed from mind to mind.\n\n\"There are those which follow--\"\n\n\"Snake-devils? Those Others?\" The colony scout supplied the only two\nexplanations he had, sending his own thought out questing. But as\nusual he could not hope to equal the more sensitive merman whose race\nhad always used that form of communication.\n\n\"Those who have long haunted the darkness,\" was the only reply he\ncould get.\n\nBut Sssuri's actions were far more indicative of danger. For the\nmerman turned and caught at Dalgard, pulling the larger colonist along\na step or two with the urgency of his grip.\n\n\"We cannot return this way--and we must travel fast!\"\n\nFor Sssuri who would face and had faced up to a snake-devil with a\nspear his sole weapon, this timidity was new. Dalgard was wise enough\nto accept his verdict of the wisdom of flight. Together they ran along\nthe underground corridor, soon putting a mile between them and the\npoint where the merman had first taken alarm.\n\n\"From what do we flee?\" As the merman began to slacken pace, Dalgard\nsent that query.\n\n\"There are those who live in this darkness. By one, or by two, we\ncould speedily remove them from life. But they hunt in packs and they\nare as greedy for the kill as are the snake-devils scenting meat. Also\nthey are intelligent. Once, long before the days of burning, they\nserved Those Others as hunters of game. And Those Others tried to make\nthem ever more intelligent and crafty so they might be sent to hunt\nwithout a huntsman. At last they grew too knowing for their masters.\nThen Those Others, realizing their menace, tried to kill them all with\ntraps and tricks. But only the most stupid and the slowest were so\ndisposed of. The others withdrew into underground ways such as this,\nventuring forth only in the dark of night.\"\n\n\"But if they are intelligent,\" countered the scout, \"why can they not\nbe reached by the mind touch?\"\n\n\"Through the years they have developed their own ways of thought. And\nthese are not the simple creatures of the sun, or such as the runners.\nOnce they were taught to answer only to Those Others. Now they answer\nonly to each other. But\"--he spread out his hands in one of his quick,\nnervous gestures--\"to those who are cornered by one of their packs,\nthey are sudden death!\"\n\nSince they could not, by Sssuri's reckoning, turn back, there was only\none course before them, to follow the passage they had chanced upon.\nThe merman was certain that it underran the river and that eventually\nthey would reach the sea--unless some side turn before that point\nwould make them free in the countryside once more.\n\nDalgard doubted if it had ever been a well-used way. And the presence\nof earth falls here and there, over which they stumbled and clawed\ntheir way, led him to consider the wisdom of keeping on to what might\nbe a dead end. But his trust in Sssuri's judgment was great, and as\nthe merman plowed forward with every appearance of confidence, he\ncontinued to trot along without complaint.\n\nThey snatched moments of rest, taking turns at guard. But the walls\nabout them were so unchanging that it was hard to measure time or\ndistance. Dalgard chewed at his emergency rations, a block of dried\nmeat and fruit pounded together to an almost rocklike consistency, and\ntried to make the crumbs he sucked loose satisfy his growing hunger.\n\nThe passageway was growing damper; water trickled down the walls and\ngathered in fetid pools on the floor. Dalgard's dislike of the place\ngrew. His shoulders hunched involuntarily as he strode along, for his\nimagination pictured the rock above them giving away to dump tons of\nthe oily river water down to engulf them. But though Sssuri avoided\nsplashing through the pools wherever he might, he did not appear to\nfind anything upsetting about the moisture.\n\nAt last the human could stand it no longer. \"How much farther to the\nsea?\" he asked without any hope of a real answer.\n\nAs he had expected him to do, Sssuri shrugged. \"We should be close.\nBut having never trod this way before, how can I tell you?\"\n\nOnce more they rested, choosing a stretch which was reasonably dry,\nmunching their dried food and drinking sparingly from the stoppered\nduocorn horns which swung from their belts. A man would have to be\ndying of thirst, Dalgard thought, before he would palm up any of the\nstagnant water from the passage pools.\n\nHe drifted off into a troubled sleep in which he fled beneath a sky\nwhich was a giant lid in the hand of an unseen enemy, a lid which was\nslowly lowered to crush him flat. He awoke with a start to find\nSssuri's cool, scaled fingers stroking his shoulder.\n\n\"Dream demons walk these roads.\" The words drifted into his half-awake\nmind.\n\n\"They do indeed,\" he roused to answer.\n\n\"It is always so where Those Others have been. They leave behind them\nthe thoughts which breed such dreams to trouble the sleep of those who\nare not of their kind. Let us go. I would like to be out of this place\nunder the clean sky, where no ancient wickedness hangs to poison the\nair and thought.\"\n\nEither the merman had miscalculated the direction of their route or\nthe river mouth was much farther from the inland city than they had\nbelieved, for, though they pushed on for what seemed like weary hours,\nthey came to no upward slope, no exit to the world they knew.\n\nInstead Dalgard began to realize that just the opposite was true. At\nlast he could stand it no longer and broke out with what he feared,\nhoping that Sssuri would deny that fear.\n\n\"We are going downhill!\"\n\nTo his disappointment the merman agreed. \"It has been so for the last\nthousand of our paces. It is my belief that this leads not to the sun\nbut out under the sea.\"\n\nDalgard missed a step. To Sssuri the sea was home and perhaps the\nthought of being under its floor was not disturbing. The land-born\nhuman was not so prepared. If he had experienced discomfort under the\nriver, what would it be like under the ocean? His terrifying dream of\na lid being pressed down upon him flashed back into his mind. But his\ncompanion was continuing:\n\n\"There will be doors, perhaps into the sea itself.\"\n\n\"For you,\" Dalgard pointed out, \"but I am no dweller in the depths.\"\n\n\"Neither were Those Others, yet they used these ways. And I tell\nyou\"--in his earnestness the merman laid his hand once more on\nDalgard's arm--\"to turn back now is out of the question. The death\nwhich haunts the darkness is still sniffing out our trail.\"\n\nDalgard glanced involuntarily over his shoulder. By the faint and\nlimited light of the purple disks he could see little or nothing. An\narmy might creep there undetected.\n\n\"But--\" His protest was in answer to the merman's seeming unconcern.\n\nSssuri at the first intimation that the hunters were behind them had\nshown wariness. Now he did not appear to care.\n\n\"They had fed,\" he replied. \"Scouts follow because we are something\nnew and thus suspect. When hunger rises once more in them, and their\nscouts report that we are meat, then is the time to draw knives and\nprepare for battle. But before that hour we may have won free. Let us\nsearch for the gate we now need.\"\n\nHowever confident the merman might be, Dalgard could not match that\nconfidence. In the open air he would have faced a snake-devil four\ntimes his size without any more emotion than a hunter's instinctive\ncaution. But here in the dark, unable to rid himself of the belief\nthat thousands of tons of sea water hung over his head, he found\nhimself starting at any sound, his knife bare and ready in his\nsweating hand.\n\nHe noted that Sssuri had stepped up the pace, passing into his\nsure-footed glide which made Dalgard exert himself to keep up. Before\nthem the corridor stretched without a break. The merman's promised\nexit, if it existed, was still out of sight.\n\nIt was difficult to gauge time in this dark hall, but Dalgard thought\nthat they were at least an hour farther on their way when Sssuri\npaused abruptly once more, his head cocked in a listening attitude, as\nif he caught some whisper of sound too rarefied for his human\ncompanion.\n\n\"Now--\" the thought hissed as if he spat the words, \"they hunger--and\nthey hunt!\"\n\nHe bounded forward with a spurt, which Dalgard copied, and they ran\nlightly, the dust undisturbed in years puffing up beneath the merman's\nbare, scaled feet and Dalgard's hide boots. Still the unbroken walls,\nthe feeble patches of violet in the ceiling. But no exit. And what\ngood would any exit do him, Dalgard thought, if it opened under the\nsea?\n\n\"There are islands off the coast--many islands--\" Sssuri caught him\nup. \"It is in my mind that we shall find our door on one of those.\nBut--run now, knife brother, for those at our heels awake and thirst\nfor flesh and blood. They have decided that we are not to be feared\nbut may be run down for their pleasure.\"\n\nDalgard weighed his knife in his hand. \"They shall find us with\nfangs,\" he promised grimly.\n\n\"It will be better if they do not find us at all,\" returned Sssuri.\n\nA burning arch of pain encased Dalgard's lower ribs, and his breath\ncame in gusts of hastily sucked air as their flight kept on, down the\nendless corridor. Sssuri was also showing signs of the grueling pace,\nhis round head bent forward, his furred legs pumping as if only his\niron will kept them moving. And the determination which kept him going\nwas communicated to the scout as a graver warning than any thought\nmessage of fear.\n\nThey were passing under one of the infrequent violet lights when\nDalgard got something else--a mental thrust so quick and sharp it was\nas if a sword had cut through the daze of fatigue to reach his brain.\nYet that had not come from Sssuri, for it was totally alien, wavering\non a band so near the extreme edge of his consciousness that it\npricked, receded, and pricked again as a needle might.\n\nThis was no message of fear or warning, but of implacable stubbornness\nand ravening hunger. And in that instant Dalgard knew that it came\nfrom what was sniffing out their trail, and he no longer wondered that\nthe hunters were immune to other mental contact. One could not reason\nwith--that!\n\nHe spurted forward, matching the merman's acceleration of speed. But\nto Dalgard's horror he saw that his companion now ran with one hand\nbrushing along the wall, as if he needed that support.\n\n\"Sssuri!\"\n\nHis thought met a wall of concentration through which he could not\nbreak. In a way he was reassured--for a moment, until another of those\nstabs from their pursuers struck him. He longed to look back, to see\nwhat hunted them. But he dared not break stride to do that.\n\n\"Ahhhh!\" The welcoming cry from Sssuri brought his attention back to\nhis companion as the merman broke into a wild run.\n\nDalgard summoned up his last rags of energy and coursed after him.\nSssuri had halted before a dark lump which protruded from the side of\nthe corridor.\n\n\"A sea lock!\" Sssuri's claws were clicking over the surface of the\nhatch, seeking the secret of its latch.\n\nPanting, Dalgard leaned against the opposite wall. Just as a protest\nformed in his mind he heard something else, the pad of feet, many\nfeet, echoing down the corridor. And somehow he was able now to look.\n\nRound spots of light, dull, greenish, close to the ground, as if\nsomeone had flung a handful of phosphorescence into the dark. But this\nwas no phosphorescence! Eyes! Eyes--he tried to count and knew it was\nimpossible to so reckon the number of the pack that ran mute but\nready. Nor could he distinguish more than a very shadowy glimpse of\nforms which glided close to the ground with an unpleasant sinuosity.\n\n\"Ahhhhh!\" Again Sssuri's paean of triumph.\n\nThere was the grate of unwilling metal forced to move, a puff of air\nredolent with the sea striking their bodies in chill threat, the\nbrightness of violet light stepped up to a point far beyond the lamps\nin the corridor.\n\nWith it came no rush of drowning water as Dalgard had half expected,\nand when the merman clambered through the hatch he prepared to follow,\nwell aware that the eyes, and the pattering feet which bore them, were\nnow almost within range.\n\nThere was a snarl from the passage, and a black thing sprang at the\nscout. Without clear sight of what he was fighting, he struck down\nwith his knife and felt it slit flesh. The snarl was a scream of rage\nas the creature twisted in midair for a second try at him. In that\ninstant Sssuri, leaning halfway out of the hatch, struck in his turn,\nthrusting his bone knife into shadows which now boiled with life.\n\nDalgard leaped for the lock door, kicking out swiftly and feeling the\ntoe of his boot contact with a crunch against one of those darting\nshades, sending it back end over end into the press where its fellows\nturned snapping upon it. Then Sssuri grabbed at him, bringing him in,\nand together they slammed the hatch, feeling it shake with the shock\nof thudding bodies as the pack outside went mad in their frustration.\n\nWhile the merman fastened the locking bar, bringing out of the\nlong-motionless metal another protesting screech, Dalgard had a chance\nto look about him. They were in a room some eight or nine feet long,\nthe violet light showing up well tangles of equipment hanging from\npegs on the walls, a pile of small cylinders on the floor. At the far\nend of the chamber was another hatch door, locked with the same type\nof bar as Sssuri had just lowered to seal the inner one. The merman\nnodded to it.\n\n\"The sea--\"\n\nDalgard slid his knife back into its sheath. So the sea lay beyond. He\ndid not welcome the thought of passing through that door. Like all of\nhis race he could swim--perhaps his feats in the water would have\nastonished the men of the planet from which his tribe had emigrated.\nBut unlike the mermen, he was not sea-born, nor equipped by nature\nwith a secondary breathing apparatus to make him as free in the world\nof water as he was on land. Sssuri might crawl through that hatch\nwithout fear. For Dalgard it was as big a test as to turn and face\nwhat now raged in the corridor on the inner side.\n\n\"There is no hope that they will go now,\" Sssuri answered his vague\nquestion. \"They are stubborn. And hours--or even days--will mean\nnothing. Also they can leave a guard there and rove at will, to return\nupon signal. That is their way.\"\n\nThis left only the sea door. Sssuri padded across the chamber and\nreached up to free one of the strange objects dangling from the wall\npegs. Like all things made of the marvelous substance used by Those\nOthers for any article which might be exposed to the elements, it\nseemed as perfect as on the day it had first been hung there, though\nthat date might be a hundred or more Astran years earlier. The merman\nuncoiled a length of thin, flexible piping which joined a two-foot\ncanister with a flat piece of metallic fabric.\n\n\"Those Others could not breathe under the water, as you cannot,\" he\nexplained as he worked deftly and swiftly. \"Within my own memory we\nhave trapped their scouts wearing aids such as these so that they\nmight spy upon our safe places. But their last foray was some years\nago and at that time we taught them such a lesson that they have not\ndared to return. Since they are not unlike you in body and since you\nbreathe the same air aboveground, there is no reason why this should\nnot take you out of here.\"\n\nDalgard accepted the apparatus. A couple of elastic metal bands\nfastened the canister to the chest of the wearer. The fabric molded\ninto a perfect, tight face mask as it touched the skin.\n\nSssuri went to the pile of cylinders. Choosing one he tinkered with\nits pointed cone, to be rewarded with a thin hiss.\n\n\"Ahhhh--\" again his recognition of the rightness of things. \"These\nstill contain air.\" He tested two more and then brought all three back\nto where Dalgard stood, the canister strapped into place, the mask\nready in his hand. With infinite care the merman fitted two of the\ncylinders into the canister and then was forced to set the other\naside.\n\n\"We could not change them while under water anyway,\" he explained. \"So\nit will do little good to take extra supplies with us.\"\n\nTrying not to speculate on the amount of air he could carry in the\ncylinders, Dalgard fastened on the mask, adjusted the air tube, and\nsucked. Air flowed--he could breathe! Only--for how long?\n\nSssuri, seeing that his companion was fully provided for, worked at\nthe bar locking the sea hatch. But in the end it took their combined\nstrength to spring that barrier and win through to a small cubby which\nwas the actual sea lock.\n\nDalgard knew one moment of resistance as the merman closed the hatch\nbehind them. For an instant it seemed that the dubious safety of the\ndressing chamber and a faint hope of the hunters' giving up their\nvigil was better than what might lie before them now. But Sssuri\npushed shut the hatch, and Dalgard stood quietly, without offering any\nvisible protest.\n\nHe tried to draw even breaths--slowly--as the merman activated the\nlock. When the water curled in from hidden openings, rising from ankle\nto calf and then to knee, its chill striking through flesh to bone, he\nkept to the same stolid waiting, though this seemed almost worse than\na sudden gush of water sweeping them out in its embrace.\n\nThe liquid swirled about Dalgard's waist now, tugging at his belt, his\narrow quiver, tapping on the bottom of the canister which held his\nprecious air supply. His brow, shielded from the wet by its casing,\nwas swallowed up inch by inch.\n\nAs the water lapped at his chin, the outer door opened with a slow\ninward push which suggested that the machinery controlling it had\ngrown sluggish with the years. Sssuri, perfectly at home, darted out\nas soon as the opening was large enough to afford him an exit. And his\nthought came back to reassure the more clumsy landsman.\n\n\"We are in the shallows--land rises ahead. The roots of an island.\nThere is nothing to fear--\" The word ended abruptly in what was like a\nmental gasp of either astonishment or fear.\n\nKnowing all the menaces which might lie in wait, even in the shallows\nof the sea, Dalgard drew his knife once more as he plowed through\nwater--ready to rescue or at least to offer what aid he could.\n\n\n\n\n10\n\nTHE DEAD GUARDIANS\n\n\nThe spacemen spent a cramped and almost sleepless night. Although in\nhis training on Terra, on his trial trips to Mars and the harsh Lunar\nvalleys, Raf had known weird surroundings and climates, inimical to\nhis kind, he had always been able to rest almost by the exercise of\nhis will. But now, curled in his roll, he was alert to every sound out\nof the moonless night, finding himself listening--for what he did not\nknow.\n\nThough there were sounds in plenty. The whistling call of some night\nbird, the distant lap, lap of water which he associated with the river\ncurving through the long-deserted city, the rustle of grass as either\nthe wind or some passing animal disturbed it.\n\n\"Not the best place in the world for a nap,\" Soriki observed out of\nthe dark as Raf wriggled, trying to find a more comfortable position.\n\"I'll be glad to see these bandaged boys on the ground waving good-bye\nas we head away from them--fast--\"\n\n\"Those weren't animals they killed--back on that island.\" Raf brought\nout what was at the heart of his trouble.\n\n\"They wore fur instead of clothing.\" Soriki's reply was delivered in a\ncolorless, even voice. \"We have apes on Terra, but they are not men.\"\n\nRaf stared up at the sky in which stars were sprinkled like carelessly\nflung dust motes. \"What is a 'man'?\" he returned, repeating the\nclassical question which was a debating point in all the space\ntraining centers.\n\nFor so long his kind had wondered that. Was a \"man\" a biped with\ncertain easily recognized physical characteristics? Well, by that\nruling the furry things which had fled fruitlessly from the flames of\nthe globe might well qualify. Or was \"man\" a certain level of\nintelligence, no matter what form housed that intelligence? They were\nsupposed to accept the latter definition. Though, in spite of the\nhorror of prejudice, Raf could not help but believe that too many\nTerrans secretly thought of \"man\" only as a creature in their own\ngeneral image. By that prejudiced rule it was correct to accept the\naliens as \"men\" with whom they could ally themselves, to condemn the\nfurry people because they were not smooth-skinned, did not wear\nclothing, nor ride in mechanical transportation.\n\nYet somewhere within Raf at that moment was the nagging feeling that\nthis was all utterly wrong, that the Terrans had not made the right\nchoice. And that now \"men\" were _not_ standing together. But he had no\nintention of spilling that out to Soriki.\n\n\"Man is intelligence.\" The com-tech was answering the question Raf had\nalmost forgotten that he had asked the moment before. Yes, the proper\nconventional reply. Soriki was not going to be caught out with any\nclaim of prejudice.\n\nOdd--when Pax had ruled, there were thought police and the cardinal\nsin was to be a liberal, to experiment, to seek knowledge. Now the\nwheel had turned--to be conservative was suspect. To suggest that some\nold ways were better was to exhibit the evil signs of prejudice. Raf\ngrinned wryly. Sure, he had wanted to reach the stars, had fought\ndoggedly to come to the very spot where he now was. So why was he\ntormented now with all these second thoughts? Why did he feel every\nday less akin to the men with whom he had shared the voyage? He had\nhad wit enough to keep his semirebellion under cover, but since he had\ntaken the flitter into the morning sky above the landing place of the\nspacer, that task of self-discipline was becoming more and more\ndifficult.\n\n\"Did you notice,\" the com-tech said, going off on a new track, \"that\nthese painted boys were not too quick about blasting along to their\nstrongbox? I'd say that they thought some bright rocket jockey might\nhave rigged a surprise for them somewhere in there--\"\n\nNow that Soriki mentioned it, Raf remembered that the alien party who\nhad gone into the city had huddled together, and that several of the\nblack-and-white warriors had fanned out ahead as scouts might in enemy\nterritory.\n\n\"They didn't go any farther than that building to the west either.\"\n\nThat Raf had not noticed, but he was willing to accept Soriki's\nobservation. The com-tech had a ready eye for details. He'd better pay\ncloser attention himself. This was no time to explore the why and\nwherefore of his present position. So, if they went no farther than\nthat building, it would argue that the aliens themselves didn't care\nto go about here after nightfall. For he was certain that the isolated\nstructure Soriki had pointed out was not the treasure house they had\ncome to loot.\n\nThe night wore on and sometime during it Raf fell asleep. But the two\nor three hours of restless, dream-filled unconsciousness was not what\nhe needed, and he blinked in the dawn with eyes which felt as if they\nwere filled with hot sand. In the first gray light a covey of winged\nthings, which might or might not have been birds, arose from some\nroosting place within the city, wheeled three times over the building,\nand then vanished out over the countryside.\n\nRaf pulled himself out of his roll, made a sketchy toilet with the\npreparations in a belt kit, and looked about with little favor for\neither the scene or his part in it. The globe, sealed as if ready for\na take-off, was some distance away, but installed about halfway\nbetween it and the flitter were two of the alien warriors. Perhaps\nthey had changed watches during the night. If they had not, they could\ngo without sleep to an amazing degree, for as Raf walked in a circle\nabout the flyer to limber up, they watched him closely, nor did their\ngrips on their odd weapons loosen. And he had a very clear idea that\nif he stepped over some invisible boundary he would be in for trouble.\n\nWhen he came back to the flitter, Soriki was awake and stretching.\n\n\"Another day,\" the com-tech drawled. \"And I could do with something\nbesides field rations.\" He made a face at the small tin of\nconcentrates he had dug out of the supply compartment.\n\n\"We'd do well to be headed west,\" Raf ventured.\n\n\"Now you can come in with that on the com again!\" Soriki answered with\nunwonted emphasis. \"The sooner I see the old girl standing on her pins\nin the middle distance, the better I'll feel. You know\"--he looked up\nfrom his preoccupation with the ration package and gazed out over the\ncity--\"this place gives me the shivers. That other town was bad\nenough. But at least there were people living there. Here's nothing at\nall--at least nothing I want to see.\"\n\n\"What about all the wonders they've promised to show us?\" countered\nRaf.\n\nSoriki grinned. \"And how much do we understand of their mouth-and-hand\ntalk? Maybe they were promising us wonders, maybe they were offering to\ntake us to where we could have our throats cut more conveniently--for them!\nI tell you, if I go for a walk with any of these painted faces, I'm going\nto have at least three of my fingers resting on the grip of my stun gun.\nAnd I'd advise you to do the same--if I didn't know that you were already\nwatching these blast-happy harpies out of the corner of your eye.\nHa--company. Oh, it's the captain--\"\n\nThe hatch of the globe had opened, and a small party was descending\nthe ladder, conspicuous among them the form and uniform of Captain\nHobart. The aliens remained in a cluster at the foot of the ladder\nwhile the Terran commander crossed to the flitter.\n\n\"You\"--he pointed to Raf--\"are to come along with us.\"\n\n\"Why, sir?\" \"What about me, sir?\" The questions from the two at the\nflitter came together.\n\n\"I said that one of you had to remain by the machine. Then they said\nthat you, in particular, must come along, Kurbi.\"\n\n\"But I'm the pilot--\" Raf began and then realized that it was just\nthat fact which had made the aliens attach him to the exploring party.\nIf they believed that the Terran flitter was immobilized when he, and\nhe alone, was not behind its controls, this was just the move they\nwould make. But there they were wrong. Soriki might not be able to\nrepair or service the motor, but in a pinch he could take it up, send\nit westward, and land it beside the spacer. Each and every man aboard\nthe _RS 10_ had that much training.\n\nNow the com-tech was scowling. He had grasped the significance of that\narrangement as quickly as Raf. \"How long do I wait for you, sir?\" he\nasked in a voice which had lost its usual good-humored drawl.\n\nAnd at that inquiry Captain Hobart showed signs of irritation. \"Your\nsuspicions are not founded on facts,\" he stated firmly. \"These people\nhave displayed no signs of wanting to harm us. And an attitude of\ndistrust at this point might be fatal for future friendly contact.\nLablet is sure that they have a highly complex society, probably\nadvanced beyond Terran standards, and that their technical skills will\nbe of vast benefit to us. As it happens we have come at just the right\nmoment in their history, when they are striving to get back on their\nfeet after a disastrous series of wars. It is as if a group of\noff-world explorers had allied themselves with us after the Burn-Off.\nWe can exchange information which will be of mutual benefit.\"\n\n\"If any off-world explorers had set down on Terra after the Burn-Off,\"\nobserved Soriki softly, \"they would have come up against Pax. And just\nhow long would they have lasted?\"\n\nHobart had turned away. If he heard that half-whisper, he did not\nchoose to acknowledge it. But the truth in the com-tech's words made\nan impression on Raf, a crew of aliens who had been misguided enough\nto seek out and try to establish friendly relations with the officials\nof Pax would have had a short and most unhappy shrift. If all the\naccounts of that dark dictatorship were true, they would have vanished\nfrom Terra, and not in their ships either. What if something like Pax\nruled here? They had no way of knowing for sure.\n\nRaf's eyes met Soriki's, and the com-tech's hand dropped to hook\nfingers in his belt within touching distance of his side arm. The\nflitter pilot nodded.\n\n\"Kurbi!\" Hobart's impatient call sent him on his way. But there was\nsome measure of relief in knowing that Soriki was left behind and that\nthey had this slender link with escape.\n\nHe had tramped the streets of that other alien city. There there had\nbeen some semblance of habitation; here was abandonment. Earth drifted\nin dunes to half block the lanes, and here and there climbing vines\nhad broken down masonry and had dislodged blocks of the paved sideways\nand courtyards.\n\nThe party threaded their way from one narrow lane to another, seeming\nto avoid the wider open stretches of the principal thoroughfares, Raf\nbecame aware of an unpleasant odor in the air which he vaguely\nassociated with water, and a few minutes afterward he caught glimpses\nof the river between the buildings which fronted on it. Here the party\nturned abruptly at a right angle, heading westward once more, passing\nvast, blank-walled structures which might have been warehouses.\n\nOne of the aliens just ahead of Raf in the line of march suddenly\nswung around, his weapon pointing up, and from its nose shot a beam of\nred-yellow light which brought an answering shrill scream as a large,\nwinged creature came fluttering down. The killer kicked at the\ncrumpled thing as he passed. As far as Raf could see there had been no\nreason for that wanton slaying.\n\nThe head of the party had reached a doorway, sealed shut by what\nlooked like a solid slab of material. He placed both palms flat down\non its surface at shoulder height and leaned forward against it,\nalmost as if he were whispering some secret formula. Raf watched the\nmuscles stand up on his slender arms as he exerted strength. And then\nthe door split in two, and his fellows helped him push the separate\nhalves back into the wall.\n\nLablet, Hobart, and Raf were among the last to enter. It was as if\ntheir companions had now forgotten them, for the aliens were pushing\non at a pace which took them down an empty corridor at a quickening\ntrot.\n\nThe corridor ended in a ramp which did not slope in one straight reach\nbut curled around itself, so that in some places only the presence of\na handrail, to which they all clung, kept them from losing balance.\nThen they gathered in a vaulted room, one of which opened a complete\ncircle of closed doors.\n\nThere was some argument among the aliens, a dispute of sorts over\nwhich of those doors was to be opened first, and the Terrans drew a\nlittle apart, unable to follow the twittering words and\nlightning-swift gestures.\n\nRaf tried to work out the patterns of color which swirled and looped\nover each door and around the walls, only to discover that too long an\nexamination of any one band, or an attempt to trace its beginning or\nend, awoke a sick sensation which approached inner turmoil the longer\nhe looked. At last he had to rest his eyes by studying the gray\nflooring under his boots.\n\nThe aliens finally made up their minds, or else one group was able to\noutargue the other, for they converged upon a door directly opposite\nthe ramp. Once more they went through the process of unsealing the\npanels, while the Terrans, drawn by curiosity, were close behind them\nas they entered the long room beyond. Here were shelves in solid tiers\nalong the walls, crowded with such an array of strange objects that\nRaf, after one mystified look, thought that it might well take months\nto sort them all out.\n\nIn addition, long tables divided the chamber into aisles. Halfway down\none of these narrow passageways the aliens had gathered in a group as\nsilent and intent now as they had been noisy outside. Raf could see\nnothing to so rivet their attention but a series of scuffed marks in\nthe dust which covered the floor. But an alien, whom he recognized as\nthe officer who had taken him to inspect the globe, moved carefully\nalong that trail, following it to a second door. And as Raf pushed\ndown another aisle, paralleling his course, he was conscious of a\nsickly sweet, stomach-churning stench. Something was very, very dead\nand not too far away.\n\nThe officer must have come to the same conclusion, for he hurried to\nopen the other door. Before them now was a narrow hall broken by slit\nwindows, near the roof, through which entered sunlight. And one such\nbeam fully illuminated a carcass as large as that of a small elephant,\nor so it seemed to Raf's startled gaze.\n\nIt was difficult to make out the true appearance of the creature,\nthough guessing from the scaled strips of skin it had been reptilian,\nfor the body had been found by scavengers and feasting had been in\nprogress.\n\nThe alien officer skirted the corpse gingerly. Raf though that he\nwould like to investigate the body closely but could not force himself\nto that highly disagreeable task. There was a chorus of excited\nexclamation from the doorway as others crowded there.\n\nBut the officer, having circled the carcass, turned his attention to\nthe dusty floor again. If there had been any trail there, it was now\nmuddled past their reading, for remnants of the grisly meal had been\ndragged back and forth. The alien picked his way fastidiously through\nthe noxious debris to the end of the long room. Raf, with the same\ncare, toured the edge of the chamber in his wake.\n\nThey were out in a smaller passageway, which was taking them\nunderground, the Terran estimated. Then there was a large space with\nbarred cells about it and a second corridor. The stench of the death\nchamber either clung to them, or was wafted from another point, and\nRaf gagged as an especially foul blast caught him full in the face. He\nkept a sharp look about him for signs of those feasters. The feast had\nnot been finished--it might have been that their entrance into the\nstoreroom had disturbed the scavengers. And things formidable enough\nto drag down that scaled horror were not foes he would choose to meet\nin these unlighted ways.\n\nThe passage began to slope upward once more, and Raf saw a half-moon\nof light ahead, brilliant light which could only come from the sun.\nThe alien was outlined there as he went out; then he himself was\nscuffing through sand close upon another death scene. The dead\nmonster had had its counterparts, and here they were, sprawled out,\nmangled, and torn. Raf remained by the archway, for even the open air\nand the morning winds could not destroy the reek which seemed as\ndeadly as a gas attack.\n\nIt must have disturbed the officer too, for he hesitated. Then with\nvisible effort he advanced toward the hunks of flesh, casting back and\nforth as if to find some clue to the manner of their death. He was\nstill so engaged when a second alien burst out of the archway, a\nsplintered length of white held out before him as if he had made some\nimportant discovery.\n\nThe officer grabbed that shaft away from him, turning it around in his\nhands. And though expression was hard to read on those thin features\nunder the masking face paint, the emotion his whole attitude expressed\nwas surprise tinged with unbelief--as if the object his subordinate\nhad brought was the last he expected to find in that place.\n\nRaf longed to inspect it, but both aliens brushed by him and pattered\nback down the corridor, the discoverer pouring forth a volume of words\nto which the officer listened with great intentness. And the Terran\npilot had to hurry to keep up with them.\n\nSomething he had seen just before he had left the arena remained in\nhis mind: a forearm flung out from the supine body of what appeared to\nbe the largest of the dead things--and on that forearm a bracelet of\nmetal. Were those things pets! Watchdogs? Surely they were not\nintelligent beings able to forge and wear such ornaments of their own\naccord. And if they were watchdogs--whom did they serve? He was\ninclined to believe that the aliens must be their masters, that the\nmonsters had been guardians of the treasure, perhaps. But dead\nguardians suggested a rifled treasure house. Who and what--?\n\nHis mind filled with speculations and questions, Raf trotted behind\nthe others back to the chamber where they had found the first reptile.\nThe alien who had brought the discovery to his commander stepped\ngingerly through the litter and laid the white rod in a special spot,\napparently the place where it had been found.\n\nAt a barked order from the officer, two of the others came forward and\ntugged at the creature's mangled head, which had been freed from the\nserpent neck, rolling it over to expose the underparts. There was a\nbroad tear there in the flesh, but Raf could see little difference\nbetween it and those left by the feasters. However the officer,\nholding a strip of cloth over his nose, bent stiffly above it for a\ncloser look and then made some statement which sent his command into a\nbabbling clamor.\n\nFour of the lower ranks separated from the group and, with their hand\nweapons at alert, swung into action, retracing the way back toward the\narena. It looked to Raf as if they now expected an attack from that\ndirection.\n\nUnder a volley of orders the rest went back to the storeroom, and the\nofficer, noting that Raf still lingered, waved him impatiently after\nthem.\n\nInside the men spread out, going from shelf to table, selecting things\nwith a speed which suggested that they had been rehearsed in this task\nand had only a limited time in which to accomplish it. Some took piles\nof boxes or other containers which were so light that they could\nmanage a half-dozen in an armload, while two or three others struggled\npantingly to move a single piece of weird machinery from its bed to\nthe wheeled trolley they had brought. There was to be no lingering on\nthis job--that was certain.\n\n\n\n\n11\n\nESPIONAGE\n\n\nIntent upon joining Sssuri, Dalgard left the lock, forgetting his\nearlier unwillingness, stepping from the small chamber down to the sea\nbottom, or endeavoring to, although instinctively he had begun to swim\nand so forged ahead at a different rate of speed.\n\nWaving fronds of giant water plants, such as were found only in the\ncoastal shallows, grew forest fashion but did not hide rocks which\nstretched up in a sharp rise not too far ahead. The scout could not\nsee the merman, but as he held onto one of those fronds he caught the\nother's summons:\n\n\"Here--by the rocks--!\"\n\nPushing his way through the drifting foliage, Dalgard swam ahead to\nthe foot of the rocky escarpment. And there he saw what had so excited\nhis companion.\n\nSssuri had just driven away an encircling collection of sand-dwelling\nscavengers, and what he was on his knees studying intently was an\nalmost clean-picked skeleton of one of his own race. But there was\nsomething odd--Dalgard brushed aside a tendril of weed which cut his\nline of vision and so was able to see clearly.\n\nWhite and clean most of those bones were, but the skull was blackened,\nand similar charring existed down one arm and shoulder. That merman\nhad not died from any mishap in the sea!\n\n\"It is so,\" Sssuri replied to his thought. \"_They_ have come once more\nto give the flaming death--\"\n\nDalgard, startled, looked up that slope which must lead to the island\ntop above the waves.\n\n\"Long dead?\" he asked tentatively, already guessing what the other's\nanswer would be.\n\n\"The pickers move fast,\" Sssuri indicated the sand dwellers. \"Perhaps\nyesterday, perhaps the day before--but no longer than that.\"\n\n\"And _they_ are up there now?\"\n\n\"Who can tell? However, _they_ do not know the sea, nor the islands--\"\n\nIt was plain that the merman intended to climb to investigate what\nmight be happening above. Dalgard had no choice but to follow. And it\nwas true that the merpeople had no peers or equals when it came to\nfinding their ways about the sea and the coasts. He was confident that\nSssuri could get to the island top and discover just what he wished to\nlearn without a single sentry above, if they had stationed sentries,\nbeing the wiser. Whether he himself could operate as efficiently was\nanother matter.\n\nIn the end they half climbed, half swam upward, detouring swiftly once\nto avoid the darting attack of a rock hornet, harmless as soon as they\nmoved out of the reach of its questing stinger, for it was anchored\nfor its short life to the rough hollow in which it had been hatched.\n\nDalgard's head broke water as he rolled through the surf onto a scrap\nof beach in the lee of a row of tooth-pointed outcrops. It was late\nevening by the light, and he clawed the mask off his face to draw\nthankful lungfuls of the good outer air. Sssuri, his fur sleeked tight\nto his body, waded ashore, shook himself free of excess water, and\nturned immediately to study the wall of the cliff which guarded the\ninterior of the island.\n\nThis was one of a chain of such isles, Dalgard noted, now that he had\nhad time to look about him. And with their many-creviced walls they\nwere just the type of habitations which appealed most strongly to the\nmerpeople. Here could be found the dry inner caves with underwater\nentrances, which they favored for their group homes. And in the sea\nwere kelp beds for harvesting.\n\nThe cliffs did not present too much of a climbing problem. Dalgard\ndivested himself of the diving equipment, tucking it into a hollow\nwhich he walled up with stones that he thought the waves would not\nscour out in a hurry. He might need it again. Then, hitching his belt\ntighter, pressing what water he could out of his clothing, and\nsettling his bow and quiver to the best advantage at his back, he\ncrossed to where Sssuri was already marking claw holds.\n\n\"We may be seen--\" Dalgard craned his neck, trying to make out details\nof what might be waiting above.\n\nThe merman shook his head with a quick jerk of negation. \"_They_ are\ngone. Behind them remains only death--much death--\" And the bleakness\nof his thoughts reached the scout.\n\nDalgard had known Sssuri since he was a toddler and the other a cub\ncoming to see the wonders of dry land for the first time. Never,\nduring all their years of close association since, had he felt in the\nother a desolation so great. And to that emotional blast he could make\nno answer.\n\nIn the twilight, with the last red banners across the sky at their\nback, they made the climb. And it was as if the merman had closed off\nhis mind to his companion. Flesh fingers touched scaled ones as they\nmoved from one hold to the next, but Sssuri might have been half a\nworld away for all the communication between them. Never had Dalgard\nbeen so shut out and with that his sensitivity to the night, to the\nworld about him, was doubly acute.\n\nHe realized--and it worried him--that perhaps he had come to depend\ntoo much on Sssuri's superior faculty of communication. It was time\nthat he tried to use his own weaker powers to the utmost extent. So,\nwhile he climbed, Dalgard sent questing thoughts into the gloom. He\nlocated a nest of duck-dogs, those shy waterline fishers living in\ncliff holes. They were harmless and just settling down for the night.\nBut of higher types of animals from which something might be\nlearned--hoppers, runners--there were no traces. For all he was able\nto pick up, they might be climbing into blank nothingness.\n\nAnd that in itself was ominous. Normally he should have been able to\nmind touch more than duck-dogs. The merpeople lived in peace with most\nof the higher fauna of their world, and a colony of hoppers, even a\ncovey of moth birds, would settle in close by a mer tribe to garner in\nthe remnants of feasts and for protection from the flying dragons and\nthe other dangers they must face.\n\n\"_They_ hunt all life,\" the first break in Sssuri's self-absorption\ncame. \"Where _they_ walk the little, harmless peoples face only death.\nAnd so it has been here.\" He had pulled himself over the rim of the\ncliff, and through the dark Dalgard could hear him panting with the\nsame effort which made his own lungs labor.\n\nJust as the stench of the snake-devil's lair had betrayed its site,\nhere disaster and death had an odor of its own. Dalgard retched before\nhe could control throat and stomach muscles. But Sssuri was unmoved,\nas if he had expected this.\n\nThen, to Dalgard's surprise the merman set up the first real call he\nhad ever heard issue from that furred throat, a plaintive whistle\nwhich had a crooning, summoning note in it, akin to the mind touch in\nan odd fashion, yet audible. They sat in silence for a long moment,\nthe human's ears as keen for any sound out of the night as those of\nhis companion. Why did Sssuri not use the customary noiseless greeting\nof his race? When he beamed that inquiry, he met once again that\nstrange, solid wall of non-acceptance which had enclosed the merman as\nthey climbed. As if now there was danger to be feared from following\nthe normal ways.\n\nAgain Sssuri whistled, and in that cry Dalgard heard a close\nresemblance to the flute tone of the night moth birds. Up the scale\nthe notes ran with mournful persistence. When the answer came, the\nscout at first thought that the imitation had lured a moth bird, for\nthe reply seemed to ripple right above their heads.\n\nSssuri stood up, and his hand dropped on Dalgard's shoulder, applying\npressure which was both a warning and a summons, bringing the scout to\nhis feet with as little noise as possible. The horrible smell caught\nat his throat, and he was glad when the merman did not head inland\ntoward the source of that odor, but started off along the edge of the\ncliff, one hand in Dalgard's to draw him along.\n\nTwice more Sssuri paused to whistle, and each time he was answered by\na signing note or two which seemed to reassure him.\n\nAgainst the lighter expanse which was the sea, Dalgard saw the loom of\na peak which projected above file general level of the island. Though\nhe knew that the merpeople did not build aboveground, being adept in\nturning natural caves and crevices into the kind of living quarters\nthey found most satisfactory, the barrenness of this particular rock\ntop was forbidding.\n\nLed by Sssuri, he threaded a tangled patch among outcrops,\nonce-squeezing through a gap which scraped the flesh on his arms as he\nwriggled. Then the sky was blotted out, the last winking star\ndisappeared, and he realized that he must have entered a cave of\nsorts, or was at least under an overhang.\n\nThe merman did not pause but padded on, tugging Dalgard along, the\nscout's boots scraping on the rough footing. The colonist was\nconscious now that they were on an incline, heading down into the\nheart of the island. They came to a stretch where Sssuri set his hands\non holds, patiently shoved his feet into hollowed places, finding for\nhim the ladder steps he could not see, which took him through a\nsweating, fearful journey of yards to another level, another sloping,\ndownward way.\n\nHere at long last was a fraction of light, not the violet glimmer\nwhich had illuminated the underground ways of those Others, but a\nghostly radiance which he recognized as the lamps of the\nmermen--living creatures from the sea depths imprisoned in laboriously\nfashioned globes of crystal and kept in the caves for the light they\nyielded.\n\nBut still no mind touch! Never had Dalgard penetrated into the cave\ncities of the sea folk before without inquiries and open welcome\nlapping about him. Were they entering a place of massacre where no\nliving merman remained? Yet there was that whistling which had led\nSssuri to this place....\n\nAnd at that moment a shrill keening note arose from the depths to ring\nin Dalgard's ears, startling him so that he almost lost his footing.\nOnce again Sssuri made answer vocally--but no mind touch.\n\nThen they rounded a curve, and the scout was able to see into the\nheart of the amphibian territory. This was a natural cave, as were all\nthe merman's dwellings, but its walls had been smoothed and hung with\nthe garlands of shells which they wove in their leisure into strange\npictures. Silver-gray sand, smooth and dust-fine, covered the floor to\nthe depth of a foot or more. And opening off the main chamber were\nsmall nooks, each marking the private storage place and holding of\nsome family clan. It was a large place, and with a quick estimate\nDalgard thought that it had been fashioned to harbor close to a\nhundred inhabitants, at least the nooks suggested that many. But\ngathered at the foot of the ledge they were descending, spears poised,\nwere perhaps ten males, some hardly past cubhood, others showing the\nsnowy shine of fur which was the badge of age. And behind them, drawn\nknives in their ready hands, were half again as many merwomen, forming\na protecting wall before a crouching group of cubs.\n\nSssuri spoke to Dalgard. \"Spread out your hands--empty--so that they\nmay see them clearly!\"\n\nThe scout obeyed. In the limited light his ten fingers were fans, and\nit was then that he understood the reason for such a move. If these\nmermen had not seen a colonist before, he might resemble Those Others\nin their eyes. But only his species on all Astra had five fingers,\nfive toes, and that physical evidence might insure his safety now.\n\n\"Why do you bring a destroyer among us? Or do you offer him for our\npunishment, so that we can lay upon him the doom that his kind have\nearned?\"\n\nThe question came with arrow force, and Dalgard held out his hands,\nhoping they would see the difference before one of those spears from\nbelow tore through his flesh.\n\n\"Look upon the hands of this--my knife brother--look upon his face. He\nis not of the race of those you hate, but rather one from the south.\nHave you of the northern reaches not heard of Those-Who-Help,\nThose-Who-Came-From-the-Stars?\"\n\n\"We have heard.\" But there was no relaxing of tension, not a spear\npoint wavered.\n\n\"Look upon his hands,\" Sssuri insisted. \"Come into his mind, for he\nspeaks with us so. And do _they_ do that?\"\n\nDalgard tried to throw open his mind, awaiting the trial. It came\nquickly, traces of inimical, alien thought, which changed as they\ntouched his mind, reading there only all the friendliness he and his\nheld for the sea people.\n\n\"He is not of _them_.\" The admission was grudging. As if they did not\nwant to believe that. \"Why comes one from the south to this\nplace--now?\"\n\nThere was an inflection to that \"now\" which was disturbing.\n\n\"After the manner of his people he seeks new things so that he may\nreturn and report to his Elders. Then he will receive the spear of\nmanhood and be ready for the choosing of mates,\" Sssuri translated the\nreason for Dalgard's quest into the terms of his own people. \"He has\nbeen my knife brother since we were cubs together, and so I journey\nwith him. But here in the north we have found evil--\"\n\nHis flow of thought was submerged by a band of hate so red that its\nimpact upon the mind was almost a blow. Dalgard shook his head. He had\nknown that the merpeople, aroused, were deadly fighters, fearless and\ncrafty, and with a staying power beyond that of any human. But their\nrage was something he had not met before.\n\n\"_They_ come once again--_they_ burn with the fire--_They_ are among\nour islands--\"\n\nA cub whimpered and a merwoman stooped to pat it to silence.\n\n\"Here they have killed with the fire--\"\n\nThey did not elaborate upon that statement, and Dalgard had no wish\nfor them to do so. He was still very glad that it had been dark when\nhe had climbed to the top of that cliff, that he had not been able to\nsee what his imagination told him lay there.\n\n\"Do _they_ stay?\" That was Sssuri.\n\n\"Not so. In their sky traveler they go to the land where lies the dark\ncity. There they make much evil against the day when this shall be\ntheir land once more.\"\n\n\"But these lie if they think that.\" Another strong thought broke\nacross the current of communication. \"_We_ are not now penned for\ntheir pleasure. We may flee into the sea once more, and there live as\ndid our fathers' fathers, and they dare not follow us there--\"\n\n\"Who knows?\" It was Sssuri who raised that objection. \"With their\nancient knowledge once more theirs, even the depths of the sea may not\nbe ours much longer. Do they not know how to ride upon the air?\"\n\nThe knot of mer-warriors stirred. Several spears thudded butt down\ninto the sand. And Sssuri accepted that as an invitation to descend,\nsummoning Dalgard after him with a beckoning finger.\n\nLater they sat in a circle in the cushioning gray powder, the two from\nthe south eating dried fish and sea kelp, while Sssuri related,\nbetween mouthfuls, their recent adventures.\n\n\"Three times have _they_ flown across these islands on their way to\nthat city,\" the Elder of the pitifully decimated merman tribe told the\nexplorers.\n\n\"But this time,\" broke in one of his companions, \"they had with them a\nnew ship--\"\n\n\"A new ship?\" Sssuri pounced upon that scrap of information.\n\n\"Yes. The ships of the air in which _they_ travel are fashioned\nso\"--with his knife point he drew a circle in the sand--\"but this one\nwas smaller and more in the likeness of a spear with a heavy\npoint--thus\"--he made a second sketch beside the first, and Dalgard\nand Sssuri leaned over to study it.\n\n\"That is unlike any of their ships that I have heard of,\" Sssuri\nagreed. \"Even in the old tales of the Days Before the Burning there is\nnothing spoken of like that.\"\n\n\"It is true. Therefore we wait now for the coming of our scouts, who\nwere set in hiding upon _their_ sea rock of resting, that they may\ntell us more concerning this new ship. They should be here within this\ntime of sleeping. Now, go you to rest, which you plainly have need of,\nand we shall call you when they come.\"\n\nDalgard was willing enough to stretch out in the sand in the shadows\nof the far end of the cave. Beyond him three cubs slumbered together,\ntheir arms about each other, and a feeling of peace was there such as\nhe had not known since he left the stronghold of Homeport.\n\nThe weird glow of the imprisoned sea monsters gave light to the main\npart of the cave, and it might still have been night when the scout\nwas shaken awake once more. A group of the merpeople were sitting\ntogether, and their thoughts interrupted each other as their\nexcitement arose. Their spies must have returned.\n\nDalgard crossed to join that group, but it seemed to him that his\nwelcome was not unqualified, and that some of the openness of the\nearly hours of the night was lacking. He might have been once more\nunder suspicion.\n\n\"Knife brother\"--to Dalgard's sensitive mind that form of address from\nSssuri was used for a special purpose: to underline the close bond\nbetween them--\"listen to the words of Sssim who is a Hider-to-Watch on\nthe island where _they_ rest their ships during the voyage from one\nland to another.\" He drew Dalgard down beside him to face a young\nmerman who was staring round-eyed at the colony scout.\n\n\"He is like--yet unlike\"--his first wisp of thought meant nothing to\nthe scout. \"The strangers wear many coverings on their bodies as do\n_they_, and they had also coverings upon their heads. They were\nbigger. Also from their minds I learned that they are not of this\nworld--\"\n\n\"Not of this world!\" Dalgard burst out in his own speech.\n\n\"There!\" The spy was triumphant. \"So did they talk to one another, not\nwith the mind but by making mouth noises, different mouth noises from\nthose that _they_ make. Yes, they are like--but unlike this one.\"\n\n\"And these strangers flew the ship we have not seen before?\"\n\n\"It is so. But they did not know the way and were guided by the globe.\nAnd at least one among them was distrustful of _those_ and wished to\nbe free to return to his own place. He walked by the rocks near my\nhiding place, and I read his thoughts. No, they were with _them_, but\nthey are not _them_!\"\n\n\"And now they have gone on to the city?\" Sssuri probed.\n\n\"It was the way their ship flew.\"\n\n\"Like me,\" Dalgard repeated, and then the truth which might lie behind\nthat exploded within his brain. \"Terrans!\" he breathed the word. Men\nof Pax perhaps who had come to hunt down the outlaws who had\nsuccessfully eluded their rule on earth? But how had the colonists\nbeen traced? And why? Or were they other fugitives like themselves? So\nmuch, so very much of what the colonists should know of their past\nhad been erased during the time of the Great Sickness twenty years\nafter their landing. Then three fourths of the original immigrants had\ndied. Only the children of the second generation and a handful of\nweakened Elders had remained. Knowledge was lost and some distorted by\nfailing memories, old skills were gone. But if the new Terrans were in\nthat city.... He had to know--to know and be able to warn his people.\nFor the darkness of Pax was a memory they had _not_ lost!\n\n\"I must see them,\" he said.\n\n\"That is true. And only you can tell us what manner of folk these\nstrangers be,\" the merman chief agreed. \"Therefore you shall go ashore\nwith my warriors and look upon them--to tell us the truth. Also we\nmust learn what _they_ do here.\"\n\nIt was decided that using waterways known to the merpeople, one which\nDalgard could also take wearing the diving equipment, a scouting party\nwould head shoreward the next day, with the river itself providing the\nentrance into the heart of the forbidden territory.\n\n\n\n\n12\n\nALIEN PATROL\n\n\nRaf leaned back against the wall. Long since the actions of the aliens\nin the storage house had ceased to interest him, since they would not\nallow any of the Terrans to approach their plunder and he could not\nask questions. Lablet continued to follow the officer about, vainly\ntrying to understand his speech. And Hobart had taken his place by the\nupper entrance, his hand held stiffly across his body. The pilot knew\nthat the captain was engaged in photographing all this activity with a\nwristband camera, hoping to make something of it later.\n\nBut Raf's own inclination was to slip out and do some exploring in\nthose underground corridors beyond. Having remained where he was for a\nwearisome time, he noticed that his presence was now taken for granted\nby the hurrying aliens who brushed about him intent upon their\nassignments. And slowly he began to edge along the wall toward the\nother doorway. Once he froze as the officer strode by, Lablet in\nattendance. But what the painted warrior was looking for was a crystal\nbox on a shelf to Raf's left. When he had pointed that out to an\nunderling he was off again, and Raf was free to continue his crab's\nprogress.\n\nLuck favored him, for, as he reached the moment when he must duck out\nthe portal, there was a sudden flurry at the other end of the chamber\nwhere four of the aliens, under a volley of orders, strove to move an\nunwieldy piece of intricate machinery.\n\nRaf dodged around the door and flattened back against the wall of the\nroom beyond. The moving bars of sun said that it was midday. But the\nroom was empty save for the despoiled carcass, and there was no sign\nof the aliens who had been sent out to scout.\n\nThe Terran ran lightly down the narrow room to the second door, which\ngave on the lower pits beneath and the way to the arena. As he took\nthat dark way, he drew his stun gun. Its bolt was intended to render\nthe victim unconscious, not to kill. But what effect it might have on\nthe giant reptiles was a question he hoped he would not be forced to\nanswer, and he paused now and then to listen.\n\nThere were sounds, deceptive sounds. Noises as regular as footfalls,\nlike a distant padded running. The aliens returning? Or the things\nthey had gone to hunt? Raf crept on--out into the sunshine which\nfilled the arena.\n\nFor the first time he studied the enclosure and recognized it for what\nit was--a place in which savage and bloody entertainments could be\nprovided for the population of the city--and it merely confirmed his\nopinion of the aliens and all their ways.\n\nThe temptation to explore the city was strong. He eyed the grilles\nspeculatively. They could be climbed--he was sure of that. Or he could\ntry some other of the various openings about the sanded area. But as\nhe hesitated over his choice, he heard something from behind. This was\nno unidentifiable noise, but a scream which held both terror and pain.\nIt jerked him around, sent him running back almost before he thought.\n\nBut the scream did not come again. However there were other\nsounds--snuffing whines--a scrabbling--\n\nRaf found himself in the round room walled by the old prison cells.\nStabs of light shot through the gloom, thrusting into a roiling black\nmass which had erupted through one of the entrances and now held at\nbay one of the alien warriors. Three or four of the black creatures\nringed the alien in, moving with speed that eluded the bolts of light\nhe shot from his weapon, keeping him cornered and from escape, while\ntheir fellows worried another alien limp and defenseless on the floor.\n\nIt was impossible to align the sights of his stun gun with any of\nthose flitting shadows, Raf discovered. They moved as quickly as a\nripple across a pond. He snapped the button on the hand grip to\n\"spray\" and proceeded to use the full strength of the charge across\nthe group on the floor.\n\nFor several seconds he was afraid that the stun ray would prove to\nhave no effect on the alien metabolism of the creatures, for their\nweaving, tearing activity did not cease. Then one after another\ndropped away from the center mass and lay unmoving on the floor.\nSeeing that he could control them, Raf turned his attention to the\nothers about the standing warrior.\n\nAgain he sent the spray wide, and they subsided. As the last curled on\nthe pavement, the alien moved forward and, with a snarl, deliberately\nturned the full force of his beam weapon on each of the attackers. But\nRaf plowed on through the limp pile to the warrior they had pulled\ndown.\n\nThere was no hope of helping him--death had come with a wide tear in\nhis throat. Raf averted his eyes from the body. The other warrior was\nmethodically killing the stunned animals. And his action held such\nvicious cruelty that Raf did not want to watch.\n\nWhen he looked again at the scene, it was to find the narrow barrel of\nthe strange weapon pointed at him. Paying no attention to his dead\ncomrade, the alien was advancing on the Terran as if in Raf he saw\nonly another enemy to be burned down.\n\nMoves drilled in him by long hours of weary practice came almost\nautomatically to the pilot. The stun gun faced the alien rifle sight\nto sight. And it seemed that the warrior had developed a hearty\nrespect for the Terran arm during the past few minutes, for he slipped\nhis weapon back to the crook of his arm, as if he did not wish Raf to\nguess he had used it to threaten.\n\nThe pilot had no idea what to do now. He did not wish to return to the\nstorehouse. And he believed that the alien was not going to let him go\noff alone. The ferocity of the creatures now heaped about them had\nbeen sobering, an effective warning against venturing alone in these\nunderground ways.\n\nHis dilemma was solved by the entrance of a party of aliens from\nanother doorway. They stopped short at the sight of the battlefield,\nand their leader descended upon the surviving scout for an\nexplanation, which was made with gestures Raf was able to translate in\npart.\n\nThe alien had been far down one of the neighboring corridors with his\ndead companion when they had been tracked by the pack and had managed\nto reach this point before they were attacked. For some reason Raf\ncould not understand, the aliens had preferred to flee rather than to\nface the menace of the hunters. But they had not been fast enough and\nhad been trapped here. The gesturing hands then indicated Raf, acted\nout the battle which had ensued.\n\nCrossing to the Terran pilot, the alien officer held out his hand and\nmotioned for Raf to surrender his weapon. The pilot shook his head.\nDid they think him so simple that he would disarm himself at the mere\nasking? Especially since the warrior had rounded on him like that only\na few moments before? Nor did he holster his gun. If they wanted to\ntake it by force just let them try such a move!\n\nHis determination to resist must have gotten across to the leader, for\nhe did not urge obedience to his orders. Instead he waved the Terran\nto join his own party. And since Raf had no reason not to, he did.\nLeaving the dead, both alien and enemy, where they had fallen, the\nwarriors took another way out of the underground maze, a way which\nbrought them out into a street running to the river.\n\nHere the party spread out, paying close attention to the pavement, as\nif they were engaged in tracking something. Raf saw impressed in one\npatch of earth a print dried by the sun, left by one of the reptiles.\nAnd there were smaller tracks he could not identify. All were\ninspected carefully, but none of them appeared to be what his\ncompanions sought.\n\nThey trotted up and down along the river bank, and from what he had\nalready observed concerning the aliens, Raf thought that the leader,\nat least, was showing exasperation and irritation. They expected to\nfind something--it was not there--but it had to be! And they were fast\nreaching the point where they wanted to produce it themselves to\njustify the time spent in hunting for it.\n\nRuthlessly they rayed to death any creature their dragnet drove into\nthe open, leaving feebly kicking bodies of the furry, long-legged\nbeasts Raf had first seen after the landing of the spacer. He could\nnot understand the reason for such wholesale extermination, since\ncertainly the rabbitlike rodents were harmless.\n\nIn the end they gave up their quest and circled back to come out near\nthe field where the flitter and the globe rested. When the Terran\nflyer came into sight, Raf left the party and hurried toward it.\nSoriki waved a welcoming hand.\n\n\"'Bout time one of you showed up. What are they doing--toting half the\ncity here to load into that thing?\"\n\nRaf looked along the other's pointing finger. A party of aliens towing\na loaded dolly were headed for the gaping hatch of the globe, while a\nsecond party and an empty conveyance passed them on the way back to\nthe storehouse.\n\n\"They are emptying a warehouse, or trying to.\"\n\n\"Well, they act as if Old Time himself was heating their tails with a\nrocket flare. What's the big hurry?\"\n\n\"Somebody's been here.\" Swiftly Raf outlined what he had seen in the\ncity, and ended by describing the hunt in which he had taken an\nunwilling part. \"I'm hungry,\" he ended and went to burrow for a ration\npack.\n\n\"So,\" mused Soriki as Raf chewed the stuff which never had the flavor\nof fresh provisions, \"somebody's been trying to beat the painted lads\nto it. The furry people?\"\n\n\"It was a spear shaft they found broken with the dead lizard thing,\"\nRaf commented. \"And some of those on the island were armed with\nspears--\"\n\n\"Must be good fighters if, armed with spears, they brought down a\nreptile as big as you say. It was big, wasn't it?\"\n\nRaf stared at the city, a square of half-eaten concentrate in his\nfingers. Yes, that was a puzzler. The dead monster would be more than\n_he_ would care to tackle without a blaster. And yet it was dead, with\na smashed spear for evidence as to the manner of killing.\n\nAll those others dead in the arena, too. How large a party had invaded\nthe city? Where were they now?\n\n\"I'd like to know,\" he was speaking more to himself than to the\ncom-tech, \"how they _did_ do it. No other bodies--\"\n\n\"Those could have been taken away by their friends,\" Soriki\nsuggested. \"But if they're still hanging about, I hope they won't\nbelieve that we're bigger and better editions of the painted lads. I\ndon't want a spear through me!\"\n\nRaf, remembering the maze of lanes and streets--bordered by buildings\nwhich could provide hundreds of lurking places for attackers--which he\nhad threaded with the confidence of ignorance earlier that day, began\nto realize why the aliens had been so nervous. Had a sniper with a\nblast rifle been stationed at a vantage point somewhere on the roofs\ntoday none of them would ever have returned to this field. And even a\nfew spacemen with good cover and accurate throwing aim could have cut\ndown their number a quarter or a third. He was developing a strong\ndistaste for those structures. And he had no intention of returning to\nthe city again.\n\nHe lounged about with Soriki for the rest of the afternoon, watching\nthe ceaseless activity of the aliens. It was plain that they were\nintent upon packing into the cargo hold of their ship everything they\ncould wrest from the storage house. As if they must make this trip\ncount double. Was that because they had discovered that their treasure\nhouse was no longer inviolate?\n\nIn the late afternoon Hobart and Lablet came back with one of the work\nteams. Lablet was still excited, full of what he had seen, deduced, or\nguessed during the day. But the captain was very quiet and sober, and\nhe unstrapped the wrist camera as soon as he reached the flitter,\nturning it over to Soriki.\n\n\"Run that through the ditto,\" he ordered. \"I want two records as soon\nas we can get them!\"\n\nThe com-tech's eyebrows slid up, \"Think you might lose one, sir?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Anyway, we'll play it safe with double records.\" He\naccepted the ration pack Raf had brought out for him. But he did not\nunwrap it at once; instead he stared at the globe, digging the toe of\nhis space boot into the soil as if he were grinding something to\npowder.\n\n\"They're operating under full jets,\" he commented. \"As if they were\nabout due to be jumped--\"\n\n\"They told us that this was territory now held by their enemies,\"\nLablet reminded him.\n\n\"And who are these mysterious enemies?\" the captain wanted to know.\n\"Those animals back on that island?\"\n\nRaf wanted to say yes, but Lablet broke in with a question concerning\nwhat had happened to him, and the pilot outlined his adventures of the\nday, not forgetting to give emphasis to the incident in the celled\nroom when the newly rescued alien had turned upon him.\n\n\"Naturally they are suspicious,\" Lablet countered, \"but for a people\nwho lack space flight, I find them unusually open-minded and ready to\naccept us, strange as we must seem to them.\"\n\n\"Ditto done, Captain.\" Soriki stepped out of the flitter, the wrist\ncamera dangling from his fingers.\n\n\"Good.\" But Hobart did not buckle the strap about his arm once more,\nneither did he pay any attention to Lablet. Instead, apparently coming\nto some decision, he swung around to face Raf.\n\n\"You went out with that scouting party today. Think you could join\nthem again, if you see them moving for another foray?\"\n\n\"I could try.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Soriki chuckled, \"they couldn't do any more than pop him back\nat us. What do you think about them, sir? Are they fixing to blast\nus?\"\n\nBut the captain refused to be drawn. \"I'd just like to have a record\nof any more trips they make.\" He handed the camera to Raf. \"Put that\non and don't forget to trigger it if you do go. I don't believe\nthey'll go out tonight. They aren't too fond of being out in the open\nin darkness. We saw that last night. But keep an eye on them in the\nmorning--\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\" Raf buckled on the wristband. He wished that Hobart would\nexplain just what he was to look for, but the captain appeared to\nthink that he had made everything perfectly plain. And he walked off\nwith Lablet, heading to the globe, as if there was nothing more to be\nsaid.\n\nSoriki stretched. \"I'd say we'd better take it watch and watch,\" he\nsaid slowly. \"The captain may think that they won't go off in the\ndark, but we don't know everything about them. Suppose we just keep an\neye on them, and then you'll be ready to tail--\"\n\nRaf laughed. \"Tailing would be it. I don't think I'll have a second\ninvitation and if I get lost--\"\n\nBut Soriki shook his head. \"That you won't. At least if you do--I'm\ngoing to make a homer out of you. Just tune in your helmet buzzer.\"\n\nIt needed a com-tech to think of a thing like that! A small adjustment\nto the earphones built into his helmet, and Soriki, operating the\nflitter com, could give him a guide as efficient as the spacer's\nradar! He need not fear being lost in the streets should he lose touch\nwith those he was spying upon.\n\n\"You're on course!\" He pulled off his helmet and then glanced up to\nfind Soriki smiling at him.\n\n\"Oh, we're not such a bad collection of space bums. Maybe you'll find\nthat out someday, boy. They breezed you into this flight right out of\ntraining, didn't they?\"\n\n\"Just about,\" Raf admitted cautiously, on guard as ever against\nrevealing too much of himself. After all, his experience was part of\nhis record, which was open to anyone on board the spacer. Yes, he was\nnot a veteran; they must all know that.\n\n\"Someday you'll lose a little of that suspicion,\" the com-tech\ncontinued, \"and find out it isn't such a bad old world after all.\nHere, let's see if you're on the beam.\" He took the helmet out of\nRaf's hands and, drawing a small case of delicate instruments from his\nbelt pouch, unscrewed the ear plates of the com device and made some\nadjustments. \"Now that will keep you on the buzzer without bursting\nyour eardrums. Try it.\"\n\nRaf fastened on the helmet and started away from the flitter. The\nbuzzer which he had expected to roar in his ears was only a faint\ndrone, and above it he could easily hear other sounds. Yet it was\nthere, and he tested it by a series of loops away from the flyer. Each\ntime as he came on the true beam he was rewarded by a deepening of the\nmuted note. Yes, he could be a homer with that, and at the same time\nbe alert to any other noise in his vicinity.\n\n\"That's it!\" He paid credit where it was due. But he was unable to\nbreak his long habit of silence. Something within him still kept him\nwary of the com-tech's open friendliness.\n\nNone of the aliens approached the flitter as the shadows began to draw\nin. The procession of moving teams stopped, and most of the\nburden-bearing warriors withdrew to the globe and stayed there. Soriki\npointed this out.\n\n\"They're none too sure, themselves. Look as if they are closing up for\nthe night.\"\n\nIndeed it did. The painted men had hauled up their ramp, the hatch in\nthe globe closed with a definite snap. Seeing that, the com-tech\nlaughed.\n\n\"We have a double reason for a strict watch. Suppose whatever they've\nbeen looking for jumps _us_? They're not worrying over that it now\nappears.\"\n\nSo they took watch and watch, three hours on and three hours in rest.\nWhen it came Raf's turn he did not remain sitting in the flitter,\nlistening to the com-tech's heavy breathing, but walked a circular\nbeat which took him into the darkness of the night in a path about the\nflyer. Overhead the stars were sharp and clear, glittering gem points.\nBut in the dead city no light showed, and he was sure that no aliens\ncamped there tonight.\n\nHe was sleeping when Soriki's grasp on his shoulder brought him to\nthat instant alertness he had learned on field maneuvers half the\nGalaxy away.\n\n\"Business,\" the com-tech's voice was not above a whisper as he leaned\nover the pilot. \"I think they are on the move.\"\n\nThe light was the pale gray of pre-dawn. Raf pulled himself up with\ncaution to look at the globe. The com-tech was right. A dark opening\nshowed on the alien ship; they had released their hatch. He fastened\nhis tunic, buckled on his equipment belt and helmet, strapped his\nboots.\n\n\"Here they come!\" Soriki reported. \"One--two--five--no, six of them.\nAnd they're heading for the city. No dollies with them, but they're\nall armed.\"\n\nTogether the Terrans watched that patrol of alien warriors, their\nattitude suggesting that they hoped to pass unseen, hurry toward the\ncity. Then Raf slipped out of the flyer. His dark clothing in this\nlight should render him largely invisible.\n\nSoriki waved encouragingly and the pilot answered with a quick salute\nbefore he sped after his quarry.\n\n\n\n\n13\n\nA HOUND IS LOOSED\n\n\nDalgard's feet touched gravel; he waded cautiously to the bank, where\na bridge across the river made a concealing shadow on the water. None\nof the mermen had accompanied him this far. Sssuri, as soon as his\nhuman comrade had started for the storage city, had turned south to\nwarn and rally the tribes. And the merpeople of the islands had\ninstituted a loose chain of communication, which led from a clump of\nwater reeds some two miles back to the seashore, and so out to the\nislands. Better than any of the now legendary coms of his Terran\nforefathers were these minds of the spies in hiding, who could pick\nup the racing thoughts beamed to them and pass them on to their\nfellows.\n\nAlthough there were no signs of life about the city, Dalgard moved\nwith the same care that he would have used in penetrating a\nsnake-devil's lair. In the first hour of dawn he had contacted a\nhopper. The small beast had been frightened almost out of coherent\nthought, and Dalgard had had to spend some time in allaying that\nterror to get a fractional idea of what might be going on in this\ncountryside.\n\nDeath--the hopper's terror had come close to insanity. Killers had\ncome out of the sky, and they were burning--burning--All living things\nwere fleeing before them. And in that moment Dalgard had been forced\nto give up his plan for an unseen spy ring, which would depend upon\nthe assistance of the animals. His information must come via his own\neyes and ears.\n\nSo he kept on, posting the last of the mermen in his mental relay well\naway from the city, but swimming upstream himself. Now that he was\nhere, he could see no traces of the invaders. Since they could not\nhave landed their sky ships in the thickly built-up section about the\nriver, it must follow that their camp lay on the outskirts of the\nmetropolis.\n\nHe pulled himself out of the water. Bow and arrows had been left\nbehind with the last merman; he had only his sword-knife for\nprotection. But he was not there to fight, only to watch and wait.\nPressing the excess moisture out of his scant clothing, he crept along\nthe shore. If the strangers were using the streets, it might be well\nto get above them. Speculatively he eyed the buildings about him as he\nentered the city.\n\nDalgard continued to keep at street level for two blocks, darting from\ndoorway to shadowed doorway, alert not only to any sound but to any\nflicker of thought. He was reasonably sure, however, that the aliens\nwould be watching and seeking only for the merpeople. Though they\nwere not telepathic as their former slaves, Those Others were able to\nsense the near presence of a merman, so that the sea people dared not\ncommunicate while within danger range of the aliens without betraying\nthemselves. It was the fact that he was of a different species,\ntherefore possibly immune to such detection, which had brought Dalgard\ninto the city.\n\nHe studied the buildings ahead. Among them was a cone-shaped structure\nwhich might have been the base of a tower that had had all stories\nabove the third summarily amputated. It was ornamented with a series\nof bands in high relief, bands bearing the color script of the aliens.\nThis was the nearest answer to his problem. However the scout did not\nmove toward it until after a long moment of both visual and mental\ninspection of his surroundings. But that inspection did not reach some\ntwelve streets away where another crouched to watch. Dalgard ran\nlightly to the tower at the same moment that Raf shifted his weight\nfrom one foot to the other behind a parapet as he spied upon the knot\nof aliens gathered below him in the street....\n\nThe pilot had followed them since that early morning hour when Soriki\nhad awakened him. Not that the chase had led him far in distance. Most\nof the time he had spent in waiting just as he was doing now. At first\nhe had believed that they were searching for something, for they had\nventured into several buildings, each time to emerge conferring, only\nto hunt out another and invade it. Since they always returned with\nempty hands, he could not believe that they were out for further loot.\nAlso they moved with more confidence than they had shown the day\nbefore. That confidence led Raf to climb above them so that he could\nwatch them with less chance of being seen in return.\n\nIt had been almost noon when they had at last come into this section.\nIf two of them had not remained idling on the street as the long\nmoments crept by, he would have believed that they had given him the\nslip, that he was now a cat watching a deserted mouse hole. But at the\nmoment they were coming back, carrying something.\n\nRaf leaned as far over the parapet as he dared, trying to catch a\nbetter look at the flat, boxlike object two of them had deposited on\nthe pavement. Whatever it was either needed some adjustment or they\nwere attempting to open it with poor success, for they had been busied\nabout it for what seemed an unusually long time. The pilot licked dry\nlips and wondered what would happen if he swung down there and just\nwalked in for a look-see. That idea was hardening into resolution when\nsuddenly the group below drew quickly apart, leaving the box sitting\nalone as they formed a circle about it.\n\nThere was a puff of white vapor, a protesting squawk, and the thing\nbegan to rise in jerks as if some giant in the sky was pulling at it\nspasmodically. Raf jumped back. Before he could return to his vantage\npoint, he saw it rise above the edge of the parapet, reach a level\nfive or six feet above his head, hovering there. It no longer climbed;\ninstead it began to swing back and forth, describing in each swing a\nwider stretch of space.\n\nBack and forth--watching it closely made him almost dizzy. What was\nits purpose? Was it a detection device, to locate him? Raf's hand went\nto his stun gun. What effect its rays might have on the box he had no\nway of knowing, but at that moment he was sorely tempted to try the\nbeam out, with the oscillating machine as his target.\n\nThe motion of the floating black thing became less violent, its swoop\nsmoother as if some long-idle motor was now working more as its\nbuilders had intended it to perform. The swing made wide circles,\ngraceful glides as the thing explored the air currents.\n\nSearching--it was plainly searching for something. Just as plainly it\ncould not be hunting for him, for his presence on that roof would\nhave been uncovered at once. But the machine was--it must be--out of\nsight of the warriors in the street. How could they keep in touch with\nit if it located what they sought? Unless it had some built-in\nsignaling device.\n\nDetermined to keep it in sight, Raf risked a jump from the parapet of\nthe building where he had taken cover to another roof beyond, running\nlightly across that as the hound bobbed and twisted, away from its\nmasters, out across the city in pursuit of some mysterious quarry....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe climb which had looked so easy from the street proved to be more\ndifficult when Dalgard actually made it. His hours of swimming in the\nriver, the night of broken rest, had drained his strength more than he\nhad known. He was panting as he flattened himself against the wall,\nhis feet on one of the protruding bands of colored carving, content to\nrest before reaching for another hold. To all appearances the city\nabout him was empty of life and, except for the certainty of the\nmerpeople that the alien ship and its strange companion had landed\nhere, he would have believed that he was on a fruitless quest.\n\nGrimly, his lower lip caught between his teeth, the scout began to\nclimb once more, the sun hot on his body, drawing sweat to dampen his\nforehead and his hands. He did not pause again but kept on until he\nstood on the top of the shortened tower. The roof here was not flat\nbut sloped inward to a cuplike depression, where he could see the\noutline of a round opening, perhaps a door of sorts. But at that\nmoment he was too winded to do more than rest.\n\nThere was a drowsiness in that air. He was tempted to curl up where he\nsat and turn his rest into the sleep his body craved. It was in that\nsecond or so of time when he was beginning to relax, to forget the\ntenseness which had gripped him since his return to this ill-omened\nplace, that he touched--\n\nDalgard stiffened as if one of his own poisoned arrows had pricked his\nskin. Rapport with the merpeople, with the hoppers and the runners,\nwas easy, familiar. But this was no such touch. It was like contacting\nsomething which was icy cold, inimical from birth, something which he\ncould never meet on a plain of understanding. He snapped off mind\nquesting at that instant and huddled where he was, staring up into the\nblank turquoise of the sky, waiting--for what he did not know. Unless\nit was for that other mind to follow and ferret out his hiding place,\nto turn him inside out and wring from him everything he ever knew or\nhoped to learn.\n\nAs time passed in long breaths, and he was not so invaded, he began to\nthink that while he had been aware of contact, the other had not. And,\nemboldened, he sent out a tracer. Unconsciously, as the tracer groped,\nhe pivoted his body. It lay--there!\n\nAt the second touch he withdrew in the same second, afraid of\nrevelation. But as he returned to probe delicately, ready to flee at\nthe first hint that the other suspected, his belief in temporary\nsafety grew. To his disappointment he could not pierce beyond the\nouter wall of identity. There was a living creature of a high rate of\nintelligence, a creature alien to his own thought processes, not too\nfar away. And though his attempts to enter into closer communication\ngrew bolder, he could not crack the barrier which kept them apart. He\nhad long known that contact with the merpeople was on a lower, a far\nlower, band than they used when among themselves, and that they were\nonly able to \"talk\" with the colonists because for generations they\nhad exchanged thought symbols with the hoppers and other unlike\nspecies. They had been frank in admitting that while Those Others\ncould be aware of their presence through telepathic means, they could\nnot exchange thoughts. So now, his own band, basically strange to this\nplanet, might well go unnoticed by the once dominant race of Astra.\n\nThey--or him--or it--were over in that direction, Dalgard was sure of\nthat. He faced northwest and saw for the first time, about a mile\naway, the swelling of the globe. If the strange flyer reported by the\nmerpeople was beside it, he could not distinguish it from this\ndistance. Yet he was sure the mind he had located was closer to him\nthan that ship.\n\nThen he saw it--a black object rising by stiff jerks into the air as\nif it were being dragged upward against its inclination. It was too\nsmall to be a flyer of any sort. Long ago the colonists had patched\ntogether a physical description of Those Others which had assured them\nthat the aliens were close to them in general characteristics and\nsize. No, that couldn't be carrying a passenger. Then what--or why?\n\nThe object swung out in a gradually widening circle. Dalgard held to\nthe walled edge of the roof. Something within him suggested that it\nwould be wiser to seek some less open space, that there was danger in\nthat flying box. He released his hold and went to the trap door. It\ntook only a minute to fit his fingers into round holes and tug. Its\nstubborn resistance gave, and stale air whooshed out in his face as it\nopened.\n\nIn his battle with the door Dalgard had ignored the box, so he was\nstartled when, with a piercing whistle, almost too high on the scale\nfor his ears to catch, the thing suddenly swooped into a screaming\ndive, apparently heading straight for him. Dalgard flung himself\nthrough the trap door, luckily landing on one of the steep, curved\nramps. He lost his balance and slid down into the dark, trying to\nbrake his descent with his hands, the eerie screech of the box\ntrumpeting in his ears.\n\nThere was little light in this section of the cone building, and he\nwas brought up with bruising force against a blank wall two floors\nbelow where he had so unceremoniously entered. As he lay in the dark\ntrying to gasp some breath back into his lungs, he could still hear\nthe squeal. Was it summoning? There was no time to be lost in getting\naway.\n\nOn his hands and knees the scout crept along what must have been a\nshort hall until he found a second descending ramp, this one less\nsteep than the first, so that he was able to keep to his feet while\nusing it. And the gloom of the next floor was broken by odd scraps of\nlight which showed through pierced portions of the decorative bands.\nThe door was there, a locking bar across it.\n\nDalgard did not try to shift that at once, although he laid his hands\nupon it. If the box was a hound for hunters, had it already drawn its\nmasters to this building? Would he open the door only to be faced by\nthe danger he wished most to avoid? Desperately he tried to probe with\nthe mind touch. But he could not find the alien band. Was that because\nthe hunters could control their minds as they crept up? His kind knew\nso little of Those Others, and the merpeople's hatred of their ancient\nmasters was so great that they tended to avoid rather than study them.\n\nThe scout's sixth sense told him that nothing waited outside. But the\nlonger he lingered with that beacon overhead the slimmer his chances\nwould be. He must move and quickly. Sliding back the bar, he opened\nthe door a crack and looked out into a deserted street. There was\nanother doorway to take shelter in some ten feet or so farther along,\nbeyond that an alley wall overhung by a balcony. He marked these\nrefuges and went out to make his first dash to safety.\n\nNothing stirred, and he sprinted. There came again that piercing\nshriek to tear his ears as the floating box dived at him. He swerved\naway from the doorway to dart on under the balcony, sure now that he\nmust keep moving, but under cover so that the black thing could not\npounce. If he could find some entrance into the underground ways such\nas those that ran from the arena--But now he was not even sure in\nwhich direction the arena stood, and he dared no longer climb to look\nover the surrounding territory.\n\nHe touched the alien mind! They _were_ moving in, following the lead\nof their hound. He must not allow himself to be cornered. The scout\nfought down a surge of panic, attempted to battle the tenseness which\ntied his nerves. He must not run mindlessly either. That was probably\njust what they wanted him to do. So he stood under the balcony and\ntried not to listen to the shrilling of the box as he studied the\nstrip of alley.\n\nThis was a narrow side way, and he had not made the wisest of choices\nin entering it, for not much farther ahead it was bordered with smooth\nwalls protecting what had once been gardens. He had no way of telling\nwhether the box would actually attack him if he were caught in the\nopen--to put that to the test was foolhardy--nor could he judge its\nspeed of movement.\n\nThe walls.... A breeze which blew up the lane carried with it the\nsmell of the river. There was a slim chance that it might end in\nwater, and he had a feeling that if he could reach the stream he would\nbe able to baffle the hunters. He did not have long to make up his\nmind--the aliens were closer.\n\nLightly Dalgard ran under the length of the balcony, turned sharply as\nhe reached the end of its protecting cover, and leaped. His fingers\ngripped the ornamental grillwork, and he was able to pull himself up\nand over to the narrow runway. A canopy was still over his head, and\nthere came a bump against it as the baffled box thumped. So it would\ntry to knock him off if it could get the chance! That was worth\nknowing.\n\nHe looked over the walls. They guarded masses of tangled vegetation\ngrown through years of neglect into thick mats. And those promised a\nway of escape, if he could reach them. He studied the windows, the\ndoor opening onto the balcony. With the hilt of his sword-knife he\nsmashed his way into the house, to course swiftly through the rooms\nto the lower floor, and find the entrance to the garden.\n\nFacing that briary jungle on the ground level was a little daunting.\nTo get through it would be a matter of cutting his way. Could he do it\nand escape that bobbing, shrilling thing in the air? A trace of\npebbled path gave him a ghost of a chance, and he knew that these\nshrubs tended to grow upward and not mass until they were several feet\nabove the ground.\n\nTrusting to luck, Dalgard burrowed into the green mass, slashing with\nhis knife at anything which denied him entrance. He was swallowed up\nin a strange dim world wherein dead shrubs and living were twined\ntogether to form a roof, cutting off the light and heat of the sun.\nFrom the sour earth, sliming his hands and knees, arose an\noverpowering stench of decay and disturbed mold. In the dusk he had to\nwait for his eyes to adjust before he could mark the line of the old\npath he had taken for his guide.\n\nFortunately, after the first few feet, he discovered that the tunneled\npath was less obstructed than he had feared. The thick mat overhead\nhad kept the sun from the ground and killed off all the lesser plants\nso that it was possible to creep along a fairly open strip. He was\nconscious of the chitter of insects, but no animals lingered here.\nUnder him the ground grew more moist and the mold was close to mud in\nconsistency. He dared to hope that this meant he was either\napproaching the river or some garden stream feeding into the larger\nflood.\n\nSomewhere the squeal of the hunter kept up a steady cry, but, unless\nthe foliage above him was distorting that sound, Dalgard believed that\nthe box was no longer directly above him. Had he in some way thrown it\noff his trail?\n\nHe found his stream, a thread of water, hardly more than a series of\nscummy pools with the vegetation still meeting almost solidly over it.\nAnd it brought him to a wall with a drain through which he was sure\nhe could crawl. Disliking to venture into that cramped darkness, but\nseeing no other way out, the scout squirmed forward in slime and muck,\nfeeling the rasp of rough stone on his shoulders as he made his worm's\nprogress into the unknown.\n\nOnce he was forced to halt and, in the dark, loosen and pick out\nstones embedded in the mud bottom narrowing the passage. On the other\nside of that danger point, he was free to wriggle on. Could the box\ntrace him now? He had no idea of the principle on which it operated;\nhe could only hope.\n\nThen before him he saw the ghostly gray of light and squirmed with\nrenewed vigor--to be faced then by a grille, beyond which was the open\nworld. Once more his knife came into use as he pried and dug at the\nbarrier. He worked for long moments until the grille splashed out into\nthe sluggish current a foot or so below, and then he made ready to\nlower himself into the same flood.\n\nIt was only because he was a trained hunter that he avoided death in\nthat moment. Some instinct made him dodge even as he slipped through,\nand the hurtling black box did not strike true at the base of his\nbrain but raked along his scalp, tearing the flesh and sending him\ntumbling unconscious into the brown water.\n\n\n\n\n14\n\nTHE PRISONER\n\n\nRaf was two streets away from the circling box but still able to keep\nit in sight when its easy glide stopped, and, in a straight line, it\nswooped toward a roof emitting a shrill, rising whistle. It rose again\na few seconds later as if baffled, but it continued to hover at that\npoint, keening forth its warning. The pilot reached the next\nbuilding, but a street still kept him away from the conical structure\nabove which the box now hung.\n\nUndecided, he stayed where he was. Should he go down to street level\nand investigate? Before he had quite made up his mind he saw the\nforemost of the alien scouting party round into the thoroughfare below\nand move purposefully at the cone tower, weapons to the fore. Judging\nby their attitude, the box had run to earth there the prey they had\nbeen searching for.\n\nBut it wasn't to be so easy. With another eerie howl the machine\nsoared once more and bobbed completely over the cone to the street\nwhich must lie beyond it. Raf knew that he could not miss the end of\nthe chase and started on a detour along the roof tops which should\nbring him to a vantage point. By the time he had made that journey he\nfound himself on a warehouse roof which projected over the edge of the\nriver.\n\nFrom a point farther downstream a small boat was putting out. Two of\nthe aliens paddled while a third crouched in the bow. A second party\nwas picking its way along the bank some distance away, both groups\nseemingly heading toward a point a building or two to the left of the\none where Raf had taken cover.\n\nHe heard the shrilling of the box, saw it bobbing along a line toward\nthe river. But in that direction there was only a mass of green. The\nend to the weird chase came so suddenly that he was not prepared, and\nit was over before he caught a good look at the quarry. Something\nmoved down on the river bank and in that same instant the box hurtled\nearthward as might a spear. It struck, and the creature who had just\ncrawled out--out of the ground as far as Raf could see--toppled into\nthe stream. As the waters closed over the body, the box slued around\nand came to rest on the bank. The party in the boat sent their small\ncraft flying toward the spot where the crawler had sunk.\n\nOne of the paddlers abandoned his post and slipped over the side,\ndiving into the oily water. He made two tries before he was successful\nand came to the surface with the other in tow. They did not try to\nheave the unconscious captive into the boat, merely kept the lolling\nhead above water as they turned downstream once more and vanished from\nRaf's sight around the end of a pier, while the second party on the\nbank reclaimed the now quiet box and went off.\n\nBut Raf had seen enough to freeze him where he was for a moment. The\ncreature which had popped out of the ground only to be struck by the\nbox and knocked into the river--he would take oath on the fact that it\nwas not one of the furred animals he had seen on the sea island.\nSurely it had been smooth-skinned, not unlike the aliens in\nconformation--one of their own kind they had been hunting down, a\ncriminal or a rebel?\n\nPuzzled, the pilot moved along from roof to roof, trying to pick up\nthe trail of the party in the boat, but as far as he could now see,\nthe river was bare. If they had come ashore anywhere along here, they\nhad simply melted into the city. At last he was forced to use the\nhoming beam, and it guided him back across the deserted metropolis to\nthe field.\n\nThere was still activity about the globe; they were bringing in the\nloot from the warehouse, but Lablet and Hobart stood by the flitter.\nAs the pilot came up to them, the captain looked up eagerly.\n\n\"What happened?\"\n\nRaf sensed that there had been some change during his absence, that\nHobart was looking to him for an explanation to make clear happenings\nhere. He told his story of the hunt and its ending, the capture of the\nstranger. Lablet nodded as he finished.\n\n\"That is the reason for this, you may depend upon it, Captain. One of\ntheir own people is at the bottom of it.\"\n\n\"Of what?\" Raf wanted to ask, but Soriki did it for him.\n\nHobart smiled grimly. \"We are all traveling back together. Take off in\nthe early morning. For some reason they wanted us out of the globe in\na hurry--practically shoved us out half an hour ago.\"\n\nThough the Terrans kept a watch on the larger ship as long as the\nlight lasted, the darkness defeated them. They did not see the\nprisoner being taken aboard. Yet none of them doubted that sometime\nduring the dusky hours it had been done.\n\nIt was barely dawn when the globe took off the next day, and Raf\nbrought the flitter up on its trail, heading westward into the sea\nwind. Below them the land held no signs of life. They swept over the\ndeserted, terraced city that was the gateway to the guarded interior,\nflew back over the line of sea islands. Raf climbed higher, not caring\nto go too near the island where the aliens had wrought their terrible\nvengeance on the trip out. And all four of the Terrans knew relief,\nthough they might not admit it to each other, when once more Soriki\nwas able to establish contact with the distant spacer.\n\n\"Turn north, sir?\" the pilot suggested. \"I could ride her beam in from\nhere--we don't have to follow them home.\" He wanted to do that so\nbadly it was almost a compulsion to make his hand move on the\ncontrols. And when Hobart did not answer at once, he was sure that the\ncaptain would give that very order, taking them out of the company of\nthose he had never trusted.\n\nBut Lablet spoiled that. \"We have their word, Captain. That anti-grav\nunit that they showed us last night alone--\"\n\nSo Hobart shook his head, and they meekly continued on the path set by\nthe globe across the ocean.\n\nAs the hours passed Raf's inner uneasiness grew. For some queer reason\nwhich he could not define to himself or explain to anyone else, he was\nnow possessed by an urgency to trail the globe which transcended and\nthen erased his dislike of the aliens. It was as if some appeal for\nhelp was being broadcast from the other ship, drawing him on. It was\nthen that he began to question his assumption that the prisoner was\none of them.\n\nOver and over again in his mind he tried to re-picture the capture as\nhe had witnessed it from the building just too far away and at\nslightly the wrong angle for a clear view. He would swear that the\nbody he had seen tumble into the flood had not been furred, that much\nhe was sure of. But clothing, yes, there had been clothing. Not--his\nmind suddenly produced that one scrap of memory--not the bandage\nwindings of the aliens. And hadn't the skin been fairer? Was there\nanother race on this continent, one they had not been told about?\n\nWhen they at last reached the shore of the western continent and\nfinally the home city of the aliens, the globe headed back to its\nberth, not in the roof cradle from which it had arisen, but sinking\ninto the building itself. Raf brought the flitter down on a roof as\nclose to the main holding of the painted people as he could get. None\nof the aliens came near them. It seemed that they were to be ignored.\nHobart paced along the flat roof, and Soriki sat in the flyer, nursing\nhis com, intent upon the slender thread of beam which tied them to the\nparent ship so many miles away.\n\n\"I don't understand it.\" Lablet's voice arose almost plaintively.\n\"They were so very persuasive about our accompanying them. They were\neager to have us see their treasures--\"\n\nHobart swung around. \"Somehow the balance of power has changed,\" he\nobserved, \"in their favor. I'd give anything to know more about that\nprisoner of theirs. You're sure it wasn't one of the furry people?\" he\nasked Raf, as if hoping against hope that the pilot would reply in\ndoubt.\n\n\"Yes, sir.\" Raf hesitated. Should he air his suspicions, that the\ncaptive was not of the same race as his captors either? But what\nproof had he beyond a growing conviction that he could not\nsubstantiate?\n\n\"A rebel, a thief--\" Lablet was ready to dismiss it as immaterial.\n\"Naturally they would be upset if they were having trouble with one of\ntheir own men. But to leave now, just when we are on the verge of new\ndiscoveries--That anti-gravity unit alone is worth our whole trip!\nImagine being able to return to earth with the principle of that!\"\n\n\"Imagine being able to return to earth with our skins on our backs,\"\nwas Soriki's whispered contribution. \"If we had the sense of a\nVenusian water nit, we'd blast out of here so quick our tail fumes'd\ntake off with us!\"\n\nPrivately Raf concurred, but the urge to know more about the\nmysterious prisoner was still pricking at him, until he, contrary to\nhis usual detachment, felt driven to discover all that he could. It\nwas almost, but Raf shied away from that wild idea, it was almost as\nif he were hearing a voiceless cry for aid, as if his mind was one of\nSoriki's coms tuned in on an unknown wave length. He was angrily\nimpatient with himself for that fantastic supposition. At the same\ntime, another part of his mind, as he walked to the edge of the roof\nand looked out at the buildings he knew were occupied by the aliens,\nwas busy examining the scene as if he intended to crawl about on roof\ntops on a second scouting expedition.\n\nFinally the rest decided that Lablet and Hobart were to try to\nestablish contact with the aliens once more. After they had gone, Raf\nopened a compartment in the flitter, the contents of which were his\nparticular care. He squatted on his heels and surveyed the neatly\nstowed objects inside thoughtfully. A survival kit depended a great\ndeal on the type of terrain in which the user was planning to\nsurvive--an aquatic world would require certain basic elements, a\nfrozen tundra others--but there were a few items common to every\nemergency, and those were now at Raf's fingertips. The blast bombs,\nsealed into their pexilod cases, guaranteed to stop all the attackers\nthat Terran explorers had so far met on and off worlds, a coil of rope\nhardly thicker than a strand of knitting yarn but of inconceivable\ntoughness and flexibility, an aid kit with endurance drugs and pep\npills which could keep a man on his feet and going long after food and\nwater failed. He had put them all in their separate compartments.\n\nFor a long moment he hunkered there, studying the assortment. And\nthen, almost as if some will other than his own was making a choice,\nhe reached out. The rope curled about his waist under his tunic so\ntautly that its presence could not be detected without a search, blast\nbombs went into the sealed seam pocket on his breast, and two flat\ncontainers with their capsules were tucked away in his belt pouch. He\nsnapped the door shut and got to his feet to discover Soriki watching\nhim. Only for a moment was Raf disconcerted. He knew that he would not\nbe able to explain why he must do what he was going to do. There was\nno reason why he should. Soriki, except for being a few years his\nsenior, had no authority over him. He was not under the com-tech's\norders.\n\n\"Another trip into the blue?\"\n\nThe pilot replied to that with a nod.\n\n\"Somehow, boy, I don't think anything's going to stop you, so why\nwaste my breath? But use your homer--and your eyes!\"\n\nRaf paused. There was an unmistakable note of friendliness in the\ncom-tech's warning. Almost he was tempted to try and explain. But how\ncould one make plain feelings for which there was no sensible reason?\nSometimes it was better to be quiet.\n\n\"Don't dig up more than you can rebury.\" That warning, in the slang\ncurrent when they had left Terra, was reassuring simply because it was\nof the earth he knew. Raf grinned. But he did not head toward the roof\nopening and the ramp inside the building. Instead he set a course he\nhad learned in the other city, swinging down to the roof of the\nneighboring structure, intent on working away from the inhabited\nsection of the town before he went into the streets.\n\nEither the aliens had not set any watch on the Terrans or else all\ntheir interest was momentarily engaged elsewhere. Raf, having gone\nthree or four blocks in the opposite direction to his goal, made his\nway through a silent, long-deserted building to the street without\nseeing any of the painted people. In his ear buzzed the comforting hum\nof the com, tying him with the flitter and so, in a manner, to safety.\n\nHe knew that the alien community had gathered in and around the\ncentral building they had visited. To his mind the prisoner was now\neither in the headquarters of the warriors, where the globe had been\nberthed, or had been taken to the administration building. Whether he\ncould penetrate either stronghold was a question Raf did not yet face\nsquarely.\n\nBut the odd something which tugged at him was as persistent as the\nbuzz in his earphones. And an idea came. If he _were_ obeying some\nstrange call for assistance, couldn't that in some way lead him to\nwhat he sought? The only difficulty was that he had no way of being\nmore receptive to the impulse than he now was. He could not use it as\na compass bearing.\n\nIn the end he chose the Center as his goal, reasoning that if the\nprisoner were to be interviewed by the leaders of the aliens, he would\nbe taken to those rulers, they would not go to him. From a concealed\nplace across from the open square on which the building fronted, the\npilot studied it carefully. It towered several stories above the\nsurrounding structures, to some of which it was tied by the ways above\nthe streets. To use one of those bridges as a means of entering the\nheadquarters would be entirely too conspicuous.\n\nAs far as the pilot was able to judge, there was only one entrance on\nthe ground level, the wide front door with the imposing\npicture-covered gates. Had he had free use of the flitter he might\nhave tried to swing down from the hovering machine after dark. But he\nwas sure that Captain Hobart would not welcome the suggestion.\n\nUnderground? There had been those ways in that other city, a city\nwhich, though built on a much smaller scale, was not too different in\ngeneral outline from this one. The idea was worth investigation.\n\nThe doorway, which had afforded him a shelter from which to spy out\nthe land, yielded to his push, and he went through three large rooms\non the ground floor, paying no attention to the strange groups of\nfurnishings, but seeking something else, which he had luck to find in\nthe last room, a ramp leading down.\n\nIt was in the underground that he made his first important find. They\nhad seen ground vehicles in the city, a few still in operation, but\nRaf had gathered that the fuel and extra parts for the machines were\nnow so scarce that they were only used in emergencies. Here, however,\nwas a means of transportation quite different, a tunnel through which\nran a ribbon of belt, wide enough to accommodate three or four\npassengers at once. It did not move, but when Raf dared to step out\nupon its surface, it swung under his weight. Since it ran in the\ngeneral direction of the Center he decided to use it. It trembled\nunder his tread, but he found that he could run along it making no\nsound.\n\nThe tunnel was not in darkness, for square plates set in the roof gave\na diffused violet light. However, not too far ahead, the light was\nbrighter, and it came from one side, not the roof. Another station on\nthis abandoned way? The pilot approached it with caution. If his bump\nof direction was not altogether off, this must be either below the\nCenter or very close to it.\n\nThe second station proved to be a junction where more than one of the\nelastic paths met. Though he crouched to listen for a long moment\nbefore venturing out into that open space, he could hear or see\nnothing which suggested that the aliens ever came down now to these\nlevels.\n\nThey had provided an upward ramp, and Raf climbed it, only to meet his\nfirst defeat at its top. For here was no opening to admit him to the\nground floor of what he hoped was the Center. Baffled by the smooth\nsurface over which he vainly ran his hands seeking for some clue to\nthe door, he decided that the aliens had, for some purpose of their\nown, walled off the lower regions. Discouraged, he returned to the\njunction level. But he was not content to surrender his plans so\neasily. Slowly he made a circuit of the platform, examining the walls\nand celling. He found an air shaft, a wide opening striking up into\nthe heart of the building above.\n\nIt was covered with a grille and it was above his reach but....\n\nRaf measured distances and planned his effort. The mouth of a junction\ntunnel ran less than two feet away from that grille. The opening was\noutlined with a ledge, which made a complete arch from the floor. He\nstopped and triggered the gravity plates in his space boots. Made to\ngive freedom of action when the ship was in free fall, they might just\nprovide a weak suction here. And they did! He was able to climb that\narch and, standing on it, work loose the grille which had been\nfashioned to open. Now....\n\nThe pilot flashed his hand torch up into that dark well. He had been\nright--and lucky! There were holds at regular intervals, something\nmust have been serviced by workmen in here. This was going to be easy.\nHis fingers found the first hold, and he wormed his way into the\nshaft.\n\nIt was not a difficult climb, for there were niches along the way\nwhere the alien mechanics who had once made repairs had either rested\nor done some of their work. And there were also grilles on each level\nwhich gave him at least a partial view of what lay beyond.\n\nHis guess was right; he recognized the main hall of the Center as he\nclimbed past the grid there, heading up toward those levels where he\nwas sure the leaders of the aliens had their private quarters. Twice\nhe paused to look in upon conferences of the gaudily wrapped and\npainted civilians, but, since he could not understand what they were\nsaying, it was a waste of time to linger.\n\nHe was some eight floors up when chance, luck, or that mysterious\nsomething which had brought him into this venture, led him to the\nright place at the right time. There was one of those niches, and he\nhad just settled into it, peering out through the grid, when he saw\nthe door at the opposite end of the room open and in marched a party\nof warriors with a prisoner in their midst.\n\nRaf's eyes went wide. It was the captive he sought; he had no doubt of\nthat. But who--what--was that prisoner?\n\nThis was no fur-covered half-animal, nor was it one of the\ndelicate-boned, decadent, painted creatures such as those who now\nringed in their captive. Though the man had been roughly handled and\nnow reeled rather than walked, Raf thought for one wild instant that\nit was one of the crew from the spacer. The light hair, showing rings\nof curl, the tanned face which, beneath dirt and bruises, displayed a\nvery familiar cast of features, the body hardly covered by rags of\nclothing--they were all so like those of his own kind that his mind at\nfirst refused to believe that this was _not_ someone he knew. Yet as\nthe party moved toward his hiding place he knew that he was facing a\ntotal stranger.\n\nStranger or no, Raf was sure that he saw a Terran. Had another ship\nmade a landing on this planet? One of those earlier ships whose fate\nhad been a mystery on their home world? Who--and when--and why? He\nhuddled as close to the grid as he could get, alert to the slightest\nmovement below as the prisoner faced his captors.\n\n\n\n\n15\n\nARENA\n\n\nThe dull pain which throbbed through Dalgard's skull with every beat\nof his heart was confusing, and it was hard to think clearly. But the\ncolony scout, soon after he had fought his way back to consciousness,\nhad learned that he was imprisoned somewhere in the globe ship. Just\nas he now knew that he had been brought across the sea from the\ncontinent on which Homeport was situated and that he had no hope of\nrescue.\n\nHe had seen little of his captors, and the guards, who had hustled him\nfrom one place of imprisonment to another, had not spoken to him, nor\nhad he tried to communicate with them. At first he had been too sick\nand confused, then too wary. These were clearly Those Others and the\nconditioning which had surrounded him from birth had instilled in him\na deep distrust of the former masters of Astra.\n\nNow Dalgard was more alert, and his being brought to this room in what\nwas certainly the center of the alien civilization made him believe\nthat he was about to meet the rulers of the enemy. So he stared\ncuriously about him as the guards jostled him through the door.\n\nOn a dais fashioned of heaped-up rainbow-colored pads were three\naliens, their legs folded under them at what seemed impossible angles.\nOne wore the black wrappings, the breastplate of the guards, but the\nother two had indulged their love of color in weird, eye-disturbing\ncombinations of shades in the bandages wrapping the thin limbs and\npaunchy bodies. They were, as far as he could see through the thick\nlayers of paint overlaying their skins, older than their officer\ncompanion. But nothing in their attitude suggested that age had\nmellowed them.\n\nDalgard was brought to stand before the trio as before a tribunal of\njudges. His sword-knife had been taken from his belt before he had\nregained his senses, his hands were twisted behind his back and locked\ntogether in a bar and hoop arrangement. He certainly could offer\nlittle threat to the company, yet they ringed him in, weapons ready,\nwatching his every move. The scout licked cracked lips. There was one\nthing they could not control, could not prevent him from doing.\nSomewhere, not too far away, was help ...\n\nNot from the merpeople, but he was sure that he had been in contact\nwith another friendly mind. Since the hour of his awakening on board\nthe globe ship, when he had half-consciously sent out an appeal for\naid over the band which united him with Sssuri's race, and had touched\nthat other consciousness--not the cold alien stream about him--he had\nbeen sure that somewhere within the enemy throng there was a potential\nsavior. Was it among those who manned the strange flyer, those the\nmerpeople had spied upon but whom he had not yet seen?\n\nDalgard had striven since that moment of contact to keep in touch with\nthe nebulous other mind, to project his need for help. But he had been\nunable to enter in freely as he could with his own kind, or with\nSssuri and the sea people. Now, even as he stood in the heart of the\nenemy territory completely at the mercy of the aliens, he felt, more\nstrongly than ever before, that another, whose mind he could not enter\nand yet who was in some queer way sensitive to his appeal, was close\nat hand. He searched the painted faces before him trying to probe\nbehind each locked mask, but he was certain that the one he sought was\nnot there. Only--he must be! The contact was so strong--Dalgard's\nstartled eyes went to the wall behind the dais, tried vainly to trace\nwhat could only be felt. He would be willing to give a knife oath that\nthe stranger was within seeing, listening distance at this minute!\n\nWhile he was so engrossed in his own problem, the guard had moved. The\nhooped bar which locked his wrists was loosened, and his arms, each\ntight in the grip of one of the warriors were brought out before him.\nThe officer on the dais tossed a metal ring to one of the guards.\n\nRoughly the warrior holding Dalgard's left arm forced the band over\nhis hand and jerked it up his forearm as far as it would go. As it\nwinked in the light the scout was reminded of a similar bracelet he\nhad seen--where? On the front leg of the snake-devil he had shot!\n\nThe officer produced a second ring, slipping it smoothly over his own\narm, adjusting it to touch bare skin and not the wrappings which\nserved him as a sleeve. Dalgard thought he understood. A device to\nfacilitate communication. And straightway he was wary. When his\nancestors had first met the merpeople, they had established a means of\nspeech through touch, the palm of one resting against the palm of the\nother. In later generations, when they had developed their new senses,\nphysical contact had not been necessary. However, here--Dalgard's eyes\nnarrowed, the line along his jaw was hard.\n\nHe had always accepted the merpeople's estimate of Those Others, that\ntheir ancient enemies were all-seeing and all-knowing, with mental\npowers far beyond their own definition or description. Now he half\nexpected to be ruthlessly mind-invaded, stripped of everything the\nenemy desired to know.\n\nSo he was astonished when the words which formed in his thoughts were\nsimple, almost childish. And while he prepared to answer them, another\npart of him watched and listened, waiting for the attack he was sure\nwould come.\n\n\"You--are--who--what?\"\n\nHe forced a look of astonishment. Nor did he make the mistake of\nanswering that mentally. If Those Others did not know he could use\nthe mind speech, why betray his power?\n\n\"I am of the stars,\" he answered slowly, aloud, using the speech of\nHomeport. He had so little occasion to talk lately that his voice\nsounded curiously rusty and harsh in his own ears. Nor had he the\nleast idea of the impression those few archaically accented words\nwould have on one who heard them.\n\nTo Dalgard's inner surprise the answer did not astonish his\ninterrogator. The alien officer might well have been expecting to hear\njust that. But he pulled off his own arm band before he turned to his\nfellows with a spurt of the twittering speech they used among\nthemselves. While the two civilians were still trilling, the officer\nedged forward an inch or so and stared at Dalgard intently as he\nreplaced the band.\n\n\"You not look--same--as others--\"\n\n\"I do not know what you mean. Here are not others like me.\"\n\nOne of the civilians twitched at the officer's sleeve, apparently\ndemanding a translation, but the other shook him off impatiently.\n\n\"You come from sky--now?\"\n\nDalgard shook his head, then realized that gesture might not mean\nanything to his audience. \"Long ago before I was, my people came.\"\n\nThe alien digested that, then again took off his band before he\nrelayed it to his companions. The excited twitter of their speech\nscaled up.\n\n\"You travel with the beasts--\" the alien's accusation came crisply\nwhile the others gabbled. \"That which hunts could not have tracked you\nhad not the stink of the beast things been on you.\"\n\n\"I know no beasts,\" Dalgard faced up to that squarely. \"The sea people\nare my friends!\"\n\nIt was hard to read any emotion on these lacquered and bedaubed faces,\nbut before the officer once more broke bracelet contact, Dalgard did\nsense the other's almost hysterical aversion. The scout might just\nhave admitted to the most revolting practices as far as the alien was\nconcerned. After he had translated, all three of those on the dais\nwere silent. Even the guards edged away from the captive as if in some\nmanner they might be defiled by proximity. One of the civilians made\nan emphatic statement, got creakily to his feet, and walked always as\nif he would have nothing more to do with this matter. After a second\nor two of hesitation his fellow followed his example.\n\nThe officer turned the bracelet around in his fingers, his dark eyes\nwith their slitted pupils never leaving Dalgard's face. Then he came\nto a decision. He pushed the ring up his arm, and the words which\nreached the prisoner were coldly remote, as if the captive were no\nlonger judged an intelligent living creature but something which had\nno right of existence in a well-ordered universe.\n\n\"Beast friends with beast. As the beasts--so shall you end. It is\nspoken.\"\n\nOne of the guards tore the bracelet from Dalgard's arm, trying not to\ntouch the scout's flesh in the process. And those who once more\nshackled his wrists ostentatiously wiped their hands up and down the\nwrappings on their thighs afterwards.\n\nBut before they jabbed him into movement with the muzzles of their\nweapons, Dalgard located at last the source of that disturbing mental\ntouch, not only located it, but in some manner broke through the\nexisting barrier between the strange mind and his and communicated as\nclearly with it as he might have with Sssuri. And the excitement of\nhis discovery almost led to self-betrayal!\n\nTerran! One of those who traveled with the aliens? Yet he read clearly\nthe other's distrust of that company, the fact that he lay in\nconcealment here without their knowledge. And he was not\nunfriendly--surely he could not be a Peaceman of Pax! Another fugitive\nfrom a newly-come colony ship--? Dalgard beamed a warning to the\nother. If he who was free could only reach the merpeople! It might\nmean the turning point in their whole venture!\n\nDalgard was furiously planning, simplifying, trying to impress the\nmost imperative message on that other mind as he stumbled away in the\nmidst of the guards. The stranger was confused, apparently Dalgard's\narrival, his use of the mind touch, had been an overwhelming surprise.\nBut if he could only make the right move--would make it--The scout\nfrom Homeport had no idea what was in store for him, but with one of\nhis own breed here and suspicious of the aliens he had at least a slim\nchance. He snapped the thread of communication. Now he must be ready\nfor any opportunity--\n\nRaf watched that amazing apparition go out of the room below. He was\nshaking with a chill born of no outside cold. First the shock of\nhearing that language, queerly accented as the words were, then that\nsharp contact, mind to mind. He was being clearly warned against\nrevealing himself. The stranger was a Terran, Raf would swear to that.\nSo somewhere on this world there was a Terran colony! One of those\nlegendary ships of outlaws, who had taken to space during the rule of\nPax, had made the crossing safely and had here established a foothold.\n\nWhile one part of Raf's brain fitted together the jigsaw of bits and\npatches of information, the other section dealt with that message of\nwarning the other had beamed to him. The pilot knew that the captive\nmust be in immediate danger. He could not understand all that had\nhappened in that interview with the aliens, but he was left with the\nimpression that the prisoner had been not only tried but condemned.\nAnd it was up to him to help.\n\nBut how? By the time he got back to the flitter or was able to find\nHobart and the others, it might already be too late. _He_ must make\nthe move, and soon, for there had been unmistakable urgency in the\ncaptive's message. Raf's hands fumbled at the grid before him, and\nthen he realized that the opening was far too small to admit him to\nthe room on the other side of the wall.\n\nTo return to the underground ways might be a waste of time, but he\ncould see no other course open to him. What if he could not find the\ncaptive later? Where in the maze of the half-deserted city could he\nhope to come across the trail again? Even as he sorted out all the\npoints which could defeat him, Raf's hands and feet felt for the\nnotched steps which would take him down. He had gone only two floors\nwhen he was faced with a grille opening which was much larger. On\nimpulse he stopped to measure it, sure he could squeeze through here,\nif he could work loose the grid.\n\nPrying with one hand and a tool from his belt pouch, he struggled not\nonly against the stubborn metal but against time. That strange mental\ncommunication had ceased. Though he was sure that he still received a\ntrace of it from time to time, just enough to reassure him that the\nprisoner was still alive. And each time it touched him Raf redoubled\nhis efforts on the metal clasps of the grid. At last his determination\ntriumphed, and the grille swung out, to fall with an appalling clatter\nto the floor.\n\nThe pilot thrust his feet through the opening and wriggled\ndesperately, expecting any moment to confront a reception committee\ndrawn by the noise. But when he reached the floor, the hallway was\nstill vacant. In fact, he was conscious of a hush in the whole\nbuilding, as if those who made their homes within its walls were\nelsewhere. That silence acted on him as a spur.\n\nRaf ran along the corridor, trying to subdue the clatter of his space\nboots, coming to a downward ramp. There he paused, unable to decide\nwhether to go down--until he caught sight of a party of aliens below,\nwalking swiftly enough to suggest that they too were in a hurry.\n\nThis small group was apparently on its way to some gathering. And in\nit for the first time the Terran saw the women of the aliens, or at\nleast the fully veiled, gliding creatures he guessed were the females\nof the painted people. There were four of them in the group ahead,\nescorted by two of the males, and the high fluting of their voices\nresounded along the corridor as might the cheeping of birds. If the\nmales were colorful in their choice of body wrappings, the females\nwere gorgeous beyond belief, as cloudy stuff which had the changing\nhues of Terran opals frothed about them to completely conceal their\nfigures.\n\nThe harsher twittering of the men had an impatient note, and the whole\nparty quickened pace until their glide was close to an undignified\ntrot. Raf, forced to keep well behind lest his boots betray him,\nfumed.\n\nThey did not go into the open, but took another way which sloped down\nonce more. Luckily the journey was not a long one. Ahead was light\nwhich suggested the outdoors.\n\nRaf sucked in his breath as he came out a goodly distance behind the\naliens. Established in what was once a court surrounded by the towers\nand buildings of the city was a miniature of that other arena where he\nhad seen the dead lizard things. The glittering, gayly dressed aliens\nwere taking their places on the tiers of seats. But the place which\nhad been built to accommodate at least a thousand spectators now\nhoused less than half the number. If this was the extent of the alien\nnation, it was the dregs of a dwindling race.\n\nDirectly below where Raf lingered in an aisle dividing the tiers of\nseats, there was a manhole opening with a barred gate across it, an\nentrance to the sand-covered enclosure. And fortunately the aliens\nwere all clustered close to the oval far from that spot.\n\nAlso the attention of the audience was firmly riveted on events below.\nA door at the sand level had been flung open, and through it was now\nhustled the prisoner. Either the aliens still possessed some idea of\nfair play or they hoped to prolong a contest to satisfy their own\npleasure, for the captive's hands were unbound and he clutched a\nspear.\n\nRemembering far-off legends of earlier and more savage civilizations\non his own world, Raf was now sure that the lone man below was about\nto fight for his life. The question was, against what?\n\nAnother of the mouthlike openings around the edge of the arena opened,\nand one of the furry people shambled out, weaving weakly from side to\nside as he came, a spear in his scaled paws. He halted a step or two\ninto the open, his round head swinging from side to side, spittle\ndrooling from his gaping mouth. His body was covered with raw sores\nand bare patches from which the fur had been torn away, and it was\napparent that he had long been the victim of ill-usage, if not\ntorture.\n\nShrill cries arose from the alien spectators as the furred one blinked\nin the light and then sighted the man some feet away. He stiffened,\nhis arm drew back, the spear poised. Then as suddenly it dropped to\nhis side, and he fell on his knees before wriggling across the sand,\nhis paws held out imploringly to his fellow captive.\n\nThe cries from the watching aliens were threatening. Several rose in\ntheir seats gesturing to the two below. And Raf, thankful for their\nabsorption, sped down to the manhole, discovering to his delight it\ncould be readily opened from his side. As he edged it around, there\nwas another sound below. This was no high-pitched fluting from aliens\ndeprived of their sport, but a hissing nightmare cry.\n\nRaf's line of vision, limited by the door, framed a portion of scaled\nback, as it looked, immediately below him. His hand went to the blast\nbombs as he descended the runway, and his boots hit the sand just as\nthe drama below reached its climax.\n\nThe furred one lay prone in the sand, uncaring. Above that mistreated\nbody, the human stood in the half-crouch of a fighting man, the puny\nspear pointed up bravely at a mark it could not hope to reach, the\nsoft throat of one of the giant lizards. The reptile did not move to\nspeedily destroy. Instead, hissing, it reared above the two as if\nstudying them with a vicious intelligence. But there was no time to\nwonder how long it would delay striking.\n\nRaf's strong teeth ripped loose the tag end of the blast bomb, and he\nlobbed it straight with a practiced arm so that the ball spiraled\nacross the arena to come to rest between the massive hind legs of the\nlizard. He saw the man's eyes widen as they fastened on him. And then\nthe human captive flung himself to the earth, half covering the body\nof the furred one. The reptile grabbed in the same instant, its\ngrasping claws cutting only air, and before it could try a second time\nthe bomb went off.\n\nLiterally torn apart by the explosion, the creature must have died at\nonce. But the captive moved. He was on his feet again, pulling his\ncompanion up with him, before the startled spectators could guess what\nhad happened. Then half carrying the other prisoner, he ran, not\nonward to the waiting Raf, but for the gate through which he had come\ninto the arena. At the same time a message beat into the Terran's\nbrain--\n\n\"This way!\"\n\nAvoiding bits of horrible refuse, Raf obeyed that order, catching up\nin a couple of strides with the other two and linking his arm through\nthe dangling one of the furred creature to take some of the strain\nfrom the stranger.\n\n\"Have you any more of the power things?\" the words came in the archaic\nspeech of his own world.\n\n\"Two more bombs,\" he answered.\n\n\"We may have to blow the gate here,\" the other panted breathlessly.\n\nInstead Raf drew his stun gun. The gate was already opening, a wedge\nof the painted warriors heading through, flame-throwers ready. He\nsprayed wide, and on the highest level. A spout of fire singed the\ncloth of his tunic across the top of his shoulder as one of the last\naliens fired before his legs buckled and he went down. Then,\nopposition momentarily gone, the two with their semiconscious charge\nstumbled over the bodies of the guards and reached the corridor\nbeyond.\n\n\n\n\n16\n\nSURPRISE ATTACK\n\n\nSo much had happened so quickly during the past hour that Dalgard had\nno chance to plan or even sort out impressions in his mind. He had no\nguess as to where this stranger, now taking some of the burden of the\nwounded merman from him, had sprung from. The other's clothing, the\nhelmet covering his head were more akin to those worn by the aliens\nthan they were to the dress of the colonist. Yet the man beneath those\ntrappings was of the same breed as his own people. And he could not\nbelieve he was a Peaceman of Pax--all he had done here spoke against\nthose legends of dark Terran days Dalgard had heard from childhood.\nBut where had he come from? The only answer could be another outlaw\ncolony ship.\n\n\"We are in the inner ways,\" Dalgard tried to reach the mind of the\nmerman as they pounded on into the corridors which led from the arena.\n\"Do you know these--\" He had a faint hope that the sea man because of\nhis longer captivity might have a route of escape to suggest.\n\n\"--down to the lower levels--\" the thought came slowly, forced out by\na weakening will. \"Lower--levels--roads to the sea--\"\n\nThat was what Dalgard had been hoping for, some passage which would\nrun seaward and so to safety, such as he had found with Sssuri in that\nother city.\n\n\"What are we hunting?\" the stranger broke in, and Dalgard realized\nthat perhaps the other did not follow the mind talk. His words had an\nodd inflection, a clipped accent which was new.\n\n\"A lower way,\" he returned in the speech of his own people.\n\n\"To the right.\" The merman, struggling against his own weakness, had\nraised his head and was looking about as one who searches for a\nfamiliar landmark.\n\nThere was a branching way to the right, and Dalgard swung into it,\nbringing the other two after him. This was a narrow passage, and twice\nthey brushed by sealed doors. It brought them up against a blank wall.\nThe stranger wheeled, his odd weapon ready, for they could hear the\nshouts of pursuers behind them. But the merman pulled free of Dalgard\nand went down on the floor to dig with his taloned fingers at some\ndepressions there.\n\n\"Open here,\" the thought came clearly, \"then down!\"\n\nDalgard went down on one knee, able now to see the outline of a trap\ndoor. It must be pried up. His sword-knife was gone, the spear they\nhad given him for the arena he had dropped when he dragged the merman\nout of danger. He looked to the stranger. About the other's narrow\nhips was slung a belt from which hung pouches and tools the primitive\ncolonist could not evaluate. But there was also a bush knife, and he\nreached for it.\n\n\"The knife--\"\n\nThe stranger glanced down at the blade he wore in surprise, as if he\nhad forgotten it. Then with one swift movement he drew it from its\nsheath and flipped it to Dalgard.\n\nOn the track behind the clamor was growing, and the colony scout\nworked with concentration at his task of fitting the blade into the\ncrack and freeing the door. As soon as there was space enough, the\nmerman's claws recklessly slid under, and he added what strength he\ncould to Dalgard's. The door arose and fell back onto the pavement\nwith a clang, exposing a dark pit.\n\n\"Got 'em!\" the words burst from the stranger. He had pressed the\nfiring button of his weapon. Where the passage in which they stood met\nthe main corridor, there was an agitated shouting and then sudden\nsilence.\n\n\"Down--\" The merman had crawled to the edge of the opening. From it\nrose a dank, fetid smell. Now that the noise in the corridor was\nstilled Dalgard could hear something: the sound of water.\n\n\"How do we get down?\" he questioned the merman.\n\n\"It is far, there are no climbing holds--\"\n\nDalgard straightened. Well, he supposed, even a leap into that was\nbetter than to be taken a second time by Those Others. But was he\nready for such a desperate solution?\n\n\"A long way down?\" The stranger leaned over to peer into the well.\n\n\"He says so,\" Dalgard nodded at the merman. \"And there are no climbing\nholds.\"\n\nThe stranger plucked at the front of his tunic with one hand, still\nholding his weapon with the other. From an opening he drew a line, and\nDalgard grabbed it eagerly, testing the first foot with a sharp jerk.\nHe had never seen such stuff, so light of weight and yet so tough. His\ndelight reached the merman, who sat up to gaze owlishly at the coils\nthe stranger pulled from concealment.\n\nThey used the door of the well for the lowering beam, hitching the\ncord about it. Then the merman noosed one end about him, and Dalgard,\nthe door taking some of the strain, lowered him. The end of the cord\nwas perilously close to the scout's fingers when there was a signaling\npull from below, and he was free to reel in the loose line. He turned\nto the stranger.\n\n\"You go. I'll watch them.\" The other waved his weapon to the\ncorridor.\n\nThere was some sense to that, Dalgard had to agree. He made fast the\nend of the cord and went in his turn into the dark, burning the palm\nof one hand before he was able to slacken the speed of his descent.\nThen he landed thigh-deep in water, from which arose an unpleasant\nsmell.\n\n\"All right--Come--\" he put full force into the thought he beamed at\nthe stranger above. When the other did not obey, Dalgard began to\nwonder if he should climb to his aid. Had the aliens broken through\nand overwhelmed the other? Or what had happened? The rope whisked up\nout of his hands. And a moment later a voice rang eerily overhead.\n\n\"Clear below! Coming down!\"\n\nDalgard scrambled out of the space under the opening, heading on into\nthe murk where the merman waited. There was a splash as the stranger\nhit the stream, and the rope lashed down behind him at their united\njerk.\n\n\"Where do we go from here?\" The voice carried through the dark.\n\nScaled fingers hooked about Dalgard's right hand and tugged him on. He\nreached back in turn and locked grip with the stranger. So united the\nthree splashed on through the rancid liquid. In time they came out of\nthe first tunnel into a wider section, but here the odor was worse,\ncatching in their throats, making them sway dizzily. There seemed to\nbe no end to these ways, which Raf guessed were the drains of the\nancient city.\n\nOnly the merman appeared to have a definite idea of where they were\ngoing, though he halted once or twice when they came to a side passage\nas if thinking out their course. Since the man from the arena accepted\nthe furred one's guidance, Raf depended upon it too. Though he\nwondered if they would ever find their way out into the open once\nmore.\n\nHe was startled by sudden pain as the hand leading him tightened its\ngrip to bone-bruising force. They had stopped, and the liquid washed\nabout them until Raf wondered if he would ever feel clean again. When\nthey started on, they moved much more swiftly. His companions were in\na hurry, but Raf was unprepared for the sight which broke as they came\nout in a high-roofed cavern.\n\nThere was an odd, cold light there--but that light was not all he saw.\nDrawn up on a ledge rising out of the contaminated stream were rows of\nthe furred people, all sitting in silence, bone spears resting across\ntheir knees, long knives at their belts. They watched with round,\nunblinking eyes the three who had just come out of the side passage.\nThe rescued merman loosened his grip on Dalgard's hand and waded\nforward to confront that quiet, waiting assembly. Neither he nor his\nfellows made any sound, and Raf guessed that they had some other form\nof communication, perhaps the same telepathic ability to broadcast\nmessages which this amazing man beside him displayed.\n\n\"They are of his tribe,\" the other explained, sensing that Raf could\nnot understand. \"They came here to try to save him, for he is one of\ntheir Speakers-for-Many.\"\n\n\"Who are they? Who are you?\" Raf asked the two questions which had\nbeen with him ever since the wild adventure had begun.\n\n\"They are the People-of-the-Sea, our friends, our knife brothers. And\nI am of Homeport. My people came from the stars in a ship, but not a\nship of this world. We have been here for many years.\"\n\nThe mermen were moving now. Several had waded forward to greet their\nchief, aiding him ashore. But when Raf moved toward the ledge, Dalgard\nput out a restraining hand.\n\n\"Until we are summoned--no. They have their customs. And this is a\nparty-for-war. This tribe knows not my people, save by rumor. We\nwait.\"\n\nRaf looked over the ranks of the sea folk. The light came from globes\nborne by every twentieth warrior, a globe in which something that\ngave off phosphorescent gleams swam around and around. The spears\nwhich each merman carried were slender and wickedly barbed, the knives\nalmost sword length. The pilot remembered the flame-throwers of the\naliens and could not see any victory for the merman party.\n\n\"No, knife blade against the fire--that is not equal.\"\n\nRaf started, amazed and then irritated that the other had read his\nthoughts so easily.\n\n\"But what else can be done? Some stand must be taken, even if a whole\ntribe goes down to the Great Dark because they do it.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Raf demanded.\n\n\"Is it not the truth that Those Others went across the sea to plunder\ntheir forgotten storehouse of knowledge?\" countered the other. He\nspoke slowly as if he found difficulty in clothing thoughts with\nwords. \"Sssuri said that was why they came.\"\n\nRaf, remembering what he had seen--the stripping of shelves and tables\nof the devices that were stored on them--could only nod.\n\n\"Then it is also true that soon they will have worse than fire with\nwhich to hunt us down. And they shall turn against your colony as they\nwill against Homeport. For the mermen, and their own records, have\ntaught us that it is their nature to rule, that they can live in peace\nonly when all living things on this world are their slaves.\"\n\n\"My colony?\" Raf was momentarily diverted. \"I'm one of a spacer's\ncrew, not the member of any colony!\"\n\nDalgard stared at the stranger. His guess had been right. A new ship,\nanother ship which had recently crossed deep space to find them had\nflown the dark wastes even as the First Elders had done! It must be\nthat more outlaws had come to find a new home! This was wonderful\nnews, news he must take to Homeport. Only, it was news which must\nwait. For the sea people had come to a decision of their own.\n\n\"What are they going to do now?\" Raf asked.\n\nThe mermen were not retreating, instead they were slipping from the\nledge in regular order, forming somewhat crooked ranks in the water.\n\nDalgard did not reply at once, making mind touch not only to ask but\nto impress his kinship on the sea people. They were united in a\nsingle-minded purpose, with failure before them--unless--He turned to\nthe stranger.\n\n\"They go to war upon Those Others. He who guided us here knows also\nthat the new knowledge they have brought into the city is danger. If\nan end is not put to it before they can use it, then\"--he\nshrugged--\"the mermen must retreat into the depths. And we, who can\nnot follow them--\" He made a quick, thrusting gesture as if using a\nknife on his own throat. \"For a time Those Others have been growing\nfewer in number and weaker. Their children are not many and sometimes\nthere are years when none are born at all. And they have forgotten so\nmuch. But now, perhaps they can increase once more, not only in wisdom\nand strength of arms, but in numbers. The mermen have kept a watch on\nthem, content to let matters rest, sure that time would defeat them.\nBut now, time no longer fights on our side.\"\n\nRaf watched the furred people with their short spears, their knives.\nHe recalled that rocky island where the aliens had unleashed the fire.\nThe expeditionary force would not have a chance against that.\n\n\"But _your_ weapons would.\" The words addressed to him were clear,\nthough they had not been spoken aloud. Raf's hand went to the pocket\nwhere two more of the blast bombs rested. \"And this is your battle as\nmuch as ours!\"\n\nBut it wasn't his fight! Dalgard had gone too far with that\nsuggestion. Raf had no ties on this world, the _RS 10_ was waiting to\ntake him away. It was strictly against all orders, all his training,\nfor him to become involved in alien warfare. The pilot's hand went\nback to his belt. He was not going to allow himself to be pushed onto\nanything foolish, whether this \"colonist\" could read his mind or not.\n\nThe first ranks of the mermen had already waded past them, heading\ninto the way down which the escaping prisoners had come. To Raf's eyes\nnone of them paid any attention to the two humans as they went, though\nthey were probably in mental touch with his companion.\n\n\"You are already termed one of us in _their_ eyes,\" Dalgard was\ncareful to use oral speech this time. \"When you came to our rescue in\nthe arena they believed that you were of our kind. Do you think you\ncan return to walk safely through the city? So\"--he drew a hissing\nbreath of surprise when the thought which leaped into Raf's mind was\nplain to Dalgard also--\"you have--there are more of you there! But\nalready Those Others may be moving against them because of what you\nhave done!\"\n\nRaf who had been about to join the mermen stopped short. That aspect\nhad not struck him before. What had happened to Soriki and the\nflitter, to the captain and Lablet, who had been in the heart of the\nenemy territory when he had challenged the aliens? It would be only\nlogical that the painted people would consider them all dangerous now.\nHe must get out of here, back to the flitter, try to help where\nunwittingly he had harmed--\n\nDalgard caught up with him. He had been able to read a little of what\nhad passed through the other's mind. Though it was difficult to sort\norder out of the tangled thoughts. The longer he was with the\nstranger, the more aware he became of the differences between them.\nOutwardly they might appear of the same species, but inwardly--Dalgard\nfrowned--there was something that he must consider later, when they\nhad a thinking space. But now he could understand the other's\nagitation. It was very true that Those Others might turn on the\nstranger's fellows in retaliation for his deeds.\n\nTogether they joined the mermen. There was no talk, nothing to break\nthe splashing sound of bodies moving against the current. As they\npressed on, Raf was sure that this was not the same way they had come.\nAnd once more Dalgard answered his unspoken question.\n\n\"We seek another door into the city, one long known to these\ntribesmen.\"\n\nRaf would gladly have run, but he could not move faster than his\nguides, and while their pace seemed deliberate, they did not pause to\nrest. The whole city, he decided, must be honeycombed with these\ndrains. After traversing a fourth tunnel, they climbed out of the\nflood onto a dry passage, which wormed along, almost turning on itself\nat times.\n\nSide passages ran out from this corridor like rootlets from a parent\nroot, and small parties of mermen broke from the regiment to follow\ncertain ones, leaving without orders or farewells. At the fifth of\nthese Dalgard touched Raf's arm and drew him aside.\n\n\"This is our way.\" Tensely the scout waited. If the stranger refused,\nthen the one plan the scout had formed during the past half-hour would\nfail. He still held to the hope that Raf, with what Raf carried, could\nsucceed in the only project which would mean, perhaps not his safety\nnor the safety of the tribe he now marched among, but the eventual\nsafety of Astra itself, the safety of all the harmless people of the\nsea, the little creatures of the grass and the sky, of his own land at\nHomeport. He would have to force Raf into action if need be. He did\nnot use the mind touch; he knew now the unspoken resentment which\nfollowed that. If it became necessary--Dalgard's hands balled into\nfists--he would strike down the stranger--take from him--Swiftly he\nturned his thoughts from that. It might be easy, now that he had\nestablished mental contact with this off-worlder, for the other to\npick up a thought as vivid as that.\n\nBut luckily Raf obediently turned into the side passage with the six\nmermen who were to attack at this particular point. The way grew\nnarrower until they crept on hands and knees between rough walls which\nwere not of the same construction as the larger tunnels. The smaller\nmermen had no difficulty in getting through, but twice Raf's equipment\nbelt caught on projections and he had to fight his way free.\n\nThey crawled one by one into a ventilation shaft much like the one he\nhad climbed at the Center. Dalgard's whisper reached him.\n\n\"We are now in the building which houses their sky ship.\"\n\n\"I know that one,\" Raf returned almost eagerly, glad at last to be\nback so close to familiar territory. He climbed up the hand-and\nfootholds the sea-monster lamp disclosed, wishing the mermen ahead\nwould speed up.\n\nThe grille at the head of the shaft had been removed, and the invaders\narose one by one into a dim and dusty place of motionless machinery,\nwhich, by all tangible evidence, had not been entered for some time.\nBut the cautious manner in which the sea people strung out to approach\nthe far door argued that the same might not be true beyond.\n\nFor the first time Raf noticed that his human companion now held one\nof the knives of the merpeople, and he drew his stun gun. But he could\nnot forget the flame-throwers which might at that very moment be\ntrained upon the other side of that door by the aliens. They might be\nwalking into a trap.\n\nHe half expected one of those disconcerting thought answers from\nDalgard. But the scout was playing safe--nothing must upset the\nstranger. Confronted by what had to be done, he might be influenced\ninto acting for them. So Dalgard strode softly ahead, apparently not\ninterested in Raf.\n\nOne of the mermen worked at the door, using the point of his spear as\na lever. Here again was a vista of machinery. But these machines were\nalive; a faint hum came from their casings. The mermen scattered,\ntaking cover, a move copied by the two humans.\n\nThe pilot remained in hiding, but he saw one of the furred people\nrunning on as light-footedly as a shadow. Then his arm drew back, and\nhe cast his spear. Raf fancied he could hear a faint whistle as the\nweapon cut the air. There was a cry, and the merman ran on, vanishing\ninto the shadows, to return a second or two later wiping stains from\nhis weapon. Out of their places of concealment, his fellows gathered\nabout him. And the humans followed.\n\nNow they were fronted by a ramp leading up, and the mermen took it\nquickly, their bare, scaled feet setting up a whispering echo which\nwas drowned by the clop of Raf's boots. Once more the party was alert,\nready for trouble, and taking his cue from them, he kept his stun gun\nin his hand.\n\nBut the maneuver at the head of the ramp surprised him. For, though he\nhad heard no signal, all the party but one plastered their bodies back\nagainst the wall, Dalgard pulling Raf into position beside him, the\nscout's muscular bare arm pinning the pilot into a narrow space. One\nmerman stood at the crack of the door at the top of the ramp. He\npushed the barrier open and crept in.\n\nMeanwhile those who waited poised their spears, all aimed at that\ndoor. Raf fingered the button on his gun to \"spray\" as he had when he\nhad faced the attack of the scavengers in the arena tunnels.\n\nThere was a cry, a shout with a summons in it. And the venturesome\nmerman thudded back through the door. But he was not alone. Two of the\nblack guardsmen, their flamers spitting fiery death, ran behind him,\nand the curling lash of one of those flames almost wreathed the runner\nbefore he swung aside. Raf fired without consciously aiming. Both of\nthe sentries fell forward, to slide limply down the ramp.\n\nThen Dalgard pulled him on. \"The way is open,\" he said. \"This is it!\"\nThere was an excited exultation in his voice.\n\n\n\n\n17\n\nDESTRUCTION UNLEASHED\n\n\nThe space they now entered must be the core of the building, Raf\nthought a little dazedly. For there, towering over them was the round\nbulb of the globe. And about its open hatch were piles of the material\nwhich he had last seen in the warehouse on the other continent. The\nunloading of the alien ship had been hastily interrupted.\n\nSince neither the merman nor Dalgard took cover, Raf judged that they\ndid not fear attack now. But when he turned his attention away from\nthe ship, he found not only the colony scout but most of the sea\npeople gathered about him as if waiting for some action on his part.\n\n\"What is it?\" He could feel it, that strong pressure, that band\nunited, in willing him into some move. His stubborn streak of\nindependence made his reaction contrary. He was not going to be pushed\ninto anything.\n\n\"In this hour,\" Dalgard spoke aloud, avoiding the mind touch which\nmight stiffen Raf's rebellion. He wished that some older, wiser Elder\nfrom Homeport were there. So little time--Yet this stranger with\npractically no effort might accomplish all they had come to do, if he\ncould only be persuaded into action. \"In this hour, here is the heart\nof what civilization remains to Those Others. Destroy it, and it will\nnot matter whether they kill us. For in the days to come they will\nhave nothing left.\"\n\nRaf understood. This was why he had been brought here. They wanted\nhim to use the blast bombs. And one part of him _was_ calculating the\nbest places to set his two remaining bombs for the wildest possible\ndestruction. That part of him could accept the logic of Dalgard's\nreasoning. He doubted if the aliens could repair the globe if it were\ndamaged, and he was sure that much which they had brought back from\nthe eastern continent was irreplaceable. The bombs had not been\nintended for such a use. They were defensive, anti-personal weapons to\nbe employed as he had done against the lizard in the arena. But placed\nproperly--Without thinking his hands went to the sealed pocket in the\nbreast of his tunic.\n\nDalgard saw that gesture and inside him some taut cord began to\nunwind. Then the stranger's hands dropped, and he swung around to face\nthe colony scout squarely, a scowl twisting his black brows almost\ntogether.\n\n\"This isn't my fight,\" he stated flatly. \"I've got to get back to the\nflitter, to my spacer--\"\n\nWhat was the matter? Dalgard tried to understand. If the aliens won\nnow, this stranger was in as great a danger as were the rest of them.\nDid he believe that Those Others would allow any colony to be\nestablished on a world they ruled?\n\n\"There will be no future for you here,\" he spoke slowly, trying with\nall his power to get through to the other. \"They will not allow you to\nfound another Homeport. You will have no colony--\"\n\n\"Will you get it into your thick head,\" burst out the pilot, \"that I'm\nnot here to start a colony! We can take off from this blasted planet\nwhenever we want to. We didn't come here to stay!\"\n\nBeneath the suntan, Dalgard's face whitened. The other had come from\nno outlaw ship, seeking a refuge across space, as his own people had\nfled to a new life from tyranny. His first fears had been correct!\nThis was a representative of Pax, doubtless sent to hunt down the\ndescendants of those who had escaped its throttling dictatorship. The\nslender strangely garbed Terran might be of the same blood as his own,\nbut he was as great an enemy as Those Others!\n\n\"Pax!\" He did not know that he had said that word aloud.\n\nThe other laughed. \"You are living back in history. Pax has been dead\nand gone almost two centuries. I'm of the Federation of Free Men--\"\n\n\"Will the stranger use his fire now?\" The question formed in Dalgard's\nmind. The mermen were growing impatient, as well they might. This was\nno time for talk, but for action. Could Raf be persuaded to aid them?\nA Federation of Free Men--Free Men! That was what they were fighting\nfor here and now.\n\n\"You are free,\" he said. \"The sea people won their freedom when Those\nOthers fought among themselves. My people came across the star void in\nsearch of freedom, paying in blood to win it. But these, these are not\nthe weapons of the free.\" He pointed to the supplies about the globe,\nto the globe itself.\n\nThe mermen were waiting no longer. With the butts of their spears they\nsmashed anything breakable. But the damage one could do by hand in the\nshort space of time granted them--Raf was surprised that a guard was\nnot already down upon them--was sharply limited. The piled-up secrets\nof an old race, a race which had once ruled a planet. He thought\nfleetingly of Lablet's preoccupation with this spoil, of Hobart's hope\nof gaining knowledge they could take back with them. But would the\naliens keep their part of the bargain? He no longer believed that.\n\nWhy not give these barbarians a chance, and the colonists. Sure, he\nwas breaking the stiffest rule of the Service. But, perhaps by now the\nflitter was gone, he might never reach the _RS 10_. It was not his\nwar, right enough. But he'd give the weaker side a fighting chance.\n\nDalgard followed him into the globe ship, climbing the ladders to the\nengine level, watching with curious eyes as Raf inspected the driving\npower of the ship and made the best disposition possible of one of the\nbombs.\n\nThen they were on the ladder once more as the ship shook under them,\nplates buckling as a great wound tore three decks apart. Raf laughed\nrecklessly. Now that he was committed to this course, he had a\nsmall-boy delight in the destruction.\n\n\"They won't raise her again in a hurry,\" he confided to Dalgard. But\nthe other did not share his triumph.\n\n\"They come--we must move fast,\" the scout urged.\n\nWhen they jumped from the hatch, they discovered that the mermen had\nbeen busy in their turn. As many of the supplies as they could move\nhad been pushed and piled into one great mass. Broken crystal littered\nthe floor in shards and puddles of strange chemicals mingled smells to\nbecome a throat-rasping fog. Raf eyed those doubtfully. Some of those\nfumes might combine in the blast--\n\nOnce again Dalgard read his mind and waved the mermen back, sending\nthem through the door to the ramp and the lower engine room. Raf stood\nin the doorway, the bomb in his hand, knowing that it was time for him\nto make the most accurate cast of his life.\n\nThe sphere left his fingers, was a gleam in the murky air. It struck\nthe pile of material. Then the whole world was hidden by a blinding\nglare.\n\nIt was dark--black dark. And he was swinging back and forth through\nthis total darkness. He was a ball, a blast bomb being tossed from\nhand to hand through the dark by painted warriors who laughed shrilly\nat his pain, tossed through the dark. Fear such as he had never known,\neven under the last acceleration pressure of the take-off from Terra,\nbeat through Raf's veins away from his laboring heart. He was helpless\nin the dark!\n\n\"Not alone--\" the words came out of somewhere, he didn't know whether\nhe heard them, or, in some queer way, felt them. \"You are safe--not\nalone.\"\n\nThat brought a measure of comfort. But he was still in the dark, and\nhe was moving--he could not will his hands to move--yet he was moving.\nHe was being carried!\n\nThe flitter--he was back on the flitter! They were air-borne. But who\nwas piloting?\n\n\"Captain! Soriki!\" he appealed for reassurance. And then was aware\nthat there was no familiar motor hum, none of that pressure of rushing\nair to which he had been so long accustomed that he missed it only\nnow.\n\n\"You are safe--\" Again that would-be comfort. But Raf tried to move\nhis arms, twist his body, be sure that he rested in the flitter. Then\nanother thought, only vaguely alarming at first, but which grew\nswiftly to panic proportions--He was in the alien globe--He was a\nprisoner!\n\n\"You are safe!\" the words beat in his mind.\n\n\"But where--where?\" he felt as if he were screaming that at the full\npower of his lungs. He must get out of this dark envelope, be free.\nFree! Free Men--He was Raf Kurbi of the Federation of Free Men, member\nof the crew of the Spacer _RS 10_. But there had been something else\nabout free men--\n\nPainfully he pulled fragments of pictures out of the past, assembled a\njigsaw of wild action. And all of it ended in a blinding flash,\nblinding!\n\nRaf cowered mentally if not physically, as his mind seized upon that\nlast word. The blinding flash, then this depth of darkness. Had he\nbeen--?\n\n\"You are safe.\"\n\nMaybe he was safe, he thought, with an anger born of honest fear, but\nwas he--blind? And where was he? What had happened to him since that\nmoment when the blast bomb had exploded?\n\n\"I am blind,\" he spat out, wanting to be told that his fears were only\nfears and not the truth.\n\n\"Your eyes are covered,\" the answer came quickly enough, and for a\nshort space he was comforted until he realized that the reply was not\na flat denial of his statement.\n\n\"Soriki?\" he tried again. \"Captain? Lablet?\"\n\n\"Your companions\"--there was a moment of hesitation, and then came\nwhat he was sure was the truth--\"have escaped. Their ship took to the\nair when the Center was invaded.\"\n\nSo, he wasn't on the flitter. That was Raf's first reaction. Then, he\nmust still be with the mermen, with the young stranger who claimed to\nbe one of a lost Terran colony. But they couldn't leave him behind!\nRaf struggled against the power which held him motionless.\n\n\"Be quiet!\" That was not soothing; it had the snap of a command, so\nsharp and with such authority in it that he obeyed. \"You have been\nhurt; the gel must do its work. Sleep now. It is good to sleep--\"\n\nDalgard walked by the hammock, using all the quieting power he\npossessed to ease the stranger, who now bore little resemblance to the\nlithe, swiftly moving, other-worldly figure of the day before.\nStripped of his burned rags of clothing, coated with the healing stuff\nof the merpeople--that thick jelly substance which was their bulwark\nagainst illness and hurt--lashed into a hammock of sea fibers, he had\nthe outward appearance of a thick bundle of supplies. The scout had\nseen miracles of healing performed by the gel, he could only hope for\none now. \"Sleep--\" he made the soothing suggestion over and over and\nfelt the other begin to relax, to sink into the semicoma in which he\nmust rest for at least another day.\n\nIt was true that they had watched the strange flying machine take off\nfrom a roof top. And none of the mermen who had survived the battle\nwhich had raged through the city had seen any of the off-worlder's\nkind among the living or the dead of the alien forces. Perhaps,\nthinking Raf dead, they had returned to their space ship.\n\nNow there were other, more immediate, problems to be met. They had\ndone everything that they could to insure the well-being of the\nstranger, without whom they could not have delivered that one\nnecessary blow which meant a new future for Astra.\n\nThe aliens were not all dead. Some had gone down under the spears of\nthe mermen, but more of the sea people had died by the superior\nweapons of their foes. To the aliens, until they discovered what had\nhappened to the globe and its cargo, it would seem an overwhelming\ntriumph, for less than a quarter of the invading force fought its way\nback to safety in the underground ways. Yes, it would appear to be a\nvictory for Those Others. But--now time was on the other side of the\nscales.\n\nDalgard doubted if the globe would ever fly again. And the loss of the\nstorehouse plunder could never be repaired. By its destruction they\nhad insured the future for their people, the mermen, the slowly\ngrowing settlement at Homeport.\n\nThey were well out of the city, in the open country, traveling along a\nrocky gorge, through which a river provided a highway to the sea.\nDalgard had no idea as yet how he could win back across the waste of\nwater to his own people. While the mermen with whom he had stormed the\ncity were friendly, they were not of the tribes he knew, and their own\nconnection with the eastern continent was through messages passed\nbetween islands and the depths.\n\nThen there was the stranger--Dalgard knew that the ship which had\nbrought him to this planet was somewhere in the north. Perhaps when he\nrecovered, they could travel in that direction. But for the moment it\nwas good just to be free, to feel the soft winds of summer lick his\nskin, to walk slowly under the sun, carrying the little bundle of\nthings which belonged to the stranger, with a knife once more at his\nbelt and friends about him.\n\nBut within the quarter-hour their peace was broken. Dalgard heard it\nfirst, his landsman's ears serving him where the complicated sense\nwhich gave the sea people warning did not operate. That shrill\nkeening--he knew it of old. And at his warning the majority of the\nmermen plunged into the stream, becoming drifting shadows below the\nsurface of the water. Only the four who were carrying the hammock\nstood their ground. But the scout, having told them to deposit their\nburden under the shelter of an overhanging ledge of rock, waved them\nto join their fellows. Until that menace in the sky was beaten, they\ndare not travel overland.\n\nWas it still after him alone, hunting him by some mysterious built-in\nsense as it had overseas? He could see it now, moving in circles back\nand forth across the gorge, probably ready to dive on any prey\nventuring into the open.\n\nHad it not been for the stranger, Dalgard could have taken to the\nwater almost as quickly and easily as his companions. But they could\nnot float the pilot down the stream, thus dissolving the thick coating\nof gel which was healing his terrible flash burns. And Those Others,\nwere they following the trail of their mechanical hound as they had\nbefore?\n\nDalgard sent out questing tendrils of thought. Nowhere did he\nencounter the flashes which announced the proximity of Those Others.\nNo, it would appear that they had unleashed the hound to do what\ndamage it could, perhaps to serve them as a marker for a future\ncounterattack. At present it was alone. And he relayed that\ninformation to the mermen.\n\nIf they could knock out the hound--his hand went to the tender scrape\non his own scalp where that box had left its glancing mark--if they\ncould knock out the hound--But how? As accurate marksmen as the mermen\nwere with their spears, he was not sure they could bring down the box.\nIts sudden darts and dips were too erratic. Then what? Because as long\nas it bobbed there, he and the stranger were imprisoned in this\npocket of the gorge wall.\n\nDalgard sat down, the bundle of the stranger's belongings beside him.\nThen, he carefully unfastened the scorched cloth which formed that bag\nand examined its contents. There was the belt with its pouches,\nsheaths, and tool case. And the weapon which the stranger had used to\nsuch good effect during their escape from the arena. Dalgard took up\nthe gun. It was light in weight, and it fitted into his hand almost as\nif it had been molded to his measure.\n\nHe aimed at the hovering box, pressed the button as he had seen the\nother do, with no results. The stun ray, which had acted upon living\ncreatures, could not govern the delicate mechanism in the hound's\ninterior. Dalgard laid it aside. There were no more of the bombs, nor\nwould they have been effective against such a target. As far as he\ncould see, there was nothing among Raf's possessions which could help\nthem now.\n\nOne of the black shadows in the water moved to shore. The box swooped,\ndeath striking at the merman who ran to shelter. A second followed\nhim, eluding the attack of the hound by a matter of inches. Now the\nbox buzzed angrily.\n\nDalgard, catching their thoughts, hurried to aid them. They undid the\nknots of the hammock about the helpless stranger, leaving about him\nonly the necessary bandage ties. Now they had a crude net, woven, as\nDalgard knew, of undersea fibers strong enough to hold captive\nplunging monsters a dozen times the size of the box. If they could net\nit!\n\nHe had seen the exploits of the mermen hunters, knew their skill with\nnet and spear. But to scoop a flying thing out of the air was a new\nproblem.\n\n\"Not so!\" the thought cut across his. \"They have used such as this to\nhunt us before, long ago. We had believed they were all lost. It must\nbe caught and broken, or it will hunt and kill and hunt again, for it\ndoes not tire nor can it be beaten from any trail it is set upon.\nNow--\"\n\n\"I will do that, for you have the knowledge--\" the scout cut in\nquickly. After his other meeting with the hound he had no liking for\nthe task he had taken on, but there must be bait to draw the box\nwithin striking distance.\n\n\"Stand upright and move toward those rocks.\" The mermen changed\nposition, the net, now with stones in certain loops to weigh it,\ncaught in their three-fingered hands.\n\nDalgard moved, fighting against hunching his shoulders, against\nhurrying the pace. He saw the shadow of the flitting death, and flung\nhimself down beside the boulder the mermen had pointed out. Then he\nrolled over, half surprised not to be struck.\n\nThe hound was still in the air but over it now was draped the net, the\nrocks in its fringes weighing it down in spite of its jerky attempts\nto rise. In its struggles to be free, it might almost have led the\nwatcher to believe that it had intelligence of a sort. Now the mermen\nwere coming out of the stream, picking up rocks as they advanced. And\na hail of stones flew through the air, while others of the sea people\nsprang to catch the dangling ends of the net and drag the captive to\nearth.\n\nIn the end they smashed it completely, burying the remains under a\npile of rocks. Then, retrieving their net, they once more fastened Raf\ninto it and turned downstream, as intent as ever upon reaching the\nsea. Dalgard wondered whether Those Others would ever discover what\nhad become of their hound. Or had it in some way communicated with its\nmasters, so that now they were aware that it had been destroyed. But\nhe was sure they had nothing more to fear, that the way to the sea was\nopen.\n\nIn mid-morning of the second day they came out upon shelving sand and\nsaw before them the waves which promised safety and escape to the\nmermen. Dalgard sat down in the blue-gray sand beside Raf. The sea\npeople had assured him that the stranger was making a good recovery,\nthat within a matter of hours he could be freed from his cocoon of\nhealing.\n\nDalgard squinted at the sun sparkling on the waves. Where now? To the\nnorth where the space ship waited? If what he read in Raf's mind was\ntrue the other wanted to leave Astra, to voyage back to that other\nworld which was only a legend to Dalgard, and a black, unhappy legend\nat that. If the Elders were here, had a chance to contact these men\nfrom Terra--Dalgard's eyes narrowed, would they choose to? Another\nchain of thought had been slowly developing in his mind during these\npast hours when he had been so closely companioned with the stranger.\nAnd almost he had come to a decision which would have seemed very odd\neven days before.\n\nNo, there was no way of suddenly bringing the Elders here, of\ntransferring his burden of decision to them. Dalgard cupped his chin\nin his hand and tried to imagine what it would be like to shut oneself\nup in a small metal-walled spacer and set out blindly to leave one\nworld for another. His ancestors had done that, and they had traveled\nin cold sleep, ignorant of whether they would ever reach their goal.\nThey had been very brave, or very desperate, men.\n\nBut--Dalgard measured sand, sun, and sky, watching the mermen sporting\nin the waves--but for him Astra was enough. He wanted nothing but this\nland, this world. There was nothing which drew him back. He would try\nto locate the spacer for the sake of the stranger; Astra owed Raf all\nthey could manage to give him. But the ship was as alien to Homeport\nas it now existed as the city's globe might have been.\n\n\n\n\n18\n\nNOT YET--\n\n\nRaf lay on his back, cushioned in the sand, his face turned up to the\nsky. Moisture smarted in his eyes, trickled down his cheeks as he\ntried to will himself to _see_! The yellow haze which had been his day\nhad faded into grayness and now to the dark he feared so much that he\ndared not even speak of it. Somewhere over him the stars were icy\npoints of light--but he could not see them. They were very far away,\nbut no farther than he was from safety, from comfort (now the spacer\nseemed a haven of ease), from the expert treatment which might save,\nsave his sight!\n\nHe supposed he should be thankful to that other one who was a slow\nvoice speaking out of the mist, a thought now and then when his inner\npanic brought him almost to the breaking point. In some manner he had\nbeen carried out of the reach of the aliens, treated for his searing\nwounds, and now he was led along, fed, tended--Why didn't they go away\nand leave him alone! He had no chance of reaching the spacer--\n\nIt was so easy to remember those mountains, the heights over which he\nhad lifted the flitter. There wasn't one chance in a million of his\nwinning over those and across the miles of empty plains beyond to\nwhere the _RS 10_ stood waiting, ready to rise again. The crew must\nbelieve him dead. His fists clenched upon sand, and it gritted between\nhis fingers, sifted away. Why wasn't he dead! Why had that barbarian\ndragged him here, continued to coax him, put food into his hands,\nthose hands which were only vague shapes when he held them just before\nhis straining, aching eyes.\n\n\"It is not as bad as you think,\" the words came again out of the fog,\nspoken with a gentleness which rasped Raf's nerves. \"Healing is not\ndone in a second, or even in a day. You cannot force the return of\nstrength--\"\n\nA hand, warm, vibrant with life, pressed on his forehead--a human,\nflesh-covered hand, not one of the cool, scaled paws of the furred\npeople. Though those hands, too, had been laid upon him enough during\nthe past few days, steadying him, leading him, guiding him to food and\nwater. Now, under that firm, knowing touch he felt some of the\never-present fear subside, felt a relaxation.\n\n\"My ship--They will take off without me!\" He could not help but voice\nthat plaint, as he had so many times before during that foggy,\nnightmare journey.\n\n\"They have not done so yet.\"\n\nHe struggled up, flung off that calming hand, turned angrily toward\nwhere he thought the other was. \"How can you be sure?\"\n\n\"Word has come. The ship is still there, though the small flyer has\nreturned to it.\"\n\nThis assurance was something new. Raf's suspicions could not stand up\nagainst the note of certainty in the other's voice. He got awkwardly\nto his feet. If the ship was still here, then they must still think\nhim alive--They might come back! He had a chance--a real chance!\n\n\"Then they are waiting for me--They'll come!\"\n\nHe could not see the soberness with which Dalgard listened to that.\nThe star ship had not lifted, that message had found its way south,\npassed along by hopper and merman. But the scout doubted if the\nexplorers were waiting for the return of Raf. He believed that they\nwould not have left the city had they not thought the pilot already\ndead.\n\nAs to going north now--His picture of the land ahead had been built up\nfrom reports gained from the sea people. It could be done, but with\nRaf to be nursed and guided, lacking even the outrigger Dalgard had\nused in home waters, it would take days--weeks, probably--to cover\nthe territory which lay between them and the plains where the star\nship had planeted.\n\nBut he owed Raf a great deal, and it was summer, the season of warm\ncalms. So far he had not been able to work out any plan for a return\nto his own land. It might be that they were both doomed to exile. But\nit was not necessary to face that drear future yet, not until they had\nexpended every possible effort. So now he said willingly enough, \"We\nare going north.\"\n\nRaf sat down again in the sand. He wanted to run, to push on until his\nfeet were too tired to carry him any farther. But now he fought that\nimpulse, lay down once more. Though he doubted if he could sleep.\n\nDalgard watched the stars, sketched out a map of action for the\nmorning. They must follow the shore line where they could keep in\ntouch with the mermen, though along this coast the sea people did not\ncome to land with the freedom their fellows showed on the eastern\ncontinent--they had lived too long in fear of Those Others.\n\nBut since the war party had reached the coast, there had been no sign\nof any retaliation, and as several days passed, Dalgard had begun to\nbelieve that they had little to fear. Perhaps the blow they had struck\nat the heart of the citadel had been more drastic than they had hoped.\nHe had listened since that hour in the gorge for the shrilling of one\nof the air hounds. And when it did not come the thought that maybe it\nwas the last of its kind had been heartening.\n\nAt last the scout lay down beside the off-world man, listening to the\nsoft hiss of waves on sand, the distant cluttering of night insects.\nAnd his last waking thought was a wish for his bow.\n\nThere was another day of patient plodding; two, three. Raf, led by the\nhand, helped over rocks and obstacles which were only dark blurs to\nhis watering eyes, raged inwardly and sometimes outwardly, against the\nslowness of their advance, his own helplessness. His fear grew until\nhe refused to credit the fact that the blurs were sharpening in\noutline, that he could now count five fingers on the hand he sometimes\nwaved despairingly before his face.\n\nWhen he spoke of the future, he never said \"if we reach the ship\" but\nalways \"when,\" refusing to admit that perhaps they would not be in\ntime. And Dalgard by his anxiety, tried to get more news from the\nnorth.\n\n\"When we get there, will you come back to earth with us?\" the pilot\nasked suddenly on the fifth day.\n\nIt was a question Dalgard had once asked himself. But now he knew the\nanswer; there was only one he dared give.\n\n\"We are not ready--\"\n\n\"I don't understand what you mean.\" Raf was almost querulous. \"It is\nyour home world. Pax is gone; the Federation would welcome you\neagerly. Just think what it would mean--a Terran colony among the\nstars!\"\n\n\"A Terran colony.\" Dalgard put out a hand, steadied Raf over a stretch\nof rough shingle. \"Yes, once we were a Terran colony. But--can you now\ntruthfully swear that I am a Terran like yourself?\"\n\nRaf faced the misty figure, trying to force his memory to put features\nthere, to sharpen outlines. The scout was of middle height, a little\nshorter in stature than the crewmen with whom the pilot had lived so\nlong. His hair was fair, as was his skin under its sun tan. He was\nunusually light on his feet and possessed a wiry strength Raf could\ntestify to. But there was that disconcerting habit of mind reading and\nother elusive differences.\n\nDalgard smiled, though the other could not see that.\n\n\"You see,\" deliberately he used the mind touch as if to accent those\ndifferences the more, \"once our roots were the same, but now from\nthese roots different plants have grown. And we must be left to\nourselves a space before we mingle once more. My father's father's\nfather's father was a Terran, but I am--what? We have something that\nyou have not, just as you have developed during centuries of\nseparation qualities of mind and body we do not know. You live with\nmachines. And, since we could not keep machines in this world, having\nno power to repair or rebuild, we have been forced to turn in other\ndirections. To go back to the old ways now would be throwing away\nclues to mysteries we have not yet fully explored, turning aside from\ndiscoveries ready to be made. To you I am a barbarian, hardly higher\nin the scale of civilization than the mermen--\"\n\nRaf flushed, would have given a quick and polite denial, had he not\nknown that his thoughts had been read. Dalgard laughed. His amusement\nwas not directed against the pilot, rather it invited him to share the\njoke. And reluctantly, Raf's peeling lips relaxed in a smile.\n\n\"But,\" he offered one argument the other had not cited, \"what if you\ndo go down this other path of yours so far that we no longer have any\ncommon meeting ground?\" He had forgotten his own problem in the\nother's.\n\n\"I do not believe that will ever happen. Perhaps our bodies may\nchange; climate, food, ways of life can all influence the body. Our\nminds may change; already my people with each new generation are\nbetter equipped to use the mind touch, can communicate more clearly\nwith the animals and the mermen. But those who were in the beginning\nborn of Terra shall always have a common heritage. There are and will\nbe other lost colonies among the stars. We could not have been the\nonly outlaws who broke forth during the rule of Pax, and before the\nblight of that dictatorship, there were at least two expeditions that\nwent forth on Galactic explorations.\n\n\"A thousand years from now stranger will meet with stranger, but when\nthey make the sign of peace and sit down with one another, they shall\nfind that words come more easily, though one may seem outwardly\nmonstrous to the other. Only, _now_ we must go our own way. We are\nyouths setting forth on our journey of testing, while the Elders wish\nus well but stand aside.\"\n\n\"You don't want what we have to offer?\" This was a new idea to Raf.\n\n\"Did you truly want what the city people had to offer?\"\n\nThat caught the pilot up. He could remember with unusual distinctness\nhow he had disliked, somehow feared the things they had brought from\nthe city storehouse, how he had privately hoped that Hobart and Lablet\nwould be content to let well enough alone and not bring that knowledge\nof an alien race back with them. If he had not secretly known that\naversion, he would not have been able to destroy the globe and the\ntreasures piled about it.\n\n\"But\"--his protest was hot, angry--\"we are not _them_! We can do much\nfor you.\"\n\n\"Can you?\" The calm question sank into his mind as might a stone into\na troubled pool, and the ripples of its passing changed an idea or\ntwo. \"I wish that you might see Homeport. Perhaps then it would be\neasier for you to understand. No, your knowledge is not corrupt, it\nwould not carry with it the same seeds of disaster as that of Those\nOthers. But it would be too easy for us to accept, to walk a softer\nroad, to forget what we have so far won. Just give us time--\"\n\nRaf cupped his palms over his watering eyes. He wanted badly to see\nclearly the other's face, to be able to read his expression. Yet it\nseemed that somehow he _was_ able to see that sober face, as sincere\nas the words in his mind.\n\n\"You will come again,\" Dalgard said with certainty. \"And we shall be\nwaiting because you, Raf Kurbi, made it possible.\" There was something\nso solemn about that that Raf looked up in surprise.\n\n\"When you destroyed the core of Those Other's holding, you gave us our\nchance. For had you not done that we, the mermen, the other harmless,\nhappy creatures of this world, would have been wiped out. There would\nbe no new beginning here, only a dark and horrible end.\"\n\nRaf blinked; to his surprise that other figure standing in the direct\nsunlight did not waver, and beyond the proudly held head was a stretch\nof turquoise sky. He could see the color!\n\n\"Yes, you shall see with your eyes--and with your mind,\" now Dalgard\nspoke aloud. \"And if the Spirit which rules all space is kind, you\nshall return to your own people. For you have served His cause well.\"\n\nThen, as if he were embarrassed by his own solemnity, Dalgard ended\nwith a most prosaic inquiry: \"Would you like shellfish for eating?\"\n\nMoments later, wading out into the water-swirled sand, his boots\nkicked off, his toes feeling for the elusive shelled creatures no one\ncould see, Raf felt happier, freer than he could ever remember having\nbeen before. It was going to be all right. He could _see_! He would\nfind the ship! He laughed aloud at nothing and heard an answering\nchuckle and then a whoop of triumph from the scout stooping to claw\none of their prey out of hiding.\n\nIt was after they had eaten that Dalgard asked another question, one\nwhich did not seem important to Raf. \"You have a close friend among\nthe crew of your ship?\"\n\nRaf hesitated. Now that he was obliged to consider the point, did he\nhave any friends--let alone a close one--among the crew of the _RS\n10_? Certainly he did not claim Wonstead who had shared his\nquarters--he honestly did not care if he never saw him again. The\nofficers, the experts such as Lablet--quickly face and character of\neach swept through his mind and was as swiftly discarded. There was\nSoriki--He could not claim the com-tech as any special friend, but at\nleast during their period together among the aliens he had come to\nknow him better.\n\nNow, as if Dalgard had read his mind--and he probably had, thought\nRaf with a flash of the old resentment--he had another question.\n\n\"And what was he--is he like?\"\n\nThough the pilot could see little reason for this he answered as best\nhe could, trying to build first a physical picture of the com-tech and\nthen doing a little guessing as to what lay under the other's\nspace-burned skin.\n\nDalgard lay on his back, gazing up into the blue-green sky. Yet Raf\nknew that he was intent on every word. A merman padded up, settled\ndown cross-legged beside the scout, as if he too were enthralled by\nthe pilot's halting description of a man he might never see again.\nThen a second of the sea people came and a third, until Raf felt that\nsome sort of a noiseless council was in progress. His words trailed\naway, and then Dalgard offered an explanation.\n\n\"It will take us many, many days to reach the place where your ship\nis. And before we are able to complete that journey your friends may\nbe gone. So we shall try something else--with your aid.\"\n\nRaf fingered the little bundle of his possessions. Even his helmet\nwith its com phone was missing.\n\n\"No,\" again Dalgard read his mind. \"Your machines are of no use to you\nnow. We shall try _our_ way.\"\n\n\"How?\" Wild thoughts of a big signal fire--But how could that be\nsighted across a mountain range. Of some sort of an improvised com\nunit--\n\n\"I said _our_ way.\" There was a smile on Dalgard's face, visible to\nRaf's slowly clearing vision. \"We shall provide another kind of\nmachine, and these\"--he waved at the mermen--\"will give us the power,\nor so we hope. Lie here,\" he gestured to the sand beside him, \"and\nthink only of your friend in the ship, in his natural surroundings.\nTry to hold that picture constant in your mind, letting no other\nthought trouble it.\"\n\n\"Do you mean--send a message to him mentally!\" Raf's reply was half\nprotest.\n\n\"Did I not so reach you when we were in the city--even before I knew\nof you as an individual?\" the scout reminded him. \"And such messages\nare doubly possible when they are sent from friend to friend.\"\n\n\"But we were close then.\"\n\n\"That is why--\" again Dalgard indicated the mermen. \"For them this is\nthe natural means of communication. They will pick up your reaching\nthought, amplify it with their power, beam it north. Since your friend\ndeals with matters of communication, let us hope that he will be\nsensitive to this method.\"\n\nRaf was only half convinced that it might work But he remembered how\nDalgard had established contact with him, before, as the scout had\npointed out, they had met. It was that voiceless cry for aid which had\npulled him into this adventure in the first place. It was only fitting\nthat something of the same process give _him_ help in return.\n\nObediently he stretched out on the sand and closed his dim eyes,\ntrying to picture Soriki in the small cabin which held the com,\nslouched in his bucket seat, his deceptive posture that of a lax\nidler, as he had seen him so many times. Soriki--his broad face with\nits flat cheekbones, its wide cheerful mouth, its heavy-lidded eyes.\nAnd having fixed Soriki's face, he tried to believe that he was now\nconfronting the com-tech, speaking directly to him.\n\n\"Come--come and get me--south--seashore--Soriki come and get me!\" The\nwords formed a kind of chant, a chant aimed at that familiar face in\nits familiar surroundings. \"South--come and get me--\" Raf struggled to\nthink only of that, to allow nothing to break through that chant or\ndisturb his picture of the scene he had called from memory.\n\nHow long that attempt at communication lasted the pilot could not\ntell, for somehow he slipped from the deep concentration into sleep,\ndreamless and untroubled, from which he awoke with the befogged\nfeeling that something important had happened. But had he gotten\nthrough?\n\nThe ring of mermen was gone, and it was dawn, gray, chill with the\nforewarnings of rain in the air. He was reassured because he was\ncertain that in spite of the gloom his sight was a fraction clearer\nthan it had been the day before. But had they gotten through? As he\narose, brushing the sand from him, he saw the scout splashing out of\nthe sea, a fish impaled on his spear.\n\n\"Did we get through?\" Raf blurted out.\n\n\"Since your friend cannot reply with the mind touch, we do not know.\nBut later we shall try again.\" To Raf's peering gaze Dalgard's face\nhad a drawn, gaunt look as if he had been at hard labor during the\nhours just past. He walked up the beach slowly, without the springing\nstep Raf had come to associate with him. As he settled down to gut the\nfish with one of the bone knives, the scout repeated, \"We can try\nagain--!\"\n\nHalf an hour later, as the rain swept in from the sea, Raf knew that\nthey would not have to try. His head went up, his face eager. He had\nknown that sound too long and too well ever to mistake it--the drone\nof a flitter motor cutting through the swish of the falling water.\nSome trick of the cliffs behind them must be magnifying and projecting\nthe sound, for he could not sight the machine. But it was coming. He\nwhirled to Dalgard, only to see that the other was on his feet and had\ntaken up his spear.\n\n\"It is the flitter! Soriki heard--they're coming!\" Raf hastened to\nassure him.\n\nFor the last time he saw Dalgard's slow, warm smile, clearer than he\nhad ever seen it before. Then the scout turned and trotted away,\ntoward a fringing rock wall. Before he dropped out of sight behind\nthat barrier he raised the spear in salute.\n\n\"Swift and fortunate voyaging!\" He gave the farewell of Homeport.\n\nThen Raf understood. The colonist meant just what he had said: he\nwanted no contact with the space ship. To Raf he had owed a debt and\nnow that was paid. But the time was not yet when the men of Astra and\nthe men of Terra should meet. A hundred years from now perhaps--or a\nthousand--but not yet. And remembering what had summoned the flitter\nwinging toward him, Raf drew a deep breath. What would the men of\nAstra accomplish in a hundred years? What could those of Terra do to\nmatch them in knowledge? It was a challenge, and he alone knew just\nhow much of a challenge. Homeport must remain his own secret. He had\nbeen guided to this place, saved by the mermen alone. Dalgard and his\npeople must not exist as far as the crew of the _RS 10_ were\nconcerned.\n\nFor the last time he experienced the intimacy of the mind touch. \"That\nis it--brother!\" Then the sensation was gone as the black blot of the\nflitter buzzed out of the clouds.\n\nFrom behind the rocks Dalgard watched the pilot enter the strange\nmachine. For a single moment he had an impulse to shout, to run\nforward, to surrender to his desire to see the others, the ship which\nhad brought them through space and would, they confidently believed,\ntake them back to the Terra he knew only as a legend of the past. But\nhe mastered that desire. He had been right. The road had already\nforked and there was no going back. He must carry this secret all the\nrest of his life--he must be strong-willed enough so that Homeport\nwould never know. Time--give them time to be what they could be. Then\nin a hundred years--or a thousand--But not yet!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\"Nobody today is telling better stories of straight-forward interstellar\nadventure.\"\n\n              --_New York Herald-Tribune_\n\n    When Raf Kurbi's Terran spaceship burst into unexplored skies\n    of the far planet Astra and was immediately made welcome by\n    the natives of a once-mighty metropolis, Kurbi was unaware of\n    three vital things:\n\n    One was that Astra already harbored an Earth\n    colony--descended from refugees from the world of the\n    previous century.\n\n    Two was that these men and women were facing the greatest\n    danger of their existence from a new outburst of the inhuman\n    fiends who had once tyrannized Astra.\n\n    Three was that the natives who were buying Kurbi's science\n    know-how were those very fiends--and their intentions were\n    implacably deadly for all humans, whether Earth born or STAR\n    BORN.\n\n    _It's an Andre Norton space adventure--and therefore the tops\n    in its field!_\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\nQuotes from the reviews:\n\n\"All science-fiction fans will thrill to these new adventures created by\nAndre Norton....

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
