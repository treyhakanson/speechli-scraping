S. P. Meek\n\n\n     +------------------------------------+\n     | Another episode in Dr. Bird's long |\n     | scientific duel with his country's |\n     |       arch-enemy, Saranoff.        |\n     +------------------------------------+\n\n\nThe milling crowd in front of the Capitol suddenly grew quiet. A tall\nportly figure came out onto the porch of the building and stepped before\na microphone erected on the steps. A battery of press cameras clicked. A\nnewsreel photographer ground away on his machine. Wild cheers rent the\nair. The President held up his hand for silence. As the cheering died\naway he spoke into the microphone.\n\n\"My countrymen,\" he said, \"the Congress of the United States has met in\nextraordinary session and is ready to cope with the condition with\nwhich we are confronted. While they deliberate as to the steps to be\ntaken, it is essential that you meet this danger, if it be a danger,\nwith the bravery and the calm front which has always characterized the\npeople of the United States in times of trial and danger. You may rest\nassured--\"\n\nA slightly built, inconspicuous man who had followed the President out\nonto the porch was surveying the crowd intently. He turned and spoke in\nan undertone to a second man who mysteriously appeared from nowhere as\nthe first man spoke. He listened for a moment, nodded, and edged closer\nto the President. The first man slipped unobtrusively down the Capitol\nsteps and mingled with the crowd.\n\n\"--that no steps will be neglected which may prove of value,\" went on\nthe President. \"The greatest scientists of the country have gathered in\nthis city in conference and they undoubtedly will soon find a simple and\nnatural explanation for what is happening. In the meantime--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe President paused. From the crowd in front of him came a sudden\ndisturbance. A man sprang free of the crowd and broke through the\nrestraining cordon of police. In his hand gleamed an ugly blue steel\nautomatic pistol. Quickly he leveled it and fired. A puff of dust came\nfrom the Capitol. The bullet had landed a few inches from one of the\nlower windows, fifty feet from where the President stood. He raised his\nweapon for a second shot but it was never fired. The man who had come\ndown the Capitol steps sprang forward like a cat and grasped the weapon.\nFor a moment the two men struggled, but only for a moment. From the\ncrowd, stunned for a moment by the sheer audacity of the attack, came a\nroar of rage. The police closed in about the struggling men but the\ncrowd rolled over them like a wave. The captor shouted his identity and\ntried to display the gold badge of the secret service but the mob was\nin no state of mind to listen. The police were trampled underfoot and\nthe would-be assassin torn from the hands of the secret service\noperative. Every man in reach tried to strike a blow. The secret service\nman was buffeted and thrown aside. Realizing that the affair had been\ntaken out of his hands, he made his way to the rear of the Capitol where\nhis badge gained him ready passage through the cordon of police. He\nentered the building and reappeared in a few moments by the side of the\nPresident.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTwo hours later he leaned forward in his chair in Dr. Bird's private\nlaboratory in the Bureau of Standards and spoke earnestly.\n\n\"Dr. Bird,\" he said, \"that bullet was never meant for the President.\nThat man was after bigger game.\"\n\nThe famous scientist nodded thoughtfully.\n\n\"Even a very rotten pistol shot should have come closer to him,\" he\nreplied. \"He must have missed by a good forty feet.\"\n\n\"He missed by a matter of inches. Doctor, that bullet struck the Capitol\nonly two inches from a window. In that window was standing a man. The\nbullet was intended for the occupant of that window. I was directly\nbehind him when he raised his weapon for a second shot and I am sure of\nhis aim. He deliberately ignored the President and aimed again at that\nwindow. That was when I tackled him.\"\n\n\"Who was standing there, Carnes?\"\n\n\"_You_ were, Doctor.\"\n\nDr. Bird whistled.\n\n\"Then you think that bullet was intended for me?\"\n\n\"I am sure of it, Doctor. That fact proves one thing to me. You are\nright in your idea that this whole affair is man-made and not an\naccident of nature. The guiding intelligence back of it fears you more\nthan he fears anyone else and he took this means to get rid of you\nunobtrusively. Attention was focused on the President. Your death would\nhave been laid to accident. It was a clever thought.\"\n\n\"It does look that way, Carnes,\" said the doctor slowly. \"If you are\nright, this incident confirms my opinion. There is only one man in the\nworld clever enough to have disturbed the orderly course of the seasons,\nand such a plan for my assassination would appeal to his love of the\ndramatic.\"\n\n\"You mean--\"\n\n\"Ivan Saranoff, of course.\"\n\n\"We are pretty sure that he hasn't got back to the United States,\nDoctor.\"\n\n\"You may be right but I am sure of nothing where that man is concerned.\nHowever, that fact has no bearing. He may be operating from anywhere.\nHis organization is still in the United States.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA knock sounded at the door. In response to the doctor's command a\nmessenger entered and presented a letter. Dr. Bird read it and dropped\nit in a waste basket.\n\n\"Tell them that I am otherwise engaged just now,\" he said curtly. The\nmessenger withdrew. \"It was just a summons to another meeting of the\ncouncil of scientists,\" he said to Carnes. \"They'll have to get along\nwithout me. All they'll do anyway will be to read a lot of dispatches\nand wrangle about data and the relative accuracy of their observations.\nHerriott will lecture for hours on celestial mechanics and propound some\nfool theory about a hidden body, which doesn't exist, and its possible\ninfluence, which would be nil, on the inclination of the earth's axis.\nAfter wasting four hours without a single constructive idea being put\nforward, they will gravely conclude that the sun rose fifty-three\nseconds earlier at the fortieth north parallel than it did yesterday and\ncorrespondingly later at the fortieth south parallel. I know that\nwithout wasting time.\"\n\n\"Was it fifty-three seconds to-day, Doctor?\"\n\n\"Yes. This is the twentieth of July. The sun should have risen at 4:52,\nsixteen minutes later than it rose on June twentieth and fifty-three\nseconds later than it rose yesterday. Instead it rose at 4:20, sixteen\nminutes _earlier_ than it did on June twentieth and fifty-three seconds\nearlier than yesterday.\"\n\n\"I don't understand what is causing it, Doctor. I have tried to follow\nyour published explanations, but they are a little too deep for me.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"As to the real underlying cause, I am in grave doubts, Carnes, although\nI can make a pretty shrewd guess. As to the reason for the unnatural\nlengthening of the day, the explanation is simplicity itself. As you\ndoubtless know, the earth revolves daily on its axis. At the same time,\nit is moving in a great ellipse about the sun, an ellipse which it takes\nit a year to cover. If the axis of rotation of the earth were at right\nangles to the plane of its orbit; in other words, if the earth's equator\nlay in the plane of the earth's movement about the sun, each day would\nbe of the same length and there would be no seasons. Instead of this\nbeing the case, the axis of rotation of the earth is tipped so that the\nangle between the equator and the elliptic is 23-1/2\u00b0.\"\n\n\"I seem to remember something of the sort from my school days.\"\n\n\"This angle of tilt may be assumed to be constant, for I won't bother\nwith the precessions, nutations and other minor movements considered in\naccurate computations. As the earth moves around the sun, this tilt\ngives rise to what we call the sun's declination. You can readily see\nthat at one time in the year, the north pole will be at its nearest\npoint to the sun, speaking in terms of tilt and not in miles, while at\nanother point on the elliptic, it will be farthest from the sun and the\nsouth pole nearest. There are two midway points when the two poles are\npractically equidistant.\"\n\n\"Then the days and nights should be of equal length.\"\n\n\"They are. These are the periods of the equinoxes. The point at which\nthe sun is nearest to the south pole we call the winter solstice, and\nthe opposite point, the summer solstice. The summer solstice is on June\ntwenty-first. At that time the declination of the sun is 23-1/2\u00b0 north\nof the equatorial line. It starts to decrease until, six months later,\nit reaches a minus declination of 23-1/2\u00b0 and is that far south of the\nline. The longest day in the northern hemisphere is naturally June\ntwenty-first.\"\n\n\"And the shortest day when the sun has the greatest minus declination.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Precisely, at the winter solstice. Now to explain what is happening.\nThe year went normally until June twenty-first. That day was of the\ncorrect length, about fourteen hours and fifty minutes long. The\ntwenty-second should have been shorter. Instead, it was longer than the\ntwenty-first. Each day, instead of getting shorter as it should at this\ntime of year, is getting longer. We have already gained some thirty-two\nminutes of sunlight at this latitude. The explanation is that the angle\nbetween the equator and the elliptic is no longer 23-1/2\u00b0 as it has been\nfrom time immemorial, but it is greater. If the continuing tilt keeps up\nlong enough, the obliquity will be 90\u00b0. When that happens, there will be\nperpetual midday at the north pole and perpetual night at the south\npole. The whole northern hemisphere will be bathed in a continuous flood\nof sunlight while the southern hemisphere will be a region of cold and\ndark. The condition of the earth will resemble that of Mercury where the\nsame face of the planet is continually facing the sun.\"\n\n\"I understand that all right, but I am still in the dark as to what is\ncausing this increase of tilt.\"\n\n\"No more than I am, old dear. Herriott keeps babbling about a hidden\nbody which is drawing the earth from its normal axial rotation, but the\nfool ignores the fact that a body of a size sufficient to disturb the\nearth would throw every motion of the solar system into a state of\nchaos. Nothing of the sort has happened. Ergo, no external force is\ncausing it. I am positive that the force which is doing the work is\nlocated on the earth itself. Furthermore, unless my calculations are\nbadly off, this force is located on or very near the surface of the\nearth at approximately the sixty-fifth degree of north latitude.\"\n\n\"How can you tell that, Doctor?\"\n\n\"It would take me too long to explain, Carnes. I will, however, qualify\nmy statement a little. Either a variable force is being used or else a\nconstant force located where I have said. The sixty-fifth parallel is a\nlong line. The exact location and the nature of that force, we have to\nfind. If it be man-made, and I'll bet my bottom dollar that it is, we\nwill also have to destroy it. If we fail, we'll see this world plunged\ninto such a riot of war and bloodshed as has never before been known. It\nwill be literally a fight of mankind for a place in the sun. Due to its\nfavorable location in the new position of the earth, it is more than\nprobable that Russia would emerge as the dominant power.\"\n\n\"Undertaking to destroy a thing that you don't know the location of and\nof whose existence you aren't even sure is a pretty big contract.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"We've tackled bigger ones, old dear. We have the President behind us. I\nhaven't made much headway selling my idea to that gang of old fossils\nwho call themselves the council of scientists, but I did to his nibs.\nJust before that attempt at assassination, I had a chin-chin with him.\nThe fastest battle cruiser in the Navy, the _Denver_, is to be placed at\nmy service. It will carry a big amphibian plane, so be equipped to\nassemble and launch it. Bolton will relieve you from the Presidential\nguard to-day. We sail in the morning.\"\n\n\"Where for, Doctor?\"\n\n\"I feel sure that the force is caused and controlled by men and I know\nof but one man who has the genius and the will to do such a thing. That\nman is Saranoff. Because he must be concealed and work free from\ninterruption, I fancy he is working in his own country. Does that answer\nyour question?\"\n\n\"It does. We sail for Russia.\"\n\n\"Carnesy, old dear, at times you have flashes of such scintillating\nbrilliance that I have hopes for the future of the secret service. In\ntime they may even show human intelligence. Toddle along now and pay\nyour fond farewells to the bright lights of Washington. Meet me at the\nPennsy station at six. We'll sail from New York in the morning.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith the famous scientist and his assistant as passengers, the _Denver_\nsteamed at her best speed across the Atlantic. As soon as New York\nharbor was cleared, Dr. Bird charted the course. Captain Evans raised\nhis eyebrows when he saw the course laid out, but his orders had been\npositive. Had Dr. Bird ordered him to steam at full speed against the\nshore, he would have obeyed without question.\n\nThe _Denver_ avoided the usual lanes of traffic and bore to the north of\nthe summer lane. Not a vessel was sighted in the eight days which\nelapsed before the Faroe Islands came in sight on the starboard bow. The\n_Denver_ bore still more to the north and skirted around North Cape five\ndays later. At Cape Kanin she headed south into the White Sea.\nSurprisingly little ice was encountered. When Captain Evans mentioned\nthis, Dr. Bird pointed out to him that it was August and that the days\nwere still lengthening. Once in the White Sea, the _Denver_ was made\nready for instant action. A huge amphibian plane was hoisted in sections\nfrom the hold and mechanics started to assemble it. Dr. Bird spent most\nof his time working on some instruments he had assembled in the radio\nroom.\n\n\"This is an ultra-short wave detector,\" he explained to Carnes. \"It will\nreceive vibrations to the lowest limit of waves that we have ever been\nable to measure. The X-ray is high on the scale and even the cosmic ray\nis far above its lower limit of detection. We are hunting for an\nelectro-magnet, the largest and strangest electro-magnet that has ever\nbeen constructed. Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that we are\nseeking for a generator of magnetic force. It does not generate the\nordinary magnetism which attracts iron and steel, nor the special type\nof magnetism which we call gravity, but something between the two. It\nattracts the sun enough to disturb the tilt of the earth's axis, but not\nenough to pull the earth out of its orbit. Such a device should give out\na wave that can be detected, if we get a receiver delicate enough and\noperating on the right wave length.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe spent hours improving and refining the apparatus, but in the end he\nconfessed himself beaten.\n\n\"It's no use, Carnes,\" he said the day after Cape Kanin faded from view\nto the north. \"Either the apparatus we are seeking gives out no wave\nthat we can detect or my apparatus is faulty. Luckily we have other\nthings to guide us.\"\n\n\"What are they, Doctor?\"\n\n\"The facts that Saranoff must have easy transportation and a source of\npower. The first precludes him from locating his station far from the\nsea-coast and the second indicates that it will be near a river or other\nsource of power. The only Russian points on the sixty-fifth parallel\nthat are open to water transport are the Gulf of Anadyr, north of\nKamchatka, and the vicinity of Archangel. I passed up Kamchatka because\nit would mean too long a haul through unfriendly waters from Leningrad\nand because there is not much water power. Archangel is easy of access\nat this time of the year and it has the Dwina river for power. That will\nbe our first line of search.\"\n\n\"We will explore by plane, of course?\"\n\n\"Certainly. We wouldn't get far on foot, especially as neither of us\nspeaks Russian. We'll head south for another day and then-- What's that?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe paused and listened. From the distance came a dull drone of sound\nwhich brought him to his feet with a start. He raced out onto deck with\nCarnes at his heels. Far overhead in the blue, a tiny speck of black\nhovered.\n\n\"We're on the right trail, Carnes,\" he said grimly. The plane passed\nover them. In huge circles it sank toward the ground. Dr. Bird turned to\nCaptain Evans. Orders flew from the bridge and a detail of marines\nrapidly stripped the covers from the two forward anti-aircraft rifles.\n\n\"I dislike to fire on that craft before it makes a hostile\ndemonstration, Dr. Bird,\" demurred Captain Evans. \"We are at peace with\nRussia. My action in firing might precipitate a war, or in any event,\nserious diplomatic misunderstandings.\"\n\n\"Allow me to correct you, Captain Evans, we are at war with Russia. The\nwhole world is at war with the man who has pulled the earth out of her\ncourse. In any event, your orders are positive and the responsibility is\nmine. Wait until that plane gets within easy range and then shoot it\ndown. Do not fail to get it; it must not get back to shore with word of\nour approach.\"\n\nCaptain Evans bowed gravely. Shells came up from the magazines and were\npiled by the guns. From the fire control stations came a monotonous\ncalling of firing data. The guns slowly changed direction as the plane\ndescended. Nearer and nearer it came, intent on positive identification\nof the war vessel below it. It passed over the _Denver_ less than five\nthousand feet up. As it passed it swung off to one side and began to\nclimb sharply. Dr. Bird glanced at the fighting top of the cruiser and\nswore softly. From the top the stars and stripes had been broken to the\nbreeze.\n\n\"Fire at once!\" he cried, \"and then court-martial the fool who broke out\nthat flag!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe two three-inch rifles barked their message of death into the sky.\nFor agonizing seconds nothing happened. The guns roared again. Below and\nbehind the fleeing plane, two puffs of white smoke appeared in the sky.\nThe staccato calls of the observers came from the control station and\nthe guns roared again and again. Now above and now below the Russian\nplane appeared the white puffs that told of bursting shells, but the\nplane droned on, unharmed.\n\n\"It's away safely,\" groaned the doctor. \"Now the fat _is_ in the fire.\nSaranoff will know in an hour that we are coming. If we had a pursuit\nplane ready to take off, we might catch him, but we haven't. Oh, well,\nthere's no use in crying over spilt milk. How soon will that amphibian\nbe ready to take off?\"\n\n\"In twenty minutes. Doctor,\" replied the Engineering Officer. \"As soon\nas we finish filling the tanks and test the motor, she'll be ready to\nramble.\"\n\n\"Hurry all you can. Hang a half dozen hundred-pound bombs and a few\ntwenty-fives on the racks. Lower her over the side as soon as she's\nready. Where's Lieutenant McCready?\"\n\n\"Below, getting into his flying togs, Doctor.\"\n\n\"Good enough. Come on, Carnes, we'll go below and put on our fur-lined\npanties, too. We'll probably need them.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn half an hour the amphibian rose from the water. Lieutenant McCready\nwas at the controls, with Carnes and the doctor at the bomb racks. The\nplane rose in huge spirals until the altimeter read four thousand feet.\nThe pilot straightened it out toward the south. The plane was alone in\nthe sky. For two hours it flew south and then veered to the east,\nfollowing the line of the Gulf of Archangel. The town came in sight at\nlast.\n\n\"Better drop down a couple of thousand, Lieutenant,\" said Dr. Bird into\nthe speaking tube. \"We can't see much from this altitude.\"\n\nThe plane swung around in a wide circle, gradually losing altitude.\nCarnes and the doctor hung over the side watching the ground below them.\nAs they watched a puff of smoke came from a low building a mile from the\nedge of the town. Dr. Bird grabbed the speaking tube.\n\n\"Bank, McCready!\" he barked, \"They're firing at us.\"\n\nThe plane lurched sharply to one side. From a point a few yards below\nthem and almost directly along their former line of flight, a burst of\nflame appeared in the air. The plane lurched and reeled as the blast of\nthe explosion reached it. From other points on the ground came other\npuffs.\n\n\"Get out of here,\" shouted Dr. Bird. \"There must be a dozen guns firing\nat us. One of them will have the range directly.\"\n\nFrom all around them came flashes and the roar of explosions. The plane\nlurched and yawed in a sickening fashion. Lieutenant McCready fought\nheroically with the controls, trying to prevent the sideslips which were\ncosting him altitude. Gradually the plane came under control and started\nto climb. The shells burst nearer as the plane took a straighter course\nand strove to fly out of the danger zone. Dr. Bird looked at the\nair-speed meter.\n\n\"A hundred and eighty,\" he shouted to Carnes. \"We'll be safely out of\nrange in a minute.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe bursts were mostly behind them now. Suddenly a blast of air struck\nthem with terrific force. Half a dozen holes appeared in the fabric of\nthe wings. A bit of high explosive shell plowed a way through the after\ncompartment and wrecked the duplicate instrument board. In another\nmoment they were out of range. Lieutenant McCready turned the nose of\nhis plane toward the north.\n\n\"We came out of that well,\" cried Carnes. Dr. Bird dropped the speaking\ntube which he had held pressed to his ear and smiled grimly at the\ndetective.\n\n\"I wish we had,\" he replied. \"Our main gas tank is punctured.\"\n\nAn expression of alarm crossed the detective's face.\n\n\"Is it injured badly?\" he asked.\n\n\"I don't know yet. McCready says that the gauge is dropping pretty\nrapidly. I'm going to go out and see what I can do.\"\n\n\"Can't I go, Doctor? I'm a good deal lighter than you are.\"\n\n\"You're not as strong or as agile, Carnes, and you haven't the\nmechanical ability to make the repair. Hand me that line.\"\n\nHe fastened one end of a coil of manila rope which Carnes handed him to\nhis waist, while the detective fastened the other end to one of the\nsafety belt hooks. With a word of farewell, he climbed out of the\ncockpit and onto a wing. In the pocket of his flying suit he carried a\ntool kit and repair material. Carnes shuddered as the doctor's figure\ndisappeared under the plane. He snubbed the rope about a seat bracket\nand held it taut. For ten minutes the strain continued. It slackened at\nlast, and the figure of the doctor reappeared on the wing. Slowly he\nclimbed into the cockpit.\n\n\"I've made a temporary repair, Lieutenant,\" he called into the speaking\ntube, \"and the leakage has stopped. How much gas have we left?\"\n\n\"Enough for about an hour of flying, including the emergency tank.\"\n\n\"Thunder! No chance to get back to the _Denver_. Better head inland and\nfollow the course of the Dwina. If we can locate the place we are\nlooking for we may be able to drop a few eggs on it before we are washed\nout. In any event, it will be better to come down on land than on\nwater.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMcCready headed the plane south and followed the winding ribbon below\nhim which marked the channel of the Dwina. He kept his altitude well\nover eight thousand feet. For a few minutes the plane roared along.\nWithout warning the motor sputtered once or twice and died.\n\n\"Gas finished?\" asked Dr. Bird into the speaking tube.\n\n\"No, there is plenty of gas for another forty-five minutes. It acted\nlike a short in the wiring. Maybe another fragment got us that we didn't\nknow about. I can glide to a safe landing, Doctor. Which direction shall\nI go?\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter,\" replied Dr. Bird as he looked over the side. \"Wait\na minute, it does matter. See that long low building down there with the\nprojection like a tower on top? I'll bet a month's pay that that is the\nvery place we're looking for. Glide over it and let's have a look at it.\nIf I am convinced of it, I'll drop a few eggs on it.\"\n\n\"Right!\"\n\nMcCready glided on a long slope toward the suspected building. Dr. Bird\nkept his eye glued to the bomb sight.\n\n\"It's suspicious enough for me to act,\" he cried. \"Drop one!\"\n\nCarnes pulled a lever and a hundred-pound high explosive bomb detached\nitself from the plane and fell toward the ground.\n\n\"Another!\" cried the doctor.\n\nA second messenger of death followed the first.\n\n\"Bank around and back over while we give them the rest.\"\n\n\"Right!\"\n\nThe plane swung around in a wide circle.\n\n\"Volley!\" cried the doctor. Carnes pulled the master lever and the rest\nof the bombs fell earthward.\n\n\"Now glide to the east, McCready, until you are forced down.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMcCready banked the plane and started on a long glide toward the east.\nCarnes and the doctor watched the falling bombs. The doctor's aim had\nbeen perfect. The first bomb released struck the building squarely while\nthe other landed only a few feet away. Instead of the puffs of smoke\nwhich they had expected, the bombs had no effect. The volley which\nCarnes had discharged fell full on the building as harmlessly as had the\ntwo pilot shots.\n\n\"Were these bombs armed, Lieutenant?\" demanded the doctor.\n\n\"Yes, sir. I inspected them myself before we took off and they were\nfused and armed. They had always fused and should have gone off, no\nmatter in what position they landed.\"\n\n\"Well, they didn't. That building is our goal all right. Saranoff would\nnaturally expect an air raid and he has perfected some device which\nrenders a bomb impotent before it lands. How far from the building will\nyou land?\"\n\n\"A couple of miles, Doctor.\"\n\n\"Get as far as you can. If you can make that line of thicket ahead,\nwe'll take to our heels and hope to hide in it.\"\n\n\"I don't think we'll have much luck, Doctor,\" said Carnes.\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Look behind.\"\n\nDr. Bird looked back toward the building they had tried to bomb. Across\nthe country, a truck loaded with armed men followed the course of the\nplane. The plane was gaining slightly on the truck but it was evident\nthat the plane's occupants would have little chance of escaping on foot.\nDr. Bird gave a grim laugh.\n\n\"We're cornered all right,\" he said. \"If we did elude the men in that\ntruck, we would have a plane after us in no time. You might as well turn\nback, McCready, and land fairly near the building. We are sure to be\ncaptured and our best chance is to have the plane near us. They'll\nprobably patch it up and if we get a chance to escape later, it may be a\nlifesaver. At any rate, we've lost for the present.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMcCready turned the plane again to the west. The truck halted at their\nnew maneuver. As the plane passed over, it turned and again followed\nthem. The ground was approaching rapidly. With a final dip, McCready\nleveled off and made a landing. The machine rolled to a stop about a\nmile from the building. The truck was less than three hundred yards\naway. It came up rapidly and disgorged a dozen men armed with rifles who\nhurried forward. In the lead was a tall, slight figure who carried no\ngun. Dr. Bird stepped forward to meet them.\n\n\"Do you understand English?\" he asked.\n\nAn incomprehensible jargon of Russian answered him. The men raised their\nrifles threateningly. Dr. Bird turned back to his companions.\n\n\"Resistance is hopeless,\" he said. \"Surrender gracefully and we'll see\nwhat comes of it.\"\n\nHe faced the Russians and held one hand high above his head. The Russian\nleader stepped forward and confiscated the doctor's pistol. He repeated\nthe process with Carnes and McCready, frisking them thoroughly for\nconcealed weapons. At his command, six of the Russians stepped forward.\nThe Americans took their place in the midst of the guard and were\nmarched to the truck. The balance of the Russians moved over to the\nAmerican's plane. The truck rolled forward and approached the low\nbuilding. The projection which Dr. Bird had noticed from the air proved\nto be a metal tube projection from the roof, fully twenty feet in\ndiameter and fifty feet long.\n\n\"A projection tube of some sort,\" said the doctor, pointing. An excited\ncommand came from the Russian in command. A rifle was leveled\nthreateningly at the doctor. He took the hint and maintained silence\nwhile they climbed down from the truck and approached the door of the\nbuilding.\n\nIt swung open as they approached. As they entered a strong garlic-like\nsmell was evident. The hum of heavy machinery smote their ears.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey were led down a corridor to a flight of steps. On the floor below\nthey went along another corridor to a heavy iron-studded door. The guide\nunlocked it with a huge key and swung it open. With a shrug of his\nshoulders, Dr. Bird led the way into the cell. The door closed behind\nthem and they were left alone. Dr. Bird turned to his companions.\n\n\"Be careful what you say,\" he whispered. \"I am not at all convinced that\nthere is no one here who knows English and we are probably spied upon.\nThere is almost sure to be a dictaphone somewhere in this room. We don't\nwant to give them any more information than we have to.\"\n\nCarnes and McCready nodded. Dr. Bird spoke aloud of inconsequential\nmatters while they explored the cell. It was a room some twenty feet\nsquare, fitted with three bunks on one side, built into the wall like\nthe berths on shipboard. The room was lighted by a single electric light\noverhead. A door opened into a lavatory equipped with running water.\n\n\"We're comfortable here, at any rate,\" said the doctor cheerfully. \"They\nevidently don't mean to make us suffer. I'd like to know why they took\nthe trouble to capture us, anyway. It would seem to be more in line with\ntheir usual policy to have shot us on sight. It must be that they want\nsome sort of information from us.\"\n\nNeither of his companions had a better reason to offer and conversation\nlanguished. For an hour they sat almost without speech. A sound at the\ndoor brought them to their feet. It opened and a Russian girl pushed in\na cart laden with food. She made no reply to the remarks which Dr. Bird\naddressed to her but quickly and silently put their food on the table.\nWhen she had completed her task, she left the room without having spoken\na word.\n\n\"Beautiful, but dumb,\" Dr. Bird remarked. \"Let's eat.\"\n\n\"Do you suppose that it's safe to eat this food, Doctor?\" asked Carnes\nin a whisper.\n\n\"I don't know, and I don't care. If we've got to go out, we might as\nwell be poisoned as shot. If we refuse food, they can poison us through\nour water. We couldn't refuse that for any length of time. I'm hungry\nand I'm going to make a good meal. What's this stuff, _bortsch_?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey soon received proof that they were under observation. Hardly had\nthey pushed back their chairs at the completion of the meal than the\ndoor opened and the Russian girl who had brought their food removed the\nempty dishes. Silence settled down over the cell. For another hour they\nwaited before the door opened again. A tall bearded Russian entered with\na younger man at his heels. The bearded man dropped into a chair while\nhis companion sat at the table and opened a notebook.\n\n\"Stand up!\" barked the Russian sternly.\n\nCarnes and McCready rose to their feet but Dr. Bird remained stretched\nout on a bed.\n\n\"What for?\" he demanded languidly.\n\nThe Russian bristled with rage.\n\n\"When I speak to you, you shall obey,\" he said in curiously clipped\nEnglish, \"else it will be the worse for you. Would you rather be\nquestioned while in the _strelska_ than while standing?\"\n\n\"Not by a long shot,\" replied Dr. Bird promptly as he rose to his feet.\n\"Fire away, old fellow. I'll talk.\"\n\n\"What are your names?\"\n\n\"I am Addison Sims of Seattle,\" replied Dr. Bird gravely, \"and my\nfriends are Mr. Earle Liedermann and Mr. Bernarr Macfadden. You may have\nread of us in the American magazines.\"\n\n\"Their names,\" said the Russian to his clerk, \"are Dr. Bird, of the\nBureau of Standards; Operative Carnes, of the United States Secret\nService; and Lieutenant McCready, of the United States Navy. Dr. Bird,\nyou will save yourself trouble if you will answer my future questions\ntruthfully.\"\n\n\"Then ask questions to which I am not sure that you know the answer,\"\nreplied the doctor dryly.\n\n\"What vessel brought you here?\"\n\n\"The _Denver_.\"\n\n\"What is her armament?\"\n\n\"Consult the Navy list. You will doubtless find a copy in your files. It\nmay be purchased from the Superintendent of Public Documents at\nWashington.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"What is your errand here?\"\n\n\"To consult with Ivan Saranoff and learn his future plans. If he means\nmerely to bestow on the northern hemisphere additional sunshine and\nwarmth, it is possible that the United States will not oppose him. We\nwould benefit equally with Russia, you know. Possibly the northern\ncountries could form some sort of an alliance against the southern\nhemisphere which is already threatening war.\"\n\n\"You chose a peculiar way of showing your peaceable intentions. You shot\ndown our plane without warning and you dropped bombs on us at first\nsight.\"\n\n\"But they didn't explode.\"\n\n\"No, thanks to our ray operators. Dr. Bird, I have no time to waste.\nEither you will answer my questions fully and truthfully or I will\nresort to torture.\"\n\n\"You don't dare. You were merely bluffing when you mentioned the\n_strelska_. If you tortured us, you would have to answer to Ivan\nSaranoff on his return.\"\n\n\"How did you know that he is--\" The Russian paused and bit his lip.\n\"Shall I tell him that you refuse to talk?\"\n\n\"When he returns, you may tell him that I will be glad to talk frankly\nwith him. I came to Russia for that purpose, but I will not talk with\none of his underlings. In the meanwhile, we are having lovely weather\nfor this time of year, aren't we?\"\n\nWith a muttered curse the Russian rose and left the room. Carnes turned\nto Dr. Bird.\n\n\"How did you know that Saranoff was away?\" he demanded.\n\n\"I didn't,\" replied Dr. Bird with a chuckle, \"it was merely a shrewd\nguess. We have twisted his tail so often that I figured he could not\nresist the temptation to come here and gloat a few gloats over us if he\nwere here. I know his ruthless methods in dealing with his subordinates\nand I knew that they would never dare to resort to torture in his\nabsence. No, old dear, we are safe until he returns. I hope he stays\naway a long time.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFour days passed monotonously. Three times a day the Russian girl\nappeared with ample meals. Despite their attempts to engage her in\nconversation, not a word would she reply or give any indication that she\neither heard or understood their remarks. The bearded Russian appeared\ndaily and tried to question them, but Dr. Bird laughed at his threats\nand reaffirmed his intention of talking to no one but Saranoff.\n\n\"Your chance will soon come,\" replied the Russian with an evil leer on\nthe fourth day. \"He will be here the day after to-morrow. He will be\nable to make you talk.\"\n\n\"If he's telling the truth, the jig's about up,\" said Dr. Bird when the\nRussian had left. \"I don't fancy that Saranoff will show us much mercy\nwhen he finds out what we've attempted to do.\"\n\n\"How would it be to overpower our waitress and make a break?\" asked\nMcCready in a guarded whisper.\n\n\"No good at all,\" replied the doctor decisively. \"We wouldn't have a\nChinaman's chance. Our best bet is to talk turkey to Saranoff. He may\nspare us if I can make him believe that I am willing to work for him.\nWhat a man he is! If we could turn his genius into the right channels,\nhe would be a blessing to the world.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe paused as the door swung open and the Russian girl appeared with\ntheir food. She placed the cart against the wall and suddenly turned and\nfaced them.\n\n\"Dr. Bird,\" she said in excellent English, \"I am Feodrovna Androvitch.\"\n\n\"I'm glad to know you,\" said Dr. Bird with a bow.\n\n\"Do you recognize my name?\"\n\n\"I'm very sorry, my dear, but it simply doesn't register.\"\n\n\"Do you remember Stefan Androvitch?\"\n\nA sudden light came into Dr. Bird's face.\n\n\"Yes,\" he exclaimed, \"I do. He used to work for me in the Bureau some\ntime ago. I had to let him go under peculiar circumstances. Is he\nrelated to you?\"\n\n\"He was my twin brother. The peculiar circumstances you refer to were\nthat you caught him stealing platinum. Instead of turning him over to\nthe police, you asked him why he stole. He told you his wife was dying\nfor lack of things that money would buy and he stole for her. You\nallowed him to quit his position honorably and you gave him money for\nhis immediate needs. For that act of mercy, I am here to reward you.\"\n\n\"Bread cast upon the waters,\" murmured Carnes. The Russian girl turned\non him like a wildcat.\n\n\"Unless you wish to deprive yourself and your companions of my help, you\nwill not quote the Bible, that sop thrown by the church to their slaves,\nto me,\" she said venomously. \"I am a woman of the proletariat!\"\n\n\"Respect the lady's anti-religious prejudices, Carnesy, old dear,\" said\nthe doctor with a smile. \"How do you propose to aid us, Miss\nAndrovitch?\"\n\n\"I will give you exactly what you gave my brother, your freedom and\nmoney for your immediate needs.\"\n\n\"Thanks. But, er--haven't you considered what your position here will\nbe if you aid us to escape? Saranoff doesn't deal kindly with traitors,\nI fancy.\"\n\nThe girl spat on the floor.\n\n\"That swine!\" she hissed, \"I would like to kill him. I would have done\nso long ago had not the hope of the people rested on his genius. When\nthe people finally triumph, I will feed his heart to my cat.\"\n\n\"Nice, gentle, loving disposition,\" murmured the doctor. \"All right, my\ndear, we're ready for anything. What's the first move?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe girl whisked the covers from the food cart and displayed three\npistols and belts of ammunition.\n\n\"Put these on,\" she said, \"and take this food with you. I will take you\nto a hiding place outside the walls where you may safely stay for a few\ndays. I will bring you fresh supplies of food. As quickly as possible I\nwill arrange for you to escape from Russia. When you have left Russia\nsafely, my debt is paid and you are again my enemies.\"\n\n\"But, listen here,\" said Dr. Bird persuasively, \"why don't you come with\nus? You know the object of our coming here. We aim to destroy this plant\nand let the earth take its normal tilt. You hate Saranoff, although I\ndon't know why. If you'll help us to destroy him, we'll guarantee you a\nwelcome in the United States and you can join your brother. I'll take\nhim back into my laboratory.\"\n\n\"My brother is dead,\" she said bitterly. \"After he left you, he fell\ninto more evil times. His wife died and he swore revenge upon the\nsociety which had murdered her. An opportunity came to him to join\nSaranoff, and he did so. Saranoff hated him and distrusted him, although\nhe was the soul of loyalty. As a reward for his genius and aid to\nSaranoff in constructing the black lamp, Saranoff abandoned him to you.\nIt was your men who killed him when you blew into nothingness the\nhelicopter he was piloting in your state of Maryland, near Washington.\"\n\n\"All the more reason why you should revenge yourself upon Saranoff,\"\nreplied the doctor. \"We will give you a chance to do so and aid you. We\nalso give you an opportunity to be received in a free country with\nhonor.\"\n\nAn expression of rage distorted the girl's features.\n\n\"I am a woman of the proletariat!\" she cried. \"I hate Ivan Saranoff for\nwhat he has done but I am loyal to him. He alone will force the\nbourgeoisie to their knees and establish the rule of the people. I hate\nyour country and your government; yes, and I hate you. I aid you because\nI must pay my just debts. Come, the way is clear for your escape. Don't\nask how I cleared it.\"\n\n\"Come on,\" said Dr. Bird with a shrug of his shoulders. \"There is no\narguing with convictions. She must act according to her lights, even as\nwe must act according to ours. Grab your guns and let's go.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe three buckled on the weapons and belts of ammunition and followed\nthe girl from the cell. Once outside she touched her lips for silence. A\ndoor barred their way but she opened it with a key which she withdrew\nfrom her dress. Outside the door, a guard slumbered noisily. At a motion\nfrom the girl, Carnes rolled him over on his face to quiet his snoring.\nHe moved and stirred, but did not wake.\n\nA few feet from the door the girl paused and faced the wall. She\nmanipulated a hidden lever and a panel swung open in the wall. She led\nthe way silently into the dark. As the panel closed behind her, a beam\nof light from an electric torch stabbed the darkness. Down a sloping\ntunnel they followed her for half a mile. The tunnel turned at right\nangles and led upward. At length they paused before another door. The\ngirl opened it and they stepped out into the night. As they did so, a\ndull booming struck their ears. The girl paused.\n\n\"The ship!\" she cried. \"Your ship! It is attacking Fort Novadwinskaja.\nThe factory will be awake in a moment! Run for your lives!\"\n\nEven as she spoke a pair of twinkling lights appeared far down the\ntunnel through which they had come. She turned as if to return down the\ntunnel. Dr. Bird caught her about the waist and clapped his hand over\nher mouth.\n\n\"Quick, Carnes, your belt,\" he cried. \"Tie her up. She meant to go down\nthat tunnel and give her life to delay them while we escaped. We'll save\nher in spite of herself.\"\n\nCarnes and McCready quickly bound the struggling girl with their belts.\nThey laid her on the ground beside the door and watched the oncoming\nlights.\n\n\"You two hold them back for the present,\" said the doctor. \"I'm going to\ntake Feodrovna away a bit and argue gently with her. If I can make her\nsee the light, we may accomplish our mission yet. If I can't, I'll come\nback and help you.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe picked up the girl in his arms and disappeared into the darkness.\nPistol in hand, the two men watched the oncoming lights. The men behind\nthe lights could not be seen, but from the sound of their footsteps it\nwas evident that there were quite a few of them.\n\n\"Had we better let them emerge from the door and then get them?\"\nwhispered Carnes.\n\n\"No. These heavy guns will drive a bullet through three men at short\nrange. Level your gun down the tunnel and fire when I give the word.\nRemember, every one is apt to shoot high in the dark.\"\n\nThe lights approached slowly. When they were twenty-five yards away,\nLieutenant McCready spoke. The quiet was shattered by the roar of two\nLuger pistols. Again and again the guns barked. A volley of fire came\nfrom the tunnel, but Carnes and the lieutenant were standing well away\nfrom the opening and they escaped unharmed. Their deadly fire poured\ninto the shambles until they were rewarded by the sound of retreating\nfeet.\n\n\"So ends round one,\" said Carnes with a laugh. \"I think we win on\npoints.\"\n\n\"They won't try a direct attack again,\" replied the lieutenant. \"Look\nout for a flank attack or from some new weapon. I don't like the way\nthose bombs failed to explode the other day.\"\n\nDr. Bird appeared from the darkness.\n\n\"McCready,\" he said in a voice vibrant with excitement, \"we're in luck.\nWe have come out less than a hundred yards from the point where our\nplane came down. It is still there. If the _Denver_ has approached\nwithin shooting range, we will have enough gas to make it. Try to get\nyour motor going.\"\n\n\"If it isn't completely washed out I'll have it going in a few minutes,\nDoctor,\" cried the pilot. \"I'm going down the tunnel and get those\nflash-lights those birds dropped when they pulled out. Where's the\ngirl?\"\n\n\"She's back by the plane,\" said the doctor with a chuckle. \"She is a\nspit-fire, all right. I took her gag off and she tried to bite me. I\ncouldn't get a word of anything but abuse out of her. Go ahead and get\nthe lights and I'll show you the plane.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn a few minutes they stood before the ship. It was apparently\nuninjured, but the spark was dead. Carnes went back to the tunnel mouth\nto guard against surprise while Dr. Bird and McCready labored over the\nmotor. Despite the best of both of them, no spark could be coaxed from\nthe coil. As a last resort, Dr. Bird short-circuited the cells with a\nscrewdriver blade. No answering spark came from the terminals.\n\n\"Dead as a mackerel,\" he remarked. \"I guess that ends that hope. Let's\nget the machine guns out of her. Well have another attack soon and\nthey'll be more effective than our pistols.\"\n\nIt was the work of a few minutes to dismount the two Brownings from the\nplane. Carrying the two guns, Dr. Bird joined Carnes while McCready\nstaggered along laden down with belts of ammunition.\n\n\"Do you remember that rocky knoll we passed just before we landed?\"\nasked the lieutenant. \"If we can get this stuff there before we are\nattacked, we'll have a much better chance than we will in the open.\"\n\n\"Good idea, Lieutenant. Carnes, connect yourself to one of these guns.\nI'll fasten the other on my back and carry Feodrovna. We can't leave her\nhere to Saranoff's tender mercies.\"\n\nThrough the night the little cavalcade made its way. The thunder of guns\nfrom Fort Novadwinskaja kept up and the sky to the north was lighted by\ntheir flashes. McCready's bump of direction proved to be a good one for\nthe sought-for retreat was soon located. As they deposited their burdens\nand looked back, the lights of two trucks could be seen approaching\nacross the plain from the factory. Hurriedly they mounted the machine\ngun. Dr. Bird straightened up and listened carefully.\n\n\"The guns are sounding less frequently,\" he said. \"Possibly the _Denver_\nhas had enough and is pulling out.\"\n\n\"If I know Captain Evans as well as I think I do, the _Denver_ is not\nretreating,\" replied McCready grimly.\n\n\"I hope she's hammering the fort out of existence,\" said the doctor.\n\"However, our main interest just now is on the land front. Gunners to\nthe fore. Carnes, you aren't so good at this, better let McCready and me\nhandle them.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe trucks approached slowly. Presently the American plane loomed up in\nthe glare of their headlights. A powerful searchlight mounted on the\nleading truck swept the country. Discovery was a matter of moments.\nLieutenant McCready trained his gun carefully and pressed the trigger. A\nrattle of fire came from the Browning. A crash was heard from the truck\nand the searchlight winked out.\n\n\"Bull's-eye!\" cried Carnes exultantly.\n\n\"Down, you fool!\" cried the doctor as he swept the detective from his\nfeet and threw him down behind a rock. His action was none too soon. A\nburst of machine gun fire came from the trucks and a hail of bullets\nsplattered on the rocks a few yards from them. McCready crawled back to\nhis gun.\n\n\"Wait a minute, Lieutenant,\" counseled the doctor. \"A burst of fire from\nhere will give them our location and probably do them little damage.\nWait until they try to rush us.\"\n\nThey did not have long to wait. A guttural shout came from a point a few\nyards away and the sound of running feet came to their ears. The rush\nwas directed toward a point a few yards to the left of where they\ncrouched. Dr. Bird swung his gun around. As the rush passed them, he\nreleased his trigger. A volley of screams and oaths from the plain\nanswered the crackle of the Browning. McCready's gun joined in with a\nstaccato burst of fire. The attack could not live before that rain of\ndeath. A few running feet were heard from the darkness and a few\ngroans. Presently the roar of a motor came from the direction of the\nparked trucks. It retreated into the distance and all was quiet.\n\n\"Round two goes to us on a knock-down,\" said Carnes jubilantly. \"What\nwill they do next, Doctor?\"\n\n\"Probably nothing until daylight, now that they know we have machine\nguns. I wish that we could make that thicket, but it's too far to try.\nIt'll be daylight in an hour or so.\"\n\nThe night was normally short in Archangel at that season of the year and\nthe unnatural lengthening of the day which Saranoff had accomplished\nmade it shorter still. In an hour red streamers in the east announced\nthe approach of daylight. Hardly had they appeared than a dull drone of\ntruck motors came from the direction of the factory.\n\n\"Round three is about to commence,\" announced Carnes. \"I wish that I\ncould do something.\"\n\n\"You can as soon as our ammunition runs out, which won't be long,\"\nreplied McCready. \"It will be a matter of pistols at close quarters.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe trucks approached to within a half mile and stopped. The distance\nwas too great to warrant wasting any of their scanty store of ammunition\nat such long range. In the dim light they would see the Russians working\nat the trucks. Presently a flash came from the plain. A whining sound\nfilled the air. With a crash a three-inch shell broke behind them.\n\n\"No fun,\" remarked the doctor. \"We'll have to get better cover than\nthis.\"\n\nA second shell whined through the air and burst over their heads. A\nthird burst a few yards in front of them.\n\n\"They have us bracketed now,\" said McCready. \"We'd better slide back a\npiece before they start rapid fire.\"\n\nDragging their prisoner with them, the three men made their way to the\nreverse side of the knoll. A short search revealed an overhanging ledge\nunder which they crouched in comparative safety from anything but a\ndirect hit above them.\n\n\"We're all right here except for the fact that they may rush us under\ncover of the fire,\" said the doctor. \"One man will have to keep watch\nall the time and it will be a dangerous detail. I'll take the first\nhitch.\"\n\n\"You will not!\" exclaimed Carnes emphatically. \"I have done nothing so\nfar and I am the least important member of the party. I'll do the\nwatching.\"\n\n\"Let's draw straws,\" suggested McCready. \"I'm willing to do that, but if\nit's a matter of volunteering, I refuse to yield to the civilian\nbranches of the government. The Navy has traditions to uphold, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"McCready's right,\" replied the doctor. \"Get straws, Lieutenant, and\nwe'll draw.\"\n\nMcCready picked up three bits of grass and held them out.\n\n\"The shortest goes on watch,\" he said. Carnes and the doctor drew,\nMcCready exhibited the remaining bit of grass. It was the shortest of\nthe three. He waited until the next shell burst above them and then\nstepped out from the shelter.\n\n\"I'll relieve you in fifteen minutes,\" said Carnes as he left.\n\n\"Right.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen the lieutenant had left, Dr. Bird removed the gag from Feodrovna's\nmouth and tried to argue with her, but the Russian girl only glared her\nhatred and refused to talk other than to abuse him. With a sigh, the\ndoctor gave over his efforts and talked to Carnes. The time passed\nslowly with a constant rain of shells on the knoll.\n\n\"It's time for my relief,\" said Carnes at length. As he spoke the hail\nof shells on the knoll ceased.\n\n\"What the dickens?\" cried the doctor.\n\nHe and Carnes jumped from their shelter and ran over the knoll. On the\nplain a few hundred yards from them, a straggling line of Russians were\nadvancing with fixed bayonets. McCready was nowhere in sight.\n\n\"Where the devil is McCready?\" cried the doctor. \"He must have been\nkilled. Hello, one of the guns is gone, too. There's only a belt and a\nhalf of ammunition left. I'll try to break that attack up.\"\n\nHe advanced to the gun and trained it carefully. When he pressed the\ntrigger a dull click came from the gun.\n\n\"Misfire!\" he cried. He drew back the bolt and inserted a fresh\ncartridge. Again the gun clicked harmlessly. Dr. Bird ejected the shell\nand examined it. A deep indentation appeared on the primer. Hurriedly he\ntried a half dozen more cartridges but they refused to explode. He\nturned a keen gaze toward the trucks. On the ground was set a tube-like\nprojector pointing toward them. Dr. Bird swore softly and jerked his\npistol from its holster. The hammer clicked futilely on a cartridge.\n\n\"Stymied!\" he exclaimed. \"They have that portable ray mechanism, with\nthem, which disabled our bombs. It's hand to hand, Carnesy, old dear. I\nwonder where McCready is.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Russians approached slowly, keeping their lines straight. They were\nwithin two hundred yards of the knoll. Suddenly from a point a hundred\nyards to the left of the end of the land came a rattle of fire. The\nattacking line dropped in a pile of grotesque heaps.\n\n\"It's McCready!\" shouted Carnes. A little ravine ran from the knoll\ntoward the trucks. Sitting in the ravine was the lieutenant, playing a\nBrowning machine gun on the line of attackers. When there were no more\nof them on their feet, he turned his gun on the trucks. Panic seized the\nRussians and they made a rush for their truck. Their leader leaped among\nthem, yelling furiously. They paused and turned to the projector tube.\nSlowly they swung it around. The lieutenant's gun ceased firing.\n\nAs the Russians rushed the now silent gun, Dr. Bird stepped to the gun\non the knoll. He trained it and pressed the trigger. A rattle of fire\ncame from it and two of the rushing figures fell. The attack paused for\nan instant. McCready had risen to his feet and was running up the ravine\nwith his gun under his arm.\n\n\"Good head!\" cried Dr. Bird, \"Clever work! Watch the fun now.\"\n\nHe ceased firing his gun. The Russians wavered and then rushed the point\nfrom which McCready had fired. The lieutenant allowed them to get to\nwithin a short distance and then crumpled the attack with another burst\nof fire from the flank. With cries of alarm, the Russians turned and\nfled toward their trucks. McCready ran along the ravine until he was\nwithin fifty yards of the standing machines. As the Russians approached,\none of them stepped to the truck crank. McCready's pistol spoke and he\ndropped. A second shared his fate. With cries of despair, the Russians\nclimbed into the remaining truck whose motor was running. Rapidly it\ndrove away across the plain. McCready rose from the ravine and ran\ntoward the standing truck. He started the motor and headed for the\nknoll.\n\n\"He's got a truck,\" cried Carnes. \"We can get away in it.\"\n\n\"Where to?\" demanded Dr. Bird. \"Archangel is between us and the\n_Denver_.\"\n\nThe truck came up.\n\n\"Come on, Doctor,\" cried McCready. \"Hurry up. We'll take the battery out\nof this truck and get our plane going.\"\n\n\"Oh, clever!\" cried Dr. Bird admiringly. \"Load that gun while I get\nFeodrovna, Carnesy. We'll get away safely yet.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe truck rolled up to the plane and stopped. While Carnes transferred\nthe prisoner and the guns to the plane, the lieutenant and Dr. Bird\nripped up the floor boards of the truck and exposed the battery. It was\na matter of moments to detach it and carry it to the plane. It would not\nfit in place but they anchored it in place with wire.\n\n\"You'd better hurry,\" cried Carnes. \"Here come a couple more trucks over\nthe plain.\"\n\n\"That'll do, Doctor,\" said McCready. \"Get on the prop and we'll see if\nthe old puddle jumper will take off.\"\n\nDr. Bird ran to the propeller.\n\n\"Ready!\" he cried.\n\n\"Contact!\" snapped McCready.\n\nThe plane motor roared into life. The ship moved slowly forward as Dr.\nBird climbed on board. Toward the oncoming trucks they rushed across the\nplain. A crash seemed imminent. In the nick of time McCready pulled back\non his joystick and the plane rose gracefully into the air, clearing the\nleading truck by inches. The truck halted and hastily mounted a machine\ngun.\n\n\"Too late!\" laughed the lieutenant. \"Now it's our turn for some fun.\"\n\nHe tapped the key of his radio transmitter. In a few seconds he received\nan answer.\n\n\"They have reduced Fort Novadwinskaja,\" he reported to the rear cockpit,\n\"but they don't know what to fire at next. Their largest guns will reach\nthe factory easily. Shall I start some fireworks?\"\n\n\"You may fire when ready, Gridly,\" chuckled Dr. Bird.\n\nAgain the lieutenant depressed his key. From their altitude of four\nthousand feet, they could see the _Denver_. From its forward turret\ncame a puff of smoke. There were a few moments of pause and then a cloud\nof black rose from the plain below them, half a mile from the factory.\nMcCready reported the position of the burst to the ship. A second shell\nburst beyond the factory and the third just in front of it.\n\n\"It's a clear bracket,\" said McCready. \"Now watch the gun. I'll give\nthem a salvo.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFrom the side of the _Denver_ came a cloud of black smoke as all of her\nturret guns fired in unison. The aim was perfect. For a few moments all\nwas quiet and then the factory disappeared in a smother of bursting high\nexplosive shells.\n\nHardly had the shells landed than a terrific sheet of lightning ripped\nacross the sky. The thunderclap which seemed to come simultaneously,\nrocked the plane like a feather. Sheet after sheet of lightning\nilluminated the sky while the roar of thunder was continuous. Rain fell\nin solid sheets. Even as they watched, it began to turn into snow. The\nair grew bitterly cold.\n\n\"The solar magnet is wrecked,\" shouted the doctor, \"and these storms are\nthe efforts of nature to return to normal.\"\n\n\"If they get any worse, we're doomed.\"\n\n\"But in a good cause.\"\n\nThrough the storm the plane raced. Suddenly the motor died with\nsickening suddenness.\n\n\"Our haywire battery connections are gone,\" shouted McCready. \"Say your\nprayers.\"\n\nThe wind tossed the plane about like a feather. Rapidly it lost\naltitude. A building loomed up before them. As a crash seemed imminent,\na gust of wind caught the plane and tossed it up into the air again. For\nseveral minutes the ground could not be seen through the rain. Suddenly\nthe plane hit an airpocket and dropped like a stone. With a splash it\nfell into the sea. A rift came for a moment in the curtain of rain.\n\n\"Look!\" cried Carnes.\n\nA hundred yards away, the _Denver_ rode at anchor.\n\n\"I'm only sorry about one thing,\" said Carnes ten minutes later as they\nchanged to dry clothes aboard the battle cruiser, \"and that is that\nSaranoff wasn't in the factory when that salvo fell on it.\"\n\n\"I'm glad he was away,\" replied Dr. Bird. \"With him absent, we succeeded\nin destroying it. If he had been there, our task would have been more\ndifficult and perhaps impossible. I am an enemy of Saranoff's, but I\ndon't underrate his colossal genius.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Solar Magnet, by Sterner St. Paul Meek\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE SOLAR MAGNET ***\n\n***** This file should be named 29401-8.txt or 29401-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/9/4/0/29401/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Tamise Totterdell and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
