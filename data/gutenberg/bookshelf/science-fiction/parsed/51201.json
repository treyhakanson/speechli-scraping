Dozens of limp little mutants that would have\nsent an academic zoologist into hysterics lay there in the metabolic\naccelerator. But there were three of _them_. My heart took a great\nbound.\n\nI heard my daughter's running feet in the animal rooms and her\nrollerskates banging at her side. I closed the accelerator and walked\nacross to the laboratory door. She twisted the knob violently, trying\nto hit a combination that would work.\n\nI unlocked the door, held it against her pushing and slipped out so\nthat, for all her peering, she could see nothing. I looked down on her\ntolerantly.\n\n\"Can't adjust your skates?\" I asked again.\n\n\"Daddy, I've tried and tried and I just can't turn this old key tight\nenough.\"\n\nI continued to look down on her.\n\n\"Well, Dad-dee, I can't!\"\n\n\"Tightly enough.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"You can't turn this old key tightly enough.\"\n\n\"That's what I _say_-yud.\"\n\n\"All right, wench. Sit on this chair.\"\n\nI got down and shoved one saddle shoe into a skate. It fitted\nperfectly. I strapped her ankle and pretended to use the key to tighten\nthe clamp.\n\nVolplas at last. Three of them. Yet I had always been so sure I could\ncreate them that I had been calling them volplas for ten years. No,\ntwelve. I glanced across the animal room to where old Nijinsky thrust\nhis graying head from a cage. I had called them volplas since the day\nold Nijinsky's elongated arms and his cousin's lateral skin folds had\ngiven me the idea of a flying mutant.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen Nijinsky saw me looking at him, he started a little tarantella\nabout his cage. I smiled with nostalgia when the fifth fingers of his\nhands, four times as long as the others, uncurled as he spun about the\ncage.\n\nI turned to the fitting of my daughter's other skate.\n\n\"Daddy?\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Mother says you are eccentric. Is that true?\"\n\n\"I'll speak to her about it.\"\n\n\"Don't you _know_?\"\n\n\"Do you understand the word?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nI lifted her out of the chair and stood her on her skates. \"Tell your\nmother that I retaliate. I say _she_ is beautiful.\"\n\nShe skated awkwardly between the rows of cages from which mutants with\nbrown fur and blue fur, too much and too little fur, enormously long\nand ridiculously short arms, stared at her with simian, canine or\nrodent faces. At the door to the outside, she turned perilously and\nwaved.\n\nAgain in the laboratory, I entered the metabolic accelerator and\nwithdrew the intravenous needles from my first volplas. I carried their\nlimp little forms out to a mattress in the lab, two girls and a boy.\nThe accelerator had forced them almost to adulthood in less than a\nmonth. It would be several hours before they would begin to move, to\nlearn to feed and play, perhaps to learn to fly.\n\nMeanwhile, it was clear that here was no war of dominant mutations.\nModulating alleles had smoothed the freakish into a beautiful pattern.\nThese were no monsters blasted by the dosage of radiation into crippled\nstructures. They were lovely, perfect little creatures.\n\nMy wife tried the door, too, but more subtly, as if casually touching\nthe knob while calling.\n\n\"Lunch, dear.\"\n\n\"Be right there.\"\n\nShe peeked too, as she had for fifteen years, but I blocked her view\nwhen I slipped out.\n\n\"Come on, you old hermit. I have a buffet on the terrace.\"\n\n\"Our daughter says I'm eccentric. Wonder how the devil she found out.\"\n\n\"From me, of course.\"\n\n\"But you love me just the same.\"\n\n\"I adore you.\" She stretched on tiptoe and put her arms over my\nshoulders and kissed me.\n\nMy wife did indeed have a delicious-looking buffet ready on the\nterrace. The maid was just setting down a warmer filled with hot\nhamburgers. I gave the maid a pinch and said, \"Hello, baby.\"\n\nMy wife looked at me with a puzzled smile. \"What on Earth's got into\nyou?\"\n\nThe maid beat it into the house.\n\nI flipped a hamburger and a slice of onion onto a plate and picked up\nthe ketchup and said, \"I've reached the dangerous age.\"\n\n\"Oh, good heavens!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI dowsed ketchup over the hamburger, threw the onion on and closed it.\nI opened a bottle of beer and guzzled from it, blew out my breath and\nlooked across the rolling hills and oak woods of our ranch to where the\nPacific shimmered. I thought, \"All this and three volplas, too.\"\n\nI wiped the back of my hand across my mouth and said aloud, \"Yes, sir,\nthe dangerous age. And, lady, I'm going to have fun.\"\n\nMy wife sighed patiently.\n\nI walked over and put the arm that held the beer bottle around her\nshoulder and chucked her chin up with my other hand. The golden sun\ndanced in her blue eyes. I watched that light in her beautiful eyes and\nsaid, \"But you're the only one I'm dangerous about.\"\n\nI kissed her until I heard rollerskates coming across the terrace from\none direction and a horse galloping toward the terrace from the other\ndirection.\n\n\"You have lovely lips,\" I whispered.\n\n\"Thanks. Yours deserve the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval, too.\"\n\nOur son reared the new palomino I had just bought him for his\nfourteenth birthday and yelled down, \"Unhand that maiden, Burrhead, or\nI'll give you lead poisoning.\"\n\nI laughed and picked up my plate and sat down in a chair. My wife\nbrought me a bowl of salad and I munched the hamburger and watched the\nboy unsaddle the horse and slap it away to the pasture.\n\nI thought, \"By God, wouldn't he have a fit if he knew what I have back\nthere in that lab! Wouldn't they all!\"\n\nThe boy carried the saddle up onto the terrace and dropped it. \"Mom,\nI'd like a swim before I eat.\" He started undressing.\n\n\"You _look_ as though a little water might help,\" she agreed, sitting\ndown next to me with her plate.\n\nThe girl was yanking off her skates. \"And I want one.\"\n\n\"All right. But go in the house and put on your swim suit.\"\n\n\"Oh, _Mother_. Why?\"\n\n\"Because, dear, I said so.\"\n\nThe boy had already raced across the terrace and jack-knifed into the\npool. The cool sound of the dive sent the girl scurrying for her suit.\n\nI looked at my wife. \"What's the idea?\"\n\n\"She's going to be a young woman soon.\"\n\n\"Is that any reason for wearing clothes? Look at him. He's a young\n_man_ sooner than already.\"\n\n\"Well, if you feel that way about it, they'll both have to start\nwearing clothes.\"\n\nI gulped the last of my hamburger and washed it down with the beer.\n\"This place is going to hell,\" I complained. \"The old man isn't allowed\nto pinch the maid and the kids can't go naked.\" I leaned toward her and\nsmacked her cheek. \"But the food and the old woman are still the best.\"\n\n\"Say, what goes with you? You've been grinning like a happy ape ever\nsince you came out of the lab.\"\n\n\"I told you--\"\n\n\"Oh, not that again! You were dangerous at any age.\"\n\nI stood up and put my plate aside and bent over her. \"Just the same,\nI'm going to have a new kind of fun.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe reached up and grabbed my ear. She narrowed her eyes and put a mock\ngrimness on her lips.\n\n\"It's a joke,\" I assured her. \"I'm going to play a tremendous joke on\nthe whole world. I've only had the feeling once before in a small way,\nbut I've always....\"\n\nShe twisted my ear and narrowed her eyes even more. \"Like?\"\n\n\"Well, when my old man was pumping his first fortune out of some oil\nwells in Oklahoma, we lived down there. Outside this little town, I\nfound a litter of flat stones that had young black-snakes under each\nslab. I filled a pail with them and took them into town and dumped them\non the walk in front of the movie just as Theda Bara's matinee let out.\nThe best part was that no one had seen me do it. They just couldn't\nunderstand how so many snakes got there. I learned how great it can be\nto stand around quietly and watch people encounter the surprise that\nyou have prepared for them.\"\n\nShe let go of my ear. \"Is that the kind of fun you're going to have?\"\n\n\"Yep.\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"Did I say you are _eccentric_?\"\n\nI grinned. \"Forgive me if I eat and run, dear. Something in the lab\ncan't wait.\"\n\nThe fact was that I had something more in the lab than I had bargained\nfor. I had aimed only at a gliding mammal a little more efficient than\nthe Dusky Glider of Australia, a marsupial. Even in the basically\nmutating colony, there had been a decidedly simian appearance in recent\nyears, a long shift from the garbage-dump rats I had started with. But\nmy first volplas were shockingly humanoid.\n\nThey were also much faster than had been their predecessors in\norganizing their nervous activity after the slumbrous explosion of\ngrowth in the metabolic accelerator. When I returned to the lab, they\nwere already moving about on the mattress and the male was trying to\nstand.\n\nHe was a little the larger and stood twenty-eight inches high. Except\nfor the face, chest and belly, they were covered with a soft, almost\ngolden down. Where it was bare of this golden fur, the skin was pink.\nOn their heads and across the shoulders of the male stood a shock of\nfur as soft as chinchilla. The faces were appealingly humanoid, except\nthat the eyes were large and nocturnal. The cranium was in the same\nproportion to the body as it is in the human.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen the male spread his arms, the span was forty-eight inches. I held\nhis arms out and tried to tease the spars open. They were not new. The\nspars had been common to the basic colony for years and were the result\nof serial mutations effecting those greatly elongated fifth fingers\nthat had first appeared in Nijinsky. No longer jointed like a finger,\nthe spar turned backward sharply and ran alongside the wrist almost to\nthe elbow. Powerful wrist muscles could snap it outward and forward.\nSuddenly, as I teased the male volpla, this happened.\n\nThe spars added nine inches on each side to his span. As they swept out\nand forward, the lateral skin that had, till now, hung in resting folds\nwas tightened in a golden plane that stretched from the tip of the spar\nto his waist and continued four inches wide down his legs to where it\nanchored at the little toe.\n\nThis was by far the most impressive plane that had appeared till now.\nIt was a true gliding plane, perhaps even a soaring one. I felt a\nthrill run along my back.\n\nBy four o'clock that afternoon, I was feeding them solid food and, with\nthe spars closed, they were holding little cups and drinking water from\nthem in a most humanlike way. They were active, curious, playful and\ndecidedly amorous.\n\nTheir humanoid qualities were increasingly apparent. There was a lumbar\ncurvature and buttocks. The shoulder girdle and pectoral muscles were\nheavy and out of proportion, of course, yet the females had only one\npair of breasts. The chin and jaw were humanlike instead of simian and\nthe dental equipment was appropriate to this structure. What this\nportended was brought home to me with a shock.\n\nI was kneeling on the mattress, cuffing and roughing the male as one\nmight a puppy dog, when one of the females playfully climbed up my\nback. I reached around and brought her over my shoulder and sat her\ndown. I stroked the soft fur on her head and said, \"Hello, pretty one.\nHello.\"\n\nThe male watched me, grinning.\n\nHe said, \"'Ello, 'ello.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs I walked into the kitchen, giddy with this enormous joke, my wife\nsaid, \"Guy and Em are flying up for dinner. That rocket of Guy's they\nlaunched in the desert yesterday was a success. It pulled Guy up to\nCloud Nine and he wants to celebrate.\"\n\nI danced a little jig the way old Nijinsky might do it. \"Oh, great!\nOh, wonderful! Good old Guy! Everybody's a success. It's great. It's\nwonderful. Success on success!\"\n\nI danced into the kitchen table and tipped over a basket of green corn.\nThe maid promptly left the kitchen for some other place.\n\nMy wife just stared at me. \"Have you been drinking the lab alcohol?\"\n\n\"I've been drinking the nectar of the gods. My Hera, you're properly\nmarried to Zeus. I've my own little Greeks descended from Icarus.\"\n\nShe pretended a hopeless sag of her pretty shoulders. \"Wouldn't you\njust settle for a worldly martini?\"\n\n\"I will, yes. But first a divine kiss.\"\n\nI sipped at my martini and lounged in a terrace chair watching the\ngolden evening slant across the beautiful hills of our ranch. I\ndreamed. I would invent a euphonious set of words to match the Basic\nEnglish vocabulary and teach it to them as their language. They would\nhave their own crafts and live in small tree houses.\n\nI would teach them legends: that they had come from the stars, that\nthey had subsequently watched the first red men and then the first\nwhite men enter these hills.\n\nWhen they were able to take care of themselves, I would turn them\nloose. There would be volpla colonies all up and down the Coast before\nanyone suspected. One day, somebody would see a volpla. The newspapers\nwould laugh.\n\nThen someone authoritative would find a colony and observe them. He\nwould conclude, \"I am convinced that they have a language and speak it\nintelligently.\"\n\nThe government would issue denials. Reporters would \"expose the truth\"\nand ask, \"Where have these aliens come from?\" The government would\nreluctantly admit the facts. Linguists would observe at close quarters\nand learn the simple volpla language. Then would come the legends.\n\nVolpla wisdom would become a cult--and of all forms of comedy, cults, I\nthink, are the funniest.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Darling, are you listening to me?\" my wife asked with impatient\npatience.\n\n\"What? Sure. Certainly.\"\n\n\"You didn't hear a word. You just sit there and grin into space.\" She\ngot up and poured me another martini. \"Here, maybe this will sober you\nup.\"\n\nI pointed. \"That's probably Guy and Em.\"\n\nA 'copter sidled over the ridge, then came just above the oak woods\ntoward us. Guy set it gently on the landing square and we walked down\nto meet them.\n\nI helped Em out and hugged her. Guy jumped out, asking, \"Do you have\nyour TV set on?\"\n\n\"No,\" I answered. \"Should I?\"\n\n\"It's almost time for the broadcast. I was afraid we would miss it.\"\n\n\"What broadcast?\"\n\n\"From the rocket.\"\n\n\"Rocket?\"\n\n\"For heaven's sake, darling,\" my wife complained, \"I told you about\nGuy's rocket being a success. The papers are full of it. So are the\nbroadcasts.\"\n\nAs we stepped up on the terrace, she turned to Guy and Em. \"He's out of\ncontact today. Thinks he's Zeus.\"\n\nI asked our son to wheel a TV set out onto the terrace while I made\nmartinis for our friends. Then we sat down and drank the cocktails and\nthe kids had fruit juice and we watched the broadcast Guy had tuned in.\n\nSome joker from Cal Tech was explaining diagrams of a multi-stage\nrocket.\n\nAfter a bit, I got up and said, \"I have something out in the lab I want\nto check on.\"\n\n\"Hey, wait a minute,\" Guy objected. \"They're about to show the shots of\nthe launching.\"\n\nMy wife gave me a look; you know the kind. I sat down. Then I got up\nand poured myself another martini and freshened Em's up, too. I sat\ndown again.\n\nThe scene had changed to a desert launching site. There was old Guy\nhimself explaining that when he pressed the button before him, the\nhatch on the third stage of the great rocket in the background would\nclose and, five minutes later, the ship would fire itself.\n\nGuy, on the screen, pushed the button, and I heard Guy, beside me, give\na sort of little sigh. We watched the hatch slowly close.\n\n\"You look real good,\" I said. \"A regular Space Ranger. What are you\nshooting at?\"\n\n\"Darling, will you please--be--_quiet_?\"\n\n\"Yeah, Dad. Can it, will you? You're always gagging around.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the screen, Guy's big dead-earnest face was explaining more about\nthe project and suddenly I realized that this was an instrument-bearing\nrocket they hoped to land on the Moon. It would broadcast from there.\nWell, now--say, that _would_ be something! I began to feel a little\nashamed of the way I had been acting and I reached out and slapped old\nGuy on the shoulder. For just a moment, I thought of telling him about\nmy volplas. But only for a moment.\n\nA ball of flame appeared at the base of the rocket. Miraculously, the\nmassive tower lifted, seemed for a moment merely to stand there on a\nflaming pillar, then was gone.\n\nThe screen returned to a studio, where an announcer explained that the\nfilm just shown had been taken day before yesterday. Since then, the\nrocket's third stage was known to have landed successfully at the south\nshore of Mare Serenitatis. He indicated the location on a large lunar\nmap behind him.\n\n\"From this position, the telemeter known as Rocket Charlie will be\nbroadcasting scientific data for several months. But now, ladies and\ngentlemen, we will clear the air for Rocket Charlie's only general\nbroadcast. Stand by for Rocket Charlie.\"\n\nA chronometer appeared on the screen and, for several seconds, there\nwas silence.\n\nI heard my boy whisper, \"Uncle Guy, this is the biggest!\"\n\nMy wife said, \"Em, I think I'll just faint.\"\n\nSuddenly there was a lunar landscape on the screen, looking just as\nit's always been pictured. A mechanical voice cut in.\n\n\"This is Rocket Charlie saying, 'Hello, Earth,' from my position in\nMare Serenitatis. First I will pan the Menelaus Mountains for fifteen\nseconds. Then I will focus my camera on Earth for five seconds.\"\n\nThe camera began to move and the mountains marched by, stark and\nawesomely wild. Toward the end of the movement, the shadow of the\nupright third stage appeared in the foreground.\n\nAbruptly the camera made a giddy swing, focused a moment, and we were\nlooking at Earth. At that time, there was no Moon over California. It\nwas Africa and Europe we were looking at.\n\n\"This is Rocket Charlie saying, 'Good-by, Earth.'\"\n\nWell, when that screen went dead, there was pandemonium around our\nterrace. Big old Guy was so happy, he was wiping tears from his eyes.\nThe women were kissing him and hugging him. Everybody was yelling at\nonce.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI used the metabolic accelerator to cut the volplas' gestation down to\none week. Then I used it to bring the infants to maturity in one month.\nI had luck right off. Quite by accident, the majority of the early\ninfants were females, which sped things up considerably.\n\nBy the next spring, I had a colony of over a hundred volplas and I shut\ndown the accelerator. From now on, they could have babies in their own\nway.\n\nI had devised the language for them, using Basic English as my model,\nand during the months while every female was busy in the metabolic\naccelerator, I taught the language to the males. They spoke it softly\nin high voices and the eight hundred words didn't seem to tax their\nlittle skulls a bit.\n\nMy wife and the kids went down to Santa Barbara for a week and I took\nthe opportunity to slip the oldest of the males and his two females out\nof the lab.\n\nI put them in the jeep beside me and drove to a secluded little valley\nabout a mile back in the ranch.\n\nThey were all three wide-eyed at the world and jabbered continuously.\nThey kept me busy relating their words for \"tree,\" \"rock,\" \"sky\" to the\nobjects. They had a little trouble with \"sky.\"\n\nUntil I had them out in the open country, it had been impossible to\nappreciate fully what lovely little creatures they were. They blended\nperfectly with the California landscape. Occasionally, when they raised\ntheir arms, the spars would open and spread those glorious planes.\n\nAlmost two hours went by before the male made it into the air. His\nplayful curiosity about the world had been abandoned momentarily and he\nwas chasing one of the girls. As usual, she was anxious to be caught\nand stopped abruptly at the bottom of a little knoll.\n\nHe probably meant to dive for her. But when he spread his arms, the\nspars snapped out and those golden planes sheared into the air. He\nsailed over her in a stunning sweep. Then he rose up and up until he\nhung in the breeze for a long moment, thirty feet above the ground.\n\nHe turned a plaintive face back to me, dipped worriedly and skimmed\nstraight for a thorn bush. He banked instinctively, whirled toward us\nin a golden flash and crashed with a bounce to the grass.\n\nThe two girls reached him before I did and stroked and fussed over him\nso that I could not get near. Suddenly he laughed with a shrill little\nwhoop. After that, it was a carnival.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey learned quickly and brilliantly. They were not fliers; they were\ngliders and soarers. Before long, they took agilely to the trees and\nlaunched themselves in beautiful glides for hundreds of feet, banking,\nturning and spiraling to a gentle halt.\n\nI laughed out loud with anticipation. Wait till the first pair of these\nwas brought before a sheriff! Wait till reporters from the _Chronicle_\nmotored out into the hills to witness this!\n\nOf course, the volplas didn't want to return to the lab. There was a\ntiny stream through there and at one point it formed a sizable pool.\nThey got into this and splashed their long arms about and they scrubbed\neach other. Then they got out and lay on their backs with the planes\nstretched to dry.\n\nI watched them affectionately and wondered about the advisability of\nleaving them out here. Well, it had to be done sometime. Nothing I\ncould tell them about surviving would help them as much as a little\nactual surviving. I called the male over to me.\n\nHe came and squatted, conference fashion, the elbows resting on the\nground, the wrists crossed at his chest. He spoke first.\n\n\"Before the red men came, did we live here?\"\n\n\"You lived in places like this all along these mountains. Now there\nare very few of you left. Since you have been staying at my place, you\nnaturally have forgotten the ways of living outdoors.\"\n\n\"We can learn again. We want to stay here.\" His little face was so\nsolemn and thoughtful that I reached out and stroked the fur on his\nhead reassuringly.\n\nWe both heard the whir of wings overhead. Two mourning doves flew\nacross the stream and landed in an oak on the opposite hillside.\n\nI pointed. \"There's your food, if you can kill it.\"\n\nHe looked at me. \"How?\"\n\n\"I don't think you can get at them in the tree. You'll have to soar up\nabove and catch one of them on the wing when they fly away. Think you\ncan get up that high?\"\n\nHe looked around slowly at the breeze playing in the branches and\ndancing along the hillside grass. It was as if he had been flying a\nthousand years and was bringing antique wisdom to bear. \"I can get up\nthere. I can stay for a while. How long will they be in the tree?\"\n\n\"Chances are they won't stay long. Keep your eye on the tree in case\nthey leave while you are climbing.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe ran to a nearby oak and clambered aloft. Presently he launched\nhimself, streaked down-valley a way and caught a warm updraft on a\nhillside. In no time, he was up about two hundred feet. He began\ncriss-crossing the ridge, working his way back to us.\n\nThe two girls were watching him intently. They came over to me\nwonderingly, stopping now and then to watch him. When they were\nstanding beside me, they said nothing. They shaded their eyes with\ntiny hands and watched him as he passed directly above us at about two\nhundred and fifty feet. One of the girls, with her eyes fast on his\nsoaring planes, reached out and grasped my sleeve tightly.\n\nHe flashed high above the stream and hung behind the crest of the hill\nwhere the doves rested. I heard their mourning from the oak tree. It\noccurred to me they would not leave that safety while the hawklike\nsilhouette of the volpla marred the sky so near.\n\nI took the girl's hand from my sleeve and spoke to her, pointing as I\ndid so. \"He is going to catch a bird. The bird is in that tree. You\ncan make the bird fly so that he can catch it. Look here.\" I got up and\nfound a stick. \"Can you do this?\"\n\nI threw the stick up into a tree near us. Then I found her a stick. She\nthrew it better than I had expected.\n\n\"Good, pretty one. Now run across the stream and up to that tree and\nthrow a stick into it.\"\n\nShe climbed skillfully into the tree beside us and launched herself\nacross the stream. She swooped up the opposite hillside and landed\nneatly in the tree where the doves rested.\n\nThe birds came out of the tree, climbing hard with their graceful\nstrokes.\n\nI looked back, as did the girl remaining beside me. The soaring volpla\nhalf closed his planes and started dropping. He became a golden flash\nacross the sky.\n\nThe doves abruptly gave up their hard climbing and fell away with\nswiftly beating wings. I saw one of the male volpla's planes open a\nlittle. He veered giddily in the new direction and again dropped like a\nmolten arrow.\n\nThe doves separated and began to zigzag down the valley. The volpla did\nsomething I would not have anticipated--he opened his planes and shot\nlower than the bird he was after, then swept up and intercepted the\nbird's crossward flight.\n\nI saw the planes close momentarily. Then they opened again and the bird\nplummeted to a hillside. The volpla landed gently atop the hill and\nstood looking back at us.\n\nThe volpla beside me danced up and down shrieking in a language all her\nown. The girl who had raised the birds from the tree volplaned back to\nus, yammering like a bluejay.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was a hero's welcome. He had to walk back, of course--he had no\nway to carry such a load in flight. The girls glided out to meet\nhim. Their lavish affection held him up for a time, but eventually he\nstrutted in like every human hunter.\n\nThey were raptly curious about the bird. They poked at it, marveled at\nits feathers and danced about it in an embryonic rite of the hunt. But\npresently the male turned to me.\n\n\"We _eat_ this?\"\n\nI laughed and took his tiny, four-fingered hand. In a sandy spot\nbeneath a great tree that overhung the creek, I built a small fire for\nthem. This was another marvel, but first I wanted to teach them how to\nclean the bird. I showed them how to spit it and turn it over their\nfire.\n\nLater, I shared a small piece of the meat in their feast. They were\ngleeful and greasily amorous during the meal.\n\nWhen I had to leave, it was dark. I warned them to stand watches, keep\nthe fire burning low and take to the tree above if anything approached.\nThe male walked a little away with me when I left the fire.\n\nI said again, \"Promise me you won't leave here until we've made you\nready for it.\"\n\n\"We like it here. We will stay. Tomorrow you bring more of us?\"\n\n\"Yes. I will bring many more of you, if you promise to keep them all\nhere in this woods until they're ready to leave.\"\n\n\"I promise.\" He looked up at the night sky and, in the firelight, I saw\nhis wonder. \"You say we came from there?\"\n\n\"The old ones of your kind told me so. Didn't they tell you?\"\n\n\"I can't remember any old ones. You tell me.\"\n\n\"The old ones told me you came long before the red men in a ship from\nthe stars.\" Standing there in the dark, I had to grin, visioning the\nSunday supplements that would be written in about a year, maybe even\nless.\n\nHe looked into the sky for a long time. \"Those little lights are the\nstars?\"\n\n\"That's right.\"\n\n\"Which star?\"\n\nI glanced about and presently pointed over a tree. \"From Venus.\" Then\nI realized I had blundered by passing him an English name. \"In your\nlanguage, Pohtah.\"\n\nHe looked at the planet a long time and murmured, \"Venus. Pohtah.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat next week, I transported all of the volplas out to the oak woods.\nThere were a hundred and seven men, women and children. With no design\non my part, they tended to segregate into groups consisting of four to\neight couples together with the current children of the women. Within\nthese groups, the adults were promiscuous, but apparently not outside\nthe group. The group thus had the appearance of a super-family and the\nmales indulged and cared for all the children without reference to\nactual parenthood.\n\nBy the end of the week, these super-families were scattered over\nabout four square miles of the ranch. They had found a new delicacy,\nsparrows, and hunted them easily as they roosted at night. I had taught\nthe volplas to use the fire drill and they were already utilizing the\nlocal grasses, vines and brush to build marvelously contrived tree\nhouses in which the young, and sometimes the adults, slept through\nmidday and midnight.\n\nThe afternoon my family returned home, I had a crew of workmen out\ntearing down the animal rooms and lab building. The caretakers\nhad anesthetized all the experimental mutants, and the metabolic\naccelerator and other lab equipment was being dismantled. I wanted\nnothing around that might connect the sudden appearance of the volplas\nwith my property. It was already apparent that it would take the\nvolplas only a few more weeks to learn their means of survival and\ndevelop an embryonic culture of their own. Then they could leave my\nranch and the fun would be on.\n\nMy wife got out of the car and looked around at the workmen hurrying\nabout the disemboweled buildings and she said, \"What on Earth is going\non here?\"\n\n\"I've finished my work and we no longer need the buildings. I'm going\nto write a paper about my results.\"\n\nMy wife looked at me appraisingly and shook her head. \"I thought you\nmeant it. But you really ought to. It would be your first.\"\n\nMy son asked, \"What happened to the animals?\"\n\n\"Turned them over to the university for further study,\" I lied.\n\n\"Well,\" he said to her, \"you can't say our pop isn't a man of decision.\"\n\nTwenty-four hours later, there wasn't a sign of animal experimentation\non the ranch.\n\nExcept, of course, that the woods were full of volplas. At night, I\ncould hear them faintly when I sat out on the terrace. As they passed\nthrough the dark overhead, they chattered and laughed and sometimes\nmoaned in winged love. One night a flight of them soared slowly across\nthe face of the full Moon, but I was the only one who noticed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI made daily trips out to the original camp to meet the oldest of the\nmales, who had apparently established himself as a chief of all the\nvolpla families. He assured me that the volplas were staying close to\nthe ranch, but complained that the game was getting scarce. Otherwise\nthings were progressing nicely.\n\nThe males now carried little stone-tipped spears with feathered shafts\nthat they could throw in flight. They used them at night to bring down\nroosting sparrows and in the day to kill their biggest game, the local\nrabbits.\n\nThe women wore bluejay feathers on their heads. The men wore plumes of\ndove feathers and sometimes little skirts fashioned of rabbit down. I\ndid some reading on the subject and taught them crude tanning of their\nrabbit and squirrel hides for use in their tree homes.\n\nThe tree homes were more and more intricately wrought with expert\nbasketry for walls and floor and tight thatching above. They were well\ncamouflaged from below, as I suggested.\n\nThese little creatures delighted me more and more. For hours, I could\nwatch the adults, both the males and females, playing with the children\nor teaching them to glide. I could sit all afternoon and watch them at\nwork on a tree house.\n\nSo one day my wife asked, \"How _does_ the mighty hunter who now returns\nfrom the forest?\"\n\n\"Oh, fine. I've been enjoying the local animal life.\"\n\n\"So has our daughter.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"She has two of them up in her room.\"\n\n\"Two what?\"\n\n\"I don't know. What do _you_ call them?\"\n\nI went up the stairs three at a time and burst into my daughter's room.\n\nThere she sat on her bed reading a book to two volplas.\n\nOne of the volplas grinned and said in English, \"Hello there, King\nArthur.\"\n\n\"What's going on here?\" I demanded of all three.\n\n\"Nothing, Daddy. We're just reading like we always do.\"\n\n\"Like _always_? How long has this been going on?\"\n\n\"Oh, weeks and weeks. How long has it been since you came here that\nfirst time to visit me, Fuzzy?\"\n\nThe impolite volpla who had addressed me as King Arthur grinned at her\nand calculated. \"Oh, weeks and weeks.\"\n\n\"But you're teaching them to read English.\"\n\n\"Of course. They're such good pupils and so grateful. Daddy, you won't\nmake them go away, will you? We love each other, don't we?\"\n\nBoth volplas nodded vigorously.\n\nShe turned back to me. \"Daddy, did you know they can fly? They can fly\nright out of the window and way up in the sky.\"\n\n\"Is that a fact?\" I said testily. I looked coldly at the two volplas.\n\"I'm going to speak to your chief.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBack downstairs again, I raved at my wife. \"Why didn't you tell me a\nthing like this was going on? How could you let such an unusual thing\ngo on and not discuss it with me?\"\n\nMy wife got a look on her face that I don't see very often. \"Now you\nlisten to me, mister. Your whole life is a secret from us. Just what\nmakes you think your daughter can't have a little secret of her own?\"\n\nShe got right up close to me and her blue eyes snapped little sparks\nall over me. \"The fact is that I was wrong to tell you at all. I\npromised her I wouldn't tell _anyone_. Look what happened when I did.\nYou go leaping around the house like a raving maniac just because a\nlittle girl has a secret.\"\n\n\"A fine secret!\" I yelled. \"Didn't it occur to you this might be\ndangerous? Those creatures are over-sexed and....\" I stumbled into an\nawful silence while she gave me the dirtiest smile since the days of\nthe Malatestas.\n\n\"How did _you_ ... suddenly get to _be_ ... the palace eunuch? Those\nare sweet lovable little creatures without a harm in their furry little\nbodies. But don't think I don't realize what's been going on. You\ncreated them yourself. So, if they have any dirty ideas, I know where\nthey got them.\"\n\nI stormed out of the house. I spun the jeep out of the yard and ripped\noff through the woods.\n\nThe chief was sitting at home as comfortable as you please. He was\nleaning back against the great oak that hid his tree house. He had a\nlittle fire going and one of the women was roasting a sparrow for him.\nHe greeted me in volpla language.\n\n\"Do you realize,\" I blurted angrily, \"that there are two volplas in my\ndaughter's bedroom?\"\n\n\"Why, yes,\" he answered calmly. \"They go there every day. Is there\nanything wrong with that?\"\n\n\"She's teaching them the words of men.\"\n\n\"You told us some men may be our enemies. We are anxious to know their\nwords, the better to protect ourselves.\"\n\nHe reached around behind the tree and, right there in broad daylight,\nthat volpla pulled a copy of the San Francisco _Chronicle_ out of\nhiding. He held it up apologetically. \"We have been taking it for some\ntime from the box in front of your house.\"\n\nHe spread the paper on the ground between us. I saw by the date that it\nwas yesterday's. He said proudly, \"From the two who go to your house, I\nhave learned the words of men. As men say, I can 'read' most of this.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI just stood there gaping at him. How could I possibly recoup this\nsituation so that the stunning joke of the volplas wouldn't be lost?\nWould it seem reasonable that the volplas, by observing and listening\nto men, had learned their language? Or had they been taught it by a\nhuman friend?\n\nThat was it--I would just have to sacrifice anonymity. My family and I\nhad found a colony of them on our ranch and taught them English. I was\nstuck with it because it was the truth.\n\nThe volpla waved his long thin arm over the front page. \"Men are\ndangerous. They will shoot us with their guns if we leave here.\"\n\nI hastened to reassure him. \"It will not be like that. When men\nhave learned about you, they will leave you alone.\" I stated this\nemphatically, but for the first time I was beginning to see this might\nnot be a joke to the volplas. Nevertheless, I went on. \"You must\ndisperse the families at once. You stay here with your family so we\nremain in contact, but send the other families to other places.\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"We cannot leave these woods. Men would shoot us.\"\n\nThen he stood and looked squarely at me with his nocturnal eyes.\n\"Perhaps you are not a good friend. Perhaps you have lied to us. Why\nare you saying we should leave this safety?\"\n\n\"You will be happier. There will be more game.\"\n\nHe continued to stare directly at me. \"There will be men. One has\nalready shot one of us. We have forgiven him and are friends. But one\nof us is dead.\"\n\n\"You are friends with _another_ man?\" I asked, stunned.\n\nHe nodded and pointed up the valley. \"He is up there today with another\nfamily.\"\n\n\"Let's go!\"\n\nHe had the advantage of short glides, but the volpla chief couldn't\nkeep up with me. Sometimes trotting, sometimes walking fast, I got way\nahead of him. My hard breathing arose as much out of my anxiety about\nthe manner of handling this stranger as it did out of the exertion.\n\nI rounded a bend in the creek and there was my son sitting on the grass\nnear a cooking fire playing with a baby volpla and talking in English\nto an adult volpla who stood beside him. As I approached, my son tossed\nthe baby into the air. The tiny planes opened and the baby drifted down\nto his waiting hands.\n\nHe said to the volpla beside him, \"No, I'm sure you didn't come from\nthe stars. The more I think about it, the more I'm sure my father--\"\n\nI yelled from behind them, \"What business do you have telling them\nthat?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe male volpla jumped about two feet. My son turned his head slowly\nand looked at me. Then he handed the baby to the male and stood up.\n\n\"You haven't any business out here!\" I was seething. He had destroyed\nthe whole store of volpla legends with one small doubt.\n\nHe brushed the grass from his trousers and straightened. The way he was\nlooking at me, I felt my anger turning to a kind of jelly.\n\n\"Dad, I killed one of these little people yesterday. I thought he was a\nhawk and I shot him when I was out hunting. I wouldn't have done that\nif you had told me about them.\"\n\nI couldn't look at him. I stared at the grass and my face got hot.\n\n\"The chief tells me that you want them to leave the ranch soon. You\nthink you're going to play a big joke, don't you?\"\n\nI heard the chief come up behind me and stand quietly at my back.\n\nMy son said softly, \"I don't think it's much of a joke, Dad. I had to\nlisten to that one crying after I hit him.\"\n\nThere were big black trail ants moving in the grass. It seemed to me\nthere was a ringing sound in the sky. I raised my head and looked at\nhim. \"Son, let's go back to the jeep and we can talk about it on the\nway home.\"\n\n\"I'd rather walk.\" He sort of waved to the volpla he had been talking\nto and then to the chief. He jumped the creek and walked away into the\noak woods.\n\nThe volpla holding the baby stared at me. From somewhere far up the\nvalley, a crow was cawing. I didn't look at the chief. I turned and\nbrushed past him and walked back to the jeep alone.\n\nAt home, I opened a bottle of beer and sat out on the terrace to wait\nfor my son. My wife came toward the house with some cut flowers from\nthe garden, but she didn't speak to me. She snapped the blades of the\nscissors as she walked.\n\nA volpla soared across the terrace and landed at my daughter's bedroom\nwindow. He was there only briefly and relaunched himself. He was\nfollowed from the window in moments by the two volplas I had left with\nmy daughter earlier in the afternoon. I watched them with a vague\nunease as the three veered off to the east, climbing effortlessly.\n\nWhen I finally took a sip of my beer, it was already warm. I set it\naside. Presently my daughter ran out onto the terrace.\n\n\"Daddy, my volplas left. They said good-by and we hadn't even finished\nthe TV show. They said they won't see me again. Did you make them\nleave?\"\n\n\"No. I didn't.\"\n\nShe was staring at me with hot eyes. Her lower lip protruded and\ntrembled like a pink tear drop.\n\n\"Daddy, you did so.\" She stomped into the house, sobbing.\n\nMy God! In one afternoon, I had managed to become a palace eunuch, a\nmurderer and a liar!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMost of the afternoon went by before I heard my son enter the house. I\ncalled to him and he came out and stood before me. I got up.\n\n\"Son, I can't tell you how sorry I am for what happened to you. It\nwas my fault, not yours at all. I only hope you can forget the shock\nof finding out what sort of creature you had hit. I don't know why I\ndidn't anticipate that such things would happen. It was just that I was\nso intent on mystifying the whole world that I....\"\n\nI stopped. There wasn't anything more to say.\n\n\"Are you going to make them leave the ranch?\" he asked.\n\nI was aghast. \"After what has happened?\"\n\n\"Gee, what _are_ you going to do about them, Dad?\"\n\n\"I've been trying to decide. I don't know what I should do that will be\nbest for them.\" I looked at my watch. \"Let's go back out and talk to\nthe chief.\"\n\nHis eyes lighted and he clapped me on the shoulder, man to man. We ran\nout and got into the jeep and drove back up to the valley. The late\nafternoon Sun glared across the landscape.\n\nWe didn't say much as we wound up the valley between the darkening\ntrees. I was filled more and more with the unease that had seized me\nas I watched the three volplas leave my terrace and climb smoothly and\npurposefully into the east.\n\nWe got out at the chief's camp and there were no volplas around. The\nfire had burned down to a smolder. I called in the volpla language, but\nthere was no answer.\n\nWe went from camp to camp and found dead fires. We climbed to their\ntree houses and found them empty. I was sick and scared. I called\nendlessly till I was hoarse.\n\nAt last, in the darkness, my son put a hand on my arm. \"What are you\ngoing to do, Dad?\"\n\nStanding there in those terribly silent woods, I trembled. \"I'll have\nto call the police and the newspapers and warn everybody.\"\n\n\"Where do you suppose they've gone?\"\n\nI looked to the east where the stars, rising out of the great pass in\nthe mountains, glimmered like a deep bowl of fireflies.\n\n\"The last three I saw were headed that way.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe had been gone from the house for hours. When we stepped out onto the\nlighted terrace, I saw the shadow of a helicopter down on the strip.\nThen I saw Guy sitting near me in a chair. He was holding his head in\nhis hands.\n\nEm was saying to my wife, \"He was beside himself. There wasn't a\nthing he could do. I had to get him away from there and I thought you\nwouldn't mind if we flew over here and stayed with you till they've\ndecided what to do.\"\n\nI walked over and said, \"Hello, Guy. What's the matter?\"\n\nHe raised his head and then stood and shook hands. \"It's a mess. The\nwhole project will be ruined and we don't dare go near it.\"\n\n\"What happened?\"\n\n\"Just as we set it off--\"\n\n\"Set what off?\"\n\n\"The rocket.\"\n\n\"Rocket?\"\n\nGuy groaned.\n\n\"The _Venus_ rocket! Rocket Harold!\"\n\nMy wife interjected. \"I was telling Guy we didn't know a thing about it\nbecause they haven't delivered our paper in weeks. I've complained--\"\n\nI waved her to silence. \"Go on,\" I demanded of Guy.\n\n\"Just as I pushed the button and the hatch was closing, a flock of owls\ncircled the ship. They started flying through the hatch and somehow\nthey jammed it open.\"\n\nEm said to my wife, \"There must have been a hundred of them. They kept\ncoming and coming and flying into that hatch. Then they began dumping\nout all the recording instruments. The men tried to run a motor-driven\nladder up to the ship and those owls hit the driver on the head and\nknocked him out with some kind of instrument.\"\n\nGuy turned his grief-stricken face to me. \"Then the hatch closed and we\ndon't dare go near the ship. It was supposed to fire in five minutes,\nbut it hasn't. Those damned owls could have....\"\n\nThere was a glare in the east. We all turned and saw a brief streak of\ngilt pencil its way up the black velvet beyond the mountains.\n\n\"That's it!\" Guy shouted. \"That's the ship!\" Then he moaned. \"A total\nloss.\"\n\nI grabbed him by the shoulders. \"You mean it won't make it to Venus?\"\n\nHe jerked away in misery. \"Sure, it will make it. The automatic\ncontrols can't be tampered with. But the rocket is on its way without\nany recording instruments or TV aboard. Just a load of owls.\"\n\nMy son laughed. \"Owls! My dad can tell you a thing or two.\"\n\nI silenced him with a scowl. He shut up, then danced off across the\nterrace. \"Man, man! This is the biggest! The most--the greatest--the\nend!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe phone was ringing. As I went to the box on the terrace, I grabbed\nmy boy's arm. \"Don't you breathe a word.\"\n\nHe giggled. \"The joke is on you, Pop. Why should I say anything? I'll\njust grin once in a while.\"\n\n\"Now you cut that out.\"\n\nHe held onto my arm and walked toward the phone box with me, half\nconvulsed. \"Wait till men land on Venus and find Venusians with a\nlegend about their Great White Father in California. That's when I'll\ntell.\"\n\nThe phone call was from a screaming psychotic who wanted Guy. I stood\nnear Guy while he listened to the excited voice over the wire.\n\nPresently Guy said, \"No, no. The automatic controls will correct for\nthe delay in firing. It isn't that. It's just that there aren't any\ninstruments.... What? What just happened? Calm down. I can't understand\nyou.\"\n\nI heard Em say to my wife, \"You know, the strangest thing occurred out\nthere. I _thought_ it looked like those owls were carrying things on\ntheir backs. One of them dropped something and I saw the men open a\npackage wrapped in a leaf. You'd never believe what was in it--three\nlittle birds roasted to a nice brown!\"\n\nMy son nudged me. \"Smart owls. Long trip.\"\n\nI put my hand over his mouth. Then I saw that Guy was holding the\nreceiver limply away from his ear.\n\nHe spluttered. \"They just taped a radio message from the rocket. It's\ntrue that the radio wasn't thrown out. But we didn't have a record like\n_this_ on that rocket.\"\n\nHe yelled into the phone. \"Play it back.\" He thrust the receiver at me.\n\nFor a moment, there was only a gritty buzz from the receiver. Then the\ntape started playing a soft, high voice. \"This is Rocket Harold saying\neverything is well. This is Rocket Harold saying good-by to men.\" There\nwas a pause and then, in clear volpla language, another voice spoke.\n\"Man who made us, we forgive you. We know we did not come from the\nstars, but we go there. I, chief, give you welcome to visit. Good-by.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe all stood around too exhausted by the excitement to say anything. I\nwas filled with a big, sudden sadness.\n\nI stood for a long time and looked out to the east, where the sprawling\nmountain range held a bowl of dancing fireflies between her black\nbreasts.\n\nPresently I said to old Guy, \"How long do you think it will be before\nyou have a manned rocket ready for Venus?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Volpla, by Wyman Guin\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK VOLPLA ***\n\n***** This file should be named 51201.txt or 51201.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/1/2/0/51201/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
