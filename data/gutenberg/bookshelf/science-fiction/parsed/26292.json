SCHMITZ\n\nIllustrated by FINLAY\n\n\n    _On a bleak, distant unchartered world two ships lay wrecked and a\n    lone man stared at a star hyacinth. Its brilliance burned into his\n    retina ... and he knew that men could easily kill and kill for that\n    one beauty alone._\n\n\nThe robbery of the Dosey Asteroids Shipping Station in a remote and\nspottily explored section of space provided the newscasting systems of\nthe Federation of the Hub with one of the juiciest crime stories of the\nseason. In a manner not clearly explained, the Dosey Asteroids Company\nhad lost six months' production of gem-quality cut star hyacinths\nvalued at nearly a hundred million credits. It lost also its Chief\nLapidary and seventy-eight other company employees who had been in the\nstation dome at the time.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAll these people appeared at first to have been killed by gunfire, but a\nstudy of their bodies revealed that only in a few instances had gun\nwounds been the actual cause of death. For the most part the wounds had\nbeen inflicted on corpses, presumably in an attempt to conceal the fact\nthat disaster in another and unknown form had befallen the station.\n\nThe raiders left very few clues. It appeared that the attack on the\nstation had been carried out by a single ship, and that the locks to the\ndome had been opened from within. The latter fact, of course, aroused\nspeculation, but led the investigators nowhere.\n\nSix years later the great Dosey Asteroids robbery remained an unsolved\nmystery.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe two wrecked spaceships rested almost side by side near the tip of a\nnarrow, deep arm of a great lake.\n\nThe only man on the planet sat on a rocky ledge three miles uphill from\nthe two ships, gazing broodingly down at them. He was a big fellow in\nneatly patched shipboard clothing. His hands were clean, his face\ncarefully shaved. He had two of the castaway's traditional possessions\nwith him; a massive hunting bow rested against the rocks, and a minor\nrepresentative of the class of life which was this world's equivalent of\nbirds was hopping about near his feet. This was a thrush-sized creature\nwith a jaunty bearing and bright yellow eyes. From the front of its\nround face protruded a short, narrow tube tipped with small, sharp\nteeth. Round, horny knobs at the ends of its long toes protected\nretractile claws as it bounded back and forth between the bow and the\nman, giving a quick flutter of its wings on each bound. Finally it\nstopped before the man, stretching its neck to stare up at him, trying\nto catch his attention.\n\nHe roused from his musing, glanced irritably down at it.\n\n\"Not now, Birdie,\" he said. \"Keep quiet!\"\n\nThe man's gaze returned to the two ships, then passed briefly along a\ntowering range of volcanos on the other side of the lake, and lifted to\nthe cloudless blue sky. His eyes probed on, searching the sunlit, empty\nvault above him. If a ship ever came again, it would come from there,\nthe two wrecks by the lake arm already fixed in its detectors; it would\nnot come gliding along the surface of the planet....\n\nBirdie produced a sharp, plaintive whistle. The man looked at it.\n\n\"Shut up, stupid!\" he told it.\n\nHe reached into the inner pocket of his coat, took out a small object\nwrapped in a piece of leather, and unfolded the leather.\n\nThen it lay in his cupped palm, and blazed with the brilliance of twenty\ndiamonds, seeming to flash the fires of the spectrum furiously from\nevery faceted surface, without ever quite subduing the pure violet\nluminance which made a star hyacinth impossible to imitate or, once\nseen, to forget. The most beautiful of gems, the rarest, the most\nvaluable. The man who was a castaway stared at it for long seconds, his\nbreath quickening and his hand beginning to tremble. Finally he folded\nthe chip of incredible mineral back into the leather, replaced it\ncarefully in his pocket.\n\nWhen he looked about again, the sunlit air seemed brighter, the coloring\nof lake and land more vivid and alive. Once during each of this world's\nshort days, but no oftener, he permitted himself to look at the star\nhyacinth. It was a ritual adhered to with almost religious strictness,\nand it had kept him as sane as he was ever likely to be again, for over\nsix years.\n\nIt might, he sometimes thought, keep him sane until a third ship\npresently came along to this place. And then ...\n\nThe third ship was coming along at the moment, still some five hours'\nflight out from the system. She was a small ship with lean, rakish\nlines, a hot little speedster, gliding placidly through subspace just\nnow, her engines throttled down.\n\nAboard her, things were less peaceful.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe girl was putting up a pretty good fight but getting nowhere with it\nagainst the bull-necked Fleetman who had her pinned back against the\nwall.\n\nWellan Dasinger paused in momentary indecision at the entrance to the\nhalf-darkened control section of the speedboat. The scuffle in there\nvery probably was none of his business. The people of the roving\nIndependent Fleets had their own practices and mores and resented\ninterference from uninformed planet dwellers. For all Dasinger knew,\ntheir blue-eyed lady pilot enjoyed roughhousing with the burly members\nof her crew. If the thing wasn't serious....\n\nHe heard the man rap out something in the Willata Fleet tongue,\nfollowing the words up with a solid thump of his fist into the girl's\nside. The thump hadn't been playful, and her sharp gasp of pain\nindicated no enjoyment whatever. Dasinger stepped quickly into the\nroom.\n\nHe saw the girl turn startled eyes toward him as he came up behind the\nman. The man was Liu Taunus, the bigger of the two crew members ... too\nbig and too well muscled by a good deal, in fact, to make a\nsportsmanlike suggestion to divert his thumpings to Dasinger look like a\nsensible approach. Besides Dasinger didn't know the Willata Fleet's\nlanguage. The edge of his hand slashed twice from behind along the thick\nneck; then his fist brought the breath whistling from Taunus's lungs\nbefore the Fleetman had time to turn fully towards him.\n\nIt gave Dasinger a considerable starting advantage. During the next\ntwenty seconds or so the advantage seemed to diminish rapidly. Taunus's\nfists and boots had scored only near misses so far, but he began to look\nlike the hardest big man to chop down Dasinger had yet run into. And\nthen the Fleetman was suddenly sprawling on the floor, face down, arms\nflung out limply, a tough boy with a thoroughly bludgeoned nervous\nsystem.\n\nDasinger was straightening up when he heard the _thunk_ of the wrench.\nHe turned sharply, discovered first the girl standing ten feet away with\nthe wrench in her raised hand, next their second crew member lying on\nthe carpet between them, finally the long, thin knife lying near the\nman's hand.\n\n\"Thanks, Miss Mines!\" he said, somewhat out of breath. \"I really should\nhave remembered Calat might be somewhere around.\"\n\nDuomart Mines gestured with her head at the adjoining control cabin. \"He\nwas in there,\" she said, also breathlessly. She was a long-legged blonde\nwith a limber way of moving, pleasing to look at in her shaped Fleet\nuniform, though with somewhat aloof and calculating eyes. In the dim\nlight of the room she seemed to be studying Dasinger now with an\nexpression somewhere between wariness and surprised speculation. Then,\nas he took a step forward to check on Calat's condition, she backed off\nslightly, half lifting the wrench again.\n\nDasinger stopped and looked at her. \"Well,\" he said, \"make up your mind!\nWhose side are you on here?\"\n\nMiss Mines hesitated, let the wrench down. \"Yours, I guess,\" she\nacknowledged. \"I'd better be, now! They'd murder me for helping a\nplaneteer.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDasinger went down on one knee beside Calat, rather cautiously though\nthe Fleetman wasn't stirring, and picked up the knife. Miss Mines turned\nup the room's lights. Dasinger asked, \"What was this ... a mutiny?\nYou're technically in charge of the ship, aren't you?\"\n\n\"Technically,\" she agreed, added, \"We were arguing about a Fleet\nmatter.\"\n\n\"I see. We'll call it mutiny.\" Dasinger checked to be sure Calat wasn't\nfaking unconsciousness. He inquired, \"Do you really need these boys to\nhelp you?\"\n\nDuomart Mines shook her blond head. \"Not at all. Flying the Mooncat is a\none-man job.\"\n\n\"I did have a feeling,\" Dasinger admitted, \"that Willata's Fleet was\ndoing a little featherbedding when they said I'd have to hire a crew of\nthree to go along with their speedboat.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh.\" Her tone was non-committal. \"They were. What are you going to\ndo with them?\"\n\n\"Anywhere they can be locked up safely?\"\n\n\"Not safely. Their own cabin's as good as anything. They can batter\ntheir way out of here if they try hard enough. Of course we'd hear them\ndoing it.\"\n\n\"Well, we can fix that.\" Dasinger stood up, fished his cabin key out of\na pocket and gave it to her. \"Tan suitcase standing at the head of my\nbunk,\" he said. \"Mind bringing that and the little crane from the\nstoreroom up here?\"\n\nNeither of the Fleetmen had begun to stir when Duomart Mines came riding\na gravity crane back in through the door a couple of minutes later, the\nsuitcase dangling in front of her. She halted the crane in the center of\nthe room, slid out of its saddle with a supple twist of her body, and\nhanded Dasinger his cabin key.\n\n\"Thanks.\" Dasinger took the suitcase from the crane, unlocked and opened\nit. He brought out a pair of plastic handcuffs, aware that Miss Mines\nstood behind him making an intent scrutiny of what could be seen of the\nsuitcase's contents. He didn't blame her for feeling curious; she was\nlooking at a variety of devices which might have delighted the eyes of\nboth a professional burglar and military spy. She offered no comment.\n\nNeither did Dasinger. He hauled Liu Taunus over on his back, fastened\nhandcuffs about the Fleetman's wrists, then rolled him over on his face\nagain. He did the same for Calat, hung the suitcase back in the crane,\nslung a leg across the crane's saddle and settled into it.\n\nMiss Mines remarked, \"I'd look their cabin over pretty closely for guns\nand so on before leaving them there.\"\n\n\"I intend to. By the way, has Dr. Egavine mentioned how close we are to\nour destination?\" Dasinger maneuvered the crane over to Taunus, lowered\na beam to the small of the Fleetman's back and hoisted him up\ncarefully, arms, head and legs dangling.\n\nThe blond girl checked her watch. \"He didn't tell me exactly,\" she said,\n\"but there's what seems to be a terraprox in the G2 system ahead. If\nthat's it, we'll get there in around five hours depending on what\nsubspace conditions in the system are. Dr. Egavine's due up here in\nthirty minutes to give me the final figures.\" She paused, added\ncuriously, \"Don't you know yourself just where we're going?\"\n\n\"No,\" Dasinger said. \"I'm financing the trip. The doctor is the man with\nthe maps and other pertinent information.\"\n\n\"I thought you were partners.\"\n\n\"We are. Dr. Egavine is taciturn about some things. I'll bring him back\nhere with me as soon as I have these two locked away.\" Dasinger finished\npicking up Calat, swung the crane slowly towards the door, the\nunconscious Fleetmen suspended ahead of him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDr. Egavine stood at the open door to his stateroom as Dasinger came\nwalking back up the passage from the crew quarters and the storage.\nQuist, the doctor's manservant, peered out of the stateroom behind him.\n\n\"What in heaven's name were you doing with those two men?\" Egavine\ninquired, twitching his eyebrows disapprovingly up and down. The doctor\nwas a tall, thin man in his forties, dressed habitually in undertaker\nblack, with bony features and intense dark eyes. He added, \"They\nappeared to be unconscious ... and fettered!\"\n\n\"They were both,\" Dasinger admitted. \"I've confined them to their\ncabin.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"We had a little slugfest in the control section a few minutes ago. One\nof the boys was beating around on our pilot, so I laid him out, and she\nlaid out the other one when he tried to get into the act with a knife.\nShe says the original dispute was a Fleet matter ... in other words,\nnone of our business. However, I don't know. There's something decidedly\nfishy about the situation.\"\n\n\"In what way?\" Egavine asked.\n\nDasinger said, \"I checked over the crew quarters for weapons just now\nand found something which suggests that Willata's Fleet is much more\ninterested in what we're doing out here than we thought.\"\n\nEgavine looked startled, peered quickly along the passage to the control\nsection. \"I feel,\" he said, lowering his voice, \"that we should continue\nthis discussion behind closed doors....\"\n\n\"All right.\" Quist, a bandy-legged, wiry little man with a large bulb\nof a nose and close-set, small eyes, moved back from the door. Dasinger\nwent inside. Egavine pulled the door shut behind them and drew a chair\nout from the cabin table. Dasinger sat down opposite him.\n\n\"What did you find?\" Dr. Egavine asked.\n\nDasinger said, \"You know Miss Mines is supposed to be the only Fleet\nmember on board who speaks the Federation's translingue. However, there\nwas a listening device attached to the inside of the cabin communicator\nin the crew quarters. Its settings show that the Willata Fleet people\nhave bugged each of the Mooncat's other cabins, and also--which I think\nis an interesting point--the control section. Have you and Quist\ndiscussed our project in any detail since coming aboard?\"\n\n\"I believe we did, on several occasions,\" Egavine said hesitantly.\n\n\"Then we'd better assume Taunus and Calat knew that we're looking for\nthe wreck of the Dosey Asteroids raider, and ...\"\n\nEgavine put a cautioning finger to his lips. \"Should we...?\"\n\n\"Oh, no harm in talking now,\" Dasinger assured him. \"I pulled the\ninstrument out and dropped it in my cabin. Actually, the thing needn't\nbe too serious if we stay on guard. But of course we shouldn't go back\nto the Fleet station after we have the stuff. Gadgetry of that kind\nsuggests bad intentions ... also a rather sophisticated level of\ncriminality for an I-Fleet. We'll return directly to the Hub. We might\nhave to go on short rations for a few weeks, but we'll make it. And\nwe'll keep those two so-called crew members locked up.\"\n\nThe doctor cleared his throat. \"Miss Mines ...\"\n\n\"She doesn't appear to be personally involved in any piratical schemes,\"\nDasinger said. \"Otherwise they wouldn't have bugged her cabin and the\ncontrol rooms. If we dangle a few star hyacinths before her eyes, she\nshould be willing to fly us back. If she balks, I think I can handle the\nMooncat well enough to get us there.\"\n\nDr. Egavine tugged pensively at his ear lobe. \"I see.\" His hand moved on\ntoward his right coat lapel. \"What do you think of ...\"\n\n\"Mind watching this for a moment, doctor?\" Dasinger interrupted. He\nnodded at his own hand lying on the table before him.\n\n\"Watch...?\" Egavine began questioningly. Then his eyes went wide with\nalarm.\n\nDasinger's hand had turned suddenly sideways from the wrist, turned up\nagain. There was a small gun in the hand now, its stubby muzzle\npointing up steadily at Egavine's chest.\n\n\"Dasinger! What does ...\"\n\n\"Neat trick, eh?\" Dasinger commented. \"Sleeve gun. Now keep quiet and\nhold everything just as it is. If you move or Quist over there moves\nbefore I tell you to, you've had it, doctor!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe reached across the table with his left hand, slipped it beneath\nEgavine's right coat lapel, tugged sharply at something in there, and\nbrought out a flat black pouch with a tiny spray needle projecting from\nit. He dropped the pouch in his pocket, said, \"Keep your seat, doctor,\"\nstood up and went over to Quist. Quist darted an anxious glance at his\nemployer, and made a whimpering sound in his throat.\n\n\"You're not getting hurt,\" Dasinger told him. \"Just put your hands on\ntop of your head and stand still. Now let's take a look at the thing you\nstarted to pull from your pocket a moment ago ... Electric stunsap, eh?\nThat wasn't very nice of you, Quist! Let's see what else--\n\n\"Good Lord, Egavine,\" he announced presently, \"your boy's a regular\narmory! Two blasters, a pencil-beam, a knife, and the sap ... All right,\nQuist. Go over and sit down with the doctor.\" He watched the little man\nmove dejectedly to the table, then fitted the assorted lethal devices\ncarefully into one of his coat pockets, brought the pouch he had taken\nfrom Egavine out of the other pocket.\n\n\"Now, doctor,\" he said, \"let's talk. I'm unhappy about this. I\ndiscovered you were carrying this thing around before we left Mezmiali,\nand I had a sample of its contents analyzed. I was told it's a hypnotic\nwith an almost instantaneous effect both at skin contact and when\ninhaled. Care to comment?\"\n\n\"I do indeed!\" Egavine said frigidly. \"I have no intention of denying\nthat the instrument is a hypnotic spray. As you know, I dislike guns and\nsimilar weapons, and we are engaged in a matter in which the need to\ndefend myself against a personal attack might arise. Your assumption,\nhowever, that I intended to employ the spray on you just now is simply\nridiculous!\"\n\n\"I might be chuckling myself,\" Dasinger said, \"if Quist hadn't had the\nsap halfway out of his pocket as soon as you reached for your lapel. If\nI'd ducked from the spray, I'd have backed into the sap, right? There's\na little too much at stake here, doctor. You may be telling the truth,\nbut just in case you're nourishing unfriendly ideas--and that's what it\nlooks like to me--I'm taking a few precautions.\"\n\nDr. Egavine stared at him, his mouth set in a thin, bitter line. Then\nhe asked, \"What kind of precautions?\"\n\nDasinger said, \"I'll keep the hypnotic and Quist's bag of dirty tricks\nuntil we land. You might need those things on the planet but you don't\nneed them on shipboard. You and I'll go up to the control section now to\ngive Miss Mines her final flight directions. After that, you and Quist\nstay in this cabin with the door locked until the ship has set down. I\ndon't want to have anything else to worry about while we're making the\napproach. If my suspicions turn out to be unjustified, I'll apologize\n... after we're all safely back in the Hub.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"What was your partner looking so sour about?\" Duomart Mines inquired a\nlittle later, her eyes on the flight screens. \"Have a quarrel with him?\"\n\nDasinger, standing in the entry to the little control cabin across from\nher, shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Not exactly,\" he said. \"Egavine tried to use a hypno spray on me.\"\n\n\"Hypno spray?\" the young woman asked.\n\n\"A chemical which induces an instantaneous hypnotic trance in people.\nLeaves them wide open to suggestion. Medical hypnotists make a lot of\nuse of it. So do criminals.\"\n\nShe turned away from the control console to look at him. \"Why would your\npartner want to hypnotize you?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Dasinger said. \"He hasn't admitted that he intended to\ndo it.\"\n\n\"Is he a criminal?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't say he isn't,\" Dasinger observed judiciously, \"but I\ncouldn't prove it.\"\n\nDuomart puckered her lips, staring at him thoughtfully. \"What about\nyourself?\" she asked.\n\n\"No, Miss Mines, I have a very high regard for the law. I'm a simple\nbusinessman.\"\n\n\"A simple businessman who flies his own cruiser four weeks out from the\nHub into I-Fleet territory?\"\n\n\"That's the kind of business I'm in,\" Dasinger explained. \"I own a\ncharter ship company.\"\n\n\"I see,\" she said. \"Well, you two make an odd pair of partners....\"\n\n\"I suppose we do. Incidentally, has there been any occasion when you and\nDr. Egavine--or you and Dr. Egavine and his servant--were alone\nsomewhere in the ship together? For example, except when we came up here\nto give you further flight instructions, did he ever enter the control\nroom?\"\n\nShe shook her blond head. \"No. Those are the only times I've seen him.\"\n\n\"Certain of that?\" he asked.\n\nDuomart nodded without hesitation. \"Quite certain!\"\n\nDasinger took an ointment tube from his pocket, removed its cap,\nsqueezed a drop of black, oily substance out on a fingertip. \"Mind\nrolling up your sleeve a moment?\" he asked. \"Just above the elbow....\"\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"It's because of the way those hypno sprays work,\" Dasinger said. \"Give\nyour victim a dose of the stuff, tell him what to do, and it usually\ngets done. And if you're being illegal about it, one of the first things\nyou tell him to do is to forget he's ever been sprayed. This goop is\ndesigned for the specific purpose of knocking out hypnotic commands.\nJust roll up your sleeve like a good girl now, and I'll rub a little of\nit on your arm.\"\n\n\"You're not rubbing anything on my arm, mister!\" Duomart told him\ncoldly.\n\nDasinger shrugged resignedly, recapped the tube, and dropped it in his\npocket. \"Have it your way then,\" he remarked. \"I was only ...\"\n\nHe lunged suddenly towards her.\n\nDuomart gave him quite a struggle. A minute or two later, he had her\ndown on the floor, her body and one arm clamped between his knees, while\nhe unzipped the cuff on the sleeve of the other arm and pulled the\nsleeve up. He brought out the tube of antihypno ointment and rubbed a\nfew drops of the ointment into the hollow of Duomart's elbow, put the\ntube back in his pocket, then went on holding her down for nearly\nanother minute. She was gasping for breath, blue eyes furious, muscles\ntensed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSuddenly he felt her relax. An expression of stunned surprise appeared\non her face. \"Why,\" she began incredulously, \"he _did_ ...\"\n\n\"Gave you the spray treatment, eh?\" Dasinger said, satisfied. \"I was\npretty sure he had.\"\n\n\"Why, that-- At his beck and call, he says! Well, we'll just see about\n... let me up, Dasinger! Just wait till I get my hands on that bony\npartner of yours!\"\n\n\"Now take it easy.\"\n\n\"Take it easy! Why should I? I ...\"\n\n\"It would be better,\" Dasinger explained, \"if Egavine believes you're\nstill under the influence.\"\n\nShe scowled up at him; then her face turned thoughtful. \"Ho! You feel it\nisn't that he's a depraved old goat, that he's got something more\nsinister in mind?\"\n\n\"It's a definite possibility. Why not wait and find out? The ointment\nwill immunize you against further tricks.\"\n\nMiss Mines regarded him consideringly for a few seconds, then nodded.\n\"All right! You can let me up now. What do you think he's planning?\"\n\n\"Not easy to say with Dr. Egavine. He's a devious man.\" Dasinger got\nhimself disentangled, came to his feet, and reached down to help her\nscramble up.\n\n\"They certainly wrap you up with that hypno stuff, don't they!\" she\nobserved wonderingly.\n\nDasinger nodded. \"They certainly do!\" Then he added, \"I'm keeping the\ndoctor and his little sidekick locked up, too, until we get to the\nplanet. That leaves you and me with the run of the ship.\"\n\nDuomart looked at him. \"So it does,\" she agreed.\n\n\"Know how to use a gun?\"\n\n\"Of course. But I'm not allow-- I don't have one with me on this trip.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe reached into his coat, took out a small gun in a fabric holster.\nDuomart glanced at it, then her eyes went back to his face.\n\n\"Might clip it to your belt,\" Dasinger said. \"It's a good little\nshocker, fifty-foot range, safe for shipboard use. It's got a full load,\neighty shots. We may or may not run into emergencies. If we don't,\nyou'll still be more comfortable carrying it.\"\n\nDuomart holstered the gun and attached the holster to her belt. She\nslid the tip of her tongue reflectively out between her lips, drew it\nback, blinked at the flight screens for a few seconds, then looked\nacross at Dasinger and tapped the holster at her side.\n\n\"That sort of changes things, too!\" she said.\n\n\"Changes what?\"\n\n\"Tell you in a minute. Sit down, Dasinger. Manual course corrections\ncoming up....\" She slid into the pilot seat, moved her hands out over\nthe controls, and appeared to forget about him.\n\nDasinger settled into a chair to her left, lit a cigarette, smoked and\nwatched her, glancing occasionally at the screens. She was jockeying the\nMooncat deftly in and out of the fringes of a gravitic stress knot,\npresently brought it into the clear, slapped over a direction lever and\nslid the palm of her right hand along a row of speed control buttons\ndepressing them in turn.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Nice piece of piloting,\" Dasinger observed.\n\nDuomart lifted one shoulder in a slight shrug. \"That's my job.\" Her face\nremained serious. \"Are you wondering why I edged us through that thing\ninstead of going around it?\"\n\n\"Uh-huh, a little,\" Dasinger admitted.\n\n\"It knocked half an hour off the time it should take us to get to your\nplanet,\" she said. \"That is, if you'll still want to go there. We're\nbeing followed, you see.\"\n\n\"By whom?\"\n\n\"They call her the Spy. After the Mooncat she's the fastest job in the\nFleet. She's got guns, and her normal complement is twenty armed men.\"\n\n\"The idea being to have us lead them to what we're after, and then take\nit away from us?\" Dasinger asked.\n\n\"That's right. I'm not supposed to know about it. You know what a Gray\nFleet is?\"\n\nDasinger nodded. \"An Independent that's turned criminal.\"\n\n\"Yes. Willata's Fleet was a legitimate outfit up to four years ago. Then\nLiu Taunus and Calat and their gang took over. That happened to be the\ntwo Fleet bosses you slapped handcuffs on, Dasinger. We're a Gray Fleet\nnow. So I had some plans of my own for this trip. If I can get to some\nother I-Fleet or to the Hub, I might be able to do something about\nTaunus. After we were down on the planet, I was going to steal the\nMooncat and take off by myself.\"\n\n\"Why are you telling me?\"\n\nMiss Mines colored a little. \"Well, you gave me the gun,\" she said. \"And\nyou clobbered Taunus, and got me out of that hypno thing ... I mean, I'd\nhave to be pretty much of a jerk to ditch you now, wouldn't I? Anyway,\nnow that I've told you, you won't be going back to Willata's Fleet,\nwhatever you do. I'll still get to the Hub.\" She paused. \"So what do you\nwant to do now? Beat it until the coast's clear, or make a quick try for\nyour loot before the Spy gets there?\"\n\n\"How far is she behind us?\" Dasinger asked.\n\nDuomart said, \"I don't know exactly. Here's what happened. When we\nstarted out, Taunus told me not to let the Mooncat travel at more than\nthree-quarters speed for any reason. I figured then the Spy was involved\nin whatever he was planning; she can keep up with us at that rate, and\nshe has considerably better detector reach than the Cat. She's stayed\nfar enough back not to register on our plates throughout the trip.\n\n\"Late yesterday we hit some extensive turbulence areas, and I started\nplaying games. There was this little cluster of three sun systems ahead.\nOne of them was our target, though Dr. Egavine hadn't yet said which. I\nducked around a few twisters, doubled back, and there was the Spy coming\nthe other way. I beat it then--top velocity. The Spy dropped off our\ndetectors two hours later, and she can't have kept us on for more than\nanother hour herself.\n\n\"So they'll assume we're headed for one of those three systems, but\nthey don't know which one. They'll have to look for us. There's only one\nterraprox in the system we're going to. There may be none in the others,\nor maybe four or five. But the terraprox worlds is where they'll look\nbecause the salvage suits you're carrying are designed for ordinary\nunderwater work. After the way I ran from them, they'll figure\nsomething's gone wrong with Taunus's plans, of course.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDasinger rubbed his chin. \"And if they're lucky and follow us straight\nin to the planet?\"\n\n\"Then,\" Miss Mines said, \"you might still have up to six or seven hours\nto locate the stuff you want, load it aboard and be gone again.\"\n\n\"Might have?\"\n\nShe shrugged. \"We've got a lead on them, but just how big a lead we\nfinally wind up with depends to a considerable extent on the flight\nconditions they run into behind us. They might get a break there, too.\nThen there's another very unfortunate thing. The system Dr. Egavine's\ndirected us to now is the one we were closest to when I broke out of\ndetection range. They'll probably decide to look there first. You see?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Dasinger said. \"Not so good, is it?\" He knuckled his jaw again\nreflectively. \"Why was Taunus pounding around on you when I came\nforward?\"\n\n\"Oh, those two runches caught me flying the ship at top speed. Taunus\nwas furious. He couldn't know whether the Spy still had a fix on us or\nnot. Of course he didn't tell me that. The lumps he was preparing to\nhand out were to be for disregarding his instructions. He does things\nlike that.\" She paused. \"Well, are you going to make a try for the\nplanet?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Dasinger said. \"If we wait, there's entirely too good a chance\nthe Spy will run across what we're after while she's snooping around for\nus there. We'll try to arrange things for a quick getaway in case our\nluck doesn't hold up.\"\n\nDuomart nodded. \"Mind telling me what you're after?\"\n\n\"Not at all. Under the circumstances you should be told....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Of course,\" Dasinger concluded a minute or two later, \"all we'll have a\nlegal claim to is the salvage fee.\"\n\nMiss Mines glanced over at him, looking somewhat shaken. \"You _are_\nplaying this legally?\"\n\n\"Definitely.\"\n\n\"Even so,\" she said, \"if that really is the wreck of the Dosey Asteroids\nraider, and the stones are still on board ... you two will collect\nsomething like ten million credits between you!\"\n\n\"Roughly that,\" Dasinger agreed. \"Dr. Egavine learned about the matter\nfrom one of your Willata Fleetmen.\"\n\nHer eyes widened. \"He what!\"\n\n\"The Fleet lost a unit called Handing's Scout about four years ago,\ndidn't it?\"\n\n\"Three and a half,\" she said. She paused. \"Handing's Scout is the other\nwreck down there?\"\n\n\"Yes. There was one survivor ... as far as we know. You may recall his\nname. Leed Farous.\"\n\nDuomart nodded. \"The little kwil hound. He was assistant navigator. How\ndid Dr. Egavine...?\"\n\nDasinger said, \"Farous died in a Federation hospital on Mezmiali two\nyears ago, apparently of the accumulative effects of kwil addiction.\nHe'd been picked up in Hub space in a lifeboat which we now know was one\nof the two on Handing's Scout.\"\n\n\"In Hub space? Why, it must have taken him almost a year to get that far\nin one of those tubs!\"\n\n\"From what Dr. Egavine learned,\" Dasinger said, \"it did take that long.\nThe lifeboat couldn't be identified at the time. Neither could Farous.\nHe was completely addled with kwil ... quite incoherent, in fact already\napparently in the terminal stages of the addiction. Strenuous efforts\nwere made to identify him because a single large star hyacinth had been\nfound in the lifeboat ... there was the possibility it was one of the\nstones the Dosey Asteroids Company had lost. But Farous died some months\nlater without regaining his senses sufficiently to offer any\ninformation.\n\n\"Dr. Egavine was the physician in charge of the case, and eventually\nalso the man who signed the death certificate. The doctor stayed on at\nthe hospital for another year, then resigned, announcing that he\nintended to go into private research. Before Farous died, Egavine had of\ncourse obtained his story from him.\"\n\nMiss Mines looked puzzled. \"If Farous never regained his senses ...\"\n\n\"Dr. Egavine is a hypnotherapist of exceptional ability,\" Dasinger said.\n\"Leed Farous wasn't so far gone that the information couldn't be pried\nout of him with an understanding use of drug hypnosis.\"\n\n\"Then why didn't others ...\"\n\n\"Oh, it was attempted. But you'll remember,\" Dasinger said, \"that I had\na little trouble getting close to you with an antihypnotic. The good\ndoctor got to Farous first, that's all. Instead of the few minutes he\nspent on you, he could put in hour after hour conditioning Farous. Later\ncomers simply didn't stand a chance of getting through to him.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDuomart Mines was silent a moment, then asked, \"Why did you two come out\nto the Willata Fleet station and hire one of our ships? Your cruiser's a\nlot slower than the Mooncat but it would have got you here.\"\n\nDasinger said, \"Dr. Egavine slipped up on one point. One can hardly\nblame him for it since interstellar navigation isn't in his line. The\nreference points on the maps he had Farous make up for him turned out to\nbe meaningless when compared with Federation star charts. We needed the\nopportunity to check them against your Fleet maps. They make sense\nthen.\"\n\n\"I see.\" Duomart gave him a sideways glance, remarked, \"You know, the\nway you've put it, the thing's still pretty fishy.\"\n\n\"In what manner?\"\n\n\"Dr. Egavine finished off old Farous, didn't he?\"\n\n\"He may have,\" Dasinger conceded. \"It would be impossible to prove it\nnow. You can't force a man to testify against himself. It's true, of\ncourse, that Farous died at a very convenient moment, from Dr. Egavine's\npoint of view.\"\n\n\"Well,\" she said, \"a man like that wouldn't be satisfied with half a\nsalvage fee when he saw the chance to quietly make away with the entire\nDosey Asteroids haul.\"\n\n\"That could be,\" Dasinger said thoughtfully. \"On the other hand, a man\nwho had committed an unprovable murder to obtain a legal claim to six\nmillion credits might very well decide not to push his luck any farther.\nYou know the space salvage ruling that when a criminal act or criminal\nintent can be shown in connection with an operation like this, the\nguilty person automatically forfeits any claim he has to the fee.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know ... and of course,\" Miss Mines said, \"you aren't\nnecessarily so lily white either. That's another possibility. And\nthere's still another one. You don't happen to be a Federation\ndetective, do you?\"\n\nDasinger blinked. After a moment he said, \"Not a bad guess. However, I\ndon't work for the Federation.\"\n\n\"Oh? For whom do you work?\"\n\n\"At the moment, and indirectly, for the Dosey Asteroids Company.\"\n\n\"Insurance?\"\n\n\"No. After Farous died, Dosey Asteroids employed a detective agency to\ninvestigate the matter. I represent the agency.\"\n\n\"The agency collects on the salvage?\"\n\n\"That's the agreement. We deliver the goods or get nothing.\"\n\n\"And Dr. Egavine?\"\n\nDasinger shrugged. \"If the doctor keeps his nose clean, he stays\nentitled to half the salvage fee.\"\n\n\"What about the way he got the information from Farous?\" she asked.\n\n\"From any professional viewpoint, that was highly unethical procedure.\nBut there's no evidence Egavine broke any laws.\"\n\nMiss Mines studied him, her eyes bright and quizzical. \"I had a feeling\nabout you,\" she said. \"I ...\"\n\nA warning burr came from the tolerance indicator; the girl turned her\nhead quickly, said, \"Cat's complaining ... looks like we're hitting the\nfirst system stresses!\" She slid back into the pilot seat. \"Be with you\nagain in a while....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen Dasinger returned presently to the control section Duomart sat at\nease in the pilot seat with coffee and a sandwich before her.\n\n\"How are the mutineers doing?\" she asked.\n\n\"They ate with a good appetite, said nothing, and gave me no trouble,\"\nDasinger said. \"They still pretend they don't understand Federation\ntranslingue. Dr. Egavine's a bit sulky. He wanted to be up front during\nthe prelanding period. I told him he could watch things through his\ncabin communicator screen.\"\n\nMiss Mines finished her sandwich, her eyes thoughtful. \"I've been\nwondering, you know ... how can you be sure Dr. Egavine told you the\ntruth about what he got from Leed Farous?\"\n\nDasinger said, \"I studied the recordings Dr. Egavine made of his\nsessions with Farous in the hospital. He may have held back on a few\ndetails, but the recordings were genuine enough.\"\n\n\"So Farous passes out on a kwil jag,\" she said, \"and he doesn't even\nknow they're making a landing. When he comes to, the scout's parked, the\nNumber Three drive is smashed, the lock is open, and not another soul is\naboard or in sight.\n\n\"Then he notices another wreck with its lock open, wanders over, sees a\nfew bones and stuff lying around inside, picks up a star hyacinth, and\nlearns from the ship's records that down in the hold under sixty feet of\nwater is a sealed compartment with a whole little crateful of the\nstones....\"\n\n\"That's the story,\" Dasinger agreed.\n\n\"In the Fleets,\" she remarked, \"if we heard of a place where a couple of\nship's crews seemed to have vanished into thin air, we'd call it a\nspooked world. And usually we'd keep away from it.\" She clamped her\nlower lip lightly between her teeth for a moment. \"Do you think Dr.\nEgavine has considered the kwil angle?\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nDasinger nodded. \"I'm sure of it. Of course it's only a guess that the\nkwil made a difference for Farous. The stuff has no known medical value\nof any kind. But when the only known survivor of two crews happens to be\na kwil-eater, the point has to be considered.\"\n\n\"Nobody else on Handing's Scout took kwil,\" Duomart said. \"I know that.\nThere aren't many in the Fleet who do.\" She hesitated. \"You know,\nDasinger, perhaps I should try it again! Maybe if I took it straight\nfrom the needle this time ...\"\n\nDasinger shook his head. \"If the little flake you nibbled made you feel\ndrowsy, even a quarter of a standard shot would put you out cold for an\nhour or two. Kwil has that effect on a lot of people. Which is one\nreason it isn't a very popular drug.\"\n\n\"What effect does it have on you?\" she asked.\n\n\"Depends to some extent on the size of the dose. Sometimes it slows me\ndown physically and mentally. At other times there were no effects that\nI could tell until the kwil wore off. Then I'd have hallucinations for a\nwhile--that can be very distracting, of course, when there's something\nyou have to do. Those hangover hallucinations seem to be another fairly\ncommon reaction.\"\n\nHe concluded, \"Since you can't take the drug and stay awake, you'll\nsimply remain inside the locked ship. It will be better anyway to keep\nthe Mooncat well up in the air and ready to move most of the time we're\non the planet.\"\n\n\"What about Taunus and Calat?\" she asked.\n\n\"They come out with us, of course. If kwil is what it takes to stay\nhealthy down there, I've enough to go around. And if it knocks them out,\nit will keep them out of trouble.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Looks like there's a firemaker down there!\" Duomart's slim forefinger\nindicated a point on the ground-view plate. \"Column of smoke starting to\ncome up next to that big patch of trees!... Two point nine miles due\nnorth and uphill of the wrecks.\"\n\nFrom a wall screen Dr. Egavine's voice repeated sharply, \"Smoke? Then\nLeed Farous was not the only survivor!\"\n\nDuomart gave him a cool glance. \"Might be a native animal that knows how\nto make fire. They're not so unusual.\" She went on to Dasinger. \"It\nwould take a hand detector to spot us where we are, but it does look\nlike a distress signal. If it's men from one of the wrecks, why haven't\nthey used the scout's other lifeboat?\"\n\n\"Would the lifeboat still be intact?\" Dasinger asked.\n\nDuomart spun the ground-view plate back to the scout. \"Look for\nyourself,\" she said. \"It _couldn't_ have been damaged in as light a\ncrash as that one was. Those tubs are built to stand a really solid\nshaking up! And what else could have harmed it?\"\n\n\"Farous may have put it out of commission before he left,\" Dasinger\nsaid. \"He wanted to come back from the Hub with an expedition to get the\nhyacinths, so he wouldn't have cared for the idea of anyone else getting\naway from the planet meanwhile.\" He looked over at the screen. \"How\nabout it, doctor? Did Farous make any mention of that?\"\n\nDr. Egavine seemed to hesitate an instant. \"As a matter of fact, he did.\nFarous was approximately a third of the way to the Hub when he realized\nhe might have made a mistake in not rendering the second lifeboat\nunusable. But by then it was too late to turn back, and of course he was\nalmost certain there were no other survivors.\"\n\n\"So that lifeboat should still be in good condition?\"\n\n\"It was in good condition when Farous left here.\"\n\n\"Well, whoever's down there simply may not know how to handle it.\"\n\nDuomart shook her blond head decidedly. \"That's out, too!\" she said.\n\"Our Fleet lifeboats all came off an old Grand Commerce liner which was\nup for scrap eighty, ninety years ago. They're designed so any fool can\ntell what to do, and the navigational settings are completely automatic.\nOf course if it _is_ a native firemaker--with mighty keen eyesight--down\nthere, that could be different! A creature like that mightn't think of\ngoing near the scout. Should I start easing the Cat in towards the\nsmoke, Dasinger?\"\n\n\"Yes. We'll have to find out what the signal means before we try to\napproach the wrecks. Doctor, are you satisfied now that Miss Mines's\noutworld biotic check was correct?\"\n\n\"The analysis appears to be fairly accurate,\" Dr. Egavine acknowledged,\n\"and all detectable trouble sources are covered by the selected Fleet\nserum.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDasinger said, \"We'll prepare for an immediate landing then. There'll be\nless than an hour of daylight left on the ground, but the night's so\nshort we'll disregard that factor.\" He switched off the connection to\nEgavine's cabin, turned to Duomart. \"Now our wrist communicators, you\nsay, have a five-mile range?\"\n\n\"A little over five.\"\n\n\"Then,\" Dasinger said, \"we'll keep you and the Cat stationed at an exact\nfive-mile altitude ninety-five per cent of the time we spend on the\nplanet. If the Spy arrives while you're up there, how much time will we\nhave to clear out?\"\n\nShe shrugged. \"That depends of course on how they arrive. My detectors\ncan pick the Spy up in space before their detectors can make out the Cat\nagainst the planet. If we spot them as they're heading in, we'll have\naround fifteen minutes.\n\n\"But if they show up on the horizon in atmosphere, or surface her out of\nsubspace, that's something else. If I don't move instantly then, they'll\nhave me bracketed ... and BLOOIE!\"\n\nDasinger said, \"Then those are the possibilities you'll have to watch\nfor. Think you could draw the Spy far enough away in a chase to be able\nto come back for us?\"\n\n\"They wouldn't follow me that far,\" Duomart said. \"They know the Cat can\noutrun them easily once she's really stretched out, so if they can't\nnail her in the first few minutes they'll come back to look around for\nwhat we were interested in here.\" She added, \"And if I _don't_ let the\nCat go all out but just keep a little ahead of them, they'll know that\nI'm trying to draw them away from something.\"\n\nDasinger nodded. \"In that case we'll each be on our own, and your job\nwill be to keep right on going and get the information as quickly as\npossible to the Kyth detective agency in Orado. The agency will take the\nmatter from there.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMiss Mines looked at him. \"Aren't you sort of likely to be dead before\nthe agency can do anything about the situation?\"\n\n\"I'll try to avoid it,\" Dasinger said. \"Now, we've assumed the worst as\nfar as the Spy is concerned. But things might also go wrong downstairs.\nSay I lose control of the group, or we all get hit down there by\nwhatever hit the previous landing parties and it turns out that kwil's\nno good for it. It's understood that in any such event you again head\nthe Cat immediately for the Hub and get the word to the agency. Right?\"\n\nDuomart nodded.\n\nHe brought a flat case of medical hypodermics out of his pocket, and\nopened it.\n\n\"Going to take your shot of kwil before we land?\" Miss Mines asked.\n\n\"No. I want you to keep one of these needles on hand, at least until we\nfind out what the problem is. It'll knock you out if you have to take\nit, but it might also keep you alive. I'm waiting myself to see if it's\nnecessary to go on kwil. The hallucinations I get from the stuff\nafterwards could hit me while we're in the middle of some critical\nactivity or other, and that mightn't be so good.\" He closed the case\nagain, put it away. \"I think we've covered everything. If you'll check\nthe view plate, something--or somebody--has come out from under the\ntrees near the column of smoke. And unless I'm mistaken it's a human\nbeing.\"\n\nDuomart slipped the kwil needle he'd given her into a drawer of the\ninstrument console. \"I don't think you're mistaken,\" she said. \"I've\nbeen watching him for the last thirty seconds.\"\n\n\"It is a man?\"\n\n\"Pretty sure of it. He moves like one.\"\n\nDasinger stood up. \"I'll go talk with Egavine then. I had a job in mind\nfor him and his hypno sprays if we happened to run into human\nsurvivors.\"\n\n\"Shall I put the ship down next to this one?\"\n\n\"No. Land around five hundred yards to the north, in the middle of that\nbig stretch of open ground. That should keep us out of ambushes. Better\nkeep clear of the airspace immediately around the wrecks as you go\ndown.\"\n\nDuomart looked at him. \"Darn right I'll keep clear of that area!\"\n\nDasinger grinned. \"Something about the scout?\"\n\n\"Sure. No visible reason at all why the scout should have settled hard\nenough to buckle a drive. Handing was a good pilot.\"\n\n\"Hm-m-m.\" Dasinger rubbed his chin. \"Well, I've been wondering. The\nDosey Asteroids raiders are supposed to have used an unknown type of\nantipersonnel weapon in their attack on the station, you know. Nothing\nin sight on their wreck that might be, say, an automatic gun but ...\nwell, just move in carefully and stay ready to haul away very fast at\nthe first hint of trouble!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Mooncat slid slowly down through the air near the point where the\nman stood in open ground, a hundred yards from the clump of trees out of\nwhich smoke still billowed thickly upwards. The man watched the\nspeedboat's descent quietly, making no further attempt to attract the\nattention of those on board to himself.\n\nDuomart had said that the man was not a member of Handing's lost crew\nbut a stranger. He was therefore one of the Dosey Asteroids raiders.\n\nPutting down her two land legs, the Mooncat touched the open hillside a\nlittle over a quarter of a mile from the woods, stood straddled and\nrakish, nose high. The storeroom lock opened, and a slender ramp slid\nout. Quist showed in the lock, dumped two portable shelters to the\nground, came scrambling nimbly down the ramp. Dr. Egavine followed, more\ncautiously, the two handcuffed Fleetmen behind him. Dasinger came out\nlast, glancing over at the castaway who had started across the slope\ntowards the ship.\n\n\"Everyone's out,\" he told his wrist communicator. \"Take her up.\"\n\nThe ramp snaked soundlessly back into the lock, the lock snapped shut\nand the Mooncat lifted smoothly and quickly from the ground. Liu Taunus\nglanced after the rising speedboat, looked at Calat, and spoke loudly\nand emphatically in Fleetlingue for a few seconds, his broad face\nwithout expression. Dasinger said, \"All right, Quist, break out the\nshelter.\"\n\nWhen the shelter was assembled, Dasinger motioned the Fleetmen towards\nthe door with his thumb. \"Inside, boys!\" he said. \"Quist, lock the\nshelter behind them and stay on guard here. Come on, doctor. We'll meet\nour friend halfway....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe castaway approached unhurriedly, walking with a long, easy stride,\nthe bird thing on his shoulder craning its neck to peer at the strangers\nwith round yellow eyes. The man was big and rangy, probably less heavy\nby thirty pounds than Liu Taunus, but in perfect physical condition. The\nface was strong and intelligent, smiling elatedly now.\n\n\"I'd nearly stopped hoping this day would arrive!\" he said in\ntranslingue. \"May I ask who you are?\"\n\n\"An exploration group.\" Dasinger gripped the extended hand, shook it, as\nDr. Egavine's right hand went casually to his coat lapel. \"We noticed\nthe two wrecked ships down by the lake,\" Dasinger explained, \"then saw\nyour smoke signal. Your name?\"\n\n\"Graylock. Once chief engineer of the Antares, out of Vanadia on\nAruaque.\" Graylock turned, still smiling, towards Egavine.\n\nEgavine smiled as pleasantly.\n\n\"Graylock,\" he observed, \"you feel, and will continue to feel, that this\nis the conversation you planned to conduct with us, that everything is\ngoing exactly in accordance with your wishes.\" He turned his head to\nDasinger, inquired, \"Would you prefer to question him yourself,\nDasinger?\"\n\nDasinger hesitated, startled; but Graylock's expression did not change.\nDasinger shook his head. \"Very smooth, doctor!\" he commented. \"No, go\nahead. You're obviously the expert here.\"\n\n\"Very well ... Graylock,\" Dr. Egavine resumed, \"you will cooperate with\nme fully and to the best of your ability now, knowing that I am both\nyour master and friend. Are any of the other men who came here on those\ntwo ships down by the water still alive?\"\n\nThere was complete stillness for a second or two. Then Graylock's face\nbegan to work unpleasantly, all color draining from it. He said harshly,\n\"No. But I ... I don't ...\" He stammered incomprehensibly, went silent\nagain, his expression wooden and set.\n\n\"Graylock,\" Egavine continued to probe, \"you can remember everything\nnow, and you are not afraid. Tell me what happened to the other men.\"\n\nSweat covered the castaway's ashen face. His mouth twisted in agonized,\nsilent grimaces again. The bird thing leaped from his shoulder with a\nsmall purring sound, fluttered softly away.\n\nDr. Egavine repeated, \"You are not afraid. You can remember. What\nhappened to them? How did they die?\"\n\nAnd abruptly the big man's face smoothed out. He looked from Egavine to\nDasinger and back with an air of brief puzzlement, then explained\nconversationally, \"Why, Hovig's generator killed many of us as we ran\naway from the Antares. Some reached the edges of the circle with me, and\nI killed them later.\"\n\nDr. Egavine flicked another glance towards Dasinger but did not pause.\n\n\"And the crew of the second ship?\" he asked.\n\n\"Those two. They had things I needed, and naturally I didn't want them\nalive here.\"\n\n\"Is Hovig's generator still on the Antares?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"How does the generator kill?\"\n\nSweat suddenly started out on Graylock's face again, but now he seemed\nunaware of any accompanying emotions. He said, \"It kills by fear, of\ncourse....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe story of the Dosey Asteroids raider and of Hovig's fear generators\nunfolded quickly from there. Hovig had developed his machines for the\nsingle purpose of robbing the Dosey Asteroids Shipping Station. The plan\nthen had been to have the Antares cruise in uncharted space with the\nlooted star hyacinths for at least two years, finally to approach the\narea of the Federation from a sector far removed from the Dosey system.\nThat precaution resulted in disaster for Hovig. Chief Engineer Graylock\nhad time to consider that his share in the profits of the raid would be\nrelatively insignificant, and that there was a possibility of increasing\nit.\n\nGraylock and his friends attacked their shipmates as the raider was\ntouching down to the surface of an uncharted world to replenish its\nwater supply. The attack succeeded but Hovig, fatally wounded, took a\nterrible revenge on the mutineers. He contrived to set off one of his\ngrisly devices, and to all intents and purposes everyone still alive on\nboard the Antares immediately went insane with fear. The ship crashed\nout of control at the edge of a lake. Somebody had opened a lock and a\nnumber of the frantic crew plunged from the ramp and fell to their death\non the rocks below. Those who reached the foot of the ramp fled\nfrenziedly from the wreck, the effects of Hovig's machine pursuing them\nbut weakening gradually as they widened the distance between themselves\nand the Antares. Finally, almost three miles away, the fear impulses\nfaded out completely....\n\nBut thereafter the wreck was unapproachable. The fear generator did not\nrun out of power, might not run out of power for years.\n\nDasinger said, \"Doctor, let's hurry this up! Ask him why they weren't\naffected by their murder machines when they robbed Dosey Asteroids. Do\nthe generators have a beam-operated shut-off, or what?\"\n\nGraylock listened to the question, said, \"We had taken kwil. The effects\nwere still very unpleasant, but they could be tolerated.\"\n\nThere was a pause of a few seconds. Dr. Egavine cleared his throat. \"It\nappears, Dasinger,\" he remarked, \"that we have failed to consider a\nvery important clue!\"\n\nDasinger nodded. \"And an obvious one,\" he said drily. \"Keep it moving\nalong, doctor. How much kwil did they take? How long had they been\ntaking it before the raid?\"\n\nDr. Egavine glanced over at him, repeated the questions.\n\nGraylock said Hovig had begun conditioning the crew to kwil a week or\ntwo before the Antares slipped out of Aruaque for the strike on the\nstation. In each case the dosage had been built up gradually to the\nquantity the man in question required to remain immune to the\ngenerators. Individual variations had been wide and unpredictable.\n\nDasinger passed his tongue over his lips, nodded. \"Ask him ...\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe checked himself at a soft, purring noise, a shadowy fluttering in the\nair. Graylock's animal flew past him, settled on its master's shoulder,\nturned to stare at Dasinger and Egavine. Dasinger looked at the yellow\nowl-eyes, the odd little tube of a mouth, continued to Egavine, \"Ask him\nwhere the haul was stored in the ship.\"\n\nGraylock confirmed Leed Farous's statement of what he had seen in the\nAntares's records. All but a few of the star hyacinths had been placed\nin a vault-like compartment in the storage, and the compartment was\nsealed. Explosives would be required to open it. Hovig kept out half a\ndozen of the larger stones, perhaps as an antidote to boredom during the\nlong voyage ahead. Graylock had found one of them just before Hovig's\ninfernal instrument went into action.\n\n\"And where is that one now?\" Dr. Egavine asked.\n\n\"I still have it.\"\n\n\"On your person?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nDr. Egavine held out his hand, palm upward. \"You no longer want it,\nGraylock. Give it to me.\"\n\nGraylock looked bewildered; for a moment he appeared about to weep. Then\nhe brought a knotted piece of leather from his pocket, unwrapped it,\ntook out the gem and placed it in Egavine's hand. Egavine picked it up\nbetween thumb and forefinger of his other hand, held it out before him.\n\nThere was silence for some seconds while the star hyacinth burned in the\nevening air and the three men and the small winged animal stared at it.\nThen Dr. Egavine exhaled slowly.\n\n\"Ah, now!\" he said, his voice a trifle unsteady. \"Men might kill and\nkill for that one beauty alone, that is true!... Will you keep it for\nnow, Dasinger? Or shall I?\"\n\nDasinger looked at him thoughtfully.\n\n\"You keep it, doctor,\" he said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Dasinger,\" Dr. Egavine observed a few minutes later, \"I have been\nthinking....\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Graylock's attempted description of his experience indicates that the\nmachine on the Antares does not actually broadcast the emotion of\nterror, as he believes. The picture presented is that of a mind in which\nboth the natural and the acquired barriers of compartmentalization are\ntemporarily nullified, resulting in an explosion of compounded insanity\nto an extent which would be inconceivable without such an outside agent.\nAs we saw in Graylock, the condition is in fact impossible to describe\nor imagine! A diabolical device....\"\n\nHe frowned. \"Why the drug kwil counteracts such an effect remains\nunclear. But since we now know that it does, I may have a solution to\nthe problem confronting us.\"\n\nDasinger nodded. \"Let's hear it.\"\n\n\"Have Miss Mines bring the ship down immediately,\" Egavine instructed\nhim. \"There is a definite probability that among my medical supplies\nwill be an effective substitute for kwil, for this particular purpose. A\nfew hours of experimentation, and ...\"\n\n\"Doctor,\" Dasinger interrupted, \"hold it right there! So far there's\nbeen no real harm in sparring around. But we're in a different situation\nnow ... we may be running out of time very quickly. Let's quit playing\ngames.\"\n\nDr. Egavine glanced sharply across at him. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean that we both have kwil, of course. There's no reason to\nexperiment. But the fact that we have it is no guarantee that we'll be\nable to get near that generator. Leed Farous's tissues were soaked with\nthe drug. Graylock's outfit had weeks to determine how much each of them\nneeded to be able to operate within range of the machines and stay sane.\nWe're likely to have trouble enough without trying to jockey each\nother.\"\n\nDr. Egavine cleared his throat. \"But I ...\"\n\nDasinger interrupted again. \"Your reluctance to tell me everything you\nknew or had guessed is understandable. You had no more reason to trust\nme completely than I had to trust you. So before you say anything else\nI'd like you to look at these credentials. You're familiar with the\nFederation seal, I think.\"\n\nDr. Egavine took the proffered identification case, glanced at Dasinger\nagain, then opened the case.\n\n\"So,\" he said presently. \"You're a detective working for the Dosey\nAsteroids Company....\" His voice was even. \"That alters the situation,\nof course. Why didn't you tell me this?\"\n\n\"That should be obvious,\" Dasinger said. \"If you're an honest man, the\nfact can make no difference. The company remains legally bound to pay\nout the salvage fee for the star hyacinths. They have no objection to\nthat. What they didn't like was the possibility of having the gems\nstolen for the second time. If that's what you had in mind, you\nwouldn't, of course, have led an agent of the company here. In other\nwords, doctor, in cooperating with me you're running no risk of being\ncheated out of your half of the salvage rights.\"\n\nDasinger patted the gun in his coat pocket. \"And of course,\" he added,\n\"if I happened to be a bandit in spite of the credentials, I'd be\neliminating you from the partnership right now instead of talking to\nyou! The fact that I'm not doing it should be a sufficient guarantee\nthat I don't intend to do it.\"\n\nDr. Egavine nodded. \"I'm aware of the point.\"\n\n\"Then let's get on with the salvage,\" Dasinger said. \"For your further\ninformation, there's an armed Fleet ship hunting for us with piratical\nintentions, and the probability is that it will find us in a matter of\nhours....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe described the situation briefly, concluded, \"You've carried out your\npart of the contract by directing us here. You can, if you wish,\nminimize further personal risks by using the Fleet scout's lifeboat to\nget yourself and Quist off the planet, providing kwil will get you to\nthe scout. Set a normspace course for Orado then, and we'll pick you up\nafter we've finished the job.\"\n\nDr. Egavine shook his head. \"Thank you, but I'm staying. It's in my\ninterest to give you what assistance I can ... and, as you've surmised,\nI do have a supply of kwil. What is your plan?\"\n\n\"Getting Hovig's generator shut off is the first step,\" Dasinger said.\n\"And since we don't know what dosage of the drug is required for each of\nus, we'd be asking for trouble by approaching the Antares in the ship.\nMiss Mines happens to be a kwil-sensitive, in any case. So it's going to\ntake hiking, and I'll start down immediately now. Would Graylock and the\nFleetmen obey hypnotic orders to the extent of helping out dependably in\nthe salvage work?\"\n\nEgavine nodded. \"There is no question of that.\"\n\n\"Then you might start conditioning them to the idea now. From the outer\nappearance of the Antares, it may be a real job to cut through inside\nher to get to the star hyacinths. We have the three salvage suits. If I\ncan make it to the generator, shut it off, and it turns out then that I\nneed some hypnotized brawn down there, Miss Mines will fly over the\nshelter as a signal to start marching the men down.\"\n\n\"Why march? At that point, Miss Mines could take us to the wreck within\nseconds.\"\n\nDasinger shook his head. \"Sorry, doctor. Nobody but Miss Mines or myself\ngoes aboard the Mooncat until we either wind up the job or are forced to\nclear out and run. I'm afraid that's one precaution I'll have to take.\nWhen you get to the Antares we'll give each of the boys a full shot of\nkwil. The ones that don't go limp on it can start helping.\"\n\nDr. Egavine said reflectively, \"You feel the drug would still be a\nrequirement?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Dasinger said, \"Hovig appears to have been a man who took\nprecautions, too. We know he had three generators and that he set off\none of them. The question is where the other two are. It wouldn't be so\nvery surprising, would it, if one or both of them turned out to be\nwaiting for intruders in the vault where he sealed away the loot?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe night was cool. Wind rustled in the ground vegetation and the\noccasional patches of trees. Otherwise the slopes were quiet. The sky\nwas covered with cloud layers through which the Mooncat drifted\ninvisibly. In the infrared glasses Dasinger had slipped on when he\nstarted, the rocky hillside showed clear for two hundred yards, tinted\ngreen as though bathed by a strange moonlight; beyond was murky\ndarkness.\n\n\"Still all right?\" Duomart's voice inquired from the wrist communicator.\n\n\"Uh-huh!\" Dasinger said. \"A little nervous, but I'd be feeling that way\nin any case, under the circumstances.\"\n\n\"I'm not so sure,\" she said. \"You've gone past the two and a half mile\nline from the generator. From what that Graylock monster said, you\nshould have started to pick up its effects. Why not take your shot, and\nplay safe?\"\n\n\"No,\" Dasinger said. \"If I wait until I feel something that can be\ndefinitely attributed to the machine, I can keep the kwil dose down to\nwhat I need. I don't want to load myself up with the drug any more than\nI have to.\"\n\nA stand of tall trees with furry trunks moved presently into range of\nthe glasses, thick undergrowth beneath. Dasinger picked his way through\nthe thickets with some caution. The indications so far had been that\nlocal animals had as much good reason to avoid the vicinity of Hovig's\nmachine as human beings, but if there was any poisonous vermin in the\narea this would be a good place for it to be lurking. Which seemed a\nfairly reasonable apprehension. Other, equally definite, apprehensions\nlooked less reasonable when considered objectively. If he stumbled on a\nstone, it produced a surge of sharp alarm which lingered for seconds;\nand his breathing had quickened much more than could be accounted for by\nthe exertions of the downhill climb.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFive minutes beyond the wood Dasinger emerged from the mouth of a narrow\ngorge, and stopped short with a startled exclamation. His hand dug\nhurriedly into his pocket for the case of kwil needles.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" Duomart inquired sharply.\n\nDasinger produced a somewhat breathless laugh. \"I've decided to take the\nkwil. At once!\"\n\n\"You're feeling ... things?\" Her voice was also shaky.\n\n\"I'll say! Not just a matter of feeling it, either. For example, a\ncouple of old friends are walking towards me at the moment. Dead ones,\nas it happens.\"\n\n\"Ugh!\" she said faintly. \"Hurry up!\"\n\nDasinger shoved the needle's plunger a quarter of the way down on the\nkwil solution, pulled the needle out of his arm. He stood still for some\nseconds, filled his lungs with the cool night air, let it out in a long\nsigh.\n\n\"That did it!\" he announced, his voice steadying again. \"The stuff works\nfast. A quarter shot....\"\n\n\"Why did you wait so long?\"\n\n\"It wasn't too bad till just now. Then suddenly ... that generator can't\nbe putting out evenly! Anyway, it hit me like a rock. I doubt you'd be\ninterested in details.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't,\" Duomart agreed. \"I'm crawly enough as it is up here. I\nwish we were through with this!\"\n\n\"With just a little luck we should be off the planet in an hour.\"\n\nBy the time he could hear the lapping of the lake water on the wind, he\nwas aware of the growing pulse of Hovig's generator ahead of him, alive\nand malignant in the night. Then the Fleet scout came into the glasses,\na squat, dark ship, its base concealed in the growth that had sprung up\naround it after it piled up on the slope. Dasinger moved past the scout,\npushing through bushy aromatic shrubbery which thickened as he neared\nthe water. He felt physically sick and sluggish now, was aware, too, of\nan increasing reluctance to go on. He would need more of the drug\nbefore attempting to enter the Antares.\n\nTo the west, the sky was partly clear, and presently he saw the wreck of\nthe Dosey Asteroids raider loom up over the edge of the lake arm,\nblotting out a section of stars. Still beyond the field of the glasses,\nit looked like an armored water animal about to crawl up on the slopes.\nDasinger approached slowly, in foggy unwillingness, emerged from the\nbushes into open ground, and saw a broad ramp furred with a thick coat\nof moldlike growth rise steeply towards an open lock in the upper part\nof the Antares. The pulse of the generator might have been the beating\nof the maimed ship's heart, angry and threatening. It seemed to be\ngrowing stronger. And had something moved in the lock? Dasinger stood,\nsenses swimming sickly, dreaming that something huge rose slowly,\ntowered over him like a giant wave, leaned forwards....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Still all right?\" Duomart inquired.\n\nThe wave broke.\n\n\"_Dasinger! What's happened?_\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" Dasinger said, his voice raw. He pulled the empty needle out\nof his arm, dropped it. \"But something nearly did! The kwil I took\nwasn't enough. I was standing here waiting to let that damned machine\nswamp me when you spoke.\"\n\n\"You should have heard what you sounded like over the communicator! I\nthought you were ...\" her voice stopped for an instant, began again.\n\"Anyway,\" she said briskly, \"you're loaded with kwil now, I hope?\"\n\n\"More than I should be, probably.\" Dasinger rubbed both hands slowly\ndown along his face. \"Well, it couldn't be helped. That was pretty\nclose, I guess! I don't even remember getting the hypo out of the case.\"\n\nHe looked back up at the looming bow of the Antares, unbeautiful enough\nbut prosaically devoid of menace and mystery now, though the pulsing\nbeat still came from there. A mechanical obstacle and nothing else. \"I'm\ngoing on in now.\"\n\nFrom the darkness within the lock came the smell of stagnant water, of\nold decay. The mold that proliferated over the ramp did not extend into\nthe wreck. But other things grew inside, pale and oily tendrils\nfestooning the walls. Dasinger removed his night glasses, brought out a\npencil light, let the beam fan out, and moved through the lock.\n\nThe crash which had crumpled the ship's lower shell had thrust up the\nflooring of the lock compartment, turned it into what was nearly level\nfooting now. On the right, a twenty-foot black gap showed between the\nragged edge of the deck and the far bulkhead from which it had been\ntorn. The oily plant life spread over the edges of the flooring and on\ndown into the flooded lower sections of the Antares. The pulse of\nHovig's generator came from above and the left where a passage slanted\nsteeply up into the ship's nose. Dasinger turned towards the passage,\nbegan clambering up.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was no guesswork involved in determining which of the doors along\nthe passage hid the machine in what, if Graylock's story was correct,\nhad been Hovig's personal stateroom. As Dasinger approached that point,\nit was like climbing into silent thunder. The door was locked, and\nthough the walls beside it were warped and cracked, the cracks were too\nnarrow to permit entry. Dasinger dug out a tool which had once been the\nprized property of one of Orado's more eminent safecrackers, and went to\nwork on the lock. A minute or two later he forced the door partly back\nin its tilted frame, scrambled through into the cabin.\n\nNot enough was left of Hovig after this span of time to be particularly\noffensive. The generator lay in a lower corner, half buried under other\nmolded and unrecognizable debris. Dasinger uncovered it, feeling as if\nhe were drowning in the invisible torrent pouring out from it, knelt\ndown and placed the light against the wall beside him.\n\nThe machine matched Graylock's description. A pancake-shaped heavy\nplastic casing eighteen inches across, two thick studs set into its\nedge, one stud depressed and flush with the surface, the other extended.\nDasinger thumbed experimentally at the extended stud, found it\napparently immovable, took out his gun.\n\n\"How is it going, Dasinger?\" Miss Mines asked.\n\n\"All right,\" Dasinger said. He realized he was speaking with difficulty.\n\"I've found the thing! Trying to get it shut off now. Tell you in a\nminute....\"\n\nHe tapped the extended stud twice with the butt of the gun, then slashed\nheavily down. The stud flattened back into the machine. Its counterpart\ndidn't move. The drowning sensations continued.\n\nDasinger licked his lips, dropped the gun into his pocket, brought out\nthe lock opener. He had the generator's cover plate pried partway back\nwhen it shattered. With that, the thunder that wasn't sound ebbed\nswiftly from the cabin. Dasinger reached into the generator, wrenched\nout a power battery, snapping half a dozen leads.\n\nHe sat back on his heels, momentarily dizzy with relief, then climbed to\nhis feet with the smashed components of Hovig's machine, and turned to\nthe door. Something in the debris along the wall flashed dazzlingly in\nthe beam of his light.\n\nDasinger stared at the star hyacinth for an instant, then picked it up.\nIt was slightly larger than the one Graylock had carried out of the\nAntares with him, perfectly cut. He found four others of similar quality\nwithin the next minute, started back down to the lock compartment with\nwhat might amount to two million credits in honest money, around half\nthat in the Hub's underworld gem trade, in one of his pockets.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Got the thing's teeth pulled now.\"\n\n\"Thank God! Coming right down....\"\n\nThe Mooncat was sliding in from the south as Dasinger stepped out on the\nhead of the ramp. \"Lock's open,\" Duomart's voice informed him. \"I'll\ncome aft and help.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt took four trips with the gravity crane to transfer the salvage\nequipment into the Antares's lock compartment. Then Miss Mines sealed\nthe Mooncat and went back upstairs. Dasinger climbed into one of the\nthree salvage suits, hung the wrist communicator inside the helmet,\nsnapped on the suit's lights and went over to the edge of the\ncompartment deck. Black water reflected the lights thirty feet below. He\nchecked the assortment of tools attached to his belt, nudged the suit's\ngravity cutoff to the right, energized magnetic pads on knees, boot tips\nand wrists, then fly-walked rapidly down a bulkhead and dropped into the\nwater.\n\n\"No go, Duomart!\" he informed the girl ten minutes later, his voice\nheavy with disappointment. \"It's an ungodly twisted mess down here ...\nworse than I thought it might be! Looks as if we'll have to cut all the\nway through to that vault. Give Egavine the signal to start herding the\nboys down.\"\n\nApproximately an hour afterwards, Miss Mines reported urgently through\nthe communicator, \"They'll reach the lock in less than four minutes now,\nDasinger! Better drop it and come up!\"\n\n\"I'm on my way.\" Dasinger reluctantly switched off the beam-saw he was\nworking with, fastened it to the belt of the salvage suit, turned in the\nmurky water and started back towards the upper sections of the wreck.\nThe job of getting through the tangled jungle of metal and plastic to\nthe gem vault appeared no more than half completed, and the prospect of\nbeing delayed over it until the Spy discovered them here began to look\nlike a disagreeably definite possibility. He clambered and floated\nhurriedly up through the almost vertical passage he'd cleared, found\ndaylight flooding the lock compartment, the system's yellow sun well\nabove the horizon. Peeling off the salvage suit, he restored the\ncommunicator to his wrist and went over to the head of the ramp.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe five men came filing down the last slopes in the morning light,\nTaunus and Calat in the lead, Graylock behind them, the winged animal\nriding his shoulder and lifting occasionally into the air to flutter\nabout the group. Quist and Egavine brought up the rear. Dasinger took\nthe gun from his pocket.\n\n\"I'll clip my gun to the suit belt when I go back down in the water with\nthe boys,\" he told the communicator. \"If the doctor's turning any tricks\nover in his mind, that should give him food for thought. I'll relieve\nQuist of his weapon as he comes in.\"\n\n\"What about the guns in Graylock's hut?\" Duomart asked.\n\n\"No charge left in them. If I'm reasonably careful, I really don't see\nwhat Dr. Egavine can do. He knows he loses his half-interest in the\nsalvage the moment he pulls any illegal stunts.\"\n\nA minute or two later, he called out, \"Hold it there, doctor?\"\n\nThe group shuffled to a stop near the foot of the ramp, staring up at\nhim.\n\n\"Yes, Dasinger?\" Dr. Egavine called back, sounding a trifle winded.\n\n\"Have Quist come up first and alone, please.\" Dasinger disarmed the\nlittle man at the entrance to the lock, motioned him on to the center of\nthe compartment. The others arrived then in a line, filed past Dasinger\nand joined Quist.\n\n\"You've explained the situation to everybody?\" Dasinger asked Egavine.\nThere was an air of tenseness about the little group he didn't like,\nthough tension might be understandable enough under the circumstances.\n\n\"Yes,\" Dr. Egavine said. \"They feel entirely willing to assist us, of\ncourse.\" He smiled significantly.\n\n\"Fine.\" Dasinger nodded. \"Line them up and let's get going! Taunus\nfirst. Get ...\"\n\nThere was a momentary stirring of the air back of his head. He turned\nsharply, jerking up the gun, felt twin needles drive into either side of\nhis neck.\n\nHis body instantly went insensate. The lock appeared to circle about\nhim, then he was on his back and Graylock's pet was alighting with a\nflutter of wings on his chest. It craned its head forward to peer into\nhis face, the tip of its mouth tube open, showing a ring of tiny teeth.\nVision and awareness left Dasinger together.\n\nThe other men hadn't moved. Now Dr. Egavine, his face a little pale,\ncame over to Dasinger, the birdlike creature bounding back to the edge\nof the lock as he approached. Egavine knelt down, said quietly, his\nmouth near the wrist communicator, \"Duomart Mines, you will obey me.\"\n\nThere was silence for a second or two. Then the communicator whispered,\n\"Yes.\"\n\nDr. Egavine drew in a long, slow breath.\n\n\"You feel no question, no concern, no doubt about this situation,\" he\nwent on. \"You will bring the ship down now and land it safely beside the\nAntares. Then come up into the lock of the Antares for further\ninstructions.\" Egavine stood up, his eyes bright with triumph.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the Mooncat three miles overhead, Duomart switched off her wrist\ncommunicator, sat white-faced, staring at the image of the Antares in\nthe ground-view plate.\n\n\"Sweet Jana!\" she whispered. \"How did he ... now what do I ...\"\n\nShe hesitated an instant, then opened a console drawer, took out the\nkwil needle Dasinger had left with her and slipped it into a pocket,\nclipped the holstered shocker back to her belt, and reached for the\ncontrols. A vast whistling shriek smote the Antares and the ears of\nthose within as the Mooncat ripped down through atmosphere at an\nunatmospheric speed, leveled out smoothly and floated to the ground\nbeside the wreck.\n\nThere was no one in sight in the lock of the Antares as Duomart came out\nand sealed the Mooncat's entry behind her. She went quickly up the\nbroad, mold-covered ramp. The lock remained empty. From beyond it came\nthe sound of some metallic object being pulled about, a murmur of\nvoices. Twelve steps from the top, she took out the little gun, ran up\nto the lock and into it, bringing the gun up. She had a glimpse of Dr.\nEgavine and Quist standing near a rusty bench in the compartment, of\nGraylock half into a salvage suit, Dasinger on the floor ... then a\nflick of motion to right and left.\n\nThe tips of two space lines lashed about her simultaneously, one pinning\nher arms to her sides, the other clamping about her ankles and twitching\nher legs out from beneath her. She fired twice blindly to the left as\nthe lines snapped her face down to the floor of the compartment. The\ngun was clamped beneath her stretched-out body and useless.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"What made that animal attack me anyway?\" Dasinger asked wearily. He had\njust regained consciousness and been ordered by Calat to join the others\non a rusted metal bench in the center of the lock compartment; Duomart\nto his left, Egavine on his right, Quist on the other side of Egavine.\nCalat stood watching them fifteen feet away, holding Dasinger's gun in\none hand while he jiggled a few of Hovig's star hyacinths gently about\nin the other.\n\nCalat's expression was cheerful, which made him the exception here. Liu\nTaunus and Graylock were down in the hold of the ship, working sturdily\nwith cutter beams and power hoists to get to the sealed vault and blow\nit open. How long they'd been at it, Dasinger didn't know.\n\n\"You can thank your double-crossing partner for what happened!\" Duomart\ninformed him. She looked pretty thoroughly mussed up though still\nunsubdued. \"Graylock's been using the bird-thing to hunt with,\" she\nsaid. \"It's a bloodsucker ... nicks some animal with its claws and the\nanimal stays knocked out while the little beast fills its tummy. So the\nintellectual over there had Graylock point you out to his pet, and it\nwaited until your back was turned....\" She hesitated, went on less\nvehemently, \"Sorry about not carrying out orders, Dasinger. I assumed\nEgavine really was in control here, and I could have handled _him_. I\nwalked into a trap.\" She fished the shards of a smashed kwil needle out\nof her pocket, looked at them, and dropped them on the floor before her.\n\"I got slammed around a little,\" she explained.\n\nCalat laughed, said something in the Fleet tongue, grinning at her. She\nignored him.\n\nEgavine said, \"My effects were secretly inspected while we were at the\nFleet station, Dasinger, and the Fleetmen have been taking drugs to\nimmunize themselves against my hypnotic agents. They disclosed this when\nMiss Mines brought the speedboat down. There was nothing I could do. I\nregret to say that they intend to murder us. They are waiting only to\nassure themselves that the star hyacinths actually are in the indicated\ncompartment.\"\n\n\"Great!\" Dasinger groaned. He put his hands back in a groping gesture to\nsupport himself on the bench.\n\n\"Still pretty feeble, I suppose?\" Miss Mines inquired, gentle sympathy\nin her voice.\n\n\"I'm poisoned,\" he muttered brokenly. \"The thing's left me\nparalyzed....\" He sagged sideways a little, his hand moving behind\nDuomart. He pinched her then in a markedly unparalyzed and vigorous\nmanner.\n\nDuomart's right eyelid flickered for an instant.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Somebody wrung the little monster's neck before I got here,\" she\nremarked. \"But there're other necks _I'd_ sooner wring! Your partner's,\nfor instance. Not that he's necessarily the biggest louse around at the\nmoment.\" She nodded at Calat. \"The two runches who call themselves\nFleetmen don't intend to share the star hyacinths even with their own\ngang! They're rushing the job through so they can be on their way to the\nHub before the Spy arrives. And don't think Liu Taunus trusts that\nmuscle-bound foogal standing there, either! He's hanging on to the key\nof the Mooncat's console until he comes back up.\"\n\nCalat smiled with a suggestion of strain, then said something in a flat,\nexpressionless voice, staring at her.\n\n\"Oh, sure,\" she returned. \"With Taunus holding me, I suppose?\" She\nlooked at Dasinger. \"They're not shooting _me_ right off, you know,\" she\ntold him. \"They're annoyed with me, so they're taking me along for\nsomething a little more special. But they'll have to skip the fun if the\nSpy shows up, or I'll be telling twenty armed Fleetmen exactly what\nkind of thieving cheats they have leading them!\" She looked back at\nCalat, smiled, placed the tip of her tongue lightly between her lips for\nan instant, then pronounced a few dozen Fleet words in a clear, precise\nvoice.\n\nIt must have been an extraordinarily unflattering comment. Calat went\nwhite, then red. Half-smart tough had been Duomart's earlier description\nof him. It began to look like an accurate one ... Dasinger felt a surge\nof pleased anticipation. His legs already were drawn well back beneath\nthe bench; he shifted his weight slowly forwards now, keeping an\nexpression of anxious concern on his face. Calat spoke in Fleetlingue\nagain, voice thickening with rage.\n\nMiss Mines replied sweetly, stood up. The challenge direct.\n\nThe Fleetman's face worked in incredulous fury. He shifted the gun to\nhis left hand and came striding purposefully towards Miss Mines, right\nfist cocked. Then, as Dasinger tensed his legs happily, a muffled thump\nfrom deep within the wreck announced the opening of the star hyacinth\nvault.\n\nThe sound was followed by instant proof that Hovig had trapped the\nvault.\n\nDuomart and Calat screamed together. Dasinger drove himself forward off\nthe bench, aiming for the Fleetman's legs, checked and turned for the\ngun which Calat, staggering and shrieking, his face distorted with\nlunatic terror, had flung aside. Dr. Egavine, alert for this\ncontingency, already was stooping for the gun, hand outstretched, when\nDasinger lunged against him, bowling him over.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDasinger came up with the gun, Quist pounding at his shoulders, flung\nthe little man aside, turned back in a frenzy of urgency. Duomart\ntwisted about on the floor near the far end of the compartment, arms\ncovering her face. The noises that bubbled out from behind her arms set\nDasinger's teeth on edge. She rolled over convulsively twice, stopped\ndangerously close to the edge of the jagged break in the deck, was\nturning again as Dasinger dropped beside her and caught her.\n\nImmediately there was a heavy, painful blow on his shoulder. He glanced\nup, saw Quist running toward him, a rusted chunk of metal like the one\nhe had thrown in his raised hand, and Egavine peering at both of them\nfrom the other side of the compartment. Dasinger flung a leg across\nDuomart, pinning her down, pulled out the gun, fired without aiming.\nQuist reversed his direction almost in mid-stride. Dasinger fired\nagain, saw Egavine dart towards the lock, hesitate there an instant,\nthen disappear down the ramp, Quist sprinting out frantically after him.\n\nA moment later he drove one of the remaining kwil needles through the\ncloth of Duomart's uniform, and rammed the plunger down.\n\nThe drug hit hard and promptly. Between one instant and the next, the\nplunging and screaming ended; she drew in a long, shuddering breath,\nwent limp, her eyes closing slowly. Dasinger was lifting her from the\nfloor when the complete silence in the compartment caught his attention.\nHe looked around. Calat was not in sight. And only then did he become\naware of a familiar sensation ... a Hovig generator's pulsing, savage\nstorm of seeming nothingness, nullified by the drug in his blood.\n\nHe laid the unconscious girl on the bench, went on to the lock.\n\nDr. Egavine and Quist had vanished; the thick shrubbery along the lake\nbank stirred uneasily at twenty different points but he wasn't looking\nfor the pair. With the Mooncat inaccessible to them, there was only one\nplace they could go. Calat's body lay doubled up in the rocks below the\nramp, almost sixty feet down, where other human bodies had lain six\nyears earlier. Dasinger glanced over at the Fleet scout, went back into\nthe compartment.\n\nHe was buckling himself into the third salvage suit when he heard the\nscout's lifeboat take off. At a guess Hovig's little private collection\nof star hyacinths was taking off with it. Dasinger decided he couldn't\ncare less.\n\nHe snapped on the headpiece, then hesitated at the edge of the deck,\nlooking down. A bubble of foggy white light was rising slowly through\nthe water of the hold, and in a moment the headpiece of one of the other\nsuits broke the oily surface, stayed there, bobbing gently about.\nDasinger climbed down, brought Liu Taunus's body back up to the lock\ncompartment, and recovered the Mooncat's master key.\n\nHe found Graylock floating in his suit against a bulkhead not far from\nthe shattered vault where Hovig's two remaining generators thundered.\nDasinger silenced the machines, fastened them and a small steel case\ncontaining nearly a hundred million credits' worth of star hyacinths to\nthe salvage carrier, and towed it all up to the lock compartment.\n\nA very few minutes later, the Mooncat lifted in somewhat jerky, erratic\nfashion from the planet's surface. As Dasinger had suspected, he lacked,\nand by a good deal, Miss Mines's trained sensitivity with the\nspeedboat's controls; but he succeeded in wrestling the little ship up\nto a five-mile altitude where a subspace dive might be carried out in\nrelative safety.\n\nHe was attempting then to get the Mooncat's nose turned away from the\ndistant volcano ranges towards which she seemed determined to point when\nthe detector needles slapped flat against their pins and the alarm bell\nsounded. A strange ship stood outlined in the Mooncat's stern screen.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe image vanished as Dasinger hit the dive button, simultaneously\nflattening the speed controls with a slam of his hand. The semisolid\nsubspace turbulence representing the mountain ranges beyond the lake\nflashed instantly past below him ... within yards, it seemed. Another\nsecond put them beyond the planet's atmosphere. Then the Spy reappeared\nin subspace, following hard. A hammering series of explosions showed\nsuddenly in the screens, kept up for a few hair-raising moments, began\nto drop back. Five minutes later, with the distance between them\nwidening rapidly, the Spy gave up the chase, swung around and headed\nback towards the planet.\n\nDasinger shakily reduced his ship's speed to relatively sane level, kept\nher moving along another twenty minutes, then surfaced into normspace\nand set a general course for the Hub. He was a very fair yachtsman for\na planeteer. But after riding the Mooncat for the short time he'd turned\nher loose to keep ahead of the Spy through the G2's stress zone, he\ndidn't have to be told that in Fleet territory he was outclassed. He\nmopped his forehead, climbed gratefully out of the pilot seat and went\nto the cot he had hauled into the control room, to check on Duomart\nMines.\n\nShe was still unconscious, of course; the dose he'd given her was enough\nto knock a kwil-sensitive out for at least a dozen hours. Dasinger\nlooked down at the filth-smudged, pale face, the bruised cheeks and\nblackened left eye for a few seconds, then opened Dr. Egavine's medical\nkit to do what he could about getting Miss Mines patched up again.\n\nFifteen hours later she was still asleep, though to all outer\nappearances back in good repair. Dasinger happened to be bemusedly\nstudying her face once more when she opened her eyes and gazed up at\nhim.\n\n\"We made it! You ...\" She smiled, tried to sit up, looked startled, then\nindignant. \"What's the idea of tying me down to this thing?\"\n\nDasinger nodded. \"I guess you're all there!\" He reached down to unfasten\nher from the cot. \"After what happened, I wasn't so sure you'd be\nentirely rational when the kwil wore off and you woke up.\"\n\nDuomart paled a little. \"I hadn't imagined ...\" She shook her blond\nhead. \"Well, let's skip that! I'll have nightmares for years.... What\nhappened to the others?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDasinger told her, concluded, \"Egavine may have run into the Spy, but I\ndoubt it. He'll probably show up in the Hub eventually with the gems he\ntook from Calat, and if he doesn't get caught peddling them he may wind\nup with around a million credits ... about the sixth part of what he\nwould have collected if he'd stopped playing crooked and trying to get\neverything. I doubt the doctor will ever quit kicking himself for that!\"\n\n\"Your agency gets the whole salvage fee now, eh?\"\n\n\"Not exactly,\" Dasinger said. \"Considering everything that's happened,\nthe Kyth Interstellar Detective Agency would have to be extremely\nungrateful if it didn't feel you'd earned the same split we were going\nto give Dr. Egavine.\"\n\nMiss Mines gazed at him in startled silence, flushed excitedly. \"Think\nyou can talk the Kyth people into _that_, Dasinger?\"\n\n\"I imagine so,\" Dasinger said, \"since I own the agency. That should\nfinance your Willata Fleet operation very comfortably and still leave a\ncouple of million credits over for your old age. I doubt we'll clear\nanything on Hovig's generators....\"\n\nMiss Mines looked uncomfortable. \"Do you have those things aboard?\"\n\n\"At the moment. Disassembled of course. Primarily I didn't want the\nFleet gang to get their hands on them. We might lose them in space\nsomewhere or take them back to the Federation for the scientists to poke\nover. We'll discuss that on the way. Now, do you feel perky enough to\nwant a look at the stuff that's cost around a hundred and fifty lives\nbefore it ever hit the Hub's markets?\"\n\n\"Couldn't feel perkier!\" She straightened up expectantly. \"Let's see\nthem....\"\n\nDasinger turned away towards the wall where he had put down the little\nsteel case with the loot of the Dosey Asteroids robbery.\n\nBehind him, Duomart screamed.\n\nHe spun back to her, his face white. \"What's the matter?\"\n\nDuomart was staring wide-eyed past him towards the instrument console,\nthe back of one hand to her mouth. \"That ... the thing!\"\n\n\"Thing?\"\n\n\"Big ... yellow ... wet ... _ugh_! It's ducked behind the console,\nDasinger! It's lurking there!\"\n\n\"Oh!\" Dasinger said, relaxing. He smiled. \"That's all right. Don't worry\nabout it.\"\n\n\"_Don't worry about_ ... are you crazy?\"\n\n\"Not in the least. I thought you were for a second, but it's very\nsimple. You've worked off the kwil and now you're in the hangover\nperiod. You get hallucinations then, just as I usually do. For the next\neight or nine hours, you'll be seeing odd things around from time to\ntime. So what? They're not real.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"All right, they're not real, but they seem real enough while they're\naround,\" Duomart said. \"I don't want to see them.\" She caught her breath\nand her hand flew up to her mouth again. \"Dasinger, please, don't you\nhave something that will put me back to sleep till I'm past the hangover\ntoo?\"\n\nDasinger reflected. \"One of Doc Egavine's hypno sprays will do it. I\nknow enough of the mumbo jumbo to send you to dreamland for another ten\nhours.\" He smiled evilly. \"Of course, you realize that means you're\nputting yourself completely in my power.\"\n\nDuomart's eyes narrowed for an instant. She considered him, grinned.\n\"I'll risk it,\" she said.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ December 1961.\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
