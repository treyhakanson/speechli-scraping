But not until I discovered the old pulp\nscience-fantasy magazines, at the age of sixteen, did this general\ndesire become a specific urge to write science-fantasy adventures.\n\nI took a lot of detours on the way. I discovered s-f in its golden age:\nthe age of Kuttner, C.L. Moore, Leigh Brackett, Ed Hamilton and Jack\nVance. But while I was still collecting rejection slips for my early\nefforts, the fashion changed. Adventures on faraway worlds and strange\ndimensions went out of fashion, and the new look in\nscience-fiction--emphasis on the _science_--came in.\n\nSo my first stories were straight science-fiction, and I'm not trying to\nput down that kind of story. It has its place. By and large, the kind of\nscience-fiction which makes tomorrow's headlines as near as this\nmorning's coffee, has enlarged popular awareness of the modern,\nmiraculous world of science we live in. It has helped generations of\nyoung people feel at ease with a rapidly changing world.\n\nBut fashions change, old loves return, and now that Sputniks clutter up\nthe sky with new and unfamiliar moons, the readers of science-fiction\nare willing to wait for tomorrow to read tomorrow's headlines. Once\nagain, I think, there is a place, a wish, a need and hunger for the\nwonder and color of the world way out. The world beyond the stars. The\nworld we _won't_ live to see. That is why I wrote THE DOOR THROUGH\nSPACE.\n\n--MARION ZIMMER BRADLEY\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n\nBeyond the spaceport gates, the men of the Kharsa were hunting down a\nthief. I heard the shrill cries, the pad-padding of feet in strides just\na little too long and loping to be human, raising echoes all down the\ndark and dusty streets leading up to the main square.\n\nBut the square itself lay empty in the crimson noon of Wolf. Overhead\nthe dim red ember of Phi Coronis, Wolf's old and dying sun, gave out a\npale and heatless light. The pair of Spaceforce guards at the gates,\nwearing the black leathers of the Terran Empire, shockers holstered at\ntheir belts, were drowsing under the arched gateway where the\nstar-and-rocket emblem proclaimed the domain of Terra. One of them, a\nsnub-nosed youngster only a few weeks out from Earth, cocked an\ninquisitive ear at the cries and scuffling feet, then jerked his head at\nme.\n\n\"Hey, Cargill, you can talk their lingo. What's going on out there?\"\n\nI stepped out past the gateway to listen. There was still no one to be\nseen in the square. It lay white and windswept, a barricade of\nemptiness; to one side the spaceport and the white skyscraper of the\nTerran Headquarters, and at the other side, the clutter of low\nbuildings, the street-shrine, the little spaceport cafe smelling of\ncoffee and _jaco_, and the dark opening mouths of streets that rambled\ndown into the Kharsa--the old town, the native quarter. But I was alone\nin the square with the shrill cries--closer now, raising echoes from the\nenclosing walls--and the loping of many feet down one of the dirty\nstreets.\n\nThen I saw him running, dodging, a hail of stones flying round his head;\nsomeone or something small and cloaked and agile. Behind him the\nstill-faceless mob howled and threw stones. I could not yet understand\nthe cries; but they were out for blood, and I knew it.\n\nI said briefly, \"Trouble coming,\" just before the mob spilled out into\nthe square. The fleeing dwarf stared about wildly for an instant, his\nhead jerking from side to side so rapidly that it was impossible to get\neven a fleeting impression of his face--human or nonhuman, familiar or\nbizarre. Then, like a pellet loosed from its sling, he made straight for\nthe gateway and safety.\n\nAnd behind him the loping mob yelled and howled and came pouring over\nhalf the square. Just half. Then by that sudden intuition which\npermeates even the most crazed mob with some semblance of reason, they\ncame to a ragged halt, heads turning from side to side.\n\nI stepped up on the lower step of the Headquarters building, and looked\nthem over.\n\nMost of them were _chaks_, the furred man-tall nonhumans of the Kharsa,\nand not the better class. Their fur was unkempt, their tails naked with\nfilth and disease. Their leather aprons hung in tatters. One or two in\nthe crowd were humans, the dregs of the Kharsa. But the star-and-rocket\nemblem blazoned across the spaceport gates sobered even the wildest\nblood-lust somewhat; they milled and shifted uneasily in their half of\nthe square.\n\nFor a moment I did not see where their quarry had gone. Then I saw him\ncrouched, not four feet from me, in a patch of shadow. Simultaneously\nthe mob saw him, huddled just beyond the gateway, and a howl of\nfrustration and rage went ringing round the square. Someone threw a\nstone. It zipped over my head, narrowly missing me, and landed at the\nfeet of the black-leathered guard. He jerked his head up and gestured\nwith the shocker which had suddenly come unholstered.\n\nThe gesture should have been enough. On Wolf, Terran law has been\nwritten in blood and fire and exploding atoms; and the line is drawn\nfirm and clear. The men of Spaceforce do not interfere in the old town,\nor in any of the native cities. But when violence steps over the\nthreshold, passing the blazon of the star and rocket, punishment is\nswift and terrible. The threat should have been enough.\n\nInstead a howl of abuse went up from the crowd.\n\n\"_Terranan!_\"\n\n\"Son of the Ape!\"\n\nThe Spaceforce guards were shoulder to shoulder behind me now. The\nsnub-nosed kid, looking slightly pale, called out. \"Get inside the\ngates, Cargill! If I have to shoot--\"\n\nThe older man motioned him to silence. \"Wait. Cargill,\" he called.\n\nI nodded to show that I heard.\n\n\"You talk their lingo. Tell them to haul off! Damned if I want to\nshoot!\"\n\nI stepped down and walked into the open square, across the crumbled\nwhite stones, toward the ragged mob. Even with two armed Spaceforce men\nat my back, it made my skin crawl, but I flung up my empty hand in token\nof peace:\n\n\"Take your mob out of the square,\" I shouted in the jargon of the\nKharsa. \"This territory is held in compact of peace! Settle your\nquarrels elsewhere!\"\n\nThere was a little stirring in the crowd. The shock of being addressed\nin their own tongue, instead of the Terran Standard which the Empire has\nforced on Wolf, held them silent for a minute. I had learned that long\nago: that speaking in any of the languages of Wolf would give me a\nminute's advantage.\n\nBut only a minute. Then one of the mob yelled, \"We'll go if you give'm\nto us! He's no right to Terran sanctuary!\"\n\nI walked over to the huddled dwarf, miserably trying to make himself\nsmaller against the wall. I nudged him with my foot.\n\n\"Get up. Who are you?\"\n\nThe hood fell away from his face as he twitched to his feet. He was\ntrembling violently. In the shadow of the hood I saw a furred face, a\nquivering velvety muzzle, and great soft golden eyes which held\nintelligence and terror.\n\n\"What have you done? Can't you talk?\"\n\nHe held out the tray which he had shielded under his cloak, an ordinary\npeddler's tray. \"Toys. Sell toys. Children. You got'm?\"\n\nI shook my head and pushed the creature away, with only a glance at the\narray of delicately crafted manikins, tiny animals, prisms and crystal\nwhirligigs. \"You'd better get out of here. Scram. Down that street.\" I\npointed.\n\nA voice from the crowd shouted again, and it had a very ugly sound. \"He\nis a spy of Nebran!\"\n\n\"_Nebran--_\" The dwarfish nonhuman gabbled something then doubled\nbehind me. I saw him dodge, feint in the direction of the gates, then,\nas the crowd surged that way, run for the street-shrine across the\nsquare, slipping from recess to recess of the wall. A hail of stones\nwent flying in that direction. The little toy-seller dodged into the\nstreet-shrine.\n\nThen there was a hoarse \"Ah, aaah!\" of terror, and the crowd edged away,\nsurged backward. The next minute it had begun to melt away, its entity\ndissolving into separate creatures, slipping into the side alleys and\nthe dark streets that disgorged into the square. Within three minutes\nthe square lay empty again in the pale-crimson noon.\n\nThe kid in black leather let his breath go and swore, slipping his\nshocker into its holster. He stared and demanded profanely, \"Where'd the\nlittle fellow go?\"\n\n\"Who knows?\" the other shrugged. \"Probably sneaked into one of the\nalleys. Did you see where he went, Cargill?\"\n\nI came slowly back to the gateway. To me, it had seemed that he ducked\ninto the street-shrine and vanished into thin air, but I've lived on\nWolf long enough to know you can't trust your eyes here. I said so, and\nthe kid swore again, gulping, more upset than he wanted to admit. \"Does\nthis kind of thing happen often?\"\n\n\"All the time,\" his companion assured him soberly, with a sidewise wink\nat me. I didn't return the wink.\n\nThe kid wouldn't let it drop. \"Where did you learn their lingo, Mr.\nCargill?\"\n\n\"I've been on Wolf a long time,\" I said, spun on my heel and walked\ntoward Headquarters. I tried not to hear, but their voices followed me\nanyhow, discreetly lowered, but not lowered enough.\n\n\"Kid, don't you know who he is? That's Cargill of the Secret Service!\nSix years ago he was the best man in Intelligence, before--\" The voice\nlowered another decibel, and then there was the kid's voice asking,\nshaken, \"But what the hell happened to his face?\"\n\nI should have been used to it by now. I'd been hearing it, more or less\nbehind my back, for six years. Well, if my luck held, I'd never hear it\nagain. I strode up the white steps of the skyscraper, to finish the\narrangements that would take me away from Wolf forever. To the other end\nof the Empire, to the other end of the galaxy--anywhere, so long as I\nneed not wear my past like a medallion around my neck, or blazoned and\nbranded on what was left of my ruined face.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\n\nThe Terran Empire has set its blazon on four hundred planets circling\nmore than three hundred suns. But no matter what the color of the sun,\nthe number of moons overhead, or the geography of the planet, once you\nstep inside a Headquarters building, you are on Earth. And Earth would\nbe alien to many who called themselves Earthmen, judging by the\nstrangeness I always felt when I stepped into that marble-and-glass\nworld inside the skyscraper. I heard the sound of my steps ringing into\nthin resonance along the marble corridor, and squinted my eyes,\nreadjusting them painfully to the cold yellowness of the lights.\n\nThe Traffic Division was efficiency made insolent, in glass and chrome\nand polished steel, mirrors and windows and looming electronic clerical\nmachines. Most of one wall was taken up by a TV monitor which gave a\nview of the spaceport; a vast open space lighted with blue-white mercury\nvapor lamps, and a chained-down skyscraper of a starship, littered over\nwith swarming ants. The process crew was getting the big ship ready for\nskylift tomorrow morning. I gave it a second and then a third look. I'd\nbe on it when it lifted.\n\nTurning away from the monitored spaceport, I watched myself stride\nforward in the mirrored surfaces that were everywhere; a tall man, a\nlean man, bleached out by years under a red sun, and deeply scarred on\nboth cheeks and around the mouth. Even after six years behind a desk, my\nneat business clothes--suitable for an Earthman with a desk job--didn't\nfit quite right, and I still rose unconsciously on the balls of my feet,\napproximating the lean stooping walk of a Dry-towner from the Coronis\nplains.\n\nThe clerk behind the sign marked TRANSPORTATION was a little rabbit of a\nman with a sunlamp tan, barricaded by a small-sized spaceport of desk,\nand looking as if he liked being shut up there. He looked up in civil\ninquiry.\n\n\"Can I do something for you?\"\n\n\"My name's Cargill. Have you a pass for me?\"\n\nHe stared. A free pass aboard a starship is rare except for professional\nspacemen, which I obviously wasn't. \"Let me check my records,\" he\nhedged, and punched scanning buttons on the glassy surface. Shadows came\nand went, and I saw myself half-reflected, a tipsy shadow in a flurry of\nracing colors. The pattern finally stabilized and the clerk read off\nnames.\n\n\"Brill, Cameron ... ah, yes. Cargill, Race Andrew, Department 38,\ntransfer transportation. Is that you?\"\n\nI admitted it and he started punching more buttons when the sound of the\nname made connection in whatever desk-clerks use for a brain. He stopped\nwith his hand halfway to the button.\n\n\"Are you Race Cargill of the Secret Service, sir? _The_ Race Cargill?\"\n\n\"It's right there,\" I said, gesturing wearily at the projected pattern\nunder the glassy surface.\n\n\"Why, I thought--I mean, everybody took it for granted--that is, I\nheard--\"\n\n\"You thought Cargill had been killed a long time ago because his name\nnever turned up in news dispatches any more?\" I grinned sourly, seeing\nmy image dissolve in blurring shadows, and feeling the long-healed scar\non my mouth draw up to make the grin hideous. \"I'm Cargill, all right.\nI've been up on Floor 38 for six years, holding down a desk any clerk\ncould handle. You for instance.\"\n\nHe gaped. He was a rabbit of a man who had never stepped out of the safe\nfamiliar boundaries of the Terran Trade City. \"You mean _you're_ the man\nwho went to Charin in disguise, and routed out The Lisse? The man who\nscouted the Black Ridge and Shainsa? And you've been working at a desk\nupstairs all these years? It's--hard to believe, sir.\"\n\nMy mouth twitched. It had been hard for me to believe while I was doing\nit. \"The pass?\"\n\n\"Right away, sir.\" He punched buttons and a printed chip of plastic\nextruded from a slot on the desk top. \"Your fingerprint, please?\" He\npressed my finger into the still-soft surface of the plastic, indelibly\nrecording the print; waited a moment for it to harden, then laid the\nchip in the slot of a pneumatic tube. I heard it whoosh away.\n\n\"They'll check your fingerprint against that when you board the ship.\nSkylift isn't till dawn, but you can go aboard as soon as the process\ncrew finishes with her.\" He glanced at the monitor screen, where the\nswarming crew were still doing inexplicable things to the immobile\nspacecraft. \"It will be another hour or two. Where are you going, Mr.\nCargill?\"\n\n\"Some planet in the Hyades Cluster. Vainwal, I think, something like\nthat.\"\n\n\"What's it like there?\"\n\n\"How should I know?\" I'd never been there either. I only knew that\nVainwal had a red sun, and that the Terran Legate could use a trained\nIntelligence officer. And _not_ pin him down to a desk.\n\nThere was respect, and even envy in the little man's voice. \"Could\nI--buy you a drink before you go aboard, Mr. Cargill?\"\n\n\"Thanks, but I have a few loose ends to tie up.\" I didn't, but I was\ndamned if I'd spend my last hour on Wolf under the eyes of a deskbound\nrabbit who preferred his adventure safely secondhand.\n\nBut after I'd left the office and the building, I almost wished I'd\ntaken him up on it. It would be at least an hour before I could board\nthe starship, with nothing to do but hash over old memories, better\nforgotten.\n\nThe sun was lower now. Phi Coronis is a dim star, a dying star, and once\npast the crimson zenith of noon, its light slants into a long\npale-reddish twilight. Four of Wolf's five moons were clustered in a\npale bouquet overhead, mingling thin violet moonlight into the crimson\ndusk.\n\nThe shadows were blue and purple in the empty square as I walked across\nthe stones and stood looking down one of the side streets.\n\nA few steps, and I was in an untidy slum which might have been on\nanother world from the neat bright Trade City which lay west of the\nspaceport. The Kharsa was alive and reeking with the sounds and smells\nof human and half-human life. A naked child, diminutive and\ngolden-furred, darted between two of the chinked pebble-houses, and\ndisappeared, spilling fragile laughter like breaking glass.\n\nA little beast, half snake and half cat, crawled across a roof, spread\nleathery wings, and flapped to the ground. The sour pungent reek of\nincense from the open street-shrine made my nostrils twitch, and a\nhulked form inside, not human, cast me a surly green glare as I passed.\n\nI turned, retracing my steps. There was no danger, of course, so close\nto the Trade City. Even on such planets as Wolf, Terra's laws are\nrespected within earshot of their gates. But there had been rioting here\nand in Charin during the last month. After the display of mob violence\nthis afternoon, a lone Terran, unarmed, might turn up as a solitary\ncorpse flung on the steps of the HQ building.\n\nThere had been a time when I had walked alone from Shainsa to the Polar\nColony. I had known how to melt into this kind of night, shabby and\ninconspicuous, a worn shirtcloak hunched round my shoulders, weaponless\nexcept for the razor-sharp skean in the clasp of the cloak; walking on\nthe balls of my feet like a Dry-towner, not looking or sounding or\nsmelling like an Earthman.\n\nThat rabbit in the Traffic office had stirred up things I'd be wiser to\nforget. It had been six years; six years of slow death behind a desk,\nsince the day when Rakhal Sensar had left me a marked man; death-warrant\nwritten on my scarred face anywhere outside the narrow confines of the\nTerran law on Wolf.\n\nRakhal Sensar--my fists clenched with the old impotent hate. _If I could\nget my hands on him!_\n\nIt had been Rakhal who first led me through the byways of the Kharsa,\nteaching me the jargon of a dozen tribes, the chirping call of the\nYa-men, the way of the catmen of the rain-forests, the argot of thieves\nmarkets, the walk and step of the Dry-towners from Shainsa and Daillon\nand Ardcarran--the parched cities of dusty, salt stone which spread out\nin the bottoms of Wolf's vanished oceans. Rakhal was from Shainsa,\nhuman, tall as an Earthman, weathered by salt and sun, and he had worked\nfor Terran Intelligence since we were boys. We had traveled all over our\nworld together, and found it good.\n\nAnd then, for some reason I had never known, it had come to an end.\nEven now I was not wholly sure why he had erupted, that day, into\nviolence and a final explosion. Then he had disappeared, leaving me a\nmarked man. And a lonely one: Juli had gone with him.\n\nI strode the streets of the slum unseeing, my thoughts running a\nfamiliar channel. Juli, my kid sister, clinging around Rakhal's neck,\nher gray eyes hating me. I had never seen her again.\n\nThat had been six years ago. One more adventure had shown me that my\nusefulness to the Secret Service was over. Rakhal had vanished, but he\nhad left me a legacy: my name, written on the sure scrolls of death\nanywhere outside the safe boundaries of Terran law. A marked man, I had\ngone back to slow stagnation behind a desk. I'd stood it as long as I\ncould.\n\nWhen it finally got too bad, Magnusson had been sympathetic. He was the\nChief of Terran Intelligence on Wolf, and I was next in line for his\njob, but he understood when I quit. He'd arranged the transfer and the\npass, and I was leaving tonight.\n\nI was nearly back to the spaceport by now, across from the street-shrine\nat the edge of the square. It was here that the little toy-seller had\nvanished. But it was exactly like a thousand, a hundred thousand other\nsuch street-shrines on Wolf, a smudge of incense reeking and stinking\nbefore the squatting image of Nebran, the Toad God whose face and symbol\nare everywhere on Wolf. I stared for a moment at the ugly idol, then\nslowly moved away.\n\nThe lighted curtains of the spaceport cafe attracted my attention and I\nwent inside. A few spaceport personnel in storm gear were drinking\ncoffee at the counter, a pair of furred _chaks_, lounging beneath the\nmirrors at the far end, and a trio of Dry-towners, rangy, weathered men\nin crimson and blue shirt cloaks, were standing at a wall shelf, eating\nTerran food with aloof dignity.\n\nIn my business clothes I felt more conspicuous than the _chaks_. What\nplace had a civilian here, between the uniforms of the spacemen and the\ncolorful brilliance of the Dry-towners?\n\nA snub-nosed girl with alabaster hair came to take my order. I asked for\n_jaco_ and bunlets, and carried the food to a wall shelf near the\nDry-towners. Their dialect fell soft and familiar on my ears. One of\nthem, without altering the expression on his face or the easy tone of\nhis voice, began to make elaborate comments on my entrance, my\nappearance, my ancestry and probably personal habits, all defined in the\ncolorfully obscene dialect of Shainsa.\n\nThat had happened before. The Wolfan sense of humor is only half-human.\nThe finest joke is to criticize and insult a stranger, preferably an\nEarthman, to his very face, in an unknown language, perfectly deadpan.\nIn my civilian clothes I was obviously fair game.\n\nA look or gesture of resentment would have lost face and dignity--what\nthe Dry-towners call their _kihar_--permanently. I leaned over and\nremarked in their own dialect that I would, at some future and\nunspecified time, appreciate the opportunity to return their\ncompliments.\n\nBy rights they should have laughed, made some barbed remark about my\ncommand of language and crossed their hands in symbol of a jest decently\nreversed on themselves. Then we would have bought each other a drink,\nand that would be that.\n\nBut it didn't happen that way. Not this time. The tallest of the three\nwhirled, upsetting his drink in the process. I heard its thin shatter\nthrough the squeal of the alabaster-haired girl, as a chair crashed\nover. They faced me three abreast, and one of them fumbled in the clasp\nof his shirtcloak.\n\nI edged backward, my own hand racing up for a skean I hadn't carried in\nsix years, and fronted them squarely, hoping I could face down the\nprospect of a roughhouse. They wouldn't kill me, this close to the HQ,\nbut at least I was in for an unpleasant mauling. I couldn't handle three\nmen; and if nerves were this taut in the Kharsa, I might get knifed.\nQuite by accident, of course.\n\nThe _chaks_ moaned and gibbered. The Dry-towners glared at me and I\ntensed for the moment when their steady stare would explode into\nviolence.\n\nThen I became aware that they were gazing, not at me, but at something\nor someone behind me. The skeans snicked back into the clasps of their\ncloaks.\n\nThen they broke rank, turned and ran. They _ran_, blundering into\nstools, leaving havoc of upset benches and broken crockery in their\nwake. One man barged into the counter, swore and ran on, limping. I let\nmy breath go. Something had put the fear of God into those brutes, and\nit wasn't my own ugly mug. I turned and saw the girl.\n\nShe was slight, with waving hair like spun black glass, circled with\nfaint tracery of stars. A black glass belt bound her narrow waist like\nclasped hands, and her robe, stark white, bore an ugly embroidery across\nthe breasts, the flat sprawl of a conventionalized Toad God, Nebran. Her\nfeatures were delicate, chiseled, pale; a Dry-town face, all human, all\nwoman, but set in an alien and unearthly repose. The great eyes gleamed\nred. They were fixed, almost unseeing, but the crimson lips were curved\nwith inhuman malice.\n\nShe stood motionless, looking at me as if wondering why I had not run\nwith the others. In half a second, the smile flickered off and was\nreplaced by a startled look of--recognition?\n\nWhoever and whatever she was, she had saved me a mauling. I started to\nphrase formal thanks, then broke off in astonishment. The cafe had\nemptied and we were entirely alone. Even the _chaks_ had leaped through\nan open window--I saw the whisk of a disappearing tail.\n\nWe stood frozen, looking at one another while the Toad God sprawled\nacross her breasts rose and fell for half a dozen breaths.\n\nThen I took one step forward, and she took one step backward, at the\nsame instant. In one swift movement she was outside in the dark street.\nIt took me only an instant to get into the street after her, but as I\nstepped across the door there was a little stirring in the air, like the\nrising of heat waves across the salt flats at noon. Then the\nstreet-shrine was empty, and nowhere was there any sign of the girl. She\nhad vanished. She simply was not there.\n\nI gaped at the empty shrine. She had stepped inside and vanished, like a\nwraith of smoke, like--\n\n--Like the little toy-seller they had hunted out of the Kharsa.\n\nThere were eyes in the street again and, becoming aware of where I was,\nI moved away. The shrines of Nebran are on every corner of Wolf, but\nthis is one instance when familiarity does not breed contempt. The\nstreet was dark and seemed empty, but it was packed with all the little\nnoises of living. I was not unobserved. And meddling with a\nstreet-shrine would be just as dangerous as the skeans of my three\nloud-mouthed Dry-town roughnecks.\n\nI turned and crossed the square for the last time, turning toward the\nloom of the spaceship, filing the girl away as just another riddle of\nWolf I'd never solve.\n\nHow wrong I was!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THREE\n\n\nFrom the spaceport gates, exchanging brief greetings with the guards, I\ntook a last look at the Kharsa. For a minute I toyed with the notion of\njust disappearing down one of those streets. It's not hard to disappear\non Wolf, if you know how. And I knew, or had known once. Loyalty to\nTerra? What had Terra given me except a taste of color and adventure,\nout there in the Dry-towns, and then taken it away again?\n\nIf an Earthman is very lucky and very careful, he lasts about ten years\nin Intelligence. I had had two years more than my share. I still knew\nenough to leave my Terran identity behind like a worn-out jacket. I\ncould seek out Rakhal, settle our blood-feud, see Juli again....\n\nHow could I see Juli again? As her husband's murderer? No other way.\nBlood-feud on Wolf is a terrible and elaborate ritual of the code\nduello. And once I stepped outside the borders of Terran law, sooner or\nlater Rakhal and I would meet. And one of us would die.\n\nI looked back, just once, at the dark rambling streets away from the\nsquare. Then I turned toward the blue-white lights that hurt my eyes,\nand the starship that loomed, huge and hateful, before me.\n\nA steward in white took my fingerprint and led me to a coffin-sized\nchamber. He brought me coffee and sandwiches--I hadn't, after all, eaten\nin the spaceport cafe--then got me into the skyhook and strapped me,\ndeftly and firmly, into the acceleration cushions, tugging at the\nGarensen belts until I ached all over. A long needle went into my\narm--the narcotic that would keep me safely drowsy all through the\nterrible tug of interstellar acceleration.\n\nDoors clanged, buzzers vibrated lower down in the ship, men tramped the\ncorridors calling to one another in the language of the spaceports. I\nunderstood one word in four. I shut my eyes, not caring. At the end of\nthe trip there would be another star, another world, another language.\nAnother life.\n\nI had spent all my adult life on Wolf. Juli had been a child under the\nred star. But it was a pair of wide crimson eyes and black hair combed\ninto ringlets like spun black glass that went down with me into the\nbottomless pit of sleep....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSomeone was shaking me.\n\n\"Ah, come on, Cargill. Wake up, man. Shake your boots!\"\n\nMy mouth, foul-tasting and stiff, fumbled at the shapes of words. \"Wha'\nhappened? Wha' y' want?\" My eyes throbbed. When I got them open I saw\ntwo men in black leathers bending over me. We were still inside gravity.\n\n\"Get out of the skyhook. You're coming with us.\"\n\n\"Wha'--\" Even through the layers of the sedative, that got to me. Only a\ncriminal, under interstellar law, can be removed from a passage-paid\nstarship once he has formally checked in on board. I was legally, at\nthis moment, on my \"planet of destination.\"\n\n\"I haven't been charged--\"\n\n\"Did I say you had?\" snapped one man.\n\n\"Shut up, he's doped,\" the other said hurriedly. \"Look,\" he continued,\npronouncing every word loudly and distinctly, \"get up now, and come with\nus. The co-ordinator will hold up blastoff if we don't get off in three\nminutes, and Operations will scream. Come on, please.\"\n\nThen I was stumbling along the lighted, empty corridor, swaying between\nthe two men, foggily realizing the crew must think me a fugitive caught\ntrying to leave the planet.\n\nThe locks dilated. A uniformed spaceman watched us, fussily regarding a\nchronometer. He fretted. \"The dispatcher's office--\"\n\n\"We're doing the best we can,\" the Spaceforce man said. \"Can you walk,\nCargill?\"\n\nI could, though my feet were a little shaky on the ladders. The violet\nmoonlight had deepened to mauve, and gusty winds spun tendrils of grit\nacross my face. The Spaceforce men shepherded me, one on either side, to\nthe gateway.\n\n\"What the hell is all this? Is something wrong with my pass?\"\n\nThe guard shook his head. \"How would I know? Magnusson put out the\norder, take it up with him.\"\n\n\"Believe me,\" I muttered, \"I will.\"\n\nThey looked at each other. \"Hell,\" said one, \"he's not under arrest, we\ndon't have to haul him around like a convict. Can you walk all right\nnow, Cargill? You know where the Secret Service office is, don't you?\nFloor 38. The Chief wants you, and make it fast.\"\n\nI knew it made no sense to ask questions, they obviously knew no more\nthan I did. I asked anyhow.\n\n\"Are they holding the ship for me? I'm supposed to be leaving on it.\"\n\n\"Not that one,\" the guard answered, jerking his head toward the\nspaceport. I looked back just in time to see the dust-dimmed ship leap\nupward, briefly whitened in the field searchlights, and vanish into the\nsurging clouds above.\n\nMy head was clearing fast, and anger speeded up the process. The HQ\nbuilding was empty in the chill silence of just before dawn. I had to\nrout out a dozing elevator operator, and as the lift swooped upward my\nanger rose with it. I wasn't working for Magnusson any more. What right\nhad he, or anybody, to grab me off an outbound starship like a criminal?\nBy the time I barged into his office, I was spoiling for a fight.\n\nThe Secret Service office was full of grayish-pink morning and yellow\nlights left on from the night before. Magnusson, at his desk, looked as\nif he'd slept in his rumpled uniform. He was a big bull of a man, and\nhis littered desk looked, as always, like the track of a typhoon in the\nsalt flats.\n\nThe clutter was weighted down, here and there, with solidopic cubes of\nthe five Magnusson youngsters, and as usual, Magnusson was fiddling with\none of the cubes. He said, not looking up, \"Sorry to pull this at the\nlast minute, Race. There was just time to put out a pull order and get\nyou off the ship, but no time to explain.\"\n\nI glared at him. \"Seems I can't even get off the planet without trouble!\nYou raised hell all the time I was here, but when I try to leave--what\nis this, anyhow? I'm sick of being shoved around!\"\n\nMagnusson made a conciliating gesture. \"Wait until you hear--\" he began,\nand broke off, looking at someone who was sitting in the chair in front\nof his desk, somebody whose back was turned to me. Then the person\ntwisted and I stopped cold, blinking and wondering if this were a\nhallucination and I'd wake up in the starship's skyhook, far out in\nspace.\n\nThen the woman cried, \"Race, _Race_! Don't you know me?\"\n\nI took one dazed step and another. Then she flew across the space\nbetween us, her thin arms tangling around my neck, and I caught her up,\nstill disbelieving.\n\n\"_Juli!_\"\n\n\"Oh, Race, I thought I'd die when Mack told me you were leaving tonight.\nIt's been the only thing that's kept me alive, knowing--knowing I'd see\nyou.\" She sobbed and laughed, her face buried in my shoulder.\n\nI let her cry for a minute, then held my sister at arm's length. For a\nmoment I had forgotten the six years that lay between us. Now I saw\nthem, all of them, printed plain on her face. Juli had been a pretty\ngirl. Six years had fined her face into beauty, but there was tension in\nthe set of her shoulders, and her gray eyes had looked on horrors.\n\nShe looked tiny and thin and unbearably frail under the scanty folds of\nher fur robe, a Dry-town woman's robe. Her wrists were manacled, the\njeweled tight bracelets fastened together by the links of a long fine\nchain of silvered gilt that clashed a little, thinly, as her hands fell\nto her sides.\n\n\"What's wrong, Juli? Where's Rakhal?\"\n\nShe shivered and now I could see that she was in a state of shock.\n\n\"Gone. He's gone, that's all I know. And--oh, Race, Race, he took Rindy\nwith him!\"\n\nFrom the tone of her voice I had thought she was sobbing. Now I realized\nthat her eyes were dry; she was long past tears. Gently I unclasped her\nclenched fingers and put her back in the chair. She sat like a doll, her\nhands falling to her sides with a thin clash of chains. When I picked\nthem up and laid them in her lap she let them lie there motionless. I\nstood over her and demanded, \"Who's Rindy?\" She didn't move.\n\n\"My daughter, Race. Our little girl.\"\n\nMagnusson broke in, his voice harsh. \"Well, Cargill, should I have let\nyou leave?\"\n\n\"Don't be a damn fool!\"\n\n\"I was afraid you'd tell the poor kid she had to live with her own\nmistakes,\" growled Magnusson. \"You're capable of it.\"\n\nFor the first time Juli showed a sign of animation. \"I was afraid to\ncome to you, Mack. You never wanted me to marry Rakhal, either.\"\n\n\"Water under the bridge,\" Magnusson grunted. \"And I've got lads of my\nown, Miss Cargill--Mrs.--\" he stopped in distress, vaguely remembering\nthat in the Dry-towns an improper form of address can be a deadly\ninsult.\n\nBut she guessed his predicament.\n\n\"You used to call me Juli, Mack. It will do now.\"\n\n\"You've changed,\" he said quietly. \"Juli, then. Tell Race what you told\nme. All of it.\"\n\nShe turned to me. \"I shouldn't have come for myself--\"\n\nI knew that. Juli was proud, and she had always had the courage to live\nwith her own mistakes. When I first saw her, I knew this wouldn't be\nanything so simple as the complaint of an abused wife or even an\nabandoned or deserted mother. I took a chair, watching her and\nlistening.\n\nShe began. \"You made a mistake when you turned Rakhal out of the\nService, Mack. In his way he was the most loyal man you had on Wolf.\"\n\nMagnusson had evidently not expected her to take this tack. He scowled\nand looked disconcerted, shifting uneasily in his big chair, but when\nJuli did not continue, obviously awaiting his answer, he said, \"Juli, he\nleft me no choice. I never knew how his mind worked. That final deal he\nengineered--have you any idea how much that cost the Service? And have\nyou taken a good look at your brother's face, Juli girl?\"\n\nJuli raised her eyes slowly, and I saw her flinch. I knew how she felt.\nFor three years I had kept my mirror covered, growing an untidy\nstraggle of beard because it hid the scars and saved me the ordeal of\nfacing myself to shave.\n\nJuli whispered, \"Rakhal's is just as bad. Worse.\"\n\n\"That's some satisfaction,\" I said, and Mack stared at us, baffled.\n\"Even now I don't know what it was all about.\"\n\n\"And you never will,\" I said for the hundredth time. \"We've been over\nthis before. Nobody could understand it unless he'd lived in the\nDry-towns. Let's not talk about it. You talk, Juli. What brought you\nhere like this? What about the kid?\"\n\n\"There's no way I can tell you the end without telling you the\nbeginning,\" she said reasonably. \"At first Rakhal worked as a trader in\nShainsa.\"\n\nI wasn't surprised. The Dry-towns were the core of Terran trade on Wolf,\nand it was through their cooperation that Terra existed here peaceably,\non a world only half human, or less.\n\nThe men of the Dry-towns existed strangely poised between two worlds.\nThey had made dealings with the first Terran ships, and thus gave\nentrance to the wedge of the Terran Empire. And yet they stood proud and\napart. They alone had never yielded to the Terranizing which overtakes\nall Empire planets sooner or later.\n\nThere were no Trade Cities in the Dry-towns; an Earthman who went there\nunprotected faced a thousand deaths, each one worse than the last. There\nwere those who said that the men of Shainsa and Daillon and Ardcarran\nhad sold the rest of Wolf to the Terrans, to keep the Terrans from their\nown door.\n\nEven Rakhal, who had worked with Terra since boyhood, had finally come\nto a point of decision and gone his own way. And it was not Terra's way.\n\nThat was what Juli was saying now.\n\n\"He didn't like what Terra was doing on Wolf. I'm not so sure I like it\nmyself--\"\n\nMagnusson interrupted her again. \"Do you know what Wolf was like when we\ncame here? Have you seen the Slave Colony, the Idiot's Village? Your own\nbrother went to Shainsa and routed out The Lisse.\"\n\n\"And Rakhal helped him!\" Juli reminded him. \"Even after he left you, he\ntried to keep out of things. He could have told them a good deal that\nwould hurt you, after ten years in Intelligence, you know.\"\n\nI knew. It was, although I wasn't going to tell Juli this, one reason\nwhy, at the end--during that terrible explosion of violence which no\nnormal Terran mind could comprehend--I had done my best to kill him. We\nhad both known that after this, the planet would not hold the two of us.\nWe could both go on living only by dividing it unevenly. I had been\ngiven the slow death of the Terran Zone. And he had all the rest.\n\n\"But he never told them anything! I tell you, he was one of the most\nloyal--\"\n\nMack grunted, \"Yeah, he's an angel. Go ahead.\"\n\nShe didn't, not immediately. Instead she asked what sounded like an\nirrelevant question. \"Is it true what he told me? That the Empire has a\nstanding offer of a reward for a working model of a matter transmitter?\"\n\n\"That offer's been standing for three hundred years, Terran reckoning.\nOne million credits cash. Don't tell me he was figuring to invent one?\"\n\n\"I don't think so. But I think he heard rumors about one. He said with\nthat kind of money he could bargain the Terrans right out of Shainsa.\nThat was where it started. He began coming and going at odd times, but\nhe never said any more about it. He wouldn't talk to me at all.\"\n\n\"When was all this?\"\n\n\"About four months ago.\"\n\n\"In other words, just about the time of the riots in Charin.\"\n\nShe nodded. \"Yes. He was away in Charin when the Ghost Wind blew, and he\ncame back with knife cuts in his thigh. I asked if he had been mixed-up\nin the anti-Terran rioting, but he wouldn't tell me. Race, I don't know\nanything about politics. I don't really care. But just about that time,\nthe Great House in Shainsa changed hands. I'm sure Rakhal had something\nto do with that.\n\n\"And then--\" Juli twisted her chained hands together in her lap--\"he\ntried to mix Rindy up in it. It was crazy, awful! He'd brought her some\nsort of nonhuman toy from one of the lowland towns, Charin I think. It\nwas a weird thing, scared me. But he'd sit Rindy down in the sunlight\nand have her look into it, and Rindy would gabble all sorts of nonsense\nabout little men and birds and a toymaker.\"\n\nThe chains about Juli's wrists clashed as she twisted her hands\ntogether. I stared somberly at the fetters. The chain, which was long,\ndid not really hamper her movements much. Such chains were symbolic\nornaments, and most Dry-town women went all their lives with fettered\nhands. But even after the years I'd spent in the Dry-towns, the sight\nstill brought an uneasiness to my throat, a vague discomfort.\n\n\"We had a terrible fight over that,\" Juli went on. \"I was afraid, afraid\nof what it was doing to Rindy. I threw it out, and Rindy woke up and\nscreamed--\" Juli checked herself and caught at vanishing self-control.\n\n\"But you don't want to hear about that. It was then I threatened to\nleave him and take Rindy. The next day--\" Suddenly the hysteria Juli had\nbeen forcing back broke free, and she rocked back and forth in her\nchair, shaken and strangled with sobs. \"He took Rindy! Oh, Race, he's\ncrazy, crazy. I think he hates Rindy, he--he, Race, _he smashed her\ntoys_. He took every toy the child had and broke them one by one,\nsmashed them into powder, every toy the child had--\"\n\n\"Juli, please, please,\" Magnusson pleaded, shaken. \"If we're dealing\nwith a maniac--\"\n\n\"I don't dare think he'd harm her! He warned me not to come here, or I'd\nnever see her again, but if it meant war against Terra I had to come.\nBut Mack, please, don't do anything against him, please, please. He's\ngot my baby, he's got my little girl....\" Her voice failed and she\nburied her face in her hands.\n\nMack picked up the solidopic cube of his five-year-old son, and turned\nit between his pudgy fingers, saying unhappily, \"Juli, we'll take every\nprecaution. But can't you see, we've got to get him? If there's a\nquestion of a matter transmitter, or anything like that, in the hands of\nTerra's enemies--\"\n\nI could see that, too, but Juli's agonized face came between me and the\npicture of disaster. I clenched my fist around the chair arm, not\nsurprised to see the fragile plastic buckle, crack and split under my\ngrip. _If it had been Rakhal's neck...._\n\n\"Mack, let me handle this. Juli, shall I find Rindy for you?\"\n\nA hope was born in her ravaged face, and died, while I looked. \"Race,\nhe'd kill you. Or have you killed.\"\n\n\"He'd try,\" I admitted. The moment Rakhal knew I was outside the Terran\nzone, I'd walk with death. I had accepted the code during my years in\nShainsa. But now I was an Earthman and felt only contempt.\n\n\"Can't you see? Once he knows I'm at large, that very code of his will\nforce him to abandon any intrigue, whatever you call it, conspiracy, and\ncome after me first. That way we do two things: we get him out of\nhiding, and we get him out of the conspiracy, if there is one.\"\n\nI looked at the shaking Juli and something snapped. I stooped and lifted\nher, not gently, my hands biting her shoulders. \"And I won't kill him,\ndo you hear? He may wish I had; by the time I get through with him--I'll\nbeat the living hell out of him; I'll cram my fists down his throat. But\nI'll settle it with him like an Earthman. I won't kill him. _Hear me,\nJuli?_ Because that's the worst thing I could do to him--catch him and\nlet him live afterward!\"\n\nMagnusson stepped toward me and pried my crushing hands off her arms.\nJuli rubbed the bruises mechanically, not knowing she was doing it. Mack\nsaid, \"You can't do it, Cargill. You wouldn't get as far as Daillon. You\nhaven't been out of the zone in six years. Besides--\"\n\nHis eyes rested full on my face. \"I hate to say this, Race, but damn it,\nman, go and take a good look at yourself in a mirror. Do you think I'd\never have pulled you off the Secret Service otherwise? How in hell can\nyou disguise yourself now?\"\n\n\"There are plenty of scarred men in the Dry-towns,\" I said. \"Rakhal will\nremember my scars, but I don't think anyone else would look twice.\"\n\nMagnusson walked to the window. His huge form bulked against the light,\nperceptibly darkening the office. He looked over the faraway panorama,\nthe neat bright Trade City below and the vast wilderness lying outside.\nI could almost hear the wheels grinding in his head. Finally he swung\naround.\n\n\"Race, I've heard these rumors before. But you're the only man I could\nhave sent to track them down, and I wouldn't send you out in cold blood\nto be killed. I won't now. Spaceforce will pick him up.\"\n\nI heard the harsh inward gasp of Juli's breath and said, \"Damn it, no.\nThe first move you make--\" I couldn't finish. Rindy was in his hands,\nand when I knew Rakhal, he hadn't been given to making idle threats. We\nall three knew what Rakhal might do at the first hint of the long arm of\nTerran law reaching out for him.\n\nI said, \"For God's sake let's keep Spaceforce out of it. Let it look\nlike a personal matter between Rakhal and me, and let us settle it on\nthose terms. Remember he's got the kid.\"\n\nMagnusson sighed. Again he picked up one of the cubes and stared into\nthe clear plastic, where the three-dimensional image of a nine-year-old\ngirl looked out at him, smiling and innocent. His face was transparent\nas the plastic cube. Mack acts tough, but he has five kids and he is as\nsoft as a dish of pudding where a kid is concerned.\n\n\"I know. Another thing, too. If we send out Spaceforce, after all the\nriots--how many Terrans are on this planet? A few thousand, no more.\nWhat chance would we have, if it turned into a full-scale rebellion?\nNone at all, unless we wanted to order a massacre. Sure, we have bombs\nand dis-guns and all that.\n\n\"But would we dare to use them? And where would we be after that? We're\nhere to keep the pot from boiling over, to keep out of planetary\nincidents, not push them along to a point where bluff won't work. That's\nwhy we've got to pick up Rakhal before this gets out of hand.\"\n\nI said, \"Give me a month. Then you can move in, if you have to. Rakhal\ncan't do much against Terra in that time. And I might be able to keep\nRindy out of it.\"\n\nMagnusson stared at me, hard-eyed. \"If you do this against my advice, I\nwon't be able to step in and pull you out of a jam later on, you know.\nAnd God help you if you start up the machines and can't stop them.\"\n\nI knew that. A month wasn't much. Wolf is forty thousand miles of\ndiameter, at least half unexplored; mountain and forest swarming with\nnonhuman and semi-human cities where Terrans had never been.\n\nFinding Rakhal, or any one man, would be like picking out one star in\nthe Andromeda nebula. Not impossible. Not _quite_ impossible.\n\nMack's eyes wandered again to his child's face, deep in the transparent\ncube. He turned it in his hands. \"Okay, Cargill,\" he said slowly, \"so\nwe're all crazy. I'll be crazy too. Try it your way.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FOUR\n\n\nBy sunset I was ready to leave. I hadn't had any loose ends to tie up in\nthe Trade City, since I'd already disposed of most of my gear before\nboarding the starship. I'd never been in better circumstances to take\noff for parts unknown.\n\nMack, still disapproving, had opened the files to me, and I'd spent most\nof the day in the back rooms of Floor 38, searching Intelligence files\nto refresh my memory, scanning the pages of my own old reports sent\nyears ago from Shainsa and Daillon. He had sent out one of the nonhumans\nwho worked for us, to buy or acquire somewhere in the Old Town a\nDry-towner's outfit and the other things I would wear and carry.\n\nI would have liked to go myself. I felt that I needed the practice. I\nwas only now beginning to realize how much I might have forgotten in the\nyears behind a desk. But until I was ready to make my presence known, no\none must know that Race Cargill had not left Wolf on the starship.\n\nAbove all, I must not be seen in the Kharsa until I went there in the\nDry-town disguise which had become, years ago, a deep second nature,\nalmost an alternate personality.\n\nAbout sunset I walked through the clean little streets of the Terran\nTrade City toward the Magnusson home where Juli was waiting for me.\n\nMost of the men who go into Civil Service of the Empire come from Earth,\nor from the close-in planets of Proxima and Alpha Centaurus. They go out\nunmarried, and they stay that way, or marry women native to the planets\nwhere they are sent.\n\nBut Joanna Magnusson was one of the rare Earth women who had come out\nwith her husband, twenty years ago. There are two kinds of Earthwomen\nlike that. They make their quarterings a little bit of home, or a little\nbit of hell. Joanna had made their house look like a transported corner\nof Earth.\n\nI never knew quite what to think of the Magnusson household. It seemed\nto me almost madness to live under a red sun, yet come inside to yellow\nlight, to live on a world with the wild beauty of Wolf and yet live as\nthey might have lived on their home planet. Or maybe I was the one who\nwas out of step. I had done the reprehensible thing they called \"going\nnative.\" Possibly I had done just that, and in absorbing myself into the\nnew world, had lost the ability to fit into the old.\n\nJoanna, a chubby comfortable woman in her forties, opened the door and\ngave me her hand. \"Come in, Race. Juli's expecting you.\"\n\n\"It's good of you.\" I broke off, unable to express my gratitude. Juli\nand I had come from Earth--our father had been an officer on the old\nstarship _Landfall_ when Juli was only a child. He had died in a wreck\noff Procyon, and Mack Magnusson had found me a place in Intelligence\nbecause I spoke four of the Wolf languages and haunted the Kharsa with\nRakhal whenever I could get away.\n\nThey had also taken Juli into their own home, like a younger sister.\nThey hadn't said much--because they had liked Rakhal--when the breakup\ncame. But that terrible night when Rakhal and I nearly killed each\nother, and Rakhal came with his face bleeding and took Juli away with\nhim, had hurt them hard. Yet it had made them all the kinder to me.\n\nJoanna said forthrightly, \"Nonsense, Race! What else could we do?\" She\ndrew me along the hall. \"You can talk in here.\"\n\nI delayed a minute before going through the door she indicated. \"How is\nJuli?\"\n\n\"Better, I think. I put her to bed in Meta's room, and she slept most of\nthe day. She'll be all right. I'll leave you to talk.\" Joanna opened the\ndoor, and went away.\n\nJuli was awake and dressed, and already some of the terrible frozen\nhorror was gone from her face. She was still tense and devil-ridden, but\nnot hysterical now.\n\nThe room, one of the children's bedrooms, wasn't a big one. Even at the\ntop of the Secret Service, a cop doesn't live too well. Not on Terra's\nCivil Service pay scale. Not, with five youngsters. It looked as if all\nfive of the kids had taken it to pieces, one at a time.\n\nI sat down on a too-low chair and said, \"Juli, we haven't much time,\nI've got to be out of the city before dark. I want to know about Rakhal,\nwhat he does, what he's like now. Remember, I haven't seen him for\nyears. Tell me everything--his friends, his amusements, everything you\nknow.\"\n\n\"I always thought you knew him better than I did.\" Juli had a fidgety\nlittle way of coiling the links of the chain around her wrists and it\nmade me nervous.\n\n\"It's routine, Juli. Police work. Mostly I play by ear, but I try to\nstart out by being methodical.\"\n\nShe answered everything I asked her, but the sum total wasn't much and\nit wouldn't help much. As I said, it's easy to disappear on Wolf. Juli\nknew he had been friendly with the new holders of the Great House on\nShainsa, but she didn't even know their name.\n\nI heard one of the Magnusson children fly to the street door and return,\nshouting for her mother. Joanna knocked at the door of the room and came\nin.\n\n\"There's a _chak_ outside who wants to see you, Race.\"\n\nI nodded. \"Probably my fancy dress. Can I change in the back room,\nJoanna? Will you keep my clothes here till I get back?\"\n\nI went to the door and spoke to the furred nonhuman in the sibilant\njargon of the Kharsa and he handed me what looked like a bundle of rags.\nThere were hard lumps inside. The _chak_ said softly, \"I hear a rumor in\nthe Kharsa, _Raiss_. Perhaps it will help you. Three men from Shainsa\nare in the city. They came here to seek a woman who has vanished, and a\ntoymaker. They are returning at sunrise. Perhaps you can arrange to\ntravel in their caravan.\"\n\nI thanked him and carried the bundle inside. In the empty back room I\nstripped to the skin and unrolled the bundle. There was a pair of baggy\nstriped breeches, a worn and shabby shirtcloak with capacious pockets, a\nlooped belt with half the gilt rubbed away and the base metal showing\nthrough, and a scuffed pair of ankle-boots tied with frayed thongs of\ndifferent colors. There was a little cluster of amulets and seals. I\nchose two or three of the commonest kind, and strung them around my\nneck.\n\nOne of the lumps in the bundle was a small jar, holding nothing but the\nordinary spices sold in the market, with which the average Dry-towner\nflavors food. I rubbed some of the powder on my body, put a pinch in the\npocket of my shirtcloak, and chewed a few of the buds, wrinkling my nose\nat the long-unfamiliar pungency.\n\nThe second lump was a skean, and unlike the worn and shabby garments,\nthis was brand-new and sharp and bright, and its edge held a razor\nglint. I tucked it into the clasp of my shirtcloak, a reassuring weight.\nIt was the only weapon I could dare to carry.\n\nThe last of the solid objects in the bundle was a flat wooden case,\nabout nine by ten inches. I slid it open. It was divided carefully into\nsections cushioned with sponge-absorbent plastic, and in them lay tiny\nslips of glass, on Wolf as precious as jewels. They were lenses--camera\nlenses, microscope lenses, even eyeglass lenses. Packed close, there\nwere nearly a hundred of them nested by the shock-absorbent stuff.\n\nThey were my excuse for travel to Shainsa. Over and above the\nnecessities of trade, a few items of Terran manufacture--vacuum tubes,\ntransistors, lenses for cameras and binoculars, liquors and finely\nforged small tools--are literally worth their weight in platinum.\n\nEven in cities where Terrans have never gone, these things bring\nexorbitant prices, and trading in them is a Dry-town privilege. Rakhal\nhad been a trader, so Juli told me, in fine wire and surgical\ninstruments. Wolf is not a mechanized planet, and has never developed\nany indigenous industrial system; the psychology of the nonhuman seldom\nruns to technological advances.\n\nI went down the hallway again to the room where Juli was waiting.\nCatching a glimpse in a full-length mirror, I was startled. All traces\nof the Terran civil servant, clumsy and uncomfortable in his ill-fitting\nclothes, had dropped away. A Dry-towner, rangy and scarred, looked out\nat me, and it seemed that the expression on his face was one of\namazement.\n\nJoanna whirled as I came into the room and visibly paled before,\nrecovering her self-control, she gave a nervous little giggle.\n\"Goodness, Race, I didn't know you!\"\n\nJuli whispered, \"Yes, I--I remember you better like that. You're--you\nlook so much like--\"\n\nThe door flew open and Mickey Magnusson scampered into the room, a\nchubby little boy browned by a Terra-type sunlamp and glowing with\nhealth. In his hand he held some sparkling thing that gave off tiny\nflashes and glints of color.\n\nI gave the kid a grin before I realized that I was disguised anyhow and\nprobably a hideous sight. The little boy backed off, but Joanna put her\nplump hand on his shoulder, murmuring soothing things.\n\nMickey toddled toward Juli, holding up the shining thing in his hands as\nif to display something very precious and beloved. Juli bent and held\nout her arms, then her face contracted and she snatched at the\nplaything.\n\n\"Mickey, what's that?\"\n\nHe thrust it protectively behind his back. \"Mine!\"\n\n\"Mickey, don't be naughty,\" Joanna chided.\n\n\"Please let me see,\" Juli coaxed, and he brought it out, slowly, still\nsuspicious. It was an angled prism of crystal, star-shaped, set in a\nframe which could get the star spinning like a solidopic. But it\ndisplayed a new and comical face every time it was turned.\n\nMickey turned it round and round, charmed at being the center of\nattention. There seemed to be dozens of faces, shifting with each spin\nof the prism, human and nonhuman, all dim and slightly distorted. My own\nface, Juli's, Joanna's came out of the crystal surface, not a reflection\nbut a caricature.\n\nA choked sound from Juli made me turn in dismay. She had let herself\ndrop to the floor and was sitting there, white as death, supporting\nherself with her two hands.\n\n\"Race! Find out where he got that--that _thing_!\"\n\nI bent and shook her. \"What's the matter with you?\" I demanded. She had\nlapsed into the dazed, sleepwalking horror of this morning. She\nwhispered, \"It's not a toy. Rindy had one. Joanna, _where did he get\nit_?\" She pointed at the shining thing with an expression of horror\nwhich would have been laughable had it been less real, less filled with\nterror.\n\nJoanna cocked her head to one side and wrinkled her forehead,\nreflectively. \"Why, I don't know, now you come to ask me. I thought\nmaybe one of the _chaks_ had given it to Mickey. Bought it in the\nbazaar, maybe. He loves it. Do get up off the floor, Juli!\"\n\nJuli scrambled to her feet. She said, \"Rindy had one. It--it terrified\nme. She would sit and look at it by the hour, and--I told you about it,\nRace. I threw it out once, and she woke up and screamed. She shrieked\nfor hours and hours and she ran out in the dark and dug for it in the\ntrash pile, where I'd buried it. She went out in the dark, broke all her\nfingernails, but she dug it out again.\" She checked herself, staring at\nJoanna, her eyes wide in appeal.\n\n\"Well, dear,\" said Joanna with mild, rebuking kindness, \"you needn't be\nso upset. I don't think Mickey's so attached to it as all that, and\nanyhow I'm not going to throw it away.\" She patted Juli reassuringly on\nthe shoulder, then gave Mickey a little shove toward the door and turned\nto follow him. \"You'll want to talk alone before Race leaves. Good luck,\nwherever you're going, Race.\" She held out her hand forthrightly.\n\n\"And don't worry about Juli,\" she added in an undertone. \"We'll take\ngood care of her.\"\n\nWhen I came back to Juli she was standing by the window, looking through\nthe oddly filtered glass that dimmed the red sun to orange. \"Joanna\nthinks I'm crazy, Race.\"\n\n\"She thinks you're upset.\"\n\n\"Rindy's an odd child, a real Dry-towner. But it's not my imagination,\nRace, it's not. There's something--\" Suddenly she sobbed aloud again.\n\n\"Homesick, Juli?\"\n\n\"I was, a little, the first years. But I was happy, believe me.\" She\nturned her face to me, shining with tears. \"You've got to believe I\nnever regretted it for a minute.\"\n\n\"I'm glad,\" I said dully. _That made it just fine._\n\n\"Only that toy--\"\n\n\"Who knows? It might be a clue to something.\" The toy had reminded me of\nsomething, too, and I tried to remember what it was. I'd seen nonhuman\ntoys in the Kharsa, even bought them for Mack's kids. When a single man\nis invited frequently to a home with five youngsters, it's about the\nonly way he can repay that hospitality, by bringing the children odd\ntrifles and knicknacks. But I had never seen anything quite like this\none, until--\n\n--Until yesterday. The toy-seller they had hunted out of the Kharsa, the\none who had fled into the shrine of Nebran and vanished. He had had half\na dozen of those prism-and-star sparklers.\n\nI tried to call up a mental picture of the little toy-seller. I didn't\nhave much luck. I'd seen him only in that one swift glance from beneath\nhis hood. \"Juli, have you ever seen a little man, like a _chak_ only\nsmaller, twisted, hunchbacked? He sells toys--\"\n\nShe looked blank. \"I don't think so, although there are dwarf _chaks_ in\nthe Polar Cities. But I'm sure I've never seen one.\"\n\n\"It was just an idea.\" But it was something to think about. A toy-seller\nhad vanished. Rakhal, before disappearing, had smashed all Rindy's toys.\nAnd the sight of a plaything of cunningly-cut crystal had sent Juli into\nhysterics.\n\n\"I'd better go before it's too dark,\" I said. I buckled the final clasp\nof my shirtcloak, fitted my skean another notch into it, and counted the\nmoney Mack had advanced me for expenses. \"I want to get into the Kharsa\nand hunt up the caravan to Shainsa.\"\n\n\"You're going there first?\"\n\n\"Where else?\"\n\nJuli turned, leaning one hand against the wall. She looked frail and\nill, years older than she was. Suddenly she flung her thin arms around\nme, and a link of the chain on her fettered hands struck me hard, as she\ncried out, \"Race, Race, he'll kill you! How can I live with that on my\nconscience too?\"\n\n\"You can live with a hell of a lot on your conscience.\" I disengaged her\narms firmly from my neck. A link of the chain caught on the clasp of my\nshirtcloak, and again something snapped inside me. I grasped the chain\nin my two hands and gave a mighty heave, bracing my foot against the\nwall. The links snapped asunder. A flying end struck Juli under the eye.\nI ripped at the seals of the jeweled cuffs, tore them from her arms,\nfind threw the whole assembly into a corner, where it fell with a\nclash.\n\n\"Damn it,\" I roared, \"that's over! You're never going to wear _those_\nthings again!\" Maybe after six years in the Dry-towns, Juli was\nbeginning to guess what those six years behind a desk had meant to me.\n\n\"Juli, I'll find your Rindy for you, and I'll bring Rakhal in alive. But\ndon't ask more than that. Just _alive_. And don't ask me how.\"\n\nHe'd be alive when I got through with him. Sure, he'd be alive.\n\nJust.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FIVE\n\n\nIt was getting dark when I slipped through a side gate, shabby and\ninconspicuous, into the spaceport square. Beyond the yellow lamps, I\nknew that the old city was beginning to take on life with the falling\nnight. Out of the chinked pebble-houses, men and woman, human and\nnonhuman, came forth into the moonlit streets.\n\nIf anyone noticed me cross the square, which I doubted, they took me for\njust another Dry-town vagabond, curious about the world of the strangers\nfrom beyond the stars, and who, curiosity satisfied, was drifting back\nwhere he belonged. I turned down one of the dark alleys that led away,\nand soon was walking in the dark.\n\nThe Kharsa was not unfamiliar to me as a Terran, but for the last six\nyears I had seen only its daytime face. I doubted if there were a dozen\nEarthmen in the Old Town tonight, though I saw one in the bazaar, dirty\nand lurching drunk; one of those who run renegade and homeless between\nworlds, belonging to neither. This was what I had nearly become.\n\nI went further up the hill with the rising streets. Once I turned, and\nsaw below me the bright-lighted spaceport, the black many-windowed loom\nof the skyscraper like a patch of alien shadow in the red-violet\nmoonlight. I turned my back on them and walked on.\n\nAt the fringe of the thieves market I paused outside a wineshop where\nDry-towners were made welcome. A golden nonhuman child murmured\nsomething as she pattered by me in the street, and I stopped, gripped by\na spasm of stagefright. Had the dialect of Shainsa grown rusty on my\ntongue? Spies were given short shrift on Wolf, and a mile from the\nspaceport, I might as well have been on one of those moons. There were\nno spaceport shockers at my back now. And someone might remember the\ntale of an Earthman with a scarred face who had gone to Shainsa in\ndisguise....\n\nI shrugged the shirtcloak around my shoulders, pushed the door and went\nin. I had remembered that Rakhal was waiting for me. Not beyond this\ndoor, but at the end of the trail, behind some other door, somewhere.\nAnd we have a byword in Shainsa: _A trail without beginning has no end_.\n\nRight there I stopped thinking about Juli, Rindy, the Terran Empire, or\nwhat Rakhal, who knew too many of Terra's secrets, might do if he had\nturned renegade. My fingers went up and stroked, musingly, the ridge of\nscar tissue along my mouth. At that moment I was thinking only of\nRakhal, of an unsettled blood-feud, and of my revenge.\n\nRed lamps were burning inside the wineshop, where men reclined on frowsy\ncouches. I stumbled over one of them, found an empty place and let\nmyself sink down on it, arranging myself automatically in the sprawl of\nDry-towners indoors. In public they stood, rigid and formal, even to eat\nand drink. Among themselves, anything less than a loose-limbed sprawl\nbetrayed insulting watchfulness; only a man who fears secret murder\nkeeps himself on guard.\n\nA girl with a tangled rope of hair down her back came toward me. Her\nhands were unchained, meaning she was a woman of the lowest class, not\nworth safeguarding. Her fur smock was shabby and matted with filth. I\nsent her for wine. When it came it was surprisingly good, the sweet and\ntreacherous wine of Ardcarran. I sipped it slowly, looking round.\n\nIf a caravan for Shainsa were leaving tomorrow, it would be known here.\nA word dropped that I was returning there would bring me, by ironbound\ncustom, an invitation to travel in their company.\n\nWhen I sent the woman for wine a second time, a man on a nearby couch\ngot up, and walked over to me.\n\nHe was tall even for a Dry-towner, and there was something vaguely\nfamiliar about him. He was no riffraff of the Kharsa, either, for his\nshirtcloak was of rich silk interwoven with metallic threads, and\ncrusted with heavy embroideries. The hilt of his skean was carved from a\nsingle green gem. He stood looking down at me for some time before he\nspoke.\n\n\"I never forget a voice, although I cannot bring your face to mind. Have\nI a duty toward you?\"\n\nI had spoken a jargon to the girl, but he addressed me in the lilting,\nsing-song speech of Shainsa. I made no answer, gesturing him to be\nseated. On Wolf, formal courtesy requires a series of polite _non\nsequiturs_, and while a direct question merely borders on rudeness, a\ndirect answer is the mark of a simpleton.\n\n\"A drink?\"\n\n\"I joined you unasked,\" he retorted, and summoned the tangle-headed\ngirl. \"Bring us better wine than this swill!\"\n\nWith that word and gesture I recognized him and my teeth clamped hard on\nmy lip. This was the loudmouth who had shown fight in the spaceport\ncafe, and run away before the dark girl with the sign of Nebran sprawled\non her breast.\n\nBut in this poor light he had not recognized me. I moved deliberately\ninto the full red glow. If he did not know me for the Terran he had\nchallenged last night in the spaceport cafe, it was unlikely that anyone\nelse would. He stared at me for some minutes, but in the end he only\nshrugged and poured wine from the bottle he had ordered.\n\nThree drinks later I knew that his name was Kyral and that he was a\ntrader in wire and fine steel tools through the nonhuman towns. And I\nhad given him the name I had chosen, Rascar.\n\nHe asked, \"Are you thinking of returning to Shainsa?\"\n\nWary of a trap, I hesitated, but the question seemed harmless, so I only\ncountered, \"Have you been long in the Kharsa?\"\n\n\"Several weeks.\"\n\n\"Trading?\"\n\n\"No.\" He applied himself to the wine again. \"I was searching for a\nmember of my family.\"\n\n\"Did you find him?\"\n\n\"Her,\" said Kyral, and ceremoniously spat. \"No, I didn't find her. What\nis your business in Shainsa?\"\n\nI chuckled briefly. \"As a matter of fact, I am searching for a member of\nmy family.\"\n\nHe narrowed his eyelids as if he suspected me of mocking him, but\npersonal privacy is the most rigid convention of the Dry-towns and such\nmockery showed a sensible disregard for prying questions if I did not\nchoose to answer them. He questioned no further.\n\n\"I can use an extra man to handle the loads. Are you good with pack\nanimals? If so, you are welcome to travel under the protection of my\ncaravan.\"\n\nI agreed. Then, reflecting that Juli and Rakhal must, after all, be\nknown in Shainsa, I asked, \"Do you know a trader who calls himself\nSensar?\"\n\nHe started slightly; I saw his eyes move along my scars. Then reserve,\nlike a lowered curtain, shut itself over his face, concealing a brief\nsatisfied glimmer. \"No,\" he lied, and stood up.\n\n\"We leave at first daylight. Have your gear ready.\" He flipped something\nat me, and I caught it in midair. It was a stone incised with Kyral's\nname in the ideographs of Shainsa. \"You can sleep with the caravan if\nyou care to. Show that token to Cuinn.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKyral's caravan was encamped in a barred field past the furthest gates\nof the Kharsa. About a dozen men were busy loading the pack\nanimals--horses shipped in from Darkover, mostly. I asked the first man\nI met for Cuinn. He pointed out a burly fellow in a shiny red\nshirtcloak, who was busy at chewing out one of the young men for the way\nhe'd put a packsaddle on his beast.\n\nShainsa is a good language for cursing, but Cuinn had a special talent\nat it. I blinked in admiration while I waited for him to get his breath\nso I could hand him Kyral's token.\n\nIn the light of the fire I saw what I'd half expected: he was the second\nof the Dry-towners who'd tried to rough me up in the spaceport cafe.\nCuinn barely glanced at the cut stone and tossed it back, pointing out\none of the packhorses. \"Load your personal gear on that one, then get\nbusy and show this mush-headed wearer of sandals\"--an insult carrying\nparticularly filthy implications in Shainsa--\"how to fasten a\npackstrap.\"\n\nHe drew breath and began to swear at the luckless youngster again, and I\nrelaxed. He evidently hadn't recognized me, either. I took the strap in\nmy hand, guiding it through the saddle loop. \"Like that,\" I told the\nkid, and Cuinn stopped swearing long enough to give me a curt nod of\nacknowledgment and point out a heap of boxed and crated objects.\n\n\"Help him load up. We want to get clear of the city by daybreak,\" he\nordered, and went off to swear at someone else.\n\nKyral turned up at dawn, and a few minutes later the camp had vanished\ninto a small scattering of litter and we were on our way.\n\nKyral's caravan, in spite of Cuinn's cursing, was well-managed and\nwell-handled. The men were Dry-towners, eleven of them, silent and\ncapable and most of them very young. They were cheerful on the trail,\nhandled the pack animals competently, during the day, and spent most of\nthe nights grouped around the fire, gambling silently on the fall of the\ncut-crystal prisms they used for dice.\n\nThree days out of the Kharsa I began to worry about Cuinn.\n\nIt was of course a spectacular piece of bad luck to find all three of\nthe men from the spaceport cafe in Kyral's caravan. Kyral had obviously\nnot known me, and even by daylight he paid no attention to me except to\ngive an occasional order. The second of the three was a gangling kid who\nprobably never gave me a second look, let alone a third.\n\nBut Cuinn was another matter. He was a man my own age, and his fierce\neyes had a shrewdness in them that I did not trust. More than once I\ncaught him watching me, and on the two or three occasions when he drew\nme into conversation, I found his questions more direct than Dry-town\ngood manners allowed. I weighed the possibility that I might have to\nkill him before we reached Shainsa.\n\nWe crossed the foothills and began to climb upward toward the mountains.\nThe first few days I found myself short of breath as we worked upward\ninto thinner air, then my acclimatization returned and I began to fall\ninto the pattern of the days and nights on the trail. The Trade City\nwas still a beacon in the night, but its glow on the horizon grew dimmer\nwith each day's march.\n\nHigher we climbed, along dangerous trails where men had to dismount and\nlet the pack animals pick their way, foot by foot. Here in these\naltitudes the sun at noonday blazed redder and brighter, and the\nDry-towners, who come from the parched lands in the sea-bottoms, were\nburned and blistered by the fierce light. I had grown up under the\nblazing sun of Terra, and a red sun like Wolf, even at its hottest,\ncaused me no discomfort. This alone would have made me suspect. Once\nagain I found Cuinn's fierce eyes watching me.\n\nAs we crossed the passes and began to descend the long trail through the\nthick forests, we got into nonhuman country. Racing against the Ghost\nWind, we skirted the country around Charin, and the woods inhabited by\nthe terrible Ya-men, birdlike creatures who turn cannibal when the Ghost\nWind blows.\n\nLater the trail wound through thicker forests of indigo trees and\ngrayish-purple brushwood, and at night we heard the howls of the catmen\nof these latitudes. At night we set guards about the caravan, and the\ndark spaces and shadows were filled with noises and queer smells and\nrustlings.\n\nNevertheless, the day's marches and the night watches passed without\nevent until the night I shared guard with Cuinn. I had posted myself at\nthe edge of the camp, the fire behind me. The men were sleeping rolls of\nsnores, huddled close around the fire. The animals, hobbled with double\nropes, front feet to hind feet, shifted uneasily and let out long\nuncanny whines.\n\nI heard Cuinn pacing behind me. I heard a rustle at the edge of the\nforest, a stir and whisper beyond the trees, and turned to speak to him,\nthen saw him slipping away toward the outskirts of the clearing.\n\nFor a moment I thought nothing of it, thinking that he was taking a few\nsteps toward the gap in the trees where he had disappeared. I suppose I\nhad the idea that he had slipped away to investigate some noise or\nshadow, and that I should be at hand.\n\nThen I saw the flicker of lights beyond the trees--light from the\nlantern Cuinn had been carrying in his hand! He was signaling!\n\nI slipped the safety clasp from the hilt of my skean and went after him.\nIn the dimming glow of the fire I fancied I saw luminous eyes watching\nme, and the skin on my back crawled. I crept up behind him and leaped.\nWe went down in a tangle of flailing legs and arms, and in less than a\nsecond he had his skean out and I was gripping his wrist, trying\ndesperately to force the blade away from my throat.\n\nI gasped, \"Don't be a fool! One yell and the whole camp will be awake!\nWho were you signaling?\"\n\nIn the light of the fallen lantern, lips drawn back in a snarl, he\nlooked almost inhuman. He strained at the knife for a moment, then\ndropped it. \"Let me up,\" he said.\n\nI got up and kicked the fallen skean toward him. \"Put that away. What in\nhell were you doing, trying to bring the catmen down on us?\"\n\nFor a moment he looked taken aback, then his fierce face closed down\nagain and he said wrathfully, \"Can't a man walk away from the camp\nwithout being half strangled?\"\n\nI glared at him, but realized I really had nothing to go by. He might\nhave been answering a call of nature, and the movement of the lantern\naccidental. And if someone had jumped me from behind, I might have\npulled a knife on him myself. So I only said, \"Don't do it again. We're\nall too jumpy.\"\n\nThere were no other incidents that night, or the next. The night after,\nwhile I lay huddled in my shirtcloak and blanket by the fire, I saw\nCuinn slip out of his bedroll and steal away. A moment later there was a\ngleam in the darkness, but before I could summon the resolve to get up\nand face it out with him, he returned, looked cautiously at the snoring\nmen, and crawled back into his blankets.\n\nWhile we were unpacking at the next camp, Kyral halted beside me. \"Heard\nanything queer lately? I've got the notion we're being trailed. We'll be\nout of these forests tomorrow, and after that it's clear road all the\nway to Shainsa. If anything's going to happen, it will happen tonight.\"\n\nI debated speaking to him about Cuinn's signals. No, I had my own\nbusiness waiting for me in Shainsa. Why mix myself up in some other,\nprivate intrigue?\n\nHe said, \"I'm putting you and Cuinn on watch again. The old men doze\noff, and the young fellows get to daydreaming or fooling around. That's\nall right most of the time, but I want someone who'll keep his eyes open\ntonight. Did you ever know Cuinn before this?\"\n\n\"Never set eyes on him.\"\n\n\"Funny, I had the notion--\" He shrugged, turned away, then stopped.\n\n\"Don't think twice about rousing the camp if there's any disturbance.\nBetter a false alarm than an ambush that catches us all in our blankets.\nIf it came to a fight, we might be in a bad way. We all carry skeans,\nbut I don't think there's a shocker in the whole camp, let alone a gun.\nYou don't have one by any chance?\"\n\nAfter the men had turned in, Cuinn patrolling the camp, halted a minute\nbeside me and cocked his head toward the rustling forest.\n\n\"What's going on in there?\"\n\n\"Who knows? Catmen on the prowl, probably, thinking the horses would\nmake a good meal, or maybe that we would.\"\n\n\"Think it will come to a fight?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't know.\"\n\nHe surveyed me for a moment without speaking. \"And if it did?\"\n\n\"We'd fight.\" Then I sucked in my breath, for Cuinn had spoken Terran\nStandard, and I, without thinking had answered in the same language. He\ngrinned, showing white teeth filed to a point.\n\n\"I thought so!\"\n\nI seized his shoulder and demanded roughly, \"And what are you going to\ndo about it?\"\n\n\"That depends on you,\" he answered, \"and what you want in Shainsa. Tell\nme the truth. What were you doing in the Terran Zone?\" He gave me no\nchance to answer. \"You know who Kyral is, don't you?\"\n\n\"A trader,\" I said, \"who pays my wages and minds his own affairs.\" I\nmoved backward, hand on my skean, braced for a sudden rush. He made no\naggressive motion, however.\n\n\"Kyral told me you'd been asking questions about Rakhal Sensar,\" he\nsaid. \"Clever. Now I, for one, could have told you he'd never set eyes\non Rakhal. I--\"\n\nHe broke off, hearing a noise in the forest, a long eerie howl. I\nmuttered, \"If you've brought them down on us--\"\n\nHe shook his head urgently. \"I had to take that chance, to get word to\nthe others. It won't work. Where's the girl?\"\n\nI hardly heard him. I was hearing twigs snap, and silent sneaking feet.\nI turned for a yell that would rouse the camp and Cuinn grabbed me hard,\nsaying insistently, \"Quick! Where's the girl! Go back and tell her it\nwon't work! If Kyral suspected--\"\n\nHe never finished the sentence. Just behind us came another of the long\neerie howls. I knocked Cuinn away, and suddenly the night was filled\nwith crouching forms that came down on us like a whirlwind.\n\nI shouted madly as the camp came alive with men struggling out of\nblankets, fighting for life itself. I ran hard, still shouting, for the\nenclosure where we had tied the horses. A catman, slim and black-furred,\nwas crouched and cutting the hobble-strings of the nearest animal. I\nhurled myself on him. He exploded, clawing, raking my shoulder with\ntalons that ripped the rough cloth like paper. I whipped out my skean\nand slashed upward. The talons contracted in my shoulder and I gasped\nwith pain. Then the thing howled and fell away, clawing at the air. It\ntwitched and lay still.\n\nFour shots in rapid succession cracked in the clearing. Kyral to the\ncontrary, someone must have had a pistol. I heard one of the cat-things\nwail, a hoarse dying rattle. Something dark clawed my arm and I slashed\nwith the knife, going down as another set of talons fastened in my back,\nrolling and clutching.\n\nI managed to get the thing's forelimbs wedged under my elbow, my knee in\nits spine. I heaved, bent it backward, backward till it screamed, a high\nwail.\n\nThen I felt the spine snap and the dead thing mewled once, just air\nescaping from collapsing lungs, and slid limp from my thigh. Erect it\nhad not been over four feet tall and in the light of the dying fire it\nmight have been a dead lynx.\n\n\"Rascar....\" I heard a gasp, a groan. I whirled and saw Kyral go down,\nstruggling, drowning in half a dozen or more of the fierce half-humans.\nI leaped at the smother of bodies, ripped one away with a stranglehold,\nslashed at its throat.\n\nThey were easy to kill.\n\nI heard a high, urgent scream in their mewing tongue. Then the furred\nblack things seemed to melt into the forest as silently as they had\ncome. Kyral, dazed, his forehead running blood, his arm slashed to the\nbone, was sitting on the ground, still stunned.\n\nSomebody had to take charge. I bellowed, \"Lights! Get lights. They won't\ncome back if we have enough light, they can only see well in the dark.\"\n\nSomeone stirred the fire. It blazed up as they piled on dead branches,\nand I roughly commanded one of the kids to fill every lantern he could\nfind, and get them burning. Four of the dead things were lying in the\nclearing. The youngster I'd helped loading horses, the first day, gazed\ndown at one of the catmen, half-disemboweled by somebody's skean, and\nsuddenly bolted for the bushes, where I heard him retching.\n\nI set the others with stronger stomachs to dragging the bodies away from\nthe clearing, and went back to see how badly Kyral was hurt. He had the\nrip in his arm and his face was covered with blood from a shallow scalp\nwound, but he insisted on getting up to inspect the hurts of the others.\n\nThere was no one without a claw-wound in leg or back or shoulder, but\nnone were serious, and we were all feeling fairly cheerful when someone\ndemanded, \"Where's Cuinn?\"\n\nHe didn't seem to be anywhere. Kyral, staggering slightly, insisted on\nsearching, but I felt we wouldn't find him. \"He probably went off with\nhis friends,\" I snorted, and told about the signaling. Kyral looked\ngrave.\n\n\"You should have told me,\" he began, but shouts from the far end of the\nclearing sent us racing there. We nearly stumbled over a single,\nsolitary, motionless form, outstretched and lifeless, blind eyes staring\nupward at the moons.\n\nIt was Cuinn. And his throat had been torn completely out.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SIX\n\n\nOnce we were free of the forest, the road to the Dry-towns lay straight\nbefore us, with no hidden dangers. Some of us limped for a day or two,\nor favored an arm or leg clawed by the catmen, but I knew that what\nKyral said was true; it was a lucky caravan which had to fight off only\none attack.\n\nCuinn haunted me. A night or two of turning over his cryptic words in my\nmind had convinced me that whoever, or whatever he'd been signaling, it\nwasn't the catmen. And his urgent question \"Where's the girl?\" swam\nendlessly in my brain, making no more sense than when I had first heard\nit. Who had he mistaken me for? What did he think I was mixed up in? And\nwho, above all, were the \"others\" who had to be signaled, at the risk of\nan attack by catmen which had meant his own death?\n\nWith Cuinn dead, and Kyral thinking I'd saved his life, a large part of\nthe responsibility for the caravan now fell on me. And strangely I\nenjoyed it, making the most of this interval when I was separated from\nthe thought of blood-feud or revenge, the need of spying or the threat\nof exposure. During those days and nights on the trail I grew back\nslowly into the Dry-towner I once had been. I knew I would be sorry when\nthe walls of Shainsa rose on the horizon, bringing me back inescapably\nto my own quest.\n\nWe swung wide, leaving the straight trail to Shainsa, and Kyral\nannounced his intention of stopping for half a day at Canarsa, one of\nthe walled nonhuman cities which lay well off the traveled road. To my\ninadvertent show of surprise, he returned that he had trading\nconnections there.\n\n\"We all need a day's rest, and the Silent Ones will buy from me, though\nthey have few dealings with men. Look here, I owe you something. You\nhave lenses? You can get a better price in Canarsa than you'd get in\nArdcarran or Shainsa. Come along with me, and I'll vouch for you.\"\n\nKyral had been most friendly since the night I had dug him out from\nunder the catmen, and I knew no way to refuse without exposing myself\nfor the sham trader I was. But I was deathly apprehensive. Even with\nRakhal I had never entered any of the nonhuman towns.\n\nOn Wolf, human and nonhuman have lived side by side for centuries. And\nthe human is not always the superior being. I might pass, among the\nDry-towners and the relatively stupid humanoid _chaks_, for another\nDry-towner. But Rakhal had cautioned me I could not pass among nonhumans\nfor native Wolfan, and warned me against trying.\n\nNevertheless, I accompanied Kyral, carrying the box which had cost about\na week's pay in the Terran Zone and was worth a small fortune in the\nDry-towns.\n\nCanarsa seemed, inside the gates, like any other town. The houses were\nround, beehive fashion, and the streets totally empty. Just inside the\ngates a hooded figure greeted us, and gestured us by signs to follow\nhim. He was covered from head to foot with some coarse and shiny fiber\nwoven into stuff that looked like sacking.\n\nBut under the thick hooding was horror. It slithered and it had nothing\nlike a recognizable human shape or walk, and I felt the primeval ape in\nme cowering and gibbering in a corner of my brain. Kyral muttered, close\nto my ear, \"No outsider is ever allowed to look on the Silent Ones in\ntheir real form. I think they're deaf and dumb, but be damn careful.\"\n\n\"You bet,\" I whispered, and was glad the streets were empty. I walked\nalong, trying not to look at the gliding motion of that shrouded thing\nup ahead.\n\nThe trading was done in an open hut of reeds which looked as if it had\nbeen built in a hurry, and was not square, round, hexagonal or any other\nrecognizable geometrical shape. It formed a pattern of its own,\npresumably, but my human eyes couldn't see it. Kyral said in a breath of\na whisper, \"They'll tear it down and burn it after we leave. We're\nsupposed to have contaminated it too greatly for any of the Silent Ones\never to enter again. My family has traded with them for centuries, and\nwe're almost the only ones who have ever entered the city.\"\n\nThen two of the Silent Ones of Canarsa, also covered with that coarse\nshiny stuff, slithered into the hut, and Kyral choked off his words as\nif he had swallowed them.\n\nIt was the strangest trading I had ever done. Kyral laid out the small\nforged-steel tools and the coils of thin fine wire, and I unpacked my\nlenses and laid them out in neat rows. The Silent Ones neither spoke nor\nmoved, but through a thin place in the gray veiling I saw a speck which\nmight have been a phosphorescent eye, moving back and forth as if\nscanning the things laid out for their inspection.\n\nThen I smothered a gasp, for suddenly blank spaces appeared in the rows\nof merchandise. Certain small tools--wirecutters, calipers, surgical\nscissors--had vanished, and all the coils of wire had disappeared.\nBlanks equally had appeared in the rows of lenses; all of my tiny,\npowerful microscope lenses had vanished. I cast a quick glance at Kyral,\nbut he seemed unsurprised. I recalled vague rumors of the Silent Ones,\nand concluded that, eerie though it seemed, this was merely their way of\ndoing business.\n\nKyral pointed at one of the tools, at an exceptionally fine pair of\nbinocular lenses, at the last of the coils of wire. The shrouded ones\ndid not move, but the lenses and the wire vanished. The small tool\nremained, and after a moment Kyral dropped his hand.\n\nI took my cue from Kyral and remained motionless, awaiting whatever\nsurprise was coming. I had halfway expected what happened next. In the\nblank spaces, little points of light began to glimmer, and after a\nmoment, blue and red and green gem-stones appeared there. To me the\nsubstitution appeared roughly equitable and fair, though I am no judge\nof the fine points of gems.\n\nKyral scowled slightly and pointed to one of the green gems, and after a\nmoment it whisked away and a blue one took its place. In another spot\nwhere a fine set of surgical instruments had lain, Kyral pointed at the\nblue gem which now lay there, shook his head and held out three fingers.\nAfter a moment, a second blue stone lay winking beside the first.\n\nKyral did not move, but inexorably held out the three fingers. There was\na little swirling in the air, and then both gems vanished, and the case\nof surgical instruments lay in their place.\n\nStill Kyral did not move, but held the three fingers out for a full\nminute. Finally he dropped them and bent to pick up the case\ninstruments. Again the little swirl in the air, and the instruments\nvanished. In their place lay three of the blue gems. My mouth twitched\nin the first amusement I had felt since we entered this uncanny place.\nEvidently bargaining with the Silent Ones was not a great deal different\nthan bargaining with anyone anywhere. Nevertheless, under the eyes of\nthose shrouded but horrible forms--if they had eyes, which I doubted--I\nhad no impulse to protest their offered prices.\n\nI gathered up the rejected lenses, repacked them neatly, and helped\nKyral recrate the tools and instruments the Silent Ones had not wanted.\nI noticed that in addition to the microscope lenses and surgical\ninstruments, they had taken all the fine wire. I couldn't imagine, and\ndidn't particularly want to imagine, what they intended to do with it.\n\nOn our way back through the streets, unshepherded this time, Kyral's\ntongue was loosened as if with a great release from tension. \"They're\npsychokinetics,\" he told me. \"Quite a few of the nonhuman races are. I\nguess they have to be, having no eyes and no hands. But sometimes I\nwonder if we of the Dry-towns ought to deal with them at all.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" I asked, not really listening. I was thinking mostly\nabout the way the small objects had melted away and reappeared. The\nsight had stirred some uncomfortable memory, a vague sense of danger. It\nwas not tangible enough for me to know why I feared it, but just a\nsubliminal uneasiness that kept prodding at me, like a tooth that isn't\nquite aching yet.\n\nKyral said, \"We of Shainsa live between fire and flood. Terra on the one\nhand, and on the other maybe something worse, who knows? We know so\nlittle about the Silent Ones, and those like them. Who knows, maybe\nwe're giving them the weapons to destroy us--\" He broke off, with a\ngasp, and stood staring down one of the streets.\n\nIt lay open and bare between two rows of round houses, and Kyral was\nstaring fixedly at a doorway which had opened there. I followed his\nparalyzed gaze, and saw the girl.\n\nHair like spun black glass fell in hard waves around her shoulders, and\nthe red eyes smiled with alien malice, alien mischief, beneath the dark\ncrown of little stars. And the Toad God sprawled in hideous\nembroideries across the white folds of her breast.\n\nKyral gulped hoarsely. His hand flew up as he clutched the charms strung\nabout his neck. I imitated the gesture mechanically, watching Kyral,\nwondering if he would turn and run again. But he stood frozen for a\nminute. Then the spell broke and he took one step toward the girl, arms\noutstretched.\n\n\"Miellyn!\" he cried, and there was heartbreak in his voice. And again,\nthe cry making ringing echoes in the strange street:\n\n\"Miellyn! _Miellyn!_\"\n\nThis time it was the girl who whirled and fled. Her white robes\nfluttered and I saw the twinkle of her flying feet as she vanished into\na space between the houses and was gone.\n\nKyral took one blind step down the street, then another. But before he\ncould burst into a run I had him by the arm, dragging him back to\nsanity.\n\n\"Man, you've gone mad! Chase, in a nonhuman town?\"\n\nHe struggled for a minute, then, with a harsh sigh, he said, \"It's all\nright, I won't--\" and shook loose from my arm.\n\nHe did not speak again until we reached the gates of Canarsa and they\nclosed, silently and untouched, behind us. I had forgotten the place\nalready. I had space only to think of the girl, whose face I had not\nforgotten since the moment when she saved me and disappeared. Now she\nhad appeared again to Kyral. What did it all mean?\n\nI asked, as we walked toward the camp, \"Do you know that girl?\" But I\nknew the question was futile. Kyral's face was closed, conceding\nnothing, and his friendliness had vanished completely.\n\nHe said, \"Now I know you. You saved me from the catmen, and again in\nCanarsa, so my hands are bound from harming you. But it is evil to have\ndealings with those who have been touched by the Toad God.\" He spat\nnoisily on the ground, looked at me with loathing, and said, \"We will\nreach Shainsa in three days. Stay away from me.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SEVEN\n\n\nShainsa, first in the chain of Dry-towns that lie in the bed of a\nlong-dried ocean, is set at the center of a great alkali plain; a dusty,\nparched city bleached by a million years of sun. The houses are high,\nspreading buildings with many rooms and wide windows. The poorer sort\nwere made of sun-dried brick, the more imposing being cut from the\nbleached salt stone of the cliffs that rise behind the city.\n\nNews travels fast in the Dry-towns. If Rakhal were in the city, he'd\nsoon know that I was here, and guess who I was or why I'd come. I might\ndisguise myself so that my own sister, or the mother who bore me, would\nnot know me. But I had no illusions about my ability to disguise myself\nfrom Rakhal. He had created the disguise that was me.\n\nWhen the second sun set, red and burning, behind the salt cliffs, I knew\nhe was not in Shainsa, but I stayed on, waiting for something to happen.\nAt night I slept in a cubbyhole behind a wineshop, paying an inordinate\nprice for that very dubious privilege. And every day in the sleepy\nsilence of the blood-red noon I paced the public square of Shainsa.\n\nThis went on for four days. No one took the slightest notice of another\nnameless man in a shabby shirtcloak, without name or identity or known\nbusiness. No one appeared to see me except the dusty children, with pale\nfleecy hair, who played their patient games on the windswept curbing of\nthe square. They surveyed my scarred face with neither curiosity or\nfear, and it occurred to me that Rindy might be such another as these.\n\nIf I had still been thinking like an Earthman, I might have tried to\nquestion one of the children, or win their confidence. But I had a\ndeeper game in hand.\n\nOn the fifth day I was so much a fixture that my pacing went unnoticed\neven by the children. On the gray moss of the square, a few\ndried-looking old men, their faces as faded as their shirtcloaks and\nbearing the knife scars of a hundred forgotten fights, drowsed on the\nstone benches. And along the flagged walk at the edge of the square, as\nsuddenly as an autumn storm in the salt flats, a woman came walking.\n\nShe was tall, with a proud swinging walk, and a metallic clashing kept\nrhythm to her swift steps. Her arms were fettered, each wrist bound with\na jeweled bracelet and the bracelets linked together by a long,\nsilver-gilt chain passed through a silken loop at her waist. From the\nloop swung a tiny golden padlock, but in the lock stood an even tinier\nkey, signifying that she was a higher caste than her husband or consort,\nthat her fettering was by choice and not command.\n\nShe stopped directly before me and raised her arm in formal greeting\nlike a man. The chain made a tinkling sound in the hushed square as her\nother hand was pulled up tight against the silken loop at her waist. She\nstood surveying me for some moments, and finally I raised my head and\nreturned her gaze. I don't know why I had expected her to have hair like\nspun black glass and eyes that burned with a red reflection of the\nburning star.\n\nThis woman's eyes were darker than the poison-berries of the salt\ncliffs, and her mouth was a cut berry that looked just as dangerous. She\nwas young, the slimness of her shoulders and the narrow steel-chained\nwrists told me how very young she was, but her face had seen weather and\nstorms, and her dark eyes had weathered worse psychic storms than that.\nShe did not flinch at the sight of my scars, and met my gaze without\ndropping her eyes.\n\n\"You are a stranger. What is your business in Shainsa?\"\n\nI met the direct question with the insolence it demanded, hardly moving\nmy lips. \"I have come to buy women for the brothels of Ardcarran.\nPerhaps when washed you might be suitable. Who could arrange for your\nsale?\"\n\nShe took the rebuke impassively, though the bitter crimson of her mouth\ntwitched a little in mischief or rage. But she made no sign. The battle\nwas joined between us, and I knew already that it would be fought to the\nend.\n\nFrom somewhere in her draperies, something fell to the ground with a\nlittle tinkle. But I knew that trick too and I did not move. Finally she\nwent away without bending to retrieve it and when I looked around I saw\nthat all the fleece-haired children had stolen away, leaving their\nplaythings lying on the curbing. But one or two of the gaffers on the\nstone benches, who were old enough to show curiosity without losing\nface, were watching me with impassive eyes.\n\nI could have asked the woman's name then, but I held back, knowing it\ncould only lessen the prestige I had gained from the encounter. I\nglanced down, without seeming to do so, at the tiny mirror which had\nfallen from the recesses of the fur robe. Her name might have been\ninscribed on the reverse.\n\nBut I left it lying there to be picked up by the children when they\nreturned, and went back to the wineshop. I had accomplished my first\nobjective; if you can't be inconspicuous, be so damned conspicuous that\nnobody can miss you. And that in itself is a fair concealment. How many\npeople can accurately describe a street riot?\n\nI was finishing off a bad meal with a stone bottle of worse wine when\nthe _chak_ came in, disregarding the proprietor, and made straight for\nme. He was furred immaculately white. His velvet muzzle was contracted\nas if the very smells might soil it, and he kept a dainty paw\noutstretched to ward off accidental contact with greasy counters or\ntables or tapestries. His fur was scented, and his throat circled with a\ncollar of embroidered silk. This pampered minion surveyed me with the\ninnocent malice of an uninvolved nonhuman for merely human intrigues.\n\n\"You are wanted in the Great House of Shanitha, thcarred man.\" He spoke\nthe Shainsa dialect with an affected lisp. \"Will it pleathe you, come\nwis' me?\"\n\nI came, with no more than polite protest, but was startled. I had not\nexpected the encounter to reach the Great House so soon. Shainsa's Great\nHouse had changed hands four times since I had last been in Shainsa. I\nwasn't overly anxious to appear there.\n\nThe white _chak_, as out of place in the rough Dry-town as a jewel in\nthe streets or a raindrop in the desert, led me along a winding\nboulevard to an outlying district. He made no attempt to engage me in\nconversation, and indeed I got the distinct impression that this\ncockscomb of a nonhuman considered me well beneath his notice. He seemed\nmuch more aware of the blowing dust in the street, which ruffled and\nsmudged his carefully combed fur.\n\nThe Great House was carved from blocks of rough pink basalt, the entry\nguarded by two great caryatids enwrapped in chains of carved metal, set\nsomehow into the surface of the basalt. The gilt had long ago worn away\nfrom the chains so that it alternately gleamed gold or smudged base\nmetal. The caryatids were patient and blind, their jewel-eyes long\nvanished under a hotter sun than today's.\n\nThe entrance hall was enormous. A Terran starship could have stood\nupright inside it, was my first impression, but I dismissed that thought\nquickly; any Terran thought was apt to betray me. But the main hall was\nbuilt on a scale even more huge, and it was even colder than the\nlegendary hell of the _chaks_. It was far too big for the people in it.\n\nThere was a little solar heater in the ceiling, but it didn't help much.\nA dim glow came from a metal brazier but that didn't help much either.\nThe _chak_ melted into the shadows, and I went down the steps into the\nhall by myself, feeling carefully for each step with my feet and trying\nnot to seem to be doing so. My comparative night-blindness is the only\nsignificant way in which I really differ from a native Wolfan.\n\nThere were three men, two women and a child in the room. They were all\nDry-towners and had an obscure family likeness, and they all wore rich\ngarments of fur dyed in many colors. One of the men, old and stooped and\nwithered, was doing something to the brazier. A slim boy of fourteen was\nsitting cross-legged on a pile of cushions in the corner. There was\nsomething wrong with his legs.\n\nA girl of ten in a too-short smock that showed long spider-thin legs\nabove her low leather boots was playing with some sort of shimmery\ncrystals, spilling them out into patterns and scooping them up again\nfrom the uneven stones of the floor. One of the women was a fat, creased\nslattern, whose jewels and dyed furs did not disguise her greasy\nslovenliness.\n\nHer hands were unchained, and she was biting into a fruit which dripped\nred juice down the rich blue fur of her robe. The old man gave her a\nlook like murder as I came in, and she straightened slightly but did not\ndiscard the fruit. The whole room had a curious look of austere,\ndignified poverty, to which the fat woman was the only discordant note.\n\nBut it was the remaining man and woman who drew my attention, so that I\nnoticed the others only peripherally, in their outermost orbit. One was\nKyral, standing at the foot of the dais and glowering at me.\n\nThe other was the dark-eyed woman I had rebuked today in the public\nsquare.\n\nKyral said, \"So it's you.\" And his voice held nothing. Not rebuke, not\nfriendliness or a lack of it, not even hatred.\n\nNothing.\n\nThere was only one way to meet it. I faced the girl--she was sitting on\na thronelike chair next to the fat woman, and looked like a doe next to\na pig--and said boldly, \"I assume this summons to mean that you informed\nyour kinsmen of my offer.\"\n\nShe flushed, and that was triumph enough. I held back the triumph,\nhowever, wary of overconfidence. The gaffer laughed the high cackle of\nage, and Kyral broke in with a sharp, angry monosyllable by which I knew\nthat my remark had indeed been repeated, and had lost nothing in the\ntelling. But only the line of his jaw betrayed the anger as he said\ncalmly, \"Be quiet, Dallisa. Where did you pick this up?\"\n\nI said boldly, \"The Great House has changed rulers since last I smelled\nthe salt cliffs. Newcomers do not know my name and theirs is unknown to\nme.\"\n\nThe old gaffer said thinly to Kyral, \"Our name has lost _kihar_. One\ndaughter is lured away by the Toymaker and another babbles with\nstrangers in the square, and a homeless no-good of the streets does not\nknow our name.\"\n\nMy eyes, growing accustomed to the dark blaze of the brazier, saw that\nKyral was biting his lip and scowling. Then he gestured to a table where\nan array of glassware was set, and at the gesture, the white _chak_ came\non noiseless feet and poured wine.\n\n\"If you have no blood-feud with my family, will you drink with me?\"\n\n\"I will,\" I said, relaxing. Even if he had associated the trader with\nthe scarred Earthman of the spaceport, he seemed to have decided to drop\nthe matter. He seemed startled, but he waited until I had lifted the\nglass and taken a sip. Then, with a movement like lightning, he leaped\nfrom the dais and struck the glass from my lips.\n\nI staggered back, wiping my cut mouth, in a split-second juggling\npossibilities. The insult was terrible and deadly. I could do nothing\nnow but fight. Men had been murdered in Shainsa for far less. I had come\nto settle one feud, not involve myself in another, but even while these\nlightning thoughts flickered in my mind, I had whipped out my skean and\nI was surprised at the shrillness of my own voice.\n\n\"You contrive offense beneath your own roof--\"\n\n\"Spy and renegade!\" Kyral thundered. He did not touch his skean. From\nthe table he caught a long four-thonged whip, making it whistle through\nthe air. The long-legged child scuttled backward. I stepped back one\npace, trying to conceal my desperate puzzlement. I could not guess what\nhad prompted Kyral's attack, but whatever it was, I must have made some\nbad mistake and could count myself lucky to get out of there alive.\n\nKyral's voice perceptibly trembled with rage. \"You dare to come into my\nown home after I have tracked you to the Kharsa and back, blind fool\nthat I was! But now you shall pay.\"\n\nThe whip sang through the air, hissing past my shoulders. I dodged to\none side, retreating step by step as Kyral swung the powerful thongs. It\ncracked again, and a pain like the burning of red-hot irons seared my\nupper arm. My skean rattled down from numb fingers.\n\nThe whip whacked the floor.\n\n\"Pick up your skean,\" said Kyral. \"Pick it up if you dare.\" He poised\nthe lash again.\n\nThe fat woman screamed.\n\nI stood rigid, gauging my chances of disarming him with a sudden leap.\nSuddenly the girl Dallisa leaped from her seat with a harsh musical\nchiming of chains.\n\n\"Kyral, no! No, Kyral!\"\n\nHe moved slightly, but did not take his eyes from me. \"Get back,\nDallisa.\"\n\n\"No! Wait!\" She ran to him and caught his whip-arm, dragging it down,\nand spoke to him hurriedly and urgently. Kyral's face changed as she\nspoke; he drew a long breath and threw the whip down beside my skean on\nthe floor.\n\n\"Answer straight, on your life. What are you doing in Shainsa?\"\n\nI could hardly take it in that for the moment I was reprieved from\nsudden death, from being beaten into bloody death there at Kyral's feet.\nThe girl went back to her thronelike chair. Now I must either tell the\ntruth or a convincing lie, and I was lost in a game where I didn't know\nthe rules. The explanation I thought might get me out alive might be the\nvery one which would bring down instant and painful death. Suddenly,\nwith a poignancy that was almost pain, I wished Rakhal were standing\nhere at my side.\n\nBut I had to bluff it out alone.\n\nIf they had recognized me for Race Cargill, the Terran spy who had often\nbeen in Shainsa, they might release me--it was possible, I supposed,\nthat they were Terran sympathizers. On the other hand, Kyral's shouts of\n\"Spy, renegade!\" seemed to suggest the opposite.\n\nI stood trying to ignore the searing pain in my lashed arm, but I knew\nthat blood was running hot down my shoulder. Finally I said, \"I came to\nsettle blood-feud.\"\n\nKyral's lips thinned in what might have been meant for a smile. \"You\nshall, assuredly. But with whom, remains to be seen.\"\n\nKnowing I had nothing more to lose, I said, \"With a renegade called\nRakhal Sensar.\"\n\nOnly the old man echoed my words dully, \"Rakhal Sensar?\"\n\nI felt heartened, seeing I wasn't dead yet.\n\n\"I have sworn to kill him.\"\n\nKyral suddenly clapped his hands and shouted to the white _chak_ to\nclean up the broken glass on the floor. He said huskily, \"You are not\nyourself Rakhal Sensar?\"\n\n\"I _told_ you he wasn't,\" said Dallisa, high and hysterically. \"I _told_\nyou he wasn't.\"\n\n\"A scarred man, tall--what was I to think?\" Kyral sounded and looked\nbadly shaken. He filled a glass himself and handed it to me, saying\nhoarsely, \"I did not believe even the renegade Rakhal would break the\ncode so far as to drink with me.\"\n\n\"He would not.\" I could be positive about this. The codes of Terra had\nmade some superficial impress on Rakhal, but down deep his own world\nheld sway. If these men were at blood-feud with Rakhal and he stood here\nwhere I stood, he would have let himself be beaten into bloody rags\nbefore tasting their wine.\n\nI took the glass, raised it and drained it. Then, holding it out before\nme, I said, \"Rakhal's life is mine. But I swear by the red star and by\nthe unmoving mountains, by the black snow and by the Ghost Wind, I have\nno quarrel with any beneath this roof.\" I cast the glass to the floor,\nwhere it shattered on the stones.\n\nKyral hesitated, but under the blazing eyes of the girl he quickly\npoured himself a glass of the wine and drank a few sips, then flung down\nthe glass. He stepped forward and laid his hands on my shoulders. I\nwinced as he touched the welt of the lash and could not raise my own arm\nto complete the ceremonial toast.\n\nKyral stepped away and shrugged. \"Shall I have one of the women see to\nyour hurt?\" He looked at Dallisa, but she twisted her mouth. \"Do it\nyourself!\"\n\n\"It is nothing,\" I said, not truthfully. \"But I demand in requital that\nsince we are bound by spilled blood under your roof, that you give me\nwhat news you have of Rakhal, the spy and renegade.\"\n\nKyral said fiercely, \"If I knew, would I be under my own roof?\"\n\nThe old gaffer on the dais broke into shrill whining laughter. \"You have\ndrunk wi' him, Kyral, now he's bound you not to do him harm! I know the\nstory of Rakhal! He was spy for Terra twelve years. Twelve years, and\nthen he fought and flung their filthy money in their faces and left 'em.\nBut his partner was some Dry-town halfbreed or Terran spy and they\nfought wi' clawed gloves, and near killed one another except the\nTerrans, who have no honor, stopped 'em. See the marks of the _kifirgh_\non his face!\"\n\n\"By Sharra the golden-chained,\" said Kyral, gazing at me with something\nlike a grin. \"You are, if nothing else, a very clever man. What are you,\nspy, or half-caste of some Ardcarran slut?\"\n\n\"What I am doesn't matter to you,\" I said. \"You have blood-feud with\nRakhal, but mine is older than yours and his life is mine. As you are\nbound in honor to kill\"--the formal phrases came easily now to my\ntongue; the Earthman had slipped away--\"so you are bound in honor to\nhelp me kill. If anyone beneath your roof knows anything of Rakhal--\"\n\nKyral's smile bared his teeth.\n\n\"Rakhal works against the Son of the Ape,\" he said, using the insulting\nWolf term for the Terrans. \"If we help you to kill him, we remove a goad\nfrom their flanks. I prefer to let the filthy _Terranan_ spend their\nstrength trying to remove it themselves. Moreover, I believe you are\nyourself an Earthman.\n\n\"You have no right to the courtesy I extend to we, the People of the\nSky. Yet you have drunk wine with me and I have no quarrel with you.\" He\nraised his hand in dismissal, outfencing me. \"Leave my roof in safety\nand my city with honor.\"\n\nI could not protest or plead. A man's _kihar_, his personal dignity, is\na precious thing in Shainsa, and he had placed me so I could not\ncompromise mine further in words. Yet I lost _kihar_ equally if I left\nat his bidding, like an inferior dismissed.\n\nOne desperate gamble remained.\n\n\"A word,\" I said, raising my hand, and while he half turned, startled,\nbelieving I was indeed about to compromise my dignity by a further plea,\nI flung it at him:\n\n\"I will bet _shegri_ with you.\"\n\nHis iron composure looked shaken. I had delivered a blow to his belief\nthat I was an Earthman, for it is doubtful if there are six Earthmen on\nWolf who know about _shegri_, the dangerous game of the Dry-towns.\n\nIt is no ordinary gamble, for what the bettor stakes is his life,\npossibly his reason. Rarely indeed will a man bet _shegri_ unless he has\nnothing further to lose.\n\nIt is a cruel, possibly decadent game, which has no parallel anywhere in\nthe known universe.\n\nBut I had no choice. I had struck a cold trail in Shainsa. Rakhal might\nbe anywhere on the planet and half of Magnusson's month was already up.\nUnless I could force Kyral to tell what he knew, I might as well quit.\n\nSo I repeated: \"I will bet _shegri_ with you.\"\n\nAnd Kyral stood unmoving.\n\nFor what the _shegrin_ wagers is his courage and endurance in the face\nof torture and an unknown fate. On his side, the stakes are clearly\ndetermined beforehand. But if he loses, his punishment or penalty is at\nthe whim of the one who has accepted him, and he may be put to whatever\ndoom the winner determines.\n\nAnd this is the contest:\n\nThe _shegrin_ permits himself to be tortured from sunrise to sunset. If\nhe endures he wins. It is as simple as that. He can stop the torture at\nany moment by a word, but to do so is a concession of defeat.\n\nThis is not as dangerous as it might, at first, seem. The other party to\nthe bet is bound by the ironclad codes of Wolf to inflict no permanent\nphysical damage (no injury that will not heal with three suncourses).\nBut from sunrise to sunset, any torment or painful ingenuity which the\nhalf-human mentality of Wolf can devise must be endured.\n\nThe man who can outthink the torture of the moment, the man who can hold\nin his mind the single thought of his goal--that man can claim the\nstakes he has set, as well as other concessions made traditional.\n\nThe silence grew in the hall. Dallisa had straightened and was watching\nme intently, her lips parted and the tip of a little red tongue visible\nbetween her teeth. The only sound was the tiny crunching as the fat\nwoman nibbled at nuts and cast their shells into the brazier. Even the\nchild on the steps had abandoned her game with the crystal dice, and sat\nlooking up at me with her mouth open. Finally Kyral demanded, \"Your\nstakes?\"\n\n\"Tell me all you know of Rakhal Sensar and keep silence about me in\nShainsa.\"\n\n\"By the red shadow,\" Kyral burst out, \"you have courage, Rascar!\"\n\n\"Say only yes or no!\" I retorted.\n\nRebuked, he fell silent. Dallisa leaned forward and again, for some\nunknown reason, I thought of a girl with hair like spun black glass.\n\nKyral raised his hand. \"I say no. I have blood-feud with Rakhal and I\nwill not sell his death to another. Further, I believe you are Terran\nand I will not deal with you. And finally, you have twice saved my life\nand I would find small pleasure in torturing you. I say no. Drink again\nwith me and we part without a quarrel.\"\n\nBeaten, I turned to go.\n\n\"Wait,\" said Dallisa.\n\nShe stood up and came down from the dais, slowly this time, walking with\ndignity to the rhythm of her musically clashing chains. \"I have a\nquarrel with this man.\"\n\nI started to say that I did not quarrel with women, and stopped myself.\nThe Terran concept of chivalry has no equivalent on Wolf.\n\nShe looked at me with her dark poison-berry eyes, icy and level and\namused, and said, \"I will bet _shegri_ with you, unless you fear me,\nRascar.\"\n\nAnd I knew suddenly that if I lost, I might better have trusted myself\nto Kyral and his whip, or to the wild beast-things of the mountains.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER EIGHT\n\n\nI slept little that night.\n\nThere is a tale told in Daillon of a _shegri_ where the challenger was\nleft in a room alone, where he was blindfolded and told to await the\nbeginning of the torment.\n\nSomewhere in those dark hours of waiting, between the unknown and the\nunexpected, the hours of telling over to himself the horrors of past\n_shegri_, the torture of anticipation alone became the unbearable. A\nlittle past noon he collapsed in screams of horror and died raving,\nunmarred, untouched.\n\nDaybreak came slowly, and with the first streamers of light came Dallisa\nand the white _chak_, maliciously uninvolved, sniffing his way through\nthe shabby poverty of the great hall. They took me to a lower dungeon\nwhere the slant of the sunlight was less visible. Dallisa said, \"The sun\nhas risen.\"\n\nI said nothing. Any word may be interpreted as a confession of defeat. I\nresolved to give them no excuse. But my skin crawled and I had that\npeculiar prickling sensation where the hair on my forearms was\nbristling erect with tension and fear.\n\nDallisa said to the _chak_, \"His gear was not searched. See that he has\nswallowed no anesthetic drugs.\"\n\nBriefly I gave her credit for thoroughness, even while I wondered in a\nsplit second why I had not thought of this. Drugs could blur\nconsciousness, at least, or suspend reality. The white nonhuman sprang\nforward and pinioned my arms with one strong, spring-steel forearm. With\nhis other hand he forced my jaws open. I felt the furred fingers at the\nback of my throat, gagged, struggled briefly and doubled up in\nuncontrollable retching.\n\nDallisa's poison-berry-eyes regarded me levelly as I struggled upright,\nfighting off the dizzy sickness of disgust. Something about her\nimpassive face stopped me cold. I had been, momentarily, raging with\nfury and humiliation. Now I realized that this had been a calculated,\ncareful gesture to make me lose my temper and thus sap my resistance.\n\nIf she could set me to fighting, if she could make me spend my strength\nin rage, my own imagination would fight on her side to make me lose\ncontrol before the end. Swimming in the glare of her eyes, I realized\nshe had never thought for a moment that I had taken any drug. Acting on\nKyral's hint that I was a Terran, she was taking advantage of the\nwell-known Terran revulsion for the nonhuman.\n\n\"Blindfold him,\" Dallisa commanded, then instantly countermanded that:\n\"No, strip him first.\"\n\nThe _chak_ ripped off shirtcloak, shirt, shoes, breeches, and I had my\nfirst triumph when the wealed clawmarks on my shoulders--worse, if\npossible, than those which disfigured my face--were laid bare. The\n_chak_ screwed up his muzzle in fastidious horror, and Dallisa looked\nshaken. I could almost read her thoughts:\n\n_If he endured this, what hope have I to make him cry mercy?_\n\nBriefly I remembered the months I lay feverish and half dead, waiting\nfor the wounds Rakhal had inflicted to heal, those months when I had\nbelieved that nothing would ever hurt me again, that I had known the\nworst of all suffering. But I had been younger then.\n\nDallisa had picked up two small sharp knives. She weighed them,\nbriefly, gesturing to the _chak_. Without resisting, I let myself be\nmanhandled backward, spreadeagled against the wall.\n\nDallisa commanded, \"Drive the knives through his palms to the wall!\"\n\nMy hands twitched convulsively, anticipating the slash of steel, and my\nthroat closed in spasmodic dread. This was breaking the compact, bound\nas they were not to inflict physical damage. I opened my lips to protest\nthis breaking of the bond of honor and met her dark blazing stare, and\nsuddenly the sweat broke out on my forehead. I had placed myself wholly\nin their hands, and as Kyral had said, they were in no way bound by\nhonor to respect a pledge to a Terran!\n\nThen, as my hands clenched into fists, I forced myself to relax. This\nwas a bluff, a mental trick to needle me into breaking the pact and\npleading for mercy. I set my lips, spread my palms wide against the wall\nand waited impassively.\n\nShe said in her lilting voice, \"Take care not to sever the tendons, or\nhis hands would be paralyzed and he may claim we have broken our\ncompact.\"\n\nThe points of the steel, razor-sharp, touched my palms, and I felt blood\nrun down my hand before the pain. With an effort that turned my face\nwhite, I did not pull away from the point. The knives drove deeper.\n\nDallisa gestured to the _chak_. The knives dropped. Two pinpricks, a\nquarter of an inch deep, stung in my palm. I had outbluffed her. Had I?\n\nIf I had expected her to betray disappointment--and I had--I was\ndisappointed. Abruptly, as if the game had wearied her already, she\ngestured, and I could not hold back a gasp as my arms were hauled up\nover my head, twisted violently around one another and trussed with thin\ncords that bit deep into the flesh. Then the rough upward pull almost\njerked my shoulders from their sockets and I heard the giant _chak_\ngrunt with effort as I was hauled upward until my feet barely, on\ntiptoe, touched the floor.\n\n\"Blindfold him,\" said Dallisa languidly, \"so that he cannot watch the\nascent of the sun or its descent or know what is to come.\"\n\nA dark softness muffled my eyes. After a little I heard her steps\nretreating. My arms, wrenched overhead and numbed with the bite of the\ncords, were beginning to hurt badly now. But it wasn't too bad. Surely\nshe did not mean that this should be all....\n\nSternly I controlled my imagination, taking a tight rein on my thoughts.\nThere was only one way to meet this--hanging blind and racked in space,\nmy toes barely scrabbling at the floor--and that was to take each thing\nas it came and not look ahead for an instant. First of all I tried to\nget my feet under me, and discovered that by arching upwards to my\nfullest height I could bear my weight on tiptoe and ease, a little, the\ndislocating ache in my armpits by slackening the overhead rope.\n\nBut after a little, a cramping pain began to flare through the arches of\nmy feet, and it became impossible to support my weight on tiptoe. I\njarred down with violent strain on my wrists and wrenched shoulders\nagain, and for a moment the shooting agony was so intense that I nearly\nscreamed. I thought I heard a soft breath near me.\n\nAfter a little it subsided to a sharp ache, then to a dull ache, and\nthen to the violent cramping pain again, and once more I struggled to\nget my toes under me. I realized that by allowing my toes barely to\ntouch the floor they had doubled and tripled the pain by the tantalizing\nhope of, if not momentary relief, at least the alteration of one pain\nfor another.\n\nI haven't the faintest idea, even now, how long I repeated that\nagonizing cycle: struggle for a toehold on rough stone, scraping my bare\nfeet raw; arch upward with all my strength to release for a few moments\nthe strain on my wrenched shoulders; the momentary illusion of relief as\nI found my balance and the pressure lightened on my wrists.\n\nThen the slow creeping, first of an ache, then of a pain, then of a\nviolent agony in the arches of feet and calves. And, delayed to the last\nendurable moment, that final terrible anguish when the drop of my full\nweight pulled shoulder and wrist and elbow joints with that\nbone-shattering jerk.\n\nI started once to estimate how much time had passed, how many hours had\ncrawled by, then checked myself, for that was imminent madness. But once\nthe process had begun my brain would not abandon and I found myself,\nwith compulsive precision, counting off the seconds and the minutes in\neach cycle: stretch upward, release the pressure on the arms; the\nbeginning of pain in calves and arches and toes; the creeping of pain up\nribs and loins and shoulders; the sudden jarring drop on the arms again.\n\nMy throat was intolerably dry. Under other circumstances I might have\nestimated the time by the growth of hunger and thirst, but the rough\ntreatment I had received made this impossible. There were other,\nunmentionable, humiliating pains.\n\nAfter a time, to bolster my flagging courage, I found myself thinking of\nall the ways it might have been worse. I had heard of a _shegrin_\nexposed to the bite of poisonous--not fatal, but painfully\npoisonous--insects, and to the worrying of the small gnawing rodents\nwhich can be trained to bite and tear. Or I might have been branded....\n\nI banished the memory with the powerful exorcism; the man in Daillon\nwhose anticipation, alone, of a torture which never came, had broken his\nmind. There was only one way to conquer this, and that was to act as if\nthe present moment was the only one, and never for a moment to forget\nthat the strongest of compacts bound them not to harm me, that the end\nof this was fixed by sunset.\n\nGradually, however, all such rational thoughts blurred in a semidelirium\nof thirst and pain, narrowing to a red blaze of agony across my shoulder\nblades. I eased up on my toes again.\n\nWhite-hot pain blazed through my feet. The rough stone on which my toes\nsank had been covered with metal and I smelled scorching flesh, jerking\nup my feet with a wordless snarl of rage and fury, hanging in agony by\nmy shoulders alone.\n\nAnd then I lost consciousness, at least for several moments, for when I\nbecame aware again, through the nightmare of pain, my toes were resting\nlightly and securely on cold stone. The smell of burned flesh remained,\nand the painful stinging in my toes. Mingled with that smell was a drift\nof perfume close by.\n\nDallisa murmured, \"I do not wish to break our bargain by damaging your\nfeet. It's only a little touch of fire to keep you from too much\nsecurity in resting them.\"\n\nI felt the taste of blood mingle in my mouth with the sour taste of\nvomit. I felt delirious, lightheaded. After another eternity I wondered\nif I had really heard Dallisa's lilting croon or whether it was a\nnightmare born of feverish pain:\n\n_Plead with me. A word, only a word and I will release you, strong man,\nscarred man. Perhaps I shall demand only a little space in your arms.\nWould not such doom be light upon you? Perhaps I shall set you free to\nseek Rakhal if only to plague Kyral. A word, only a word from you. A\nword, only a word from you...._\n\nIt died into an endlessly echoing whisper. Swaying, blinded, I wondered\nwhy I endured. I drew a dry tongue over lips, salty and bloody, and\nnightmarishly considered yielding, winning my way somehow around\nDallisa. Or knocking her suddenly senseless and escaping--I, who need\nnot be bound by Wolf's codes either. I fumbled with a stiff shape of\nwords.\n\nAnd a breath saved me, a soft, released breath of anticipation. It was\nanother trick. I swayed, limp and racked. I was not Race Cargill now. I\nwas a dead man hanging in chains, swinging, filthy vultures pecking at\nmy dangling feet. I was....\n\nThe sound of boots rang on the stone and Kyral's voice, low and bitter,\ndemanded somewhere behind me, \"What have you done with him?\"\n\nShe did not answer, but I heard her chains clash lightly and imagined\nher gesture. Kyral muttered, \"Women have no genius at any torture\nexcept....\" His voice faded out into great distances. Their words came\nto me over a sort of windy ringing, like the howling of lost men, dying\nin the snowfast passes of the mountains.\n\n\"Speak up, you fool, he can't hear you now.\"\n\n\"If you have let him faint, you are clumsy!\"\n\n\"_You_ talk of clumsiness!\" Dallisa's voice, even thinned by the\nnightmare ringing in my head, held concentrated scorn. \"Perhaps I shall\nrelease him, to find Rakhal when you failed! The Terrans have a price on\nRakhal's head, too. And at least this man will not confuse himself with\nhis prey!\"\n\n\"If you think I would let you bargain with a _Terranan_--\"\n\nDallisa cried passionately, \"You trade with the Terrans! How would you\nstop me, then?\"\n\n\"I trade with them because I must. But for a matter involving the honor\nof the Great House--\"\n\n\"The Great House whose steps you would never have climbed, except for\nRakhal!\" Dallisa sounded as if she were chewing her words in little\npieces and spitting them at Kyral. \"Oh, you were clever to take us both\nas your consorts! You did not know it was Rakhal's doing, did you? Hate\nthe Terrans, then!\" She spat an obscenity at him. \"Enjoy your hate,\nwallow in hating, and in the end all Shainsa will fall prey to the\nToymaker, like Miellyn.\"\n\n\"If you speak that name again,\" said Kyral very low, \"I will kill you.\"\n\n\"Like Miellyn, Miellyn, Miellyn,\" Dallisa repeated deliberately. \"You\nfool, Rakhal knew nothing of Miellyn!\"\n\n\"He was seen--\"\n\n\"With _me_, you fool! With _me_! You cannot yet tell twin from twin?\nRakhal came to _me_ to ask news of her!\"\n\nKyral cried out hoarsely, like a man in anguish, \"Why didn't you tell\nme?\"\n\n\"You don't really have to ask, do you, Kyral?\"\n\n\"You bitch!\" said Kyral. \"You filthy bitch!\" I heard the sound of a\nblow. The next moment Kyral ripped the blindfold from my eyes and I\nblinked in the blaze of light. My arms were wholly numb now, twisted\nabove my head, but the jar of his touch sent fresh pain racing through\nme. Kyral's face swam out of the blaze of hell. \"If that is true, then\nthis is a damnable farce, Dallisa. You have lost our chance of learning\nwhat he knows of Miellyn.\"\n\n\"What _he_ knows?\" Dallisa lowered her hand from her face, where a\nbruise was already darkening.\n\n\"Miellyn has twice appeared when I was with him. Loose him, Dallisa, and\nbargain with him. What we know of Rakhal for what he knows of Miellyn.\"\n\n\"If you think I would let you bargain with _Terranan_,\" she mocked.\n\"Weakling, this quarrel is _mine_! You fool, the others in the caravan\nwill give me news, if you will not! _Where is Cuinn?_\"\n\nFrom a million miles away Kyral laughed. \"You've slipped the wrong hawk,\nDallisa. The catmen killed him.\" His skean flicked loose. He climbed to\na perch near the rope at my wrists. \"Bargain with me, Rascar!\"\n\nI coughed, unable to speak, and Kyral insisted, \"Will you bargain? End\nthis damned woman's farce which makes a mock of _shegri_?\"\n\nThe slant of sun told me there was light left. I found a shred of voice,\nnot knowing what I was going to say until I had said it, irrevocably.\n\"This is between Dallisa and me.\"\n\nKyral glared at me in mounting rage. With four strides he was out of the\nroom, flinging back a harsh, furious \"I hope you kill each other!\" and\nthe door slammed.\n\nDallisa's face swam red, and again as before, I knew the battle which\nwas joined between us would be fought to a dreadful end. She touched my\nchest lightly, but the touch jolted excruciating pain through my\nshoulders.\n\n\"Did you kill Cuinn?\"\n\nI wondered, wearily, what this presaged.\n\n\"Did you?\" In a passion, she cried, \"Answer! Did you kill him?\" She\nstruck me hard, and where the touch had been pain, the blow was a blaze\nof white agony. I fainted.\n\n\"Answer!\" She struck me again and the white blaze jolted me back to\nconsciousness. \"Answer me! Answer!\" Each cry bought a blow until I\ngasped finally, \"He signaled ... set catmen on us....\"\n\n\"No!\" She stood staring at me and her white face was a death mask in\nwhich the eyes lived. She screamed wildly and the huge _chak_ came\nrunning.\n\n\"Cut him down! Cut him down! Cut him down!\"\n\nA knife slashed the rope and I slumped, falling in a bone-breaking\nhuddle to the floor. My arms were still twisted over my head. The _chak_\ncut the ropes apart, pulled my arms roughly back into place, and I\ngagged with the pain as the blood began flowing painfully through the\nchafed and swollen hands.\n\nAnd then I lost consciousness. More or less permanently, this time.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER NINE\n\n\nWhen I came to again I was lying with my head in Dallisa's lap, and the\nreddish color of sunset was in the room. Her thighs were soft under my\nhead, and for an instant I wondered if, in delirium, I had conceded to\nher. I muttered, \"Sun ... not down....\"\n\nShe bent her face to mine, whispering, \"Hush. Hush.\"\n\nIt was heaven, and I drifted off again. After a moment I felt a cup\nagainst my lips.\n\n\"Can you swallow this?\"\n\nI could and did. I couldn't taste it yet, but it was cold and wet and\nfelt heavenly trickling down my throat. She bent and looked into my\neyes, and I felt as if I were falling into those reddish and stormy\ndepths. She touched my scarred mouth with a light finger. Suddenly my\nhead cleared and I sat upright.\n\n\"Is this a trick to force me into calling my bet?\"\n\nShe recoiled as if I had struck her, then the trace of a smile flitted\naround her red mouth. Yes, between us it was battle. \"You are right to\nbe suspicious, I suppose. But if I tell you what I know of Rakhal, will\nyou trust me then?\"\n\nI looked straight at her and said, \"No.\"\n\nSurprisingly, she threw back her head and laughed. I flexed my freed\nwrists cautiously. The skin was torn away and chafed, and my arms ached\nto the bone. When I moved harsh lances of pain drove through my chest.\n\n\"Well, until sunset I have no right to ask you to trust me,\" said\nDallisa when she had done laughing. \"And since you are bound by my\ncommand until the last ray has fallen, I command that you lay your head\nupon my knees.\"\n\nI blazed, \"You are making a game of me!\"\n\n\"Is that my privilege? Do you refuse?\"\n\n\"Refuse?\" It was not yet sunset. This might be a torture more complex\nthan any which had yet greeted me. From the scarlet glint in her eyes I\nfelt she was playing with me, as the cat-things of the forest play with\ntheir helpless victims. My mouth twitched in a grimace of humiliation as\nI lowered myself obediently until my head rested on her fur-clad knees.\n\nShe murmured, smiling, \"Is this so unbearable, then?\"\n\nI said nothing. Never, never for an instant could I forget that--all\nhuman, all woman as she seemed--Dallisa's race was worn and old when the\nTerran Empire had not left their home star. The mind of Wolf, which has\nmingled with the nonhuman since before the beginnings of recorded time,\nis unfathomable to an outsider. I was better equipped than most Earthmen\nto keep pace with its surface acts, but I could never pretend to\nunderstand its deeper motivations.\n\nIt works on complex and irrational logic. Mischief is an integral part\nof it. Even the deadly blood-feud with Rakhal had begun with an\noverelaborate practical joke--which had lost the Service, incidentally,\nseveral thousand credits worth of spaceship.\n\nAnd so I could not trust Dallisa for an instant. Yet it was wonderful to\nlie here with my head resting against the perfumed softness of her body.\n\nThen suddenly her arms were gripping me, frantic and hungry; the subdued\nthing in her voice, her eyes, flamed out hot and wild. She was pressing\nthe whole length of her body to mine, breasts and thighs and long legs,\nand her voice was hoarse.\n\n\"Is this torture too?\"\n\nBeneath the fur robe she was soft and white, and the subtle scent of her\nhair seemed a deeper entrapment than any. Frail as she seemed, her arms\nhad the strength of steel, and pain blazed down my wrenched shoulders,\nseared through the twisted wrists. Then I forgot the pain.\n\nOver her shoulder the last dropping redness of the sun vanished and\nplunged the room into orchid twilight.\n\nI caught her wrists in my hands, prizing them backward, twisting them\nupward over her head. I said thickly, \"The sun's down.\" And then I\nstopped her wild mouth with mine.\n\nAnd I knew that the battle between us had reached climax and victory\nsimultaneously, and any question about who had won it was purely\nacademic.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDuring the night sometime, while her dark head lay motionless on my\nshoulder, I found myself staring into the darkness, wakeful. The\nthrobbing of my bruises had little to do with my sleeplessness; I was\nremembering other chained girls from the old days in the Dry-towns, and\nthe honey and poison of them distilled into Dallisa's kisses. Her head\nwas very light on my shoulders, and she felt curiously insubstantial,\nlike a woman of feathers.\n\nOne of the tiny moons was visible through the slitted windows. I thought\nof my rooms in the Terran Trade City, clean and bright and warm, and all\nthe nights when I had paced the floor, hating, filled to the teeth with\nbitterness, longing for the windswept stars of the Dry-towns, the salt\nsmell of the winds and the musical clashing of the walk of the chained\nwomen.\n\nWith a sting of guilt, I realized that I had half forgotten Juli and my\npledge to her and her misfortune which had freed me again, for this.\n\nYet I had won, and what they knew had narrowed my planet-wide search to\na pinpoint. Rakhal was in Charin.\n\nI wasn't altogether surprised. Charin is the only city on Wolf, except\nthe Kharsa, where the Terran Empire has put down deep roots into the\nplanet, built a Trade City, a smaller spaceport. Like the Kharsa, it\nlies within the circle of Terran law--and a million miles outside it.\n\nA nonhuman town, inhabited largely by _chaks_, it is the core and center\nof the resistance movement, a noisy town in a perpetual ferment. It was\nthe logical place for a renegade. I settled myself so that the ache in\nmy racked shoulders was less violent, and muttered, \"Why Charin?\"\n\nSlight as the movement was, it roused Dallisa. She rolled over and\npropped herself on her elbows, quoting drowsily, \"The prey walks safest\nat the hunter's door.\"\n\nI stared at the square of violet moonlight, trying to fit together all\nthe pieces of the puzzle, and asked half aloud, \"What prey and what\nhunters?\"\n\nDallisa didn't answer. I hadn't expected her to answer. I asked the real\nquestion in my mind: \"Why does Kyral hate Rakhal Sensar, when he doesn't\neven know him by sight?\"\n\n\"There are reasons,\" she said somberly. \"One of them is Miellyn, my twin\nsister. Kyral climbed the steps of the Great House by claiming us both\nas his consorts. He is our father's son by another wife.\"\n\nThat explained much. Brother-and-sister marriages, not uncommon in the\nDry-towns, are based on expediency and suspicion, and are frequently,\nthough not always loveless. It explained Dallisa's taunts, and it partly\nexplained, only partly, why I found her in my arms. It did not explain\nRakhal's part in this mysterious intrigue, nor why Kyral had taken me\nfor Rakhal, (but only after he remembered seeing me in Terran clothing).\n\nI wondered why it had never occurred to me before that I might be\nmistaken for Rakhal. There was no close resemblance between us, but a\ncasual description would apply equally well to me or to Rakhal. My\nheight is unusual for a Terran--within an inch of Rakhal's own--and we\nhad roughly the same build, the same coloring. I had copied his walk,\nimitated his mannerisms, since we were boys together.\n\nAnd, blurring minor facial characteristics, there were the scars of the\n_kifirgh_ on my mouth, cheeks, and shoulders. Anyone who did not know us\nby sight, anyone who had known us by reputation from the days when we\nhad worked together in the Dry-towns, might easily take one of us for\nthe other. Even Juli had blurted, \"You're so much like--\" before\nthinking better of it.\n\nOther odd bits of the puzzle floated in my mind, stubbornly refusing to\ntake on recognizable patterns, the disappearance of a toy-seller; Juli's\nhysterical babbling; the way the girl--Miellyn?--had vanished into a\nshrine of Nebran; and the taunts of Dallisa and the old man about a\nmysterious \"Toymaker.\" And something, some random joggling of a memory,\nin that eerie trading in the city of the Silent Ones. I knew all these\nthings fitted together somehow, but I had no real hope that Dallisa\ncould complete their pattern for me.\n\nShe said, with a vehemence that startled me, \"Miellyn is only the\nexcuse! Kyral hates Rakhal because Rakhal will compromise and because\nhe'll fight!\"\n\nShe rolled over and pressed herself against me in the darkness. Her\nvoice trembled. \"Race, our world is dying. We can't stand against Terra.\nAnd there are other things, worse things.\"\n\nI sat up, surprised to find myself defending Terra to this girl. After\nall these years I was back in my own world. And yet I heard myself say\nquietly, \"The Terrans aren't exploiting Wolf. We haven't abolished the\nrule of Shainsa. We've changed nothing.\"\n\nIt was true. Terra held Wolf by compact, not conquest. They paid, and\npaid generously, for the lease of the lands where their Trade Cities\nwould rise, and stepped beyond them only when invited to do so.\n\n\"We let any city or state that wants to keep its independence govern\nitself until it collapses, Dallisa. And they do collapse after a\ngeneration or so. Very few primitive planets can hold out against us.\nThe people themselves get tired of living under feudal or theocratic\nsystems, and they beg to be taken into the Empire. That's all.\"\n\n\"But that's just it,\" Dallisa argued. \"You give the people all those\nthings we used to give them, and you do it better. Just by being here,\nyou are killing the Dry-towns. They're turning to you and leaving us,\nand you let them do it.\"\n\nI shook my head. \"We've kept the Terran Peace for centuries. What do you\nexpect? Should we give you arms, planes, bombs, weapons to hold your\nslaves down?\"\n\n\"Yes!\" she flared at me. \"The Dry-towns have ruled Wolf\nsince--since--you, you can't even imagine how long! And we made compact\nwith you to trade here--\"\n\n\"And we have rewarded you by leaving you untouched,\" I said quietly.\n\"But we have not forbidden the Dry-towns to come into the Empire and\nwork with Terra.\"\n\nShe said bitterly, \"Men like Kyral will die first,\" and pressed her face\nhelplessly against me. \"And I will die with them. Miellyn broke away,\nbut I cannot! Courage is what I lack. Our world is rotten, Race, rotten\nall through, and I'm as rotten as the core of it. I could have killed\nyou today, and I'm here in your arms. Our world is rotten, but I've no\nconfidence that the new world will be better!\"\n\nI put my hand under her chin, and looked down gravely into her face,\nonly a pale oval in the darkness. There was nothing I could say; she had\nsaid it all, and truthfully. I had hated and yearned and starved for\nthis, and when I found it, it turned salty and bloody on my lips, like\nDallisa's despairing kisses. She ran her fingers over the scars on my\nface, then gripped her small thin hands around my wrists so fiercely\nthat I grunted protest.\n\n\"You will not forget me,\" she said in her strangely lilting voice. \"You\nwill not forget me, although you were victorious.\" She twisted and lay\nlooking up at me, her eyes glowing faintly luminous in darkness. I knew\nthat she could see me as clearly as if it were day. \"I think it was my\nvictory, not yours, Race Cargill.\"\n\nGently, on an impulse I could not explain, I picked up one delicate\nwrist, then the other, unclasping the heavy jeweled bracelets. She let\nout a stifled cry of dismay. And then I tossed the chains into a corner\nbefore I drew her savagely into my arms again and forced her head back\nunder my mouth.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI said good-bye to her alone, in the reddish, windswept space before the\nGreat House. She pressed her head against my shoulder and whispered,\n\"Race, take me with you!\"\n\nFor answer I only picked up her narrow wrists and turned them over on my\npalm. The jeweled bracelets were clasped again around the thinly boned\njoints, and on some self-punishing impulse she had shortened the chains\nso that she could not even put her arms around me. I lifted the punished\nwrists to my mouth and kissed them gently.\n\n\"You don't want to leave, Dallisa.\"\n\nI was desperately sorry for her. She would go down with her dying world,\nproud and cold and with no place in the new one. She kissed me and I\ntasted blood, her thin fettered body straining wildly against me, shaken\nwith tearing, convulsive sobs. Then she turned and fled back into the\nshadow of the great dark house.\n\nI never saw her again.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TEN\n\n\nA few days later I found myself nearing the end of the trail.\n\nIt was twilight in Charin, hot and reeking with the gypsy glare of fires\nwhich burned, smoking, at the far end of the Street of the Six\nShepherds. I crouched in the shadow of a wall, waiting.\n\nMy skin itched from the dirty shirtcloak I hadn't changed in days.\nShabbiness is wise in nonhuman parts, and Dry-towners think too much of\nwater to waste much of it in superfluous washing anyhow. I scratched\nunobtrusively and glanced cautiously down the street.\n\nIt seemed empty, except for a few sodden derelicts sprawled in\ndoorways--the Street of the Six Shepherds is a filthy slum--but I made\nsure my skean was loose. Charin is not a particularly safe town, even\nfor Dry-towners, and especially not for Earthmen, at any time.\n\nEven with what Dallisa had told me, the search had been difficult.\nCharin is not Shainsa. In Charin, where human and nonhuman live closer\ntogether than anywhere else on the planet, information about such men as\nRakhal can be bought, but the policy is to let the buyer beware. That's\nfair enough, because the life of the seller has a way of not being worth\nmuch afterward, either.\n\nA dirty, dust-laden wind was blowing up along the street, heavy with\nstrange smells. The pungent reek of incense from a street-shrine was in\nthe smells. The heavy, acrid odor that made my skin crawl. In the hills\nbehind Charin, the Ghost Wind was rising.\n\nBorne on this wind, the Ya-men would sweep down from the mountains, and\neverything human or nearly human would scatter in their path. They would\nrange through the quarter all night, and in the morning they would melt\naway, until the Ghost Wind blew again. At any other time, I would\nalready have taken cover. I fancied that I could hear, borne on the\nwind, the faraway yelping, and envision the plumed, taloned figures\nwhich would come leaping down the street.\n\nIn that moment, the quiet of the street split asunder.\n\nFrom somewhere a girl's voice screamed in shrill pain or panic. Then I\nsaw her, dodging between two of the chinked pebble-houses. She was a\nchild, thin and barefoot, a long tangle of black hair flying loose as\nshe darted and twisted to elude the lumbering fellow at her heels. His\noutstretched paw jerked cruelly at her slim wrist.\n\nThe little girl screamed and wrenched herself free and threw herself\nstraight on me, wrapping herself around my neck with the violence of a\nstorm wind. Her hair got in my mouth and her small hands gripped at my\nback like a cat's flexed claws.\n\n\"Oh, help me,\" she gasped between sobs. \"Don't let him get me, don't.\"\nAnd even in that broken plea I took it in that the little ragamuffin did\nnot speak the jargon of that slum, but the pure speech of Shainsa.\n\nWhat I did then was as automatic as if it had been Juli. I pulled the\nkid loose, shoved her behind me, and scowled at the brute who lurched\ntoward us.\n\n\"Make yourself scarce,\" I advised. \"We don't chase little girls where I\ncome from. Haul off, now.\"\n\nThe man reeled. I smelled the rankness of his rags as he thrust one\ngrimy paw at the girl. I never was the hero type, but I'd started\nsomething which I had to carry through. I thrust myself between them and\nput my hand on the skean again.\n\n\"You--you Dry-towner.\" The man set up a tipsy howl, and I sucked in my\nbreath. Now I was in for it. Unless I got out of there damned fast, I'd\nlose what I'd come all the way to Charin to find.\n\nI felt like handing the girl over. For all I knew, the bully could be\nher father and she was properly in line for a spanking. This wasn't any\nof my business. My business lay at the end of the street, where Rakhal\nwas waiting at the fires. He wouldn't be there long. Already the smell\nof the Ghost Wind was heavy and harsh, and little flurries of sand went\nracing along the street, lifting the flaps of the doorways.\n\nBut I did nothing so sensible. The big lunk made a grab at the girl, and\nI whipped out my skean and pantomimed.\n\n\"Get going!\"\n\n\"Dry-towner!\" He spat out the word like filth, his pig-eyes narrowing to\nslits. \"Son of the Ape! _Earthman!_\"\n\n\"_Terranan!_\" Someone took up the howl. There was a stir, a rustle, all\nalong the street that had seemed empty, and from nowhere, it seemed, the\nspace in front of me was crowded with shadowy forms, human and\notherwise.\n\n\"Earthman!\"\n\nI felt the muscles across my belly knotting into a band of ice. I didn't\nbelieve I'd given myself away as an Earthman. The bully was using the\ntime-dishonored tactic of stirring up a riot in a hurry, but just the\nsame I looked quickly round, hunting a path of escape.\n\n\"Put your skean in his guts, Spilkar! Grab him!\"\n\n\"Hai-ai! Earthman! _Hai-ai!_\"\n\nIt was the last cry that made me panic. Through the sultry glare at the\nend of the street, I could see the plumed, taloned figures of the\nYa-men, gliding through the banners of smoke. The crowd melted open.\n\nI didn't stop to reflect on the fact--suddenly very obvious--that Rakhal\ncouldn't have been at the fires at all, and that my informant had led me\ninto an open trap, a nest of Ya-men already inside Charin. The crowd\nedged back and muttered, and suddenly I made my choice. I whirled,\nsnatched up the girl in my arms and ran straight toward the advancing\nfigures of the Ya-men.\n\nNobody followed me. I even heard a choked shout that sounded like a\nwarning. I heard the yelping shrieks of the Ya-men grow to a wild howl,\nand at the last minute, when their stiff rustling plumes loomed only a\nfew yards away, I dived sidewise into an alley, stumbled on some rubbish\nand spilled the girl down.\n\n\"Run, kid!\"\n\nShe shook herself like a puppy climbing out of water. Her small fingers\nclosed like a steel trap on my wrist. \"This way,\" she urged in a hasty\nwhisper, and I found myself plunging out the far end of the alley and\ninto the shelter of a street-shrine. The sour stink of incense smarted\nin my nostrils, and I could hear the yelping of the Ya-men as they\nleaped and rustled down the alley, their cold and poisonous eyes\nsearching out the recess where I crouched with the girl.\n\n\"Here,\" she panted, \"stand close to me on the stone--\" I drew back,\nstartled.\n\n\"Oh, don't stop to argue,\" she whimpered. \"Come _here_!\"\n\n\"_Hai-ai!_ Earthman! There he is!\"\n\nThe girl's arms flung round me again. I felt her slight, hard body\npressing on mine and she literally hauled me toward the pattern of\nstones at the center of the shrine. I wouldn't have been human if I\nhadn't caught her closer yet.\n\nThe world reeled. The street disappeared in a cone of spinning lights,\nstars danced crazily, and I plunged down through a widening gulf of\nempty space, locked in the girl's arms. I fell, spun, plunged head over\nheels through tilting lights and shadows that flung us through\neternities of freefall. The yelping of the Ya-men whirled away in\nunimaginable distances, and for a second I felt the unmerciful blackout\nof a power dive, with blood breaking from my nostrils and filling my\nmouth.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ELEVEN\n\n\nLights flared in my eyes.\n\nI was standing solidly on my feet in the street-shrine, but the street\nwas gone. Coils of incense still smudged the air. The God squatted\ntoadlike in his recess. The girl was hanging limp, locked in my clenched\narms. As the floor straightened under my feet I staggered, thrown off\nbalance by the sudden return of the girl's weight, and grabbed blindly\nfor support.\n\n\"Give her to me,\" said a voice, and the girl's sagging body was lifted\nfrom my arms. A strong hand grasped my elbow. I found a chair beneath my\nknees and sank gratefully into it.\n\n\"The transmission isn't smooth yet between such distant terminals,\" the\nvoice remarked. \"I see Miellyn has fainted again. A weakling, the girl,\nbut useful.\"\n\nI spat blood, trying to get the room in focus. For I was inside a room,\na room of some translucent substance, windowless, a skylight high above\nme, through which pink daylight streamed. Daylight--and it had been\nmidnight in Charin! I'd come halfway around the planet in a few seconds!\n\nFrom somewhere I heard the sound of hammering, tiny, bell-like\nhammering, the chiming of a fairy anvil. I looked up and saw a man--a\nman?--watching me.\n\nOn Wolf you see all kinds of human, half-human and nonhuman life, and I\nconsider myself something of an expert on all three. But I had never\nseen anyone, or anything, who so closely resembled the human and so\nobviously wasn't. He, or it, was tall and lean, man-shaped but oddly\nmuscled, a vague suggestion of something less than human in the lean\nhunch of his posture.\n\nManlike, he wore green tight-fitting trunks and a shirt of green fur\nthat revealed bulging biceps where they shouldn't be, and angular planes\nwhere there should have been swelling muscles. The shoulders were high,\nthe neck unpleasantly sinuous, and the face, a little narrower than\nhuman, was handsomely arrogant, with a kind of wary alert mischief that\nwas the least human thing about him.\n\nHe bent, tilted the girl's inert body on to a divan of some sort, and\nturned his back on her, lifting his hand in an impatient, and\nunpleasantly reminiscent, gesture.\n\nThe tinkling of the little hammers stopped as if a switch had been\ndisconnected.\n\n\"Now,\" said the nonhuman, \"we can talk.\"\n\nLike the waif, he spoke Shainsan, and spoke it with a better accent than\nany nonhuman I had ever known--so well that I looked again to be\ncertain. I wasn't too dazed to answer in the same tongue, but I couldn't\nkeep back a spate of questions:\n\n\"What happened? Who are you? What is this place?\"\n\nThe nonhuman waited, crossing his hands--quite passable hands, if you\ndidn't look too closely at what should have been nails--and bent forward\nin a sketchy gesture.\n\n\"Do not blame Miellyn. She acted under orders. It was imperative you be\nbrought here tonight, and we had reason to believe you might ignore an\nordinary summons. You were clever at evading our surveillance, for a\ntime. But there would not be two Dry-towners in Charin tonight who would\ndare the Ghost Wind. Your reputation does you justice, Rakhal Sensar.\"\n\n_Rakhal Sensar!_ Once again Rakhal!\n\nShaken, I pulled a rag from my pocket and wiped blood from my mouth. I'd\nfigured out, in Shainsa, why the mistake was logical. And here in Charin\nI'd been hanging around in Rakhal's old haunts, covering his old trails.\nOnce again, mistaken identity was natural.\n\nNatural or not, I wasn't going to deny it. If these were Rakhal's\nenemies, my real identity should be kept as an ace in reserve which\nmight--just might--get me out alive again. If they were his friends ...\nwell, I could only hope that no one who knew him well by sight would\nwalk in on me.\n\n\"We knew,\" the nonhuman continued, \"that if you remained where you\nwere, the _Terranan_ Cargill would have made his arrest. We know about\nyour quarrel with Cargill, among other things, but we did not consider\nit necessary that you should fall into his hands at present.\"\n\nI was puzzled. \"I still don't understand. Exactly where am I?\"\n\n\"This is the mastershrine of Nebran.\"\n\n_Nebran!_\n\nThe stray pieces of the puzzle suddenly jolted into place. Kyral had\nwarned me, not knowing he was doing it. I hastily imitated the gesture\nKyral had made, gabbling a few words of an archaic charm.\n\nLike every Earthman who's lived on Wolf more than a tourist season, I'd\nseen faces go blank and impassive at mention of the Toad God. Rumor made\nhis spies omnipresent, his priests omniscient, his anger all-powerful. I\nhad believed about a tenth of what I had heard, or less.\n\nThe Terran Empire has little to say to planetary religions, and Nebran's\ncult is a remarkably obscure one, despite the street-shrines on every\ncorner. Now I was in his mastershrine, and the device which had brought\nme here was beyond doubt a working model of a matter transmitter.\n\nA matter transmitter, a working model--the words triggered memory.\nRakhal was after it.\n\n\"And who,\" I asked slowly, \"are you, Lord?\"\n\nThe green-clad creature hunched thin shoulders again in a ceremonious\ngesture. \"I am called Evarin. Humble servant of Nebran and yourself,\" he\nadded, but there was no humility in his manner. \"I am called the\nToymaker.\"\n\n_Evarin._ That was another name given weight by rumor. A breath of\ngossip in a thieves market. A scrawled word on smudged paper. A blank\nfolder in Terran Intelligence. Another puzzle-piece snapped into\nplace--_Toymaker_!\n\nThe girl on the divan sat up suddenly passing slim hands over her\ndisheveled hair. \"Did I faint, Evarin? I had to fight to get him into\nthe stone, and the patterns were not set straight in that terminal. You\nmust send one of the Little Ones to set them to rights. Toymaker, you\nare not listening to me.\"\n\n\"Stop chattering, Miellyn,\" said Evarin indifferently. \"You brought him\nhere, and that is all that matters. You aren't hurt?\"\n\nMiellyn pouted and looked ruefully at her bare bruised feet, patted the\nwrinkles in her ragged frock with fastidious fingers. \"My poor feet,\"\nshe mourned, \"they are black and blue with the cobbles and my hair is\nfilled with sand and tangles! Toymaker, what way was this to send me to\nentice a man? Any man would have come quickly, quickly, if he had seen\nme looking lovely, but you--you send me in rags!\"\n\nShe stamped a small bare foot. She was not merely as young as she had\nlooked in the street. Though immature and underdeveloped by Terran\nstandards, she had a fair figure for a Dry-town woman. Her rags fell now\nin graceful folds. Her hair was spun black glass, and I--I saw what the\nrags and the confusion in the filthy street had kept me from seeing\nbefore.\n\nIt was the girl of the spaceport cafe, the girl who had appeared and\nvanished in the eerie streets of Canarsa.\n\nEvarin was regarding her with what, in a human, might have been rueful\nimpatience. He said, \"You know you enjoyed yourself, as always, Miellyn.\nRun along and make yourself beautiful again, little nuisance.\"\n\nThe girl danced out of the room, and I was just as glad to see her go.\nThe Toymaker motioned to me.\n\n\"This way,\" he directed, and led me through a different door. The\noffstage hammering I had heard, tiny bell tones like a fairy xylophone,\nbegan again as the door opened, and we passed into a workroom which made\nme remember nursery tales from a half-forgotten childhood on Terra. For\nthe workers were tiny, gnarled _trolls_!\n\nThey were _chaks_. _Chaks_ from the polar mountains, dwarfed and furred\nand half-human, with witchlike faces and great golden eyes, and I had\nthe curious feeling that if I looked hard enough I would see the little\ntoy-seller they had hunted out of the Kharsa. I didn't look. I figured I\nwas in enough trouble already.\n\nTiny hammers pattered on miniature anvils in a tinkling, jingling chorus\nof musical clinks and taps. Golden eyes focused like lenses over winking\njewels and gimcracks. Busy elves. Makers of toys!\n\nEvarin jerked his shoulders with an imperative gesture. I followed him\nthrough a fairy workroom, but could not refrain from casting a lingering\nlook at the worktables. A withered leprechaun set eyes into the head of\na minikin hound. Furred fingers worked precious metals into invisible\nfiligree for the collarpiece of a dancing doll. Metallic feathers were\nthrust with clockwork precision into the wings of a skeleton bird no\nlonger than my fingernail. The nose of the hound wabbled and sniffed,\nthe bird's wings quivered, the eyes of the little dancer followed my\nfootsteps.\n\nToys?\n\n\"This way,\" Evarin rapped, and a door slid shut behind us. The clinks\nand taps grew faint, fainter, but never ceased.\n\nMy face must have betrayed more than conventional impassivity, for\nEvarin smiled. \"Now you know, Rakhal, why I am called Toymaker. Is it\nnot strange--the masterpriest of Nebran, a maker of Toys, and the shrine\nof the Toad God a workshop for children's playthings?\"\n\nEvarin paused suggestively. They were obviously not children's\nplaythings and this was my cue to say so, but I avoided the trap. Evarin\nopened a sliding panel and took out a doll.\n\nShe was perhaps the length of my longest finger, molded to the precise\nproportions of a woman, and costumed after the bizarre fashion of the\nArdcarran dancing girls. Evarin touched no button or key that I could\nsee, but when he set the figure on its feet, it executed a whirling,\narmtossing dance in a fast, tricky tempo.\n\n\"I am, in a sense, benevolent,\" Evarin murmured. He snapped his fingers\nand the doll sank to her knees and poised there, silent. \"Moreover, I\nhave the means and, let us say, the ability to indulge my small\nfantasies.\n\n\"The little daughter of the President of the Federation of Trade Cities\non Samarra was sent such a doll recently. What a pity that Paolo\nArimengo was so suddenly impeached and banished!\" The Toymaker clucked\nhis teeth commiseratingly. \"Perhaps this small companion will compensate\nthe little Carmela for her adjustment to her new ... position.\"\n\nHe replaced the dancer and pulled down something like a whirligig. \"This\nmight interest you,\" he mused, and set it spinning. I stared at the\npattern of lights that flowed and disappeared, melting in and out of\nvisible shadows. Suddenly I realized what the thing was doing. I\nwrested my eyes away with an effort. Had there been a lapse of seconds\nor minutes? Had Evarin spoken?\n\nEvarin arrested the compelling motion with one finger. \"Several of these\npretty playthings are available to the children of important men,\" he\nsaid absently. \"An import of value for our exploited and impoverished\nworld. Unfortunately they are, perhaps, a little ... ah, obvious. The\nincidence of nervous breakdowns is, ah, interfering with their sale. The\nchildren, of course, are unaffected, and love them.\" Evarin set the\nhypnotic wheel moving again, glanced sidewise at me, then set it\ncarefully back.\n\n\"Now\"--Evarin's voice, hard with the silkiness of a cat's snarl, clawed\nthe silence--\"we'll talk business.\"\n\nI turned, composing my face. Evarin had something concealed in one hand,\nbut I didn't think it was a weapon. And if I'd known, I'd have had to\nignore it anyway.\n\n\"Perhaps you wonder how we recognized and found you?\" A panel cleared in\nthe wall and became translucent. Confused flickers moved, dropped into\nfocus and I realized that the panel was an ordinary television screen\nand I was looking into the well-known interior of the Cafe of Three\nRainbows in the Trade City of Charin.\n\nBy this time I was running low on curiosity and didn't wonder till much,\nmuch later how televised pictures were transmitted around the curve of a\nplanet. Evarin sharpened the focus down on the long Earth-type bar where\na tall man in Terran clothes was talking to a pale-haired girl. Evarin\nsaid, \"By now, Race Cargill has decided, no doubt, that you fell into\nhis trap and into the hands of the Ya-men. He is off-guard now.\"\n\nAnd suddenly the whole thing seemed so unbearably, illogically funny\nthat my shoulders shook with the effort to keep back dangerous laughter.\nSince I'd landed in Charin, I'd taken great pains to avoid the Trade\nCity, or anyone who might have associated me with it. And Rakhal,\nsomehow aware of this, had conveniently filled up the gap. By posing as\nme.\n\nIt wasn't nearly as difficult as it sounded. I had found that out in\nShainsa. Charin is a long, long way from the major Trade City near the\nKharsa. I hadn't a single intimate friend there, or within hundreds of\nmiles, to see through the imposture. At most, there were half a dozen of\nthe staff that I'd once met, or had a drink with, eight or ten years\nago.\n\nRakhal could speak perfect Standard when he chose; if he lapsed into\nDry-town idiom, that too was in my known character. I had no doubt he\nwas making a great success of it all, probably doing much better with my\nidentity than I could ever have done with his.\n\nEvarin rasped, \"Cargill meant to leave the planet. What stopped him? You\ncould be of use to us, Rakhal. But not with this blood-feud unsettled.\"\n\nThat needed no elucidation. No Wolfan in his right mind will bargain\nwith a Dry-towner carrying an unresolved blood-feud. By law and custom,\ndeclared blood-feud takes precedence over any other business, public or\nprivate, and is sufficient excuse for broken promises, neglected duties,\ntheft, even murder.\n\n\"We want it settled once and for all.\" Evarin's voice was low and\nunhurried. \"And we aren't above weighting the scales. This Cargill can,\nand has, posed as a Dry-towner, undetected. We don't like Earthmen who\ncan do that. In settling your feud, you will be aiding us, and removing\na danger. We would be ... grateful.\"\n\nHe opened his closed hand, displaying something small, curled, inert.\n\n\"Every living thing emits a characteristic pattern of electrical nerve\nimpulses. We have ways of recording those impulses, and we have had you\nand Cargill under observation for a long time. We've had plenty of\nopportunity to key this Toy to Cargill's pattern.\"\n\nOn his palm the curled thing stirred, spread wings. A fledgling bird lay\nthere, small soft body throbbing slightly. Half-hidden in a ruff of\nmetallic feathers I glimpsed a grimly elongated beak. The pinions were\nfeathered with delicate down less than a quarter of an inch long. They\nbeat with delicate insistence against the Toymaker's prisoning fingers.\n\n\"This is not dangerous to you. Press here\"--he showed me--\"and if Race\nCargill is within a certain distance--and it is up to you to be _within_\nthat distance--it will find him, and kill him. Unerringly, inescapably,\nuntraceably. We will not tell you the critical distance. And we will\ngive you three days.\"\n\nHe checked my startled exclamation with a gesture. \"Of course this is a\ntest. Within the hour Cargill will receive a warning. We want no\nincompetents who must be helped too much! Nor do we want cowards! If you\nfail, or release the bird at a distance too great, or evade the\ntest\"--the green inhuman malice in his eyes made me sweat--\"we have made\nanother bird.\"\n\nBy now my brain was swimming, but I thought I understood the complex\ninhuman logic involved. \"The other bird is keyed to me?\"\n\nWith slow contempt Evarin shook his head. \"You? You are used to danger\nand fond of a gamble. Nothing so simple! We have given you three days.\nIf, within that time, the bird you carry has not killed, the other bird\nwill fly. And it will kill. Rakhal, you have a wife.\"\n\nYes, Rakhal had a wife. They could threaten Rakhal's wife. And his wife\nwas my sister Juli.\n\nEverything after that was anticlimax. Of course I had to drink with\nEvarin, the elaborate formal ritual without which no bargain on Wolf is\nconcluded. He entertained me with gory and technical descriptions of the\nway in which the birds, and other of his hellish Toys, did their\nkilling, and worse tasks.\n\nMiellyn danced into the room and upset the exquisite solemnity of the\nwine-ritual by perching on my knee, stealing a sip from my cup, and\npouting prettily when I paid her less attention than she thought she\nmerited. I didn't dare pay much attention, even when she whispered, with\nthe deliberate and thorough wantonness of a Dry-town woman of high-caste\nwho has flung aside her fetters, something about a rendezvous at the\nThree Rainbows.\n\nBut eventually it was over and I stepped through a door that twisted\nwith a giddy blankness, and found myself outside a bare windowless wall\nin Charin again, the night sky starred and cold. The acrid smell of the\nGhost Wind was thinning in the streets, but I had to crouch in a cranny\nof the wall when a final rustling horde of Ya-men, the last of their\nreceding tide, rustled down the street. I found my way to my lodging in\na filthy _chak_ hostel, and threw myself down on the verminous bed.\n\nBelieve it or not, I slept.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWELVE\n\n\nAn hour before dawn there was a noise in my room. I roused, my hand on\nmy skean. Someone or something was fumbling under the mattress where I\nhad thrust Evarin's bird. I struck out, encountered something warm and\nbreathing, and grappled with it in the darkness. A foul-smelling\nsomething gripped over my mouth. I tore it away and struck hard with the\nskean. There was a high shrilling. The gripping filth loosened and fell\naway and something died on the floor.\n\nI struck a light, retching in revulsion. It hadn't been human. There\nwouldn't have been that much blood from a human. Not that color, either.\n\nThe _chak_ who ran the place came and gibbered at me. _Chaks_ have a\nhorror of blood and this one gave me to understand that my lease was up\nthen and there, no arguments, no refunds. He wouldn't even let me go\ninto his stone outbuilding to wash the foul stuff from my shirtcloak. I\ngave up and fished under the mattress for Evarin's Toy.\n\nThe _chak_ got a glimpse of the embroideries on the silk in which it was\nwrapped, and stood back, his loose furry lips hanging open, while I\ngathered my few belongings together and strode out of the room. He would\nnot touch the coins I offered; I laid them on a chest and he let them\nlie there, and as I went into the reddening morning they came flying\nafter me into the street.\n\nI pulled the silk from the Toy and tried to make some sense from my\npredicament. The little thing lay innocent and silent in my palm. It\nwouldn't tell me whether it had been keyed to me, the real Cargill, some\ntime in the past, or to Rakhal, using my name and reputation in the\nTerran Colony here at Charin.\n\nIf I pressed the stud it might play out this comedy of errors by hunting\ndown Rakhal, and all my troubles would be over. For a while, at least,\nuntil Evarin found out what had happened. I didn't deceive myself that I\ncould carry the impersonation through another meeting.\n\nOn the other hand, if I pressed the stud, the bird might turn on me. And\nthen all my troubles would be over for good.\n\nIf I delayed past Evarin's deadline, and did nothing, the other bird in\nhis keeping would hunt down Juli and give her a swift and not too\npainless death.\n\nI spent most of the day in a _chak_ dive, juggling plans. Toys, innocent\nand sinister. Spies, messengers. Toys which killed horribly. Toys which\ncould be controlled, perhaps, by the pliant mind of a child, and every\nchild hates its parents now and again!\n\nEven in the Terran colony, who was safe? In Mack's very home, one of the\nMagnusson youngsters had a shiny thing which might, or might not, be one\nof Evarin's hellish Toys. Or was I beginning to think like a\nsuperstitious Dry-towner?\n\nDamn it, Evarin couldn't be infallible; he hadn't even recognized me as\nRace Cargill! Or--suddenly the sweat broke out, again, on my\nforehead--_or had he_? Had the whole thing been one of those sinister,\ndeadly and incomprehensible nonhuman jokes?\n\nI kept coming to the same conclusion. Juli was in danger, but she was\nhalf a world away. Rakhal was here in Charin. There was a child\ninvolved--Juli's child. The first step was to get inside the Terran\ncolony and see how the land lay.\n\nCharin is a city shaped like a crescent moon, encircling the small Trade\nCity: a miniature spaceport, a miniature skyscraper HQ, the clustered\ndwellings of the Terrans who worked there, and those who lived with them\nand supplied them with necessities, services and luxuries.\n\nEntry from one to the other is through a guarded gateway, since this is\nhostile territory, and Charin lies far beyond the impress of ordinary\nTerran law. But the gate stood wide-open, and the guards looked lax and\nbored. They had shockers, but they didn't look as if they'd used them\nlately.\n\nOne raised an eyebrow at his companion as I shambled up. I could pretty\nwell guess the impression I made, dirty, unkempt and stained with\nnonhuman blood. I asked permission to go into the Terran Zone.\n\nThey asked my name and business, and I toyed with the notion of giving\nthe name of the man I was inadvertently impersonating. Then I decided\nthat if Rakhal had passed himself off as Race Cargill, he'd expect\nexactly that. And he was also capable of the masterstroke of\nimpudence--putting out a pickup order, through Spaceforce, for his own\nname!\n\nSo I gave the name we'd used from Shainsa to Charin, and tacked one of\nthe Secret Service passwords on the end of it. They looked at each other\nagain and one said, \"Rascar, eh? This is the guy, all right.\" He took me\ninto the little booth by the gate while the other used an intercom\ndevice. Presently they took me along into the HQ building, and into an\noffice that said \"Legate.\"\n\nI tried not to panic, but it wasn't easy! Evidently I'd walked square\ninto another trap. One guard asked me, \"All right, now, what exactly is\nyour business in the Trade City?\"\n\nI'd hoped to locate Rakhal first. Now I knew I'd have no chance and at\nall costs I must straighten out this matter of identity before it went\nany further.\n\n\"Put me straight through to Magnusson's office, Level 38 at Central HQ,\nby visi,\" I demanded. I was trying to remember if Mack had ever even\nheard the name we used in Shainsa. I decided I couldn't risk it. \"Name\nof Race Cargill.\"\n\nThe guard grinned without moving. He said to his partner, \"That's the\none, all right.\" He put a hand on my shoulder, spinning me around.\n\n\"Haul off, man. Shake your boots.\"\n\nThere were two of them, and Spaceforce guards aren't picked for their\ngood looks. Just the same, I gave a pretty good account of myself until\nthe inner door opened and a man came storming out.\n\n\"What the devil is all this racket?\"\n\nOne guard got a hammerlock on me. \"This Dry-towner bum tried to talk us\ninto making a priority call to Magnusson, the Chief at Central. He knew\na couple of the S.S. passwords. That's what got him through the gate.\nRemember, Cargill passed the word that somebody would turn up trying to\nimpersonate him.\"\n\n\"I remember.\" The strange man's eyes were wary and cold.\n\n\"You damned fools,\" I snarled. \"Magnusson will identify me! Can't you\nrealize you're dealing with an impostor?\"\n\nOne of the guards said to the legate in an undertone, \"Maybe we ought to\nhold him as a suspicious character.\" But the legate shook his head. \"Not\nworth the trouble. Cargill said it was a private affair. You might\nsearch him, make sure he's not concealing contraband weapons,\" he added,\nand talked softly to the wide-eyed clerk in the background while the\nguards went through my shirtcloak and pockets.\n\nWhen they started to unwrap the silk-shrouded Toy I yelled--if the thing\ngot set off accidentally, there'd be trouble. The legate turned and\nrebuked, \"Can't you see it's embroidered with the Toad God? It's a\nreligious amulet of some sort, let it alone.\"\n\nThey grumbled, but gave it back to me, and the legate commanded, \"Don't\nmess him up any more. Give him back his knife and take him to the gates.\nBut make sure he doesn't come back.\"\n\nI found myself seized and frog-marched to the gate. One guard pushed my\nskean back into its clasp. The other shoved me hard, and I stumbled,\nfell sprawling in the dust of the cobbled street, to the accompaniment\nof a profane statement about what I could expect if I came back. A\nchorus of jeers from a cluster of _chak_ children and veiled women broke\nacross me.\n\nI picked myself up, glowered so fiercely at the giggling spectators that\nthe laughter drained away into silence, and clenched my fists, half\ninclined to turn back and bull my way through. Then I subsided. First\nround to Rakhal. He had sprung the trap on me, very neatly.\n\nThe street was narrow and crooked, winding between doubled rows of\npebble-houses, and full of dark shadows even in the crimson noon. I\nwalked aimlessly, favoring the arm the guard had crushed. I was no\ncloser to settling things with Rakhal, and I had slammed at least one\ngate behind me.\n\nWhy hadn't I had sense enough to walk up and demand to _see_ Race\nCargill? Why hadn't I insisted on a fingerprint check? I could prove my\nidentity, and Rakhal, using my name in my absence, to those who didn't\nknow me by sight, couldn't. I could at least have made him try. But he\nhad maneuvered it very cleverly, so I never had a chance to insist on\nproofs.\n\nI turned into a wineshop and ordered a dram of greenish mountainberry\nliquor, sipping it slowly and fingering the few bills and coins in my\npockets. I'd better forget about warning Juli. I couldn't 'vise her from\nCharin, except in the Terran zone. I had neither the money nor the time\nto make the trip in person, even if I could get passage on a\nTerran-dominated airline after today.\n\nMiellyn. She had flirted with me, and like Dallisa, she might prove\nvulnerable. It might be another trap, but I'd take the chance. At least\nI could get hints about Evarin. And I needed information. I wasn't used\nto this kind of intrigue any more. The smell of danger was foreign to me\nnow, and I found it unpleasant.\n\nThe small lump of the bird in my pocket tantalized me. I took it out\nagain. It was a temptation to press the stud and let it settle things,\nor at least start them going, then and there.\n\nAfter a while I noticed the proprietors of the shop staring at the silk\nof the wrappings. They backed off, apprehensive. I held out a coin and\nthey shook their heads. \"You are welcome to the drink,\" one of them\nsaid. \"All we have is at your service. Only please go. Go quickly.\"\n\nThey would not touch the coins I offered. I thrust the bird in my\npocket, swore and went. It was my second experience with being somehow\ntabu, and I didn't like it.\n\nIt was dusk when I realized I was being followed.\n\nAt first it was a glimpse out of the corner of my eye, a head seen too\nfrequently for coincidence. It developed into a too-persistent footstep\nin uneven rhythm.\n\nTap-_tap_-tap. Tap-_tap_-tap.\n\nI had my skean handy, but I had a hunch this wasn't anything I could\nsettle with a skean. I ducked into a side street and waited.\n\nNothing.\n\nI went on, laughing at my imagined fears.\n\nThen, after a time, the soft, persistent footfall thudded behind me\nagain.\n\nI cut across a thieves market, dodging from stall to stall, cursed by\nold women selling hot fried goldfish, women in striped veils railing at\nme in their chiming talk when I brushed their rolled rugs with hasty\nfeet. Far behind I heard the familiar uneven hurry: tap-_tap_-tap,\ntap-_tap_-tap.\n\nI fled down a street where women sat on flower-decked balconies, their\nopen lanterns flowing with fountains and rivulets of gold and orange\nfire. I raced through quiet streets where furred children crept to doors\nand watched me pass with great golden eyes that shone in the dark.\n\nI dodged into an alley and lay there, breathing hard. Someone not two\ninches away said, \"Are you one of us, brother?\"\n\nI muttered something surly, in his dialect, and a hand, reassuringly\nhuman, closed on my elbow. \"This way.\"\n\nOut of breath with long running, I let him lead me, meaning to break\naway after a few steps, apologize for mistaken identity and vanish, when\na sound at the end of the street made me jerk stiff and listen.\n\nTap-_tap_-tap. Tap-_tap_-tap.\n\nI let my arm relax in the hand that guided me, flung a fold of my\nshirtcloak over my face, and went along with my unknown guide.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN\n\n\nI stumbled over steps, took a jolting stride downward, and found myself\nin a dim room jammed with dark figures, human and nonhuman.\n\nThe figures swayed in the darkness, chanting in a dialect not altogether\nfamiliar to me, a monotonous wailing chant, with a single recurrent\nphrase: \"Kamaina! Kama-aina!\" It began on a high note, descending in\nweird chromatics to the lowest tone the human ear could resolve.\n\nThe sound made me draw back. Even the Dry-towners shunned the orgiastic\nrituals of Kamaina. Earthmen have a reputation for getting rid of the\nmore objectionable customs--by human standards--on any planet where they\nlive. But they don't touch religions, and Kamaina, on the surface\nanyhow, was a religion.\n\nI started to turn round and leave, as if I had inadvertently walked\nthrough the wrong door, but my conductor hauled on my arm, and I was\nwedged in too tight by now to risk a roughhouse. Trying to force my way\nout would only have called attention to me, and the first of the Secret\nService maxims is; when in doubt, go along, keep quiet, and watch the\nother guy.\n\nAs my eyes adapted to the dim light, I saw that most of the crowd were\nCharin plainsmen or _chaks_. One or two wore Dry-town shirtcloaks, and I\neven thought I saw an Earthman in the crowd, though I was never sure and\nI fervently hope not. They were squatting around small crescent-shaped\ntables, and all intently gazing at a flickery spot of light at the front\nof the cellar. I saw an empty place at one table and dropped there,\nfinding the floor soft, as if cushioned.\n\nOn each table, small smudging pastilles were burning, and from these\ncones of ash-tipped fire came the steamy, swimmy smoke that filled the\ndarkness with strange colors. Beside me an immature _chak_ girl was\nkneeling, her fettered hands strained tightly back at her sides, her\nnaked breasts pierced for jeweled rings.\n\nBeneath the pallid fur around her pointed ears, the exquisite animal\nface was quite mad. She whispered to me, but her dialect was so thick\nthat I could follow only a few words, and would just as soon not have\nheard those few. An older _chak_ grunted for silence and she subsided,\nswaying and crooning.\n\nThere were cups and decanters on all the tables, and a woman tilted\npale, phosphorescent fluid into a cup and offered it to me. I took one\nsip, then another. It was cold and pleasantly tart, and not until the\nsecond swallow turned sweet on my tongue did I know what I tasted. I\npretended to swallow while the woman's eyes were fixed on me, then\nsomehow contrived to spill the filthy stuff down my shirt.\n\nI was wary even of the fumes, but there was nothing else I could do. The\nstuff was _shallavan_, outlawed on every planet in the Terran Empire and\nevery halfway decent planet outside it.\n\nMore and more figures, men and creatures, kept crowding into the cellar,\nwhich was not very large. The place looked like the worst nightmare of a\ndrug-dreamer, ablaze with the colors of the smoking incense, the swaying\ncrowd, and their monotonous cries. Quite suddenly there was a blaze of\npurple light and someone screamed in raving ecstasy: \"_Na ki na Nebran\nn'hai Kamaina!_\"\n\n\"Kamayeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeena!\" shrilled the tranced mob.\n\nAn old man jumped up and started haranguing the crowd. I could just\nfollow his dialect. He was talking about Terra. He was talking about\nriots. He was jabbering mystical gibberish which I couldn't understand\nand didn't want to understand, and rabble-rousing anti-Terran propaganda\nwhich I understood much too well.\n\nAnother blaze of lights and another long scream in chorus:\n\"Kamayeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeena!\"\n\nEvarin stood in the blaze of the many-colored light.\n\nThe Toymaker, as I had seen him last, cat-smooth, gracefully alien,\nshrouded in a ripple of giddy crimsons. Behind him was a blackness. I\nwaited till the painful blaze of lights abated, then, straining my eyes\nto see past him, I got my worst shock.\n\nA woman stood there, naked to the waist, her hands ritually fettered\nwith little chains that stirred and clashed musically as she moved\nstiff-legged in a frozen dream. Hair like black grass banded her brow\nand naked shoulders, and her eyes were crimson.\n\nAnd the eyes lived in the dead dreaming face. They lived, and they were\nmad with terror although the lips curved in a gently tranced smile.\n\nMiellyn.\n\nEvarin was speaking in that dialect I barely understood. His arms were\nflung high and his cloak went spilling away from them, rippling like\nsomething alive. The jammed humans and nonhumans swayed and chanted and\nhe swayed above them like an iridescent bug, weaving arms rippling back\nand forth, back and forth. I strained to catch his words.\n\n\"Our world ... an old world.\"\n\n\"Kamayeeeeena,\" whimpered the shrill chorus.\n\n\"... humans, humans, all humans would make slaves of us all, all save\nthe Children of the Ape....\"\n\nI lost the thread for a moment. True. The Terran Empire has one small\nblind spot in otherwise sane policy, ignoring that nonhuman and human\nhave lived placidly here for millennia: they placidly assumed that\nhumans were everywhere the dominant race, as on Earth itself.\n\nThe Toymaker's weaving arms went on spinning, spinning. I rubbed my eyes\nto clear them of _shallavan_ and incense. I hoped that what I saw was an\nillusion of the drug--something, something huge and dark, was hovering\nover the girl. She stood placidly, hands clasped on her chains, but her\neyes writhed in the frozen calm of her face.\n\nThen something--I can only call it a sixth sense--bore it on me that\nthere was _someone_ outside the door. I was perhaps the only creature\nthere, except for Evarin, not drugged with _shallavan_, and perhaps\nthat's all it was. But during the days in the Secret Service I'd had to\ndevelop some extra senses. Five just weren't enough for survival.\n\nI _knew_ somebody was fixing to break down that door, and I had a good\nidea why. I'd been followed, by the legate's orders, and, tracking me\nhere, they'd gone away and brought back reinforcements.\n\nSomeone struck a blow on the door and a stentorian voice bawled, \"Open\nup there, in the name of the Empire!\"\n\nThe chanting broke in ragged quavers. Evarin stopped. Somewhere a woman\nscreamed. The lights abruptly went out and a stampede started in the\nroom. Women struck me with chains, men kicked, there were shrieks and\nhowls. I thrust my way forward, butting with elbows and knees and\nshoulders.\n\nA dusky emptiness yawned and I got a glimpse of sunlight and open sky\nand knew that Evarin had stepped through into _somewhere_ and was gone.\nThe banging on the door sounded like a whole regiment of Spaceforce out\nthere. I dived toward the shimmer of little stars which marked Miellyn's\ntiara in the darkness, braving the black horror hovering over her, and\ntouched rigid girl-flesh, cold as death.\n\nI grabbed her and ducked sideways. This time it wasn't intuition--nine\ntimes out of ten, anyway, intuition is just a mental shortcut which adds\nup all the things which your subconscious has noticed while you were\nbusy thinking about something else. Every native building on Wolf had\nconcealed entrances and exits and I know where to look for them. This\none was exactly where I expected. I pushed at it and found myself in a\nlong, dim corridor.\n\nThe head of a woman peered from an opening door. She saw Miellyn's limp\nbody hanging on my arm and her mouth widened in a silent scream. Then\nthe head popped back out of sight and a door slammed. I heard the bolt\nslide. I ran for the end of the hall, the girl in my arms, thinking that\nthis was where I came in, as far as Miellyn was concerned, and wondering\nwhy I bothered.\n\nThe door opened on a dark, peaceful street. One lonely moon was setting\nbeyond the rooftops. I set Miellyn on her feet, but she moaned and\ncrumpled against me. I put my shirtcloak around her bare shoulders.\nJudging by the noises and yells, we'd gotten out just in time. No one\ncame out the exit behind us. Either the Spaceforce had plugged it or,\nmore likely, everyone else in the cellar had been too muddled by drugs\nto know what was going on.\n\nBut it was only a few minutes, I knew, before Spaceforce would check the\nwhole building for concealed escape holes. Suddenly, and irrelevantly, I\nfound myself thinking of a day not too long ago, when I'd stood up in\nfront of a unit-in-training of Spaceforce, introduced to them as an\nIntelligence expert on native towns, and solemnly warned them about\nconcealed exits and entrances. I wondered, for half a minute, if it\nmight not be simpler just to wait here and let them pick me up.\n\nThen I hoisted Miellyn across my shoulders. She was heavier than she\nlooked, and after a minute, half conscious, she began to struggle and\nmoan. There was a _chak_-run cookshop down the street, a place I'd once\nknown well, with an evil reputation and worse food, but it was quiet and\nstayed open all night. I turned in at the door, bending at the low\nlintel.\n\nThe place was smoke-filled and foul-smelling. I dumped Miellyn on a\ncouch and sent the frowsy waiter for two bowls of noodles and coffee,\nhanded him a few extra coins, and told him to leave us alone. He\nprobably drew the worst possible inference--I saw his muzzle twitch at\nthe smell of _shallavan_--but it was that kind of place anyhow. He drew\ndown the shutters and went.\n\nI stared at the unconscious girl, then shrugged and started on the\nnoodles. My own head was still swimmy with the fumes, incense and drug,\nand I wanted it clear. I wasn't quite sure what I was going to do, but\nI had Evarin's right-hand girl, and I was going to use her.\n\nThe noodles were greasy and had a curious taste, but they were hot, and\nI ate all of one bowl before Miellyn stirred and whimpered and put up\none hand, with a little clinking of chains, to her hair. The gesture was\nindefinably reminiscent of Dallisa, and for the first time I saw the\nlikeness between them. It made me wary and yet curiously softened.\n\nFinding she could not move freely, she rolled over, sat up and stared\naround in growing bewilderment and dismay.\n\n\"There was a sort of riot,\" I said. \"I got you out. Evarin ditched you.\nAnd you can quit thinking what you're thinking, I put my shirtcloak on\nyou because you were bare to the waist and it didn't look so good.\" I\nstopped to think that over, and amended: \"I mean I couldn't haul you\naround the streets that way. It looked good enough.\"\n\nTo my surprise, she gave a shaky little giggle, and held out her\nfettered hands. \"Will you?\"\n\nI broke her links and freed her. She rubbed her wrists as if they hurt\nher, then drew up her draperies, pinned them so that she was decently\ncovered, and tossed back my shirtcloak. Her eyes were wide and soft in\nthe light of the flickering stub of candle.\n\n\"O, Rakhal,\" she sighed. \"When I saw you there--\" She sat up, clasping\nher hands hard together, and when she continued her voice was curiously\ncold and controlled for anyone so childish. It was almost as cold as\nDallisa's.\n\n\"If you've come from Kyral, I'm not going back. I'll never go back, and\nyou may as well know it.\"\n\n\"I don't come from Kyral, and I don't care where you go. I don't care\nwhat you do.\" I suddenly realized that the last statement was wholly\nuntrue, and to cover my confusion I shoved the remaining bowl of noodles\nat her.\n\n\"Eat.\"\n\nShe wrinkled her nose in fastidious disgust. \"I'm not hungry.\"\n\n\"Eat it anyway. You're still half doped, and the food will clear your\nhead.\" I picked up one mug of the coffee and drained it at a single\nswallow. \"What were you doing in that disgusting den?\"\n\nWithout warning she flung herself across the table at me, throwing her\narms round my neck. Startled, I let her cling a moment, then reached up\nand firmly unfastened her hands.\n\n\"None of that now. I fell for it once, and it landed me in the middle of\nthe mudpie.\"\n\nBut her fingers bit my shoulder.\n\n\"Rakhal, Rakhal, I tried to get away and find you. Have you still got\nthe bird? You haven't set it off yet? Oh, don't, don't, don't, Rakhal,\nyou don't know what Evarin is, you don't know what he's doing.\" The\nwords spilled out of her like floodwaters. \"He's won so many of you,\ndon't let him have you too, Rakhal. They call you an honest man, you\nworked once for Terra, the Terrans would believe you if you went to them\nand told them what he--Rakhal, take me to the Terran Zone, take me\nthere, take me there where they'll protect me from Evarin.\"\n\nAt first I tried to stop her, question her, then waited and let the\ntorrent of entreaty run on and on. At last, exhausted and breathless,\nshe lay quietly against my shoulder, her head fallen forward. The musty\nreek of _shallavan_ mingled with the flower scent of her hair.\n\n\"Kid,\" I said heavily at last, \"you and your Toymaker have both got me\nwrong. I'm not Rakhal Sensar.\"\n\n\"You're not?\" She drew back, regarding me in dismay. Her eyes searched\nevery inch of me, from the gray streak across my forehead to the scar\nrunning down into my collar. \"Then who--\"\n\n\"Race Cargill. Terran Intelligence.\"\n\nShe stared, her mouth wide like a child's.\n\nThen she laughed. She _laughed_! At first I thought she was hysterical.\nI stared at her in consternation. Then, as her wide eyes met mine, with\nall the mischief of the nonhuman which has mingled into the human here,\nall the circular complexities of Wolf illogic behind the woman in them,\nI started to laugh too.\n\nI threw back my head and roared, until we were clinging together and\ngasping with mirth like a pair of raving fools. The _chak_ waiter came\nto the door and stared at us, and I roared \"Get the hell out,\" between\nspasms of crazy laughter.\n\nThen she was wiping her face, tears of mirth still dripping down her\ncheeks, and I was frowning bleakly into the empty bowls.\n\n\"Cargill,\" she said hesitantly, \"you can take me to the Terrans where\nRakhal--\"\n\n\"Hell's bells,\" I exploded. \"I can't take you anywhere, girl. I've got\nto find Rakhal--\" I stopped in midsentence and looked at her clearly for\nthe first time.\n\n\"Child, I'll see that you're protected, if I can. But I'm afraid you've\nwalked from the trap to the cookpot. There isn't a house in Charin that\nwill hold me. I've been thrown out twice today.\"\n\nShe nodded. \"I don't know how the word spreads, but it happens, in\nnonhuman parts. I think they can see trouble written in a human face, or\nsmell it on the wind.\" She fell silent, her face propped sleepily\nbetween her hands, her hair falling in tangles. I took one of her hands\nin mine and turned it over.\n\nIt was a fine hand, with birdlike bones and soft rose-tinted nails; but\nthe lines and hardened places around the knuckles reminded me that she,\ntoo, came from the cold austerity of the salt Dry-towns. After a moment\nshe flushed and drew her hand from mine.\n\n\"What are you thinking, Cargill?\" she asked, and for the first time I\nheard her voice sobered, without the coquetry, which must after all have\nbeen a very thin veneer.\n\nI answered her simply and literally. \"I am thinking of Dallisa. I\nthought you were very different, and yet, I see that you are very like\nher.\"\n\nI thought she would question what I knew of her sister, but she let it\npass in silence. After a time she said, \"Yes, we were twins.\" Then,\nafter a long silence, she added, \"But she was always much the older.\"\n\nAnd that was all I ever knew of whatever obscure pressures had shaped\nDallisa into an austere and tragic Clytemnestra, and Miellyn into a\npixie runaway.\n\nOutside the drawn shutters, dawn was brightening. Miellyn shivered,\ndrawing her thin draperies around her bare throat. I glanced at the\nlittle rim of jewels that starred her hair and said, \"You'd better take\nthose off and hide them. They alone would be enough to have you hauled\ninto an alley and strangled, in this part of Charin.\" I hauled the bird\nToy from my pocket and slapped it on the greasy table, still wrapped in\nits silk. \"I don't suppose you know which of us this thing is set to\nkill?\"\n\n\"I know nothing about the Toys.\"\n\n\"You seem to know plenty about the Toymaker.\"\n\n\"I thought so. Until last night.\" I looked at the rigid, clamped mouth\nand thought that if she were really as soft and delicate as she looked,\nshe would have wept. Then she struck her small hand on the tabletop and\nburst out, \"It's not a religion. It isn't even an honest movement for\nfreedom! Its a--a front for smuggling, and drugs, and--and every other\nfilthy thing!\n\n\"Believe it or not, when I left Shainsa, I thought Nebran was the answer\nto the way the Terrans were strangling us! Now I know there are worse\nthings on Wolf than the Terran Empire! I've heard of Rakhal Sensar, and\nwhatever you may think of Rakhal, he's too decent to be mixed up in\nanything like this!\"\n\n\"Suppose you tell me what's really going on,\" I suggested. She couldn't\nadd much to what I knew already, but the last fragments of the pattern\nwere beginning to settle into place. Rakhal, seeking the matter\ntransmitter and some key to the nonhuman sciences of Wolf--I knew now\nwhat the city of Silent Ones had reminded me of!--had somehow crossed\nthe path of the Toymaker.\n\nEvarin's words now made sense: \"_You were clever at evading our\nsurveillance--for a while._\" Possibly, though I'd never know, Cuinn had\nbeen keeping one foot in each camp, working for Kyral and for Evarin.\nThe Toymaker, knowing of Rakhal's anti-Terran activities, had believed\nhe would make a valuable ally and had taken steps to secure his help.\n\nJuli herself had given me the clue: \"_He smashed Rindy's Toys._\" Out of\nthe context it sounded like the work of a madman. Now, having\nencountered Evarin's workshop, it made plain good sense.\n\nAnd I think I had known all along that Rakhal could not have been\nplaying Evarin's game. He might have turned against Terra--though now I\nwas beginning even to doubt that--and certainly he'd have killed me if\nhe found me. But he would have done it himself, and without malice.\n_Killed without malice_--that doesn't make sense in any of the\nlanguages of Terra. But it made sense to me.\n\nMiellyn had finished her brief recitation and was drowsing, her head\npillowed on the table. The reddish light was growing, and I realized\nthat I was waiting for dawn as, days ago, I had waited for sunset in\nShainsa, with every nerve stretched to the breaking point. It was dawn\nof the third morning, and this bird lying on the table before me must\nfly or, far away in the Kharsa, another would fly at Juli.\n\nI said, \"There's some distance limitation on this one, I understand,\nsince I have to be fairly near its object. If I lock it in a steel box\nand drop it in the desert, I'll guarantee it won't bother anybody. I\ndon't suppose you'd have a shot at stealing the other one for me?\"\n\nShe raised her head, eyes flashing. \"Why should you worry about Rakhal's\nwife?\" she flared, and for no good reason it occurred to me that she was\njealous. \"I might have known Evarin wouldn't shoot in the dark! Rakhal's\nwife, that Earthwoman, what do you care for her?\"\n\nIt seemed important to set her straight. I explained that Juli was my\nsister, and saw a little of the tension fade from her face, but not all.\nRemembering the custom of the Dry-towns, I was not wholly surprised when\nshe added, jealously, \"When I heard of your feud, I guessed it was over\nthat woman!\"\n\n\"But not in the way you think,\" I said. Juli had been part of it,\ncertainly. Even then I had not wanted her to turn her back on her world,\nbut if Rakhal had remained with Terra, I would have accepted his\nmarriage to Juli. Accepted it. I'd have rejoiced. God knows we had been\ncloser than brothers, those years in the Dry-towns. And then, before\nMiellyn's flashing eyes, I suddenly faced my secret hate, my secret\nfear. No, the quarrel had not been all Rakhal's doing.\n\nHe had not turned his back, unexplained on Terra. In some unrecognized\nfashion, I had done my best to drive him away. And when he had gone, I\nhad banished a part of myself as well, and thought I could end the\nstruggle by saying it didn't exist. And now, facing what I had done to\nall of us, I knew that my revenge--so long sought, so dearly\ncherished--must be abandoned.\n\n\"We still have to deal with the bird,\" I said. \"It's a gamble, with all\nthe cards wild.\" I could dismantle it, and trust to luck that Wolf\nillogic didn't include a tamper mechanism. But that didn't seem worth\nthe risk.\n\n\"First I've got to _find_ Rakhal. If I set the bird free and it killed\nhim, it wouldn't settle anything.\" For I could not kill Rakhal. Not,\nnow, because I knew life would be a worse punishment than death. But\nbecause--I knew it, now--if Rakhal died, Juli would die, too. And if I\nkilled him I'd be killing the best part of myself. Somehow Rakhal and I\nmust strike a balance between our two worlds, and try to build a new one\nfrom them.\n\n\"And I can't sit here and talk any longer. I haven't time to take you--\"\nI stopped, remembering the spaceport cafe at the edge of the Kharsa.\nThere was a street-shrine, or matter transmitter, right there, across\nthe street from the Terran HQ. _All these years...._\n\n\"You know your way in the transmitters. You can go there in a second or\ntwo.\" She could warn Juli, tell Magnusson. But when I suggested this,\ngiving her a password that would take her straight to the top, she\nturned white. \"All jumps have to be made through the Mastershrine.\"\n\nI stopped and thought about that.\n\n\"Where is Evarin likely to be, right now?\"\n\nShe gave a nervous shudder. \"He's everywhere!\"\n\n\"Rubbish! He's not omniscient! Why, you little fool, he didn't even\nrecognize me. He thought I was Rakhal!\" I wasn't too sure, myself, but\nMiellyn needed reassurance. \"Or take _me_ to the Mastershrine. I can\nfind Rakhal in that scanning device of Evarin's.\" I saw refusal in her\nface and pushed on, \"If Evarin's there, I'll prove he's fallible enough\nwith a skean in his throat! And here\"--I thrust the Toy into her\nhand--\"hang on to this, will you?\"\n\nShe put it matter-of-factly into her draperies. \"I don't mind that. But\nto the shrine--\" Her voice quivered, and I stood up and pushed at the\ntable.\n\n\"Let's get going. Where's the nearest street-shrine?\"\n\n\"No, no! Oh, I don't dare!\"\n\n\"You've got to.\" I saw the _chak_ who owned the place edging round the\ndoor again and said, \"There's no use arguing, Miellyn.\" When she had\nreadjusted her robes a little while ago, she had pinned them so that\nthe flat sprawl of the Nebran embroideries was over her breasts. I put a\nfinger against them, not in a sensuous gesture, and said, \"The minute\nthey see these, they'll throw us out of here, too.\"\n\n\"If you knew what I know of Nebran, you wouldn't _want_ me to go near\nthe Mastershrine again!\" There was that faint coquettishness in her\nsidewise smile.\n\nAnd suddenly I realized that I didn't want her to. But she was not\nDallisa and she could not sit in cold dignity while her world fell into\nruin. Miellyn must fight for the one she wanted.\n\nAnd then some of that primitive male hostility which lives in every man\ncame to the surface, and I gripped her arm until she whimpered. Then I\nsaid, in the Shainsan which still comes to my tongue when moved or\nangry, \"Damn it, you're _going_. Have you forgotten that if it weren't\nfor me you'd have been torn to pieces by that raving mob, or something\nworse?\"\n\nThat did it. She pulled away and I saw again, beneath the veneer of\npetulant coquetry, that fierce and untamable insolence of the\nDry-towner. The more fierce and arrogant, in this girl, because she had\nburst her fettered hands free and shaken off the ruin of the past.\n\nI was seized with a wildly inappropriate desire to seize her, crush her\nin my arms, taste the red honey of that teasing mouth. The effort of\nmastering the impulse made me rough.\n\nI shoved at her and said, \"Come on. Let's get there before Evarin does.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN\n\n\nOutside in the streets it was full day, and the color and life of Charin\nhad subsided into listlessness again, a dim morning dullness and\nsilence. Only a few men lounged wearily in the streets, as if the sun\nhad sapped their energy. And always the pale fleecy-haired children,\nhuman and furred nonhuman, played their mysterious games on the curbs\nand gutters and staring at us with neither curiosity nor malice.\n\nMiellyn was shaking when she set her feet into the patterned stones of\nthe street-shrine.\n\n\"Scared, Miellyn?\"\n\n\"I know Evarin. You don't. But\"--her mouth twitched in a pitiful attempt\nat the old mischief--\"when I am with a great and valorous Earthman....\"\n\n\"Cut it out,\" I growled, and she giggled. \"You'll have to stand closer\nto me. The transmitters are meant only for one person.\"\n\nI stooped and put my arms round her. \"Like this?\"\n\n\"Like this,\" she whispered, pressing herself against me. A staggering\nwhirl of dizzy darkness swung round my head. The street vanished. After\nan instant the floor steadied and we stepped into the terminal room in\nthe Mastershrine, under a skylight dim with the last red slant of\nsunset. Distant hammering noises rang in my ears.\n\nMiellyn whispered, \"Evarin's not here, but he might jump through at any\nsecond.\" I wasn't listening.\n\n\"Where is this place, Miellyn? Where on the planet?\"\n\n\"No one knows but Evarin, I think. There are no doors. Anyone who goes\nin or out, jumps through the transmitter.\" She pointed. \"The scanning\ndevice is in there, we'll have to go through the workroom.\"\n\nShe was patting her crushed robes into place, smoothing her hair with\nfastidious fingers. \"I don't suppose you have a comb? I've no time to go\nto my own--\"\n\nI'd known she was a vain and pampered brat, but this passed all reason,\nand I said so, exploding at her. She looked at me as if I wasn't quite\nintelligent. \"The Little Ones, my friend, notice things. You are quite\nenough of a roughneck, but if I, Nebran's priestess, walk through their\nworkroom all blown about and looking like the tag end of an orgy in\nArdcarran....\"\n\nAbashed, I fished in a pocket and offered her a somewhat battered pocket\ncomb. She looked at it distastefully but used it to good purpose,\nsmoothing her hair swiftly, rearranging her loose-pinned robe so that\nthe worst of the tears and stains were covered, and giving me,\nmeanwhile, an artless and rather tempting view of some delicious\ncurvature. She replaced the starred tiara on her ringlets and finally\nopened the door of the workroom and we walked through.\n\nNot for years had I known that particular sensation--thousands of eyes,\nboring holes in the center of my back somewhere. There _were_ eyes; the\nround inhuman orbs of the dwarf _chaks_, the faceted stare of the prism\neyes of the Toys. The workroom wasn't a hundred feet long, but it felt\nlonger than a good many miles I've walked. Here and there the dwarfs\nmurmured an obsequious greeting to Miellyn, and she made some\nlighthearted answer.\n\nShe had warned me to walk as if I had every right to be there, and I\nstrode after her as if we were simply going to an agreed-on meeting in\nthe next room. But I was drenched with cold sweat before the farther\ndoor finally closed, safe and blessedly opaque, behind us. Miellyn, too,\nwas shaking with fright, and I put a hand on her arm.\n\n\"Steady, kid. Where's the scanner?\"\n\nShe touched the panel I'd seen. \"I'm not sure I can focus it accurately.\nEvarin never let me touch it.\"\n\nThis was a fine time to tell me that. \"How does it work?\"\n\n\"It's an adaptation of the transmitter principle. It lets you see\nanywhere, but without jumping. It uses a tracer mechanism like the one\nin the Toys. If Rakhal's electrical-impulse pattern were on file--just a\nminute.\" She fished out the bird Toy and unwrapped it. \"Here's how we\nfind out which of you this is keyed to.\"\n\nI looked at the fledgling bird, lying innocently in her palm, as she\npushed aside the feathers, exposing a tiny crystal. \"If it's keyed to\nyou, you'll see yourself in this, as if the screen were a mirror. If\nit's keyed to Rakhal....\"\n\nShe touched the crystal to the surface of the screen. Little flickers of\nsnow wavered and danced. Then, abruptly, we were looking down from a\nheight at the lean back of a man in a leather jacket. Slowly he turned.\nI saw the familiar set of his shoulders, saw the back of his head come\ninto an aquiline profile, and the profile turn slowly into a scarred,\nseared mask more hideously claw-marked and disfigured than my own.\n\n\"Rakhal,\" I muttered. \"Shift the focus if you can, Miellyn, get a look\nout the window or something. Charin's a big city. If we could get a look\nat a landmark--\"\n\nRakhal was talking soundlessly, his lips moving as he spoke to someone\nout of sight range of the scanning device. Abruptly Miellyn said,\n\"There.\" She had caught a window in the sight field of the pane. I could\nsee a high pylon and two of three uprights that looked like a bridge,\njust outside. I said, \"It's the Bridge of Summer Snows. I know where he\nis now. Turn it off, Miellyn, we can find him--\" I was turning away when\nMiellyn screamed.\n\n\"Look!\"\n\nRakhal had turned his back on the scanner and for the first time I could\nsee who he was talking to. A hunched, catlike shoulder twisted; a\nsinuous neck, a high-held head that was not quite human.\n\n\"Evarin!\" I swore. \"That does it. He knows now that I'm not Rakhal, if\nhe didn't know it all along! Come on, girl, we're getting out of here!\"\n\nThis time there was no pretense of normality as we dashed through the\nworkroom. Fingers dropped from half-completed Toys as they stared after\nus. _Toys!_ I wanted to stop and smash them all. But if we hurried, we\nmight find Rakhal. And, with luck, we would find Evarin with him.\n\nAnd then I was going to bang their heads together. I'd reached a\nsaturation point on adventure. I'd had all I wanted. I realized that I'd\nbeen up all night, that I was exhausted. I wanted to murder and smash,\nand wanted to fall down somewhere and go to sleep, all at once. We\nbanged the workroom door shut and I took time to shove a heavy divan\nagainst it, blockading it.\n\nMiellyn stared. \"The Little Ones would not harm me,\" she began. \"I am\nsacrosanct.\"\n\nI wasn't sure. I had a notion her status had changed plenty, beginning\nwhen I saw her chained and drugged, and standing under the hovering\nhorror. But I didn't say so.\n\n\"Maybe. But there's nothing sacred about _me_!\"\n\nShe was already inside the recess where the Toad God squatted. \"There is\na street-shrine just beyond the Bridge of Summer Snows. We can jump\ndirectly there.\" Abruptly she froze in my arms, with a convulsive\nshudder.\n\n\"Evarin! Hold me, tight--he's jumping in! Quick!\"\n\nSpace reeled round us, and then....\n\nCan you split instantaneousness into fragments? It didn't make sense,\nbut so help me, that's what happened. And everything that happened,\noccurred within less than a second. We landed in the street-shrine. I\ncould see the pylon and the bridge and the rising sun of Charin. Then\nthere was the giddy internal wrenching, a blast of icy air whistled\nround us, and we were gazing out at the Polar mountains, ringed in their\neternal snow.\n\nMiellyn clutched at me. \"Pray! Pray to the Gods of Terra, if there are\nany!\"\n\nShe clung so violently that it felt as if her small body was trying to\npush through me and come out the other side. I hung on tight. Miellyn\nknew what she was doing in the transmitter; I was just along for the\nride and I didn't relish the thought of being dropped off somewhere in\nthat black limbo we traversed.\n\nWe jumped again, the sickness of disorientation forcing a moan from the\ngirl, and darkness shivered round us. I looked on an unfamiliar street\nof black night and dust-bleared stars. She whimpered, \"Evarin knows what\nI'm doing. He's jumping us all over the planet. He can work the controls\nwith his mind. Psychokinetics--I can do it a little, but I never\ndared--oh, hang on _tight_!\"\n\nThen began one of the most amazing duels ever fought. Miellyn would make\nsome tiny movement, and we would be falling, blind and dizzy, through\nblackness. Halfway through the giddiness, a new direction would wrench\nus and we would be thrust elsewhere, and look out into a new street.\n\nOne instant I smelled hot coffee from the spaceport cafe near the\nKharsa. An instant later it was blinding noon, with crimson fronds\nwaving above us and a dazzle of water. We flicked in and out of the\nsalty air of Shainsa, glimpsed flowers on a Daillon street, moonlight,\nnoon, red twilight flickered and went, shot through with the terrible\ngiddiness of hyperspace.\n\nThen suddenly I caught a second glimpse of the bridge and the pylon; a\nmoment's oversight had landed us for an instant in Charin. The blackness\nstarted to reel down, but my reflexes are fast and I made one swift,\nscrabbling step forward. We lurched, sprawled, locked together, on the\nstones of the Bridge of Summer Snows. Battered, and bruised, and\nbloody, we were still alive, and where we wanted to be.\n\nI lifted Miellyn to her feet. Her eyes were dazed with pain. The ground\nswayed and rocked under our feet as we fled along the bridge. At the far\nend, I looked up at the pylon. Judging from its angle, we couldn't be\nmore than a hundred feet from the window through which I'd seen that\nlandmark in the scanner. In this street there was a wineshop, a silk\nmarket, and a small private house. I walked up and banged on the door.\n\nSilence. I knocked again and had time to wonder if we'd find ourselves\nexplaining things to some uninvolved stranger. Then I heard a child's\nhigh voice, and a deep familiar voice hushing it. The door opened, just\na crack, to reveal part of a scarred face.\n\nIt drew into a hideous grin, then relaxed.\n\n\"I thought it might be you, Cargill. You've taken at least three days\nlonger than I figured, getting here. Come on in,\" said Rakhal Sensar.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN\n\n\nHe hadn't changed much in six years. His face _was_ worse than mine; he\nhadn't had the plastic surgeons of Terran Intelligence doing their best\nfor him. His mouth, I thought fleetingly, must hurt like hell when he\ndrew it up into the kind of grin he was grinning now. His eyebrows,\nthick and fierce with gray in them, went up as he saw Miellyn; but he\nbacked away to let us enter, and shut the door behind us.\n\nThe room was bare and didn't look as if it had been lived in much. The\nfloor was stone, rough-laid, a single fur rug laid before a brazier. A\nlittle girl was sitting on the rug, drinking from a big double-handled\nmug, but she scrambled to her feet as we came in, and backed against the\nwall, looking at us with wide eyes.\n\nShe had pale-red hair like Juli's, cut straight in a fringe across her\nforehead, and she was dressed in a smock of dyed red fur that almost\nmatched her hair. A little smear of milk like a white moustache clung to\nher upper lip where she had forgotten to wipe her mouth. She was about\nfive years old, with deep-set dark eyes like Juli's, that watched me\ngravely without surprise or fear; she evidently knew who I was.\n\n\"Rindy,\" Rakhal said quietly, not taking his eyes from me. \"Go into the\nother room.\"\n\nRindy didn't move, still staring at me. Then she moved toward Miellyn,\nlooking up intently not at the woman, but at the pattern of embroideries\nacross her dress. It was very quiet, until Rakhal added, in a gentle and\ncuriously moderate voice, \"Do you still carry a skean, Race?\"\n\nI shook my head. \"There's an ancient proverb on Terra, about blood being\nthicker than water, Rakhal. That's Juli's daughter. I'm not going to\nkill her father right before her eyes.\" My rage spilled over then, and I\nbellowed, \"To hell with your damned Dry-town feuds and your filthy Toad\nGod and all the rest of it!\"\n\nRakhal said harshly, \"Rindy. I told you to get out.\"\n\n\"She needn't go.\" I took a step toward the little girl, a wary eye on\nRakhal. \"I don't know quite what you're up to, but it's nothing for a\nchild to be mixed up in. Do what you damn please. I can settle with you\nany time.\n\n\"The first thing is to get Rindy out of here. She belongs with Juli and,\ndamn it, that's where she's going.\" I held out my arms to the little\ngirl and said, \"It's over, Rindy, whatever he's done to you. Your mother\nsent me to find you. Don't you want to go to your mother?\"\n\nRakhal made a menacing gesture and warned, \"I wouldn't--\"\n\nMiellyn darted swiftly between us and caught up the child in her arms.\nRindy began to struggle noiselessly, kicking and whimpering, but Miellyn\ntook two quick steps, and flung an inner door open. Rakhal took a stride\ntoward her. She whirled on him, fighting to control the furious little\ngirl, and gasped, \"Settle it between you, without the baby watching!\"\n\nThrough the open door I briefly saw a bed, a child's small dresses\nhanging on a hook, before Miellyn kicked the door shut and I heard a\nlatch being fastened. Behind the closed door Rindy broke into angry\nscreams, but I put my back against the door.\n\n\"She's right. We'll settle it between the two of us. What have you done\nto that child?\"\n\n\"If you thought--\" Rakhal stopped himself in midsentence and stood\nwatching me without moving for a minute. Then he laughed.\n\n\"You're as stupid as ever, Race. Why, you fool, I knew Juli would run\nstraight to you, if she was scared enough. I knew it would bring you out\nof hiding. Why, you damned fool!\" He stood mocking me, but there was a\nstrained fury, almost a frenzy of contempt behind the laughter.\n\n\"You filthy coward, Race! Six years hiding in the Terran zone. Six\nyears, and I gave you six months! If you'd had the guts to walk out\nafter me, after I rigged that final deal to give you the chance, we\ncould have gone after the biggest thing on Wolf. And we could have\nbrought it off together, instead of spending years spying and dodging\nand hunting! And now, when I finally get you out of hiding, all you want\nto do is run back where you'll be safe! I thought you had more guts!\"\n\n\"Not for Evarin's dirty work!\"\n\nRakhal swore hideously. \"Evarin! Do you really believe--I might have\nknown he'd get to you too! That girl--and you've managed to wreck all I\ndid there, too!\" Suddenly, so swiftly my eyes could hardly follow, he\nwhipped out his skean and came at me. \"Get away from that door!\"\n\nI stood my ground. \"You'll have to kill me first. And I won't fight you,\nRakhal. We'll settle this, but we'll do it my way for once, like\nEarthmen.\"\n\n\"_Son of the Ape!_ Get your skean out, you stinking coward!\"\n\n\"I won't do it, Rakhal.\" I stood and defied him. I had outmaneuvered\nDry-towners in a _shegri_ bet. I knew Rakhal, and I knew he would not\nknife an unarmed man. \"We fought once with the _kifirgh_ and it didn't\nsettle anything. This time we'll do it my way. I threw my skean away\nbefore I came here. I won't fight.\"\n\nHe thrust at me. Even I could see that the blow was a feint, and I had a\nflashing, instantaneous memory of Dallisa's threat to drive the knife\nthrough my palms. But even while I commanded myself to stand steady,\nsheer reflex threw me forward, grabbing at his wrist and the knife.\n\nBetween my grappling hand he twisted and I felt the skean drive home,\nrip through my jacket with a tearing sound; felt the thin fine line of\ntouch, not pain yet, as it sliced flesh. Then pain burned through my\nribs and I felt hot blood, and I wanted to kill Rakhal, wanted to get my\nhands around his throat and kill him with them. And at the same time I\nwas raging because I didn't want to fight the crazy fool, I wasn't even\nmad at him.\n\nMiellyn flung the door open, shrieking, and suddenly the Toy, released,\nwas darting a small whirring droning horror, straight at Rakhal's eyes.\nI yelled. But there was no time even to warn him. I bent and butted him\nin the stomach. He grunted, doubled up in agony and fell out of the path\nof the diving Toy. It whirred in frustration, hovered.\n\nHe writhed in agony, drawing up his knees, clawing at his shirt, while I\nturned on Miellyn in immense fury--and stopped. Hers had been a move of\ndesperation, an instinctive act to restore the balance between a\nweaponless man and one who had a knife. Rakhal gasped, in a hoarse voice\nwith all the breath gone from it:\n\n\"Didn't want to use. Rather fight clean--\" Then he opened his closed\nfist and suddenly there were _two_ of the little whirring droning\nhorrors in the room and this one was diving at me, and as I threw myself\nheadlong to the floor the last puzzle-piece fell into place: Evarin had\nmade the same bargain with Rakhal as with me!\n\nI rolled over, dodging. Behind me in the room there was a child's shrill\nscream: \"Daddy! Daddy!\" And abruptly the birds collapsed in midair and\nwent limp. They fell to the floor like dropping stones and lay there\nquivering. Rindy dashed across the room, her small skirts flying, and\ngrabbed up one of the terrible vicious things in either hand.\n\n\"Rindy!\" I bellowed. \"No!\"\n\nShe stood shaking, tears pouring down her round cheeks, a Toy squeezed\ntight in either hand. Dark veins stood out almost black on her fair\ntemples. \"Break them, Daddy,\" she implored in a little thread of a\nvoice. \"Break them, _quick_. I can't hang on....\"\n\nRakhal staggered to his feet like a drunken man and snatched one of the\nToys, grinding it under his heel. He made a grab at the second, reeled\nand drew an anguished breath. He crumpled up, clutching at his belly\nwhere I'd butted him. The bird screamed like a living thing.\n\nBreaking my paralysis of horror I leaped up, ran across the room,\nheedless of the searing pain along my side. I snatched the bird from\nRindy and it screamed and shrilled and died as my foot crunched the tiny\nfeathers. I stamped the still-moving thing into an amorphous mess and\nkept on stamping and smashing until it was only a heap of powder.\n\nRakhal finally managed to haul himself upright again. His face was so\npale that the scars stood out like fresh burns.\n\n\"That was a foul blow, Race, but I--I know why you did it.\" He stopped\nand breathed for a minute. Then he muttered, \"You ... saved my life, you\nknow. Did you know you were doing it, when you did it?\"\n\nStill breathing hard, I nodded. Done knowingly, it meant an end of\nblood-feud. However we had wronged each other, whatever the pledges. I\nspoke the words that confirmed it and ended it, finally and forever:\n\n\"There is a life between us. Let it stand for a death.\"\n\nMiellyn was standing in the doorway, her hands pressed to her mouth, her\neyes wide. She said shakily, \"You're walking around with a knife in your\nribs, you fool!\"\n\nRakhal whirled and with a quick jerk he pulled the skean loose. It had\nsimply been caught in my shirtcloak, in a fold of the rough cloth. He\npulled it away, glanced at the red tip, then relaxed. \"Not more than an\ninch deep,\" he said. Then, angrily, defending himself: \"You did it\nyourself, you ape. I was trying to get rid of the knife when you jumped\nme.\"\n\nBut I knew that and he knew I knew it. He turned and scooped up Rindy,\nwho was sobbing noisily. She dug her head into his shoulder and I made\nout her strangled words. \"The other Toys hurt you when I was mad at\nyou....\" she sobbed, rubbing her fists against smeared cheeks. \"I--I\nwasn't that mad at you. I wasn't that mad at anybody, not even ... him.\"\n\nRakhal pressed his hand against his daughter's fleecy hair and said,\nlooking at me over her head, \"The Toys activate a child's subconscious\nresentments against his parents--I found out that much. That also means\na child can control them for a few seconds. No adult can.\" A stranger\nwould have seen no change in his expression, but I knew him, and saw.\n\n\"Juli said you threatened Rindy.\"\n\nHe chuckled and set the child on her feet. \"What else could I say that\nwould have scared Juli enough to send her running to you? Juli's proud,\nalmost as proud as you are, you stiff-necked Son of the Ape.\" The insult\ndid not sting me now.\n\n\"Come on, sit down and let's decide what to do, now we've finished up\nthe old business.\" He looked remotely at Miellyn and said, \"You must be\nDallisa's sister? I don't suppose your talents include knowing how to\nmake coffee?\"\n\nThey didn't, but with Rindy's help Miellyn managed, and while they were\nout of the room Rakhal explained briefly. \"Rindy has rudimentary ESP.\nI've never had it myself, but I could teach her something--not\nmuch--about how to use it. I've been on Evarin's track ever since that\nbusiness of The Lisse.\n\n\"I'd have got it sooner, if you were still working with me, but I\ncouldn't do anything as a Terran agent, and I had to be kicked out so\nthoroughly that the others wouldn't be afraid I was still working\nsecretly for Terra. For a long time I was just chasing rumors, but when\nRindy got big enough to look in the crystals of Nebran, I started making\nsome progress.\n\n\"I was afraid to tell Juli; her best safety was the fact that she didn't\nknow anything. She's always been a stranger in the Dry-towns.\" He\npaused, then said with honest self-evaluation, \"Since I left the Secret\nService I've been a stranger there myself.\"\n\nI asked, \"What about Dallisa?\"\n\n\"Twins have some ESP to each other. I knew Miellyn had gone to the\nToymaker. I tried to get Dallisa to find out where Miellyn had gone,\nlearn more about it. Dallisa wouldn't risk it, but Kyral saw me with\nDallisa and thought it was Miellyn. That put him on my tail, too, and I\nhad to leave Shainsa. I was afraid of Kyral,\" he added soberly. \"Afraid\nof what he'd do. I couldn't do anything without Rindy and I knew if I\ntold Juli what I was doing, she'd take Rindy away into the Terran Zone,\nand I'd be as good as dead.\"\n\nAs he talked, I began to realize how vast a web Evarin and the\nunderground organization of Nebran had spread for us. \"Evarin was here\ntoday. What for?\"\n\nRakhal laughed mirthlessly. \"He's been trying to get us to kill each\nother off. That would get rid of us both. He wants to turn over Wolf to\nthe nonhumans entirely, I think he's sincere enough, but\"--he spread his\nhands helplessly--\"I can't sit by and see it.\"\n\nI asked point-blank, \"Are you working for Terra? Or for the Dry-towns?\nOr any of the anti-Terran movements?\"\n\n\"I'm working for _me_\", he said with a shrug. \"I don't think much of the\nTerran Empire, but one planet can't fight a galaxy. Race, I want just\none thing. I want the Dry-towns and the rest of Wolf, to have a voice in\ntheir own government. Any planet which makes a substantial contribution\nto galactic science, by the laws of the Terran Empire, is automatically\ngiven the status of an independent commonwealth.\n\n\"If a man from the Dry-towns discovers something like a matter\ntransmitter, Wolf gets dominion status. But Evarin and his gang want to\nkeep it secret, keep it away from Terra, keep it locked up in places\nlike Canarsa! Somebody has to get it away from them. And if I do it, I\nget a nice fat bonus, and an official position.\"\n\nI believed that, where I would have suspected too much protestation of\naltruism. Rakhal tossed it aside.\n\n\"You've got Miellyn to take you through the transmitters. Go back to the\nMastershrine, and tell Evarin that Race Cargill is dead. In the Trade\nCity they think I'm Cargill, and I can get in and out as I choose--sorry\nif it caused you trouble, but it was the safest thing I could think\nof--and I'll 'vise Magnusson and have him send soldiers to guard the\nstreet-shrines. Evarin might try to escape through one of them.\"\n\nI shook my head. \"Terra hasn't enough men on all Wolf to cover the\nstreet-shrines in Charin alone. And I can't go back with Miellyn.\" I\nexplained. Rakhal pursed his lips and whistled when I described the\nfight in the transmitter.\n\n\"You have all the luck, Cargill! I've never been near enough even to be\nsure how they work--and I'll bet you didn't begin to understand! We'll\nhave to do it the hard way, then. It won't be the first time we've\nbulled our way through a tight place! We'll face Evarin in his own\nhideout! If Rindy's with us, we needn't worry.\"\n\nI was willing to let him assume command, but I protested, \"You'd take a\nchild into that--that--\"\n\n\"What else can we do? Rindy can control the Toys, and neither you nor I\ncan do that, if Evarin should decide to throw his whole arsenal at us.\"\nHe called Rindy and spoke softly to her. She looked from her father to\nme, and back again to her father, then smiled and stretched out her hand\nto me.\n\nBefore we ventured into the street, Rakhal scowled at the sprawled\nembroideries of Miellyn's robe. He said, \"In those things you show up\nlike a snowfall in Shainsa. If you go out in them, you could be mobbed.\nHadn't you better get rid of them now?\"\n\n\"I can't,\" she protested. \"They're the keys to the transmitter!\"\n\nRakhal looked at the conventionalized idols with curiosity, but said\nonly, \"Cover them up in the street, then. Rindy, find her something to\nput over her dress.\"\n\nWhen we reached the street-shrine, Miellyn admonished: \"Stand close\ntogether on the stones. I'm not sure we can all make the jump at once,\nbut we'll have to try.\"\n\nRakhal picked up Rindy and hoisted her to his shoulder. Miellyn dropped\nthe cloak she had draped over the pattern of the Nebran embroideries,\nand we crowded close together. The street swayed and vanished and I felt\nthe now-familiar dip and swirl of blackness before the world\nstraightened out again. Rindy was whimpering, dabbing smeary fists at\nher face. \"Daddy, my nose is bleeding....\"\n\nMiellyn hastily bent and wiped the blood from the snubby nose. Rakhal\ngestured impatiently.\n\n\"The workroom. Wreck everything you see. Rindy, if anything starts to\ncome at us, you stop it. Stop it quick. And\"--he bent and took the\nlittle face between his hands--\"_chiya_, remember they're not toys, no\nmatter how pretty they are.\"\n\nHer grave gray eyes blinked, and she nodded.\n\nRakhal flung open the door of the elves' workshop with a shout. The\nringing of the anvils shattered into a thousand dissonances as I kicked\nover a workbench and half-finished Toys crashed in confusion to the\nfloor.\n\nThe dwarfs scattered like rabbits before our assault of destruction. I\nsmashed tools, filigree, jewels, stamping everything with my heavy\nboots. I shattered glass, caught up a hammer and smashed crystals. There\nwas a wild exhilaration to it.\n\nA tiny doll, proportioned like a woman, dashed toward me, shrilling in a\nsupersonic shriek. I put my foot on her and ground the life out of her,\nand she screamed like a living woman as she came apart. Her blue eyes\nrolled from her head and lay on the floor watching me. I crushed the\nblue jewels under my heel.\n\nRakhal swung a tiny hound by the tail. Its head shattered into debris of\nalmost-invisible gears and wheels. I caught up a chair and wrecked a\nglass cabinet of parts with it, swinging furiously. A berserk madness of\nsmashing and breaking had laid hold on me.\n\nI was drunk with crushing and shattering and ruining, when I heard\nMiellyn scream a warning and turned to see Evarin standing in the\ndoorway. His green cat-eyes blazed with rage. Then he raised both hands\nin a sudden, sardonic gesture, and with a loping, inhuman glide, raced\nfor the transmitter.\n\n\"Rindy,\" Rakhal panted, \"can you block the transmitter?\"\n\nInstead Rindy shrieked. \"We've got to get out! The roof is falling down!\nThe house is going to fall down on us! The roof, look at the roof!\"\n\nI looked up, transfixed by horror. I saw a wide rift open, saw the\nskylight shatter and break, and daylight pouring through the cracking\nwalls, Rakhal snatched Rindy up, protecting her from the falling debris\nwith his head and shoulders. I grabbed Miellyn round the waist and we\nran for the rift in the buckling wall.\n\nWe shoved through just before the roof caved in and the walls collapsed,\nand we found ourselves standing on a bare grassy hillside, looking down\nin shock and horror as below us, section after section of what had been\napparently bare hill and rock caved in and collapsed into dusty rubble.\n\nMiellyn screamed hoarsely. \"Run. Run, hurry!\"\n\nI didn't understand, but I ran. I ran, my sides aching, blood streaming\nfrom the forgotten flesh-wound in my side. Miellyn raced beside me and\nRakhal stumbled along, carrying Rindy.\n\nThen the shock of a great explosion rocked the ground, hurling me down\nfull length, Miellyn falling on top of me. Rakhal went down on his\nknees. Rindy was crying loudly. When I could see straight again, I\nlooked down at the hillside.\n\nThere was nothing left of Evarin's hideaway or the Mastershrine of\nNebran except a great, gaping hole, still oozing smoke and thick black\ndust. Miellyn said aloud, dazed, \"So _that's_ what he was going to do!\"\n\nIt fitted the peculiar nonhuman logic of the Toymaker. He'd covered the\ntraces.\n\n\"Destroyed!\" Rakhal raged. \"All destroyed! The workrooms, the science of\nthe Toys, the matter transmitter--the minute we find it, it's\ndestroyed!\" He beat his fists furiously. \"Our one chance to learn--\"\n\n\"We were lucky to get out alive,\" said Miellyn quietly. \"Where on the\nplanet are we, I wonder?\"\n\nI looked down the hillside, and stared in amazement. Spread out on the\nhillside below us lay the Kharsa, topped by the white skyscraper of the\nHQ.\n\n\"I'll be damned,\" I said, \"right here. We're home. Rakhal, you can go\ndown and make your peace with the Terrans, and Juli. And you, Miellyn--\"\nBefore the others, I could not say what I was thinking, but I put my\nhand on her shoulder and kept it there. She smiled, shakily, with a hint\nof her old mischief. \"I can't go into the Terran Zone looking like this,\ncan I? Give me that comb again. Rakhal, give me your shirtcloak, my\nrobes are torn.\"\n\n\"You vain, stupid female, worrying about a thing like that at a time\nlike this!\" Rakhal's look was like murder. I put my comb in her hand,\nthen suddenly saw something in the symbols across her breasts. Before\nthis I had seen only the conventionalized and intricate glyph of the\nToad God. But now--\n\nI reached out and ripped the cloth away.\n\n\"Cargill!\" she protested angrily, crimsoning, covering her bare breasts\nwith both hands. \"Is this the place? And before a child, too!\"\n\nI hardly heard. \"Look!\" I exclaimed. \"Rakhal, look at the symbols\nembroidered into the glyph of the God! You can read the old nonhuman\nglyphs. You did it in the city of The Lisse. Miellyn said they were the\nkey to the transmitters! I'll bet the formula is written out there for\nanyone to read!\n\n\"Anyone, that is, who _can_ read it! I can't, but I'll bet the formula\nequations for the transmitters are carved on every Toad God glyph on\nWolf. Rakhal, it makes sense. There are two ways of hiding something.\nEither keep it locked away, or hide it right out in plain sight. Whoever\nbothers even to _look_ at a conventionalized Toad God? There are so many\n_billions_ of them....\"\n\nHe bent his head over the embroideries, and when he looked up his face\nwas flushed. \"I believe--by the chains of Sharra, I believe you have it,\nRace! It may take years to work out the glyphs, but I'll do it, or die\ntrying!\" His scarred and hideous face looked almost handsome in\nexultation, and I grinned at him.\n\n\"If Juli leaves enough of you, once she finds out how you maneuvered\nher. Look, Rindy's fallen asleep on the grass there. Poor kid, we'd\nbetter get her down to her mother.\"\n\n\"Right.\" Rakhal thrust the precious embroidery into his shirtcloak, then\ncradled his sleeping daughter in his arms. I watched him with a curious\nemotion I could not identify. It seemed to pinpoint some great change,\neither in Rakhal or myself. It's not difficult to visualize one's sister\nwith children, but there was something, some strange incongruity in the\nsight of Rakhal carrying the little girl, carefully tucking her up in a\nfold of his cloak to keep the sharp breeze off her face.\n\nMiellyn was limping in her thin sandals, and she shivered. I asked,\n\"Cold?\"\n\n\"No, but--I don't believe Evarin is dead, I'm afraid he got away.\"\n\nFor a minute the thought dimmed the luster of the morning. Then I\nshrugged. \"He's probably buried in that big hole up there.\" But I knew I\nwould never be sure.\n\nWe walked abreast, my arm around the weary, stumbling woman, and Rakhal\nsaid softly at last, \"Like old times.\"\n\nIt wasn't old times, I knew. He would know it too, once his exultation\nsobered. I had outgrown my love for intrigue, and I had the feeling this\nwas Rakhal's last adventure. It was going to take him, as he said, years\nto work out the equations for the transmitter. And I had a feeling my\nown solid, ordinary desk was going to look good to me in the morning.\n\nBut I knew now that I'd never run away from Wolf again. It was my own\nbeloved sun that was rising. My sister was waiting for me down below,\nand I was bringing back her child. My best friend was walking at my\nside. What more could a man want?\n\nIf the memory of dark, poison-berry eyes was to haunt me in nightmares,\nthey did not come into the waking world. I looked at Miellyn, took her\nslender unmanacled hand in mine, and smiled as we walked through the\ngates of the city. Now, after all my years on Wolf, I understood the\ndesire to keep their women under lock and key that was its ancient\ncustom. I vowed to myself as we went that I should waste no time finding\na fetter shop and having forged therein the perfect steel chains that\nshould bind my love's wrists to my key forever.\n\n\n\n\nACE SCIENCE FICTION DOUBLES\n\nTwo books back-to-back\n\n00990 =Against Arcturus= Putney\n=Time Thieves= Koontz 95c\n\n13805 =Dark Planet= Rackham\n=Herod Men= Kamin 75c\n\n15890 =Door Through Space= Bradley\n=Rendezvous on a Lost World= Chandler 95c\n\n16640 =Dragon Master=\n=Five Gold Bands= Vance 95c\n\n27415 =Gather in the Hall of Planets= O'Donnell\n=In the Pocket and Other SF Stories= O'Donnell 75c\n\n33710 =Highwood= Barrett\n=Annihilation Factor= Bayley 95c\n\n66525 =Pirates of Zan= Leinster\n=Mutant Weapon= Leinster 95c\n\n68310 =Project Jove= Glasby\n=Hunters of Jundagai= Bulmer 75c\n\n75781 =Secret of Sinharat=\n=People of the Talisman= Brackett 95c\n\n77525 =Son of the Tree=\n=House of Iszm= Vance 95c\n\n77785 =Space Willies=\n=Six Worlds Yonder= Russell 75c\n\n79975 =Technos=\n=A Scatter of Stardust= Tubb 95c\n\n_Available wherever paperbacks are sold or use this coupon_.\n\n\n=ace books=, (Dept.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n*** END: FULL LICENSE ***\n"}
