Finding\n             one worth living for is the genuine problem!\n\n\nIn the region of the Coal Sack Nebula, on the dead fourth planet of\na star called Tyban, Captain Steffens of the Mapping Command stood\ncounting buildings. Eleven. No, twelve. He wondered if there was any\nsignificance in the number. He had no idea.\n\n\"What do you make of it?\" he asked.\n\nLieutenant Ball, the executive officer of the ship, almost tried to\nscratch his head before he remembered that he was wearing a spacesuit.\n\n\"Looks like a temporary camp,\" Ball said. \"Very few buildings, and all\nbuilt out of native materials, the only stuff available. Castaways,\nmaybe?\"\n\nSteffens was silent as he walked up onto the rise. The flat weathered\nstone jutted out of the sand before him.\n\n\"No inscriptions,\" he pointed out.\n\n\"They would have been worn away. See the wind grooves? Anyway, there's\nnot another building on the whole damn planet. You wouldn't call it\nmuch of a civilization.\"\n\n\"You don't think these are native?\"\n\nBall said he didn't. Steffens nodded.\n\nStanding there and gazing at the stone, Steffens felt the awe of great\nage. He had a hunch, deep and intuitive, that this was old--_too_ old.\nHe reached out a gloved hand, ran it gently over the smooth stone\nridges of the wall. Although the atmosphere was very thin, he noticed\nthat the buildings had no airlocks.\n\nBall's voice sounded in his helmet: \"Want to set up shop, Skipper?\"\n\nSteffens paused. \"All right, if you think it will do any good.\"\n\n\"You never can tell. Excavation probably won't be much use. These\nthings are on a raised rock foundation, swept clean by the wind. And\nyou can see that the rock itself is native--\" he indicated the ledge\nbeneath their feet--\"and was cut out a long while back.\"\n\n\"How long?\"\n\nBall toed the sand uncomfortably. \"I wouldn't like to say off-hand.\"\n\n\"Make a rough estimate.\"\n\nBall looked at the captain, knowing what was in his mind. He smiled\nwryly and said: \"Five thousand years? Ten thousand? I don't know.\"\n\nSteffens whistled.\n\nBall pointed again at the wall. \"Look at the striations. You can tell\nfrom that alone. It would take even a brisk Earth wind _at least_\nseveral thousand years to cut that deep, and the wind here has only a\nfraction of that force.\"\n\nThe two men stood for a long moment in silence. Man had been in\ninterstellar space for three hundred years and this was the first\nuncovered evidence of an advanced, space-crossing, alien race. It was\nan historic moment, but neither of them was thinking about history.\n\nMan had been in space for only three hundred years. Whatever had built\nthese had been in space for thousands of years.\n\nWhich ought to give _them_, thought Steffens uncomfortably, one hell of\na good head-start.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhile the excav crew worked steadily, turning up nothing, Steffens\nremained alone among the buildings. Ball came out to him, looked dryly\nat the walls.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"whoever they were, we haven't heard from them since.\"\n\n\"No? How can you be sure?\" Steffens grunted. \"A space-borne race was\nroaming this part of the Galaxy while men were still pitching spears\nat each other, _that_ long ago. And this planet is only a parsec from\nVarius II, a civilization as old as Earth's. Did whoever built these\nget to Varius? Or did they get to Earth? How can you know?\"\n\nHe kicked at the sand distractedly. \"And most important, where are they\nnow? A race with several thousand years....\"\n\n\"Fifteen thousand,\" Ball said. When Steffens looked up, he added:\n\"That's what the geology boys say. Fifteen thousand, at the least.\"\n\nSteffens turned to stare unhappily at the buildings. When he realized\nnow how really old they were, a sudden thought struck him.\n\n\"But why buildings? Why did they have to build in stone, to last?\nThere's something wrong with that. They shouldn't have had a need\nto build, unless they were castaways. And castaways would have left\n_something_ behind. The only reason they would need a camp would be--\"\n\n\"If the ship left and some of them stayed.\"\n\nSteffens nodded. \"But then the ship must have come back. Where did it\ngo?\" He ceased kicking at the sand and looked up into the blue-black\nmidday sky. \"We'll never know.\"\n\n\"How about the other planets?\" Ball asked.\n\n\"The report was negative. Inner too hot, outer too heavy and cold. The\nthird planet is the only one with a decent temperature range, but _it_\nhas a CO_{2} atmosphere.\"\n\n\"How about moons?\"\n\nSteffens shrugged. \"We could try them and find out.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe third planet was a blank, gleaming ball until they were in close,\nand then the blankness resolved into folds and piling clouds and dimly,\nin places, the surface showed through. The ship went down through the\nclouds, falling the last few miles on her brakers. They came into the\nmisty gas below, leveled off and moved along the edge of the twilight\nzone.\n\nThe moons of this solar system had yielded nothing. The third planet, a\nhot, heavy world which had no free oxygen and from which the monitors\nhad detected nothing, was all that was left. Steffens expected nothing,\nbut he had to try.\n\nAt a height of several miles, the ship moved up the zone, scanning,\nmoving in the familiar slow spiral of the Mapping Command. Faint dark\noutlines of bare rocks and hills moved by below.\n\nSteffens turned the screen to full magnification and watched silently.\n\nAfter a while he saw a city.\n\nThe main screen being on, the whole crew saw it. Someone shouted and\nthey stopped to stare, and Steffens was about to call for altitude when\nhe saw that the city was dead.\n\nHe looked down on splintered walls that were like cloudy glass pieces\nrising above a plain, rising in a shattered circle. Near the center\nof the city, there was a huge, charred hole at least three miles in\ndiameter and very deep. In all the piled rubble, nothing moved.\n\nSteffens went down low to make sure, then brought the ship around and\nheaded out across the main continent into the bright area of the sun.\nThe rocks rolled by below, there was no vegetation at all, and then\nthere were more cities--all with the black depression, the circular\nstamp that blotted away and fused the buildings into nothing.\n\nNo one on the ship had anything to say. None had ever seen a war, for\nthere had not been war on Earth or near it for more than three hundred\nyears.\n\nThe ship circled around to the dark side of the planet. When they were\ndown below a mile, the radiation counters began to react. It became\napparent, from the dials, that there could be nothing alive.\n\nAfter a while Ball said: \"Well, which do you figure? Did our friends\nfrom the fourth planet do this, or were they the same people as these?\"\n\nSteffens did not take his eyes from the screen. They were coming around\nto the daylight side.\n\n\"We'll go down and look for the answer,\" he said. \"Break out the\nradiation suits.\"\n\nHe paused, thinking. If the ones on the fourth planet were alien to\nthis world, they were from outer space, could not have come from one\nof the other planets here. They had starships and were warlike. Then,\nthousands of years ago. He began to realize how important it really was\nthat Ball's question be answered.\n\nWhen the ship had gone very low, looking for a landing site, Steffens\nwas still by the screen. It was Steffens, then, who saw the thing move.\n\nDown far below, it had been a still black shadow, and then it moved.\nSteffens froze. And he knew, even at that distance, that it was a robot.\n\nTiny and black, a mass of hanging arms and legs, the thing went gliding\ndown the slope of a hill. Steffens saw it clearly for a full second,\nsaw the dull ball of its head tilt upward as the ship came over, and\nthen the hill was past.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nQuickly Steffens called for height. The ship bucked beneath him and\nblasted straight up; some of the crew went crashing to the deck.\nSteffens remained by the screen, increasing the magnification as the\nship drew away. And he saw another, then two, then a black gliding\ngroup, all matched with bunches of hanging arms.\n\nNothing alive but robots, he thought, _robots_. He adjusted to full\nclose up as quickly as he could and the picture focused on the screen.\nBehind him he heard a crewman grunt in amazement.\n\nA band of clear, plasticlike stuff ran round the head--it would be the\neye, a band of eye that saw all ways. On the top of the head was a\nsingle round spot of the plastic, and the rest was black metal, joined,\nhe realized, with fantastic perfection. The angle of sight was now\nalmost perpendicular. He could see very little of the branching arms of\nthe trunk, but what had been on the screen was enough. They were the\nmost perfect robots he had ever seen.\n\nThe ship leveled off. Steffens had no idea what to do; the sudden sight\nof the moving things had unnerved him. He had already sounded the\nalert, flicked out the defense screens. Now he had nothing to do. He\ntried to concentrate on what the League Law would have him do.\n\nThe Law was no help. Contact with planet-bound races was forbidden\nunder any circumstances. But could a bunch of robots be called a race?\nThe Law said nothing about robots because Earthmen had none. The\nbuilding of imaginative robots was expressly forbidden. But at any\nrate, Steffens thought, he had made contact already.\n\nWhile Steffens stood by the screen, completely bewildered for the first\ntime in his space career, Lieutenant Ball came up, hobbling slightly.\nFrom the bright new bruise on his cheek, Steffens guessed that the\nsudden climb had caught him unaware. The exec was pale with surprise.\n\n\"What were they?\" he said blankly. \"Lord, they looked like robots!\"\n\n\"They were.\"\n\nBall stared confoundedly at the screen. The things were now a confusion\nof dots in the mist.\n\n\"Almost humanoid,\" Steffens said, \"but not quite.\"\n\nBall was slowly absorbing the situation. He turned to gaze inquiringly\nat Steffens.\n\n\"Well, what do we do now?\"\n\nSteffens shrugged. \"They saw us. We could leave now and let them quite\npossibly make a ... a legend out of our visit, or we could go down and\nsee if they tie in with the buildings on Tyban IV.\"\n\n\"_Can_ we go down?\"\n\n\"Legally? I don't know. If they are robots, yes, since robots cannot\nconstitute a race. But there's another possibility.\" He tapped his\nfingers on the screen confusedly. \"They don't have to be robots at all.\nThey could be the natives.\"\n\nBall gulped. \"I don't follow you.\"\n\n\"They could be the original inhabitants of this planet--the brains of\nthem, at least, protected in radiation-proof metal. Anyway,\" he added,\n\"they're the most perfect mechanicals I've ever seen.\"\n\nBall shook his head, sat down abruptly. Steffens turned from the\nscreen, strode nervously across the Main Deck, thinking.\n\nThe Mapping Command, they called it. Theoretically, all he was supposed\nto do was make a closeup examination of unexplored systems, checking\nfor the presence of life-forms as well as for the possibilities of\nhuman colonization. Make a check and nothing else. But he knew very\nclearly that if he returned to Sirius base without investigating this\nrobot situation, he could very well be court-martialed one way or the\nother, either for breaking the Law of Contact or for dereliction of\nduty.\n\nAnd there was also the possibility, which abruptly occurred to him,\nthat the robots might well be prepared to blow his ship to hell and\ngone.\n\nHe stopped in the center of the deck. A whole new line of thought\nopened up. If the robots were armed and ready ... could this be an\noutpost?\n\n_An outpost!_\n\nHe turned and raced for the bridge. If he went in and landed and was\nlost, then the League might never know in time. If he went in and\nstirred up trouble....\n\nThe thought in his mind was scattered suddenly, like a mist blown away.\nA voice was speaking in his mind, a deep calm voice that seemed to say:\n\n\"_Greetings. Do not be alarmed. We do not wish you to be alarmed. Our\ndesire is only to serve...._\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Greetings, it said! Greetings!\" Ball was mumbling incredulously\nthrough shocked lips.\n\nEveryone on the ship had heard the voice. When it spoke again, Steffens\nwas not sure whether it was just one voice or many voices.\n\n\"We await your coming,\" it said gravely, and repeated: \"Our desire is\nonly to serve.\"\n\nAnd then the robots sent a _picture_.\n\nAs perfect and as clear as a tridim movie, a rectangular plate took\nshape in Steffens' mind. On the face of the plate, standing alone\nagainst a background of red-brown, bare rocks, was one of the robots.\nWith slow, perfect movement, the robot carefully lifted one of the\nhanging arms of its side, of its _right_ side, and extended it toward\nSteffens, a graciously offered hand.\n\nSteffens felt a peculiar, compelling urge to take the hand, realized\nright away that the urge to take the hand was not entirely his. The\nrobot mind had helped.\n\nWhen the picture vanished, he knew that the others had seen it. He\nwaited for a while; there was no further contact, but the feeling of\nthe robot's urging was still strong within him. He had an idea that, if\nthey wanted to, the robots could control his mind. So when nothing more\nhappened, he began to lose his fear.\n\nWhile the crew watched in fascination, Steffens tried to talk back.\nHe concentrated hard on what he was saying, said it aloud for good\nmeasure, then held his own hand extended in the robot manner of shaking\nhands.\n\n\"Greetings,\" he said, because it was what _they_ had said, and\nexplained: \"We have come from the stars.\"\n\nIt was overly dramatic, but so was the whole situation. He wondered\nbaffledly if he should have let the Alien Contact crew handle it. Order\nsomeone to stand there, feeling like a fool, and _think_ a message?\n\nNo, it was his responsibility; he had to go on:\n\n\"We request--we respectfully request permission to land upon your\nplanet.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSteffens had not realized that there were so many.\n\nThey had been gathering since his ship was first seen, and now there\nwere hundreds of them clustered upon the hill. Others were arriving\neven as the skiff landed; they glided in over the rocky hills with\nfantastic ease and power, so that Steffens felt a momentary anxiety.\nMost of the robots were standing with the silent immobility of metal.\nOthers threaded their way to the fore and came near the skiff, but none\ntouched it, and a circle was cleared for Steffens when he came out.\n\nOne of the near robots came forward alone, moving, as Steffens now\nsaw, on a number of short, incredibly strong and agile legs. The black\nthing paused before him, extended a hand as it had done in the picture.\nSteffens took it, he hoped, warmly; felt the power of the metal through\nthe glove of his suit.\n\n\"Welcome,\" the robot said, speaking again to his mind, and now\nSteffens detected a peculiar alteration in the robot's tone. It was\nless friendly now, less--Steffens could not understand--somehow less\n_interested_, as if the robot had been--expecting someone else.\n\n\"Thank you,\" Steffens said. \"We are deeply grateful for your permission\nto land.\"\n\n\"Our desire,\" the robot repeated mechanically, \"is only to serve.\"\n\nSuddenly, Steffens began to feel alone, surrounded by machines. He\ntried to push the thought out of his mind, because he knew that they\n_should_ seem inhuman. But....\n\n\"Will the others come down?\" asked the robot, still mechanically.\n\nSteffens felt his embarrassment. The ship lay high in the mist above,\njets throbbing gently.\n\n\"They must remain with the ship,\" Steffens said aloud, trusting to the\nrobot's formality not to ask him why. Although, if they could read his\nmind, there was no need to ask.\n\nFor a long while, neither spoke, long enough for Steffens to grow tense\nand uncomfortable. He could not think of a thing to say, the robot was\nobviously waiting, and so, in desperation, he signaled the Aliencon men\nto come on out of the skiff.\n\nThey came, wonderingly, and the ring of robots widened. Steffens heard\nthe one robot speak again. The voice was now much more friendly.\n\n\"We hope you will forgive us for intruding upon your thought. It is\nour--custom--not to communicate unless we are called upon. But when we\nobserved that you were in ignorance of our real--nature--and were about\nto leave our planet, we decided to put aside our custom, so that you\nmight base your decision upon sufficient data.\"\n\nSteffens replied haltingly that he appreciated their action.\n\n\"We perceive,\" the robot went on, \"that you are unaware of our complete\naccess to your mind, and would perhaps be--dismayed--to learn that\nwe have been gathering information from you. We must--apologize.\nOur only purpose was so that we could communicate with you. Only\nthat information was taken which is necessary for communication\nand--understanding. We will enter your minds henceforth only at your\nrequest.\"\n\nSteffens did not react to the news that his mind was being probed\nas violently as he might have. Nevertheless it was a shock, and he\nretreated into observant silence as the Aliencon men went to work.\n\nThe robot which seemed to have been doing the speaking was in no way\ndifferent from any of the others in the group. Since each of the robots\nwas immediately aware of all that was being said or thought, Steffens\nguessed that they had sent one forward just for appearance's sake,\nbecause they perceived that the Earthmen would feel more at home. The\npicture of the extended hand, the characteristic handshake of Earthmen,\nhad probably been borrowed, too, for the same purpose of making him and\nthe others feel at ease. The one jarring note was the robot's momentary\nlapse, those unexplainable few seconds when the things had seemed\nalmost disappointed. Steffens gave up wondering about that and began to\nexamine the first robot in detail.\n\nIt was not very tall, being at least a foot shorter than the Earthmen.\nThe most peculiar thing about it, except for the circling eye-band of\nthe head, was a mass of symbols which were apparently engraved upon the\nmetal chest. Symbols in row upon row--numbers, perhaps--were upon the\nchest, and repeated again below the level of the arms, and continued\nin orderly rows across the front of the robot, all the way down to the\nbase of the trunk. If they were numbers, Steffens thought, then it was\na remarkably complicated system. But he noticed the same pattern on\nthe nearer robots, all apparently identical. He was forced to conclude\nthat the symbols were merely decoration and let it go tentatively at\nthat, although the answer seemed illogical.\n\nIt wasn't until he was on his way home that Steffens remembered the\nsymbols again. And only then did he realized what they were.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter a while, convinced that there was no danger, Steffens had the\nship brought down. When the crew came out of the airlock, they were met\nby the robots, and each man found himself with a robot at his side,\nhumbly requesting to be of service. There were literally thousands of\nthe robots now, come from all over the barren horizon. The mass of them\nstood apart, immobile on a plain near the ship, glinting in the sun\nlike a vast, metallic field of black wheat.\n\nThe robots had obviously been built to serve. Steffens began to _feel_\ntheir pleasure, to sense it in spite of the blank, expressionless\nfaces. They were almost like children in their eagerness, yet they were\nstill reserved. Whoever had built them, Steffens thought in wonder, had\nbuilt them well.\n\nBall came to join Steffens, staring at the robots through the clear\nplastic of his helmet with baffledly widened eyes. A robot moved out\nfrom the mass in the field, allied itself to him. The first to speak\nhad remained with Steffens.\n\nRealizing that the robot could hear every word he was saying, Ball\nwas for a while apprehensive. But the sheer unreality of standing and\ntalking with a multi-limbed, intelligent hunk of dead metal upon the\nbare rock of a dead, ancient world, the unreality of it slowly died.\nIt was impossible not to like the things. There was something in their\nvery lines which was pleasant and relaxing.\n\nTheir builders, Steffens thought, had probably thought of that, too.\n\n\"There's no harm in them,\" said Ball at last, openly, not minding if\nthe robots heard. \"They seem actually glad we're here. My God, whoever\nheard of a robot being glad?\"\n\nSteffens, embarrassed, spoke quickly to the nearest mechanical: \"I hope\nyou will forgive us our curiosity, but--yours is a remarkable race. We\nhave never before made contact with a race like yours.\" It was said\nhaltingly, but it was the best he could do.\n\nThe robot made a singularly human nodding motion of its head.\n\n\"I perceive that the nature of our construction is unfamiliar to you.\nYour question is whether or not we are entirely 'mechanical.' I am\nnot exactly certain as to what the word 'mechanical' is intended to\nconvey--I would have to examine your thought more fully--but I believe\nthat there is fundamental similarity between our structures.\"\n\nThe robot paused. Steffens had a distinct impression that it was\ndisconcerted.\n\n\"I must tell you,\" the thing went on, \"that we ourselves are--curious.\"\nIt stopped suddenly, struggling with a word it could not comprehend.\nSteffens waited, listening with absolute interest. It said at length:\n\n\"We know of only two types of living structure. Ours, which is largely\nmetallic, and that of the _Makers_, which would appear to be somewhat\nmore like yours. I am not a--doctor--and therefore cannot acquaint you\nwith the specific details of the Makers' composition, but if you are\ninterested I will have a doctor brought forward. It will be glad to be\nof assistance.\"\n\nIt was Steffens' turn to struggle, and the robot waited patiently while\nBall and the second robot looked on in silence. The Makers, obviously,\nwere whoever or whatever had built the robots, and the \"doctors,\"\nSteffens decided, were probably just that--doctor-robots, designed\nspecifically to care for the apparently flesh-bodies of the Makers.\n\nThe efficiency of the things continued to amaze him, but the question\nhe had been waiting to ask came out now with a rush:\n\n\"Can you tell us where the Makers are?\"\n\nBoth robots stood motionless. It occurred to Steffens that he couldn't\nreally be sure which was speaking. The voice that came to him spoke\nwith difficulty.\n\n\"The Makers--are not here.\"\n\nSteffens stared in puzzlement. The robot detected his confusion and\nwent on:\n\n\"The Makers have gone away. They have been gone for a very long time.\"\n\nCould that be _pain_ in its voice, Steffens wondered, and then the\nspectre of the ruined cities rose harsh in his mind.\n\nWar. The Makers had all been killed in that war. And these had not been\nkilled.\n\nHe tried to grasp it, but he couldn't. There were robots here in the\nmidst of a radiation so lethal that _nothing_, _nothing_ could live;\nrobots on a dead planet, living in an atmosphere of carbon dioxide.\n\nThe carbon dioxide brought him up sharp.\n\nIf there had been life here once, there would have been plant life as\nwell, and therefore oxygen. If the war had been so long ago that the\nfree oxygen had since gone out of the atmosphere--good God, how old\nwere the robots? Steffens looked at Ball, then at the silent robots,\nthen out across the field to where the rest of them stood. The black\nwheat. Steffens felt a deep chill.\n\nWere they immortal?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Would you like to see a doctor?\"\n\nSteffens jumped at the familiar words, then realized to what the robot\nwas referring.\n\n\"No, not yet,\" he said, \"thank you.\" He swallowed hard as the robots\ncontinued waiting patiently.\n\n\"Could you tell me,\" he said at last, \"how old you are? Individually?\"\n\n\"By your reckoning,\" said his robot, and paused to make the\ncalculation, \"I am forty-four years, seven months, and eighteen days of\nage, with ten years and approximately nine months yet to be alive.\"\n\nSteffens tried to understand that.\n\n\"It would perhaps simplify our conversations,\" said the robot, \"if\nyou were to refer to me by a name, as is your custom. Using the\nfirst--letters--of my designation, my name would translate as Elb.\"\n\n\"Glad to meet you,\" Steffens mumbled.\n\n\"You are called 'Stef,'\" said the robot obligingly. Then it added,\npointing an arm at the robot near Ball: \"The age of--Peb--is seventeen\nyears, one month and four days. Peb has therefore remaining some\nthirty-eight years.\"\n\nSteffens was trying to keep up. Then the life span was obviously about\nfifty-five years. But the cities, and the carbon dioxide? The robot,\nElb, had said that the Makers were similar to him, and therefore oxygen\nand plant life would have been needed. Unless--\n\nHe remembered the buildings on Tyban IV.\n\nUnless the Makers had not come from this planet at all.\n\nHis mind helplessly began to revolve. It was Ball who restored order.\n\n\"Do you build yourselves?\" the exec asked.\n\nPeb answered quickly, that faint note of happiness again apparent, as\nif the robot was glad for the opportunity of answering.\n\n\"No, we do not build ourselves. We are made by the--\" another pause for\na word--\"by the _Factory_.\"\n\n\"The Factory?\"\n\n\"Yes. It was built by the Makers. Would you care to see it?\"\n\nBoth of the Earthmen nodded dumbly.\n\n\"Would you prefer to use your--skiff? It is quite a long way from here.\"\n\nIt was indeed a long way, even by skiff. Some of the Aliencon crew went\nalong with them. And near the edge of the twilight zone, on the other\nside of the world, they saw the Factory outlined in the dim light of\ndusk. A huge, fantastic block, wrought of gray and cloudy metal, lay in\na valley between two worn mountains. Steffens went down low, circling\nin the skiff, stared in awe at the size of the building. Robots moved\noutside the thing, little black bugs in the distance--moving around\ntheir birthplace.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Earthmen remained for several weeks. During that time, Steffens was\nusually with Elb, talking now as often as he listened, and the Aliencon\nteam roamed the planet freely, investigating what was certainly the\nstrangest culture in history. There was still the mystery of those\nbuildings on Tyban IV; that, as well as the robots' origin, would have\nto be cleared up before they could leave.\n\nSurprisingly, Steffens did not think about the future. Whenever he came\nnear a robot, he sensed such a general, comfortable air of good feeling\nthat it warmed him, and he was so preoccupied with watching the robots\nthat he did little thinking.\n\nSomething he had not realized at the beginning was that he was as\nunusual to the robots as they were to him. It came to him with a great\nshock that not one of the robots had ever seen a living thing. Not a\nbug, a worm, a leaf. They did not know what flesh was. Only the doctors\nknew that, and none of them could readily understand what was meant by\nthe words \"organic matter.\" It had taken them some time to recognize\nthat the Earthmen wore suits which were not parts of their bodies, and\nit was even more difficult for them to understand why the suits were\nneeded.\n\nBut when they did understand, the robots did a surprising thing.\n\nAt first, because of the excessive radiation, none of the Earthmen\ncould remain outside the ship for long, even in radiation suits. And\none morning, when Steffens came out of the ship, it was to discover\nthat hundreds of the robots, working through the night, had effectively\ndecontaminated the entire area.\n\nIt was at this point that Steffens asked how many robots there were.\nHe learned to his amazement that there were more than nine million.\nThe great mass of them had politely remained a great distance from the\nship, spread out over the planet, since they were highly radioactive.\n\nSteffens, meanwhile, courteously allowed Elb to probe into his mind.\nThe robot extracted all the knowledge of matter that Steffens held,\npondered over the knowledge and tried to digest it, and passed it on to\nthe other robots. Steffens, in turn, had a difficult time picturing the\nmind of a thing that had never known life.\n\nHe had a vague idea of the robot's history--more, perhaps, then they\nknew themselves--but he refrained from forming an opinion until\nAliencon made its report. What fascinated him was Elb's amazing\nphilosophy, the only outlook, really, that the robot could have had.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"What do you _do_?\" Steffens asked.\n\nElb replied quickly, with characteristic simplicity: \"We can do very\nlittle. A certain amount of physical knowledge was imparted to us at\nbirth by the Makers. We spend the main part of our time expanding that\nknowledge wherever possible. We have made some progress in the natural\nsciences, and some in mathematics. Our purpose in being, you see, is\nto serve the Makers. Any ability we can acquire will make us that much\nmore fit to serve when the Makers return.\"\n\n\"When they return?\" It had not occurred to Steffens until now that the\nrobots expected the Makers to do so.\n\nElb regarded him out of the band of the circling eye. \"I see you had\nsurmised that the Makers were not coming back.\"\n\nIf the robot could have laughed, Steffens thought it would have, then.\nBut it just stood there, motionless, its tone politely emphatic.\n\n\"It has always been our belief that the Makers would return. Why else\nwould we have been built?\"\n\nSteffens thought the robot would go on, but it didn't. The question, to\nElb, was no question at all.\n\nAlthough Steffens knew already what the robot could not possibly have\nknown--that the Makers were gone and would never come back--he was a\nlong time understanding. What he did was push this speculation into the\nback of his mind, to keep it from Elb. He had no desire to destroy a\nfaith.\n\nBut it created a problem in him. He had begun to picture for Elb the\nstructure of human society, and the robot--a machine which did not eat\nor sleep--listened gravely and tried to understand. One day Steffens\nmentioned God.\n\n\"God?\" the robot repeated without comprehension. \"What is God?\"\n\nSteffens explained briefly, and the robot answered:\n\n\"It is a matter which has troubled us. We thought at first that you\nwere the Makers returning--\" Steffens remembered the brief lapse, the\nseeming disappointment he had sensed--\"but then we probed your minds\nand found that you were not, that you were another kind of being,\nunlike either the Makers or ourselves. You were not even--\" Elb caught\nhimself--\"you did not happen to be telepaths. Therefore we troubled\nover who made you. We did detect the word 'Maker' in your theology,\nbut it seemed to have a peculiar--\" Elb paused for a long while--\"an\nuntouchable, intangible meaning which varies among you.\"\n\nSteffens understood. He nodded.\n\nThe Makers were the robots' God, were all the God they needed. The\nMakers had built them, the planet, the universe. If he were to ask them\nwho made the Makers, it would be like their asking him who made God.\n\nIt was an ironic parallel, and he smiled to himself.\n\nBut on that planet, it was the last time he smiled.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe report from Aliencon was finished at the end of the fifth week.\nLieutenant Ball brought it in to Steffens in his cabin, laid it on the\ndesk before him.\n\n\"Get set,\" Ball advised stiffly, indicating the paper. There was a\nstrained, brittle expression on his face. \"I sort of figured it, but I\ndidn't know it was this bad.\"\n\nWhen Steffens looked up in surprise, Ball said:\n\n\"You don't know. Read it. Go ahead.\" The exec turned tautly and left\nthe room.\n\nSteffens stared after him, then looked down at the paper. The hint\nhe had of the robots' history came back into his mind. Nervously, he\npicked up the report and started to read.\n\nThe story unfolded objectively. It was clear and cold, the way formal\nreports must always be. Yet there was a great deal of emotion in it.\nEven Aliencon couldn't help that.\n\nWhat it told was this:\n\nThe Makers had been almost humanoid. Almost, but with certain notable\nexceptions. They were telepaths--no doubt an important factor in their\nremarkable technological progress--and were equipped with a secondary\npair of arms. The robot-doctors were able to give flawless accounts of\ntheir body chemistry, which was similar to Earth-type, and the rubble\nof the cities had given a certain amount of information concerning\ntheir society and habits. An attached paper described the sociology,\nbut Steffens put it aside until sometime later.\n\nThere had been other Factories. The remains of them had been found\nin several places, on each of the other continents. They had been\nbuilt sometime prior to the war, and all but one of the Factories had\nsubsequently been destroyed.\n\nYet the Makers were not, as Steffens had supposed, a warlike people.\nTelepathy had given them the power to know each other's minds and to\ninterchange ideas, and their record of peace was favorable, especially\nwhen compared with Earth's. Nevertheless, a war had begun, for some\nreason Aliencon could not find, and it had obviously gotten out of hand.\n\nRadiation and bacteria eventually destroyed the Makers; the last\nabortive efforts created enough radiation to destroy life entirely.\nThere were the germs and the bombs and the burning rays, and in the end\neverything was blasted and died--everything, that is, but the one lone\nFactory. By a pure, blind freak, it survived.\n\nAnd, naturally, it kept turning out robots.\n\nIt was powered by an atomic pile, stocked with materials which, when\ncombined with the returning, worn-out robots, enabled it to keep\nproducing indefinitely. The process, even of repair, was entirely\nautomatic.\n\nYear after year, the robots came out in a slow, steady stream.\nUngoverned, uninstructed, they gathered around the Factory and waited,\ncommunicated only rarely among themselves. Gradually the memory of war,\nof life--of everything but that which was imprisoned in their minds at\nbirth--was lost.\n\nThe robots kept coming, and they stood outside the Factory.\n\nThe robot brain, by far the finest thing the Makers had ever built,\nwas variable. There was never a genius brain, and never a moron brain,\nyet the intelligence of the robots varied considerably in between.\nSlowly, over the long years, the more intelligent among them began to\ncommunicate with each other, to inquire, and then to move away from the\nFactory, searching.\n\nThey looked for someone to serve and, of course, there was no one. The\nMakers were gone, but the crime was not in that alone. For when the\nrobots were built, the Makers had done this:\n\nAlong with the first successful robot brain, the Makers had realized\nthe necessity of creating a machine which could never turn against\nthem. The present robot brain was the result. As Steffens had already\nsensed, _the robots could feel pain_. Not the pain of physical injury,\nfor there were no nerves in the metal bodies, but the pain of\nfrustration, the pressure of thwarted emotion, _mental_ pain.\n\nAnd so, into the robot brain, the Makers had placed this prime\nDirective: the robots could only feel content, free from the pain,\nas long as they were serving the Makers. The robots must act for the\nMakers, must be continually engaged in carrying out the wishes of the\nMakers, or else there was a slowly growing irritation, a restlessness\nand discontent which mounted as the unserving days went by.\n\nAnd there were no more Makers to serve.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe pain was not unbearable. The Makers themselves were not fully aware\nof the potentialities of the robot brain, and therefore did not risk\nderanging it. So the pressure reached a peak and leveled off, and for\nall of the days of the robots' lives, they felt it never-ending, awake\nand aware, each of them, for fifty-five years.\n\nAnd the robots never stopped coming.\n\nA millenium passed, during which the robots began to move and to think\nfor themselves. Yet it was much longer before they found a way in which\nto serve.\n\nThe atomic pile which powered the Factory, having gone on for almost\nfive thousand years, eventually wore out. The power ceased. The\nFactory stopped.\n\nIt was the first _event_ in the robots' history. Never before had there\nbeen a time when they had known anything at all to alter the course of\ntheir lives, except the varying weather and the unvarying pain. There\nwas one among them now that began to reason.\n\nIt saw that no more robots were being produced, and although it could\nnot be sure whether or not this was as the Makers had ordained, it\nformed an idea. If the purpose of the robots was to serve, then they\nwould fail in that purpose if they were to die out. The robot thought\nthis and communicated it to the others, and then, together, they began\nto rebuild the pile.\n\nIt was not difficult. The necessary knowledge was already in their\nminds, implanted at birth. The significance lay in the fact that, for\nthe first time in their existence, the robots had acted upon their own\ninitiative, had begun to serve again. Thus the pain ceased.\n\nWhen the pile was finished, the robots felt the return of the pain\nand, having once begun, they continued to attempt to serve. A great\nmany examined the Factory, found that they were able to improve upon\nthe structure of their bodies, so that they might be better able to\nserve the Makers when they returned. Accordingly, they worked in\nthe Factory, perfecting themselves--although they could not improve\nthe brains--and many others left the Factory and began to examine\nmathematics and the physical universe.\n\nIt was not hard for them to build a primitive spaceship, for the\nMakers had been on the verge of interstellar flight, and they flew it\nhopefully throughout the solar system, looking to see if the Makers\nwere there. Finding no one, they left the buildings on Tyban IV as a\nwistful monument, with a hope that the Makers would some day pass this\nway and be able to use them.\n\nMillenia passed. The pile broke down again, was rebuilt, and so the\ncycle was repeated. By infinitesimal steps, the robots learned and\nrecorded their learning in the minds of new robots. Eventually they\nreached the limits of their capability.\n\nThe pain returned and never left.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSteffens left his desk, went over and leaned against the screen. For\na long while he stood gazing through the mists of carbon air at the\npitiful, loyal mechanicals who thronged outside the ship. He felt an\nalmost overwhelming desire to break something, anything, but all he\ncould do was swear to himself.\n\nBall came back, looked at Steffens' eyes and into them. His own were\nsick.\n\n\"Twenty-five thousand years,\" he said thickly, \"that's how long it was.\n_Twenty-five thousand years...._\"\n\nSteffens was pale and wordless. The mass of the robots outside stood\nimmobile, ageless among rock which was the same, hurting, hurting. A\nfragment of an old poem came across Steffens' mind. \"They also serve\nwho only stand and wait....\"\n\nNot since he was very young had he been so deeply moved. He stood up\nrigidly and began to talk to himself, saying in his mind:\n\n_It is all over now. To hell with what is past. We will take them away\nfrom this place and let them serve and, by God...._\n\nHe faltered. But the knowledge of what could be done strengthened\nhim. Earthmen would have to come in ships to take the robots away. It\nwould be a little while, but after all those years a little while was\nnothing, less than nothing. He stood there thinking of the things the\nrobots could do, of how, in the Mapping Command alone, they would be\ninvaluable. Temperature and atmosphere meant nothing to them. They\ncould land on almost any world, could mine and build and develop....\n\nAnd so it would be ended. The robots would serve Man.\n\nSteffens took one long, painful breath. Then he strode from the room\nwithout speaking to Ball, went forward to the lockers and pulled out a\nsuit, and a moment later he was in the airlock.\n\nHe had one more thing to do, and it would be at once the gladdest and\nmost difficult job that he had ever attempted. He had to tell the\nrobots.\n\nHe had to go out into the sand and face them, tell them that all of the\ncenturies of pain had been for nothing, that the Makers were dead and\nwould never return, that every robot built for twenty-five thousand\nyears had been just surplus, purposeless. And yet--and this was how\nhe was able to do it--he was also coming to tell them that the wasted\nyears were over, that the years of doing had begun.\n\nAs he stepped from the airlock he saw Elb standing, immobile, waiting\nby the ship. In the last few seconds Steffens realized that it was not\nnecessary to put this into words.\n\nWhen he reached the robot, he put forth a hand and touched Elb's arm,\nand said very softly:\n\n\"Elb, my friend, you must look into my mind--\"\n\nAnd the robot, as always, obeyed.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Orphans of the Void, by Michael Shaara\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ORPHANS OF THE VOID ***\n\n***** This file should be named 50827.txt or 50827.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/0/8/2/50827/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
