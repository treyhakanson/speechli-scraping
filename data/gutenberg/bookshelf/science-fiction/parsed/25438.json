PAUL\n\n_Copyright, 1927, by E. P. Co., Inc._\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nThe Airlords Besieged\n\n\nIn a previous record of my adventures in the early part of the Second\nWar of Independence I explained how I, Anthony Rogers, was overcome by\nradioactive gases in an abandoned mine near Scranton in the year 1927,\nwhere I existed in a state of suspended animation for nearly five\nhundred years; and awakened to find that the America I knew had been\ncrushed under the cruel tyranny of the Airlords of Han, fierce\nMongolians, who, as scientists now contend, had in their blood a taint\nnot of this earth, and who with science and resources far in advance of\nthose of a United States, economically prostrate at the end of a long\nseries of wars with a Bolshevik Europe, in the year 2270 A.D., had swept\ndown from the skies in their great airships that rode \"repeller rays\" as\na ball rides the stream of a fountain, and with their terrible\n\"disintegrator rays\" had destroyed more than four-fifths of the American\nrace, and driven the other fifth to cover in the vast forests which grew\nup over the remains of the once mighty civilization of the United\nStates.\n\nI explained the part I played in the fall of the year 2419, when the\nrugged Americans, with science secretly developed to terrific efficiency\nin their forest fastness, turned fiercely and assumed the aggressive\nagainst a now effete Han population, which for generations had shut\nitself up in the fifteen great Mongolian cities of America, having\nabandoned cultivation of the soil and the operation of mines; for these\nHans produced all they needed in the way of food, clothing, shelter and\nmachinery through electrono-synthetic processes.\n\nI explained how I was adopted into the Wyoming Gang, or clan,\ndescendants of the original populations of Wilkes-Barre, Scranton and\nthe Wyoming Valley in Pennsylvania; how quite by accident I stumbled\nupon a method of destroying Han aircraft by shooting explosive rockets,\nnot directly at the heavily armored ships, but at the repeller ray\ncolumns, which automatically drew the rockets upward where they exploded\nin the generators of the aircraft; how the Wyomings threw the first\nthrill of terror into the Airlords by bringing an entire squadron\ncrashing to earth; how a handful of us in a rocketship successfully\nraided the Han city of Nu-Yok; and how by the application of military\nprinciples I remembered from the First World War, I was able to lead the\nWyomings to victory over the Sinsings, a Hudson River tribe which had\nformed a traitorous alliance with the hereditary enemies and oppressors\nof the White Race in America.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBy the Spring of 2420 A.D., a short six months after these events, the\npositions of the Yellow and the White Races in America had been\nreversed. The hunted were now the hunters. The Hans desperately were\nincreasing the defenses of their fifteen cities, around each of which\nthe American Gangs had drawn a widely deployed line of long-gunners;\nwhile nervous air convoys, closely bunched behind their protective\nscreen of disintegrator beams, kept up sporadic and costly systems of\ntransportation between the cities.\n\nDuring this period our own campaign against the Hans of Nu-Yok was\nfairly typical of the development of the war throughout the country. Our\nforce was composed of contingents from most of the Gangs of\nPennsylvania, Jersey and New England. We encircled the city on a wide\nradius, our line running roughly from Staten Island to the forested site\nof the ancient city of Elizabeth, to First and Second Mountains just\nwest of the ruins of Newark, Bloomfield and Montclair, thence\nnortheasterly across the Hudson, and down to the Sound. On Long Island\nour line was pushed forward to the first slopes of the hills.\n\nWe had no more than four long-gunners to the square mile in our first\nline, but each of these was equal to a battery of heavy artillery such\nas I had known in the First World War. And when their fire was first\nconcentrated on the Han city, they blew its outer walls and roof levels\ninto a chaotic mass of wreckage before the nervous Yellow engineers\ncould turn on the ring of generators which surrounded the city with a\nvertical film of disintegrator rays. Our explosive rockets could not\npenetrate this film, for it disintegrated them instantly and harmlessly,\nas it did all other material substance with the sole exception of\n\"inertron,\" that synthetic element developed by the Americans from the\nsub-electronic and ultronic orders.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe continuous operation of the disintegrators destroyed the air and\nmaintained a constant vacuum wherever they played, into which the\nsurrounding air continuously rushed, naturally creating atmospheric\ndisturbances after a time, which resulted in a local storm. This,\nhowever, ceased after a number of hours, when the flow of air toward the\ncity became steady.\n\nThe Hans suffered severely from atmospheric conditions inside their city\nat first, but later rearranged their disintegrator ring in a system of\noverlapping films that left diagonal openings, through which the air\nrushed to them, and through which their ships emerged to scout our\npositions.\n\nWe shot down seven of their cruisers before they realized the folly of\nfloating individually over our invisible line. Their beams traced paths\nof destruction like scars across the countryside, but caught less than\nhalf a dozen of our gunners all told, for it takes a lot of time to\nsweep every square foot of a square mile with a beam whose cross section\nis not more than twenty or twenty-five feet in diameter. Our gunners,\ncompletely concealed beneath the foliage of the forest, with weapons\nwhich did not reveal their position, as did the flashes and detonation\nof the Twentieth Century artillery, hit their repeller rays with\ncomparative ease.\n\nThe \"drop ships,\" which the Hans next sent out, were harder to handle.\nRising to immense heights behind the city's disintegrator wall, these\ntiny, projectile-like craft slipped through the rifts in the cylinder of\ndestruction, and then turning off their repeller rays, dropped at\nterrific speed until their small vanes were sufficient to support them\nas they volplaned in great circles, shooting back into the city defenses\nat a lower level.\n\nThe great speed of these craft made it almost impossible to register a\ndirect hit against them with rocket guns, and they had no repeller rays\nat which we might shoot while they were over our lines.\n\nBut by the same token they were able to do little damage to us. So great\nwas the speed of a drop ship, that the only way in which it could use a\ndisintegrator ray was from a fixed generator in the nose of the\nstructure, as it dropped in a straight line toward its target. But since\nthey could not sight the widely deployed individual gunners in our line,\ntheir scouting was just as ineffective as our attempts were to shoot\nthem down.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor more than a month the situation remained a deadlock, with the Hans\nlocked up in their cities, while we mobilized gunners and supplies.\n\nHad our stock of inertron been sufficiently great at this period, we\ncould have ended the war quickly, with aircraft impervious to the \"dis\"\nray. But the production of inertron is a painfully slow process,\ninvolving the building up of this weightless element from ultronic\nvibrations through the sub-electronic, electronic and atomic states into\nmolecular form. Our laboratories had barely begun production on a\nquantity basis, for we had just learned how to protect them from Han air\nraids, and it would be many months more before the supply they had just\nstarted to manufacture would be finished. In the meantime we had enough\nfor a few aircraft, for jumping belts and a small amount of armor.\n\nWe Wyomings possessed one swooper completely sheathed with inertron and\ncounterweighted with ultron. The Altoonas and the Lycomings also had\none apiece. But a shielded swooper, while impervious to the \"dis\" ray,\nwas helpless against squadrons of Han aircraft, for the Hans developed a\ntechnique of playing their beams underneath the swooper in such fashion\nas to suck it down flutteringly into the vacuum so created, until they\nbrought it finally, and more or less violently, to earth.\n\nUltimately the Hans broke our blockade to a certain extent, when they\nresumed traffic between their cities in great convoys, protected by\nsquadrons of cruisers in vertical formation, playing a continuous\ncross-fire of disintegrator beams ahead of them and down on the sides in\na most effective screen, so that it was very difficult for us to get a\nrocket through to the repeller rays.\n\nBut we lined the scar paths beneath their air routes for miles at a\nstretch with concealed gunners, some of whom would sooner or later\nregister hits, and it was seldom that a convoy made the trip between\nNu-Yok and Bos-Tan, Bah-Flo, Si-ka-ga or Ah-la-nah without losing\nseveral of its ships.\n\nHans who reached the ground alive were never taken prisoner. Not even\nthe splendid discipline of the Americans could curb the wild hate\ndeveloped through centuries of dastardly oppression, and the Hans were\nmercilessly slaughtered, when they did not save us the trouble by\ncommitting suicide.\n\nSeveral times the Hans drove \"air wedges\" over our lines in this\nvertical or \"cloud bank\" formation, ploughing a scar path a mile or more\nwide through our positions. But at worst, to us, this did not mean the\nloss of more than a dozen men and girls, and generally their raids cost\nthem one or more ships. They cut paths of destruction across the map,\nbut they could not cover the entire area, and when they had ploughed out\nover our lines, there was nothing left for them to do but to turn around\nand plough back to Nu-Yok. Our lines closed up again after each raid,\nand we continued to take heavy toll from convoys and raiding fleets.\nFinally they abandoned these tactics.\n\nSo at the time of which I speak, the Spring of 2420 A.D., the Americans\nand the Hans were temporarily at pretty much of a deadlock. But the Hans\nwere as desperate as we were sanguine, for we had time on our side.\n\nIt was at this period that we first learned of the Airlords'\ndetermination, a very unpopular one with their conscripted populations,\nto carry the fight to us on the ground. The time had passed when\ncommand of the air meant victory. We had no visible cities nor massed\nbodies of men for them to destroy, nothing but vast stretches of silent\nforests and hills, where our forces lurked, invisible from the air.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nThe \"Ground Ships\" Threaten\n\n\nOne of our Wyoming girls, on contact guard near Pocono, blundered into a\nhunting camp of the Bad Bloods, one of the renegade American Gangs,\nwhich occupied the Blue Mountain section north of Delaware Water Gap. We\nhad not invited their cooperation in this campaign, for they were under\nsome suspicion of having trafficked with the Hans in past years, but\nthey had offered no objection to our passage through their territory in\nour advance on Nu-Yok.\n\nFortunately our contact guard had been able to leap into the upper\nbranches of a tree without being discovered by the Bad Bloods, for their\ndiscipline was lax and their guard careless. She overheard enough of the\nconversation of their Bosses around the camp fire beneath her to\nindicate the general nature of the Han plans.\n\nAfter several hours she was able to leap away unobserved through the\ntopmost branches of the trees, and after putting several miles between\nherself and their camp, she ultrophoned a full report to her Contact\nBoss back in the Wyoming Valley. My own Ultrophone Field Boss picked up\nthe message and brought the graph record of it to me at once.\n\nHer report was likewise picked up by the Bosses of the various Gang\nunits in our line, and we had called a council to discuss our plans by\nword of mouth.\n\nWe were gathered in a sheltered glade on the eastern slope of First\nMountain on a balmy night in May. Far to the east, across the forested\nslopes of the lowlands, the flat stretches of open meadow and the rocky\nridge that once had been Jersey City, the iridescent glow of Nu-Yok's\nprotecting film of annihilation shot upward, gradually fading into a\nstarry sky.\n\nIn the faint glow of our ultronolamps, I made out the great figure and\nrugged features of Boss Casaman, commander of the Mifflin unit, and the\ngray uniform of Boss Warn, who led the Sandsnipers of the Barnegat\nBeaches, and who had swooped over from his headquarters on Sandy Hook.\nBy his side stood Boss Handan of the Winslows, a Gang from Central\nJersee. In the group also were the leaders of the Altoonas, the\nCamerons, the Lycomings, Susquannas, Harshbargs, Hagersduns, Chesters,\nReddings, Delawares, Elmirans, Kiugas, Hudsons and Connedigas.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMost of them were clad in forest-green uniforms that showed black at\nnight, but each had some distinctive badge or item of uniform or\nequipment that distinguished his Gang.\n\nBoth the Mifflin and Altoona Bosses, for instance, wore heavy-looking\nboots with jointed knees. They came from sections that were not only\nmountainous, but rocky, where \"leaping\" involves many a slip and bruised\nlimb, unless some protection of this sort is worn. But these boots were\nnot as heavy as they looked, being counter-balanced somewhat with\ninertron.\n\nThe headgear of the Winslows was quite different from the close-fitting\nhelmet of the Wyomings, being large and bushy-looking, for in the\nWinslow territory there were many stretches of nearly bare land, with\noccasional scrubby pines, and a Winslow caught in the open, on the\napproach of a Han airship, would twist himself into a motionless\nimitation of a scrubby plant, that passed very successfully for the real\nthing, when viewed from several thousand feet in the air.\n\nThe Susquannas had a unit that was equipped with inertron shields, that\nwere of the same shape as those of the ancient Romans, but much larger,\nand capable of concealing their bearers from head to foot when they\ncrouched slightly. These shields, of course, were colored forest green,\nand were irregularly shaded; they were balanced with inertron, so that\ntheir effective weight was only a few ounces. They were curious too, in\nthat they had handles for both hands, and two small reservoir\nrocket-guns built into them as integral parts.\n\nIn going into action, the Susquannas crouched slightly, holding the\nshields before them with both hands, looking through a narrow vision\nslit, and working both rocket guns. The shields, however, were a great\nhandicap in leaping, and in advancing through heavy forest growth.\n\nThe field unit of the Delawares was also heavily armored. It was one of\nthe most efficient bodies of shock troops in our entire line. They\ncarried circular shields, about three feet in diameter, with a vision\nslit and a small rocket gun. These shields were held at arm's length in\nthe left hand on going into action. In the right hand was carried an\nax-gun, an affair not unlike the battle-ax of the Middle Ages. It was\nabout three feet long. The shaft consisted of a rocket gun, with an\nax-blade near the muzzle, and a spike at the other end. It was a\nterrible weapon. Jointed leg-guards protected the ax-gunner below the\nrim of his shield, and a hemispherical helmet, the front section of\nwhich was of transparent ultron reaching down to the chin, completed his\nequipment.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Susquannas also had a long-gun unit in the field.\n\nOne company of my Wyomings I had equipped with a weapon which I designed\nmyself. It was a long-gun which I had adapted for bayonet tactics such\nas American troops used in the First World War, in the Twentieth\nCentury. It was about the length of the ancient rifle, and was fitted\nwith a short knife bayonet. The stock, however, was replaced by a narrow\nax-blade and a spike. It had two hand-guards also. It was fired from the\nwaist position.\n\nIn hand-to-hand work one lunged with the bayonet in a vicious, swinging\nup-thrust, following through with an up-thrust of the ax-blade as one\nrushed in on one's opponent, and then a down-thrust of the butt-spike,\ndeveloping into a down-slice of the bayonet, and a final upward jerk of\nthe bayonet at the throat and chin with a shortened grip on the barrel,\nwhich had been allowed to slide through the hands at the completion of\nthe down-slice.\n\nI almost regretted that we would not find ourselves opposed to the\nDelaware ax-men in this campaign, so curious was I to compare the\nefficiency of the two bodies.\n\nBut both the Delawares and my own men were elated at the news that the\nHans intended to fight it out on the ground at last, and the prospect\nthat we might in consequence come to close quarters with them.\n\nMany of the Gang Bosses were dubious about our Wyoming policy of\nproviding our fighters with no inertron armor as protection against the\ndisintegrator ray of the Hans. Some of them even questioned the value of\nall weapons intended for hand-to-hand fighting.\n\nAs Warn, of the Sandsnipers put it: \"You should be in a better position\nthan anyone, Rogers, with your memories of the Twentieth Century, to\nappreciate that between the superdeadliness of the rocket gun and of the\ndisintegrator ray there will never be any opportunity for hand-to-hand\nwork. Long before the opposing forces could come to grips, one or the\nother will be wiped out.\"\n\nBut I only smiled, for I remembered how much of this same talk there was\nfive centuries ago, and that it was even predicted in 1914 that no war\ncould last more than six months.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat there would be hand-to-hand work before we were through, and in\nplenty, I was convinced, and so every able-bodied youth I could muster\nwas enrolled in my infantry battalion and spent most of his time in\nvigorous bayonet practice. And for the same reason I had discarded the\nidea of armor. I felt it would be clumsy, and questioned its value.\nTrue, it was an absolute bar against the disintegrator ray, but of what\nuse would that be if a Han ray found a crevice between overlapping\nplates, or if the ray was used to annihilate the very earth beneath the\nwearer's feet?\n\nThe only protective equipment that I thought was worth a whoop was a\nvery peculiar device with which a contingent of five hundred Altoonas\nwas supplied. They called it the \"umbra-shield.\" It was a bell-shaped\naffair of inertron, counterweighted with ultron, about eight feet high.\nThe gunner, who walked inside it, carried it easily with two shoulder\nstraps. There were handles inside too, by which the gunner might more\neasily balance it when running, or lift it to clear any obstructions on\nthe ground.\n\nIn the apex of the affair, above his head, was a small turret,\ncontaining an automatic rocket gun. The periscopic gun sight and the\ncontrols were on a level with the operator's eyes. In going into action\nhe could, after taking up his position, simply stoop until the rim of\nthe umbra-shield rested on the ground, or else slip off the shoulder\nstraps, and stand there, quite safe from the disintegrator ray, and work\nhis gun.\n\nBut again, I could not see what was to prevent the Hans from slicing\nunderneath it, instead of directly at it, with their rays.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs I saw it, any American who was unfortunate enough to get in the\ndirect path of a \"dis\" ray, was almost certain to \"go out,\" unless he\nwas locked up tight in a complete shell of inertron, as for instance, in\nan inertron swooper. It seemed to me better to concentrate all our\nefforts on tactics of attack, trusting to our ability to get the Hans\nbefore they got us.\n\nI had one other main unit besides my bayonet battalion, a long-gun\ncontingent composed entirely of girls, as were my scout units and most\nof my auxiliary contingents. These youngsters had been devoting\nthemselves to target practice for months, and had developed a fine\ntechnique of range-finding and the various other tactics of Twentieth\nCentury massed artillery, to which was added the scientific perfection\nof the rocket guns and an average mental alertness that would have put\nthe artilleryman of the First World War to shame.\n\nFrom the information our contact guard had obtained, it appeared that\nthe Hans had developed a type of \"groundship\" completely protected by a\ndisintegrator ray \"canopy\" that was operated from a short mast, and\nspread down around it as a cone.\n\nThese ships were merely adaptations of their airships, and were designed\nto travel but a few feet above the ground. Their repeller rays were\nrelatively weak; just strong enough to lift them about ten or twelve\nfeet from the surface. Hence they would draw but lightly upon the power\nbroadcast from the city, and great numbers of them could be used. A\nspecial ray at the stern propelled them, and an extra-lift ray in the\nbow enabled them to nose up over ground obstacles. Their most formidable\nfeature was the cone-shaped \"canopy\" of short-range disintegrator rays\ndesigned to spread down around them from a circular generator at the tip\nof a twenty-foot mast amidship. This would annihilate any projectile\nshot at it, for they naturally could not reach the ship without passing\nthrough the cone of rays.\n\nIt was instantly obvious that the \"ground ships\" would prove to be the\n\"tanks\" of the Twenty-fifth Century, and with due allowance for the fact\nthat they were protected with a sheathing of annihilating rays instead\nof with steel, that they would have about the same handicaps and\nadvantages as tanks, except that since they would float lightly on short\nrepeller rays, they could hardly resort to the destructive crushing\ntactics of the tanks of the First World War.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs soon as our first supplies of inertron-sheathed rockets came through,\ntheir invulnerability would be at an end, as indeed would be that of the\nHan cities themselves. But these projectiles were not yet out of the\nfactories.\n\nIn the meantime, however, the groundships would be hard to handle. Each\nof them we understood would be equipped with a thin long-range \"dis\"\nray, mounted in a turret at the base of the mast.\n\nWe had no information as to the probable tactics of the Hans in the use\nof these ships. One sure method of destroying them would be to bury\nmines in their path, too deep for the penetration of their protecting\ncanopy, which would not, our engineers estimated, cut deeper than about\nthree feet a second. But we couldn't ring Nu-Yok with a continuous mine\non a radius of from five to fifteen or twenty miles. Nor could we be\ncertain beforehand of the direction of their attack.\n\nIn the end, after several hours' discussion, we agreed on a flexible\ndefense. Rather than risk many lives, we would withdraw before them,\ntest their effectiveness and familiarize ourselves with the tactics they\nadopted. If possible, we would send engineers in behind them from the\nflanks, to lay mines in the probable path of their return, providing\ntheir first attack proved to be a raid and not an advance to consolidate\nnew positions.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nWe \"Sink\" the \"Ground Ships\"\n\n\nBoss Handan, of the Winslows, a giant of a man, a two-fisted fighter and\na leader of great sagacity, had been selected by the council as our Boss\n_pro tem_, and having given the scatter signal to the council, he\nretired to our general headquarters, which we had established on Second\nMountain a few miles in the rear of the fighting front in a deep ravine.\n\nThere, in quarters cut far below the surface, he would observe every\ndetail of the battle on the wonderful system of viewplates our ultrono\nengineers had constructed through a series of relays from ultroscope\nobservation posts and individual \"_cameramen_.\"\n\nTwo hours before dawn our long distance _scopemen_ reported a squadron\nof \"ground ships\" leaving the enemy's disintegrator wall, and heading\nrapidly somewhat to the south of us, toward the site of the ancient city\nof Newark. The ultroscopes could detect no canopy operation. This in\nitself was not significant, for they were penetrating hills in their\nlines of vision, most of them, which of course blurred their pictures to\na slight extent. But by now we had a well-equipped electronoscope\ndivision, with instruments nearly equal to those of the Hans themselves;\nand these could detect no evidence of _dis_ rays in operation.\n\nHandan appreciated our opportunity instantly, for no sooner had the\nimport of the message on the Bosses' channel become clear than we heard\nhis personal command snapped out over the long-gunners' general channel.\n\nNine hundred and seventy long-gunners on the south and west sides of the\ncity, concealed in the dark fastnesses of the forests and hillsides,\nleaped to their guns, switched on their dial lights, and flipped the\nlittle lever combinations on their pieces that automatically registered\nthem on the predetermined position of map section HM-243-839, setting\ntheir magazines for twenty shots, and pressing their fire buttons.\n\nFor what seemed an interminable instant nothing happened.\n\nThen several miles to the southeast, an entire section of the country\nliterally blew up, in a fiery eruption that shot a mile into the air.\nThe concussion, when it reached me, was terrific. The light was\nblinding.\n\nAnd our _scopemen_ reported the instant annihilation of the squadron.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhat happened, of course, was this; the Hans knew nothing of our ability\nto see at night through our ultroscopes. Regarding itself as invisible\nin the darkness, and believing our instruments would pick up its\nlocation when its _dis_ rays went into operation, the squadron made the\nfatal error of not turning on its canopies.\n\nTo say that consternation overwhelmed the Han high command would be\nputting it mildly. Despite their use of code and other protective\nexpedients, we picked up enough of their messages to know that the\nincident badly demoralized them.\n\nTheir next attempt was made in daylight. I was aloft in my swooper at\nthe time, hanging motionless about a mile up. Below, the groundships\nlooked like a number of oval lozenges gliding across a map, each\nsurrounded by a circular halo of luminescence that was its _dis_ ray\ncanopy.\n\nThey had nosed up over the spiny ridge of what once had been Jersey\nCity, and were moving across the meadowlands. There were twenty of them.\n\nComing to the darker green that marked the forest on the \"map\" below me,\nthey adopted a wedge formation, and playing their pencil rays ahead of\nthem, they began to beam a path for themselves through the forest. In my\nears sounded the ultrophone instructions of my executives to the\nlong-gunners in the forest, and one by one I heard the girls report\ntheir rapid retirement with their guns and other inertron-lightened\nequipment. I located several of them with my scopes, with which I could,\nof course, focus through the leafy screen above them, and noted with\nsatisfaction the unhurried speed of their movements.\n\nOn ploughed the Han wedge, while my girls separated before it and\nretired to the sides. With a rapidity much greater than that of the\nships themselves, the beams penetrated deeper and deeper into the\nforest, playing continuously in the same direction, literally melting\ntheir way through, as a stream of hot water might melt its way through a\nsnow bank.\n\nThen a curious thing happened. One of the ships near one wing of the\nwedge must have passed over unusually soft ground, or perhaps some\nirregularity in the control of its canopy generator caused it to dig\ndeeper into the earth ahead of it, for it gave a sudden downward lurch,\nand on coming up out of it, swerved a bit to one side, its offense beam\nslicing full into the ship echeloned to the left ahead of it. That ship,\nall but a few plates on one side, instantly vanished from sight. But the\nsquadron could not stop. As soon as a ship stood still, its canopy ray\nplaying continuously in one spot, the ground around it was annihilated\nto a continuously increasing depth. A couple of them tried it, but\nwithin a space of seconds, they had dug such deep holes around\nthemselves that they had difficulty in climbing out. Their commanders,\nhowever, had the foresight to switch off their offense rays, and so\ndamaged no more of their comrades.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI switched in with my ultrophone on Boss Handan's channel, intending to\nreport my observation, but found that one of our swooper scouts, who,\nlike myself, was hanging above the Hans, was ahead of me. Moreover, he\nwas reporting a suddenly developed idea that resulted in the untimely\nend of the Hans' groundship threat.\n\n\"Those ships can't climb out of deep holes, Boss,\" he was saying\nexcitedly. \"Lay a big barrage against them--no, not on them--in front of\nthem--always in front of them. Pull it back as they come on. But churn\nh--l out of the ground in front of them! Get the rocketmen to make a\npenetrative time rocket. Shoot it into the ground in front of them, deep\nenough to be below their canopy ray, see, and detonate under them as\nthey go over it!\"\n\nI heard Handan's roar of exultation as I switched off again to order a\nbarrage from my Wyoming girls. Then I threw my rocket motor to full\nspeed and shot off a mile to one side, and higher, for I knew that soon\nthere would be a boiling eruption below.\n\nNo smoke interfered with my view of it, for our atomic explosive was\nsmokeless in its action. A line of blinding, flashing fire appeared in\nfront of the groundship wedge. The ships ploughed with calm\ndetermination toward it, but it withdrew before them, not steadily, but\njerkily intermittent, so that the ground became a series of gigantic\nhumps, ridges and shell holes. Into these the Han ships wallowed,\nplunging ponderously yet not daring to stop while their protective\ncanopy rays played, not daring to shut off these active rays.\n\nOne overturned. Our observers reported it. The result was a hail of\nrocket shells directly on the squadron. These could not penetrate the\ncanopies of the other ships, but the one which had turned turtle was\nblown to fragments.\n\nThe squadron attempted to change its course and dodge the barrier in\nfront of it. But a new barrier of blazing detonations and churned earth\nappeared on its flanks. In a matter of minutes it was ringed around,\nthanks to the skill of our fire control.\n\nOne by one the wallowing ships plunged into holes from which they could\nnot extricate themselves. One by one their canopy rays were shut off, or\nthe ships somersaulted off the knolls on which they perched, as their\ncanopies melted the ground away from around them. So one by one they\nwere destroyed.\n\nThus the second ground sortie of the Hans was annihilated.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nHan Electrono-Ray Science\n\n\nAt this period the Hans of Nu-Yok had only one airship equipped with\ntheir new armored repeller ray, their latest defense against our tactics\nof shooting rockets into the repeller rays and letting the latter hurl\nthem up against the ships. They had developed a new steel alloy of\ntremendous strength, which passed their _rep_ ray with ease, but was\nvirtually impervious to our most powerful explosives. Their supplies of\nthis alloy were limited, for it could be produced only in the Lo-Tan\nshops, for it was only there that they could develop the degree of\nelectronic power necessary for its manufacture.\n\nThis ship shot out toward our lines just as the last of the groundships\nturned turtle and was blown to pieces. As it approached, the rockets of\nour invisible and widely scattered gunners in the forest below began to\nexplode beneath its _rep_ ray plates. The explosions caused the great\nship to plunge and roll mightily, but otherwise did it no serious harm\nthat I could see, for it was very heavily armored.\n\nOccasionally rockets fired directly at the ship would find their mark\nand tear gashes in its side and bottom plates, but these hits were few.\nThe ship was high in the air, and a far more difficult target than were\nits _rep_ ray columns. To hit the latter, our gunners had only to gauge\ntheir aim vertically. Range could be practically ignored, since the\n_rep_ ray at any point above two-thirds the distance from the earth to\nthe ship would automatically hurl the rocket upward against the _rep_\nray plate.\n\nAs the ship sped toward us, rocking, plunging and recovering, it began\nto beam the forest below. It was equipped with a superbeam too, which\ncut a swathe nearly a hundred feet wide wherever it played.\n\nWith visions of many a life snuffed out below me, I surrendered to the\nimpulse to stage a single-handed attack on this ship, feeling quite\nsecure in my floating shell of inertron. I nosed up vertically, and\nrocketed for a position above the ship. Then as I climbed upward, as yet\nunobserved in my tiny craft that was scarcely larger than myself, I\ntrained my telultroscope on the Han ship, focussing through to a view of\nits interior.\n\nMuch as I had imbibed of this generation's hatred for the Hans, I was\nforced to admire them for the completeness and efficiency of this\nmarvelous craft of theirs.\n\nConstantly twirling the controls of my scope to hold the focus, I\nexamined its interior from nose to stern.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt may be of interest at this point to give the reader a layman's\nexplanation of the electronic or ionic machinery of these ships, and of\ntheir general construction, for today the general public knows little of\nthe particular application of the electronic laws which the Hans used,\nalthough the practical application of ultronics are well understood.\n\nBack in the Twentieth Century I had, like literally millions of others,\ndabbled a bit in \"radio\" as we called it then; the science of the Hans\nwas simply the superdevelopment of \"electricity,\" \"radio,\" and\n\"broadcasting.\"\n\nIt must be understood that this explanation of mine is not technically\naccurate, but only what might be termed an illustrative approximation.\n\nThe Hans' power-stations used to broadcast three distinct \"_powers_\"\nsimultaneously. Our engineers called them the \"_starter_,\" the\n\"_pullee_\" and the \"_sub-disintegrator_.\" The last named had nothing to\ndo with the operation of the ships, but was exclusively the powerizer of\nthe disintegrator generators.\n\nThe \"_starter_\" was not unlike the \"radio\" broadcasts of the Twentieth\nCentury. It went out at a frequency of about 1,000 kilocycles, had an\namperage of approximately zero, but a voltage of two billion. Properly\namplified by the use of _inductostatic_ batteries (a development of the\nprinciple underlying the earth induction compass applied to the control\nof static) this current energized the _\"A\" ionomagnetic_ coils on the\nairships, large and sturdy affairs, which operated the _Attractoreflex\nReceivers_, which in turn \"pulled in\" the second broadcast power known\nas the \"_pullee_,\" absorbing it from every direction, literally\nexhausting it from surrounding space. The \"_pullee_\" came in at about a\nhalf-billion volts, but in very heavy amperage, proportional to the\ncapacity of the receiver, and on a long wave--at audio frequency in\nfact. About half of this power reception ultimately actuated the\n_repeller ray_ generators. The other half was used to energize the _\"B\"\nionomagnetic_ coils, peculiarly wound affairs, whose magnetic fields\nconstituted the only means of insulating and controlling the circuits of\nthe three \"powers.\"\n\nThe repeller ray generators, operating on this current, and in\nconjunction with \"twin synchronizers\" in the power broadcast plant,\ndeveloped two rhythmically variable ether-ground circuits of opposite\npolarity. In the \"X\" circuit, the negative was grounded along an\nultraviolet beam from the ship's repeller-ray generator. The positive\nconnection was through the ether to the \"X synchronizer\" in the power\nplant, whose opposite pole was grounded. The \"Y\" circuit travelled the\nsame course, but in the opposite direction.\n\nThe rhythmic variables of these two opposing circuits, as nearly as I\ncan understand it, in heterodyning, created a powerful material \"push\"\nfrom the earth, up along the violet ray beam against the _rep_ ray\ngenerator and against the two synchronizers at the power plant.\n\nThis push developed molecularly from the earth-mass-resultant to the\ngenerator; and at the same fractional distance from the _rep_ ray\ngenerator to the power plant.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe force exerted upward against the ship was, of course, highly\nconcentrated, being confined to the path of the ultraviolet beam. Air or\nany material substance, coming within the indicated section of the beam,\nwas thrown violently upward. The ships actually rode on columns of air\nthus forcefully up-thrown. Their \"home berths\" and \"stations\" were\nconstructed with air pits beneath. When they rose from ordinary ground\nin open country, there was a vast upheaval of earth beneath their\ngenerators at the instant of take-off; this ceased as they got well\nabove ground level.\n\nEqual pressure to the lifting power of the generator was exerted against\nthe synchronizers at the power plant, but this force, not being\nconcentrated directionally along an ultraviolet beam, involved a\npractical problem only at points relatively close to the synchronizers.\n\nOf course the synchronizers were automatically controlled by the\noperation of the generators, and only the two were needed for any number\nof ships drawing power from the station, providing their protection was\nrugged enough to stand the strain.\n\nActually, they were isolated in vast spherical steel chambers with thick\nwalls, so that nothing but air pressure would be hurled against them,\nand this, of course, would be self-neutralizing, coming as it did from\nall directions.\n\nThe \"sub-disintegrator power\" reached the ships as an ordinary broadcast\nreception at a negligible amperage, but from one to 500 \"quints\"\n(quintillions) voltage, controllable only by the fields of the _\"B\"\nionomagnetic_ coils. It had a wave-length of about ten meters. In the\n_dis_ ray generator, this wave-length was broken up into an almost\nunbelievably high frequency, and became a directionally controlled wave\nof an infinitesimal fraction of an inch. This wave-length, actually\nidentical with the diameter of an electron, that is to say, being\naccurately \"tuned\" to an electron, disrupted the orbital paths and\nbalanced pulsations of the electrons within the atom, so desynchronizing\nthem as to destroy polarity balance of the atom and causing it to cease\nto exist as an atom. It was in this way that the ray reduced matter to\n\"nothingness.\"\n\nThis destruction of the atom, and a limited power for its reconstruction\nunder certain conditions, marked the utmost progress of the Han science.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nAmerican Ultronic Science\n\n\nOur own engineers, working in shielded laboratories far underground, had\nestablished such control over the \"de-atomized\" electrons as to dissect\nthem in their turn into _sub-electrons_. Moreover, they had carried\nthrough the study of this \"order\" to the point where they finally\n\"dissected\" the _sub-electron_ into its component _ultrons_, for the\nfundamental laws underlying these successive orders are not radically\ndissimilar. And as they progressed, they developed constructive as well\nas destructive practice. Hence the great triumphs of ultron and\ninertron, our two wonderful synthetic elements, built up from\nsuper-balanced and sub-balanced ultronic whorls, through the\n_sub-electronic_ order into the _atomic_ and _molecular_.\n\nHence also, come our relatively simple and beautifully efficient\nultrophones and ultroscopes, which in their phonic and visual operation\npenetrate obstacles of material, electronic and sub-electronic nature\nwithout let or hindrance, and with the consumption of but infinitesimal\npower.\n\nStatic disturbance, I should explain, is negligible in the\nsub-electronic order, and non-existent in the ultronic.\n\nThe pioneer expeditions of our engineers into the ultronic order, I am\ntold, necessitated the use of most elaborate, complicated and delicate\napparatus, as well as the expenditure of most costly power, but once\nestablished there, all necessary power is developed very simply from\ntiny batteries composed of thin plates of _metultron_ and _katultron_.\nThese two substances, developed synthetically in much the same manner as\nordinary ultron, exhibit dual phenomena which for sake of illustration I\nmay compare with certain of the phenomena of radioactivity. As radium is\nconstantly giving off electronic emanations and changing its atomic\nstructure thereby, so _katultron_ is constantly giving off _ultronic_\nemanations, and so changing its _sub-electronic_ form, while\n_metultron_, its complement, is constantly attracting and absorbing\n_ultronic_ values, and so changing its sub-electronic nature in the\nopposite direction. Thin plates of these two substances, when placed\nproperly in juxtaposition, with insulating plates of inertron between,\nconstitute a battery which generates an ultronic current.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd it is a curious parallel that just as there were many mysteries\nconnected with the nature of electricity in the Twentieth Century\n(mysteries which, I might mention, never _have_ been solved,\nnotwithstanding our penetration into the \"sub-\" orders) so there are\ncertain mysteries about the ultronic current. It will flow, for\ninstance, through an ultron wire, from the _katultron_ to the\n_metultron_ plate, as electricity will flow through a copper wire. It\nwill short circuit between the two plates if the inertron insulation is\nimperfect. When the insulation is perfect, however, and no ultron\nmetallic circuit is complete, the \"current\" (apparently the same that\nwould flow through the metallic circuit) is projected into space in an\nabsolutely straight line from the _katultron_ plate, and received from\nspace by the _metultron_ plate on the same line. This line is the\ntheoretical straight line passing through the mass-center of each plate.\nThe shapes and angles of the plates have nothing to do with it, except\nthat the perpendicular distance of the plate edges from the mass-center\nline determines thickness of the beam of parallel current-rays.\n\nThus a simple battery may be used either as a sender or receiver of\ncurrent. Two batteries adjusted to the same center line become connected\nin series just as if they were connected by ultron wires.\n\nIn actual practice, however, two types of batteries are used; both the\n_foco_ batteries and _broadcast_ batteries.\n\n_Foco_ batteries are twin batteries, arranged to shoot a positive and a\nnegative beam in the same direction. When these beams are made\nintermittent at light frequencies (though they are not light waves, nor\nof the same order as light waves) and are brought together, or focussed,\nat a given spot, the space in which they cross radiates alternating\nultronic current in every direction. This radiated _ultralight_ acts\nlike true light so long as the crossing beams vibrate at light\nfrequencies, except in three respects: first, it is not visible to the\neye; second, its \"color\" is exclusively dependent on the frequency of\nthe _foco_ beams, which determine the frequency of the alternating\nradiation. Material surfaces, it would appear, reflect them all in equal\nvalue, and the color of the resultant picture depends on the color of\nthe _foco_ frequencies. By altering these, a reddish, yellowish or\nbluish picture may be seen. In actual practice an orthochromatic mixture\nof frequencies is used to give a black, gray and white picture. The\nthird difference is this: rays pulsating in line toward any ultron\nobject connected with the rear plates of the twin batteries through\nrectifiers cannot be reflected by material objects, for it appears they\nare subject to a kind of \"pull\" which draws them straight through\nmaterial objects, which in a sense are \"magnetized\" and while in this\nstate offer no resistance.\n\nUltron, when so connected with battery terminals, glows with true light\nunder the impact of _ultralight_, and if in the form of a lens or set of\nlenses, may be made to deliver a picture in any telescopic degree\ndesired.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe essential parts of an ultroscope, then, are twin batteries with\nfocal control and frequency control; an ultron shield, battery connected\nand adjustable, to intercept the direct rays from the \"_glow-spot_,\"\nwith an ordinary light-shield between it and the lens; and the lens\nitself, battery connected and with more or less telescopic elaboration.\n\nTo look through a substance at an object, one has only to focus the\n_glow-spot_ beyond the substance but on the near side of the object and\nslightly above it.\n\nA complete apparatus may be \"set\" for \"penetrative,\" \"distance\" and\n\"normal vision.\"\n\nIn the first, which one would use to look through the forest screen from\nthe air, or in examining the interior of a Han ship or any opaque\nstructure, the _glow-spot_ is brought low, at only a tiny angle above\nthe vision line, and the shield, of course, must be very carefully\nadjusted.\n\n\"Distance\" setting would be used, for instance, in surveying a valley\nbeyond a hill or mountain; the _glow-spot_ is thrown high to illuminate\nthe entire scene.\n\nIn the \"normal\" setting the _foco_ rays are brought together close\noverhead, and illuminate the scene just as a lamp of super brilliancy\nwould in the same position.\n\nFor phonic communication a spherical sending battery is a ball of\nmetultron, surrounded by an insulating shell of inertron, and this in\nturn by a spherical shell of katultron, from which the current radiates\nin every direction, tuning being accomplished by frequency of\nintermissions, with audio-frequency modulation. The receiving battery\nhas a core pole of katultron and an outer shell of metultron. The\nreceiving battery, of course, picks up all frequencies, the undesired\nones being tuned out in detection.\n\nTuning, however, is only a convenience for privacy and elimination of\ninterference in ultrophonic communication. It is not involved as a\nnecessity, for untuned currents may be broadcast at voice-controlled\nfrequencies, directly and without any carrier wave.\n\nTo use plate batteries or single center-line batteries for phonic\ncommunication would require absolutely accurate directional aligning of\nsender and receiver, a very great practical difficulty, except when\nsender and receiver are relatively close and mutually visible.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis, however, is the regular system used in the Inter-Gang network for\nofficial communication. The senders and receivers used in this system\nare set only with the greatest difficulty, and by the aid of the finest\nlaboratory apparatus, but once set, they are permanently locked in\nposition at the stations, and barring earthquakes or insecure\nfoundations, need no subsequent adjustment. Accuracy of alignment\npermits beam paths no thicker than the old lead pencils I used to use in\nthe Twentieth Century.\n\nThe non-interference of such communication lines, and the difficulty of\ncutting in on them from any point except immediately adjacent to the\nsender or receiver, is strikingly apparent when it is realized that\nevery square inch of an imaginary plane bisecting the unlocated beam\nwould have to be explored with a receiving battery in order to locate\nthe beam itself.\n\nA practical compromise between the spherical or universal broadcast\nsenders and receivers on the one hand, and the single line batteries on\nthe other, is the _multi-facet battery_. Another, and more practical\ndevice particularly for distance work, is the _window-spherical_. It is\nmerely an ordinary spherical battery with a shielding shell with an\nopening of any desired size, from which a directionally controlled beam\nmay be emitted in different forms, usually that simply of an expanding\ncone, with an angle of expansion sufficient to cover the desired\nterritory at the desired point of reception.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nAn Unequal Duel\n\n\nBut to return to my narrative, and my _swooper_, from which I was gazing\nat the interior of the Han ship.\n\nThis ship was not unlike the great dirigibles of the Twentieth Century\nin shape, except that it had no suspended control car nor gondolas, no\npropellers, and no rudders, aside from a permanently fixed\ndouble-fishtail stabilizer at the rear, and a number of \"keels\" so\narranged as to make the most of the repeller ray airlift columns.\n\nIts width was probably twice as great as its depth, and its length about\ntwice its width. That is to say, it was about 100 feet from the main\nkeel to the top-deck at their maximum distance from each other, about\n200 feet wide amidship, and between 400 and 500 feet long. It had in\naddition to the top-deck, three interior decks. In its general curvature\nthe ship was a compromise between a true streamline design and a\nflattened cylinder.\n\nFor a distance of probably 75 to 100 feet back of the nose there were no\ndecks except that formed by the bottom of the hull. But from this point\nback the decks ran to within a few feet of the stern.\n\nAt various spots on the hull curvature in this great \"hollow nose\" were\nplatforms from which the crews of the _dis_ ray generators and the\n_electronoscope_ and _electronophone_ devices manipulated their\napparatus.\n\nInto this space from the forward end of the center deck, projected the\ncontrol room. The walls, ceiling and floor of this compartment were\nsimply the surfaces of _viewplates_. There were no windows or other\nopenings.\n\nThe operation officers within the control room, so far as their vision\nwas concerned, might have imagined themselves suspended in space, except\nfor the transmitters, levers and other signalling devices around them.\n\nFive officers, I understand, had their posts in the control room; the\ncaptain, and the chiefs of _scopes_, _phones_, _dis rays_ and\n_navigation_. Each of these was in continuous interphone communication\nwith his subordinates in other posts throughout the ship. Each\n_viewplate_ had its phone connecting with its \"_eye machines_\" on the\nhull, the crews of which would switch from telescopic to normal view at\ncommand.\n\nThere were, of course, many other _viewplates_ at executive posts\nthroughout the ship.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Hans followed a peculiar system in the command of their ships. Each\nship had a double complement of officers. Active Officers and Base\nOfficers. The former were in actual, active charge of the ship and its\napparatus. The latter remained at the ship base, at desks equipped with\n_viewplates_ and phones, in constant communication with their\n\"correspondents,\" on the ship. They acted continuously as consultants,\nobservers, recorders and advisors during the flight or action. Although\nnot primarily accountable for the operation of the ship, they were\nsenior to, and in a sense responsible for the training and efficiency of\nthe Active Officers.\n\nThe _ionomagnetic coils_, which served as the casings, \"plates\" and\ninsulators of the gigantic condensers, were all located amidship on a\ncenter line, reaching clear through from the top to the bottom of the\nhull, and reaching from the forward to the rear rep-ray generators; that\nis, from points about 110 feet from bow and stern. The crew's quarters\nwere arranged on both sides of the coils. To the outside of these, where\nthe several decks touched the hull, were located the various pieces of\n_phone_, _scope_ and _dis ray_ apparatus.\n\nThe ship into which I was gazing with my _ultroscope_ (at a telescopic\nand penetrative setting), carried a crew of perhaps 150 men all told.\nAnd except for the strained looks on their evil yellow faces I might\nhave been tempted to believe I was looking on some Twenty-fifth Century\npleasure excursion, for there was no running around nor appearance of\nactivity.\n\nThe Hans loved their ease, and despite the fact that this was a war\nship, every machine and apparatus in it was equipped with a complement\nof seats and specially designed couches, in which officers and men\nreclined as they gazed at their viewplates, and manipulated the little\nsets of controls placed convenient to their hands.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe picture was a comic one to me, and I laughed, wondering how such\nsoft creatures had held the sturdy and virile American race in complete\nsubjection for centuries. But my laugh died as my mind grasped at the\nobvious explanation. These Hans were only soft physically. Mentally they\nwere hard, efficient, ruthless, and conscienceless.\n\nImpulsively I nosed my _swooper_ down toward the ship and shot toward it\nat full rocket power. I had acted so swiftly that I had covered nearly\nhalf the distance toward the ship before my mind slowly drifted out of\nthe daze of my emotion. This proved my undoing. Their scopeman saw me\ntoo quickly, for in heading directly at them I became easily visible,\nappearing as a steady, expanding point. Looking through their hull, I\nsaw the crew of a _dis_ ray generator come suddenly to attention. A\nsecond later their beam engulfed me.\n\nFor an instant my heart stood still. But the inertron shell of my\nswooper was impervious to the disintegrator ray. I was out of luck,\nhowever, so far as my control over my tiny ship was concerned. I had\nbeen hurtling in a direct line toward the ship when the beam found me.\nNow, when I tried to swerve out of the beam, the swooper responded but\nsluggishly to the shift I made in the rocket angle. I was, of course,\ntraveling straight down a beam of vacuum. As my craft slowly nosed to\nthe edge of the beam, the air rushing into this vacuum from all sides\nthrew it back in again.\n\nHad I shot my ship across one of these beams at right angles, my\nmomentum would have carried me through with no difficulty. But I had no\nmomentum now except in the line of the beam, and this being a vacuum\nnow, my momentum, under full rocket power, was vastly increased. This\nrealization gave me a second and more acute thrill. Would I be able to\ncheck my little craft in time, or would I, helpless as a bullet itself,\ncrash through the shell of the Han ship to my own destruction?\n\nI shut off my rocketmotor, but noticed no practical diminution of speed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was the fear of the Hans themselves that saved me. Through my\nultroscope I saw sudden alarm on their faces, hesitation, a frantic\nofficer in the control room jabbering into his phone. Then shakily the\ncrew flipped their beam off to the side. The jar on my craft was\nterrific. Its nose caught the rushing tumble of air first, of course,\nand my tail sailing in a vacuum, swung around with a sickening wrench.\nMy swooper might as well have been a barrel in the tumult of waters at\nthe foot of Niagara. What was worse, the Hans kept me in that condition.\nThree of their beams were now playing in my direction, but not directly\non me except for split seconds. Their technique was to play their beams\naround me more than on me, jerking them this way and that, so as to form\nvacuum pockets into which the air slapped and roared as the beams\nshifted, tossing me around like a chip.\n\nDesperately I tried to bring my craft under control, to point its nose\ntoward the Han ship and discharge an explosive rocket. Bitterly I cursed\nmy self-confidence, and my impulsive action. An experienced pilot of the\npresent age would have known better than to be caught shooting straight\ndown a _dis_ ray beam. He would have kept his ship shooting constantly\nat some angle to it, so that his momentum would carry him across it if\nhe hit it. Too late I realized that there was more to the business of\nair fighting, than instinctive skill in guiding a swooper.\n\nAt last, when for a fraction of a second my nose pointed toward the\nHans, I pressed the button of my rocket gun. I registered a hit, but not\nan accurate one. My projectile grazed an upper section of the ship's\nhull. At that it did terrific damage. The explosion battered in a\nsection about fifty feet in diameter, partially destroying the top deck.\n\nAt the same instant I had shot my rocket, I had, in a desperate attempt\nto escape that turmoil of tumbling air, released a catch and dropped all\nthat it was possible to drop of my ultron ballast. My swooper shot\nupward, like a bubble streaking for the surface of water.\n\nI was free of the trap in which I had been caught, but unable to take\nadvantage of the confusion which reigned on the Han ship.\n\nI was as helpless to maneuver my ship now, in its up-rush, as when I had\nbeen tumbling in the air pockets. Moreover I was badly battered from\nplunging around in my shell like a pellet in a box, and partially\nunconscious.\n\nI was miles in the air when I recovered myself. The swooper was steady\nenough now, but still rising, my instruments told me, and traveling in a\ngeneral westward direction at full speed. Far below me was a sea of\nclouds, stretching from horizon to horizon, and through occasional\nbreaks in its surface I could see still other seas of clouds at lower\nlevels.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nCaptured!\n\n\nCertainly my situation was no less desperate. Unless I could find some\nmethod of compensating for my lost ballast, the inverse gravity of my\ninertron ship would hurl me continuously upward until I shot forth from\nthe last air layer into space. I thought of jumping, and floating down\non my inertron belt, but I was already too high for this. The air was\ntoo rarefied to permit breathing outside, though my little air\ncompressors were automatically maintaining the proper density within the\nshell. If I could compress a sufficiently large quantity of air inside\nthe craft, I would add to its weight. But there seemed little chance\nthat I would myself be able to withstand sufficient compression.\n\nI thought of releasing my inertron belt, but doubted whether this would\nbe enough. Besides I might need the belt badly if I did find some method\nof bringing the little ship down, and it came too fast.\n\nAt last a plan came into my half-numbed brain that had some promise of\nsuccess, though it was desperate enough. Cutting one of the hose pipes\non my air compressor, and grasping it between my lips, I set to work to\nsaw off the heads of the rivets that held the entire nose section of the\nswooper (inertron plates had to be grooved and riveted together, since\nthe substance was impervious to heat and could not be welded).\nDesperately I sawed, hammered and chiseled, until at last with a wrench\nand a snap, the plate broke away.\n\nThe released nose of the ship shot upward. The rest began to drop with\nme. How fast I dropped I do not know, for my instruments went with the\nnose. Half fainting, I grimly clenched the rubber hose between my teeth,\nwhile the little compressor \"carried on\" nobly, despite the wrecked\ncondition of the ship, giving me just enough air to keep my lungs from\ncollapsing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt last I shot through a cloud layer, and a long time afterward, it\nseemed, another. From the way in which they flashed up to meet me and to\nappear away above me, I must have been dropping like a stone.\n\nAt last I tried the rocket motor, very gently, to check my fall. The\nswooper was, of course, dropping tail first, and I had to be careful\nlest it turn over with a sharp blast from the motor, and dump me out.\n\nPassing through the third layer of clouds I saw the earth beneath me.\nThen I jumped, pulling myself up through the jagged opening, and leaping\nupward while the remains of my ship shot away below me.\n\nOn approaching the ground I opened my chute-cape, to further check my\nfall, and landed lightly, with no further mishap. Whereupon I promptly\nthrew myself down and slept, so exhausted was I with my experience.\n\nIt was not until the next morning that I awoke and gazed about me. I had\ncome down in mountainous country. My intention was to get my bearing by\ntuning in headquarters with my ultrophone. But to my dismay I found the\nlittle battery disks had been torn from the earflaps of my helmet,\nthough my chest-disk transmitter was still in place, and so far as I\ncould see, in working order. I could report my experience, but could\nreceive no reply.\n\nI spent a half hour repeating my story and explanation on the\nheadquarters channel, then once more surveyed my surroundings, trying to\ndetermine in which direction I had better leap. Then there came a stab\nof pain on the top of my head, and I dropped unconscious.\n\nI regained consciousness to find myself, much to my surprise, a prisoner\nin the hands of a foot detachment of some thirty Hans. My surprise was a\ndouble one; first that they had not killed me instantly; second, that a\ndetachment of them should be roaming this wild country afoot, obviously\nfar from any of their cities, and with no ship hanging in the sky above\nthem.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs I sat up, their officer grunted with satisfaction and growled a\nguttural command. I was seized and pulled roughly to my feet by four\nsoldiers, and hustled along with the party into a wooded ravine, through\nwhich we climbed sharply upward. I surmised, correctly as it turned out,\nthat some projectile had grazed my head, and I was in such shape that if\nit had not been for the fact that my inertron belt bore most of my\nweight, they would have had to carry me. But as it was I made out well,\nand at the end of an hour's climb was beginning to feel like myself\nagain, though the Han soldiers around me were puffing and drooping as\nmen will, no matter how healthy, when they are totally unaccustomed to\nphysical effort.\n\nAt length the party halted for a rest. I observed them curiously. Except\nfor a few brief exciting moments at the time of our air raid on the\nintelligence office in Nu-Yok, I had seen no living specimens of this\nyellow race at close quarters.\n\nThey looked little like the Mongolians of the Twentieth Century, except\nfor their slant eyes and round heads. The characteristic of the high\ncheek bones appeared to have been bred out of them, as were those of the\nrelatively short legs and the muddy yellow skin. To call them yellow was\nmore figurative than literal. Their skins were whiter than those of our\nown weather-tanned forest men. Nevertheless, their pigmentation was\npeculiar, and what there was of it looked more like a pale orange tint\nthan the ruddiness of the Caucasian. They were well formed, but rather\nundersized and soft-looking, small-muscled and smooth-skinned, like\nyoung girls. Their features were finely chiseled, eyes beady, and nose\nslightly aquiline.\n\nThey were uniformed, not in close-fitting green or other shades of\nprotective coloring, such as the unobtrusive gray of the Jersey Beaches\nor the leadened russet of the autumn uniforms of our people. Instead\nthey wore loose fitting jackets of some silky material, and loose knee\npants. This particular command had been equipped with form-moulded boots\nof some soft material that reached above the knee under their pants.\nThey wore circular hats with small crowns and wide rims. Their loose\njackets were belted at the waist, and they carried for weapons each man\na knife, a short double-edged sword and what I took to be a form of\nmagazine rocket gun. It was a rather bulky affair, short-barrelled, and\nwith a pistol grip. It was obviously intended to be fired either from\nthe waist position or from some sort of support, like the old machine\nguns. It looked, in fact, like a rather small edition of the Twentieth\nCentury arm.\n\nAnd have I mentioned the color of their uniforms? Their circular hats\nand pants were a bright yellow; their coats a flaming scarlet. What\ntargets they were!\n\nI must have chuckled audibly at the thought, for their commander who was\nseated on a folding stool one of his men had placed for him, glanced in\nmy direction, and, at his arrogant gesture of command, I was prodded to\nmy feet, and with my hands still bound, as they had been from the moment\nI recovered consciousness, I was dragged before him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen I knew what it was about these Hans that kept me in a turmoil of\nirritation. It was their sardonic, mocking, cruel smiles; smiles which\nleft their stamp on their faces, even in repose. Now the commander was\nsmiling tauntingly at me. When he spoke, it was in my own language.\n\n\"So!\" he sneered. \"You beasts have learned to laugh. You have gotten out\nof control in the last year or so. But that shall be remedied. In the\nmeantime, a simple little surgical operation would make your smile a\npermanent one, reaching from ear to ear. But there, my orders are to\ndeliver you and your equipment, all we have of it, intact. The\nHeaven-Born has had a whim.\"\n\n\"And who,\" I asked, \"is this Heaven-Born?\"\n\n\"San-Lan,\" he replied, \"misbegotten spawn of the late High Priestess\nNlui-Mok, and now Most Glorious Air Lord of All the Hans.\" He rolled out\nthese titles with a bow of exaggerated respect toward the west, and in a\ntone of mockery. Those of his men who were near enough to hear,\nsnickered and giggled.\n\nI was to learn that this amazing attitude of his was typical rather than\nexceptional. Strange as it may seem, no Han rendered any respect to\nanother, nor expected it in return; that is, not genuine respect. Their\ndiscipline was rigid and cold-bloodedly heartless. The most elaborate\ncourtesies were demanded and accorded among equals and from inferiors to\nsuperiors, but such was the intelligence and moral degradation of this\nremarkable race, that every one of them recognized these courtesies for\nwhat they were; they must of necessity have been hollow mockeries. They\ntook pleasure in forcing one another to go through with them, each\ntrying to outdo the other in cynical, sardonic thrusts, clothed in the\nmost meticulously ceremonious courtesy. As a matter of fact, my captor,\nby this crude reference to the origin of his ruler, was merely proving\nhimself a crude fellow, guilty of a vulgarity rather than of a\ntreasonable or disrespectful remark. An officer of higher rank and\nbetter breeding, would have managed a clever innuendo, less direct, but\nequally plain.\n\nI was about to ask him what part of the country we were in and where I\nwas to be taken, when one of his men came running to him with a little\nportable electronophone, which he placed before him, with much bowing\nand scraping.\n\nHe conversed through this for a while, and then condescended to give me\nthe information that a ship would soon be above us, and that I was to be\ntransferred to it. In telling me this, he managed to convey, with crude\nattempts at mock-courtesy, that he and his men would feel relieved to be\nrid of me as a menace to health and sanitation, and would take exquisite\njoy in inflicting me upon the crew of the ship.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nHypnotic Torture\n\n\nSome twenty minutes later the ship arrived. It settled down slowly into\nthe ravine on its repeller rays until it was but a few feet above the\ntree tops. There it was stopped, and floated steadily, while a little\ncage was let down on a wire. Into this I was hustled and locked,\nwhereupon the cage rose swiftly again to a hole in the bottom of the\nhull, into which it fitted snugly, and I stepped into the interior of a\ncraft not unlike the one with which I had had my fateful encounter, the\ncage being unlocked.\n\nThe cabin in which I was confined was not an outside compartment, but\nwas equipped with a number of viewplates.\n\nThe ship rose to a great height, and headed westward at such speed that\nthe hum of the air past its smooth plates rose to a shrill, almost\ninaudible moan. After a lapse of some hours we came in sight of an\nimpressive mountain range, which I correctly guessed to be the Rockies.\nSwerving slightly, we headed down toward one of the topmost pinnacles of\nthe range, and there unfolded in one of the viewplates in my cabin a\nglorious view of Lo-Tan, the Magnificent, a fairy city of glistening\nglass spires and iridescent colors, piled up on sheer walls of brilliant\nblue, on the very tip of this peak.\n\nNor was there any sheen of shimmering disintegrator rays surrounding it,\nto interfere with the sparkling sight. So far-flung were the defenses of\nLo-Tan, I found, that it was considered impossible for an American\nrocket gunner to get within effective range, and so numerous were the\n_dis_ ray batteries on the mountain peaks and in the ravines, in this\nencircling line of defenses, drawn on a radius of no less than 100\nmiles, that even the largest craft, in the opinion of the Hans, could\neasily be brought to earth through air-pocketing tactics. And this, I\nwas the more ready to believe after my own recent experience.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI spent two months as a prisoner in Lo-Tan. I can honestly say that\nduring that entire time every attention was paid to my physical comfort.\nLuxuries were showered upon me. But I was almost continuously subjected\nto some form of mental torture or moral assault. Most elaborately staged\nattempts at seduction were made upon me with drugs, with women.\nHypnotism was resorted to. Viewplates were faked to picture to me the\ncomplete rout of American forces all over the continent. With incredible\npatience, and laboring under great handicaps, in view of the vigor of\nthe American offensive, the Han intelligence department dug up the fact\nthat somewhere in the forces surrounding Nu-Yok, I had left behind me\nWilma, my bride of less than a year. In some manner, I will never tell\nhow, they discovered some likeness of her, and faked an electronoscopic\npicture of her in the hands of torturers in Nu-Yok, in which she was\nshown holding out her arms piteously toward me, as though begging me to\nsave her by surrender.\n\nSurrender of what? Strangely enough, they never indicated that to me\ndirectly, and to this day I do not know precisely what they expected or\nhoped to get out of me. I surmise that it was information regarding the\nAmerican sciences.\n\nThere was, however, something about the picture of Wilma in the hands of\nthe torturers that did not seem real to me, and my mind still resisted.\nI remember gazing with staring eyes at that picture, the sweat pouring\ndown my face, searching eagerly for some visible evidence of fraud and\nbeing unable to find it. It was the identical likeness of Wilma. Perhaps\nhad my love for her been less great, I would have succumbed. But all the\nwhile I knew subconsciously that this was not Wilma. Product of the\nutmost of nobility in this modern virile, rugged American race, she\nwould have died under even worse torture than these vicious Han\nscientists knew how to inflict, before she would have pleaded with me\nthis way to betray my race and her honor.\n\nBut these were things that not even the most skilled of the Han\nhypnotists and psychoanalysts could drag from me. Their intelligence\ndivision also failed to pick up the fact that I was myself the product\nof the Twentieth Century and not the Twenty-fifth. Had they done so, it\nmight have made a difference. I have no doubt that some of their most\nsubtle mental assaults missed fire because of my own Twentieth Century\n\"denseness.\" Their hypnotists inflicted many horrifying nightmares on\nme, and made me do and say many things that I would not have done in my\nright senses. But even in the Twentieth Century we had learned that\nhypnotism cannot make a person violate his fundamental concepts of\nmorality against his will, and steadfastly I steeled my will against\nthem.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI have since thought that I was greatly aided by my newness to this age.\nI have never, as a matter of fact, become entirely attuned to it. And\neven today I confess to a longing wish that man might travel backward as\nwell as forward in time. Now that my Wilma has been at rest these many\nyears, I wish that I might go back to the year 1927, and take up my old\nlife where I left it off, in the abandoned mine near Scranton.\n\nAnd at the period of which I speak, I was less attuned than now to the\nmodern world. Real as my life was, and my love for my wife, there was\nmuch about it all that was like a dream, and in the midst of my tortures\nby the Hans, this complex--this habit of many months--helped me to tell\nmyself that this, too, was all a dream, that I must not succumb, for I\nwould wake up in a moment.\n\nAnd so they failed.\n\nMore than that, I think I won something nearer to genuine respect from\nthose around me than any other Hans of that generation accorded to\nanybody.\n\nAmong these was San-Lan himself, the ruler. In the end it was he who\nordered the cessation of these tortures, and quite frankly admitted to\nme his conviction that they had been futile and that I was in many\nsenses a super-man. Instead of having me executed, he continued to\nshower luxuries and attentions on me, and frequently commanded my\nattendance upon him.\n\nAnother was his favorite concubine, Ngo-Lan, a creature of the most\nalluring beauty; young, graceful and most delicately seductive, whose\nskill in the arts and sciences put many of their doctors to shame. This\ncreature, his most prized possession, San-Lan with the utmost moral\ncallousness ordered to seduce me, urging her to apply without stint and\nto its fullest extent, her knowledge of evil arts. Had I not seen the\nnaked horror of her soul, that she let creep into her eyes for just one\nunguarded instant, and had it not been for my conviction of Wilma's\nfaith in me, I do not know what--but suffice it to say that I resisted\nthis assault also.\n\nHad San-Lan only known it, he might have had a better chance of breaking\ndown my resistance through another bit of femininity in his household,\nthe little nine-year-old Princess Lu-Yan, his daughter.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI think San-Lan held something of real affection for this sprightly\nlittle mite, who in spite of the sickening knowledge of rottenness she\nhad already acquired at this early age, was the nearest thing to\ninnocence I found in Lo-Tan. But he did not realize this, and could not;\nfor even the most natural and fundamental affection of the human race,\nthat of parents for their offspring, had been so degraded and suppressed\nin this vicious Han civilization as to be unrecognizable. Naturally\nSan-Lan could not understand the nature of my pity for this poor child,\nnor the fact that it might have proved a weak spot in my armor. But had\nhe done so, I truly believe he would have been ready to inflict\ndegradation, torture and even death upon her, to make me surrender the\ninformation he wanted.\n\nYet this man, perverted product of a morally degraded race, had about\nhim something of true dignity; something of sincerity, in a warped,\ntwisted way. There were times when he seemed to sense vaguely,\ngropingly, wonderingly, that he might have a soul.\n\nThe Han philosophy for centuries had not admitted the existence of\nsouls. Its conception embraced nothing but electrons, protons and\nmolecules, and still was struggling desperately for some shred of\nevidence that thoughts, will power and consciousness of self were\nnothing but chemical reactions. However, it had gotten no further than\nthe negative knowledge we had in the Twentieth Century, that a sick body\ndulls consciousness of the material world, and that knowledge, which all\nmankind has had from the beginning of time, that a dead body means a\ndeparted consciousness. They had succeeded in producing, by synthesis,\nwhat appeared to be living tissues, and even animals of moderately\ncomplex structure and rudimentary brains, but they could not give these\ncreatures the full complement of life's characteristics, nor raise the\nbrains to more than mechanical control of muscular tissues.\n\nIt was my own opinion that they never could succeed in doing so. This\nopinion impressed San-Lan greatly. I had expected him to snort his\ndisgust, as the extreme school of evolutionists would have done in the\nTwentieth Century. But the idea was as new to him and the scientists of\nhis court as Darwinism was to the late Nineteenth and early Twentieth\nCenturies. So it was received with much respect. Painfully and with\nenforced mental readjustments, they began a philosophical search for\nexcuses and justifications for the idea.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll of this amused me greatly, for of course neither the newness nor the\northodoxy of a hypothesis will make it true if it is not true, nor\nuntrue if it is true. Nor could the luck or will-power, with which I had\nresisted their hypnotists and psychoanalysts, make what might or might\nnot be a universal fact one whit more or less of a fact than it really\nwas. But the prestige I had gained among them, and the novelty of my\nexpressed opinion carried much weight with them.\n\nYet, did not even brilliant scientists frequently exhibit the same lack\nof logic back in the Twentieth Century? Did not the historians, the\nphilosophers of ancient Greece and Rome show themselves to be the same\nshrewd observers as those of succeeding centuries, the same masters of\nthe logical and slaves of the illogical?\n\nAfter all, I reflected, man makes little progress within himself.\nThrough succeeding generations he piles up those resources which he\npossesses outside of himself, the tools of his hands, and the\nwarehouses of knowledge for his brain, whether they be parchment\nmanuscripts, printed book, or electronorecordographs. For the rest he is\nborn today, as in ancient Greece, with a blank brain, and struggles\nthrough to his grave, with a more or less beclouded understanding, and\nwith distinct limitations to what we used to call his \"think tank.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis particular reflection of mine proved unpopular with them, for it\nstabbed their vanity, and neither my prestige nor the novelty of the\nidea was sufficient salve. These Hans for centuries had believed and\ntaught their children that they were a super-race, a race of destiny.\nDestined to Whom, for What, was not so clear to them; but nevertheless\ndestined to \"elevate\" humanity to some sort of super-plane. Yet through\nthese same centuries they had been busily engaged in the extermination\nof \"weaklings,\" whom, by their very persecutions, they had turned into\n\"super men,\" now rising in mighty wrath to destroy them; and in reducing\nthemselves to the depths of softening vice and flabby moral fiber. Is it\nstrange that they looked at me in amazed wonder when I laughed outright\nin the midst of some of their most serious speculations?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nThe Fall of Nu-Yok\n\n\nMy position among the Hans, in this period, was a peculiar one. I was at\nonce a closely guarded prisoner and an honored guest. San-Lan told me\nfrankly that I would remain the latter only so long as I remained an\nobject of serious study or mental diversion to himself or his court. I\nmade bold to ask him what would be done with me when I ceased to be\nsuch.\n\n\"Naturally,\" he said, \"you will be eliminated. What else? It takes the\nservices of fifteen men altogether, to guard you; and men, you\nunderstand, cannot be produced and developed in less than eighteen\nyears.\" He meditated frowningly for a moment. \"That, by the way, is\nsomething I must take up with the Birth and Educational Bureau. They\nmust develop some method of speeding growth, even at the cost of mental\ndevelopment. With your wild forest men getting out of hand this way, we\nare going to need greater resources of population, and need them badly.\n\n\"But,\" he continued more lightly, \"there seems to be no need for you to\ndisturb yourself over the prospect at present. It is true you have been\nable to resist our psychoanalysts and hypnotists, and so have no value\nto us from the viewpoint of military information, but as a philosopher,\nyou have proved interesting indeed.\"\n\nHe broke off to give his attention to a gorgeously uniformed official\nwho suddenly appeared on the large viewplate that formed one wall of the\napartment. So perfectly did this mechanism operate, that the man might\nhave been in the room with us. He made a low obeisance, then rose to his\nfull height and looked at his ruler with malicious amusement.\n\n\"Heaven-Born,\" he said, \"I have the exquisite pain of reporting bad\nnews.\"\n\nSan-Lan gave him a scathing look. \"It will be less unpleasant if I am\nnot distracted by the sight of you while you report.\"\n\nAt this the man disappeared, and the viewplate once more presented its\nnormal picture of the mountains north of Lo-Tan; but the voice\ncontinued:\n\n\"Heaven-Born, the Nu-Yok fleet has been destroyed, the city is in ruins,\nand the newly formed ground brigades, reduced to 10,000 men, have taken\nrefuge in the hills of Ron-Dak (the Adirondacks) where they are being\npressed hard by the tribesmen, who have surrounded them.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor an instant San-Lan sat as though paralyzed. Then he leaped to his\nfeet, facing the viewplate.\n\n\"Let me see you!\" he snarled. Instantly the mountain view disappeared\nand the Intelligence Officer appeared again, this time looking a little\nfrightened.\n\n\"Where is Lui-Lok?\" he shouted. \"Cut him in on my north plate. The\ncommander who loses his city dies by torture. Cut him in. Cut him in!\"\n\n\"Heaven-Born, Lui-Lok committed suicide. He leaped into a ray, when the\nrockets of the tribesmen began to penetrate the ray-wall. Lip-Hung is in\ncommand of the survivors. We have just had a message from him. We could\nnot understand all of it. Reception was very weak because he is\noperating with emergency apparatus on Bah-Flo power. The Nu-Yok power\nbroadcast plant has been blown up. Lip-Hung begs for a rescue fleet.\"\n\nSan-Lan, his expression momentarily becoming more vicious, now was\nstriding up and down the room, while the poor wretch in the viewplate,\nthoroughly scared at last, stood trembling.\n\n\"What!\" shrieked the tyrant. \"He begs a rescue. A rescue of what? Of\n10,000 beaten men and nothing better than makeshift apparatus? No fleet?\nNo city? I give him and his 10,000 to the tribesmen! They are of no use\nto us now! Get out! Vanish! No, wait! Have any of the beasts' rockets\npenetrated the ray-walls of other cities?\"\n\n\"No, Heaven-Born, no. It is only at Nu-Yok that the tribesmen used\nrockets sheathed in the same mysterious substance they use on their\nlittle aircraft and which cannot be disintegrated by the ray.\" (He meant\ninertron, of course.)\n\nSan-Lan waved his hand in dismissal. The officer dissolved from view,\nand the mountains once more appeared, as though the whole side of the\nroom were of glass.\n\nMore slowly he paced back and forth. He was the caged tiger now, his\nface seamed with hate and the desperation of foreshadowed doom.\n\n\"Driven out into the hills,\" he muttered to himself. \"Not more than\n10,000 of them left. Hunted like beasts--and by the very beasts we\nourselves have hunted for centuries. Cursed be our ancestors for letting\na single one of the spawn live!\" He shook his clenched hands above his\nhead. Then, suddenly remembering me, he turned and glared.\n\n\"Forest man, what have you to say?\" he demanded.\n\nThus confronted, there stole over me that same detached feeling that\npossessed me the day I had been made Boss of the Wyomings.\n\n\"It is the end of the Air Lords of Han,\" I said quietly. \"For five\ncenturies command of the air has meant victory. But this is so no\nlonger. For more than three centuries your great, gleaming cities have\nbeen impregnable in all their arrogant visibility. But that day is done\nalso. Victory returns once more to the ground, to men invisible in the\nvast expanse of the forest which covers the ruins of the civilization\ndestroyed by your ancestors. Ye have sown destruction. Ye shall reap it!\n\n\"Your ancestors thought they had made mere beasts of the American race.\nPhysically you did reduce them to the state of beasts. But men do have\nsouls, San-Lan, and in their souls the Americans still cherished the\nspark of manhood, of honor, of independence. While the Hans have\ndegenerated into a race of sleek, pampered beasts themselves, they have\nunwittingly bred a race of super-men out of those they sought to make\nanimals. You have bred your own destruction. Your cities shall be\nblasted from their foundations. Your air fleets shall be brought\ncrashing to earth. You have your choice of dying in the wreckage, or of\nfleeing to the forests, there to be hunted down and killed as you have\nsought to destroy us!\"\n\nAnd the ruler of all the Hans shrank back from my outstretched finger as\nthough it had been in truth the finger of doom.\n\nBut only for a moment. Suddenly he snarled and crouched as though to\nspring at me with his bare hands. By a mighty convulsion of the will he\nregained control of himself, however, and assumed a manner of quiet\ndignity. He even smiled--a slow, crooked smile.\n\n\"No,\" he said, answering his own thought. \"I will not have you killed\nnow. You shall live on, my honored guest, to see with your own eyes how\nwe shall exterminate your animal-brethren in their forests. With your\nown ears you shall hear their dying shrieks. The cold science of Han is\nsuperior to your spurious knowledge. We have been careless. To our cost\nwe have let you develop brains of a sort. But we are still superior. We\nshall go down into the forests and meet you. We shall beat you in your\nown element. When you have seen and heard this happen, my Council shall\ndevise for you a death by scientific torture, such as no man in the\nhistory of the world has been honored with.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI must digress here a bit from my own personal adventures to explain\nbriefly how the fall of Nu-Yok came about, as I learned it afterward.\n\nUpon my capture by the Hans, my wife, Wilma, courageously had assumed\ncommand of my Gang, the Wyomings.\n\nBoss Handan, of the Winslows, who was directing the American forces\ninvesting Nu-Yok, contented himself for several weeks with maintaining\nour lines, while waiting for the completion of the first supply of\ninertron-jacketed rockets. At last they arrived with a limited quantity\nof very high-powered atomic shells, a trifle over a hundred of them to\nbe exact. But this number, it was estimated, would be enough to reduce\nthe city to ruins. The rockets were distributed, and the day for the\nfinal bombardment was set.\n\nThe Hans, however, upset Handan's plans by launching a ground expedition\nup the west bank of the Hudson. Under cover of an air raid to the\nsouthwest, in which the bulk of their ships took part, this ground\nexpedition shot northward in low-flying ships.\n\nThe raiding air fleet ploughed deep into our lines in their famous\n\"cloud-bank\" formation, with down-playing disintegrator rays so\nconcentrated as to form a virtual curtain of destruction. It seared a\nscar path a mile and a half wide fifteen miles into our territory.\n\nEveryone of our rocket gunners caught in this section was annihilated.\nAltogether we lost several hundred men and girls.\n\nGunners to each side of the raiding ships kept up a continuous fire on\nthem. Most of the rockets were disintegrated, for Handan would not\npermit the use of the inertron rockets against the ships. But now and\nthen one found its way through the playing beams, hit a repeller ray and\nwas hurled up against a Han ship, bringing it crashing down.\n\nThe orders that Handan barked into his ultrophone were, of course, heard\nby every long-gunner in the ring of American forces around the city, and\nnearly all of them turned their fire on the Han airfleet, with the\nexception of those equipped with the inertron rockets.\n\nThese latter held to the original target and promptly cut loose on the\ncity with a shower of destruction which the disintegrator-ray walls\ncould not stop. The results produced awe even in our own ranks.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhere an instant before had stood the high-flung masses and towers of\nNu-Yok, gleaming red, blue and gold in the brilliant sunlight, and\nshimmering through the iridescence of the ray \"wall,\" there was a\nseething turmoil of gigantic explosions.\n\nSurging billows of debris were hurled skyward on gigantic pulsations of\nblinding light, to the detonations that shook men from their feet in\nmany sections of the American line seven and eight miles away.\n\nAs I have said, there were only some hundred of the inertron rockets\namong the Americans, long and slender, to fit the ordinary guns, but the\natomic laboratories hidden beneath the forests, had outdone themselves\nin their construction. Their release of atomic force was nearly 100 per\ncent, and each one of them was equal to many hundred tons of\ntrinitrotoluol, which I had known in the First World War, five hundred\nyears before, as \"T.N.T.\"\n\nIt was all over in a few seconds. Nu-Yok had ceased to exist, and the\nwaters of the bay and the rivers were pouring into the vast hole where a\nmoment before had been the rocky strata beneath lower Manhattan.\n\nNaturally, with the destruction of the city's power-broadcasting plant\nthe Han air fleet had plunged to earth.\n\nBut the ships of the ground expedition up the river, hugging the tree\ntops closely, had run the gauntlet of the American long-gunners who were\nbusily shooting at the other Han fleet, high in the air to the\nsouthwest, and about half of them had landed before their ships were\nrobbed of their power. The other half crashed, taking some 10,000 or\n12,000 Han troops to destruction with them. But from those which had\nlanded safely, emerged the 10,000 who now were the sole survivors of\nthe city, and who took refuge in wooded fastnesses of the Adirondacks.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Americans with their immensely greater mobility, due to their\njumping belts and their familiarity with the forest, had them ringed in\nwithin twenty-four hours.\n\nBut owing to the speed of the maneuvers, the lines were not as tightly\ndrawn as they might have been, and there was considerable scattering of\nboth American and Han units. The Hans could make only the weakest\nshort-range use of their newly developed disintegrator-ray field units,\nsince they had only distant sources of power-broadcast on which to draw.\nOn the other hand, the Americans could use their explosive rockets only\nsparingly for fear of hitting one another.\n\nSo the battle was finished in a series of desperate hand-to-hand\nencounters in the ravines and mountain slopes of the district.\n\nThe Mifflins and Altoonas, themselves from rocky, mountainous sections,\ngave a splendid account of themselves in this fighting, leaping to the\ncraggy slopes above the Hans, and driving them down into the ravines,\nwhere they could safely concentrate on them the fire of depressed rocket\nguns.\n\nThe Susquannas, with their great inertron shields, which served them\nwell against the weak rays of the Hans, pressed forward irresistibly\nevery time they made a contact with a Han unit, their short-range rocket\nguns sending a hail of explosive destruction before them.\n\nBut the Delawares, with their smaller shields, inertron leg-guards and\nhelmets, and their ax-guns, made faster work of it. They would rush the\nHans, shooting from their shields as they closed in, and finish the\nbusiness with their ax-blades and the small rocket guns that formed the\nhandles of their axes.\n\nIt was my own unit of Wyomings, equipped with bayonet guns not unlike\nthe rifles of the First World War, that took the most terrible toll from\nthe Hans.\n\nThey advanced at the double, laying a continuous barrage before them as\nthey ran, closing with the enemy in great leaps, cutting, thrusting and\nslicing with those terrible double-ended weapons in a vicious efficiency\nagainst which the Hans with their swords, knives and spears were utterly\nhelpless.\n\nAnd so my prediction that the war would develop hand-to-hand fighting\nwas verified at the outset.\n\nNone of the details of this battle of the Ron-Daks were ever known in\nLo-Tan. Not more than the barest outlines of the destruction of the\nsurvivors of Nu-Yok were ever received by San-Lan and his Council. And\nof course, at that time I knew no more about it than they did.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nLife in Lo-Tan, the Magnificent\n\n\nSan-Lan's attitude toward me underwent a change. He did not seek my\ncompany as he had done before, and so those long discussions and mental\nduels in which we pitted our philosophies against each other came to an\nend. I was, I suspected, an unpleasant reminder to him of things he\nwould rather forget, and my presence was an omen of impending doom. That\nhe did not order my execution forthwith was due, I believe to a sort of\nfascination in me, as the personification of this (to him) strange and\nmysterious race of super-men who had so magically developed overnight\nfrom \"beasts\" of the forest.\n\nBut though I saw little of him after this, I remained a member of his\nhousehold, if one may speak of a \"household\" where there is no semblance\nof house.\n\nThe imperial apartments were located at the very summit of the Imperial\nTower, the topmost pinnacle of the city, itself clinging to the sides\nand peak of the highest mountain in that section of the Rockies. There\nwere days when the city seemed to be built on a rugged island in the\nmidst of a sea of fleecy whiteness, for frequently the cloud level was\nbelow the peak. And on such days the only visual communications with the\nworld below was through the viewplates which formed nearly all the\ninterior walls of the thousands of apartments (for the city was, in\nfact, one vast building) and upon which the tenants could tune in almost\nany views they wished from an elaborate system of public television and\nprojectoscope broadcasts.\n\nEvery Han city had many public-view broadcasting stations, operating on\ntuning ranges which did not interfere with other communication systems.\nFor slight additional fees a citizen in Lo-Tan might, if he felt so\ninclined, \"visit\" the seashore, or the lakes or the forests of any part\nof the country, for when such scene was thrown on the walls of an\napartment, the effect was precisely the same as if one were gazing\nthrough a vast window at the scene itself.\n\nIt was possible too, for a slightly higher fee, to make a mutual\nconnection between apartments in the same or different cities, so that a\nfamily in Lo-Tan, for instance, might \"visit\" friends in Fis-Ko (San\nFrancisco) taking their apartment, so to speak, along with them; being\nto all intents and purposes separated from their \"hosts\" only by a big\nglass wall which interfered neither with vision nor conversation.\n\nThese public view and visitation projectoscopes explain that utter depth\nof laziness into which the Hans had been dragged by their civilization.\nThere was no incentive for anyone to leave his apartment unless he was\nin the military or air service, or a member of one of the repair\nservices which from time to time had to scoot through the corridors and\nshafts of the city, somewhat like the ancient fire departments, to make\nsome emergency repair to the machinery of the city or its electrical\ndevices.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhy should he leave his house? Food, wonderful synthetic concoctions of\nany desired flavor and consistency (and for additional fee conforming to\nthe individual's dietary prescription) came to him through a shaft, from\nwhich his tray slid automatically on to a convenient shelf or table.\n\nAt will he could tune in a theatrical performance of talking pictures.\nHe could visit and talk with his friends. He breathed the freshest of\nfiltered air right in his own apartment, at any temperature he desired,\nfragrant with the scent of flowers, the aromatic smell of the pine\nforests or the salt tang of the sea, as he might prefer. He could\n\"visit\" his friends at will, and though his apartment actually might be\nburied many thousand feet from the outside wall of the city, it was none\nthe less an \"outside\" one, by virtue of its viewplate walls. There was\neven a tube system, with trunk, branch and local lines and an\nautomagnetic switching system, by which articles within certain size\nlimits could be despatched from any apartment to any other one in the\ncity.\n\nThe women actually moved about through the city more than the men, for\nthey had no fixed duties. No work was required of them, and though\nnominally free, their dependence upon the government pension for their\nnecessities and on their \"husbands\" (of the moment) for their luxuries,\nreduced them virtually to the condition of slaves.\n\nEach had her own apartment in the Lower City, with but a single small\nviewplate, very limited \"visitation\" facilities, and a minimum credit\nfor food and clothing. This apartment was assigned to her on graduation\nfrom the State School, in which she had been placed as an infant, and it\nremained hers so long as she lived, regardless of whether she occupied\nit or not. At the conclusion of her various \"marriages\" she would return\nthere, pending her endeavors to make a new match. Naturally, as her\nyears increased, her returns became more frequent and her stay of longer\nduration, until finally, abandoning hope of making another match, she\nfinished out her days there, usually in drunkenness and whatever other\nforms of cheap dissipation she could afford on her dole, starving\nherself.\n\nMen also received the same State pension, sufficient for the necessities\nbut not for the luxuries of life. They got it only as an old-age\npension, and on application.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen boys graduated from the State School they generally were \"adopted\"\nby their fathers and taken into the latter's households, where they\nenjoyed luxuries far in excess of their own earning power. It was not\nthat their fathers wasted any affection on them, for as I have explained\nbefore, the Hans were so morally atrophied and scientifically developed\nthat love and affection, as we Americans knew them, were unexperienced\nor suppressed emotions with them. They were replaced by lust and pride\nof possession. So long as it pleased a father's vanity, and he did not\nmiss the cost, he would keep a son with him, but no longer.\n\nYoung men, of course, started to work at the minimum wage, which was\nsomewhat higher than the pension. There was work for everybody in\npositions of minor responsibility, but very little hard work.\n\nUpon receiving his appointment from one or another of the big\ncorporations which handled the production and distribution of the vast\ncommunity (the shares of which were pooled and held by the\ngovernment--that is, by San-Lan himself--in trust for all the workers,\naccording to their positions) he would be assigned to an\napartment-office, or an apartment adjoining the group of offices in\nwhich he was to have his desk. Most of the work was done in single\napartment-offices.\n\nThe young man, for instance, might recline at his ease in his apartment\nnear the top of the city, and for three or four hours a day inspect,\nthrough his viewplate and certain specially installed apparatus, the\noutput of a certain process in one of the vast automatically controlled\nfood factories buried far underground beneath the base of the mountain,\nwhere the moan of its whirring and throbbing machinery would not disturb\nthe peace and quiet of the citizens on the mountain top. Or he might be\nrequired simply to watch the operation of an account machine in an\nautomatic store.\n\nThere is no denying that the economic system of the Hans was marvelous.\nA suit of clothes, for instance, might be delivered in a man's apartment\nwithout a human hand having ever touched it.\n\nHaving decided that he wished a suit of a given general style, he would\nsimply tune in a visual broadcast of the display of various selections,\nand when he had made his choice, dial the number of the item and press\nthe order button. Simultaneously the charge would be automatically made\nagainst his account number, and credited as a sale on the automatic\nrecords of that particular factory in the account house. And his account\nplate, hidden behind a little wall door, would register his new credit\nbalance. An automatically packaged suit that had been made to style and\nsize-standard by automatic machinery from synthetically produced\nmaterial, would slip into the delivery chute, magnetically addressed,\nand in anywhere from a few seconds to thirty minutes or so, according to\nthe volume of business in the chutes, and drop into the delivery basket\nin his room.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDaily his wages were credited to his account, and monthly his share of\nthe dividends likewise (according to his position) from the Imperial\nInvestment Trust, after deduction of taxes (through the automatic\nbookkeeping machines) for the support of the city's pensioners and\nwhatever sum San-Lan himself had chosen to deduct for personal expenses\nand gratuities.\n\nA man could not bequeath his ownership interest in industry to his son,\nfor that interest ceased with his death, but his credit accumulation, on\nwhich interest was paid, was credited to his eldest recorded son as a\nmatter of law.\n\nSince many of these credit fortunes (The Hans had abandoned gold as a\nfinancial basis centuries before) were so big that they drew interest in\nexcess of the utmost luxury costs of a single individual, there was a\nclass of idle rich consisting of eldest sons, passing on these credit\nfortunes from generation to generation. But younger sons and women had\nno share in these fortunes, except by the whims and favor of the\n\"Man-Dins\" (Mandarins), as these inheritors were known.\n\nThese Man-Dins formed a distinct class of the population, and numbered\nabout five percent of it. It was distinct from the Ku-Li (coolie) or\ncommon people, and from the \"Ki-Ling\" or aristocracy composed of those\nmore energetic men (at least mentally more energetic) who were the\nactive or retired executive heads of the various industrial,\neducational, military or political administrations.\n\nA man might, if he so chose, transfer part of his credit to a woman\nfavorite, which then remained hers for life or until she used it up, and\nof course, the prime object of most women, whether as wives, or\nfavorites, was to beguile a settlement of this sort out of some wealthy\nman.\n\nWhen successful in this, and upon reassuming her freedom, a woman ranked\nsocially and economically with the Man-Dins. But on her death, whatever\nremained of her credit was transferred to the Imperial fund.\n\nWhen one considers that the Hans, from the days of their exodus from\nMongolia and their conquest of America, had never held any ideal of\nmonogamy, and the fact that marriage was but a temporary formality which\ncould be terminated on official notice by either party, and that after\nall it gave a woman no real rights or prerogatives that could not be\nterminated at the whim of her husband, and established her as nothing\nbut the favorite of his harem, if he had an income large enough to keep\none, or the most definitely acknowledged of his favorites if he hadn't,\nit is easy to see that no such thing as a real family life existed among\nthem.\n\nFree women roamed the corridors of the city, pathetically importuning\nmarriage, and wives spent most of the time they were not under their\nhusbands' watchful eyes in flirtatious attempts to provide themselves\nwith better prospects for their next marriages.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNaturally the biggest problem of the community was that of stimulating\nthe birth rate. The system of special credits to mothers had begun\ncenturies before, but had not been very efficacious until women had been\ndeprived of all other earning power, and even at the time of which I\nwrite it was only partially successful, in spite of the heavy bounties\nfor children. It was difficult to make the bounties sufficiently\nattractive to lure the women from their more remunerative light\nflirtations. Eugenic standards also were a handicap.\n\nAs a matter of fact, San-Lan had under consideration a revolutionary\nchange in economic and moral standards, when the revolt of the forest\nmen upset his delicately laid plans, for, as he had explained to me, it\nwas no easy thing to upset the customs of centuries in what he was\npleased to call the \"morals\" of his race.\n\nHe had another reason too. The physically active men of the community\nwere beginning to acquire a rather dangerous domination. These included\nmen in the army, in the airships, and in those relatively few civilian\nactivities in which machines could not do the routine work and\nthinking. Already common soldiers and air crews demanded and received\nhigher remuneration than all except the highest of the Ki-Ling, the\nindustrial and scientific leaders, while mechanics and repairmen who\ncould, and would, work hard physically, commanded higher incomes than\nPrinces of the Blood, and though constituting only a fraction of one per\ncent of the population they actually dominated the city. San-Lan dared\ntake no important step in the development of the industrial and military\nsystem without consulting their council or Yun-Yun (Union), as it was\nknown.\n\nSocially the Han cities were in a chaotic condition at this time,\nbetween morals that were not morals, families that were not families,\nmarriages that were not marriages, children who knew no homes, work that\nwas not work, eugenics that didn't work; Ku-Lis who envied the richer\nclasses but were too lazy to reach out for the rewards freely offered\nfor individual initiative; the intellectually active and physically lazy\nKi-Lings who despised their lethargy; the Man-Din drones who regarded\nboth classes with supercilious toleration; the Princes of the Blood,\narrogant in their assumption of a heritage from a Heaven in which they\ndid not believe; and finally the three castes of the army, air and\nindustrial repair services, equally arrogant and with more reason in\ntheir consciousness of physical power.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe army exercised a cruelly careless and impartial police power over\nall classes, including the airmen, when the latter were in port. But it\ndid not dare to touch the repair men, who, so far as I could ever make\nout, roamed the corridors of the city at will during their hours off\nduty, wreaking their wills on whomever they met, without let or\nhindrance.\n\nEven a Prince of the Blood would withdraw into a side corridor with his\nescort of a score of men, to let one of these labor \"kings\" pass, rather\nthan risk an altercation which might result in trouble for the\ngovernment with the Yun-Yun, regardless of the rights and wrongs of the\ncase, unless a heavy credit transference was made from the balance of\nthe Prince to that of the worker. For the machinery of the city could\nnot continue in operation a fortnight, before some accident requiring\ndelicate repair work would put it partially out of commission. And the\nYun-Yun was quick to resent anything it could construe as a slight on\none of its members.\n\nIn the last analysis it was these Yun-Yun men, numerically the smallest\nof the classes, who ruled the Han civilization, because for all\npractical purposes they controlled the machinery on which that\ncivilization depended for its existence.\n\nPolitically, San-Lan could balance the organizations of the army and the\nair fleets against each other, but he could not break the grip of the\nrepairmen on the machinery of the cities and the power broadcast plants.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nThe Forest Men Attack\n\n\nMany times during the months I remained prisoner among the Hans I had\ntried to develop a plan of escape, but could conceive of nothing which\nseemed to have any reasonable chance of success.\n\nWhile I was allowed almost complete freedom within the confines of the\ncity, and sometimes was permitted to visit even the military outposts\nand disintegrator ray batteries in the surrounding mountains, I was\nnever without a guard of at least five men under the command of an\nofficer. These men were picked soldiers, and they were armed with\npowerful though short-range disintegrator-ray pistols, capable of\nannihilating anything within a hundred feet. Their vigilance never\nrelaxed. The officer on duty kept constantly at my side, or a couple of\npaces behind me, while certain of the others were under strict orders\nnever to approach within my reach, nor to get more than forty feet away\nfrom me. The thought occurred to me once to seize the officer at my side\nand use him as a shield, until I found that the guard were under orders\nto destroy both of us in such a case.\n\nSo in this fashion I roamed the city corridors, wherever I wished. I\nvisited the great factories at the bottom of the shafts that led to the\nbase of the mountain, where, unattended by any mechanics, great turbines\nwhirred and moaned, giant pistons plunged back and forth, and immense\nsystems of chemical vats, piping and converters, automatically performed\ntheir functions with the assistance of no human hand, but under the\nminute television inspection of many perfumed dandies reclining at their\nease before viewplates in their apartment offices in the city, that\nclung to the mountain peak far above.\n\nThere were just two restrictions on my freedom of movement. I was\nallowed nowhere near the power-broadcasting station on the peak, nor the\ncomplement of it which was buried three miles below the base of the\nmountain. And I was never allowed to approach within a hundred feet of\nany disintegrator ray machine when I visited the military outposts in\nthe surrounding mountains.\n\nI first noticed the \"escape tunnels\" one day when I had descended to the\nlowest level of all, the location of the Electronic Plant, where\nmachines, known as \"reverse disintegrators,\" fed with earth and crushed\nrock by automatic conveyors, subjected this material to the\ndisintegrator ray, held the released electrons captive within their\nmagnetic fields and slowly refashioned them into supplies of metals and\nother desired elements.\n\nMy attention was attracted to the tunnels by the unusual fact that men\nwere busily entering and leaving them. Almost the entire repair force\nseemed to be concentrated here. Stocky, muscular men they were, with the\nsame modified Oriental countenances as the rest of the Hans, but with a\ncertain ruggedness about them that was lacking in the rest of the\nindolent population. They sweated as they labored over the construction\nof magnetic cars evidently designed to travel down these tunnels,\nautomatically laying pipe lines for ventilation and temperature control.\nThe tunnels themselves appeared to have been driven with disintegrator\nrays, which could bore rapidly through the solid rock, forming glassy\niridescent walls as they bored, and involving no problem of debris\nremoval.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI asked San-Lan about it the next time I saw him, for the officer of my\nguard would give me no information.\n\nThe supreme ruler of the Hans smiled mockingly.\n\n\"There is no reason why you should not know their purpose,\" he said,\n\"for you will never be able to stop our use of them. These tunnels\nconstitute the road to a new Han era. Your forest men have turned our\ncities into traps, but they have not trapped our minds and our powers\nover Nature. We are masters still; masters of the world, and of the\nforest men.\n\n\"You have revolutionized the tactics of warfare with your explosive\nrockets and your strategy of fighting from concealed positions, miles\naway, where we cannot find you with our beams. You have driven our ships\nfrom the air, and you may destroy our cities. But we shall be gone.\n\n\"Down these tunnels we shall depart to our new cities, deep under\nground, and scattered far and wide through the mountains. They are\nnearly completed now.\n\n\"You will never blast us out of these, even with your most powerful\nexplosives, because they will be more difficult for you to find than it\nis for us to locate a forest gunner somewhere beneath his leafy screen\nof miles of trees, and because they will be too far underground.\"\n\n\"But,\" I objected, \"man cannot live and flourish like a mole continually\nremoved from the light of day, without the health-giving rays of the\nsun, which man needs.\"\n\n\"No?\" San-Lan jeered. \"Wild tribesmen might not be able to, but we are a\ncivilization. We shall make our own sunlight to order in the bowels of\nthe earth. If necessary, we can manufacture our air synthetically; not\nthe germ-laden air of Nature, but absolutely pure air. Our underground\ncities will be heated or refrigerated artificially as conditions may\nrequire. Why should we not live underground if we desire? We produce all\nour needs synthetically.\n\n\"Nor will you be able to locate our cities with electronic indicators.\n\n\"You see, Rogers, I know what is in your mind. Our scientists have\nplanned carefully. All our machinery and processes will be shielded so\nthat no electronic disturbances will exist at the surface.\n\n\"And then, from our underground cities we will emerge at leisure to wage\nmerciless war on your wild men of the forest, until we have at last done\nwhat our forefathers should have done, exterminated them to the last\nbeast.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe thrust his jeering face close to mine. \"Have you any answer to that?\"\nhe demanded.\n\nMy impulse was to plant my fist in his face, for I could think of no\nother answer. But I controlled myself, and even forced a hearty laugh,\nto irritate him.\n\n\"It is a fine plan,\" I admitted, \"but you will not have time to carry it\nthrough. Long before you can complete your new cities you will have been\ndestroyed.\"\n\n\"They will be completed within the week,\" he replied triumphantly. \"We\nhave not been asleep, and our mechanical and scientific resources make\nus masters of time as well as the earth. You shall see.\"\n\nNaturally I was worried. I would have given much if I could have passed\nthis information on to our chiefs.\n\nBut two days later a mighty exultation arose within me, when from far to\nthe east and also to the south there came the rolling and continuous\nthunder of rocket fire. I was in my own apartment at the time. The Han\ncaptain of my guard was with me, as usual, and two guards stood just\nwithin the door. The others were in the corridor outside. And as soon as\nI heard it, I questioned my jailer with a look. He nodded assent, and I\ndid what probably every disengaged person in Lo-Tan did at the same\nmoment, tuned in on the local broadcast of the Military Headquarters\nView and Control Room.\n\nIt was as though the side wall of my apartment had dissolved, and we\nlooked into a large room or office which had no walls or ceiling, these\nbeing replaced by the interior surface of a hemisphere, which was in\nfact a vast viewplate on which those in the room could see in every\ndirection. Some 200 staff officers had their desks in this room. Each\ndesk was equipped with a system of small viewplates of its own, and each\nofficer was responsible for a given directional section of the \"map,\"\nand busied himself with teleprojectoscope examination of it, quite\nindependently of the general view thrown on the dome plate.\n\nAt a raised circular desk in the center, which was composed entirely of\nviewplates, sat the Executive Marshal, scanning the hemisphere, calling\noccasionally for telescopic views of one section or another on his desk\nplates, and noting the little pale green signal lights that flashed up\nas Sector Observers called for his attention.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMembers of Strategy Board, Base Commanders of military units, and\nSan-Lan himself, I understood, sat at similar desks in their private\noffices, on which all these views were duplicated, and in constant\nverbal and visual communication with one another and with the Executive\nMarshal.\n\nThe particular view which appeared on my own wall fortunately showed the\neast side of the dome viewplate and in one corner of my picture appeared\nthe Executive Marshal himself.\n\nAlthough I was getting a viewplate picture of a viewplate picture, I\ncould see the broad, rugged valley to the east plainly, and the\nrelatively low ridge beyond, which must have been some thirty miles\naway.\n\nIt was beyond this, evidently far beyond it, that the scene of the\naction was located, for nothing showed on the plate but a misty haze\npermeated by indefinite and continuous pulsations of light, and against\nwhich the low mountain ridge stood out in bold relief.\n\nSomewhere on the floor of the Observation room, of course, was a Sector\nObserver who was looking beyond that ridge, probably through a\nprojectoscope station in the second or third \"circle,\" located perhaps\non that ridge or beyond it.\n\nAt the very moment I was wishing for his facilities the Executive\nMarshal leaned over to a microphone and gave an order in a low tone.\nThe hemispherical view dissolved, and another took its place, from the\nthird circle. And the view was now that which would be seen by a man\nstanding on the low distant ridge.\n\nThere was another broad valley, a wide and deep canyon, in fact, and\nbeyond this still another ridge, the outlines of which were already\nbeginning to fade into the on-creeping haze of the barrage. The flashes\nof the great detonating rockets were momentarily becoming more vivid.\n\n\"That's the Gok-Man ridge,\" mused the Han officer beside me in the\napartment, \"and the Forest Men must be more than fifty miles beyond\nthat.\"\n\n\"How do you figure that?\" I asked curiously.\n\n\"Because obviously they have not penetrated our scout lines. See that\nline of observers nearest the dome itself. They're all busy with their\ndesk plates. They're in communication with the scout line. The scout\nline broadcast is still in operation. It looks as though the line is\nstill unpierced, but the tribesmen's rockets are sailing over and\nfalling this side of it.\"\n\nAll through the night the barrage continued. At times it seemed to creep\ncloser and then recede again. Finally it withdrew, pulling back to the\nAmerican lines, to alternately advance and recede. At last I went to\nsleep. The Han officer seemed to be a relatively good-natured fellow,\nfor one of his race, and he promised to awake me if anything further of\ninterest took place.\n\nHe didn't though. When I awoke in the morning, he gave me a brief\noutline of what had happened.\n\nIt was pieced together from his own observations and the public news\nbroadcast.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nThe Mysterious \"Air Balls\"\n\n\nThe American barrage had been a long distance bombardment, designed,\napparently, to draw the Han disintegrator ray batteries into operation\nand so reveal their positions on the mountain tops and slopes, for the\nHans, after the destruction of Nu-Yok, had learned quickly that\nconcealment of their positions was a better protection than a\nsurrounding wall of disintegrator rays shooting up into the sky.\n\nThe Hans, however, had failed to reply with disintegrator rays. For\nalready this arm, which formerly they had believed invincible, was being\nrestricted to a limited number of their military units, and their\nfactories were busy turning out explosive rockets not dissimilar to\nthose of the Americans in their motive power and atomic detonation.\nThey had replied with these, shooting them from unrevealed positions,\nand at the estimated positions of the Americans.\n\nSince the Americans, not knowing the exact location of the Han outer\nline, had shot their barrage over it, and the Hans had fired at unknown\nAmerican positions, this first exchange of fire had done little more\nthan to churn up vast areas of mountain and valley.\n\nThe Hans appeared to be elated, to feel that they had driven off an\nAmerican attack. I knew better. The next American move, I felt, would be\nthe occupation of the air, from which they had driven the Hans, and from\nswoopers to direct the rocket fire at the city itself. Then, when they\nhad destroyed this, they would sweep in and hunt down the Hans, man to\nman, in the surrounding mountains. Command of the air was still\nimportant in military strategy, but command of the air rested no longer\nin the air, but on the ground.\n\nThe Hans themselves attempted to scout the American positions from the\nair, under cover of a massed attack of ships in \"cloud bank\" or beaming\nformation, but with very little success. Most of their ships were shot\ndown, and the remainder slid back to the city on sharply inclined\nrepeller rays, one of them which had its generators badly damaged while\nstill fifty miles out, collapsed over the city, before it could reach\nits berth at the airport, and crashed down through the glass roof of the\ncity, doing great damage.\n\nThen followed the \"air balls,\" an unforeseen and ingenious resurrection\nby the Americans of an old principle of air and submarine tactics,\nthrough a modern application of the principle of remote control.\n\nThe air balls took heavy toll of the morale of the Hans before they were\nclearly understood by them, and even afterward for that matter.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTheir first appearance was quite mysterious. One uneasy night, while the\npulsating growl of the distant barrage kept the nerves of the city's\ninhabitants on edge, there was an explosion near the top of a pinnacle\nnot far from the Imperial Tower. It occurred at the 732nd level, and\ncaused the structure above it to lean and sag, though it did not fall.\n\nRepair men who shot up the shafts a few minutes later to bring new\nbroadcast lamps to replace those which had been shattered, reported what\nseemed to be a sphere of metal, about three feet in diameter, with a\nfour-inch lens in it, floating slowly down the shaft, as though it were\nsome living creature making a careful examination, pausing now and then\nas its lens swung about like a great single eye. The moment this \"eye\"\nturned upon them, they said, the ball \"rushed\" down on them, crushing\nseveral to death in its vicious gyrations, and jamming the mechanism of\nthe elevator, though failing to crash through it. Then, said the wounded\nsurvivors, it floated back up the shaft, watchfully \"eyeing\" them, and\nslipped off to the side at the wrecked level.\n\nThe next night several of these \"air balls\" were seen, following\nexplosions in various towers and sections of the city roof and walls. In\neach case repair gangs were \"rushed\" by them, and suffered many\ncasualties. On the third night a few of the air balls were destroyed by\nthe repair men and guards, who now were equipped with disintegrator\npistols.\n\nThis, however, was pretty costly business, for in each case the ray\nbored into the corridor and shaft walls beyond its target, wrecking much\nmachinery, injuring the structural members of that section, penetrating\napartments and taking a number of lives. Moreover, the \"air balls,\"\nbeing destroyed, could not be subjected to scientific inspection.\n\nAfter this the explosions ceased. But for many days the sudden\nappearances of those \"air balls\" in the corridors and shafts of the city\ncaused the greatest confusion, and many times they were the cause of\ndeath and panic.\n\nAt times they released poison gases, and not infrequently themselves\nburst, instead of withdrawing, in a veritable explosion of disease\ngerms, requiring absolute quarantine by the Han medical department.\n\nThere was an utter heartlessness about the defense of the Han\nauthorities, who considered nothing but the good of the community as a\nwhole; for when they established these quarantines, they did not\nhesitate to seal up thousands of the city's inhabitants behind hermetic\nbarriers enclosing entire sections of different levels, where deprived\nof food and ventilation, the wretched inhabitants died miserably, long\nbefore the disease germs developed in their systems.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt the end of two weeks the entire population of the city was in a mood\nof panicky revolt. News service to the public had been suspended, and\nthe use of all viewplates and phones in the city were restricted to\nofficial communications. The city administration had issued orders that\nall citizens not on duty should keep to their apartments, but the order\nwas openly flouted, and small mobs were wandering through the corridors,\nascending and descending from one level to another, seeking they knew\nnot what, fleeing the air balls, which might appear anywhere, and being\ndriven back from the innermost and deepest sections of the city by the\nmilitary guard.\n\nI now made up my mind that the time was ripe for me to attempt my\nescape. In all this confusion I might have an even break, in spite of\nthe danger I might myself run from the air balls, and the almost\ninsuperable difficulties of making my way to the outside of the city and\ndown the precipitous walls of the mountain to which the city clung like\na cap. I would have given much for my inertron belt, that I might simply\nhave leaped outward from the edge of the roof some dark night and\nfloated gently down. I longed for my ultrophone equipment, with which I\nmight have established communication with the beleaguering American\nforces.\n\nMy greatest difficulty, I knew, would be that of escaping my guard. Once\nfree of them, I figured it would be the business of nobody in\nparticular, in that badly disorganized city, to recapture me. The knives\nof the ordinary citizens I did not fear, and very few of the military\nguard were armed with disintegrator pistols.\n\nI was sitting in my apartment busying my mind with various plans, when\nthere occurred a commotion in the city corridor outside my door. The\ncaptain of my guard jumped nervously from the couch on which he had been\nreclining, and ordered the excited guards to open the door.\n\nIn the broad corridor, the remainder of the guard lay about, dead or\ngroaning, where they had been bowled over by one of these air balls, the\nfirst I had ever seen.\n\nThe metal sphere floated hesitantly above its victims, turning this way\nand that to bring its \"eye\" on various objects around. It stopped dead\non sighting the door the guard had thrown open, hesitated a moment, and\nthen shot suddenly into the apartment with a hissing sound, flinging\ninto a far corner one of the guards who had not been quick enough to\nduck. As the captain drew his disintegrator pistol, it launched itself\nat him with a vicious hiss. He bounded back from the impact, his chest\ncrushed in, while his pistol, which fortunately had fallen with its\nmuzzle pointed away from me, shot a continuous beam that melted its way\ninstantly through the apartment wall.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe sphere then turned on the other guard, who had thrown himself into a\ncorner where he crouched in fear. Deliberately it seemed to gauge the\ndistance and direction. Then it hurled itself at him with another\nvicious hiss, which I now saw came from a little rocket motor, crushing\nhim to death where he lay.\n\nIt swung slowly around until the lens faced me again, and floated gently\ninto position level with my face, seeming to scan me with its blank,\nfour-inch eye. Then it spoke, with a metallic voice.\n\n\"If you are an American,\" it said, \"answer with your name, gang and\nposition.\"\n\n\"I am Anthony Rogers,\" I replied, still half bewildered, \"Boss of the\nWyomings. I was captured by the Hans after my swooper was disabled in a\nfight with a Han airship and had drifted many hundred miles westward.\nThese Hans you have killed were my guard.\"\n\n\"Good!\" ejaculated the metal ball. \"We have been hunting for you with\nthese remote control rockets for two weeks. We knew you had been\ncaptured. A Han message was picked up. Close the door of your room, and\nhide this ball somewhere. I have turned off the rocket power. Put it on\nyour couch. Throw some pillows over it. Get out of sight. We'll speak\nsoftly, so no Hans can hear, and we'll speak only when you speak to us.\"\n\nThe ball, I found, was floating freely in the air. So perfectly was it\nbalanced with ultron and inertron that it had about the weight of a\nspider web. Ultimately, I suppose, it would have settled to the floor.\nBut I had no time for such an idle experiment. I quickly pushed it to my\ncouch, where I threw a couple of pillows and some of the bed clothes\nover it. Then I threw myself back on the couch with my head near it. If\nthe dead guards outside attracted attention, and the Han patrol entered,\nI could report the attack by the \"air ball\" and claim that I had been\nknocked unconscious by it.\n\n\"One moment,\" said the ball, after I reported myself ready to talk.\n\"Here is someone who wants to speak to you.\" And I nearly leaped from\nthe couch with joy when, despite the metallic tone of the instrument, I\nrecognized the eager, loving voice of my wife, almost hysterical in her\nown joy at talking to me again.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nEscape!\n\n\nWe had little time, however, to waste in endearments, and very little to\ndevote to informing me as to the American plans. The essential thing\nwas that I report the Han plans and resources to the fullest of my\nability. And for an hour or two I talked steadily, giving an outline of\nall I had learned from San-Lan and his Councillors, and particularly of\nthe arrangements for drawing off the population of the city to new\ncities concealed underground, through the system of tunnels radiating\nfrom the base of the mountain. And as a result, the Americans determined\nto speed up their attack.\n\nThere were, as a matter of fact, only two relatively small commands\nfacing the city, Wilma told me, but both of them were picked troops of\nthe new Federal Council. Those to the south were a division of veterans\nwho a few weeks before had destroyed the Han city of Sa-Lus (St. Louis).\nOn the east were a number of the Colorado Gangs and an expeditionary\nforce of our own Wyomings. The attack on Lo-Tan was intended chiefly as\nan attack on the morale of the Hans of the other twelve cities. If there\nseemed to be a chance of victory, the operations were to be pushed\nthrough. Otherwise the object would be to do as much damage as possible,\nand fade away into the forests if the Hans developed any real pressure\nwith their new infantry and field batteries of rocket guns and\ndisintegrator-rays.\n\nThe \"air balls\" were simply miniature swoopers of spherical shape,\nultronically controlled by operators at control boards miles away, and\nwho saw on their viewplates whatever picture the ultronic television\nlens in the sphere itself picked up at the predetermined focus. The main\npropulsive rocket motor was diametrically opposite the lens, so that the\nsphere could be steered simply by keeping the picture of its objective\ncentered on the crossed hairlines of the viewplates. The outer shell\nmoved magnetically as desired with respect to the core, which was\ngyroscopically stabilized. Auxiliary rocket motors enabled the operator\nto make a sphere move sidewise, backward or vertically. Some of these\nspheres were equipped with devices which enabled their operators to hear\nas well as see through their ultronic broadcasts, and most of those\nwhich had invaded the interior of Lo-Tan were equipped with \"speakers,\"\nin the hope of finding me and establishing communication. Still others\nwere equipped for two-stage control. That is, the operator control led\nthe vision sphere, and through it watched and steered an air torpedo\nthat travelled ahead of it.\n\nThe Han airship or any other target selected by the operator of such a\ncombination was doomed. There was no escape. The spheres and torpedoes\nwere too small to be hit. They could travel with the speed of bullets.\nThey could trail a ship indefinitely, hover a safe distance from their\nmark, and strike at will. Finally, neither darkness nor smoke screens\nwere any bar to their ultronic vision. The spheres, which had penetrated\nand explored Lo-Tan in their search for me, had floated through breaches\nin the walls and roofs made by their advance torpedoes.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWilma had just finished explaining all this to me when I heard a noise\noutside my door. With a whispered warning I flung myself back on the\ncouch and simulated unconsciousness. When I did not answer the poundings\nand calls to open, a police detail broke in and shook me roughly.\n\n\"The air ball,\" I moaned, pretending to regain consciousness slowly. \"It\ncame in from the corridor. Look what it did to the guard. It must have\ngrazed my head. Where is it?\"\n\n\"Gone,\" muttered the under-officer, looking fearfully around. \"Yes,\nundoubtedly gone. These men have been dead some time. And this pistol.\nThe ball got him before he had a chance to use it. See, it has beamed\nthrough the wall only here, where he dropped it. Who are you? You look\nlike a tribesman. Oh, yes, you're the Heaven-Born's special prisoner.\nMaybe I ought to beam you right now. Good thing. Everyone would call it\nan accident. By the Grand Dragon, I will!\"\n\nWhile he was talking, I had staggered to the other side of the room, to\ndraw his attention away from the couch where the ball was concealed.\n\nNow suddenly the pillows burst apart, and a blanket with which I had\ncovered the thing streaked from the couch, hitting the man in the small\nof the back. I could hear his spine snap under the impact. Then it shot\nthrough the air toward the group of soldiers in the doorway, bowling\nthem over and sending them shrieking right and left along the corridor.\nRelentlessly and with amazing speed it launched itself at each in turn,\nuntil the corpses lay grotesquely strewn about, and not one had escaped.\n\nIt returned to me for all the world like an old-fashioned ghost, the\nblanket still draped over it (and not interfering with its ultronic\nvision in the least) and \"stood\" before me.\n\n\"The yellow devils were going to kill you, Tony,\" I heard Wilma's voice\nsaying. \"You've got to get out of there, Tony, before you are killed.\nBesides, we need you at the control boards, where you can make real use\nof your knowledge of the city. Have you your jumping belt, ultrophone\nand rocket gun?\"\n\n\"No,\" I replied, \"they are all gone.\"\n\n\"It would be no good for you to try to make your way to one of the\nbreaches in the wall, nor to the roof,\" she mused.\n\n\"No, they are too well guarded,\" I replied, \"and even if you made a new\none at a predetermined spot I'm afraid the repair men and the patrol\nwould go to it ahead of me.\"\n\n\"Yes, and they would beam you before you could climb inside of a\nswooper,\" she added.\n\n\"I'll tell you what I can do, Wilma,\" I suggested. \"I know my way about\nthe city pretty well. Suppose I go down one of the shafts to the base of\nthe mountain. I think I can get out. It is dark in the valley, so the\nHans cannot see me, and I will stand out in the open, where your\nultroscopes can pick me up. Then a swooper can drop quickly down and get\nme.\"\n\n\"Good!\" Wilma said. \"But take that Han's disintegrator pistol with you.\nAnd go right away, Tony. But wrap this ball in something and carry it\nwith you. Just toss it from you if you are attacked. I'll stay at the\ncontrol board and operate it in case of emergency.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSo I picked up ball and pistol, and thrust the hand in which I held it\ninto the loose Han blouse I wore, wrapped the ball in a piece of\nsheeting, and stepped out in the corridor, hurrying toward the nearest\nmagnetic car station, a couple of hundred feet down the corridor, for I\nhad to cross nearly the entire width of the city to reach the shaft that\nwent to the base of the mountain.\n\nI thanked Providence for the perfection of the Han mechanical devices\nwhen I reached the station. The automatic checking system of these cars\nmade station attendants unnecessary. I had only to slip the key I had\ntaken from the dead Han officer into the account-charting machine at the\nstation to release a car.\n\nPressing the proper combinations of main and branch line buttons, I\nseated myself, holding the pistol ready but concealed beneath my blouse.\nThe car shot with rapid acceleration down the narrow tunnel.\n\nThe tubes in which these magnetic cars (which slid along a few inches\nabove the floor of the tunnel by localized repeller rays) ran were very\nnarrow, just the width of the car, and my only danger would come if on\ncatching up to another car its driver should turn around and look in my\nface. If I kept my face to the front, and hunched over so as to conceal\nmy size, no driver of a following car would suspect that I was not a\nHan like himself.\n\nThe tube dipped under traffic as it came to a trunk line, and my car\nmagnetically lagged, until an opening in the traffic permitted it to\nswing swiftly into the main line tunnel. At the automatic distance of\nten feet it followed a car in which rode a scantily clad girl, her\nflimsy silks fluttering in the rush of air. I cursed my luck. She would\nbe far more likely to turn around than a man, to see if a man were in\nthe car behind, and if he were personable--for not even the impending\ndoom of the city and the public demoralization caused by the \"air balls\"\nhad dulled the proclivities of the Han women for brazen flirtation. And\nturn around she did.\n\nBefore I could lower my head she had seen my face, and knew I was no\nHan. I saw her eyebrows arch in surprise. But she seemed puzzled rather\nthan scared. Before she could make up her mind about me, however, her\ncar had swung out of the main tunnel on its predetermined course, and my\nown automatically was closing up the gap to the car ahead. The passenger\nin this one wore the uniform of a medical officer, but he did not turn\naround before I swung out of main traffic to the little station at the\nhead of the shaft.\n\nThis particular shaft was intended to serve the very lowest levels\nexclusively, and since its single car carried nothing but express\ntraffic, it was used only by repair men and other specialists who\noccasionally had to descend to those levels.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere were only three people on the little platform, which reminded me\nvery much of the subway stations of the Twentieth Century. Two men and a\ngirl stood facing the gate of the shaft, waiting for the car to return\nfrom below. One of these was a soldier, apparently off duty, for though\nhe wore the scarlet military coat he carried no weapons other than his\nknife. The other man wore nothing but sandals and a pair of loose short\npants of some heavy and serviceable material. I did not need to look at\nthe compact tool kit and the ray machines attached to his heavy belt,\nnor the gorgeously jewelled armlet and diadem that he wore to know him\nfor a repair man.\n\nThe girl was quite scantily clad, but wore a mask, which was not unusual\namong the Han women when they went forth on their flirtatious\nexpeditions, and there was something about the sinuous grace of her\nmovements that seemed familiar to me. She was making desperate love to\nthe repair man, whose attitude toward her was that of pleased but lofty\ntolerance. The soldier, who was seeking no trouble, occupied himself\nstrictly with his own thoughts and paid little attention to them.\n\nI stepped from my car, still carrying my bundle in which the \"air ball\"\nwas concealed, and the car shot away as I threw the release lever over.\nNot so successful as the soldier in simulating lack of interest in the\namorous girl and her companion, I drew from the latter a stare of\nhaughty challenge, and the girl herself turned to look at me through her\nmask.\n\nShe gasped as she did so, and shrank back in alarm. And I knew her then\nin spite of her mask. She was the favorite of the Heaven-Born himself.\n\n\"Ngo-Lan!\" I exclaimed before I could catch myself.\n\nAt the mention of her name, the soldier's head jerked up quickly, and\nthe girl herself gave a little cry of terror, shrinking against her\nburly companion. This would mean death for her if it reached the ears of\nher lord.\n\nAnd her companion, arrogant in his immunity as a repair man, hesitated\nnot a second. His arm shot out toward the soldier, who was nearer to him\nthan I. There was the flash of a knife blade, and the soldier sagged on\nhis feet, then tumbled over like a sack of potatoes, and before my mind\nhad grasped the danger, he had swept the girl aside and was springing at\nme.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat I lived for a moment even was due to the devotion of my wife,\nWilma, who somewhere in the mountains to the east was standing loyally\nbefore the control board of the air ball I carried.\n\nFor even as the Han leaped at me, the bundle containing the air ball,\nwhich I had placed at my feet, shot diagonally upward, catching the\nfellow in the middle of his leap, hurling him back against the grilled\ngate of the elevator shaft, and pinning his lifeless body there.\n\nAn instant the girl gazed in speechless horror at what had been her\nsecret lover, then she threw herself at my feet, writhing and shrieking\nin terror.\n\nAt this moment, the elevator shot to a sudden stop behind the grill, and\nprepared for the worst, I faced it, disintegrator pistol raised.\n\nBut I lowered the pistol at once, with a sigh of relief. The elevator\nwas empty. For a moment I considered. I dared not leave either of these\nbodies nor the girl behind in descending the shaft. At any moment other\npassengers might glide out of the tunnel to take the elevator, and give\nan alarm.\n\nSo I played the beam of the pistol for an instant on the two dead\nbodies. They vanished, of course, into nothingness, as did part of the\nstation platform. The damage to the platform, however, would not\nnecessarily be interpreted as evidence of a prisoner escaping.\n\nThen I threw open the elevator gate, dragging Ngo-Lan into the car and\nstifling her hysterical shrieks, pressed the button that caused it to\nshoot downward. In a few moments I stepped out several thousand feet\nbelow, into a shaft that ran toward one of the Valley Gates.\n\nThe pistol again became serviceable, this time for the destruction of\nthe elevator, thus blocking any possible pursuit, yet without revealing\nmy flight.\n\nNgo-Lan fought like a cat, but despite her writhing, scratching and\nbiting, I bound and gagged her with her own clothing, and left her lying\nin the tunnel while I stepped in a car and shot toward the gate.\n\nAs the car glided swiftly along the brilliantly lit but deserted tunnel\nI conversed again with Wilma through the metallic speaker of the air\nball.\n\n\"The only obstacle now,\" I told her, \"is the massive gate at the end of\nthe tunnel. The gate-guard, I think, is posted both outside and inside\nthe gate.\"\n\n\"In that case, Tony,\" she replied, \"I will shoot the ball ahead, and\nblow out the gate. When you hear it bump against the gate, throw\nyourself flat in the car, for an instant later I will explode it. Then\nyou can rush through the gate into the night. Scout ships are now\nhovering above, and they will see you with their ultroscopes, though the\ndarkness will leave you invisible to the Hans.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith this the ball shot out of the car and flashed away, down the tunnel\nahead of me. I heard a distant metallic thump, and crouched low in the\nspeeding car, clapping my hands to my ears. The heavy detonation which\nfollowed, struck me like a blow, and left me gasping for breath. The car\nstaggered like a living thing that had been struck, then gathered speed\nagain and shot forward toward the gaping black hole where the gate had\nbeen.\n\nI brought it to a stop at the pile of debris, and climbed through this\nto freedom and the night. Stumblingly I made my way out into the open,\nand waited.\n\nBehind, and far above me on the mountain peak, the lights of the city\ngleamed and flashed, while the iridescent beams of countless\ndisintegrator ray batteries on surrounding mountain peaks, played\ncontinuously and nervously, criss-crossing in the sky above it.\n\nThen with a swish, a line dropped out of the sky, and a little seat\nrested on the ground beside me. I climbed into it, and without further\nado was whisked up into the swooper that floated a few hundred feet\nabove me.\n\nA half an hour later I was deposited in a little forest glade where the\nheadquarters of the Wyoming Gang were located, and was greeted with a\nfrantic disregard for decorum by the Deputy Boss of the Wyomings, who\nrushed upon me like a whirlwind, laughing, crying and whispering\nendearments all in the same breath, while I squeezed her, Wilma, my\nwife, until at last she gasped for mercy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nThe Destruction of Lo-Tan\n\n\n\"How did you know I had been taken to Lo-Tan as a prisoner?\" I asked the\nlittle group of Wyoming Bosses who had assembled in Wilma's tent to\ngreet me. \"And how does it happen that our gang is away out here in the\nRocky Mountains? I had expected, after the fall of Nu-Yok, that you\nwould join the forest ring around Bah-Flo (Buffalo I called it in the\nTwentieth Century) or the forces beleaguering Bos-Tan.\"\n\nThey explained that my encounter with the Han airship had been followed\ncarefully by several scopemen. They had seen my swooper shoot skyward\nout of control, and had followed it with their telultronoscopes until it\nhad been caught in a gale at a high level, and wafted swiftly westward.\nUltronophone warnings had been broadcast, asking western Gangs to rescue\nme if possible. Few of the Gangs west of the Alleghanies, however, had\nany swoopers, and though I was frequently reported, no attempts could be\nmade to rescue me. Scopemen had reported my capture by the Han ground\npost, and my probable incarceration in Lo-Tan.\n\nThe Rocky Mountain Gangs, in planning their campaign against Lo-Tan, had\nappealed to the east for help, and Wilma had led the Wyoming veterans\nwestward, though the other eastern Gang had divided their aid between\nthe armies before Bah-Flo and Bos-Tan.\n\nThe heavy bombardment which I had heard from Lo-Tan, they told me, was\nmerely a test of the enemy's tactics and strength, but it accomplished\nlittle other than to develop that the Hans had the mountains and peaks\nthickly planted with rocket gunners of their own. It was almost\nimpossible to locate these gun posts, for they were well camouflaged\nfrom air observation, and widely scattered; nor did they reveal their\npositions when they went into action as did their ray batteries.\n\nThe Hans apparently were abandoning their rays except for air defense. I\ntold what I knew of the Han plans for abandoning the city, and their\nescape tunnels. On the strength of this, a general council of Gang\nBosses was called. This council agreed that immediate action was\nnecessary, for my escape from the city probably would be suspected, and\nSan-Lan would be inclined to start an exodus at once.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs a matter of fact, the destruction of the city presented no real\nproblem to us at all. Explosive air balls could be sent against any\ntarget under a control that could not be better were their operators\nriding within them, and with no risk to the operators. When a ball was\nexploded on its target by the operator, or destroyed by accident, he\nsimply reported the fact to the supply division, and a fresh one was\nplaced on the jump-off, tuned to his controls.\n\nTo my own Gang, the Wyomings, the Council delegated the destruction of\nthe escape tunnels of the enemy. We had a comfortably located camp in a\nwooded canyon, some hundred and thirty miles northeast of the city, with\nabout 500 men, most of whom were bayonet-gunners, 350 girls as\nlong-gunners and control-board operators, 91 control boards and about\n250 five-foot, inertron-protected air balls, of which 200 were of the\nexplosive variety.\n\nI ordered all control boards manned, taking Number One myself, and\ninstructed the others to follow my lead in single file, at the minimum\ninterval of safety, with their projectiles set for signal rather than\ncontact detonation.\n\nIn my mind I paid humble tribute to the ingenuity of our engineers as I\ngently twisted the lever that shot my projectile vertically into the air\nfrom the jump-off clearing some half mile away.\n\nThe control board before me was a compact contrivance about five feet\nsquare. The center of it contained a four-foot viewplate. Whatever view\nwas picked up by the ultronoscope \"eye\" of the air ball was\nautomatically broadcast on an accurate tuning channel to this viewplate\nby the automatic mechanism of the projectile. In turn my control board\nbroadcast the signals which automatically controlled the movements of\nthe ball.\n\nAbove and below the viewplate were the pointers and the swinging needles\nwhich indicated the speed and angle of vertical movement, the altimeter,\nthe directional compass, and the horizontal speed and distance\nindicators.\n\nAt my left hand was the lever by which I could set the \"eye\" for\npenetrative, normal or varying degrees of telescopic vision, and at my\nright the universally jointed stick (much like the \"joy stick\" of the\nancient airplanes) with its speed control button on the top, with which\nthe ball was directionally \"pointed\" and controlled.\n\nThe manipulation of these levers I had found, with a very little\npractice, most instinctive and simple.\n\nSo, as I have said, I pointed my projectile straight up and let it shoot\nto the height of two miles. Then I levelled it off, and shot it at full\nspeed (about 500 miles an hour with no allowance for air currents) in a\ngeneral southwesterly direction, while I eased my controls until I\nbrought in the telescopic view of Lo-Tan. I centered the picture of the\ncity on the crossed hairlines in the middle of my viewpoint, and watched\nits image grow.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn about fifteen minutes the \"string\" of air balls was before the city,\nand speaking in my ultrophone I gave the order to halt, while I swung\nthe scope control to the penetrative setting and let my \"eye\" rove\nslowly back and forth through the walls of the city, hunting for a spot\nfrom which I might get my bearings. At last, after many penetrations, I\nmanaged to bring in a view of the head of the shaft at the bottom of\nwhich I knew the tunnels were located, and saw that we were none too\nsoon, for all the corridors leading toward this shaft were packed with\nHans waiting their turn to descend.\n\nSlowly I let my \"eye\" retreat down one of these corridors until I\n\"pulled it out\" through the outer wall of the city. There I held the\nspot on the crossed hairlines and ordered Number Two Operator to my\ncontrol board, where I pointed out to her the exact spot where I desired\na breach in the wall. Returning to her own board, she withdrew her ball\nfrom the \"string,\" and focussing on this spot in the wall, eased her\nprojectile into contact with it and detonated.\n\nThe atomic force of the explosion shattered a vast section of the wall,\nand for the moment I feared I had balked my own game by not having\nprovided a less powerful projectile.\n\nAfter some fumbling, however, I was able to maneuver my ball through a\ngap in the debris and find the corridor I was seeking. Down this\ncorridor I sent it at the speed of a Twentieth Century bullet, (this is\nto say, about half speed) to spare myself the sight of the slaughter as\nit cut a swath down the closely packed column of the enemy. If there\nwere any it did not kill, I knew they would be taken care of by the\nother balls in the string which would follow.\n\nI had to slow it up, however, near the head of the shaft to take my\nbearings; and a sea of evil faces, contorted with livid terror, looked\nat me from my viewplate. But not even the terror could conceal the hate\nin those faces, and there arose in my mind the picture of their long\ncenturies of ruthless cruelty to my race, and the hopelessness of\nchanging the tigerish nature of these Hans. So I steeled myself, and\ndrove the ball again and again into that sea of faces, until I had\ncleared the station platform of any living enemy, and sent the survivors\ncrushing their way madly along the corridors away from it. There was\nblinding flash or two on my viewplate as some Han officer tried his ray\npistol on my projectile, but that was all, except that he must have\ndisintegrated many of his fellows, for our balls were sheathed in\ninertron, and suffered no damage themselves.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCautioning my unit to follow carefully, I pushed my control lever all\nthe way forward until my \"eye\" pointed down, and there appeared on my\nviewplate the smooth cylindrical interior of the shaft, fading down\ntoward the base of the mountain, and like a tiny speck, far, far down,\nwas the car, descending with its last load.\n\nI dropped my ball on it, battering it down to the bottom of the shaft,\nand with hammer-like blows flattening the wreckage, that I might squeeze\nthe ball out of the shaft at the lower station.\n\nIt emerged into the great vaulted excavation, capable of holding a\nthousand or more persons, from which the various escape tunnels\nradiated. Down these tunnels the last remnants of a crowd of fugitives\nwere disappearing, while red-coated soldiers guided the traffic and\nsuppressed disorder with the threat of their spears, and the occasional\nflourish of a ray pistol.\n\nAs I floated my ball out into the middle of the artificial cavern I\ncould see them stagger back in terror. Again the blinding flashes of a\nfew ray pistols, and instantaneous borings of the rays into the walls.\nThe red coats nearest the escape tunnels fled down them in panic. Those\nwhose escape I blocked dropped their weapons and shrank back against the\nsmooth, iridescent green walls.\n\nI marshalled the rest of my string carefully into the cavern, and\ncounted the tunnel entrances, slowly swinging my \"eye\" around the\nsemicircle of them. There were 26 corridors diverging to the north and\nwest. I decided to send three balls down each, leave 12 in the cavern,\nthen detonate them all at once.\n\nAssigning my operators to their corridors, I ordered intervals of five\nmiles between them, and taking the lead down the first corridor, I\nordered \"go.\"\n\nSoon my ball overtook the stream of fugitives, smashing them down\ndespite ray pistols and even rockets that were shot against it. On and\non I drove it, time and again battering it through detachments of\nfleeing Hans, while the distance register on my board climbed to ten,\ntwenty, fifty miles.\n\nThen I called a halt, and suspended my previous orders. I had had no\nidea that the Hans had bored these tunnels for such distances under the\nsurface of the ground as this. It would be necessary to trace them to\ntheir ends and locate their new underground cities in which they\nexpected to establish themselves, and in which many had established\nthemselves by now, no doubt.\n\nFifty miles of air in these corridors, I thought, ought to prove a\npretty good cushion against the shock of detonation in the cavern. So I\nordered detonation of the twelve balls we had left behind. As I\nexpected, there was little effect from it so far out in the tunnels.\n\nBut from our scopemen who were covering the city from the outside, I\nlearned that the effects of the explosion on the mountain were terrific;\nfar more than I had dared to hope for.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe mountain itself burst asunder in several spots, throwing out\nthousands of tons of earth and rock. One-half the city itself tore loose\nand slid downward, lost in the debris of the avalanche of which it was a\npart. The remainder, wrenched and convulsed like a living thing in\nagony, cracked, crumbled and split, towers tumbling down and great\nfissures appearing in its walls. Its power plant and electro machinery\nwent out of commission. Fifteen of its scout ships hovering in the air\ndirectly above, robbed of the power broadcast and their repeller beams\ndisappearing, crashed down into the ruins.\n\nBut out in the escape tunnels, we continued our explorations, now sure\nthat no warnings could be broadcast to the tunnel exits, and mowed down\ncontingent after contingent of the hated yellow men.\n\nMy register showed seventy-five miles before I came to the end of the\ntunnel, and drove my ball out into a vast underground city of great,\nbrilliantly illuminated corridors, some of them hundreds of feet high\nand wide. The architectural scheme was one of lace-like structures of\ncurving lines and of indescribable beauty.\n\nWord had reached us now of the destruction of the city itself, so that\nno necessity existed for destroying the escape tunnels. In consequence,\nI ordered the two operators, who were following me, to send their balls\nout into this underground city, seeking the shaft which the Hans were\nsure to have as a secret exit to the surface of the earth above.\n\nBut at this juncture events of transcending importance interrupted my\nplans for a thorough exploration of these new subterranean cities of the\nHans. I detonated my projectile at once and ordered all of the operators\nto do so, and to tune in instantly on new ones. That we wrecked most of\nthese new cities I now know, but of course at the time we were in the\ndark as to how much damage we caused, since our viewplates naturally\nwent dead when we detonated our projectiles.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nThe Counter-Attack\n\n\nThe news which caused me to change my plans was grave enough. As I have\nexplained, the American lines lay roughly to the east and the south of\nthe city in the mountains. My own Gang held the northern flank of the\neast line. To the south of us was the Colorado Union, a force of 5,000\nmen and about 2,000 girls recruited from about fifteen Gangs. They were\na splendid organization, well disciplined and equipped. Their posts,\nrather widely distributed, occupied the mountain tops and other points\nof advantage to a distance of about a hundred and fifty miles to the\nsouth. There the line turned east, and was held by the Gangs which had\ncome up from the south. Now, simultaneously with the reports from my\nscouts that a large Han land force was working its way down on us from\nthe north, and threatening to outflank us, came word from Jim Hallwell,\nBig Boss of the Colorado Union and the commander in chief of our army,\nthat another large Han force was to the southwest of our western flank.\nAnd in addition, it seemed, most of the Han military forces at Lo-Tan\nhad been moved out of the city and advanced toward our lines before our\nair-ball attack.\n\nThe situation would not have been in the least alarming if the Hans had\nhad no better arms to fight with than their disintegrator rays, which\nnaturally revealed the locations of their generators the second the\nvisible beams went into play, and their airships, which we had learned\nhow to bring down, first from the air, and now from the ground, through\nultrono-controlled projectiles.\n\nBut the Hans had learned their lesson from us by this time. Their\nelectrono-chemists had devised atomic projectiles, rocket-propelled,\nvery much like our own, which could be launched in a terrific barrage\nwithout revealing the locations of their batteries, and they had\nequipped their infantry with rocket guns not dissimilar to ours. This\ndivision of their army had been expanded by general conscription. So far\nas ordnance was concerned, we had little advantage over them; although\ntactically we were still far superior, for our jumping belts enabled our\nmen and girls to scale otherwise inaccessible heights, conceal\nthemselves readily in the upper branches of the giant trees, and gave\nthem a general all around mobility, the enemy could not hope to equal.\n\nWe had the advantage too, in our ultronophones and scopes, in a field of\nenergy which the Hans could not penetrate, while we could cut in on\ntheir electrono or (as I would have called it in the Twentieth Century)\nradio broadcasts.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLater reports showed that there were no less than 10,000 Hans in the\nforce to our north, which evidently was equipped with a portable power\nbroadcast, sufficient for communication purposes and the local operation\nof small scoutships, painted a green which made them difficult to\ndistinguish against the mountain and forest backgrounds. These ships\njust skimmed the surface of the terrain, hardly ever outlining\nthemselves against the sky. Moreover, the Han commanders wisely had\nrefrained from massing their forces. They had developed over a very wide\nand deep front, in small units, well scattered, which were driving down\nthe parallel valleys and canyons like spearheads. Their communications\nwere working well too, for our scouts reported their advance as well\nrestrained, and maintaining a perfect front as between valley and\nvalley, with a secondary line of heavy batteries, moved by small\nairships from peak to peak, following along the ridges somewhat behind\nthe valley forces.\n\nHallwell had determined to withdraw our southern wing, pivoting it back\nto face the outflanking Han force on that side, which had already worked\nits way well down in back of our line.\n\nIn the ultronophone council which we held at once, each Boss tuning in\non Hallwell's band, though remaining with his unit, Wilma and I pleaded\nfor a vigorous attack rather than a defensive maneuver. Our suggestion\nwas to divide the American forces into three divisions, with all the\nswoopers forming a special reserve, and to advance with a rush on the\nthree Han forces behind a rolling barrage.\n\nBut the best we could do was to secure permission to make such an attack\nwith our Wyomings, if we wished, to serve as a diversion while the lines\nwere reforming. And two of the southern Gangs on the west flank, which\nwere eager to get at the enemy, received the same permission.\n\nThe rest of the army fumed at the caution of the council, but it spoke\nwell for their discipline that they did not take things in their own\nhands, for in the eyes of those forest men who had been hounded for\ncenturies, the chance to spring at the throats of the Hans outweighed\nall other considerations.\n\nSo, as the council signed off, Wilma and I turned to the eager faces\nthat surrounded us, and issued our orders.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn a moment the air was filled with leaping figures as the men and girls\nshot away over the tree tops and up the mountain sides in the deployment\nmovement.\n\nA group of our engineers threw themselves headlong toward a cave across\nthe valley, where they had rigged out a powerful electrono plant\noperating from atomic energy. And a few moments later the little\nportable receiver, the Intelligence Boss used to pick up the enemy\nmessages, began to emit such ear-splitting squeals and howls that he\nshut it off. Our heterodyne or \"radio-scrambling\" broadcast had gone\ninto operation, emitting impulses of constantly varying wave-length over\nthe full broadcast range and heterodyning the Han communications into\nfutility.\n\nIn a little while our scouts came leaping down the valley from the\nnorth, and our air balls now were hovering above the Han lines,\noperators at the control boards near-by painstakingly picking up the\npictures of the Han squads struggling down the valleys with their\ncomparatively clumsy weapons.\n\nAs fast as the air-ball scopes picked out these squads, their operators,\neach of whom was in ultronophone communication with a girl long-gunner\nat some spot in our line, would inform her of the location of the enemy\nunit, and the latter, after a bit of mathematical calculation, would\nsend a rocket into the air which would come roaring down on, or very\nnear that unit, and wipe it out.\n\nBut for all of that, the number of the Han squads were too much for us.\nAnd for every squad we destroyed, fifty advanced.\n\nAnd though the lines were still several miles apart, in most places, and\nin some cases with mountain ridges intervening, the Han fire control\nbegan to sense the general location of our posts, and things became more\nserious as their rockets too began to hiss down and explode here and\nthere in our lines, not infrequently killing or maiming one or more of\nour girls.\n\nThe men, our bayonet-gunners, had not as yet suffered, for they were\nwell in advance of the girls, under strict orders to shoot no rockets\nnor in any way reveal their positions; so the Han rockets were going\nover their heads.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Hans in the valleys now were shooting diagonal barrages up the\nslopes toward the ridges, where they suspected we would be most strongly\nposted, thus making a cross-fire up the two sides of a ridge, while\ntheir heavy batteries, somewhat in the rear, shot straight along the\ntops of the ridges. But their valley forces were getting out of\nalignment a bit by now, owing to our heterodyne operations.\n\nI ordered our swoopers, of which we had five, to sweep along above these\nridges and destroy the Han batteries.\n\nUp in the higher levels where they were located, the Hans had little\ncover. A few of their small rep-ray ships rose to meet our swoopers, but\nwere battered down. One swooper they brought to earth with a\ndisintegrator ray beam, by creating a vacuum beneath it, but they did it\nno serious damage, for its fall was a light one. Subsequently it did\ntremendous damage, cleaning off an entire ridge.\n\nAnother swooper ran into a catastrophe that had one chance in a million\nof occurring. It hit a heavy Han rocket nose to nose. Inertron sheathing\nand all, it was blown into powder.\n\nBut the others accomplished their jobs excellently. Small, two-man\nships, streaking straight at the Hans at between 600 and 700 miles an\nhour, they could not be hit except by sheer amazing luck, and they\nshowered their tiny but powerful bombs everywhere as they went.\n\nAt the same instant I ordered the girls to cease sharp-shooting, and lay\ntheir barrages down in the valleys, with their long-guns set for maximum\nautomatic advance, and to feed the reservoirs as fast as possible, while\nthe bayonet-gunners leaped along close behind this barrage.\n\nThen, with a Twentieth Century urge to see with my own eyes rather than\nthrough a viewplate, and to take part in the action, I turned command\nover to Wilma and leaped away, fifty feet a jump, up the valley, toward\nthe distant flashes and rolling thunder.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nVictory\n\n\nI had gone five miles, and had paused for a moment, half way up the\nslope of the valley to get my bearings, when a figure came hurtling\nthrough the air from behind, and landed lightly at my side. It was\nWilma.\n\n\"I put Bill Hearn in command and followed, Tony. I won't let you go into\nthat alone. If you die, I do, too. Now don't argue, dear. I'm\ndetermined.\"\n\nSo together we leaped northward again toward the battle. And after a bit\nwe pulled up close behind the barrage.\n\nGreat, blinding flashes, like a continuous wall of gigantic fireworks,\nreceded up the valley ahead of us, sweeping ahead of it a seething,\ntossing mass of debris that seemed composed of all nature, tons of\nearth, rocks and trees. Ever and anon vast sections of the mountain\nsides would loosen and slide into the valley.\n\nAnd, leaping close behind this barrage, with a reckless skill and\ncourage that amazed me, our bayonet-gunners appeared in a continuous\nseries of flashing pictures, outlined in midleap against the wall of\nfire.\n\nI would not have believed it possible for such a barrage to pass over\nany of the enemy and leave them unscathed. But it did. For the Hans,\noperating small disintegrator beams from local or field broadcasts,\nfrantically bored deep, slanting holes in the earth as the fiery tides\nof explosions rolled up the valleys toward them, and into these probably\nhalf of their units were able to throw themselves and escape\ndestruction.\n\nBut dazed and staggering they came forth again only to meet death from\nthe terrible, ripping, slashing, cleaving weapons in the hands of our\nleaping bayonet-gunners.\n\nThrust! Cut! Crunch! Slice! Thrust! Up and down with vicious, tireless,\nflashing speed, swung the bayonets and ax-bladed butts of the American\ngunners as they leaped and dodged, ever forward, toward new opponents.\n\nWeakly and ineffectually the red-coated Han soldiery thrust at them with\nspears, flailing with their short-swords and knives, or whipping about\ntheir ray pistols. The forest men were too powerful, too fast in their\nremorselessly efficient movement.\n\nWith a shout of unholy joy, I gripped a bayonet-gun from the hands of a\ngunner whose leg had been whisked out of existence beneath him by a\npistol ray, and leaped forward into the fight, launching myself at a\nred-coated officer who was just stepping out of a \"worm hole.\"\n\nLike a shriek of the Valkyrie, Wilma's battle cry rang in my ear as she,\ntoo, shot herself like a rocket at a red-coated figure.\n\nI thrust with every ounce of my strength. The Han officer, grinning\nwickedly as he tried to raise the muzzle of his pistol, threw himself\nbackward as my bayonet ripped the air under his nose. But his grin\nturned instantly to sickened surprise as the up-cleaving ax-blade on the\nbutt of my weapon caught him in the groin, half bisecting him.\n\nAnd from the corner of my eye I saw Wilma bury her bayonet in her\nopponent, screaming in ecstatic joy.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd so, in a matter of seconds, we found ourselves in the front rank,\nthrusting, cutting, dodging, leaping along behind that blinding and\ndeafening barrage in a veritable whirlwind of fury, until it seemed to\nme that we were exulting in a consciousness of excelling even that tide\nof destruction in our merciless efficiency.\n\nAt last we became aware, in but a vague sort of way at first, that no\nmore red-coats were rising up out of the ground to go down again before\nour whirling, swinging weapons. Gradually we paused, looking about in\nwonder. Then the barrage ceased, and the sudden absence of the deafening\nroll, and the wall of light, in themselves, deafened and blinded us.\n\nI leaped weakly toward the spot where hazily I spied Wilma, now drooping\nand swaying on her feet, supported as she was by her jumping belt, and\ncaught her in my arms, just as she was sinking gently to the ground.\n\nAll around us the weary warriors, crimsoned now with the blood of the\nenemy, were sinking to the ground in exhaustion. And as I too, sank\ndown, clutching in my arms the unconscious form of my warrior wife, I\nbegan to hear, through my helmet phones, the exultant report of\nheadquarters.\n\nOur attack had swept straight through the enemy's sector, completely\nannihilating everything except a few hundred of his troops on either\nflank. And these, in panic and terror, had scattered wildly in flight.\nWe had wiped out a force more than ten times our own number. The right\nflank of the American army was saved. And already the Colorado Union,\nfrom behind us, was leaping around in a great circling movement, closing\nin on the Han force that was advancing from the ruins of Lo-Tan.\n\nFar away, to the southwest, the southern Gangs, reinforced in the end\nby the bulk of our left wing, had struck straight at the enveloping Han\nforce shattering it like a thunderbolt, and at present were busily\nhunting down and destroying its scattered remnants.\n\nBut before the Colorado Union could complete the destruction of the\ncentral division of the enemy, the despairing Hans saved them the\ntrouble. Company after company of them, knowing no escape was possible,\nlined up in the forest glades and valleys, while their officers swept\nthem out of existence by the hundreds with their ray pistols, which they\nthen turned on themselves.\n\nAnd so the fall of Lo-Tan was accomplished. Somewhere in the seething\nactivities of these few days, San-Lan, the \"Heaven-Born,\" Emperor of the\nHans in America, perished, for he was heard of never again, and the\nunified action of the Hans vanished with him, though it was several\nyears before one by one their remaining cities were destroyed and their\npopulations hunted down, thus completing the reclamation of America and\ninaugurating the most glorious and noble era of scientific civilization\nin the history of the American race.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs I look back on those emotional and violent years from my present\nvantage point of declining existence in an age of peace and good will\ntoward all mankind, they do seem savage and repellent.\n\nThen there flashes into my memory the picture of Wilma (now long since\ngone to her rest) as, screaming in an utter abandon of merciless fury,\nshe threw herself recklessly, exultantly into the thick of that wild,\nrelentless slaughter; and my mind can find nothing savage nor repellent\nabout her.\n\nIf I, product of the relatively peaceful Twentieth Century, was so\ncompletely carried away by the fury of that war, intensified by\ncenturies of unspeakable cruelty on the part of the yellow men who were\nmentally gods and morally beasts, shall I be shocked at the\n\"bloodthirstiness\" of a mate who was, after all, but a normal girl of\nthat day, and who, girl as she was, never for a moment faltered in the\nhigh courage with which she threw herself into that combat, responding\nto the passionate urge for freedom in her blood that not five centuries\nof inhuman persecution could subdue?\n\nHad the Hans been raging tigers, or slimy, loathsome reptiles, would we\nhave spared them? And when in their centuries of degradation they had\ndestroyed the souls within themselves, were they in any way superior to\ntigers or snakes? To have extended mercy would have been suicide.\n\nIn the years that followed, Wilma and I travelled nearly every nation on\nthe earth which had succeeded in throwing off the Han domination,\nspurred on by our success in America, and I never knew her to show to\nthe men or women of any race anything but the utmost of sympathetic\ncourtesy and consideration, whether they were the noble brown-skinned\nCaucasians of India, the sturdy Balkanites of Southern Europe, or the\nsimple, spiritual Blacks of Africa, today one of the leading races of\nthe world, although in the Twentieth Century we regarded them as\ninferior. This charity and gentleness of hers did not fail even in our\ncontacts with the non-Han Mongolians of Japan and the coast provinces of\nChina.\n\nBut that monstrosity among the races of men which originated as a hybrid\nsomewhere in the dark fastnesses of interior Asia, and spread itself\nlike an inhuman yellow blight over the face of the globe--for that race,\nlike all of us, she felt nothing but horror and the irresistible urge to\nextermination.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLatterly, our historians and anthropologists find much support for the\ntheory that the Hans sprang from a genus of human-like creatures that\nmay have arrived on this earth with a small planet (or large meteor)\nwhich is known to have crashed in interior Asia late in the Twentieth\nCentury, causing certain permanent changes in the earth's orbit and\nclimate.\n\nGeological convulsions blocked this section off from the rest of the\nworld for many years. And it is a historical fact that Chinese\nscientists, driving their explorations into it at a somewhat later\nperiod, met the first wave of the on-coming Hans.\n\nThe theory is that these creatures (and certain queer skeletons have\nbeen found in the \"Asiatic Bowl\") with a mental superdevelopment, but a\nvacuum in place of that intangible something we call a soul, mated\nforcibly with the Tibetans, thereby strengthening their physical\nstructure to almost the human normal, adapting themselves to earthly\nspeech and habits, and in some strange manner intensifying even further\ntheir mental powers.\n\nOr, to put it the other way around. These Tibetans, through the\ninjection of this unearthly blood, deteriorated slightly physically,\nlost the \"soul\" parts of their nature entirely, and developed abnormally\nefficient intellects.\n\nHowever, through the centuries that followed, as the Hans spread over\nthe face of the earth, this unearthly strain in them not only became\nmore dilute, but lost its potency; and in the end, the poison of it\nsubmerged the power of it, and earth's mankind came again into\npossession of its inheritance.\n\nHow all this may be, I do not know. It is merely a hypothesis over which\nthe learned men of today quarrel.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut I do know that there was something inhuman about these Hans. And I\nhad many months of intimate contact with them, and with their Emperor in\nAmerica. I can vouch for the fact that even in his most friendly and\nhuman moments, there was an inhumanity, or perhaps \"unhumanity\" about\nhim that aroused in me that urge to kill.\n\nBut whether or not there was in these people blood from outside this\nplanet, the fact remains that they have been exterminated, that a truly\nhuman civilization reigns once more--and that I am now a very tired old\nman, waiting with no regrets for the call which will take me to another\nexistence.\n\nThere, it is my hope and my conviction that my courageous mate of those\nbloody days waits for me with loving arms.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    In this text the two prefixes _ultro-_ and _ultrono-_ have been\n    applied inconsistently to much of the future technology.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
