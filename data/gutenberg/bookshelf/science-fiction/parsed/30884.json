I. A soft answer turneth away wrath, leaving time for making\nplans.\n\nHe caught the flower, pleased with himself, Juba saw, for not\nfumbling, pleased with his manhood, pleased with his morality in\ndeciding not to rape her.\n\nRule a--A man pleased with himself is off guard.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was big, even for a Man, and all hair, and in his heavy arms the\nveins were knotted and very blue. He had taken off his shirt, letting\nthe air blow shamelessly over him.\n\nIt was true he was wonderful to see. And Juba knew that such is the\nnature of our violences, if she had been born into such a body, she\ntoo, would be a thing of wars and cruelty, a burner of cities, a\ncarrier of death and desolation.\n\nHis face softened, as though the hand of Juno had passed over it.\nSoftly he gazed at the flower, softly at Juba.\n\nRule b--This is the only time they are tractable.\n\n\"Vene mecum,\" she bade him, retreating into the glade--what was left\nof it after his ship burned a scar into it. She ran lightly, so as to\ngive the impression that if he turned, only so far as to pick up the\nweapon on the ground by his shirt, she would disappear.\n\n\"I follow,\" he said in her own language, and she stopped, surprise\ntangling her like a net. For she had been taught that Men speak only\nNew-language in our time, all soft tongues having been scorned to\ndeath.\n\nShe should not have stopped. He looked back toward his gun. \"Wait a\nmoment,\" he said. His \"a\"'s were flat and harsh, his words awkwardly\nsequenced.\n\n\"Come with me,\" she said, and ran off again. She had been caught off\nguard.\n\nWould he follow her? \"Wait!\" he cried, hesitated, and came after her\nagain. \"I want to get my gun.\" He reached for Juba's hand.\n\nShe shrank back from him. \"Mulier enim sum.\" Would he get the force of\nthe particle? What could he fear from a mere woman?\n\nWhen he had followed her far enough, when he had gone as far as he\nwould, for fear of losing his way from his ship, she let him take her\nhand.\n\n\"Terran sum,\" he said. And then, with meaning, \"Homino sum.\"\n\n\"Then you are, naturally, hungry,\" Juba said. \"You have no need to\ncome armed. Let me take you to my home. There are only my sisters and\nI and the mother.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, and took her other hand.\n\nShe blushed, because he was strangely attractive, and because the\nthought came to her that his ways were gentle, and that if he spoke a\nsoft tongue, perhaps he was not like other Men.\n\nRule c--They are all alike.\n\n\"Come,\" Juba said, turning, \"We are not far from the cottages.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe watched, during the meal, to see how he impressed the sisters and\nthe mother. The little sisters--all bouncy blond curls and silly with\nlaughter--their reaction to everything was excitement. And the\nmother--how could she seem so different from her daughters when they\nwere so completely of her? They had no genes but her genes. And yet,\nthere she sat, so dignified, offering a generous hospitality, but so\ncold Juba could feel it at the other end of the table. So cold--but\nthe Man would not know, could not read the thin line of her taut lips\nand the faint lift at the edges of her eyes.\n\nJuba brought him back to the ship that night, knowing he would not\nleave the planet.\n\n\"Mother,\" Juba said, kneeling before the mother and clasping her knees\nin supplication. \"Mother ... isn't he ... different?\"\n\n\"Juba,\" the mother said, \"there is blood on his hands. He has killed.\nCan't you see it in his eyes?\"\n\n\"Yes. He has a gun and he has used it. But mother--there is a\ngentleness in him. Could he not change? Perhaps I, myself....\"\n\n\"Beware,\" the mother said sternly, \"that you do not fall into your own\ntraps.\"\n\n\"But you have never really known a man, have you? I mean, except for\nservants?\"\n\n\"I have also,\" she said, \"never had an intimate conversation with a\nlion, nor shared my noonday thoughts with a spider.\"\n\n\"But lions and spiders can't talk. That's the difference. They have no\nunderstanding.\"\n\n\"Neither have men. They are like your baby sister, Diana, who is\nreasonable until it no longer suits her, and then the only difference\nbetween her and an animal is that she has more cunning.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Juba said resignedly, getting to her feet. \"If thus it is\nWritten. Thank you, Mother. You are a wellspring of knowledge.\"\n\n\"Juba,\" Mother said with a smile, pulling the girl's cloak, for she\nliked to please them, \"would you like him for a pet? Or your personal\nservant?\"\n\n\"No,\" she said, and she could feel the breath sharp in her lungs. \"I\nwould rather.... He would make a good spectacle in the gladiatorial\ncontests. He would look well with a sword through his heart.\"\n\nShe would not picture him a corpse. She put the picture from her mind.\nBut even less would she picture him unmanned.\n\nHe would rather die strong than live weak. And Juba--why should she\nhave this pride for him? For she felt pride, pangs as real as the\npangs of childbirth. There are different kinds of pride, but the worst\nkind of pride is pride in strength, pride in power. And she _knew_\nthat was what she felt. She was sinning with full knowledge and she\ncould not put her sin from her.\n\nJuba ran straight to the altar of Juno, and made libation with her own\ntears. \"Mother Juno,\" she prayed, \"take from me my pride. For pride is\nthe wellspring whence flow all sins.\"\n\nBut even as she prayed, her reason pricked at her. For she was taught\nfrom childhood to be reasonable above all things. And, having spoken\nwith this Man, having found him courteous and educated, she could not\nbelieve he was beyond redemption simply because he was a Man. It was\ntrue that in many ways he was strange and different. But were they not\nmore alike than different?\n\nAnd as for his violences--were they much better, with their\ngladiatorial combats? Supposed to remind them, of course, of the\nbloodshed they had abhorred and renounced. But who did not secretly\nenjoy it? And whose thumbs ever went up when the Moment came? And this\nmaking of pets and servants out of Men--what was that but the worst\npride of all? Glorying that a few incisions in the brain and elsewhere\ngave them the power to make forever absurd what came to them with the\nseeds at least of sublimity.\n\nJuba stood up. Who was she to decide what is right and what is wrong?\n\nShe faced the world and its ways were too dark for her, so she faced\naway.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a sound in the brush near her, and she wished the stars\nwould wink out, for the sound had the rhythm of her Mother's\napproach, and Juba wanted to hide her face from her mother.\n\nThe mother frowned at Juba, a little wearily. \"You have decided to\nforsake the world and become a Watcher of the Holy Flame. Am I not\nright?\"\n\n\"You are right, mother.\"\n\n\"You think that way you avoid decision, is that not right?\"\n\n\"That is right,\" Juba answered.\n\nShe motioned the girl to the edge of the raised, round stone and sat.\n\"It is impossible to avoid decision. The decision is already made.\nWhat you will not do, someone else will do, and all you will have\naccomplished is your own failure.\"\n\n\"It is true,\" Juba said. \"But why must this be done, Mother? This is a\nsilly ceremony, a thing for children, this symbolic trial. Can we not\njust say, 'Now Juba is a woman,' without having to humiliate this poor\nMan, who after all doesn't....\"\n\n\"Look into your heart, Juba,\" the mother interrupted. \"Are your\nfeelings silly? Is this the play of children?\"\n\n\"No,\" she admitted. For never before had she been thus tormented\nwithin herself.\n\n\"You think that this Man is different, do you not? Or perhaps that all\nmen are not so savage of soul as you have been taught. Well, I tell\nyou that a Man's nature is built into his very chromosomes, and you\nshould know that.\"\n\n\"I know, mother.\" For Juba was educated.\n\n\"There was a reason once, why men should be as they are. Nature is not\ngentle and if nature is left to herself, the timid do not survive. But\nif bloodlust was once a virtue, it is no longer a virtue, and if men\nwill end up killing each other off, let us not also be killed.\"\n\n\"No,\" Juba said. For who would mind the hearths?\n\n\"All that,\" the mother said, rising and dusting off her robe, \"is\ntheory, and ideas touch not the heart. Let me but remind you that the\nchoice is yours, and when the choice is made I shall not yea or nay\nyou, but think on this--a woman, too, must have her quiet strength,\nand you spring of a race of queens. How shall the people look to the\nTanaids for strength in times of doubt and trouble, if a Tanaid cannot\nmeet the Trial? The choice is yours. But think on who you are.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe mother slipped away and left Juba alone in the quiet precinct of\nJuno, watching how the little fire caught at the silver backs of\nturned leaves when the wind blew.\n\nYes, Juba knew who she was, though they had never made it an important\nthing to be a ruler. But ruler or not, she loved her land and her home\nand her people, and even this ringed space of quiet where the spirit\nof Juno burned safely. Life somehow had chosen for her to be born and\nhad made room for her in this particular place. Now _she_ must choose\n_it_, freely. Otherwise she would never have in her hands the threads\nof her own life, and there would be no life for her. Only the complete\nloss of self that comes to the Watchers of the Holy Flame. And that is\na holy thing, and an honor to one's house, if it is chosen from the\nheart. But if it is chosen from fear of crossing the passageways of\nlife--then it is no honor but a shame.\n\nAnd Juba knew she could not bear such a shame, either for her house or\nwithin the depths of her soul.\n\n\"Mother Juno,\" she prayed, \"make clear the vision of my soul, and let\nme not, in my vanity, think I find good what the goddesses see to be\nevil.\"\n\nSo she rose with a strong and grateful heart, as though she had\nalready faced her trial and had been equal to it.\n\nThe rest of the night she slept warmly, so unaware are we of the\nforces within us.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe first fingers of the sun pulled Juba from her cot, as they pull\nthe dew from the green things of the earth, and she pinned in her hair\nthe first Laesa she saw that the sun's fingers had forced.\n\nThe Man was standing beside his space ship again. It was a small\nship--indeed, from the angle of Juba's approach, and from the\nglancings of the sun, it looked smaller than the Man.\n\nJuba's decision held firm within her, for she saw there was no\nhumility in him. He stood there laughing at the dawn, as though he\nwere a very god, and were allowing the earth and sky to draw off their\nshadows for him, instead of standing in awe and full gratitude for the\ngift of life, and feeling, as one should, the smallness of a person\nand the weakness of a person's power, compared with the mighty forces\nthat roll earth and sky into another day.\n\nIt is in this way, Juba thought, that men seem strong, because they\nhave no knowledge of their own weaknesses. But it is only a seeming\nstrength, since it stems from ignorance, and the flower of it falls\nearly from the bush.\n\nJuba did not, however, say all this.\n\nRule d--A man's ego is his most precious possession.\n\n\"You are very strong,\" Juba said, her eyes downcast, for he was bare\nagain to the waist, and it had come to her that she would like to\nstring her fingers through the hair on his chest.\n\n\"Runs in the family,\" he said carelessly. \"But come, I had dinner with\nyou yesterday. Let's have breakfast in my ship today.\"\n\n\"I....\" What was she afraid of? If he'd meant to do her any violence,\nhe'd have done it already. And this would provide Juba's\nopportunity--\"Yes,\" she said. \"I would be delighted.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere had to be some talk, and perhaps something else, before she\ncould make her request of him. They had to be friends of some sort\nbefore he was at all likely to agree.\n\nIt is difficult to make conversation with a man.\n\nFinally Juba gave up trying to think of something interesting to say\nand asked, \"What is your way of life, that you should be going around\nby yourself in a space ship?\"\n\n\"My way of life?\" He laughed. \"It becomes a way of life, doesn't it?\nWhatever we do ends up enveloping us, doesn't it?\"\n\nFor a man he was thoughtful.\n\n\"I'm a scout,\" he said. \"I don't know that I chose it as a way of\nlife. I was born into the Solar Federation and I was born male and I\ngrew up healthy and stable and as patriotic as any reasonable person\ncan be expected to be. When war came I was drafted. I volunteered for\nscouting because the rest of it is dull. War is dull. It is\nunimaginably dull.\"\n\n\"Then why,\" Juba asked, for she was amazed at this, \"do you fight\nwars?\"\n\nAgain he laughed. Is there anything these men don't laugh at? \"That's\nthe riddle of the sphinx.\"\n\nThat is _not_ the riddle of the sphinx, but Juba did not correct him.\n\n\"When you're attacked,\" he went on, \"you fight back.\"\n\n\"It could not possibly,\" Juba said, \"be as simple as you make it\nsound.\"\n\n\"Of course, it isn't,\" he said, and he took two square sheets that\nlooked like papyrus, and put them each in a bowl. \"There is the\nquestion of what you did, or did not do, that you should be attacked.\"\n\n\"And what did you do, or not do, that you should be attacked?\"\n\nHe was pouring a bluish-looking milk over the papyrus thing. His hands\nwere too large for everything he handled, and Juba wondered, if his\nhand were on her wrist, if he could crush it. Or, being able to crush\nit, if he would take care not to.\n\n\"Oh--trade agreements, immigration agreements, how many space ships\ncan go where--who can say what either side did when or where to begin\nit all? Nobody is _making_ it happen. Sometimes, perhaps. But not as\nfar as this war is concerned. All I can say now is--O.K., for whatever\nreason I'm in a war. At this point, what can I do but kill or be\nkilled?\"\n\nJuba mashed the papyrus into the milk with her spoon, as the man was\ndoing. She took a bite. It tasted just like it looked.\n\n\"You could,\" Juba said, \"refuse to have anything to do with it at all.\nYou could simply go away and....\" She stood up and the spoon clattered\nto the floor and she could feel the bowl of milk spill cold and sticky\nalong her thigh. Because that's just what you can't do. You can't pull\nthe thread of your life out of the general weaving.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe looked at her adversary, and he was as close to her as the\ndarkness is to the evening.\n\n\"No,\" he said. \"Life flows. A person's life or a civilization's life\nor all humanity's life. If it cannot flow forward it flows backward.\nIsn't that true? _Isn't_ it?\"\n\nBut she turned away from him, to recover herself a little. For she\nfelt that he was right and her country and her foremothers were wrong\nand she was wrong and yet--she had made her choice last night, at the\naltar of Juno, and though she felt herself possessed by new\nunderstanding, she had to go on in spite of it, as though she fought\nwounded or blinded.\n\n\"You are perhaps right,\" Juba said. \"I am only a woman and I do not\nknow. But still, can you not take a few days from your war? Must you\nthink always on that and never on anything else?\"\n\nHe ate another of the paper things, not melting it first, and drank\nfrom the container.\n\n\"Look, Juba,\" he said, \"I've been thinking on other things ever since\nI got here, but first I want to....\"\n\n\"First,\" Juba interrupted, for here was her moment, \"I ask one thing\nof you. Only that you radio incorrect coordinates back to your base.\nSay you have moved on, that this is a barren world.\"\n\n\"Let me talk to you first,\" he said. \"I want to....\"\n\n\"Please,\" Juba begged, moving toward him. \"It is no loss to you. Only\na small favor, to protect our planet from outsiders, in return for ...\nfor whatever pleasures I can provide for you, or my sisters, if I do\nnot please you.\"\n\n\"All right,\" he said, turning to his communication equipment. \"If\nthat's the only way you're going to let me speak to you.\"\n\n\"Your tape,\" Juba said. \"Turn on your tape.\"\n\n\"Tape!\"\n\n\"I do not speak New-language. I will have to have it translated.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe man looked at Juba hard and worked at the corner of his mouth with\nhis tongue.\n\n\"All right,\" he said, flipping a switch. He turned to his equipment\nand spoke his strange language into it. It was rough and she liked it.\n\n\"Now,\" he began.\n\n\"Give me the tape,\" Juba interrupted.\n\nHe jostled a flat box out of the wall, held the tape up to the light\nand snapped off a small portion and handed it to Juba.\n\n\"Come outside,\" she said, taking his hand. \"My world is more beautiful\nthan your space ship.\"\n\n\"Can't deny that,\" he said, watching the branches of the Untouchable\nBush draw away as they walked through it.\n\n\"Now,\" he said, when he was stretched out on the undulant moss. He\nfelt at the patch of moss sprouting under the warmth of his palm, and\nwatched while an exploratory tendril curled around his little finger.\n\"Now--do you know what it is I want of you?\"\n\n\"I have,\" Juba said, \"some idea.\" She hadn't known they talked about\nit. She thought they just did it.\n\n\"Well, you're wrong.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" she said, and stood up and walked over to the brook so he would\nnot see her face. For she wondered wherein she was lacking and she was\nembarrassed. \"Then,\" she asked, \"what _do_ you want of me?\"\n\n\"There is, as I said, a war on. I am, as I said, a scout. I'm looking\nfor a communications base halfway between a certain strategic enemy\noutpost and a certain strategic allied outpost.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Why? I don't know why. Does the grain of sand know where the beach\nends? And if I did know, what would it matter?\"\n\n\"But why _this_ planet? There are other systems. Even other planets in\nthis system.\" The moss curled under her feet and pricked at her. She\nwas not doing this right. What did she care about his war? But she did\nnot know what to do. She had been prepared for Seduction, Step II, and\nhad even thought up a few things to say, though conversation is not\nincluded in the manual, because there is usually a language barrier.\nIt was his speaking the language that made the difference.\n\n\"This is the only immediately habitable planet. You don't realize how\nexpensive and cumbersome and logistically difficult it is to set up\nthe simplest station on an abnormal planet. Tons of equipment are\nneeded just to compensate for a few degrees too much temperature, or a\nfew degrees too little, or excessive natural radiation, or a slight\noff balance of atmosphere. Or even if a planet is _apparently_\nhabitable, there's no way of being absolutely sure until there have\nbeen people actually living on it for a while. There isn't time for\nall this. Can't you just believe me?\"\n\n\"I believe you,\" Juba said, \"and the answer is no. It is not my\ndecision to make. I cannot decide for my people. And if I could, the\nanswer would still be no. That is exactly why we cut ourselves off\nfrom the rest of civilization. To stay out of your wars, to carry on\ncivilization when you have laid it waste. That is why we are a planet\nof parthenogenetic women.\"\n\n\"Is it?\" he asked. \"Was it to carry on the torch for civilization or\nto flee from it? Life flows, Juba. If it doesn't flow forward, it\nflows backward. Which way does your world go?\"\n\nWhich way? The little stream scrambled over its bright rocks, flashing\nthe sunlight like teeth laughing.\n\nWhich way? The servants, the pets, the gladiatorial contests. The old\ngoddesses. Were we becoming weary with time? Juba wondered. What sense\ndid it make? What future did it mold?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Man got up and came to put his arms around Juba, crossing his\narms over her chest and putting his hands on her shoulders. He leaned\ndown until she could feel his breath on the back of her neck.\n\nThen it was that Juba could feel from his strength that everything he\nsaid must be right, because he said it, and that he was the name for\nall those things inside her which had no name.\n\n\"I cannot bring you in for the Ceremonies,\" Juba said. \"Whatever you\nare and whatever I am--these futures must lie with the goddesses. But\nsacrifice you I cannot.\" She turned in his arms. \"Go,\" she said. \"And\nquickly.\"\n\nHe kissed her. \"I will not go,\" he said, and she wanted very much for\nhim to stay, but not for the Ceremonies.\n\n\"I was to draw you into the gladiatorial contests,\" she said, \"with\nrich promises. But I cannot. For those who die it is bad. But for\nthose who live it is worse.\"\n\n\"Well, now you have told me and I will not be drawn,\" he said with\nthat grin. \"Who said women are not barbarous? It is up to you,\" he\nwent on, \"to free your world from its deadly isolation.\"\n\nHe kissed her by the vein in her neck, the heavy one, where the blood\nbeats through. And there flashed through her head the instructions for\nSeduction, Step II, and she wondered that other women had been able to\nremember printed pages when this happened.\n\n\"You must go,\" Juba said, holding him so that he would not. \"What do\nyou want me to do?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe lost his fingers in her hair, \"I like blondes,\" he said. \"And I\nlike a slender waist.\" There was a tension in the muscles of his lower\nlip and his eyes seemed to lengthen, and by this Juba knew what he\nfelt at that moment.\n\nBut he said, \"I want you to switch off your planetary directional\ndiverter. Even if you had let me radio in the coordinates I had they\nwould have been wrong, wouldn't they?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Juba said. \"But the directional diverter diverts only in\ncertain patterns, so that it might be possible to figure out....\"\n\n\"I know. Maybe and maybe not. I want you to turn it off long enough\nfor me to get up beyond your whole system and have my instruments take\na fix on your orbit. Then we can planet in blind, if necessary, to set\nup our station.\"\n\n\"But as soon as you take off,\" Juba said, wondering if she would\nreally do such a thing or if she would suddenly wake as from a dream\nand find her wits again, \"they'll be on me with their questions. And\nwhat could I say to them?\"\n\n\"You won't have to say anything to them,\" the Man said. \"You'll be on\nthe ship with me.\"\n\n\"With _you_!\" The thought went all through Juba, as ice water does\nsometimes, and bubbled up into her ears. \"With you.\" When she looked\nat him she really couldn't see what he looked like any more. Only a\nsort of shine. \"You mean you'll take me away with you?\"\n\n\"Do you think I could leave you?\" he asked, all shiny. \"Smash the\nthing,\" he said. \"They'll repair it, but by that time it'll be too\nlate.\"\n\nShe sat down on the moss, and he was over her, his face urgent, as for\nStep III. But he said, \"Go ahead. Go now. And hurry.\"\n\nShe got up hastily, planning in her mind how she would arrange her\nface, so as to appear calm if anyone should see her and what excuses\nshe would make if there were anyone about the Machine House. They had\nno guards and kept no watches, for why should they?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was at the market place, near the fish stalls, that she met her\nmother.\n\nThe mother tugged at Juba's robe as she went by. \"It is not easy for\nyou, is it?\" she asked, low, so that no one could hear.\n\n\"No,\" the girl said. \"It is not easy.\" Was it not written all over\nher? Was it not on her breath and shaken out of her hair?\n\nThe mother looked closely at Juba and felt at her forehead. \"Perhaps\nit is forcing you too soon,\" she said with a hesitant frown which for\na moment made her look like someone else. \"It is not too late, Juba,\nto get someone else. Even now....\"\n\n\"It is too late,\" Juba said, and pulled away, afraid to talk more. But\nalthough the mother's face, Juba knew, was set, and her mind winding\nunhappily through surmises, she would not follow the girl, out of\npride.\n\nPride.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe machine was alone. Juba cut it off and pulled the handle of the\nswitch out. She then opened up the face plate and jerked out all the\nwires in sight. She reached in and broke off all the fine points of\nthe compass settings and pulled out everything loose she could reach.\n\nThen she walked back quickly through the market place, so as not to\nseem to be skulking.\n\n\"Juba ...\" the mother said, standing in her path.\n\n\"Later,\" Juba said. \"It will soon be done. Mother ... I love you. All\nof you.\" And she went around the mother, quickly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"It is done,\" Juba said, giving him the switch key as though it meant\nsomething all by itself. \"You have at least several hours, even if\nthey find out at this moment. And they won't. There will be no real\nsuspicion until your ... our ship takes off.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter he had made love to Juba, she could see the sun was wheeling\nhigh, and in the temple they would begin to wonder a little. \"We must\nhurry,\" she said, and she broke a budded branch off a laesa bush, so\nthat later, when everything was strange, this bit of what she had been\nwould be with her to surprise her. In strange places, but with this\nman.\n\nShe turned to smile at him, for her heart was full of love, and she\nfelt that he was as much within her as he was within himself.\n\nIt was then that he grabbed her hands and tied them, and he tied her\nfeet, and he lit a cigarette and stood for a moment, looking at her\nand laughing a little with his eyes.\n\nJuba's mind was dark, very dark, as dimness after bright sunlight in\nthe eyes. She spoke to him with her brows, afraid to ask out loud why\nhe had done this, though there could be only one reason.\n\n\"Thanks,\" he said, \"for all of it.\" Then, seeing her tears, he said,\n\"Well, really, what did you expect?\"\n\nThere was a sharp stone beneath her shoulder, and she moved against\nit, so that it would cut through her pain. And, feeling the blood warm\non her skin her tears stopped, for it was the stone that had hurt her,\nand not the Man.\n\n\"You act,\" she said with a sneer, \"as I would expect a man to act.\"\n\n\"And you,\" he said, walking off with his heavy steps, \"have very\nkindly acted as I would expect a woman to act.\"\n\nThus it was that she opened her veins on the sharp rock. Not out of\nlove. Not out of sorrow. Not even out of fear. Out of pride.\n\nTHE END\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Step IV, by Rosel George Brown\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK STEP IV ***\n\n***** This file should be named 30884.txt or 30884.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/0/8/8/30884/\n\nProduced by Sankar Viswanathan, Greg Weeks, and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
