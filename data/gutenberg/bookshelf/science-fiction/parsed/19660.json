Someone--or something--is on the way to supreme\npower over all the planets held by Man.\n\nAnd the Inter-stellar Corps is helpless to meet the threat--no normal\nman can hope to penetrate the conspiracy.\n\nBut--the Corps has a man who isn't normal, a man with a very strange\nweapon...\n\n..._his mind_.\n\nExciting! Strange! Extraordinary! One of the most unusual science\nfiction adventures ever published.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\n\nCadet George Hanlon stood stiffly at attention. But as the long, long\nminutes dragged on and on, he found his hands, his spine and his\nforehead cold with the sweat of fear. He tried manfully to keep his eyes\nfixed steadily on that emotionless face before him, but found it almost\nimpossible to do so.\n\nTension grew and grew and grew in the room until it seemed the very\nwalls must bulge, or the windows burst to relieve the pressure. The\ncadet felt he could not stand another minute of it without screaming.\nWhy didn't that monster say something? What kind of torture was this,\nanyway? And why was he here in the first place? He couldn't think of a\nsingle reg he had broken--yet why else would he be called before Admiral\nRogers, the dread Commandant of Cadets?\n\nIn spite of his utmost efforts to stand eye to eye with the commandant,\nHanlon couldn't keep his gaze steadily on that feared visage. His eyes\ninsisted on straying, time after time, although he always forced them\nback. He caught glimpses of the dozens of communicator studs and plates\non the huge metal desk. He saw the bit of scenery showing through the\nwindow. He noted the pictures of great Corps heroes that adorned the\nwalls. In fact, he had to look at anything except those boring,\nimpassive eyes fixed so steadily on his own face. If only he could gain\nsuch perfect control of his nerves. If only he knew what this was all\nabout!\n\nBy the big wall chronom he saw he had already been standing there at\nrigid attention a full five minutes. The second hand crept around again.\nSix minutes! It dragged slowly around once again. Seven minutes.\n\nThen the unbearable silence was mercifully broken by the admiral's\nvoice.\n\n\"In some ways, Mister, you're quite a stupid young man,\" he said. \"I'm\ninclined to be disappointed in you.\"\n\nHanlon gave a start of surprise, and forced himself to scrutinize more\ncarefully that enigmatic face.\n\n\"What ... what do you mean, sir?\"\n\nThe stern eyes were still boring into his. But now the cadet thought he\ncould detect a trace of secret amusement behind them.\n\n\"Why do you torture yourself like this? You know how to find out what\nit's all about.\"\n\nThere was a sinking feeling in George Hanlon's mind. Did that mean what\nhe was afraid it meant?\n\nHe sent out a tentative feeler of thought toward the mind behind that\nexpressionless face. He expected to find it difficult to do, because of\nlong disuse of the faculty. But he was amazed both at the ease with\nwhich the technique returned to him, and with the feeling of warm\nfriendliness he found in that mind--almost like a sort of fatherly\npride.\n\nHe probed a bit deeper, and was aware of assurance that he had done\nnothing to merit punishment. Indeed, it seemed he could catch exactly\nthe opposite feeling.\n\nHe must have shown his relief, for the commandant's stern face relaxed\ninto a broad smile, and he lounged back in his big chair.\n\n\"That's better. At ease, and sit down.\"\n\nSlowly, disbelieving the sudden change, the astonished young cadet\ngingerly sank onto the front edge of a chair. He had to, his legs were\nsuddenly rubbery.\n\n\"I ... I don't understand at all, sir.\"\n\nThe admiral leaned forward and spoke impressively. \"Do you think, Cadet\nHanlon, that we would let any man get to within weeks of graduation\nwithout knowing all about him?\"\n\nThe young man's eyes widened, and his hands clutched at his knees in an\neffort to keep them from shaking.\n\n\"Oh, yes, we know all about you, George Spencer Newton Hanlon,\" and the\ncadet's eyes opened even wider at that name. \"We know about your talent\nfor mind-reading as a child, and how you suppressed it as you grew older\nand found how it got you into trouble. We know all about your father's\ndisgrace and disappearance; your mother's death; your running away, and\nyour adoption by the Hanlons, whose last name you assumed.\"\n\n\"How ... how'd you learn all that, sir?\"\n\n\"The Corps has its ways. And that's why you're here now. Oh, all the\nFifth Year Cadets will be interviewed by myself or my assistants this\ncoming week, to determine their first assignment after graduation. But I\ncalled you in today for a very, very special reason. And your ability to\nread minds is part of it.\"\n\nThe cadet drew himself up stiffly. \"I'm through with all that, sir,\ndefinitely!\"\n\nThe commandant regarded him enigmatically for a moment. \"Just what do\nyou expect to do in the Corps, Mister?\"\n\n\"Why, whatever I'm assigned to do, I suppose, sir. Or whatever I can\ndo.\"\n\n\"And just how far will you go for the Corps?\" The admiral leaned forward\nand eyed him critically.\n\n\"All the way, sir, of course.\"\n\n\"Don't you believe a Corpsman should use all his abilities in his\nservice?\" The question was barked at him.\n\n\"Certainly, sir.\" But his eyes showed he realized he had been trapped by\nthat admission.\n\n\"You're one of the few persons known who have ever actually been able to\nread another's mind. That's important--very important--to the Corps. _It\nmust be used!_\"\n\nHanlon's eyes were still stormy, but he kept his lips tightly closed.\n\nThe commandant's face grew kindly again. \"We know how it got you into\ntrouble when you were a boy, because the other children resented it, and\navoided or abused you for using it on them. But now it will be a great\nassistance to you--and to the Corps. We know you will use that talent\nwisely, for it has been proven time and again, by test after test, that\nyou are scrupulously honest. You've lost your allowance several times in\ncard games, when you could have read what cards your opponents held, and\nso won. You have let yourself fail on examination questions you did not\nknow, when you could have read the answers in your instructor's mind.\"\n\n\"No, not that, sir,\" Hanlon shook his head. \"I never could read from a\nmind such specific information as answers to questions or to problems.\"\n\n\"I imagine that will come when you start using your talent maturely,\"\nAdmiral Rogers shrugged indifferently. \"But at the moment I want to talk\nvery seriously about your assignment. First, however, I must have your\nmost solemn oath never to reveal what I am about to tell you, for it is\nour most carefully-guarded secret.\"\n\n\"I swear by my mother's memory, sir, never to reveal anything I am told\nto keep confidential.\"\n\n\"Very well. I have been delegated by the High Command to ask you to join\nthe Secret Service of the Inter-stellar Corps.\"\n\nCadet George Hanlon drew in a sharp, startled breath and half-rose from\nhis chair. \"The ... the Secret Service, sir? I didn't know there was\none.\"\n\n\"I told you it was top secret,\" Admiral Rogers said impressively. \"We\nbelieve no one knows anything about its existence outside of the\nmembership of that service, and officers of the rank of Rear Admiral or\nabove.\"\n\nThe young cadet sat silent, his eyes on the tips of his polished boots,\nas though to see reflected there the answer to this astounding new\nsituation that had been slapped into his consciousness.\n\nThis was all so utterly unforeseen. He had dreamed of doing great deeds\nin the Corps, of course, but actually had never expected to be assigned\nto anything but routine work at first. His mind was a chaotic whirlpool\nof conjectures. How could he fit into such an organization? Why had he\nbeen selected? Surely, the fact that as a child he was supposed to have\nbeen a mind-reader wasn't enough ... or was it, from their standpoint?\n\nAfter some time he looked up. \"I don't know as I'd make a very good\ndetective, sir.\"\n\nAdmiral Rogers threw back his head and laughed, breaking the tension. \"I\nthink, and so do the top men of the Secret Service, who have studied you\nthoroughly, that you will soon become one of its most useful members.\"\n\nThat was another shock, but out of it grew determination.\n\n\"Very well, sir, I'll try it.\"\n\n\"Good! But not 'try it,' Hanlon. Once you're in, it's for life. And\nthere's one other thing I haven't told you yet. I couldn't, until after\nyou had agreed to join. This may make you change your mind, which you\nare still at liberty to do.\"\n\nThe cadet's throat tightened, and he moistened his lips as he saw the\nadmiral's face grow ominous.\n\n\"I want you to consider this very seriously,\" he said slowly, grimly,\nand Hanlon's probing mind caught the aura of importance in his manner.\n\"Take your time, and figure carefully all the angles and connotations\ninherent in it, for it will not be an easy decision to make.\"\n\nHe paused impressively. \"Here it is, cold! You'll have to be,\napparently, dismissed from the Corps in disgrace. That is horribly\nharsh, we know,\" he added quickly, compassionately, as he saw the look\nof dismay that whitened the cadet's face. \"But we have found over the\nyears that it is the best way to make members of the SS most valuable to\nus. Every one of them has gone through the same thing, if that is any\nencouragement or consolation.\"\n\nYoung Hanlon's spirits sank to absolute nadir. \"Not ... not even\ngraduate?\" he whispered, agonizedly.\n\n\"Not publicly, with your class, no. But you'll be given private\ngraduation, for you'll still be a member of the Corps.\"\n\nHe was silent again to allow the young man to recover a bit, then\ncontinued in a fatherly voice. \"We know it's a terrible price to ask any\nman to pay. It takes guts to withstand, publicly and willingly, the\ndishonor, the loss of friends and the good will of people who know you.\nIt means life-long disgrace in the eyes of the public and those members\nof the Corps who have ever known you or will hear of you.\"\n\nThe blood drained from Hanlon's face, his breathing was quick and\nrasping. The admiral's heart went out to him in sympathy, but he had to\nkeep on. Now, though, he tried to soften the blow.\n\n\"Yet there are rewards in honor from those who do know. There will come\na deep satisfaction from the years of devoting your life and abilities\nto the tremendous service of maintaining peace and security for all\nmankind of the entire Federation of Planets. Actually, the SS does more\nto keep that peace than all the rest of the Corps. So these things are,\nin the estimation of those who have gone through it, well worth any pain\nand humiliation they have to suffer.\"\n\nHis tone was so kind that Hanlon found a measure of comfort in the looks\nand attitude of the officer before him, now suddenly not a dread ogre,\nand martinet, but a kindly, fatherly, understanding friend.\n\nGeorge Hanlon sat with downcast eyes, thinking swiftly but more cogently\nthan he had ever done before. He had come into this room still a boy\ndespite his twenty-two years. Now, abruptly, he was roughly forced into\nmanhood.\n\nAs such an adult, then, he quickly realized this was the crucial point\nin his life to date--probably in all the years to come. But to lose the\nrespect and friendship of everyone he knew--he shuddered. To be\ndespised, an outcast!\n\nYet Admiral Rogers said all the SS men had gone through it, and now felt\nit worth all the pain and disgrace, to be able to do the work they were\ndoing.\n\nHe had been trained all his life, and especially in Corps school, to\nscan all available data for and against each problem that arose, and\nthen make a decision quickly and intelligently.\n\nHe rose to his feet and straightened determinedly. \"I'll still take it\non, sir, if you and the general staff think I'm worthy and will be\nuseful.\"\n\nThe admiral rose swiftly and came around the desk to grasp the cadet's\nhands in both of his. \"I'm proud of you, my boy. It took real strength\nof character to make that decision. I'm sure you will never regret it,\nthough there'll be moments when it will hurt to the pit of your soul,\nespecially the first few days.\"\n\nThe cadet's eyes clouded again, and he shivered convulsively. \"That\npart's got me in a blue funk, no fooling. Do you suppose I can take it,\nand not give the show away?\"\n\nAgain the commandant's hearty, friendly laugh boomed out, filling the\noffice with merriment and honest pride. \"By Snyder, you will, Son, like\na thoroughbred!\" He went back behind that great desk, and was suddenly\nonce more the strict disciplinarian. \"Cadet Hanlon, 'ten-shun!\" he\nbarked.\n\nThe young man stood rigid.\n\n\"Raise your right hand. Do you swear before the Infinite Essence to\nuphold, with all your abilities, the Inter-Stellar Corps, and the laws\nand decisions of the Federated Planets?\"\n\n\"On my honor, sir, and with God's help, I pledge allegiance to the\nInter-Stellar Corps and to the people and governments of all the\nFederated Planets!\"\n\nHanlon came to a punctilious salute, which Admiral Rogers returned as\nprecisely before resuming his seat.\n\n\"Senior Lieutenant George Hanlon, at ease.\"\n\nHe grinned companionably at the young man's start of surprise.\n\"Promotions are swift in the Secret Service, Hanlon. Now, go through\nthat door. There you'll meet your immediate superior officer, who will\ngive you instructions. And Hanlon, my sincerest personal good wishes.\nSafe flights, Lieutenant.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir, for everything.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\n\nSenior Lieutenant George Hanlon opened the designated door and stepped\nthrough into the next office. A grey-haired man, wearing the Twin Comets\nof a Regional Admiral, was sitting behind a desk, studying some papers.\nHe continued sitting thus, the papers held so they hid his face,\napparently so intent on his work he had not noticed anyone entering.\n\nBut Hanlon instinctively knew better, and stood stiffly at attention,\nawaiting the other's pleasure. Soon the man lowered the papers ... and\nHanlon gasped,\n\n\"Da...\". His mouth snapped shut, and his eyes became swiftly hostile at\nremembrance of the hate he had carried all these years on account of\nthis man. He wanted to stalk out, but ingrained discipline chained him\nto the spot. His voice, though, was very cold when he spoke. \"Senior\nLieutenant George Hanlon reporting, sir.\"\n\nThe big man was a startling older edition of the newly-appointed\nlieutenant, only grey where the latter was blond, assured from long,\nbitter experience where the other was as yet untried. Now he rose to his\nfeet, acknowledging the salute.\n\n\"At ease. I can imagine your surprise at seeing me,\" and if there was a\nhurt look on his face at sight of that implacable hatred in his son's\neyes and demeanor, he could not be blamed. \"However, I think your\nexperience of the past hour might have prepared you for sight of me in\nuniform. Yes,\" as he saw the sudden surprise in the young man's eyes,\n\"that was the reason for my apparent disgrace. I hope you will forgive\nme, now that you know why it was necessary.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" stiffly punctilious, \"only,\" his eyes were still hard and\nstormy, \"was it important enough to break mother's heart?\"\n\nThe older man's voice grew soft and shook with genuine emotion. \"You and\neveryone had to believe that, Spence, all these years. I've been\nprayerfully waiting for the day when I could explain to you. I can\nassure you, Son,\" with all the sincerity his voice could carry, \"that\nshe did not die of a broken ...\"\n\n\"I know bet ...\"\n\n\"You do not know better!\" his father interrupted sternly. \"Please wait\nuntil I finish explaining. No, Spence,\" his voice was still, emphatic\nbut softer now, almost pleading. \"She knew and approved. Your mother was\none of Earth's greatest heroines.\"\n\nHanlon was still standing stiffly, but now his eyes clouded with mixed\nemotions, of which doubt predominated. His mind touched that of his\nfather, and he seemed to read truth there. But could he believe this\nnow ... after all those dreadful years?\n\n\"Actually,\" his father was continuing, \"your mother had become a victim\nof multiple sclerosis. When we knew she had less than two months to\nlive, I talked to her, with the Corps' permission, about my going into\nSecret Service work. With her death so near, it could be done\nconvincingly. Believing you would understand some day, and approve, she\nagreed. I'm terribly sorry for all you've had to suffer during the\nintervening years. Again I beg forgiveness.\"\n\nAs his father talked, Hanlon's eyes and heart gradually lost their\nhardness, and at the end he ran forward and grasped the other's hands.\n\n\"Oh, Dad, I'm so sorry. I've hated hating you. If it hadn't been for the\nlong talks Pa and Ma Hanlon had with me, I don't believe I would ever\nhave gone into the cadet school.\"\n\nThe older man hugged his son hungrily.\n\n\"Believe me, Spence, it wasn't easy for me, either. But I didn't\nactually desert you, even though it had to seem so. I know everywhere\nyou've been, everything you've done. You've been watched over\nconstantly. I engineered your adoption by the Hanlons--he was a retired\nCorpsman, you know--and I've paid your expenses. You see, I happen to\nlove my son very much.\"\n\n\"And I loved my Dad so, too. That's why it hurt ... say, now I can\nchange my name back, can't I? The Hanlons both died since I started\ncadet school, you know.\"\n\n\"Well ... no, for the time being I think not. You're well known as\n'Hanlon' now, and you'd better leave it that way, for now, at least.\nHowever, you'll find need of an alias from time to time in this new\njob--you can use it then. I certainly will be proud to have you wearing\nmy name again.\"\n\nBut both men were shying away from all this frank expression of their\nemotion, and Hanlon dropped back a pace.\n\n\"How does it happen I've never seen you around the buildings or grounds\nhere?\"\n\n\"No one ever sees me in uniform, except in this or some other Base\noffice on special occasions. Outside, I'm always disguised. When I come\ninto a Reservation I'm a bearded janitor or something. You'll soon learn\nabout disguising, yourself.\"\n\nThen he became all business, and his face sobered as he went back to his\ndesk.\n\n\"Sit there, Lieutenant. There's a lot to tell you, and you are to pay\nstrict attention and get it all in this one interview, for there can't\nbe another at this time. It would attract too much attention for you to\nbe called here more than this once.\"\n\nHe smiled again, with a warm, fatherly pride. \"First, let me\ncongratulate you, officially on your decision, and to welcome you\nsincerely into the Secret Service.\"\n\nHanlon bowed in acknowledgement, then sat down and leaned forward\nattentively. \"I'll try to get it all, sir.\"\n\n\"First, the matter of your dismissal. It will come some time within the\nnext few days, but even I won't know ahead of time when or how it will\nhappen. Some SS man unknown on Terra will be called in to attend to it.\nBut when it does come you will recognize it almost instantly, and you\nmust play it up big. Don't let on in any way that you suspect or know it\nis anything but genuine. You must impress on your fellow students, and\nupon everyone else you know or later come to know, that it was real, and\nthat it has soured you for all time on the Corps, and on all law and\norder and government.\"\n\nThe young man nodded, but said nothing, for his throat was clogged and\nhis spirits quailing at thought of that public disgrace. He had been so\nproud here ... how could he possibly stand giving it all up? Maybe he\nwas a fool ever to have agreed.\n\nBut the admiral was continuing. He shoved a sheaf of bills across the\ndesk. \"Here's a thousand credits. Use them to buy your civilian clothes\nand kit after your dismissal. Buy a few shares of some stock, too--the\namount or value doesn't matter. Get a small insurance policy. Yes,\"\nseeing his son's questioning look, \"there's a reason.\n\n\"After you get your clothing and things and have discarded your uniform,\ngo rent a hotel room, then go to the Inter-Stellar bank and rent a\nsafety deposit box. That's one of the first things you do in each city\non any planet to which you may be sent on assignment. Now, here are two\nkeys that fit box number 1044 in all the I-S banks. They are special\nmaster keys of our own designing. Box 1044 is used because of its\nnearness to those private booths, in the universal set-up all I-S banks\nuse. That box is our means of confidential communication.\n\n\"After you get into the vault ostensibly to get into your own box, use\nthese to open box 1044. There's a little electronic gadget in each box\n1044. When you want immediate service on anything you put into the box,\npress the red button on the mechanism. Go back a few hours later and it\nwill have been attended to. So now, when you get into the bank, put a\nnote there listing your hotel room number and also your new deposit key\nnumber. Come back in a couple of hours and you'll find a key that will\nhave your box number stamped on it, but which will open both boxes. Then\nleave your old key and one of these in 1044, and carry the other and the\nnew one.\"\n\n\"Oh, I see. The stock and insurance policy in my own box are decoys,\neh?\"\n\n\"Right. You put all your reports in box 1044, and get your orders there.\nWe all use 1044, so just sort through the envelopes for any with your\nname on them. The same key also locks the sound-proof and spyray-proof\ncubicle in the vault, so no one, not even another SS man, can interrupt\nyou unless you want to let them in.\"\n\n\"My own box for decoy; 1044 for service matters; key fits both boxes and\ncubicles; red button for quick service. Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"When you get to a new city or planet, put your local address there as\nsoon as feasible. That's your one sure contact. Also, in each box you'll\nfind quite a lot of money at all times. You take what you need for\nexpenses and get your salary that way. If your job calls for more than\nis in the box at any time, leave a request and press the red button.\nMore will be brought immediately.\"\n\n\"That's quite a trust, sir,\" Hanlon gulped. \"I hope I'll always use it\nwisely.\"\n\nHis father nodded and smiled. \"You will, Spence. We wouldn't have asked\nyou to join us if we weren't sure. As your father, I'm mighty proud to\nhave you for a son. As Assistant Chief of the SS, I feel sure you'll be\na credit to us.\n\n\"Now,\" all business again, \"a sleep instructor and some reels of the\nlanguage and other information about Simonides Four will be delivered to\nyour hotel room. Simonides Four is your first assignment. There's\nsomething fishy going on there we haven't been able to find out about,\nbut we think you can get us some good leads.\n\n\"Don't try to handle it alone--just get us information. And, son, use\nyour talent for reading minds. I heard over the intercom all you said to\nRogers, and while that wasn't the only reason you were asked into the\nSS, believe me, it will be tremendously important in your work with\nus--it'll help us where no other agent can get to first check station.\nAnd I have a feeling, too, that you'll develop both that and many other\nmental abilities once your mind starts to hit the ball. You'll find in\nthis work every single talent and ability you can develop will be useful\nand needed.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Hanlon nodded slowly, \"I'm beginning to realize that. I'll\npractice a lot.\"\n\n\"As for money, don't be niggardly--spend what you like and always carry\nquite a bit with you for emergencies. Live well, although not\nextravagantly unless the occasion of your work demands it. Not to save\nmoney, but to remain as inconspicuous as possible.\"\n\n\"The Service has it all thought out, hasn't it?\" Admiration shone in the\nyoung lieutenant's eyes.\n\n\"They've had a lot of years for it, Spence. Now, there's another means\nof contact, for cases of emergency. Get word to, or an interview with,\nany officer of the rank of Rear Admiral or above. The words 'Andromeda\nSeven' are the passwords to let him know who and what you are. Once\nyou've made that contact, commandeer anything or any service needed to\nassist your work.\"\n\n\"I understand, sir.\" Hanlon strained to review all this new knowledge\nquickly. Then, \"I'm sure I have it all. Get civilian kit; hotel room;\nstocks and insurance; deposit boxes--my own and 1044; sleep-learn\nSimonidean; 'Andromeda Seven'.\"\n\n\"Correct. Now, you'll be interested in a little of the background of the\nSecret Service. It was John Snyder himself who organized it, shortly\nafter the formation of the Snyder Patrol. He realized almost at once\nthat such an unknown, undercover echelon would be a must. There's\nusually not more than two hundred of us. New members are taken in only\nas replacements, or when some Corpsman with a special ability, such as\nyour mind-reading, is discovered.\n\n\"We work anywhere throughout space when there's a need, but there are\nusually one or two of us on each planet of the Federation at all times.\nWhen not on any special assignment we keep busy on some planet not our\noriginal home, checking the background of cadets or especially-appointed\ngovernment workers, guarding VIP's, and such other vital matters. But\nwhatever we are, or whatever we are doing, we _are_ the Corps!\n\n\"We are mighty proud of the fact that no SS man has ever betrayed\nhis trust, even to save his life. Our work is dangerous in the\nextreme, but without exception we are all men with high mental\nability--quick-thinking, clever, and unusually adept at getting out of\nscrapes.\" He grimaced mirthlessly. \"We learn that last mighty quick in\nthis business ... if we last.\n\n\"And to all of us, our dangerous, unadvertised, publicly unrecognized\nwork is personally highly satisfying. We know we are the guardians of\nthe peace of the Federation, even though we get no hero-worship from the\npopulace who don't know we exist.\"\n\nHanlon nodded slowly, thoughtfully. \"One thing puzzles me, Dad. You and\nAdmiral Rogers both spoke about how secret all this is, yet I was given\nthe chance to back out after I knew about it.\"\n\nHis father grinned. \"Several have, over the years. They underwent\ntreatment to erase that knowledge from their mind.\" He stood up and came\naround the desk to where his son had also risen. \"I may not see you\nagain before you leave, Spence ... George, I mean,\" he smiled ruefully,\nthen brightened. \"But the best of luck, son, and keep in mind that you\nhave the honor of the finest body of men in the Universe in your\nkeeping, and always try to be worthy of the trust.\"\n\n\"I will, sir,\" gravely. \"It seems almost too much responsibility for a\ncub like me, and I'm scared. But I'll do my best.\"\n\n\"Take it easy at first. Don't try too much, and don't put yourself in\nany more danger than you have to until you learn the ropes, which you\nwill, faster than you may now think. On this assignment, all we ask is\nthat you try to get us some leads we can work on.\"\n\n\"Right! I don't want to conk out too soon, now. I've got a lot of living\nI want to do first, especially now I've got my dad back again. I sure\nhope we manage to see each other fairly often.\"\n\n\"Oh, we undoubtedly will, except when one or the other of us is on a\nlong job. We'll meet--somewhere--quite often.\"\n\n\"About this assignment of mine, Dad. Can you give me any dope on it?\"\n\n\"You'll get what any of us know, from the reels, and the latest\ndevelopment from the box when you're ready to start out. Oh, yes, I\nalmost forgot. The paper we use is a digestible plastic, so make a meal\noff all orders and confidential communications you receive. The box\nalways contains a supply for your reports or requests for specific\ninformation or assistance.\"\n\n\"Saves money on feed bills, eh?\"\n\nHis father grinned appreciatively, then sobered. \"Make sure you\nunderstand each step you take first, and don't try to run until you know\nhow to crawl. Well, safe flights, Spence.\"\n\n\"Safe flights to you, too, Dad, always. And I want you to know I'm so\nglad to have all those horrible misunderstandings and hates cleared\naway.\"\n\n\"I missed my boy, too. But 'vast rewards', you know.\"\n\nWith mixed sensations of high elation and worried fear, the\nswiftly-maturing young Corpsman walked slowly through the beautiful park\nthat surrounded the great stainless-steel skyscraper that housed the\ncadets during their training period. His thoughts were as twisted as\nwere the meandering paths and walks he trod so unseeingly.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\n\nAs Hanlon entered his dormitory room, his roommate looked up from his\nstudies.\n\n\"What'd the Big Brass Bull want, Han?\"\n\n\"Huh?\" Hanlon snapped out of his abstraction and grinned. \"Nothing\nimportant. You'll be up soon. Just about our first assignments after\ngraduation.\" He was thinking swiftly. \"... Uh, I get some extra\ninstruction in piloting, and a chance at the controls.\"\n\n\"Gee, I hope they let me work on codes.\"\n\nHanlon shrugged. \"They probably will, Dick. They try to fit us where we\ncan do the most good, Rogers said.\" He picked up a book and sat down,\napparently studying intently, and young Trowbridge resumed his own\nlessons.\n\nHanlon began practicing his mind-reading at every opportunity. At first\nhe felt sure he would be caught at it, but quickly remembered that, as a\nchild, his victims never suspected they were being mentally invaded\nunless he told them or acted carelessly upon information so gleaned.\n\nYet it had been his naive, boyish pride then, that had made him boast to\nhis playmates of his ability, and prove it by telling them things he had\nlearned about them. All that, naturally, got him into much trouble and\nnot a few fights, and caused the loss of all his early boyhood friends.\nThat was why he had quit using his wild talent and had been so\ndetermined never to do so again, as he had first told Admiral Rogers.\n\nBut now he realized he must use it with all the ability and skill he\ncould acquire. For this mind-reading, whatever of it he could do, was\ndecidedly his dish. The SS would be sure to hand him all the jobs where\nit might best get them what they needed--if he showed he could produce.\n\nYet with his present equipment Hanlon knew he could do little. As he had\nalso told the commandant, he couldn't actually read anyone's mind to the\nextent of getting definite wording or specific information. But he could\nget quite clear sensory impressions that helped him deduce what the\nother person was thinking.\n\nHe had partially learned--and now practiced with all his abilities and\ngained knowledge and intellect to improve and perfect the technique--to\ngauge the other's looks, glances, facial expressions, muscle movements,\nsudden tensenesses, and so on. For those, together with the\nmood-impressions and bits of fleeting thoughts, enabled him to know\nalmost to a certainty what the other was actually thinking at the\nobserved time.\n\nIn the barracks, later that first evening, he got into a card game and\nconcentrated on trying to win by this method. Nor was it consciously\nthat he chose a game being played for low stakes--he just wouldn't have\nthought of trying to win large sums by such \"cheating\".\n\nFor some time he won consistently and easily. He couldn't know what\ncards his opponents held, by suit or number, but he could tell without\nany difficulty whether each of the other players felt he had a poor,\nmedium or good hand. By playing his own accordingly, his wins were far\ngreater than his losses. After an hour or so of play had proved he could\ndo it, and had given him considerable practice, Hanlon closed his mind\nto their impressions. He now played his cards so recklessly he soon lost\nhis winnings. Then he got out of the game on a plea of having to study.\n\nThe next morning during first class, the door opened and Admiral Rogers\nentered the classroom.\n\n\"'Ten-shun!\" the teacher called, springing to his feet.\n\n\"As you were. I want to borrow one of your young gentlemen for the day,\nMajor. A VIP is in town, and we want to give him an aide.\" He looked\nabout the room, as though to pick out a likely-looking candidate. \"How\nabout Cadet Hanlon? Does he especially need today's lesson?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, sir, he's one of our top students.\"\n\nAdmiral Rogers looked directly at Hanlon, who had risen to attention\nwhen his name was mentioned. \"In my office, in full dress uniform, on\nthe double.\"\n\n\"Dismiss, Hanlon,\" the instructor said, and the cadet ran out.\n\nIn Admiral Rogers' office ten minutes later, Hanlon received his\ninstructions. \"Report to the Simonidean Embassy and put yourself at the\ndisposal of Hector Abrams, First Secretary to the Simonidean Prime\nMinister. But first, hang this stuff on you. This dress sword is a\nlittle unusual--the scabbard is rounder than yours, but not noticeably\nso. It's really a blaster; the trigger is here on the handle as you\ngrasp it. Put on these aide's aguillettes--the metal tips are police\nwhistles. No,\" seeing Hanlon's questioning look, \"we don't expect any\ntrouble today--these are just routine, for we like to be ready for\nemergencies.\"\n\nHanlon fastened the braided cords to his shoulder tabs, and belted on\nthe twenty-inch-long blaster-sword. The admiral touched a switch on his\ndesk and spoke into a microphone. \"My personal car to take Cadet Hanlon\nto the Simonidean Embassy, then return.\"\n\nAt the Embassy, Hanlon reported to the receptionist, and was shown with\ndue deference into one of the private offices, where he was introduced\nto several men, among them the Secretary he was to accompany.\n\n\"I have a number of errands to do today, but the first and most\nimportant is laying the cornerstone of our new Embassy building--this\none is merely rented, you may know.\"\n\n\"I am entirely at your disposal, sir,\" Hanlon saluted crisply, and fell\ninto step just behind the portly statesman as he left the building.\n\nThey rode in an open car with a uniformed chauffeur, the others\nfollowing in other cars. As they rode Hanlon probed the statesman's\nmind, but found only worry-tension, that he shrewdly guessed had to do\nwith the coming speech, rather than with any thought of intrigue or\nillegal machination.\n\nAs they came into the Greek section of the city, their ride took on more\nand more the aspects of a parade, as the Simonidean was recognized.\n\nHanlon opened his mind wide and attempted to analyze the\nthought-sensations he received from the crowds. It was one of gaiety and\ngood nature, and reminded him of the way his boyish mind interpreted the\nthoughts of holiday crowds at the circus, Fourth of July celebrations,\npicnics, and so on.\n\nFrom the moment he first entered the Embassy, Hanlon had been probing\nwith every iota of his ability, hoping he could find some lead to\nwhatever it was that was bothering the Corps about Simonides, but had\nfound nothing sinister or menacing, nor could he get any such sensations\nfrom the crowd.\n\nBut now he concentrated more on watching the increasingly denser throng\nof people, for the car was nearing their destination. The buildings\nalong here were all bedecked with Simonidean and Greek-Terran flags, and\nthere was now a continuous cheering from the populace. Abrams was\nstanding in the back of the car now, smilingly acknowledging their\nplaudits by bowing to one side and the other.\n\nHanlon, sitting stiffly at attention, nevertheless kept his eyes darting\nhere and there, watching as carefully as he could for any possible\nhostile demonstrations or menacing figures.\n\nArrived at the building site, Abrams was greeted by numerous\ndignitaries, and escorted with much pomp to the flag-bedecked stand,\namid greater cheering from the assembled crowd.\n\nThe chairman of the occasion stepped to the public-address microphone,\nand raised his hands for silence. The band broke off in the middle of a\nnumber, the cheering from the huge throng gradually died down, and the\nceremony got under way.\n\nHanlon, who had taken his post at one corner of the platform, paid scant\nattention to what was happening on it, as it neither interested him nor\ncould he understand too much of it, even though he knew quite a bit of\nGreek. Again his eyes were busy continually looking all about the great\ncrowd and the surroundings.\n\nNothing of note occurred until the chairman began introducing Abrams,\nand then hecklers in the crowd began shouting:\n\n\"Freedom for the Greeks of Simonides!\"\n\n\"Empires are out of date; let the people rule!\"\n\n\"Demos forever!\"\n\nThese calls were few at first, but the men yelling them were\nleather-lunged. The chairman's face turned reddish, and he wavered a bit\nin his speech, then raised his own voice in an attempt to drown out the\ninterruptions.\n\nOthers were now crying out, though still only a few, but in spite of\ntheir shouts the ceremonies continued, and Abrams, properly introduced,\nrose and began his prepared speech.\n\nHanlon, more alert than ever, could see local police shoving through the\ncrowd, trying to apprehend and silence the hecklers. But from his\nvantage point Hanlon saw the latter shifting rapidly from place to\nplace, partly to escape detection, he swiftly deduced, and partly to\nmake it seem as though more and more people were joining in the\ndemonstration.\n\nIn a side glance Hanlon saw that the Secretary was nettled at the\ndisturbance, and his color was high although he bravely continued\nspeaking. The great audience was largely paying attention to him, and\nmust have found him interesting, from their frequent cheers.\n\nSuddenly, at one side, there seemed to be a more determined\ndemonstration, and Hanlon tore his gaze from it, remembering his\ninstructor's words:\n\n\"Disregard specific diversions in one spot! Let the police handle\nthose--you must watch most carefully then for assassins!\"\n\nInstantly he was more alert, more carefully scanning the whole scene\nbefore him, his eyes travelling forth and back.\n\nA glint of reflected sunlight from a nearby roof jerked his eyes upward,\nand at what he saw, with one swift, smooth motion he drew his\nblaster-sword, sighted carefully, and pressed the trigger.\n\nThere was a crack of flame, and a gunman half-hidden behind a chimney\nscreamed, half-rose, then, his body charred by the force of that blast,\ntoppled from the roof into the street below, his rifle falling near him.\nHanlon swivelled. \"Cover Abrams!\" his voice rang out commandingly, and\nhe himself jumped in front of the Secretary while others on the platform\nsprang up to completely surround the Simonidean, and hide him from\npossible further danger.\n\nHanlon raised one of the tassel-whistles and blew a piercing blast. Now\nhe could see several local policemen running toward the platform, and in\nmoments Abrams, surrounded by an armed and alert escort, was hustled\ninto a waiting police car, which sped back to the Embassy.\n\nThe Simonidean was white and shaking, upset by the episode.\n\n\"Why?\" he kept asking, but no one had any answers. \"I'm not important\nenough for anyone to want to kill,\" Abrams shook his head. \"The people\nof Simonides like the empire status--why should anyone here on Terra\nobject?\"\n\n\"There's always crackpots in every crowd,\" a police captain said. \"We\nget riots like this one almost every time there's a public ceremony.\nMost of 'em're plain nuts--once in a while only is there one who feels\nhe's got a real grievance, personal.\"\n\n\"But with so many participating, this one looked planned,\" Hanlon\nobjected. \"I was higher and watching, and I could see at least a dozen\nmen shouting at the beginning, starting all at the same time, although a\nlot more took it up. It must have been a plot of some kind.\"\n\nHis mind was racing. Was this part of what he was being sent to\nSimonides to investigate? He had tried to probe the crowd minds, but\nthere were so many conflicting thought-emanations, such a welter of\nsensations he wasn't able to isolate any single, individual moods or\nthoughts.\n\nSafely back inside the Embassy, Abrams seemed to relax a bit. He turned\nnow to Hanlon.\n\n\"My very sincere thanks, young man, for your quickness and alertness in\nsaving my life. I shall be eternally grateful.\"\n\nHanlon waved his hand deprecatingly. \"It was my job, sir. I'm sorry your\nday was spoiled that way.\"\n\n\"I still can't make out why?\" The Simonidean said slowly, and Hanlon,\nprobing, could sense that his mind was full of question marks. \"I'm not\nthat important. If it had been the emperor\"--Hanlon caught an impression\nof loyalty and love for that dignitary--\"or even the Minister\"--here he\ncaught a feeling of doubt and some dislike--\"it might make sense. Just\nas I cannot figure out why I should have been sent here for this\npurpose. It's almost ...\" he was silent, and Hanlon's probes found only\npuzzlement.\n\n\"Nuts!\" the young Corpsman felt frustrated. \"If only I could really read\nminds! I think this guy knows something I want to learn, but I can't get\nthe least idea of what it is.\"\n\nBut he kept trying, and not only with the mind of this one man he had\nbeen sent here to guard. He reached out to all other minds in the room,\nbut none of them seemed to have any thoughts about the why of this\nunexpected happenstance. There were mostly feelings of anger that their\nbeautiful new Embassy building had not been properly dedicated, and\ntheir ceremony ruined.\n\nAbrams had sunk into a chair, and it soon became apparent to Hanlon that\nhe wasn't planning on handling any of his other outside errands that\nday.\n\n\"Will you want me any more, sir?\" he finally asked after a considerable\nperiod of uneasy fidgetting. The Simonidean broke out of his\nabstraction, and rose to his feet.\n\n\"No, I shall stay here for the balance of the day at least. You may as\nwell return to your other duties. Again, thank you, personally, for\nsaving my life, and please express my thanks to the Corps for sending\nyou. But I still can't understand ...\" He turned away, muttering.\n\nHanlon saluted the other members of the Embassy staff, and rode the\nslideways back to Base, reporting to Admiral Rogers, to whom he gave a\nfull and concise account of all that had happened.\n\n\"Whatever Mr. Abrams and the police may think, I still believe it was\nall carefully planned,\" he concluded thoughtfully. \"It wasn't just one\nman, for I could see at least a dozen. Though, of course,\" he added\nquickly, \"one man may have been behind it.\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly,\" the admiral said. \"There was the chance of something like\nthis, which is why I picked you for the job, hoping you could get some\nleads from it.\"\n\n\"I told you I couldn't read specific thoughts or information,\" Hanlon\nsaid. \"If you and the top brass picked me for the SS because you thought\nI could, you'd better release me from it. I can't work in a crowd at\nall, for there's such a jumble of thought-emanations I can't separate\nthem. Even working with an individual I can only sense something of his\nfeelings. Just as now,\" he grinned mirthlessly, \"you're disappointed\nbecause I didn't get any data, and thinking my so-called mind-reading is\nall a fake.\"\n\nThe admiral almost jumped. \"Why, I am not ...,\" then he looked\nsurprised, and laughed. \"By Snyder, I was, too!\" He sobered. \"But if you\ncan do that, even if you can't actually read the words of the thought,\nyou'll still be able to help, I'm sure. No, you keep on studying. I'll\nbet you'll be able to do a lot more before long.\"\n\n\"I sure hope so,\" Hanlon slowly unfastened the aiguellettes and removed\nthe sword and belt, laying them on the corner of the big desk. At touch\nof that weapon he suddenly realized what he had done with it, and\nshuddered, while his face grew white and strained.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" the admiral asked anxiously.\n\n\"I ... killed ... a ... man,\" Hanlon trembled.\n\n\"No! You killed a snake!\" Admiral Rogers laid his arm comfortingly about\nthe younger man's shoulders. \"It isn't the same at all. Don't let it\nbother you.\"\n\nHanlon tried manfully to rise from his dark mood. \"You're right, in a\nway, sir, and I'll try to look at it that way. As to the mind-reading,\nI'll keep on trying, and I hope I can prove of some use.\"\n\nThe admiral patted his shoulder encouragingly. \"You will. Dismiss.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\n\nThe cadets were all keyed up about graduation, now so near, and most of\nthem were cramming at every opportunity on the subjects in which they\nfelt themselves deficient. Such tenseness is natural before any final\nexaminations, but in their case more so than it would have been in an\nordinary school or university.\n\nFor not until the final marks were posted from these last examinations,\nplus their marks for the entire five years, would any of them--except\nHanlon, of course--know for a surety that he would be graduated and\nbecome a permanent member of the Inter-Stellar Corps. And how intensely\neach of them wanted to belong!\n\nFour days had now passed since George Hanlon's fateful interview with\nthe Commandant of Cadets, and its unexpected outcome. He could hardly\nbelieve, even yet, that he was now actually a member of the unknown\nSecret Service of the Corps.\n\nOnly the great inner joy he knew at the recovery of his once-adored dad,\nand the complete dismissal of all those black hatreds, gave proof that\nit wasn't all a fantastic dream.\n\nHanlon hadn't experienced anything unusual in the cadet routine, and was\ngrowing more and more nervous as to just what was to happen to him. He\nstill shivered every time he thought of that coming, dreaded ordeal. And\nall this waiting, this worrying, this wondering when--it wasn't making\nlife any easier. If only they would get it over and done with!\n\nBut he strove to compose himself for it as best he could, and it was a\nmeasure of his inherent stability that he never let his comrades, even\nhis roommate, see how apprehensive he was.\n\nNow the day had come for the first of their finals. Hanlon never worried\nabout exams, for he had always been near the top of his class. Now,\nespecially, since he was already graduated and a Senior Lieutenant, he\ncould have taken things easily. But pride in his scholarship made him\nanxious as always to do his best.\n\nTheir first examination was History, one of Hanlon's pet subjects, for\nhe loved this story of Mankind, his ups and downs and gradual growth.\n\nWhen the examination papers were handed out and he noted the first\nquestion he smiled. If only they were all that easy.\n\n     _\"Give briefly a resume of the events leading up to the formation\n     of the Inter-Stellar Corps.\"_\n\nHanlon uncapped his writo, and began:\n\n\"In the middle of the Twentieth Century the various governments of Earth\nwere all tending toward either a totalitarian or a welfare-form state.\nMore and more power became vested in the Executive branch; more and more\ncitizens were either working directly for government, or were supported\nby relief funds. Business was, to an increasingly greater extent,\nstifled by over-control. Public debts became a staggering load, and\nworkers had less and less of their income available for living needs.\n\n\"When atomic energy was first released by the United States, in the form\nof a bomb during a war, the military took complete control of it.\nNeither private nor industrial scientists or technicians were allowed to\nexperiment with possibilities of getting power directly from atomic\nfission.\n\n\"In 1958 a young man named Travis Burkett was elected to the United\nStates Congress from California. During his four terms as member of the\nLower House he became increasingly well-known as possessor of one of the\nfinest minds in public life. In 1966 he was advanced to the Senate, and\nsoon became its leading member.\n\n\"In 1976 (prophetic year) he ran for President on the simple platform of\n'give the country back to the people'. His ideas and views so fired the\nminds and hopes of the citizens of America, regimented and ground down\nby the cancerous growth of bureaucracy, that even most of the\nbureaucrats and reliefers joined to elect him by one of the greatest\npluralities ever polled.\n\n\"During his two terms of office, with the help of a Cabinet of men who\nbelieved as he did, he fulfilled his promises. The tremendous power of\nthe Executive was gradually returned to the Legislative, where it\nbelonged. Unnecessary, over-lapping, and duplicated bureaus and agencies\nwere reduced to the minimum. Only persons actually in need were\nsupported from the public purse. Where almost 80% of the citizenry had\nbeen working for or supported by government when he took office, less\nthan 15% were doing so when he retired.\n\n\"Tax restrictions and governmental meddling in industry and business\nwere reduced save for a few necessary safe-guards of minimum-wage and\nmaximum-safety laws. With these restrictions removed, and with control\nof so many vital sciences and technologies taken away from the military,\ninventions took an accelerated up-swing.\n\n\"The peoples of other countries, fired by the realization of what could\nbe done, staged revolutions, happily largely bloodless, and soon,\nworking through the United Nations Council, a United World government\nbecame an actuality, and Burkett one of its first presidents.\n\n\"An American named John Snyder had, years before, secretly worked out a\nsimple and inexpensive method of obtaining practically unlimited power\ndirectly from atomic fission. Now he could legally bring this to the\npublic, and soon homes, public transportation and industry were using\nhis power method.\n\n\"Snyder attracted to him a group of gifted scientists and technicians.\nThese now turned their attention to space flight and Man, the\nInsatiable, began stretching out greedy hands to the Stars.\n\n\"They put a robot rocket on the Moon in less than two years. Their third\nrocket carried two scientists who did not make the return trip--they\nstayed to study and to learn. Five years later the first ship landed on\nMars, and within a decade that planet was largely colonized. So, two\nyears later, was Venus. Another fifteen years saw colonization of most\nof the moons of the outer planets.\n\n\"For, using new techniques and inventions learned from many experiments,\nthe moons and planets were given air, water and warmth as needed.\nAndroid robots, developed by Varney, one of Snyder's scientists, helped\ngreatly in this work, especially one young female android who was a true\ngenius.\n\n\"Then Man reached the Stars ... and the planets of those distant suns.\nIt was here that the now-aged Snyder proved himself again one of the\ngreatest humanitarians ever to have lived. He promulgated the ruling\nthat is still in force:\n\n     _\"'Man must never colonize any planet having inhabitants\n     intelligent enough to show cultural activity and growth'._\n\n\"Controlling all means of transportation between planets as he did,\nbecause he held all the basic patents, Snyder was able to enforce that\nruling. To do so, he organized the 'Snyder Patrol', which later was\ntaken over by the Federated Planets when that organization was formed,\nand became today's Inter-Stellar Corps.\n\n\"Today there are fifty-seven planets colonized by former inhabitants of\nTellus or their descendants from colonized planets. These each have\ntheir own sovereignty and chosen form of government, but are united in a\nloosely-knit Federation which is solely a Court of Arbitration for\nInter-Planetary affairs. The I-S C is the Federation's Investigation and\nEnforcement branch, not a governing or military patrol.\"\n\nHanlon had finished that question and the second, which asked for the\ndates of the war between the colonists of Mars and those of the Jovian\nsatellites. He was resting his eyes by glancing unseeingly about the\nroom momentarily before starting the third question, when he heard the\nloud, angry voice of the instructor in charge.\n\n\"Cadet Hanlon, on your feet, sir! Just how, Mister, do you think you can\nget away with cheating at a final examination?\"\n\nHanlon's head jerked up and his face went dead-white as the blood\ndrained from it. He stumbled to his feet and, conscious of the amazed\nexpressions of his classmates, looked up at the teacher.\n\n\"Bu ... but I don't understand, sir. I wasn't cheating.\"\n\n\"Don't lie to me!\" the voice was a whiplash. \"I distinctly saw you\nlooking at Cadet Fox's paper. The idea of any cadet, this close to\ngraduation, trying such a contemptible thing!\"\n\nHanlon's bewilderment was changing to anger at such an unjust\naccusation, when suddenly a thought struck him ...\n\n_This was it!_\n\nCheating at examinations always meant expulsion and disgrace.\n\nHe had all he could do to keep from betraying himself as he probed\nquickly toward the mind on the rostrum. Now he perceived the feeling of\ncommiseration which the stern, hot eyes of the apparently outraged\ninstructor did not reveal.\n\nHanlon remembered his father's instructions to \"play it up big\". He made\nhimself glare back at the teacher, and his blue eyes took on the\nhardness of glacial ice.\n\n\"You're making a colossal mistake, sir,\" his voice was louder and\nangrier than it should ever have been. \"If our regular instructor was\ngiving this exam he'd never make such an accusation. I've led this class\nin grades all through school. And not by cheating, either.\"\n\n\"Lower your voice, Mister, and don't talk back!\" But Hanlon's\nmind-probing was receiving approbation now. \"I saw you cheating, and I\nknow what I saw. Do you want to resign, or will you force me to take you\nto the commandant?\"\n\n\"I don't know who you are, but you're a stupid fool!\" Hanlon apparently\nlost all control of himself, and his voice and red face showed the anger\nhe was simulating so well. \"If you think you're going to frame me out of\nthis class and out of graduating, you're a confounded idiot! Ask any of\nthese chaps here--they all know I'm not a cheat.\"\n\nBut the cadets, though puzzled and dismayed, were far too clever to get\nmixed up in this unexpected brawl. They all sat, eyes lowered but faces\nstraight ahead, arms folded across their chests, having no part in it at\nall.\n\nThe examining instructor, a man much larger and heavier than Hanlon's\nfive feet eleven inches and one hundred and seventy-five pounds, rushed\ndown from the platform. He grabbed at the cadet's arms, but Hanlon\nswivelled away, then stepped back in and struck at the officer.\n\nThat was mutiny! It was unthinkable for a cadet to strike an officer,\nunder any circumstances or provocation.\n\nThe teacher, however, snared the cadet in a neo-judo hold that no\nneophyte, however skilled or strong could break. He dragged the\nstruggling Hanlon up to the rostrum and, with his elbow, activated the\nintercom.\n\n\"Ask the commandant to come to room 12-B. A cadet, caught cheating at\nexaminations, has mutinied.\"\n\nStill holding the struggling, angry Hanlon, the instructor-officer\nexcoriated his victim for such breach of cadet honor. Hanlon, meanwhile,\nyelled insults and oaths. He twisted and squirmed as though trying to\nescape, although he had quickly realized he was now being held in a\nloose though apparently-valid grip he could have broken easily had he so\ndesired.\n\nYet during all this Hanlon was receiving from the officer's mind the\ndistinct impression that the latter hated what he was doing, yet was\napproving the way the new SS man was playing his part. Further, Hanlon\nsensed he was being welcomed into the fellowship of those unknown SS men\nto whom he was now brother.\n\nSoon Admiral Rogers, followed by two hulking space marines, came running\ninto the room.\n\n\"What's going on here?\" he barked.\n\nQuickly the teacher repeated his charges, while Hanlon yelled denials\nand vituperations at the moronic imbecile who dared accuse him of such\ntreachery.\n\n\"I'm ashamed of you, Hanlon!\" the admiral said coldly. \"We had high\nhopes for you, as I told you when I interviewed you about your initial\nassignment.\"\n\n\"Then why don't you listen to me instead of taking the word of this\nslime-snake who calls himself an instructor? Bah! He oughta be digging\nditches!\"\n\n\"That'll do!\" Disgust showed on the admiral's face as he gestured to the\nmarines, who jumped forward and grabbed Hanlon's arms, twisting them\nbehind his back and handcuffing them.\n\n\"George Hanlon, you are hereby officially dismissed from the\nInter-Stellar Corps' Cadet School!\"\n\nSo saying, Admiral Rogers ripped all identifying symbols from Hanlon's\nuniform, then turned again to the marines. \"Take him outside the\nReservation.\"\n\nThey hauled Hanlon, still shrieking and cursing, out of the room, out of\nthe building, across the park, and to the gate of the Corps' property.\n\nThere his handcuffs were removed, and the sneering marines literally and\nnot-too-gently booted him into the street, where he sprawled face\ndownward in a muddy puddle.\n\nHanlon pulled himself erect, apparently mad clear through. He shook his\nfist at the grinning marines gathered just inside the gate. He cursed\nthem fluently with every foul oath and name he could remember ever\nhaving heard. Innately clean of speech and thought, this swearing nearly\ngagged him. But he was \"putting on a good act.\"\n\nThey stood his insults for some time, but when he began to get too\npersonal, a couple of them started toward him, their mocking laughter\ngone. To \"make his act better,\" Hanlon now pretended to be frightened,\ncowardly, and accompanied by the jeers of the civilian on-lookers who\nhad quickly congregated to see what all the rumpus was about, he fled\ndown the city street away from the Reservation.\n\nAt first opportunity, after he had outdistanced his pursuers, Hanlon\nducked into an alley. He ran down this until he spotted the back door of\na little cafe, and dodged inside. There, in the washroom, he cleaned\nhimself as best he could.\n\nAgain somewhat presentable, he left by the front door and rode the\nslideways to a section of the city where he could buy some good but not\ntoo expensive clothing.\n\nNow inconspicuously dressed, he got a hotel room, then went to the bank\nwhere he bought some shares of stock, arranged for insurance, and rented\na deposit box.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\n\nIn the hotel room assigned him, George Hanlon threw himself on the bed\nand for an hour lay there reviewing this sudden, strange turn of events,\nand all it presaged. He tried in vain to thrust out of his mind the\nastonished consternation of his classmates, the sneers of the marines\nand the jeers of the civilians there at the gate, who had seen his\ndisgrace. Almost in tears now, he realized at last this was but a\nprelude to years of being scorned and vilified as a despised outcast.\n\nFinally he calmed a bit, then got up to pace the room, wondering what\nthe next move would be. The answer came almost at once. A rap on the\ndoor disclosed a messenger with a package for him. On opening it, after\nthe man had gone, Hanlon found the sleep-instructor and reels. On top\nwas a smaller reel marked, \"No. 1. Listen to this awake.\"\n\nHe plugged in the machine, and put on the reel. It was his father's\nvoice.\n\n\"You've got this far, now begins your real work. You should be able to\nmemorize the contents of these reels in two weeks. Briefly, here is what\nthey contain. Simonides Four was colonized under the direction of a\nGreek merchant who gave it his name. Four is the only habitable planet.\nMost of the original inhabitants under him were of his nationality, and\nthe present language is an outgrowth of modern Greek, which you know\nsomewhat. There are now, of course, many variations and new words, terms\npeculiar to their growing and evolving culture. The reels give all this\nmore fully.\n\n\"The last reel tells their history, geography and economic situation as\nof today. Also, details about their various large cities, especially New\nAthens, their capitol. We believe you will find that city the best place\nto start your investigations. When you have these reels memorized, go to\nthe bank, get your final instructions from the box, and your money for\nthe trip.\n\n\"As to the problem, again briefly this is it: In the past year or so\nFederation agents have sensed a movement there, but have not been able\nto interpret it. Whatever it is, it is very, very secret--the agents\ncan't even tell if it is political, religious, or merely social. Also,\nthey have discovered that many important men, as well as dozens--maybe\nhundreds--of less important men, have mysteriously disappeared. All this\nhas the smell of trouble for the Federation.\n\n\"At last the Secret Service was called in. We sent first one man, then a\nsecond. They tried to 'bore from within' by joining whatever the\nmovement was. But they haven't been able to get even a start--they've\nhit it and bounced. The second is still there, still trying.\n\n\"As a matter of fact, we have no evidence at all, merely a sort of\n'hunch', or presentiment, of a plot against the peace and welfare of the\nFederated Planets. There may be nothing wrong at all, but we don't like\nto take chances. With your ability to read minds you may be able to find\nout. We hope so.\"\n\nHanlon thought the message was ended, but then the voice began again. \"I\nwas told you came through your disgrace-scene very well. I know just\nwhat you are undoubtedly feeling at the moment, Spence--how sick at\nheart you are--and I only wish there was some way of easing your pain.\nBut it will pass.\n\n\"Good luck, son, and safe flights. Take care of yourself. We're all\nbehind you, and by the devious ways you know you can call on any or all\nof us at need. These reels are all water soluble, so dissolve them in\nthe washbowl and flush down the drain as soon as you're through with\neach.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor the next two weeks Hanlon stayed fairly close to his room, studying\nby day from books obtained at the library the things he was learning at\nnight via the sleep-instructor.\n\nThe evening of Graduation Day he sat miserably in front of a video\nscreen in his room, watching the broadcast of the stately ceremony of\nwhich he would have been a part but for his decision to join the Secret\nService.\n\nAll the longings of the years he had wanted to become a part of the\nInter-Stellar Corps; all the hopes and plans he had made during his five\nlong years in cadet school; all the thrilling pride he had known that he\nwas to be a part of the greatest organization in the Universe, swelled\ninside him and choked him.\n\nWhen, at long last, the class rose to take the Oath of Allegiance,\nHanlon found himself on his feet, rigidly at attention, repeating the\nimpressive ritual aloud with them.\n\nNow, for the first time, despite his decision and his private\ngraduation, he truly felt himself a vital part of the Corps.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the street on his way to the library the following day, Hanlon\nchanced to meet a small group of his former classmates, now clad in\ntheir brand-new dress uniforms of sky-blue and crimson, their new junior\nlieutenant's bars shining brightly.\n\n\"Hi, fellows!\" he greeted them, only to be met by silent glares of\ncontempt.\n\n\"Aw, look, fellows, you know I was framed,\" Hanlon planted himself in\nfront of them, and made himself look hurt, nor was that any effort. This\nreally cut deep. But he had to \"play it out\"; had to make them keep on\nthinking his disgrace was real.\n\n\"You guys know I'd never do anything like that,\" he continued\nplaintively. \"I didn't cheat--didn't need to. I know I lost my head when\nhe accused me, but anyone'd do that.\"\n\n\"You mean you were never caught cheating before,\" Trowbridge sneered.\n\"You sure had me ... us ... all fooled. Now scram, or else....\" He\ndoubled his fists and took a step toward Hanlon.\n\nThe latter still played out his string, but his heart was sick. He liked\nthe fellows--they had been among his best friends for five long, happy\nyears. Only now was he truly beginning to realize what a tremendous\nprice he was paying ... and would have to pay all his life.\n\nHe stepped in and swung ... and was instantly the target for flying\nfists. He was knocked down several times, but always managed to get up\nagain. He had been well trained in fighting of all types--and now he was\nputting all his knowledge and skill into use--but only for defense and\nthe pretense of attack.\n\nEven so he was getting badly mauled, for they were as well trained--and\nwere five to his one. His clothes were dirty and ripped from the\nknock-downs, and a button was torn off his coat. His knuckles were\nskinned, and he could feel that his face was becoming a mass of bruises.\nA hard left connected with his mouth, and he spat out a broken tooth.\n\n\"'Ten-shun!\" a commanding voice suddenly broke in.\n\nInstantly the five Corpsmen jumped back and, so ingrained was the\ntraining he had received, so did Hanlon, to come at salute as they saw a\nHigh Admiral climbing out of a ground-cab at the curb.\n\nHanlon, instantly realizing he wasn't in uniform and was supposedly a\ndischarged Corpsman, quickly dropped his salute and slouched\ntruculently.\n\n\"What's going on here!\" the officer asked icily.\n\n\"This man's a disgraced cadet, sir. Cheated on final exams,\" one of them\nexplained. \"He tried to talk to us.\"\n\n\"It's a lousy lie!\" Hanlon rasped. \"I was framed. The Corps. Paugh!\" he\nspat in pretend disgust. \"I'm getting out of here just as damned quick\nas I can, and as far as I can. I'll go clear to Andromeda Seven if I can\nraise enough credits!\"\n\nOnly he, apparently saw the minute widening of the admiral's eyes at\nthat code-word. The officer faced the new lieutenants sternly.\n\n\"A Corpsman is supposed to be able to handle five civilians, not five\nCorpsmen to one. If this man is a disgraced cadet, you have a right to\nfeel as you do about him. But leave him alone--the years will bring him\nmore sorrow and pain than you can with your fists. And you, fellow,\"\nturning to Hanlon. \"Don't think I'm interfering just to save your\nworthless skin,\" his tone was one of utmost contempt. \"I just don't want\nCorpsmen fighting on the street. Dismiss.\"\n\nThe five saluted smartly and marched away. The admiral winked briefly\nand with respect at Hanlon before reentering his cab.\n\nBut as the young man hurried back to his hotel to clean up, he was\nheartsick, remembering the many, many months of pleasant companionship\nwith those boys. Especially Dick Trowbridge, who had been his roommate\nand special chum all through cadet school, and who today had seemed\nparticularly disgusted and vicious in that fight.\n\nGiving up all that had made life so happy and wonderful was more than a\nfellow could bear, his bitter thoughts ran. What a fool he had been to\nlet himself be talked into taking this on. Where were all those \"vast\nrewards\" his dad and Admiral Rogers had talked about so eloquently? How\ncould anything possibly make up for losing the respect and friendship of\neveryone he had ever known?\n\nHowever, he had to admit, though still doubtfully, Dad had gone through\nit even to the point of giving up his son, and those last few weeks with\nhis adored wife, yet now seemed satisfied and content. Maybe ... maybe\nthere was something behind it all, that time would prove. But it was\nmighty hard to take, just the same.\n\nAnd this throbbing toothache didn't help his feelings any, either. The\nexposed nerve in that broken tooth made it ache like blazes. He'd better\nget it fixed before it drove him mad.\n\nHe started to go out, then stopped with the realization he had no money\nof his own to pay a dentist for the extraction and a bridge.\n\n\"What do I do in a case like this?\" he wondered. \"Is it ethical in such\na purely personal matter, to use Corps funds? Dad didn't mention things\nof this sort. On the other hand, he said we got our salaries and\nexpenses that way. Besides, you could say I lost the tooth in line of\nduty, and the Corps should replace it.\"\n\nHe went on, found a dentist and had the work done. Nor did he ever\nagain feel doubt about spending the Corps' money for things he actually\nneeded ... but neither did he ever spend any on purely personal pleasures\nor extra comforts save as he needed to do so to play up to whatever\nposition he assumed in the prosecution of his various assignments.\n\nEvening, however, found him still with that smothered feeling of\nself-pity about his fight with the fellows, and it persisted even after\nhe went to bed. By the Shade of Snyder, it wasn't fair to saddle a thing\nlike this on a mere kid.\n\nIt wasn't until after a couple of hours of tossing sleeplessness that he\nremembered he hadn't turned on the sleep-instructor. Half-rebelliously,\nhe nevertheless got up and did so ... and that little act broke his\nmood. He dropped asleep almost immediately after returning to bed.\n\nAt the end of the two weeks Hanlon felt he knew both the Simonidean\nlanguage and its customs well enough to start working. He went to the\nbank and, deviously, to box 1044.\n\nSorting through a thick sheaf of envelopes he found one with his name on\nit. He took it to one of the cubicles, whose door he locked from the\ninside, setting up full coverage.\n\nAs he read there flashed through his mind the background of this other\nplanet's situation. From his knowledge of politico-history within the\nFederation he knew there was an iron-clad agreement that each planet\ncould choose its own form of government. Most of them chose the\ndemocratic form, but some had a type of fascistic state. One or two--the\nmost advanced--even had an anarchistic state, with a very minimum of\nlaws and governing.\n\nSimonides had, about a century earlier, reverted to the empire\nstatus--the only planet within the Federation to do so. It had\noriginally been colonized as a world-wide republic, but later had broken\nup into five independent countries, as different sections became\npopulated more heavily with people of other national backgrounds than\nGreek. These five countries had eventually been recombined, after a\nspectacular coup, as an empire.\n\nThen had come this belief of the Corps that something was brewing there\nthat would affect the peace of the Federation, and the failure of their\nagents so far to find out about it.\n\nNow SSM Hanlon's orders were to take ship to Simonides Four, and seek to\nlearn what he could about these guessed-at conditions as swiftly as\npossible. If he gained any impressions of who or what group was behind\nthis movement, he was to attempt to join it and ferret out that secret\nso it could be reported.\n\nWith such information in their possession, the Corps would know if it\nwas anything inimical to the peace and security of the Federation, and\nwould take the necessary steps.\n\nHis instructions ended, \"The cost of a first class ticket to Simonides\nis seven hundred and fifty credits, so you should draw enough to have at\nleast fifteen hundred, for all needed expenses. Take the '_Hellene_'\nwhich leaves Centropolis spaceport Friday of this week. We have good\nreason to believe that certain interesting people will be aboard that\nship.\"\n\nHanlon's mind raced. Evidently someone wanted him to see what\nimpressions or evidence he could pick up from those suspected persons.\nHe grimaced as he realized the SS had left it strictly up to him to\ndiscover who those \"interesting people\" were. Perhaps they looked on it\nas a sort of test.\n\nBut he thrilled to the sudden awareness of what a wonderfully efficient\nand competent organization the SS was--how it kept careful watch on all\nits members, and assisted them in every possible manner.\n\nHe \"dined\" on the edible plastic sheets, then left the safety deposit\nvault. He arranged for his ticket and reservations at the bank's travel\nagency, then went back to his hotel to pack.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\n\nSo it was that early Friday morning George Hanlon, still dressed in\ncivvies, of course, arrived at the great passenger liner that was to\ntake him to far Simonides. He was thrilled with the idea of making such\na trip, for he loved the deeps of space--its immensity and its\nfathomless mystery gripped him with a feeling of grandeur.\n\nYet he had never been far outside the Solar system. The latter was not\nnecessary on his training cruises, since all the details of a pilot's\njob--the branch of the Service he had hoped to enter--were the same for\nboth inter-planetary and inter-stellar travel. It was the navigator's\njob that was the harder and more complicated on the longer, faster trips\nto destinations one could not see when blasting off.\n\nThis \"_Hellene_\" on which he was to ride was about sixty-five feet in\ndiameter and approximately three times that in length. The propulsion\nwas, the builders and engineers acknowledged, not the ultimate by any\nmeans. They were still constantly experimenting and hoping for much\nswifter travel. Still, they did pretty well.\n\nThey had some measure of anti-gravity to help lift the ship from a\nplanet. About 22%, Hanlon remembered. They still had to use rockets when\nnear a planet--but these present-day rockets were a far cry from the\nearly crude ones with which Snyder and his men had put first ships on\nthe Moon and planets. These could deliver a thrust far more powerful\nthan those early ones.\n\nFor long distances they used a type of \"warping\" that made the ship\n\"skip\" along the lines of force that permeate all space. Hanlon had\nnever quite got it firmly fixed in his mind just how this was done,\nespecially the technique of the engines that made it possible. That was\n\"advanced stuff\" that the cadets were not taught in their regular\ncourses--it was Post Graduate work for those who were to become\nEngineering Masters.\n\nAs he went up the escalator into the ship Hanlon was met at the outer\nlock by a deck steward who led him toward the level where his cabin was\nlocated.\n\nThis was Hanlon's first time aboard one of these luxury liners--how\ndifferent the deep-piled rugs, the magnificently frescoed passageway\nwalls, the deeply upholstered furniture, from the utilitarian plainness\nof the Corps' warships on which he had made his practice cruises.\n\n\"As you may know, sir,\" the steward said as they walked along, \"there is\nneither night nor day in space, but we use Terran time on the ship, and\nlights are turned on and off to conform to the regular Terran day.\nBreakfast is served from seven to nine, luncheon from twelve to\nfourteen, and dinner from eighteen to twenty-one.\"\n\n\"Thanks.\" A credit note changed from hand to hand--tipping was still in\nstyle. The obsequious steward gave him further directions for finding\nthe games and recreational rooms, and other points of interest aboard.\n\nHanlon unpacked, and stored his luggage in the compact closets and then,\nhaving heard the first and second warnings, hastened to the observation\ndesk, to watch the take-off. He had barely reached it and been strapped\ninto the acceleration chair turned to face the long, narrow quartzite\nport, when the blast-off sirens began screaming their third and final\nwarning.\n\nThe intra-ship communicators blared, \"All passengers and\npersonnel strap in. Five minutes until blast-off ... four\nminutes ... three ... two ... one ... thirty seconds ...\nfifteen ... ten ... five, four, three, two, one, BLAST!\"\n\nDimly heard through the insulated hull was what Hanlon knew to be a\ntremendous crescendo roar of sound, and he was pushed deep into the\nresilient spring-cushions of his chair. A constricting band seemed to be\nclamped on his chest, while at the same time there was a curious feeling\nthat he should weigh less but didn't. That was the peculiar sensation\nthe combination of anti-gravity and the thrust of the rockers always\ngave.\n\nFrom experience he knew how to regulate his breathing and to let his\nmuscles and nerves relax as much as possible, so that for him there was\nbut a brief moment of discomfort. Then he was able to watch the scene\nunfolding before and below him.\n\nThe ground and that outward splash of almost-intolerable flame quickly\ndropped away and within minutes the scene expanded until he was able to\nsee hundreds of square miles of city, country and ocean. Soon he could\nsee the distant mountains; but gradually the scene assumed a dimness of\ndetail that persisted until they were far outside the atmosphere. Then\nthe great continental masses became visible as a whole, but without any\nsmaller details apparent.\n\nTwo and a half hours later they were past the Moon, and began building\nup the tremendous speed that was to take them across inter-stellar\ndepths in a matter of short days. And as Luna shrank to a small sphere\nbehind them, Hanlon felt the acceleration grow constant, so unstrapped\nhimself and got up. He stretched hugely, to relieve the cramped feeling\nin his muscles, then turned to survey his fellow passengers.\n\nHe noticed several men in Corps' uniform, and hoped none of them knew\nhim--or if so, would be good enough not to spread word of his disgrace.\nThat would make the trip uncomfortable, lonely and unproductive, for\nthen it would be better for him to spend most of his time in his\nstateroom. He thought of those \"interesting people\" he had been told\nabout ... whatever that tip might mean.\n\nFor George Hanlon, youngest man ever to be assigned to the Inter-Stellar\nCorps' Secret Service--although he did not know this until later--had\nthat within him which placed matters of duty uppermost in his mind at\nall times.\n\nAccustomed for nearly half of his life to the conscious task of keeping\nhis mind-reading talent hidden and unused, he now knew he must work at\nit continuously to bring it up to its highest possible level of\nefficiency. Only by thus knowing every facet of his ability could he do\nwhat had to be done in his new task.\n\nHe sat down again and closed his eyes in order better to study this\nproblem without outside and extraneous matters interfering. He became\nawed and a little frightened as he realized fully the weight of his new\nduties and responsibilities, even though he had been all through this\nseveral times before. Somehow, his being aboard ship on his way to his\nactual work seemed to make this terrific responsibility more weighty.\n\nWhy must he be burdened with such a load as they had tied onto him? What\nwere the Corps' top brass thinking of, anyway, to put so much on an\nuntried kid just out of school?\n\nAt last he began to think less of his own burden and to concentrate on\nseeing what he could pick up mentally. He kept his eyes closed, but\nopened his mind wide and let the welter of thought-impressions roll in\nunhindered.\n\nThere was much laughter and lighthearted gaiety about him, as was\nnatural on such a luxury liner. There was also some fear of space and\nthe emptiness; some actual illness from space-fright. There were many\nmental undercurrents, and in one or two instances he thought he caught\nvague hints of sinister intrigue, but was never quite able to isolate\nthese, or to bring them into more distinct focus. Quite evidently the\nmen--or women--thinking such thoughts were able to close their minds to\nsome extent--or else he was too rusty at reading. He realized, too, that\nthey might not be thinking of any such thing--he remembered once when he\nwas a boy he thought he had caught some such thought, then found later\nit was merely a neighbor reading a story with a sinister plot.\n\nMind-reading, he told himself, was the field in which he would be\nassigned to work. The Corps and the SS would be sure to hand him all the\njobs where other agents had failed, just as they had in this case, in\nhopes that he could get them some beginning points of contact. So it was\nup to him to get busy and learn how to do it better.\n\nThe call for lunch found him still studying, but he was hungry, and went\ndown to eat. He could work there as well as on the observation deck,\nanyway.\n\nGoing into the dining room, the head waiter assigned him to a table\nalmost in the center of the large and tastefully decorated room. For\nsome moments he busied himself studying the menu, and when he had\nordered he glanced up again at his tablemates.\n\nHe had been introduced to this matron, and to her son who appeared to be\nabout his own age. He probed briefly, finding her a good sort but a\nlittle too impressed with her own importance--new-rich, he guessed. The\nboy he disliked on sight--he seemed a selfish, pampered brat.\n\nSo he forgot them and concentrated on letting his mind roam about the\ngreat room, seeking information and trying to refine and develop his\nmind-reading ability. It seemed to him the latter was improving to some\nextent ... yet realized this could as easily be wish-fulfillment as\nactuality.\n\nAfter luncheon he returned to the observation deck and there, as the\nlong afternoon slowly passed, he sat in his deck chair, eyes closed,\nmind wide open.\n\nSeveral times he caught some one thought-impression more distinctly than\nthe general run, and concentrated on trying to trace it mentally; to\nread it more clearly and minutely. But as he did not have much success,\nit began to irritate him ... and that made him angrier.\n\n\"Keep at it, and don't expect miracles,\" he scolded himself. \"Sure,\nyou've got something, but anything--any ability of mind or muscle--needs\ntraining and practice to get anywhere!\"\n\nAfter dinner that first evening Hanlon went into the recreation hall.\nThere were dozens of tables where people were playing various games. He\nsaw that around many of these other people were standing, watching the\nplay, and knew from this that social custom on the ship did not frown on\nsuch silent kibitzing.\n\nTherefore, he wandered about until he found a table where four men were\nplaying stud poker. Here he stood, watching the game, but concentrating\non the mind of the man opposite him, checking his mental impressions\nagainst the man's wins and losses.\n\nHe couldn't, at any time, actually read in the man's mind what his \"hole\ncard\" was, he found. But he could quite easily sense from the player's\nmind whether the latter considered it a good one, a very poor one, or\nonly a possible winner. By watching the play as well as studying the\nman's feelings, facial movements and muscle twitches or tensenesses,\nHanlon was soon able to make some remarkably accurate predictions as to\nwhat the card was. By checking his deductions with the card when it was\nshown, he saw he was gradually coming closer and closer to a perfect\nscore of \"reading.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe next day Hanlon again sat most of the time in the lounge, his eyes\nclosed, letting his mind soak up all the impressions and vibrations he\ncould. When one seemed particularly strong, he tried to follow it and\nlocate the person--with his mind, not his eyes--and read the whole\nthought.\n\nMostly he found again excitement and pleasure. Almost everyone on board\nseemed to be having a grand time, and enjoying the trip to the utmost.\nIt was what might be expected--a gay, carefree holiday crowd.\n\nYet there was, occasionally caught, that sinister undercurrent that had\nso puzzled him since he first sensed it the day before. It was not\nprominent at any time, nor continuous ... more as though only one or two\nminds held the thought, and those not in the lounge all the time, but\nwandering in and out.\n\nHe tried to analyze the feeling of those thoughts. They were\nmalevolent--that he had sensed from the beginning. And finally, later in\nthe afternoon, the person or persons thinking them evidently spent some\ntime near him in the lounge, for the feeling became much clearer to the\nSS man.\n\nHanlon still kept his eyes closed. He made no effort at this time to try\nto identify who was giving out those menacing sensations. That would\ncome later. At the moment he was more interested in trying to work out\njust what those sinister impressions meant.\n\nAnd gradually his mind was forced to the conclusion that it could mean\nonly one thing--a killing.\n\nHanlon was devoting almost all his mind to this problem when another\nmental impression intruded, and grew stronger, more demanding of his\nattention.\n\nIt was a feeling of sympathetic concern, yet diffident, apologetic. He\nfelt it growing stronger, seeming to be approaching him, to be directed\nat him.\n\nFor the moment he left off worrying about the other matter, and watched\nthis new thought.\n\nBy the instant it was growing stronger, and closer. He knew that, some\nway. He directed his attention toward what he believed was its source,\nbut idly, half angry at it for interrupting his more important thoughts.\nIt was in front of him ... and suddenly, like a bright, white beam of\nlight, his mind reached out and touched directly the mind holding that\nthought.\n\nTouched it ... it was instantly, unbelievably, _inside_ that mind!\n\nHe was able, actually, to _read_ the surface thoughts!\n\nClearly, distinctly, as though it were his own mind, Hanlon knew he was\none with a deck steward, who had noticed him sitting there all day and\nthe day before, with closed eyes and strained face. (His efforts at\nconcentration must have been too apparent--he'd have to learn to guard\nthat; to keep his face more impassive.)\n\nNow the steward was coming to see if he was ill. And at that instant a\nsoft, apologetic voice spoke from in front of him--spoke words he had\nalready read in that mind.\n\n\"Beg pardon, Mr. Hanlon, sir, but is anything wrong?\"\n\nHe opened his eyes lazily, and let a smile break out as he saw the\nsolicitous face of the white-coated attendant.\n\n\"Me? Not really. Just a little queazy, but I'm feeling better all the\ntime.\"\n\n\"I'm glad. But be sure and call if I can be of any service.\"\n\n\"Thank you, I will.\" Hanlon reached in his pocket and slipped a credit\nnote into the man's hand.\n\nAnd as the steward walked away Hanlon's mind was instantly whirling with\nthis newly-discovered ability. He was astonished and delighted, of\ncourse ... but a little disturbed, too.\n\n\"I was actually inside the guy's mind!\" he thought in amazement. \"That's\na new one! I was never able to do that before. I really read his\nthoughts! I've got to find out more about this. Let's see, now, how did\nI do it?\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter 7\n\n\nGeorge Hanlon glanced about the observation deck and saw at some\ndistance the young man who had sat at the same dining table. Hanlon\ngrinned a bit, and directed his mind that way.\n\nTo the best of his memory, he concentrated on doing the same thing he\nhad done when he got inside the steward's mind. For long, anxious\nminutes he tried. He felt tense, and the strain made his heart pound. At\nlast he sank back into his chair.\n\n\"The other was just a fluke, I guess,\" he frowned in frustration and\ndisgust at himself. \"I keep thinking I'm getting good--then _flooie_!\"\nHe idly sent his mind towards the boy again ... and suddenly found\nhimself once more within another person's mind.\n\nIt was a strange, weird feeling ... this getting two sets of thoughts at\nthe same time. Also, Hanlon felt a bit as though he was a trespasser in\nsome forbidden temple. Yet he persevered, trying to see if he could read\nanything there ... and was disappointed to find he could peruse and\nunderstand only the fleeting surface thoughts.\n\nWith all his might, in every way he could think of, he tried to probe\nback and beneath those passing thought-concepts, but could get no\ninformation whatever of the young man's past or knowledge. Only vacuous,\nself-centered thoughts which were flowing idly through the youth's mind\nwere available to him.\n\nHe wondered if he could influence the other to do something. If he could\ncontrol another's mind--even just a little--it would really help in his\nwork. So he now tried every method his agile mind could imagine, to make\nthe fellow pick up the book that lay beside his chair. He concentrated\non it, he insisted, he willed it. But in vain--he could make no\nimpression whatever.\n\nHanlon withdrew his mind. \"I've no control,\" he thought to himself. \"I\ncan't take over his mind in any way. Neither can I read his past; just\nhis present thoughts. That's not too bad, although I hoped I had hit the\njackpot at last.\"\n\nAfter some further reflection the thought occurred, \"Maybe I can do\nbetter with someone else.\"\n\nDuring the balance of the day he kept trying to read the minds of others\nof his fellow passengers, but found the same results in each case. He\ndid, however, develop the technique of making a much quicker entrance\ninto a mind--could do that reading more swiftly, and yet know he was\ncorrect.\n\n\"I get it now. I've got to approach it relaxed, not all tensed up like I\nwas at first,\" he finally realized.\n\nBut when it came to probing into and reading the whole mind, into its\npast thoughts and knowledges, no. Just that ... no!\n\nPessimistically he began to feel he wasn't going to be able to do as\nmuch with his \"mind-reading\" as he--and his superiors--had hoped.\n\nDid this mean, he wondered disconsolately as he went to his stateroom,\nthat he was to be a failure in the Secret Service? Or, he brightened\nmomently, could he develop other methods of ferreting out information?\nBut that, he told himself honestly, was out. What did he know about\ndetective work? The SS already had the best detectives in the Universe.\n\nThis dark mood persisted while he went to bed and finally dropped off to\nsleep. But when he awoke the next morning he felt cheerful again. He had\na lot--and he would get more.\n\nHe ate a good breakfast, then went back to his deck chair and there,\nresolutely, he opened his mind once more to general impressions. He\nwould keep working at it, and more was bound to come. Look how far he'd\nadvanced already. A lot further than when he had started. And at that,\nhe probably--no, undoubtedly--could do more than any of the other\nfellows on certain problems. As far as he knew--and Dad and Admiral\nRogers had talked as though he were the only one they knew about--no one\nelse could read even surface thoughts.\n\nSo he kept diligently at it. And very soon, so strongly he deduced the\nmind must be very close to him, he again found those sinister\nimpressions that had bothered him so much.\n\nThis time he glanced about, in apparently casual curiosity, yet touched\nmind after mind of those nearest him. Then hit pay dirt!\n\nWhy, it was that bluff, hearty-looking, red-headed man in the third\nchair to his right. He didn't look vicious, that was certain, though\nthere was a grim set to his jaw. Yet his surface thoughts showed the man\nto be hard, cold and ruthless--a pure killer type. Hanson sensed he was\none of those men who have such a will to power that the lives and rights\nof others are held cheaply, contemptuously. The kind who, if another\ngets in his way, removes him ... but carefully, lest his own\nhighly-valuable skin be put in jeopardy. If he could get some one else\nto do the dirty work, so much the better. Such conscienceless killers\nwere, Hanlon knew, usually arrant cowards.\n\nThere was someone on this ship who was in this man's way--of that Hanlon\nfelt sure. The killer was determined to destroy this other the first\nchance he got. His mind was now weighing chances and possible\nopportunities--and Hanlon read and learned.\n\nYes, this must be one of those \"interesting people\" that unknown SS\ntipster back on Terra had mentioned. Was the victim another? Probably.\nFor Hanlon had not yet read any thoughts in this killer's mind about any\nconfederates.\n\nHanlon kept close watch on this man and his mind, and picked up many\nother stray bits of information, including his name, Panek. None seemed\nof too much immediate importance regarding the matter at hand. Yet they\ngave the Secret Service man a fairly good picture of the assassin's\npersonality, when pieced all together.\n\nSuddenly, and but a barely passing whisper of thought, Hanlon caught the\nconcept that the intended victim's death was necessary to the coup\n\"they\" were planning on Simonides.\n\nHanlon was instantly alerted by that planet-name. Perhaps this was a\ndefinite lead for him. He strained to get more. The killer thought\noccasionally of a man he called \"The Boss\", but not the name of that\ndignitary, nor his actual position--politically, socially, economically,\nor otherwise.\n\nThe SS man fumed inwardly because he could not get a clear picture of\nthat \"Boss.\" This murderer did not have a visual type of mind, darn it.\nHe didn't see clearly in pictorial terms any of the people or scenes\nabout which he thought.\n\nHanlon had been gradually impressed, though, with the realization that\nthis man was very much afraid of his boss. There was a mental shiver\nevery time thought of his employer entered his mind. There was something\nabout a previous failure, and what would undoubtedly happen unless it\nwas done now, but Hanlon couldn't get enough of that to make any sense\nto him.\n\nAgain Panek began thinking, though very sketchily, about \"Sime\", as he\ncalled Simonides, and the \"plot\" that was being hatched there. Hanlon\nfelt the man's sneering contempt for \"those beasts\"--but could gain no\nidea whatever about what that reference meant.\n\nIn so many ways this puzzle seemed to be growing worse instead of\nbetter, and Hanlon knew a moment of frustration. But his sense of humor\ncame to his rescue. \"You want the whole thing written out for you in\nblack and white?\" he jeered at himself. \"Snap out of it! Quit being a\ndefeatist.\"\n\nHarder and more intently he tried to probe into the man's mind. Oh, if\nhe could only learn to read below those passing surface thoughts; to\nfollow them down and back along the memory-chains into the total mind!\nRevealing though the thoughts he could catch were, for complete and\nswift results he must find the technique of reading a mind completely.\nIf such a thing were possible.\n\nBut probe as he might, the way to those deeper, buried memories and\nthoughts continued to remain locked from him.\n\nAnd then Panek got up and left the observation deck.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA light touch on his knee some time later snapped George Hanlon's eyes\nwide open, and he looked down to see a small, wriggly dog looking up\ninto his face, its tail frantically wig-wagging signals of proffered\nfriendship, the little tongue making licking motions toward the hand the\npuppy could not quite reach.\n\n\"Well, hi, fellow,\" Hanlon reached down and lifted the little dog onto\nhis lap, where the latter wriggled and contorted in an ecstasy of joy,\nclimbing all over the young man, licking at his hands and trying to\nreach his face. The puppy was so extremely happy and anxious to make\nfriends that Hanlon was soon laughing almost convulsively while trying\nto avoid those well-meant but very moist kisses.\n\n\"Wait now, boy. Take it easy. I like you and all that, but let's not get\ncarried away with ourselves.\"\n\nHanlon scratched the puppy behind one of its floppy ears, and pressed it\nfirmly but gently down so it was lying on his lap.\n\n\"That's better. Just lie there and take it easy.\"\n\nA sudden thought brought a grin onto the young man's lips. He tried to\nget into the puppy's mind ... and got a real surprise. For after a few\nanxious moments of testing and trying, he did it--actually got the dog's\nthoughts of pleasure at finding such a wonderful new friend with such a\nnose-appealing effluvium. Hanlon then tried to see if he could get into\nthe deeper parts of the dog's mind, and using what knowledge of the\ntechnique he had deduced in his previous though unsuccessful attempts\nwith humans, found after many more anxious minutes he could follow the\nthought-and-memory tracks back and back until the dog's whole mind was\nopen to him.\n\nThe puppy had far more of a mentality than Hanlon had ever guessed dogs\nhad--and he knew they were far from stupid. This one's mind, he could\nnow see, was immature but latently capable.\n\nSay, this was great! Hanlon probed some more, and found many sketchy\nfacts--sketchy because the thoughts were incomplete to the puppy, beyond\nits experience, and not because the man couldn't read perfectly what was\nthere. The dog apparently knew a woman--Hanlon got the impression of\nskirts--and answered when that goddess called the word \"Gypsy.\"\n\n\"Gypsy, eh?\" Hanlon said aloud, and immediately the dog wriggled from\nbeneath his restraining hand, and again tried to climb up and lick\nHanlon's face in a frenzy of adoration.\n\n\"Lie down, sir, and be quiet!\" Hanlon said sternly, and the puppy did so\ninstantly, without question or hesitation.\n\nHanlon thrilled, realizing at once that it was not what he had said that\ndid the trick--but the fact that he was still inside the dog's mind, and\nthat it had obeyed his will rather than his words.\n\n\"Hey, this needs looking into!\"\n\nWithout saying the words aloud this time, Hanlon commanded the dog--or\nrather, he impressed the command directly onto the puppy's mind with his\nown--to get down off his lap onto the deck.\n\nInstantly it leaped down.\n\n\"Lie down.\" The dog did so.\n\n\"Roll over.\" Again silently. But now the puppy merely looked up at him,\nimploringly, quivering in an apparent emotion of indecision. Hanlon\nrealized the puppy didn't know how to \"roll over.\"\n\n\"Guess I need to learn how to do it before I can teach, or rather,\ncommand, him to do it,\" Hanlon grinned wryly to himself. For he realized\nthat to do so he would have to learn how to control each of the dog's\nmuscles, and that before he could do that he would have to know what\npart of the brain controlled the nerves that made those muscles obey his\ncommands.\n\nAnd that, if possible at all, would take one galaxy of a lot of study\nand practice.\n\nFor the next several minutes, then, he concentrated in making the puppy\ndo a number of simple tricks, all the time watching carefully to see, if\npossible, the connecting links between brain, nerves and muscles.\n\nHe was beginning to make a little headway in understanding this triple\nco-relation, when he heard a sudden gasp. He looked up to see a young\nmatron standing before him, her mouth and eyes wide with surprise.\n\n\"Why ... why, Gypsy never did any tricks before. What are you, an animal\ntrainer?\"\n\nHanlon leaped to his feet. \"The best in the Universe, Madam,\" he\ngrinned. \"That's a mighty fine puppy you have. He came over and\nintroduced himself, and we've been having some fun together.\"\n\n\"Yes, he ran off, and I've been hunting all over for him. But how on\nearth did you ever teach him so quickly?\"\n\n\"It's a gift,\" Hanlon mocked, then grew serious. \"Honestly, Madam, I\ndon't know,\" he said quietly. \"I just seem to have a way with dogs, is\nall. By the way, would you sell me the puppy?\"\n\n\"Sell Gypsy? No, thanks,\" and she started away, calling to the dog to\nfollow. But it stood in indecision, looking from one to the other, not\nseeming to know whether to follow its beloved mistress or to stay and\nplay with this nice new friend.\n\nHanlon quickly reached out to the dog's mind and impressed on it that it\nmust follow the woman, and always do whatever she told it. The puppy\nthen trotted away, content.\n\nGeorge Hanlon sank into his deck chair. This required a good think--a\nmighty serious think--he told himself. He would have to work on this as\nmuch as on human minds. For if he could control animals--would it work\non birds, or insects? Maybe even fish?--then he could get into places\nhe, as a man, could not go.\n\nThe lady and dog had disappeared when Hanlon got the inspiration to see\nif his mind could find them; if he could again contact the dog when it\nwas not in sight, and he did not know exactly where it was.\n\nInstantly, effortlessly, it seemed, as though it happened merely because\nhe wished it to, he found himself again inside the puppy's mind. Was it\nbecause he already knew that mind's pattern, he wondered?\n\nAnyway, there he was, and now he tried to see if he could look out\nthrough Gypsy's eyes ... and after much study, he did so. But the vision\nwas so distorted he wondered if his control was at fault, then\nremembered having heard, or read somewhere, that a dog's eyes do not\nwork exactly the same as a man's.\n\nFinally he accustomed himself to them enough so he could see that they\nwere going down a narrow corridor, and then they stopped before a door,\nwhich opened after a moment. The dog, without a command, leaped through\nthe doorway into the stateroom and ran to its basket, where it lay,\npanting, looking up at its mistress.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 8\n\n\nGeorge Hanlon withdrew from the puppy's mind, and thought seriously.\nYes, this matter of controlling the minds of animals was one that would\nrequire a lot of thought and study, and a tremendous amount of practice.\nBut it seemed important enough to justify those expenditures.\n\nHe hunted up his steward. \"Where do the passengers keep their pets?\"\n\n\"Some keep them in their staterooms, sir, but others in the kennels down\non 'H' deck.\"\n\n\"Thanks. Any rules against my going down there and looking at 'em? I\nlike animals, especially dogs.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, sir. Anyone can go down there. It's on the right hand side,\nabout halfway aft.\"\n\nArrived at the kennels, Hanlon found the cages contained about a dozen\ndogs of various breeds, ages and sizes. Here were plenty of animal minds\nfor his experimentation and study.\n\nAfter walking around and looking at them for some minutes, he sat down\non a bench at one side of the cages, and concentrated on the dog nearest\nhim. It was a large white bull, and he guessed its age to be about five\nor six years. That was just what he wanted--an adult mind to study, not\nthat of an immature puppy.\n\nHe had no trouble getting into the dog's mind, and for over an hour he\nsat there, studying it line by line, channel by channel, connector by\nconnector, while the dog lay as if asleep. Gradually Hanlon began to\nfeel he was beginning to know something about a dog's mind-and-body\ncorrelation, and how it operated.\n\nThen, and only then, he woke the dog and began experiment with control.\nHe found it easy to make the dog do anything he wished that was within\nthe animal's previous knowledge and experience. What he wanted was to\nsee if he could make it perform motions and actions that were outside\nits previous conditioning and training. After some fumbling, he thrilled\nto find that now even some of the simpler of those things were not too\ndifficult, although others his present knowledge was not up to handling.\n\nHis study taught him to some extent how to activate the brain centers\nwhich controlled the nerves that sent messages to the proper muscles\nthat allowed the dog to do his bidding. But it still needed a lot of\nstudy. He knew he had only made a bare start at learning what had to be\nknown to do it swiftly and easily.\n\nThe kennel steward must have noticed the strange antics of the bull and\nthen, seeing Hanlon's intent concentration, figured there might be some\nconnection between the two. For he came up to the bench and looked down\nsomewhat hostilely at the man sitting there. But his voice, when he\nspoke, was very polite.\n\n\"Anything I can do for you, sir?\"\n\nHanlon had been concentrating so deeply he had not heard anyone come up,\nand the voice, speaking so suddenly right before him, startled and\nbefuddled him. He looked up, and his mind felt sluggish and weak, almost\nas though he had been doped.\n\n\"Huh?\" he asked stupidly.\n\n\"I asked,\" the man's tone was a little sharper, \"if there was anything I\ncould do for you?\"\n\n\"Oh, no. No thanks.\" Hanlon forced himself to pay attention. \"I just\nlike dogs and came down here to watch them. Must have dozed off.\"\n\n\"Do you have a dog of your own here?\"\n\n\"No, I have no dog at present.\"\n\n\"What were you doing to that white bull. He's been acting very peculiar\nsince you've been here.\"\n\n\"Me?\" Hanlon made himself look surprised. \"Why, nothing. I've just been\nsitting here; haven't said a word to any of them.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm not too sure it's proper for you to be here as long as you\nhave no dog kennelled here.\"\n\n\"Sorry. If it bothers you, I'll leave.\"\n\nHanlon started away ... then stopped short. He had wondered at that\ncuriously sluggish feeling in his mind. Now, with a start he had trouble\nconcealing, he suddenly realized a mind-numbing fact!\n\nHe had seen and heard that exchange of conversation from two separate\nand distinct points! And now he was watching himself leave!\n\n_He had heard and seen both from his own ... and from the dog's mind!_\n\nYes, he suddenly comprehended that the dog had heard and _understood_\nevery word of that brief conversation--not as a dog might, _but as a man\nwould_!\n\nSuddenly drenched with a cold sweat, Hanlon knew he had not merely been\ninside the dog's mind, observing and controlling, but that he had\nactually _transferred_ a portion of his own mind into the dog's brain!\n\nNo wonder his own mind--what was left in his own brain--had felt\nsomewhat inadequate and lacking for the moment. It was not his complete\nmind. When the steward startled him, he had forgotten to withdraw from\nthe bull's brain.\n\nNow he carefully did so, and with senses reeling, almost ran back to his\nstateroom.\n\nHanlon threw himself onto the bed and lay there, trembling with awe at\nrealization of the immensity of what he had done.\n\nHow in the name of Snyder was such a thing possible? Reading a mind's\nimpressions, even the surface thoughts, was well within the realms of\npossibility he knew, for he had done it himself. Even hundreds of years\nbefore, such things had been believed possible, and had been studied\nextensively and scientifically. Many people throughout the centuries had\nclaimed the ability to read minds, though only a few had ever proven\ntheir powers satisfactorily under carefully controlled laboratory\nconditions.\n\nHe himself, until the past day or so, had not been able to read a mind\ndirectly, nor could he do it perfectly even yet, with humans.\n\nAlso, he conceded, it was a reasonable concept that if he had any mental\nability at all with humans, it should be greater and more efficient with\nanimals. For they had less actual brain-power; their minds were far less\ncomplex than human minds.\n\n_But to be able to transfer part of his mind ... to separate\nit--dissociate it--and have it outside of his body and in some other\nbody's mind!_\n\n\"Ain't that sumpin'?\" he whistled in awed amazement.\n\nPulling himself together with an effort of will, he set his mind to\nreviewing carefully the entire episode, and to figuring out where all\nthis might fit in with the business at hand.\n\n\"I thought, when I first got into that pup's mind, that it would be a\nbig help, and it will. But this will be even more so, if I can really\ncontrol animals, and see and hear with their eyes and ears. And if I can\nsend them where I want them to go, and send my mind, or part of it,\nalong with them, and still know what it and they are doing, that will be\ntremendous!\"\n\nHe remembered how he had been able to get into the puppy's mind after it\nhad gone out of sight, so now he sent his mind down to the kennels.\nAgain, without any trouble, without any delay or hesitation, he found\nhimself inside the bull's mind, and could look out through the cage\nwires and see the rest of the kennel deck.\n\nHe withdrew and lay there, almost dumbfounded.\n\n\"How did I ever get such ability?\" he wondered. \"No one else in our\nfamily has it. Am I some sort of a mutant? But if so, how or why? I\nnever heard Dad or Mother mention it.\"\n\nHe had lots of questions, but no answers.\n\nBut thinking about this new ability and his job with the Secret Service\nsuddenly reminded him of that potential murderer he had been watching.\nHe realized with dismay that in his excitement over this latest\ndevelopment he had entirely forgotten that angle. He had better get back\non the ball, but fast!\n\nHe got up, splashed cold water on his face, dried it, ran a comb through\nhis hair, and went back to the lounge.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe man Panek was not in the Observation lounge, so Hanlon went seeking\nhim. Just as he neared the game rooms on his rounds, he saw his man\nleaving them. Allowing the stranger to get some distance ahead, Hanlon\ntrailed him as carefully as he could, all the time trying to read what\nthe killer had in mind.\n\nNot entirely to his surprise, Hanlon found he could now read the surface\nthoughts even more easily than formerly. Thus he soon knew,\nemphatically, that the man was definitely bent on that contemplated\nkilling right now--that the victim was in his stateroom but was going to\nleave it shortly in response to a faked video-call.\n\nHanlon also learned that the murderer had a knife concealed in his\nsleeve--and was adept in its use.\n\nThe SS man's mind rocketed swiftly. What was he to do? He didn't want a\nmurder done, but neither did he want this man killed nor jailed--at\nleast not until he had learned a great deal more concerning him and his\npart in or knowledge of that \"plot\" on Simonides that Hanlon and the\nCorps were trying so desperately to solve.\n\n\"I've got to learn to consider mighty carefully all the angles about\neven the most apparently-insignificant things,\" he thought carefully. \"I\ncan't take chances of gumming things up, but on the other hand, I want\nto get an 'in' with that gang if I can.\"\n\nA possibility occurred to the young agent--and he quailed a bit, then\ngrinned wolfishly at the thought. It was plenty dangerous, but if he\ncould put it over maybe it would give him that \"in\" he needed.\n\nHe hurried his steps and caught up with the big man just as the latter\nwas stopping momentarily to peer cautiously around the corner and down a\ncorridor which, Hanlon could read in his mind, led to the victim's\nstateroom.\n\nHanlon tapped the man on the shoulder, and as the fellow whirled, a\nsnarl on his face, Hanlon stepped backward a pace and held up his hands\nin the \"I'm not armed\" gesture. Then, before Panek could speak, he\nstepped closer to whisper.\n\nBut the thug was both angry and frustrated at the spoiling of his\ncarefully-worked-out plan, and in no mood for conversation. That lethal\nknife seemed to jump out of his sleeve and toward Hanlon, in the strong,\nswift, practiced hand of the killer.\n\nThe SS man jumped backward, then his own hands darted out and grabbed\nfor the other's wrists in the manner he had been taught. He caught the\nright, or knife hand, but the big fellow was as dextrous as he, even if\nhe didn't look capable of such fast action. His other hand eluded\nHanlon's grasp, and with it Panek struck and jabbed--heavy blows to\nHanlon's face and body.\n\nHanlon parried the blows as best he could, at the same time trying to\nmake his low-voiced words penetrate.\n\n\"Cut it out, you fool! I'm trying to help you, not hinder you! Stop it,\nblast you, and listen!\"\n\nBut he might as well have been talking to the metal walls. One eye was\nswelling rapidly, and he had a nick in his arm that he could feel was\nsoaking his jacket sleeve. Seeing he couldn't make the fellow listen,\nHanlon threw him with a super-judo trick, then sat on him.\n\n\"Shut up and listen to me, Panek!\" he hissed urgently, using all his\nfighting technique meanwhile to keep the other's threshing form\nimmobile. \"I'm trying to warn you that the bozo you're after carries one\nof those new needle-guns, and the needles are poison-tipped. Also, he's\nthe fastest man on the draw I've ever seen--I watched him practice. Just\none of those needles and you'd be kaput before you could yell.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Why ... how ... what d'you mean, huh, what d'you mean?\"\n\nThe man stopped his struggles for the moment, while his face showed\nplainly how aghast he was at this interfering stranger's apparent\nknowledge of his intentions.\n\n\"Who are you, huh, and what's your game, what's your game?\"\n\nHanlon made his voice seem both friendly and calculating, and hurried on\nwith his specious explanation before the fellow should start fighting\nagain.\n\n\"I'd been tipped off there was something up, on Simonides, where a good\nhustler could make himself plenty of credits. And credits in quantity is\nwhat I'm after ...\"\n\n\"What's that got to do with me, huh, what has it?\"\n\n\"... and I'm on my way there to see what my chances are of getting in on\nthe game. So naturally I tried to learn all I could about it ahead of\ntime. I was told this bird you're after was an important man there, so I\nstudied him. One of the first things I found out about him was that he\ncarried one of those needlers. If he's in your way, together we oughta\nbe able to get rid of him ... but let's play it safe, eh?\"\n\nThe stranger gave him a cold, calculating going-over with those hard,\nsuspicious eyes. \"Let me up, Bub, let me up. I'll be good while we\ntalk.\"\n\nHanlon rose, but stood warily as the other slowly climbed to his feet.\nBut he wasn't sharp enough--Panek's hand flashed out even before he\nseemed to be standing erect, and slickly grabbed the wallet from the\ninside pocket of Hanlon's jacket.\n\nBut the SS man, seeing what the other was after, stood there without\nmaking any resistance.\n\n\"Take your time looking at 'em, Pal,\" he said easily. \"I'm clean.\nStrictly on my own in this. Just got kicked out of that snake's nest of\na Corps school on Terra ...\"\n\nThe killer's head snapped up at mention of the Corps, and he stared\nharder and more suspiciously than ever into Hanlon's eyes.\n\n\"... They said I cheated at exams, and wouldn't give me a chance to\ndefend myself,\" Hanlon continued quickly, but with heat. \"That soured me\non 'em, but good! So I says to myself, blast John Law! From now on I'm\non the other side. Anything he's after must be worth plenty to any guy\nwho can outsmart him. Knowing his side of it and how he works, I figure\nI'm just that good!\"\n\nHe said all this with such a deadly serious voice, that although it was\nbravado Panek could see it was also confidence. Hanlon had figured this\nstraight-forwardness was his best bet. Tell his side of it first, for if\nhe got in with them--or any gang--they would be sure to check, and would\nfind out he had been a cadet, anyway. \"Beat 'em to the punch before they\nform any contrariwise conclusions,\" was his judgment.\n\nHis plan seemed to be working, for as his explanation continued and was\ncompleted the killer looked at him with some measure of respect,\nalthough his eyes and manner were still filled with suspicion.\n\n\"Can't blame you for feeling sore, can't blame you, if they really did\nkick you out. But I don't trust nobody that's ever had any connection at\nall with the cops, don't trust 'em!\"\n\n\"Look, Pal, use your head! If I was a John Law would I merely have\nstopped you? I'd be arresting you--or killing you for pulling that knife\non me. I tell you I'm clean--and that I want an 'in' on Simonides.\"\n\n\"I heard, too, there was good pickings on Sime,\" the man said slowly.\n\"'Course, I'm not in on anything special, myself, not in on it. This\nhere's a purely personal grudge deal. But you prob'ly did me a good\nturn, a good turn, and if you want to look me up after we land, I maybe\ncould introduce you to a man or two. I didn't know old Abrams carried\none of them needlers, didn't know that.\"\n\nThe thanks in his gruff voice showed his respect for those silent,\ndeadly little guns.\n\nThat name--Abrams--rang a bell in Hanlon's mind, though he quickly\ndecided he'd better let it lie for the moment--file it away for future\ninvestigation.\n\nHe smiled in comradely fashion. \"The way you were walking into it made\nme sure you didn't know. And thanks. Maybe I will look you up. I don't\nknow anyone on Simonides, and it doesn't hurt to have a friend or three.\nWhere do I find you there?\"\n\n\"Evenings I'm often at the Bacchus Tavern. And,\" with a sinister\ngrimace, \"if you come, you'd better pray that '_he_' likes you, you'd\nsure better!\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter 9\n\n\nSS man George Hanlon went slowly back to his room where he could think\nseriously without the outside abstractions he would be sure to encounter\nin any of the public rooms.\n\nHe had made a good bid, he thought, for contact with what he felt sure\nmust be the group he wanted to get in with. Hanlon felt Panek's\nstatement that he, personally, was not in on it, was just so much\nhog-wash. That last crack about \"you'd better pray that 'he' likes you,\"\nwas almost sure proof.\n\nBut what did it mean? Who was this \"he,\" and why had Hanlon better pray\n\"he\" liked him? Probably the leader ... and if so, undoubtedly a\ndangerous man to play around with. Hanlon remembered the fear of his\nboss he'd read in Panek's mind.\n\nAlso, what about Abrams? Hanlon felt sure it was the same man he had\nguarded that day. Oh, oh, was that \"failure\" he had also read in Panek's\nmind that unsuccessful attempt he, Hanlon, had thwarted? Was Panek--and\nthrough him this as-yet-unmet leader--behind that attempt on Abrams'\nlife?\n\nThese were questions he could not answer yet--not enough data. But he\nwould have to find the answers sometime. And once in Panek's gang, he\nmight find them. And even if this particular gang was not the one doing\nthe plotting in which the Corps was so interested, Hanlon felt that\ngetting into even one of the organized gangs on Simonides would be a\nstep in the right direction.\n\nBut he would have to watch his step. Those fellows would be about as\nsafe to play with as a pitful of cobras. For a long moment he grew cold\nwith fear; a deadly, paralyzing terror that twisted his vitals into\nhard, hard knots. What business did he have, mixing with mature, deadly\nkillers such as these?\n\nOn the other hand, he consoled himself after awhile, being able to read\ntheir surface thoughts should warn him when he started getting out of\nline. Then, if or when he did, he would walk more softly, travel inch by\ninch, and not make any attempts to jump into the big middle of things\nuntil he got a lot more information ... and more experience in the ways\nand means of gangsterism.\n\nBut suddenly he felt that cold fear return. Those men were--must\nbe--hard, trained killers all. This Panek was not even the boss--was\njust a gunny. And those higher-ups would be much worse than Panek--more\nruthless and more contemptuous of human life and rights. They would have\nto be, to be the higher-ups. For Hanlon sensed that in such a group,\nMight very decidedly made Right ... and Power.\n\nIt took some time to quiet his shrieking nerves. Nor did he ever forget\nthe awfulness of that fear that so nearly brought him down out of\ncontrol. On the other hand, never again did he reach such depths of\nutter panic.\n\nHe finally rose, bathed and dressed for dinner. But during the meal his\nmind was in such a turmoil he had trouble keeping himself outwardly\ncalm. For the first time in more years than he could remember he merely\ntoyed with his food ... and he had always been a good trencher-man.\n\nBut he had something very important to do tonight, and he would let\nnothing keep him from it. So he went to the _Hellene's_ library and\nstudied from such books on biology and physiology as he could find, all\nhe could about the brain and the nerves that formed the connecting links\nbetween it and the muscles. He studied until the dimming of the lights\ntold him that \"day\" was over.\n\nHe then sent his mind down into the brain of the bulldog, and watched\nthrough its eyes until he saw the kennel steward leave for the night.\nThen Hanlon went down to the kennel deck.\n\nSitting on the same bench as before, Hanlon sent his mind into that of\nthe white bull. Again he had no trouble attaching a portion of his mind\nto the dog's brain. A little experimentation soon showed how much of his\nmind that brain could contain.\n\nThen, from the _inside_, he studied that brain line by line, muscle and\nnerve channels and connectors, even more surely than he had been able to\ndo before.\n\nThe first thing he learned, and put into practice, was to make the dog\nsleep, so he wouldn't tire too much. After nearly three hours of\nintensive study he was convinced he was beginning to know it quite well,\nalthough he realized how much there still was for him to learn--how much\nstudy and practice he would need.\n\nHe then woke the dog, and while still leaving that part of his mind in\nits brain, scanned the next cage which held a beautiful female Airedale.\nInto her brain he sent another portion of his mind. Then into the next\ndog another portion, and on and on until he had detached more than\nthree-quarters of his mind, and was controlling directly eight dogs.\n\nHis body felt weak and listless as it sagged on the bench, and he made\nit lie down there in the semi-darkness. There was, he was afraid at the\ntime, little more than enough mind left in his body to keep the\nsemi-automatic functions going.\n\nIt was the most weird sensation imaginable, having portions of his mind\nin nine places at once--having nine different and distinct viewpoints!\n\nHe found he could do, although not too well at first, nine different\nthings at once and the same time, or could make all the bodies he was\ncontrolling do the same thing at the same time.\n\nHe \"drilled\" the dogs, making them line up, walk left or right or back\nup, all in unison. He found that while his mind was divided and\ncontrolling different bodies, there was a thread of connecting thought\nbetween them all, so that he knew what each of the others was doing. Yet\nit was not a central command--each individual mind-portion could and did\ndo its own deciding and commanding.\n\nFor hours Hanlon practiced with the dogs until he had worked out the\nprocedure to the point where he knew he could make them perform--singly,\nas a group, or each doing a different thing--almost any task of which\ntheir body muscles were capable, whether they had previously known how\nto do it or not.\n\nBringing his mind-portions back from seven of the dogs into his own\nbrain, after commanding them to sleep, he went over to the cage of the\nAiredale he was still controlling. Squatting down before the bars, he\ntook a pencil-stub and piece of paper from his pocket. These he passed\nthrough the bars and laid at her feet.\n\nThen, while he watched with his own mind through his own eyes, he used\nonly the portion of his mind that was inside her brain, and made the\nAiredale pick up the pencil in her teeth, blunt end inside her mouth.\nHolding it thus, she attempted to write on the paper, which she held\nsteady with her two front paws.\n\nAnxious minutes passed while Hanlon sweatingly experimented. At last the\ndog managed to print, very roughly and clumsily, a few letters. They\nwere large and very crude. It wasn't that he couldn't control her\nmuscles--it was, simply that the muscles were not built to do such\nthings without infinite training.\n\nWhen it finally became so near \"morning\" that he knew he had to quit,\nHanlon left the kennels and went to bed. He was still amazed, excited\nand thrilled about this strange and weird ability, but he was also well\ncontent with his studies. If a time came when he might wish or need to\nuse animals in his work, he felt capable of managing them. Yet again he\nrealized how much there was to learn; that he must continue practicing\nand studying at every opportunity.\n\nDid cats or horses--or birds or insects--have brains that worked the\nsame as the dogs? He would have to experiment to find that out, first\nchance he got.\n\nBut now there was another very serious problem demanding his attention.\nHe had made a wonderful start at getting an \"in\" with Panek, the\nSimonidean thug. Now, how could he best turn that to his advantage?\n\nIt was some time before he fell asleep from sheer weariness, nor had he\nsolved the problem before he did so.\n\nThe moment he awoke, late the next morning, he knew he had the answer.\nHis sub-conscious must have solved it for him while he slept.\n\nAt brunch he kept his eyes open, and before too long Panek came into the\ndining room for his lunch. Hanlon signalled, and his new-found\nacquaintance came to his table. Their orders given and the waiter on his\nway, Hanlon opened up.\n\n\"Look, Pard, I don't want to butt into your business, but if you want\nthis Abrams out of your way, I'll be glad to take a crack at it for\nyou.\"\n\nThe Simonidean looked at him scornfully. \"Think you're that good, eh?\nBetter'n me at bumping off a man, huh? Better'n me?\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" Hanlon made his face seem very apologetic, and his tone the\nsame. \"I'm not setting myself even one notch ahead of you, nor\ncriticizing your way of working ...\"\n\n\"Better not, neither!\"\n\n\"... but every man has his own techniques. Look, in this case, aboard a\nship in space where you can't run or hide, I think my way would work\nbest.\"\n\nThe other was becoming interested in spite of himself, and his\ntruculence melted a bit, although his tone was still sneering. \"All\nright, Master Mind, how'd you handle it, how would you?\"\n\n\"A gun or knife is all right on some jobs,\" Hanlon leaned closer and\nspoke in a semi-whisper, but earnestly. \"But there are times when it's\nplain foolish to sneak up behind a man and hit him on the head with a\nclub.\"\n\n\"Yeah, you got something there, got something.\"\n\n\"In such a case, I figure it's a lot better to make friends with the\nguy, take him to dinner, then sneak a little cyanide in his\ncoffee--something like that.\"\n\nPanek was impressed. Hanlon read the swift thoughts racing across the\nother's mind. He hadn't liked the idea of using his knife, here on this\nship. But neither did he dare report back to that feared \"boss\" that he\nhadn't succeeded in killing Abrams.\n\nPanek spoke doubtfully. \"Yeah, that may be all right, but not when the\nguy knows you, then you can't get away with a thing like that, not when\nhe knows you.\"\n\n\"Exactly what I'm getting at,\" Hanlon said eagerly. \"Me, I'm the Unknown\nQuantity. Nobody knows me. I can get to old Abrams and make it all seem\nnatural.\"\n\n\"He ain't easy to fool, no, he ain't.\"\n\n\"I'm sure he isn't. But since I've got to make a start somewhere if I\nwant to get into things on Simonides, I figure giving you an assist is\nworth the trial.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Panek hesitated and his cold eyes bored into those of this\nenigmatic young man. \"I still don't quite trust you, can't be sure I\ntrust you. I still figure you're some kind of a cop ...\"\n\nHanlon half-rose, his face dark with intense anger. \"Don't ever call me\na cop!\" he blazed, though still in a whisper. \"I hate 'em. As a kid I\nthought they were tops, and did everything I could to get into their\nschool. But I mighty quick found out how wrong I was. I was good and\nsick of 'em, and about ready to quit when they threw me out on that lie\nabout cheating ... say, I knew more'n their knuckle-headed instructors,\nso why'd I need to cheat?\"\n\n\"Easy, Pal, take it easy.\"\n\n\"They just want to use their high and mighty authority,\" Hanlon ignored\nPanek's shushing. \"They just like to push people around 'cause they got\non a pretty uniform.\"\n\nHis voice had risen in pitch until Panek had to grab his arm and shake\nhim to make him keep still. People at the nearer table were beginning to\nlook at them. But Panek was impressed now with Hanlon's sincerity--the\nSS man could read that in his mind.\n\n\"All right, Pal, all right. Don't bust a gut. You bump off old Abrams\nwithout getting caught, and I'll get you in with a gang on Sime where\nyou can really do yourself some good, really some good.\"\n\nHanlon nodded shortly and rose. \"I'll keep in touch. And your man's as\ngood as dead right now.\"\n\nHis heart was singing--his plan was working smoothly. Now if that\ngovernment man had any brains, and would play along ...\n\nHanlon found Abrams in the library, and slipped into the seat next to\nhim. Opening a magazine and holding it fairly high before his face while\napparently reading it, Hanlon started talking in low but penetrant\ntones.\n\n\"Don't look up, Mr. Abrams, but listen to me. You may or may not know\nit, but there's a plot against your life. I managed to delay it\nyesterday, but they intended getting you before we reach port. Now I\nhave a plan. I earnestly beg you to listen and work with me.\"\n\nThe Simonidean had given a slight start when he heard Hanlon's first\nwords, but he had been well-trained in a hard school, and in no other\nway had even shown that he heard. Now, however, he spoke as guardedly as\nHanlon. \"Who is trying to kill me?\"\n\n\"A man named Panek, but someone's behind him that I don't know. But the\nquestion is: will you work with me?\"\n\n\"Yes, if I can.\"\n\nAbandoning his attempts at secrecy, Hanlon started laughing out loud, as\nthough at something he was reading. As Abrams looked up in surprise,\nHanlon leaned over and held out his magazine in front of the Simonidean,\npointing at it.\n\n\"Play up now,\" he said softly, and the diplomat, quick on the up-take,\npretended to look at what Hanlon was showing him, then began laughing in\nturn. Thereafter, the ice broken as far as any on-lookers might know,\nthe two talked naturally as shipboard acquaintances might do.\n\n\"Why,\" Abrams really looked at Hanlon for the first time, \"you're the\nyoung man who saved my life on Terra, aren't you?\"\n\n\"Yes, but keep it quiet. I want us to stick together more or less the\nrest of the day, as though we'd just met and liked each other. Then have\ndinner together. Do you have your own servant?\"\n\n\"My valet, yes, and he is absolutely trustworthy. Why?\"\n\n\"While we're eating I'll appear to put something into your drink while\nyou're not looking. A few moments later you'll act as though you were\nsuddenly taken ill, and go to your room. Have your valet later let the\nword out that you're very ill, and send word by space-video for an\nambulance to meet the ship. Just before landing, let him say you've\ndied. The ambulance can take you wherever it's natural your body would\nbe taken, and you keep under cover for some time, until I notify you.\nCan do?\"\n\n\"Hmmm.\" The other thought rapidly but cogently for some minutes. \"With a\nfew minor variations, yes. But why? ... oh, I see. You want to get in\nwith the gang, is that it?\" When Hanlon nodded Abrams continued, \"you're\nplaying a dangerous game, but that's what we've learned to expect of\nyour Corpsmen. A wonderful group!\"\n\n\"Thanks.\" Hanlon did not want to explain anything, so let it go at that,\nand the two talked companionably of many things as they moved naturally\nabout the ship. They listened for a while to a concert in the music\nroom, then played a few games of cards. Each time the diplomat tried to\nask questions, Hanlon side-stepped.\n\nThe SS man had seen Panek cautiously spying on them from time to time,\nand when the two went in to dinner the thug took a seat nearby, but\nwhere Abrams could not see him.\n\nHanlon had been probing Abrams' mind all this time, but had been unable\nto get any clue as to a plot that might upset the peace of his world, or\nthe Federation. Hanlon realized the man was an intense patriot, and he\ncame to the conclusion that Abrams did not particularly like the Prime\nMinister. But the \"why\" of that dislike eluded him.\n\nThe two were about finished with dinner and their coffee had been\nserved. Hanlon called his companion's attention to something behind him.\nAs the latter turned to look, Hanlon's hand flashed out and hovered an\ninstant over the other's cup.\n\nA few moments later the Simonidean played his part to perfection. He\ntook a drink, then another, and almost before he had set his cup down,\ngave a groan, and clutched at his stomach and throat.\n\nHe rose shakily, and tottered away heavily on the arm of an anxious\nsteward who had come running up.\n\nHanlon, although he rose quickly and made his face seem concerned and\nsympathetic, resumed his seat and finished his coffee. When the steward\nreturned, he called him over, and seemed reassured when the latter\nreported that Mr. Abrams had said it was apparently only an attack of\nindigestion, to which he was prone, and that his man could take care of\nhim.\n\nBut the next day word ran about the ship that Abrams was very ill, and\nnot expected to live the day out.\n\nPanek sauntered past where Hanlon was sitting, reading, and stopped to\nask for a light.\n\n\"Nice work, Pal, nice work,\" he whispered as he was lighting his cigaro.\n\"See me at the Bacchus.\"\n\nBut his thoughts, as Hanlon scanned them, were muttering viciously,\n\"I'll cut out his guts if he's planning to louse up 'his' plans, I'll\nsure carve him!\"\n\nAnd a bit later, as Hanlon reviewed the entire episode, he thanked his\nstars that Panek was a lot less than an intellectual giant. A brighter\nman would have wondered about the source of Hanlon's knowledge of his\nhomicidal plans; and how it happened that Hanlon carried a supply of\npoison. There had been no indication that either question had occurred\nto Panek.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 10\n\n\nThe moment he got off the ship and went into the city of New Athens he\ncould feel it. There was an air of mystery, of secretiveness, of\nintrigue, that could not help but be noticed by one as sensitive to\nemotion-impressions as SS Man George Hanlon.\n\nHe got out of his ground-cab at the entrance of a great park in the\ncenter of the city, but directed the driver to take his luggage on to\nthe hotel. Then Hanlon went in to sit on a bench beneath a beautiful,\nflowering ba'amba tree.\n\nOnce there, he opened his mind to its fullest extent, and let all the\nimpressions and sensations of this new world soak in. He could not, of\ncourse, get any factual details in this way, nor did he expect to. What\nhe wanted, and began to get, was the \"feel\" of the city. And the longer\nhe sat the less he liked it.\n\nFor he could sense so clearly that there most certainly was \"a Mercutian\nin the fuel pit\" here somewhere. But what it was; what this strange\nfeeling portended, he could not quite make out.\n\nHe noticed, casually, that there were the usual idlers in this park, and\nhundreds of children with their nurses or parents. But there were none\nof the derelicts one sees in so many large-city parks. Most of the\npeople seemed well-dressed and not too poor. He could catch occasional\nbits of thought about big business deals.\n\nAfter a time Hanlon noticed that here, as in most parks, hundreds of\nnative, pigeon-like birds were flying and hopping about, seeking what\ncrumbs they could scrounge from picnickers' lunches, or nuts fed them by\ninterested idlers.\n\nHe wondered if he could get into a bird's mind, and sent his out to\ncontact one. His ability was, he found, much the same as it had been\nwith the dogs--he could not only \"read\" what mind the pigeon had, but\ncould control it ... could actually project part of his mind into the\nbird's brain.\n\nThe brain-texture, was different, but as he sat there for another hour,\nhe learned the difference. For now he knew what to look for, and it did\nnot take long until he knew it well. Finally he got so he could see and\nunderstand what the people around him were doing--not through his own\ndirect observation, but through the pigeon's senses. He sent several\nwinging high into the air, and got a good perspective of the entire\ncity.\n\nAt last he brought his mind back into his own brain, and gave a mental\nshrug, then rose from the bench.\n\n\"You're just stalling, you know,\" he scolded himself. \"Get to the hotel,\ncheck in, then go look in the bank vault. You've got a job to do, so get\ndoing it!\"\n\nFrom the hotel he went to the bank and signed up for a box. There was\nnothing yet for him in box 1044, so he left a note addressed \"To Any SS\nMan,\" stating he was here and ready to begin his work.\n\nBack at the hotel he unpacked, took a shower, and then a short nap.\nThere was no telling what the night might bring forth, and he wanted all\nhis strength and powers.\n\nNew Athens was a beautiful city, as befitted the capitol of the richest\nplanet in the Federation. For Simonides Four had become just that, even\noutstripping Terra in the wealth from her manufacturers and exports. Her\nshipments of ores, jewels, unusual furs, manufactured goods, precision\ntools and art products, as well as foodstuffs raw and processed, ran\ninto trillions of credits every year.\n\nThe great square showed plainly that some architect or city planner with\na love of classic lines had been in charge here. The buildings were all\nmodern representations of the great temples and public buildings of the\nGolden Age of Greece on Terra. They were widely spaced, with magnificent\nlawns and gardens surrounding each.\n\nThousands of lights artfully concealed accentuated the beauty of those\nwonderful buildings, and Hanlon caught his breath in pleasure at his\nfirst sight of the marvelous square by night. He had thought it\nwonderful by day--now he admitted without reservation that it was the\nmost magnificent sight he had ever seen.\n\nHe finally signalled a ground-cab--New Athens had no slideways--to go to\nthe Bacchus. It was several blocks from the square, but each of the\nstreets he travelled were almost as beautiful.\n\nThe tavern was housed in a large though one-storied building with a\npillared facade. The main room was level with a gardened terrace five\nsteps above the street.\n\nInside, the tavern was tastefully decorated in subdued colors. It was\ndimly lighted by representations of flambeaus, stuck at angles in the\nwalls. The center of the room was occupied by dozens of tables of\nvarying sizes, while along one side and part of the back were curtained\nbooths. Along the other side ran an ornate bar.\n\nHanlon made his way to the latter, and sat on one of the upholstered\nstools. The bar girls, he noted with interest, were revealingly costumed\nin pseudo-peplos of a purplish, cob-webby, silkish material. They wore\nno blouses, but long sashes that passed behind the neck, crossed the\nbreasts and tied about the waist to hold up the short skirt. One of the\ngirls came up to get his order.\n\n\"I'm new on the planet,\" he smiled. \"Let me have your best native light\nwine.\"\n\nShe brought him a glass filled with a sparkling, golden liquid, and\nwaited while he took his first appreciative sip. \"We call it 'Golden\nNectar',\" she smiled.\n\nHe smacked his lips. \"Wonderful!\" Then, as she started away he called\nher back. \"Do you know a Mr. Panek? I was to meet him here, but I don't\nsee him.\"\n\nHer eyes widened a bit at that name. \"I'll see if I can locate him for\nyou, sir,\" and she moved away.\n\nSome minutes later, while he was still pretending to sip his drink,\nHanlon felt a hearty clap on the shoulder.\n\n\"Well, well, it's my pal from the ship. Welcome to Sime, Pal, welcome to\nSime.\"\n\n\"Hi, Panek! Hope you meant that about looking you up, 'cause here I am.\"\n\nHanlon flipped a credit note on the bar and followed Panek. He was led\ntoward a back corner, but there, instead of going into one of the\nbooths, Panek pushed through an almost hidden alcove. He knocked\npeculiarly on a door, and a peephole was opened. When the guardian saw\nwho it was, the door was opened enough so the two could slide through.\n\nHanlon, in a quick, comprehensive glance, saw that it was a fairly large\noffice, at present occupied by four men.\n\n\"This is George Hanlon,\" Panek introduced him, \"the guy who did that job\non old Abrams, the same guy.\"\n\nHanlon noticed that Panek did not name the men there, but he could see\nthey appeared to know all about him, and were giving him a close\nonce-over. Hanlon scanned back in return, his mind quickly touching one\nafter another of the three sitting in large, easy chairs. Only their\nsurface thoughts were readable, and he knew at first touch they were but\nunderlings, the same as Panek. He read a favorable impression of\nhimself, but with reservations.\n\nHe turned his attention to the well-dressed, impressive-looking man\nbehind the plasticene desk, nor had his other probings taken more than a\nfew seconds. He noted with interest the round, smooth face, the slightly\nover-large greenish eyes, the silver hair that seemed finer and silkier\nthan any Hanlon had ever seen on a human being. It was almost like fine\nfur, he thought suddenly.\n\nThen he got a shock! This man was different ... Hanlon could not touch\nthat mind at all! There was a sort of an ... an alien feeling there he\ncould not quite fathom. It was like no other mind he had ever tried to\nread.\n\nBut he was careful not to let his face show anything of his inner\nthoughts as he saluted them gravely after that first brief pause.\n\nThen suddenly he made his face show a boyish enthusiasm ... almost a\nnaivete. \"Maybe Mr. Panek has already told you about me. I'm looking for\na chance to make a flock of credits ... and I'm not too particular how I\nget 'em.\"\n\nBut his mind was tense and anxious. What was their game? And this fellow\nbehind the desk, this leader. Who was he? Hanlon knew he would have a\nreal job finding out those answers ... but knew he must!\n\nThe leader nodded suavely. \"That is a very ... uh ... commendable\ndesire,\" he said in a low, gentle voice that was a perfect match for his\noutward appearance of high gentility. \"We can always use a good man,\" he\ncontinued, \"who isn't afraid ... nor too squeamish.\"\n\n\"A trigger-man?\" Hanlon shrugged. \"If it pays well, okay.\"\n\nThe man seemed to recoil, his delicate hands fluttering in the air\nalmost femininely. \"No, no, my dear young man. You misunderstood me\nentirely. We do nothing so crude, so vulgar, so ... so brutal.\nOh, sometimes we ... uh ... sometimes an accident happens to\nsomeone. But nothing, you understand, that we have anything to\ndo with. Your technique with the poor Mr. Abrams, who was so suddenly\ntaken ... ill ... had led me to hope you had more finesse.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" Hanlon's tone was now one of apology. \"I can\nfinesse, all right, but I didn't know you wanted me to talk that way in\nprivate. I'll remember, and respect your wishes from now on.\"\n\nInwardly he was puzzled. He kept trying to touch that mind, but could\nnot. Was the guy human--or did he have a mind-control of some sort? Was\nhe used to mind-reading, so that he had developed a defense against it?\n\nOr--and Hanlon almost caught his breath in momentary fear--was this ape\na mind reader? A real one, not a dub like himself?\n\nBut the leader was answering, still in that gentle tone, as though\nnothing had happened. \"So ... so ... that is good. I hate the thought of\nbloodshed, and I will not countenance roughness in actions or speech. It\nis regrettable, of course, that sometimes men are stupid enough to\noppose us, but ...\" and again that almost feminine gesture.\n\nThis was the silkiest, slimiest ... _thing_ ... George Hanlon had ever\nencountered, and again his heart quailed for the moment. \"If I was on my\nown,\" he shuddered inwardly, \"I'd sure never team up with a guy like\nthat!\"\n\nFor there was no single iota of mercy or compassion in that ice-cold\nmind behind that gentle face--of that Hanlon was sure.\n\nThere was a long, pregnant moment of silence, while the five men studied\nHanlon more carefully. Finally the man behind the desk spoke more\nslowly. \"Perhaps--just perhaps, you understand, and nothing definite as\nyet--we may have a little job for you before long. On another planet.\nYou have no objections to travel?\"\n\n\"Not if there's a bundle of the stuff at the end of the trip, no,\"\nHanlon grinned avariciously. But his mind was seeking answers. Why did\nthey want to send him away? Was this a bona-fide job, or a trap? Should\nhe go to some other planet? Would he thus get best leads? Perhaps--if it\nwasn't for too long a time, of course.\n\nThe leader smiled suddenly while Hanlon was thus thinking, and the rest\ngrinned as though they had been waiting for his lead to relax their\nvigilance. \"There will be a very large ... uh ... bundle.\" He paused a\nmoment, then continued \"We need more overseers on ... a certain planet.\nIt is one that is rich in various metals. The natives mine it under our\ndirection, and ...\"\n\nHanlon interrupted. \"I don't know a thing about mining. Will that make a\ndifference?\" Here, he thought swiftly, was the test. If they still\nwanted him--and had a reasonable answer--it might well be a bona-fide\njob.\n\n\"None at all,\" the leader smiled again. \"We have mining engineers in\ncharge. Your job would be merely to keep the natives working at top\nspeed. It is ... uh ... unfortunate, that they are high enough in the\ncultural scale so we cannot, under the Snyder dictum, colonize their\nplanet and work it ourselves. But we will chan ...\" he broke off as\nthough realizing he was saying too much, and Hanlon stiffened inwardly.\n\nThis was a real clue. What planet was the man talking about? His most\npenetrant mind-probing could not get the answer from any of the minds\nthere--to the others it was merely \"a planet,\" nothing more. And this\nape, with his perfect mental control, let nothing leak.\n\nBut the leader had caught himself and gone on almost as though there had\nbeen no break, \"... chance using you, I think. If so, your salary will\nbe a thousand credits a month, plus all expenses. And a nice bonus every\nso often, depending on how little trouble you have with your crew, and\nhow much ore they take out.\"\n\nHanlon showed that gleam of avarice again. \"Sounds very interesting.\"\nThen he leaned forward. \"One, more thing. How long does the job last?\"\n\n\"For several years, if you want it, and if we continue to be satisfied\nwith you. But we bring the men back every few months for a vacation. We\nfind that best with most of them--the climate there is not too pleasant,\nand the conditions are confining.\"\n\n\"Nothing to do but work, eh?\"\n\n\"Just about that. The shifts are about eight hours of our time, and\nbetween them you eat, sleep, read or play cards ... but you do not\nexplore or anything like that! The ship goes there every three weeks,\nand we usually figure eighteen weeks there, then the three weeks back\nhere. The guards and others rotate that way. They have a tendency\nto ... uh ... deteriorate if we don't.\"\n\nHanlon let himself shiver, but grinned as he did so. \"Now that's one\nthing I don't want to do--go nuts. Can't make any credits doing that.\"\n\nThe leader raised his hand. \"You understand, of course, there will be a\nshort period of ... uh ... checking and testing before we decide to send\nyou out on a job.\"\n\nHanlon's voice was almost servile, yet confident. \"Sure, sir. You name\nit; I do it.\"\n\nHe was still probing with everything he had, but still getting nothing\nimportant. A couple of the men seemed to be chuckling about what might\nhappen to him if he failed the tests--but he had guessed that much,\nanyway.\n\nSuddenly the leader leaned across the desk, and his genteel manner\nslipped from him like a discarded mask. His eyes became glacial ice.\n\n\"Don't get any grandiose ideas in your head, Hanlon. We are not fools.\nNor are we offering you a chance to get in on our complete plans. I am\njust, possibly, hiring you to do a simple job.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, sir, I wasn't even thinking of such a thing,\" Hanlon\nlooked hurt. \"Why, I'm just a kid. I know I couldn't expect anything\nelse ... at first. Not until I've proved myself to you, or until I've\nmade my pile and got in a position of power. Then, naturally, I'd want\nto get into something where I could really go places. But that's for\nyears and years ahead, I know that.\"\n\nThe now-hard, cold eyes scrutinized him carefully, but still doubtfully.\nWhen the leader spoke his voice was more cordial, though still harder,\nnot soft as it had been at first.\n\n\"I'll be frank, Hanlon. We're not too sure of you ... yet ... because\nyou were a cadet. Oh, we know,\" as Hanlon started to protest hotly, \"all\nabout your being kicked out. We can see how all that might well have\nsoured you enough so you will really do anything you can to get ahead,\neven if only to show the Corps. But you can understand our hesitation, I\nthink.\"\n\n\"Of course, sir. But you needn't worry.\" He made his voice as bitter and\nhard as he could. \"I've had my fill of all that law and order stuff. I\nwas an innocent young punk, full of high ideals and the romance of the\nCorps and all that bunk. But those mangy slime-snakes knocked all that\nout of me. Anything I can do that'll give 'em a kick in the teeth I'll\ndo with joy and gusto!\"\n\n\"Fine words,\" snapped the leader, \"but can you take it if the going gets\ntough?\"\n\nHanlon was learning fast. Now he stared straight back into those hard\neyes.\n\n\"Can you dish it out, Mister?\" his tone was almost, but not quite,\ninsolent.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 11\n\n\nA black look suffused the leader's face at Hanlon's impertinent \"can you\ndish it out, Mister?\" He half-rose from his seat, while the other four\nmen reached quick hands towards their weapons.\n\nThen slowly the man sank back, relaxed, and smiled--an open, friendly\nsmile of genuine cordiality, and his men also relaxed.\n\n\"You'll do, Hanlon, by the great ... uh ... Zeus, you'll do! But,\" he\nadded significantly, \"I think you will find that I can 'dish it out', as\nyou call it, if the need ever arises. You had better pray it never\ndoes.\"\n\n\"Fair enough,\" Hanlon shrugged indifferently.\n\n\"The boys will take you out and show you the town, if you like,\" the\nleader smiled engagingly. \"They will get word to you when I have a job\nready, which may be in a day or two.\"\n\nHanlon thanked him, and felt it policy to go out with \"the boys,\" even\nthough he did not particularly care to do so. Nor did he especially\nenjoy the night that followed.\n\nHe had left a ten o'clock call with the hotel's visiphone operator when\nhe got back to the hotel at last. When she called he groggily opened one\neye half way, and fumbled for the toggle-switch.\n\n\"H'lo.\"\n\n\"Ten o'clock of a fine morning, Mr. Hanlon.\"\n\n\"Oh, no!\" he groaned.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" she giggled. \"That bad, is it?\"\n\n\"Worse'n that. But thanks anyway ... I guess.\"\n\nShe was laughing heartily as she disconnected.\n\nHanlon groaned with the utter misery of a hugely-distorted, throbbing\nhead. The sunlight pouring through an open window directly into his eyes\ndid not help any. He rolled over petulantly, but knew he had to get up.\n\nHe stumbled out of bed and went in to stand under a cold shower. Ten\nminutes later he began to feel a little more human, and decided maybe he\nwould live after all.\n\n\"Never again!\" he swore fervently. \"I'm just not cut out for serious\ndrinking. Hope I didn't give anything away to those guys last night.\"\n\nHe dressed slowly, meanwhile striving as best his aching head would let\nhim, to review his situation. He was fairly well pleased with his\nsuccess to date, but the grue of fear was still with him. He was getting\npart way where he wanted to be, but ... this was certainly no picnic he\nwas muscling into. He remembered his father's injunction to take it easy\nat first, and grimaced wrily.\n\nEating breakfast in the hotel dining room, after taking an effervescent\nto relieve his headache, he tried to plan his next moves. There wasn't\nmuch he could do, he decided, until they called him. He had made his\nbid--it wouldn't do to try to push himself too much, or it would look\nmighty fishy to those sharp minds.\n\nHe shuddered again, involuntarily, thinking about that enigmatic leader.\nWho ... or what ... was he?\n\nHanlon went first to the bank, and made out a card for his own box. But\nonce in the vault, and the attendant gone out, it was box 1044 he\nopened. There was a note for him.\n\n\"Welcome to Simonides,\" he read. \"My name--here--is Art Georgopoulis. I\nwork at present as a bartender at the Golden Web, on Thermopylae street.\nThe high-ups in the underworld hang out there, and I pick up occasional\nbits of news. If you come in, introduce yourself by asking for 'a good\nold Kentucky mint-julep,' Practically no one ever asks for those. I'm\nthe blond, skinny one at the far end of the bar. If I can be of any\nhelp, just yell. Me, I haven't got to first check station yet--but I'm\nstill in there punching. Hope you do better--Curt Hooper.\"\n\nHanlon \"ate\" the note, then wrote one of his own, telling what he had\nlearned to date, what he suspicioned, and what he was trying to do. Of\nhis new mental powers he said nothing. He did not distrust this SS man,\nof course, but if the fellow didn't know he couldn't be made to tell.\n\nAs Hanlon left the bank he began to get the feeling he was being\ntrailed, but could not seem to locate anyone doing it, although he did\nnot dare search to his rear very carefully. Neither could he catch any\ndefinite thoughts about such a thing from among the welter of\nthought-sensations on the crowded streets.\n\nHe wandered about most of the day, frankly sight-seeing--but his mind\nwas always open. He went into various public buildings, sat for some\ntime in one or another of the numerous parks whenever he felt a bit\ntired of walking.\n\nThat feeling of being watched made him cautious, so he did not practice\nmuch with his mind-control on any of the pigeon-like birds! He did,\nhowever, make a trip to the local zoo, and as he paused momentarily in\nfront of each of the cages to look at the exhibit it contained, he\nbriefly made an excursion into the mind of each different type of\nanimal, bird or rodent. Outside of minor differences of texture, they\nall seemed about the same. Each of them had, naturally, different\nmuscular abilities that would need considerable study if he ever\nintended using one of them.\n\nAnd every minute he was seeking, searching for any tiniest thread of\nevidence as to what it was that was causing this undercurrent of secret\nintrigue that was so plainly evident to his super-sensitive mind.\n\nBut there was no factual data to be learned. Only that \"feel\" of it in\nthe very air. Yet as the day wore on he came to believe that much or\nmost of what he sensed was not that plot which was causing the Corps\nconcern. Rather, it seemed more as though all the people here were\nengaged in some sort of secret aggressiveness.\n\nAnd it was finally forced into his consciousness that it was \"business,\"\nnot \"politics.\" For it was well-known that Simonides, even though it had\nbecome the Federation's wealthiest world, was not yet satisfied ... that\nits merchants and traders wanted to capture more and still more of the\nSystem's business.\n\nThere were far too many minds engaged in aggressive thoughts for a\npolitical revolution, he felt sure. If it was this wide-spread, surely\nothers of the Corps of the Secret Service would have found out something\ndefinite about it. No, whatever this was, it distinctly was not what he\nwas here to find.\n\nThe feeling that he was being spied upon was always more or less\npresent, but he could not spot the man or men who were watching him.\nEither several were working in short shifts, or else the trailer kept so\nfar behind him that the multiplicity of thoughts from the hundreds of\npeople always around masked those of the spy.\n\nHanlon ate a leisurely lunch in a small restaurant, and during the\nafternoon continued his apparently-aimless sight-seeing. If they were\nshadowing him, they would have nothing to report, he grinned. Not during\nthe day, at least. What the evening would bring forth would perhaps be\nanother matter.\n\nFor he had determined to at least get in touch with the SS man who had\nwritten that note. He would have dinner at the Golden Web, if they\nserved meals. If not, he would have a drink anyway. The two men\ncertainly should know each other by sight.\n\nHe went briefly to the hotel, but there had been no calls for him. So he\ntook a ground-cab to the cafe, which turned out to be a pretentious,\ngarish one. Inside he made his way to that part of the long, busy bar\npresided over by a slim, blond man.\n\nHanlon climbed onto a stool. \"Gimme a good old Kentucky mint-julep,\nsuh,\" he demanded, \"an' be doggoned suah it's made right.\"\n\nThe bartender eyed him peculiarly. \"Where's this Kentucky and what's a\nmint-julep?\"\n\n\"On Terra, of course, where I came from. Where'd you think it was, on\nAndromeda Seven?\"\n\n\"Pardon me, sir. I seem to remember now, having heard of such a drink.\nI'll have to look it up in the recipe-book--I disremember the\ningredients.\"\n\nHanlon grinned and lost his appearance of truculence. \"It's partly made\nof Blue Grass, like a 'horse's neck.' But if it's too much trouble, just\ngive me a Cola.\"\n\nThe barkeep grinned, too. \"I gotcha, Steve,\" and poured out the soft\ndrink.\n\nHanlon sat sipping his innocuous drink, looking about him quietly. A\nlarge-sized crowd was beginning to fill the place--well-dressed,\nevidently fairly prosperous people, but he could see that they were not\nthe real upper-class, but the slightly-off-shade climbers.\n\nHis drink finished Hanlon signalled his friendly barman. \"The grub here\nany good? This looks like a nice place.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is. One often hears some interesting things here. As for the\nfood, it is very good, and not too expensive. They have a native fowl\nmuch like chicken I think you'd like. Ask for _poyka_, in whatever style\nyou like it fixed. Glad to be of service, sir, any time, in any way.\"\nThe last words were slightly emphasized.\n\nHanlon had ordered and was waiting for his food when a man he had never\nseen before slipped into the seat opposite him.\n\n\"The Boss wants to see you.\"\n\n\"Yeah?\" Hanlon looked him up and down almost contemptuously. \"Just who\nis this 'boss' who's interested in me?\"\n\n\"Cut the clowning. You know who. At the Bacchus. Now!\"\n\n\"So.\" Hanlon let himself appear slightly interested. \"Well, after I get\nthrough eating, if nothing else shows up to interest me more, I might\ndrop over.\"\n\n\"You'd better, and mighty quick, too!\" the man snapped, although it was\napparent he was puzzled by Hanlon's manner. \"He don't like to be kept\nwaiting.\"\n\n\"And I don't like to be hurried--or ordered about!\" Hanlon snapped back.\n\"If I come, and notice I said 'if,' I'll be there in about an hour. Now,\ndo you mind? I like to enjoy my food.\"\n\nThe man rose, still with that perplexed expression. It was evident he\nwas not used to people not jumping when his \"Boss\" issued\ninvitations--which were really commands. He shook his head slowly. \"I\nhope for your sake he's in a good humor,\" he said as he left.\n\nHanlon's mind was not too easy as he ate swiftly, and his relish of the\nexcellent food was not as keen as it might have been but for this\ninterruption. He shivered, remembering that cold ruthlessness he had\nsensed behind that leader's suave manner. But he had to play out his\nstring as a somewhat brash youngster who wasn't afraid of anybody or\nanything. He had made a clean score with that reckless \"can you dish it\nout, Mister?\" but he had better not press his luck too far.\n\nThus it was only about half an hour later when he presented himself at\nthe Bacchus.\n\n\"You took your time coming,\" the leader looked at Hanlon curiously.\n\n\"I was hungry,\" Hanlon answered simply. \"I'd just ordered dinner when\nyour message was delivered. I came as soon as I'd finished.\"\n\n\"Those who work for me usually ... uh ... come running when I call.\"\n\nHanlon grinned wolfishly. \"Maybe they're afraid of you.\"\n\n\"And you aren't?\"\n\n\"Should I be?\"\n\n\"I don't like impudence or insolence,\" the voice was more curt and the\neyes lost some of their calmness in a flash of anger.\n\nHanlon knew he had gone far enough for the time being, so instantly\nbecame less brash, more apologetic.\n\n\"If I take your job if you offer me one, sir, I'll obey all orders\npromptly, and I'll give you everything I've got, naturally. But I'm not\none of your snivelling toadies.\"\n\nThe leader regarded him once more with silent appraisal, in which a\nmeasure of respect, or at least approval, seemed to show. Hanlon,\nprobing the other minds present, was secretly amused at their\nastonishment at his temerity ... and the fact that he was getting away\nwith it.\n\nAfter long moments the leader nodded his head, as though he had reached\na decision.\n\n\"What were you doing in the bank this morning?\"\n\n\"Why, just depositing some of my stuff in a safety deposit box,\" he\nsaid, surprised. \"Why?\"\n\n\"How did you get your own box so quickly?\"\n\n\"What do you mean so quickly? I went in yesterday and asked if one was\navailable, and the girl clerk signed me up for it, and said I could get\nentry today.\"\n\n\"Oh, I see. I was told it was done like you already had a box\nand ... uh ... wondered about it.\"\n\nHanlon reached in his pocket and threw a key onto the desk \"Go look in\nit for yourself if you think it's important. And incidentally,\" he said\ncontemptuously, \"I've known all day long I was being shadowed.\" But was\ninstantly sorry he had said that last.\n\nFor there came a deadly coldness in the leader's tone, and a gleam in\nthose hard eyes that boded ill for someone. \"I see. Well, let it pass.\"\nHe pushed the key back toward Hanlon, who pocketed it thankfully. His\nbluff had worked. This was the key to his own box, of course; his master\nkey was in a hidden pocket in the cuff of his trousers.\n\nThe leader sank back into his chair and was silent for long minutes,\nthinking deeply, while Hanlon waited patiently, still trying to get some\nglimmering of thought from that unreadable mind, still frustrated almost\nto the point of despair that he couldn't.\n\nFinally the man spoke, but not to Hanlon. \"Panek, you and the others go\nfind Rellos and bring him here.\"\n\nWhen they were alone, the leader leaned forward and spoke earnestly\nto Hanlon, yet watching him carefully as he did so. \"I like you,\nHanlon, and I'm going to test you out. I am not too sure of you, yet,\nbut if I become so, you can go far--very, very far with me. This\nRellos I sent for is the man who was shadowing you today. I cannot--I\n_will not_!\" he spat venomously, \"abide failure or incompetence. I am\nassigning you the pleasant little task of seeing that some sort of\nan ... uh ... accident happens to Rellos. And as I think about it, it\nmight as well be a ... uh ... permanent one.\"\n\nHanlon's stomach curled up so tightly it hurt, but he strove manfully\nnot to let his feelings show in his face. He'd had an instant's inkling\nof what the proposal was going to be, and it was a measure of his\nstability that he succeeded in keeping his mask up.\n\nHe knew starkly that this time he would have to go through with a\nkilling, or else give up this line of research. For he knew that if he\ndid not kill this man, this way was closed to him. And if he dropped\nout, but gave the tip to some other SS man, that one would eventually\nface the same sort of a task. So, much as it sickened him even to\ncontemplate it, it now became a _must_! He would have to think of\nhimself as a soldier in war, and Rellos an enemy.\n\nOutwardly calm, he shrugged indifferently. \"Any guy that can't produce\nisn't worth keeping,\" he said. \"Any special way you want it done?\"\n\n\"No ... I think I would like to see how you work. Plan it yourself. But\nif it isn't done, you had better not let me or my men see you again.\"\n\n\"Fair enough. If I can't do a simple job like that I sure can't be of\nenough value to you to do myself any real good.\"\n\nThey were silent again, but Hanlon's mind was bleak with what was to\ncome. He wasn't the killer type--he believed in the sacredness of human\nlife. Yet he knew he would have to steel himself to go through with it.\nThe job was more important than one man's life. But to kill in cold\nblood--a deliberate, planned-out murder!\n\nJust then Panek returned with a slender, middle-aged man.\n\n\"Ah, Rellos,\" the leader greeted him. \"I want you to meet a new member\nof our group, George Hanlon. He has just come from Terra, and has never\nbeen on Simonides before. I would like you to take him out and show him\nNew Athens and what it contains in the way of pleasures. You can turn in\nan account of your expenses tomorrow.\"\n\nAnd _that_, thought Hanlon, was just about as low and slimy a trick as\nhe had ever heard, and the thought came and would not be denied, that if\nit was this leader he was to kill he could do it cheerfully and with a\nclear conscience.\n\nHe rose, though, and smiled as he held out his hand. \"Glad to know you,\nRellos. It'll be fun comparing your amusements with those of Terra.\"\n\nThe man was somewhat sullen, although it was plain he did not dare show\nit too much before their boss. Hanlon could read enough from the new\nman's mind to know how deathly afraid he was of the leader, and how he\nhated him.\n\n\"Wonder why he's in this, feeling that way?\" Hanlon thought swiftly, and\nduring the evening tried to find out, but without success--the man\nsteered clear of any such thoughts.\n\nAs the two went outside, the Simonidean asked curtly, \"Wine, women or\nsong?\"\n\n\"Why not some of all three?\" Hanlon laughed lightly. \"Anything you think\nwould be a lively evening, and that you'd enjoy.\"\n\nThe other unbent a little. \"We'll go to the Phobos first, then. They\nhave good liquor and a nice floor show. Good looking wenches who don't\nwear too much.\"\n\nHe hailed a ground-cab, which the two entered.\n\nHanlon couldn't enjoy that evening. In the first place, he couldn't\nditch all his drinks--and he hated alcohol--yet had to remain as sober\nas possible. Second, and most disturbing, was that horrible thing he had\nto do, and he knew it must be carefully planned. A gun, knife or poison\ncouldn't be used now--it must look so much like an accident that no\npossible blame could be attached to him; so that the police could not\nhold him even for a short time.\n\nHe thought of and discarded one plan after another, then remembered\nsomething seen during his wanderings--a pedestrian bridge crossing a\nhigh-speed truckway where the inter-city freighters were so numerous\nthey ran almost bumper to bumper. \"I'll lead him up there, then throw\nhim over and down. He's sure to be run over and killed.\"\n\nThe nakedness of the girls at the Phobos, the coarse jokes of the\nso-called comedians, the raucous, ribald laughter of the drunken patrons\ndisgusted Hanlon, and he was glad when they left.\n\n\"Let's walk a bit and see the sights,\" he suggested, and Rellos agreed\nafter some argument--he wanted to visit more night clubs.\n\nThey had walked a couple of blocks along a residential street when a\nlittle, roly-poly puppy waddled out onto the sidewalk to greet them.\n\n\"What a cute ...\" Hanlon began, but with an oath, Rellos savagely and\nviciously kicked the little mite, sending it howling with pain across\nthe low hedge.\n\nA growl of anguish broke out, and Hanlon sent his mind searching for\nthat deeper note. He found it, the mother dog, and was instantly inside\nthat mind, controlling it.\n\nWith a leap the huge shepherd was over the hedge, straight at Rellos.\nThe dog's weight bore the man backward, fighting for his life, trying to\nhold back those gleaming fangs straining for his throat.\n\nHanlon threw himself into the melee, but while ostensibly trying to drag\nthe dog away, delayed the few seconds it took for those slashing fangs\nto rip out Rellos' throat.\n\nPeople came running up, and as the first reached the spot they saw\nHanlon struggling to hold back the snarling, blood-flecked dog, while\nRellos lay dead in a pool of blood.\n\nThe dog's owner rushed up and snapped a leash on the dog.\n\n\"I'm terribly sorry, sir,\" Hanlon said. \"My companion was drunk and\nkicked her puppy. She merely avenged it.\"\n\n\"I wondered,\" the man was shaken. \"Kaiserina never was vicious before.\"\n\n\"I don't think she will be again,\" Hanlon said soothingly. \"Is the puppy\nall right?\" he asked the small boy who came up with the little animal\ncradled in his arms.\n\n\"No,\" the boy sobbed, \"Fluffy's dead.\"\n\n\"What's going on here?\" an authoritative voice said, and two policemen\npushed their way through the quickly-gathered crowd.\n\nThe dog's owner explained in swift words, and completely exonerated\nHanlon. \"This man tried to stop my dog; he was holding her back when I\ngot here,\" and others corroborated his statement.\n\n\"You'd better have the dog killed,\" the policeman said, but Hanlon\nintervened.\n\n\"No, she was just striking back at the man who killed her puppy. She\nwasn't to blame, and I'm sure she isn't vicious.\"\n\nThe police were finally satisfied, and while they were calling the\ndead-wagon Hanlon walked slowly back to his hotel, his heart still sick\nbut consoled a bit.\n\n\"He had it coming to him,\" his thought was bitter. \"The rotten\nbeast--kicking a little puppy like that!\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter 12\n\n\nThe next evening Hanlon went back to the Bacchus. Instead of stopping at\nthe bar he went directly to the back room and knocked on the door.\n\nWhen the peephole opened he asked, \"The Boss in?\"\n\n\"Nope.\"\n\n\"I've got a report to make.\"\n\n\"Wait at the bar. I'll get in touch.\"\n\nA quarter hour later the man summoned him, and upon entering that\nnow-familiar room Hanlon saw a closet door was standing open, disclosing\na visiphone screen, on which the leader's face was visible.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Yep.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" There was a quick intake of breath, and a feral gleam in those\ngreenish eyes. A moment's silence, then \"Do you still want that\noverseer's job?\"\n\n\"For a thousand a month and keep? Definitely!\"\n\n\"Very well, we'll try you. Zeller will give you a list of things you'll\nneed there--special clothing and such. Uh ... got any money to buy those\nyou don't have?\"\n\n\"I will have when you pay me Rellos' expense money for last night.\"\n\nThe leader's eyes narrowed in sudden anger. \"Don't try my patience too\nfar, Hanlon.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Hanlon shrugged indifferently. \"But I never figured you for a\ncheapskate.\"\n\nThere was a gasp, as though the leader was amazed at Hanlon's temerity.\nBut he quickly gained control of himself, and an instant later began\nsmiling, then grinning and finally laughing aloud ... at himself.\n\n\"By Zeus, Hanlon, I like you! Nobody else ever dared talk up to me like\nthat. You win. Tell Zeller ... no, put him on, I'll tell him ... Zeller,\ngive Hanlon the list of things needed for the mine-guard job, and pay\nhim a hundred credits, charged to the 'accident fund'. Tell him to be\nhere, all packed to go, at thirteen o'clock.\" He started to turn the set\noff, then, as he heard Hanlon ask \"Anything else now?\" faced the screen\nagain.\n\n\"Not unless you want to make rounds with the boys again. It will be some\ntime before you can have any night-life.\"\n\nHanlon made a sign of distaste and shook his head. \"Unh-uh, thanks. Two\nbig-heads in a row will last me for plenty time. I'll go get some\nshut-eye.\"\n\nThe leader smiled companionably. \"The rest might be best, for you'll\nhave a rather rough trip. You'll ride a freighter, not a luxury liner.\"\n\n\"Do I ask where I'm going?\"\n\n\"Does it matter?\"\n\nHanlon shrugged. \"Not especially. Just curiosity.\"\n\n\"Then it won't particularly bother you if we ... uh ... keep your\ndestination a secret for a while?\"\n\n\"Not in the least, if you want it that way,\" he yawned indifferently.\nBut his mind was so anxious he had trouble not letting it show in his\nface or eyes. How was he to get that location? He thought swiftly, and\nconceived a possibility.\n\n\"Your bar here serve Cola?\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"A soft drink very popular on Terra and many other planets. I'd like to\ntake a case with me, if it's allowed.\"\n\n\"I see no reason against it. I never heard of it, but you might ask the\nbargirls.\"\n\n\"I can get it at the Golden Web if you don't have it here. I had some\nthere the other night.\"\n\nHe watched carefully but there was no sign of suspicion; the leader did\nnot even seem interested.\n\nHanlon blanked the screen, got the list and money from Zeller, and\nwalked out. The Bacchus did not stock Cola, so he took a ground-cab to\nthe Golden Web.\n\nPretending half-drunkenness, he walked in and ordered the case of drink\nfrom his colleague. While drinking a glass of it, he talked in more or\nless garrulous tones. In between unimportant words he informed the SS\nman bartender that he was leaving the next noon for another planet whose\nname and location he hadn't yet been able to learn.\n\n\"Got a good boss, though,\" he mumbled thickly. \"Very good boss--sure he\nknows a lot. Headquarters at the Bacchus.\"\n\nHooper, quick of understanding as all SS men have to be, merely said\naloud the conventional \"Safe Flights,\" but Hanlon knew he would do\neverything he could to get that planetary information.\n\nAnd Hanlon was well content as he went to the hotel and to bed. What\ncould be done, had been done.\n\nAs soon as he had breakfasted the next morning, Hanlon checked out of\nhis hotel, then went out and purchased the special clothing and other\nitems on his list. With everything packed in traveling cases, he\npresented himself at the Bacchus just before thirteen o'clock.\n\nAs he got out of the cab, and gave orders to the doorman about keeping\nhis luggage until he was ready to leave, Hanlon was heartened to see\nHooper, apparently reading a newsheet, leaning against the\nterrace-facade nearby.\n\nIn the back room the leader and three others, including the ubiquitous\nPanek, were waiting for him. He was handed an envelope.\n\n\"When you arrive, give these credentials to Peter Philander, the\nsuperintendent. He will be your boss there. Just do as he says, don't\nget nosey about what is going on, and you will do all right.\"\n\n\"Don't worry about my keeping my nose clean. I'm taking along a dozen\nextra hankies.\"\n\nHis last doubts about leaving Simonides to go to the unknown planet were\nnow at rest. He was sure that there he would find the leads he so\ndesperately needed--and probably only there could he get them.\n\nThey picked up his luggage, then all got into a large, black ground-car,\nand as it started the men lowered curtains over the windows. And while\nHanlon was wondering about that, one of them pinned his arms suddenly to\nhis side while another slapped a piece of adhesive across his eyes,\nsmoothing it tightly into place.\n\nHanlon gasped, but did not struggle.\n\n\"That's right, don't fight it,\" the leader's voice was almost kind. \"We\njust don't want you knowing where we are going ... yet.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe car travelled some miles, then stopped and they all got out. The men\nhelped Hanlon down, led him a few dozen steps, then helped him climb\ninto another machine. In a moment he realized they were now in an aircar\nthat had taken off, and he frowned. Assuming that Hooper had followed,\nhe'd be out of it now. He was on his own.\n\nFor several moments Hanlon tried in vain to read from the others' minds\nwhere they were going. He had almost given up hope when he heard the\nunmistakable panting of a small dog, and realized that one of the air\ncrew must have brought a pet.\n\nQuickly his mind contacted that of the dog, and instantly was inside it,\nlooking out through the dog's eyes. He controlled its mind so that it\nclimbed up in the man's lap and, with its forepaws on the fellow's\nshoulder, looked out of the aircar's window. No one seemed to find\nanything peculiar in the dog's actions, its owner merely patting it as\nit stood there, as Hanlon could feel through the dog's senses.\n\nNow Hanlon could see they were nearing some mountains, and took\nparticular notice of everything that might be remembered as a landmark.\nSoon they were settling down into a little hidden valley, where there\nwas a fairly large space-freighter.\n\nThey led him into this ship, and he lost the dog, so could not see just\nwhere they were taking him. Finally he sensed they were in a small room,\nand the adhesive was ripped from his face.\n\nThe leader and Panek stood in the small cabin with Hanlon.\n\n\"This is to be your cabin. Sorry for the precautions, but you can see\nwhy, I am sure. But if you behave, and make a good record, you won't\nhave to ... uh ... worry about them any more. Take-off almost\nimmediately, so we have to leave. Safe flights, and I hope you make out\nall right.\"\n\nHe looked fixedly at Hanlon for a long, long minute, and the young man,\nreturned his gaze as steadily.\n\n\"I'll do my job,\" Hanlon said honestly after that moment--but it was his\njob for the Secret Service he meant. \"Good-bye, and thanks. Thank you,\ntoo, Panek, for your help.\"\n\n\"Glad to've done it, Pal, glad to.\"\n\n\"See you in four months, then,\" and the two left.\n\nHanlon stored his luggage in the racks made for it, then started to go\noutside and see what was going on. But the door was locked.\n\n\"They sure don't want me to know where we're going,\" he grinned ruefully\nas he sat down on the edge of his bunk. \"That makes me know it's\nimportant, and I'll get it some day--they can't keep it from me\nforever.\"\n\nSirens screamed \"take-off,\" and he strapped himself into his bunk. When\nhe felt the pressure subside and knew they were in space he unstrapped\nand relaxed. But there was nothing he could do.\n\nLater there was the sound of a key in the lock. When the door opened a\nheavy-set man carrying a blaster stepped inside.\n\n\"Stand back, Bud, and keep your hands in sight.\"\n\nHanlon raised his hands while the messcook brought in a tray and set it\non his bunk. As they were going out Hanlon spoke. \"You got any books on\nboard? I don't mind being locked in and won't make any trouble, but\nplease give me something to do.\"\n\nThey made no answer, but when they returned for the empty dishes they\nleft a couple of dog-eared magazines.\n\nLate the following afternoon the siren warned of landing, and Hanlon\nstrapped himself down again. After he had felt the landing, one of the\nship's officers came and unlocked the door.\n\nHe was very apologetic. \"Sorry, sir, about this, but we had our orders.\"\n\n\"It's okay with me,\" Hanlon said cheerfully. \"Don't make a bit of\ndifference with me where I am, long's I get well paid.\"\n\n\"I see you've put on your light clothing. That's good--this is a hot\nplanet. These your bags?\"\n\nHanlon nodded, and each carrying one, the officer led the way to the\nairlock and they climbed down onto this new world.\n\nThe air was thick and muggy--at least 110\u00b0 Fahrenheit, Hanlon guessed.\nThere was a great bustle of activity on the landing field. Automatic\nmachinery was unloading cargo, and loading it into trucks. There were\nseveral men, with their luggage, standing about.\n\nOne was a huge, brutish-looking man, another a slender young chap about\nHanlon's own age, apparently well-educated, from his manner, but with a\ncertain shiftiness in his eyes; the others common-place laborers.\n\n\"Any of you been here before?\" the officer asked.\n\nTwo of the others nodded, and started away from the field. Hanlon saw\nthat just beyond the edge of it there were heavy forests--almost a\njungle, but strange and alien.\n\nAs they drew nearer and finally entered it, the young SS man saw that\nthis was, indeed, unlike any jungle or forest he had ever seen or heard\nabout. Tall trees whose branches writhed as though alive, yet never\nattacked one. Underbrush so thick it seemed impassable, yet which\ntwisted away from their approach as though afraid of a contaminating\ntouch, only to swish back into place as soon as the men passed.\n\nHanlon, walking along and taking it all in, seemed to catch faint\nwhispers of thought, but could make nothing of it. He wondered what it\nwas--perhaps some alien animal-life very low in the scale?\n\nThe ground was soft and mucky. The young checker cautioned the others,\n\"Don't step off the path; some of this stuff's almost like quicksand.\"\n\n\"There's a road to the mine,\" he answered Hanlon's further question,\n\"but it's winding and about five miles, where this path's only a half\nmile. Ground here won't stand heavy loads.\"\n\n\"How big is this planet, anyway? Gravity seems about like Simonides and\nTerra.\"\n\n\"It's not quite as large, but seems composed mainly of heavier metals or\nsomething. Gravity about .93. The weather stays about the same all year\n'round; very few storms of any kind, although there's a hot rain almost\nevery night for about half an hour. The temperature goes down to about\n90 at night; up to 110-115 days.\"\n\n\"No wonder they told me to buy light clothing.\"\n\n\"Yeah, it's sure hot. We'd go mostly naked, except the actinic's really\nfierce. Be sure to wear a hat all the time outdoors, and light gloves.\nIf your eyes start to smart, wear dark goggles.\"\n\n\"Thanks for the tips, Chum, I appreciate 'em. I'd begun to notice skin\nitching, but thought it might be this jungle.\"\n\nThey broke through the final wall of foliage and Hanlon saw a large\ncleared space ahead that must have been roughly a half-mile across.\nThere were quite a number of buildings, mostly windowless, and he\ndecided they were storehouses.\n\n\"There's the messhall,\" his new-found friend pointed.\n\nThey went on to another long, low, bungalow-type building, inside which\nHanlon saw a long hall from which opened dozens of doors on either side.\nThe other men disappeared into one or another of the rooms, and the\nyoung fellow stopped at another door. \"Grab the first room that has a\nkey in the lock outside,\" he said. \"They're all alike.\"\n\nThe SS man found one, with the number \"17\" on the door, and went in. The\nroom was small but comfortably furnished. The bed had a good mattress,\nhe found, and white linen sheets and a thin, fleecy blanket folded on\nthe foot. There was a big easy chair, a closet for his clothes and a\ndresser with four drawers. Glo-lights were set in the ceiling, and there\nwas another on a standard by the big chair for easy reading. A door\nopened into another room which proved to be a compact toilet and shower.\nEverything was immaculately clean, and the air was cooled and sweet from\nair-conditioning.\n\n\"Not bad, not bad at all,\" Hanlon said half-aloud as he unpacked and\nstored his things. Then he took a shower. \"Man, are you going to get\nplenty of work-outs, in this heat,\" he apostrophised the shower,\nthankfully. Dressing again, he went out to locate Peter Philander, his\nnew boss.\n\nHe stopped at the messhall, and there he found the cook, a jolly,\nroly-poly sort of man. He introduced himself and they chatted for a few\nminutes.\n\n\"I'm going to like this guy--hope they're all as nice and friendly,\"\nHanlon thought. \"Where's the super's office?\" he asked, and the cook\npointed it out.\n\nEntering the office-shack, Hanlon found himself in a fairly large room\nwith a number of desks and several drafting boards with blue-prints and\ndrawings pinned on them. Behind one of the larger desks was a heavy-set\nman with a great, angry scar across his left cheek and neck, running\nfrom the bridge of the nose to below the ear.\n\nSomething about the man brought a sense of distrust to Hanlon--perhaps\nhis looks, for that terrible scar made him look like a blood-thirsty\npirate.\n\nHanlon discreetly let none of these things show in his voice or demeanor\nas he stepped forward, a smile on his face and his credentials in his\nhand. \"Mr. Philander, sir? I'm George Hanlon, a new guard.\"\n\nThe other nodded without a word, and snatched at the papers, glaring at\nHanlon in a squinting, suspicious manner.\n\nHanlon probed toward the mind behind that frown, and could sense a\nfeeling of fear, suspicion and unrest. He caught a fragment of\nthought--\"another one after my job?\"--and in a flash of inspiration\nguessed what was wrong. This superintendent must have a terrible\ninferiority complex, which that disfiguring scar certainly didn't help.\nHe was undoubtedly competent, or he would not be here, but felt every\nnew man was a possible challenge or replacement.\n\nKnowing that his papers made no mention of his having been a cadet,\nHanlon took a chance on a course of action. \"Gee, Mr. Philander, sir, I\nenvy you,\" he said the moment the man looked up. \"Knowing all about\nmetals and ores and mining and stuff like that. I sure wish I'd had the\nchance to learn something valuable like that. But me, I guess I'm just a\n'strong back; weak mind' sort of guy.\"\n\nThe superintendent looked at him piercingly for a long moment, as though\ntrying to decide whether this was genuine or subtle sarcasm. He must\nhave decided it was the former, for he relaxed a bit. \"Yeah,\" he growled\nin a deep bass that seemed meant to be pleasant now. \"It takes a lot of\nstudy and a good mind to learn what I know. Very few men can make the\ngrade.\"\n\nAnd Hanlon, who was by necessity swiftly becoming a good judge of\ncharacter, knew he had this man pegged, and that while he would be\ndangerous if crossed, could be handled adroitly.\n\n\"Just what will my duties be, sir? Or have you delegated the handling of\nus guards to some lesser man?\"\n\n\"No, I handle 'em myself. 'If you want a job well done, do it yourself',\nyou know. I'll take you out and show you around. Are you all settled and\ncomfortable?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, sir. I have a very nice room, number 17, and am all unpacked.\nHunting your office I ran into the messhall, and Cookie told me about\nmeal hours. I'm sure I'll get along fine here--as much as this awful\nheat'll let me. They sure weren't kidding when they said it was hot\nhere. And I want to assure you, sir, that I'll work hard and tend\nstrictly to business--nothing else.\"\n\nThe superintendent was becoming more mollified and less fearful by the\nsecond. Now he actually smiled, a rather pitiful travesty of a smile,\nand Hanlon's sympathy went out to him.\n\n\"Then we'll get along fine,\" Philander said. \"Just remember that your\njob is only to keep the natives at work during your shift, and that in\nyour off hours you do not go hunting 'round into things that're none of\nyour business.\"\n\n\"Oh, naturally, sir. You just list what limits I'm to keep in, and I'll\nstay there. All I'm after here is that thousand credits a month, and as\nbig a bonus as I can earn. You see,\" with engaging frankness, \"I'm a guy\nthat wants to make his pile as quick as possible, so I won't have to\nwork all my life. I've got to work to get 'em, sure, but I don't aim to\nwork forever.\"\n\n\"Hmmpfff\" Philander rose from behind the desk. \"Come on, I'll show you\naround.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter 13\n\n\nFor an hour Superintendent Philander escorted George Hanlon about the\ndiggings, showing him the various buildings and the workers' stockade.\n(\"Prison\" would be a better word, Hanlon thought, enraged that there\nwere still men who would enslave others for their own personal gain.)\n\nThe young Earthman got a real shock of surprise at his first sight of\nthe native. They were so entirely different from anything he had ever\nsuspected might exist. They were tall and slender, and their\ngreenish-brown skin was rough and irregular. They seemed possessed of\nconsiderable wiry strength, however.\n\nHanlon had the peculiar feeling that they were somehow familiar, as\nthough related to something he already knew, even though they were so\nalien. But, strain as he might, he could not at first bring that elusive\nthought into recognition.\n\nHe examined more particularly each item of the natives' appearance. They\nhad small triangular eyes, wide-spaced on their narrow faces, almost\nlike a bird's yet not set quite as far back. They could see forward and\nsomewhat to either side, he guessed, with a much wider range of vision\nthan humans have. They also had triangular-shaped mouths which worked\nsomewhat on the sphincter method. Even though their faces were sort of\nsilly-looking, there was somehow a strange beauty to them.\n\nHe noticed that when two or more faced each other they often worked\ntheir mouths, and guessed they were conversing, although not a sound\ncould be heard coming from them, other than a peculiar, faint rustling\nas they moved.\n\nIt was the latter that gave him the clue. _Animated trees!_ That's\nwhat they reminded him of. That skin of theirs was like new bark; their\nlimbs were irregular, suggesting the branches of a tree, rather than the\ngraceful roundness of human and Terran animal's limbs.\n\nHe turned excitedly to Philander. \"Hey, those natives are partly\nvegetable, aren't they? Like trees that can move and think?\"\n\n\"That's what they say,\" Philander said shortly, \"though I don't know\nabout the 'think' part. No one's ever been able to figure 'em out. They\ndon't talk, and can't seem to hear us, no matter how loud we yell. We\nhave to show 'em everything we want 'em to do, and give 'em orders by\nsigns. Whips don't do any good when they loaf--they don't seem to feel\n'em. So we use electric shock-rods, like you see that guard there\ncarrying.\"\n\nHanlon was silent for several moments, but his mind was attempting to\nprobe into that of the native nearest him. Nor was he surprised to\ndiscover that this native had a really respectable mind--alert and keen.\n\nHanlon could read quite easily pictures of various things--but he could\nnot interpret them. Yet he could feel their sense of shame and\ndegradation at such an enslaved condition, and the dull anger they felt\nfor the humans who had made them so.\n\nThis promised to be a fertile field for study, and the young SS man felt\na thrill that he could do a lot of prowling and studying without seeming\nto break the rules Philander had laid down for his conduct. \"This\ncertainly is my field,\" he thought. \"I'm sure glad I decided to take the\nchance of coming here--the Corps must learn of this situation.\"\n\nThe superintendent broke in on his thoughts. \"I've got to go back to the\noffice before dinner. Go to the commissary store, there, and get your\nchronom exchanged for one that runs on Algonian time. Yours will be\nstored for safekeeping and changed back if or when you leave here.\"\n\nAs he walked away Hanlon thrilled to the knowledge that he had gained\ntwo valuable pieces of information.\n\nFirst, and most important, the name of this planet--Algon. Second, but\nthis one a bit dismaying, that there might be some doubt as to whether\nor not he would ever leave here. Was there some danger here of which he\nhad not been told ... or was it that the leader's promise of four\nmonths' work and then a vacation back to Simonides perhaps meant nothing\nat all--was merely a \"come on\"?\n\nIt was more than the perspiration from the terrible heat that dampened\nHanlon's skin as he walked thoughtfully over to the store. Yet he\ntingled with the knowledge that at least he knew where he was. Now, his\nonly worry was getting that knowledge to the Corps.\n\nAt dinner a little later he had his first chance to meet all the men\nwith whom he would be working. The superintendent introduced them, all\naround when they sat down at the long table.\n\nThere were eleven other guards, all older, all bigger men than he. They\nwere alike in that all appeared to be swaggering bullies, and he could\nwell imagine how ready they were with the use of those shock-rods, or\nother forms of brutality, to torture the Algonians at the least\nprovocation or no provocation whatever. Without exception these guards\nhad heavy faces, most of them unshaven, and most with thick, shaggy\neyebrows. Even in that air-cooled room their generally unwashed\ncondition was noticeable.\n\nHanlon knew instinctively he would make no friends among them. \"I only\nhope I make no enemies. Why was I, so drastically different from them,\nchosen as a guard? What's that leader got in his devious mind, anyway?\"\n\nThere were four mining engineers, and these men were keen, alert\nfellows. One seemed about forty-five, another in his late thirties, and\nthe two others young men evidently not long out of school. They were\nclean-shaven, and friendly where the guards were surly and sneering at\nHanlon's youth and slimness.\n\nThere was an accountant, the store clerk, two checkers who tallied ore\nbrought up each shift. A half dozen others, who apparently were truckmen\nand hoistmen, completed, with Philander, the cook and the bunkhouse\ncleaner, the human crew at this mine.\n\nHanlon had been seated between one of the guards, a huge man by the name\nof Groton, and one of the young engineers. The latter made him welcome,\nand asked where he came from.\n\n\"I'd just moved to Simonides when I got the chance to come here,\" Hanlon\nexplained. \"I was born and raised on Terra.\"\n\n\"Terra!\" the young man's voice was interested, and several others about\nthe table raised their heads at that name. \"I've always wanted to see\nthe Mother World.\"\n\nWhen all had finished eating, several of the other men who had never\nseen Terra moved closer to Hanlon, asking many questions.\n\n\"I understand Terra has the best technicians in the universe,\" one of\nthe hoistmen said.\n\n\"That used to be the case,\" Hanlon answered honestly, \"but now I\nunderstand Simonides has, just as she is the wealthiest planet. Of\ncourse, Terra being the original world, was bound to have the best the\nrace could breed in all lines of endeavor. But when so many people\nmigrated to other planets, she gradually lost many of her finest brains.\nLater, those other planets offered such fabulous wages to men and women\nwith skills and trainings her first inhabitants lacked, that Terra was\nfurther drained.\"\n\n\"That's the pity of colonization,\" the elder engineer sighed. \"It builds\nnew lands at the expense of the old, taking all their strongest, most\nadventurous and most imaginative. Soon the original country or continent\nor planet is peopled only by the dregs.\"\n\n\"I don't like to think Terra has only dregs left. After all, I came from\nthere, you know,\" Hanlon grinned and they smiled back companionably.\n\"But I know you're right in part--at least, that will probably be the\ncase in time. Just as it will with the other planets as their best and\nyounger top-notchers go out to open up still more worlds.\"\n\nIn the middle of that first night on Algon something, perhaps his\nsub-conscious, brought George Hanlon wide awake, his every mental\nfaculty clear and alert.\n\nClick! Click! Click! ... like pieces of a jig-saw puzzle falling into\nplace, many of the odds and ends of apparently unrelated information and\nexperience fell into place in this enigma.\n\nHe remembered clearly now, an incident that had merely brought a\nmomentary wonder at the time. Those last minutes before the ship took\noff. The leader had stared long and piercingly into his eyes and Hanlon,\nwondering and puzzled as to what the man was seeking, merely stared back\ndumbly. Now he remembered the flashing thought--quickly dismissed as\nridiculous--that even if he did find out where he was going, he must\nnever tell anyone; must forget it entirely and instantly on pain of\nsevere torture.\n\nWhy, that leader must have been trying to implant a hypnotic compulsion\nin his mind ... and must have thought he succeeded, else Hanlon would\nnever have reached here alive. That was why he could never read that\nknowledge from the mind of any of the people he had contacted who were\nin on this game--not even that ship's officer, who certainly should have\nknown.\n\nBut wait a minute. What about Philander? He knew. Hadn't the hypnosis\nworked on him? Or was that name \"Algon\" merely one the super used in\nplace of the real one he didn't know he knew? Or, again, could it be\nthat he was so well trusted that the knowledge had not been sealed off\nfrom him?\n\nOf the three, Hanlon argued the latter was probably the truth.\n\nAnother point. That vague reference to \"if or when you leave here\" was\nundoubtedly a slip of the tongue. Philander had probably guessed--or\nperhaps it was so with all first-time men--that Hanlon was here on\nprobation. \"If so,\" the thought was insistent, \"I sure will have to\nwatch my step every minute, and not let slip what I'm trying to do\nhere.\" But further moments of thought brought the reasonable conclusion\nthat he could lull their suspicion by buckling down and making a real\nrecord for efficiency.\n\nOr ... and this gave him the cold shivers for a moment, so that he\ninstinctively burrowed a bit further down beneath the sheet, as though\nit could protect and warm him ... did they know all about him already,\nand had sent him here to get rid of him? Was he to become another victim\nof one of the leader's \"little accidents\"?\n\nYes, if they still disbelieved his story about his dismissal, they might\nwell be determined to get rid of him in a way that would not incriminate\nthem. They would know that if Hanlon was still a Corpsman his death\nwould be most thoroughly investigated.\n\nPerhaps ... but if that was the case, why let him get here at all? His\n\"accident\"--fatal, of course (so sorry!)--could just as well have\noccurred on the way. No, more likely he was still on probation. They\nwere not quite sure of him, but were giving him the benefit of the\ndoubt. The leader seemed to like him, in a curious way.\n\nWell, he was now warned, and would watch himself more carefully than\never ... and he had learned a lot, and would learn more. He smiled\ncontentedly and went back to sleep.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe next day he had his first taste of guarding the natives as they\nworked. The superintendent himself inducted him into the task.\n\nShortly before shift time, Philander appeared at Hanlon's room just as\nthe young man was putting on the special clothing he had been told to\nwear on duty in the mine.\n\n\"Ready?\" Philander was strangely courteous and co-operative. \"Let's go\ncollect your crew.\"\n\nThey went over to the stockade, the superintendent giving Hanlon a key\nas they unlocked the gates. Hanlon saw that the corral was divided into\ntwelve sections.\n\n\"One guard has charge of all the natives in one section, and they all\nwork each shift,\" Philander explained.\n\n\"What if one of them is sick?\"\n\n\"They don't get sick,\" the man's voice was gruff, and Hanlon's first\nthought was that what he really meant was that the natives were worked\nno matter how they felt. But he quickly became ashamed of the\nthought--he didn't know anything about them yet, and perhaps they\nactually never did get sick. He would have to quit jumping to\nconclusions that way--it would seriously retard his ability to make\ncorrect deductions.\n\nAt the rearmost section, Philander opened another gate with the same\nkey, and flashed his portable glo-light inside the large hut that\ncovered most of the space of the section. Hanlon, close behind, could\nsee about twenty of the \"Greenies,\" as he had learned they were usually\ncalled, standing or lying about. There was no furniture inside, no\nchairs nor stools, tables or beds.\n\n\"They eat and sleep standing up--that's why the huts don't need any\nfurnishings,\" Philander explained.\n\nAt sight of the men and the light, most of the natives began moving\ntoward the door. A few at the back didn't move fast enough to satisfy\nPhilander, and with a curse he ran back and touched them with that\nshock-rod he carried.\n\nHanlon could see an expression of agony on the faces of those touched,\nand as they writhed away from the rod he realized it must be very\npainful, indeed, if not exquisite torture to them. They now jumped\nforward, and huddled pathetically near the door.\n\nPhilander took a long, light but very tough line from his pocket. It had\na series of running nooses in it, and he slipped one of these about the\nwrist of each native, drawing it tight. Then he half-led, half-dragged\nthem out of the stockade, to the mine entrance, and down the drift to\nthe rise they had to climb to get to the stope Hanlon's crew was to\nwork.\n\nOnce there, and released from the rope, the natives seemed to know what\nthey were supposed to do, and sullenly started doing it.\n\n\"You usually use three pickmen, four shovellers, four for your timbering\ncrew, three sorters, and six on the wheel-barrows,\" Philander explained.\n\"Sometimes, if the vein widens out enough, you get extra hands to work\nthe wider face, but this size crew generally works out best. You'll soon\nget used to it so you'll know how many you need. If more, just yell and\nyou'll get 'em. If it happens the vein narrows so you can't use all\nthese to best advantage, someone working a wider vein can use your\nextras temporarily.\"\n\n\"I get it,\" Hanlon was very attentive. He was determined to learn this\nwork quickly and thoroughly, and to make a good record.\n\nPhilander showed Hanlon the difference between the ore and the\nsurrounding rock, and explained very carefully how he was to watch\nespecially for any side veins branching off from the main one. \"Make\nsure the Greenies clean out all the ore as they go along, before it's\ntimbered up.\"\n\n\"I understand everything so far.\"\n\n\"Keep the lazy beggars going full speed,\" Philander was very emphatic.\n\"Don't let 'em lag, or they'll wear you down. Don't ever let 'em get out\nof control, or put anything over on you, especially in sorting ore from\nrock. They're tricky. Use your shock-rod at every least sign of mutiny\nor loafing. Make 'em respect you. They know better'n to try to get away,\n'cause they hate the rod.\"\n\n\"What does it do to them?\"\n\n\"We don't know exactly, except they can feel it, and will do anything to\nget away from it.\"\n\n\"Maybe it hurts them terribly.\"\n\n\"Look, punk!\" Philander lost his friendliness, and snarled at Hanlon\nwith twisted face. \"We don't care whether they like it or not. They know\ntheir jobs and they don't have to get shocked if they keep working. So\nit's strictly up to them. Don't go getting any soft notions about these\nlousy Greenies. They're only dumb brutes fit for working--so work 'em!\"\n\n\"I'll work 'em,\" Hanlon said.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 14\n\n\nYes, Hanlon would work the natives, but without cruelty. His thoughts\nwere a seething of contempt for these brutal thugs. He was willing to\nbet, right there and then, without knowing anything about this\nsituation, that these natives could be controlled without bullying or\nhurting them--and better.\n\nHaving had military training, Hanlon knew it was possible to enforce the\nmost strict discipline without such means, and that any man ... or\nentity, probably ... could and would submit to discipline fairly and\ndecently enforced, with far less trouble and animosity, and with far\ngreater productivity than if he were driven to it.\n\n\"Anybody works better for a pat on the back than for a kick in the\npants!\" he thought indignantly.\n\nPhilander stood about for an hour, and when he saw that Hanlon\nunderstood exactly what was expected of him and his crew--when he saw\nHanlon several times correct the sorters who had left too much rock in\nwith the ores--he turned to leave.\n\n\"You'll hear the siren when the shift's over,\" he said. \"Bring your gang\nback and lock 'em in the stockade then. Be sure you lock both gates\ncarefully.\"\n\n\"Cookie gave me a lunch for half-time,\" Hanlon said. \"What about the\nnatives? Do they eat then, too?\"\n\n\"Naw, they don't eat,\" was the surprising answer. \"Once a day they stick\ntheir hands into the dirt for nearly an hour. Must get nourishment that\nway.\"\n\n\"That seems to prove they're vegetable matter. Their fingers must be\nsome sort of feeding roots,\" Hanlon observed sagely. \"They sure are the\nstrangest beings I've ever heard of.\"\n\nThe superintendent shrugged and left without further words.\n\nHanlon looked about and found a rock near the sorters, and used this for\na seat. He sat watching the natives work, and speculating about them,\nand also about what this was all about. The mine seemed to him a very\nrich one, and by using slave labor those men could well be reaping a\nhuge fortune from it. No wonder they could afford to pay guards a\nthousand a month.\n\nAfter a bit one of the natives, seeing Hanlon merely sitting there\ninstead of being alertly on guard close to them, dropped its shovel and\nturned away from its work. Hanlon got up leisurely, but walked\npurposefully over to confront the Greenie. He smiled and motioned the\nnative back to work.\n\nThe Greenie's face showed surprise at Hanlon's action, but it made no\nmove to go. It did, however, appear to be keeping its eyes alertly on\nthat dread shock-rod hanging loosely in Hanlon's hand. The guard could\nsee that the others had also stopped work, and were carefully watching\nthe little drama.\n\nHanlon smiled and again motioned the native back to work, and when it\ndid not move, he reached out, grasped it gently by the shoulder and,\nstill gently, pushed it in the direction of its shovel, with what was\nreally a pat on the back.\n\nThere were looks of surprise that amounted almost to stupefaction on the\nfaces of all the natives. The one who had first stopped now picked up\nits shovel and resumed work, and the rest followed its example. Hanlon\nresumed his seat, still with that friendly smile on his face. He noticed\nwith satisfaction that they were soon working harder and faster than\nbefore the incident.\n\n\"I was right,\" he told himself almost smugly.\n\nThe six hour shift was finally ended without any further show of\nresistance. That is, it was six hours by Algonian time, but about eight\nby Terra standards. For on Algon, while the day had been divided by the\nhumans into twenty-four hours, the same as on Earth, each hour was\nalmost seventy-eight minutes long. They divided the year into five day\nweeks, though, so it averaged out about the same.\n\nWhen the siren blew Hanlon smiled happily at his crew as he herded them\ntogether, and made applauding motions with his hands, wondering if they\nunderstood what he meant.\n\nWhen he had locked the natives in their stockade, he hunted up the\ncheckers. \"How'd I do?\" he asked. \"Come anywhere near what I was\nsupposed to get out?\"\n\nOne of the checkers totalled up his figures, then looked up in surprise.\n\"Hey, kid, you did all right. Nearly a hundred pounds over the usual\noutput, and clean, too. That's really okay for a new guard, and then\nsome. Didn't have any trouble, eh?\"\n\n\"Trouble?\" Hanlon asked naively. \"Was I supposed to have some?\" Then he\ncouldn't help grinning. \"Thanks for the info,\" and went to his room,\ntook a shower to cool off after that muggy heat in the mine, then\ntumbled onto his bunk for a nap until dinner-time.\n\nThose first days so thoroughly disgusted George Hanlon as he saw the\ncontinued and senseless brutality the guards used toward their native\n\"slaves,\" that he had trouble concealing his feelings. He continued to\ntreat his Greenies with the respect he felt was due them, and he could\nnot help but notice they seemed to look on him more and more as their\nfriend. They always smiled when he looked at them, and before many days\nhe discovered that his crew was doing more work than any of the others.\nHis mind-probing had convinced him they were high enough in the scale of\nevolution to know the meaning of gratitude, and he could tell they were\nrepaying his kindness with co-operation.\n\nHe had begun to make much more sense out of the pictures he saw in\ntheir minds, and to get some glimmerings of understanding about their\nalien concepts. Also, it was increasingly borne in upon him that they\ndid \"talk\" to each other, and he guessed shrewdly that the reason\nno one could hear them was because their voices were above ... or\nbelow? ... the range of human hearing. \"Above,\" he finally deduced.\n\nThat gave him the idea for an experiment, and he started whistling as\nloud as he could, gradually raising his tones until he was at the top of\nhis range. He saw with interest and excitement that the last one or two\nshrillest notes seemed to attract their attention. Their silly-looking\nlittle triangular ears perked up and began twitching. They turned about,\nas though seeking the source of that sound, while every mouth began\nworking with signs of utmost excitement, and his mind caught concepts of\nsurprise and wonder.\n\nThat convinced him and so, in his next several off-hours, he\nsurreptitiously collected various articles and pieces of material, and\nin his room started the construction of a little machine. His course in\nthe Corps school had included considerable mechanics and electronics,\nand the tearing down and rebuilding of many of the machines and\ninstruments the Corps used.\n\nWhat he was trying to make now was a \"frequency-transformer.\" If it\nwould do what he was sure it would, and if he was right about the\nAlgonians having vocal ability, they should be able to hear each other,\nand some day he might learn their language well enough to converse with\nthem.\n\nHe finished it and smuggled the little box-like machine into his place\nin the mine. When he had his crew down there and working at their tasks,\nhe got out the little box. He turned on the current from the small\nbattery installed in it, then began talking at the same time he was\nturning a rheostat higher and higher. Finally he noticed those mobile\nears began to twitch, and as he turned the tones higher and still\nhigher, more and more of the natives stopped work and turned toward him.\nFinally he noticed an intenser excitement among them, and they dropped\ntheir tools and came crowding closer to him and his machine, their\nlittle eyes almost emitting sparks of excitement.\n\nHe thrilled with the realization that it worked. Now he turned another\nknob more and more, and gradually from the speaker came a jumble of\nsounds much like \"mob-mutter,\" but very low. He kept on turning the\nrheostat until the incoming voices seemed about the same pitch as his\nown voice.\n\nThe excitement of the natives had grown to tremendous proportions, and\nhis own equalled theirs. Their little mouths were working faster, and an\nexpression almost like laughter came onto their peculiar little faces,\nas they heard his voice and knew he could now hear theirs.\n\nHanlon's own smile almost cracked his face. He realized he had learned\nsomething none of the greedy, power-mad Simonideans knew, and felt that\nhere was the possible beginning for his campaign to free these poor\nnative slaves.\n\nHe beckoned to one of the nearer natives to come to his side, then waved\nthe rest back to their work. They looked at him questioningly for a\nmoment, but he smiled reassuringly at them and they, having learned that\nhe never used that dread shock-rod on them, all went back to their\nlabors, leaving the one native standing there.\n\nHanlon looked earnestly at the Greenie, pointed a finger directly at\nhimself and spoke into the microphone of his transformer. \"Hanlon,\" he\nsaid slowly and distinctly, and repeated it a number of times, tapping\nhimself on the chest each time he said it.\n\nA smile of comprehension broke over the native's little face and he\ntapped himself the same way and said a word that came out of the speaker\nsounding like \"Geck.\"\n\nHanlon reached out and touched the native and said \"Geck.\" The Greenie\nin turn tapped Hanlon and said \"An-yon,\" and they had made the first\nbeginnings of understanding each other.\n\nFrom then on this one native was released from all other work while\nHanlon's crew was on duty, and the two devoted all their efforts to\nlearning how to talk to each other.\n\nHanlon was pleased, but not especially surprised, to note that the rest\nof the crew--now almost entirely without his supervision--worked harder\nthan ever, and that their daily output of ore grew progressively greater\neach shift, and all clean ore.\n\nHanlon's first exultant thought had been to run to Philander and tell\nhim of what he had learned concerning the native's speech ability, and\nhow he had made it possible for humans to talk to them.\n\nBut more sober reflections during that long work-shift brought caution.\nHe decided this was a bit of knowledge he had better keep to himself as\nlong as possible. He hoped he could keep it until he had learned how to\ntalk with these people and learned much about them, their situation, and\nhow it could best be ameliorated.\n\nThe other men, he knew, considered the natives simply beasts, and would\nprobably take away his transformer, instead of using it to learn about\nthe Greenies as he planned to do.\n\nBy the end of a month he and Geck were chatting away like brothers. Each\nhad learned enough of the other's language so that by using a mixture of\nthe two they could exchange almost any thought concept desired. Hanlon's\nability to read the native's surface thoughts helped a lot, especially\nas he began to understand their alien ways of thinking. Even so, he was\nsurprised at how quickly Geck was picking up his own language.\n\nHanlon found that these people, while they had no scientific or\nmechanical knowledge or training of their own, did have highly developed\nethical principles which governed all their individual and collective\nactions. They were a simple, natural people, with a native dignity\nHanlon almost envied.\n\nHe found, too, that his first shrewd guess was correct--their bodies\nwere of vegetable matter, rather than proto-plasmic. They reproduced by\nbudding, and he saw a number of the \"females\" to whom were attached buds\nof varying sizes. One day he watched interestedly while one of the\nripened buds, a fully-developed individual but only about ten inches\nhigh, detached itself from its parent and dropped to the ground. It lay\nthere for some minutes while the \"mother\" watched it carefully. Then it\nrose by itself and trotted away with her as she resumed her work--a\nminiature but fully alive native \"child.\" It would take about two years\nfor it to attain its maturity, Geck informed him. Hanlon asked, and Geck\nsaid it could take care of itself alone in the forest, so Hanlon managed\nto sneak it out into the woods, where it would be free.\n\nGeck told him that about four years previous a great \"egg\" had landed\nhere on Guddu, which was their name for the planet. Men had come from\ninside it, and scattered all about, seeking the metal ores they were now\nmining.\n\nThe natives, friendly and childishly curious, had gathered in force to\nwatch these strange new creatures, and because of their trusting natures\nhad been easily trapped, imprisoned and forced to work long, hard hours\nin the rapidly-deepening holes.\n\n\"Us die swiftly away from sunlight,\" Geck said sadly. \"Us have very long\nlife-span, but underground work make us wither-die fast. Idea often\ndiscussed among we to discontinue race, because soon all we be gone\nanyway.\"\n\nThat quiet, hopeless statement made Hanlon madder than a wet cat.\n\n\"What do the shock-rods do to you?\" he asked after a while.\n\n\"Affect we's nervous system some way. Us get most terrible cramps. Is\nhorrible agony. Us so thankful you never use.\"\n\n\"I knew you would work without them as long as you were treated fairly.\"\n\nTo himself Hanlon swore a determined oath to finish this business\nentirely, some way or another. He realized his limitations--one young,\ninexperienced man against twenty ruthless, wealth-and-power greedy\nruffians ... and that only here, at this one mine. No telling how many\nothers there were on Algon, besides all those back on Simonides, and who\nknew what other planets, who were in on this plot.\n\nHis heart clamored for swift action--his brain counselled caution and\ncareful planning.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 15\n\n\nHanlon was sitting at his usual place in the mine one day when one of\nthe barrow-men ran up and spoke swiftly to Geck, who turned to Hanlon,\nalarm on his face. \"Big boss man come.\"\n\nHanlon jumped to his feet. \"Get everyone to work; tell them to act real\nbusy!\" he snapped. \"You, too!\"\n\nHe thrust the frequency-transformer into a hole prepared for just such\nan emergency, grabbed up his shock-rod and stepped closer to the\nnatives. He was standing there, to all appearances strictly on the job\nof making his charges work, when Philander came crawling up the rise\ninto the pocket where this crew was mining the glossy, lustrous\npitch-blank uraninite ore.\n\n\"How're things going?\" the superintendent greeted Hanlon with at least\nthe appearance of friendliness.\n\n\"Just fine,\" the young man responded. \"Everything's under control.\"\n\n\"Been looking over the reports, and see your crew is getting out more\nore'n any of the others,\" the super's voice held just a tinge of\nanxiety, and Hanlon began probing that mind to see if he could discover\njust what all this portended.\n\n\"I just keep 'em at it,\" he shrugged.\n\n\"No trouble?\"\n\n\"Nope, no trouble. Look at 'em,\" he waved his hand at the busy crew.\n\nThe big man regarded them closely, and could see that every single one\nof the natives was working at what he knew was their top speed, and\nwithout a single slacker. Even the barrow-men were moving almost at a\njog-trot rather than the lazy saunter most natives used in an effort to\ndo no more than they were forced to do.\n\nPhilander shook his head wonderingly. \"How d'you do it?\" he asked. \"The\nother guards have to keep shocking one after another of the lazy dogs,\nyet you've made no move at a single one--and they keep right on\nhustling. I've never seen a crew work so hard.\"\n\nHanlon wanted desperately to tell him, but he decided the time was not\nyet. So he merely shrugged the question away as of little consequence.\n\"I dunno, sir. I just stand around watching 'em, and they work.\" He\ngrinned into the super's face. \"Must be my manly charms--er sumpin',\" he\nchuckled. Then sobered. \"Maybe one reason is that I rotate 'em. Any job\ngets monotonous, so every hour or so I let 'em change around, from pick\nto barrow to sorting, and so on.\"\n\nA frown of annoyance came onto Philander's face, but he quickly erased\nit. After all, this man was getting out more ore than the others, and\nthat was what he was here for. How he did it didn't matter so much,\nafter all, as long as he kept up his record.\n\nBut Hanlon, reading those surface thoughts, knew that the official was\nstill very suspicious--and vastly worried. Hanlon knew he had to disarm\nthe super some way, to get him out of that mood. He decided his air of\nnaivete could still do the trick.\n\n\"Mr. Philander, sir,\" his voice was very ingenuous, \"I don't want to pry\ninto anything that's none of my business, but would you mind telling me\nwhat this stuff is we're getting here? It isn't anything dangerous, is\nit? I mean, it isn't one of those ... those radium ores that make a\nfellow sterile, is it? I may want to get married some day, so I don't\nwant to take any chances.\"\n\nThe mining engineer looked at him blankly for a moment, then threw back\nhis head and laughter rolled out until it seemed to fill the stope.\nHanlon watched the other's mind clear itself of all suspicion ... at\nleast for the time being.\n\nPhilander rested his hand companionably on the younger man's shoulder.\n\"No, it's nothing like that, so you can quit worrying. And the bonus\nyou'll get, if you can keep up this output, will fix you so you can\nafford a wife when your time's up and you go back to Sime.\"\n\n\"Gee, that's good,\" Hanlon made his voice and face show how relieved he\nfelt. \"It had me worried, even though I haven't got a girl yet.\"\n\nThe superintendent seemed in good humor now. Hanlon caught the thought\nthat this punk was a good guard, and bright, and he did get the stuff\nout. The plan of rotating the workers was good--he'd order the other\nguards to use it. This Hanlon probably was no menace to their plans\nhere, after all. In fact, maybe later they could use him on the bigger\njob. He (Philander) would so recommend to His Highness when he made his\nnext report.\n\nAfter a few more casual words the super left, and Hanlon sank back onto\nhis favorite lounging place, thinking very seriously and contemplatively\nabout this whole matter.\n\nAgain he had run into that thought about someone called \"His Highness,\"\nbut never any indication as to who the man was, or what position he\noccupied. It was now apparent that this individual was the man he would\nhave to ferret out, whose plans he would have to learn before the Corps\ncould take any really effective action.\n\nHe certainly hoped that one was the top man. It was going to be hard\nenough to get a line on him--to say nothing of anyone even higher.\n\nOne evening at dinner, some time later, Hanlon became aware that the\nguard, Gorton, was growling at him. He looked up in surprise, and forced\nhimself to pay attention to the big man's words.\n\n\"I ask ya, whatcha tryin' t' do, punk?\" the small pig-eyes glared redly\nat him, and the voice was harsh and bitter. \"Try'n'a show up us other\nguards? What'sa big idea, gettin' out more ore'n we do?\"\n\nHanlon stared back in amazement, and his voice when he answered\nwas a stammer of surprise. \"Why ... why ... I'm not trying to do\nanything ... except my job,\" he added more forcefully.\n\n\"We been gettin' out a reg'lar three tons a shift,\" the ugly face was\nshoved closer to his, and Hanlon shrank back from the stench of raw\nspirits breathed on him. \"What'sa idea drivin' yer crew up t' three an'\na half er four?\"\n\n\"I was told to keep my crew working, and I've been doing that ... and\nonly that!\" Hanlon snapped. \"And take your ugly, stinking face away from\nmine!\"\n\nThe disgust he felt at the brutality of these guards had made him so\nsoul-sick with them he wasn't going to take any guff from one of them.\nEven though Gorton out-weighed him by a good sixty pounds and probably\nhad at least four inches longer reach, Hanlon wasn't afraid of him.\n\nRight now he was as much in the mood for a fight as the guard seemed to\nbe, for at Hanlon's words Gorton's huge, ham-like hand suddenly slapped\nout at the younger man. Hanlon wasn't able entirely to dodge safely,\nsitting as close as they were. His head rang from the terrific blow. He\ngrabbed his cup of steaming coffee, and threw it backhand into Gorton's\nface.\n\nBellowing in pain and anger, the guard jumped up, upsetting the bench,\nand almost Hanlon with it. But the younger man was agile, and kept his\nfeet. As Gorton rushed, his long, heavy arms flailing, Hanlon ducked\naway and jumped back far enough to get a firm footing on a cleared space\nof floor.\n\nAll Corps cadets were well-trained in both Marquis of Queensbury\nboxing, Judo and no-holds-barred barroom brawling. He knew all the\nquestions ... and all the answers.\n\nSo Hanlon stepped back in quickly. While Gorton was out of position from\nthat abortive mighty swing, he drove his fist to the wrist into the big\nman's soft belly. As Gorton doubled up with an explosive grunt, Hanlon\nswung from the heels. His uppercut caught the big fellow flush on the\njaw, and staggered him.\n\nBut Gorton could take it, and charged again, roaring curses. By sheer\nweight he bore Hanlon back across the floor, and got in a couple of\nheavy blows. Hanlon's right cheek was badly bruised, and that eye almost\nclosed. But he was fighting methodically, almost viciously. He was in\nand out, slashing and ripping Gorton's face to shreds.\n\nThe other guards had been yelling their delight at the fight, and their\nhatred of the brash newcomer who was destroying their easy set-up. It\nwas plain they were all on Gorton's side, and hoped to see Hanlon get\nthoroughly whipped.\n\n\"Bat his ears off, Gort!\"\n\n\"Pound some sense inta him!\"\n\n\"Show him who's top man aroun' here!\"\n\nOne of them was not content with yelling. As Hanlon stepped to one side\nto avoid another of Gorton's rushes, this guard stuck out his leg and\ntripped Hanlon, who fell backward. Instantly Gorton was on him, and a\ngreat heavy-shod foot shot out in a kick that would have broken Hanlon's\nevery rib. But the SS man was watching for just such tricks. His feet\nsnaked out and hoisted Gorton so high and so far that when he landed he\ncrashed like a great falling tree. Hanlon jumped to his feet and swung\nto confront his foe. But Gorton's head was bleeding badly, his eyes were\nclosed, his face contorted. He was out like a burnt match.\n\nInstantly Hanlon sank to his knees by the fallen man, gently raising the\nhead and yelling for cold water and a towel. When the cook came running\nwith them, Hanlon worked as swiftly to revive the guard as he would have\ndone for his friend.\n\nThe other guards were so surprised at this act of mercy they sat like\ndull clods. But a couple of the engineers rose and came swiftly to help\nHanlon. One of the checkers ran to Philander's office for the first aid\nkit.\n\nThe men were working desperately to stanch the flow of blood when\nSuperintendent Philander came running in with the clerk and the kit.\nTaking in the situation at a glance, he demanded an explanation.\n\n\"Th' punk jumped Gort an' tried t' kill 'im!\" one of the guards yelled,\nbut was shouted down by the engineers, the checkers and the cook before\nthe other slow-witted guards came to their senses enough to corroborate\ntheir fellow's mendacious claim.\n\nThe senior engineer explained fully and concisely what had actually\nhappened. \"Yet after all that, the kid was the first to help him, even\nthough Gorton started the fight for no reason.\"\n\nJust then the fallen guard groaned and began to regain his senses. The\nmen helped him to his feet. He blinked for some moments, as though\ntrying to figure out what had happened to him, then remembrance came.\n\n\"Why, that little squirt, hittin' me wit' a chair!\" he yelled, and\nstraggled to get at Hanlon again, nor did the men have an easy time\nholding him back.\n\nPhilander planted himself squarely in front of the angry man. \"Shut up!\"\nhe blazed, and the tone of command halted the big fellow; he stared\nstupidly at his boss, as though disbelieving his ears. \"You keep your\nhands off Hanlon!\" the super emphasized his words by tapping Gorton not\ngently on the chest. \"I hear of any more of this, and it's the jug 'til\nthe next ship comes, then back to Sime.\"\n\nHe whirled to face the table. \"That goes for all the rest of you rats,\ntoo! If Hanlon does his job better'n you, it's 'cause he's a better man.\nTry to match him--don't go gunning for him!\"\n\n\"He your pet, Pete?\" one asked mockingly.\n\n\"No, he's not my pet, Pete,\" the super's voice mimicked the tone,\nalthough his face went red at the accusation. \"I just don't want this\ncamp messed up with any feuds. That'd cut down production, and the Big\nBoy wants this ore out fast. If Hanlon can work his crew faster'n\nharder'n the rest of you, you'd a blasted sight better find out how he\ndoes it, not try to cut down his take. How'd you like to go back to Sime\nand try explaining to His Highness why you're not getting out as much\nstuff as's been proved possible?\"\n\nThat stopped them cold. Hanlon, watching their faces and reading their\nminds, saw them shiver at thought of having to face that feared\nindividual--whoever he was. They were more scared of him than of the\nDevil--that was evident.\n\nThe men resumed their eating without another word--that threat had cowed\nthem as no amount of physical chastisement or other punishment could\npossibly have done. Philander set about sewing up and binding Gorton's\nhead-wound and his cut and bleeding face.\n\nHanlon resumed his own seat after washing up and treating his own\nbruises with the cook's help. As he ate he sought mind after mind in the\nvain endeavor to discover any possible scrap of information about this\nenigmatic, unknown Highness.\n\nBut he drew blank after blank, as far as definite data was\nconcerned--just as he had always done. The surface thoughts of each man\nthere showed plainly their fear of that implacably cold and vicious\nbrain, but none of them held a picture of him.\n\nThey knew no excuses for failure were ever accepted. They knew terrible\npunishments were certain to follow when anyone was luckless enough to\nincur that monster's displeasure.\n\nBut Hanlon shivered, himself, as he saw how clearly those hardened\ncriminals feared that mysterious man's displeasure. He quailed\nmomentarily at thought of what would happen to him if he were caught\ntrying to locate that man and his plot.\n\nHanlon knew a long moment of utter discouragement. There was so much he\nhad to know before he could lead the Corps in clearing up this mess.\nThere had been so many mentions of a \"main plot\" that he knew this\nillegal mining and slavery was but a small part of what was ... what\nmust be ... going on.\n\nNo, he would just have to keep on trying, keep on working. On second\nthought, he had done pretty well so far, at that--he felt he had a right\nto feel good about that.\n\nBut he wasn't done yet, by a whole tankful of fuel.\n\nThe problem stayed with him even in sleep, but in the morning he had an\nidea.\n\nAs soon as he got his crew down into the mine and working, he got out\nthe frequency-transformer, and called Geck to him.\n\n\"Can you find out what is happening on other parts of Guddu?\"\n\nThe native's answers stunned him.\n\n\"Yes, An-yon, all we can mind-talk with any Guddu anywhere. What you\nwish to know?\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter 16\n\n\nThe knowledge that these Guddus of Algon were telepathic rocked George\nHanlon back on his heels. That was a thing he had never even imagined.\nThey were such a simple, almost childlike race, that such an ability was\nfarthest from his thoughts.\n\n\"If you can talk with your minds?\" he asked Geck in wonder, \"why do you\nbother to speak with the voice to each other?\"\n\n\"Because mind-talk more tiring to we,\" came the simple explanation. \"It\ntake much of we's forces. Us grow weak after much of them.\"\n\n\"That makes me hesitate to ask you to do any of it, then,\" the young SS\nman said. \"I was hoping you could find out for me how many mines are\noperated on the planet, and if all of them are using you Guddus as\nslaves.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, An-yon, me know that already,\" Geck's peculiar little face,\nwhich had become so friendly to Hanlon through long association, broke\nout into a smile that was quickly shadowed by sorrow at thought of the\nplight of his people. \"There is nine mines. Human masters make Guddu\nwork in all of they.\"\n\n\"Nine, eh?\" Hanlon thought swiftly for a moment. \"Do they all produce\nthe same ores as this one?\"\n\n\"Will have to find that for you, An-yon. You wait short space of time.\"\n\nThe Greenie grew silent and strained with concentration. Hanlon probed\ninto the native's mind, wondering if he could follow it. And haltingly\nat first, but with growing ability as he learned the pattern, he found\nhe could ride along on that telepathic beam.\n\nThe thoughts were far too swift for him to catch more than an occasional\nconcept, but he was thrilled to realize he was actually telepathing,\neven though at second-hand.\n\nOne after another mind he could feel joining in that conference. There\nwas much hostility and great fear when Geck first tried to explain about\nthe human who was their friend, and had learned to talk with them. The\nGuddus on the other end of that \"line\" were tremendously skeptical,\nafraid, and very, very suspicious of the motives of any human being.\n\nBut Geck was eloquent and persuasive. Before long their fears began to\nlessen, and later they seemed to accept his assurance that \"An-yon\" was,\nindeed, both friendly and anxious to help them escape their slavery.\n\n\"The human An-yon is but one of the most of humans who are kind and just\nand ethical,\" he was surprised to hear Geck telepathing when he got so\nhe could understand. \"It is the few, such as those others who are here,\nwho are not. These are bad men who come here just to get things for own\nselfish ends, and the good men, who are most, will stop them as soon as\nthey can. An-yon come here just for that, to find out what those bad men\ndo, and to stop them.\"\n\nThat speech was another shock to Hanlon--he had never told Geck all\nthat.\n\nThe distant natives finally bowed to Geck's importunings, and gave him\nthe specific information for which he was asking because the friendly\nhuman wanted to know it.\n\nThere were two other mines that produced the same uraninite ore as the\none at which Hanlon was stationed. There were three iron mines, and\nHanlon was not too surprised to learn that at each of these mines\nsmelters had been erected. He learned that humans were used mostly in\nthe mills, the natives being used only for outside labor because they\ncould not stand the heat.\n\n\"We burn quickly,\" was the sad, horrified thought.\n\nThere were three other mines, but the natives did not know the English\nor Greek names for the metals found there. Even after considerable\nquestioning by the roundabout \"Hanlon to Geck to the Guddus back to Geck\nback to Hanlon\" method, he still couldn't get that specific information.\n\n\"If it isn't tiring you too much, Geck, please ask them if there is any\nbuilding going on besides the smelters at the iron mines?\" Hanlon\nrequested.\n\nSoon other minds about the planet were coming in, and the story began to\nunfold--there were several factories making many machines. But none of\nthe natives had the least idea what kind, or for what purpose they were\nbeing made.\n\n\"Think they are going to be put in great metal huts humans are making,\"\none thought ran, and Hanlon quickly grabbed onto that.\n\n\"What sort of metal huts?\"\n\n\"Things that look like huge eggs.\"\n\n\"Space ships, you mean?\"\n\nAnother thought broke in. \"Yes, they like ships human come in, but much\ngreater.\"\n\nHanlon fumed. Oh, if only he could see ... but wait, maybe he could get\nthe information he needed. \"Ask if anyone is looking at one of those\n'eggs' right now,\" he commanded Geck through the transformer.\n\n\"Yes, An-yon, many Guddu right at edge of great place of making. Brother\nof me, Nock, him there.\"\n\n\"Ask him, please, to describe what he sees. Maybe that will give me a\ngood picture of what it is.\"\n\n\"Will be glad to try, but not knowing your language and having no\ncompare your measurement to ours, am not sure can do what you wish,\" he\nfelt Nock say.\n\nThis, too, surprised Hanlon. That native certainly had a real mind, to\ngrasp that difficulty so well, and to realize the limitations of\ntelepathic communications with one alien to his race.\n\n\"Please picture it in your mind as you see it, and use some common\nobjects of the planet for comparison of their sizes,\" Hanlon urged\nthrough Geck's mind. \"That way I think we can get along.\"\n\nAlmost instantly a picture of a gigantic egg formed in his mind, but\nwith enough variations from an actual egg so that Hanlon realized it\nwas, indeed, a space ship the native was viewing. Soon Hanlon saw a\ngreat tree pictured beside the ship, and at the base of the tree a\nnative was standing.\n\nQuickly Hanlon estimated. The adult natives he had seen were almost all\nabout six feet tall. As nearly as he could judge that tree was a good\nfifteen times the height of the Guddu, and the ship was the same height\nas the tree, and nearly three times as long.\n\nWow! What a ship! But it must be wrong. Even the largest Corps' warships\nwere nowhere near that huge. Nor were even any of the biggest freighters\nhe had ever seen. He must be getting his measurements wrong.\n\nHe called Geck, using the transformer. \"Are you seeing what I am in\nNock's mind?\"\n\n\"Yes, An-yon, and you is figure right. Is that big.\"\n\nHanlon slowly shook his head in amazement. If that was meant for a\nwarship, it certainly spelled trouble for someone. He thought seriously\nfor several moments, then telepathed Nock. \"Is there more than one ship\nbeing built?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, there are many many.\" The picture built up of a whole row of\nships, and Hanlon counted swiftly.\n\n_Eighteen!_\n\nFor what purpose was such a fleet being built? Men would not defy the\nI-S C and the Federated Planets this way merely for business reasons, he\nfelt sure. There certainly was a plot being hatched--and what a plot!\n\nHe felt Geck's hand on his arm, and heard his voice. \"Are two more\nplaces where humans build many ship, An-yon. While you think me talk\nmany minds. One place are fourteen more great ones. At other are many\nmany many small ones five to ten Guddu long.\"\n\nShock on shock! Someone was building a tremendous fleet here! He must\nget that news to Corps headquarters as quickly as possible. If those\nships were once finished, they would be able to dominate the system. For\nthe Corps had only a nominal fleet. They had never needed a large one.\n\nTo the best of his knowledge the Corps had only thirty-one first-line\nbattleships, much smaller than these. The Fleet also had fifty heavy\ncruisers, a hundred and fifty light cruisers, and a thousand scouts\nrunning from one-man up to twelve-man size.\n\n\"Please find out if any of those ships they are building have ever left\nthe ground.\"\n\n\"Some little ones only,\" Geck reported after awhile. \"Some few disappear\ninto sky then come back after time, then do same again.\"\n\nTrial trips, or training trips for the crews, Hanlon deduced.\n\nWell, he had some data now, at least. Enough so that once he got that\nnews to Headquarters they would attack this place in force great enough\nto stop this work ... IF ... he could get word to them soon enough.\n\n\"Let's see now,\" he figured quickly. \"I've been here almost twelve\nweeks. That means another six or seven until I'm supposed to be eligible\nto get back to Simonides. Hmmm. Wish I knew how near finished those big\nbattle-wagons are.\"\n\nMore moments of intense thought. \"I don't dare take the chance of trying\nto sneak off to the yards,\" he reasoned logically. \"I've got to do\neverything I can to make sure I get my trip back when my eighteen weeks\nare up. If I got caught off bounds that would ruin everything--I'd\nreally be in a mess.\"\n\nAlso, even if he could get to the shipyards, the moment he was spotted\ntrying to get inside any of those ships he would undoubtedly be killed\nby guards who would certainly shoot first and ask questions later--if\nany.\n\nNor were there any longer any native birds or animals left on Algon he\ncould use--he had learned that the men had killed them off soon after\nthey arrived.\n\n\"No, I'll just have to keep on trying, and get what dope I can without\nexposing myself. With a month and a half I should be able to get a lot\nmore, and with what I already know, the Corps top brass will take steps,\nbut fast!\"\n\nSuddenly a new idea sprang into his mind. Where was \"here?\" In his\nexcitement and planning he had entirely forgotten to finish figuring out\nthat point.\n\nThat evening after dinner he stayed outside, ostensibly walking about\naimlessly, in reality looking at and studying the stars when he was sure\nno one was watching him.\n\nHe couldn't spot any of the more familiar constellations such as the Big\nDipper, Bear, or the Southern Cross. He knew he was far to one side of\nthe galaxy from Terra--that while from there one could see the \"front\"\nof those configurations, now he would be getting a \"sidewise\" view. But\nhe could identify quite a few of the bigger suns and distant nebulae.\n\nHe picked out several blue-white and red giants he was sure he knew.\nThat was Andromeda off there; that one was undoubtedly Orion--no other\ncontained so many 4.0 to 5.2 stars, beside the gigantic Rigel,\nBetelgeuse and Bellatrix.\n\nGood, he could fix all that in his mind well enough to draw it when he\ngot back, and the Corps planetographers certainly would pin-point this\nsystem from those directions. Distance--let's see? He strained to\nremember the time it had taken that freighter to come here, and\nestimated that, with its slower speed, this world was somewhere between\nten and fifteen lights. He would time it more carefully, going back, and\nestimate the ship's speed as closely as possible.\n\nYoung George Hanlon was maturing swiftly under the stress of the\ntremendous task he was attempting. He was learning that he must think\nand plan well ahead of time. He realized he could not afford to make any\nserious mistakes, lest not only his task remain uncompleted, but his\nlife be forfeit as well.\n\nHe knew now that it was absolutely imperative that he get back to\nSimonides at the earliest possible moment, and that the way to be sure\nof this was to so impress Philander that he would feel duty-bound to\ngive Hanlon his vacation at end of the minimum time.\n\nSo Hanlon devoted many hours of serious thought to this problem, and\nfinally figured out several courses of action. The next day, as soon as\nhis shift was over, Hanlon walked across the compound and knocked on the\ndoor of the headquarters office. When bade to enter he did so, hat in\nhand.\n\n\"Have you got a half hour or so to talk, Mr. Philander, sir?\" he asked.\n\"I've got a couple of ideas I'd like to gab with you about, that I think\nmight speed up production even more.\"\n\nThe man looked up in surprise, and his eyes bored deeply, suspiciously\ninto Hanlon's. \"You think you can tell me how to run my job?\" he rasped.\n\n\"Oh, no, sir. I didn't mean about the engineering or supervision. It's\nabout handling the natives, and getting more out of them. You've said I\nwas getting out more ore than the others, and I think perhaps I've got a\nfew ideas--a sort of hunch about making the Greenies themselves more\nproductive.\"\n\n\"Well, come in, come in then. What is it?\"\n\n\"I've been doing a lot of thinking about the Greenies, sir. You remember\nI thought they were vegetable matter, and the way they feed themselves\nthey'd need ground that either has lots of natural chemicals in it, or\nthat has been well-fertilized, to keep 'em well and strong. That being\nthe case, the dirt that forms the floors of their huts and stockades\nwould very quickly become exhausted of those vital chemicals, and the\nnatives would begin suffering from malnutrition, it seems to me. My gang\nhas been slowing down recently, although they still seem to be trying as\nhard as ever.\"\n\n\"Why ... why, yes,\" the superintendent's eyes had widened in surprise as\nHanlon talked. \"That makes sense. Imagine none of us thinking of that!\nBut then, we've always thought of them merely as dumb beasts.\"\n\n\"So I've been wondering if it wouldn't be a good idea either to move the\nstockades every month or so, or else let the natives 'feed' out in the\nopen jungle every day--the sunlight would probably help them, too, being\nvegetable. They could be tied together and guarded, of course, so they\ncouldn't escape.\"\n\nPhilander slumped down into his chair in deep thought, and Hanlon glowed\ninwardly with the hope that something would come of this plan. It would\nhelp him with Philander, if it worked. Also, it would help the Guddus,\nfor Geek had often grown almost hysterical when complaining about the\nterrible hunger they all felt so continuously.\n\nSuddenly Philander sat erect. \"I believe we've got a few sacks of\ncommercial nitrates in the storehouse. Let's experiment and see if they\ncan use that.\"\n\nHe rose purposefully from his desk and the two hurried to one of the\nwarehouses. There Philander soon found the sacks of chemical, and Hanlon\ncarried one as they went to the corral.\n\n\"May we try it on my crew first, sir?\" he asked anxiously. \"They seem to\nsort of like me, and I've learned more or less how to guess their\nreactions by their facial movements, so I think I could tell whether\nthey like it or not.\"\n\n\"Sure, that's a good idea,\" and they went on to the compound that housed\nHanlon's special crew.\n\nInside, while Hanlon apparently chose at random, it was actually Geck to\nwhom he beckoned. When the native approached, feigning fear and\nreluctance--Hanlon hid a sudden grin at Geck's unexpected acting\nbrilliance--the young man opened the sack and poured out a little of the\nnitrate.\n\nHe stooped over and stuck his fingers into the stuff then rose and\ngestured to Geck to put his feeding fingers into it the same way.\nMeanwhile Hanlon was telepathing the exact information to his friend, as\nbest he could with his limited ability.\n\nGingerly Geck stooped, and after a few false starts finally put one of\nhis fingers into the little pile of nitrate, and activated the feeding\nsensories. For a few moments he stood thus, doubtfully, then his manner\nclearly indicated joy and surprised happiness. He began working that\nlittle triangular-shaped mouth, and the others crowded closer.\n\nTelepathically he informed Hanlon that this was wonderful--exactly the\nfood element the natives needed so desperately.\n\n\"It seems to think it's all okay,\" Hanlon said aloud to Philander. \"I'll\nspread out a little more for them all,\" and without waiting for\npermission he made a long, narrow pile of the fertilizer clear across\nthe width of the hut. Instantly the rest of the natives crowded along\nthat line and stuck their feeding fingers into it. Soon their\nsilly-looking faces expressed their equivalent of blissful smiles of\ncomplete satisfaction, and Hanlon's mind was suffused with thoughts of\npleasure and gratitude for his kindness.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 17\n\n\nSuperintendent Philander stood watching the natives feeding, and he\ncould not help seeing how they appeared to appreciate the new food.\nAfter some time he said admiringly, \"It looks like you've hit on\nsomething, George. If it continues to work out, we'll feed all of 'em\nthis stuff, and I'll requisition plenty more next time the freighter\ncomes in.\"\n\nThey left the compound, carefully locking both gates behind them, and\nwalked back to the office. Once there, Hanlon said, \"I see you have a\nchess set, sir. Do you play? I love the game.\"\n\n\"You do?\" Philander's eyes gleamed. \"It's been a long time since there\nwas anyone here who did.\"\n\n\"Then I hope you'll let me come in occasionally for a game. I get\nlonesome here. The other guards aren't worth talking to, and I'm not\neducated enough in science or technology to get in on the arguments of\nthe engineers and other technies.\"\n\n\"Sure, sure, come in any time. I'll be mighty glad to have you, for I\nlove chess. I get lonesome, too, and I have to stay a whole year at a\ntime. Feel free to come in any evening.\"\n\nBack in his room Hanlon left tremendously satisfied with the evening's\nwork. He had done something for the natives that would help make their\nintolerable situation more bearable until the time came when they could\nbe freed of their slavery ... and he had made a new friend who could\nprove very useful.\n\nHe was very anxious for the next work-period to come, so he could talk\nto Geck via the voice-transformer. For he was not yet adept enough at\ntelepathy to be sure he had got all the information needed about the use\nof nitrates in the Guddu's diet.\n\nBut the next day when he went to herd his crew from their compound and\ndown into the mine, he could not help noticing at first glance how much\nsprightlier they looked than the other crews. The minute they had\nreached the stope he unearthed the machine from its hiding place and got\ninto conversation with the friendly Guddu.\n\n\"The food stuff?\" he asked eagerly. \"Is it something you can use?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. An-yon,\" Geck almost sputtered in his eagerness, and words\ntumbled out so swiftly Hanlon could hardly translate them. \"It are\nwonderful! Can you fix so all we can have?\"\n\n\"Yes, they'll all be fed rations of it from now on, although perhaps not\nmuch until the ship can bring more from another planet. I don't know how\nmuch we have on hand. But the Boss-man liked my idea, and is going to\nsee to it that there is always some on hand for all the natives. He'll\nprobably spread the word to the other mines and factories, too.\"\n\n\"Almost us ingest too many last dark,\" Geck gave what Hanlon knew was a\nshamefaced laugh. \"It such very good eat us become ...\" he hesitated.\n\n\"Drunk, you mean?\" Hanlon laughed. \"I can see it might do that to you.\nYou'll have to warn the others about that.\"\n\nThey chatted away for some minutes, about how much the Guddus\nappreciated Hanlon's thoughtfulness.\n\n\"Say, I just wondered,\" Hanlon interrupted Geck's thanks. \"Do you have\nany idea where your planet is located in space? I mean, do you know the\nsuns closest to yours, anything about their distances or magnitudes?\"\n\nGeck's thoughts and expression were a blank, and it took most of the\nwork-period even to make him understand what Hanlon was trying to ask.\nWhen he did finally manage to grasp the thought-concept, his answer was\na decided negative.\n\n\"No, An-yon, us know nothing about other sun other planet. Before humans\ncome suppose we only intelligent life anywhere. Things you call suns us\nthought little fires light sky at night. Wonder many night who build.\nWonder what is burn where is nothing. Wonder why only one big fire come\nday. Wonder why big fire die come night.\"\n\nHanlon's disappointment about that was tempered somewhat when the\nchecker came running into his room where he was resting before dinner,\nto tell him that his crew had suddenly got out almost half a ton more\nore that day than any previous record he had made.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA new cook had come to the mine recently. He had a fox terrier, and\nHanlon got into the habit of playing with the dog, to keep up his\nability to handle animal minds, and to learn more of the technique. He\nwas always careful to say out loud the command for whatever trick he\nwanted the animal to perform, but actually he was controlling its brain\nand nerves and muscles.\n\nOne evening he was working thus with the dog when Gorton, his head-wound\nstill bandaged, came into the messhall. Seeing Hanlon with the terrier,\nhis heavy lip curled.\n\n\"So th' fair-haired boy's also a animal trainer, eh?\"\n\n\"That he is,\" Cookie said from the doorway leading into the kitchen.\n\"And good, too! He's got Brutus doing things I never knew a dog could\ndo.\"\n\nGorton sneered again. \"Teachin' tricks t' a dog is kid stuff.\"\n\n\"Can you do it?\" the cook asked sarcastically.\n\n\"Who'd bother t' try?\"\n\nHanlon looked up, blandly. \"You couldn't expect that of Mr. Gorton,\nCookie. To teach an animal to do tricks you have to know more than it\ndoes.\"\n\n\"Why, you ...\" Gorton started forward, his face aflame, while the other\nmen roared with laughter at the rough wit.\n\nBut the big guard did not reach Hanlon. One of the newer guards, a giant\nSwede named Jenssen, stopped him. \"Aw, lay off the kid, Gort. He's okay.\nThat stunt of feeding the Greenies fertilizer makes 'em turn out lots\nmore work, and we'll get us bigger bonuses 'cause of it.\"\n\nBut Gorton was not the type to know when to quit. Nor was he high enough\nin the ethical scale to know appreciation for the fact that it was the\nvery man he had been reviling who was the first to go to his aid when he\nwas hurt.\n\nHanlon had come to realize that the big man was determined to provoke\nhim to another fight. He knew that tempers were edgy and explosive in\nthis enervating heat, and usually tried to bear Gorton's insults and\npetty meannesses in silence. He wouldn't demean himself by descending to\nthe big guard's low level ... although occasionally, when the heat was\ntoo much even for him, as tonight, he couldn't resist making some\nanswer.\n\nGorton, he had long since decided, was one of those men who, having\nnothing of worth to offer the world, did their utmost to tear down and\nhumiliate anyone who had. And his smallness of soul and intellect were\nshown by the sort of tricks he was continually pulling, thinking them\nsmart.\n\nSuch as scrawling with chalk on Hanlon's room door, \"Super's pet\";\ncontinually upsetting Hanlon's beverage cup, or \"accidentally\" dropping\nthings in Hanlon's plate of food.\n\nThe young SS man could have moved to another place at the table, but he\nwouldn't give the big guard that satisfaction.\n\nBut one of Gorton's tricks backfired to such an extent that it had\ndisastrous results for Gorton himself. That was the night he, knowing\nthat Hanlon had been the last at the compound, sneaked out and unlocked\nall the gates. He figured, of course, that it would be apparent to\neveryone that it was Hanlon's rank carelessness that had allowed all the\nGreenies to escape.\n\nBut to the surprise of everyone--except Hanlon--not a single one had\nleft; all were inside their huts the next morning.\n\nPhilander came running when he heard about it. \"Who did it?\" he demanded\nangrily.\n\n\"Th' punk there, o' course!\" Gorton sneered.\n\nPhilander swivelled about, surprise on his face. \"You, George? Did you\nforget to lock the gates?\"\n\n\"No, sir, I locked them all when I went in to dinner.\"\n\n\"He's lyin'. He was th' last one t' bring up his gang.\"\n\n\"That's true, I was. But I know I locked all the gates very carefully,\nas always.\"\n\nOne of the engineers spoke up. \"I saw him doing it, Pete. I also saw one\nof the other guards leave the messhall for a few minutes just before we\nsat down to eat. When he came back I saw him grinning mysteriously as\nthough very self-satisfied about something.\"\n\n\"Who was that?\"\n\n\"Sorry, I name no names.\"\n\n\"I tell,\" big Jenssen spoke up. \"It was Gort. He's got it in for George.\nHe's one big fool!\"\n\nPhilander wheeled in rage. \"I told you, you brainless slob, to leave\nHanlon alone, and by Jupiter, I mean it! Cut it out! One more stunt, and\nyou go into irons, then back to Sime for an interview with His Highness.\nYou go back next trip anyway. I'm done with you.\"\n\nThe rest of the men stood by in hostile silence, and it was clear from\ntheir attitudes that this time Gorton had gone too far. How it happened\nnone of the natives had run away, puzzled them all.\n\nBut Hanlon guessed, and when he had taken his crew down to work he\ncalled Geck to him, and by means of the transformer asked about it.\n\n\"Was one Guddu in hut by main gate who first see gate were open. Him\nmind-tell all we to run far into forest. This crew us stop all they.\nTell other Guddu how kind are you. How you get we 'oigm'-food. Tell how\nyou's work to make all we free; make free all Guddu everywhere. Us say\nmaybe so we's all get free now small time. But say come humans with\nshock-rod, hunt we, hurt we, make we work more hard, be more cruel to\nwe. Say then plan of you never get chance to make all we free all time.\"\n\nHanlon bowed his head in silent thanks for the tremendous compliment. \"I\nonly hope I can justify your faith in me, Geck,\" he said humbly. \"It\nwill be a miracle if I can bring it about, but I certainly intend to\nkeep on trying. It will take some time, you know that. I can't possibly\ndo anything until after I leave here. But if it's humanly possible, I'll\nbring the fleet here to free you.\"\n\n\"Us know will be hard, that maybeso it never come we be free,\" the Guddu\nsaid. \"But us know you are only hope. So us help you all us can. Guddu\nin mines try get more rock out as you say. But Guddu who help humans\nbuild big egg you call 'ships' do most. Each day some of they find way\nbreak something, do wrong thing. Two Guddu spoil much metal when jump in\nvat where metal be melt.\"\n\n\"Oh, no!\" Hanlon cried in shocked anguish. \"That was wonderfully brave\nof them, but none of the others must ever do things like that! Tell them\nnot to sacrifice their lives that way! I feel sure from all the reports\nit isn't needed. I'll be going back in another few weeks, and the humans\nwon't have any of those biggest ships ready by then. Those are the only\nones we need to fear--the little ships don't count.\"\n\nIt was too bad Hanlon did not know what else the humans were building,\nbesides ships, at the shipyards.\n\nHanlon's campaign to \"get in good\" with Philander was bearing tasty\nfruit, for the two were becoming fast friends. They spent many evenings\nover a hotly-contested chess board. It was plain now that the nervous,\nworried superintendent felt he could relax in the company of this young,\nnaive guard, for the latter was so patently no challenge to his\nposition. Besides, it was also very evident that he liked Hanlon as a\nman. Day by day his attitude grew more fatherly.\n\nHanlon, on his part, came to realize more the true, innate measure of\nPhilander's inherent worth as a man, a gentleman, and an engineer. He\nhad a fine mind, was well read, and thought deeply on many subjects\noutside his own technical line.\n\n\"All he needs are some psychiatric treatments to reduce that awful\ninferiority complex of his,\" Hanlon mused one night as he walked back\nslowly to his room. \"Then he'll really be the big, fine man he's capable\nof being, and will forget all this conspiracy nonsense.\"\n\nThus Hanlon felt he was taking no special chance one night when the two\nwere standing on the little porch of the office, their game ended, and\nHanlon about to leave. He glanced up at the brilliant night sky.\n\n\"Sure looks different here than it does back on Terra,\" he said\nconversationally. \"Naturally it would, seeing we're so far away from\nthere. But I never get tired of looking at it, and trying to see if I\ncan figure out some of the brighter suns.\" He pointed to one bright star\ndirectly overhead. \"That's Sirius, I know. It's always directly above\nyou.\"\n\nPhilander laughed heartily. \"No, Sirius is almost exactly opposite.\nDon't forget we're about a hundred light years out from Sol.\"\n\nHanlon made himself look crestfallen. \"And there I was sure I knew one\nof 'em, at least.\" He yawned pretentiously. \"Well, guess I'll hit the\nhay. Reckon the stars'll stay put, whether I can pick 'em out or not.\"\n\nPhilander laughed again, and clapped him on the back in comradely\nfashion. \"I wouldn't wonder. Goodnight, George.\"\n\n\"'Night, Mr. Philander.\" And as Hanlon walked back to his own room his\nheart was light. He'd learned another important fact about their\nlocation in space--the approximate distance from Sol.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 18\n\n\nA few nights later one of the junior engineers came running into the\noffice where Hanlon and Philander were playing chess.\n\n\"Trouble down in Stope Four,\" he gasped.\n\nPhilander jumped up, upsetting the board. He grabbed his glo-light and\nstarted out.\n\n\"Want me along, sir?\" Hanlon asked.\n\n\"Might as well,\" and Hanlon ran with them.\n\nDown in the mine they found, after examination, that it was not as bad\nas it at first seemed. Some timbers had rotted away--or had not been\ngood wood in the first place--and a rock fall had occurred. But once\nthey started working at it, they found it not too big. Hanlon was sent\nrunning for the rest of the men, and in a few hours everything was all\ntight again.\n\nBack in the office Hanlon picked up the fallen chess pieces while\nPhilander and the engineers talked for some time. When they left Hanlon\nasked, \"Want to finish the game--or rather, since the board was upset,\nwant to play another?\"\n\n\"Better make it a rain-check. I've got some paper work I should do. Make\nit tomorrow.\"\n\n\"That's okay with me. I'll go hit the hay.\"\n\n\"Thanks for your help tonight, George. You pitched in so gladly, while\nthe others were surly and grumbling. It was very noticeable, and I\nappreciate it. You're a good kid. Wish I had one just like you.\"\n\nHanlon flushed a bit, and couldn't meet his friend eye to eye. \"I was\nglad to do it,\" he said lamely. \"'Night,\" and he ran out. Blast it, he\nthought, I hate using Pete that way, 'cause he's really a swell egg\nunderneath. But the job's more important.\n\nA few nights later they had finished the second game, and the elder had\nwon both. He was consequently in very good humor, for the two were so\nevenly matched it was seldom either ever won two games in the same\nevening.\n\nPhilander leaned back in his chair and smiled at the younger man. \"Well,\nGeorge, the freighter'll be here in three days, and I'm sending you back\nfor your vacation.\"\n\n\"Gee, thanks, Chief. That's swell of you. I'm going to miss you, but\nI'll admit I'll be glad to get away from this awful climate for a while.\nThis place sure gets my goat--I can't seem to get used to it all.\"\n\n\"Then you won't want to come back?\" There was disappointment in the\nquestion.\n\n\"Oh, no, I didn't mean that. I sure will be back if I can make it. Maybe\nthis job isn't exactly what I'd dreamed about,\" he had to hedge that\nstatement a bit, and tried to make a sincere-sounding explanation, \"but\nthat thousand credits a month is!\"\n\n\"That reminds me--I want to be sure to recommend you for a good bonus.\nYou deserve it more'n any guard we've ever had here. Then, too, your\nideas of rotating your crew, and especially that fertilizer deal, have\nraised the effective work-life and speed of the natives almost thirty\npercent. I figured it out, and they'll be getting off cheap if they give\nyou what I'm recommending--two months pay as a bonus.\"\n\n\"Yowie!\" Hanlon yelled, making his face show excitement, and that\ncurious avarice he had so carefully built up in these suspicious men's\nminds. \"That'll make me six thou in four months. I'll be rich yet!\"\n\n\"You and your urge for money,\" Philander laughed, yet there was a\ncurious undertone of almost-contempt in his voice. \"Why're you so hipped\non that subject?\"\n\nHanlon grinned and misquoted, \"Life is real, life is earnest, and the\ngravy is my goal.\" Then he sobered and said, \"'Cause with money you can\ndo anything. When I've made a big pile, then I can go where I want to\ngo, be what I want to be, and make people know I'm somebody.\"\n\nPhilander shrugged. \"Maybe you're right, but I'd say there were better\nways, George.\"\n\nHanlon looked doubtful. \"I have the utmost respect for your ideas and\ngreater experience, sir, but what's better than a big wad of credits.\"\n\nPhilander looked more seriously thoughtful than Hanlon had ever seen him\nbefore. He was silent a moment, then answered slowly, \"This may sound\n'old-mannish,' but I believe steady advancement in whatever work you\nchoose; growing knowledge of many things; creative imagination put to\nconstructive use; the growing respect and consequent advance in\nresponsibility from your employers if you're working for someone, or\nfrom your neighbors if you're in business for yourself--those things\nare, in my opinion, of much greater value than the mere accumulation of\nmoney. And the best part of it is, that if you grow in those ways, that\nextra money will come to you, but merely as a corollary addition to the\ngreater achievements.\"\n\n\"I see your point,\" Hanlon was greatly impressed by Philander's\nearnestness. \"Maybe you're right. I'm still just a kid, I guess, with a\nkid's immature outlook. That's why I appreciate your friendship and\nadvice so much, sir. You've been almost like a second father to me.\"\nThis was honest--he liked Philander now more than ever.\n\nThe look on the elder's face, too, defied description, but that he was\nsecretly pleased was evident.\n\n\"Well, run along then, and I'll get at that letter. Meanwhile get your\nthings packed, so you'll be ready to leave when the ship comes. And\nGeorge, my boy, I do hope you come back. It'll be mighty lonely here\nwithout you.\"\n\n\"I'll certainly do my best to get back, sir. Goodnight, and thanks\nagain ... for everything.\"\n\nHanlon hated that seeming lie, and as he walked slowly back to his room\nhe determined to get the man away from those plotters, and into a better\nand more legitimate position.\n\nHe would certainly so recommend to the Secret Service High Command after\nthis mess was cleaned up.\n\nThe next days Hanlon spent almost his entire shift-time underground\ntalking earnestly to Geck.\n\n\"I want to impress on the minds of you and all the natives here that\nI'll be working my hardest for them every minute I'm gone,\" he said\nimpressively. \"Don't let them do anything foolish unless or until it\nbecomes completely sure that I've failed. If I can do anything at all,\nit should be within a quarter year after I leave, and probably much\nsooner. If I succeed, you'll all be free, and these men either chased\noff your planet or killed.\"\n\n\"All we understand, An-yon. We know you are true friend, know you want\nto help us. We will keep working, make no attempts to escape. We know if\ndo we just be killed, or hunted and caught again. Condition of we before\nyou come so bad we had come to feel only end for us be death of race.\nNow you bring hope. Now we know most humans good people, so we wait in\nhope you soon succeed.\"\n\n\"That's the spirit. I know it's tough on all of you, but I also know\nwhat the Inter-Stellar Corps is, and what they can and will do when they\nlearn of your plight.\"\n\nHe linked his mind with Geck's as the latter telepathed the natives in\nother parts of the planet, and was thus enabled to get final\ndescriptions of what they could tell of what was being done at each mine\nand factory and shipyard. He knew exactly how many ships had been built\nor were under construction, and approximately how far along the hulls of\nthe big ones were completed. He was also able to get a very good general\nknowledge of the size and structural description of each type of vessel.\n\nBut of their armaments or propulsive methods he had not been able to get\nany information--such things were too far beyond the natives' simple\nabilities to describe or picture for him.\n\nHanlon's ability to telepath, through Geck, was growing much stronger,\nalthough he was still not able to telepath direct to any of the distant\nGuddus. He could, however, do so to some extent to one close by.\n\nBut he still could not read anything in a human mind except the surface\nthoughts. And how he could use that ability! With that, his task would\nbe much simpler.\n\nBut he had learned to be content with what he had, realizing it was\nundoubtedly unique in human history. It had brought him this far along,\nand he had collected a lot of information which he could not have gained\nin any other manner--information that he could report to the Corps as\nsoon as he got back to Simonides and had the chance to go to the bank or\ncontact them in some other way.\n\n\"Liberation Day,\" as Hanlon had taken to calling it in his mind, finally\narrived. He was all packed and waiting for the ship. When it was sighted\nhe and Philander went to the field to meet it.\n\nWhen the captain came out, the three stood in conversation while the\ncrew hurriedly unloaded the supplies they had brought, and those leaving\nhad gone aboard. The captain handed Philander some letters, but the\nlatter shoved them in his pocket for the time beings without stopping to\nlook at them.\n\nFinally it was time for blast-off, and Hanlon said his last farewells to\nthe superintendent, then went in to stow his bags in his stateroom and\nprepare for take-off. He had expected to be locked in again, and merely\ntried the door out of curiosity. But to his surprise it wasn't locked,\nso he went out. He was wise enough not to attempt to invade the control\nroom, but did hunt up a viewing-screen and strap himself into the chair\nbefore it.\n\nHe manipulated the dials and had just got an outside view as the pilot\nbegan activating the tubes. Hanlon saw Philander come running from the\nlittle path through the jungle, back toward the field, waving a letter,\ntrying to attract attention.\n\nBut evidently neither the captain, pilot nor any watch officer saw him,\nfor at that moment the great wash of flame from the tubes blotted out\nthe scene, and Hanlon was forced deeply into his acceleration chair as\nthe ship lifted gravs.\n\nThe trip back was uneventful. Hanlon kept careful track of the time, and\nstrained all his spaceman's senses properly to evaluate their speed. As\nthe ship braked for the landing on Simonides he completed his\ncalculations, and was quite sure the distance between the two planets\nwas twelve and a quarter light years, plus or minus not over two\npercent, and that Algon was somewhere near right ascension eighteen\nhours, and declination plus fifteen degrees.\n\nAs he passed through the airlock and started down the plank, he was\nsurprised and a bit dismayed to see Panek and two of the other gunmen he\nhad seen in that back room, waiting for him, their faces impassive and\nunreadable.\n\n\"A welcoming committee, eh?\" he greeted them with a smile that tried to\ncover his disappointment. \"Hiya, Panek! Hi, fellows!\"\n\nBut his heart was doing flip-flops. These men were not here just because\nthey were glad to see him, of that he was sure. He probed their minds\nand even before Panek spoke, he knew.\n\n\"The boss sent us to bring you to see him first thing, the boss did,\"\nPanek's voice was gruff, yet somewhat friendly.\n\n\"That's mighty nice of him,\" Hanlon tried not to let his feelings show,\nbut to take this as a natural courtesy. But he had so much wanted to get\nto the bank immediately. \"I was coming to report, of course,\" he\ncommented. \"Got a letter for him from Superintendent Philander. Besides,\nI got a flock of credits coming. Boy, did I earn 'em! That's a stinking,\nhot planet up there. It'll be good seeing the bright lights again,\nbesides living in a decent climate once more.\"\n\nThe two men grunted a mysterious laugh, but Panek merely indicated the\nway to the aircar. Again Hanlon was blindfolded, but now he didn't\ncare--he knew the location of this crater field.\n\nThere was silence during most of the trip. Hanlon babbled away at first,\nbut when no one answered him he gradually slowed his words and finally\nshut up entirely.\n\nHis mind probings told him he was in for a rough time, and he got the\nfeeling he was not supposed to be there at all, for some reason.\n\n\"Oh, oh!\" he thought, almost in panic. \"Something's wrong. Did I slip\nsomewhere? Have they got wind of what I've learned? But how ... how\ncould they?\"\n\nInstead of taking him to the back room of the Bacchus, Hanlon found when\nthe blindfold was finally removed that he was in a stone-walled room\nthat he sensed was a sort of cellar in some huge building. It was bare\nof furniture except for two chairs and the glo-lights, one of which was\non a standard like a spotlight.\n\nBefore he had time to try to puzzle things out, the door opened and the\nman he had thought of merely as \"the leader\" came in and sat down in one\nof the chairs. He gestured, and the men pushed Hanlon into the facing\nseat, and adjusted the glo-light so it shone in his eyes. Then ranged\nthemselves behind him.\n\n\"So, you got back?\" the Leader said softly.\n\n\"Sure,\" Hanlon made himself act as though nothing was out of the way,\nbut it was an effort to smile and talk naturally when his mouth was\nsuddenly dry and his nerves tightened almost to the screaming point. \"My\ntime was up, so Mr. Philander sent me back. I've got a letter for you\nfrom him.\"\n\nHe started to reach into his pocket, but Panek slapped his hand down,\nand snaked the letter out, handing it to the Leader, who opened it and\nread it silently.\n\nThen the man looked up, his face puzzled. \"You seem to\nhave ... uh ... done very well there,\" he said almost pleasantly. \"Our\nsuperintendent reports you made an excellent guard. He seems very pleased\nwith you.\"\n\n\"I told you I'd do everything I could to make good,\" Hanlon answered,\nbut now he made his voice sound very aggrieved. \"What's the big idea of\nall this? Seems like a mighty funny reception, after I tried so hard.\nWhy that light in my eyes, and those thugs ready to slug me if I bat an\neye-lash. It's almost like you don't trust me, or something?\"\n\n\"I'm still not altogether sure we do,\" the Leader said slowly.\n\n\"Still harping on that?\" Hanlon demanded hotly. \"What makes you think\nI'm not on the up and up? I worked hard on that stinking hot planet. I\ngot out more ore'n anyone else ever did. And my suggestion about\nnitrates ...\"\n\n\"Ah, yes, the matter of the ... uh ... fertilizer. What made you bring\nthat up?\"\n\n\"The minute I saw those Greenies I guessed they were animated trees.\nWhen I saw how they fed themselves by sticking their fingers in the hut\nfloor, I figured the dirt would gradually lose whatever nourishment it\ncontained, same as a farmer's fields soon lose their fertility. All\nplants I know about extract nitrogen and other minerals from the soil.\nSo I figured the Greenies would need fertilizer to make up for the\ndepleted soil in their huts. It seemed simple to me.\"\n\n\"Ummm. You were right, apparently. It was a great contribution to our\nwork, and we are grateful.\" He looked at Hanlon a long moment, then\nasked sharply, \"How did Rellos die?\"\n\n\"A dog tore out his throat.\"\n\n\"We know that--but you said you killed him.\"\n\n\"Who d'you suppose sicced the dog on him? We were walking down the\nstreet, and I kicked the dog's pup to death. When she charged, I pushed\nRellos in her path, and it was him the dog killed.\"\n\n\"Ah! Good! Very unusual! Most ... uh ... ingenious!\" The Leader seemed\npleased, but slowly his smile died and he frowned again. \"All this makes\nme want to believe you, Hanlon, but somehow I can't seem to rid myself\nof the belief that you still are connected with the Corps. Oh, I know,\"\nas Hanlon started to protest, \"all about your dismissal and disgrace,\nand the fight you had with some of your former classmates a few days\nlater. Incidentally, wasn't it rather straining coincidence that it was\nan admiral who came along just in time to save you? You see, all that\ncould easily have been done on purpose. I'm ... uh ... not that simple,\nyoung man.\"\n\n\"No, but you're nuts, figuring that way!\" disgustedly.\n\n\"I think you will find out differently,\" the tone sent shivers through\nthe young SS man's nerves, and he had difficulty controlling the impulse\nto wet his suddenly dry lips. \"I may be wrong--I hope most sincerely\nthat I am--but I haven't so far been able to bring myself to feel so.\nBut I intend to know for sure before we leave this room. Panek, bring in\nour other ... uh ... guest.\"\n\nHanlon heard the gunman leave, and in a moment return. He appeared in\nHanlon's line of vision, pushing before him a manacled man.\n\nAt sight of that other man, Hanlon had to gasp.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 19\n\n\n\"Oh!\" the Leader said triumphantly as he saw George Hanlon's start of\nsurprise. \"I see you recognize our guest.\"\n\n\"Sure I know him,\" Hanlon snapped, rigidly forcing himself into control.\n\"That's Abrams. I thought I killed him.\"\n\n\"Ah, now, did you so?\" Again the Leader smiled, but this time grimly.\n\"Now we come to the meat of the matter. You say you thought you killed\nhim, but you know you didn't. Your pretended assassination in such a\nclever manner was all a ruse--you didn't poison him at all. You merely\npretended to put something in his cup.\"\n\n\"That's a lie. Maybe it didn't work on him, but I did ...\"\n\n\"Sorry, Mr. Hanlon,\" the trembling Abrams whined the interruption. \"I\nwas forced to tell the whole story to His Highness after he found out\nwhere I was hiding.\"\n\nHis Highness!\n\nSo this was the fabulous monster of whom everyone was so afraid.\nHanlon's heart sank to his knees. What chance did he have now? He would\nnever get out of this alive, nor get his report to the Corps.\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Hanlon,\" that silky voice mimicked meaningly, and venomously.\n\"We have ... uh ... ways of making people talk. This Abrams, like a\nfool, was not content to continue working as my secretary. He had to get\nfoolish notions of ethics and patriotism, and try to ... uh ... object\nto some of my policies. Why did you let him think you were still a\nCorpsman ... if you're not?\" he snapped suddenly.\n\nHanlon made himself stare back insolently. Maybe they would kill\nhim ... no, be honest, undoubtedly they would ... but by the Shade of\nSnyder they weren't going to make him show the fear he felt.\n\n\"Use your head, Pal. I had to make an impression on Panek so he'd\nintroduce me to someone here on Sime who'd show me how to make some\nfast, big money, which is all I'm after,\" he retorted with a bravado he\ncertainly didn't feel, but which he hoped would make them think he did.\n\"When I found Panek was going to bump off Abrams, I horned in on it. And\nwhat easier way to make Abrams play ball with me--I had nothing against\nhim, and didn't want to really kill him--than to let him think I was\nstill a Corpsman, after he'd seen me when I was still a cadet. I didn't\nknow he'd turn yellow and squeal.\"\n\nHe looked contemptuously at Abrams, then turned back to the leader and\nmade his voice very earnest, very emphatic. \"But I've told you the\ntruth! I am not still connected with that rotten outfit, and you're\nwrong if you think I am!\"\n\n\"Don't lie to His Highness!\" Panek interjected. \"He don't like to be\nlied to--he don't like it.\"\n\n\"Aw shut up and keep out of this, small fry!\" Hanlon sneered, and was\nrewarded with a hard blow on the side of his head that made him wince.\nBut His Highness intervened.\n\n\"That will do, Panek. I'll handle this. Now, Hanlon, I think you had\nbetter do some very serious thinking. You can see why we are still\nskeptical of you. Everything points against you ... uh ... except your\nown word, and the fact that you so apparently did work hard and for our\nbest interests at the mine. That point, I readily grant you, is very\nmuch in your favor. I am being very patient with you because, if you are\ntelling the truth, you can be a very valuable man to me. You do have\nreal ability, and other assets. But if you are not wholly for us, you\nare distinctly in our way.\"\n\n\"I tell you ...\"\n\n\"Don't interrupt, please. I might inform you that I sent you to the\nother planet both to test you and to keep you out of the way while we\ninvestigated further and I could reach a decision. You were not supposed\nto come back yet. I sent Philander a letter to that effect, but he\nspace-radioed you were already on the way back when he read it.\"\n\nA light dawned on Hanlon as memory skipped back to that take-off.\nPhilander had merely stuck the mail in his pocket when it was given him,\nand evidently started reading it on his way back to the mine. That\nexplained his running back, waving a letter and trying to attract\nattention just at blast-off.\n\nThat small part of his mind that was paying attention to the men in the\nroom heard His Highness say \"take Abrams away. He ... uh ... is of no\nfurther use to us. And wait outside until I call--all of you.\"\n\nWhen they had gone His Highness leaned forward, and Hanlon knew he had\nbetter pay strict attention and keep his wits about him for any opening\nto improve his perilous position.\n\n\"I'll speak more frankly, now that we are alone, Hanlon. I am impressed\nwith you. I think you have ... uh ... tremendous abilities, and I want\nyou on my side. But I have to be sure. I would advise you, for your own\ngood, to be honest and frank with me.\"\n\n\"I am being, but you won't believe me,\" Hanlon said earnestly. \"When I\ntake a man's pay, sir, I give him everything I've got. You gave me a\nchance at the kind of money I want to make, and I'm doing everything I\ncan to earn both the money and your trust. I was kicked out of the\nCorps, and I'll do _anything_ I can to get even!\"\n\n\"As I said before, we have ... uh ... ways of making you tell us the\ntruth,\" the Leader continued as though Hanlon had not interrupted, \"but\nyou would not be any good either to us or the Corps or yourself if we\nhave to use ... uh ... persuasion. I don't want to see you broken. You\nmay remember you once asked me if I could 'dish it out'? Let me assure\nyou that I can.\"\n\n\"But how can I prove anything when you've already made up your mind not\nto believe me?\" Hanlon asked plaintively. \"I'm doing my best to make you\nbelieve. I'll admit some of those points you've brought up could look\nfishy if viewed from one standpoint, but I assure you you're putting the\nwrong interpretation on them. If you'll look at them from my viewpoint\nyou'll see they are just as true.\"\n\nHis Highness regarded Hanlon silently but with a steady concentration\nfor some minutes. \"That might be true. I had about begun to believe you\nwhen we found Abrams, and when we questioned him he ... uh ... admitted\nwhat you had done, and why. That revived my doubts. Are you willing to\nbe tested under a truth drug?\"\n\nHanlon almost gasped in dismay, but stifled it. He knew only too well\nthe efficacy of modern truth drugs. They would reveal every thought and\nbit of knowledge he had ever had--all about the Corps, the Secret\nService and everything.\n\nThat hurt look came back into his face. \"You sure are asking a lot,\nsir,\" he said. \"I haven't anything to conceal from you, but no man likes\nto have his whole mind invaded that way--all his private thoughts and\nfeelings. I don't see why you need suggest such a thing. I've told you\nthe truth on matters you want to know about.\"\n\n\"You appear to have done so, and I honestly want to believe you. For you\nsee, Hanlon, I want you with me. You're my kind of a man. I like you\nbecause you have tremendous drive and imagination and ability--yes,\nand perhaps a bit because you're the only man I've ever met who\nwasn't ... uh ... afraid of me. I have tremendous plans for the\nfuture--and I would like to have you as my chief aide in them. I would\ntrain you as you've never guessed it possible for a man to be trained.\nAnd then, _together, Hanlon, we could rule the Universe_!\"\n\nBut George Hanlon was only half-listening, even to that last, that\nshocking, that totally unexpected proposition, his real goal. Here was\nthe plot he had been seeking, the plot the Corps needed so desperately\nto know. Yet his personal crisis was, for the moment, more important if\nhe was ever to be of any further benefit to the Secret Service or the\nCorps. To use his just-discovered knowledge, something else must come\nfirst.\n\nHis mind, therefore, was seeking a way out. He well knew that once the\ntruth drug was administered--and this Highness would not now be\nsatisfied with anything less--he was as good as dead. They would find\nout the truth in minutes, and then would have no other recourse but to\nkill him.\n\nHis spirits sank to nadir with the knowledge that he had\nfailed ... failed the Secret Service and the Corps, failed his father,\nfailed the Guddus, failed himself. Curiously, perhaps, at that moment\nthe thought of failure was far more important to him than the imminence\nof death, as such.\n\nHe had half-consciously noticed when he first glanced about this room,\nthat there was a small ventilator near the ceiling in one corner.\nDesperately he pushed his mind through it, and could sense that it\nopened onto a park-like place, probably around one of the city's\npalaces.\n\nHanlon finally heard His Highness call, \"Panek, you and the others bring\nme the hypodermic. We'll have to give him the truth serum. I'm sorry,\nHanlon,\" he addressed himself now to the young man, \"but this is the\nonly way. I hope we won't have to use enough to harm you, but that\ndepends on your co-operation. If you will tell us the truth quickly and\nwillingly I can, as I said ... uh ... use you, and you will profit\ngreatly by it.\"\n\nHanlon didn't struggle when they bound him firmly in the chair with\nmanacles on hands and feet. He knew it would be useless anyway. He let\nhis body slump into his chair, and again directed his mind through that\nvent. He must not let them defeat him! He had to survive--to get\nword--to the Corps!\n\nThen his searching mind contacted another--a weak, primitive one, but a\nmind. Avidly he fastened onto it, merged with it ... and found himself\ninside the brain of one of those Simonidean pigeons.\n\nAh! This is wonderful! Pigeons seldom fly alone. Where you find one you\nalmost always find a number. Activating the bird's brain he sent out a\ncall to others of its kind that it had found food in abundance. Soon\nmore and more of them flew down to where the now enslaved pigeon was\nstanding, and as each one came, Hanlon sent into its brain all of his\nmind it would hold.\n\nInside the cellar room His Highness rose and stepped up to Hanlon's\nbody, the hypodermic in his hand. \"Remove his coat and roll up his\nsleeve,\" he directed Panek, and the small part of Hanlon's mind still\nremaining in his body felt the latter doing so, and an instant later,\nthe prick of the needle.\n\nSlowly at first, then with increasing swiftness he felt his remaining\nmind growing numb and his will weaken. His body slumped against the\nrestraining manacles.\n\n\"Can you hear me, George Hanlon?\" he dimly heard His Highness' voice.\n\n\"Yes.\" It sounded like a whisper.\n\n\"Are you a member of the Inter-Stellar Corps?\"\n\n\"I ... I ...\", he struggled not to answer.\n\n\"Tell me!\"\n\n\"I ... I ...\" and then, in a last desperate effort to keep from telling\nwhat he must not tell, George Hanlon did a thing he had never dared\nattempt before. He sent all the remaining parts of his mind into the\nlast of the pigeons.\n\nOne of the first birds he had already sent into the ventilator so he\ncould look through it into the room below. He got it there just in time\nto hear the Leader's gasp of dismay as he saw Hanlon's body slump still\nfurther in apparent lifelessness.\n\n\"Is he dead, Boss, is he?\" he heard Panek's anxious cry.\n\nHis Highness felt the pulse in Hanlon's wrist and the one in his throat.\n\"No, he's still alive.\"\n\nThe man stood there in deep thought, his forehead creased with a frown\nof concentration. \"There's something peculiarly wrong here,\" the Leader\nfinally said aloud. \"Something very wrong and very strange. This isn't\nan ordinary fainting spell. It's ... uh ... beyond my previous\nexperience.\"\n\nHe straightened and addressed Hanlon's body once more. \"Can you still\nhear me, George Hanlon?\"\n\nThere was no answer, no slightest indication that his words were heard.\nHe reached forward and lifted the body into a more upright position in\nthe chair. \"Answer me, George Hanlon. Do you hear me? I command you to\ntell me, are you a Corpsman?\"\n\nStill no answer, no twitch of muscle, no movement of awareness. He shook\nthe body a little, and raised his voice still more.\n\n\"I demand an answer, George Hanlon! The truth drug must make you speak!\"\n\nBut only silence, and when he let go of the body it fell backward into\nthe chair, and the head lolled forward as though the neck was broken.\n\n\"Let me work on him, Boss,\" Panek pleaded. \"Let me give him a going\nover, let me.\"\n\nBarely waiting to see that His Highness did not forbid it, the thug\nraised a short, ugly piece of rubber hose, and struck the unresisting\nbody again and again--across the face, over the top and back of the\nhead, vicious blows at the ribs and even in the groin.\n\nBut he might as well have been pounding a sack of meal. The body sagged\nbeneath the blows, and became bloody and discolored, but no movement--no\nconscious movement--did it make.\n\n\"That will do, Panek,\" His Highness finally commanded. \"That\ndoes no good. This I cannot understand, but I do know there\nis ... uh ... something most peculiar here. It is almost as\nthough ...\", he paused and frowned again. \"But that is ridiculous!\"\n\n\"What's ridiculous, Boss, what is?\"\n\n\"It is almost as though there was ... uh ... no mind left in the body,\"\nHis Highness said slowly. Then, abruptly, \"Are you sure that was\ntruth-serum in that hypodermic?\"\n\n\"You fixed it yourself, Boss.\"\n\nHis Highness wheeled suddenly, rudely awakened from his thinking by the\nloud _shoo_-ing noise one of the guards was making. He was astonished to\nsee the man making vain motions toward a pigeon whose head was sticking\nthrough, the ventilator vanes.\n\nBut the bird didn't leave.\n\n\"Stop it!\" the Leader commanded impatiently. \"We've more import ...\"\n\nHe checked himself, and turned back to stare wonderingly at the bird,\nwhich peered back at him with apparently unfrightened, beady eyes,\nturning its head to first one side and then the other, as though better\nto see all that was going on.\n\n\"That's peculiar,\" His Highness said thoughtfully. \"I never saw a bird\nact like that before. Hmmm, I wonder?... But no, that's absurd.\"\n\nHe turned back to Hanlon's body as though disgusted with himself for\nentertaining such a fantastic notion. Hands behind his back, that scowl\nof concentration engraving deep lines on his face, the Leader paced\nforth and back across the floor of the little room, his glance ever and\nagain returning to stare in exasperation at that slumped-over,\ndead-but-alive body.\n\nWho was this amazing young man? What sort of talents and abilities did\nhe possess, that he could react thus to a truth-serum? Had he been so\ntreated by the Corps experts that his mind would be blanked out in such\nemergencies? Was he some kind of a mutant with powers never before\nknown? Or--startling thought--was he actually a human being at all?\n\nBetter than anyone else, His Highness could appreciate the fact that the\nuniverse contained many types of sentient and highly mental life other\nthan those originating on Terra. Since he had come here to Simonides,\nand had wormed his way into the very highest position beneath its\nemperor--a weak old man he had had no trouble dominating--he was\nnaturally suspicious of anyone who might be attempting to discover and\nwreck his carefully-laid plans.\n\nSuch a one, he was now convinced, was this young Hanlon. It would be the\nsimplest thing to kill this almost-dead body now, but that would not\nsolve this baffling problem. If Hanlon, perhaps others of the Corps had\nsimilar powers. No, one with such abilities must not be killed. He must\nbe kept and studied, and the secret learned if possible.\n\nBut his thoughts were interrupted by Panek. \"That fool bird's still\nthere, still there. Is it another of your pets, Boss?\"\n\nHis Highness wheeled. He had forgotten the bird. Was it possible that\nHanlon had, in some inexplicable manner, transferred ... on the surface\nit was an absurd concept. But, there were magicians on his home planet\nwho could do things almost as unfathomable.\n\nHe suddenly made up his mind. \"Kill it!\" he commanded.\n\nWhatever else he was or was not, Panek was fast with a gun. The words\nwere hardly spoken when he had drawn and fired.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 20\n\n\nThe twentieth part of Hanlon's mind activating the pigeon in the\nventilator, commanded it to scramble back out the moment he sensed what\nthat command would be. But it wasn't quick enough.\n\nHe felt the burning sensation along the bird's side, and the agony it\nsuffered. The wing had been almost severed by the shot, and its life was\nswiftly ebbing.\n\nHe had to get out of that body and quick ... but there were no more\npigeons around except the other nineteen he was already occupying. Nor\ndid any of them have brain capacity enough to contain more than a\ntwentieth of his mind.\n\nDesperately he sent the rest of the flock swirling into the air, seeking\nother life-forms nearby. There were no other pigeons close enough to\nhear their calls nor to get there in time if they did, for the wounded\nbird was dying fast.\n\nNor were there any dogs about, nor cats, nor animals of any kind to be\nseen. In desperation Hanlon even tried the trees or plants there, to see\nif they had minds like the Guddus--but none of them did.\n\nHe dreaded to think what would happen if the brain that a portion of his\nmind was occupying died while in his control. Would that part of his\nmind then be lost? He had no way of knowing, nor was he anxious to\nchance it, for he was terribly afraid it would be so. And he certainly\nhad proved he had no mind to spare, he thought in disgust. He had really\nmade a mess of this mission. The only way he could get word to the Corps\nwas through his body, and if he sent his mind back into that now he was\na deader duck than he seemed to be. For even that twentieth part could\nbe made to talk.\n\n_Why didn't those pigeons hurry?_\n\nYet he knew they were searching frantically. This was the weirdest\nsensation imaginable. People had often expressed the wish they, could be\nin two places at once ... he was in twenty. And each body was connected\nwith the others by a thin thread of consciousness, yet was thinking and\nacting independently.\n\nHis composite mind almost grinned. If anyone had told him a year ago\nsuch a thing was possible, he would have called for the paddy-wagon and\nrushed that person to the nearest nut-house.\n\nThe other parts of his mind were flying all about the enclosed park that\nwas a part of the great palace, searching, desperately seeking some\nother form of life that could be used as a housing for the dying part of\nHanlon's mind.\n\nSuddenly one of them uttered a cry that drew the rest to it on swift\npinions, to see attached to one of the trees a huge swarm of Simonidean\nbees.\n\n\"Will the queen do?\" the one mind-portion asked anxiously.\n\nThere was a convulsive shudder in all the minds, for the birds knew--and\nHanlon had heard--how deadly poisonous these native bees were; how they\nwere hunted down and exterminated when found. They were twice the size,\nand many, many times more vicious and deadly than Terran bees. Even now\ntwo gardeners were running toward the tree with a great metal net and\nflame-throwers.\n\nBut Hanlon was desperate. \"She will have to do,\" the aggregate mind\ndecided.\n\nInstantly, then, the part of his mind in the dying bird detached itself\nand entered the brain of the Queen Bee. There were long, disheartening\nmoments of twisting and struggling to fit into that strange, vicious\ninsect brain. He finally managed to take control, yet was not fully en\nrapport. Sight through her multi-faceted eyes was very nearly impossible\nwith the little time he could give to learning their texture.\n\nBut the close rapport between the various portions of his mind was a\ngood guide. The Queen flew swiftly towards that ventilator, her swarm\nfollowing closely at her command.\n\nInto and through the vent she flew, and almost before the four men\ninside were aware of the strange buzzing, she was directing her swarm\ntowards them.\n\n\"Bees!\" Panek yelled in terror, and the four started fighting the\nhundreds that swarmed all over each of them. That may have been their\nmistake--had Panek and the other two stood perfectly still it was a bare\npossibility they might have survived, although in Hanlon's grimly\ndetermined frame of mind that was now doubtful.\n\nNot that Hanlon was angry, even at Panek for the terrible beating of his\nunconscious body. For he realized it was the man's cruel, sadistic\nnature; that he could not have acted otherwise.\n\nBut Hanlon knew now that the peace of the Federation demanded that he\nlive and be free to make his report, and only the death of His Highness\nand the others could now possibly save him.\n\nSo, much as it sickened him, Hanlon had to keep on, and as those\nbee-stings plunged in their hundreds into the four, the poison working\nfar more swiftly than does the venom of Terrestrial bees--more akin to\nthat of the mamba--one after another of the four fell to the floor and\nwere quiet--stung to death.\n\nHanlon then sent the Queen and her swarm back outside, after first\nimpressing on her mind that she must fly far away if she was to survive.\nHe could not send her to her death by the gardeners after she had saved\nhis life.\n\nAs she flew away he recalled his mind back from her and the nineteen\nbirds, into his body. He sat erect once more--but instantly such a tide\nof pain washed over him that he nearly fainted. For all the agony of\nthat terrible beating hit him at once.\n\nHis mind, too, was sluggish and slow once it was back in his own brain\nwhere that drug had taken effect. But he felt a sense of satisfaction\nand gratitude that he had come safely thus far through that terrible\nordeal. The drug would wear off, the wounds would heal, and the pain\nwould disappear in time. Meanwhile, he was alive ... impossible as it\nseemed, he was _alive_!\n\nBut George Hanlon had enough mind-power functioning in spite of the\ntruth-drug, to realize he was not yet out of the pit. His body was still\nmanacled to the chair, that in turn was fastened to the floor so he\ncould not move it.\n\nHe was still inside the palace of the conspirators, and it would\nundoubtedly not be too long before someone would enter the room seeking\nHis Highness, and would find him and the dead men.\n\nFor desperate minutes Hanlon considered every angle of the matter, and\nfound only one possibility that might offer some chance of release and\nsafety.\n\nOnce more he sent a portion of his mind out through the ventilator and\nfound one of the pigeon-like birds still nearby. Again he took\npossession and crowded into its tiny brain all of his mind it would\nhold. Then the bird was swiftly winging its way up and over the roofs of\nthe palace, into the dusky sky.\n\nHigh in the air it floated on out-spread pinions while he surveyed the\ncity beneath him, hunting for landmarks. He quite easily located the\ndowntown section because its lights were being turned on now that\nevening was here.\n\nThat oriented him, but the fact that it was so late brought dismay.\nWould the Corps officers have gone home? And if so, how could he locate\nany of them, tonight, with whom he could possibly communicate? He had\nnot thought of that before--he had been thinking of himself as a man,\nnot as a bird.\n\nBut even as these baffling thoughts and questions were plaguing him, he\nwas flying as swiftly as the bird's wings would carry him, directly\ntowards the great building that housed the Corps' contingent here on\nSimonides.\n\nActually, it was only minutes until the bird was outside the great\nstructure, and rapidly looking into windows. Lights were blazing in\nalmost every room, and Hanlon's mind knew thankfulness that so many of\nthe high officers were still at work.\n\nWindow after window the bird peered through in furious haste, searching\nfor an admiral's office. If it could get inside, Hanlon had thought of\nseveral ways in which it might communicate ... providing the admiral was\nnot an orthodox brass hat.\n\nBut, he told himself to maintain courage, any man who could gain as high\na position as any of the various types of admirals would have had to\nshow his resourcefulness time and again. You just didn't get that high\nin the Corps otherwise.\n\nLuck and persistence achieved his ends, for he finally located the\noffices of the Planetary Admiral, himself, and that officer and his\nsecretary were still inside at work.\n\nHanlon made the bird land on the window sill, and then begin tapping\nwith its beak on the glass. Time and again it did this, until the two\ninside, attracted by the sound, looked about for its source.\n\n\"Look, Admiral Hawarden, it's a pigeon, tapping on the window,\" the\nsecretary laughed.\n\n\"Must think there's something to eat in here,\" the officer grinned back.\n\n\"It really acts as though it was trying to attract our attention,\" the\ngirl commented a few seconds later.\n\n\"Hmmm, I wonder,\" the admiral spoke half aloud, then as the bird kept up\nits purposeful tapping he recognized the Inter-Stellar code S O S.\nQuickly he rose, went to the window, opened it, and stepped back.\n\nThe bird, showing no fear of the humans, entered and flew to his desk.\nThe secretary had also risen, and now shrank back against the wall, her\nhand at her mouth stifling a scream.\n\n\"It's magic,\" she said in fright. \"No bird ever acted like that.\"\n\n\"It certainly is unusual,\" he said, and his eyes were puzzled. \"I can't\nmake it out.\"\n\nThe bird flew toward the officer, and with fluttering wings poised in\nthe air before him, its beady, bright eyes peering directly into his.\nThen it flew toward the door. When the admiral made no move to follow,\nthe bird repeated the performance.\n\n\"It seems almost as though it wanted me to go somewhere with it,\" the\nofficer said in a dazed manner. \"Are we dreaming this, Thelma?\"\n\n\"I ... I don't know, sir. We ... we must be,\" she stammered. \"It just\ncouldn't be possible otherwise.\"\n\nBut now the bird apparently noticed something else in the room, for it\nflew over to the secretary's desk and alighted on it. It hopped up to\nher electro-writer.\n\nThat was too much. The girl rushed over, waving her hands. \"Shoo!\" she\nscolded. \"Get off my desk, you crazy creature!\"\n\nBut Admiral Hawarden was no fool. This was far beyond any experience he\nhad ever had, but there was such a purposefulness in the bird's actions,\nstrange and unusual though they were, that he felt this little drama\nshould be played out without interruption.\n\n\"Leave it alone!\" he commanded sharply in a tone that startled her, so\ndifferent was it from his usual polite manner.\n\nLooking at him in astonishment, she stepped back, and watched with him\nthis unprecedented action.\n\nWith its foot Hanlon made the bird throw the little switch that\nactivated the writing mechanism, and then with its beak began pecking at\nthe keys. Luckily there was paper in the machine, a letter she had not\nfinished. The admiral stepped up to where he could see, but waved the\ngirl back when she started to follow. It seemed impossible that the bird\ncould write anything sensible ... but the admiral was beginning to be\nnot too sure of that.\n\nHis eyes opened wide with surprise as he saw the letters appear one by\none on the paper:\n\na n d r m a 7\n\nNo longer did he doubt. How it was possible, the future might tell. But\nhe did know the significance and the urgency of that message. He ripped\nthe paper from the machine and pocketed it, then jumped to his desk and\nflipped the intercom switch.\n\n\"Captain Jessup! A company of marines, in full armor and all weapons, at\nthe main gate in trucks in two minutes. _Hipe!_\"\n\nHe ran to a cabinet in one corner of the room and threw open the door.\n\"Come and help me!\" he commanded the astonished girl, dragging his own\nlong-unused space armor out and starting to climb into it. With her help\nhe was completely encased in the minute, and was strapping on his\nweapons. \"You can go home now,\" he told her.\n\nHe turned to the desk where the bird was watching with its beady eyes,\nand held out his arm curved at the elbow. With a quick swish of wings\nthe pigeon launched itself toward the suited figure and rested on the\nout-stretched wrist.\n\nThe admiral plunged through the door and into the hall, where his\nprivate elevator waited. \"Ground!\" he yelled, and the bird was lifted\nfrom his wrist by the sudden plunging descent, but fluttered back and\nrode that wrist as the admiral dashed out of the elevator, through the\nhalls and out the front door to the waiting, marine-filled trucks.\nWilling hands hauled him aboard the lead truck, and he threw the pigeon\ninto the air.\n\n\"Follow that bird!\" he commanded, and the incredulous driver did so,\nwondering secretly if the Old Man had suddenly gone bats.\n\nWhen he saw beyond doubt the bird's destination, Admiral Hawarden\ngasped, but he was too old a campaigner to be stopped now. There was\nsomething here that needed himself and his men, and he would go through\nwith it, no matter where it led.\n\nHe knew the calibre of the men of the Secret Service, and while he could\nnot know how it was possible for one of them to train a bird in such a\nmanner, he knew his job was to back up whatever that high-powered\nindividual was doing.\n\nAs the trucks skidded to a halt at the entrance of the Prime Minister's\nornate palace, he issued swift commands. His men, disregarding the\nindignant cries of the palace guards, who swarmed out to stop this\nunbelievable invasion of their rights, deployed to their designated\npositions, weapons at the ready.\n\nTo the officer of the guard who tried to bar his way, the admiral\nsnapped, \"I'll apologize later. Now get out of my way!\" Then, with a\nsquad of husky marines at his heels, he followed the fluttering pigeon\nthrough the opened door, along a hall, and down some stairs.\n\nBut here the bird seemed at a loss, fluttering from door to door,\nseeking that certain room.\n\nAs Hanlon had so shrewdly guessed, Admiral Hawarden was no fool, but\nquick on the up-take. \"Open all these doors!\" his voice rang out\ncommandingly.\n\nAs fast as doors were opened--whether locked or not made no difference\nto the marines--the pigeon darted forward and glanced into each one\nbefore flying on the next. Then it disappeared through one of the\ndoorways, and the admiral, who had kept as close to it as possible,\nyelled \"Here!\" and ran into the room, his men streaming after him.\n\n\"Welcome to out cozy nest, Mister,\" a voice from the depths of a big\nchair called, and the officer ran forward to where he could see. \"You\ncertainly made time, and am I happy to see you soldiers. Get me out of\nthese things,\" and Hanlon rattled his chains.\n\nAt the admiral's gesture the marines made short work of the manacles,\nand Hanlon stood up, tottered a moment and would have fallen but for the\nquickly extended friendly arm of the admiral. He was still groggy, even\nthough the serum was wearing off. But he was almost in complete control\nof his mind.\n\n\"We got here in time, then?\" anxiously.\n\n\"Yes, thanks to my little friend here.\" Hanlon took the bird, and handed\nit to one of the marines, meanwhile impressing on its mind that it was\nsafe among friends. \"Look after her.\" And withdrew his mind.\n\n\"She gets good care the rest of her life,\" the admiral ordered the\nwondering marines. \"Wait outside.\"\n\nHawarden looked about the room. \"Who are these men ... and what in\nSnyder's name happened to them?\"\n\n\"They were stung to death by bees,\" Hanlon said, and there was a trace\nof vindictiveness in his voice. \"One of 'em's the Prime Minister; the\nothers his gunmen.\"\n\n\"Great John!\" the admiral breathed. \"This'll raise a stink!\"\n\n\"There'll be a bigger one before I get through,\" Hanlon was grim. \"Get\nme back to your office, and get a doctor. They gave me truth serum, and\nit hasn't all worn off yet. And I'm hungry,\" he added so plaintively\nthat Hawarden, accustomed enough to sight of death so it didn't affect\nhim too much, laughed.\n\n\"What'll we do with the bodies?\"\n\n\"Guard the Prime Minister's closely. Merely notify the people here where\nto find the others.\"\n\nHawarden called back two of the marines. \"Bring that body with us,\" and\nthey left.\n\nAt the entrance the admiral recalled his men. To the palace officer he\npartially explained. \"The Prime Minister was killed, and we're taking\nhis body with us. There are three of his men, also dead, in Room 37-B\ndown there. I'll notify the Emperor, and assume full responsibility.\"\n\nHe jumped into the truck's front seat beside Hanlon and the driver.\n\n\"Back to base!\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter 21\n\n\nThe doctor, notified by the truck's short-wave, was waiting in the\nadmiral's office to give Hanlon the shots of antidote and attend to his\nwounds. He had barely finished when a waiter brought food.\n\nThese two gone, Hawarden felt free to demand of Hanlon, \"Open up,\nplease. What's this all about?\"\n\n\"Full coverage?\" Hanlon asked meaningly.\n\nThe admiral flipped a couple of toggle switches on his desk. \"There is\nnow.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you the story in a bit, but there are several more things to\nbe done, fast.\"\n\nHe described the location of the hidden spacefield. \"Get some scouts out\nthere quick, but if the freighter's not ready to leave, have 'em keep\nhidden and merely watch it. I don't want anything done until just before\ntake-off--it's important we arrest _all_ of its crew and passengers.\"\n\n\"Right!\" Admiral Hawarden turned to his communicators, and orders rapped\nout.\n\n\"You'll have to tell me procedure here, sir, for I don't know how to get\nwhat I need. I want to recommend that the entire Corps fleet rendezvous\nnear here immediately so we can go to a planet called Algon, and take it\nover. But first we'll have to find out exactly where in space Algon is.\nMay I talk with your planetographers, please?\"\n\nThe admiral looked at him quizzically. \"You haven't been in the SS very\nlong, have you, Hanlon?\"\n\n\"No,\" the young man looked up in surprise. \"This is my first assignment.\nWhy do you ask?\"\n\n\"Because in emergencies such as this you give orders, not ask for\npermission. Every resource of the entire Corps is yours to command when\nyou feel it necessary.\"\n\n\"Why ... why, I didn't realize that,\" Hanlon shrank back in\nastonishment. \"You ... you mean they'd let a pup like me issue commands\nto the whole Corps?\"\n\n\"They certainly would, sir. I don't know if you realize it yet or not,\nbut no one gets into the Secret Service unless the High Command is\npretty sure they are exceedingly high-powered individuals. So whatever\nyou want, just yell. I am entirely at your service.\"\n\nThere was a moment of incredulity in the young man's eyes, then he\nstraightened, and that depth of character which the men in command had\nforeseen came to the surface, and he issued crisp orders. \"Very well,\nsir, I'll take you at your word. Please connect me with the\nplanetographers, then get me the High Admiral.\"\n\nHawarden activated the intercom, and when a face appeared on the screen\nordered, \"Give this young man any information he wants.\"\n\n\"Do you know a planet named 'Algon' or 'Guddu'?\" Hanlon asked. \"It's\nabout twelve and a quarter light years distant, right ascension about\neighteen hours, declination around plus fifteen degrees. Here's a rough\nchart of what I could see from there.\" He held up to his screen a sheet\non which he had been busily, marking such super-giant suns and nebulae\nas he remembered. \"... You don't know it? Then find it immediately. Rush\nit through. I must have its closest approximation inside of two hours!\"\n\nHe closed that switch and looked up as Admiral Hawarden handed him a\nmicrophone. \"Grand Fleet High Admiral Ferguson is awaiting your orders,\nsir.\"\n\nGeorge Hanlon's young hand was shaking as he took the mike, but his\nvoice was steady and crisp. \"Admiral Ferguson, sir, this is George\nHanlon of the Secret Service. I was detailed to the Simonidean affair.\nI've just returned from a planet I know both as 'Algon' and as 'Guddu.'\nThe planetographers are checking now for its exact location.\n\n\"The enemy--and I don't yet know entirely who they are, although the\nPrime Minister of Simonides was one of the top men, if not the actual\nhead--are building a great fleet there. They already have at least\nthirty-two capital ships in building, and each one of them is about\ntwice the size of our largest battleship. Yes, that's right--twice the\nsize. However, as near as I could find out, none of them are yet far\nenough completed to fly, and perhaps not even to fight. They also have\nnearly a hundred medium and light cruisers, and over two hundred smaller\nships--scouts, destroyers and so on. Many of those latter two\nclassifications are fully completed and at least partially manned.\n\n\"That fleet must be captured or destroyed before they can get it\nfinished. I know you realize that better than I, sir, but it must be\ntaken care of immediately.... Oh, no, sir, you can't just blast the\nplanet. There are natives there that are high enough in the cultural\nscale so the planet cannot be colonized, but they must be freed from the\nslavery under which they are now held. They are fine, friendly\npeople.... You'll rendezvous the fleet immediately? That's fine, sir.\nOh, one more thing, please notify SSM Regional Admiral Newton to send\nall available SS men here at once. There's a lot of cleaning up to do\nhere on Simonides.... Thank you, sir, I hope I was in time with this\ninformation.\"\n\nHanlon broke the connection, then sank back into his chair for minutes,\nthinking seriously, and the admiral respected his silence. But after a\ntime the smell of that delicious food made Hanlon's hunger and weakness\nreassert itself. Feeling he had done all he could at the moment, he sat\nup again, pulled his chair closer to the desk, and lifted the napkin\nfrom the tray.\n\n\"I'll talk while I eat, if you'll pardon the discourtesy, sir,\" he\nbegan, picking up knife and fork. And as he ate he gave Hawarden as full\nan account of the situation as he could, except for references to his\nmental abilities and the part they had played.\n\nThe admiral listened attentively, and when Hanlon paused at what seemed\nthe end of his narrative, the officer straightened with determination.\n\n\"Then the thing to do now is to find out who all is in back of this.\nThat's why you asked for all available SS men, I understand that. But\nabout His Highness--was he top man?\"\n\nHanlon knit his forehead in concentration. \"I ... don't ... know,\" he\nsaid slowly. \"No one ever spoke of anyone as his superior. He's the man\nthey were all afraid of....\" He paused a moment, then said, even more\nslowly, \"I've a peculiar hunch. I wish you'd have your best physicians\nexamine that body. Have 'em use X-rays and fluoroscopes, rather than an\nautopsy. I'm not entirely convinced he was a human being.\"\n\n\"What?\" There was incredulity in that question. \"What gives you that\nidea?\"\n\n\"Sorry, sir, I can't give you my reasons just now,\" Hanlon's face\nflushed, and his eyes were appealing. \"It isn't that I don't trust you,\nsir, but there's one secret I feel shouldn't be told now. Maybe\nlater--and if I do tell it to anyone outside of SS men, you will be the\nfirst--you deserve that.\"\n\n\"Right, sir. I didn't mean to prowl,\" the admiral showed no resentment,\nmuch to Hanlon's relief. \"Your orders go, as I said.\"\n\nHe touched a stud on his desk and when the doctor's face appeared on the\nscreen, gave the necessary orders. \"Look carefully to see if the\ninternal arrangement of bones and organs is human--but do not cut\nwithout specific orders.\"\n\n\"What about the emperor, sir?\" Hanlon asked. \"You've undoubtedly formed\nsome sort of opinion about him.\"\n\n\"He was a wonderful soldier and executive as a young and as a\nmiddle-aged man,\" Hawarden said thoughtfully and, Hanlon sensed, sadly.\n\"It was his grandfather who pulled the original coup that made this\nplanet into an empire with himself as first emperor. His son, the second\nemperor, was also a very good co-ordinator, and solidified the empire\nstatus. The present emperor went into the army at sixteen, and rose\nrapidly through sheer merit rather than because his father was emperor.\nAll historians agree on that. Just before he reached thirty he was in\nfull command. He was thirty-six when his father died, and he became the\nthird emperor.\"\n\n\"Then you think he may be back of this whatever-it-is?\"\n\n\"No,\" the admiral shook his head. \"Somehow I can't quite feel that way.\nDuring his first years as emperor he was one of the most co-operative of\nall Planetary rulers within the Federation.\"\n\n\"What about his Prime Minister ... and by the way, what was his name? I\nnever heard him called anything but 'His Highness'?\"\n\n\"His name was Gorth Bohr. He seems to have appeared from nowhere almost\novernight--as an important personage, I mean. We've traced him back, and\nhe came to Simonides about fourteen years ago, from Sirius Three. He's\nbeen Prime Minister for about ten years and it has been noticeable that\nhe has gained more and more power during the past few years, as the\nemperor has been failing both physically and mentally.\"\n\n\"I wonder ...\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"D'you suppose that failing health and mind could have been caused,\ninstead of natural?\"\n\nThe admiral was plainly taken aback. \"What? Caused?\"\n\nHanlon nodded. \"Just that. From what little I know of His Highness he\nwas just the kind to do a thing like that--and capable of it, too.\" He\nsank back in deep thought for some time, as did Hawarden. They were\ninterrupted by a buzzer from the desk. The admiral sat up quickly and\nswitched on the intercom. \"Yes?\"\n\n\"Bohr certainly was not a human being,\" the doctor reported, and Hanlon\ncould see the surprise and wonder on his face in the screen. \"There are\nstructural differences so far removed from ours that they could not\npossibly be Homo Sapiens.\"\n\n\"Any idea where he came from?\" Hanlon asked, and the admiral relayed the\nquestion.\n\n\"Never saw anything like it before, and I've just made a quick search\nthrough all my books here that contain pictures and diagrams of the\nraces of which we know.\"\n\nHanlon shook his head in resignation and Hawarden, after thanking the\ndoctor and giving orders for the disposition of the Prime Minister's\nbody, disconnected.\n\n\"Is it too late to get an audience with the emperor?\" Hanlon sat erect.\n\nThe admiral glanced at his wrist chronom. \"Pretty late, but I'll see.\"\n\nHe had just reached for a switch when his call buzzer sounded, and when\nhe activated the screen the planetographer reported, \"We can't find any\nsuch system on our charts.\"\n\nHanlon's spirit sank. \"Keep looking!\" he ordered. \"Check with the\nastronomers. It's somewhere around there--I just came from that planet.\nThe sun is hot--looks like Sol from inside Venus's orbit, although I\ndon't think it's as large as Sol.\"\n\nHawarden then put through his call to the imperial palace, his position\nas local head of the I-S C getting him fast service. After some haggling\nwith the emperor's secretary, and his insistence that it was a matter of\nthe utmost importance that could not wait until morning, he was finally\ntold His Majesty would see him.\n\n\"Got it,\" Hawarden rose. \"Come along.\"\n\nHanlon started toward the door, then looked down at his torn and dirty\nclothing. \"I'm not very presentable.\"\n\n\"We can get you a uniform from the barracks.\"\n\nHanlon thought swiftly. \"No, I'd better not chance it, although I'd sure\nlike to.\"\n\nThe admiral thought a moment, then stepped back to his desk and pressed\na stud. \"Roberts, come in here.\"\n\nA young man almost exactly Hanlon's size, wearing civilian clothes, came\ninto the office. Hawarden grinned. \"Those do?\"\n\nThe SS man smiled back. \"Swell.\"\n\n\"Strip,\" the admiral commanded the astonished clerk. \"We need your\nclothes in a hurry for this man. Quick,\" as the young man hesitated.\n\nHanlon was already removing his own. \"I'll give you a hundred credits\nfor them, Roberts, but this is prime urgent.\"\n\nThe other laughed then, and started pulling off his suit as fast as he\ncould. \"A hundred'll more than buy me a new one--it's a good bargain.\"\n\nThe exchange was quickly made. Hanlon gave the clerk his money, then he\nand the admiral hurried to the palace, where they were ushered without\ndelay toward the emperor's private study.\n\n\"Watch me fairly closely,\" Hanlon whispered as they were walking down\nthe hall. \"If I shake my head, he's lying.\"\n\nAdmiral Hawarden's eyes widened, and though he said nothing, he was\nthinking, \"This is certainly the most amazing young man I've ever met.\nWhere does the SS get 'em?\"\n\nThey had barely entered the study when a door on the far side of the\nroom opened, and the emperor came in, leaning on the arm of an aide. He\nsat down heavily behind the ornate desk.\n\n\"Well well well,\" he barked pettishly. \"What's all this about, sir?\nWhat's so important you have to get me out of bed?\"\n\n\"I am most sorry to have put Your Majesty to such inconvenience,\"\nAdmiral Hawarden said diplomatically, \"but you will soon see that this\nis, indeed, most urgent. It is also very secret, and I respectfully\nrequest we be permitted to speak with you alone.\"\n\nThe emperor waved his hand impatiently, and the aide retired from the\nroom.\n\nAdmiral Hawarden set a small box on the desk and turned on a switch.\n\"Just a portable spyray block,\" he apologized.\n\n\"I know, I know,\" came the exasperated voice. \"Get on with it, man, I'm\ntired.\"\n\n\"Permit me to introduce George Hanlon, of the Corps. We have, first, a\nbit of sad news to give Your Majesty, and then some questions we most\nurgently request you to answer as fully as you can.\"\n\nThe emperor did not look pleased at this suggestion that he be\nquestioned, but said nothing.\n\n\"Your Prime Minister, Gorth Bohr, was killed a few hours ago, Sire.\"\n\n\"What?\" The emperor sat upright, his face showing the utmost\nincredulity, but Hanlon's mind-probing had prepared him for the\nreaction, so he was not surprised to note neither dismay nor regret.\n\nFor the monarch suddenly sank back into his chair, and a long, loud\nsuspiration of relief came from him. He closed his eyes and his face\nfinally relaxed a bit. Suddenly he sat bolt upright. \"Are you sure?\" he\nbarked.\n\n\"Positive,\" the admiral assured him. \"The body is at Base, and has been\nfor several hours.\"\n\n\"How did he die?\"\n\n\"He was stung to death by bees, Sire,\" Hanlon answered.\n\n\"Bees?\" incredulously.\n\n\"That's right, Sire. He and three of his men were attacked by a swarm of\nbees in one of the basement rooms of his palace, and died within\nminutes.\"\n\nThe emperor was silent for moments, mind roiling. Then he shook his head\nas though almost not daring to believe this news.\n\n\"It may sound strange, Hawarden,\" he said at last, \"but I do not think I\nwas ever as glad of anything in my life as I am of this. He was an evil\nthing, though I did not even begin to suspect it until years after I\nappointed him my Minister. By the time I felt sure, it was too late. He\nhad ... gotten some sort of a hold over me ... I no longer seemed to\nhave a mind or will of my own any more.\"\n\nThe admiral risked a glance at Hanlon, who nodded agreement.\n\n\"Do you know what he was planning, Your Majesty?\"\n\n\"Planning? Planning? You mean something else beyond ruling Simonides\nthrough me, or possibly supplanting me entirely?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid he was, Sire. Did you know he was secretly building a great\nwar fleet on another planet?\"\n\nThere was an almost-imperceptible pause before the answer was barked\nout. \"Nonsense, sir. That I can't believe!\"\n\nHanlon shook his head. The emperor was lying now. Why? Was he\npart--perhaps head--of the plot?\n\nHis mind-probing had not yet reached an answer to those important\nquestions. They would have to question him skillfully to make him think\nof the things Hanlon so desperately needed to know.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 22\n\n\n\"They certainly are building a great fleet Sire, on a planet they call\n'Algon',\" Hanlon stated crisply, and almost gave a yell of glee as, the\nemperor's mind fleetingly called up a picture--distorted as though it\nhad only been described to him--of one of the Greenies. He hurriedly\ncontinued punching. \"I know His Highness was the guiding mind behind\nthat, for I was supposed to be working for him, and I've just come back\nfrom four months there.\"\n\nThe emperor started to deny it, but Admiral Hawarden stepped closer to\nthe desk and fixed the monarch with a stern eye.\n\n\"We don't wish to be discourteous or insolent, Sire, but we know that\nyou do know something about this. Wait, please,\" he held up his hand as\nthe emperor opened his mouth, so apparently about to demand an apology\nfor the _lese majeste_ of calling him a liar. \"We do not believe you\nwere doing this of your own accord, nor that you initiated the\nconspiracy. But we do feel positive you know something about it. And for\nthe peace of the Federation we must have every possible scrap of\ninformation you can give us.\"\n\nThe emperor became gradually less antagonistic, and as his face flushed\nhis eyes became pleading.\n\n\"I ... I ...\", he struggled to go on, then realizing that something was\nholding him back, changed the subject slightly. \"I hope, gentlemen, you\nwill forgive me. I don't know what has come over me these past years.\nI think you know, Hawarden, that I was always heartily in favor of\nthe Federation, and did all I could to make it a force for peace\nthroughout the System. I know only too well how inter-planetary war\nwould wreck all our economies, and I do not want that. But I seem to\nhave ... changed ... these last years ... and I didn't want to!\" It was\nalmost a sob.\n\nThe admiral, as man to man, went quickly around the desk and laid his\nhand comfortingly on the imperial shoulder. \"We all felt that, Sire. You\nwere far too great a ruler to have changed so radically. It puzzled and\nsaddened us all, but now I believe we can begin to see the reason--and\nit doesn't harm you in our estimation now that we realize you couldn't\nhelp it.\"\n\nThe emperor raised puzzled eyes. \"What do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"May I answer that, Sire?\" Hanlon stepped forward. \"We know now that\nGorth Bohr wasn't human--he was an alien from ...\"\n\n\"An ... alien?\" the emperor quavered.\n\n\"Yes, Sire, definitely. We do not yet know where he came from\noriginally, but we do know he had considerable more--or\ndifferent--mental powers in some ways, than most humans. You are under\nsome sort of a compulsion or hypnosis that prevents your speaking out.\nThe fact that your health failed and your body deteriorated so rapidly\nproves it was against your desires.\"\n\nThe emperor was startled by that, and his body shook as with a palsy. He\nrepeated his query, dully, \"An alien?\"\n\nHanlon and Hawarden nodded silently. After a moment Hanlon took a deep\nbreath and dared the question: \"May we have permission to search Bohr's\nquarters and offices to see what evidence we can find that will perhaps\ntell us more about his projects?\"\n\nHis Majesty straightened with decision, and years seemed to drop from\nhis face and figure. \"You certainly may, I'll give orders at once, and\nyou can send in as many of your experts as you desire. I can sense the\nneed for speed.\"\n\nHanlon bowed his thanks, and the admiral voiced his. \"That is very\ngracious, Sire. The Corps thanks you.\"\n\nThe emperor was gaining strength and his old shrewdness by the moment.\n\"What about that fleet you say is being built on ... on some other\nplanet?\"\n\nHanlon noticed that hesitation and guessed the reason. But for the\nmoment he let it lie, and answered the question. \"It is not yet a\nserious menace, Sire, but will be shortly if not taken into the Corps'\nhands.\"\n\nAdmiral Hawarden explained further that the grand fleet was being\nassembled, and would cope with the problem within days.\n\n\"Good. Good. Call on us for whatever assistance we can give.\"\n\nThey talked over many details for some time, then the admiral rose as\nthough to take his leave.\n\nBut Hanlon wasn't yet ready. He wanted to pick up that matter he had let\nlie some minutes ago. He stepped up to the desk and looked straight into\nthe imperial eyes.\n\n\"Sire, please think hard with all your will. I believe you know more\nabout Bohr's plans, but that the knowledge was hypnotically sealed in\nyour sub-conscious. Bohr had that power, we know. Please try to break\nthat seal. Bohr is dead now--his _compulsion_ can no longer bind you!\"\n\nThe emperor seemed doubtful, but at Hanlon's continued, assured\ninsistence, finally agreed to try. He concentrated for long, long,\nagonizing minutes. Great beads of sweat stood out on his white, strained\nface, and his hands clenched into tight balls.\n\nHanlon almost repented, and thought of breaking the spell and telling\nthe suffering ruler it didn't matter that much, that they could get the\nknowledge elsewhere. But he _had_ to have those facts--and if he could\nsuffer as he had done, so could others.\n\nBut just then the emperor suddenly relaxed. His features became more\ncomposed and natural, and he smiled in relief.\n\n\"It is coming now,\" he wiped his face with his silk kerchief. \"Bohr did\nboast to me that he would one day rule the galaxy. But then he told me I\nmust forget what he said, and I did.\"\n\nThat speech seemed to release him still further from the awful tension\nthat had held him for so many years. He was weary but happy. \"He didn't\ntell me much in detail, as nearly as I can remember. Merely that plans\nwere being made to gain control first of this planet, then the\nFederation, and after that the whole Galaxy.\"\n\n\"Did he say who was with him in this outrageous undertaking?\" Hawarden\ngasped, and Hanlon added, \"We mean, was he alone in it, or was some\nother planet or system backing him?\"\n\nThe emperor thought steadily for some time, then shook his head. \"I\ndon't seem to remember,\" he sighed sadly. Nor could he, after half an\nhour's more concentration. \"I am sorry I cannot give you that\ninformation, gentlemen. But you will soon, we trust, have reason to\nbelieve that we are once more desirous of doing everything possible for\nthe peace and well-being of the Federation.\"\n\nThere were tears in Admiral Hawarden's eyes and he impulsively stepped\nforward and grasped the emperor's hand.\n\n\"Welcome back, Sire,\" he said sincerely.\n\nBack at Base, there were messages awaiting, that had come in while they\nwere gone. The admiral handed one of them to Hanlon. It was terse, but\nbrought a happy smile to his face.\n\n_\"Coming immediately, with full crew. Congratulations. NEWTON.\"_\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOthers were from Grand Fleet, regarding the measures being taken for the\nfleet rendezvous, and the part the Simonidean sector was to play.\nAnother was from the planetographers, giving the spatial location of\nAlgon, with the note that they had finally found it on a star map, and\nthat a survey ship was being sent there at once.\n\nHanlon punched a stud. \"Stay away from Algon,\" he rapped out when the\nscientist's face appeared on the screen. \"Don't send that ship until you\nget permission. Just forget all about even having heard of Algon!\"\n\nThe elder looked questioningly at the youthful civilian giving him such\norders. \"I don't know ...\"\n\n\"Hawarden speaking,\" the admiral pushed Hanlon aside and glared into the\nscreen. \"That's an order! Forget it, as you were told!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. It's forgotten.\"\n\nHanlon turned wearily to the admiral. \"I'm minus on sleep and strength\nright now, sir. Think I'll go get some rest. In the morning I'll come\nback and we'll start searching Bohr's stuff.\"\n\n\"Right, I could use some caulking-off myself. A couple more orders, then\nI'm going home. Do you want to bunk here at Base?\"\n\n\"No, guess I'd better go back to the hotel. I can't appear here too\nmuch, you know--might be recognized by some Terran officer. And that\nbrings up a problem. What will be my apparent status before the crews\ndoing the searching?\"\n\n\"Civilian specialist, called in by the Corps,\" Hawarden was used to\nquick decisions. \"We often use such. I'll sign a pass for you. Better\nuse a disguise and different name, hadn't you?\"\n\nHanlon nodded. \"False mustache, skin darkened, contact lenses to color\nmy eyes. And I'll call myself Spencer Newton.\"\n\nHawarden looked surprised. \"You pick a name fast.\"\n\nThe SS man grinned back. \"It's the one I was born with,\"--and then the\nadmiral really was surprised, but asked no questions. He filled in the\npass with that name. \"Better come directly into this private office.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen they met in the morning Hawarden complimented Hanlon on his\ndisguise, then quickly reported he had already assembled crews and one\nwas working at the imperial palace and the other at the ex-Prime\nMinister's own residence.\n\n\"Good,\" Hanlon was well-rested and his voice was crisp. \"I think I'll\nstart at Bohr's place.\"\n\nThe two officers left Base, a staff car rushing them to the ministerial\nresidence. They entered and Hawarden led the way down a hall towards\nBohr's private office.\n\nBut just as they reached the door and were turning to go in, Hanlon\nsuddenly pushed the admiral past it, then jumped across the opening\nhimself. Hawarden turned in puzzlement, but Hanlon signalled quiet and\nled him into a small reception room adjoining.\n\n\"There's one man in there you'll have to get rid of before I can go in,\"\nhe explained in a swift whisper. \"Young junior lieutenant named Dick\nTrowbridge. He'd recognize me even in this disguise. How'd he ever get\nhere to Sime?\"\n\n\"Trowbridge? Oh, yes, he was sent here from Terra when we asked Prime\nfor a code-expert.\"\n\n\"Umm, that's right, Dick was a code-specialist,\" Hanlon nodded. \"He was\nmy roommate all through cadet school,\" he explained. \"It would give the\nwhole works away if he saw me here.\"\n\n\"He's our only good decoder,\" Admiral Hawarden frowned. \"We lost our\nbest man. We'll have to use him if any code shows up.\"\n\n\"I realize that, but send him away for now. If we get code we can send\nit to him at Base.\"\n\n\"Right, sir, I'll fake an excuse.\"\n\nSome five minutes later Hawarden returned. \"All clear now, sir.\"\n\nThey started out, then Hanlon stopped the admiral with a hand on his\narm. \"Please, sir,\" his face was flaming, his eyes miserable, but his\nvoice was fairly steady. \"Please don't call me 'Sir' all the time. It\nmay be that my position as an SS man carries that distinction, but it\nmakes me nervous. A youngster like me has no business being called 'Sir'\nby a top brass like you who has worked nearly half a century to achieve\nthe honor.\"\n\nAdmiral Hawarden grinned suddenly, and hugged Hanlon with a fatherly\ngesture. \"You're all right, Son, and I'm for you. From now on you're\nsimply 'Newton'. Anything to make you ... hey, 'Newton'? Are you...?\"\n\nHanlon nodded. \"His son.\"\n\nThe admiral's eyes glowed. \"Wonderful man, your dad. One of the Corps'\ngreatest.\"\n\nThe young man swallowed hard. \"I think so, too.\"\n\nThey had been working nearly a quarter of an hour, sorting through the\nvoluminous papers in the minister's desk and files, when another Corps\nlieutenant came in, his hand bandaged.\n\n\"What happened to you, Patrick?\" Hawarden asked in surprise.\n\n\"That blasted toogan bit me, and I had to get my hand dressed.\"\n\n\"What toogan?\"\n\n\"One that must have been Bohr's pet. It was flying all about the room\nyelling and cussing us out. I was crossing to the corner of the room,\nthere, when it screamed and bulleted over, slashing my hand when I threw\nit up to protect my face.\"\n\nAnother of the men spoke up. \"Took three of us to capture it, and I\nwanted to wring its neck, but Captain Banister wouldn't let me, so we\nstuffed it into its cage and sent it to the Zoo.\"\n\nHanlon was intensely interested in this, but one thing puzzled him. He\nsignalled Hawarden to one side, and asked in a whisper, \"What's a\ntoogan?\"\n\n\"A native bird here much like your Terran parrots, but with even more\nbeautiful plumage, and they can talk much better than parrots. They seem\nto have quite a lot of intelligence.\"\n\nHanlon was instantly alert. \"Get it back here for me.\"\n\nPuzzled but unquestioning, the admiral went to the visiphone and dialed\nthe zoo. \"Admiral Hawarden, Curator. I believe the Prime Minister's\ntoogan was just delivered to you. There was a mistake. Please send it\nback ... never mind, sir, what the 'why' is, just return it\nimmediately.\"\n\nHe flipped off the switch impatiently, and looked at the young Secret\nServiceman with wondering eyes. A toogan? What on earth did the fellow\nwant with ... this was the most amazing man he'd ever seen. But he sure\ndid get results.\n\nHe turned back to his men. \"Anything yet?\"\n\n\"Nothing but ordinary state papers so far, sir,\" was the consensus.\n\n\"Keep looking. Remember, we especially want any mention of any planets\nwhose names you do not recognize; anything about ship-building, or about\nmining or other planets.\"\n\nHanlon handed Hawarden a note, and the admiral sent a couple of marines\noff on a run. Half an hour later a truck pulled up in front, and the\nmarines carried in another desk. It was the one from that back room in\nthe Bacchus Tavern.\n\nHanlon himself went through this, but was quickly disappointed. There\nwasn't a thing he wanted in any of the drawers. He turned the desk\nupside down, looking for secret compartments. Finding none, he ordered\nthe marines to take it to pieces. At a nod from the admiral they\ndismantled the desk.\n\nBut it was perfectly innocuous.\n\nHanlon was just turning away, disgustedly, when a man came from the zoo\nwith the caged toogan. At sight of the familiar room the bird perked up.\n\n\"Hey, Boss!\" it called out in a clear but whistling sort of voice, \"I'm\nhome again.\" Hanlon had no trouble understanding its words, spoken in\nSimonidean, of course, but was busy examining its mind. He walked over\nto the messenger and held out his hand. \"I'll take the bird.\"\n\nThe zoo attendant looked at him doubtfully. \"It's a vicious thing, sir,\"\nhe said. \"Be careful--it's already injured one man. They say no one but\nthe Prime Minister can handle it.\"\n\n\"It's all right,\" the admiral spoke. \"Thank you for bringing it. That\nwill be all.\"\n\nHanlon took the cage and, giving the admiral a meaning look, walked out\nof the room with it.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 23\n\n\nIn the next room George Hanlon sank into a comfortable chair, then\nopened the cage door and the toogan fluttered out and perched on the\nchair arm. The young man fitted his mind more closely to the bird's\nbrain and began probing. Carefully he studied its every line and\nchannel, utterly oblivious to everything else.\n\nHis first brief examination brought a slight sound of pleased surprise\nto his lips. This bird had a real mind, far better than any he had\npreviously discovered in any animal or bird, even better than a dog's.\nAnd he could read everything in it.\n\nBest of all, the toogan had a pictorial type of mind--it remembered in\nscenes as well as words. It transmitted an almost perfect likeness of\nthe being Hanlon had first known as The Leader and later as His Highness\nGorth Bohr--any slight discrepancies being caused by the difference\nbetween a bird's ability to see and that of humans.\n\nLike a swiftly unreeling three-dimensional film, Hanlon saw the Minister\nworking at his desk, walking about the room, receiving callers, playing\nwith the bird, eating--and sharing his food with it--talking to it\nconfidentially as he might have done to a well-trusted aide.\n\nFor over an hour Hanlon sat there, and the bird, seemingly asleep, sat\non the chair arm without making a move. Finally Hanlon rose, and the\ntoogan flew onto his outheld arm much as a falcon might ride. In that\nmanner they returned to the main office where the others were still\nworking.\n\nThey were all amazed at this peculiar situation, but only Admiral\nHawarden came even close to guessing what was going on. The memory of\nthat astounding performance of the pigeon made him think perhaps this\nsurprising young man had actually been reading the bird's mind--or\nsomething equally fantastic.\n\nHanlon set the toogan down on a corner of the big desk, then started\nwalking toward a corner closet. As he neared it the bird seemed to come\nto life. It began screaming, \"No need looking there! There's nothing in\nthere. Nobody's ever to look into that closet! Sic 'em, Pet!\"\n\nIt dove straight at Hanlon, beak open and screaming in rage. But the\nman's hand and mind were quicker. Taking possession of the bird's mind\nagain, he silenced it and grabbed it by the neck, holding it gently but\nfirmly under his arm.\n\n\"Open that closet and search it thoroughly,\" Hawarden snapped.\n\nSeveral of the Corpsmen jumped forward, and again the toogan struggled,\nbut Hanlon was holding it firmly by force, as well as tightening his\nmental control, which the powerful compulsion Bohr had implanted in the\nbird's mind had momentarily broken through.\n\nIn minutes everything was out of the closet, and while some of the\nofficers were examining every bit of the contents, others, with\npowerful, portable glo-lights, were going over the walls and shelves.\nThere was a three-foot ladder-stool in the closet, and one of them\nstarted to mount it to search the ceiling.\n\nBut the moment the man touched the stool the bird's mind gave Hanlon a\nclear picture of a procedure it had witnessed many times. He gasped, and\ncalled out to the Corpsmen, \"That stool! Never mind looking at the\ncloset itself or that other stuff. Bring the stool out here!\"\n\nThe surprised lieutenant jumped down, and carried the little ladder over\nto where Hanlon was standing with the bird.\n\n\"Unscrew the left rear leg--about the middle, I believe.\"\n\nThe officer up-ended the stool, and after a moment's work found out how\nto unscrew the leg--it had a reverse thread. In a few more instants he\nhad it off, and they all gasped.\n\nThe leg was hollow, and in it were a number of tightly-rolled sheets of\nvery thin, tough paper.\n\nThe Corpsman started to unroll the papers, but at a quick signal from\nHanlon, Admiral Hawarden stepped forward.\n\n\"I'll take those, Lieutenant. I think, for the time being, at least, we\nneed search no further. Since most of the papers we have found here are\npurely planetary matters, they're not for us to meddle with, even though\nwe have permission to do so. Back to Base--if these are not what we want\nwe can start again later.\"\n\nAs the men filed out, Hawarden activated the visiphone, and got the\nminister's office at the imperial palace. \"Find anything we want there,\nCaptain?\" he asked the man who answered.\n\n\"Not yet, sir.\"\n\n\"Report back to Base, then. I think we've got it here.\"\n\nHe disconnected and handed the papers to Hanlon who had, in the\nmeantime, returned the toogan to its cage, and now sat down. He saw the\nyoung man's face fall at first glance at those dozens of rolled sheets.\n\n\"What's wrong?\"\n\n\"It's in code,\" came the explanation reply as Hanlon swiftly examined\neach page. \"In code--or in Bohr's native language, whatever that may\nbe.\"\n\n\"Ouch! If it's that, we're sunk. Better get Trowbridge on it anyway,\nhadn't we?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" slowly, \"that's all we can do now.\" After some moments, \"Guess\nI'll keep out of sight for a while. I'll go back to the hotel. You can\nget in touch with me there. I'm still sort of shaky from that beating I\ngot, and need a lot of rest.\"\n\n\"Want the doctor to look you over again?\"\n\n\"No, I don't think I need that now. He said to have the dressings\nrenewed in two days, so I'll see him tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Right, Newton. If anything comes up, I'll get in touch.\"\n\n\"Oh, be sure and let me know about that freighter. You've had no word\nyet, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Only that it's still there, being loaded. The scouts are watching it\nclosely, ready to blast at first sign of departure.\"\n\n\"Warn them that we want _all_ of the crew and passengers.\"\n\nThe two started out, but suddenly Admiral Hawarden stopped Hanlon with\nhis hand on the young man's arm. \"About that business with the toogan.\nI'm not prying if you don't want to talk, but shouldn't I warn all the\nmen who saw it, to keep quiet?\"\n\n\"Shades of Snyder, yes! I got so interested I forgot all about others\nseeing me with it. Yes, absolutely, it must never be talked about.\"\n\nHe again looked pleadingly at the admiral. \"I ... I'm sorry, sir ... but\nat that I know you're smart enough to have figured out most of it. All\nright, highly confidential, I can do a bit of mind-reading, and\nespecially with animals and birds, whose minds are not as complex as\nhuman's. I can even control 'em to some extent.\"\n\nThe admiral nodded. \"I sort of figured as much, with the amazing\nperformance of that pigeon. Your secret is safe with me--it certainly\nmust not be spread around. But I don't mind saying I'm glad it's you has\nthat ability, not me,\" with a half-hearted laugh.\n\n\"It is a load,\" Hanlon admitted soberly, then brightened, \"but it sure\nsaved my neck when Bohr had me prisoner and was about to torture me.\"\n\nThe admiral looked surprised, then shivered. \"The bees! I hadn't\nconnected ...\", his voice died away, and after another brief hesitation\nhe left, while Hanlon slowly made his way outside, took a ground-cab,\nand was driven back to the hotel.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAbout five the next morning Hanlon was awakened by the stealthy sound of\na key in the lock of his hotel room door. His hand slid swiftly under\nhis pillow, and firmly grasped the blaster there.\n\nAs he saw the door open and a figure slip inside, in one swift movement\nhe sat up, and switched on the bed light. \"Up with those hands!\" he\ncommanded the man who was closing the door carefully, his back still\ntowards the bed.\n\nThe hands went up, and the man slowly turned.\n\n\"Dad!\" Hanlon yelled in relief, and climbed out of bed. \"How did you get\nhere so soon?\"\n\nHis father met him halfway, and said from their embrace, \"I was on\nEstrella when your call came. That's only a few lights from here, and\nthey sent a speedster.\" Then he grinned. \"I'm glad to see you're\nlearning to keep your eyes open, even in your sleep.\"\n\nHanlon started dressing while they talked. In swift, concise sentences\nhe told his father all that had occurred to him since he started his\njob.\n\n\"Nice work, Spence,\" his father applauded when he had finished, then\ngrinned again, \"although I ought to spank you for taking such risks,\nafter I told you to take it easy at first. I was a bit worried when you\ndisappeared, until Hooper reported what you were after. But about your\njob,\" he continued after a moment, \"we had no idea you could get so\nmuch. We merely hoped you might find a lead or two for us to work on.\nBut you've practically wrapped this up for us.\"\n\n\"Unh-uh,\" his son demurred. \"It's far from finished. We've got to get to\nAlgon and grab those ships. And if any of them, or enough of them, are\nin shape to fight, that may take some doing ... if we can do it at all.\nThen there's the job of finding out where Bohr came from, and how much\nof a menace his planet or system or whatever it is, will be.\"\n\n\"Sure, sure, I realize that, Son. But those are incidentals. You've\ngiven us the 'what' and 'who' we needed to know. But I see you're\ndressed, and I'm hungry. Let's go eat.\"\n\nAs they were breakfasting his father asked for details, and Hanlon\nexplained about his new mental powers, and how they had helped him. \"I\ncan't do much with men, except to read their surface thoughts,\" he\nexplained. \"But with animals I can do more. I can follow those surface\nthoughts and memories back and down into their total mind, and can take\nover and control them. But it won't work with people--humans seem to\nhave a sort of natural block or screen I can't penetrate.\"\n\nNewton's face was a study as he shook his head. \"To think my boy can do\nthings like that!\"\n\n\"How do you suppose it happens I can, Dad?\"\n\n\"You didn't get it from me, that's for sure,\" his father grimaced\nruefully. \"Perhaps through your mother, from her father. He was a\npeculiar duck. They used to call him psychic, for he'd get some of the\ncraziest hunches--for lack of a better descriptive word. He often seemed\nto know a lot of things when no one could figure out how he could have\nlearned them. Say, now that I remember back, he used to have quite a way\nwith animals, too, although I doubt if he had anything like your\npowers.\"\n\n\"You said I'd probably develop other mental abilities,\" Hanlon grinned\nnervously, \"but I certainly never imagined anything like this.\"\n\n\"Me neither,\" ungrammatically. \"It's weird!\"\n\nThey had nearly finished eating when their waiter brought a portable\nvisiphone to the table. \"A call for you, Mr. Hanlon,\" and he plugged the\nset into a wall-socket.\n\nHanlon flipped the switch and saw Admiral Hawarden's face smiling from\nthe screen. \"We got the freighter just a few minutes ago,\" he reported.\n\"One of our men daringly mingled with the crew as they were boarding,\nand jammed the airlock so it couldn't be closed. We arrested them all,\nwith only two of our men injured, and five of the enemy. They're\nbringing them into Base now.\"\n\n\"Fine work, sir. Admiral Newton is here with me--we'll see you in your\noff ... wait, sir ... Dad says you'd better come here to the hotel. Room\n946.\"\n\nThey were barely back in Hanlon's room when Admiral Hawarden knocked. He\nand Newton were old friends, and greeted each other with genuine warmth.\n\n\"That's quite a boy of yours, Newt. He's got the stuff.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I'm sort of proud of him, myself. He's really done a job,\nespecially for first assignment.\"\n\n\"Have either of you any orders for me concerning the mopping up?\"\nHawarden asked, but looked at Hanlon.\n\n\"Ask Dad ...\"\n\nBut his father interrupted. \"It's your party, Son. Speak up. Right now\nyou're not a youngster just out of school, you are the Inter-Stellar\nCorps,\" he added impressively.\n\nHanlon flushed, but there was a sureness in his voice as he answered,\nthat only the bitter experiences through which he had so recently\npassed, and which had matured him so greatly, could have brought.\n\n\"We've got to liberate Algon and capture those new battleships as\nquickly as possible, of course. But at the same time we must be trying\nto find out what planet or system Bohr came from, and take steps to see\nthey can't harm us. That means we've got to exert every effort to get\nevery single person who was working with or for Bohr, and especially to\nfind out if he had any superiors.\"\n\n\"Right. The fleet should be here in another two days, and then Ferguson\nwill want to blast for Algon. The other matter will depend on so many\nthings we don't know yet.\"\n\n\"Has Trowbridge cracked that code yet?\"\n\n\"He reported first thing this morning that he broke it late last night.\nI've assigned several men to help him, and they should have it\ntranscribed soon.\"\n\nHanlon turned to his father. \"Your men here yet?\"\n\n\"They're coming in as fast as they can get here.\"\n\n\"Better examine those men from the freighter, and have your gang follow\nup all leads. They'll have to break down Bohr's hypnosis to get any\ninformation. Although,\" he paused and his face grew thoughtful, \"I'm\nwondering if anyone besides Bohr really knew all he was planning. I'm\nbeginning to believe he was a lone wolf.\"\n\nAdmiral Hawarden nodded in agreement. \"I've been forced to the same\nbelief.\"\n\nSomething clicked in Hanlon's mind. \"The emperor,\" he exclaimed. \"Maybe\nwe'd better have another go at him. I'll bet his mind's a lot freer from\nthat compulsion now, and perhaps he can remember more of what Bohr\nsealed away from his conscious memory.\"\n\nHawarden nodded. \"That's a good bet. I'll arrange it.\"\n\nTwo hours later the emperor was free to receive them, and the four were\nsoon closeted in his study.\n\n\"It's a strange, weird feeling, gentlemen,\" he said when they had\nexplained what they wanted. \"It's almost like trying to read some other\nperson's mind. I've felt that Bohr's influence was receding, and I've\nbeen trying to see what more I could find.\"\n\nHe sat silent for a moment, then said slowly, almost in a sing-song\nvoice as though reading from a printed page, \"I knew he was building\nsome ships on Algon, but I did not know they were warships. He told me\nthey were a new type with an entirely new propulsive principle that one\nof our scientists had worked out.\"\n\n\"There's always that possibility, of course,\" Newton said.\n\n\"Why did he say they were building them elsewhere than on this planet?\"\nHawarden asked.\n\nThe emperor frowned in concentration, then a peculiar look came over his\nfeatures. \"That's strange,\" he marvelled. \"You would think I would have\nbeen sure to ask that, but I cannot find any memory of ever having done\nso.\"\n\n\"Algon had most of the natural resources for the building of ships,\"\nHanlon ruminated aloud. \"There were the mines, the forests, and slave\nlabor to cut down expenses. It was mostly engineers, scientists and\nspecial technicians who were there, overseeing.\"\n\n\"I cannot find in my mind the names of any others who might have been in\nthe conspiracy with Bohr,\" the emperor answered another question. \"He\nbrought only one man to see me, with the request that I present him a\ndecoration. It was the scientist who devised the new drive, he said. A\nProfessor Panek, I believe ...\"\n\n\"Panek?\" Hanlon interrupted. \"A heavy-set, ruddy-faced, red-headed man?\"\n\n\"Yes, that about describes him.\"\n\n\"But Panek was only one of his gunmen,\" the young SS man was perplexed.\n\"He didn't have brains enough to invent an excuse.\"\n\n\"I wonder, then, what Bohr had in mind to bring such a man here like\nthat?\" Hawarden frowned.\n\n\"Maybe a trick to help throw His Majesty off guard,\" Newton suggested.\n\n\"Or else just a sop to Panek's vanity, to tie him closer to Bohr,\"\nHanlon said. \"A thing like that would have tickled Panek.\"\n\n\"We'll have him rounded up, then.\"\n\n\"No need, Sire,\" Hanlon explained. \"He was one of those men who were\ntorturing me, and was killed by the bees.\"\n\nThe emperor looked at the young man quizzically, and a knowing smile\nerased much of the tension from his face. \"I've heard about that\nincident. Wasn't it rather peculiar you were not harmed by any of those\nferocious bees?\"\n\nHanlon's face was as bland as he could make it. \"Not necessarily, Sire.\nI was sitting still, manacled, you remember. They were moving around and\nfighting the insects.\"\n\nThe emperor winked, and Hanlon probed into his mind, receiving the\ndistinct impression of friendliness, while the surface thoughts were\nsaying, \"I won't pry, but I'd give a lot to know what really did\nhappen--and how.\"\n\n\"The Corps thanks Your Majesty,\" Admiral Hawarden rose to leave, and\nNewton and Hanlon did likewise. \"We'll keep you closely informed of\nthings as they break,\" and the three backed from the study, bowing.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 24\n\n\nGrand Fleet had been rapidly assembling in the region near Simonides,\njust outside visual range, and away from the passenger and freight\nlanes. Mobilization was now complete.\n\nAdmiral Newton and Senior Lieutenant Hanlon had been invited to ride the\nSirius, High Admiral Ferguson's flagship, and were glad to avail\nthemselves of that privilege. They wore uniforms conforming to their\nrank, but were disguised so that any chance acquaintances could not\nrecognize them, although there were no other Terrans aboard.\n\nOrders were given, and in strict formation the fleet blasted for Algon.\nFirst went the great screen of scouts, fanning out in all directions\nfrom a common center, the outer fringes at higher speed until a great\nbowl-like formation was secured. Then all the scouts standardized their\nspeed. When they reached Algon they would completely englobe the planet\njust beyond detection range.\n\nNext came the light cruisers, in the same formation, but when they\nenglobed at Algon they would go inside the globe of scouts, nearer the\nplanet's surface. Then the heavy cruisers and battleships would descend\nin three mass formations, one directly over each of the three known\nshipyards.\n\n\"If any of the ships being built there are in shape to attack--if they\nhave weapons installed and crews to use them,\" High Admiral Ferguson's\norders had been very explicit, \"you'll have to burn them down. Otherwise\nwe want those ships untouched.\"\n\nGeorge Hanlon was thrilled with the excitement of what was coming, yet\nknew a touch of fear. He had never been under fire, and knew only from\nhearsay just what it meant to be in a ship that might be destroyed any\ninstant without the least chance of anyone escaping. In space warfare,\nthere usually just were no survivors. You won and lived--or you lost and\nwere blasted out of existence.\n\nBut it wouldn't be long now--the scouts were already establishing their\nglobe just outside of detection range. \"No signs of being discovered\nyet,\" they reported.\n\nThen the light cruisers began slipping through the screen of scouts to\ntake their positions. Suddenly, a number of great beams of energy\nstabbed up toward them from below, and the screens of the cruisers\nflared in brilliant confiscations of flame as those mighty rays struck\nthem.\n\n\"Don't you cruisers and scouts take foolish chances!\" High Admiral\nFerguson's voice rasped into the mike. \"If those beams are too hot, get\nback fast! Heavy cruisers and battleships, down!\"\n\nInstantly Hanlon could feel the surge of acceleration as the great ship\nhe was riding plummeted planetward. In the plate he and his father were\nscanning, he could see the dots of blue light that identified the\nnearest scouts, and a moment later the greens of the light cruisers.\n\nThen those dots fled behind his range of vision as the heavies flashed\npast them.\n\nThe plate Hanlon was using was of limited vision, so he could not see\nthe battle as a whole, as High Admiral Ferguson could in his\nwide-coverage screens. Only what was going on directly below and close\nto either side was visible to Hanlon. Yet he could see several of those\ngreat, stabbing beams reaching out toward the fleet.\n\nA change in color at one edge of his plate caught his eye, and he saw\nthe ship nearest on his right begin to glow as a heavy beam from below\nworked on its screens, burrowing its way in and in, trying to blast the\nship out of existence.\n\nGreat streams of radiance struck and ricocheted from its screens, which\nwere swiftly mounting through the spectrum as more and more power was\nthrown against them by the enemy below.\n\nThe air in the Sirius began to grow hotter, and his father answered his\ninquiring look, \"They're attacking us, too, and that's heating us up.\nHope our screens hold,\" he grinned grimly.\n\n\"You said it.\" A shiver of fear gripped the young man, and he could feel\nhimself trembling. His father threw a comforting arm across his\nshoulders. \"First battles are always toughest,\" he said evenly, and\nHanlon calmed instantly.\n\nHe turned his attention to the screen again. That neighboring ship was\nstruggling desperately to escape, knowing she could not stand much more.\n\n\"What's the matter with that pilot?\" Hanlon yelled. \"Why don't he flip\nher over and beat it?\"\n\n\"Seems to be held by something,\" his father's anxious voice was tense.\n\"Have those others got some sort of tractor beam?\"\n\n\"Tractors?\" Hanlon looked up in surprise. \"I've read about them, but\nthought they were impossible.\"\n\n\"Impossible to us because we haven't got 'em yet,\" Newton said absently.\n\"They are theoretically possible.\"\n\nEvery beam from every Corps ship was piercing downward. Suddenly other\nships were appearing, and the young man realized that the light cruisers\nwere coming down to add their might to that of the battleships and\nheavies.\n\nFour of the light cruisers maneuvered swiftly below the battleship next\nto the Sirius, one below the other, and in the instant of their\nalignment the big ship broke free, while the others flashed away from\nthat restricting, holding tractor, or whatever it was.\n\nIt seemed like hours that Hanlon's eyes strained, trying to see what was\ngoing on. They had slowed, his spaceman's sense told him, and now he\ncould see they were within the atmosphere, not too high above the\nground. Now he could make out huge, squat mechanisms from which those\ndeadly rays were pouring.\n\nThe Guddus, with their lack of knowledge of things mechanical, had not\nreported these to Hanlon, else he could have warned Admiral Ferguson\nabout them, and the attack might possibly have been handled differently.\n\nSuddenly a speaker blared, \"Sector Two is in our hands. No total losses.\nA number of the enemy scouts got away--they're far faster than anything\nwe've got.\"\n\nA yell rose from every throat there in the control room.\n\nSector Two, Hanlon knew, was the spaceyard where the scouts and light\ncruisers were being built. \"They probably hadn't armed that field as\nmuch as these others,\" he said to his father.\n\nNewton nodded, then the two walked over to the High Admiral's station\nand glanced into his larger bank of plates.\n\nNow Hanlon could see clearly, and at first glance knew that none of the\nnew enemy ships below them were fighting--only those ground batteries\nwhich encircled the shipyard. He could see that most of these were now\nout of action, destroyed by the Federation ships. The others were under\nterrific bombardment, not only from the ships' beams, but from their\nbombs and guided missiles as well.\n\nFrom the looks of the destroyed batteries, Hanlon guessed the explosive\nbombs had been followed by thermite to complete their destruction.\n\n\"We lost many?\" Newton asked.\n\n\"No totals,\" Ferguson's voice was gleeful, \"except one light cruiser. We\nmust have caught them napping. If they can't put up any more forces,\nit'll all be over in a couple of minutes.\"\n\n_A couple of minutes!_ Hanlon's thought was a gasp. He glanced at his\nchronom, and was amazed. He had been sure this battle had lasted for\nhours--but it was less than ten minutes. It didn't seem possible ... but\nhe quickly remembered what he had learned in school, and knowing\nsomething of those terrific powers unleashed there, the wonder was now\nthat it had lasted that long.\n\nA speaker near them blared. \"Admiral Houghton reporting. Sector Three\ntaken. Two of our cruisers blasted, and one battleship crippled. One\nenemy battleship was fighting us, and had to be destroyed. They've\nreally got something, sir, that we'll want to study and get for\nourselves.\"\n\nAnother yell of triumph came from the Corpsmen, and Hanlon felt a thrill\nof pride in the Service of which he was a part.\n\nThen a moment later Admiral Ferguson called into his mike, \"Cease fire,\nbut stand by on careful watch. _Orion_ and _Athenia_, send your\nspecialists down in gigs. I'll meet you there.\"\n\nThe landing successfully completed without further activity from the\nenemy, Ferguson, a number of designated officer-specialists, Newton and\nHanlon, some technicians, and a company of marines in full armor,\ndisembarked and marched to the safest part of the ruined, still-burning\nspaceyard.\n\nCareful examination of the ships there was ordered. The\nofficer-technies, who swarmed aboard the enemy ships, soon began\nreporting one after another, that none of these partially-built vessels\nseemed damaged beyond repair.\n\n\"Thank heavens they built what few ground-batteries they had well\noutside the field,\" Ferguson said to Newton and Hanlon. \"We'll get crews\nin here at once, and complete these ships.\"\n\nGeorge Hanlon, after his first quick looks about at the damage done, had\nbeen sending his mind out and out, trying to get into telepathic\ncommunication with any of the natives, but had not had any success. Had\nthey all been killed? Those here at the shipyard, probably yes, he had\nto admit sadly. The terrific heat would have burned them. But what about\nthe others? Why couldn't he contact them?\n\n\"Excuse me, sir,\" he addressed the High Admiral. \"What about the mines\nand factories?\"\n\n\"All under control without any trouble, outside of a few individual\ncasualties. Light cruisers and scouts took care of those while the main\nbattle was on.\"\n\n\"I'd like a small cruiser to take me to the mine where I worked,\" he\nsaid, and one was ordered to come down and place itself on special\nassignment at his disposal.\n\n\"Want to come with me, Dad?\" he asked.\n\nThe two admirals exchanged glances, and Ferguson nodded. \"Go ahead if\nyou want to. We won't need you here for now.\"\n\nIn the airlock of the cruiser Hanlon removed the disguising makeup, and\nit was as his Algonian-known self, dressed in civvies he had brought for\nthat purpose, that he descended at the familiar little spaceport.\n\nHis father was intensely interested in that fantastic, seemingly-alive\njungle through which they walked to the mine clearing. \"I've never seen\nanything like this,\" he commented in amazement. \"Are these trees and\nbushes conscious, too?\"\n\n\"Very slightly,\" his son told him. \"The Guddus call them their 'little\ncousins,' and I believe can communicate to some extent, but I never\ncould.\"\n\nAs they broke from the jungle's fringe, they saw a double-squad of\nmarines on guard. The two were allowed through the lines, and entered\nthe office. Behind his desk, his face dead white from suspense, sat\nPeter Philander, and about the room sprawled the engineers, guards and\nother workers.\n\n\"Hi, Mr. Philander!\" Hanlon called cheerfully, and at sound of that\nremembered voice, the superintendent's head, as well as those of all the\nothers, snapped up.\n\n\"You!\" There was incredulity in the super's voice and manner.\n\n\"Yep, it's me,\" Hanlon grinned. \"I'm glad nothing happened to any of\nyou.\"\n\n\"_Hmmpff!_\" Philander snorted defeatedly. \"What's the difference between\nbeing killed cleanly in a fight, as against a lifetime in prison, or a\nfiring squad?\"\n\n\"You'll get neither one,\" Hanlon said quietly, remembering the power he,\nas a Secret Service operative, carried. \"There'll be a trial, of course,\nbut I know that you, at least, are all okay.\"\n\n\"He's boss, ain't he?\" one of the guards growled truculently. \"Why\nshould he get off free iffen th' rest of us don't?\"\n\n\"None of you will be harmed because of your part in the plot His\nHighness Gorth Bohr was scheming. That is broken, and we know you were\nall just his tools. All any of you will be tried for are your actions as\nregards the Greenies. If brutality against them is proven, you'll be\nproperly punished for that alone.\"\n\nHe turned to Philander. \"Are the natives all right?\"\n\nThe man looked up hopelessly, unable to believe Hanlon's statement about\nhimself. \"How do I know?\" his voice was dispirited. \"When the Corps\ncaptured us, they dragged us from wherever we were working, and as far\nas I know left the Greenies untended. They've probably all run back to\nthe woods.\"\n\nHanlon looked at his father. \"I'm going out to look. I have a\nfeeling ...\" and he walked out without saying more. Nor was he greatly\nsurprised to see the natives all sitting or standing quietly in their\ncompounds, some feeding from the fertilizer Hanlon was glad to see was\nstill being fed them, others merely resting, waiting.\n\nThe gates, of course, were unlocked and wide open, so Hanlon walked\nquickly back to the hut his crew occupied and stepped inside the\ndoorway. While waiting for his eyes to adjust to the dimness he saw a\nfigure launching itself at him. But as he quickly stepped back outside,\nin case it was an attack, he saw that it was Geck.\n\n\"You came back, you came back!\" the native was babbling telepathically\nin an excess of joy. \"When the new humans came and took the old humans\nprisoners, me said it was your work. Me knew you would come. Me tell\nother Guddu to wait for you here.\"\n\n\"What about those near the places where the ships were being built?\"\nHanlon's mind asked anxiously. \"I tried to get into contact with them\nbut couldn't.\"\n\n\"Many of they were killed, yet most ran to forests when great fires that\ndestroy were started,\" was the sad response.\n\nHanlon was silent a moment, then telepathed again. \"There is no need for\nyou all to stay here any longer. Tell all your people to go back to\ntheir forests, for they are all free.\"\n\nGeck turned to the other natives who were crowding close, and Hanlon\ncould see him talking swiftly with that peculiar-looking little\ntriangular-shaped mouth. Soon his mind was suffused with a tremendous\nwave of joy and ecstasy, and they began dashing out. Hanlon could see\nthem talking to the natives in all the huts, and in moments all the\nnatives except Geck were streaming happily toward the nearby forests.\n\nHanlon turned to Geck. \"I'd like to have you stay with me or where I can\nreach you for a while. As soon as we can get straightened around, we'll\nmake arrangements to do anything we can for you.\"\n\n\"Me stay with friend An-yon,\" Geck said simply, and Hanlon was glad and\nproud of that friendship with this strange alien.\n\nThey walked back to the mine office, and there Hanlon told his father\nabout what he had done with the natives.\n\nAdmiral Newton was intensely interested, and frankly studied the\nstrange, weird Geck. It was his first sight of these \"vegetable\"\ncreatures. \"Animated trees,\" Hanlon had first called them, although now\nthey were so familiar to him, and he knew them so well that he thought\nof them, naturally and without question, as \"people.\"\n\nThe young Secret Serviceman explained to the elder about the\nfrequency-transformer he had built--but dismantled before leaving Algon.\nHe suggested that specialists be sent here to see what could be done\nabout teaching the natives any of the things they might want to know.\n\n\"But don't let them try to force the Guddus into a mechanical\ncivilization,\" he pleaded. \"Let 'em grow in their own way, and make what\nprogress they can in whatever way comes natural to them.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" his father agreed quickly. \"That's the way we always work\nwith such primitives. We tell them and show them what we have, but only\ngive them what they specifically ask for, whether we think it is what\nthey 'ought to have' or not. Don't worry, your friends will be in good\nhands. But,\" there was a peculiar light in his eyes, \"I sure would like\nto watch an autopsy on one of them. A vegetable brain ...\"\n\n\"Yes, it would be interesting,\" Hanlon admitted, \"but I'm glad you treat\nthem that way.\" He turned back to Geck and explained, telepathically, as\nbest he could.\n\n\"You stay here with we,\" the Guddu asked hopefully.\n\n\"I'm sorry, but I have other work to do,\" and then, as he saw how the\nother lost heart. Hanlon hastened to add, \"I have to go help other\nenslaved peoples on other worlds.\"\n\n\"Then us not try to keep you. But us hope you come to see we many time.\"\n\n\"I'll do that, Geck my friend, every chance I get.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter 25\n\n\n\"We've got a problem here,\" Admiral Newton said as they followed the\nmarines who were taking the mine operatives to the cruiser to be taken\nback to Simonides for their trials.\n\n\"I know it,\" Hanlon said thoughtfully. \"The Guddus are too high in the\nscale for the planet to be colonized, and too low at present to be\nadmitted to the Federation as true members. Yet they have immense wealth\nand resources the Federation can use, and something will have to be done\nto protect them from thieves and others who might again try to enslave\nthem.\"\n\n\"That will never be allowed again. We'll have to make some sort of a\ntreaty with them, probably establish a small base here, and perhaps make\nsome arrangements to mine their ores--if we have anything we can give\nthem in repayment. I imagine you'd better hold yourself in readiness to\nhead the commission that comes to handle that treaty.\"\n\n\"Gee, thanks for that, Dad. They're such swell people when you get to\nknow them. Ordinarily they live like 'children of nature,' in the\nforests, without need of homes or tools or anything. They feed from the\nelements in the soil, so there's no food problem. We did give them\nnitrates here, but that was because they had exhausted the elements in\nthe dirt floors of their prison huts. In the woods that won't be needed.\nOh, well, when we get technies here, with transformers, we can find out\nwhat to do with them.\"\n\n\"I'm going back to the fleet now,\" the elder SS man said. \"I suppose you\nwant to go back to Simonides to handle the details of the trials of\nthese men. Incidentally, what about this ... Philander, did you say his\nname was? Why don't you think he'll need punishment?\"\n\nHanlon explained rapidly, finishing, \"So you see, with some psychiatric\ntreatments, I'm sure that inferiority can be cleaned up and then he'll\nbe a real asset to us or whoever hires him.\" A sudden gleam came into\nhis eyes. \"Say, if we make that treaty with the Guddus, he'd be just the\nman to take charge here, under Corps direction.\"\n\n\"Well, run along and see to it, then. And Spence, did I remember to tell\nyou how proud I am of you?\"\n\nHanlon hugged his father. \"Thanks, Dad. I hope you always will be. I\nsuppose the cruiser Commander will let me ride with him?\"\n\nNewton smiled fondly. \"Not 'let you,' Son. You merely tell him you're\ngoing to go along. Admiral Ferguson assigned that ship to you on special\nduty.\"\n\nHanlon's smile was embarrassed. \"I still think I'm too much of a kid for\nso much responsibility.\"\n\n\"Quit looking for sympathy.\" It was an affectionate growl.\n\n\"Okay, then. Safe flights, Dad--see you on Sime soon.\"\n\n\"Yes, I'll probably be there a day or so after you. Safe flights.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOnce the cruiser was in space, and the pressure of acceleration abated,\nHanlon sent word to the guards to bring Philander to his cabin. When\nthey had done so, he excused them, saying he would be responsible for\nthe safety of their prisoner.\n\n\"Sit down, sir,\" Hanlon said kindly to the wondering man.\n\n\"What's this all about, Hanlon?\" Philander puzzled. \"Who are you,\nanyway?\"\n\n\"I was assigned to find out what it was centering on Simonides that\nseemed inimical to the peace of the Federation. The trail led me to\nAlgon.\"\n\n\"Where you used me to further your schemes, eh?\" the tone was bitter.\n\n\"Please, Mr. Philander, don't misjudge me until you know all about it.\nFirst, let me ask you, did you know who 'His Highness' really was?\"\n\nThe mining engineer shrugged. \"You probably know already, so why ask me?\nPrime Minister of Simonides, of course ... but you said 'was'?\"\n\n\"He's dead now. Did you also know he wasn't human--that he was an alien\nfrom some ...\"\n\n\"Not human? You're crazy. He was as human as any of us.\"\n\n\"When we get back I'll show you a full-length X-ray of him if you wish.\nHe was planning the conquest of our entire Federation and Galaxy. The\nCorps experts are still working to find out just what the details of his\nscheme were, but that much we do know. Did you know about all the\nwarships he was building on Algon?\"\n\n\"Ships? On Algon?\" The surprises were coming too fast for Philander to\nadjust to them.\n\n\"Yes. Did you think your mine was all there was there? We know of nine\nmines of one kind or another, a number of factories, smelters, and three\ngreat shipyards. Incidentally, everything is now in the hands of the\nCorps.\"\n\nPhilander shook his head in stupefaction. \"I'm not calling you a liar,\nsir, but it's hard to believe you. I knew there were several mines, but\nnot that many, nor about the rest.\"\n\n\"It's all true enough. And I'm still 'George' to you, my good friend,\nnot 'sir'.\"\n\nThat was a little too much for the older man. \"What a mess I've made of\nmy life,\" he groaned.\n\nHanlon was intensely sorry and sympathetic, but in a way he was glad to\nsee this present mood. It would undoubtedly make easier what he wanted\nto do. He went over, sat on the arm of Philander's chair and put his arm\nabout the other's shoulder. He gently touched that terrible scar. \"When\nand how did you get this?\"\n\nPhilander shrank away from him, but the story raced across the surface\nof his mind, and Hanlon read it.\n\nWhen he (Philander) was about eight, a gang of boys were playing about\nan old, tumbled-down building, and somehow knocked out the prop holding\nup its remains. Three others were hurt, Philander got that cut-scar, and\nhis brother was killed.\n\n\"And you've felt all these years you were to blame for his death!\"\nHanlon exclaimed. \"When we get back I'm going to have the best plastic\nsurgeon remove that scar, so it will no longer be a constant reminder.\nThen a top psychiatrist will give you some therapy, and help you get\nyour mind at rest. After that you'll be ready to take your place in\nsociety as a very valuable citizen.\"\n\n\"You forget what's going to happen to me because of my part in this\nplot,\" Philander was still bitter and unconvinced.\n\n\"Nothing's going to happen to you--you weren't guilty of anything except\nhaving been hypnotized by an alien supermentality,\" Hanlon said\nconvincingly. \"I'll see to that, myself.\"\n\nPhilander looked up in surprise. \"You mean you ... a young fellow like\nyou ... can tell the ...\"\n\n\"Not exactly,\" Hanlon interrupted with a grin. \"But this was my\nassignment, and my recommendations will govern. The main thing is, will\nyou consent to the plan I've suggested?\"\n\nPhilander sat for long, thoughtful minutes, then looked up piteously.\n\"If you only can do it!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen the cruiser reached Simonides and Hanlon had seen the other mine\nworkers safely in the Corps prison at Base, and Philander installed in a\nroom next to his at the hotel, he called Admiral Hawarden.\n\n\"Congratulations on the mop-up, which I understand was one hundred point\noh oh oh percent,\" the officer said.\n\n\"Yes, the other end's under control. How about Bohr's notes?\"\n\n\"They finished last night. We've got a complete list of all the\nunderlings who knew any of the main parts of the conspiracy, and the SS\nagents have jugged them all.\"\n\n\"Good work.\"\n\n\"You did a grand job, sir. Again, my congratulations.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Admiral Hawarden. I've got to get busy now, on my report to the\nCouncil.\"\n\n\"Call on me for any help I can give. I'd offer you my confidential\nsecretary to dictate them to, if it wasn't so secret.\"\n\n\"Thanks. She would be a big help, but we'd better not.\"\n\n\"How'd you know it was a 'she'?\"\n\n\"Even a pigeon can admire a shapely shape,\" Hanlon quipped as he\ndisconnected.\n\nThe young SS man was just finishing his report the next day when Admiral\nNewton walked into his hotel room.\n\n\"Gosh, Dad, am I _especially_ glad to see you this time!\" his son\nenthused. \"I need you to check this report.\"\n\n\"Let's see what you've got.\" Newton settled down in a big chair to study\nthe report, while Hanlon fidgetted about the room, anxiously.\n\n\"A very clear, concise and complete report, Spence,\" Newton applauded\nwhen he finished reading.\n\n\"Where do I send it, and to whom?\"\n\nHis father looked at him quizzically. \"Have you forgotten about the\nspecial mail box for SS men?\"\n\nThe younger man looked astounded. \"You mean, even a thing like this\nmerely goes in there?\"\n\nNewton nodded. \"However, in this case, since I would have been the one\nto pick it up, I'll take it to Base and transmit it to the Council.\nIncidentally, future reports should be marked on the envelope 'Report to\nFederated Council'.\"\n\nA couple of hours later Admiral Hawarden called Hanlon at the hotel,\nwhere he had just finished making arrangements for Philander's operation\nand treatments.\n\n\"Your father and I want you to come to Base at once, sir.\"\n\nWhen he arrived in Hawarden's private office, the admiral handed him a\npair of silver bars. \"These are yours now, Captain Hanlon.\"\n\nThe young man looked up in surprise.\n\n\"You were told promotions were swift in the SS--for those who produce,\"\nhis father chuckled. \"The Council was very gratified with your report,\nand ordered the promotion.\"\n\nHanlon looked at the two insignia, and his fingers stroked them almost\ntenderly.\n\n\"You miss the uniform, don't you, Spence?\" sympathetically.\n\nHanlon gulped and nodded silently, very close to tears.\n\n\"Are you sorry you made the choice you did--to give all that up?\"\n\nA long, poignant moment of silence, then Hanlon threw back his head in a\ngesture of pride. \"No, Dad. I'm honestly glad I did it. To be able to\nfree those fine Guddus from slavery, and to save the Federation from\nthat horrible plot--it was well worth the little suffering it'll cost\nme. But,\" and his smile was pathetic, \"I do miss the uniform. I was so\nproud, wearing it.\"\n\nA moment, then Hawarden spoke. \"Here are the transcripts of the Bohr\nnotes,\" and soon the two SS men were deep in the study of them. When\nthey had finished some time later, they agreed it was a very\ncomprehensive plan.\n\n\"But did you notice,\" Hanlon's eyes were cloudy, \"he doesn't say a thing\nanywhere about the part his planet or system were to play in the\nconquest?\"\n\n\"Yes, I'd noticed that.\" It was a duet from the two others, and Newton\nadded, \"For all there is here, you'd almost feel sure he was playing a\nlone hand.\"\n\n\"If that's true,\" Hawarden said thankfully, \"none of the other men we've\npicked up matter--we might as well let them go.\"\n\n\"I'd say so,\" Newton agreed, \"if we can prove Bohr was in this for\nhimself, and was controlling them.\"\n\n\"From what I saw of him,\" Hanlon said seriously after a long moment of\nthought, \"I'd say he was capable of trying it. He certainly had 'the\nwill to power.' And he was no dummy--he had a really powerful mind. But\nhe was cold beneath that suave, soft-seeming exterior. He was utterly\nwithout compassion, mercy, or any feeling of justice. He wouldn't care\nwho or what was damaged as long as he could get what he wanted. I doubt\nif there was anyone he could really call a friend, or to whom he could\ntalk in full confidence.\"\n\n\"Except possibly that bird you told ...\" his father began, absently,\nwhen Hanlon interrupted with a whoop.\n\n\"Hey, that's it!\" He jumped up and ran to the visiphone, and dialed the\nzoo. \"Bring that toogan of Bohr's back to Base!\"\n\n\"What, again?\" the indignant curator asked.\n\n\"I'm sorry, sir, but this is probably the last time we'll need it.\nPlease get it here immediately.\"\n\n\"What's the excitement?\" Newton asked curiously.\n\n\"Your remark reminded me of something I noticed only dimly in its mind,\nand didn't pursue at the time.\"\n\nWhile they were waiting for the bird, Hanlon asked, \"What about the new\nships? Have the experts got 'em figured out yet?\"\n\n\"Not entirely. The hulls are about the same as the Snyder ships, only\nlarger. But that new power system is so radically different they're\ngoing rapidly nuts trying to understand it. And they do have\ntractor-beams.\"\n\nNo sooner had the messenger left after delivering the toogan than Hanlon\nhad it out of the cage, and perched on the arm of his chair. Then for\nnearly an hour he sat there, deaf, dumb and blind to all else while he\nexplored every nook and cranny of that avian mind.\n\n\"Got it!\" he yelled at last, and the bird, freed from control, sprang\ninto the air and flew wildly about, seeking escape.\n\n\"What did you learn?\" the admirals were as excited as he.\n\n\"We've nothing to fear. Bohr was entirely on his own. The people of his\nplanetary system--Canopus--are so far advanced they live on a completely\nco-operative basis, every one instinctively working for the common good\nof all. Bohr was an atavism--they caught him trying to 'take over'\nthere, and banished him. He came here, for his restless mind and savage\nurge to dominate others would not let him rest until he was absolute\nruler of some world or system--the bigger the better from his\nviewpoint.\"\n\n\"And you got all that from a bird?\" incredulously.\n\n\"Yes. You were right when you said Bohr didn't have a friend except the\ntoogan. I think that's why he sort of liked me--perhaps he felt I would\nbe one. All men have the need to talk to someone, some times, so Bohr\nchose this toogan, who is really quite intelligent, and who could talk\nback with him. The bird doesn't 'remember' it all, of course, but it's\nall engraved on his brain.\"\n\n\"That means, then,\" Newton said thankfully, \"that we won't have to worry\nabout a war with another system or galaxy.\"\n\n\"Yes, and that's a real help,\" Hawarden added. \"Even one man, or entity,\nlike Bohr, could have given us a bad enough time, and perhaps even\nwrecked the Federation.\"\n\n\"Well, I guess that winds it up except for a lot of detail work,\" Newton\nrose. \"I've got to get back to my own job on Estrella. Hawarden, call\nthe port and have them ready my ship, please. And it's been good seeing\nyou again. Thanks for everything.\"\n\n\"Safe flights, Newton,\" and the admiral started calling the spaceport.\n\n\"You'll get your orders in a day or two about going back to Algon with\nthe commission,\" Newton told Hanlon. \"Might as well stay here until\nthen.\"\n\nAfter affectionate farewells he started out, then stopped, bursting into\na laugh.\n\n\"What's the gag, Dad?\"\n\n\"It just came to me that this was once where the son told the father all\nabout 'the birds and the bees'.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Hanlon quipped, but kept his face straight. \"I figured you were\nold enough now to know.\"\n\n\nThe End\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Man of Many Minds, by E.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n*** END: FULL LICENSE ***\n"}
