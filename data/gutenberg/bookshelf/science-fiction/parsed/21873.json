The light fencing foil in his hand\nfelt as heavy as a bar of lead to his exhausted muscles, worn out by\na month of continual exercise. These things were of no importance.\nThe cut on his chest, still dripping blood, the ache of his\noverstrained eyes--even the soaring arena around him with the\nthousands of spectators--were trivialities not worth thinking about.\nThere was only one thing in his universe: the button-tipped length\nof shining steel that hovered before him, engaging his own weapon.\nHe felt the quiver and scrape of its life, knew when it moved and\nmoved himself to counteract it. And when he attacked, it was always\nthere to beat him aside.\n\nA sudden motion. He reacted--but his blade just met air. His instant\nof panic was followed by a small sharp blow high on his chest.\n\n\"_Touch!_\" A world-shaking voice bellowed the word to a million\nwaiting loudspeakers, and the applause of the audience echoed back\nin a wave of sound.\n\n\"One minute,\" a voice said, and the time buzzer sounded.\n\nBrion had carefully conditioned the reflex in himself. A minute is\nnot a very large measure of time and his body needed every fraction\nof it. The buzzer's whirr triggered his muscles into complete\nrelaxation. Only his heart and lungs worked on at a strong,\nmeasured rate. His eyes closed and he was only distantly aware of\nhis handlers catching him as he fell, carrying him to his bench.\nWhile they massaged his limp body and cleansed the wound, all of his\nattention was turned inward. He was in reverie, sliding along the\nborders of consciousness. The nagging memory of the previous night\nloomed up then, and he turned it over and over in his mind,\nexamining it from all sides.\n\nIt was the very unexpectedness of the event that had been so\nunusual. The contestants in the Twenties needed undisturbed rest,\ntherefore nights in the dormitories were as quiet as death. During\nthe first few days, of course, the rule wasn't observed too closely.\nThe men themselves were too keyed up and excited to rest easily. But\nas soon as the scores began to mount and eliminations cut into their\nranks, there was complete silence after dark. Particularly so on\nthis last night, when only two of the little cubicles were occupied,\nthe thousands of others standing with dark, empty doors.\n\nAngry words had dragged Brion from a deep and exhausted sleep. The\nwords were whispered but clear--two voices, just outside the thin\nmetal of his door. Someone spoke his name.\n\n\"... Brion Brandd. Of course not. Whoever said you could was making\na big mistake and there is going to be trouble--\"\n\n\"Don't talk like an idiot!\" The other voice snapped with a harsh\nurgency, clearly used to command. \"I'm here because the matter is of\nutmost importance, and Brandd is the one I must see. Now stand aside!\"\n\n\"The Twenties--\"\n\n\"I don't give a damn about your games, hearty cheers and physical\nexercises. This is _important_, or I wouldn't be here!\"\n\nThe other didn't speak--he was surely one of the officials--and\nBrion could sense his outraged anger. He must have drawn his gun,\nbecause the intruder said quickly, \"Put that away. You're being a\nfool!\"\n\n\"Out!\" was the single snarled word of the response. There was\nsilence then and, still wondering, Brion was once more asleep.\n\n\"Ten seconds.\"\n\nThe voice chopped away Brion's memories and he let awareness seep\nback into his body. He was unhappily conscious of his total\nexhaustion. The month of continuous mental and physical combat had\ntaken its toll. It would be hard to stay on his feet, much less\nsummon the strength and skill to fight and win a touch.\n\n\"How do we stand?\" he asked the handler who was kneading his aching\nmuscles.\n\n\"Four-four. All you need is a touch to win!\"\n\n\"That's all he needs too,\" Brion grunted, opening his eyes to look\nat the wiry length of the man at the other end of the long mat. No\none who had reached the finals in the Twenties could possibly be\na weak opponent, but this one, Irolg, was the pick of the lot. A\nred-haired mountain of a man, with an apparently inexhaustible store\nof energy. That was really all that counted now. There could be\nlittle art in this last and final round of fencing. Just thrust and\nparry, and victory to the stronger.\n\nBrion closed his eyes again and knew the moment he had been hoping\nto avoid had arrived.\n\nEvery man who entered the Twenties had his own training tricks.\nBrion had a few individual ones that had helped him so far. He was\na moderately strong chess player, but he had moved to quick victory\nin the chess rounds by playing incredibly unorthodox games. This was\nno accident, but the result of years of work. He had a standing order\nwith off-planet agents for archaic chess books, the older the\nbetter. He had memorized thousands of these ancient games and\nopenings. This was allowed. Anything was allowed that didn't involve\ndrugs or machines. Self-hypnosis was an accepted tool.\n\nIt had taken Brion over two years to find a way to tap the sources\nof hysterical strength. Common as the phenomenon seemed to be in the\ntextbooks, it proved impossible to duplicate. There appeared to be\nan immediate association with the death-trauma, as if the two were\ninextricably linked into one. Berserkers and juramentados continue\nto fight and kill though carved by scores of mortal wounds. Men with\nbullets in the heart or brain fight on, though already clinically\ndead. Death seemed an inescapable part of this kind of strength.\nBut there was another type that could easily be brought about in any\ndeep trance--hypnotic rigidity. The strength that enables someone\nin a trance to hold his body stiff and unsupported except at two\npoints, the head and heels. This is physically impossible when\nconscious. Working with this as a clue, Brion had developed a\nself-hypnotic technique that allowed him to tap this reservoir of\nunknown strength--the source of \"second wind,\" the survival strength\nthat made the difference between life and death.\n\nIt could also kill--exhaust the body beyond hope of recovery,\nparticularly when in a weakened condition as his was now. But that\nwasn't important. Others had died before during the Twenties, and\ndeath during the last round was in some ways easier than defeat.\n\nBreathing deeply, Brion softly spoke the auto-hypnotic phrases that\ntriggered the process. Fatigue fell softly from him, as did all\nsensations of heat, cold and pain. He could feel with acute\nsensitivity, hear, and see clearly when he opened his eyes.\n\nWith each passing second the power drew at the basic reserves of\nlife, draining it from his body.\n\nWhen the buzzer sounded he pulled his foil from his second's\nstartled grasp, and ran forward. Irolg had barely time to grab up\nhis own weapon and parry Brion's first thrust. The force of his rush\nwas so great that the guards on their weapons locked, and their\nbodies crashed together. Irolg looked amazed at the sudden fury of\nthe attack--then smiled. He thought it was a last burst of energy,\nhe knew how close they both were to exhaustion. This must be the end\nfor Brion.\n\nThey disengaged and Irolg put up a solid defense. He didn't attempt\nto attack, just let Brion wear himself out against the firm shield\nof his defense.\n\nBrion saw something close to panic on his opponent's face when the\nman finally recognized his error. Brion wasn't tiring. If anything,\nhe was pressing the attack. A wave of despair rolled out from\nIrolg--Brion sensed it and knew the fifth point was his.\n\nThrust--thrust--and each time the parrying sword a little slower to\nreturn. Then the powerful twist that thrust it aside. In and under\nthe guard. The slap of the button on flesh and the arc of steel that\nreached out and ended on Irolg's chest over his heart.\n\nWaves of sound--cheering and screaming--lapped against Brion's\nprivate world, but he was only remotely aware of their existence.\nIrolg dropped his foil, and tried to shake Brion's hand, but his\nlegs suddenly gave way. Brion had an arm around him, holding him up,\nwalking towards the rushing handlers. Then Irolg was gone and he\nwaved off his own men, walking slowly by himself.\n\nExcept that something was wrong and it was like walking through warm\nglue. Walking on his knees. No, not walking, falling. At last. He\nwas able to let go and fall.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nIhjel gave the doctors exactly one day before he went to the\nhospital. Brion wasn't dead, though there had been some doubt about\nthat the night before. Now, a full day later, he was on the mend and\nthat was all Ihjel wanted to know. He bullied and strong-armed his\nway to the new Winner's room, meeting his first stiff resistance at\nthe door.\n\n\"You're out of order, Winner Ihjel,\" the doctor said. \"And if you\nkeep on forcing yourself in here, where you are not wanted, rank or\nno rank, I shall be obliged to break your head.\"\n\nIhjel had just begun to tell him, in some detail, just how slim his\nchances were of accomplishing that, when Brion interrupted them\nboth. He recognized the newcomer's voice from the final night in\nthe barracks.\n\n\"Let him in, Dr. Caulry,\" he said. \"I want to meet a man who thinks\nthere is something more important than the Twenties.\"\n\nWhile the doctor stood undecided, Ihjel moved quickly around him and\nclosed the door in his flushed face. He looked down at the Winner in\nthe bed. There was a drip plugged into each one of Brion's arms. His\neyes peered from sooty hollows; the eyeballs were a network of red\nveins. The silent battle he fought against death had left its mark.\nHis square, jutting jaw now seemed all bone, as did his long nose\nand high cheekbones. They were prominent landmarks rising from the\nlimp greyness of his skin. Only the erect bristle of his\nclose-cropped hair was unchanged. He had the appearance of having\nsuffered a long and wasting illness.\n\n\"You look like sin,\" Ihjel said. \"But congratulations on your\nvictory.\"\n\n\"You don't look so very good yourself--for a Winner,\" Brion snapped\nback. His exhaustion and sudden peevish anger at this man let the\ninsulting words slip out. Ihjel ignored them.\n\nBut it was true; Winner Ihjel looked very little like a Winner, or\neven an Anvharian. He had the height and the frame all right, but it\nwas draped in billows of fat--rounded, soft tissue that hung loosely\nfrom his limbs and made little limp rolls on his neck and under his\neyes. There were no fat men on Anvhar, and it was incredible that\na man so gross could ever have been a Winner. If there was muscle\nunder the fat it couldn't be seen. Only his eyes appeared to still\nhold the strength that had once bested every man on the planet to\nwin the annual games. Brion turned away from their burning stare,\nsorry now he had insulted the man without good reason. He was too\nsick, though, to bother about apologizing.\n\nIhjel didn't care either. Brion looked at him again and felt the\nimpression of things so important that he himself, his insults, even\nthe Twenties were of no more interest than dust motes in the air. It\nwas only a fantasy of a sick mind, Brion knew, and he tried to shake\nthe feeling off. The two men stared at each other, sharing a common\nemotion.\n\nThe door opened soundlessly behind Ihjel and he wheeled about,\nmoving as only an athlete of Anvhar can move. Dr. Caulry was halfway\nthrough the door, off balance. Two men in uniform came close behind\nhim. Ihjel's body pushed against them, his speed and the mountainous\nmass of his flesh sending them back in a tangle of arms and legs. He\nslammed the door and locked it in their faces.\n\n\"I have to talk to you,\" he said, turning back to Brion.\n\"Privately,\" he added, bending over and ripping out the communicator\nwith a sweep of one hand.\n\n\"Get out,\" Brion told him. \"If I were able--\"\n\n\"Well, you're not, so you're just going to have to lie there and\nlisten. I imagine we have about five minutes before they decide to\nbreak the door down, and I don't want to waste any more of that.\nWill you come with me offworld? There's a job that must be done;\nit's my job, but I'm going to need help. You're the only one who can\ngive me that help.\n\n\"Now refuse,\" he added as Brion started to answer.\n\n\"Of course I refuse,\" Brion said, feeling a little foolish and\nslightly angry, as if the other man had put the words into his\nmouth. \"Anvhar is my planet--why should I leave? My life is here and\nso is my work. I also might add that I have just won the Twenties.\nI have a responsibility to remain.\"\n\n\"Nonsense. I'm a Winner, and I left. What you really mean is you\nwould like to enjoy a little of the ego-inflation you have worked so\nhard to get. Off Anvhar no one even knows what a Winner is--much\nless respects one. You will have to face a big universe out there,\nand I don't blame you for being a little frightened.\"\n\nSomeone was hammering loudly on the door.\n\n\"I haven't the strength to get angry,\" Brion said hoarsely. \"And\nI can't bring myself to admire your ideas when they permit you to\ninsult a man too ill to defend himself.\"\n\n\"I apologize,\" Ihjel said, with no hint of apology or sympathy in\nhis voice. \"But there are more desperate issues involved than your\nhurt feelings. We don't have much time now, so I want to impress you\nwith an idea.\"\n\n\"An idea that will convince me to go offplanet with you? That's\nexpecting a lot.\"\n\n\"No, this idea won't convince you--but thinking about it will.\nIf you really _consider_ it you will find a lot of your illusions\nshattered. Like everyone else on Anvhar, you're a scientific\nhumanist, with your faith firmly planted in the Twenties. You accept\nboth of these noble institutions without an instant's thought. All\nof you haven't a single thought for the past, for the untold\nbillions who led the bad life as mankind slowly built up the good\nlife for you to lead. Do you ever think of all the people who\nsuffered and died in misery and superstition while civilization\nwas clicking forward one more slow notch?\"\n\n\"Of course I don't think about them,\" Brion retorted. \"Why should I?\nI can't change the past.\"\n\n\"But you can change the future!\" Ihjel said. \"You owe something\nto the suffering ancestors who got you where you are today. If\nScientific Humanism means anything more than just words to you,\nyou must possess a sense of responsibility. Don't you want to try\nand pay off a bit of this debt by helping others who are just as\nbackward and disease-ridden today as great-grandfather Troglodyte\never was?\"\n\nThe hammering on the door was louder. This and the drug-induced\nbuzzing in Brion's ear made thinking difficult. \"Abstractly, I of\ncourse agree with you,\" he said haltingly. \"But you know there is\nnothing I can do personally without being emotionally involved. A\nlogical decision is valueless for action without personal meaning.\"\n\n\"Then we have reached the crux of the matter,\" Ihjel said gently.\nHis back was braced against the door, absorbing the thudding blows\nof some heavy object on the outside. \"They're knocking, so I must be\ngoing soon. I have no time for details, but I can assure you upon my\nword of honor as a Winner that there is something you can do. Only\nyou. If you help me we might save seven million human lives. That\nis a fact.\"\n\nThe lock burst and the door started to open. Ihjel shouldered it\nback into the frame for a final instant.\n\n\"Here is the idea I want you to consider. Why is it that the people\nof Anvhar, in a galaxy filled with warring, hate-filled, backward\nplanets, should be the only ones who base their entire existence\non a complicated series of games?\"\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nThis time there was no way to hold the door. Ihjel didn't try. He\nstepped aside and two men stumbled into the room. He walked out\nbehind their backs without saying a word.\n\n\"What happened? What did he do?\" the doctor asked, rushing in\nthrough the ruined door. He swept a glance over the continuous\nrecording dials at the foot of Brion's bed. Respiration,\ntemperature, heart, blood pressure--all were normal. The patient lay\nquietly and didn't answer him.\n\nFor the rest of that day, Brion had much to think about. It was\ndifficult. The fatigue, mixed with the tranquilizers and other\ndrugs, had softened his contact with reality. His thoughts kept\nechoing back and forth in his mind, unable to escape. What had Ihjel\nmeant? What was that nonsense about Anvhar? Anvhar was that way\nbecause--well, it just was. It had come about naturally. Or had it?\n\nThe planet had a very simple history. From the very beginning there\nhad never been anything of real commercial interest on Anvhar. Well\noff the interstellar trade routes, there were no minerals worth\ndigging and transporting the immense distances to the nearest\ninhabited worlds. Hunting the winter beasts for their pelts was a\nprofitable but very minor enterprise, never sufficient for mass\nmarkets. Therefore no organized attempt had ever been made to\ncolonize the planet. In the end it had been settled completely by\nchance. A number of offplanet scientific groups had established\nobservation and research stations, finding unlimited data to observe\nand record during Anvhar's unusual yearly cycle. The long-duration\nobservations encouraged the scientific workers to bring their\nfamilies and, slowly but steadily, small settlements grew up. Many\nof the fur hunters settled there as well, adding to the small\npopulation. This had been the beginning.\n\nFew records existed of those early days, and the first six centuries\nof Anvharian history were more speculation than fact. The Breakdown\noccurred about that time, and in the galaxy-wide disruption Anvhar\nhad to fight its own internal battle. When the Earth Empire\ncollapsed it was the end of more than an era. Many of the\nobservation stations found themselves representing institutions that\nno longer existed. The professional hunters no longer had markets\nfor their furs, since Anvhar possessed no interstellar ships of its\nown. There had been no real physical hardship involved in the\nBreakdown as it affected Anvhar, since the planet was completely\nself-sufficient. Once they had made the mental adjustment to the\nfact that they were now a sovereign world, not a collection of\ncasual visitors with various loyalties, life continued unchanged.\nNot easy--living on Anvhar is never easy--but at least without\ndifference on the surface.\n\nThe thoughts and attitudes of the people were, however, going\nthrough a great transformation. Many attempts were made to develop\nsome form of stable society and social relationship. Again, little\nrecord exists of these early trials, other than the fact of their\nculmination in the Twenties.\n\nTo understand the Twenties, you have to understand the unusual orbit\nthat Anvhar tracks around its sun, 70 Ophiuchi. There are other\nplanets in this system, all of them more or less conforming to the\nplane of the ecliptic. Anvhar is obviously a rogue, perhaps a\ncaptured planet of another sun. For the greatest part of its 780-day\nyear it arcs far out from its primary, in a high-angled sweeping\ncometary orbit. When it returns there is a brief, hot summer of\napproximately eighty days before the long winter sets in once more.\nThis severe difference in seasonal change has caused profound\nadaptations in the native life forms. During the winter most of the\nanimals hibernate, the vegetable life lying dormant as spores or\nseeds. Some of the warm-blooded herbivores stay active in the\nsnow-covered tropics, preyed upon by fur-insulated carnivores.\nThough unbelievably cold, the winter is a season of peace in\ncomparison to the summer.\n\nFor summer is a time of mad growth. Plants burst into life with\na strength that cracks rocks, growing fast enough for the motion\nto be seen. The snowfields melt into mud and within days a jungle\nstretches high into the air. Everything grows, swells, proliferates.\nPlants climb on top of plants, fighting for the life-energy of the\nsun. Everything is eat and be eaten, grow and thrive in that short\nseason. Because when the first snow of winter falls again, ninety\nper cent of the year must pass until the next coming of warmth.\n\nMankind has had to adapt to the Anvharian cycle in order to stay\nalive. Food must be gathered and stored, enough to last out the long\nwinter. Generation after generation had adapted until they look on\nthe mad seasonal imbalance as something quite ordinary. The first\nthaw of the almost nonexistent spring triggers a wide-reaching\nmetabolic change in the humans. Layers of subcutaneous fat vanish\nand half-dormant sweat glands come to life. Other changes are more\nsubtle than the temperature adjustment, but equally important. The\nsleep center of the brain is depressed. Short naps or a night's rest\nevery third or fourth day becomes enough. Life takes on a hectic and\nhysterical quality that is perfectly suited to the environment. By\nthe time of the first frost, rapid-growing crops have been raised\nand harvested, sides of meat either preserved or frozen in mammoth\nlockers. With this supreme talent of adaptability mankind has become\npart of the ecology and guaranteed his own survival during the long\nwinter.\n\nPhysical survival has been guaranteed. But what about mental\nsurvival? Primitive Earth Eskimos can fall into a long doze of\nhalf-conscious hibernation. Civilized men might be able to do this,\nbut only for the few cold months of terrestrial midwinter. It would\nbe impossible to do during a winter that is longer than an Earth\nyear. With all the physical needs taken care of, boredom became the\nenemy of any Anvharian who was not a hunter. And even the hunters\ncould not stay out on solitary trek all winter. Drink was one\nanswer, and violence another. Alcoholism and murder were the twin\nterrors of the cold season, after the Breakdown.\n\nIt was the Twenties that ended all that. When they became a\npart of normal life the summer was considered just an interlude\nbetween games. The Twenties were more than just a contest--they\nbecame a way of life that satisfied all the physical, competitive\nand intellectual needs of this unusual planet. They were a\ndecathlon--rather a double decathlon--raised to its highest power,\nwhere contests in chess and poetry composition held equal place\nwith those in ski-jumping and archery. Each year there were two\nplanet-wide contests held, one for men and one for women. This was\nnot an attempt at sexual discrimination, but a logical facing of\nfacts. Inherent differences prevented fair contests--for example, it\nis impossible for a woman to win a large chess tournament--and this\nfact was recognized. Anyone could enter for any number of years.\nThere were no scoring handicaps.\n\nWhen the best man won he was really the best man. A complicated\nseries of playoffs and eliminations kept contestants and observers\nbusy for half the winter. They were only preliminary to the final\nencounter that lasted a month, and picked a single winner. That was\nthe title he was awarded. Winner. The man--and woman--who had bested\nevery other contestant on the entire planet and who would remain\nunchallenged until the following year.\n\nWinner. It was a title to take pride in. Brion stirred weakly on his\nbed and managed to turn so he could look out of the window. Winner\nof Anvhar. His name was already slated for the history books, one of\nthe handful of planetary heroes. School children would be studying\n_him_ now, just as he had read of the Winners of the past. Weaving\ndaydreams and imaginary adventures around Brion's victories, hoping\nand fighting to equal them someday. To be a Winner was the greatest\nhonor in the universe.\n\nOutside, the afternoon sun shimmered weakly in a dark sky. The\nendless icefields soaked up the dim light, reflecting it back as a\ncolder and harsher illumination. A single figure on skis cut a line\nacross the empty plain; nothing else moved. The depression of the\nultimate fatigue fell on Brion and everything changed, as if he\nlooked in a mirror at a previously hidden side.\n\nHe saw suddenly--with terrible clarity--that to be a Winner was to\nbe absolutely nothing. Like being the best flea, among all the fleas\non a single dog.\n\nWhat was Anvhar after all? An ice-locked planet, inhabited by a few\nmillion human fleas, unknown and unconsidered by the rest of the\ngalaxy. There was nothing here worth fighting for; the wars after\nthe Breakdown had left them untouched. The Anvharians had always\ntaken pride in this--as if being so unimportant that no one else\neven wanted to come near you could possibly be a source of pride.\nAll the other worlds of man grew, fought, won, lost, changed. Only\non Anvhar did life repeat its sameness endlessly, like a loop of\ntape in a player....\n\nBrion's eyes were moist; he blinked. _Tears!_ Realization of this\nincredible fact wiped the maudlin pity from his mind and replaced it\nwith fear. Had his mind snapped in the strain of the last match?\nThese thoughts weren't his. Self-pity hadn't made him a Winner--why\nwas he feeling it now? Anvhar was his universe--how could he even\nimagine it as a tag-end planet at the outer limb of creation? What\nhad come over him and induced this inverse thinking?\n\nAs he thought the question, the answer appeared at the same instant.\nWinner Ihjel. The fat man with the strange pronouncements and\nprobing questions. Had he cast a spell like some sorcerer--or the\ndevil in _Faust_? No, that was pure nonsense. But he had done\nsomething. Perhaps planted a suggestion when Brion's resistance was\nlow. Or used subliminal vocalization like the villain in _Cerebrus\nChained_. Brion could find no adequate reason on which to base his\nsuspicions. But he knew, with sure positiveness, that Ihjel was\nresponsible.\n\nHe whistled at the sound-switch next to his pillow and the repaired\ncommunicator came to life. The duty nurse appeared in the small screen.\n\n\"The man who was here today,\" Brion said, \"Winner Ihjel. Do you know\nwhere he is? I must contact him.\"\n\nFor some reason this flustered her professional calm. The nurse\nstarted to answer, excused herself, and blanked the screen. When\nit lit again a man in guard's uniform had taken her place.\n\n\"You made an inquiry,\" the guard said, \"about Winner Ihjel. We are\nholding him here in the hospital, following the disgraceful way in\nwhich he broke into your room.\"\n\n\"I have no charges to make. Will you ask him to come and see me at\nonce?\"\n\nThe guard controlled his shock. \"I'm sorry, Winner--I don't see how\nwe can. Dr. Caulry left specific orders that you were not to be--\"\n\n\"The doctor has no control over my personal life.\" Brion\ninterrupted. \"I'm not infectious, nor ill with anything more than\nextreme fatigue. I want to see that man. At once.\"\n\nThe guard took a deep breath, and made a quick decision. \"He is on\nthe way up now,\" he said, and rung off.\n\n\"What did you do to me?\" Brion asked as soon as Ihjel had entered\nand they were alone. \"You won't deny that you have put alien\nthoughts in my head?\"\n\n\"No, I won't deny it. Because the whole point of my being here is\nto get those 'alien' thoughts across to you.\"\n\n\"Tell me how you did it,\" Brion insisted. \"I must know.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you--but there are many things you should understand\nfirst, before you decide to leave Anvhar. You must not only hear\nthem, you will have to believe them. The primary thing, the clue\nto the rest, is the true nature of your life here. How do you think\nthe Twenties originated?\"\n\nBefore he answered, Brion carefully took a double dose of the mild\nstimulant he was allowed. \"I don't think,\" he said; \"I know. It's\na matter of historical record. The founder of the games was Giroldi,\nthe first contest was held in 378 A.B. The Twenties have been held\nevery year since then. They were strictly local affairs in the\nbeginning, but were soon well established on a planet-wide scale.\"\n\n\"True enough,\" Ihjel said. \"But you're describing _what_ happened.\nI asked you _how_ the Twenties originated. How could any single man\ntake a barbarian planet, lightly inhabited by half-mad hunters and\nalcoholic farmers, and turn it into a smooth-running social machine\nbuilt around the artificial structure of the Twenties? It just\ncouldn't be done.\"\n\n\"But it _was_ done!\" Brion insisted. \"You can't deny that. And there\nis nothing artificial about the Twenties. They are a logical way to\nlive a life on a planet like this.\"\n\nIhjel laughed, a short ironic bark. \"Very logical,\" he said; \"but\nhow often does logic have anything to do with the organization of\nsocial groups and governments? You're not thinking. Put yourself in\nfounder Giroldi's place. Imagine that you have glimpsed the great\nidea of the Twenties and you want to convince others. So you walk up\nto the nearest louse-ridden, brawling, superstitious, booze-embalmed\nhunter and explain clearly. How a program of his favorite\nsports--things like poetry, archery and chess--can make his life\nthat much more interesting and virtuous. You do that. But keep your\neyes open at the same time, and be ready for a fast draw.\"\n\nEven Brion had to smile at the absurdity of the suggestion. Of\ncourse it couldn't happen that way. Yet, since it had happened,\nthere must be a simple explanation.\n\n\"We can beat this back and forth all day,\" Ihjel told him, \"and you\nwon't get the right idea unless--\" He broke off suddenly, staring at\nthe communicator. The operation light had come on, though the screen\nstayed dark. Ihjel reached down a meaty hand and pulled loose\nthe recently connected wires. \"That doctor of yours is very\ncurious--and he's going to stay that way. The truth behind the\nTwenties is none of his business. But it's going to be yours. You\nmust come to realize that the life you lead here is a complete and\nartificial construction, developed by Societics experts and put into\napplication by skilled field workers.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" Brion broke in. \"Systems of society can't be dreamed up\nand forced on people like that. Not without bloodshed and violence.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, yourself,\" Ihjel told him. \"That may have been true in\nthe dawn of history, but not any more. You have been reading too\nmany of the old Earth classics; you imagine that we still live in\nthe Ages of Superstition. Just because fascism and communism were\nonce forced on reluctant populations, you think this holds true for\nall time. Go back to your books. In exactly the same era democracy\nand self-government were adapted by former colonial states, like\nIndia and the Union of North Africa, and the only violence was\nbetween local religious groups. Change is the lifeblood of mankind.\nEverything we today accept as normal was at one time an innovation.\nAnd one of the most recent innovations is the attempt to guide the\nsocieties of mankind into something more consistent with the\npersonal happiness of individuals.\"\n\n\"The God complex,\" Brion said; \"forcing human lives into a mold\nwhether they want to be fitted into it or not.\"\n\n\"Societies can be that,\" Ihjel agreed. \"It was in the beginning, and\nthere were some disastrous results of attempts to force populations\ninto a political climate where they didn't belong. They weren't all\nfailures--Anvhar here is a striking example of how good the\ntechnique can be when correctly applied. It's not done this way any\nmore, though. As with all of the other sciences, we have found out\nthat the more we know, the more there is to know. We no longer\nattempt to guide cultures towards what we consider a beneficial\ngoal. There are too many goals, and from our limited vantage point\nit is hard to tell the good ones from the bad ones. All we do now\nis try to protect the growing cultures, give a little jolt to the\nstagnating ones--and bury the dead ones. When the work was first\ndone here on Anvhar the theory hadn't progressed that far. The\nunderstandably complex equations that determine just where in the\nscale from a Type I to a Type V a culture is, had not yet been\ncompleted. The technique then was to work out an artificial culture\nthat would be most beneficial for a planet, then bend it into the\nmold.\"\n\n\"How can that be done?\" Brion asked. \"How was it done here?\"\n\n\"We've made some progress--you're finally asking 'how.' The\ntechnique here took a good number of agents, and a great deal of\nmoney. Personal honor was emphasized in order to encourage dueling,\nand this led to a heightened interest in the technique of personal\ncombat. When this was well intrenched Giroldi was brought in, and\nhe showed how organized competitions could be more interesting than\nhaphazard encounters. Tying the intellectual aspects onto the\nframework of competitive sports was a little more difficult, but\nnot overwhelmingly so. The details aren't important; all we are\nconsidering now is the end product. Which is you. You're needed\nvery much.\"\n\n\"Why me?\" Brion asked. \"Why am I special? Because I won the\nTwenties? I can't believe that. Taken objectively, there isn't that\nmuch difference between myself and the ten runner-ups. Why don't you\nask one of them? They could do your job as well as I.\"\n\n\"No, they couldn't. I'll tell you later why you are the only man\nI can use. Our time is running out and I must convince you of some\nother things first.\" Ihjel glanced at his watch. \"We have less than\nthree hours to dead-deadline. Before that time I must explain enough\nof our work to you to enable you to decide voluntarily to join us.\"\n\n\"A very tall order,\" Brion said. \"You might begin by telling me just\nwho this mysterious 'we' is that you keep referring to.\"\n\n\"The Cultural Relationships Foundation. A non-governmental body,\nprivately endowed, existing to promote peace and ensure the\nsovereign welfare of independent planets, so that all will prosper\nfrom the good will and commerce thereby engendered.\"\n\n\"Sounds as if you're quoting,\" Brion told him. \"No one could\npossibly make up something that sounds like that on the spur of\nthe moment.\"\n\n\"I _was_ quoting, from our charter of organization. Which is all\nvery fine in a general sense, but I'm talking specifically now.\nAbout you. You are the product of a tightly knit and very advanced\nsociety. Your individuality has been encouraged by your growing up\nin a society so small in population that a mild form of government\ncontrol is necessary. The normal Anvharian education is an excellent\none, and participation in the Twenties has given you a general and\nadvanced education second to none in the galaxy. It would be a\ncomplete waste of your entire life if you now took all this training\nand wasted it on some rustic farm.\"\n\n\"You give me very little credit. I plan to teach--\"\n\n\"Forget Anvhar!\" Ihjel cut him off with a chop of his hand. \"This\nworld will roll on quite successfully whether you are here or not.\nYou must forget it, think of its relative unimportance on a galactic\nscale, and consider instead the existing, suffering hordes of\nmankind. You must think what you can do to help them.\"\n\n\"But what can I do--as an individual? The day is long past when\na single man, like Caesar or Alexander, could bring about\nworld-shaking changes.\"\n\n\"True--but not true,\" Ihjel said. \"There are key men in every\nconflict of forces, men who act like catalysts applied at the right\ninstant to start a chemical reaction. You might be one of these men,\nbut I must be honest and say that I can't prove it yet. So in order\nto save time and endless discussion, I think I will have to spark\nyour personal sense of obligation.\"\n\n\"Obligation to whom?\"\n\n\"To mankind, of course, to the countless billions of dead who kept\nthe whole machine rolling along that allows you the full, long and\nhappy life you enjoy today. What they gave to you, you must pass on\nto others. This is the keystone of humanistic morals.\"\n\n\"Agreed. And a very good argument in the long run. But not one that\nis going to tempt me out of this bed within the next three hours.\"\n\n\"A point of success,\" Ihjel said. \"You agree with the general\nargument. Now I apply it specifically to you. Here is the statement\nI intend to prove. There exists a planet with a population of seven\nmillion people. Unless I can prevent it, this planet will be\ncompletely destroyed. It is my job to stop that destruction, so that\nis where I am going now. I won't be able to do the job alone. In\naddition to others, I need you. Not anyone like you--but you, and\nyou alone.\"\n\n\"You have precious little time left to convince me of all that,\"\nBrion told him, \"so let me make the job easier for you. The work you\ndo, this planet, the imminent danger of the people there--these are\nall facts that you can undoubtedly supply. I'll take a chance that\nthis whole thing is not a colossal bluff, and admit that given time,\nyou could verify them all. This brings the argument back to me\nagain. How can you possibly prove that I am the only person in the\ngalaxy who can help you?\"\n\n\"I can prove it by your singular ability, the thing I came here to\nfind.\"\n\n\"Ability? I am different in no way from the other men on my planet.\"\n\n\"You're wrong,\" Ihjel said. \"You are the embodied proof of\nevolution. Rare individuals with specific talents occur constantly\nin any species, man included. It has been two generations since an\nempathetic was last born on Anvhar, and I have been watching\ncarefully most of that time.\"\n\n\"What in blazes is an empathetic--and how do you recognize it when\nyou have found it?\" Brion chuckled, this talk was getting\npreposterous.\n\n\"I can recognize one because I'm one myself--there is no other way.\nAs to how projective empathy works, you had a demonstration of that\na little earlier, when you felt those strange thoughts about Anvhar.\nIt will be a long time before you can master that, but receptive\nempathy is your natural trait. This is mentally entering into the\nfeeling, or what could be called the spirit of another person.\nEmpathy is not thought perception; it might better be described\nas the sensing of someone else's emotional makeup, feelings and\nattitudes. You can't lie to a trained empathetic, because he can\nsense the real attitude behind the verbal lies. Even your\nundeveloped talent has proved immensely useful in the Twenties.\nYou can outguess your opponent because you know his movements\neven as his body tenses to make them. You accept this without\never questioning it.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\" This was Brion's understood, but never voiced secret.\n\nIhjel smiled. \"Just guessing. But I won the Twenties too, remember,\nalso without knowing a thing about empathy at the time. On top of\nour normal training, it's a wonderful trait to have. Which brings me\nto the proof we mentioned a minute ago. When you said you would be\nconvinced if I could prove you were the only person who could help\nme. I _believe_ you are--and that is one thing I cannot lie about.\nIt's possible to lie about a belief verbally, to have a falsely\nbased belief, or to change a belief. But you can't lie about it to\nyourself.\n\n\"Equally important--you can't lie about a belief to an empathetic.\nWould you like to see how I feel about this? 'See' is a bad\nword--there is no vocabulary yet for this kind of thing. Better,\nwould you join me in my feelings? Sense my attitudes, memories and\nemotions just as I do?\"\n\nBrion tried to protest, but he was too late. The doors of his senses\nwere pushed wide and he was overwhelmed.\n\n\"Dis ...\" Ihjel said aloud. \"Seven million people ... hydrogen bombs\n... Brion Brandd.\" These were just key words, landmarks of\nassociation. With each one Brion felt the rushing wave of the other\nman's emotions.\n\nThere could be no lies here--Ihjel was right in that. This was the\nraw stuff that feelings are made of, the basic reactions to the\nthings and symbols of memory.\n\nDIS ... DIS ...

Across from him Ihjel sat with his face\nbowed in his hands. When he lifted his head Brion saw within his\neyes a shadow of the blackness he had just experienced.\n\n\"Death,\" Brion said. \"That terrible feeling of death. It wasn't just\nthe people of Dis who would die. It was something more personal.\"\n\n\"Myself,\" Ihjel said, and behind this simple word were the repeated\nechoes of night that Brion had been made aware of with his newly\nrecognized ability. \"My own death, not too far away. This is the\nwonderfully terrible price you must pay for your talent. _Angst_ is\nan inescapable part of empathy. It is a part of the whole unknown\nfield of psi phenomena that seems to be independent of time. Death\nis so traumatic and final that it reverberates back along the time\nline. The closer I get, the more aware of it I am. There is no exact\nfeeling of date, just a rough location in time. That is the horror\nof it. I _know_ I will die soon after I get to Dis--and long before\nthe work there is finished. I know the job to be done there, and I\nknow the men who have already failed at it. I also know you are the\nonly person who can possibly complete the work I have started. Do\nyou agree now? Will you come with me?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course,\" Brion said. \"I'll go with you.\"\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\n\"I've never seen anyone quite as angry as that doctor,\" Brion said.\n\n\"Can't blame him.\" Ihjel shifted his immense weight and grunted from\nthe console, where he was having a coded conversation with the\nship's brain. He hit the keys quickly, and read the answer from the\nscreen. \"You took away his medical moment of glory. How many times\nin his life will he have a chance to nurse back to rugged smiling\nhealth the triumphantly exhausted Winner of the Twenties?\"\n\n\"Not many, I imagine. The wonder of it is how you managed to\nconvince him that you and the ship here could take care of me\nas well as his hospital could.\"\n\n\"I could never convince him of that,\" Ihjel said. \"But I and the\nCultural Relationships Foundation have some powerful friends on\nAnvhar. I'm forced to admit I brought a little pressure to bear.\"\nHe leaned back and read the course tape as it streamed out of the\nprinter. \"We have a little time to spare, but I would rather spend\nit waiting at the other end. We'll blast as soon as I have you tied\ndown in a stasis field.\"\n\nThe completeness of the stasis field leaves no impressions on the\nbody or mind. In it there is no weight, no pressure, no pain--no\nsensation of any kind. Except for a stasis of very long duration,\nthere is no sensation of time. To Brion's consciousness, Ihjel\nflipped the switch off with a continuation of the same motion that\nhad turned it on. The ship was unchanged, only outside of the port\nwas the red-shot blankness of jump-space.\n\n\"How do you feel?\" Ihjel asked.\n\nApparently the ship was wondering the same thing. Its detector unit,\nhovering impatiently just outside of Brion's stasis field, darted\ndown and settled on his bare forearm. The doctor back on Anvhar had\ngiven the medical section of the ship's brain a complete briefing.\nA quick check of a dozen factors of Brion's metabolism was compared\nto the expected norm. Apparently everything was going well, because\nthe only reaction was the expected injection of vitamins and glucose.\n\n\"I can't say I'm feeling wonderful yet,\" Brion answered, levering\nhimself higher on the pillows. \"But every day it's a bit\nbetter--steady progress.\"\n\n\"I hope so, because we have about two weeks before we get to Dis.\nDo you think you'll be back in shape by that time?\"\n\n\"No promises,\" Brion said, giving a tentative squeeze to one bicep.\n\"It should be enough time, though. Tomorrow I start mild exercise\nand that will tighten me up again. Now--tell me more about Dis and\nwhat you have to do there.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to do it twice, so just save your curiosity awhile.\nWe're heading for a rendezvous point now to pick up another\noperator. This is going to be a three-man team, you, me and an\nexobiologist. As soon as he is aboard I'll do a complete briefing\nfor you both at the same time. What you can do now is get your head\ninto the language box and start working on your Disan. You'll want\nto speak it perfectly by the time we touchdown.\"\n\nWith an autohypno for complete recall, Brion had no difficulty in\nmastering the grammar and vocabulary of Disan. Pronunciation was\na different matter altogether. Almost all the word endings were\nswallowed, muffled or gargled. The language was rich in glottal\nstops, clicks and guttural strangling sounds. Ihjel stayed in a\ndifferent part of the ship when Brion used the voice mirror and\nanalysis scope, claiming that the awful noises interfered with\nhis digestion.\n\nTheir ship angled through jump-space along its calculated course. It\nkept its fragile human cargo warm, fed them and supplied breathable\nair. It had orders to worry about Brion's health, so it did,\nchecking constantly against its recorded instructions and noting\nhis steady progress. Another part of the ship's brain counted\nmicroseconds with moronic fixation, finally closing a relay when\na predetermined number had expired in its heart. A light flashed\nand a buzzer hummed gently but insistently.\n\nIhjel yawned, put away the report he had been reading, and started\nfor the control room. He shuddered when he passed the room where\nBrion was listening to a playback of his Disan efforts.\n\n\"Turn off that dying brontosaurus and get strapped in,\" he called\nthrough the thin door. \"We're coming to the point of optimum\npossibility and we'll be dropping back into normal space soon.\"\n\nThe human mind can ponder the incredible distances between the\nstars, but cannot possibly contain within itself a real\nunderstanding of them. Marked out on a man's hand an inch is a large\nunit of measure. In interstellar space a cubical area with sides\na hundred thousand miles long is a microscopically fine division.\nLight crosses this distance in a fraction of a second. To a ship\nmoving with a relative speed far greater than that of light, this\nmeasuring unit is even smaller. Theoretically, it appears impossible\nto find a particular area of this size. Technologically, it was a\nrepeatable miracle that occurred too often to even be interesting.\n\nBrion and Ihjel were strapped in when the jump-drive cut off\nabruptly, lurching them back into normal space and time. They didn't\nunstrap, but just sat and looked at the dimly distant pattern of\nstars. A single sun, apparently of fifth magnitude, was their only\nneighbor in this lost corner of the universe. They waited while the\ncomputer took enough star sights to triangulate a position in three\ndimensions, muttering to itself electronically while it did the\ncountless calculations to find their position. A warning bell chimed\nand the drive cut on and off so quickly that the two acts seemed\nsimultaneous. This happened again, twice, before the brain was\nsatisfied it had made as good a fix as possible and flashed a\nNAVIGATION POWER OFF light. Ihjel unstrapped, stretched, and made\nthem a meal.\n\nIhjel had computed their passage time with precise allowances. Less\nthan ten hours after they arrived a powerful signal blasted into\ntheir waiting receiver. They strapped in again as the NAVIGATION\nPOWER ON signal blinked insistently.\n\nA ship had paused in flight somewhere relatively near in the vast\nvolume of space. It had entered normal space just long enough to\nemit a signal of radio query on an assigned wave length. Ihjel's\nship had detected this and instantly responded with a verifying\nsignal. The passenger spacer had accepted this assurance and\ngracefully laid a ten-foot metal egg in space. As soon as this had\ncleared its jump field the parent ship vanished towards its\ndestination, light years away.\n\nIhjel's ship climbed up the signal it had received. This signal had\nbeen recorded and examined minutely. Angle, strength and Doppler\nmovement were computed to find course and distance. A few minutes of\nflight were enough to get within range of the far weaker transmitter\nin the drop-capsule. Homing on this signal was so simple, a human\npilot could have done it himself. The shining sphere loomed up, then\nvanished out of sight of the viewports as the ship rotated to bring\nthe spacelock into line. Magnetic clamps cut in when they made\ncontact.\n\n\"Go down and let the bug-doctor in,\" Ihjel said. \"I'll stay and\nmonitor the board in case of trouble.\"\n\n\"What do I have to do?\"\n\n\"Get into a suit and open the outer lock. Most of the drop sphere is\nmade of inflatable metallic foil, so don't bother to look for the\nentrance. Just cut a hole in it with the oversize can-opener you'll\nfind in the tool box. After Dr. Morees gets aboard jettison the\nthing. Only get the radio and locator unit out first--it gets used\nagain.\"\n\nThe tool did look like a giant can-opener. Brion carefully felt the\nresilient metal skin that covered the lock entrance, until he was\nsure there was nothing on the other side. Then he jabbed the point\nthrough and cut a ragged hole in the thin foil. Dr. Morees boiled\nout of the sphere, knocking Brion aside.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" Brion asked.\n\nThere was no radio on the other's suit; he couldn't answer. But he\ndid shake his fist angrily. The helmet ports were opaque, so there\nwas no way to tell what expressions went with the gesture. Brion\nshrugged and turned back to salvaging the equipment pack, pushing\nthe punctured balloon free and sealing the lock. When pressure was\npumped back to ship-normal, he cracked his helmet and motioned the\nother to do the same.\n\n\"You're a pack of dirty lying dogs!\" Dr. Morees said when the helmet\ncame off. Brion was completely baffled. Dr. Lea Morees had long dark\nhair, large eyes, and a delicately shaped mouth now taut with anger.\nDr. Morees was a woman.\n\n\"Are you the filthy swine responsible for this atrocity?\" Dr. Morees\nasked menacingly.\n\n\"In the control room,\" Brion said quickly, knowing when cowardice\nwas preferable to valor. \"A man named Ihjel. There's a lot of him\nto hate, you can have a good time doing it. I just joined up\nmyself....\" He was talking to her back as she stormed from the room.\nBrion hurried after her, not wanting to miss the first human spark\nof interest in the trip to date.\n\n\"Kidnapped! Lied to, and forced against my will! There is no court\nin the galaxy that won't give you the maximum sentence, and I'll\nscream with pleasure as they roll your fat body into solitary--\"\n\n\"They shouldn't have sent a woman,\" Ihjel said, completely ignoring\nher words. \"I asked for a highly qualified exobiologist for a\ndifficult assignment. Someone young and tough enough to do field\nwork under severe conditions. So the recruiting office sends me the\nsmallest female they can find, one who'll melt in the first rain.\"\n\n\"I will not!\" Lea shouted. \"Female resiliency is a well-known fact,\nand I'm in far better condition than the average woman. Which has\nnothing to do with what I'm telling you. I was hired for a job in\nthe university on Moller's World and signed a contract to that\neffect. Then this bully of an agent tells me the contract has been\nchanged--read subparagraph 189-C or some such nonsense--and I'll be\ntranshipping. He stuffed me into that suffocating basketball without\na by-your-leave and they threw me overboard. If that is not a\nviolation of personal privacy--\"\n\n\"Cut a new course, Brion,\" Ihjel broke in. \"Find the nearest settled\nplanet and head us there. We have to drop this woman and find a man\nfor this job. We are going to what is undoubtedly the most\ninteresting planet an exobiologist ever conceived of, but we need\na man who can take orders and not faint when it gets too hot.\"\n\nBrion was lost. Ihjel had done all the navigating and Brion had no\nidea how to begin a search like this.\n\n\"Oh, no you don't,\" Lea said. \"You don't get rid of me that easily.\nI placed first in my class, and most of the five hundred other\nstudents were male. This is only a man's universe because the men\nsay so. What is the name of this garden planet where we are going?\"\n\n\"Dis. I'll give you a briefing as soon as I get this ship on\ncourse.\" He turned to the controls and Lea slipped out of her suit\nand went into the lavatory to comb her hair. Brion closed his mouth,\naware suddenly it had been open for a long time. \"Is that what you\ncall applied psychology?\" he asked.\n\n\"Not really. She was going to go along with the job in the\nend--since she did sign the contract even if she didn't read the\nfine print--but not until she had exhausted her feelings. I just\nshortened the process by switching her onto the male-superiority\nhate. Most women who succeed in normally masculine fields have a\nreflexive antipathy there; they have been hit on the head with it\nso much.\"\n\nHe fed the course tape into the console and scowled. \"But there was\na good chunk of truth in what I said. I wanted a young, fit and\nhighly qualified biologist from recruiting. I never thought they\nwould find a female one--and it's too late to send her back now.\nDis is no place for a woman.\"\n\n\"Why?\" Brion asked, as Lea appeared in the doorway.\n\n\"Come inside, and I'll show you both,\" Ihjel said.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\n\"Dis,\" Ihjel said, consulting a thick file, \"third planet out from\nits primary, Epsilon Eridani. The fourth planet is Nyjord--remember\nthat, because it is going to be very important. Dis is a place you\nneed a good reason to visit and no reason at all to leave. Too hot,\ntoo dry; the temperature in the temperate zones rarely drops below\na hundred Fahrenheit. The planet is nothing but scorched rock and\nburning sand. Most of the water is underground and normally\ninaccessible. The surface water is all in the form of briny,\nchemically saturated swamps--undrinkable without extensive\nprocessing. All the facts and figures are here in the folder and\nyou can study them later. Right now I want you just to get the idea\nthat this planet is as loathsome and inhospitable as they come. So\nare the people. This is a solido of a Disan.\"\n\nLea gasped at the three-dimensional representation on the screen.\nNot at the physical aspects of the man; as a biologist trained in\nthe specialty of alien life she had seen a lot stranger sights.\nIt was the man's pose, the expression on his face--tensed to leap,\nhis lips drawn back to show all of this teeth.\n\n\"He looks as if he wanted to kill the photographer,\" she said.\n\n\"He almost did--just after the picture was taken. Like all Disans,\nhe has an overwhelming hatred and loathing of offworlders. Not\nwithout good reason, though. His planet was settled completely by\nchance during the Breakdown. I'm not sure of the details, but the\noverall picture is clear, since the story of their desertion forms\nthe basis of all the myths and animistic religions on Dis.\n\n\"Apparently there were large-scale mining operations carried on\nthere once; the world is rich enough in minerals and mining them\nis very simple. But water came only from expensive extraction\nprocesses and I imagine most of the food came from offworld. Which\nwas good enough until the settlement was forgotten, the way a lot\nof other planets were during the Breakdown. All the records were\ndestroyed in the fighting, and the ore carriers were pressed into\nmilitary service. Dis was on its own. What happened to the people\nthere is a tribute to the adaptation possibilities of homo sapiens.\nIndividuals died, usually in enormous pain, but the race lived.\nChanged a good deal, but still human. As the water and food ran out\nand the extraction machinery broke down, they must have made heroic\nefforts to survive. They couldn't do it mechanically, but by the\ntime the last machine collapsed, enough people were adjusted to\nthe environment to keep the race going.\n\n\"Their descendants are still there, completely adapted to the\nenvironment. Their body temperatures are around a hundred and thirty\ndegrees. They have specialized tissue in the gluteal area for\nstoring water. These are minor changes, compared to the major ones\nthey have done in fitting themselves for this planet. I don't know\nthe exact details, but the reports are very enthusiastic about\nsymbiotic relationships. They assure us that this is the first time\nhomo sapiens has been an active part of either commensalism or\ninquilinism other than in the role of host.\"\n\n\"Wonderful!\" Lea exclaimed.\n\n\"Is it?\" Ihjel scowled. \"Perhaps from the abstract scientific point\nof view. If you can keep notes perhaps you might write a book about\nit some time. But I'm not interested. I'm sure all these\nmorphological changes and disgusting intimacies will fascinate you,\nDr. Morees. But while you are counting blood types and admiring your\nthermometers, I hope you will be able to devote a little time to a\nstudy of the Disans' obnoxious personalities. We must either find\nout what makes these people tick--or we are going to have to stand\nby and watch the whole lot blown up!\"\n\n\"Going to do what!\" Lea gasped. \"Destroy them? Wipe out this\nfascinating genetic pool? Why?\n\n\"Because they are so incredibly loathsome, that's why!\" Ihjel said.\n\"These aboriginal hotheads have managed to lay their hands on some\nprimitive cobalt bombs. They want to light the fuse and drop these\nbombs on Nyjord, the next planet. Nothing said or done can convince\nthem differently. They demand unconditional surrender, or else. This\nis impossible for a lot of reasons--most important, because the\nNyjorders would like to keep their planet for their very own. They\nhave tried every kind of compromise but none of them works. The\nDisans are out to commit racial suicide. A Nyjord fleet is now over\nDis and the deadline has almost expired for the surrender of the\ncobalt bombs. The Nyjord ships carry enough H-bombs to turn the\nentire planet into an atomic pile. That is what we must stop.\"\n\nBrion looked at the solido on the screen, trying to make some\njudgment of the man. Bare, horny feet. A bulky, ragged length of\ncloth around the waist was the only garment. What looked like a\npiece of green vine was hooked over one shoulder. From a plaited\nbelt were suspended a number of odd devices made of hand-beaten\nmetal, drilled stone and looped leather. The only recognizable item\nwas a thin knife of unusual design. Loops of piping, flared bells,\ncarved stones tied in senseless patterns of thonging gave the rest\nof the collection a bizarre appearance. Perhaps they had some\nreligious significance. But the well-worn and handled look of most\nof them gave Brion an uneasy sensation. If they were used--what in\nthe universe could they be used _for_?\n\n\"I can't believe it,\" he finally concluded. \"Except for the exotic\nhardware, this lowbrow looks as if he has sunk back into the Stone\nAge. I don't see how his kind can be any real threat to another\nplanet.\"\n\n\"The Nyjorders believe it, and that's good enough for me,\" Ihjel\nsaid. \"They are paying our Cultural Relationships Foundation a good\nsum to try and prevent this war. Since they are our employers, we\nmust do what they ask.\" Brion ignored this large lie, since it was\nobviously designed as an explanation for Lea. But he made a mental\nnote to query Ihjel later about the real situation.\n\n\"Here are the tech reports.\" Ihjel dropped them on the table. \"Dis\nhas some spacers as well as the cobalt bombs--though these aren't\nthe real threat. A tramp trader was picked up _leaving_ Dis. It had\ndelivered a jump-space launcher that can drop those bombs on Nyjord\nwhile anchored to the bedrock of Dis. While essentially a peaceful\nand happy people, the Nyjorders were justifiably annoyed at this and\nconvinced the tramp's captain to give them some more information.\nIt's all here. Boiled down, it gives a minimum deadline by which\ntime the launcher can be set up and start throwing bombs.\"\n\n\"When is that deadline?\" Lea asked.\n\n\"In ten more days. If the situation hasn't been changed drastically\nby then, the Nyjorders are going to wipe all life from the face of\nDis. I assure you they don't want to do it. But they will drop the\nbombs in order to assure their own survival.\"\n\n\"What am I supposed to do?\" Lea asked, flipping the pages of the\nreport. \"I don't know a thing about nucleonics or jump-space. I'm\nan exobiologist, with a supplementary degree in anthropology. What\nhelp could I possibly be?\"\n\nIhjel looked down at her, stroking his jaw, fingers sunk deep into\nthe rolls of flesh. \"My faith in our recruiters is restored,\" he\nsaid. \"That's a combination that is probably rare--even on Earth.\nYou're as scrawny as an underfed chicken, but young enough to\nsurvive if we keep a close eye on you.\" He cut off Lea's angry\nprotest with a raised hand. \"No more bickering. There isn't time.\nThe Nyjorders must have lost over thirty agents trying to find the\nbombs. Our foundation has had six people killed--including my late\npredecessor in charge of the project. He was a good man, but I think\nhe went at this problem the wrong way. I think it is a cultural one,\nnot a physical one.\"\n\n\"Run it through again with the power turned up,\" Lea said, frowning.\n\"All I hear is static.\"\n\n\"It's the old problem of genesis. Like Newton and the falling apple,\nLevy and the hysteresis in the warp field. Everything has a\nbeginning. If we can find out why these people are so hell-bent on\nsuicide we might be able to change the reasons. Not that I intend\nto stop looking for the bombs or the jump-space generator either.\nWe are going to try anything that will avert this planetary murder.\"\n\n\"You're a lot brighter than you look,\" Lea said, rising and\ncarefully stacking the sheets of the report. \"You can count on me\nfor complete cooperation. Now I'll study all this in bed if one of\nyou overweight gentlemen will show me to a room with a strong lock\non the inside of the door. Don't call me; I'll call you when I want\nbreakfast.\"\n\nBrion wasn't sure how much of her barbed speech was humor and how\nmuch was serious, so he said nothing. He showed her to an empty\ncabin--she did lock the door--then looked for Ihjel. The Winner was\nin the galley adding to his girth with an immense gelatin dessert\nthat filled a good-sized tureen.\n\n\"Is she short for a native Terran?\" Brion asked. \"The top of her\nhead is below my chin.\"\n\n\"That's the norm. Earth is a reservoir of tired genes. Weak backs,\nvermiform appendixes, bad eyes. If they didn't have the universities\nand the trained people we need I would never use them.\"\n\n\"Why did you lie to her about the Foundation?\"\n\n\"Because it's a secret--isn't that reason enough?\" Ihjel rumbled\nangrily, scraping the last dregs from the bowl. \"Better eat\nsomething. Build up the strength. The Foundation has to maintain its\nundercover status if it is going to accomplish anything. If she\nreturns to Earth after this it's better that she should know nothing\nof our real work. If she joins up, there'll be time enough to tell\nher. But I doubt if she will like the way we operate. Particularly\nsince I plan to drop some H-bombs on Dis myself--if we can't turn\noff the war.\"\n\n\"I don't believe it!\"\n\n\"You heard me correctly. Don't bulge your eyes and look moronic.\nAs a last resort I'll drop the bombs myself rather than let the\nNyjorders do it. That might save them.\"\n\n\"Save them--they'd all be radiated and dead!\" Brion's voice rose\nin anger.\n\n\"Not the Disans. I want to save the Nyjorders. Stop clenching your\nfists and sit down and have some of this cake. It's delicious. The\nNyjorders are all that counts here. They have a planet blessed by\nthe laws of chance. When Dis was cut off from outside contact, the\nsurvivors turned into a gang of swampcrawling homicidals. It did the\nopposite for Nyjord. You can survive there just by pulling fruit off\na tree. The population was small, educated, intelligent. Instead of\nsinking into an eternal siesta they matured into a vitally different\nsociety. Not mechanical--they weren't even using the wheel when they\nwere rediscovered. They became sort of cultural specialists, digging\ndeep into the philosophical aspects of interrelationship--the thing\nthat machine societies never have had time for. Of course this was\nready-made for the Cultural Relationships Foundation, and we have\nbeen working with them ever since. Not guiding so much as protecting\nthem from any blows that might destroy this growing idea. But we've\nfallen down on the job. Nonviolence is essential to these\npeople--they have vitality without needing destruction. But if they\nare forced to blow up Dis for their own survival--against every one\nof their basic tenets--their philosophy won't endure. Physically\nthey'll live on, as just one more dog-eat-dog planet with an A-bomb\nfor any of the competition who drop behind.\"\n\n\"Sounds like paradise now.\"\n\n\"Don't be smug. It's just another worldful of people with the same\nold likes, dislikes and hatreds. But they are evolving a way of\nliving together, without violence, that may some day form the key to\nmankind's survival. They are worth looking after. Now get below and\nstudy your Disan and read the reports. Get it all pat before we\nland.\"\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\n\"Identify yourself, please.\" The quiet words from the speaker in no\nway appeared to coincide with the picture on the screen. The spacer\nthat had matched their orbit over Dis had recently been a freighter.\nA quick conversion had tacked the hulking shape of a primary weapons\nturret on top of her hull. The black disc of the immense muzzle\npointed squarely at them. Ihjel switched open the ship-to-ship\ncommunication channel.\n\n\"This is Ihjel. Retinal pattern 490-BJ4-67--which is also the code\nthat is supposed to get me through your blockade. Do you want to\ncheck that pattern?\"\n\n\"There will be no need, thank you. If you will turn on your recorder\nI have a message relayed to you from Prime-four.\"\n\n\"Recording and out,\" Ihjel said. \"Damn! Trouble already, and four\ndays to blowup. Prime-four is our headquarters on Dis. This ship\ncarries a cover cargo so we can land at the spaceport. This is\nprobably a change of plan and I don't like the smell of it.\"\n\nThere was something behind Ihjel's grumbling this time, and without\nconscious effort Brion could sense the chilling touch of the other\nman's _angst_. Trouble was waiting for them on the planet below.\nWhen the message was typed by the decoder Ihjel hovered over it,\nreading each word as it appeared on the paper. When it was finished\nhe only snorted and went below to the galley. Brion pulled the\nmessage out of the machine and read it.\n\n     IHJEL IHJEL IHJEL SPACEPORT LANDING DANGER NIGHT\n     LANDING PREFERABLE COORDINATES MAP 46 J92 MN75\n     REMOTE YOUR SHIP VION WILL MEET END END END\n\nDropping into the darkness was safe enough. It was done on\ninstruments, and the Disans were thought to have no detection\napparatus. The altimeter dials spun backwards to zero and a soft\nvibration was the only indication they had landed. All of the cabin\nlights were off except for the fluorescent glow of the instruments.\nA white-speckled grey filled the infra-red screen, radiation from\nthe still warm sand and stone. There were no moving blips on it,\nnot the characteristic shape of a shielded atomic generator.\n\n\"We're here first,\" Ihjel said, opaqueing the ports and turning on\nthe cabin lights. They blinked at each other, faces damp with\nperspiration.\n\n\"Must you have the ship this hot?\" Lea asked, patting her forehead\nwith an already sodden kerchief. Stripped of her heavier clothing,\nshe looked even tinier to Brion. But the thin cloth tunic--reaching\nbarely halfway to her knees--concealed very little. Small she may\nhave appeared to him: unfeminine she was not. Her breasts were full\nand high, her waist tiny enough to offset the outward curve of her\nhips.\n\n\"Shall I turn around so you can stare at the back too?\" she asked\nBrion. Five days' experience had taught him that this type of remark\nwas best ignored. It only became worse if he tried to make an\nintelligent answer.\n\n\"Dis is hotter than this cabin,\" he said, changing the subject.\n\"By raising the interior temperature we can at least prevent any\nsudden shock when we go out--\"\n\n\"I know the theory--but it doesn't stop me from sweating,\" she said\ncurtly.\n\n\"Best thing you can do is sweat.\" Ihjel said. He looked like a\nglistening captive balloon in shorts. Finishing a bottle of beer,\nhe took another from the freezer. \"Have a beer.\"\n\n\"No, thank you. I'm afraid it would dissolve the last shreds of\ntissue and my kidneys would float completely away. On Earth we\nnever--\"\n\n\"Get Professor Morees' luggage for her,\" Ihjel interrupted. \"Vion's\ncoming, there's his signal. I'm sending this ship up before any of\nthe locals spot it.\"\n\nWhen he cracked the outer port the puff of air struck them like the\nexhaust from a furnace, dry and hot as a tongue of flame. Brion\nheard Lea's gasp in the darkness. She stumbled down the ramp and he\nfollowed her slowly, careful of the weight of packs and equipment he\ncarried. The sand, still hot from the day, burned through his boots.\nIhjel came last, the remote-control unit in his hand. As soon as\nthey were clear he activated it and the ramp slipped back like a\ngiant tongue. As soon as the lock had swung shut, the ship lifted\nand drifted upwards silently towards its orbit, a shrinking darkness\nagainst the stars.\n\nThere was just enough starlight to see the sandy wastes around them,\nas wave-filled as a petrified sea. The dark shape of a sand car drew\nup over a dune and hummed to a stop. When the door opened Ihjel\nstepped towards it and everything happened at once.\n\nIhjel broke into a blue nimbus of crackling flame, his skin\nblackening, charred. He was dead in an instant. A second pillar of\nflame bloomed next to the car, and a choking scream was cut off at\nthe moment it began. Ihjel died silently.\n\nBrion was diving even as the electrical discharges still crackled in\nthe air. The boxes and packs dropped from him and he slammed against\nLea, knocking her to the ground. He hoped she had the sense to stay\nthere and be quiet. This was his only conscious thought, the rest\nwas reflex. He was rolling over and over as fast as he could.\n\nThe spitting electrical flames flared again, playing over the\nbundles of luggage he had dropped. This time Brion was expecting it,\npressed flat on the ground a short distance away. He was facing the\ndarkness away from the sand car and saw the brief, blue glow of the\nion-rifle discharge. His own gun was in his hand. When Ihjel had\ngiven him the missile weapon he had asked no questions, but had just\nstrapped it on. There had been no thought that he would need it this\nquickly. Holding it firmly before him in both hands, he let his\nbody aim at the spot where the glow had been. A whiplash of\nexplosive slugs ripped the night air. They found their target and\nsomething thrashed voicelessly and died.\n\nIn the brief instant after he fired, a jarring weight landed on his\nback and a line of fire circled his throat. Normally he fought with\na calm mind, with no thoughts other than of the contest. But Ihjel,\na friend, a man of Anvhar, had died a few seconds before, and Brion\nfound himself welcoming this physical violence and pain.\n\nThere are many foolish and dangerous things that can be done, such\nas smoking next to high-octane fuel and putting fingers into\nelectrical sockets. Just as dangerous, and equally deadly, is\nphysically attacking a Winner of the Twenties.\n\nTwo men hit Brion together, though this made very little difference.\nThe first died suddenly as hands like steel claws found his neck and\nin a single spasmodic contraction did such damage to the large blood\nvessels there that they burst and tiny hemorrhages filled his brain.\nThe second man had time for a single scream, though he died just as\nswiftly when those hands closed on his larynx.\n\nRunning in a crouch, partially on his knuckles, Brion swiftly made\na circle of the area, gun ready. There were no others. Only when\nhe touched the softness of Lea's body did the blood anger seep from\nhim. He was suddenly aware of the pain and fatigue, the sweat\nsoaking his body and the breath rasping in his throat. Holstering\nthe gun, he ran light fingers over her skull, finding a bruised spot\non one temple. Her chest was rising and falling regularly. She had\nstruck her head when he pushed her. It had undoubtedly saved her\nlife.\n\nSitting down suddenly, he let his body relax, breathing deeply.\nEverything was a little better now, except for the pain at his\nthroat. His fingers found a thin strand on the side of his neck with\na knobby weight on the end. There was another weight on his other\nshoulder and a thin line of pain across his neck. When he pulled on\nthem both, the strangler's cord came away in his hand. It was thin\nfiber, strong as a wire. When it had been pulled around his neck it\nhad sliced the surface skin and flesh like a knife, halted only by\nthe corded bands of muscle below. Brion threw it from him, into the\ndarkness where it had come from.\n\nHe could think again, and he carefully kept his thoughts from the\nmen he had killed. Knowing it was useless, he went to Ihjel's body.\nA single touch of the scorched flesh was enough. Behind him Lea\nmoaned with returning consciousness and he hurried on to the sand\ncar, stepping over the charred body outside the door. The driver\nslumped, dead, killed perhaps by the same strangling cord that had\nsunk into Brion's throat. He laid the man gently on the sand and\nclosed the lids over the staring horror of the eyes. There was a\ncanteen in the car and he brought it back to Lea.\n\n\"My head--I've hurt my head,\" she said groggily.\n\n\"Just a bruise,\" he reassured her. \"Drink some of this water and\nyou'll soon feel better. Lie back. Everything's over for the moment\nand you can rest.\"\n\n\"Ihjel's dead!\" Lea said with sudden shocked memory. \"They've killed\nhim! What's happened?\" she tensed, tried to rise, and he pressed her\nback gently.\n\n\"I'll tell you everything. Just don't try to get up yet. There was\nan ambush and they killed Vion and the driver of the sand car, as\nwell as Ihjel. Three men did it and they're all dead now too. I\ndon't think there are any more around, but if there are I'll hear\nthem coming. We're just going to wait a few minutes until you feel\nbetter, then we're getting out of here in the car.\"\n\n\"Bring the ship down!\" There was a thin note of hysteria in her\nvoice. \"We can't stay here alone. We don't know where to go or what\nto do. With Ihjel dead, the whole thing's spoiled. We have to get\nout....\"\n\nThere are some things that can't sound gentle, no matter how gently\nthey are said. This was one of them. \"I'm sorry, Lea, but the ship\nis out of our reach right now. Ihjel was killed with an ion gun and\nit fused the control unit into a solid lump. We must take the car\nand get to the city. We'll do it now. See if you can stand up--I'll\nhelp you.\"\n\nShe rose, not saying anything, and as they walked towards the car\na single, reddish moon cleared the hills behind them. In its light\nBrion saw a dark line bisecting the rear panel of the sand car. He\nstopped abruptly. \"What's the matter?\" Lea asked.\n\nThe unlocked engine cover could have only one significance and he\npushed it open, knowing in advance what he would see. The attackers\nhad been very thorough and fast. In the short time available to them\nthey had killed the driver and the car as well. Ruddy light shone on\ntorn wires, ripped out connections. Repair would be impossible.\n\n\"I think we'll have to walk,\" he told her, trying to keep the gloom\nout of his voice. \"This spot is roughly a hundred and fifty\nkilometres from the city of Hovedstad, where we have to go.\nWe should be able to--\"\n\n\"We're going to die. We can't walk anywhere. This whole planet is a\ndeath trap. Let's get back in the ship!\" The shrillness of hysteria\nwas at the edge of her voice, as well as a subtle slurring of\nsounds.\n\nBrion didn't try to reason with her or bother to explain. She had a\nconcussion from the blow, that much was obvious. He had her sit and\nrest while he made what preparations he could for the long walk.\n\nClothing first. With each passing minute the desert air was growing\ncolder as the day's heat ebbed away. Lea was beginning to shiver,\nand he took some heavier clothing from her charred bag and made her\npull it on over her light tunic. There was little else that was\nworth carrying--the canteen from the car and a first-aid kit he\nfound in one of the compartments. There were no maps and no radio.\nNavigation was obviously done by compass on this almost featureless\ndesert. The car was equipped with an electrically operated\ngyrocompass, of no use to him now. But he did use it to check the\ndirection of Hovedstad, as he remembered it from the map, and found\nit lined up perfectly with the tracks the car had cut into the\nsand. It had come directly from the city. They could find their way\nby back-tracking.\n\nTime was slipping away. He would have liked to bury Ihjel and the\nmen from the car, but the night hours were too valuable to be\nwasted. The best he could do was put the three corpses in the car,\nfor protection from the Disan animals. He locked the door and threw\nthe key as far as he could into the blackness. Lea had slipped into\na restless sleep and he carefully shook her awake.\n\n\"Come,\" Brion said. \"We have a little walking to do.\"\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nWith the cool air and firmly packed sand under foot, walking should\nhave been easy. Lea spoiled that. The concussion seemed to have\ntemporarily cut off the reasoning part of her brain, leaving a\ndirect connection to her vocal cords. As she stumbled along, only\nhalf conscious, she mumbled all of her darkest fears that were\nbetter left unvoiced. Occasionally there was relevancy in her\ncomplaints. They would lose their way, never find the city, die of\nthirst, freezing, heat or hunger. Interspersed and entwined with\nthese were fears from her past that still floated, submerged in the\ntimeless ocean of her subconscious. Some Brion could understand,\nthough he tried not to listen. Fears of losing credits, not getting\nthe highest grade, falling behind, a woman alone in a world of men,\nleaving school, being lost, trampled among the nameless hordes that\nstruggled for survival in the crowded city-states of Earth.\n\nThere were other things she was afraid of that made no sense to a\nman of Anvhar. Who were the alkians that seemed to trouble her? Or\nwhat was canceri? Daydle and haydle? Who was Manstan, whose name\nkept coming up, over and over, each time accompanied by a little\nmoan?\n\nBrion stopped and picked her up in both arms. With a sigh she\nsettled against the hard width of his chest and was instantly\nasleep. Even with the additional weight he made better time now, and\nhe stretched to his fastest, kilometre-consuming stride to make good\nuse of these best hours.\n\nSomewhere on a stretch of gravel and shelving rock he lost the track\nof the sand car. He wasted no time looking for it. By carefully\nwatching the glistening stars rise and set he had made a good\nestimate of the geographic north. Dis didn't seem to have a pole\nstar; however, a boxlike constellation turned slowly around the\ninvisible point of the pole. Keeping this positioned in line with\nhis right shoulder guided him on the westerly course he needed.\n\nWhen his arms began to grow tired he lowered Lea gently to the\nground; she didn't wake. Stretching for an instant, before taking up\nhis burden again, Brion was struck by the terrible loneliness of the\ndesert. His breath made a vanishing mist against the stars; all else\nwas darkness and silence. How distant he was from his home, his\npeople, his planet! Even the constellations of the night sky were\ndifferent. He was used to solitude, but this was a loneliness that\ntouched some deep-buried instinct. A shiver that wasn't from the\ndesert cold touched lightly along his spine, prickling at the hairs\non his neck.\n\nIt was time to go on. He shrugged the disquieting sensations off and\ncarefully tied Lea into the jacket he had been wearing. Slung like a\npack on his back, it made the walking easier. The gravel gave way to\nsliding dunes of sand that seemed to continue to infinity. It was a\npainful, slipping climb to the top of each one, then an equally\ndifficult descent to the black-pooled hollow at the foot of the\nnext.\n\nWith the first lightening of the sky in the east he stopped, breath\nrasping in his chest, to mark his direction before the stars faded.\nOne line scratched in the sand pointed due north, a second pointed\nout the course they should follow. When they were aligned to his\nsatisfaction he washed his mouth out with a single swallow of water\nand sat on the sand next to the still form of the girl.\n\nGold fingers of fire searched across the sky, wiping out the stars.\nIt was magnificent; Brion forgot his fatigue in appreciation. There\nshould be some way of preserving it. A quatrain would be best. Short\nenough to be remembered, yet requiring attention and skill to\ncompact everything into it. He had scored high with his quatrains in\nthe Twenties. This would be a special one. Taind, his poetry mentor,\nwould have to get a copy.\n\n\"What are you mumbling about?\" Lea asked, looking up at the craggy\nblackness of his profile against the reddening sky.\n\n\"Poem,\" he said. \"Shhh. Just a minute.\"\n\nIt was too much for Lea, coming after the tension and dangers of the\nnight. She began to laugh, laughing even harder when he scowled at\nher. Only when she heard the tinge of growing hysteria did she make\nan attempt to break off the laughter. The sun cleared the horizon,\nwashing a sudden warmth over them. Lea gasped.\n\n\"Your throat's been cut! You're bleeding to death!\"\n\n\"Not really,\" he said, touching his fingertips lightly against the\nblood-clotted wound that circled his neck. \"Just superficial.\"\n\nDepression sat on him as he suddenly remembered the battle and death\nof the previous night. Lea didn't notice his face; she was busy\ndigging in the pack he had thrown down. He had to use his fingers to\nmassage and force away the grimace of pain that twisted his mouth.\nMemory was more painful than the wound. How easily he had killed!\nThree men. How close to the surface of the civilized man the animal\ndwelled! In countless matches he had used those holds, always\ndrawing back from the exertion of the full killing power. They were\npart of a game, part of the Twenties. Yet when his friend had been\nkilled he had become a killer himself. He believed in nonviolence\nand the sanctity of life--until the first test, when he had killed\nwithout hesitation. More ironic was the fact he really felt no\nguilt, even now. Shock at the change, yes. But no more than that.\n\n\"Lift your chin,\" Lea said, brandishing the antiseptic applicator\nshe had found in the medicine kit. He lifted his chin obligingly and\nthe liquid drew a cool, burning line across his neck. Antibio pills\nwould do a lot more good, since the wound was completely clotted by\nnow, but he didn't speak his thoughts aloud. For the moment Lea had\nforgotten herself in taking care of him. He put some of the\nantiseptic on her scalp bruise and she squeaked, pulling back.\nThey both swallowed the pills.\n\n\"That sun is hot already,\" Lea said, peeling off her heavy\nclothing. \"Let's find a nice cool cave or an air-cooled saloon\nto crawl into for the day.\"\n\n\"I don't think there are any here. Just sand. We have to walk--\"\n\n\"I know we have to walk,\" she interrupted. \"There's no need for a\nlecture about it. You're as seriously cubical as the Bank of Terra.\nRelax. Count ten and start again.\" Lea was making empty talk while\nshe listened to the memory of hysteria tittering at the fringes of\nher brain.\n\n\"No time for that. We have to keep going.\" Brion climbed slowly to\nhis feet after stowing everything in the pack. When he sighted along\nhis marker at the western horizon he saw nothing to mark their\ncourse, only the marching dunes. He helped Lea to her feet and began\nwalking slowly towards them.\n\n\"Just hold on a second,\" Lea called after him. \"Where do you think\nyou're going?\"\n\n\"In that direction,\" he said, pointing. \"I hoped there would be\nsome landmarks, but there aren't. We'll have to keep on by dead\nreckoning. The sun will keep us pretty well on course. If we aren't\nthere by night the stars will be a better guide.\"\n\n\"All this on an empty stomach? How about breakfast? I'm hungry--and\nthirsty.\"\n\n\"No food.\" He shook the canteen that gurgled emptily. It had been\nonly partly filled when he found it. \"The water's low and we'll need\nit later.\"\n\n\"I need it now,\" she said shortly. \"My mouth tastes like an\nunemptied ashtray and I'm dry as paper.\"\n\n\"Just a single swallow,\" he said after the briefest hesitation.\n\"This is all we have.\"\n\nLea sipped at it with her eyes closed in appreciation. Then he\nsealed the top and returned it to the pack without taking any\nhimself. They were sweating as they started up the first dune.\n\nThe desert was barren of life; they were the only things moving\nunder that merciless sun. Their shadows pointed the way ahead of\nthem, and as the shadows shortened the heat rose. It had an\nintensity Lea had never experienced before, a physical weight that\npushed at her with a searing hand. Her clothing was sodden with\nperspiration, and it trickled burning into her eyes. The light and\nheat made it hard to see, and she leaned on the immovable strength\nof Brion's arm. He walked on steadily, apparently ignoring the heat\nand discomfort.\n\n\"I wonder if those things are edible--or store water?\" Brion's voice\nwas a harsh rasp. Lea blinked and squinted at the leathery shape on\nthe summit of the dune. Plant or animal, it was hard to tell. It was\nthe size of a man's head, wrinkled and grey as dried-out leather,\nknobbed with thick spikes. Brion pushed it up with his toe and they\nhad a brief glimpse of a white roundness, like a shiny taproot,\ngoing down into the dune. Then the thing contracted, pulling itself\nlower into the sand. At the same instant something thin and sharp\nlashed out through a fold in the skin, striking at Brion's boot and\nwithdrawing. There was a scratch on the hard plastic, beaded with\ndrops of green liquid.\n\n\"Probably poison,\" he said, digging his toe into the sand. \"This\nthing is too mean to fool with--without a good reason. Let's keep\ngoing.\"\n\nIt was before noon when Lea fell down. She really wanted to go on,\nbut her body wouldn't obey. The thin soles of her shoes were no\nprotection against the burning sand and her feet were lumps of raw\npain. Heat hammered down, poured up from the sand and swirled her in\nan oven of pain. The air she gasped in was molten metal that dried\nand cracked her mouth. Each pulse of her heart throbbed blood to the\nwound in her scalp until it seemed her skull would burst with the\nagony. She had stripped down to the short tunic--in spite of Brion's\ninsistence that she keep her body protected from the sun--and that\nclung to her, soaked with sweat. She tore at it in a desperate\neffort to breathe. There was no escape from the unending heat.\n\nThough the baked sand burned torture into her knees and hands,\nshe couldn't rise. It took all her strength not to fall further.\nHer eyes closed and everything swirled in immense circles.\n\nBrion, blinking through slitted eyes, saw her go down. He lifted\nher, and carried her again as he had the night before. The hot touch\nof her body shocked his bare arms. Her skin was flushed pink. The\ntunic was torn open and one pointed breast rose and fell unevenly\nwith the irregularity of her breathing. Wiping his palm free of\nsweat and sand, he touched her skin and felt the ominous hot\ndryness.\n\nHeat-shock, all the symptoms. Dry, flushed skin, the ragged\nbreathing. Her temperature rising quickly as her body stopped\nfighting the heat and succumbed.\n\nThere was nothing he could do here to protect her from the heat. He\nmeasured a tiny portion of the remaining water into her mouth and\nshe swallowed convulsively. Her thin clothing was little protection\nfrom the sun. He could only take her in his arms and keep on towards\nthe horizon. An outcropping of rock threw a tiny patch of shade and\nhe walked towards it.\n\nThe ground here, shielded from the direct rays of the sun, felt\nalmost cool by contrast. Lea opened her eyes when he put her down,\npeering up at him through a haze of pain. She wanted to apologize to\nhim for her weakness, but no words came from the dried membrane of\nher throat. His body above her seemed to swim back and forth in the\nheat waves, swaying like a tree in a high wind.\n\nShock drove her eyes open, cleared her mind for an instant. He\nreally was swaying. Suddenly she realized how much she had come to\ndepend on the unending solidity of his strength--and now it was\nfailing. All over his body the corded muscles contracted in ridges,\nstriving to keep him erect. She saw his mouth pulled open by the\ntaut cords of his neck, and the gaping, silent scream was more\nterrible than any sound. Then she herself screamed as his eyes\nrolled back, leaving only the empty white of the eyeballs staring\nterribly at her. He went over, back, down, like a felled tree,\nthudding heavily on the sand. Unconscious or dead, she couldn't\ntell. She pulled limply at his leg, but couldn't drag his immense\nweight into the shade.\n\nBrion lay on his back in the sun, sweating. Lea saw this and knew\nthat he was still alive. Yet what was happening? She groped for\nmemory in the red haze of her mind, but could remember nothing from\nher medical studies that would explain this. On every square inch of\nhis body the sweat glands seethed with sudden activity. From every\npore oozed great globules of oily liquid, far thicker than normal\nperspiration. Brion's arms rippled with motion and Lea gaped,\nhorrified as the hairs there writhed and stirred as though endowed\nwith separate life. His chest rose and fell rapidly, deep, gasping\nbreaths racking his body. Lea could only stare through the dim\nredness of unreality and wonder if she was going mad before she\ndied.\n\nA coughing fit broke the rhythm of his rasping breath, and when it\nwas over his breathing was easier. The perspiration still covered\nhis body, the individual beads touching and forming tiny streams\nthat trickled down his body and vanished in the sand. He stirred and\nrolled onto his side, facing her. His eyes were open and normal now\nas he smiled.\n\n\"Didn't mean to frighten you. It caught me suddenly coming at the\nwrong season and everything. It was a bit of a jar to my system.\nI'll get you some water now--there's still a bit left.\"\n\n\"What happened? When you looked like that, when you fell....\"\n\n\"Take two swallows, no more,\" he said, holding the open canteen to\nher mouth. \"Just summer change, that's all. It happens to us every\nyear on Anvhar--only not that violently, of course. In the winter\nour bodies store a layer of fat under the skin for insulation, and\nsweating almost ceases completely. There are a lot of internal\nchanges too. When the weather warms up the process is reversed. The\nfat is metabolized and the sweat glands enlarge and begin working\novertime as the body prepares for two months of hard work, heat and\nlittle sleep. I guess the heat here triggered off the summer change\nearly.\"\n\n\"You mean--you've adapted to this terrible planet?\"\n\n\"Just about. Though it does feel a little warm. I'll need a lot\nmore water soon, so we can't remain here. Do you think you can stand\nthe sun if I carry you?\"\n\n\"No, but I won't feel any better staying here.\" She was\nlight-headed, scarcely aware of what she said. \"Keep going, I guess.\nKeep going.\"\n\nAs soon as she was out of the shadow of the rock the sunlight burst\nover her again in a wave of hot pain. She fell unconscious at once.\nBrion picked her up and staggered forward. After a few yards, he\nbegan to feel the pull of the sand. He knew he was reaching the end\nof his strength. He went more slowly and each dune seemed a bit\nhigher than the one before. Giant, sand-scoured rocks pushed through\nthe dunes here and he had to stumble around them. At the base of\nthe largest of these monoliths was a straggling clump of knotted\nvegetation. He passed it by--then stopped as something tried to\npenetrate his heat-crazed mind. What was it? A difference. Something\nabout these plants that he hadn't noticed in any of the others\nhe had passed during the day.\n\nIt was almost like defeat to turn and push his clumsy feet backwards\nin his own footprints; to stand blinking helplessly at the plants.\nYet they were important. Some of them had been cut off close to the\nsand. Not broken by any natural cause, but cut sharply and squarely\nby a knife or blade of some sort. The cut plants were long dried and\ndead, but a tiny hope flared up in him. This was the first sign that\nother people were actually alive on this heat-blasted planet. And\nwhatever the plants had been cut for, they might be of aid to him.\nFood--perhaps drink. His hands trembled at the thought as he dropped\nLea heavily into the shade of the rock. She didn't stir.\n\nHis knife was sharp, but most of the strength was gone from his\nhands. Breath rasping in his dried throat, he sawed at the tough\nstem, finally cutting it through. Raising up the shrub, he saw\na thick liquid dripping from the severed end. He braced his hand\nagainst his leg, so it wouldn't shake and spill, until his cupped\npalm was full of sap.\n\nIt was wet, even a little cool as it evaporated. Surely it was\nmostly life-giving water. He had a moment's misgiving as he raised\nit to his lips, and instead of drinking it merely touched it with\nthe tip of his tongue.\n\nAt first nothing--then a searing pain. It stabbed deep into his\nthroat and choked him. His stomach heaved and he vomited bitter\nbile. On his knees, fighting the waves of pain, he lost body fluid\nhe vitally needed.\n\nDespair was worse than the pain. The plant juice must have some use;\nthere must be a way of purifying it or neutralizing it. But Brion,\na stranger on this planet, would be dead long before he found out\nhow to do this.\n\nWeakened by the cramps that still tore at him, he tried not to\nrealize how close to the end he was. Getting the girl on his back\nseemed an impossible task, and for an instant he was tempted to\nleave her there. Yet even as he considered this he shouldered her\nleaden weight and once more went on. Each footstep an effort, he\nfollowed his own track up the dune. Painfully he forced his way\nto the top, and looked at the Disan standing a few feet away.\n\nThey were both too surprised by the sudden encounter to react at\nonce. For a breath of time they stared at each other, unmoving. When\nthey reacted it was the same defense of fear. Brion dropped the\ngirl, bringing the gun up from the holster in the return of the same\nmotion. The Disan jerked a belled tube from his waistband and raised\nit to his mouth.\n\nBrion didn't fire. A dead man had taught him how to train his\nempathetic sense, and to trust it. In spite of the fear that wanted\nhim to jerk the trigger, a different sense read the unvoiced\nemotions of the native Disan. There was fear there, and hatred.\nWelling up around these was a strong desire not to commit violence,\nthis time, to communicate instead. Brion felt and recognized all\nthis in a fraction of a second. He had to act instantly to avoid a\ntragic happening. A jerk of his wrist threw the gun to one side.\n\nAs soon as it was gone he regretted its loss. He was gambling their\nlives on an ability he still was not sure of. The Disan had the\ntube to his mouth when the gun hit the ground. He held the pose,\nunmoving, thinking. Then he accepted Brion's action and thrust the\ntube back into his waistband.\n\n\"Do you have any water?\" Brion asked, the guttural Disan words\nhurting his throat.\n\n\"I have water,\" the man said. He still didn't move. \"Who are you?\nWhat are you doing here?\"\n\n\"We're from offplanet. We had ... an accident. We want to go\nto the city. The water.\"\n\nThe Disan looked at the unconscious girl and made his decision. Over\none shoulder he wore one of the green objects that Brion remembered\nfrom the solido. He pulled it off and the thing writhed slowly in\nhis hands. It was alive--a green length a metre long, like a noduled\nsection of a thick vine. One end flared out into a petal-like\nformation. The Disan took a hook-shaped object from his waist and\nthrust it into the petaled orifice. When he turned the hook in a\nquick motion the length of green writhed and curled around his arm.\nHe pulled something small and dark out and threw it to the ground,\nextending the twisting green shape towards Brion. \"Put your mouth to\nthe end and drink,\" he said.\n\nLea needed the water more, but he drank first, suspicious of the\nliving water source. A hollow below the writhing petals was filling\nwith straw-colored water from the fibrous, reedy interior. He raised\nit to his mouth and drank. The water was hot and tasted swampy.\nSudden sharp pains around his mouth made him jerk the thing away.\nTiny glistening white barbs projected from the petals pink-tipped\nnow with his blood. Brion swung towards the Disan angrily--and\nstopped when he looked at the other man's face. His mouth was\nsurrounded by many small white scars.\n\n\"The _vaede_ does not like to give up its water, but it always\ndoes,\" the man said.\n\nBrion drank again, then put the vaede to Lea's mouth. She moaned\nwithout regaining consciousness, her lips seeking reflexively for\nthe life-saving liquid. When she was satisfied Brion gently drew the\nbarbs from her flesh and drank again. The Disan hunkered down on\nhis heels and watched them expressionlessly. Brion handed back the\nvaede, then held some of the clothes so that Lea was in their shade.\nHe settled to the same position as the native and looked closely\nat him.\n\nSquatting immobile on his heels, the Disan appeared perfectly\ncomfortable under the flaming sun. There was no trace of\nperspiration on his naked, browned skin. Long hair fell to his\nshoulders, and startlingly blue eyes stared back at Brion from\ndeepset sockets. The heavy kilt around his loins was the only\ngarment he wore. Once more the vaede rested over his shoulder, still\nstirring unhappily. Around his waist was the same collection of\nleather, stone and brass objects that had been in the solido. Two of\nthem now had meaning to Brion: the tube-and-mouthpiece, a blowgun of\nsome kind; and the specially shaped hook for opening the vaede. He\nwondered if the other strangely formed things had equally practical\nfunctions. If you accepted them as artifacts with a purpose--not\nbarbaric decorations--you had to accept their owner as something\nmore than the crude savage he resembled.\n\n\"My name is Brion. And you--\"\n\n\"You may not have my name. Why are you here? To kill my people?\"\n\nBrion forced away the memory of last night. Killing was just what he\nhad done. Some expectancy in the man's manner, some sensed feeling\nof hope prompted Brion to speak the truth.\n\n\"I'm here to stop your people from being killed. I believe in the\nend of the war.\"\n\n\"Prove it.\"\n\n\"Take me to the Cultural Relationships Foundations in the city and\nI'll prove it. I can do nothing here in the desert. Except die.\"\n\nFor the first time there was emotion on the Disan's face. He frowned\nand muttered something to himself. There was a fine beading of sweat\nabove his eyebrows now as he fought an internal battle. Coming to a\ndecision, he rose, and Brion stood too.\n\n\"Come with me. I'll take you to Hovedstad. But first you will tell\nme--are you from Nyjord?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nThe nameless Disan merely grunted and turned away. Brion shouldered\nLea's unconscious body and followed him. They walked for two hours,\nthe Disan setting a cruel pace, before they reached a wasteland of\njumbled rock. The native pointed to the highest tower of sand-eroded\nstone. \"Wait near this,\" he said. \"Someone will come for you.\" He\nwatched while Brion placed the girl's still body in the shade, and\npassed over the vaede for the last time. Just before leaving he\nturned back, hesitating.\n\n\"My name is ... Ulv,\" he said. Then he was gone.\n\nBrion did what he could to make Lea comfortable, but it was very\nlittle. If she didn't get medical attention soon she would be dead.\nDehydration and shock were uniting to destroy her.\n\nJust before sunset he heard clanking, and the throbbing whine of\na sand car's engine coming from the west.\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\nWith each second the noise grew louder, coming their way. The tracks\nsqueaked as the car turned around the rock spire, obviously seeking\nthem out. A large carrier, big as a truck, it stopped before them in\na cloud of its own dust and the driver kicked the door open.\n\n\"Get in here--and fast!\" the man shouted. \"You're letting in all the\nheat.\" He gunned the engine, ready to kick in the gears, and looked\nat them irritatedly.\n\nIgnoring the driver's nervous instructions, Brion carefully placed\nLea on the rear seat before he pulled the door shut. The car surged\nforward instantly, a blast of icy air pouring from the air-cooling\nvents. It wasn't cold in the vehicle--but the temperature was at\nleast forty degrees lower than the outer air. Brion covered Lea with\nall their extra clothing to prevent any further shock to her system.\nThe driver, hunched over the wheel and driving with an intense\nspeed, hadn't said a word to them since they had entered.\n\nBrion looked up as another man stepped from the engine compartment\nin the rear of the car. He was thin, harried-looking. And he was\npointing a gun.\n\n\"Who are you?\" he said, without a trace of warmth in his voice.\n\nIt was a strange reception, but Brion was beginning to realize that\nDis was a strange planet. The other man chewed at his lip nervously\nwhile Brion sat, relaxed and unmoving. He didn't want to startle him\ninto pulling the trigger, and he kept his voice pitched low as he\nanswered.\n\n\"My name is Brandd. We landed from space two nights ago and have\nbeen walking in the desert ever since. Now don't get excited and\nshoot the gun when I tell you this--but both Vion and Ihjel are\ndead.\"\n\nThe man with the gun gasped, his eyes widened. The driver threw a\nsingle frightened look over his shoulder, then turned quickly back\nto the wheel. Brion's probe had hit its mark. If these men weren't\nfrom the Cultural Relationships Foundation they at least knew a lot\nabout it. It seemed safe to assume they were C.R.F. men.\n\n\"When they were shot the girl and I escaped. We were trying to reach\nthe city and contact you. You are from the Foundation, aren't you?\"\n\n\"Yes. Of course,\" the man said, lowering the gun. He stared\nglassy-eyed into space for a moment, nervously working his teeth\nagainst his lip. Startled at his own inattention, he raised the gun\nagain.\n\n\"If you're Brandd, there's something I want to know.\" Rummaging\nin his breast pocket with his free hand, he brought out a yellow\nmessage form. He moved his lips as he reread the message. \"Now\nanswer me--if you can--what are the last three events in the ...\"\nHe took a quick look at the paper again. \"... in the Twenties?\"\n\n\"Chess finals, rifle prone position, and fencing playoffs. Why?\"\n\nThe man grunted and slid the pistol back into its holder, satisfied.\n\"I'm Faussel,\" he said, and waved the message at Brion. \"This is\nIhjel's last will and testament, relayed to us by the Nyjord\nblockade control. He thought he was going to die and he sure was\nright. Passed on his job to you. You're in charge. I was Mervv's\nsecond-in-command, until he was poisoned. I was supposed to work for\nIhjel, and now I guess I'm yours. At least until tomorrow, when\nwe'll have everything packed and get off this hell planet.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, tomorrow?\" Brion asked. \"It's three days to\ndeadline and we still have a job to do.\"\n\nFaussel had dropped heavily into one of the seats and he sprang to\nhis feet again, clutching the seat back to keep his balance in the\nswaying car.\n\n\"Three days, three weeks, three minutes--what difference does it\nmake?\" His voice rose shrilly with each word, and he had to make a\ndefinite effort to master himself before he could go on. \"Look. You\ndon't know anything about this. You just arrived and that's your bad\nluck. My bad luck is being assigned to this death trap and watching\nthe depraved and filthy things the natives do. And trying to be\npolite to them even when they are killing my friends, and those\nNyjord bombers up there with their hands on the triggers. One of\nthose bombardiers is going to start thinking about home and about\nthe cobalt bombs down here and he's going to press that button,\ndeadline or no deadline.\"\n\n\"Sit down, Faussel. Sit down and take a rest.\" There was sympathy in\nBrion's voice--but also the firmness of an order. Faussel swayed for\na second longer, then collapsed. He sat with his cheek against the\nwindow, eyes closed. A pulse throbbed visibly in his temple and his\nlips worked. He had been under too much tension for too long a time.\n\nThis was the atmosphere that hung heavily in the air at the C.R.F.\nbuilding when they arrived. Despair and defeat. The doctor was the\nonly one who didn't share this mood as he bustled Lea off to the\nclinic with prompt efficiency. He obviously had enough patients to\nkeep his mind occupied. With the others the feeling of depression\nwas unmistakable. From the instant they had driven through the\nautomatic garage door, Brion had swum in this miasma of defeat.\nIt was omnipresent and hard to ignore.\n\nAs soon as he had eaten he went with Faussel into what was to have\nbeen Ihjel's office. Through the transparent walls he could see the\nstaff packing the records, crating them for shipment. Faussel seemed\nless nervous now that he was no longer in command. Brion rejected\nany idea he had of letting the man know that he himself was only\na novice in the foundation. He was going to need all the authority\nhe could muster, since they would undoubtedly hate him for what he\nwas going to do.\n\n\"Better take notes of this, Faussel, and have it typed. I'll sign\nit.\" The printed word always carried more weight. \"All preparations\nfor leaving are to be stopped at once. Records are to be returned\nto the files. We are going to stay here just as long as we have\nclearance from the Nyjorders. If this operation is unsuccessful we\nwill all leave together when the time expires. We will take whatever\npersonal baggage we can carry by hand; everything else stays here.\nPerhaps you don't realize we are here to save a planet--not file\ncabinets full of papers.\"\n\nOut of the corner of his eye he saw Faussel flush with anger. \"As\nsoon as that is typed bring it back. And all the reports as to what\nhas been accomplished on this project. That will be all for now.\"\n\nFaussel stamped out, and a minute later Brion saw the shocked, angry\nlooks from the workers in the outer office. Turning his back to\nthem, he opened the drawers in the desk, one after another. The top\ndrawer was empty, except for a sealed envelope. It was addressed to\nWinner Ihjel.\n\nBrion looked at it thoughtfully, then ripped it open. The letter\ninside was handwritten.\n\n     _Ihjel:_\n\n     _I've had the official word that you are on the way\n     to relieve me and I am forced to admit I feel only\n     an intense satisfaction. You've had the experience on\n     these outlaw planets and can get along with the odd\n     types. I have been specializing in research for the\n     last twenty years, and the only reason I was appointed\n     planetary supervisor on Nyjord was because of the\n     observation and application facilities. I'm the\n     research type, not the office type; no one has ever\n     denied that._\n\n     _You're going to have trouble with the staff, so you\n     had better realize that they are all compulsory\n     volunteers. Half are clerical people from my staff.\n     The others a mixed bag of whoever was close enough to\n     be pulled in on this crash assignment. It developed so\n     fast we never saw it coming. And I'm afraid we've done\n     little or nothing to stop it. We can't get access to\n     the natives here, not in the slightest. It's\n     frightening! They don't fit! I've done Poisson\n     Distributions on a dozen different factors and none of\n     them can be equated. The Pareto Extrapolations don't\n     work. Our field men can't even talk to the natives and\n     two have been killed trying. The ruling class is\n     unapproachable and the rest just keep their mouths shut\n     and walk away._\n\n     _I'm going to take a chance and try to talk to\n     Lig-magte, perhaps I can make him see sense. I doubt\n     if it will work and there is a chance he will try\n     violence with me. The nobility here are very prone to\n     violence. If I get back all right you won't see this\n     note. Otherwise--good-by, Ihjel. Try to do a better job\n     than I did._\n                                          _Aston Mervv_\n\n     _P.S. There is a problem with the staff. They are\n     supposed to be saviors, but without exception they all\n     loathe the Disans. I'm afraid I do too._\n\nBrion ticked off the relevant points in the letter. He had to find\nsome way of discovering what Pareto Extrapolations were--without\nuncovering his own lack of knowledge. The staff would vanish in five\nminutes if they knew how new he was at the job. Poisson Distribution\nmade more sense. It was used in physics as the unchanging\nprobability of an event that would be true at all times. Such as\nthe numbers of particles that would be given off by a lump of\nradioactive matter during a short period. From the way Mervv used\nit in his letter it looked as if the societics people had found\nmeasurable applications in societies and groups. At least on other\nplanets. None of the rules seemed to be working on Dis. Ihjel had\nadmitted that, and Mervv's death had proven it. Brion wondered who\nthis Lig-magte was who appeared to have killed Mervv.\n\nA forged cough broke through Brion's concentration, and he realized\nthat Faussel had been standing in front of his desk for some\nminutes. Brion looked up and mopped perspiration from his face.\n\n\"Your air conditioner seems to be out of order,\" Faussel said.\n\"Should I have the mechanic look at it?\"\n\n\"There's nothing wrong with the machine; I'm just adapting to Dis's\nclimate. What else do you want, Faussel?\"\n\nThe assistant had a doubting look that he didn't succeed in hiding.\nHe also had trouble believing the literal truth. He placed the small\nstack of file folders on the desk.\n\n\"These are the reports to date, everything we have uncovered about\nthe Disans. It's not very much; but considering the anti-social\nattitudes on this lousy world it is the best we could do.\" A sudden\nthought hit him, and his eyes narrowed slyly. \"It can't be helped,\nbut some of the staff have been wondering out loud about that native\nthat contacted us. How did you get him to help you? We've never\ngotten to first base with these people, and as soon as you land you\nhave one working for you. You can't stop people from thinking about\nit, you being a newcomer and a stranger. After all, it looks a\nlittle odd--\" He broke off in midsentence as Brion looked at him\nin cold fury.\n\n\"I can't stop people from thinking about it--but I can stop them\nfrom talking. Our job is to contact the Disans and stop this\nsuicidal war. I have done more in one day than you all have done\nsince you arrived. I have accomplished this because I am better at\nmy work than the rest of you. That is all the information any of you\nare going to receive. You are dismissed.\"\n\nWhite with anger, Faussel turned on his heel and stamped out--to\nspread the word about what a slave-driver the new director was. They\nwould then all hate him passionately, which was just the way he\nwanted it. He couldn't risk exposure as the tyro he was. And perhaps\na new emotion, other than disgust and defeat, might jar them into a\nlittle action. They certainly couldn't do any worse than they had\nbeen doing.\n\nIt was a tremendous amount of responsibility. For the first time\nsince setting foot on this barbaric planet Brion had time to stop\nand think. He was taking an awful lot upon himself. He knew nothing\nabout this world, nor about the powers involved in the conflict.\nHere he sat pretending to be in charge of an organization he had\nfirst heard about only a few weeks earlier. It was a frightening\nsituation. Should he slide out from under?\n\nThere was just one possible answer, and that was _no_. Until he\nfound someone else who could do better, he seemed to be the one best\nsuited for the job. And Ihjel's opinion had to count for something.\nBrion had felt the surety of the man's conviction that Brion was\nthe only one who might possibly succeed in this difficult spot.\n\nLet it go at that. If he had any qualms it would be best to put them\nbehind him. Aside from everything else, there was a primary bit of\nloyalty involved. Ihjel had been an Anvharian and a Winner. Maybe it\nwas a provincial attitude to hold in this big universe--Anvhar was\ncertainly far enough away from here--but honor is very important to\na man who must stand alone. He had a debt to Ihjel, and he was going\nto pay it off.\n\nOnce the decision had been made, he felt easier. There was an\nintercom on the desk in front of him and he leaned with a heavy\nthumb on the button labeled _Faussel_.\n\n\"Yes?\" Even through the speaker the man's voice was cold with\nill-concealed hatred.\n\n\"Who is Lig-magte? And did the former director ever return from\nseeing him?\"\n\n\"Magte is a title that means roughly noble or lord. Lig-magte is the\nlocal overlord. He has an ugly stoneheap of a building just outside\nthe city. He seems to be the mouthpiece for the group of magter that\nare pushing this idiotic war. As to your second question, I have to\nanswer yes and no. We found Director Mervv's head outside the door\nnext morning with all the skin gone. We knew who it was because the\ndoctor identified the bridgework in his mouth. _Do you understand?_\"\n\nAll pretense of control had vanished, and Faussel almost shrieked\nthe last words. They were all close to cracking up, if he was any\nexample. Brion broke in quickly.\n\n\"That will be all, Faussel. Just get word to the doctor that I would\nlike to see him as soon as I can.\" He broke the connection and\nopened the first of the folders. By the time the doctor called he\nhad skimmed the reports and was reading the relevant ones in greater\ndetail. Putting on his warm coat, he went through the outer office.\nThe few workers still on duty turned their backs in frigid silence.\n\nDoctor Stine had a pink and shiny bald head that rose above a thick\nblack beard. Brion had liked him at once. Anyone with enough\nfirmness of mind to keep a beard in this climate was a pleasant\nexception after what he had met so far.\n\n\"How's the new patient, Doctor?\"\n\nStine combed his beard with stubby fingers before answering.\n\"Diagnosis: heat-syncope. Prognosis: complete recovery. Condition\nfair, considering the dehydration and extensive sunburn. I've\ntreated the burns, and a saline drip is taking care of the other.\nShe just missed going into heat-shock. I have her under sedation\nnow.\"\n\n\"I'd like to have her up and helping me tomorrow morning. Could she\ndo this--with stimulants or drugs?\"\n\n\"She could--but I don't like it. There might be side factors,\nperhaps long-standing debilitation. It's a chance.\"\n\n\"A chance we will have to take. In less than seventy hours this\nplanet is due for destruction. In attempting to avert that tragedy\nI'm expendable, as is everyone else here. Agreed?\"\n\nThe doctor grunted deep in his beard and looked Brion's immense\nframe up and down. \"Agreed,\" he said, almost happily. \"It is a\ndistinct pleasure to see something beside black defeat around here.\nI'll go along with you.\"\n\n\"Well, you can help me right now. I checked the personnel roster and\ndiscovered that out of the twenty-eight people working here there\nisn't a physical scientist of any kind--other than yourself.\"\n\n\"A scruffy bunch of button-pushers and theoreticians. Not worth a\ndamn for field work, the whole bunch of them!\" The doctor toed the\nfloor switch on a waste receptacle and spat into it with feeling.\n\n\"Then I'm going to depend on you for some straight answers,\" Brion\nsaid. \"This is an un-standard operation, and the standard techniques\njust don't begin to make sense. Even Poisson Distributions and\nPareto Extrapolations don't apply here.\" Stine nodded agreement and\nBrion relaxed a bit. He had just relieved himself of his entire\nknowledge of societics, and it had sounded authentic. \"The more I\nlook at it the more I believe that this is a physical problem,\nsomething to do with the exotic and massive adjustments the Disans\nhave made to this hellish environment. Could this tie up in any way\nwith their absolutely suicidal attitude towards the cobalt bombs?\"\n\n\"Could it? Could it?\" Dr. Stine paced the floor rapidly on his\nstocky legs, twining his fingers behind his back. \"You are bloody\nwell right it could. Someone is thinking at last and not just\npunching bloody numbers into a machine and sitting and scratching\nhis behind while waiting for the screen to light up with the\nanswers. Do you know how Disans exist?\" Brion shook his head. \"The\nfools here think it disgusting but I call it fascinating. They have\nfound ways to join a symbiotic relationship with the life forms on\nthis planet. Even a parasitic relationship. You must realize that\nliving organisms will do anything to survive. Castaways at sea will\ndrink their own urine in their need for water. Disgust at this is\nonly the attitude of the overprotected who have never experienced\nextreme thirst or hunger. Well, here on Dis you have a planet of\ncastaways.\"\n\nStine opened the door of the pharmacy. \"This talk of thirst makes me\ndry.\" With economically efficient motions he poured grain alcohol\ninto a beaker, thinned it with distilled water and flavored it with\nsome crystals from a bottle. He filled two glasses and handed Brion\none. It didn't taste bad at all.\n\n\"What do you mean by parasitic, Doctor? Aren't we all parasites of\nthe lower life forms? Meat animals, vegetables and such?\"\n\n\"No, no--you miss the point! I speak of parasitic in the exact\nmeaning of the word. You must realize that to a biologist there is\nno real difference between parasitism, symbiosis, mutualism,\nbiontergasy, commensalism--\"\n\n\"Stop, stop!\" Brion said. \"Those are just meaningless sounds to me.\nIf that is what makes this planet tick I'm beginning to see why the\nrest of the staff has that lost feeling.\"\n\n\"It is just a matter of degree of the same thing. Look. You have\na kind of crustacean living in the lakes here, very much like an\nordinary crab. It has large claws in which it holds anemones,\ntentacled sea animals with no power of motion. The crustacean waves\nthese around to gather food, and eats the pieces they capture that\nare too big for them. This is biontergasy, two creatures living and\nworking together, yet each capable of existing alone.\n\n\"Now, this same crustacean has a parasite living under its shell, a\ndegenerated form of a snail that has lost all powers of movement. A\ntrue parasite that takes food from its host's body and gives nothing\nin return. Inside this snail's gut there is a protozoan that lives\noff the snail's ingested food. Yet this little organism is not a\nparasite, as you might think at first, but a symbiote. It takes food\nfrom the snail, but at the same time it secretes a chemical that\naids the snail's digestion of the food. Do you get the picture?\nAll these life forms exist in a complicated interdependence.\"\n\nBrion frowned in concentration, sipping at the drink. \"It's making\nsome kind of sense now. Symbiosis, parasitism and all the rest are\njust ways of describing variations of the same basic process of\nliving together. And there is probably a grading and shading between\nsome of these that make the exact relationship hard to define.\"\n\n\"Precisely. Existence is so difficult on this world that the\ncompeting forms have almost died out. There are still a few left,\npreying off the others. It was the cooperating and interdependent\nlife forms that really won out in the race for survival. I say life\nforms with intent. The creatures here are mostly a mixture of plant\nand animal, like the lichens you have elsewhere. The Disans have a\ncreature they call a \"vaede\" that they use for water when traveling.\nIt has rudimentary powers of motion from its animal part, yet uses\nphotosynthesis and stores water like a plant. When the Disans drink\nfrom it the thing taps their blood streams for food elements.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Brion said wryly. \"I drank from one. You can see my scars.\nI'm beginning to comprehend how the Disans fit into the physical\npattern of their world, and I realize it must have all kinds of\npsychological effects on them. Do you think this has any effect on\ntheir social organization?\"\n\n\"An important one. But maybe I'm making too many suppositions now.\nPerhaps your researchers upstairs can tell you better; after all,\nthis is their field.\"\n\nBrion had studied the reports on the social setup and not one word\nof them made sense. They were a solid maze of unknown symbols and\ncryptic charts. \"Please continue, Doctor,\" he insisted. \"The\nsocietics reports are valueless so far. There are factors missing.\nYou are the only one I have talked to so far who can give me any\nintelligent reports or answers.\"\n\n\"All right then--be it on your own head. The way I see it, you've\ngot no society here at all, just a bunch of rugged individualists.\nEach one for himself, getting nourishment from the other life forms\nof the planet. If they have a society, it is orientated towards the\nrest of the planetary life--instead of towards other human beings.\nPerhaps that's why your figures don't make sense. They are set up\nfor the human societies. In their relations with each other, these\npeople are completely different.\"\n\n\"What about the magter, the upper-class types who build castles and\nare causing all this trouble?\"\n\n\"I have no explanation,\" Dr. Stine admitted. \"My theories hold water\nand seem logical enough up to this point. But the magter are the\nexception, and I have no idea why. They are completely different\nfrom the rest of the Disans. Argumentative, blood-thirsty, looking\nfor planetary conquest instead of peace. They aren't rulers, not in\nthe real sense. They hold power because nobody else wants it. They\ngrant mining concessions to offworlders because they are the only\nones with a sense of property. Maybe I'm going out on a limb. But\nif you can find out _why_ they are so different you may be onto\nthe clue to our difficulties.\"\n\nFor the first time since his arrival Brion began to feel a touch of\nenthusiasm. Plus a sense of the remote possibility that there might\neven be a solution to the deadly problem. He drained his glass and\nstood up.\n\n\"I hope you'll wake your patient early, Doctor. You might be as\ninterested in talking to her as I am. If what you told me is true,\nshe could well be our key to the answer. She is Professor Lea\nMorees, and she is just out from Earth with degrees in exobiology\nand anthropology, and has a head stuffed with vital facts.\"\n\n\"Wonderful!\" Stine said. \"I shall take care of the head, not only\nbecause it is so pretty but because of its knowledge. Though we\ntotter on the edge of atomic destruction I have a strange feeling\nof optimism--for the first time since I landed on this planet.\"\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\nThe guard inside the front entrance of the Foundation building\njumped at the thunderous noise and reached for his gun. He dropped\nhis hand sheepishly when he realized it was only a sneeze--though a\ngargantuan one. Brion came up, sniffling, huddling down into his\ncoat. \"I'm going out before I catch pneumonia,\" he said. The guard\nsaluted dumbly, and after checking his proximity detector screens he\nslipped out and the heavy portal thudded shut behind him. The street\nwas still warm from the heat of the day and he sighed happily and\nopened his coat.\n\nThis was partly a reconnaissance trip--and partly a way of getting\nwarmed up. There was little else he could do in the building; the\nstaff had long since retired. He had slept for a half an hour, and\nhad waked refreshed and ready to work. All of the reports he could\nunderstand had been read and reread until they were memorized. He\ncould use the time now, while the rest of them were asleep, to get\nbetter acquainted with the main city of Dis.\n\nAs he walked the dark streets he realized how alien the Disan way of\nlife was to everything he knew. This city--Hovedstad--literally\nmeant \"main place\" in the native language. And that's all it was. It\nwas only the presence of the offworlders that made it into a city.\nBuilding after building, standing deserted, bore the names of mining\ncompanies, traders, space transporters. None of them was occupied\nnow. Some still had lights burning, switched on by automatic\napparatus, others were as dark as the Disan structures. There\nweren't many of these native constructions and they seemed out of\nplace among the rammed earth and prefab offworld buildings. Brion\nexamined one that was dimly illuminated by the light on the corner\nof VEGAN SMELTERS, LTD.\n\nIt consisted of a single large room, resting right on the ground.\nThere were no windows, and the whole thing appeared to have been\nconstructed of some sort of woven material plastered with stone-hard\nmud. Nothing was blocking the door and he was thinking seriously of\ngoing in when he became aware that he was being followed.\n\nIt was only a slight noise, almost lost in the night. Normally it\nwould never have been noticed, but tonight Brion was listening with\nhis entire body. Someone was behind him, swallowed up in the pools\nof darkness. Brion shrank back against the wall. There was very\nlittle chance this could be anyone but a Disan. He had a sudden\nmemory of Mervv's severed head as it had been discovered outside the\ndoor.\n\nIhjel had helped him train his empathetic sense and he reached out\nwith it. It was difficult working in the dark; he could be sure of\nnothing. Was he getting a reaction--or just wishing for one? Why did\nit have a ring of familiarity to it? A sudden idea struck him.\n\n\"Ulv,\" he said, very softly. \"This is Brion.\" He crouched, ready\nfor any attack.\n\n\"I know,\" a voice said softly in the night. \"Do not talk. Walk\nin the direction you were going before.\"\n\nAsking questions now would accomplish nothing. Brion turned\ninstantly and did as he was bidden. The buildings grew further apart\nuntil he realized from the sand underfoot that he was back in the\nplanet-wide desert. It could be a trap--he hadn't recognized the\nvoice behind the whisper--yet he had to take this chance. A darker\nshape appeared in the dark night near him, and a burning hot hand\ntouched his arm lightly.\n\n\"I will walk ahead. Follow close behind me.\" The words were louder\nand this time Brion recognized the voice.\n\nWithout waiting for an answer, Ulv turned and his dimly seen shape\nvanished into the darkness. Brion moved swiftly after him, until\nthey walked side by side over the rolling hills of sand. The sand\nmerged into hard-baked ground, became cracked and scarred with\nrock-filled gulleys. They followed a deepening gulley that grew into\na good-sized ravine. When they turned an angle of the ravine Brion\nsaw a weak yellow light coming from an opening in the hard dirt\nwall.\n\nUlv dropped on all fours and vanished through the shoulder-wide\nhole. Brion followed him, trying to ignore the growing tension and\nunease he felt. Crawling like this, head down, he was terribly\nvulnerable. He tried to shrug off the feeling, mentally blaming it\non tense nerves.\n\nThe tunnel was short and opened into a larger chamber. A sudden\nscuffle of feet sounded at the same instant that a wave of\nempathetic hatred struck him. It took vital seconds to fight his way\nout of the trapping tunnel, to roll clear and bring his gun up.\nDuring those seconds he should have died. The Disan poised above him\nhad the short-handled stone hammer raised to strike a skull-crushing\nblow.\n\nUlv was clutching the man's wrist, fighting silently to keep the\nhammer from falling. Neither combatant said a word, the rasp of\ntheir calloused feet on the sand the only sound. Brion backed away\nfrom the struggling men, his gun centered on the stranger. The Disan\nfollowed him with burning eyes, and dropped the hammer as soon as it\nwas obvious the attack had failed.\n\n\"Why did you bring him here?\" he growled at Ulv. \"Why didn't you\nkill him?\"\n\n\"He is here so we can listen to what he says, Gebk. He is the one\nI told you of, that I found in the desert.\"\n\n\"We listen to what he says and then we kill him,\" Gebk said with a\nmirthless grin. The remark wasn't meant to be humorous, but was made\nin all seriousness. Brion recognized this and knew that there was no\ndanger for the present moment. He slid the gun away, and for the\nfirst time looked around the chamber.\n\nIt was domed in shape and was still hot from the heat of the day.\nUlv took off the length of cloth he had wrapped around his body\nagainst the chill, and refolded it as a kilt, strapping it on under\nhis belt artifacts. He grunted something unintelligible and when\na muttered answer came, Brion for the first time became aware of\nthe woman and the child.\n\nThe two sat against the far wall, squatting on either side of a heap\nof fibrous plants. Both were nude, clothed only in the matted hair\nthat fell below their shoulders. The belt of strange tools could not\nbe classified as clothing. Even the child wore a tiny replica of her\nmother's. Putting down a length of plant she had been chewing, the\nwoman shuffled over to the tiny fire that illuminated the room. A\nclay pot stood over it, and from this she ladled three bowls of food\nfor the men. It smelled atrocious, and Brion tried not to taste or\nsmell the sickening mixture while he ate it. He used his fingers, as\ndid the other men, and did not talk while he ate. There was no way\nto tell if the silence was ritual or habit. It gave him a chance for\na closer look at the Disan way of living.\n\nThe cave was obviously hand-made; tool marks could be clearly seen\nin the hard clay of the walls, except in the portion opposite the\nentrance. This was covered with a network of roots, rising out of\nthe floor and vanishing into the roof of earth above. Perhaps this\nwas the reason for the cave's existence. The thin roots had been\ncarefully twisted and plaited together until they formed a single\nswollen root in the center, as thick as a man's arm. From this hung\nfour of the vaedes: Ulv had placed his there before he sat down. The\nteeth must have instantly sunk in, for it hung unsupported--another\nlink in the Disan life cycle. This appeared to be the source of the\nvaede's water that nourished the people.\n\nBrion was aware of eyes upon him and turned and smiled at the little\ngirl. She couldn't have been over six years old, but she was already\na Disan in every way. She neither returned his smile nor changed her\nexpression, unchildlike in its stolidity. Her hands and jaw never\nstopped as she worked on the lengths of fibrous plant her mother had\nplaced before her. The child split them with a small tool and\nremoved a pod of some kind. This was peeled--partially by scraping\nwith a different tool, and partially by working between her teeth.\nIt took long minutes to remove the tough rind; the results seemed\nscarcely worth it. A tiny wriggling object was finally disclosed\nwhich the girl instantly swallowed. She then began working on the\nnext pod.\n\nUlv put down his clay bowl and belched. \"I brought you to the city\nas I told you I would,\" he said. \"Have you done as you said you\nwould?\"\n\n\"What did he promise?\" Gebk asked.\n\n\"That he would stop the war. Have you stopped it?\"\n\n\"I am trying to stop it,\" Brion said. \"But it is not that easy.\nI'll need some help. It is your life that needs saving--yours and\nyour families'. If you would help me--\"\n\n\"What is the truth?\" Ulv broke in savagely. \"All I hear is\ndifference, and there is no longer any way to tell truth. For as\nlong as always we have done as the magter say. We bring them food\nand they give us the metal and sometimes water when we need it. As\nlong as we do as they ask they do not kill us. They live the wrong\nway, but I have had bronze from them for my tools. They have told us\nthat they are getting a world for us from the sky people, and that\nis good.\"\n\n\"It has always been known that the sky people are evil in every way,\nand only good can come from killing them,\" Gebk said.\n\nBrion stared back at the two Disans and their obvious hatred. \"Then\nwhy didn't you kill me, Ulv?\" he asked. \"That first time in the\ndesert, or tonight when you stopped Gebk?\"\n\n\"I could have. But there was something more important. What is the truth?\nCan we believe as we have always done? Or should we listen to this?\"\n\nHe threw a small sheet of plastic to Brion, no bigger than the palm\nof his hand. A metal button was fastened to one corner of the wafer,\nand a simple drawing was imbedded in the wafer. Brion held it to the\nlight and saw a picture of a man's hand squeezing the button between\nthumb and forefinger. It was a subminiaturized playback; mechanical\npressure on the case provided enough current to play the recorded\nmessage. The plastic sheet vibrated, acting as a loudspeaker.\n\nThough the voice was thin and scratchy, the words were clearly\naudible. It was an appeal for the Disan people not to listen to the\nmagter. It explained that the magter had started a war that could\nhave only one ending--the destruction of Dis. Only if the magter\nwere thrown down and their weapons discovered could there be any\nhope.\n\n\"Are these words true?\" Ulv asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Brion said.\n\n\"They are perhaps true,\" Gebk said, \"but there is nothing that we\ncan do. I was with my brother when these word-things fell out of the\nsky and he listened to one and took it to the magter to ask them.\nThey killed him, as he should have known they would do. The magter\nkill us if they know we listen to the words.\"\n\n\"And the words tell us we will die if we listen to the magter!\" Ulv\nshouted, his voice cracking. Not with fear, but with frustration at\nthe attempt to reconcile two opposite points of view. Up until this\ntime his world had consisted of black and white values, with very\nfew shadings of difference in between.\n\n\"There are things you can do that will stop the war without hurting\nyourself or the magter,\" Brion said, searching for a way to enlist\ntheir aid.\n\n\"Tell us,\" Ulv grunted.\n\n\"There would be no war if the magter could be contacted, made to\nlisten to reason. They are killing you all. You could tell me how\nto talk to the magter, how I could understand them--\"\n\n\"No one can talk to the magter,\" the woman broke in. \"If you say\nsomething different they will kill you as they killed Gebk's\nbrother. So they are easy to understand. That is the way they are.\nThey do not change.\" She put the length of plant she had been\nsoftening for the child back into her mouth. Her lips were deeply\ngrooved and scarred from a lifetime of this work, her teeth at the\nsides worn almost to the bone.\n\n\"Mor is right,\" Ulv said. \"You do not talk to magter. What else is\nthere to do?\"\n\nBrion looked at the two men before he spoke, and shifted his weight.\nThe motion brought his fingertips just a few inches from his gun.\n\"The magter have bombs that will destroy Nyjord--this is the next\nplanet, a star in your sky. If I can find where the bombs are, I\nwill have them taken away and there will be no war.\"\n\n\"You want to aid the devils in the sky against our own people!\"\nGebk shouted, half rising. Ulv pulled him back to the ground,\nbut there was no more warmth in his voice as he spoke.\n\n\"You are asking too much. You will leave now.\"\n\n\"Will you help me, though? Will you help stop the war?\" Brion asked,\naware he had gone too far, but unable to stop. Their anger was\nmaking them forget the reasons for his being there.\n\n\"You ask too much,\" Ulv said again. \"Go back now. We will talk about it.\"\n\n\"Will I see you again? How can I reach you?\"\n\n\"We will find you if we wish to talk to you,\" was all Ulv said. If\nthey decided he was lying he would never see them again. There was\nnothing he could do about it.\n\n\"I have made up my mind,\" Gebk said, rising to his feet and drawing\nhis cloth up until it covered his shoulders. \"You are lying and this\nis all a lie of the sky people. If I see you again I will kill you.\"\nHe stepped to the tunnel and was gone.\n\nThere was nothing more to be said. Brion went out next--checking\ncarefully to be sure that Gebk really had left--and Ulv guided him\nto the spot where the lights of Hovedstad were visible. He did not\nspeak during their return journey and vanished without a word. Brion\nshivered in the night chill of the air and wrapped his coat more\ntightly around himself. Depressed, he walked back towards the warmer\nstreets of the city.\n\nIt was dawn when he reached the Foundation building; a new guard\nwas at the front entrance. No amount of hammering or threats could\nconvince the man to open until Faussel came down, yawning and\nblinking with sleep. He was starting some complaint when Brion cut\nhim off curtly and ordered him to finish dressing and report for\nwork at once. Still feeling elated, Brion hurried into his office\nand cursed the overly efficient character who had turned on his air\nconditioner to chill the room again. When he turned it off this time\nhe removed enough vital parts to keep it out of order for the\nduration.\n\nWhen Faussel came in he was still yawning behind his fist--obviously\na low morning-sugar type. \"Before you fall on your face, go out and\nget some coffee,\" Brion said. \"Two cups. I'll have a cup too.\"\n\n\"That won't be necessary,\" Faussel said, drawing himself up stiffly.\n\"I'll call the canteen if you wish some.\" He said it in the iciest\ntone he could manage this early in the morning.\n\nIn his enthusiasm Brion had forgotten the hate campaign he had\ndirected against himself. \"Suit yourself,\" he said shortly, getting\nback into the role. \"But the next time you yawn there'll be a\nnegative entry in your service record. If that's clear--you can\nbrief me on this organization's visible relations with the Disans.\nHow do they take us?\"\n\nFaussel choked and swallowed a yawn. \"I believe they look on the\nC.R.F. people as some species of simpleton, sir. They hate all\noffworlders; memory of their desertion has been passed on verbally\nfor generations. So by their one-to-one logic we should either hate\nback or go away. We stay instead. And give them food, water,\nmedicine and artifacts. Because of this they let us remain on\nsufferance. I imagine they consider us do-gooder idiots, and as long\nas we cause no trouble they'll let us stay.\" He was struggling\nmiserably to suppress a yawn, so Brion turned his back and gave him\na chance to get it out.\n\n\"What about the Nyjorders? How much do they know of our work?\" Brion\nlooked out the window at dusty buildings, outlined in purple against\nthe violent colors of the desert sunrise.\n\n\"Nyjord is a cooperating planet, and has full knowledge at all\nexecutive levels. They are giving us all the aid they can.\"\n\n\"Well, now is the time to ask for more. Can I contact the commander\nof the blockading fleet?\"\n\n\"There is a scrambler connection right through to him. I'll set it\nup.\" Faussel bent over the desk and punched a number into the phone\ncontrols. The screen flowed with the black and white patterns of the\nscrambler.\n\n\"That's all, Faussel,\" Brion said. \"I want privacy for this talk.\nWhat's the commander's name?\"\n\n\"Professor Krafft--he's a physicist. They have no military men at\nall, so they called him in for the construction of the bombs and\nenergy weapons. He's still in charge.\" Faussel yawned extravagantly\nas he went out the door.\n\nThe Professor-Commander was very old, with wispy grey hair and\na network of wrinkles surrounding his eyes. His image shimmered,\nthen cleared as the scrambler units aligned.\n\n\"You must be Brion Brandd,\" he said. \"I have to tell you how sorry\nwe all are that your friend Ihjel and the two others--had to die,\nafter coming so far to help us. I'm sure you are very happy to have\nhad a friend like that.\"\n\n\"Why ... yes, of course,\" Brion said, reaching for the scattered\nfragments of his thought processes. It took an effort to remember\nthe first conflict, now that he was worrying about the death of a\nplanet. \"It's very kind of you to mention it. But I would like to\nfind out a few things from you, if I could.\"\n\n\"Anything at all; we are at your disposal. Before we begin, though,\nI shall pass on the thanks of our council for your aid in joining\nus. Even if we are eventually forced to drop the bombs, we shall\nnever forget that your organization did everything possible to\navert the disaster.\"\n\nOnce again Brion was caught off balance. For an instant he wondered\nif Krafft was being insincere, then recognized the baseness of this\nthought. The completeness of the man's humanity was obvious and\ncompelling. The thought passed through Brion's mind that now he had\nan additional reason for wanting the war ended without destruction\non either side. He very much wanted to visit Nyjord and see these\npeople on their home grounds.\n\nProfessor Krafft waited, patiently and silently, while Brion pulled\nhis thoughts together and answered. \"I still hope that this thing\ncan be stopped in time. That's what I wanted to talk to you about.\nI want to see Lig-magte and I thought it would be better if I had\na legitimate reason. Are you in contact with him?\"\n\nKrafft shook his head. \"No, not really in contact. When this trouble\nstarted I sent him a transceiver so we could talk directly. But he\nhas delivered his ultimatum, speaking for the magter. The only terms\nhe will hear are unconditional surrender. His receiver is on, but\nhe has said that is the only message he will answer.\"\n\n\"Not much chance of him ever being told that,\" Brion said.\n\n\"There was--at one time. I hope you realize, Brion, that the\ndecision to bomb Dis was not easily arrived at. A great many\npeople--myself included--voted for unconditional surrender.\nWe lost the vote by a very small margin.\"\n\nBrion was getting used to these philosophical body blows and he\nrolled with the punches now. \"Are there any of your people left on\nthis planet? Or do you have any troops I can call on for help? This\nis still a remote possibility, but if I do find out where the bombs\nor the launchers are, a surprise raid would knock them out.\"\n\n\"We have no people left in Hovedstad now--all the ones who weren't\nevacuated were killed. But there are commando teams standing by here\nto make a landing if the weapons are detected. The Disans must\ndepend on secrecy to protect their armament, since we have both\nthe manpower and the technology to reach any objective. We also\nhave technicians and other volunteers looking for the weapon sites.\nThey have not been successful as yet, and most of them were killed\nsoon after landing.\"\n\nKrafft hesitated for a moment. \"There is another group you should\nknow about; you will need all the factors. Some of our people are in\nthe desert outside of Hovedstad. We do not officially approve of\nthem, though they have a good deal of popular support. They are\nmostly young men, operating as raiders, killing and destroying with\nvery little compunction. They are attempting to uncover the weapons\nby sheer strength of arms.\"\n\nThis was the best news yet. Brion controlled his voice and kept his\nexpression calm when he spoke. \"I don't know how far I can stretch\nyour cooperation--but could you possibly tell me how to get in touch\nwith them?\"\n\nKraft allowed himself a small smile. \"I'll give you the wave length\non which you can reach their radio. They call themselves the 'Nyjord\narmy.' When you talk to them you can do me a favor. Pass on a\nmessage. Just to prove things aren't bad enough, they've become\na little worse. One of our technical crews has detected jump-space\nenergy transmissions in the planetary crust. The Disans are\napparently testing their projector, sooner than we had estimated.\nOur deadline has been revised by one day. I'm afraid there are only\ntwo days left before you must evacuate.\" His eyes were large with\ncompassion. \"I'm sorry. I know this will make your job that much\nharder.\"\n\nBrion didn't want to think about the loss of a full day from his\nalready close deadline. \"Have you told the Disans this yet?\"\n\n\"No,\" Krafft told him. \"The decision was reached a few minutes\nbefore your call. It is going on the radio to Lig-magte now.\"\n\n\"Can you cancel the transmission and let me take the message in\nperson?\"\n\n\"I can do that.\" Krafft thought for a moment. \"But it would surely\nmean your death at their hands. They have no hesitation in killing\nany of our people. I would prefer to send it by radio.\"\n\n\"If you do that you will be interfering with my plans, and perhaps\ndestroying them under the guise of saving my life. Isn't my life\nmy own--to dispose of as I will?\"\n\nFor the first time Professor Krafft was upset. \"I'm sorry, terribly\nsorry. I'm letting my concern and worry wash over into my public\naffairs. Of course you may do as you please; I could never think of\nstopping you.\" He turned and said something inaudible offscreen.\n\"The call is cancelled. The responsibility is yours. All our wishes\nfor success go with you. End of transmission.\"\n\n\"End of transmission,\" Brion said, and the screen went dark.\n\n\"Faussel!\" he shouted into the intercom. \"Get me the best and\nfastest sand car we have, a driver who knows his way around, and two\nmen who can handle a gun and know how to take orders. We're going to\nget some positive action at last.\"\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\"It's suicide,\" the taller guard grumbled.\n\n\"Mine, not yours, so don't worry about it,\" Brion barked at him.\n\"Your job is to remember your orders and keep them straight.\nNow--let's hear them again.\"\n\nThe guard rolled his eyes up in silent rebellion and repeated in a\ntoneless voice: \"We stay here in the car and keep the motor running\nwhile you go inside the stone pile there. We don't let anybody in\nthe car and we try and keep them clear of the car--short of shooting\nthem, that is. We don't come in, no matter what happens or what it\nlooks like, but wait for you here. Unless you call on the radio, in\nwhich case we come in with the automatics going and shoot the place\nup, and it doesn't matter who we hit. This will be done only as\na last resort.\"\n\n\"See if you can't arrange that last resort thing,\" the other guard\nsaid, patting the heavy blue barrel of his weapon.\n\n\"I meant that _last_ resort,\" Brion said angrily. \"If any guns go\noff without my permission you will pay for it, and pay with your\nnecks. I want that clearly understood. You are here as a rear guard\nand a base for me to get back to. This is my operation and mine\nalone--unless I call you in. Understood?\"\n\nHe waited until all three men had nodded in agreement, then checked\nthe charge on his gun--it was fully loaded. It would be foolish to\ngo in unarmed, but he had to. One gun wouldn't save him. He put it\naside. The button radio on his collar was working and had a strong\nenough signal to get through any number of walls. He took off his\ncoat, threw open the door and stepped out into the searing\nbrilliance of the Disan noon.\n\nThere was only the desert silence, broken by the steady throb of\nthe car's motor behind him. Stretching away to the horizon in every\ndirection was the eternal desert of sand. The keep stood nearby,\nsolitary, a massive pile of black rock. Brion plodded closer,\nwatching for any motion from the walls. Nothing stirred. The\nhigh-walled, irregularly shaped construction sat in a ponderous\nsilence. Brion was sweating now, only partially from the heat.\n\nHe circled the thing, looking for a gate. There wasn't one at ground\nlevel. A slanting cleft in the stone could be climbed easily, but it\nseemed incredible that this might be the only entrance. A complete\ncircuit proved that it was. Brion looked unhappily at the slanting\nand broken ramp, then cupped his hands and shouted loudly.\n\n\"I'm coming up. Your radio doesn't work any more. I'm bringing the\nmessage from Nyjord that you have been waiting to hear.\" This was\na slight bending of the truth without fracturing it. There was no\nanswer--just the hiss of wind-blown sand against the rock and the\nmutter of the car in the background. He started to climb.\n\nThe rock underfoot was crumbling and he had to watch where he put\nhis feet. At the same time he fought a constant impulse to look up,\nwatching for anything falling from above. Nothing happened. When he\nreached the top of the wall he was breathing hard; sweat moistened\nhis body. There was still no one in sight. He stood on an unevenly\nshaped wall that appeared to circle the building. Instead of having\na courtyard inside it, the wall was the outer face of the structure,\nthe domed roof rising from it. At varying intervals dark openings\ngave access to the interior. When Brion looked down, the sand car\nwas just a dun-colored bump in the desert, already far behind him.\n\nStooping, he went through the nearest door. There was still no one\nin sight. The room inside was something out of a madman's funhouse.\nIt was higher than it was wide, irregular in shape, and more like a\nhallway than a room. At one end it merged into an incline that\nbecame a stairwell. At the other it ended in a hole that vanished\nin darkness below. Light of sorts filtered in through slots and\nholes drilled into the thick stone wall. Everything was built of the\nsame crumble-textured but strong rock. Brion took the stairs. After\na number of blind passages and wrong turns he saw a stronger light\nahead, and went on. There was food, metal, even artifacts of the\nunusual Disan design in the different rooms he passed through. Yet\nno people. The light ahead grew stronger, and the last passageway\nopened and swelled out until it led into the large central chamber.\n\nThis was the heart of the strange structure. All the rooms,\npassageways and halls existed just to give form to this gigantic\nchamber. The walls rose sharply, the room being circular in cross\nsection and growing narrower towards the top. It was a truncated\ncone, since there was no ceiling; a hot blue disk of sky cast light\non the floor below.\n\nOn the floor stood a knot of men who stared at Brion.\n\nOut of the corner of his eyes, and with the very periphery of his\nconsciousness, he was aware of the rest of the room--barrels,\nstores, machinery, a radio transceiver, various bundles and heaps\nthat made no sense at first glance. There was no time to look\ncloser. Every fraction of his attention was focused on the muffled\nand hooded men.\n\nHe had found the enemy.\n\nEverything that had happened to him so far on Dis had been\npreparation for this moment. The attack in the desert, the escape,\nthe dreadful heat of sun and sand. All this had tempered and\nprepared him. It had been nothing in itself. Now the battle would\nbegin in earnest.\n\nNone of this was conscious in his mind. His fighter's reflexes bent\nhis shoulders, curved his hands before him as he walked softly in\nbalance, ready to spring in any direction. Yet none of this was\nreally necessary. All the danger so far was nonphysical. When he did\ngive conscious thought to the situation he stopped, startled. What\nwas wrong here? None of the men had moved or made a sound. How could\nhe even know they were men? They were so muffled and wrapped in\ncloth that only their eyes were exposed.\n\nNo doubt, however, existed in Brion's mind. In spite of muffled\ncloth and silence, he knew them for what they were. The eyes were\nempty of expression and unmoving, yet were filled with the same\nnegative emptiness as those of a bird of prey. They could look on\nlife, death, and the rending of flesh with the same lack of interest\nand compassion. All this Brion knew in an instant of time, without\nwords being spoken. Between the time he lifted one foot and walked a\nstep he understood what he had to face. There could be no doubt, not\nto an empathetic.\n\nFrom the group of silent men poured a frost-white wave of unemotion.\nAn empathetic shares what other men feel. He gets his knowledge of\ntheir reaction by sensing lightly their emotions, the surges of\ninterest, hate, love, fear, desire, the sweep of large and small\nsensations that accompany all thought and action. The empathetic\nis always aware of this constant and silent surge, whether he makes\nthe effort to understand it or not. He is like a man glancing across\nthe open pages of a tableful of books. He can see that the type, words,\nparagraphs, thoughts are there, even without focusing his attention\nto understand any of it.\n\nThen how does the man feel when he glances at the open books and\nsees only blank pages? The books are there--the words are not. He\nturns the pages of one, of the others, flipping the pages, searching\nfor meaning. There is no meaning. All of the pages are blank.\n\nThis was the way in which the magter were blank, without emotions.\nThere was a barely sensed surge and return that must have been\nneural impulses on a basic level--the automatic adjustments of nerve\nand muscle that keep an organism alive. Nothing more. Brion reached\nfor other sensations, but there was nothing there to grasp. Either\nthese men were without emotions, or they were able to block them\nfrom his detection; it was impossible to tell which.\n\nVery little time had passed while Brion made these discoveries. The\nknot of men still looked at him, silent and unmoving. They weren't\nexpectant, their attitude could not have been called one of\ninterest. But he had come to them and now they waited to find out\nwhy. Any questions or statements they spoke would be superfluous,\nso they didn't speak. The responsibility was his.\n\n\"I have come to talk with Lig-magte. Who is he?\" Brion didn't like\nthe tiny sound his voice made in the immense room.\n\nOne of the men gave a slight motion to draw attention to himself.\nNone of the others moved. They still waited.\n\n\"I have a message for you,\" Brion said, speaking slowly to fill the\nsilence of the room and the emptiness of his thoughts. This had to\nbe handled right. But what was right? \"I'm from the Foundation in\nthe city, as you undoubtedly know. I've been talking to the people\nof Nyjord. They have a message for you.\"\n\nThe silence grew longer. Brion had no intention of making this a\nmonologue. He needed facts to operate, to form an opinion. Looking\nat the silent forms was telling him nothing. Time stretched taut,\nand finally Lig-magte spoke.\n\n\"The Nyjorders are going to surrender.\"\n\nIt was an impossibly strange sentence. Brion had never realized\nbefore how much of the content of speech was made up of emotion.\nIf the man had given it a positive emphasis, perhaps said it with\nenthusiasm, it would have meant, \"Success! The enemy is going to\nsurrender!\" This wasn't the meaning.\n\nWith a rising inflection on the end it would have been a question.\n\"Are they going to surrender?\" It was neither of these. The sentence\ncarried no other message than that contained in the simplest\nmeanings of the separate words. It had intellectual connotations,\nbut these could only be gained from past knowledge, not from the\nsound of the words. There was only one message they were prepared\nto receive from Nyjord. Therefore Brion was bringing the message.\nIf that was not the message Brion was bringing the men here were\nnot interested.\n\nThis was the vital fact. If they were not interested he could have\nno further value to them. Since he came from the enemy, he was the\nenemy. Therefore he would be killed. Because this was vital to his\nexistence, Brion took the time to follow the thought through. It\nmade logical sense--and logic was all he could depend on now. He\ncould be talking to robots or alien creatures, for all the human\nresponse he was receiving.\n\n\"You can't win this war--all you can do is hurry your own deaths.\"\nHe said this with as much conviction as he could, realizing at the\nsame time that it was wasted effort. No flicker of response stirred\nin the men before him. \"The Nyjorders know you have the cobalt\nbombs, and they have detected your jump-space projector. They can't\ntake any more chances. They have pushed the deadline closer by an\nentire day. There are one and a half days left before the bombs fall\nand you are all destroyed. Do you realize what that means--\"\n\n\"Is that the message?\" Lig-magte asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Brion said.\n\nTwo things saved his life then. He had guessed what would happen as\nsoon as they had his message, though he hadn't been sure. But even\nthe suspicion had put him on his guard. This, combined with the\nreflexes of a Winner of the Twenties, was barely enough to enable\nhim to survive.\n\nFrom frozen mobility Lig-magte had catapulted into headlong attack.\nAs he leaped forward he drew a curved, double-edged blade from under\nhis robes. It plunged unerringly through the spot where Brion's body\nhad been an instant before.\n\nThere had been no time to tense his muscles and jump, just the space\nof time to relax them and fall to one side. His reasoning mind\njoined the battle as he hit the floor. Lig-magte plunged by him,\nturning and bringing the knife down at the same time. Brion's foot\nlashed out and caught the other man's leg, sending him sprawling.\n\nThey were both on their feet at the same instant, facing each other.\nBrion now had his hands clasped before him in the unarmed man's\nbest defense against a knife, the two arms protecting the body,\nthe two hands joined to beat aside the knife arm from whichever\ndirection it came. The Disan hunched low, flipped the knife quickly\nfrom hand to hand, then thrust it again at Brion's midriff.\n\nOnly by the merest fractional margin did Brion evade the attack for\nthe second time. Lig-magte fought with utter violence. Every action\nwas as intense as possible, deadly and thorough. There could be only\none end to this unequal contest if Brion stayed on the defensive.\nThe man with the knife had to win.\n\nWith the next charge Brion changed tactics. He leaped inside the\nthrust, clutching for the knife arm. A burning slice of pain cut\nacross his arm, then his fingers clutched the tendoned wrist. They\nclamped down hard, grinding shut, compressing with the tightening\nintensity of a closing vise.\n\nIt was all he could do simply to hold on. There was no science in\nit, just his greater strength from exercise and existence on a\nheavier planet. All of this strength went to his clutching hand,\nbecause he held his own life in that hand, forcing away the knife\nthat wanted to terminate it forever. Nothing else mattered--neither\nthe frightening force of the knees that thudded into his body nor\nthe hooked fingers that reached for his eyes to tear them out. He\nprotected his face as well as he could, while the nails tore furrows\nthrough his flesh and the cut on his arm bled freely. These were\nonly minor things to be endured. His life depended on the grasp of\nthe fingers of his right hand.\n\nThere was a sudden immobility as Brion succeeded in clutching\nLig-magte's other arm. It was a good grip, and he could hold the arm\nimmobilized. They had reached stasis, standing knee to knee, their\nfaces only a few inches apart. The muffling cloth had fallen from\nthe Disan's face during the struggle, and empty, frigid eyes stared\ninto Brion's. No flicker of emotion crossed the harsh planes of the\nother man's face. A great puckered white scar covered one cheek and\npulled up a corner of the mouth in a cheerless grimace. It was\nfalse; there was still no expression here, even when the pain must\nbe growing more intense.\n\nBrion was winning--if none of the watchers broke the impasse.\nHis greater weight and strength counted now. The Disan would have\nto drop the knife before his arm was dislocated at the shoulder.\nHe didn't do it. With sudden horror Brion realized that he wasn't\ngoing to drop it--no matter what happened.\n\nA dull, hideous snap jerked through the Disan's body and the arm\nhung limp and dead. No expression crossed the man's face. The knife\nwas still locked in the fingers of the paralyzed hand. With his\nother hand Lig-magte reached across and started to pry the blade\nloose, ready to continue the battle one-handed. Brion raised his\nfoot and kicked the knife free, sending it spinning across the room.\n\nLig-magte made a fist of his good hand and crashed it into Brion's\ngroin. He was still fighting, as if nothing had changed. Brion\nbacked slowly away from the man. \"Stop it,\" he said. \"You can't win\nnow. It's impossible.\" He called to the other men who were watching\nthe unequal battle with expressionless immobility. No one answered\nhim.\n\nWith a terrible sinking sensation Brion then realized what would\nhappen and what he had to do. Lig-magte was as heedless of his own\nlife as he was of the life of his planet. He would press the attack\nno matter what damage was done to him. Brion had an insane vision of\nhim breaking the man's other arm, fracturing both his legs, and the\nlimbless broken creature still coming forward. Crawling, rolling,\nteeth bared, since they were the only remaining weapon.\n\nThere was only one way to end it. Brion feinted and the Lig-magte's\narm moved clear of his body. The engulfing cloth was thin and\nthrough it Brion could see the outlines of the Disan's abdomen and\nrib cage, the clear location of the great nerve ganglion.\n\nIt was the death blow of kara-te. Brion had never used it on a man.\nIn practice he had broken heavy boards, splintering them instantly\nwith the short, precise stroke. The stiffened hand moving forward\nin a sudden surge, all the weight and energy of his body\nconcentrated in his joined fingertips. Plunging deep into the\nother's flesh.\n\nKilling, not by accident or in sudden anger. Killing because this\nwas the only way the battle could possibly end.\n\nLike a ruined tower of flesh, the Disan crumpled and fell.\n\nDripping blood, exhausted, Brion stood over the body of Lig-magte\nand stared at the dead man's allies.\n\nDeath filled the room.\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\n\nFacing the silent Disans, Brion's thoughts hurtled about in sweeping\ncircles. There would be no more than an instant's tick of time\nbefore the magter avenged themselves bloodily and completely. He\nfelt a fleeting regret for not having brought his gun, then\nabandoned the thought. There was no time for regrets--what could he\ndo _now_?\n\nThe silent watchers hadn't attacked instantly, and Brion realized\nthat they couldn't be positive yet that Lig-magte had been killed.\nOnly Brion himself knew the deadliness of that blow. Their lack of\nknowledge might buy him a little more time.\n\n\"Lig-magte is unconscious, but he will revive quickly,\" Brion said,\npointing at the huddled body. As the eyes turned automatically to\nfollow his finger, he began walking slowly towards the exit. \"I did\nnot want to do this, but he forced me to, because he wouldn't listen\nto reason. Now I have something else to show you, something that I\nhoped it would not be necessary to reveal.\"\n\nHe was saying the first words that came into his head, trying to\nkeep them distracted as long as possible. He must appear to be only\ngoing across the room, that was the feeling he must generate. There\nwas even time to stop for a second and straighten his rumpled\nclothing and brush the sweat from his eyes. Talking easily, walking\nslowly towards the hall that led out of the chamber.\n\nHe was halfway there when the spell broke and the rush began. One of\nthe magter knelt and touched the body, and shouted a single word:\n\n\"Dead!\"\n\nBrion hadn't waited for the official announcement. At the first\nmovement of feet, he dived headlong for the shelter of the exit.\nThere was a spatter of tiny missiles on the wall next to him and he\nhad a brief glimpse of raised blowguns before the wall intervened.\nHe went up the dimly lit stairs three at a time.\n\nThe pack was just behind him, voiceless and deadly. He could not\ngain on them--if anything, they were closing the distance as he\npushed his already tired body to the utmost. There was no subtlety\nor trick he could use now, just straightforward flight back the way\nhe had come. A single slip on the irregular steps and it would be\nall over.\n\nThere was someone ahead of him. If the woman had waited a few\nseconds more he would certainly have been killed; but instead of\nslashing at him as he went by the doorway, she made the mistake of\nrushing to the center of the stairs, the knife ready to impale him\nas he came up. Without slowing, Brion fell onto his hands and easily\ndodged under the blow. As he passed he twisted and seized her around\nthe waist, picking her from the ground.\n\nWhen her legs lifted from under her the woman screamed--the first\nhuman sound Brion had heard in this human anthill. His pursuers were\njust behind him, and he hurled the woman into them with all his\nstrength. They fell in a tangle, and Brion used the precious seconds\ngained to reach the top of the building.\n\nThere must have been other stairs and exits, because one of the\nmagter stood between Brion and the way down out of this trap--armed\nand ready to kill him if he tried to pass.\n\nAs he ran towards the executioner, Brion flicked on his collar radio\nand shouted into it. \"I'm in trouble here. Can you--\"\n\nThe guards in the car must have been waiting for this message.\nBefore he had finished there was the thud of a high-velocity slug\nhitting flesh and the Disan spun and fell, blood soaking his\nshoulder. Brion leaped over him and headed for the ramp.\n\n\"The next one is me--hold your fire!\" he called.\n\nBoth guards must have had their telescopic sights zeroed on the\nspot. They let Brion pass, then threw in a hail of semi-automatic\nfire that tore chunks from the stone and screamed away in noisy\nricochets. Brion didn't try to see if anyone was braving this hail\nof covering fire; he concentrated his energies on making as quick\nand erratic a descent as he could. Above the sounds of the firing he\nheard the car motor howl as it leaped forward. With their careful\naim spoiled, the gunners switched to full automatic and unleashed\na hailstorm of flying metal that bracketed the top of the tower.\n\n\"Cease ... firing!\" Brion gasped into the radio as he ran. The\ndriver was good, and timed his arrival with exactitude. The car\nreached the base of the tower at the same instant Brion did, and he\nburst through the door while it was still moving. No orders were\nnecessary. He fell headlong onto a seat as the car swung in a\ndust-raising turn and ground into high gear, back to the city.\n\nReaching over carefully, the tall guard gently extracted a bit of\npointed wood and fluff from a fold of Brion's pants. He cracked open\nthe car door, and just as delicately threw it out.\n\n\"I knew that thing didn't touch you,\" he said, \"since you are still\namong the living. They've got a poison on those blowgun darts that\ntakes all of twelve seconds to work. Lucky.\"\n\nLucky! Brion was beginning to realize just how lucky he was to be\nout of the trap alive. And with information. Now that he knew more\nabout the magter, he shuddered at his innocence in walking alone and\nunarmed into the tower. Skill had helped him survive--but better\nthan average luck had been necessary. Curiosity had gotten him in,\nbrashness and speed had taken him out. He was exhausted, battered\nand bloody--but cheerfully happy. The facts about the magter were\narranging themselves into a theory that might explain their attempt\nat racial suicide. It just needed a little time to be put into\nshape.\n\nA pain cut across his arm and he jumped, startled, pieces of his\nthoughts crashing into ruin around him. The gunner had cracked the\nfirst-aid box and was swabbing his arm with antiseptic. The knife\nwound was long, but not deep. Brion shivered while the bandage was\ngoing on, then quickly slipped into his coat. The air conditioner\nwhined industriously, bringing down the temperature.\n\nThere was no attempt to follow the car. When the black tower had\ndropped over the horizon the guards relaxed, ran cleaning rods\nthrough their guns and compared marksmanship. All of their\nantagonism towards Brion was gone; they actually smiled at him.\nHe had given them the first chance to shoot back since they had\nbeen on this planet.\n\nThe ride was uneventful, and Brion was scarcely aware of it.\nA theory was taking form in his mind. It was radical and\nstartling--yet it seemed to be the only one that fitted the facts.\nHe pushed at it from all sides, but if there were any holes he\ncouldn't find them. What it needed was dispassionate proving or\ndisproving. There was only one person on Dis who was qualified\nto do this.\n\nLea was working in the lab when he came in, bent over a low-power\nbinocular microscope. Something small, limbless and throbbing was\non the slide. She glanced up when she heard his footsteps, smiling\nwarmly when she recognized him. Fatigue and pain had drawn her face;\nher skin, glistening with burn ointment, was chapped and peeling.\n\n\"I must look a wreck,\" she said, putting the back of her hand to her\ncheek. \"Something like a well-oiled and lightly cooked piece of\nbeef.\" She lowered her arm suddenly and took his hand in both of\nhers. Her palms were warm and slightly moist.\n\n\"Thank you, Brion,\" was all she could say. Her society on Earth was\nhighly civilized and sophisticated, able to discuss any topic\nwithout emotion and without embarrassment. This was fine in most\ncircumstances, but made it difficult to thank a person for saving\nyour life. However you tried to phrase it, it came out sounding like\na last-act speech from a historical play. There was no doubt,\nhowever, as to what she meant. Her eyes were large and dark, the\npupils dilated by the drugs she had been given. They could not lie,\nnor could the emotions he sensed. He did not answer, just held her\nhand an instant longer.\n\n\"How do you feel,\" he asked, concerned. His conscience twinged as\nhe remembered that he was the one who had ordered her out of bed\nand back to work today.\n\n\"I should be feeling terrible,\" she said, with an airy wave of her\nhand. \"But I'm walking on top of the world. I'm so loaded with\npain-killers and stimulants that I'm high as the moon. All the\nnerves to my feet feel turned off--it's like walking on two balls\nof fluff. Thanks for getting me out of that awful hospital and back\nto work.\"\n\nBrion was suddenly sorry for having driven her from her sick bed.\n\n\"Don't be sorry!\" Lea said, apparently reading his mind, but really\nseeing only his sudden ashamed expression. \"I'm feeling no pain.\nHonestly. I feel a little light-headed and foggy at times, nothing\nmore. And this is the job I came here to do. In fact ... well, it's\nalmost impossible to tell you just how fascinating it all is! It was\nalmost worth getting baked and parboiled for.\"\n\nShe swung back to the microscope, centering the specimen with a turn\nof the stage adjustment screw. \"Poor Ihjel was right when he said\nthis planet was exobiologically fascinating. This is a gastropod,\na lot like _Odostomia_, but it has parasitical morphological changes\nso profound that--\"\n\n\"There's something else I remember,\" Brion said, interrupting her\nenthusiastic lecture, only half of which he could understand.\n\"Didn't Ihjel also hope that you would give some study to the\nnatives as well as their environment? The problem is with the\nDisans--not with the local wild life.\"\n\n\"But I _am_ studying them,\" Lea insisted. \"The Disans have attained\nan incredibly advanced form of commensalism. Their lives are so\nintimately connected and integrated with the other life forms that\nthey must be studied in relation to their environment. I doubt if\nthey show as many external physical changes as little eating-foot\n_Odostomia_ on the slide here, but there will surely be a number of\npsychological changes and adjustments that will crop up. One of\nthese might be the explanation of their urge for planetary\nsuicide.\"\n\n\"That may be true--but I don't think so,\" Brion said. \"I went on\na little expedition this morning and found something that has more\nimmediate relevancy.\"\n\nFor the first time Lea became aware of his slightly battered\ncondition. Her drug-grooved mind could only follow a single idea at\na time and had over-looked the significance of the bandage and dirt.\n\n\"I've been visiting,\" Brion said, forestalling the question on her\nlips. \"The magter are the ones who are responsible for causing the\ntrouble, and I had to see them up close before I could make any\ndecisions. It wasn't a very pleasant thing, but I found out what\nI wanted to know. They are different in every way from the normal\nDisans. I've compared them. I've talked to Ulv--the native who saved\nus in the desert--and I can understand him. He is not like us in\nmany ways--he certainly couldn't be, living in this oven--but he is\nstill undeniably human. He gave us drinking water when we needed it,\nthen brought help. The magter, the upper-class lords of Dis, are\nthe direct opposite. As cold-blooded and ruthless a bunch of\nmurderers as you can possibly imagine. They tried to kill me when\nthey met me, without reason. Their clothes, habits, dwellings,\nmanners--everything about them differs from that of the normal\nDisan. More important, the magter are as coldly efficient and\ninhuman as a reptile. They have no emotions, no love, no hate,\nno anger, no fear--nothing. Each of them is a chilling bundle of\nthought processes and reactions, with all the emotions removed.\"\n\n\"Aren't you exaggerating?\" Lea asked. \"After all, you can't be sure.\nIt might just be part of their training not to reveal any emotional\nstate. Everyone must experience emotional states, whether they like\nit or not.\"\n\n\"That's my main point. Everyone does--except the magter. I can't go\ninto all the details now, so you'll just have to take my word for\nit. Even at the point of death they have no fear or hatred. It may\nsound impossible, but it is true.\"\n\nLea tried to shake the knots from her drug-hazed mind. \"I'm dull\ntoday,\" she said. \"You'll have to excuse me. If these rulers had no\nemotional responses, that might explain their present suicidal\nposition. But an explanation like this raises more new problems than\nit supplies answers to the old ones. How did they get this way! It\ndoesn't seem humanly possible to be without emotions of some kind.\"\n\n\"Just my point. Not _humanly_ possible. I think these ruling class\nDisans aren't human at all, like the other Disans. I think they are\nalien creatures--robots or androids--anything except men. I think\nthey are living in disguise among the normal human dwellers.\"\n\nAt first Lea started to smile, then her feeling changed when she saw\nhis face. \"You are serious?\" she asked.\n\n\"Never more so. I realize it must sound as if I've had my brains\nbounced around too much this morning. Yet this is the only idea I\ncan come up with that fits all of the facts. Look at the evidence\nyourself. One simple thing stands out clearly, and must be\nconsidered first if any theory is to hold up. That is the magters'\ncomplete indifference to death--their own or anyone else's. Is that\nnormal to mankind?\"\n\n\"No--but I can find a couple of explanations that I would rather\nexplore first, before dragging in an alien life form. There may have\nbeen a mutation or an inherited disease that has deformed or warped\ntheir minds.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't that be sort of self-eliminating?\" Brion asked.\n\"Anti-survival? People who die before puberty would find it a little\ndifficult to pass on a mutation to their children. But let's not\nbeat this one point to death--it's the totality of these people that\nI find so hard to accept. Any one thing might be explained away, but\nnot the collection of them. What about their complete lack of\nemotion? Or their manner of dress and their secrecy in general? The\nordinary Disan wears a cloth kilt, while the magter cover themselves\nas completely as possible. They stay in their black towers and\nnever go out except in groups. Their dead are always removed so they\ncan't be examined. In every way they act like a race apart--and I\nthink they are.\"\n\n\"Granted for the moment that this outlandish idea might be true, how\ndid they get here? And why doesn't anyone know about it besides them?\"\n\n\"Easily enough explained,\" Brion insisted. \"There are no written\nrecords on this planet. After the Breakdown, when the handful of\nsurvivors were just trying to exist here, the aliens could have\nlanded and moved in. Any interference could have been wiped out.\nOnce the population began to grow, the invaders found they could\nkeep control by staying separate, so their alien difference wouldn't\nbe noticed.\"\n\n\"Why should that bother them?\" Lea asked. \"If they are so\nindifferent to death, they can't have any strong thoughts on public\nopinion or alien body odor. Why would they bother with such a\ncomplex camouflage? And if they arrived from another planet, what\nhas happened to the scientific ability that brought them here?\"\n\n\"Peace,\" Brion said. \"I don't know enough to be able even to guess\nat answers to half your questions. I'm just trying to fit a theory\nto the facts. And the facts are clear. The magter are so inhuman\nthey would give me nightmares--if I were sleeping these days. What\nwe need is more evidence.\"\n\n\"Then get it,\" Lea said with finality. \"I'm not telling you to turn\nmurderer--but you might try a bit of grave-digging. Give me a\nscalpel and one of your friends stretched out on a slab and I'll\nquickly tell you what he is or is not.\" She turned back to the\nmicroscope and bent over the eyepiece.\n\nThat was really the only way to hack the Gordian knot. Dis had only\nthirty-six more hours to live, so individual deaths shouldn't be of\nany concern. He had to find a dead magter, and if none was\nobtainable in the proper condition he had to get one of them by\nviolence. For a planetary savior, he was personally doing in an\nawful lot of the citizenry.\n\nHe stood behind Lea, looking down at her thoughtfully while she\nworked. The back of her neck, lightly covered with gently curling\nhair, was turned toward him. With one of the about-face shifts\nthe mind is capable of, his thoughts flipped from death to life,\nand he experienced a strong desire to caress this spot lightly,\nto feel the yielding texture of female flesh....\n\nPlunging his hands deep into his pockets, he walked quickly to the\ndoor. \"Get some rest soon,\" he called to her. \"I doubt if those bugs\nwill give you the answer. I'm going now to see if I can get the\nfull-sized specimen you want.\"\n\n\"The truth could be anywhere. I'll stay on these until you come\nback,\" she said, not looking up from the microscope.\n\nUp under the roof was a well-equipped communications room. Brion\nhad taken a quick look at it when he had first toured the building.\nThe duty operator had earphones on--though only one of the phones\ncovered an ear--and was monitoring through the bands. His shoeless\nfeet were on the edge of the table, and he was eating a thick\nsandwich held in his free hand. His eyes bulged when he saw Brion\nin the doorway and he jumped into a flurry of action.\n\n\"Hold the pose,\" Brion told him; \"it doesn't bother me. And if you\nmake any sudden moves you are liable to break a phone, electrocute\nyourself, or choke to death. Just see if you can set the transceiver\non this frequency for me.\" Brion wrote the number on a scratch\npad and slid it over to the operator. It was the frequency\nProfessor-Commander Krafft had given him for the radio of the\nillegal terrorists--the Nyjord army.\n\nThe operator plugged in a handset and gave it to Brion. \"Circuit\nopen,\" he mumbled around a mouthful of still unswallowed sandwich.\n\n\"This is Brandd, director of the C.R.F. Come in, please.\" He went on\nrepeating this for more than ten minutes before he got an answer.\n\n\"_What do you want?_\"\n\n\"I have a message of vital urgency for you--and I would also like\nyour help. Do you want any more information on the radio?\n\n\"_No. Wait there--we'll get in touch with you after dark._\"\nThe carrier wave went dead.\n\nThirty-five hours to the end of the world--and all he could do was wait.\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\n\nOn Brion's desk when he came in, were two neat piles of paper. As he\nsat down and reached for them he was conscious of an arctic coldness\nin the air, a frigid blast. It was coming from the air-conditioner\ngrill, which was now covered by welded steel bars. The control unit\nwas sealed shut. Someone was either being very funny or very\nefficient. Either way, it was cold. Brion kicked at the cover plate\nuntil it buckled, then bent it aside. After a careful look into the\ninterior he disconnected one wire and shorted it to another. He was\nrewarded by a number of sputtering cracks and a quantity of smoke.\nThe compressor moaned and expired.\n\nFaussel was standing in the door with more papers, a shocked\nexpression on his face. \"What do you have there?\" Brion asked.\n\nFaussel managed to straighten out his face and brought the folders\nto the desk, arranging them on the piles already there. \"These are\nthe progress reports you asked for, from all units. Details to date,\nconclusions, suggestions, et cetera.\"\n\n\"And the other pile?\" Brion pointed.\n\n\"Offplanet correspondence, commissary invoices, requisitions.\" He\nstraightened the edges of the stack while he answered. \"Daily\nreports, hospital log....\" His voice died away and stopped as Brion\ncarefully pushed the stack off the edge of the desk into the\nwastebasket.\n\n\"In other words, red tape,\" Brion said. \"Well, it's all filed.\"\n\nOne by one the progress reports followed the first stack into the\nbasket, until the desk was clear. Nothing. It was just what he had\nexpected. But there had always been the off chance that one of the\nspecialists could come up with a new approach. They hadn't; they\nwere all too busy specializing.\n\nOutside the sky was darkening. The front entrance guard had been\ntold to let in anyone who came asking for the director. There was\nnothing else Brion could do until the Nyjord rebels made contact.\nIrritation bit at him. At least Lea was doing something\nconstructive; he could look in on her.\n\nHe opened the door to the lab with a feeling of pleasant\nanticipation. It froze and shattered instantly. Her microscope was\nhooded and she was gone. _She's having dinner_, he thought,\nor--_she's in the hospital_. The hospital was on the floor below,\nand he went there first.\n\n\"Of course she's here!\" Dr. Stine grumbled. \"Where else should\na girl in her condition be? She was out of bed long enough today.\nTomorrow's the last day, and if you want to get any more work out\nof her before the deadline, you had better let her rest tonight.\nBetter let the whole staff rest. I've been handing out tranquilizers\nlike aspirin all day. They're falling apart.\"\n\n\"The world's falling apart. How is Lea doing?\"\n\n\"Considering her shape, she's fine. Go in and see for yourself if\nyou won't take my word for it. I have other patients to look at.\"\n\n\"Are you that worried, Doctor?\"\n\n\"Of course I am! I'm just as prone to the weakness of the flesh as\nthe rest of you. We're sitting on a ticking bomb and I don't like\nit. I'll do my job as long as it is necessary, but I'll also be\ndamned glad to see the ships land to pull us out. The only skin that\nI really feel emotionally concerned about right now is my own. And\nif you want to be let in on a public secret--the rest of your staff\nfeels the same way. So don't look forward to too much efficiency.\"\n\n\"I never did,\" Brion said to the retreating back.\n\nLea's room was dark, illuminated only by the light of Dis's moon\nslanting in through the window. Brion let himself in and closed the\ndoor behind him. Walking quietly, he went over to the bed. Lea was\nsleeping soundly, her breathing gentle and regular. A night's sleep\nnow would do as much good as all the medication.\n\nHe should have gone then; instead, he sat down in the chair placed\nnext to the head of the bed. The guards knew where he was--he could\nwait here just as well as any place else.\n\nIt was a stolen moment of peace on a world at the brink of\ndestruction. He was grateful for it. Everything looked less harsh\nin the moonlight, and he rubbed some of the tension from his eyes.\nLea's face was ironed smooth by the light, beautiful and young, a\ndirect contrast to everything else on this poisonous world. Her hand\nwas outside of the covers and he took it in his own, obeying a\nsudden impulse. Looking out of the window at the desert in the\ndistance, he let the peace wash over him, forcing himself to forget\nfor the moment that in one more day life would be stripped from this\nplanet.\n\nLater, when he looked back at Lea he saw that her eyes were open,\nthough she hadn't moved. How long had she been awake? He jerked his\nhand away from hers, feeling suddenly guilty.\n\n\"Is the boss-man looking after the serfs, to see if they're fit for\nthe treadmills in the morning?\" she asked. It was the kind of remark\nshe had used with such frequency in the ship, though it didn't sound\nquite as harsh now. And she was smiling. Yet it reminded him too\nwell of her superior attitude towards rubes from the stellar sticks.\nHere he might be the director, but on ancient Earth he would be only\none more gaping, lead-footed yokel.\n\n\"How do you feel?\" he asked, realizing and hating the triteness of\nthe words, even as he said them.\n\n\"Terrible. I'll be dead by morning. Reach me a piece of fruit from\nthat bowl, will you? My mouth tastes like an old boot heel. I wonder\nhow fresh fruit ever got here. Probably a gift to the working\nclasses from the smiling planetary murderers on Nyjord.\"\n\nShe took the apple Brion gave her and bit into it. \"Did you ever\nthink of going to Earth?\"\n\nBrion was startled. This was too close to his own thoughts about\nplanetary backgrounds. There couldn't possibly be a connection\nthough. \"Never,\" he told her. \"Up until a few months ago I never\neven considered leaving Anvhar. The Twenties are such a big thing at\nhome that it is hard to imagine that anything else exists while you\nare still taking part in them.\"\n\n\"Spare me the Twenties,\" she pleaded. \"After listening to you and\nIhjel, I know far more about them than I shall ever care to know.\nBut what about Anvhar itself? Do you have big city-states as Earth\ndoes?\"\n\n\"Nothing like that. For its size, it has a very small population.\nNo big cities at all. I guess the largest centers of population\nare around the schools, packing plants, things like that.\"\n\n\"Any exobiologists there?\" Lea asked, with a woman's eternal ability\nto make any general topic personal.\n\n\"At the universities, I suppose, though I wouldn't know for sure.\nAnd you must realize that when I say no big cities, I also mean no\nlittle cities. We aren't organized that way at all. I imagine the\nbasic physical unit is the family and the circle of friends. Friends\nget important quickly, since the family breaks up when children are\nstill relatively young. Something in the genes, I suppose--we all\nenjoy being alone. I suppose you might call it an inbred survival\ntrait.\"\n\n\"Up to a point,\" she said, biting delicately into the apple. \"Carry\nthat sort of thing too far and you end up with no population at all.\nA certain amount of proximity is necessary for that.\"\n\n\"Of course it is. And there must be some form of recognized\nrelationship or control--that or complete promiscuity. On Anvhar\nthe emphasis is on personal responsibility, and that seems to take care\nof the problem. If we didn't have an adult way of looking at ...\nthings, our kind of life would be impossible. Individuals are\nbrought together either by accident or design, and with this\nproximity must be some certainty of relations....\"\n\n\"You're losing me,\" Lea protested. \"Either I'm still foggy from\nthe dope, or you are suddenly unable to speak a word of less than\nfour syllables. You know--whenever this happens with you, I get\nthe distinct impression that you are trying to cover up something.\nFor Occam's sake, be specific! Bring me together two of these\nhypothetical individuals and tell me what happens.\"\n\nBrion took a deep breath. He was in over his head and far from\nshore. \"Well--take a bachelor like myself. Since I like\ncross-country skiing I make my home in this big house our family\nhas, right at the edge of the Broken Hills. In summer I looked after\na drumtum herd, but after slaughtering my time was my own all\nwinter. I did a lot of skiing, and used to work for the Twenties.\nSometimes I would go visiting. Then again, people would drop in on\nme--houses are few and far between on Anvhar. We don't even have\nlocks on our doors. You accept and give hospitality without\nqualification. Whoever comes. Male ... female ... in groups or just\ntraveling alone....\"\n\n\"I get the drift. Life must be dull for a single girl on your\niceberg planet. She must surely have to stay home a lot.\"\n\n\"Only if she wants to. Otherwise she can go wherever she wishes and\nbe welcomed as another individual. I suppose it is out of fashion\nin the rest of the galaxy--and would probably raise a big laugh on\nEarth--but a platonic, disinterested friendship between man and\nwoman is an accepted thing on Anvhar.\"\n\n\"Sounds exceedingly dull. If you are all such cool and distant\nfriends, how do babies get made?\"\n\nBrion felt his ears reddening, not sure if he was being teased or\nnot. \"The same damn way they get made any place else! But it's not\njust a reflexive process like a couple of rabbits that happen to\nmeet under the same bush. It's the woman's choice to indicate if\nshe is interested in marriage.\"\n\n\"Is marriage the only thing your women are interested in?\"\n\n\"Marriage or ... anything else. That's up to the girl. We have a\nspecial problem on Anvhar--probably the same thing occurs on every\nplanet where the human race has made a massive adaptation. Not all\nunions are fertile and there is always a large percentage of\nmiscarriages. A large number of births are conceived by artificial\ninsemination. Which is all right when you can't have babies\nnormally. But most women have an emotional bias towards having\ntheir husband's children. And there is only one way to find out\nif this is possible.\"\n\nLea's eyes widened. \"Are you suggesting that your girls see if a man\ncan father children _before_ considering marriage?\"\n\n\"Of course. Otherwise Anvhar would have been depopulated centuries\nago. Therefore the woman does the choosing. If she is interested in\na man, she says so. If she is not interested, the man would never\nthink of suggesting anything. It's a lot different from other\nplanets, but so is our planet Anvhar. It works well for us, which\nis the only test that applies.\"\n\n\"Just about the opposite of Earth,\" Lea told him, dropping the apple\ncore into a dish and carefully licking the tips of her fingers. \"I\nguess you Anvharians would describe Earth as a planetary hotbed of\nsexuality. The reverse of your system, and going full blast all the\ntime. There are far too many people there for comfort. Birth control\ncame late and is still being fought--if you can possibly imagine\nthat. There are just too many of the archaic religions still around,\nas well as crackbrained ideas that have been long entrenched in\ncustom. The world's overcrowded. Men, women, children, a boiling mob\nwherever you look. And all of the physically mature ones seem to be\ninvolved in the Great Game of Love. The male is always the\naggressor. Not physically--at least not often--and women take the\nmost outrageous kinds of flattery for granted. At parties there are\nalways a couple of hot breaths of passion fanning your neck. A girl\nhas to keep her spike heels filed sharp.\"\n\n\"She has to _what_?\"\n\n\"A figure of speech, Brion. Meaning you fight back all the time,\nif you don't want to be washed under by the flood.\"\n\n\"Sounds rather\"--Brion weighed the word before he said it, but\ncould find none other suitable--\"repellent.\"\n\n\"From your point of view, it would be. I'm afraid we get so used to\nit that we even take it for granted. Sociologically speaking....\"\nShe stopped and looked at Brion's straight back and almost rigid\nposture. Her eyes widened and her mouth opened in an unspoken _oh_\nof sudden realization.\n\n\"I'm being a fool,\" she said. \"You weren't speaking generally at\nall! You had a very specific subject in mind. Namely _me_!\"\n\n\"Please, Lea, you must understand....\"\n\n\"But I do!\" She laughed. \"All the time I thought you were being a\nfrigid and hard-hearted lump of ice, you were really being very\nsweet. Just playing the game in good old Anvharian style. Waiting\nfor a sign from me. We'd still be playing by different rules if you\nhadn't had more sense than I, and finally realized that somewhere\nalong the line we must have got our signals mixed. And I thought you\nwere some kind of frosty offworld celibate.\" She let her hand go out\nand her fingers rustled through his hair. Something she had been\nwanting to do for a long time.\n\n\"I had to,\" he said, trying to ignore the light touch of her\nfingers. \"Because I thought so much of you, I couldn't have done\nanything to insult you. Such as forcing my attentions on you. Until\nI began to worry where the insult would lie, since I knew nothing\nabout your planet's mores.\"\n\n\"Well, you know now,\" she said very softly. \"The men aggress. Now\nthat I understand, I think I like your way better. But I'm still not\nsure of all the rules. Do I explain that yes, Brion, I like you so\nvery much? You are more man, in one great big wide-shouldered lump,\nthan I have ever met before. It's not quite the time or the place\nto discuss marriage, but I would certainly like--\"\n\nHis arms were around her, holding her to him. Her hands clasped him\nand their lips sought each other's in the darkness.\n\n\"Gently ...\" she whispered. \"I bruise easily....\"\n\n\n\n\nXIII\n\n\n\"He wouldn't come in, sir. Just hammered on the door and said,\n'_I'm here, tell Brandd._'\"\n\n\"Good enough,\" Brion said, fitting his gun in the holster and\nsliding the extra clips into his pocket. \"I'm going out now, and I\nshould return before dawn. Get one of the wheeled stretchers down\nhere from the hospital. I'll want it waiting when I get back.\"\n\nOutside, the street was darker than he remembered. Brion frowned\nand his hand moved towards his gun. Someone had put all the nearby\nlights out of commission. There was just enough illumination from\nthe stars to enable him to make out the dark bulk of a sand car.\n\n\"Brion Brandd?\" a voice spoke harshly from the car. \"Get in.\"\n\nThe motor roared as soon as he had closed the door. Without lights\nthe sand car churned a path through the city and out into the\ndesert. Though the speed picked up, the driver still drove in the\ndark, feeling his way with a light touch on the controls. The ground\nrose, and when they reached the top of a mesa he killed the engine.\nNeither the driver nor Brion had spoken a word since they left.\n\nA switch snapped and the instrument lights came on. In their dim\nglow Brion could just make out the other man's hawklike profile.\nWhen he moved, Brion saw that his figure was cruelly shortened.\nEither accident or a mutated gene had warped his spine, hunching him\nforward in eternally bent supplication. Warped bodies were rare--his\nwas the first Brion had ever seen. He wondered what series of events\nhad kept him from medical attention all his life. This might explain\nthe bitterness and pain in the man's voice.\n\n\"Did the mighty brains on Nyjord bother to tell you that they have\nchopped another day off the deadline?\" the man asked. \"That this\nworld is about to come to an end?\"\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" Brion said. \"That's why I'm asking your group for\nhelp. Our time is running out too fast.\"\n\nThe man didn't answer; he merely grunted and gave his full attention\nto the radar pings and glowing screen. The electronic senses reached\nout as he made a check on all the search frequencies to see if they\nwere being followed.\n\n\"Where are we going?\" Brion asked.\n\n\"Out into the desert.\" The driver made a vague wave of his hand.\n\"Headquarters of the army. Since the whole thing will be blown up in\nanother day, I guess I can tell you it's the only camp we have. All\nthe cars, men and weapons are based there. And Hys. He's the man in\ncharge. Tomorrow it will be all gone--along with this cursed planet.\nWhat's your business with us?\"\n\n\"Shouldn't I be telling Hys that?\"\n\n\"Suit yourself.\" Satisfied with the instrument search, the driver\nkicked the car to life again and churned on across the desert. \"But\nwe're a volunteer army and we have no secrets from each other. Just\nfrom the fools at home who are going to kill this world.\" There was\na bitterness in his words that he made no attempt to conceal. \"They\nfought among themselves and put off a firm decision so long that now\nthey are forced to commit murder.\"\n\n\"From what I had heard, I thought that it was the other way around.\nThey call your Nyjord army terrorists.\"\n\n\"We are. Because we are an army and we're at war. The idealists at\nhome only understood that when it was too late. If they had backed\nus in the beginning we would have blown open every black castle on\nDis, searched until we found those bombs. But that would have meant\nwanton destruction and death. They wouldn't consider that. Now they\nare going to kill everyone, destroy everything.\" He flicked on the\npanel lights just long enough to take a compass bearing, and Brion\nsaw the tortured unhappiness in his twisted body.\n\n\"It's not over yet,\" Brion said. \"There is more than a day left,\nand I think I'm onto something that might stop the war--without\nany bombs being dropped.\"\n\n\"You're in charge of the Cultural Relationships Free Bread and\nBlankets Foundation, aren't you? What good can your bunch do when\nthe shooting starts?\"\n\n\"None. But maybe we can put off the shooting. If you are trying to\ninsult me--don't bother. My irritation quotient is very high.\"\n\nThe driver merely grunted at this, slowing down as they ran through\na field of broken rock. \"What is it you want?\" he asked.\n\n\"We want to make a detailed examination of one of the magter. Alive\nor dead, it doesn't make any difference. You wouldn't happen to have\none around?\"\n\n\"No. We've fought with them often enough, but always on their home\ngrounds. They keep all their casualties, and a good number of ours.\nWhat good will it do you anyway? A dead one won't tell you where the\nbombs or the jump-space projector is.\"\n\n\"I don't see why I should explain that to you--unless you are in\ncharge. You are Hys, aren't you?\"\n\nThe driver gave an angry sound, and then was silent while he drove.\nFinally he asked, \"What makes you think that?\"\n\n\"Call it a hunch. You don't act very much like a sand-car driver,\nfor one thing. Of course your army may be all generals and no\nprivates--but I doubt it. I also know that time has almost run out\nfor all of us. This is a long ride and it would be a complete waste\nof time if you just sat out in the desert and waited for me. By\ndriving me yourself you could make your mind up before we arrived.\nCould have a decision ready as to whether you are going to help me\nor not. Are you?\"\n\n\"Yes--I'm Hys. But you still haven't answered my question. What do\nyou want the body for?\"\n\n\"We're going to cut it open and take a good long look. I don't think\nthe magter are human. They are something living among men and\ndisguised as men--but still not human.\"\n\n\"Secret aliens?\" Hys exploded the words in a mixture of surprise\nand disgust.\n\n\"Perhaps. The examination will tell us that.\"\n\n\"You're either stupid or incompetent,\" Hys said bitterly. \"The heat\nof Dis has cooked your brains in your head. I'll be no part of this\nkind of absurd plan.\"\n\n\"You must,\" Brion said, surprised at his own calmness. He could\nsense the other man's interest hidden behind his insulting manner.\n\"I don't even have to give you my reasons. In another day this world\nends and you have no way to stop it. I just might have an idea that\ncould work, and you can't afford to take any chances--not if you are\nreally sincere. Either you are a murderer, killing Disans for\npleasure, or you honestly want to stop the war. Which is it?\"\n\n\"You'll have your body all right,\" Hys grated, hurling the car\nviciously around a spire of rock. \"Not that it will accomplish\nanything--but I can find no fault with killing another magter. We\ncan fit your operation into our plans without any trouble. This is\nthe last night and I have sent every one of my teams out on raids.\nWe're breaking into as many magter towers as possible before dawn.\nThere is a slim chance that we might uncover something. It's really\njust shooting in the dark, but it's all we can do now. My own team\nis waiting and you can ride along with us. The others left earlier.\nWe're going to hit a small tower on this side of the city. We raided\nit once before and captured a lot of small arms they had stored\nthere. There is a good chance that they may have been stupid enough\nto store something there again. Sometimes the magter seem to suffer\nfrom a complete lack of imagination.\"\n\n\"You have no idea just how right you are,\" Brion told him.\n\nThe sand car slowed down now, as they approached a slab-sided mesa\nthat rose vertically from the desert. They crunched across broken\nrocks, leaving no tracks. A light blinked on the dashboard, and Hys\nstopped instantly and killed the engine. They climbed out,\nstretching and shivering in the cold desert night.\n\nIt was dark walking in the shadow of the cliff and they had to feel\ntheir way along a path through the tumbled boulders. A sudden blaze\nof light made Brion wince and shield his eyes. Near him, on the\nground, was the humming shape of a cancellation projector, sending\nout a fan-shaped curtain of vibration that absorbed all the light\nrays falling upon it. This incredible blackness made a lightproof\nwall for the recessed hollow at the foot of the cliff. In this\nshelter, under the overhang of rock, were three open sand cars. They\nwere large and armor-plated, warlike in their scarred grey paint.\nMen sprawled, talked, and polished their weapons. Everything stopped\nwhen Hys and Brion appeared.\n\n\"Load up,\" Hys called out. \"We're going to attack now, same plan I\noutlined earlier. Get Telt over here.\" In talking to his own men\nsome of the harshness was gone from his voice. The tall soldiers of\nNyjord moved in ready obeyance of their commander. They loomed over\nhis bent figure, most of them twice as tall as he, but there was no\nhesitation in jumping when he commanded. They were the body of the\nNyjord striking force--he was the brains.\n\nA square-cut, compact man rolled up to Hys and saluted with a\nleisurely flick of his hand. He was weighted and slung about with\npacks and electronic instruments. His pockets bulged with small\ntools and spare parts.\n\n\"This is Telt,\" Hys said to Brion. \"He'll take care of you. Telt's\nmy personal technical squad. He goes along on all my operations with\nhis meters to test the interiors of the Disan forts. So far he's\nfound no trace of a jump-space generator, or excess radioactivity\nthat might indicate a bomb. Since he's useless and you're useless,\nyou both take care of each other. Use the car we came in.\"\n\nTelt's wide face split in a froglike grin; his voice was hoarse and\nthroaty. \"Wait. Just wait! Someday those needles gonna flicker and\nall our troubles be over. What you want me to do with the stranger?\"\n\n\"Supply him with a corpse--one of the magter,\" Hys said. \"Take it\nwherever he wants and then report back here.\" Hys scowled at Telt.\n\"Someday your needles will flicker! Poor fool--this is the last\nday.\" He turned away and waved the men into their sand cars.\n\n\"He likes me,\" Telt said, attaching a final piece of equipment.\n\"You can tell because he calls me names like that. He's a great man,\nHys is, but they never found out until it was too late. Hand me that\nmeter, will you?\"\n\nBrion followed the technician out to the car and helped him load his\nequipment aboard. When the larger cars appeared out of the darkness,\nTelt swung around after them. They snaked forward in a single line\nthrough the rocks, until they came to the desert of rolling sand\ndunes. Then they spread out in line abreast and rushed towards their\ngoal.\n\nTelt hummed to himself hoarsely as he drove. He broke off suddenly\nand looked at Brion. \"What you want the dead Dis for?\"\n\n\"A theory,\" Brion answered sluggishly. He had been half napping in\nthe chair, taking the opportunity for some rest before the attack.\n\"I'm still looking for a way to avert the end.\"\n\n\"You and Hys,\" Telt said with satisfaction. \"Couple of idealists.\nTrying to stop a war you didn't start. They never would listen to\nHys. He told them in the beginning exactly what would happen, and\nhe was right. They always thought his ideas were crooked, like him.\nGrowing up alone in the hill camp, with his back too twisted and too\nold to be fixed when he finally did come out. Ideas twisted the same\nway. Made himself an authority on war. Hah! War on Nyjord--that's\nlike being an ice-cube specialist in hell. But he knew all about it,\nthough they never would let him use what he knew. Put granddaddy\nKrafft in charge instead.\"\n\n\"But Hys is in charge of an army now?\"\n\n\"All volunteers, too few of them and too little money. Too little\nand too damned late to do any good. I'll tell you we did our best,\nbut it could never be good enough. And for this we get called\nbutchers.\" There was a catch in Telt's voice now, an undercurrent of\nemotion he couldn't suppress. \"At home they think we like to kill.\nThink we're insane. They can't understand we're doing the only thing\nthat has to be done--\"\n\nHe broke off as he quickly locked on the brakes and killed the\nengine. The line of sand cars had come to a stop. Ahead, just\nvisible over the dunes, was the summit of a dark tower.\n\n\"We walk from here,\" Telt said, standing and stretching. \"We can\ntake our time, because the other boys go in first, soften things up.\nThen you and I head for the sub-cellar for a radiation check and\nfind you a handsome corpse.\"\n\nWalking at first, then crawling when the dunes no longer shielded\nthem, they crept up on the Disan keep. Dark figures moved ahead of\nthem, stopping only when they reached the crumbling black walls.\nThey didn't use the ascending ramp, but made their way up the sheer\noutside face of the ramparts.\n\n\"Line-throwers,\" Telt whispered. \"Anchor themselves when the missile\nhits, have some kind of quick-setting goo. Then we go up the\nfilament with a line-climbing motor. Hys invented them.\"\n\n\"Is that the way you and I are going in?\" Brion asked.\n\n\"No, we get out of the climbing. I told you we hit this rock once\nbefore. I know the layout inside.\" He was moving while he talked,\ncarefully pacing the distance around the base of the tower. \"Should\nbe right about here.\"\n\nHigh-pitched keening sliced the air and the top of the magter\nbuilding burst into flame. Automatic weapons hammered above them.\nSomething fell silently through the night and hit heavily on the\nground near them.\n\n\"Attack's started,\" Telt shouted. \"We have to get through now,\nwhile all the creepies are fighting it out on top.\" He pulled\na plate-shaped object from one of his bags and slapped it hard\nagainst the wall. It hung there. He twisted the back of it, pulled\nsomething and waved Brion to the ground. \"Shaped charge. Should blow\nstraight in, but you never can tell.\"\n\nThe ground jumped under them and the ringing thud was a giant fist\npunching through the wall. A cloud of dust and smoke rolled clear\nand they could see the dark opening in the rock, a tunnel driven\ninto the wall by the directional force of the explosion. Telt shone\na light through the hole at the crumbled chamber inside.\n\n\"Nothing to worry about from anybody who was leaning against this\nwall. But let's get in and out of this black beehive before the ones\nupstairs come down to investigate.\"\n\nShattered rock was thick on the floor, and they skidded and tumbled\nover it. Telt pointed the way with his light, down a sharply angled\nramp. \"Underground chambers in the rock. They always store their\nstuff down there--\"\n\nA smoking, black sphere arced out of the tunnel's mouth, hitting at\ntheir feet. Telt just gaped, but even as it hit the floor Brion was\njumping forward. He caught it with the side of his foot, kicking it\nback into the dark opening of the tunnel. Telt hit the ground next\nto him as the orange flame of an explosion burst below. Bits of\nshrapnel rattled from the ceiling and wall behind them.\n\n\"Grenades!\" Telt gasped. \"They've only used them once before--can't\nhave many. Gotta warn Hys.\" He plugged a throat mike into the\ntransmitter on his tack and spoke quickly into it. There was a\nstirring below and Brion poured a rain of fire into the tunnel.\n\n\"They're catching it bad on top, too! We gotta pull out. Go first\nand I'll cover you.\"\n\n\"I came for my Disan--I'm not leaving until I get one.\"\n\n\"You're crazy! You're dead if you stay!\"\n\nTelt was scrambling back towards the crumbled entrance as he talked.\nHis back was turned when Brion fired. The magter had appeared\nsilently as the shadow of death. They charged without a sound,\nrunning with expressionless faces into the bullets. Two died at\nonce, curling and folding; the third one fell at Brion's feet. Shot,\npierced, dying, but not yet dead. Leaving a crimson track, it\nhunched closer, lifting its knife to Brion. He didn't move. How many\ntimes must you murder a man? Or was it a man? His mind and body\nrebelled against the killing, and he was almost ready to accept\ndeath himself, rather than kill again.\n\nTelt's bullets tore through the body and it dropped with grim finality.\n\n\"There's your corpse--now get it out of here!\" Telt screeched.\n\nBetween them they worked the sodden weight of the dead magter\nthrough the hole, their exposed backs crawling with the expectation\nof instant death. No further attack came as they ran from the tower,\nother than a grenade that exploded too far behind them to do any\nharm.\n\nOne of the armored sand cars circled the keep, headlights blazing,\nkeeping up a steady fire from its heavy weapons. The attackers\nclimbed into it as they beat a retreat. Telt and Brion dragged\nthe Disan behind them, struggling through the loose sand towards\nthe circling car. Telt glanced over his shoulder and broke into\na shambling run.\n\n\"They're following us!\" he gasped. \"The first time they ever chased\nus after a raid!\"\n\n\"They must know we have the body,\" Brion said.\n\n\"Leave it behind ...\" Telt choked. \"Too heavy to carry ... anyway!\"\n\n\"I'd rather leave you,\" Brion said sharply. \"Let me have it.\" He\npulled the corpse away from the unresisting Telt and heaved it\nacross his own shoulders. \"Now use your gun to cover us!\"\n\nTelt threw a rain of slugs back towards the dark figures following\nthem. The driver of the sand car must have seen the flare of their\nfire, because the truck turned and started towards them. It braked\nin a choking cloud of dust and ready hands reached to pull them up.\nBrion pushed the body in ahead of himself and scrambled after it.\nThe truck engine throbbed and they churned away into the blackness,\naway from the gutted tower.\n\n\"You know, that was more like kind of a joke, when I said I'd leave\nthe corpse behind,\" Telt told Brion. \"You didn't believe me, did\nyou?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Brion said, holding the dead weight of the magter against\nthe truck's side. \"I thought you meant it.\"\n\n\"Ahhh,\" Telt protested, \"you're as bad as Hys. You take things\ntoo seriously.\"\n\nBrion suddenly realized that he was wet with blood, his clothing\nsodden. His stomach rose at the thought and he clutched the edge of\nthe sand car. Killing like this was too personal. Talking\nabstractedly about a body was one thing, but murdering a man, then\nlifting his dead flesh and feeling his blood warm upon you is an\nentirely different matter. But the magter weren't human, he knew\nthat. The thought was only mildly comforting.\n\nAfter they had reached the other waiting sand cars, the raiding\nparty split up. \"Each one goes in a different direction,\" Telt said,\n\"so they can't track us to the base.\" He clipped a piece of paper\nnext to the compass and kicked the motor into life. \"We'll make a\nbig U in the desert and end up in Hovedstad. I got the course here.\nThen I'll dump you and your friends and beat it back to our camp.\nYou're not still burned at me for what I said, are you? Are you?\"\n\nBrion didn't answer. He was staring fixedly out of the side window.\n\n\"What's doing?\" Telt asked. Brion pointed out at the rushing darkness.\n\n\"Over there,\" he said, pointing to the growing light on the horizon.\n\n\"Dawn,\" Telt said. \"Lotta rain on your planet? Didn't you ever see\nthe sun come up before?\"\n\n\"Not on the last day of a world.\"\n\n\"Lock it up,\" Telt grumbled. \"You give me the crawls. I know they're\ngoing to be blasted. But at least I know I did everything I could to\nstop it. How do you think they are going to be feeling at home--on\nNyjord--from tomorrow on?\"\n\n\"Maybe we can still stop it,\" Brion said, shrugging off the feeling\nof gloom. Telt's only answer was a wordless sound of disgust.\n\nBy the time they had cut a large loop in the desert the sun was well\nup in the sky, the daily heat begun. Their course took them through\na chain of low, flinty hills that cut their speed almost to zero.\nThey ground ahead in low gear while Telt sweated and cursed,\nstruggling with the controls. Then they were on firm sand and\npicking up speed towards the city.\n\nAs soon as Brion saw Hovedstad clearly he felt a clutch of fear.\nFrom somewhere in the city a black plume of smoke was rising. It\ncould have been one of the deserted buildings aflame, a minor blaze.\nYet the closer they came, the greater his tension grew. Brion didn't\ndare put it into words himself; it was Telt who vocalized the\nthought.\n\n\"A fire or something. Coming from your area, somewhere close to\nyour building.\"\n\nWithin the city they saw the first signs of destruction. Broken\nrubble on the streets. The smell of greasy smoke in their nostrils.\nMore and more people appeared, going in the same direction they\nwere. The normally deserted streets of Hovedstad were now almost\ncrowded. Disans, obvious by their bare shoulders, mixed with the\nfew offworlders who still remained.\n\nBrion made sure the tarpaulin was well wrapped around the body\nbefore they pushed the sand car slowly through the growing crowd.\n\n\"I don't like all this publicity,\" Telt complained, looking at the\npeople. \"It's the last day, or I'd be turning back. They know our\ncars; we've raided them often enough.\" Turning a corner, he braked\nsuddenly, mouth agape.\n\nAhead was destruction. Black, broken rubble had been churned into\ndesolation. It was still smoking, pink tongues of flame licking over\nthe ruins. A fragment of wall fell with a rumbling crash.\n\n\"It's your building--the Foundation building!\" Telt shouted.\n\"They've been here ahead of us--must have used the radio to call\na raid. They did a job, explosive of some kind.\"\n\nHope was dead. Dis was dead. In the ruin ahead, mixed and broken\nwith other rubble, were the bodies of all the people who had trusted\nhim. Lea ... beautiful and cruelly dead Lea. Doctor Stine, his\npatients, Faussel, all of them. He had kept them on this planet,\nand now they were dead. Every one of them. Dead.\n\nMurderer!\n\n\n\n\nXIV\n\n\nLife was ended. Brion's mind contained nothing but despair and the\npain of irretrievable loss. If his brain had been completely the\nmaster of his body he would have died there, for at that moment\nthere was no will to live. Unaware of this, his heart continued to\nbeat and the regular motion of his lungs drew in the dreadful\nsweetness of the smoke-tainted air. With automatic directness\nhis body lived on.\n\n\"What you gonna do?\" Telt asked, even his natural exuberation\nstilled by this. Brion only shook his head as the words penetrated.\nWhat could he do? What could possibly be done?\n\n\"Follow me,\" a voice said in guttural Disan through the opening of\na rear window. The speaker was lost in the crowd before they could\nturn. Aware now, Brion saw a native move away from the edge of the\ncrowd and turn to look in their direction. It was Ulv.\n\n\"Turn the car--that way!\" He punched Telt's arm and pointed. \"Do it\nslowly and don't draw any attention to us.\" For a moment there was\nhope, which he kept himself from considering. The building was gone,\nand the people in it all dead. That fact had to be faced.\n\n\"What's going on?\" Telt asked. \"Who was that talked in the window?\"\n\n\"A native--that one up ahead. He saved my life in the desert, and\nI think he is on our side. Even though he's a native Disan, he can\nunderstand facts that the magter can't. He knows what will happen\nto this planet.\" Brion was talking to fill his brain with words so\nhe wouldn't begin to have hope. There was no hope possible.\n\nUlv moved slowly and naturally through the streets, never looking\nback. They followed, as far behind as they dared, yet still keeping\nhim in sight. Fewer people were about here among the deserted\noffworld storehouses. Ulv vanished into one of these; LIGHT METALS\nTRUST LTD., the sign read above the door. Telt slowed the car.\n\n\"Don't stop here,\" Brion said. \"Drive around the corner, and pull up.\"\n\nBrion climbed out of the car with an ease he did not feel. No one\nwas in sight now, in either direction. Walking slowly back to the\ncorner, he checked the street they had just left. Hot, silent and\nempty.\n\nA sudden blackness appeared where the door of the warehouse had\nbeen, and the sudden flickering motion of a hand. Brion signaled\nTelt to start, and jumped into the already moving sand car.\n\n\"Into that open door--quickly, before anyone sees us!\" The car\nrumbled down a ramp into the dark interior and the door slid shut\nbehind them.\n\n\"Ulv! What is it? Where are you?\" Brion called, blinking in the\nmurky interior. A grey form appeared beside him.\n\n\"I am here.\"\n\n\"Did you--\" There was no way to finish the sentence.\n\n\"I heard of the raid. The magter called together all of us they\ncould to help them carry explosive. I went along. I could not stop\nthem, and there was no time to warn anyone in the building.\"\n\n\"Then they are all dead?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Ulv nodded. \"All except one. I knew I could perhaps save one;\nI was not sure who. So I took the woman you were with in the\ndesert--she is here now. She was hurt, but not badly, when I brought\nher out.\"\n\nGuilty relief flooded through Brion. He shouldn't exult, not with\nthe death of everyone in the Foundation still fresh in his mind.\nBut at that instant he was happy.\n\n\"Let me see her,\" he said to Ulv. He was seized by the sudden fear\nthat there might be a mistake. Perhaps Ulv had saved a different\nwoman.\n\nUlv led the way across the empty loading bay. Brion followed\nclosely, fighting down the temptation to tell him to hurry. When he\nsaw that Ulv was heading towards an office in the far wall, he could\ncontrol himself no longer and ran on ahead.\n\nIt was Lea, lying unconscious on a couch. Sweat beaded her face and\nshe moaned and stirred without opening her eyes.\n\n\"I gave her _sover_, then wrapped her in cloth so no one would\nknow,\" Ulv said.\n\nTelt was close behind them, looking in through the open door.\n\n\"_Sover_ is a drug they take from one of their plants,\" he said.\n\"We got a lot of experience with it. A little makes a good knock-out\ndrug, but it's deadly poison in large doses. I got the antidote in\nthe car; wait and I'll get it.\" He went out.\n\nBrion sat next to Lea and wiped her face clean of dirt and\nperspiration. The dark shadows under her eyes were almost black now\nand her elfin face seemed even thinner. But she was alive--that was\nthe important thing.\n\nSome of the tension drained away from Brion and he could think\nagain. There was still the job to do. After this last experience Lea\nshould be in a hospital bed. But this was impossible. He would have\nto drag her to her feet and put her back to work. The answer might\nstill be found. Each second ticked away another fraction of the\nplanet's life.\n\n\"Good as new in a minute,\" Telt said, banging down the heavy med\nbox. He watched intently as Ulv left the room. \"Hys should\nknow about this renegade. Might be useful as a spy, or for\ninformation--though of course it's too late now to do anything, so\nthe hell with it.\" He pulled a pistol-shaped hypodermic gun from the\nbox and dialed a number on the side. \"Now, if you'll roll her sleeve\nup I'll bring her back to life.\" He pressed the bell-shaped\nsterilizing muzzle against her skin and pulled the trigger. The hypo\ngun hummed briefly, ending its cycle with a loud click.\n\n\"Does it work fast?\" Brion asked.\n\n\"Couple of minutes. Just let her be and she'll come to by herself.\"\n\nUlv was in the doorway. \"Killer!\" he hissed. His blowgun was in his\nhand, half raised to his mouth.\n\n\"He's been in the car--he's seen it!\" Telt shouted and grabbed for\nhis gun.\n\nBrion sprang between them, raising his hands. \"Stop it! No more\nkilling!\" he shouted in Disan. Then he shook his fist at Telt.\n\"Fire that gun and I'll stuff it down your throat. I'll handle this.\"\nHe turned to face Ulv, who hadn't brought the blowgun any closer to\nhis lips. This was a good sign--the Disan was still uncertain.\n\n\"You have seen the body in the car, Ulv. So you must have seen that\nit is that of a magter. I killed him myself, because I would rather\nkill one, or ten, or even a hundred men than have everyone on this\nplanet destroyed. I killed him in a fair fight and now I am going\nto examine his body. There is something very strange and different\nabout the magter, you know that yourself. If I can find out what it\nis, perhaps we can make them stop this war, and not bomb Nyjord.\"\n\nUlv was still angry, but he lowered the blowgun a little. \"I wish\nthere were no offworlders,\" he said. \"I wish that none of you had\never come. Nothing was wrong until you started coming. The magter\nwere the strongest, and they killed; but they also helped. Now they\nwant to fight a war with your weapons, and for this you are going to\nkill my world. And you want me to help you!\"\n\n\"Not me--yourself!\" Brion said wearily. \"There's no going back,\nthat's the one thing we can't do. Maybe Dis would have been better\noff without offplanet contact. Maybe not. In any case, you have to\nforget about that. You have contact now with the rest of the galaxy,\nfor better or for worse. You've got a problem to solve, and I'm here\nto help you solve it.\"\n\nSeconds ticked by as Ulv, unmoving, fought with questions that were\nnovel to his life. Could killing stop death? Could he help his\npeople by helping strangers to fight and kill them? His world had\nchanged and he didn't like it. He must make a giant effort to change\nwith it.\n\nAbruptly, he pushed the blowgun into a thong at his waist, turned\nand strode out.\n\n\"Too much for my nerves,\" Telt said, settling his gun back in the\nholster. \"You don't know how happy I'm gonna be when this whole damn\nthing is over. Even if the planet goes bang, I don't care. I'm\nfinished.\" He walked out to the sand car, keeping a careful eye\non the Disan crouched against the wall.\n\nBrion turned back to Lea, whose eyes were open, staring at the\nceiling. He went to her.\n\n\"Running,\" she said, and her voice had a toneless emptiness that\nscreamed louder than any emotion. \"They ran by the open door of my\nroom and I could see them when they killed Dr. Stine. Just butchered\nhim like an animal, chopping him down. Then one came into the room\nand that's all I remember.\" She turned her head slowly and looked at\nBrion. \"What happened? Why am I here?\"\n\n\"They're ... dead,\" he told her. \"All of them. After the raid the\nDisans blew up the building. You're the only one that survived.\nThat was Ulv who came into your room, the Disan we met in the desert.\nHe brought you away and hid you here in the city.\"\n\n\"When do we leave?\" she asked in the same empty tones, turning\nher face to the wall. \"When do we get off this planet?\"\n\n\"Today is the last day. The deadline is midnight. Krafft will have\na ship pick us up when we are ready. But we still have our job to do.\nI've got that body. You're going to have to examine it. We must\nfind out about the magter....\"\n\n\"Nothing can be done now except leave.\" Her voice was a dull\nmonotone. \"There is only so much that a person can do, and I've done\nit. Please have the ship come; I want to leave now.\"\n\nBrion bit his lip in helpless frustration. Nothing seemed to\npenetrate the apathy into which she had sunk. Too much shock, too\nmuch terror, in too short a time. He took her chin in his hand and\nturned her head to face him. She didn't resist, but her eyes were\nshining with tears; tears trickled down her cheeks.\n\n\"Take me home, Brion, please take me home.\"\n\nHe could only brush her sodden hair back from her face, and force\nhimself to smile at her. The moments of time were running out,\nfaster and faster, and he no longer knew what to do. The examination\nhad to be made--yet he couldn't force her. He looked for the med box\nand saw that Telt had taken it back to the sand car. There might be\nsomething in it that could help--a tranquilizer perhaps.\n\nTelt had some of his instruments open on the chart table and was\nexamining a tape with a pocket magnifier when Brion entered. He\njumped nervously and put the tape behind his back, then relaxed when\nhe saw who it was.\n\n\"I thought you were the creepie out there, coming for a look,\" he\nwhispered. \"Maybe you trust him--but I can't afford to. Can't even\nuse the radio. I'm getting out of here now. I have to tell Hys!\"\n\n\"Tell him what?\" Brion asked sharply. \"What is all the mystery\nabout?\"\n\nTelt handed him the magnifier and tape. \"Look at that--recording\ntape from my scintillation counter. Red verticals are five-minute\nintervals, the wiggly black horizontal line is the radioactivity\nlevel. All this where the line goes up and down, that's when we were\ndriving out to the attack. Varying hot level of the rock and\nground.\"\n\n\"What's the big peak in the middle?\"\n\n\"That coincides exactly with our visit to the house of horrors!\nWhen we went through the hole in the bottom of the tower!\" He\ncouldn't keep the excitement out of his voice.\n\n\"Does it mean that....\"\n\n\"I don't know. I'm not sure. I have to compare it with the other\ntapes back at base. It could be the stone of the tower--some of\nthese heavy rocks have got a high natural count. There maybe could\nbe a box of instruments there with fluorescent dials. Or it might be\none of those tactical atom bombs they threw at us already. Some arms\nrunner sold them a few.\"\n\n\"Or it could be the cobalt bombs?\"\n\n\"It could be,\" Telt said, packing his instruments swiftly. \"A badly\nshielded bomb, or an old one with a crack in the skin, could give\na trace like that. Just a little radon leaking out would do it.\"\n\n\"Why don't you call Hys on the radio and let him know?\"\n\n\"I don't want Granddaddy Krafft's listening posts to hear about it.\nThis is our job--if I'm right. And I have to check my old tapes to\nmake sure. But it's gonna be worth a raid, I can feel that in my\nbones. Let's unload your corpse.\" He helped Brion with the clumsy,\nwrapped bundle, then slipped into the driver's seat.\n\n\"Hold it,\" Brion said. \"Do you have anything in the med box I can\nuse for Lea? She seems to have cracked. Not hysterical, but\nwithdrawn. Won't listen to reason, won't do anything but lie there\nand ask to go home.\"\n\n\"Got the potion here,\" Telt said, cracking the med box.\n\"Slaughter-syndrome is what our medic calls it. Hit a lot of our\nboys. Grow up all your life hating the idea of violence, and it goes\nrough when you have to start killing people. Guys break up, break\ndown, go to pieces lots of different ways. The medic mixed up this\nstuff. Don't know how it works, probably tranquilizers and some of\nthe cortex drugs. But it peels off recent memories. Maybe for the\nlast ten, twelve hours. You can't get upset about what you don't\nremember.\" He pulled out a sealed package. \"Directions on the box.\nGood luck.\"\n\n\"Luck,\" Brion said, and shook the technician's calloused hand.\n\"Let me know if the traces are strong enough to be bombs.\" He checked\nthe street to make sure it was clear, then pressed the door button.\nThe sand car churned out into the brilliant sunshine and was gone,\nthe throb of its motor dying in the distance. Brion closed the door\nand went back to Lea. Ulv was still crouched against the wall.\n\nThere was a one-shot disposable hypodermic in the box. Lea made\nno protest when he broke the seal and pressed the needle against\nher arm. She sighed and her eyes closed again.\n\nWhen he saw she was resting easily, he dragged in the\ntarpaulin-wrapped body of the magter. A work-bench ran along one\nwall and he struggled the corpse up onto it. He unwrapped the\ntarpaulin and the sightless eyes stared accusingly up into his.\n\nUsing his knife, Brion cut away the loose, blood-soaked clothing.\nStrapped under the clothes, around the man's waist, was the familiar\ncollection of Disan artifacts. This could have significance either\nway. Human or humanoid, the creature would still have to live on\nDis. Brion threw it aside, along with the clothing. Nude, pierced,\nbloody, the corpse lay before him.\n\nIn every external physical detail the man was human.\n\nBrion's theory was becoming more preposterous with each discovery.\nIf the magter weren't alien, how could he explain their complete lack\nof emotions? A mutation of some kind? He didn't see how it was\npossible. There _had_ to be something alien about the dead man\nbefore him. The future of a world rested on this flimsy hope. If\nTelt's lead to the bombs proved to be false, there would be no hope\nleft at all.\n\nLea was still unconscious when he looked at her again. There was no\nway of telling how long the coma would last. He would probably have\nto waken her out of it, but he didn't want to do it too early. It\ntook an effort to control his impatience, even though he knew the\ndrug needed time in which to work. He finally decided on at least a\nminimum of an hour before he should try to disturb her. That would\nbe noon--twelve hours before destruction.\n\nOne thing he should do was to get in touch with Professor-Commander\nKrafft. Maybe it was being defeatist, but he had to make sure that\nthey had a way off this planet if the mission failed. Krafft had\ninstalled a relay radio that would forward calls from his personal\nset. If this relay had been in the Foundation building, contact was\nbroken. This had to be found out before it was too late. Brion\nthumbed on his radio and sent the call. The reply came back\ninstantly.\n\n\"This is fleet communications. Will you please keep this circuit\nopen? Commander Krafft is waiting for this call and it is being put\ndirectly through to him now.\" Krafft's voice broke in while the\noperator was still talking.\n\n\"Who is making this call--is it anyone from the Foundation?\"\nThe old man's voice was shaky with emotion.\n\n\"Brandd here. I have Lea Morees with me....\"\n\n\"No more? Are there no other survivors from the disaster that\ndestroyed your building?\"\n\n\"That's it, other than us it's a ... complete loss. With the\nbuilding and all the instruments gone, I have no way to contact our\nship in orbit. Can you arrange to get us out of here if necessary?\"\n\n\"Give me your location. A ship is coming now--\"\n\n\"I don't need a ship now,\" Brion interrupted. \"Don't send it until\nI call. If there is a way to stop your destruction I'll find it.\nSo I'm staying--to the last minute if necessary.\"\n\nKrafft was silent. There was only the crackle of an open mike and\nthe sound of breathing. \"That is your decision,\" he said finally.\n\"I'll have a ship standing by. But won't you let us take Miss Morees\nout now?\"\n\n\"No. I need her here. We are still working, looking for--\"\n\n\"What answer can you find that could possibly avert destruction\nnow?\" His tone was between hope and despair. Brion couldn't help\nhim.\n\n\"If I succeed--you'll know. Otherwise, that will be the end of it.\nEnd of Transmission.\" He switched the radio off.\n\nLea was sleeping easily when he looked at her, and there was still\na good part of the hour left before he could wake her. How could\nhe put it to use? She would need tools, instruments to examine the\ncorpse, and there were certainly none here. Perhaps he could find\nsome in the ruins of the Foundation building. With this thought\nhe had the sudden desire to see the wreckage up close. There might\nbe other survivors. He had to find out. If he could talk to the men\nhe had seen working there....\n\nUlv was still crouched against the wall in the outer room.\nHe looked up angrily when Brion came over, but said nothing.\n\n\"Will you help me again?\" Brion asked. \"Stay and watch the girl\nwhile I go out. I'll be back at noon.\" Ulv didn't answer. \"I am\nstill looking for the way to save Dis,\" Brion added.\n\n\"Go--I'll watch the girl!\" Ulv spat words in impotent fury. \"I do\nnot know what to do. You may be right. Go. She will be safe with me.\"\n\nBrion slipped out into the deserted street and, half running, half\nwalking, made his way towards the rubble that had been the Cultural\nRelationships Foundation. He used a different course from the one\nthey had come by, striking first towards the outer edge of the city.\nOnce there, he could swing and approach from the other side, so\nthere would be no indication where he had come from. The magter\nmight be watching and he didn't want to lead them to Lea and the\nstolen body.\n\nTurning a corner, he saw a sand car stopped in the street ahead.\nThere was something familiar about the lines of it. It could be the\none he and Telt had used, but he wasn't sure. He looked around, but\nthe dusty, packed-dirt street was white and empty, shimmering in\nsilence under the sun. Staying close to the wall and watching\ncarefully, Brion slipped towards the car. When he came close behind\nit he was positive it was the one he had been in the night before.\nWhat was it doing here?\n\nSilence and heat filled the street. Windows and doors were empty,\nand there was no motion in their shadows. Putting his foot on a\nbogey wheel, he reached up and grabbed the searing metal rim of the\nopen window. He pulled himself up and stared at Telt's smiling face.\n\nSmiling in death. The lips pulled back to reveal the grinning teeth,\nthe eyes bursting from the head, the features swollen and contorted\nfrom the deadly poison. A tiny, tufted dart of wood stuck in the\nbrown flesh on the side of his neck.\n\n\n\n\nXV\n\n\nBrion hurled himself backward and sprawled flat in the dust and\nfilth of the road. No poison dart sought him out; the empty silence\nstill reigned. Telt's murderers had come and gone. Moving quickly,\nusing the bulk of the car as a shield, he opened the door and\nslipped inside.\n\nThey had done a thorough job of destruction. All of the controls had\nbeen battered into uselessness, the floor was a junk heap of crushed\nequipment, intertwined with loops of recording tape bulging like\nmechanical intestines. A gutted machine, destroyed like its driver.\n\nIt was easy enough to reconstruct what had happened. The car had\nbeen seen when they entered the city--probably by some of the magter\nwho had destroyed the Foundation building. They had not seen where\nit had gone, or Brion would surely be dead by now. But they must\nhave spotted it when Telt tried to leave the city--and stopped it in\nthe most effective way possible, a dart through the open window into\nthe unsuspecting driver's neck.\n\nTelt dead! The brutal impact of the man's death had driven all\nthought of its consequences from Brion's mind. Now he began to\nrealize. Telt had never sent word of his discovery of the\nradioactive trace to the Nyjord army. He had been afraid to use\nthe radio, and had wanted to tell Hys in person, and to show him\nthe tape. Only now the tape was torn and mixed with all the others,\nthe brain that could have analyzed it dead.\n\nBrion looked at the dangling entrails of the radio and spun for the\ndoor. Running swiftly and erratically, he fled from the sand car.\nHis own survival and the possible survival of Dis depended on his\nnot being seen near it. He must contact Hys and pass on the\ninformation. Until he did that, he was the only offworlder on Dis\nwho knew which magter tower might contain the world-destroying\nbombs.\n\nOnce out of sight of the sand car he went more slowly, wiping the\nsweat from his streaming face. He hadn't been seen leaving the car,\nand he wasn't being followed. The streets here weren't familiar, but\nhe checked his direction by the sun and walked at a steady fast pace\ntowards the destroyed building. More of the native Disans were in\nthe streets now. They all noticed him, some even stopped and scowled\nfiercely at him. With his emphatic awareness he felt their anger and\nhatred. A knot of men radiated death, and he put his hand on his gun\nas he passed them. Two of them had their blowguns ready, but didn't\nuse them. By the time he had turned the next corner he was soaked\nwith nervous perspiration.\n\nAhead was the rubble of the destroyed building. Grounded next to it\nwas the tapered form of a spacer's pinnace. Two men had come from\nthe open lock and were standing at the edge of the burnt area.\n\nBrion's boots grated loudly on the broken wreckage. The men turned\nquickly towards him, guns raised. Both of them carried ion rifles.\nThey relaxed when they saw his offworld clothes.\n\n\"Bloody damned savages!\" one of them growled. He was a heavy-planet\nman, a squashed-down column of muscle and gristle, whose head barely\nreached Brion's chest. A pushed-back cap had the crossed slide-rule\nsymbol of ship's computer man.\n\n\"Can't blame them, I guess,\" the second man said. He wore purser's\ninsignia. His features were different, but with the same compacted\nbody the two men were as physically alike as twins. Probably from\nthe same home planet. \"They're gonna get their whole world blown out\nfrom under them at midnight. Looks as if the poor slob in the\nstreets finally realized what is happening. Hope we're in jump-space\nby then. I saw Estrada's World get it, and I don't want to see that\nagain, not twice in one lifetime!\"\n\nThe computer man was looking closely at Brion, head tilted sideways\nto see his face. \"You need transportation offworld?\" he asked.\n\"We're the last ship at the port, and we're going to boil out of\nhere as soon as the rest of our cargo is aboard. We'll give you\na lift if you need it.\"\n\nOnly by a tremendous effort at control did Brion conceal the\ndestroying sorrow that overwhelmed him when he looked at that\nshattered wasteland, the graveyard of so many. \"No,\" he said.\n\"That won't be necessary. I'm in touch with the blockading fleet\nand they'll pick me up before midnight.\"\n\n\"You from Nyjord?\" the purser growled.\n\n\"No,\" Brion said, still only half aware of the men. \"But there is\ntrouble with my own ship.\" He realized that they were looking\nintently at him, that he owed them some kind of explanation.\n\"I thought I could find a way to stop the war. Now ... I'm not so\nsure.\" He hadn't intended to be so frank with the spacemen, but the\nwords had been uppermost in his thoughts and had simply slipped out.\n\nThe computer man started to say something, but his shipmate speared\nhim in the side with his elbow. \"We blast soon--and I don't like the\nway these Disans are looking at us. The captain said to find out\nwhat caused the fire, then get the hell back. So let's go.\"\n\n\"Don't miss your ship,\" the computer man said to Brion, and\nhe started for the pinnace. Then he hesitated and turned. \"Sure\nthere's nothing we can do for you?\"\n\nSorrow would accomplish nothing. Brion fought to sweep the dregs\nof emotion from his mind and to think clearly. \"You can help me,\"\nhe said. \"I could use a scalpel or any other surgical instrument\nyou might have.\" Lea would need those. Then he remembered Telt's\nundelivered message. \"Do you have a portable radio transceiver?\nI can pay you for it.\"\n\nThe computer man vanished inside the rocket and reappeared a minute\nlater with a small package. \"There's a scalpel and a magnetized\ntweezers in here--all I could find in the med kit. Hope they'll do.\"\nHe reached inside and swung out the metal case of a self-contained\ntransceiver. \"Take this, it's got plenty of range, even on the\nlonger frequencies.\"\n\nHe raised his hand at Brion's offer to pay. \"My donation,\" he said.\n\"If you can save this planet I'll give you the whole pinnace as\nwell. We'll tell the captain we lost the radio in some trouble with\nthe natives. Isn't that right, Moneybags?\" He prodded the purser\nin the chest with a finger that would have punched a hole through\na weaker man.\n\n\"I read you loud and clear,\" the purser said. \"I'll make out an\ninvoice so stating, back in the ship.\" They were both in the pinnace\nthen, and Brion had to move fast to get clear of the takeoff blast.\n\nA sense of obligation--the spacemen had felt it too. The realization\nof this raised Brion's spirits a bit as he searched through the\nrubble for anything useful. He recognized part of a wall still\nstanding as a corner of the laboratory. Poking through the ruins, he\nunearthed broken instruments and a single, battered case that had\nbarely missed destruction. Inside was the binocular microscope, the\nright tube bent, its lenses cracked and obscured. The left eyepiece\nstill seemed to be functioning. Brion carefully put it back in the\ncase.\n\nHe looked at his watch. It was almost noon. These few pieces of\nequipment would have to do for the dissection. Watched suspiciously\nby the onlooking Disans, he started back to the warehouse. It was a\nlong, circuitous walk, since he didn't dare give any clues to his\ndestination. Only when he was positive he had not been observed or\nfollowed did he slip through the building's entrance, locking the\ndoor behind him.\n\nLea's frightened eyes met his when he went into the office. \"A\nfriendly smile here among the cannibals,\" she called. Her strained\nexpression gave the lie to the cheeriness of her words. \"What has\nhappened? Since I woke up, the great stone face over there\"--she\npointed to Ulv--\"has been telling me exactly nothing.\"\n\n\"What's the last thing you can remember?\" Brion asked carefully.\nHe didn't want to tell her too much, lest this bring on the shock\nagain. Ulv had shown great presence of mind in not talking to her.\n\n\"If you must know,\" Lea said, \"I remember quite a lot, Brion Brandd.\nI shan't go into details, since this sort of thing is best kept from\nthe natives. For the record then, I can recall going to sleep after\nyou left. And nothing since then. It's weird. I went to sleep in\nthat lumpy hospital bed and woke up on this couch, feeling simply\nterrible. With _him_ just sitting there and scowling at me. Won't\nyou please tell me what is going on?\"\n\nA partial truth was best, saving all of the details that he could\nfor later. \"The magter attacked the Foundation building,\" he said.\n\"They are getting angry at all offworlders now. You were still\nknocked out by a sleeping drug, so Ulv helped bring you here. It's\nafternoon now--\"\n\n\"Of the last day?\" She sounded horrified. \"While I'm playing\nSleeping Beauty the world is coming to an end! Was anyone hurt\nin the attack? Or killed?\"\n\n\"There were a number of casualties--and plenty of trouble,\" Brion\nsaid. He had to get her off the subject. Walking over to the corpse,\nhe threw back the cover from its face. \"But this is more important\nright now. It's one of the magter. I have a scalpel and some other\nthings here--will you perform an autopsy?\"\n\nLea huddled back on the couch, her arms around herself, looking\nchilled in spite of the heat of the day. \"What happened to the\npeople at the building?\" she asked in a thin voice. The injection\nhad removed her memories of the tragedy, but echoes of the strain\nand shock still reverberated in her mind and body. \"I feel so ...\nexhausted. Please tell me what happened. I have the feeling you're\nhiding something.\"\n\nBrion sat next to her and took her hands in his, not surprised to\nfind them cold. Looking into her eyes, he tried to give her some of\nhis strength. \"It wasn't very nice,\" he said. \"You were shaken up by\nit, I imagine that's why you feel the way you do now. But--Lea,\nyou'll have to take my word for this. Don't ask any more questions.\nThere's nothing we can do now about it. But we can still find out\nabout the magter. Will you examine the corpse?\"\n\nShe started to ask something, then changed her mind. When she\ndropped her eyes Brion felt the thin shiver that went through her\nbody. \"There's something terribly wrong,\" she said. \"I know that.\nI guess I'll have to take your word that it's best not to ask\nquestions. Help me up, will you, darling? My legs are absolutely\nliquid.\"\n\nLeaning on him, with his arm around her supporting most of her\nweight, she went slowly across to the corpse. She looked down and\nshuddered. \"Not what you would call a natural death,\" she said.\nUlv watched intently as she took the scalpel out of its holder.\n\"You don't have to look at this,\" she told him in halting Disan.\n\"Not if you don't want to.\"\n\n\"I want to,\" he told her, not taking his eyes from the body.\n\"I have never seen a magter dead before, or without covering,\nlike an ordinary person.\" He continued to stare fixedly.\n\n\"Find me some drinking water, will you, Brion?\" Lea said. \"And\nspread the tarp under the body. These things are quite messy.\"\n\nAfter drinking the water she seemed stronger, and could stand\nwithout holding onto the table with both hands. Placing the tip of\nthe scalpel just below the magter's breast bone, she made the long\npost-mortem incision down to the pubic symphysis. The great,\nbody-length wound gaped open like a red mouth. Across the table Ulv\nshuddered but didn't avert his eyes.\n\nOne by one she removed the internal organs. Once she looked up at\nBrion, then quickly returned to work. The silence stretched on and\non until Brion had to break it.\n\n\"Tell me, can't you? Have you found out anything?\"\n\nHis words snapped the thin strand of her strength, and she staggered\nback to the couch and collapsed onto it. Her bloodstained hands hung\nover the side, making a strangely terrible contrast to the whiteness\nof her skin.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Brion,\" she said. \"But there's nothing, nothing at all.\nThere are minor differences, organic changes I've never seen\nbefore--his liver is tremendous, for one thing. But changes like\nthis are certainly consistent within the pattern of homo sapiens\nas adapted to a different planet. He's a man. Changed, adapted,\nmodified--but still just as human as you or I.\"\n\n\"How can you be sure?\" Brion broke in. \"You haven't examined him\ncompletely, have you?\" She shook her head. \"Then go on. The other\norgans. His brain. A microscopic examination. Here!\" he said,\npushing the microscope case towards her with both hands.\n\nShe dropped her head onto her forearms and sobbed. \"Leave me alone,\ncan't you! I'm tired and sick and fed up with this awful planet. Let\nthem die. I don't care! Your theory is false, useless. Admit that!\nAnd let me wash the filth from my hands....\" Sobbing drowned out her\nwords.\n\nBrion stood over her and drew a shuddering breath. Was he wrong? He\ndidn't dare think about that. He had to go on. Looking down at the\nthinness of her bent back, with the tiny projections of her spine\nshowing through the thin cloth, he felt an immense pity--a pity he\ncouldn't surrender to. This thin, helpless, frightened woman was\nhis only resource. She had to work. He had to _make_ her work.\n\nIhjel had done it--used projective empathy to impress his emotions\nupon Brion. Now Brion must do it with Lea. He had had some sessions\nin the art, but not nearly enough to make him proficient.\nNevertheless he had to try.\n\nStrength was what Lea needed. Aloud he said simply, \"You can do it.\nYou have the will and the strength to finish.\" And silently his mind\ncried out the order to obey, to share his power now that hers was\ndrained and finished.\n\nOnly when she lifted her face and he saw the dried tears did he\nrealize that he had succeeded. \"You will go on?\" he asked quietly.\n\nLea merely nodded and rose to her feet. She shuffled like a\nsleepwalker jerked along by invisible strings. Her strength wasn't\nher own, and the situation reminded him unhappily of that last event\nof the Twenties when he had experienced the same kind of draining\nactivity. She wiped her hands roughly on her clothes and opened\nthe microscope case.\n\n\"The slides are all broken,\" she said.\n\n\"This will do,\" Brion told her, crashing his heel through the glass\npartition. Shards tinkled and crashed to the floor. He took some of\nthe bigger pieces and broke them to rough squares that would fit\nunder the clips on the stage. Lea accepted them without a word.\nPutting a drop of the magter's blood on the slide, she bent over the\neyepiece.\n\nHer hands shook when she tried to adjust the focusing. Using low\npower, she examined the specimen, squinting through the angled tube.\nOnce she turned the sub-stage mirror a bit to catch the light\nstreaming in the window. Brion stood behind her, fists clenched,\nforceably controlling his anxiety. \"What do you see?\" he finally\nblurted out.\n\n\"Phagocytes, platelets ... leucocytes ... everything seems normal.\"\nHer voice was dull, exhausted, her eyes blinking with fatigue as\nshe stared into the tube.\n\nAnger at defeat burned through Brion. Even faced with failure, he\nrefused to accept it. He reached over her shoulder and savagely\ntwisted the turret of microscope until the longest lens was in\nposition. \"If you can't see anything--try the high power! It's\nthere--I know it's there! I'll get you a tissue specimen.\"\nHe turned back to the disemboweled cadaver.\n\nHis back was turned and he did not see that sudden stiffening of her\nshoulders, or the sudden eagerness that seized her fingers as they\nadjusted the focus. But he did feel the wave of emotion that welled\nfrom her, impinging directly on his empathetic sense. \"What is it?\"\nhe called to her, as if she had spoken aloud.\n\n\"Something ... something here,\" she said, \"in this leucocyte. It's\nnot normal structure, but it's familiar. I've seen something like it\nbefore, but I just can't remember.\" She turned away from the\nmicroscope and unthinkingly pressed her gory knuckles to her\nforehead. \"I know I've seen it before.\"\n\nBrion squinted into the deserted microscope and made out a dim shape\nin the center of the field. It stood out sharply when he\nfocused--the white, jellyfish shape of a single-celled leucocyte. To\nhis untrained eye there was nothing unusual about it. He couldn't\nknow what was strange, when he had no idea of what was normal.\n\n\"Do you see those spherical green shapes grouped together?\" Lea\nasked. Before Brion could answer she gasped, \"I remember now!\" Her\nfatigue was forgotten in her excitement. \"_Icerya purchasi_, that\nwas the name, something like that. It's a coccid, a little scale\ninsect. It had those same shapes collected together within its\nindividual cells.\"\n\n\"What do they mean? What is the connection with Dis?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" she said; \"it's just that they look so similar. And\nI never saw anything like this in a human cell before. In the\ncoccids, the green particles grow into a kind of yeast that lives\nwithin the insect. Not a parasite, but a real symbiote....\"\n\nHer eyes opened wide as she caught the significance of her own\nwords. A symbiote--and Dis was the world where symbiosis and\nparasitism had become more advanced and complex than on any other\nplanet. Lea's thoughts spun around this fact and chewed at the\nfringes of the logic. Brion could sense her concentration and\nabsorption. He did nothing to break the mood. Her hands were\nclenched, her eyes staring unseeingly at the wall as her mind raced.\n\nBrion and Ulv were quiet, watching her, waiting for her conclusions.\nThe pieces were falling into shape at last.\n\nLea opened her clenched hands and smoothed them on her sodden skirt.\nShe blinked and turned to Brion. \"Is there a tool box here?\" she asked.\n\nHer words were so unexpected that Brion could not answer for a\nmoment. Before he could say anything she spoke again.\n\n\"Not hand tools; that would take too long. Could you find anything\nlike a power saw? That would be ideal.\" She turned back to the\nmicroscope, and he didn't try to question her. Ulv was still looking\nat the body of the magter and had understood nothing of what they\nhad said.\n\nBrion went out into the loading bay. There was nothing he could use\non the ground floor, so he took the stairs to the floor above. A\ncorridor here passed by a number of rooms. All of the doors were\nlocked, including one with the hopeful sign TOOL ROOM on it. He\nbattered at the metal door with his shoulder without budging it. As\nhe stepped back to look for another way in, he glanced at his watch.\n\nTwo o'clock! In ten hours the bombs would fall on Dis.\n\nThe need for haste tore at him. Yet there could be no noise--someone\nin the street might hear it. He quickly stripped off his shirt and\nwrapped it in a loose roll around the barrel of his gun, extending\nit in a loose tube in front of the barrel. Holding the rolled cloth\nin his left hand, he jammed the gun up tight against the door, the\nmuzzle against the lock. The single shot was only a dull thud,\ninaudible outside of the building. Pieces of broken mechanism jarred\nand rattled inside the lock and the door swung open.\n\nWhen he came back Lea was standing by the body. He held the small\npower saw with a rotary blade. \"Will this do?\" he asked. \"Runs on\nits own battery; almost fully charged too.\"\n\n\"Perfect,\" she answered. \"You're both going to have to help me.\" She\nswitched into the Disan language. \"Ulv, would you find some place\nwhere you can watch the street without being seen? Signal me when\nit is empty. I'm afraid this saw is going to make a lot of noise.\"\n\nUlv nodded and went out into the bay, where he climbed a heap of\nempty crates so he could peer through the small windows set high in\nthe wall. He looked carefully in both directions, then waved to her\nto go ahead.\n\n\"Stand to one side and hold the cadaver's chin, Brion,\" she said.\n\"Hold it firmly so the head doesn't shake around when I cut. This\nis going to be a little gruesome. I'm sorry. But it'll be the\nfastest way to cut the bone.\" The saw bit into the skull.\n\nOnce Ulv waved them into silence, and shrank back himself into the\nshadows next to the window. They waited impatiently until he gave\nthem the sign to continue again. Brion held steady while the saw\ncut a circle completely around the skull.\n\n\"Finished,\" Lea said and the saw dropped from her limp fingers to\nthe floor. She massaged life back into her hands before she finished\nthe job. Carefully and delicately she removed the cap of bone from\nthe magter's head, exposing his brain to the shaft of light from\nthe window.\n\n\"You were right all the time, Brion,\" she said. \"There is your alien.\"\n\n\n\n\nXVI\n\n\nUlv joined them as they looked down at the exposed brain of the\nmagter. The thing was so clearly evident that even Ulv noticed it.\n\n\"I have seen dead animals and my people dead with their heads open,\nbut I have never seen anything like that before,\" he said.\n\n\"What is it?\" Brion asked.\n\n\"The invader, the alien you were looking for,\" Lea told him.\n\nThe magter's brain was only two-thirds of what would have been its\nnormal size. Instead of filling the skull completely, it shared the\nspace with a green, amorphous shape. This was ridged somewhat like a\nbrain, but the green shape had still darker nodules and extensions.\nLea took her scalpel and gently prodded the dark moist mass.\n\n\"It reminds me very much of something that I've seen before on\nEarth,\" she said. \"The green-fly--_Drepanosiphum platanoides_--and\nan unusual organ it has, called the pseudova. Now that I have seen\nthis growth in the magter's skull, I can think of a positive\nparallel. The fly _Drepanosiphum_ also had a large green organ, only\nit fills half of the body cavity instead of the head. Its identity\npuzzled biologists for years, and they had a number of complex\ntheories to explain it. Finally someone managed to dissect and\nexamine it. The pseudova turned out to be a living plant, a\nyeastlike growth that helps with the green-fly's digestion. It\nproduces enzymes that enable the fly to digest the great amounts\nof sugar it gets from plant juice.\"\n\n\"That's not unusual,\" Brion said, puzzled. \"Termites and human\nbeings are a couple of other creatures whose digestion is helped\nby internal flora. What's the difference in the green-fly?\"\n\n\"Reproduction, mainly. All the other gut-living plants have to enter\nthe host and establish themselves as outsiders, permitted to remain\nas long as they are useful. The green-fly and its yeast plant have a\npermanent symbiotic relationship that is essential to the existence\nof both. The plant spores appear in many places throughout the fly's\nbody--but they are _always_ in the germ cells. Every egg cell has\nsome, and every egg that grows to maturity is infected with the\nplant spores. The continuation of the symbiosis is unbroken and\nguaranteed.\"\n\n\"Do you think those green spheres in the magter's blood cells could\nbe the same kind of thing?\" Brion asked.\n\n\"I'm sure of it,\" Lea said. \"It must be the same process. There are\nprobably green spheres throughout the magters' bodies, spores or\noffspring of those things in their brains. Enough will find their\nway to the germ cells to make sure that every young magter is\ninfected at birth. While the child is growing, so is the symbiote.\nProbably a lot faster, since it seems to be a simpler organism.\nI imagine it is well established in the brain pan within the first\nsix months of the infant's life.\"\n\n\"But why?\" Brion asked. \"What does it do?\"\n\n\"I'm only guessing now, but there is plenty of evidence that gives\nus an idea of its function. I'm willing to bet that the symbiote\nitself is not a simple organism, it's probably an amalgam of plant\nand animal like most of the other creatures on Dis. The thing is\njust too complex to have developed since mankind has been on this\nplanet. The magter must have caught the symbiotic infection eating\nsome Disan animal. The symbiote lived and flourished in its new\nenvironment, well protected by a bony skull in a long-lived host.\nIn exchange for food, oxygen and comfort, the brain-symbiote must\ngenerate hormones and enzymes that enable the magter to survive.\nSome of these might aid digestion, enabling the magter to eat any\nplant or animal life they can lay their hands on. The symbiote might\nproduce sugars, scavenge the blood of toxins--there are so many\nthings it could do. Things it must have done, since the magter are\nobviously the dominant life form on this planet. They paid a high\nprice for the symbiote, but it didn't matter to race survival until\nnow. Did you notice that the magter's brain is no smaller than\nnormal?\"\n\n\"It must be--or how else could that brain-symbiote fit in inside\nthe skull with it?\" Brion said.\n\n\"If the magter's total brain were smaller in volume than normal\nit could fit into the remaining space in the cranial hollow. But\nthe brain is full-sized--it is just that part of it is missing,\nabsorbed by the symbiote.\"\n\n\"The frontal lobes,\" Brion said with sudden realization.\n\"This hellish growth has performed a prefrontal lobotomy!\"\n\n\"It's done even more than that,\" Lea said, separating the\nconvolutions of the gray matter with her scalpel to uncover a green\nfilament beneath. \"These tendrils penetrate further back into the\nbrain, but always remain in the cerebrum. The cerebellum appears to\nbe untouched. Apparently just the higher functions of mankind have\nbeen interfered with, selectively. Destruction of the frontal lobes\nmade the magter creatures without emotions or ability for really\nabstract thought. Apparently they survived better without these.\nThere must have been some horrible failures before the right balance\nwas struck. The final product is a man-plant-animal symbiote that is\nadmirably adapted for survival on this disaster world. No emotions\nto cause complications or desires that might interfere with pure\nsurvival. Complete ruthlessness--mankind has always been strong on\nthis anyway, so it didn't take much of a push.\"\n\n\"The other Disans, like Ulv here, managed to survive without turning\ninto such a creature. So why was it necessary for the magter to go\nso far?\"\n\n\"Nothing is necessary in evolution, you know that,\" Lea said. \"Many\nvariations are possible, and all the better ones continue. You might\nsay that Ulv's people survive, but the magter survive better. If\noffworld contact hadn't been re-established, I imagine that the\nmagter would slowly have become the dominant race. Only they won't\nhave the chance now. It looks as though they have succeeded in\ndestroying both races with their suicidal urge.\"\n\n\"That's the part that doesn't make sense,\" Brion said. \"The magter\nhave survived and climbed right to the top of the evolutionary heap\nhere. Yet they are suicidal. How does it happen they haven't been\nwiped out before this?\"\n\n\"Individually, they have been aggressive to the point of suicide.\nThey will attack anything and everything with the same savage lack\nof emotion. Luckily there are no bigger animals on this planet. So\nwhere they have died as individuals, their utter ruthlessness has\nguaranteed their survival as a group. Now they are faced with a\nproblem that is too big for their half-destroyed minds to handle.\nTheir personal policy has become their planetary policy--and that's\nnever a very smart thing. They are like men with knives who have\nkilled all the men who were only armed with stones. Now they are\nfacing men with guns, and they are going to keep charging and\nfighting until they are all dead.\n\n\"It's a perfect case of the utter impartiality of the forces of\nevolution. Men infected by this Disan life form were the dominant\ncreatures on this planet. The creature in the magters' brains was a\ntrue symbiote then, giving something and receiving something, making\na union of symbiotes where all were stronger together than any could\nbe separately. Now this is changed. The magter brain cannot\nunderstand the concept of racial death, in a situation where it must\nunderstand to be able to survive. Therefore the brain-creature is no\nlonger a symbiote but a parasite.\"\n\n\"And as a parasite it must be destroyed!\" Brion broke in. \"We're not\nfighting shadows any more,\" he exulted. \"We've found the enemy--and\nit's not the magter at all. Just a sort of glorified tapeworm that\nis too stupid to know when it is killing itself off. Does it have\na brain--can it think?\"\n\n\"I doubt it very much,\" Lea said. \"A brain would be of absolutely no\nuse to it. So even if it originally possessed reasoning powers they\nwould be gone by now. Symbiotes or parasites that live internally\nlike this always degenerate to an absolute minimum of functions.\"\n\n\"Tell me about it. What is this thing?\" Ulv broke in, prodding the\nsoft form of the brain-symbiote. He had heard all their excited talk\nbut had not understood a word.\n\n\"Explain it to him, will you, Lea, as best you can,\" Brion said,\nlooking at her, and he realized how exhausted she was. \"And sit down\nwhile you do it; you're long overdue for a rest. I'm going to try--\"\nHe broke off when he looked at his watch.\n\nIt was after four in the afternoon--less than eight hours to go.\nWhat was he to do? Enthusiasm faded as he realized that only half of\nthe problem was solved. The bombs would drop on schedule unless the\nNyjorders could understand the significance of this discovery. Even\nif they understood, would it make any difference to them? The threat\nof the hidden cobalt bombs would not be changed.\n\nWith this thought came the guilty realization that he had forgotten\ncompletely about Telt's death. Even before he contacted the Nyjord\nfleet he must tell Hys and his rebel army what had happened to Telt\nand his sand car. Also about the radioactive traces. They couldn't\nbe checked against the records now to see how important they might\nbe, but Hys might make another raid on the strength of the\nsuspicion. This call wouldn't take long, then he would be free\nto tackle Professor-Commander Krafft.\n\nCarefully setting the transmitter on the frequency of the rebel\narmy, he sent out a call to Hys. There was no answer. When he\nswitched to receive all he heard was static.\n\nThere was always a chance the set was broken. He quickly twisted the\ntransmitter to the frequency of his personal radio, then whistled in\nthe microphone. The received signal was so loud that it hurt his\nears. He tried to call Hys again, and was relieved to get a response\nthis time.\n\n\"Brion Brandd here. Can you read me? I want to talk to Hys at once.\"\n\nIt came as a shock that it was Professor-Commander Krafft who answered.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Brion, but it's impossible to talk to Hys. We are\nmonitoring his frequency and your call was relayed to me. Hys and\nhis rebels lifted ship about half an hour ago, and are already on\nthe way back to Nyjord. Are you ready to leave now? It will soon\nbecome dangerous to make any landings. Even now I will have to ask\nfor volunteers to get you out of there.\"\n\nHys and the rebel army gone! Brion assimilated the thought. He had\nbeen thrown off balance when he realized he was talking to Krafft.\n\n\"If they're gone--well, then there's nothing I can do about it,\" he\nsaid. \"I was going to call you, so I can talk to you now. Listen and\ntry to understand. You must cancel the bombing. I've found out about\nthe magter, found what causes their mental aberration. If we can\ncorrect that, we can stop them from attacking Nyjord--\"\n\n\"Can they be corrected by midnight tonight?\" Krafft broke in. He was\nabrupt and sounded almost angry. Even saints get tired.\n\n\"No, of course not.\" Brion frowned at the microphone, realizing the\ntalk was going all wrong, but not knowing how to remedy it. \"But it\nwon't take too long. I have evidence here that will convince you\nthat what I say is the truth.\"\n\n\"I believe you without seeing it, Brion.\" The trace of anger was\ngone from Krafft's voice now, and it was heavy with fatigue and\ndefeat. \"I'll admit you are probably right. A little while ago\nI admitted to Hys too that he was probably right in his original\nestimation of the correct way to tackle the problem of Dis. We have\nmade a lot of mistakes, and in making them we have run out of time.\nI'm afraid that is the only fact that is relevant now. The bombs\nfall at twelve, and even then they may drop too late. A ship is\nalready on its way from Nyjord with my replacement. I exceeded my\nauthority by running a day past the maximum the technicians gave me.\nI realize now I was gambling the life of my own world in the vain\nhope I could save Dis. They can't be saved. They're dead. I won't\nhear any more about it.\"\n\n\"You must listen--\"\n\n\"I must destroy the planet below me, that is what I must do.\nThat fact will not be changed by anything you say. All the\noffworlders--other than your party--are gone. I'm sending a ship\ndown now to pick you up. As soon as that ship lifts I am going to\ndrop the first bombs. Now--tell me where you are so they can come\nfor you.\"\n\n\"Don't threaten me, Krafft!\" Brion shook his fist at the radio in an\nexcess of anger. \"You're a killer and a world destroyer--don't try\nto make yourself out as anything else. I have the knowledge to avert\nthis slaughter and you won't listen to me. And I know where the\ncobalt bombs are--in the magter tower that Hys raided last night.\nGet those bombs and there is no need to drop any of your own!\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Brion. I appreciate what you're trying to do, but at the\nsame time I know the futility of it. I'm not going to accuse you of\nlying, but do you realize how thin your evidence sounds from this\nend? First, a dramatic discovery of the cause of the magters'\nintransigency. Then, when that had no results, you suddenly remember\nthat you know where the bombs are. The best-kept magter secret.\"\n\n\"I don't know for sure, but there is a very good chance it is so,\"\nBrion said, trying to repair his defenses. \"Telt made readings, he\nhad other records of radioactivity in this same magter keep--proof\nthat something is there. But Telt is dead now, the records\ndestroyed. Don't you see--\" He broke off, realizing how vague and\nunprovable his case was. This was defeat.\n\nThe radio was silent, with just the hum of the carrier wave as\nKrafft waited for him to continue. When Brion did speak his voice\nwas empty of all hope.\n\n\"Send your ship down,\" he said tiredly. \"We're in a building that\nbelonged to the Light Metals Trust, Ltd., a big warehouse of some\nkind. I don't know the address here, but I'm sure you have someone\nthere who can find it. We'll be waiting for you. You win, Krafft.\"\n\nHe turned off the radio.\n\n\n\n\nXVII\n\n\n\"Do you mean what you said, about giving up?\" Lea asked. Brion\nrealized that she had stopped talking to Ulv some time ago, and had\nbeen listening to his conversation with Krafft. He shrugged, trying\nto put his feeling into words.\n\n\"We've tried--and almost succeeded. But if they won't listen, what\ncan we do? What can one man possibly do against a fleet loaded with\nH-bombs?\"\n\nAs if in answer to the question, Ulv's voice drowned him out,\nthe harsh Disan words slashing the silence of the room.\n\n\"Kill you, the enemy!\" he said. \"Kill you _umedvirk_!\"\n\nHe shouted the last word and his hand flashed to his belt. In a\nsingle swift motion he lifted his blowgun and placed it to his lips.\nA tiny dart quivered in the already dead flesh of the creature in\nthe magter's skull. The action had all the symbolism of a broken\nlance, the declaration of war.\n\n\"Ulv understands it a lot better than you might think,\" Lea said.\n\"He knows things about symbiosis and mutualism that would get him\na job as a lecturer in any university on Earth. He knows just what\nthe brain-symbiote is and what it does. They even have a word for it,\none that never appeared in our Disan language lessons. A life form\nthat you can live with or cooperate with is called _medvirk_. One\nthat works to destroy you is _umedvirk_. He also understands that\nlife forms can change, and be _medvirk_ or _umedvirk_ at different\ntimes. He has just decided that the brain symbiote is _umedvirk_\nand he is out to kill it. So will the rest of the Disans as soon as\nhe can show them the evidence and explain.\"\n\n\"You're sure of this?\" Brion asked, interested in spite of himself.\n\n\"Positive. The Disans have an absolute attitude towards survival;\nyou should realize that. Not the same as the magter, but not much\ndifferent in the results. They will kill the brain-symbiotes, even\nif it means killing every magter who harbors one.\"\n\n\"If that is the case we can't leave now,\" Brion said. With these\nwords it suddenly became clear what he had to do. \"The ship is\ncoming down now from the fleet. Get in it and take the body of\nthe magter. I won't go.\"\n\n\"Where will you be?\" she asked, shocked.\n\n\"Fighting the magter. My presence on the planet means that Krafft\nwon't keep his threat to drop the bombs any earlier than the\nmidnight deadline. That would be deliberately murdering me. I doubt\nif my presence past midnight will stop him, but it should keep the\nbombs away at least until then.\"\n\n\"What will you accomplish besides committing suicide?\" Lea pleaded.\n\"You just told me how a single man can't stop the bombs. What will\nhappen to you at midnight?\"\n\n\"I'll be dead--but in spite of that I can't run away. Not now.\nI must do everything possible right up until the last instant. Ulv\nand I will go to the magter tower, try to find out if the bombs are\nthere. He will fight on our side now. He may even know more about\nthe bombs, things that he didn't want to tell me before. We can get\nhelp from his people. Some of them must know where the bombs are,\nbeing native to this planet.\"\n\nLea started to say something, but he rushed on, drowning out her words.\n\n\"You have just as big a job. Show the magter to Krafft, explain the\nsignificance of the brain-parasite to him. Try to get him to talk to\nHys about the last raid. Try to get him to hold off the attack. I'll\nkeep the radio with me and as soon as I know anything I'll call in.\nThis is all last resort, finger in the dike kind of stuff, but it is\nall we can do. Because if we do nothing, it means the end of Dis.\"\n\nLea tried to argue with him, but he wouldn't listen to her. He only\nkissed her, and with a lightness he did not feel tried to convince\nher that everything would be all right. In their hearts they both\nknew it wouldn't be but they left it that way because it was the\nleast painful solution.\n\nA sudden rumbling shook the building and the windows darkened as\na ship settled in the street outside. The Nyjord crew came in with\nguns pointed, alert for anything.\n\nAfter a little convincing they took the cadaver, as well as Lea,\nwhen they lifted ship. Brion watched the spacer become a pinpoint in\nthe sky and vanish. He tried to shake off the feeling that this was\nthe last time he would see any of them.\n\n\"Let's get out of here fast,\" he told Ulv, picking up the radio,\n\"before anyone comes around to see why the ship landed.\"\n\n\"What will you do?\" Ulv asked as they went down the street towards\nthe desert. \"What can we do in the few hours we have left?\" He\npointed at the sun, nearing the horizon. Brion shifted the weight\nof the radio to his other hand before replying.\n\n\"Get to the magter tower we raided last night, that's the best chance.\nThe bombs might be there.... Unless you know where the bombs are?\"\n\nUlv shook his head. \"I do not know, but some of my people may.\nWe will capture a magter, then kill him, so they can all see\nthe _umedvirk_. Then they will tell us everything they know.\"\n\n\"The tower first then, for bombs or a sample magter. What's the\nfastest way we can get there?\"\n\nUlv frowned in thought. \"If you can drive one of the cars the\noffworlders use, I know where there are some locked in buildings\nin this city. None of my people know how they are made to move.\"\n\n\"I can work them--let's go.\"\n\nChance was with them this time. The first sand car they found still\nhad the keys in the lock. It was battery-powered, but contained\na full charge. Much quieter than the heavy atomic cars, it sped\nsmoothly out of the city and across the sand. Ahead of them the sun\nsank in a red wave of color. It was six o'clock. By the time they\nreached the tower it was seven, and Brion's nerves felt as if they\nwere writhing under his skin.\n\nEven though it looked like suicide, attacking the tower brought\nblessed relief. It was movement and action, and for moments at\na time he forgot the bombs hanging over his head.\n\nThe attack was nerve-rackingly anticlimactic. They used the main\nentrance, Ulv ranging soundlessly ahead. There was no one in sight.\nOnce inside, they crept down towards the lower rooms where the\nradiation had been detected. Only gradually did they realize that\nthe magter tower was completely empty.\n\n\"Everyone gone,\" Ulv grunted, sniffing the air in every room that\nthey passed. \"Many magter were here earlier, but they are gone now.\"\n\n\"Do they often desert their towers?\" Brion asked.\n\n\"Never. I have never heard of it happening before. I can think of\nno reason why they should do a thing like this.\"\n\n\"Well, I can,\" Brion told him. \"They would leave their home if they\ntook something with them of greater value. The bombs. If the bombs\nwere hidden here, they might move them after the attack.\" Sudden\nfear hit him. \"Or they might move them because it is time to take\nthem--to the launcher! Let's get out of here, the quickest way we\ncan.\"\n\n\"I smell air from outside,\" Ulv said, \"coming from down there. This\ncannot be, because the magter have no entrances this low in their\ntowers.\"\n\n\"We blasted one in earlier--that could be it. Can you find it?\"\n\nMoonlight shone ahead as they turned an angle of the corridor,\nand stars were visible through the gaping opening in the wall.\n\n\"It looks bigger than it was,\" Brion said, \"as if the magter had\nenlarged it.\" He looked through and saw the tracks on the sand\noutside. \"As if they had enlarged it to bring something bulky up\nfrom below--and carried it away in whatever made those tracks!\"\n\nUsing the opening themselves, they ran back to the sand car. Brion\nground it fiercely around and turned the headlights on the tracks.\nThere were the marks of a sand car's treads, half obscured by thin,\nunmarked wheel tracks. He turned off the lights and forced himself\nto move slowly and to do an accurate job. A quick glimpse at his\nwatch showed him there were four hours left to go. The moonlight was\nbright enough to illuminate the tracks. Driving with one hand, he\nturned on the radio transmitter, already set for Krafft's wave\nlength.\n\nWhen the operator acknowledged his signal Brion reported what they\nhad discovered and his conclusions. \"Get that message to Commander\nKrafft now. I can't wait to talk to him--I'm following the tracks.\"\nHe killed the transmission and stamped on the accelerator. The sand\ncar churned and bounced down the track.\n\n\"They are going to the mountains,\" Ulv said some time later, as the\ntracks still pointed straight ahead. \"There are caves there and many\nmagter have been seen near them; that is what I have heard.\"\n\nThe guess was correct. Before nine o'clock the ground humped into a\nrange of foothills, and the darker masses of mountains could be seen\nbehind them, rising up to obscure the stars.\n\n\"Stop the car here,\" Ulv said, \"The caves begin not too far ahead.\nThere may be magter watching or listening, so we must go quietly.\"\n\nBrion followed the deep-cut grooves, carrying the radio. Ulv came\nand went on both sides, silently as a shadow, scouting for hidden\nwatchers. As far as he could discover there were none.\n\nBy nine-thirty Brion realized they had deserted the sand car too\nsoon. The tracks wound on and on, and seemed to have no end. They\npassed some caves which Ulv pointed out to him, but the tracks never\nstopped. Time was running out and the nightmare stumbling through\nthe darkness continued.\n\n\"More caves ahead,\" Ulv said, \"Go quietly.\"\n\nThey came cautiously to the crest of a hill, as they had done so\nmany times already, and looked into the shallow valley beyond. Sand\ncovered the valley floor, and the light of the setting moon shone\nover the tracks at a flat angle, marking them off sharply as lines\nof shadow. They ran straight across the sandy valley and disappeared\ninto the dark mouth of a cave on the far side.\n\nSinking back behind the hilltop, Brion covered the pilot light with\nhis hand and turned on the transmitter. Ulv stayed above him,\nstaring at the opening of the cave.\n\n\"This is an important message,\" Brion whispered into the mike.\n\"Please record.\" He repeated this for thirty seconds, glancing at\nhis watch to make sure of the time, since the seconds of waiting\nstretched to minutes in his brain. Then, as clearly as possible\nwithout raising his voice above a whisper, he told of the discovery\nof the tracks and the cave.\n\n\"... The bombs may or may not be in here, but we are going in to\nfind out. I'll leave my personal transmitter here with the broadcast\npower turned on, so you can home on its signal. That will give you\na directional beacon to find the cave. I'm taking the other radio\nin--it has more power. If we can't get back to the entrance I'll try\na signal from inside. I doubt if you will hear it because of the\nrock, but I'll try. End of transmission. Don't try to answer me\nbecause I have the receiver turned off. There are no earphones on\nthis set and the speaker would be too loud here.\"\n\nHe switched off, held his thumb on the button for an instant, then\nflicked it back on.\n\n\"Good-by Lea,\" he said, and killed the power for good.\n\nThey circled and reached the rocky wall of the cliff. Creeping\nsilently in the shadows, they slipped up on the dark entrance of the\ncave. Nothing moved ahead and there was no sound from the entrance\nof the cave. Brion glanced at his watch and was instantly sorry.\n\nTen-thirty.\n\nThe last shelter concealing them was five metres from the cave. They\nstarted to rise, to rush the final distance, when Ulv suddenly waved\nBrion down. He pointed to his nose, then to the cave. He could smell\nthe magter there.\n\nA dark figure separated itself from the greater darkness of the cave\nmouth. Ulv acted instantly. He stood up and his hand went to his\nmouth; air hissed faintly through the tube in his hand. Without a\nsound the magter folded and fell to the ground. Before the body hit,\nUlv crouched low and rushed in. There was the sudden scuffling of\nfeet on the floor, then silence.\n\nBrion walked in, gun ready and alert, not knowing what he would\nfind. His toe pushed against a body on the ground and from the\ndarkness Ulv whispered, \"There were only two. We can go on now.\"\n\nFinding their way through the cave was a maddening torture. They had\nno light, nor would they dare use one if they had. There were no\nwheel marks to follow on the stone floor. Without Ulv's sensitive\nnose they would have been completely lost. The cave branched and\nrejoined and they soon lost all sense of direction.\n\nWalking was almost impossible. They had to grope with their hands\nbefore them like blind men. Stumbling and falling against the rock,\ntheir fingers were soon throbbing and raw from brushing against the\nrough walls. Ulv followed the scent of the magter that hung in the\nair where they had passed. When it grew thin he knew they had left\nthe frequently used tunnels and entered deserted ones. They could\nonly retrace their steps and start again in a different direction.\n\nMore maddening than the walking was the way time was running out.\nInexorably the glowing hands crept around the face of Brion's watch\nuntil they stood at fifteen minutes before twelve.\n\n\"There is a light ahead,\" Ulv whispered, and Brion almost gasped\nwith relief. They moved slowly and silently until they stood,\nconcealed by the darkness, looking out into a domed chamber brightly\nlit by glowing tubes.\n\n\"What is it?\" Ulv asked, blinking in the painful wash of\nillumination after the long darkness.\n\nBrion had to fight to control his voice, to stop from shouting.\n\n\"The cage with the metal webbing is a jump-space generator. The\npointed, silver shapes next to it are bombs of some kind, probably\nthe cobalt bombs. We've found it!\"\n\nHis first impulse was to instantly send the radio call that would\nstop the waiting fleet of H-bombers. But an unconvincing message\nwould be worse than no message at all. He had to describe exactly\nwhat he saw here so the Nyjorders would know he wasn't lying. What\nhe told them had to fit exactly with the information they already\nhad about the launcher and the bombs.\n\nThe launcher had been jury-rigged from a ship's jump-space\ngenerator; that was obvious. The generator and its controls were\nneatly cased and mounted. Cables ran from them to a roughly\nconstructed cage of woven metal straps, hammered and bent into shape\nby hand. Three technicians were working on the equipment. Brion\nwondered what sort of blood-thirsty war-lovers the magter had found\nto handle the bombing for them. Then he saw the chains around their\nnecks and the bloody wounds on their backs.\n\nHe still found it difficult to have any pity for them. They had\nobviously been willing to accept money to destroy another planet--or\nthey wouldn't have been working here. They had probably rebelled\nonly when they had discovered how suicidal the attack would be.\n\nThirteen minutes to midnight.\n\nCradling the radio against his chest, Brion rose to his feet. He had\na better view of the bombs now. There were twelve of them, alike as\neggs from the same deadly clutch. Pointed like the bow of a spacer,\neach one swept smoothly back for its two metres of length, to a\nsharply chopped-off end. They were obviously incomplete, the war\nheads of rockets. One had its base turned towards him, and he saw\nsix projecting studs that could be used to attach it to the missing\nrocket. A circular inspection port was open in the flat base of the\nbomb.\n\nThis was enough. With this description, the Nyjorders would know he\ncouldn't be lying about finding the bombs. Once they realized this,\nthey couldn't destroy Dis without first trying to neutralize them.\n\nBrion carefully counted fifty paces before he stopped. He was far\nenough from the cavern so he couldn't be heard, and an angle of the\ncave cut off all light from behind him. With carefully controlled\nmovements he turned on the power, switched the set to transmit,\nand checked the broadcast frequency. All correct. Then slowly and\nclearly, he described what he had seen in the cavern behind him. He\nkept his voice emotionless, recounting facts, leaving out anything\nthat might be considered an opinion.\n\nIt was six minutes before midnight when he finished. He thumbed\nthe switch to receive and waited.\n\nThere was only silence.\n\nSlowly, the empty quality of the silence penetrated his numbed mind.\nThere were no crackling atmospherics nor hiss of static, even when\nhe turned the power full on. The mass of rock and earth of the\nmountain above was acting as a perfect grounding screen, absorbing\nhis signal even at maximum output.\n\nThey hadn't heard him. The Nyjord fleet didn't know that the cobalt\nbombs had been discovered before their launching. The attack would\ngo ahead as planned. Even now, the bomb-bay doors were opening;\narmed H-bombs hung above the planet, held in place only by their\nshackles. In a few minutes the signal would be given and the\nshackles would spring open, the bombs drop clear....\n\n\"Killers!\" Brion shouted into the microphone. \"You wouldn't listen\nto reason, you wouldn't listen to Hys, or me, or to any voice that\nsuggested an alternative to complete destruction. You are going to\ndestroy Dis, and _it's not necessary!_ There were a lot of ways you\ncould have stopped it. You didn't do any of them, and now it's too\nlate. You'll destroy Dis, and in turn this will destroy Nyjord.\nIhjel said that, and now I believe him. You're just another damned\nfailure in a galaxy full of failures!\"\n\nHe raised the radio above his head and sent it crashing into\nthe rock floor. Then he was running back to Ulv, trying to run away\nfrom the realization that he too had tried and failed. The people\non the surface of Dis had less than two minutes left to live.\n\n\"They didn't get my message,\" Brion said to Ulv. \"The radio won't\nwork this far underground.\"\n\n\"Then the bombs will fall?\" Ulv asked, looking searchingly at\nBrion's face in the dim reflected light from the cavern.\n\n\"Unless something happens that we know nothing about, the bombs\nwill fall.\"\n\nThey said nothing after that--they simply waited. The three\ntechnicians in the cavern were also aware of the time. They were\ncalling to each other and trying to talk to the magter. The\nemotionless, parasite-ridden brains of the magter saw no reason to\nstop work, and they attempted to beat the men back to their tasks.\nIn spite of the blows, they didn't go; they only gaped in horror as\nthe clock hands moved remorselessly towards twelve. Even the magter\ndimly felt some of the significance of the occasion. They stopped\ntoo and waited.\n\nThe hour hand touched twelve on Brion's watch, then the minute hand.\nThe second hand closed the gap and for a tenth of a second the three\nhands were one. Then the second hand moved on.\n\nBrion's immediate sensation of relief was washed away by the\nchilling realization that he was deep underground. Sound and seismic\nwaves were slow, and the flare of atomic explosions couldn't be seen\nhere. If the bombs had been dropped at twelve they wouldn't know it\nat once.\n\nA distant rumble filled the air. A moment later the ground heaved\nunder them and the lights in the cavern flickered. Fine dust drifted\ndown from the roof above.\n\nUlv turned to him, but Brion looked away. He could not face the\naccusation in the Disan's eyes.\n\n\n\n\nXVIII\n\n\nOne of the technicians was running and screaming. The magter knocked\nhim down and beat him into silence. Seeing this, the other two men\nreturned to work with shaking hands. Even if all life on the surface\nof the planet was dead, this would have no effect on the magter.\nThey would go ahead as planned, without emotion or imagination\nenough to alter their set course.\n\nAs the technicians worked, their attitude changed from shocked\nnumbness to anger. Right and wrong were forgotten. They had been\nkilled--the invisible death of radiation must already be penetrating\ninto the caves--but they also had the chance for vengeance. Swiftly\nthey brought their work to completion, with a speed and precision\nthey had concealed before.\n\n\"What are those offworlders doing?\" Ulv asked.\n\nBrion stirred from his lethargy of defeat and looked across the\ncavern floor. The men had a wheeled handtruck and were rolling one\nof the atomic warheads onto it. They pushed it over to the\nlatticework of the jump-field.\n\n\"They are going to bomb Nyjord now, just as Nyjord bombed Dis. That\nmachine will hurl the bombs in a special way to the other planet.\"\n\n\"Will you stop them?\" Ulv asked. He had his deadly blowgun in his\nhand and his face was an expressionless mask.\n\nBrion almost smiled at the irony of the situation. In spite of\neverything he had done to prevent it, Nyjord had dropped the bombs.\nAnd this act alone may have destroyed their own planet. Brion had it\nwithin his power now to stop the launching in the cavern. Should he?\nShould he save the lives of his killers? Or should he practice the\nancient blood-oath that had echoed and destroyed down through the\nages: _An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth._ It would be so\nsimple. He literally had to do nothing. The score would be even, and\nhis and the Disans' death avenged.\n\nDid Ulv have his blowgun ready to kill Brion with, if he should try\nto stop the launchings? Or had he misread the Disan entirely?\n\n\"Will _you_ stop them, Ulv?\" he asked.\n\nHow large was mankind's sense of obligation? The caveman first had\nthis feeling for his mate, then for his family. It grew until men\nfought and died for the abstract ideas of cities and nations, then\nfor whole planets. Would the time ever come when men might realize\nthat the obligation should be to the largest and most encompassing\nreality of all--mankind? And beyond that to life of all kinds.\n\nBrion saw this idea, not in words but as a reality. When he posed\nthe question to himself in this way he found that it stated clearly\nits inherent answer. He pulled his gun out, and as he did he\nwondered what Ulv's answer might be.\n\n\"Nyjord is _medvirk_,\" Ulv said, raising his blowgun and sending a\ndart across the cavern. It struck one of the technicians, who gasped\nand fell to the floor.\n\nBrion's shots crashed into the control board, shorting and\ndestroying it, removing the menace to Nyjord for all time.\n\n_Medvirk_, Ulv had said. A life form that cooperates and aids other\nlife forms. It may kill in self-defense, but it is essentially not\na killer or destroyer. Ulv had a lifetime of knowledge about the\ninterdependency of life. He grasped the essence of the idea and\nignored all the verbal complications and confusions. He had\nkilled the magter, who were his own people, because they were\n_umedvirk_--against life. And he had saved his enemies because\nthey were _medvirk_.\n\nWith this realization came the painful knowledge that the planet\nand the people that had produced this understanding were dead.\n\nIn the cavern the magter saw the destruction of their plans, and\nthe cave mouth from which the bullets had come. Silently they rushed\nto kill their enemy--a concerted wave of emotionless fury.\n\nBrion and Ulv fought back. Even the knowledge that he was doomed no\nmatter what happened could not resign Brion to death at the hands\nof the magter. To Ulv, the decision was much easier. He was simply\nkilling _umedvirk_. A believer in life, he destroyed the anti-life.\n\nThey retreated into the darkness, still firing. The magter had\nlights and ion rifles, and were right behind them. Knowing the\ncaverns better than the men they chased, the pursuers circled.\nBrion saw lights ahead and dragged Ulv to a stop.\n\n\"They know their way through these caves, and we don't,\" he said.\n\"If we try to run they'll just shoot us down. Let's find a spot\nwe can defend and settle into it.\"\n\n\"Back here\"--Ulv gave a tug in the right direction--\"there is a cave\nwith only one entrance, and that is very narrow.\"\n\n\"Let's go!\"\n\nRunning as silently as they could in the darkness, they reached\nthe deadend cavern without being seen. What noise they made was lost\nin other footsteps that sounded and echoed through the connecting\ncaves. Once inside, they found cover behind a ridge and waited.\nThe end was certain.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe magter ran swiftly into their cave, flashing his light into all\nthe places of concealment. The beam passed over the two hidden men,\nand at the same instant Brion fired. The shot boomed loudly as the\nmagter fell--a shot that would surely have been heard by the others.\n\nBefore anyone else came into the cave, Brion ran over and grabbed\nthe still functioning light. Propping it on the rocks so it shone on\nthe entrance, he hurried back to shelter beside Ulv. They waited for\nthe attack.\n\nIt was not long in coming. Two magter rushed in, and died. More were\noutside, Brion knew, and he wondered how long it would be before\nthey remembered the grenades and rolled one into their shelter.\n\nAn indistinct murmur sounded outside, and sharp explosions. In their\nhiding place, Brion and Ulv crouched low and wondered why the attack\ndidn't come. Then one of the magter came in the entrance, but Brion\nhesitated before shooting.\n\nThe man had _backed_ in, firing behind him as he came.\n\nUlv had no compunctions about killing, only his darts couldn't\npenetrate the magter's thick clothing. As the magter turned, Ulv's\nbreath pulsed once and death stung the back of the other man's hand.\nHe collapsed into a crumpled heap.\n\n\"Don't shoot,\" a voice called from outside the cave, and a man\nstepped through the swirling dust and smoke to stand in the beam\nfrom the light.\n\nBrion clutched wildly at Ulv's arm, dragging the blowgun from\nthe Disan's mouth.\n\nThe man in the light wore a protective helmet, thick boots and\na pouch-hung uniform.\n\nHe was a Nyjorder.\n\nThe realization was almost impossible to accept. Brion had heard\nthe bombs fall. Yet the Nyjord soldier was here. The two facts\ncouldn't be accepted together.\n\n\"Would you keep a hold on his arm, sir, just in case,\" the soldier\nsaid, glancing warily at Ulv's blowpipe. \"I know what those darts\ncan do.\" He pulled a microphone from one of his pockets and spoke\ninto it.\n\nMore soldiers crowded into the cave, and Professor-Commander Krafft\ncame in behind them. He looked strangely out of keeping in the dusty\ncombat uniform. The gun was even more incongruous in his blue-veined\nhand. After giving the pistol to the nearest soldier with an air of\nrelief, he stumbled quickly over to Brion and took his hand.\n\n\"It is a profound and sincere pleasure to meet you in person,\"\nhe said. \"And your friend Ulv as well.\"\n\n\"Would you kindly explain what is going on?\" Brion said thickly. He\nwas obsessed by the strange feeling that none of this could possibly\nbe happening.\n\n\"We will always remember you as the man who saved us from ourselves,\"\nKrafft said, once again the professor instead of the commander.\n\n\"What Brion wants are facts, Grandpa, not speeches,\" Hys said. The\nbent form of the leader of the rebel Nyjord army pushed through the\ncrowd of taller men until he stood next to Krafft. \"Simply stated,\nBrion, your plan succeeded. Krafft relayed your message to me--and\nas soon as I heard it I turned back and met him on his ship. I'm\nsorry that Telt's dead--but he found what we were looking for. I\ncouldn't ignore his report of radioactive traces. Your girl friend\narrived with the hacked-up corpse at the same time I did, and we all\ntook a long look at the green leech in its skull. Her explanation of\nwhat it is made significant sense. We were already carrying out\nlandings when we had your call about something having been stored\nin the magter tower. After that it was just a matter of following\ntracks--and the transmitter you planted.\"\n\n\"But the explosions at midnight?\" Brion broke in. \"I heard them!\"\n\n\"You were supposed to,\" Hys laughed. \"Not only you, but the magter\nin this cave. We figured they would be armed and the cave strongly\ndefended. So at midnight we dropped a few large chemical explosive\nbombs at the entrance. Enough to kill the guards without bringing\nthe roof down. We also hoped that the magter deeper in would leave\ntheir posts or retreat from the imagined radiation. And they did. It\nworked like a charm. We came in quietly and took them by surprise.\nMade a clean sweep--killed the ones we couldn't capture.\"\n\n\"One of the renegade jump-space technicians was still alive,\"\nKrafft said. \"He told us about your stopping the bombs aimed\nat Nyjord, the two of you.\"\n\nNone of the Nyjorders there could add anything to his words, not\neven the cynical Hys. But Brion could empathize their feelings, the\nwarmth of their intense relief and happiness. It was a sensation he\nwould never forget.\n\n\"There is no more war,\" Brion translated for Ulv, knowing that the\nDisan had understood nothing of the explanation. As he said it, he\nrealized that there was one glaring error in the story.\n\n\"You couldn't have done it,\" Brion said. \"You landed on this planet\n_before_ you had my message about the tower. That means you still\nexpected the magter to be sending their bombs to Nyjord--and you\nmade the landings in spite of this knowledge.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Professor Krafft said, astonished at Brion's lack\nof understanding. \"What else could we do? The magter are sick!\"\n\nHys laughed aloud at Brion's baffled expression. \"You have to\nunderstand Nyjord psychology,\" he said. \"When it was a matter of war\nand killing, my planet could never agree on an intelligent course.\nWar is so alien to our philosophy that it couldn't even be\nconsidered correctly. That's the trouble with being a vegetable\neater in a galaxy of carnivores. You're easy prey for the first one\nthat lands on your back. Any other planet would have jumped on the\nmagter with both feet and shaken the bombs out of them. We fumbled\nit so long it almost got both worlds killed. Your mind-parasite drew\nus back from the brink.\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" Brion said.\n\n\"A simple matter of definition. Before you came we had no way to\ndeal with the magter here on Dis. They really were alien to us.\nNothing they did made sense--and nothing we did seemed to have the\nslightest effect on them. But you discovered that they were _sick_,\nand that's something we know how to handle. We're united again; my\nrebel army was instantly absorbed into the rest of the Nyjord forces\nby mutual agreement. Doctors and nurses are on the way here now.\nPlans were put under way to evacuate what part of the population we\ncould until the bombs were found. The planet is united again, and\nworking hard.\"\n\n\"Because the magter are sick, infected by a destructive life form?\"\nBrion asked.\n\n\"Exactly so,\" Professor Krafft said. \"We are civilized, after all.\nYou can't expect us to fight a war--and you surely can't expect us\nto ignore the plight of sick neighbors?\"\n\n\"No ... you surely can't,\" Brion said, sitting down heavily.\nHe looked at Ulv, to whom the speech had been incomprehensible.\nBeyond him, Hys wore his most cynical expression as he considered\nthe frailties of his people.\n\n\"Hys,\" Brion called out, \"you translate all that into Disan and\nexplain to Ulv. I wouldn't dare.\"\n\n\n\n\nXIX\n\n\nDis was a floating golden ball, looking like a schoolroom globe in\nspace. No clouds obscured its surface, and from this distance it\nseemed warm and attractive set against the cold darkness. Brion\nalmost wished he were back there now, as he sat shivering inside the\nheavy coat. He wondered how long it would be before his confused\nbody-temperature controls decided to turn off the summer adjustment.\nHe hoped it wouldn't be as sudden or as drastic as turning it on\nhad been.\n\nDelicate as a dream, Lea's reflection swam in space next to the\nplanet. She had come up quietly behind him in the spaceship's\ncorridor, only her gentle breath and mirrored face telling him\nshe was there. He turned quickly and took her hands in his.\n\n\"You're looking infinitely better,\" he said.\n\n\"Well, I should,\" she said, pushing back her hair in an unconscious\ngesture with her hand. \"I've been doing nothing but lying in the\nship's hospital, while you were having such a fine time this last\nweek. Rushing around down there shooting all the magter.\"\n\n\"Just gassing them,\" he told her. \"The Nyjorders can't bring\nthemselves to kill any more, even if it does raise their own\ncasualty rate. In fact, they are having difficulty restraining the\nDisans led by Ulv, who are happily killing any magter they see as\nbeing pure _umedvirk_.\"\n\n\"What will they do when they have all those frothing magter madmen?\"\n\n\"They don't know yet,\" he said. \"They won't really know until they\nsee what an adult magter is like with his brain-parasite dead and\ngone. They're having better luck with the children. If they catch\nthem early enough, the parasite can be destroyed before it has done\ntoo much damage.\"\n\nLea shuddered delicately and let herself lean against him. \"I'm not\nthat sturdy yet; let's sit down while we talk.\" There was a couch\nopposite the viewport where they could sit and still see Dis.\n\n\"I hate to think of a magter deprived of his symbiote,\" she said.\n\"If his system can stand the shock, I imagine there will be nothing\nleft except a brainless hulk. This is one series of experiments\nI don't care to witness. I rest secure in the knowledge that\nthe Nyjorders will find the most humane solution.\"\n\n\"I'm sure they will,\" Brion said.\n\n\"Now what about us?\" she said disconcertingly, leaning back in his\narms. \"I must say you have the highest body temperature of any one\nI have ever touched. It's positively exciting.\"\n\nThis jarred Brion even more. He didn't have her ability to put past\nhorrors out of the mind by substituting present pleasures. \"Well,\njust what about us?\" he said with masterful inappropriateness.\n\nShe smiled as she leaned against him. \"You weren't as vague as that,\nthe night in the hospital room. I seem to remember a few other\nthings you said. And did. You can't claim you're completely\nindifferent to me, Brion Brandd. So I'm only asking you what any\noutspoken Anvharian girl would. Where do we go from here? Get\nmarried?\"\n\nThere was a definite pleasure in holding her slight body in his arms\nand feeling her hair against his cheek. They both sensed it, and\nthis awareness made his words sound that much more ugly.\n\n\"Lea--darling! You know how important you are to me--but you\ncertainly realize that we could never get married.\"\n\nHer body stiffened and she tore herself away from him.\n\n\"Why, you great, fat, egotistical slab of meat! What do you mean by\nthat? I like you, Lea, we have plenty of fun and games together, but\nsurely you realize that you aren't the kind of girl one takes home\nto mother!\"\n\n\"Lea, hold on,\" he said. \"You know better than to say a thing like\nthat. What I said has nothing to do with how I feel towards you.\nBut marriage means children, and you are biologist enough to know\nabout Earth's genes--\"\n\n\"Intolerant yokel!\" she cried, slapping his face. He didn't move or\nattempt to stop her. \"I expected better from you, with all your\npretensions of understanding. But all you can think of are the\nhorror stories about the worn-out genes of Earth. You're the same as\nevery other big, strapping bigot from the frontier planets. I know\nhow you look down on our small size, our allergies and haemophilia\nand all the other weaknesses that have been bred back and preserved\nby the race. You hate--\"\n\n\"But that's not what I meant at all,\" he interrupted, shocked, his\nvoice drowning hers out. \"Yours are the strong genes, the viable\nstrains--_mine_ are the deadly ones. A child of mine would kill\nitself and you in a natural birth, if it managed to live to term.\nYou're forgetting that you are the original homo sapiens. I'm a\nrecent mutation.\"\n\nLea was frozen by his words. They revealed a truth she had known,\nbut would never permit herself to consider.\n\n\"Earth is home, the planet where mankind developed,\" he said. \"The\nlast few thousand years you may have been breeding weaknesses back\ninto the genetic pool. But that's nothing compared to the hundred\nmillions of years that it took to develop man. How many newborn\nbabies live to be a year of age on Earth?\"\n\n\"Why ... almost all of them. A fraction of one per cent die each\nyear--I can't recall exactly how many.\"\n\n\"Earth is home,\" he said again gently. \"When men leave home they can\nadapt to different planets, but a price must be paid. A terrible\nprice is in dead infants. The successful mutations live, the\nfailures die. Natural selection is a brutally simple affair. When\nyou look at me, you see a success. I have a sister--a success too.\nYet my mother had six other children who died when they were still\nbabies. And several others that never came to term. You know about\nthese things, don't you, Lea?\"\n\n\"I know, I know ...\" she said sobbing into her hands. He held her\nnow and she didn't pull away. \"I know it all as a biologist--but\nI am so awfully tired of being a biologist, and top of my class and\na mental match for any man. When I think about you, I do it as\na woman, and can't admit any of this. I need someone, Brion, and\nI needed you so much because I loved you.\" She paused and wiped her\neyes. \"You're going home, aren't you? Back to Anvhar. When?\"\n\n\"I can't wait too long,\" he said, unhappily. \"Aside from my personal\nwants, I find myself remembering that I'm a part of Anvhar. When you\nthink of the number of people who suffered and died--or adapted--so\nthat I could be sitting here now ... well, it's a little\nfrightening. I suppose it doesn't make sense logically that I should\nfeel indebted to them. But I do. Anything I do now, or in the next\nfew years, won't be as important as getting back to Anvhar.\"\n\n\"And I won't be going back with you.\" It was a flat statement\nthe way she said it, not a question.\n\n\"No, you won't be,\" he said. \"There is nothing on Anvhar for you.\"\n\nLea was looking out of the port at Dis and her eyes were dry now.\n\"Way back in my deeply buried unconscious I think I knew it would\nend this way,\" she said. \"If you think your little lecture on the\nOrigins of Man was a novelty, it wasn't. It just reminded me of a\nnumber of things my glands had convinced me to forget. In a way, I\nenvy you your weightlifter wife-to-be, and your happy kiddies. But\nnot very much. Very early in life I resigned myself to the fact that\nthere was no one on Earth I would care to marry. I always had these\nteen-age dreams of a hero from space who would carry me off, and I\nguess I slipped you into the pattern without realizing it. I'm old\nenough now to face the fact that I like my work more than a banal\nmarriage, and I'll probably end up a frigid and virtuous old maid,\nwith more degrees and titles than you have shot-putting records.\"\n\nAs they looked through the port Dis began slowly to contract. Their\nship drew away from it, heading towards Nyjord. They sat apart,\nwithout touching now. Leaving Dis meant leaving behind something\nthey had shared. They had been strangers together there, on a\nstrange world. For a brief time their lifelines had touched. That\ntime was over now.\n\n\"Don't we look happy!\" Hys said, shambling towards them.\n\n\"Fall dead and make me even happier then,\" Lea snapped bitterly.\n\nHys ignored the acid tone of her words and sat down on the couch next\nto them. Since leaving command of his rebel Nyjord army he seemed much\nmellower. \"Going to keep on working for the Cultural Relationships\nFoundation, Brion?\" he asked. \"You're the kind of man we need.\"\n\nBrion's eyes widened as the meaning of the last words penetrated.\n\"Are you in the C.R.F.?\"\n\n\"Field agent for Nyjord,\" he said. \"I hope you don't think those\nhelpless office types like Faussel or Mervv really represented us\nthere? They just took notes and acted as a front and cover for the\norganization. Nyjord is a fine planet, but a gentle guiding hand\nbehind the scenes is needed, to help them find their place in the\ngalaxy before they are pulverized.\"\n\n\"What's your dirty game, Hys?\" Lea asked, scowling. \"I've had enough\nhints to suspect for a long time that there was more to the C.R.F.\nthan the sweetness-and-light part I have seen. Are you people\negomaniacs, power hungry or what?\"\n\n\"That's the first charge that would be leveled at us if our\nactivities were publicly known,\" Hys told her. \"That's why we do\nmost of our work under cover. The best fact I can give you to\ncounter the charge is _money_. Just where do you think we get the\nfunds for an operation this size?\" He smiled at their blank looks.\n\"You'll see the records later so there won't be any doubt. The truth\nis that all our funds are donated by planets we have helped. Even a\ntiny percentage of a planetary income is large--add enough of them\ntogether and you have enough money to help other planets. And\nvoluntary gratitude is a perfect test, if you stop to think about\nit. You can't talk people into liking what you have done. They have\nto be convinced. There have always been people on C.R.F. worlds who\nknew about our work, and agreed with it enough to see that we are\nkept in funds.\"\n\n\"Why are you telling me all this super-secret stuff,\" Lea asked.\n\n\"Isn't that obvious? We want you to keep on working for us. You can\nname whatever salary you like--as I've said, there is no shortage of\nready cash.\"\n\nHys glanced quickly at them both and delivered the clinching\nargument. \"I hope Brion will go on working with us too. He is the\nkind of field agent we desperately need, and it is almost impossible\nto find.\"\n\n\"Just show me where to sign,\" Lea said, and there was life in her\nvoice once again.\n\n\"I wouldn't exactly call it blackmail,\" Brion smiled, \"but I suppose\nif you people can juggle planetary psychologies, you must find that\nindividuals can be pushed around like chessmen. Though you should\nrealize that very little pushing is required this time.\"\n\n\"Will you sign on?\" Hys asked.\n\n\"I must go back to Anvhar,\" Brion said, \"but there really is no\npressing hurry.\"\n\n\"Earth,\" said Lea, \"is overpopulated enough as it is.\"\n\n\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n                        72\n                       HOURS\n                      IN HELL\n\n          Dis was a harsh, inhospitable,\n   dangerous place and the Magter made it worse.\n            They might have been human\n      once--but they were something else now.\n       The Magter had only one desire--Kill!\n     Kill everything, themselves, their planet,\n            the universe if they could--\n          Brion Brandd was sent in at the\n  eleventh hour.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
