I had been on\nedge all the way across the Atlantic. Now as the steward came through\nthe compartments to pick up our Blue Plate ration coupons for the\ntrip, I couldn't help feeling annoyed that I hadn't eaten the food\nthey represented. For the Company wanted everyone to get the fullest\npossible benefit out of his policies--not only the food policies, but\nBlue Blanket, Blue Bolt and all the others.\n\nWe _whooshed_ in to a landing at Carmody Field, just outside of\nNaples. My baggage was checked through, so I didn't expect to have any\ndifficulty clearing past the truce-team Customs inspectors. It was only\na matter of turning over my baggage checks, and boarding the _rapido_\nthat would take me into Naples.\n\nBut my luck was low. The man before me was a fussbudget who insisted on\ncarrying his own bags, and I had to stand behind him a quarter of an\nhour, while the truce-teams geigered his socks and pajamas.\n\nWhile I fidgeted, though, I noticed that the Customs shed had, high\nup on one wall, a heroic-sized bust of Millen Carmody himself. Just\nstanding there, under that benevolent smile, made me feel better. I\neven managed to nod politely to the traveler ahead of me as he finally\ngot through the gate and let me step up to the uniformed Company\nexpediter who checked my baggage tickets.\n\nAnd the expediter gave me an unexpected thrill. He leafed through\nmy papers, then stepped back and gave me a sharp military salute.\n\"Proceed, Adjuster Wills,\" he said, returning my travel orders. It\nhadn't been like that at the transfer point at Port Lyautey--not even\nback at the Home Office in New York. But here we were in Naples, and\nthe little war was not yet forgotten; we were under Company law, and I\nwas an officer of the Company.\n\nIt was all I needed to restore my tranquility. But it didn't last.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe _rapido_ took us through lovely Italian countryside, but it was in\nno hurry to do it. We were late getting into the city itself, and I\nfound myself almost trotting out of the little train and up into the\nmain waiting room where my driver would be standing at the Company desk.\n\nI couldn't really blame the Neapolitans for the delay--it wasn't their\nfault that the Sicilians had atomized the main passenger field at\nCapodichino during the war, and the _rapido_ wasn't geared to handling\nthat volume of traffic from Carmody Field. But Mr. Gogarty would be\nwaiting for me, and it wasn't my business to keep a Regional Director\nwaiting.\n\nI got as far as the exit to the train shed. There was a sudden high,\nshrill blast of whistles and a scurrying and, out of the confusion of\npersons milling about, there suddenly emerged order.\n\nAt every doorway stood three uniformed Company expediters; squads of\nexpediters formed almost before my eyes all over the train shed;\nsingle expediters appeared and took up guard positions at every\nstairwell and platform head. It was a triumph of organization; in no\nmore than ten seconds, a confused crowd was brought under instant\ncontrol.\n\nBut why?\n\nThere was a babble of surprised sounds from the hurrying crowds; they\nwere as astonished as I. It was reasonable enough that the Company's\nexpediter command should conduct this sort of surprise raid from time\nto time, of course. The Company owed it to its policyholders; by\ninsuring them against the hazards of war under the Blue Bolt complex\nof plans, it had taken on the responsibility of preventing war when it\ncould. And ordinarily it could, easily enough.\n\nHow could men fight a war without weapons--and how could they buy\nweapons, particularly atomic weapons, when the Company owned all the\nsources and sold only to whom it pleased, when it pleased, as it\npleased? There were still occasional outbreaks--witness the recent\nstrife between Sicily and Naples itself--but the principle remained....\nAnyway, surprise raids were well within the Company's rights.\n\nI was mystified, though--I could not imagine what they were looking\nfor here in the Naples railroad terminal; with geigering at Carmody\nField and every other entry point to the Principality of Naples, they\nshould have caught every fissionable atom coming in, and it simply\ndid not seem reasonable that anyone in the principality itself could\nproduce nuclear fuel to make a bomb.\n\nUnless they were not looking for bombs, but for people who might want\nto use them. But that didn't tie in with what I had been taught as a\ncadet at the Home Office.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a crackle and an unrecognizable roar from the station's\npublic-address system. Then the crowd noises died down as people\nstrained to listen, and I began to understand the words: \"...\nWhere you are in an orderly fashion until this investigation is\nconcluded. You will not be delayed more than a few minutes. Do not,\nrepeat, _do not_ attempt to leave until this man has been captured.\nAttention! Attention! All persons in this area! Under Company law,\nyou are ordered to stop all activities and stand still at once. An\ninvestigation is being carried out in this building. All persons will\nstand still and remain where you are in an orderly fashion until this\ninvestigation....\"\n\nThe mounting babble drowned the speaker out again, but I had heard\nenough.\n\nI suppose I was wrong, but I had been taught that my duty was to serve\nthe world, by serving the Company, in all ways at all times. I walked\nbriskly toward the nearest squad of expediters, who were already\nbreaking up into detachments and moving about among the halted knots of\ncivilians, peering at faces, asking questions.\n\nI didn't quite make it; I hadn't gone more than five yards when a heavy\nhand fell on my shoulder, and a harsh voice snarled in the Neapolitan\ndialect, \"Halt, you! Didn't you hear the orders?\"\n\nI spun, staggering slightly, to face an armed expediter-officer. I\nstood at attention and said crisply, \"Sorry. I'm Thomas Wills, Claims\nAdjuster. I thought I might be able to help.\"\n\nThe officer stared at me for a moment. His cheeks moved; I had the\nimpression that, under other circumstances, he would have spat on the\nfloor at my feet. \"Papers!\" he ordered.\n\nI passed him my travel orders. He looked them over briefly, then\nreturned them. Like the Customs expediter at Carmody Field, he gave\nme a snap salute, militarily precise and, in a way I could not quite\ndefine, contemptuous. \"You should just stay here, Adjuster Wills,\" he\nadvised--in a tone that made it a command. \"This will be over in a\nmoment.\"\n\nHe was gone, back to his post. I stood for a moment, but it was easier\nto listen to his orders than to obey them; the Neapolitan crowd didn't\nseem to take too well to discipline, and though there was no overt\nresistance to the search squads, there was a sort of Brownian movement\nof individuals in the throng that kept edging me back and away from\nwhere I had been standing. It made me a little uncomfortable; I was\nstanding close to the edge of a platform, and a large poster announced\nthat the Milan Express was due to arrive on that track at any moment.\nIn fact, I could hear the thin, effeminate whistle of its Diesel\nlocomotive just beyond the end of the platform. I tried to inch my\nway from the edge. I dodged around an electric baggage-cart, and trod\nheavily on someone's foot.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Excuse me,\" I said quickly, looking at the man. He glared back at\nme. There was a bright spark in his eyes; I could tell little about\nhis expression because, oddly enough in that country of clean-shaven\nfaces, he wore a heavy, ragged, clipped beard. He wore the uniform of\na porter. He mumbled something I could not quite catch, and moved as if\nto push me away. I suppose I put up my arm. My papers, with the Company\nseal bright gold upon them, were still in my hand, and the bearded man\ncaught sight of them.\n\nIf there had been anger in his eyes before, there was now raging fury.\nHe shrilled, \"Beast! Animal!\" He thrust at me blindly and leaped past\nme, out of the shelter of the bags; he went spinning furiously through\nthe crowd, men and women ricocheting off him.\n\nI heard a harsh bellow: \"There he goes! Zorchi! Zorchi!\" And I could\nhear the bearded man shrieking curses as he hurtled up the platform, up\ntoward the oncoming train, over to the edge--and off the platform to\nthe tracks!\n\nHe fell less than a yard in front of the slim nose of the Diesel. I\ndon't suppose the speed of the train was even five miles an hour, but\nthe engineer hadn't a chance in the world to stop.\n\nWhile I watched, struck motionless, along with all the others on that\nplatform, the engine passed over the huddled form. The brakes were\nshrieking, but it was much, much too late. Even in that moment I\nthought he would not be killed--not instantly, at least, unless he\ndied of loss of blood. The trunk of his body was safely in the well\nbetween the tracks. But his legs were sprawled over a rail. And the\nslow click-click of the wheels didn't stop until his uniformed body was\nfar out of sight.\n\nIt was shocking, sickening, unbelievable.\n\nAnd it didn't stop there. A strange thing happened. When the man had\ndived into the path of the train, there was a sudden fearful hush; it\nhad happened too suddenly for anyone to cry out. And when the hush\nended, there was only a momentary, instinctive gasp of horror. Then\nthere was a quick, astonished babble of voices--and then cheers! And\napplause, and ringing bravos!\n\nI didn't understand.\n\nThe man had thrown himself deliberately under the train. I was sure of\nit.\n\nWas that something to cheer?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI finally made it to where the Regional Director was waiting for\nme--nearly an hour late.\n\nIt was at a hotel overlooking the Bay, and the sight was thrilling\nenough to put the unpleasant accident I had seen out of my mind for a\nmoment. There was nothing so beautiful in all the world, I thought, as\nthe Bay of Naples at sunset. It was not only my own opinion; I had\nseen it described many times in the travel folders I had pored over,\nwhile my wife indulgently looked over my shoulder, back in those remote\ndays of marriage. \"La prima vista del mundo,\" the folders had called\nit--the most beautiful sight of the world. They had said: \"See Naples,\nand die.\"\n\nI hadn't known, of course, that Marianna would die first....\n\nBut that was all behind me. After Marianna's death, a lot of things\nhad happened, all in a short time, and some of them very bad. But good\nor bad, I had laid down a law for myself: I would not dwell on them. I\nhad started on a new life, and I was going to put the past in a locked\ncompartment in my mind. I had to!\n\nI was no longer an ordinary civilian, scraping together his Blue\nHeaven premiums for the sake of a roof over his head, budgeting his\nfood policies, carrying on his humdrum little job. I was a servant\nof the human race and a member of the last surviving group of\ngentleman-adventurers in all the world: I was an Insurance Claims\nAdjuster for the Company!\n\nAll the same, I couldn't quite forget some of the bad things that had\nhappened, as I walked into the hotel dining room to meet the Regional\nDirector.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRegional Director Gogarty was a huge, pale balloon of a man. He\nwas waiting for me at a table set for four. As he greeted me, his\nexpression was sour. \"Glad to meet you, Wills. Bad business, this. Bad\nbusiness. He got away with it again.\"\n\nI coughed. \"Sir?\" I asked.\n\n\"Zorchi!\" he snapped. And I remembered the name I had heard on the\nplatform. The mad-man! Zorchi, Luigi Zorchi, the human jellyfish.\n\"Wills, do you know that that man has just cashed in on his _twelfth_\ndisability policy? And not a thing we could do to stop him! You were\nthere. You saw it, didn't you?\"\n\n\"Well, yes, but--\"\n\n\"Thought so. The twelfth! And your driver said on the phone it was both\nlegs this time. Both legs--and on a common carrier. Double indemnity!\"\nHe shook his enormous head. \"And with a whole corps of expediters\nstanding by to stop him!\"\n\nI said with some difficulty, \"Sir, do you mean that the man I saw run\nover by the train was--\"\n\n\"Luigi Zorchi. That's who he was. Ever hear of him, Wills?\"\n\n\"Can't say I have.\"\n\nGogarty nodded his balloon-like head. \"The Company has kept it out of\nthe papers, of course, but you can't keep anything from being gossiped\nabout around here. This Zorchi is practically a national hero in\nNaples. He's damn near a millionaire by now, I guess, and every lira\nof it has come right out of the Company's indemnity funds. And do you\nthink we can do anything about it? Not a thing! Not even when we're\ntipped off ahead of time--when, what, and where!\n\n\"He just laughs at us. I know for a fact,\" Gogarty said bitterly, \"that\nZorchi knew we found out he was going to dive in front of that express\ntonight. He was just daring us to stop him. We should have! We should\nhave figured he might disguise himself as a porter. We should--\"\n\nI interrupted, \"Mr. Gogarty, are you trying to tell me this man\n_deliberately_ maims himself for the accident insurance?\" Gogarty\nnodded sourly. \"Good heavens,\" I cried, \"that's disloyal!\"\n\nGogarty laughed sharply and brought me up standing. There was a note to\nthe way he laughed that I didn't like; for a moment there, I thought he\nwas thinking of my own little--well, indiscretion. But he said only,\n\"It's expensive, too.\" I suppose he meant nothing by it. But I was\nsensitive on the subject.\n\nBefore I could ask him any more questions, the massive face smoothed\nout in a smile. He rose ponderously, greeting someone. \"Here they are,\nWills,\" he said jovially. \"The girls!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe headwaiter was conducting two young ladies toward us. I remembered\nmy manners and stood up, but I confess I was surprised. I had heard\nthat discipline in the field wasn't the same as at the Home Office, but\nafter all--Gogarty was a Regional Director!\n\nIt was a little informal of him to arrange our first meeting at dinner,\nin the first place. But to make a social occasion of it was--in the\nstraitlaced terms of the Home Office where I had been trained--almost\nunthinkable.\n\nAnd it was apparent that the girls were mere decoration. I had a\nhundred eager questions to ask Gogarty--about this mad Zorchi, about my\nduties, about Company policy here in the principality of Naples--but it\nwould be far out of line to bring up Company matters with these females\npresent. I was not pleased, but I managed to be civil.\n\nThe girls were decorative enough, I had to admit.\n\nGogarty said expansively, all trace of ill humor gone, \"This is\nSignorina dell'Angela and Miss Susan Manchester. Rena and Susan, this\nis Tom Wills.\"\n\nI said stiffly, \"Delighted.\"\n\nSusan was the blonde one, a small plump girl with the bubbly smile of a\nprofessional model. She greeted Gogarty affectionately. The other was\ndark and lovely, but with a constant shadow, almost glowering, in her\neyes.\n\nSo we had a few drinks. Then we had a few more. Then the captain\nappeared with a broad menu, and I found myself in an embarrassing\nposition. For Gogarty waved the menu aside with a gesture of mock\ndisgust. \"Save it for the peasants,\" he ordered. \"We don't want that\nBlue Plate slop. We'll start with those little baby shrimps like I had\nlast night, and then an antipasto and after that--\"\n\nI broke in apologetically, \"Mr. Gogarty, I have only a Class-B policy.\"\n\nGogarty blinked at me. \"What?\"\n\nI cleared my throat. \"I have only Class-B coverage on my Blue Plate\npolicy,\" I repeated. \"I, uh, I never went in much for such--\"\n\nHe looked at me incredulously. \"Boy,\" he said, \"this is on the Company.\nNow relax and let me order. Blue Plate coverage is for the peasants; I\neat like a human being.\"\n\nIt shook me a little. Here was a Regional Director talking about the\nrations supplied under the Company's Blue Plate coverage as \"slop.\" Oh,\nI wasn't naive enough to think that no one talked that way. There were\na certain number of malcontents anywhere. I'd heard that kind of talk,\nand even worse, once in a while from the Class-D near-uninsurables, the\nsoreheads with a grudge against the world who blamed all their troubles\non the Company and bleated about the \"good old days.\" Mostly they did\ntheir bleating when it was premium time, I'd noticed.\n\nBut I certainly never expected it from Gogarty.\n\nStill--it was his party. And he seemed like a pretty nice guy. I had\nto allow him the defects of his virtues, I decided. If he was less\nreverent to the Company than he should have been, at least by the same\ntoken he was friendly and democratic. He had at least twenty years\nseniority on me, and back at the Home Office a mere Claims Adjuster\nwouldn't have been at the same table with a Regional Director.\n\nAnd here he was feeding me better than I had ever eaten in my life,\ntalking as though we were equals, even (I reminded myself) seeing to it\nthat we had the young ladies to keep us company.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe were hours at dinner, hours and endless glasses of wine, and we\ntalked continually. But the conversation never came close to official\nbusiness.\n\nThe girl Rena was comfortable to be with, I found. There was that\ndeep, eternal sadness in her eyes, and every once in a while I came\nup against it in the middle of a laugh; but she was soft-voiced and\npleasant, and undeniably lovely. Marianna had been prettier, I thought,\nbut Marianna's voice was harsh Midwest while Rena's--\n\nI stopped myself.\n\nWhen we were on our after-dinner liqueurs, Rena excused herself\nfor a moment and, after a few minutes, I spotted her standing by a\nsatin-draped window, looking wistfully out over a balcony. Gogarty\nwinked.\n\nI got up and, a little unsteadily, went over to her. \"Shall we look at\nthis more closely?\" I asked her. She smiled and we stepped outside.\n\nAgain I was looking down on the Bay of Naples--a scene painted in\nmoonlight this time, instead of the orange hues of sunset. It was warm,\nbut the Moon was frosty white in the sky. Even its muddled reflection\nin the slagged waters was grayish white, not yellow. There was a pale\norange halo over the crater of Mount Vesuvius, to our left; and far\ndown the coast a bluish phosphorescence, over the horizon, marked\nPompeii. \"Beautiful,\" I said.\n\nShe looked at me strangely. All she said was, \"Let's go back inside.\"\n\nGogarty greeted us. \"Looking at the debris?\" he demanded jovially. \"Not\nmuch to see at night. Cheer up, Tom. You'll see all the damage you want\nto see over the next few days.\"\n\nI said, \"I hope so, sir.\"\n\nGogarty shook his head reprovingly. \"Not 'sir,' Tom. Save that for the\noffice. Call me Sam.\" He beamed. \"You want to know what it was like\nhere during the war? You can ask the girls. They were here all through.\nEspecially Susan--she was with the Company's branch here, even before I\ntook over. Right, Susan?\"\n\n\"Right, Sam,\" she said obediently.\n\nGogarty nodded. \"Not that Rena missed much either, but she was out of\ntown when the Sicilians came over. Weren't you?\" he demanded, curiously\nintent. Rena nodded silently. \"Naples sure took a pasting,\" Gogarty\nwent on. \"It was pretty tough for a while. Did you know that the\nSicilians actually made a landing right down the coast at Pompeii?\"\n\n\"I saw the radioactivity,\" I said.\n\n\"That's right. They got clobbered, all right. Soon's the barges were\nin, the Neapolitans let them have it. But it cost them. The Company\nonly allowed them five A-bombs each, and they had to use two more\nto knock out Palermo. And--well, they don't like to tell this on\nthemselves, but one of the others was a dud. Probably the only dud\nA-bomb in history, I guess.\"\n\nHe grinned at Rena. Astonishingly, Rena smiled back.\n\nShe was, I thought, a girl of many astonishing moments; I had not\nthought that she would be amused at Gogarty's heavy-handed needling.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGogarty went on and on. I was interested enough--I had followed the\nNaples-Sicily war in the papers and, of course, I'd been briefed at\nthe Home Office before coming over--but the girls seemed to find it\npretty dull. By the time Gogarty finished telling me about the Sicilian\nattempt to trigger Mt. Vesuvius by dropping an A-bomb into its crater,\nRena was frankly bored and even Susan was yawning behind her palm.\n\nWe finally wound up under the marquee of the restaurant. Gogarty and\nthe blonde politely said good night, and disappeared into a cab. It\nwas clearly up to me to take Rena home.\n\nI hailed a cab. When I made up my new insurance schedule at the Home\nOffice before coming over, I splurged heavily on transportation\ncoverage. Perhaps I was making up for the luxuries of travel that\nlife with Marianna hadn't allowed me. Anyway, I'd taken out Class AA\npolicies. And as the cab driver clipped my coupons he was extremely\npolite.\n\nRena lived a long way from the hotel. I tried to make small talk,\nbut she seemed to have something on her mind. I was in the middle of\ntelling her about the terrible \"accident\" I had seen that evening at\nthe station--suitably censored, of course--when I observed she was\nstaring out the window.\n\nShe hadn't been paying attention while I talked, but she noticed the\nsilence when I stopped. She gave a little shake of the head and looked\nat me. \"I'm sorry, Mr. Wills,\" she said. \"I am being rude.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" I said gallantly.\n\n\"Yes.\" She nodded and smiled, but it was a thoughtful, almost a sad,\nsmile. \"You are too polite, you gentlemen of the Company. Is that part\nof your training?\"\n\n\"It's easy to be polite to you, Miss dell'Angela,\" I said by rote.\nYes, it was part of our training: _A Claims Adjuster is always\ncourteous_. But what I said was true enough, all the same. She was a\ngirl that I enjoyed being polite to.\n\n\"No, truly,\" she persisted. \"You are an important officer in the\nCompany, and you must have trained long for the post. What did they\nteach you?\"\n\n\"Well--\" I hesitated--\"just the sort of thing you'd expect, I guess. A\nlittle statistical mathematics--enough so we can understand what the\nactuaries mean. Company policies, business methods, administration.\nThen, naturally, we had a lot of morale sessions. A Claims Adjuster--\"\nI cleared my throat, feeling a little self-conscious--\"a Claims\nAdjuster is supposed to be like Caesar's wife, you know. He must always\nset an example to his staff and to the public. I guess that sounds\npretty stuffy. I don't mean it to be. But there is a lot of emphasis on\ntradition and honor and discipline.\"\n\nShe asked, rather oddly, \"And is there a course in loyalty?\"\n\n\"Why, I suppose you might say that. There are ceremonies, you know.\nAnd it's a matter of cadet honor to put the Company ahead of personal\naffairs.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"And do all Claims Adjusters live by this code?\"\n\nFor a moment I couldn't answer. It was like a blow in the face. I\nturned sharply to look at her, but there was no expression on her face,\nonly a mild polite curiosity.\n\nI said with difficulty, \"Miss dell'Angela, what are you getting at?\"\n\n\"Why, nothing!\" Her face was as angelic as her name.\n\n\"I don't know what you mean or what you may have heard about me,\nMiss dell'Angela, but I can tell you this, if you are interested.\nWhen my wife died, I went to pieces. I admit it. I said a lot of\nthings I shouldn't have, and some of them may have reflected against\nthe Company. I'm not trying to deny that but, you understand, I was\nupset at the time. I'm not upset now.\" I took a deep breath. \"To me,\nthe Company is the savior of humanity. I don't want to sound like a\nfanatic, but I am loyal to the Company, to the extent of putting it\nahead of my personal affairs, to the extent of doing whatever job the\nCompany assigns to me. And, if necessary, to the extent of dying for it\nif I have to. Is that clear?\"\n\nWell, that was a conversation-stopper, of course. I hadn't meant to\nget all wound up about it, but it hurt to find out that there had been\ngossip. The dell'Angela girl merely said: \"Quite clear.\"\n\nWe rode in silence for a while. She was staring out the window again,\nand I didn't especially want to talk just then. Maybe I was too\nsensitive. But there was no doubt in my mind that the Company was the\nwhite hope of the world, and I didn't like being branded a traitor\nbecause of what I'd said after Marianna died. I was, in a way, paying\nthe penalty for it--it had been made pretty clear to me that I was on\nprobation. That was enough.\n\nAs I said, she lived a long way from the Gran Reale. I had plenty of\ntime for my flare-up, and for brooding, and for getting over it.\n\nBut we never did get around to much idle conversation on that little\ntrip. By the time I had simmered down, I began to have disturbing\nthoughts. It suddenly occurred to me that I was a man, and she was a\ngirl, and we were riding in a cab.\n\nI don't know how else to say it. At one moment I was taking her home\nfrom a dinner; and at the next, I was taking her home from a date.\nNothing had changed--except the way I looked at it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll of a sudden, I began to feel as though I were fourteen years old\nagain. It had been quite a long time since I had had the duty of\nescorting a beautiful girl--and by then I realized this was a really\n_beautiful_ girl--home at the end of an evening. And I was faced with\nthe question that I had thought would never bother me again at least a\ndecade before. Should I kiss her good night?\n\nIt was a problem, and I thought about it, feeling a little foolish but\nrather happy about it. But all my thinking came to nothing. She decided\nfor me.\n\nThe cab stopped in front of a white stucco wall. Like so many of the\nbetter Italian homes, the wall enclosed a garden, and the house was in\nthe middle of the garden. It was an attractive enough place--Class A at\nleast, I thought--though it was hard to tell in the moonlight.\n\nI cleared my throat and sort of halfway leaned over to her.\n\nThen she turned and was looking up at me, and the moonlight glinted\nbrightly off what could only have been tears in her eyes.\n\nI stared.\n\nShe didn't say a word. She shook her head briefly, opened the door and\nwas gone behind the gate.\n\nIt was a puzzlement. Why had she been crying? What had I done?\n\nI reviewed my conduct all the way back to the hotel, but nothing much\ncame of it. Perhaps I had been brusque--but brusque enough to bring\ntears? I couldn't believe it.\n\nCurious new life! I fell asleep with the pale moon shining in the\nwindow, brooding about the life I was just beginning, and about the old\nlife behind me that was buried in the same grave with Marianna.\n\n\nII\n\nThe Naples branch of the Company lay in the heart of the city. I took\na cab to a sort of dome-roofed thing called a _galleria_, and walked\nunder its skeletal steel ceiling to my new office. Once the _galleria_\nhad been roofed with glass, but the glass had powdered down from the\nconcussion of the Mt. Vesuvius bomb, or the Capodichino bomb, or one of\nthe other hammerblows the Sicilians had rained on the principality of\nNaples in the recent unpleasantness.\n\nI entered the office and looked around. The blonde girl named Susan\nappeared to double as the office receptionist. She nodded efficiently\nand waved me to a fenced-off enclosure where Sam Gogarty sat, plump\nand untroubled, at an enormous desk.\n\nI pushed open the swinging gate.\n\nGogarty looked at me icily. \"You're late,\" he said.\n\n_He_ had no hangover, it was clear. I said apologetically, \"Sorry,\nI'm--\"\n\n\"Never mind. Just don't let it happen again.\" It was clear that, in\nthe office, business was business; the fact that we had been drinking\ntogether the night before would not condone liberties the morning\nafter. Gogarty said, \"Your desk is over there, Wills. Better get\nstarted.\"\n\nI felt considerably deflated as I sat down at my desk and stared\nunhappily at the piles of blue and yellow manifolds before me.\n\nThe Company had trained me well. I didn't need to be coached in order\nto get through the work; it was all a matter of following established\ntechniques and precedents. I checked the coverage, reduced the claim to\ntape-code, fed the tapes into a machine.\n\nIf the claim was legitimate, the machine computed the amounts due and\nissued a punch-card check. If there was anything wrong, the machine\nflashed a red light and spat the faulty claim out into a hopper.\n\nAnd there were plenty of claims. Every adult in Naples, of course,\ncarried the conventional War-and-Disaster policy--the so-called Blue\nBolt coverage. Since few of them had actually been injured in the war,\nthe claims were small--mostly for cost of premiums on other policies,\nunder the disability clauses. (For if war prevented a policyholder from\nmeeting his Blue Plate premiums, for instance, the Company itself under\nBlue Bolt would keep his policies paid--and the policyholder fed.)\n\nBut there were some big claims, too. The Neapolitan government had\ncarried the conventional Blue Bolt policies and, though the policy\nhad been canceled by the Company before hostilities broke out--thus\nrelieving the Company of the necessity of paying damages to the\nprincipality of Naples itself--still there were all the subsidiary\nloss and damage claims of the Neapolitan government's bureaus and\ndepartments, almost every one of them non-canceling.\n\nIt amounted to billions and billions of lire. Just looking at the\namounts on some of the vouchers before me made my head swim. And the\nsame, of course, would be true in Sicily. Though that would naturally\nbe handled by the Sicilian office, not by us.\n\nHowever, the cost of this one brief, meager little war between Naples\nand Sicily, with less than ten thousand casualties, lasting hardly more\nthan a week, must have set the Company's reserves back hundreds of\nmillions of dollars.\n\nAnd to think that some people didn't like the Company! Why, without it,\nthe whole peninsula of Italy would have been in financial ruin, the\nsolvent areas dragged down with the combatants!\n\nNaturally, the Regional Office was understaffed for this volume of\nwork--which is why they had flown in new Adjusters like myself.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI looked up from my desk, surprised. Susan was standing next to me, an\naspirin and a paper cup of water in her hand. \"You look like you might\nneed this,\" she whispered. She winked and was gone.\n\nI swallowed it gratefully, although my hangover was almost gone. I was\nfinding in these dry papers all the romance and excitement I had joined\nthe Company's foreign service for. Here before me were human lives,\ndrama, tragedy, even an occasional touch of human-interest comedy.\n\nFor the Company was supporting most of Naples and whatever affected a\nNeapolitan life showed up somehow in the records of the Company.\n\nIt was a clean, _dedicated_ feeling to work for the Company. The monks\nof the Middle Ages might have had something of the same positive\nconviction that their work in the service of a mighty churchly empire\nwas right and just, but surely no one since.\n\nI attacked the mountain of forms with determination, taking pleasure in\nthe knowledge that every one I processed meant one life helped by the\nCompany.\n\nIt was plain in history, for all to see. Once the world had been\nturbulent and distressed, and the Company had smoothed it out. It had\nstarted with fires and disease. When the first primitive insurance\ncompanies--there were more than one, in the early days--began offering\nprotection against the hazards of fire, they had found it wise to\ntry to prevent fires. There were the advertising campaigns with\ntheir wistful-eyed bears pleading with smokers not to drop their\nlighted cigarettes in the dry forest; the technical bureaus like the\nUnderwriter's Laboratory, testing electrical equipment, devising\nintricate and homely gimmicks like the underwriter's knot; the\nFire Patrol in the big cities that followed up the city-owned Fire\nDepartment; the endless educational sessions in the schools.... And\nfires decreased.\n\nThen there was life insurance. Each time a death benefit was paid, a\ndigit rang up on the actuarial scoreboard. Was tuberculosis a major\nkiller? Establish mobile chest X-rays; alert the people to the meaning\nof a chronic cough. Was it heart disease? Explain the dangers of\noverweight, the idiocy of exercise past forty. People lived longer.\n\nHealth insurance followed the same pattern. It had begun by paying for\nbills incurred during sickness, and ended by providing full medical\nsickness prevention and treatment for all. Elaborate research programs\nreduced the danger of disease to nearly nothing. Only a few rare cases,\nlike that of Marianna....\n\nI shook myself away from the thought. Anyway, it was neither fire nor\nhealth insurance that concerned me now, but the Blue Bolt anti-war\ncomplex of the Company's policies. It was easy enough to see how it\nhad come about. For with fire and accident and disease ameliorated\nby the strong protecting hand of the Company, only one major hazard\nremained--war.\n\nAnd so the Company had logically and inevitably resolved to wipe out\nwar.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI looked up. It was Susan again, this time with a cardboard container\nof coffee.\n\n\"You're an angel,\" I said. She set the coffee down and turned to go. I\nlooked quickly around to make sure that Gogarty was busy, and stopped\nher. \"Tell me something?\"\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\n\"About this girl, Rena. Does she work for the Company?\"\n\nSusan giggled. \"Heavens, no. What an idea!\"\n\n\"What's so strange about it?\"\n\nShe straightened out her face. \"You'd better ask Sam--Mr. Gogarty, that\nis. Didn't you have a chance to talk to her last night? Or were you too\nbusy with other things?\"\n\n\"I only want to know how she happened to be with you.\"\n\nSusan shrugged. \"Sam thought you'd like to meet her, I guess. Really,\nyou'll have to ask him. All I know is that she's been in here quite\na lot about some claims. But she doesn't work here, believe me.\" She\nwrinkled her nose in amusement. \"And I won't work here either, if I\ndon't get back to my desk.\"\n\nI took the hint. By lunch time, I had got through a good half of the\naccumulation on my desk. I ate briefly and not too well at a nearby\n_trattoria_ with a \"B\" on the Blue Plate medallion in its window.\nAfter the dinner of the night before, I more than half agreed with\nGogarty's comments about the Blue Plate menus.\n\nGogarty called me over when I got back to the office. He said, \"I\nhaven't had a chance to talk to you about Luigi Zorchi.\"\n\nI nodded eagerly. I had been hoping for some explanations.\n\nGogarty went on, \"Since you were on the scene when he took his dive,\nyou might as well follow up. God knows you can't do worse than the rest\nof us.\"\n\nI said dubiously, \"Well, I saw the accident, if that's what you mean.\"\n\n\"Accident! What accident? This is the twelfth time he's done it, I tell\nyou.\" He tossed a file folder at me. \"Take a look! Loss of limbs--four\ntimes. Internal injuries--six times. Loss of vision, impaired hearing,\nhospitalization and so on--good lord, I can't count the number of\nseparate claims. And, every one, he has collected on. Go ahead, look it\nover.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI peered at the folder. The top sheet was a field report on the\nincident I had watched, when the locomotive of the Milan express had\nsevered both legs. The one below it, dated five weeks earlier, was for\nflash burns suffered in the explosion of a stove, causing the loss of\nthe right forearm nearly to the elbow.\n\nCurious, I thought, I hadn't noticed anything when I saw the man on the\nplatform. Still, I hadn't paid too much attention to him at first, and\nmodern prosthetic devices were nearly miraculous. I riffled through the\nred-bordered sheets. The fifth claim down, nearly two years before,\nwas--\n\nI yelped, \"Mr. Gogarty! This is a fraud!\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Look at this! 'On 21st October, the insured suffered severe injuries\nwhile trapped in a rising elevator with faulty safety equipment,\nresulting in loss of both legs above knees, multiple lacerations of--'\nWell, never mind the rest of it. But look at that, Mr. Gogarty! He\nalready lost both legs! He can't lose them twice, can he?\"\n\nGogarty sat back in his chair, looking at me oddly. \"You startled me,\"\nhe complained. \"Wills, what have I been trying to tell you? That's the\nwhole point, boy! No, he didn't lose his legs twice. It was _five_\ntimes!\"\n\nI goggled at him. \"But--\"\n\n\"But, but. But he did. Wait a minute--\" he held up a hand to stop my\nquestions--\"just take a look through the folder. See for yourself.\" He\nwaited while, incredulously, I finished going through the dossier. It\nwas true. I looked at Gogarty wordlessly.\n\nHe said resentfully, \"You see what we're up against? And none of\nthe things you are about to say would help. There is no mistake\nin the records--they've been double and triple-checked. There\nis no possibility that another man, or men, substituted for\nZorchi--fingerprints have checked every time. The three times he lost\nhis arms, retina-prints checked. There is no possibility that the\ndoctors were bribed, or that he lost a little bit more of his leg, for\ninstance, in each accident--the severed sections were recovered, and\nthey were complete. Wills, _this guy grows new arms and legs like a\ncrab_!\"\n\nI looked at him in a daze. \"What a fantastic scientific discovery!\" I\nsaid.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe snorted. \"Fantastic pain in the neck! Zorchi can't go on like this;\nhe'll bankrupt the Company. We can't stop him. Even when we were tipped\noff this time--we couldn't stop him. And I'll tell you true, Wills,\nthat platform was loaded with our men when Zorchi made his dive. You\nweren't the only Adjuster of the Company there.\"\n\nHe picked a folded sheet of paper out of his desk. \"Here. Zorchi is\nstill in the hospital; no visitors allowed today. But I want you to\ntake these credentials and go to see him tomorrow. You came to us with\na high recommendation from the Home Office, Wills--\" That made me look\nat him sharply, but his expression was innocent \"You're supposed to\nbe a man of intelligence and resourcefulness. See if you can come up\nwith some ideas on dealing with that situation. I'd handle it myself,\nbut I've got--\" he grimaced--\"certain other minor administrative\ndifficulties to deal with. Oh, nothing important, but you might as\nwell know that there appears to be a little, well, popular underground\nresentment toward the Company around here.\"\n\n\"Incredible!\" I said.\n\nHe looked at me thoughtfully for a moment. \"Well,\" he said, \"it's\nquitting time. See you in the morning.\"\n\nI had a lonely dinner at the same cheap restaurant where I'd had my\nlunch. I spent an hour in my room with my Company-issued _Adjuster's\nHandbook_, looking for some precedent that had some sort of bearing\non the case of a man who could grow new arms and legs. There wasn't\nanything, of course. I went out for a walk ... and still it wasn't\nnearly time for me to retire to bed.\n\nSo I did what I had been avoiding doing. I looked in the phone book\nfor Rena dell'Angela's number. There was, it developed, a Benedetto\ndell'Angela at the address she'd given the cab driver; but the phone\nwas disconnected.\n\nSo I wandered around some more, and then I went to sleep, dreaming\nabout Benedetto dell'Angela. I saw him as a leather-faced,\nwhite-bearded and courtly old gentleman. Rena's father, surely.\nPossibly even her elder brother. Certainly not her husband.\n\nIt was a dull finish to the first full day of my rich, exciting new\nlife....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe \"minor administrative difficulties\" got major. So I didn't get to\nsee Zorchi the next day, after all.\n\nA Junior Adjuster named Hammond--he was easily sixty, but the\nslow-moving, unenterprising type that would stay junior till the day he\ndied--came white-faced into the office a few minutes after opening and\nhuddled with Gogarty for a quarter of an hour.\n\nThen Gogarty called me over. He said, \"We're having a spot of trouble.\nHammond needs a little help; you're elected. Draw what you need, take\na couple of expediters along, report back to me this evening.\"\n\nHammond and I stopped at the cashier's office to draw three\ndispatch-cases full of lira-notes. Outside, an armored car was waiting\nfor us, with a full crew of six uniformed expediters. We raced off down\nthe narrow streets with the sirens wailing, climbing the long hill road\npast the radioactive remains of Capodichino, heading out toward the\nfarmlands.\n\nHammond worriedly filled me in on the way. He had got in early to his\nbranch office that morning, but no earlier than the first of a long\nline of policyholders. There had, it appeared, been some kind of rumor\nspread that the Company was running out of money. It was preposterous\non the face of it--after all, who _printed_ the money?--but you can't\nargue with a large group of people and, before the official hour of\nopening the branch, there were more than a hundred in the knotted line\noutside the door.\n\nHammond had rushed into the Naples office for help, leaving his staff\nto do the best they could. He said gloomily, staring out through the\nview-slits at the farmlands and vineyards we were passing through, \"I\njust hope we still have a branch office. This is a bad spot, Wills.\nCaserta. It got bombed out, you know; the whole southern end of the\ntown is radioactive. And it has a long history of trouble. Used to be\nthe summer royal seat of the old Italian monarchy; then the Americans\nused it for a command headquarters in the war Mussolini got into--the\nfirst atom war. It's been fought over time and again.\"\n\nI said reasonably, \"But don't they know the Company has all the\nresources in the world?\"\n\n\"Sure they do--when they're thinking. Right now they're not thinking.\nThey've got it in their heads that the Company isn't going to pay off.\nThey're scared. You can't tell them anything. You can't even give them\nchecks--they want cash on the line.\"\n\nI said, \"That's pretty silly, isn't it? I mean--ugh!\" I retched, as\nI suddenly got a whiff of the most unpleasant and penetrating odor I\nhad ever encountered in my life. It was like death and destruction in\ngaseous form; a sickly sweet, clinging stink that oozed in through the\npores of my skin to turn my stomach. \"Wow!\" I said, gasping.\n\nHammond looked at me in bewilderment; then he grinned sourly. \"New\nhere, aren't you?\" he inquired. \"That's hemp. They grow the stuff\nfor the fibers; and to get the fibers out, they let it get good and\nrotten. You'll get used to it,\" he promised.\n\nI tried. I tried pretty hard to get used to it; I hardly heard a word\nhe said all the rest of the way in to Caserta, I was trying so hard.\nBut I didn't get used to it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen I had my mind taken off my troubles. The branch was still doing\nbusiness when we got there, though there were easily three or four\nhundred angrily shouting policyholders milling around in front of it.\nThey scattered before us as the armored car came racing in; we skidded\nto a stop, siren blasting, and the expediters leaped out with their\nweapons at the ready.\n\nHammond and I climbed out of the armored car with our bags of money.\nThere was an audible excitement in the crowd as the word spread back\nthat the Company had brought in enormous stores of lire, more than any\nman had ever seen, to pay off the claims. We could hear the chatter of\nmany voices, and we almost could feel the tension slack off.\n\nIt looked like the trouble was over.\n\nThen there was a shrill whistle. It sounded very much like the alarm\nwhistle of one of our expediters but, thinking back, I have never been\nsure.\n\nPerhaps it was a nervous expediter, perhaps it was an agent provocateur\nin the crowd. But, whoever pulled the trigger, the explosion went off.\n\nThere was a ragged yell from the crowd, and rocks began whizzing\nthrough the air. The pacifists in the mob began heading for the\ndoorways and alleys around; women screamed, men shouted and bellowed,\nand for a moment it looked like we would be swamped. For not very many\nof them were pacifists, and there were at least a hundred screaming,\ngesticulating men lunging at us.\n\nOne cobblestone shattered the theoretically unbreakable windshield of\nthe truck next to my head; then the expediters, gas guns spitting, were\nringing around us to protect the money.\n\nIt was a short fight but vicious. By the time the first assault was\nrepulsed there were at least fifty persons lying motionless in the\nstreet.\n\nI had never seen that sort of violence before. It did something to\nmy stomach. I stood weaving, holding to the armored car, while the\nexpediters circled the area around the branch office, firing hurry-up\nshots at the running rioters. Hammond looked at me questioningly.\n\n\"That smell,\" I said apologetically.\n\nHe said only, \"Sure.\" True, the fetid aroma from the hemp fields was\nbillowing all around us, but he knew as well as I that it was not the\nsmell that was bothering me.\n\nIn a few moments, as we were locking the bags of money into the office\nsafe, red-crossed vehicles bearing the Company insignia appeared in the\nstreet outside, and medics began tending to the victims. Each one got\na shot of something--an antidote to the sleep-gas from the expediters'\nguns, I guessed--and was loaded unceremoniously into the ambulances.\n\nHammond appeared beside me. \"Ready for business?\" he asked. \"They'll be\nback any minute now, the ones that can still walk. We'll be paying off\nuntil midnight, the way it looks.\"\n\nI said, \"Sure. That--that gas doesn't hurt them any, does it? I mean,\nafter they go to the hospital they'll be all right, won't they?\"\n\nHammond, twirling a pencil in his fingers, stared broodingly at the\nmotionless body of one policyholder. He was a well-dressed man of fifty\nor so, with a reddish mustache, unusual in that area, and shattered\nrimless glasses. Not at all the type I would expect to see in a street\nfight; probably, I thought, a typical innocent bystander.\n\nHammond said absently, \"Oh, sure. They'll be all right. Never know what\nhit them.\" There was a tiny sharp _crack_ and the two halves of the\npencil fell to the floor. He looked at it in surprise. \"Come on, Wills.\nLet's get to work.\"\n\n\nIII\n\nOf course I still believed in the Company.\n\nBut all the same, it was the first time since I went to work for the\nCompany that I had even had to ask myself that question.\n\nThat long, long day in Hammond's puny little branch office, sweltering\nin the smell of the hemp fields, pushing across the mountains of lire\nto the grim-faced policyholders left me a little less sure of things.\nNearly all of the first hundred or so to pass my desk had been in\nthe crowd that the expediters had fired on. A few had fresh bandages\nto show where stones had missed the expediters, but found targets\nall the same. Nearly all of them were hostile. There was no casual\nconversation, very few \"_Grazies_\" as they received their payments.\n\nBut at last the day was at an end. Hammond snapped an order to one\nof the clerks, who shoved his way through the dwindling line to close\nthe door and bang down the shutters. I put through the last few\napplications, and we were through.\n\nIt was hot and muggy out in the streets of New Caserta. Truce teams\nof expediters were patrolling the square, taken off their regular\nassignments of enforcing the peace between Naples and Sicily to keep\ndown Caserta's own mobs. Hammond suggested dinner, and we went to a\nlittle Blue Plate in the palace itself.\n\nHammond held Class-A food policies, but he was politeness itself;\nhe voluntarily led the way to the Class-B area. We presented our\npolicy-cards to the waiter for canceling, and sat back to enjoy the air\nconditioning.\n\nI was still troubled over the violence. I said, \"Has there been any\ntrouble around here before?\"\n\nHammond said ruefully, \"Plenty. All over Europe, if you want my\nopinion. Of course, you never see it in the papers, but I've heard\nstories from field workers. They practically had a revolution in the\nSudeten strip after the Prague-Vienna affair.\" He stopped talking as\nthe waiter set his Meal-of-the-Day in front of him. Hammond looked at\nit sourly. \"Oh, the hell with it, Wills,\" he said. \"Have a drink with\nme to wash this stuff down.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe ordered liquor, and Hammond shoved his Class-A card at the waiter.\nI am not a snoop, but I couldn't help noticing that the liquor coupons\nwere nearly all gone; at his present rate, Hammond would use up his\nyear's allotment by the end of the summer, and be paying cash for his\ndrinks.\n\nDinner was dull. Hammond made it dull, because he was much more\ninterested in his drinking than in me. Though I was never much of\na drinker, I'd had a little experience in watching others tank up;\nHammond I classified as the surly and silent type. He wasn't quite rude\nto me, but after the brandy with his coffee, and during the three or\nfour straight whiskies that followed that, he hardly spoke to me at all.\n\nWe left the Blue Plate in a strained silence and, after the cooled\nrestaurant, the heat outside was painful. The air was absolutely\nstatic, and the odor from the hemp fields soaked into our clothes like\na bath in a sewer.\n\nOverhead it was nearly dark, and there were low black clouds. \"We'd\nbetter get going,\" I ventured. \"Looks like rain.\"\n\nHammond said nothing, only grunted. He lurched ahead of me toward the\nnarrow street that led back to the branch office, where our transport\nwas waiting.\n\nThe distance was easily half a mile. Now I am not terribly lazy, and\neven in the heat I was willing enough to walk. But I didn't want to get\ncaught in a rain. Maybe it was superstition on my part--I knew that the\ndanger was really slight--but I couldn't forget that three separate\natomic explosions had gone off in the area around Caserta and Naples\nwithin only a few months, and there was going to be a certain amount\nof radioactivity in every drop of rain that fell for a hundred miles\naround.\n\nI started to tell Hammond about it, but he made a disgusted noise and\nstumbled ahead.\n\nIt wasn't as if we had to walk. Caserta was not well equipped with\ncabs, but there were a few; and both Hammond and myself ranked high\nenough in the Company to have been able to get a lift from one of the\nexpediter cars that were cruising about.\n\nThere was a flare of lightning over the eastern mountains and, in\na moment, the pounding roll of thunder. And a flat globule of rain\nsplattered on my face.\n\nI said, \"Hammond, let's wait here for a lift.\"\n\nSurprisingly he came along with me.\n\nIf he hadn't, I would have left him in the street.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe were in a street of tenements. It was almost deserted; I rapped on\nthe nearest door. No answer, no sound inside. I rapped again, then\ntried the door. It was locked.\n\nThe next door--ancient and rickety as the first--was also locked,\nand no one answered. The third door, no one answered. By then it was\nraining hard; the knob turned under my fingers, and we stepped inside.\n\nWe left the door ajar, on the chance that a squad car or cab might\npass, and for light. It was almost dark outside, apart from the light\nfrom the lightning flashes, but even so it was darker within. There was\nno light at all in the narrow, odorous hall; not even a light seeping\nunder the apartment doors.\n\nIn the lightning flare, Hammond's face was pale. He was beginning to\nsober up, and his manner was uneasy.\n\nWe were there perhaps half an hour in that silent hall, watching the\nrain sleet down and the lightning flare and listening to the thunder.\nTwo or three times, squad cars passed, nosing slowly down the drenched\nstreets, but though Hammond looked longingly at them, I still didn't\nwant to get wet.\n\nThen the rain slowed and almost simultaneously a civilian cab appeared\nat the head of the block. \"Come on,\" I said, tugging at his arm.\n\nHe balked. \"Wait for a squad car,\" he mumbled.\n\n\"Why? Come on, Hammond, it may start to pour again in a minute.\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\nHis behavior was exasperating me. Clearly it wasn't that he was too\nniggardly to pay for the cab; it was almost as if he were delaying\ngoing back to the branch office for some hidden reason. But that was\nridiculous, of course.\n\nI said, \"Look, you can stay here if you want to, but I'm going.\" I\njumped out of the doorway just in time to flag the cab; it rolled to\na stop, and the driver backed to where I was standing. As I got in, I\nlooked once more to the doorway where Hammond was standing, his face\nunreadable.\n\nHe made a gesture of some sort, but the lightning flashed again and I\nskipped into the cab. When I looked again he was invisible inside the\ndoorway, and I told the driver to take me to the branch office of the\nCompany.\n\nCurious; but it was not an end to curious things that night. At the\nbranch office, my car was waiting to take me back to Naples.\n\nI surrendered my travel coupons to the cab driver and jumped from one\nvehicle to the other.\n\nBefore my driver could start, someone appeared at the window of the car\nand a sharp voice said, \"Un momento, Signore 'Ammond!\"\n\nI stared at the man, a rather badly dressed Neapolitan. I said angrily,\n\"Hammond isn't here!\"\n\nThe man's expression changed. It had been belligerent; it now became\nastonished and apologetic. \"A thousand times excuse me,\" he said. \"The\nSignore 'Ammond, can you say where he is?\"\n\nI hesitated, but only for a moment. I didn't like the little man\npeering in my window, however humble and conciliatory he had become. I\nsaid abruptly, \"No.\" And my driver took off, leaving the man standing\nthere.\n\nI turned to look back at him as we drove off.\n\nIt was ridiculous, but the way he was standing as we left, holding one\nhand in his pocket, eyes narrowed and thoughtful, made me think that he\nwas carrying a gun.\n\nBut, of course, that was impossible. The Company didn't permit lethal\nweapons, and who in all the world would challenge a rule of the Company?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen I showed up in the Naples office the next morning, Susan had my\ncoffee ready and waiting for me. I said gratefully, \"Bless you.\"\n\nShe chuckled. \"That's not all,\" she said. \"Here's something else you\nmight like. Just remember though, if anyone asks, you got it out of the\nfiles yourself.\"\n\nShe slipped a folder under the piles of forms on my desk and\ndisappeared. I peered at it curiously. It was labeled: \"Policy\nBNT-3KT-890776, Blue Bolt Comprehensive. Insuree: Renata dell'Angela.\"\n\nI could have been no more grateful had she given me the Company Mint.\n\nBut I had no chance to examine it. Gogarty was calling for me. I\nhastily swallowed my coffee and reported for orders.\n\nThey were simple enough. The appointment with Zorchi that I hadn't been\nable to keep the day before was set up for right then. I was already\nlate and I had to leave without another glance at Rena's file.\n\nThe hospital Zorchi honored with his patronage was a marble-halled\npalace on the cliffs that rimmed the southern edge of the Bay of\nNaples. It was a luxurious, rich man's hospital, stuffy with its\nopulence; but the most opulent of all was the plush-lined three-room\nsuite where Zorchi was.\n\nA white-robed sister of some religious order led me into a silent\nelevator and along a statued hall. She tapped on a door, and left me in\nthe care of a sharp-faced young man with glasses who introduced himself\nas Mr. Zorchi's secretary.\n\nI explained my business. He contemptuously waved me to a brocaded\nchair, and left me alone for a good half hour.\n\nBy the time Zorchi was ready to see me, I was boiling. Nobody could\ntreat a representative of the Company like an errand boy! I did my best\nto take into consideration the fact that he had just undergone major\nsurgery--first under the wheels of the train, then under the knives of\nthree of Naples' finest surgeons.\n\nI said as pleasantly as I could, \"I'm glad to see you at last.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe dark face on the pink embroidered pillow turned coldly toward me.\n\"Che volete?\" he demanded. The secretary opened his mouth to translate.\n\nI said quickly, \"Scus\u00ed; parlo un po' la lingua. Non bisogno un\ntraduttore.\"\n\nZorchi said languidly in Italian, \"In that case, Mario, you may go.\nWhat do you want with me, Weels?\"\n\nI explained my duties as a Claims Adjuster for the Company, pointing\nout that it was my task, indeed my privilege, to make settlement for\ninjuries covered by Company policies. He listened condescendingly. I\nwatched him carefully while I talked, trying to estimate the approach\nhe might respond to if I was to win his confidence.\n\nHe was far from an attractive young man, I thought. No longer behind\nthe shabby porter's uniform he had worn on the platform of the station,\nhe still had an unkempt and slipshod appearance, despite the heavy\nsilken dressing gown he wore and the manifest costliness of his room.\nThe beard was still on his face; it, at least, had not been a disguise.\nIt was not an attractive beard. It had been weeks, at the least, since\nany hand had trimmed it to shape and his hair was just as shaggy.\n\nZorchi was not impressed with my friendly words. When I had finished,\nhe said coldly, \"I have had claims against the Company before, Weels.\nWhy is it that this time you make speeches at me?\"\n\nI said carefully, \"Well, you must admit you are a rather unusual case.\"\n\n\"Case?\" He frowned fiercely. \"I am no case, Weels. I am Zorchi, if you\nplease.\"\n\n\"Of course, of course. I only mean to say that--\"\n\n\"That I am a statistic, eh?\" He bobbed his head. \"Surely. I comprehend.\nBut I am not a statistic, you see. Or, at best, I am a statistic which\nwill not fit into your electronic machines, am I not?\"\n\nI admitted, \"As I say, you are a rather unusual ca--a rather unusual\nperson, Mr. Zorchi.\"\n\nHe grinned coldly. \"Good. We are agreed. Now that we have come to that\nunderstanding, are we finished with this interview?\"\n\nI coughed. \"Mr. Zorchi, I'll be frank with you.\" He snorted, but I went\non, \"According to your records, this claim need not be paid. You see,\nyou already have been paid for total disability, both a lump sum and a\ncontinuing settlement. There is no possibility of two claims for the\nloss of your legs, you must realize.\"\n\nHe looked at me with a touch of amusement. \"I must?\" he asked. \"It\nis odd. I have discussed this, you understand, with many attorneys.\nThe premiums were paid, were they not? The language of the policy\nis clear, is it not? My legs--would you like to observe the stumps\nyourself?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe flung the silken covers off. I averted my eyes from the\nwhite-bandaged lower half of his torso, hairy and scrawny and horribly\n_less_ than a man's legs should be.\n\nI said desperately, \"Perhaps I spoke too freely. I do not mean, Mr.\nZorchi, that we will not pay your claim. The Company _always_ lives up\nto the letter of its contracts.\"\n\nHe covered himself casually. \"Very well. Give the check to my\nsecretary, please. Are you concluded?\"\n\n\"Not quite.\" I swallowed. I plunged right in. \"Mr. Zorchi, what the\nhell are you up to? How do you do it? There isn't any fraud, I admit\nit. You really lost your legs--more than once. You grew new ones. But\nhow? Don't you realize how important this is? If you can do it, why not\nothers? If you are in some way pecu--that is, if the structure of your\nbody is in some way different from that of others, won't you help us\nfind out how so that we can learn from it? It isn't necessary for you\nto live as you do, you know.\"\n\nHe was looking at me with a hint of interest in his close-set, dull\neyes. I continued, \"Even if you can grow new legs, do you _enjoy_ the\npain of having them cut off? Have you ever stopped to think that some\nday, perhaps, you will miscalculate, and the wheels of the train, or\nthe truck, or whatever you use, may miss your legs and kill you?\nThat's no way for a man to live, Mr. Zorchi. Why not talk freely to me,\nlet me help you? Why not take the Company into your confidence, instead\nof living by fraud and deceit and--\"\n\nI had gone too far. Livid, he snarled, \"Ass! That will cost your\nCompany, I promise. Is it fraud for me to suffer like this? Do I enjoy\nit, do you think? Look, ass!\" He flung the covers aside again, ripped\nat the white bandages with his hands--Blood spurted. He uncovered the\nraw stumps and jerked them at me.\n\nI do not believe any sight of my life shocked me as much as that; it\nwas worse than the Caserta hemp fields, worse than the terrible _gone_\nmoment when Marianna died, worse than anything I could imagine.\n\nHe raved, \"See this fraud, look at it closely! Truly, I grow new legs,\nbut does that make it easier to lose the old? It is the pain of being\nborn, Weels, a pain you will never know! I grow legs, I grow arms, I\ngrow eyes. I will never die! I will live on like a reptile or a fish.\"\n\nHis eyes were staring. Ignoring the blood spurting from his stumps,\nignoring my attempts to say something, he pounded his abdomen. \"Twelve\ntimes I have been cut--do you see even a scar? My appendix, it is bad;\nit traps filth, and the filth makes me sick. And I have it cut out--and\nit grows again; and I have it cut out again, and it grows back. And the\npain, Weels, the pain never stops!\" He flung the robe open, slapped his\nnarrow, hairy chest.\n\nI gasped. Under the scraggly hair was a rubble of boils and wens,\nbreaking and matting the hair as he struck himself in frenzy. \"Envy me,\nWeels!\" he shouted. \"Envy the man whose body defends itself against\neverything! I will live forever, I promise it, and I will always be in\npain, and someone will pay for every horrible moment of it! Now get\nout, get out!\"\n\nI left under the hating eyes of the sharp-faced secretary who silently\nled me to the door.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI had put Zorchi through a tantrum and subjected myself to as\ndisagreeable a time as I'd ever had. And I hadn't accomplished a thing.\nI knew that well enough. And if I hadn't known it by myself, I would\nhave found out.\n\nGogarty pointed it out to me, in detail. \"You're a big disappointment\nto me,\" he moaned sourly. \"Ah, the hell with it. What were you trying\nto accomplish, anyway?\"\n\nI said defensively, \"I thought I might appeal to his altruism. After\nall, you didn't give me very explicit instructions.\"\n\n\"I didn't tell you to remember to wipe your nose either,\" he said\nbitterly. He shook his head, the anger disappearing. \"Well,\" he said\ndisconsolately, \"I don't suppose we're any worse off than we were.\nI guess I'd better try this myself.\" He must have caught a hopeful\nanticipatory gleam in my eye, because he said quickly, \"Not right now,\nWills. You've made that impossible. I'll just have to wait until he\ncools off.\"\n\nI said nothing; just stood there waiting for him to let me go. I was\nsorry things hadn't worked out but, after all, he had very little to\ncomplain about. Besides, I wanted to get back to my desk and the folder\nabout Rena dell'Angela. It wasn't so much that I was interested in her\nas a person, I reminded myself. I was just curious....\n\nOnce again, I had to stay curious for a while. Gogarty had other plans\nfor me. Before I knew what was happening, I was on my way out of the\noffice again, this time to visit another Neapolitan hospital, where\nsome of the severely injured in the recent war were waiting final\nsettlement of their claims. It was a hurry-up matter, which had been\npostponed too many times already; some of the injured urgently required\nmajor medical treatment, and the hospital was howling for approval of\ntheir claims before they'd begin treatment.\n\nThis one was far from a marble palace. It had the appearance of a\nstucco tenement, and all of the patients were in wards. I was a little\nsurprised to see expediters guarding the entrance.\n\nI asked one of them, \"Anything wrong?\"\n\nHe looked at me with a flicker of astonishment, recognizing the\ndouble-breasted Claim Adjuster uniform, surprised, I think, at my\nasking him a question. \"Not as long as we're here, sir,\" he said.\n\n\"I mean, I was wondering what you were doing here.\"\n\nThe surprise became overt. \"Vaults,\" he said succinctly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI prodded no further. I knew what he meant by vaults, of course. It\nwas part of the Company's beneficent plan for ameliorating the effects\nof even such tiny wars as the Naples-Sicily affair that those who\nsuffered radiation burns got the best treatment possible. And the best\ntreatment, of course, was suspended animation. The deadly danger of\nradiation burns lay in their cumulative effect; the first symptoms\nwere nothing, the man was well and able to walk about. Degeneration\nof the system followed soon, the marrow of the bone gave up on its\ntask of producing white corpuscles, the blood count dropped, the tiny\nradiant poisons in his blood spread and worked their havoc. If he could\nbe gotten through the degenerative period he might live. But, if he\nlived, he would still die. That is, if his life processes continued,\nthe radiation sickness would kill him. The answer was to stop the life\nprocess, temporarily, by means of the injections and deep-freeze in\nthe vaults. It was used for more than radiation, of course. Marianna,\nfor instance--\n\nWell, anyway, that was what the vaults were. These were undoubtedly\njust a sort of distribution point, where local cases were received and\nkept until they could be sent to the main Company vaults up the coast\nat Anzio.\n\nI wasn't questioning the presence of vaults there; I was only curious\nwhy the Company felt they needed guarding.\n\nI found myself so busy, though, that I had no time to think about it.\nA good many of the cases in this shabby hospital really needed the\nCompany's help. But a great many of them were obvious attempts at fraud.\n\nThere was a woman, for instance, in the maternity ward. During the war,\nshe'd had to hide out after the Capodichino bombing and hadn't been\nable to reach medical service. So her third child was going to be a\ngirl, and she was asking indemnity under the gender-guarantee clause.\nBut she had only Class-C coverage and her first two had been boys; a\ndaughter was permissible in any of the first four pregnancies. She\nbegan swearing at me before I finished explaining these simple facts to\nher.\n\nI walked out of the ward, hot under the collar. Didn't these people\nrealize we were trying to help them? They didn't appear to be aware of\nit. Only the terribly injured, the radiation cases, the amputees, the\nones under anesthetic--only these gave me no arguments, mainly because\nthey couldn't talk.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMost of them were on their way to the vaults, I found. My main job was\nrevision of their policies to provide for immobilization. Inevitably,\nthere are some people who will try to take advantage of anything.\n\nThe retirement clause in the basic contract was the joker here.\nConsidering that the legal retirement age under the universal Blue\nHeaven policy was seventy-five years--calendar years, not metabolic\nyears--there were plenty of invalids who wanted a few years in the\nvaults for reasons that had nothing to do with health. If they could\nsleep away two or three decades, they could, they thought, emerge at a\nphysical age of forty or so and live idly off the Company the rest of\ntheir lives.\n\nThey naturally didn't stop to think that if any such practice became\ncommon the Company would simply be unable to pay claims. And they\ncertainly didn't think, or care that, if the Company went bankrupt,\nthe world as we knew it would end.\n\nIt was a delicate problem; we couldn't deny them medical care, but we\ncouldn't permit them the vaults unless they were either in clearly\nurgent need, or were willing to sign an extension waiver to their\npolicies....\n\nI saw plenty of that, that afternoon. The radiation cases were the\nworst, in that way, because they still could talk and argue. Even while\nthey were being loaded with drugs, even while they could see with their\nown eyes the blood-count graph dipping lower and lower, they still\ncomplained at being asked to sign the waiver.\n\nThere was even some fear of the vaults themselves--though every living\nhuman had surely seen the Company's indoctrination films that showed\nhow the injected drugs slowed life processes and inhibited the body's\nown destructive enzymes; how the apparently lifeless body, down to\nambient air temperature, would be slipped into its hermetic plastic\nsack and stacked away, row on row, far underground, to sleep away the\nmonths or years or, if necessary, the centuries. Time meant nothing to\nthe suspendees. It was hard to imagine being afraid of as simple and\nnatural a process as that!\n\nAlthough I had to admit that the vaults looked a lot like morgues....\n\nI didn't enjoy it. I kept thinking of Marianna. She had feared the\nvaults too, in the childish, unreasoning, feminine way that was her\ncharacteristic. When the Blue Blanket technicians had turned up the\ndiagnosis of leukemia, they had proposed the sure-thing course of\nputting her under suspension while the slow-acting drugs--specially\ntreated to operate even under those conditions--worked their cure,\nbut she had refused. There had been, they admitted, a ninety-nine and\nnine-tenths per cent prospect of a cure without suspension....\n\nIt just happened that Marianna was in the forlorn one-tenth that died.\n\nI couldn't get her out of my mind. The cases who protested or whined or\npleaded or shrieked that they were being tortured and embalmed alive\ndidn't help. I was glad when the afternoon was over and I could get\nback to the office.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs I came in the door, Gogarty was coming in, too, from the barbershop\ndownstairs. He was freshly shaved and beaming.\n\n\"Quitting time, Tom,\" he said amiably, though his eyes were memorizing\nthe pile of incomplete forms on my desk. \"All work and no play, you\nknow.\" He nudged me. \"Not that you need reminding, eh? Still, you ought\nto tell your girl that she shouldn't call you on office time, Tom.\"\n\n\"Call me? Rena called me?\"\n\nHe nodded absently, intent on the desk. \"Against Company rules, you\nknow. Say, I don't like to push you, but aren't you running a little\nbehind here?\"\n\nI said with some irritation, \"I don't have much chance to catch up, the\nway I've been racing around the country, you know. And there's plenty\nto be done.\"\n\nHe said soothingly, \"Now, take it easy, Tom. I was only trying to say\nthat there might be some easier way to handle these things.\" He speared\na form, glanced over it casually. He frowned. \"Take this, for instance.\nThe claim is for catching cold as a result of exposure during the\nevacuation of Cerignola. What would you do with that one?\"\n\n\"Why--pay it, I suppose.\"\n\n\"And put in the paper work? Suppose it's a phony, Tom? Not one case of\ncoryza in fifty is genuine.\"\n\n\"What would you do?\" I asked resentfully.\n\nHe said without hesitation, \"Send it back with Form CBB-23A192. Ask for\nlaboratory smear-test reports.\"\n\nI looked over the form. A long letter was attached; it said in more\ndetail than was necessary that there had been no laboratory service\nduring the brief war, at least where the policyholder happened to be,\nand therefore he could submit only the affidavits of three registered\nphysicians. It looked like a fair claim to me. If it was up to me, I\nwould have paid it automatically.\n\nI temporized. \"Suppose it's legitimate?\"\n\n\"Suppose it is? Look at it this way, Tom. If it's phoney, this will\nscare him off, and you'd be saving the Company the expense and\nembarrassment of paying off a fraudulent claim. If it's legitimate,\nhe'll resubmit it--at a time when, perhaps, we won't be so busy.\nMeanwhile that's one more claim handled and disposed of, for our\nprogress reports to the Home Office.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI stared at him unbelievingly. But he looked back in perfect calm,\nuntil my eyes dropped. After all, I thought, he was right in a way.\nThe mountain of work on my desk was certainly a log-jam, and it had to\nbe broken somehow. Maybe rejecting this claim would work some small\nhardship in an individual case, but what about the hundreds and\nthousands of others waiting for attention? Wasn't it true that no small\nhardship to an individual was as serious as delaying all those others?\n\nIt was, after all, that very solicitude for the people at large that\nthe Company relied on for its reputation--that, and the iron-clad\nguarantee of prompt and full settlement.\n\nI said, \"I suppose you're right.\"\n\nHe nodded, and turned away. Then he paused. \"I didn't mean to bawl you\nout for that phone call, Tom,\" he said. \"Just tell her about the rule,\nwill you?\"\n\n\"Sure. Oh, one thing.\" He waited. I coughed. \"This girl, Rena. I don't\nknow much about her, you know. Is she, well, someone you know?\"\n\nHe said, \"Heavens, no. She was making a pest out of herself around\nhere, frankly. She has a claim, but not a very good one. I don't know\nall the details, because it's encoded, but the machines turned it down\nautomatically. I do know that she, uh--\" he sort of half winked--\"wants\na favor. Her old man is in trouble. I'll look it up for you some time,\nif you want, and get the details. I think he's in the cooler--that is,\nthe clinic--up at Anzio.\"\n\nHe scratched his plump jowls. \"I didn't think it was fair to you\nfor me to have a girl at dinner and none for you; Susan promised to\nbring someone along, and this one was right here, getting in the way.\nShe said she liked Americans, so I told her you would be assigned to\nher case.\" This time he did wink. \"No harm, of course. You certainly\nwouldn't be influenced by any, well, personal relationship, if you\nhappened to get into one. Oh, a funny thing. She seemed to recognize\nyour name.\"\n\n_That_ was a jolt. \"She what?\"\n\nGogarty shrugged. \"Well, she reacted to it. 'Thomas Wills,' I said.\nShe'd been acting pretty stand-offish, but she warmed up quick. Maybe\nshe just likes the name, but right then is when she told me she liked\nAmericans.\"\n\nI cleared my throat. \"Mr. Gogarty,\" I said determinedly, \"please get\nme straight on something. You say this girl's father is in some kind\nof trouble, and you imply she knows me. I want to know if you've ever\nhad any kind of report, or even heard any kind of rumor, that would\nmake you think that I was in the least sympathetic to any anti-Company\ngroups? I'm aware that there were stories--\"\n\nHe stopped me. \"I never heard any, Tom,\" he said definitely.\n\nI hesitated. It seemed like a good time to open up to Gogarty; I\nopened my mouth to start, but I was too late. Susan called him off for\nwhat she claimed was an urgent phone call and, feeling let-down, I\nwatched him waddle away.\n\nBecause it was, after all, time that I took down my back hair with my\nboss.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWell, I hadn't done anything too terribly bad--anyway, I hadn't _meant_\nto do anything bad. And the circumstances sort of explained it, in a\nway. And it was all in the past, and--\n\nAnd nothing. I faced the facts. I had spent three solid weeks getting\nblind drunk, ranting and raving and staggering up to every passer-by\nwho would listen and whining to him that the Company was evil, the\nCompany was murderous, the Company had killed my wife.\n\nThere was no denying it. And I had capped it all off one bleary\nmidnight, with a brick through the window of the Company branch office\nthat served my home. It was only a drunken piece of idiocy, I kept\ntelling myself. But it was a drunken piece of idiocy that landed me in\njail, that had been permanently indorsed on every one of my policies,\nthat was in the confidential pages of my Company service record. It\nwas a piece of idiocy that anyone might have done. But it would have\nmeant deep trouble for me, if it hadn't been for the intercession of my\nwife's remote relative, Chief Underwriter Defoe.\n\nIt was he who had bailed me out. He had never told me how he had found\nout that I was in jail. He appeared, read the riot-act to me and got\nme out. He put me over the coals later, yes, but he'd bailed me out.\nHe'd told me I was acting like a child--and convinced me of it, which\nwas harder. And when he was convinced I had snapped out of it, he\npersonally backed me for an appointment to the Company's school as a\ncadet Claims Adjuster.\n\nI owed a considerable debt of gratitude to my ex-remote-in-law, Chief\nUnderwriter Defoe.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhile I still was brooding, Gogarty came back. He looked unhappy.\n\"Hammond,\" he said bitterly. \"He's missing. Look, was he drunk when\nyou left him last night?\" I nodded. \"Thought so. Never showed up for\nwork. Not at his quarters. The daily ledger's still open at his office,\nbecause there's no responsible person to sign it. So naturally I've got\nto run out to Caserta now, and what Susan will say--\" He muttered away.\n\nI remembered the file that was buried under the papers on my desk, when\nhe mentioned Susan's name.\n\nAs soon as he was out of the office, I had it open.\n\nAnd as soon as I had it open, I stared at it in shock.\n\nThe title page of the sheaf inside was headed: Signorina Renata\ndell'Angela. Age 22; daughter of Benedetto dell'Angela; accepted to\ngeneral Class-AA; no employment. There were more details.\n\nBut across all, in big red letters, was a rubber stamp: _Policy\nCanceled. Reassigned Class-E._\n\nIt meant that the sad-eyed Rena was completely uninsurable.\n\n\nIV\n\nPhone or no phone, I still had her address.\n\nIt was still daylight when I got out of the cab, and I had a chance\nfor a good look at the house. It was a handsome place by day; the size\nof the huge white stucco wall didn't fit the _uninsurable_ notation\non Rena's claim. That wall enclosed a garden; the garden could hardly\nhold less than an AA house. And Class-Es were ordinarily either sent to\npublic hostels--at the Company's expense, to be sure--or existed on\nthe charity of friends or relatives. And Class-Es seldom had friends in\nClass-AA houses.\n\nI knocked at the gate. A fat woman, age uncertain but extreme, opened a\nlittle panel and peered at me. I asked politely, \"Miss dell'Angela?\"\n\nThe woman scowled. \"Che dice?\"\n\nI repeated: \"May I see Miss dell'Angela? I'm a Claims Adjuster for the\nCompany. I have some business with her in connection with her policies.\"\n\n\"Ha!\" said the woman. She left it at that for a moment, pursing her\nlips and regarding me thoughtfully. Then she shrugged apathetically.\n\"Momento,\" she said wearily, and left me standing outside the gate.\n\nFrom inside there was a muttering of unfamiliar voices. I thought I\nheard a door open, and the sound of steps, but when the fat woman came\nback she was alone.\n\nSilently she opened the door and nodded me in. I started automatically\nup the courtyard toward the enclosed house, but she caught my arm and\nmotioned me toward another path. It led down a flowered lane through a\ngrape arbor to what might, at one time, have been a caretaker's hut.\n\nI knocked on the door of the hut, comprehending where Rena dell'Angela\nlived as a Class-E uninsurable.\n\nRena herself opened it, her face flushed, her expression\nsurprised--apprehensive, almost, I thought at first. It was the first\ntime I had seen her by daylight. She was--oh, there was no other word.\nShe was lovely.\n\nShe said quickly, \"Mr. Wills! I didn't expect you.\"\n\nI said, \"You phoned me. I came as soon as I could.\"\n\nShe hesitated. \"I did,\" she admitted. \"It was--I'm sorry, Mr. Wills. It\nwas an impulse. I shouldn't have done it.\"\n\n\"What was it, Rena?\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"I am sorry. It doesn't matter. But I am a bad\nhostess; won't you come in?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe room behind the door was long and narrow, with worn furniture and\na door that led, perhaps, to another room behind. It seemed dusty and,\nhating myself as a snooping fool, I took careful note that there was a\nfaint aroma of tobacco. I had been quite sure that she didn't smoke,\nthat evening we had met.\n\nShe gestured at a chair--there only were two, both pulled up to a crude\nwooden table, on which were two poured cups of coffee. \"Please sit\ndown,\" she invited.\n\nI reminded myself that it was, after all, none of my business if she\nchose to entertain friends--even friends who smoked particularly rancid\ntobacco. And if they preferred not to be around when I came to the\ndoor, why, that was their business, not mine. I said cautiously, \"I\ndidn't mean to interrupt you.\"\n\n\"Interrupt me?\" She saw my eyes on the cups. \"Oh--oh, no, Mr. Wills.\nThat other cup is for you, you see. I poured it when Luisa told me\nyou were at the gate. It isn't very good, I'm afraid,\" she said\napologetically.\n\nI made an effort to sip the coffee; it was terrible. I set it down.\n\"Rena, I just found out about your policies. Believe me, I'm sorry. I\nhadn't known about it, when we had dinner together; I would have--Well,\nI don't know what I would have done. There isn't much I can do,\ntruthfully; I don't want you thinking I have any great power. But I\nwish I had known--I might not have made you cry, at any rate.\"\n\nShe smiled an odd sort of smile. \"That wasn't the reason, Mr. Wills.\"\n\n\"Please call me Tom. Well, then, why did you cry?\"\n\n\"It is of no importance. Please.\"\n\nI coughed and tried a different tack. \"You understand that I do have\n_some_ authority. And I would like to help you if I can--if you'll let\nme.\"\n\n\"Let you? How could I prevent it?\"\n\nHer eyes were deep and dark. I shook myself and pulled the notes I'd\nmade on her policies from my pocket. In the most official voice I could\nmanage, I said, \"You see, there may be some leeway in interpreting the\nfacts. As it stands, frankly, there isn't much hope. But if you'll give\nme some information--\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"All right. Now, your father--Benedetto dell'Angela. He was a casualty\nof the war with Sicily; he got a dose of radiation, and he is at\npresent in a low-metabolism state in the clinic at Anzio, waiting for\nthe radiogens to clear out of his system. Is that correct?\"\n\n\"It is what the Company's report said,\" she answered.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHer tone was odd. Surely she wasn't doubting a Company report!\n\n\"As his dependent, Rena, you applied for subsistence benefits on his\nBlue Blanket policies, as well as war-risk benefits under the Blue\nBolt. Both applications were refused; the Blue Blanket because your\nfather is technically not hospitalized; the Blue Bolt, as well as all\nyour other personal policies, was cancelled, because of--\" I stuttered\nover it--\"of activities against the best interest of the Company.\nSpecifically, giving aid and comfort to a known troublemaker whose name\nis given here as Slovetski.\" I showed her the cancellation sheet I had\nstolen from the files.\n\nShe shrugged. \"This much I know, Tom,\" she said.\n\n\"Why?\" I demanded. \"This man is believed to have been instrumental in\ninciting the war with Sicily!\"\n\nShe flared, \"Tom, that's a lie! Slovetski is an old friend of my\nfather's--they studied together in Berlin, many years ago. He is\nutterly, completely against war--any war!\"\n\nI hesitated. \"Well, let's put that aside. But you realize that, in\nview of this, the Company can maintain--quite properly in a technical\nsense--that you contributed to the war, and therefore you can't collect\nBlue Bolt compensation for a war you helped bring about. You were\nwarned, you see. You can't even say that you didn't know what you were\ndoing.\"\n\n\"Tom,\" Rena's voice was infinitely patient and sad. \"I knew what I was\ndoing.\"\n\n\"In that case, Rena, you have to admit that it seems fair enough.\nStill, perhaps we can get something for you--even if only a refund of\nyour premiums. The Company doesn't always follow the letter of the law,\nthere are always exceptions, so--\"\n\nHer expression stopped me. She was smiling, but it was the tortured\nsmile of Prometheus contemplating the cosmic jest that was ripping out\nhis vitals.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI asked uncertainly, \"Don't you believe me?\"\n\n\"Believe you, Tom? Indeed I do.\" She laughed out loud that time. \"After\nwhat happened to my father, I assure you, Tom, I am certain that the\nCompany doesn't always follow the law.\"\n\nI shook my head quickly. \"No, you don't understand. I--\"\n\n\"I understand quite well.\" She studied me for a moment, then patted my\nhand. \"Let us talk of something else.\"\n\n\"Won't you tell me why your policy was cancelled?\"\n\nShe said evenly, \"It's in the file. Because I was a bad girl.\"\n\n\"But why? Why--\"\n\n\"Because, Tom. Please, no more. I know you are trying to be just as\nhelpful as you can, but there is no help you can give.\"\n\n\"You don't make it easy, Rena.\"\n\n\"It can't be easy! You see, I admit everything. I was warned. I\nhelped an old friend whom the Company wanted to--shall we say--treat\nfor radiation sickness? So there is no question that my policy can be\ncancelled. All legal. It is not the only one of its kind, you know. So\nwhy discuss it?\"\n\n\"Why shouldn't we?\"\n\nHer expression softened. \"Because--because we do not agree. And never\nshall.\"\n\nI stared at her blankly. She was being very difficult. Really, I\nshouldn't be bothering with her, someone I barely knew, someone I\nhadn't even heard of until--\n\nThat reminded me. I said, \"Rena, how did you know my name?\"\n\nHer eyes went opaque. \"Know your name, Tom? Why, Mr. Gogarty introduced\nus.\"\n\n\"No. You knew of me before that. Come clean, Rena. Please.\"\n\nShe said flatly, \"I don't know what you mean.\" She was beginning to act\nagitated. I had seen her covertly glancing at her watch several times;\nnow she held it up openly--ostentatiously, in fact. \"I am sorry, but\nyou'd better go,\" she said with a hint of anxiety in her voice. \"Please\nexcuse me.\"\n\nWell, there seemed no good reason to stay. So I went--not happily; not\nwith any sense of accomplishment; and fully conscious of the figure I\ncut to the unseen watcher in the other room, the man whose coffee I had\nusurped.\n\nBecause there was no longer a conjecture about whether there had been\nsuch a person or not. I had heard him sneeze three times.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBack at my hotel, a red light was flashing on the phone as I let myself\nin. I unlocked the play-back with my room key and got a recorded\nmessage that Gogarty wanted me to phone him at once.\n\nHe answered the phone on the first ring, looking like the wrath of God.\nIt took me a moment to recognize the symptoms; then it struck home.\n\nThe lined gray face, the jittery twitching of the head, the slow,\ntortured movements; here was a man with a classic textbook case of his\nailment. The evidence was medically conclusive. He had been building up\nto a fancy drinking party, and something made him stop in the middle.\n\nThere were few tortures worse than a grade-A hangover, but one of those\nthat qualified was the feeling of having the drink die slowly, going\nthrough the process of sobering up without the anesthetic of sleep.\n\nHe winced as the scanning lights from the phone hit him. \"Wills,\" he\nsaid sourly. \"About time. Listen, you've got to go up to Anzio. We've\ngot a distinguished visitor, and he wants to talk to you.\"\n\n\"Me?\"\n\n\"You! He knows you--his name is Defoe.\"\n\nThe name crashed over me; I hadn't expected that, of all things. He was\na member of the Council of Underwriters! I thought they never ventured\nfar from the Home Office. In fact, I thought they never had a moment to\nspare from the awesome duties of running the Company.\n\nGogarty explained. \"He appeared out of nowhere at Carmody Field. I was\nstill in Caserta! Just settling down to a couple of drinks with Susan,\nand they phoned me to say Chief Underwriter Defoe is on my doorstep!\"\n\nI cut in, \"What does he want?\"\n\nGogarty puffed his plump cheeks. \"How do I know? He doesn't like the\nway things are going, I guess. Well, I don't like them either! But I've\nbeen twenty-six years with the Company, and if he thinks.... Snooping\nand prying. There are going to be some changes in the office, I can\ntell you. Somebody's been passing on all kinds of lying gossip and--\"\nHe broke off and stared at me calculatingly as an idea hit him.\n\nThen he shook his head. \"No. Couldn't be you, Wills, could it? You only\ngot here, and Defoe's obviously been getting this stuff for weeks.\nMaybe months. Still--Say, how did you come to know him?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was none of his business. I said coldly, \"At the Home Office. I\nguess I'll take the morning plane up to Anzio, then.\"\n\n\"The hell you will. You'll take the night train. It gets you there an\nhour earlier.\" Gogarty jerked his head righteously--then winced and\nclutched his temple. He said miserably, \"Oh, damn. Tom, I don't like\nall of this. I think something happened to Hammond.\"\n\nI repeated, \"Happened? What could happen to him?\"\n\n\"I don't know. But I found out a few things. He's been seen with some\nmighty peculiar people in Caserta. What's this about somebody with a\ngun waiting at the office for him when you were there?\"\n\nIt took a moment for me to figure out what he was talking about. \"Oh,\"\nI said, \"you mean the man at the car? I didn't know he had a gun, for\ncertain.\"\n\n\"I do,\" Gogarty said shortly. \"The expediters tried to pick him up\ntoday, to question him about Hammond. He shot his way out.\"\n\nI told Gogarty what I knew, although it wasn't much. He listened\nabstractedly and, when I had finished, he sighed. \"Well, that's no\nhelp,\" he grumbled. \"Better get ready to catch your train.\"\n\nI nodded and reached to cut off the connection. He waved\nhalf-heartedly. \"Oh, yes,\" he added, \"give my regards to Susan if you\nsee her.\"\n\n\"Isn't she here?\"\n\nHe grimaced. \"Your friend Defoe said he needed a secretary. He\nrequisitioned her.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI boarded the Anzio train from the same platform where I had seen\nZorchi dive under the wheels. But this was no sleek express; it was an\nancient three-car string that could not have been less than fifty years\nout of date. The cars were not even air-conditioned.\n\nSleep was next to impossible, so I struck up a conversation with an\nexpediter-officer. He was stand-offish at first but, when he found out\nI was a Claims Adjuster, he mellowed and produced some interesting\ninformation.\n\nIt was reasonable that Defoe would put aside his other duties and make\na quick visit to Anzio, because Anzio seemed to need someone to do\nsomething about it pretty badly. My officer was part of a new levy\nbeing sent up there; the garrison was being doubled; there had been\ntrouble. He was vague about what kind of \"trouble\" it had been, but\nit sounded like mob violence. I mentioned Caserta and the near-riot I\nhad been in; the officer's eyes hooded over, and about five minutes\nafter that he pointedly leaned back and pulled his hat over his eyes.\nEvidently it was not good form to discuss actual riots.\n\nI accepted the rebuke, but I was puzzled in my mind as I tried to get\nsome sleep for myself.\n\nWhat kind of a place was this Naples, where mobs rioted against the\nCompany and even intelligent-seeming persons like Renata dell'Angela\nappeared to have some reservations about it?\n\n\nV\n\nI slept, more or less, for an hour or so in that cramped coach seat.\nI was half asleep when the train-expediter nudged my elbow and said,\n\"Anzio.\"\n\nIt was early--barely past daybreak. It was much too early to find a\ncab. I got directions from a drowsing stationmaster and walked toward\nthe vaults.\n\nThe \"clinic,\" as the official term went, was buried in the feet of the\nhills just beyond the beaches. I was astonished at the size of it. Not\nbecause it was so large; on the contrary. It was, as far as I could\nsee, only a broad, low shed.\n\nThen it occurred to me that the vaults were necessarily almost entirely\nunderground, for the sake of economy in keeping them down to the\noptimum suspendee temperature. It was safe enough and simple enough\nto put a man in suspended animation but, as I understood it, it was\nnecessary to be sure that the suspendees never got much above fifty\ndegrees temperature for any length of time. Above that, they had an\nunwelcome tendency to decay.\n\nThis was, I realized, the first full-scale \"clinic\" I had ever seen.\nI had known that the Company had hundreds, perhaps thousands, of them\nscattered all over the world.\n\nI had heard that the Company had enough of them, mostly in\nout-of-the-way locations, to deep-freeze the entire human race at once,\nthough that seemed hardly reasonable.\n\nI had even heard some ugly, never-quite-made-clear stories about _why_\nthe Company had so many clinics ... but when people began hinting\nat such ridiculous unpleasantness, I felt it was my duty to make it\nclear that I wanted to hear no subversive talk. So I had never got the\ndetails--and certainly would never have believed them for a moment if I\nhad.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was very early in the morning, as I say, but it seemed that I was\nnot the first to arrive at the clinic. On the sparse grass before the\nmain entrance, half a dozen knots of men and women were standing around\napathetically. Some of them glared at me as I came near them, for\nreasons I did not understand; others merely stared.\n\nI heard a hoarse whisper as I passed one group of middle-aged women.\nOne of them was saying, \"Benedetto non \u00e9 morte.\" She seemed to be\ndirecting it to me; but it meant nothing. The only comment that came to\nmy somewhat weary mind was, \"So what if Benedetto isn't dead?\"\n\nA huge armed expediter, yawning and scratching, let me in to the\nexecutive office. I explained that I had been sent for by Mr. Defoe.\nI had to wait until Mr. Defoe was ready to receive me and was finally\nconducted to a suite of rooms.\n\nThis might have once been an authentic clinic; it had the aseptic\nappearance of a depressing hospital room. One for, say, Class-Cs with\nterminal myasthenia. Now, though, it had been refitted as a private\nguest suite, with an attempt at luxurious drapes and deep stuffed\narmchairs superimposed on the basic adjustable beds and stainless steel\nplumbing.\n\nI hadn't seen Defoe in some time, but he hadn't changed at all.\nHe was, as always, the perfect model of a Company executive of\ngeneral-officer rank. He was formal, but not unyielding. He was tall,\ndistinguished-gray at the temples, spare, immaculately outfitted in the\ntraditional vest and bow tie.\n\nI recalled our first meeting. He was from the side of Marianna's family\nthat she talked about, and she fluttered around for three whole days,\nchecking our Blue Plate policies for every last exotic dish we could\nsqueeze out to offer him, planning the television programs allowed\nunder our entertainment policies, selecting the most respectable of\nour friends--\"acquaintances\" would be a better description; Marianna\ndidn't make friends easily--to make up a dinner party. He'd arrived\nat the stroke of the hour he was due, and had brought with him what\nwas undoubtedly his idea of a princely gift for newly-weds--a paid-up\nextra-coverage maternity benefit rider on our Blue Blanket policies.\n\nWe thanked him effusively. And, for my part, sincerely. That was before\nI had known Marianna's views on children; she had no intentions of\nraising a family.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs I walked in on Defoe in his private suite at the clinic, he was\nstanding with his back to me, at a small washstand, peering at his\nreflection in a mirror. He appeared to have finished shaving. I rubbed\nmy own bristled chin uneasily.\n\nHe said over his shoulder, \"Good morning, Thomas. Sit down.\"\n\nI sat on the edge of an enormous wing chair. He pursed his lips,\nstretched the skin under his chin and, when he seemed perfectly\nsatisfied the job was complete, he said as though he were continuing a\nconversation, \"Fill me in on your interview with Zorchi, Thomas.\"\n\nIt was the first I'd known he'd ever _heard_ of Zorchi. I hesitantly\nbegan to tell him about the meeting in the hospital. It did not, I\nknew, do me very much credit, but it simply didn't occur to me to try\nto make my own part look better. I suppose that if I thought of the\nmatter at all, I simply thought that Defoe would instantly detect any\nattempt to gloss things over. He hardly seemed to be paying attention\nto me, though; he was preoccupied with the remainder of his morning\nritual--carefully massaging his face with something fragrant, brushing\nhis teeth with a maddening, old-fashioned insistence on careful\nstrokes, combing his hair almost strand by strand.\n\nThen he took a small bottle with a daub attached to the stopper and\ntouched it to the distinguished gray at his temples.\n\nI spluttered in the middle of a word; I had never thought of the\npossibility that the handsomely grayed temples of the Company's senior\nexecutives, as inevitable as the vest or the watch chain, were equally\na part of the uniform! Defoe gave me a long inquiring look in the\nmirror; I coughed and went on with a careful description of Zorchi's\ntemper tantrum.\n\nDefoe turned to me and nodded gravely. There was neither approval nor\ndisapproval. He had asked for information and the information had been\nreceived.\n\nHe pressed a communicator button and ordered breakfast. The microphone\nmust have been there, but it was invisible. He sat down at a small,\nsurgical-looking table, leaned back and folded his hands.\n\n\"Now,\" he said, \"tell me what happened in Caserta just before Hammond\ndisappeared.\"\n\nTalking to Defoe had something of the quality of shouting down a well.\nI collected my thoughts and told him all I knew on the riot at the\nbranch office.\n\nWhile I was talking, Defoe's breakfast arrived. He didn't know I hadn't\neaten anything, of course--I say \"of course\" because I know he couldn't\nhave known, he didn't ask. I looked at it longingly, but all my looking\ndidn't alter the fact that there was only one plate, one cup, one set\nof silverware.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe ate his breakfast as methodically as he'd brushed his teeth. I doubt\nif it took him five minutes. Since I finished the Caserta story in\nabout three, the last couple of minutes were in dead silence, Defoe\neating, me sitting mute as a disconnected jukebox.\n\nThen he pushed the little table away, lit a cigarette and said, \"You\nmay smoke if you wish, Thomas. Come in, Susan.\"\n\nHe didn't raise his voice; and when, fifteen seconds later, Susan\nManchester walked in, he didn't look at all impressed with the\nefficiency of his secretary, his intercom system, or himself. The\nconcealed microphone, it occurred to me, had heard him order breakfast\nand request his secretary to walk in. It had undoubtedly heard--and\nmost probably recorded--every word I had said.\n\nHow well they did things on the upper echelon of the Company!\n\nSusan looked--different. She was as blonde and pretty as ever. But she\nwasn't bubbly. She smiled at me in passing and handed Defoe a typed\nscript, which he scanned carefully.\n\nHe asked, \"Nothing new on Hammond?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" she said.\n\n\"All right. You may leave this.\" She nodded and left. Defoe turned back\nto me. \"I have some news for you, Thomas. Hammond has been located.\"\n\n\"That's good,\" I said. \"Not too badly hung over, I hope.\"\n\nHe gave me an arctic smile. \"Hardly. He was found by a couple of\npeasants who were picking grapes. He's dead.\"\n\n\nV\n\nHammond dead! He had had his faults, but he was an officer of the\nCompany and a man I had met. Dead!\n\nI asked, \"How? What happened?\"\n\n\"Perhaps you can tell me that, Thomas,\" said Defoe.\n\nI sat startledly erect, shocked by the significance of the words. I\nsaid hotly, \"Damn it, Mr. Defoe, you know I had nothing to do with\nthis! I've been all over the whole thing with you and I thought you\nwere on my side! Just because I said a lot of crazy things after\nMarianna died doesn't mean I'm anti-Company--and it certainly doesn't\nmean I'd commit murder. If you think that, then why the devil did you\nput me in cadet school?\"\n\nDefoe merely raised his hand by bending the wrist slightly; it was\nenough to stop me, though. \"Gently, Thomas. I don't think you did\nit--that much should be obvious. And I put you in cadet school because\nI had work for you.\"\n\n\"But you said I knew something I was holding back.\"\n\nDefoe waggled the hand reprovingly. \"I said you might be able to tell\nme who killed Hammond. And so you might--but not yet. I count heavily\non you for help in this area, Thomas. There are two urgent tasks to be\ndone. Hammond's death--\" he paused and shrugged, and the shrug was all\nof Hammond's epitaph--\"is only an incident in a larger pattern; we need\nto work out the pattern itself.\"\n\nHe glanced again at the typed list Susan had handed him. \"I find that I\ncan stay in the Naples area for only a short time; the two tasks must\nbe done before I leave. I shall handle one myself. The other I intend\nto delegate to you.\n\n\"First we have the unfortunate situation in regard to the state of\npublic morale. Unfortunate? Perhaps I should say disgraceful. There is\nquite obviously a nucleus of troublemakers at work, Thomas, and Gogarty\nhas not had the wit to find them and take the appropriate steps.\nSomeone else must. Second, this Zorchi is an unnecessary annoyance. I\ndo not propose to let the Company be annoyed, Thomas. Which assignment\nwould you prefer?\"\n\nI said hesitantly, \"I don't know if Mr. Gogarty would like me to--\"\n\n\"Gogarty is an ass! If he had not blundered incessantly since he took\nover the district, I should not have had to drop important work to come\nhere.\"\n\nI thought for a second. Digging out an undercover ring of troublemakers\ndidn't sound particularly easy. On the other hand, I had already tried\nmy luck with Zorchi.\n\n\"Perhaps you'd better try Zorchi,\" I said.\n\n\"Try?\" Defoe allowed himself to look surprised. \"As you wish. I think\nyou will learn something from watching me handle it, Thomas. Shall we\njoin Signore Zorchi now?\"\n\n\"He's _here_?\"\n\nDefoe said impatiently, \"Of course, Thomas. Come along.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nZorchi's secretary was there, too. He was in a small anteroom, sitting\non a hard wooden chair; as we passed him, I saw the hostility in his\neyes. He didn't say a word.\n\nBeyond him, in an examination room, was Zorchi, slim, naked and\nhideous, sitting on the edge of a surgical cot and trying not to look\nill at ease. He had been shaved from head to knee stumps. Esthetically,\nat least, it had been a mistake. I never saw such a collection of skin\neruptions on a human.\n\nHe burst out, faster than my language-school Italian could follow, in\na stream of argument and abuse. Defoe listened icily for a moment,\nthen shut him up in Italian as good as his own. \"Answer questions;\notherwise keep quiet. I will not warn you again.\"\n\nI don't know if even Defoe could have stopped Zorchi under normal\nconditions. But there is something about being naked in the presence of\nfully dressed opponents that saps the will; and I guessed, too, that\nthe shaving had made Zorchi feel nakeder than ever before in his life.\nI could see why he'd worn a beard and I wished he still had it.\n\n\"Dr. Lawton,\" said Defoe, \"have you completed your examination of the\ninsured?\"\n\nA youngish medical officer of the Company said, \"Yes, sir. I have the\nslides and reports right here; they just came up from the laboratory.\"\nHe handed a stapled collection of photographic prints and papers to\nDefoe, who took his own good time to examine them while the rest of us\nstood and waited.\n\nDefoe finally put the papers down and nodded. \"In a word, this bears\nout our previous discussion.\"\n\nLawton nodded. \"If you will observe his legs, you will see that the\nskin healing is complete; already a blastema has formed and--\"\n\n\"I know,\" Defoe said impatiently. \"Signore Zorchi, I regret to say that\nI have bad news for you.\"\n\nZorchi waved his hand defiantly. \"_You_ are the bad news.\"\n\nDefoe ignored him. \"You have a grave systemic imbalance. There is great\ndanger of serious ill effects.\"\n\n\"To what?\" snarled Zorchi. \"The Company's bank account?\"\n\n\"No, Zorchi. To your life.\" Defoe shook his head. \"There are\nindications of malignancy.\"\n\n\"Malignancy?\" Zorchi looked startled. \"What kind? Do you mean cancer?\"\n\n\"Exactly.\" Defoe patted his papers. \"You see, Zorchi, healthy human\nflesh does not grow like a salamander's tail.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe phone rang; impeccable in everything, Defoe waited while Dr. Lawton\nnervously answered it. Lawton said a few short words, listened for a\nmoment and hung up, looking worried.\n\nHe said: \"The crowd outside is getting rather large. That was the\nexpediter-captain from the main gate. He says--\"\n\n\"I presume he has standing orders,\" Defoe said. \"We need not concern\nourselves with that, need we?\"\n\n\"Well--\" The doctor looked unhappy.\n\n\"Now, Zorchi,\" Defoe went on, dismissing Lawton utterly, \"do you enjoy\nlife?\"\n\n\"I despise it!\" Zorchi spat to emphasize how much.\n\n\"But you cling to it. You would not like to die, would you? Worse\nstill, you would not care to live indefinitely with carcinoma eating\nyou piece by piece.\"\n\nZorchi just glowered suspiciously.\n\n\"Perhaps we can cure you, however,\" Defoe went on reflectively. \"It is\nby no means certain. I don't want to raise false hopes. But there is\nthe possibility--\"\n\n\"The possibility that you will cure me of collecting on my policies,\neh?\" Zorchi demanded belligerently. \"You are crazy, Defoe. Never!\"\n\nDefoe looked at him for a thoughtful moment. To Lawton, he said: \"Have\nyou this man's claim warranty? It has the usual application for medical\ntreatment, I presume?\" He nodded as Lawton confirmed it. \"You see,\nMr. Zorchi? As a matter of routine, no claim can be paid unless the\npolicyholder submits to our medical care. You signed the usual form,\nso--\"\n\n\"One moment! You people never put me through this before! Did you\nchange the contract on me?\"\n\n\"No, Signore Zorchi. The same contract, but this time we will enforce\nit. I think I should warn you of something, though.\"\n\nHe riffled through the papers and found a photographic print to show\nZorchi. \"This picture isn't you, Signore. It is a picture of a newt.\nThe doctor will explain it to you.\"\n\nThe print was an eight-by-ten glossy of a little lizard with something\nodd about its legs. Puzzled, Zorchi held it as though the lizard were\nalive and venomous. But as the doctor spoke, the puzzlement turned into\nhorror and fury.\n\n\"What Mr. Defoe means,\" said Lawton, \"is that totipotency--that is,\nthe ability to regenerate lost tissues, as you can, even when entire\nmembers are involved--is full of unanswered riddles. We have found,\nfor instance, that X-ray treatment on your leg helps a new leg to form\nrapidly, just as it does on the leg of the salamanders. The radiation\nappears to stimulate the formation of the blastema, which--well, never\nmind the technical part. It speeds things up.\"\n\nHis eyes gleamed with scientific interest. \"But we tried the experiment\nof irradiating limbs that had not been severed. It worked the same way,\noddly enough. New limbs were generated _even though the old ones were\nstill there_. That's why the salamander in the photo has four hands on\none of its limbs--nine legs altogether, counting that half-formed one\njust beside the tail. Curious-looking little beast, isn't it?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDefoe cleared his throat. \"I only mention, Signore, that the standard\ntreatment for malignancy is X-radiation.\"\n\nZorchi's eyes flamed--rage battling it out with terror. He said\nshrilly, \"But you can't make a laboratory animal out of me! I'm a\npolicyholder!\"\n\n\"Nature did it, Signore Zorchi, not us,\" Defoe said.\n\nZorchi's eyes rolled up in his head and closed; for a moment, I\nthought he had fainted and leaped forward to catch him rather than let\nhis legless body crash to the floor. But he hadn't fainted. He was\nmuttering, half aloud, sick with fear, \"For the love of Mary, Defoe!\nPlease, please, I beg you! Please!\"\n\nIt was too much for me. I said, shaking with rage, \"Mr. Defoe, you\ncan't force this man to undergo experimental radiation that might make\na monster out of him! I insist that you reconsider!\"\n\nDefoe threw his head back. \"_What, Thomas?_\" he snapped.\n\nI said firmly, \"He has no one here to advise him--I'll take the job.\nZorchi, listen to me! You've signed the treatment application and he's\nright enough about that--you can't get out of it. _But you don't have\nto take this treatment!_ Every policyholder has the right to refuse\nany new and unguaranteed course of treatment, no matter what the\ncircumstances. All you've got to do is agree to go into suspension in\nthe va--in the clinic here, pending such time as your condition can be\ninfallibly cured. Do it, man! Don't let them make you a freak--demand\nsuspension! What have you got to lose?\"\n\nI never saw a man go so to pieces as Zorchi, when he realized how\nnearly Defoe had trapped him into becoming a guinea pig. Whimpering\nthanks to me, he hastily signed the optional agreement for suspended\nanimation and, as quickly as I could, I left him there.\n\nDefoe followed me. We passed the secretary in the anteroom while Dr.\nLawton was explaining the circumstances to him; the man was stricken\nwith astonishment, almost too paralyzed to sign the witnessing form\nDefoe had insisted on. I knew the form well--I had been about to sign\none for Marianna when, at the last moment, she decided against the\nvaults in favor of the experimental therapy that hadn't worked.\n\nOutside in the hall, Defoe stopped and confronted me. I braced myself\nfor the blast to end all blasts.\n\nI could hardly believe my eyes. The great stone face was smiling!\n\n\"Thomas,\" he said inexplicably, \"that was masterful. I couldn't have\ndone better myself.\"\n\n\nVI\n\nWe walked silently through the huge central waiting room of the clinic.\n\nThere should have been scores of relatives of suspendees milling\naround, seeking information--there was, I knew, still a steady shipment\nof suspendees coming in from the local hospitals; I had seen it myself.\nBut there were hardly more than a dozen or so persons in sight, with a\nsingle clerk checking their forms and answering their questions.\n\nIt was too quiet. Defoe thought so, too; I saw his frown.\n\nNow that I had had a few moments to catch my breath, I realized that I\nhad seen a master judoist at work. It was all out of the textbooks--as\na fledgling Claims Adjuster, I had had the basic courses in handling\ndifficult cases--but not one man in a million could apply textbook\nrules as skillfully and successfully as Defoe did with Zorchi.\n\nPush a man hard and he will lunge back; push him hard enough and\npersistently enough, and he will lunge back farther than his vision\ncarries him, right to the position you planned for him in the first\nplace. And I, of course, had been only a tool in Defoe's hand; by\ninterceding for Zorchi, I had tricked the man into the surrender Defoe\nwanted.\n\nAnd he had complimented me for it!\n\nI couldn't help wondering, though, whether the compliment Defoe gave me\nwas part of some still subtler scheme....\n\nDefoe nodded curtly to the expediter-captain at the door, who saluted\nand pressed the teleswitch that summoned Defoe's limousine.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDefoe turned to me. \"I have business in Rome and must leave at once.\nYou will have to certify Zorchi's suspension this afternoon; since I\nwon't be here, you'll have to come back to the clinic for it. After\nthat, Thomas, you can begin your assignment.\"\n\nI said uncertainly, \"What--where shall I begin?\"\n\nOne eyebrow lifted a trifle. \"Where? Wherever you think proper, Thomas.\nOr must I handle this myself?\"\n\nThe proper answer, and the one I longed to make, was \"Yes.\" Instead I\nsaid, \"Not at all, Mr. Defoe. It's only that I didn't even know there\nwas an undercover group until you told me about it a few moments ago; I\ndon't know exactly where to start. Gogarty never mentioned--\"\n\n\"Gogarty,\" he cut in, \"is very likely to be relieved as District\nAdministrator before long. I should like to replace him with\nsomeone already on the scene--\" he glanced at me to be sure I\nunderstood--\"provided, that is, that I can find someone of proven\ncompetence. Someone who has the ability to handle this situation\nwithout the necessity of my personal intervention.\"\n\nThe limousine arrived then, with an armed expediter riding beside the\nchauffeur. Defoe allowed me to open the door for him and follow him in.\n\n\"Do you understand me?\" he asked as the driver started off.\n\n\"I think so,\" I said.\n\n\"Good. I do not suppose that Gogarty has given you any information\nabout the malcontents in this area.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"It may be for the best; his information is clearly not good.\" Defoe\nstared broodingly out the window at the silent groups of men and women\non the grass before the clinic. \"Your information is there,\" he said\nas they passed out of sight. \"Learn what you can. Act when you know\nenough. And, Thomas--\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Have you given thought to your future?\"\n\nI shifted uncomfortably. \"Well, I've only been a Claims Adjuster a\nlittle while, you know. I suppose that perhaps I might eventually get\npromoted, even become a District Administrator--\"\n\nHe looked at me impersonally. \"Dream higher,\" he advised.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI stood watching after Defoe's limousine, from the marquee of the hotel\nwhere he had left me to take a room and freshen up. _Dream higher._ He\nhad the gift of intoxication.\n\nHigher than a District Administrator! It could mean only--the Home\nOffice.\n\nWell, it was not impossible, after all. The Home Office jobs had to\ngo to someone; the super-men who held them now--the Defoes and the\nCarmodys and the dozen or more others who headed up departments or\nfilled seats on the Council of Underwriters--couldn't live forever. And\nthe jobs had to be filled by someone.\n\nWhy not me? Only one reason, really. I was not a career man. I hadn't\nhad the early academy training from adolescence on; I had come to the\nservice of the Company itself relatively late in life. The calendar\nlegislated against me.\n\nOf course, I thought to myself, I was in a pretty good position, in a\nway, because of Defoe's evident interest in me. With him helping and\ncounseling me, it might be easier.\n\nI thought that and then I stopped myself, shocked. I was thinking in\nterms of personal preferment. That was not the Company way! If I had\nlearned anything in my training, I had learned that Advancement was on\nmerit alone.\n\nAdvancement _had_ to be on merit alone ... else the Company became an\noligarchy, deadly and self-perpetuating.\n\nShaken, I sat in the dingy little hotel room that was the best the town\nof Anzio had for me and opened my little Black Book. I thumbed through\nthe fine-printed pages of actuarial tables and turned to the words of\nMillen Carmody, Chief Underwriter, in the preface. They were the words\nthat had been read to me and the others at our graduation at the Home\nOffice, according to the tradition:\n\n    _Remember always that the Company serves humanity, not the reverse.\n    The Company's work is the world's work. The Company can end,\n    forever, the menace of war and devastation; but it must not\n    substitute a tyranny of its own. Corruption breeds tyrants.\n    Corruption has no place in the Company._\n\nThey were glorious words. I read them over again, and stared at the\nportrait of Underwriter Carmody that was the frontispiece of the\nhandbook. It was a face to inspire trust--wise and human, grave, but\nwith warmth in the wide-spaced eyes.\n\nMillen Carmody was not a man you could doubt. As long as men like\nhim ran the Company--and he was the boss of them all, _the_ Chief\nUnderwriter, the highest position the Company had to offer--there could\nbe no question of favoritism or corruption.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter eating, I shaved, cleaned up a little and went back to the clinic.\n\nThere was trouble in the air, no question of it. More expediters were\nin view, scattered around the entrance, a dozen, cautious yards away\nfrom the nearest knots of civilians. Cars with no official company\nmarkings, but with armor-glass so thick that it seemed yellow, were\nparked at the corners. And people were everywhere.\n\nPeople who were quiet. Too quiet. There were some women--but not enough\nto make the proportion right. And there were no children.\n\nI could almost feel the thrust of their eyes as I entered the clinic.\n\nInside, the aura of strain was even denser. If anything, the place\nlooked more normal than it had earlier; there were more people.\nThe huge waiting room was packed and a dozen sweating clerks were\ninterviewing long lines of persons. But here, as outside, the feeling\nwas wrong; the crowds weren't noisy enough; they lacked the nervous\nboisterousness they should have had.\n\nDr. Lawton looked worried. He greeted me and showed me to a small room\nnear the elevators. There was a cocoon of milky plastic on a wheeled\ntable; I looked closer, and inside the cocoon, recognizable through the\nclear plastic over the face, was the waxlike body of Luigi Zorchi. The\neyes were closed and he was completely still. I would have thought him\ndead if I had not known he was under the influence of the drugs used in\nthe suspension of life in the vaults.\n\nI said: \"Am I supposed to identify him or something?\"\n\n\"We know who he is,\" Lawton snorted. \"Sign the commitment, that's all.\"\n\nI signed the form he handed me, attesting that Luigi Zorchi,\nserial number such-and-such, had requested and was being granted\nimmobilization and suspension in lieu of cash medical benefits. They\nrolled the stretcher-cart away, with its thick foam-plastic sack\ncontaining the inanimate Zorchi.\n\n\"Anything else?\" I asked.\n\nLawton shook his head moodily. \"Nothing you can help with. I told Defoe\nthis was going to happen!\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nHe glared at me. \"Man, didn't you just come in through the main\nentrance? Didn't you see that mob?\"\n\n\"Well, I wouldn't call it a mob,\" I began.\n\n\"You wouldn't _now_,\" he broke in. \"But you will soon enough. They're\nworking themselves up. Or maybe they're waiting for something. But it\nmeans trouble, I promise, and I warned Defoe about it. And he just\nstared at me as if I was some kind of degenerate.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI said sharply, \"What are you afraid of? Right outside, you've got\nenough expediters to fight a war.\"\n\n\"Afraid? Me?\" He looked insulted. \"Do you think I'm worried about my\nown skin, Wills? No, sir. But do you realize that we have suspendees\nhere who need protection? Eighty thousand of them. A mob like that--\"\n\n\"Eighty _thousand_?\" I stared at him. The war had lasted only a few\nweeks!\n\n\"Eighty thousand. A little more, if anything. And every one of them\nis a ward of the Company as long as he's suspended. Just think of the\ndamage suits, Wills.\"\n\nI said, still marveling at the enormous number of casualties out of\nthat little war, \"Surely the suspendees are safe here, aren't they?\"\n\n\"Not against mobs. The vaults can handle anything that might happen\nin the way of disaster. I don't think an H-bomb right smack on top of\nthem would disturb more than the top two or three decks at most. But\nyou never know what mobs will do. If they once get in here--And Defoe\nwouldn't listen to me!\"\n\nAs I went back into the hall, passing the main entrance, the explosion\nburst.\n\nI stared out over the heads of the dreadfully silent throng in the\nentrance hall, looking toward the glass doors, as was everyone else\ninside. Beyond the doors, an arc of expediters was retreating toward\nus; they paused, fired a round of gas-shells over the heads of the mob\noutside, and retreated again.\n\nThen the mob was on them, in a burst of screaming fury. Hidden gas guns\nappeared, and clubs, and curious things that looked like slingshots.\nThe crowd broke for the entrance. The line of expediters wavered but\nheld. There was a tangle of hand-to-hand fights, each one a vicious\nstruggle. But the expediters were professionals; outnumbered forty to\none, they savagely chopped down their attackers with their hands, their\nfeet and the stocks of their guns. The crowd hesitated. No shot had yet\nbeen fired, except toward the sky.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe air whined and shook. From low on the horizon, a needle-nosed jet\nthundered in. A plane! Aircraft never flew in the restricted area over\nthe Company's major installations. Aircraft didn't barrel in at treetop\nheight, fast and low, without a hint of the recognition numbers every\naircraft had to carry.\n\nFrom its belly sluiced a silvery milt of explosives as it came in over\nthe heads of the mob, peeled off and up and away, then circled out\ntoward the sea for another approach. A hail of tiny blasts rattled in\nthe clear space between the line of expediters and the entrance. The\nbig doors shook and cracked.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe expediters stared white-faced at the ship. And the crowd began\nfiring. An illegal hard-pellet gun peppered the glass of the doors with\npock-marks. The guarding line of expediters was simply overrun.\n\nInside the waiting room, where I stood frozen, hell broke out. The\ndetachment of expediters, supervising the hundreds inside leaped for\nthe doors to fight back the surging mob. But the mob inside the doors,\nthe long orderly lines before the interviewing clerks, now split into\na hundred screaming, milling centers of panic. Some rushed toward the\ndoors; some broke for the halls of the vaults themselves. I couldn't\nsee what was going on outside any more. I was swamped in a rush of\nwomen panicked out of their senses.\n\nPanic was like a plague. I saw doctors and orderlies struggling\nagainst the tide, a few scattered expediters battling to turn back the\nterrified rush. But I was swept along ahead of them all, barely able to\nkeep my feet. An expediter fell a yard from me. I caught up his gun and\nbegan striking out. For this was what Lawton had feared--the mob loose\nin the vaults!\n\nI raced down a side corridor, around a corner, to the banked elevators\nthat led to the deeps of the clinic. There was fighting there, but\nthe elevator doors were closed. Someone had had the wit to lock them\nagainst the mob. But there were stairs; I saw an emergency door only\na few yards away. I hesitated only long enough to convince myself,\nthrough the fear, that my duty was to the Company and to the protection\nof its helpless wards below. I bolted through the door and slammed\nit behind me, spun the levers over and locked it. In a moment, I was\nrunning down a long ramp toward the cool immensities of the vaults.\n\nIf Lawton had not mentioned the possible consequences of violence\nto the suspendees, I suppose I would have worried only about my own\nskin. But here I was. I stared around, trying to get my bearings. I\nwas in a sort of plexus of hallways, an open area with doors on all\nsides leading off to the vaults. I was alone; the noise from above and\noutside was cut off completely.\n\nNo, I was not alone! I heard running footsteps, light and quick, from\nanother ramp. I turned in time to see a figure speed down it, pause\nonly a second at its base, and disappear into one of the vaults. It\nwas a woman, but not a woman in nurse's uniform. Her back had been to\nme, yet I could see that one hand held a gas gun, the other something\nglittering and small.\n\nI followed, not quite believing what I had seen. For I had caught only\na glimpse of her face, far off and from a bad angle--but I was as sure\nas ever I could be that it was Rena dell'Angela!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe didn't look back. She was hurrying against time, hurrying toward a\ndestination that obsessed her thoughts. I followed quietly enough, but\nI think I might have thundered like an elephant herd and still been\nunheard.\n\nWe passed a strange double-walled door with a warning of some sort\nlettered on it in red; then she swung into a side corridor where the\npassage was just wide enough for one. On either side were empty tiers\nof shelves waiting for suspendees. I speeded up to reach the corner\nbefore she could disappear.\n\nBut she wasn't hurrying now. She had come to a bay of shelves where a\nhundred or so bodies lay wrapped in their plastic sacks, each to his\nown shelf. Dropping to her knees, she began checking the tags on the\ncocoons at the lowest level.\n\nShe whispered something sharp and imploring. Then, straightening\nabruptly, she dropped the gas gun and took up the glittering thing\nin her other hand. Now I could see that it was a hypodermic kit in a\ncrystal case. From it she took a little flask of purplish liquid and,\nfingers shaking, shoved the needle of the hypodermic into the plastic\nstopper of the vial.\n\nMoving closer, I said: \"It won't work, Rena.\"\n\nShe jumped and swung to face me, holding the hypodermic like a\nstiletto. Seeing my face, she gasped and wavered.\n\nI stepped by her and looked down at the tag on the cocooned figure.\n_Benedetto dell'Angela, Napoli_, it said, and then the long string of\nserial numbers that identified him.\n\nIt was what I had guessed.\n\n\"It won't work,\" I repeated. \"Be smart about this, Rena. You can't\nrevive him without killing him.\"\n\nRena half-closed her eyes. She whispered, \"Would death be worse than\nthis?\"\n\nI hadn't expected this sort of superstitious nonsense from her. I\nstarted to answer, but she had me off guard. In a flash, she raked the\nglittering needle toward my face and, as I stumbled back involuntarily,\nher other hand lunged for the gas gun I had thrust into my belt.\n\nOnly luck saved me. Not being in a holster, the gun's front sight\ncaught and I had the moment I needed to cuff her away. She gasped and\nspun up against the tiers of shelves. The filled hypodermic shattered\nagainst the floor, spilling the contents into a purple, gleaming pool\nof fluorescence.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRena took a deep breath and stood erect. There were tears in her eyes\nagain.\n\nShe said in a detached voice: \"Well done, Mr. Wills.\"\n\n\"Are you crazy?\" I crackled. \"This is your father. Do you want to kill\nhim? It takes a doctor to revive him. You're an educated woman, Rena,\nnot a witch-ridden peasant! You know better than this!\"\n\nShe laughed--a cold laugh. \"Educated! A peasant woman would have kicked\nyou to death and succeeded. I'm educated, all right! Two hundred men, a\nplane, twenty women risking themselves up there to get me through the\ndoor. All our plans--and I can't remember a way to kill you in time.\nI'm too educated to hate you, Claims Adjuster Wills!\" She choked on the\nwords. Then she shook her head dully. \"Go ahead, turn me in and get it\nover with.\"\n\nI took a deep breath. Turn her in? I hadn't thought that far ahead.\nTrue, that was the obvious thing to do; she had confessed that the\nwhole riot outside was a diversion to get her down in the vaults, and\nanyone who could summon up that sort of organized anti-Company violence\nwas someone who automatically became my natural enemy.\n\nBut perhaps I was too educated and too soft as well. There had been\ntears on her face, over her father's body. I could not remember having\nheard that conspirators cried.\n\nAnd I sympathized a little. I had known what it was like to weep\nover the body of someone I loved. Despite our difficulties, despite\neverything, I would have done anything in the world to bring Marianna\nback to life. I couldn't. Rena--she believed--could revive her father.\n\nI didn't want to turn her in.\n\nI _shouldn't_ turn her in. It was my duty _not_ to turn her in, for\nhadn't Defoe himself ordered me to investigate the dissident movement\nof which she was clearly a part? Wouldn't it be easier for me to win\nher confidence, and trick her into revealing its secrets, than to have\nher arrested?\n\nThe answer, in all truth, was _No_. She was not a trickable girl, I was\nsure. But it was, at least, a rationale, and I clung to it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI coughed and said: \"Rena, will you make a bargain?\"\n\nShe stared drearily. \"Bargain?\"\n\n\"I have a room at the Umberto. If I get you out of here, will you go to\nmy room and wait for me there?\"\n\nHer eyes narrowed sharply for a second. She parted her lips to say\nsomething, but only nodded.\n\n\"Your word, Rena? I don't want to turn you in.\"\n\nShe looked helplessly at the purple spilled pool on the floor, and\nwistfully at the sack that held her father. Then she said, \"My word on\nit. But you're a fool, Tom!\"\n\n\"I know it!\" I admitted.\n\nI hurried her back up the ramp, back toward the violence upstairs. If\nit was over, I would have to talk her out of the clinic, somehow cover\nup the fact that she had been in the vaults. If it was still going on,\nthough--\n\nIt was.\n\nWe blended ourselves with the shouting, rioting knots. I dragged her\ninto the main waiting room, saw her thrust through the doors. Things\nwere quieting even then. And I saw two women hastening toward her\nthrough the fight, and I do not think it was a coincidence that the\nsteam went out of the rioters almost at once.\n\nI stayed at the clinic until everything was peaceful again, though it\nwas hours.\n\nI wasn't fooling myself. I didn't have a shred of real reason for not\nhaving her arrested. If she had information to give, I was not the type\nto trick it out of her--even if she really was waiting at the Umberto,\nwhich was, in itself, not likely. If I had turned her in, Defoe would\nhave had the information out of her in moments; but not I.\n\nShe was an enemy of the Company.\n\nAnd I was unable to betray her.\n\n\nVII\n\nDr. Lawton, who seemed to be Chief Medical Officer for Anzio Clinic,\nsaid grimly: \"This wasn't an accident. It was planned. The question is,\nwhy?\"\n\nThe expediters had finished driving the rioters out of the clinic\nitself, and gas guns were rapidly dispersing the few left outside the\nentrance. At least thirty unconscious forms were scattered around--and\none or two that were worse than unconscious.\n\nI said, \"Maybe they were hoping to loot the clinic.\" It wasn't a very\ngood lie. But then, I hadn't had much practice in telling lies to an\nofficer of the Company.\n\nLawton pursed his lips and ignored the suggestion. \"Tell me something,\nWills. What were you doing down below?\"\n\nI said quickly, \"Below? You mean a half an hour ago?\"\n\n\"That's what I mean.\" He was gentle, but--well, not exactly suspicious.\nCurious.\n\nI improvised: \"I--I thought I saw someone running down there. One\nof the rioters. So I chased after her--after _him_,\" I corrected,\nswallowing the word just barely in time.\n\nHe nodded. \"Find anything?\"\n\nIt was a tough question. Had I been seen going in or coming out? If it\nwas coming out--Rena had been with me.\n\nI took what we called a \"calculated risk\"--that is, I got a firm grip\non my courage and told a big fat and possibly detectable lie. I said,\n\"Nobody that I could find. But I still think I heard something. The\ntrouble is, I don't know the vaults very well. I was afraid I'd get\nlost.\"\n\nApparently it was on the way in that I had been spotted, for Lawton\nsaid thoughtfully, \"Let's take a look.\"\n\nWe took a couple of battered expediters with us--I didn't regard them\nas exactly necessary, but I couldn't see how I could tell Lawton\nthat. The elevators were working again, so we came out in a slightly\ndifferent part of the vaults than I had seen before; it was not\nentirely acting on my part when I peered around.\n\nLawton accepted my statement that I wasn't quite sure where I had heard\nthe noises, without argument. He accepted it all too easily; he sent\nthe expediters scouring the corridors at random.\n\nAnd, of course, one of them found the pool of spilled fluorescence\nfrom the hypodermic needle I had knocked out of Rena's hand.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe stood there peering at the smear of purplish color, the shattered\nhypodermic, Rena's gas gun.\n\nLawton mused, \"Looks like someone's trying to wake up some of our\nsleepers. That's our standard antilytic, if I'm not mistaken.\" He\nscanned the shelves. \"Nobody missing around here. Take a look in the\nnext few sections of the tiers.\"\n\nThe expediters saluted and left.\n\n\"They won't find anyone missing,\" Lawton predicted. \"And _that_ means\nwe have to take a physical inventory of the whole damn clinic. Over\neighty thousand suspendees to check.\" He made a disgusted noise.\n\nI said, \"Maybe they were scared off before they finished.\"\n\n\"Maybe. Maybe not. We'll have to check, that's all.\"\n\n\"Are you sure that stuff is to revive the suspendees?\" I persisted.\n\"Couldn't it just have been someone wandering down here by mistake\nduring the commotion and--\"\n\n\"And carrying a hypodermic needle by mistake, and armed with a gas gun\nby mistake. Sure, Wills.\"\n\nThe expediters returned and Lawton looked at them sourly.\n\nThey shook their heads. He shrugged. \"Tell you what, Wills,\" he said.\n\"Let's go back to the office and--\"\n\nHe stopped, peering down the corridor. The last of our expediters was\ncoming toward us--not alone.\n\n\"Well, what do you know!\" said Lawton. \"Wills, it looks like he's got\nyour fugitive!\"\n\nThe expediter was dragging a small writhing figure behind him; we could\nhear whines and pleading. For a heart-stopping second, I thought it was\nRena, against all logic.\n\nBut it wasn't. It was a quavery ancient, a bleary-eyed wreck of a man,\nlong past retirement age, shabbily dressed and obviously the sort who\ncut his pension policies to the barest minimum--and then whined when\nhis old age was poverty-stricken.\n\nLawton asked me: \"This the man?\"\n\n\"I--I couldn't recognize him,\" I said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLawton turned to the weeping old man. \"Who were you after?\" he\ndemanded. All he got was sobbing pleas to let him go; all he was likely\nto get was more of the same. The man was in pure panic.\n\nWe got him up to one of the receiving offices on the upper level, half\ncarried by the expediters. Lawton questioned him mercilessly for half\nan hour before giving up. The man was by then incapable of speech.\n\nHe had said, as nearly as we could figure it out, only that he was\nsorry he had gone into the forbidden place, he didn't mean to go\ninto the forbidden place, he had been sleeping in the shadow of the\nforbidden place when fighting began and he fled inside.\n\nIt was perfectly apparent to me that he was telling the truth--and,\nmore, that any diversionary riot designed to get _him_ inside with\na hypodermic and gas gun would have been planned by maniacs, for I\ndoubted he could have found the trigger of the gun. But Lawton seemed\nto think he was lying.\n\nIt was growing late. Lawton offered to drive me to my hotel, leaving\nthe man in the custody of the expediters. On the way, out of curiosity,\nI asked: \"Suppose he had succeeded? Can you revive a suspendee as\neasily as that, just by sticking a needle in his arm?\"\n\nLawton grunted. \"Pretty near, that and artificial respiration. One case\nin a hundred might need something else--heart massage or an incubator,\nfor instance. But most of the time an antilytic shot is enough.\"\n\nThen Rena had not been as mad as I thought.\n\nI said: \"And do you think that old man could have accomplished\nanything?\"\n\nLawton looked at me curiously. \"Maybe.\"\n\n\"Who do you suppose he was after?\"\n\nLawton said off-handedly. \"He was right near Bay 100, wasn't he?\"\n\n\"Bay 100?\" Something struck a chord; I remembered following Rena down\nthe corridor, passing a door that was odd in some way. Was the number\n100 on that door? \"Is that the one that's locked off, with the sign on\nit that says anybody who goes in is asking for trouble?\"\n\n\"That's the one. Though,\" he added, \"nobody is going to get in. That\ndoor is triple-plate armor; the lock opens only to the personal\nfingerprint pattern of Defoe and two or three others.\"\n\n\"What's inside it that's so important?\"\n\nHe said coldly, \"How would I know? I can't open the door.\" And that was\nthe end of the conversation. I knew _he_ was lying.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI had changed my bet with myself on the way. I won it. Rena was in the\nroom waiting for me. She was sound asleep, stretched out on the bed.\nShe looked as sober-faced and intent in her sleep as a little girl--a\nlook I had noticed in Marianna's sleeping face once.\n\nIt was astonishing how little I thought about Marianna any more.\n\nI considered very carefully before I rang for a bellboy, but it seemed\nwisest to let her sleep and take my chances with the house detective,\nif any. There was none, it turned out. In fact, the bellboy hardly\nnoticed her--whether out of indifference or because he was well aware\nthat I had signed for the room with an official travel-credit card of\nthe Company, it didn't much matter. He succeeded in conveying, without\nsaying a word, that the Blue Sky was the limit.\n\nI ordered dinner, waving away the menu and telling him to let the chef\ndecide. The chef decided well. Among other things, there was a bottle\nof champagne in a bucket of ice.\n\nRena woke up slowly at first, and then popped to a sitting position,\neyes wide. I said quickly, \"Everything's all right. No one saw you at\nthe clinic.\"\n\nShe blinked once. In a soft voice, she said, \"Thank you.\" She sighed a\nvery small sigh and slipped off the bed.\n\nI realized as Rena was washing up, comparisons were always odious,\nbut--Well, if a strange man had found Marianna with her dress hitched\nhalfway up her thigh, asleep on his bed, he'd have been in for\nsomething. What the \"something\" would be might depend on circumstances;\nit might be a raging order to knock before he came in, it might only\nbe a storm of blushes and a couple of hours of meticulously prissy\nbehavior. But she wouldn't just let it slide. And Rena, by simply\ndisregarding it, was as modest as any girl could be.\n\nAfter all, I told myself, warming to the subject, it wasn't as if\nI were some excitable adolescent. I could see a lovely girl's legs\nwithout getting all stirred up. For that matter, I hardly even noticed\nthem, come to think of it. And if I _did_ notice them, it was certainly\nnothing of any importance; I had dismissed it casually, practically\nforgotten it, in fact.\n\nShe came back and said cheerfully, \"I'm hungry!\" And so, I realized,\nwas I.\n\nWe started to eat without much discussion, except for the necessary\ntalk of the table. I felt very much at ease sitting across from her,\nin spite of the fact that she had placed herself in opposition to\nthe Company. I felt relaxed and comfortable; nothing bothered me.\nCertainly, I went on in my mind, I was as free and easy with her as\nwith any man; it didn't matter that she was an attractive girl at all.\nI wasn't thinking of her in that way, only as someone who needed some\nhelp.\n\nI came to. She was looking at me with friendly curiosity. She said, \"Is\nthat an American idiom, Tom, when you said, 'Please pass the legs'?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe didn't open the champagne: it didn't seem quite appropriate. We had\nnot discussed anything of importance while we were eating, except that\nI had told her about the old man; she evidently knew nothing about him.\nShe was concerned, but I assured her he was safe with the Company--what\ndid she think they were, barbarians? She didn't answer.\n\nBut after dinner, with our coffee, I said: \"Now let's get down to\nbusiness. What were you doing in the clinic?\"\n\n\"I was trying to rescue my father,\" she said.\n\n\"Rescue, Rena? Rescue from what?\"\n\n\"Tom, please. You believe in the Company, do you not?\"\n\n\"Of course!\"\n\n\"And I do not. We shall never agree. I am grateful to you for not\nturning me in, and I think perhaps I know what it cost you to do it.\nBut that is all, Tom.\"\n\n\"But the Company--\"\n\n\"When you speak of the Company, what is it you see? Something shining\nand wonderful? It is not that way with me; what I see is--rows of my\nfriends, frozen in the vaults or the expediters and that poor old man\nyou caught.\"\n\nThere was no reasoning with her. She had fixed in her mind that all the\nsuspendees were the victims of some sinister brutality. Of course, it\nwasn't like that at all.\n\nSuspension wasn't death; everyone knew that. In fact, it was the\nantithesis of death. It _saved_ lives by taking the maimed and sick and\nputting them mercifully to sleep, until they could be repaired.\n\nTrue, their bodies grew cold, the lungs stopped pumping, the heart\nstopped throbbing; true, no doctor could tell, on sight, whether a\nsuspendee was \"alive\" or \"dead.\" The life processes were not entirely\nhalted, but they were slowed enormously--enough so that chemical\ndiffusion in the jellylike blood carried all the oxygen the body\nneeded. But there was a difference: The dead were dead, whereas the\nsuspendees could be brought back to life at any moment the Company\nchose.\n\nBut I couldn't make her see that. I couldn't even console her by\nreminding her that the old man was a mere Class E. For so was she.\n\nI urged reasonably: \"Rena, you think something is going on under the\nsurface. Tell me about it. Why do you think your father was put in\nsuspension?\"\n\n\"To keep him out of the way. Because the Company is afraid of him.\"\n\nI played a trump card: \"Suppose I told you the _real_ reason he's in\nthe vaults.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe was hit by that, I could tell. She was staring at me with wonder in\nher eyes.\n\n\"You don't have to speculate about it, Rena. I looked up his record,\nyou see.\"\n\n\"You--you--\"\n\nI nodded. \"It's right there in black and white. They're trying to save\nhis life. He has radiation poisoning. He was a war casualty. It's\nstandard medical practice in cases like his to put them in suspension\nfor a while, until the level of radioactivity dies down and they can\nsafely be revived. Now what do you say?\"\n\nShe merely stared at me.\n\nI pressed on persuasively: \"Rena, I don't mean to call your beliefs\nsuperstitions or anything like that. Please understand me. You have\nyour own cultural heritage and--well, I know that it looks as though he\nis some kind of 'undead,' or however you put it, in your folk stories.\nI know there are legends of vampires and zombies and so on, but--\"\n\nShe was actually laughing. \"You're thinking of Central Europe, Tom,\nnot Naples. And anyway--\" she was laughing only with her eyes now--\"I\ndo not believe that the legends say that vampires are produced by\nintravenous injections of chlorpromazine and pethidine in a lytic\nsolution--which is, I believe, the current technique at the clinics.\"\n\nI flared peevishly: \"Damn it, don't you want him saved?\"\n\nThe laughter was gone. She gently touched my hand. \"I'm sorry. I don't\nmean to be a shrew and that remark wasn't kind. Must we discuss it?\"\n\n\"Yes!\"\n\n\"Very well.\" She faced me, chin out and fierce. \"My father does not\nhave radiation poisoning, Tom.\"\n\n\"He does.\"\n\n\"He does not! He is a prisoner, not a patient. He loved Naples.\nThat's why he was put to sleep--for fifty years, or a hundred, until\neverything he knew and loved grows away from him and nobody cares what\nhe has to say any more. They won't kill him--they don't have to! They\njust want him out of the way, because he sees the Company for what it\nis.\"\n\n\"And what is that?\"\n\n\"Tyranny, Tom,\" she said quietly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI burst out, \"Rena, that's silly! The Company is the hope of the world.\nIf you talk like that, you'll be in trouble. That's dangerous thinking,\nyoung lady. It attacks the foundations of our whole society!\"\n\n\"Good! I was hoping it would!\"\n\nWe were shouting at each other like children. I took time to remember\none of the priceless rules out of the Adjusters' Handbook: _Never\nlose your temper; think before you speak_. We glared at each other in\nfurious silence for a moment before I forced myself to simmer down.\n\nOnly then did I remember that I needed to know something she might be\nable to tell me. Organization, Defoe had said--an organization that\nopposed the Company, that was behind Hammond's death and the riot at\nthe clinic and more, much more.\n\n\"Rena, why did your friends kill Hammond?\"\n\nHer poise was shaken. \"Who?\" she asked.\n\n\"Hammond. In Caserta. By a gang of anti-Company hoodlums.\"\n\nHer eyes flashed, but she only said: \"I know nothing of any killings.\"\n\n\"Yet you admit you belong to a subversive group?\"\n\n\"I admit nothing,\" she said shortly.\n\n\"But you do. I know you do. You said as much to me, when you were\nprevented from reviving your father.\"\n\nShe shrugged.\n\nI went on: \"Why did you call me at the office, Rena? Was it to get me\nto help you work against the Company?\"\n\nShe looked at me for a long moment. Then she said: \"It was. And would\nyou like to know why I picked you?\"\n\n\"Well, I suppose--\"\n\n\"Don't suppose, Tom.\" Her nostrils were white. She said coldly: \"You\nseemed like a very good bet, as far as we could tell. I will tell you\nsomething you don't know. There is a memorandum regarding you in the\noffice of the Chief of Expediters in Naples. I do not choose to tell\nyou how I know of it, but even your Mr. Gogarty doesn't know it exists.\nIt is private and secret, and it says of you, 'Loyalty doubtful.\nBelieved in contact with underground movement. Keep under close but\nsecret surveillance'.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat one rocked me, I admit. \"But that's all wrong!\" I finally burst\nout. \"I admit I went through a bad time after Marianna died, but--\"\n\nShe was smiling, though still angry. \"Are you apologizing to _me_?\"\n\n\"No, but--\" I stopped. That was a matter to be taken up with Defoe, I\ntold myself, and I was beginning to feel a little angry, too.\n\n\"All right,\" I said. \"There's been a mistake; I'll see that it's\nstraightened out. But even if it was true, did you think I was the kind\nof man to join a bunch of murderers?\"\n\n\"We are not murderers!\"\n\n\"Hammond's body says different.\"\n\n\"We had nothing to do with that, Tom!\"\n\n\"Your friend Slovetski did.\" It was a shot in the dark. It missed by a\nmile.\n\nShe said loftily: \"If he is such a killer, how did you escape? When I\nhad my interview with you, and it became apparent that the expediters\nwere less than accurate, the information came a little late. You could\neasily have given us trouble--Slovetski was in the next room. Why\ndidn't he shoot you dead?\"\n\n\"Maybe he didn't want to be bothered with my body.\"\n\n\"And maybe you are all wrong about us!\"\n\n\"No! If you're against the Company, I _can't_ be wrong. The Company is\nthe greatest blessing the world has ever known--it's made the world a\nparadise!\"\n\n\"It has?\" She made a snorting sound. \"How?\"\n\n\"By bringing countless blessings to all of us. _Countless!_\"\n\nShe was shaking with the effort of controlling her temper. \"Name one!\"\n\nI swore in exasperation. \"All right,\" I said. \"It ended war.\"\n\nShe nodded--not a nod of agreement, but because she had expected that\nanswer. \"Right out of the textbooks and propaganda pieces, Tom. Tell\nme, why is my father in the vaults?\"\n\n\"Because he has radiation poisoning!\"\n\n\"And how did he get this radiation poisoning?\"\n\n\"How?\" I blinked at her. \"You know how, Rena. In the war between Naples\nand--the war--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRena said remorselessly, \"That's right, Tom, the war. The war that\ncouldn't have existed, because the Company ended war--everybody knows\nthat. Ah, Tom! For God, tell me, why is the world blind? Everyone\nbelieves, no one questions. The Company ended war--it says so itself.\nAnd the blind world never sees the little wars that rage, all the time,\none upon the heels of another. The Company has ended disease. But how\nmany deaths are there? The Company has abolished poverty. But am I\nliving in riches, Tom? Was the old man who ran into the vaults?\"\n\nI stammered, \"But--but, Rena, the statistical charts show very\nclearly--\"\n\n\"No, Tom,\" she said, gentle again. \"The statistical charts show _less_\nwar, not no war. They show _less_ disease.\"\n\nShe rubbed her eyes wearily--and even then I thought: Marianna wouldn't\nhave dared; it would have smeared her mascara.\n\n\"The trouble with you, Tom, is that you're an American. You don't\nknow how it is in the world, only in America. You don't know what it\nwas like after the Short War, when America won and the flying squads\nof Senators came over and the governments that were left agreed to\ndefederate. You're used to a big and united country, not little\ncity-states. You don't have thousands of years of intrigue and tyranny\nand plot behind you, so you close your eyes and plunge ahead, and if\nthe charts show things are getting a _little_ better, you think they\nare perfect.\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"But not us, Tom. We can't afford that. We walk\nwith eyes that dart about, seeking danger. Sometimes we see ghosts,\nbut sometimes we see real menace. You look at the charts and you see\nthat there are fewer wars than before. We--we look at the charts and we\nsee our fathers and brothers dead in a little war that hardly makes a\nripple on the graph. You don't even see them, Tom. You don't even see\nthe disease cases that don't get cured--because the techniques are\n'still experimental,' they say. You don't--Tom! What is it?\"\n\nI suppose I showed the pain of remembrance. I said with an effort,\n\"Sorry, Rena. You made me think of something. Please go on.\"\n\n\"That's all of it, Tom. You in America can't be blamed. The big\nlie--the lie so preposterous that it cannot be questioned, the thing\nthat proves itself because it is so unbelievable that no one would say\nit if it weren't true--is not an American invention. It is European,\nTom. You aren't inoculated against it. We are.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI took a deep breath. \"What about your father, Rena? Do you really\nthink the Company is out to get him?\"\n\nShe looked at me searchingly, then looked hopelessly away. \"Not as you\nmean it, Tom,\" she said at last. \"No, I am no paranoid. I think he\nis--inconvenient. I think the Company finds him less trouble in the\ndeep-freeze than he would be walking around.\"\n\n\"But don't you agree that he needs treatment?\"\n\n\"For what? For the radiation poisoning that he got from the atomic\nexplosion he was nowhere near, Tom? Remember, he is my father! I was\nwith him in the war--and he never stirred a kilometer from our home.\nYou've been there, the big house where my aunt Luisa now lives. Did\nyou see bomb craters there?\"\n\n\"_That's a lie!_\" I had to confess it to myself: Rena was beginning to\nmean something to me. But there were emotional buttons that even she\ncouldn't push. If she had been a man, any man, I would have had my fist\nin her face before she had said that much; treason against the Company\nwas more than I could take. \"You can't convince me that the Company\ndeliberately falsifies records. Don't forget, Rena, I'm an executive of\nthe Company! Nothing like that could go on!\"\n\nHer eyes flared, but her lips were rebelliously silent.\n\nI said furiously: \"I'll hear no more of that. Theoretical discussions\nare all right; I'm as broad-minded as the next man. But when you accuse\nthe Company of outright fraud, you--well, you're mistaken.\"\n\nWe glowered at each other for a long moment. My eyes fell first.\n\nI said sourly, \"I'm sorry if I called you a liar. I--I didn't mean to\nbe offensive.\"\n\n\"Nor I, Tom,\" she hesitated. \"Will you remember that I asked you not to\nmake me discuss it?\"\n\nShe stood up. \"Thank you very much for a dinner. And for listening. And\nmost of all, for giving me another chance to rescue my father.\"\n\nI looked at my watch automatically--and incredulously. \"It's late,\nRena. Have you a place to stay?\"\n\nShe shrugged. \"N--yes, of course, Tom. Don't worry about me; I'll be\nall right.\"\n\n\"Are you sure?\"\n\n\"Very sure.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHer manner was completely confident--so much so that I knew it for an\nact.\n\nI said: \"Please, Rena, you've been through a tough time and I don't\nwant you wandering around. You can't get back to Naples tonight.\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Well what, Tom?\" she said. \"I won't lie to you--I haven't a place to\ngo to here. I would have had, this afternoon, if I had succeeded. But\nby now, everything has changed. They--that is, my friends will assume\nthat I have been captured by the Company. They won't be where I could\nfind them, Tom. Say they are silly if you wish. But they will fear that\nthe Company might--request me to give their names.\"\n\nI said crisply, \"Stay here, Rena. No--listen to me. You stay here. I'll\nget another room.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Tom, but you can't. There isn't a room in Anzio; there are\nfamilies of suspendees sleeping in the grass tonight.\"\n\n\"I can sleep in the grass if I have to.\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"Thank you,\" she repeated.\n\nI stood between her and the door. \"Then we'll both stay here. I'll\nsleep on the couch. You can have the bed.\" I hesitated, then added,\n\"You can trust me, Rena.\"\n\nShe looked at me gravely for a moment. Then she smiled. \"I'm sure I\ncan, Tom. I appreciate your offer. I accept.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI am built too long for a hotel-room couch, particularly a room in a\nMediterranean coastal fleabag. I lay staring into the white Italian\nnight; the Moon brightened the clouds outside the window, and the room\nwas clearly enough illuminated to show me the bed and the slight,\nmotionless form in it. Rena was not a restless sleeper, I thought. Nor\ndid she snore.\n\nRena was a most self-possessed girl, in fact. She had overruled me when\nI tried to keep the bellboy from clearing away the dinner service.\n\"Do you think no other Company man ever had a girl in his room?\" she\ninnocently asked. She borrowed a pair of the new pajamas Defoe's\nthoughtful expediters had bought and put in the bureau. But I hadn't\nexpected that, while the bellboy was clearing away, she would be\nsoftly singing to herself in the bath.\n\nHe had seemed not even to hear.\n\nHe had also leaped to conclusions--not that it was much of a leap, I\nsuppose. But he had conspicuously not removed the bottle of champagne\nand its silver bucket of melting ice.\n\nIt felt good, being in the same room with Rena.\n\nI shifted again, hunching up my torso to give my legs a chance to\nstretch out. I looked anxiously to see if the movement had disturbed\nher.\n\nThere is a story about an animal experimenter who left a chimpanzee in\nan empty room. He closed the door on the ape and bent to look through\nthe key-hole, to see what the animal would do. But all he saw was an\neye--because the chimp was just as curious about the experimenter.\n\nIn the half-light, I saw a sparkle of moonlight in Rena's eye; she was\nwatching me. She half-giggled, a smothered sound.\n\n\"You ought to be asleep,\" I accused.\n\n\"And you, Tom.\"\n\nI obediently closed my eyes, but I didn't stop seeing her.\n\n_It only she weren't a fanatic._\n\nAnd if she had to be a fanatic, why did she have to be the one kind\nthat was my natural enemy, a member of the group of irresponsible\ntroublemakers that Defoe had ordered me to \"handle\"?\n\nWhat, I wondered, did he mean by \"handle\"? Did it include\nchlorpromazine in a lytic solution and a plastic cocoon?\n\nI put that thought out of my mind; there was no chance whatever\nthat her crazy belief, that the Company was using suspension as a\nretaliatory measure, was correct. But thinking of Defoe made me think\nof my work. After all, I told myself, Rena was more than a person. She\nwas a key that could unlock the whole riddle. She had the answers--if\nthere was a movement of any size, she would know its structure.\n\nI thought for a moment and withdrew the \"if.\" She had admitted the riot\nof that afternoon was planned. It _had_ to be a tightly organized group.\n\nAnd she had to have the key.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt last, I had been getting slightly drowsy, but suddenly I was wide\nawake.\n\nThere were two possibilities. I faced the first of them shakily--_she\nmight be right_. Everything within me revolted against the notion, but\nI accepted it as a theoretical possibility. If so, I would, of course,\nhave to revise some basic notions.\n\nOn the other hand, she might be wrong. I was certain she _was_ wrong.\nBut I was equally certain she was no raddled malcontent and if she\nwas wrong, and I could prove it to her, she herself might make some\nrevisions.\n\nPropped on one elbow, I peered at her. \"Rena?\" I whispered\nquestioningly.\n\nShe stirred. \"Yes, Tom?\"\n\n\"If you're not asleep, can we take a couple more minutes to talk?\"\n\n\"Of course.\" I sat up and reached for the light switch, but she said,\n\"Must we have the lights? The Moon is very bright.\"\n\n\"Sure.\" I sat on the edge of the couch and reached for a cigarette.\n\"Can I offer you a deal, Rena?\"\n\n\"What sort of deal?\"\n\n\"A horsetrade. You think the Company is corrupt and your father is not\na casualty, right?\"\n\n\"Correct, Tom.\"\n\n\"And I think the Company is not corrupt and your father has radiation\npoisoning. One of us has to be wrong, right?\"\n\n\"Correct, Tom.\"\n\n\"Let's find out. There are ways of testing for radiation-sickness. I'll\ngo into the clinic in the morning and get the answer.\"\n\nShe also lifted up on one elbow, peering at me, her long hair braided\ndown her back. \"Will you?\"\n\n\"Sure. And we'll make bets on it, Rena. If you are wrong--if your\nfather has radiation poisoning--I want you to tell me everything\nthere is to tell about the riot today and the people behind it. If I'm\nwrong--\" I swallowed--\"if I'm wrong, I'll get your father out of there\nfor you. Somehow. I promise it, Rena.\"\n\nThere was absolute silence for a long time. Then she swung out of the\nbed and hurried over to me, her hands on mine. She looked at me and\nagain I saw tears. \"Will you do that, Tom?\" she asked, hardly audible.\n\n\"Why, sure,\" I said awkwardly. \"But you have to promise--\"\n\n\"I promise!\"\n\nShe was staring at me, at arm's length. And then something happened.\nShe wasn't staring and she wasn't at arm's length.\n\nKissing her was like tasting candied violets; and the Moon made\nher lovelier than anything human; and the bellboy had not been so\npresumptuous, after all, when he left us the champagne.\n\n\nVIII\n\nDr. Lawton was \"away from his desk\" the next morning. That was all to\nthe good. I was not a hardened enough conspirator to seek out chances\nto make mistakes, and although I had a perfectly good excuse for\nwanting to go down into the vaults again, I wasn't anxious to have to\nuse it.\n\nThe expediter-officer in charge, though, didn't even ask for reasons.\nHe furnished me with what I wanted--a map of the vaults and a\nradiation-counter--and turned me loose.\n\nLooking at the map, I was astonished at the size of this subterranean\npyramid. Lawton had said we had eighty-odd thousand sleepers filed away\nand that had surprised me, but by the chart I held in my hand, there\nwas space for perhaps ten times that many. It was beyond belief that so\nmuch space was really needed, I thought--unless there was some truth to\nRena's belief that the Company used the clinics for prisons....\n\nI applied myself to the map.\n\nAnd, naturally, I read it wrong. It was very simple; I merely went to\nthe wrong level, that was all.\n\nIt looked wrong as soon as I stepped out of the elevator. An elderly,\nofficious civilian with a British accent barred my way. \"You aren't one\nof us, are you?\"\n\nI said, \"I doubt it.\"\n\n\"Then would you mind?\" he asked politely, and indicated a spot on the\nside of the hall. Perhaps I was suggestible, but I obeyed his request\nwithout question. It was just as well, because a sort of procession\nrounded a bend and came down the corridor. There was a wheeled\nstretcher, with three elderly civilians puttering around it, and a\nbored medic following with a jar of something held aloft, feeding\nthrough a thin plastic tube into the arm of the man on the stretcher,\nas well as half a dozen others of more nondescript types.\n\nThe man who had stopped me nearly ran to meet the stretcher. He stared\ninto the waxy face and whispered, \"It's he! Oh, absolutely, it is he!\"\n\nI looked and the face was oddly familiar. It reminded me of my\nchildhood; it had a link with school days and the excitement of turning\ntwelve. By the way the four old men were carrying on, however, it meant\nmore than that to them. It meant, if not the Second Coming, at least\nsomething close to it.\n\nBy then I had figured out that this was that rare event in the day of\na clinic--a revival. I had never seen one. I suppose I could have got\nout of the way and gone about my conspiratorial business, and it is no\ncredit to me as a conspirator that I did not. But I was fascinated.\n\nToo fascinated to wonder why revivals were so rare....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe medic looked at his watch and, with careless efficiency, plucked\nthe tube out of the waxy man's arm.\n\n\"Two minutes,\" he said to one of the civilians. \"Then he'll be as good\nas he ever was. You've got his clothes and release papers?\"\n\n\"Oh, definitely,\" said the civilian, beaming.\n\n\"Okay. And you understand that the Company takes no responsibility\nbeyond the policy covering? After all, he was one of the first men\nsuspended. We think we can give him another year or so--which is a year\nmore than he would have had, at that--but he's not what you'd call a\nGrade A risk.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" agreed the civilian. \"Can we talk to him now?\"\n\n\"As soon as he opens his eyes.\"\n\nThe civilian bent over the man, who no longer looked waxy. His face\nwas now a mottled gray and his eyelids were flickering. He had begun\nto breathe heavily and irregularly, and he was mumbling something I\ncouldn't understand. The civilian whispered in his ear and the revived\nman opened his eyes and looked at him.\n\nIt was like seeing the dead come to life. It was exactly that, in fact;\ntwenty minutes before, no chemical test, no stethoscope or probing\nthumb in the eye socket could have detected the faint living glow in\nthe almost-dead cells. And yet--now he looked, he breathed, he spoke.\n\n\"I made it,\" were his first understandable words.\n\n\"Indeed you did!\" crowed the civilian in charge, while all of the\nothers murmured happily to each other. \"Sir, it is my pleasure to\nwelcome you back to us. You are in Anzio, Italy. And I am Thomas\nWelbourne, at your service.\"\n\nThe faint eyes sparkled. Dead, near-dead or merely decrepit, this was\na man who wanted to enjoy life. Minutes out of the tomb, he said: \"No!\nNot young Tommy Welbourne!\"\n\n\"His grandson, sir,\" said the civilian.\n\nI had it just then--that face had watched me through a whole year of\nschool. It had been in a frame at the front of the room, with half a\ndozen other faces. It had a name under it, which, try as I might, I\ncouldn't recall; but the face was there all the same. It was an easy\none to keep in mind--strong though sunken, ancient but very much alive.\n\nHe was saying, in a voice as confident as any youth's, \"Ah, Tommy, I've\nlived to see it! Tell me, have you been to Mars? What is on the other\nside of the Moon? And the Russians--what are the Russians up to these\ndays?\"\n\nThe civilian coughed and tried to interrupt, but the figure on the\nstretcher went on heedlessly: \"All those years gone--what wonders must\nwe have. A tunnel under the Atlantic, I'll wager! And ships that fly a\nhundred times the speed of sound. Tell me, Tommy Welbourne! Don't keep\nan old man waiting!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe civilian said reluctantly, but patiently, \"Perhaps it will take a\nlittle explaining, sir. You see, there have been changes--\"\n\n\"I know it, boy! That's what I'm asking you!\"\n\n\"Well, not that sort of changes, sir. We've learned new virtues since\nyour time--patience and stability, things of that sort. You see--\"\n\nThe interesting part was over and the glances of the others in the\nparty reminded me that I didn't belong here. I stole off, but not\nbefore the man on the stretcher noticed me and made a sort of clumsy\ntwo-fingered salute of hail and farewell as I left. It was exactly like\nthe gesture in his picture on that schoolroom wall, up next to the\npresidents and the greatest of kings.\n\nI found a staircase and climbed to another level of the boxlike clinic.\n\nThe local peasants called the vaults \"coolers\" or \"ice cubes.\" I\nsuppose the reason had something to do with the fact that they were\ncool and rectangular, on the whole--perhaps because, like icebergs, the\ngreat bulk of the vaults was below the surface. But whatever you called\nthem, they were huge. And the clinic at Anzio was only one out of\nhundreds scattered all over the world.\n\nIt was all a matter of viewpoint. To me, the clinics were emblems of\nthe Company's concern for the world. In any imaginable disaster--even\nif some fantastic plague struck the entire race at once--the affected\npopulation could be neatly and effectively preserved until medicine\ncould catch up with their cures.\n\nTo Rena, they were prisons big enough to hold the human race.\n\nIt was time to find out which of us was right. I hurried through the\ncorridors, between the tiers of sleepers, almost touching them on both\nsides. I saw the faint purplish gleam where Rena had spilled the fluid,\nand knelt beside the cocoon that held her father.\n\nThe UV sterilizers overhead made everything look ghastly violet, but in\nany light, the waxy face under the plastic would have looked dead as\ndeath itself. I couldn't blame Rena for weeping.\n\nI took out the little radiation counter and looked at it awkwardly.\nThere was nothing complicated about the device--fortunately, because\nI had had little experience with them. It was a cylinder with a\nflaring snout at one end, a calibrated gauge at the side, marked in\nmicro-roentgens. The little needle flickered in the green area of the\ndial. I held it to myself and the reading didn't change. I pointed it\nup and pointed it down; it didn't change.\n\nI held it to the radiation-seared body of Benedetto dell'Angela.\n\nAnd it didn't change.\n\nRadiation-seared? Not unless the instrument lied! If dell'Angela\nhad ever in his life been within the disaster radius of an atomic\nexplosion, it had been so long before that every trace of radioactive\nbyproduct was gone!\n\nRena was right!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI worked like a machine, hardly thinking. I stood up and hurriedly\ntouched the ion-tasting snout of the counter to the body on the shelf\nabove Benedetto, the one above that, a dozen chosen at random up and\ndown the aisle.\n\nTwo of them sent the needle surging clear off the scale; three were\nas untainted by radioactivity as Benedetto himself. A few others gave\nreadings from \"mild\" to \"lethal\"--but all in the danger area.\n\n_Most were as untainted by radiation as Benedetto himself._\n\nIt was possible, I told myself frantically, that there were mysteries\nhere I did not understand. Perhaps after a few months or a year, the\nradiation level would drop, so that the victim was still in deadly\ndanger while the emitted radiation of his body was too slight to\naffect the counter. I didn't see how, but it was worth a thought.\nAnything was worth a thought that promised another explanation to this\nthan the one Rena had given!\n\nThere had been, I remembered, a score or more of new suspendees in the\nmain receiving vault at the juncture of the corridors. I hurried back\nto it. Here were fresh cases, bound to show on the gauge.\n\nI leaned over the nearest one, first checking to make sure its\nidentification tag was the cross-hatched red one that marked\n\"radiation.\" I brought the counter close to the shriveled face--\n\nBut I didn't read the dial, not at first. I didn't have to. For I\nrecognized that face. I had seen it, contorted in terror, mumbling\nfrantic pleas for mercy, weeping and howling, on the old Class E\nuninsurable the expediters had found hiding in the vaults.\n\n_He_ had no radiation poisoning ... unless a bomb had exploded in these\nvery vaults in the past twelve hours.\n\nIt wasn't pleasant to stand there and stare around the vaults that were\ndesigned for the single purpose of saving human life--and to wonder how\nmany of the eighty thousand souls it held were also prisoners.\n\nAnd it wasn't even tolerable to think the thought that followed. If\nthe Company was corrupt, and I had worked to do the Company's business,\nhow much of this guilt was mine?\n\nThe Company, I had said and thought and tried to force others to agree,\nwas the hope of humanity--the force that had permanently ended war\n(almost), driven out disease (nearly), destroyed the threat to any\nhuman of hunger or homelessness (in spite of the starving old man who\nslept in the shadow of the crypt, and others like him).\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut I had to face the facts that controverted the Big Lie. If war was\nended, what about Naples and Sicily, and Prague and Vienna, and all the\nsquabbles in the Far East? _If there was no danger from disease, why\nhad Marianna died?_\n\nRena had said that if there was no danger of disaster, no one would\nhave paid their premiums. Obviously the Company could not have\nwanted that, but why had I never seen it before? Sample wars, sample\ndeaths--the Company needed them. And no one, least of all me, fretted\nabout how the samples felt about it.\n\nWell, that was behind me. I'd made a bet with Rena, and I'd lost, and I\nhad to pay off.\n\nI opened the cased hypodermic kit Rena had given me and examined\nit uncomfortably. I had never used the old-fashioned sort of needle\nhypodermic; I knew a little something about the high-pressure spray\ntype that forced its contents into the skin without leaving a mark, but\nI was very far from sure that I could manage this one without doing\nsomething wrong. Besides, there wasn't much of the fluid left, only the\nfew drops left in the bottom of the bottle after Rena had loaded the\nneedle that had been smashed.\n\nI hurried back along the corridor toward Benedetto dell'Angela. I\nneared again the red-labeled door marked Bay 100, glanced at it in\npassing--and stopped.\n\nThis was the door that only a handful of people could open. It was\nlabeled in five languages: \"Entrance Strictly Prohibited. Experimental\nSection.\"\n\nWhy was it standing ajar?\n\nAnd I heard a faint whisper of a moan: \"_Aiutemi, aiutemi._\"\n\nSomeone inside was calling for help!\n\nIf I had been a hardened conspirator, I would never have stopped to\ninvestigate. But, of course, I wasn't. I pushed the door aside, against\nresistance, and peered in.\n\nAnd that was my third major shock in the past quarter of an hour,\nbecause, writhing feebly just inside the door, staring up at me with an\nexpression of pain and anger, was Luigi Zorchi.\n\nHe propped himself up on his hands, the rags of his plastic cocoon\ndangling from his shoulders.\n\n\"Oho,\" he said faintly. \"The apprentice assassin again.\"\n\nI found water for him at a bubble-fountain by the ramp; he drank at\nleast a quart before I made him stop. Then he lay back, panting,\nstaring at me. Except for the shreds of plastic and the bandages around\nthe stumps of his legs, he was nude, like all the other suspendees\ninside their sacks. The luxuriant hair had already begun to grow back.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe licked his lips. More vigorous now, he snarled: \"The plan fails,\ndoes it not? You think you have Zorchi out of the way, but he will not\nstay there.\"\n\nI said, \"Zorchi, I'm sorry about all this I--I know more now than I did\nyesterday.\"\n\nHe gaped. \"Yesterday? Only _yesterday_?\" He shook his head. \"I would\nhave thought a month, at the least. I have been crawling, assassin.\nCrawling for days, I thought.\" He tried to shrug--not easy, because he\nwas leaning on his elbows. \"Very well, Weels. You may take me back to\nfinish the job now. Sticking me with a needle and putting me on ice\nwill not work. Perhaps you should kill me outright.\"\n\n\"Listen, Zorchi, I _said_ I was sorry. Let's let it go at that for a\nmoment. I--I admit you shouldn't be here. The question is, how do you\ncome to be awake?\"\n\n\"How not? I am Zorchi, Weels. Cut me and I heal; poison me and I cure\nmyself.\" He spat furiously. \"Starve me, however, and I no doubt will\ndie, and it is true that you have come very near to starving me down\nhere.\" He glowered at the shelves of cocooned bodies in the locked bay.\n\"A pity, with all this pork and beef on the rack, waiting for me, but I\nfind I am not a monster, Weels. It is a weakness; I do not suppose it\nwould stop any Company man for a moment.\"\n\n\"Look, Zorchi,\" I begged, \"take my word for it--I want to help you. You\nmight as well believe me, you know. You can't be any worse off than you\nare.\"\n\nHe stared at me sullenly for a moment. Then, \"True enough,\" he\nadmitted. \"What then, Weels?\"\n\nI said hesitantly, \"Well, I'd like to get you out of here....\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. I would like that, too. How shall we do it?\"\n\nI rubbed the back of my neck thoughtfully, staring at him. I had had\na sort of half-baked, partly worked out plan for rescuing Benedetto.\nWake him up with the needle; find a medical orderly's whites somewhere;\ndress him; and walk him out.\n\nIt wasn't the best of all possible plans, but I had rank enough,\nparticularly with Defoe off in Rome, to take a few liberties or stop\nquestions if it became necessary. And besides, I hadn't really thought\nI'd have to do it. I had fully expected--as recently as half an hour\nago!--that I would find Benedetto raddled with gamma rays, a certainty\nfor death if revived before the half-life period of the radioelements\nin his body had brought the level down to safety.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat plan might work for Benedetto. But Zorchi, to mention only one\npossible obstacle, couldn't walk. And Benedetto, once I took off his\nbeard with the razor Rena had insisted I bring for that purpose, would\nnot be likely to be recognized by anyone.\n\nZorchi, on the other hand, was very nearly unforgettable.\n\nI said honestly, \"I don't know.\"\n\nHe nodded. \"Nor do I, Weels. Take me then to your Defoe.\" His face\nwrinkled in an expression of fury and fear. \"Die I can, if I must, but\nI do not wish to starve. It is good to be able to grow a leg, but do\nyou understand that the leg must come from somewhere? I cannot make\nit out of air, Weels--I must eat. When I am in my home at Naples, I\neat five, six, eight times a day; it is the way my body must have it.\nSo if Defoe wishes to kill me, we will let him, but I must leave here\n_now_.\"\n\nI shook my head. \"Please understand me, Zorchi--I can't even do that\nfor you. I can't have anybody asking me what I was doing down in this\nlevel.\" I hesitated only briefly; then, realizing that I was already in\nso deeply that secrecy no longer mattered, I told him about Benedetto\ndell'Angela, and the riot that failed, and my promise.\n\nHis reaction was incredulity. \"You did not know, Weels? The arms and\nlegs of the Company do not know what thoughts pass through its brain?\nTruly, the Company is a wonderful thing! Even the peasants know this\nmuch--the Company will do anything it must.\"\n\n\"I admit I never guessed. Now what?\"\n\n\"That is up to you, Weels. If you try to take the two of us out, it\nendangers you. It is for you to decide.\"\n\nSo, of course, I could decide only one way.\n\nI hid the hypodermic behind one of the bodies in Bay 100; it was no\nlonger useful to me. I persuaded Zorchi to lie quietly in one of the\ntiers near Benedetto, slammed the heavy door to Bay 100, and heard the\nlocks snap. That was the crossing of the Rubicon. You could open that\ndoor easily enough from inside--that was to protect any personnel who\nmight be caught in there. But only Defoe and a couple of others could\nopen it from without, and the hypodermic was now as far out of reach as\nthe Moon.\n\nI opened Benedetto dell'Angela's face mask and shaved him, then sealed\nit again. I found another suspendee of about the same build, made\nsure the man was not radioactive, and transferred them. I switched\ntags: Benedetto dell'Angela was now Elio Barletteria. Then I walked\nunsteadily to the ramp, picked up the intercom and ordered the medical\nofficer in charge to come down.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was not Dr. Lawton who came, fortunately, but one of his helpers who\nhad seen me before. I pointed to the pseudo-Barletteria. \"I want this\nman revived.\"\n\nHe sputtered, \"You--you can't just take a suspendee out of his trance,\nMr. Wills. It's a violation of medical ethics! These men are _sick_.\nThey--\"\n\n\"They'll be sicker still if we don't get some information from this\none,\" I said grimly. \"Are you going to obey Mr. Defoe's orders or not?\"\n\nHe sputtered some more, but he gave in. His orderlies took Benedetto\nto the receiving station at the foot of the vault; one of them stood by\nwhile the doctor worriedly went through his routine. I sat and smoked,\nwatching the procedure.\n\nIt was simple enough. One injection, a little chafing of the hands\nand feet by the bored orderly while the doctor glowered and I stonily\nrefused to answer his questions, and a lot of waiting. And then the\n\"casualty\" stirred and moaned.\n\nAll the stand-by apparatus was there--the oxygen tent and the pulmotor\nand the heart stimulator and so on. But none of it was needed.\n\nI said: \"Fine, Doctor. Now send the orderly to have an ambulance\nstanding by at the main entrance, and make out an exit pass for this\ncasualty.\"\n\n\"No!\" the doctor shouted. \"This is against every rule, Mr. Wills. I\ninsist on calling Dr. Lawton--\"\n\n\"By all means,\" I said. \"But there isn't much time. Make out the pass\nand get the ambulance, and we'll clear it with Dr. Lawton on the way\nout.\" He was all ready to say no again when I added: \"This is by direct\norder of Mr. Defoe. Are you questioning his orders?\"\n\nHe wasn't--not as long as I was going to clear it with Dr. Lawton.\nHe did as I asked. One of the advantages of the Company's rigid\nregulations was that it was hard to enforce strict security on its\npersonnel. If you didn't tell the staff that they were working\nfor something needing covering up, you couldn't expect them to be\nconstantly on guard.\n\nWhen the orderly was gone and the doctor had scrawled out the pass, I\nsaid cordially, \"Thank you, Doctor. Now would you like to know what all\nthe fuss was about?\"\n\n\"I certainly would,\" he snapped. \"If you think--\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" I apologized. \"Come over here and take a look at this man.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI juggled the radiation counter in my hand as he stalked over. \"Take a\nlook at his eyes,\" I invited.\n\n\"Are you trying to tell me that this is a dangerously radioactive case?\nI warn you, Mr. Wills--\"\n\n\"No, no,\" I said. \"See for yourself. Look at the right eye, just beside\nthe nose.\"\n\nHe bent over the awakening body, searchingly.\n\nI clonked him with the radiation counter on the back of the head. They\nmust have retired that particular counter from service after that; it\nwasn't likely to be very accurate any more.\n\nThe orderly found me bending over the doctor's body and calling for\nhelp. He bent, too, and he got the same treatment. Benedetto by then\nwas awake; he listened to me and didn't ask questions. The blessings of\ndealing with conspirators--it was not necessary to explain things more\nthan once.\n\nAnd so, with a correctly uniformed orderly, who happened to be\nBenedetto dell'Angela, pushing the stretcher, and with myself\ndisplaying a properly made out pass to the expediter at the door, we\nrolled the sham-unconscious body of Luigi Zorchi out to a waiting\nambulance.\n\nI felt my pulse hammering as we passed the expediter at the door.\nI had thrown my coat over the place where legs should have been on\n\"Barletteria,\" and Benedetto's old plastic cocoon, into which we had\nsqueezed Zorchi, concealed most of him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI needn't have worried. The expediter not only wasn't suspicious, he\nwasn't even interested.\n\nBenedetto and I lifted Zorchi into the ambulance. Benedetto climbed\nin after him and closed the doors, and I went to the front. \"You're\ndismissed,\" I told the driver. \"I'll drive.\"\n\nAs soon as we were out of sight of the clinic, I found a phone, got\nRena at the hotel, told her to meet me under the marquee. In five\nminutes, she was beside me and we were heading for the roads to the\nnorth.\n\n\"You win,\" I told her. \"Your father's in back--along with somebody\nelse. Now what? Do we just try to get lost in the hills somewhere?\"\n\n\"No, Tom,\" she said breathlessly. \"I--I have made arrangements.\" She\ngiggled. \"I walked around the square and around, until someone came up\nto me. You do not know how many gentlemen came before that! But then\none of my--friends showed up, to see if I was all right, and I arranged\nit. We go up the Rome highway two miles and there will be a truck.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" I said, stepping on the gas. \"Now do you want to climb back and\ntell your father--\"\n\nI stopped in the middle of the word. Rena peered at me. \"Tom,\" she\nasked anxiously, \"is something wrong?\"\n\nI swallowed, staring after a disappearing limousine in the rear-view\nmirror. \"I--hope not,\" I said. \"But your friends had better be there,\nbecause we don't have much time. I saw Defoe in the back of that\nlimousine.\"\n\n\nIX\n\nRena craned her neck around the door and peered into the nave of the\nchurch. \"He's kissing the Book,\" she reported. \"It will be perhaps\ntwenty minutes yet.\"\n\nHer father said mildly, \"I am in no hurry. It is good to rest here.\nThough truthfully, Mr. Wills, I thought I had been rested sufficiently\nby your Company.\"\n\nI think we were all grateful for the rest. It had been a hectic drive\nup from Anzio. Even though Rena's \"friends\" were thoughtful people,\nthey had not anticipated that we would have a legless man with us.\n\nThey had passports for Rena and myself and Benedetto; for Zorchi they\nhad none. It had been necessary for him to hide under a dirty tarpaulin\nin the trunk of the ancient charcoal-burning car, while Rena charmed\nthe Swiss Guards at the border. And it was risky. But the Guards\ncharmed easily, and we got through.\n\nZorchi did not much appreciate it. He swore a ragged blue streak when\nwe stopped in the shade of an olive grove and lugged him to the front\nseat again, and he didn't stop swearing until we hit the Appian Way.\nWhen the old gas-generator limped up a hill, he swore at its slowness;\nwhen it whizzed along the downgrades and level stretches, he swore at\nthe way he was being bounced around.\n\nI didn't regret rescuing Zorchi from the clinic--it was a matter of\nsimple justice since I had helped trick him into it. But I did wish\nthat it had been some more companionable personality that I had been\nobligated to.\n\nBenedetto, on the other hand, shook my hand and said: \"For God, I thank\nyou,\" and I felt well repaid. But he was in the back seat being brought\nup to date by his daughter; I had the honor of Zorchi's company next to\nme....\n\nThere was a long Latin period from the church, a response from\nthe altar boy, and then the final _Ite, missa est_. We heard the\nworshippers moving out of the church.\n\nThe priest came through the room we were waiting in, his robes\nswirling. He didn't look around, or give any sign that he knew we were\nthere, though he almost stepped on Zorchi, sitting propped against a\nwall.\n\nA moment later, another man in vaguely clerical robes entered and\nnodded to us. \"Now we go below,\" he ordered.\n\nBenedetto and I flanked Zorchi and carried him, an arm around each\nof our necks. We followed the sexton, or whatever he was, back into\nthe church, before the altar--Benedetto automatically genuflected\nwith the others, nearly making me spill Zorchi onto the floor--to a\ntapestry-hung door. He pushed aside the tapestry, and a cool, musty\ndraft came up from darkness.\n\nThe sexton lit a taper with a pocket cigarette lighter and led us down\nwinding, rickety steps. There was no one left in the church to notice\nus; if anyone had walked in, we were tourists, doing as countless\nmillions of tourists had done before us over the centuries.\n\nWe were visiting the Catacombs.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAround us were the bones of the Christians of a very different Rome.\nRena had told me about them: How they rambled under the modern city,\nthe only entrances where churches had been built over them. How they\nhad been nearly untouched for two thousand years. I even felt a little\nas though I really were a tourist as we descended, she had made me that\ncurious to see them.\n\nBut I was disappointed. We lugged the muttering Zorchi through the\nnarrow, musty corridors, with the bones of martyrs at our elbows, in\nthe flickering light of the taper, and I had the curious feeling that I\nhad been there before.\n\nAs, in a way, I had: I had been in the vaults of the Company's clinic\nat Anzio, in some ways very closely resembling these Catacombs--\n\nEven to the bones of the martyrs.\n\nI was almost expecting to see plastic sacks.\n\nWe picked our way through the warrens for several minutes, turning this\nway and that. I was lost in the first minute. Then the sexton stopped\nbefore a flat stone that had a crude, faded sketch of a fish on it;\nhe leaned on it, and the stone discovered itself to be a door. We\nfollowed him through it into a metal-walled, high-ceilinged tunnel,\nutterly unlike the meandering Catacombs. I began to hear sounds; we\nwent through another door, and light struck at our eyes.\n\nI blinked and focused on a long room, half a dozen yards wide, almost\nas tall, at least fifty yards long. It appeared to be a section of an\nenormous tunnel; it appeared to be, and it was. Benedetto and I set\nZorchi--still cursing--down on the floor and stared around.\n\nThere were people in the tunnel, dozens of them. There were desks and\ntables and file cabinets; it looked almost like any branch of the\nCompany, with whirring mimeographs and clattering typewriters.\n\nThe sexton pinched out the taper and dropped it on the floor, as people\ncame toward us.\n\n\"So now you are in our headquarters in Rome,\" said the man dressed as a\nsexton. \"It is good to see you again, Benedetto.\"\n\n\"And it is much better to see you, Slovetski,\" the old man answered\nwarmly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis man Slovetski--I do not think I can say what he looked like.\n\nHe was, I found, the very leader of the \"friends,\" the monarch of this\nunderground headquarters. But he was a far cry from the image I had\nformed of a bearded agitator. There was a hint of something bright and\nfearful in his eyes, but his voice was warm and deep, his manner was\nreassuring, his face was friendly. Still--there was that cat-spark in\nhis eyes.\n\nSlovetski, that first day, gave me an hour of his time. He answered\nsome of my questions--not all. The ones he smiled at, and shook his\nhead, were about numbers and people. The ones he answered were about\nprinciples and things.\n\nHe would tell me, for instance, what he thought of the\nCompany--endlessly. But he wouldn't say how many persons in the world\nwere his followers. He wouldn't name any of the persons who were all\naround us. But he gladly told me about the place itself.\n\n\"History, Mr. Wills,\" he said politely. \"History tells a man everything\nhe needs to know. You look in the books, and you will learn of\nMussolini, when this peninsula was all one state; he lived in Rome,\nand he started a subway. The archives even have maps. It is almost all\nabandoned now. Most of it was never finished. But the shafts are here,\nand the wiring that lights us still comes from the electric mains.\"\n\n\"And the only entrance is through the Catacombs?\"\n\nThe spark gleamed bright in his eye for a second. Then he shrugged.\n\"Why shouldn't I tell you? No. There are several others, but they are\nnot all convenient.\" He chuckled. \"For instance, one goes through a\nstation on the part of the subway that is still in operation. But it\nwould not have done for you, you see; Rena could not have used it. It\ngoes through the gentlemen's washroom.\"\n\nWe chuckled, Slovetski and I. I liked him. He looked like what he once\nhad been: a history teacher in a Company school, somewhere in Europe.\nWe talked about History, and Civilization, and Mankind, and all the\nother capitalized subjects. He was very didactic and positive in what\nhe said, just like a history teacher. But he was understanding. He\nmade allowances for my background; he did not call me a fool. He was a\npatient monk instructing a novice in the mysteries of the order, and I\nwas at ease with him.\n\nBut there was still that spark in his eye.\n\nRena disappeared almost as soon as we were safely in the tunnels.\nBenedetto was around, but he was as busy as Slovetski, and just as\nmysterious about what occupied him. So I had for company Zorchi.\n\nWe had lunch. \"Food!\" he said, and the word was an epithet. \"They offer\nthis to me for food! For pigs, Weels. Not for Zorchi!\" He pushed the\nplate away from him and stared morosely at the table.\n\nWe were given a room to share, and one of Slovetski's men fixed up a\nrope-and-pulley affair so Zorchi could climb into his bed unaided. He\nwas used to the help of a valet; the first time he tried it, he slipped\nand fell on the stumps of his legs. It must have hurt.\n\nHe shrieked, \"Assassins! All of them! They put me in a kennel with the\napprentice assassin, and the other assassins make a guillotine for me\nto kill myself on!\"\n\nWe had a long talk with Slovetski, on the ideals and principles of his\nmovement. Zorchi stared mutinously at the wall. I found the whole thing\nvery interesting--shocking, but interesting. But Zorchi was immune to\nshock--\"Perhaps it is news to you, Weels, that the Company is a big\nbeast?\"--and he was interested in nothing in all the world but Zorchi.\n\nBy the end of the second day I stopped talking to him entirely. It\nwasn't kind. He disliked me, but he hated everyone else in the tunnel,\nso he had no one to talk to. But it was either that or hit him in the\nface, and--although many of my mores had changed overnight--I still\ndid not think I could strike a man without legs.\n\nAnd besides, the less I saw of Zorchi, the more time I had to think\nabout Rena.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe returned on the third day, without a word of explanation to me of\nwhere she had been or what she had done. She greeted me and disappeared\nagain, this time only for hours. Then she came back and said, \"Now I am\nthrough, for a time. How have you liked our little hideaway?\"\n\nI said, \"It gets lonesome.\"\n\n\"Lonesome?\" Her brown eyes were wide and perfectly serious. \"I had\nthought it would be otherwise, Tom. So many of us in this little space,\nhow could you be lonesome?\"\n\nI took her hand. \"I'm not lonesome now,\" I told her. We found a place\nto sit in a corner of the communal dining hall. Around us the life of\nthe underground movement buzzed and swirled. It was much like a branch\nof the Company, as I have said; the work of this secret section seemed\nto be mostly a record-keeping depot for the activities that took place\non the surface. But no one paid much attention to Rena and me.\n\nWhat did we talk about? What couples have always talked about: Each\nother, and everything, and nothing. The only thing we did _not_ talk\nabout was my basic beliefs in regard to the Company. For I was too\ntroubled in my mind to talk about them, and Rena sensitive enough not\nto bring them up.\n\nFor I had, with all honor, sworn an oath of allegiance to the Company;\nand I had not kept it.\n\nI could not, even then, see any possibility of a world where the\nCompany did not exist. For what the Company said of itself was true:\nBefore the Company existed, men lived like beasts. There was always the\ninstant danger of war and disease. No plan could be made, no hope could\nbe held, that could not be wiped out by blind accident.\n\nAnd yet, were men better off today? I could not doubt the truths I\nhad been told. The Company permitted wars--I had seen it. The Company\npermitted disease--my own wife had died.\n\nSomewhere there was an answer, but I couldn't find it. It was not, I\nwas sure, in Slovetski's burning hatred of everything the Company stood\nfor. But it could not be, either, in the unquestioning belief that I\nhad once given.\n\nBut my views, it turned out, hardly mattered any more; the die was\ncast. Benedetto appeared in the entrance to the dining hall, peering\nabout. He saw us and came over, his face grave.\n\n\"I am sorry, Mr. Wills,\" he said. \"I have been listening to Radio\nNapoli. It has just come over the air: A description of you, and an\norder for your arrest. The charge is--murder!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI gaped at him, hardly believing. \"Murder! But that's not true; I\ncertainly never--\"\n\nBenedetto laid a hand on my shoulder. \"Of course not, Mr. Wills. It is\na fiction of the Company's, beyond doubt. But it is a fiction that may\ncause your death if you are discovered, do not doubt that.\"\n\nI swallowed. \"Who--whom did I murder?\"\n\nBenedetto shrugged. \"I do not know who he is. The name they gave was\nElio Barletteria.\"\n\nThat was the suspendee whose place Zorchi had usurped. I sat back,\nbewildered. It was true, at least, that I had had some connection with\nthe man. But--kill him? Was it possible, I asked myself, that the\nmere act of taking him out of his plastic sack endangered his life? I\ndoubted it, but still--\n\nI asked Benedetto. He frowned. \"It is--possible,\" he admitted at last.\n\"We do not know much about the suspendees, Mr. Wills. The Company has\nseen to that. It is my opinion--only an opinion, I am afraid--that\nif this man Barletteria is dead, it had nothing to do with anything\nyou did. Still--\" he shrugged--\"what difference does it make? If the\nCompany calls you a murderer, you must be one, for the Company is\nalways right. Is that not so?\"\n\nWe left it at that, but I was far from easy in my mind. The dining\nhall filled, and we ate our evening meal, but I hardly noticed what\nI ate and I took no part in the conversation. Rena and her father\nconsiderately left me alone; Zorchi was, it seemed, sulking in our\nroom, for he did not appear. But I was not concerned with him, for I\nhad troubles of my own. I should have been....\n\nAfter dinner was over, I excused myself and went to the tiny cubicle\nthat had been assigned to Zorchi and myself. He wasn't there. Then I\nbegan to think: Would Zorchi miss a meal?\n\nThe answer was unquestionably no. With his metabolism, he needed many\ntimes the food of an ordinary person; his performance at table, in\nfact, was spectacular.\n\nSomething was wrong. I was shaken out of my self-absorption; I hurried\nto find Benedetto dell'Angela, and told him that Zorchi was gone.\n\nIt didn't take long for us to find the answer. The underground hideout\nwas not large; it had only so many exits. It was only a matter of\nmoments before one of the men Benedetto had ordered to search returned\nwith an alarmed expression.\n\nThe exit that led through the subway station was ajar. Somehow Zorchi\nhad hitched himself, on his stumps, down the long corridor and out the\nexit. It had to be while we were eating; he could never have made it\nexcept when everyone was in one room.\n\nHow he had done it did not matter. The fact remained that Zorchi was\ngone and, with him, the secrecy of our hiding place.\n\n\nX\n\nWe had to move. There was no way out of it.\n\n\"Zorchi hates the Company,\" I protested. \"I don't think he'll go to\nthem and--\"\n\n\"No, Wills.\" Slovetski patiently shook his head. \"We can't take a\nchance. If we had been able to recapture him, then we could stay\nhere. But he got clean away.\" There was admiration in his eyes. \"What\na conspirator he would have made! Such strength and determination!\nThink of it, Wills, a legless man in the city of Rome. He cannot avoid\nattracting attention. He can barely move by himself. And yet, our men\ntrack him into the subway station, to a telephone ... and that is\nall. Someone picks him up. Who? A friend, one supposes--certainly not\nthe Company, or they would have been here before this. But to act so\nquickly, Wills!\"\n\nBenedetto dell'Angela coughed. \"Perhaps more to the point, Slovetski,\nis how quickly we ourselves shall now act.\"\n\nSlovetski grinned. \"All is ready,\" he promised. \"See, evacuation\nalready has begun!\"\n\nGroups of men were quickly placing file folders into cartons and\ncarrying them off. They were not going far, I found later, only to a\ndeserted section of the ancient Roman Catacombs, from which they could\nbe retrieved and transported, little by little, at a later date.\n\nBy sundown, Rena and I were standing outside the little church which\ncontained the entrance to the Catacombs. The two of us went together;\nonly two. It would look quite normal, it was agreed, for a young man\nand a girl to travel together, particularly after my complexion had\nbeen suitably stained and my Company clothes discarded and replaced\nwith a set of Rome's best ready-to-wears.\n\nIt did not occur to me at the time, but Rena must have known that\nher own safety was made precarious by being with me. Rena alone had\nnothing to fear, even if she had been caught and questioned by an\nagent of the Company. They would suspect her, because of her father,\nbut suspicion would do her no harm. But Rena in the company of a wanted\n\"murderer\"--and one traveling in disguise--was far less safe....\n\nWe found an ancient piston-driven cab and threaded through almost all\nof Rome. We spun around the ancient stone hulk of the Colosseum,\npassed the balcony where a sign stated the dictator, Mussolini, used to\nharangue the crowds, and climbed a winding, expensive-looking street to\nthe Borghese Gardens.\n\nRena consulted her watch. \"We're early,\" she said. We had _gelati_ in\nan open-air pavilion, listening to the wheezing of a sweating band;\nthen, in the twilight, we wandered hand in hand under trees for half an\nhour.\n\nThen Rena said, \"Now it is time.\" We walked to the far end of the\nGardens where a small copter-field served the Class-A residential area\nof Rome. A dozen copters were lined up at the end of the take-off\nhardstand. Rena led me to the nearest of them.\n\nI looked at it casually, and stopped dead.\n\n\"Rena!\" I whispered violently. \"Watch out!\" The copter was black and\npurple; it bore on its flank the marking of the Swiss Guard, the Roman\npolice force.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe pressed my hand. \"Poor Tom,\" she said. She walked boldly up to one\nof the officers lounging beside the copter and spoke briefly to him,\ntoo low for me to hear.\n\nIt was only when the big vanes overhead had sucked us a hundred yards\ninto the air, and we were leveling off and heading south, that she\nsaid: \"These are friends too, you see. Does it surprise you?\"\n\nI swallowed, staring at the hissing jets at the ends of the swirling\nvanes. \"Well,\" I said, \"I'm not exactly _surprised_, but I thought that\nyour friends were, well, more likely to be--\"\n\n\"To be rabble?\" I started to protest, but she was not angry. She was\nlooking at me with gentle amusement. \"Still you believe, Tom. Deep\ninside you: An enemy of the Company must be, at the best, a silly\nzealot like my father and me--and at the worst, rabble.\" She laughed\nas I started to answer her. \"No, Tom, if you are right, you should not\ndeny it; and if you are wrong--you will see.\"\n\nI sat back and stared, disgruntled, at the purple sunset over the\nMediterranean. I never saw such a girl for taking the wind out of your\nsails.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOnce across the border, the Guards had no status, and it was necessary\nfor them to swing inland, threading through mountains and passes,\nremaining as inconspicuous as possible.\n\nIt was little more than an hour's flight until I found landmarks I\ncould recognize. To our right was the bright bowl of Naples; far to our\nleft, the eerie glow that, marked bombed-out New Caserta. And ahead,\nbarely visible, the faint glowing plume that hung over Mount Vesuvius.\n\nNeither Rena nor the Guards spoke, but I could feel in their tense\nattitudes that this was the danger-point. We were in the lair of the\nenemy. Undoubtedly we were being followed in a hundred radars, and the\nfrequency-pattern would reveal our copter for what it was--a Roman\npolice plane that had no business in that area. Even if the Company let\nus pass, there was always the chance that some Neapolitan radarman,\nmore efficient, or more anxious for a promotion, than his peers would\nalert an interceptor and order us down. Certainly, in the old days,\ninterception would have been inevitable; for Naples had just completed\na war, and only short weeks back an unidentified aircraft would have\nbeen blasted out of the sky.\n\nBut we were ignored.\n\nAnd that, I thought to myself, was another facet to the paradox. For\nwhen, in all the world's years before these days of the Company, was\nthere such complacency, such deep-rooted security, that a nation just\nout of a war should have soothed its combat-jangled nerves overnight?\nPerhaps the Company had not ended wars. But the _fear_ of wars was\nutterly gone.\n\nWe fluttered once around the volcano, and dipped in to a landing on a\ngentle hump of earth halfway up its slope, facing Naples and the Bay.\nWe were a few hundred yards from a cluster of buildings--perhaps a\ndozen, in all.\n\nI jumped out, stumbling and recovering myself. Rena stepped lightly\ninto my arms. And without a word, the Guards fed fuel to the jets, the\nrotor whirled, and the copter lifted away from us and was gone.\n\nRena peered about us, getting her bearings. There was a sliver of\na moon in the eastern sky, enough light to make it possible to get\nabout. She pointed to a dark hulk of a building far up the slope. \"The\nObservatory. Come, Tom.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe volcanic soil was rich, but not very useful to farmers. It was not\nonly the question of an eruption of the cone, for that sort of hazard\nwas no different in kind than the risk of hailstorm or drought. But the\nmountain sides did not till easily, its volcanic slopes being perhaps\nsteeper than those of most mountains.\n\nThe ground under our feet had never been in cultivation. It was pitted\nand rough, and grown up in a tangle of unfamiliar weeds. And it was\nalso, I discovered with considerable shock, warm to the touch.\n\nI saw a plume of vapor, faintly silver in the weak light, hovering over\na hummock. Mist, I thought. Then it occurred to me that there was too\nmuch wind for mist. It was steam! I touched the soil. Blood heat, at\nleast.\n\nI said, with some difficulty, \"Rena, look!\"\n\nShe laughed. \"Oh, it is an eruption, Tom. Of course it is. But not a\nnew one. It is lava, you see, from the little blast the Sicilians\ntouched off. Do not worry about it....\"\n\nWe clambered over the slippery cogs of a funicular railway and circled\nthe ancient stone base of the building she had pointed to. There was no\nlight visible; but Rena found a small door, rapped on it and presently\nit opened.\n\nOut of the darkness came Slovetski's voice: \"Welcome.\"\n\nOnce this building had been the Royal Vulcanological Observatory of the\nKingdom of Italy. Now it was a museum on the surface, and underneath\nanother of the hideouts of Rena's \"friends.\"\n\nBut this was a hideout somewhat more important than the one in the\nRoman Catacombs, I found. Slovetski made no bones about it.\n\nHe said, \"Wills, you shouldn't be here. We don't know you. We can't\ntrust you.\" He held up a hand. \"I know that you rescued dell'Angela.\nBut that could all be an involved scheme of the Company. You could be\na Company spy. You wouldn't be the first, Wills. And this particular\ninstallation is, shall I say, important. You may even find why, though\nI hope not. If we hadn't had to move so rapidly, you would never have\nbeen brought here. Now you're here, though, and we'll make the best of\nit.\" He looked at me carefully, then, and the glinting spark in the\nback of his eyes flared wickedly for a moment. \"Don't try to leave. And\ndon't go anywhere in this building where Rena or dell'Angela or I don't\ntake you.\"\n\nAnd that was that. I found myself assigned to the usual sort\nof sleeping accommodations I had come to expect in this group.\nUnderground--cramped--and a bed harder than the Class-C Blue Heaven\nminimum.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe next morning, Rena breakfasted with me, just the two of us in a\ntower room looking down over the round slope of Vesuvius and the Bay\nbeneath. She said: \"The museum has been closed since the bomb landed\nnear, so you can roam around the exhibits if you wish. There are a\ncouple of caretakers, but they're with us. The rest of us will be in\nconference. I'll try to see you for lunch.\"\n\nAnd she conducted me to an upper level of the Observatory and left me\nby myself. I had my orders--stay in the public area of the museum. I\ndidn't like them. I wasn't used to being treated like a small boy, left\nby his mother in a Company day nursery while she busied herself with\nthe important and incomprehensible affairs of adults.\n\nStill, the museum was interesting enough, in a way. It had been\ntaken over by the Company, it appeared, and although the legend\nfrescoed around the main gallery indicated that it was supposed to\nbe a historical museum of the Principality of Naples, it appeared by\nexamination of the exhibits that the \"history\" involved was that of\nNaples vis-a-vis the Company.\n\nNot, of course, that such an approach was entirely unfair. If it had\nnot been for the intervention of the Company, after the Short War, it\nis more than possible that Naples as an independent state would never\nhave existed.\n\nIt was the Company's insistence on the dismantling of power centers (as\nMillen Carmody himself had described it) that had created Naples and\nSicily and Prague and Quebec and Baja California and all the others.\n\nOnly the United States had been left alone--and that, I think, only\nbecause nobody dared to operate on a wounded tiger. In the temper\nof the nation after the Short War, the Company would have survived\nless than a minute if it had proposed severing any of the fifty-one\nstates....\n\nThe museum was interesting enough, for anyone with a taste for horrors.\nIt showed the changes in Neapolitan life over the past century or so.\nThere was a reconstruction of a typical Neapolitan home of the early\nNineteen-forties: a squalid hovel, packed ten persons to the room,\nwith an American G.I., precursor of the Company expediters, spraying\nDDT into the bedding. There was, by comparison, a typical Class-B Blue\nHeaven modern allotment--with a certain amount of poetic license; few\nClass-B homes really had polyscent showers and auto-cooks.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was the section on warfare, however, that was most impressive. It\nwas in the far back of the building, in a large chamber anchored to\nbedrock. It held a frightening display of weapons, from a Tiger Tank\nto a gas-gun. Bulking over everything else in the room, even the tank,\nwas the thirty-foot height of a Hell-bomb in a four-story display. I\nlooked at it a second time, vaguely disturbed by something I hadn't\nquite placed--an indigo gleam to the metal of the warhead, with a hint\nof evil under its lacquered sheen....\n\nIt was cobalt. I bent to read the legend: _This is the casing of the\nactual cobalt bomb that would have been used on Washington if the Short\nWar had lasted one more day. It is calculated that, loaded with a Mark\nXII hydrogen-lithium bomb, sufficient radioactive Cobalt-60 would have\nbeen transmuted to end all life on Earth within thirty days._\n\nI looked at it again, shuddering.\n\nOh, it was safe enough now. Until the hydrogen reaction could turn the\nordinary cobalt sheathing into the deadly isotope-60, it was just such\nstuff as was used to alloy magnets and make cobalt glass. It was even\nmore valuable as a museum piece than as the highly purified metal.\n\nScore one for the Company. They'd put a stop to that danger. Nobody\nwould have a chance to arm it and send it off now. No small war would\nfind it more useful than the bomb it would need--and no principality\nwould risk the Company's wrath in using it. And while the conspiracy\nmight have planes and helicopters, the fissionable material was too\nrigidly under Company control for them to have a chance. The Super\nHell-bomb would never go off. And that was something that might mean\nmore to the Company's credit than anything else.\n\nMaybe it was possible that in this controversy _both_ sides were right.\nAnd, of course, there was the obvious corollary.\n\nI continued my wandering, looking at the exhibits, the rubble of the\nmuseum's previous history. The cast of the Pompeiian gladiator, caught\nby the cinder-fall in full flight, his straining body reproduced to\nevery contorted line by the incandescent ashes that had encased him.\nThe carefully chipped and labeled samples from the lava flows of the\npast two centuries. The awe-inspiring photographs of Vesuvius in\neruption.\n\nBut something about the bomb casing kept bothering me. I wandered\naround a bit longer and then turned back to the main exhibit. The big\ncasing stretched upward and downward, with narrow stairs leading down\nto the lower level at its base. It was on the staircase I'd noticed\nsomething before. Now I hesitated, trying to spot whatever it was.\nThere was a hint of something down there. Finally, I shrugged and went\ndown to inspect it more closely.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLying at the base was a heavy radiation glove. A used, workman's glove,\ndirty with grease. And as my eyes darted up, I could see that the bolts\non the lower servicing hatches were half-unscrewed.\n\nRadiation gloves and tampering with the casing!\n\nThere were two doors to the pit for the bomb casing, but either one was\nbetter than risking the stairs again where someone might see me. Or so\nI figured. If they found I'd learned anything....\n\nI grabbed for the nearer door, threw it open. I knew it was a mistake\nwhen the voice reached my ears.\n\n\"--after hitting the Home office with a Thousand-kiloton bomb.\nIt's going to take fast work. Now the schedule I've figured out so\nfar--God's damnation! How did you get in here, Wills?\"\n\nIt was Slovetski, leaning across a table, staring at me. Around the\ntable were Benedetto and four or five others I did not recognize. All\nof them looked at me as though I were the Antichrist, popped out of the\nmarble at St. Peter's Basilica on Easter Sunday.\n\nThe spark was a raging flame in Slovetski's eyes. Benedetto dell'Angela\nsaid sharply, \"Wait!\" He strode over to me, half shielding me from\nSlovetski. \"Explain this, Thomas,\" he demanded.\n\n\"I thought this was the hall door,\" I stammered, spilling the first\nwords I could while I tried to find any excuse....\n\n\"Wills! I tell you, answer me!\"\n\nI said, \"Look, did you expect me to carry a bell and cry unclean? I\ndidn't mean to break in. I'll go at once....\"\n\nIn a voice that shook, Slovetski said: \"Wait one moment.\" He pressed a\nbell-button on the wall; we all stood there silent, the five of them\nstaring at me, me wishing I was dead.\n\nThere was a patter of feet outside, and Rena peered in. She saw me and\nher hand went to her heart.\n\n\"Tom! But--\"\n\nSlovetski said commandingly, \"Why did you permit him his liberty?\"\n\nRena looked at him wide-eyed. \"But, please, I asked you. You suggested\nletting him study the exhibits.\"\n\nBenedetto nodded. \"True, Slovetski,\" he said gravely. \"You ordered her\nto attend until our--conference was over.\"\n\nThe flame surged wildly in Slovetski's eyes--not at me. But he got it\nunder control. He said, \"Take him away.\" He did not do me the courtesy\nof looking my way again. Rena took me by the hand and led me off,\nclosing the door behind us.\n\nAs soon as we were outside, I heard a sharp babble of argument, but\nI could make out no words through the door. I didn't need to; I knew\nexactly what they were saying.\n\nThis was the proposition: _Resolved, that the easiest thing to do is\nput Wills out of the way permanently_. And with Slovetski's fiery eyes\nurging the positive, what eager debater would say him nay?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRena said: \"I can't tell you, Tom. _Please_ don't ask me!\"\n\nI said, \"This is no kid's game, Rena! They're talking about bombing the\nHome Office!\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"Tom, Tom. You must have misunderstood.\"\n\n\"I heard them!\"\n\n\"Tom, _please_ don't ask me any more questions.\"\n\nI slammed my hand down on the table and swore. It didn't do any good.\nShe didn't even look up from the remains of her dinner.\n\nIt had been like that all afternoon. The Great Ones brooded in secret.\nRena and I waited in her room, until the museum's public visiting hours\nwere over and we could go up into the freer atmosphere of the reception\nlounge. And then we waited there.\n\nI said mulishly: \"Ever since I met you, Rena, I've been doing nothing\nbut wait. I'm not built that way!\"\n\nNo answer.\n\nI said, with all of my patience: \"Rena, I heard them talking about\nbombing the Home Office. Do you think I am going to forget that?\"\n\nLeadenly: \"No, Tom.\"\n\n\"So what does it matter if you tell me more? If I cannot be trusted, I\nalready know too much. If I can be trusted, what does it matter if I\nknow the rest?\"\n\nAgain tears. \"_Please_ don't ask me!\"\n\nI yelled: \"At least you can tell me what we're waiting for!\"\n\nShe dabbed at her eyes. \"Please, Tom, I don't know much more than you\ndo. Slovetski, he is like this sometimes. He gets, I suppose you would\nsay, thoughtful. He concentrates so very much on one thing, you see,\nthat he forgets everything around him. It is possible that he has\nforgotten that we are waiting. I don't know.\"\n\nI snarled, \"I'm tired of this. Go in and remind him!\"\n\n\"No, Tom!\" There was fright in her voice; and I found that she had told\nme one of the things I wanted to know. If it was not wise to remind\nSlovetski that I was waiting his pleasure, the probability was that it\nwould not be pleasant for me when he remembered.\n\nI said, \"But you must know something, Rena. Don't you see that it could\ndo no harm to tell me?\"\n\nShe said miserably, \"Tom, I know very little. I did not--did not know\nas much as you found out.\" I stared at her. She nodded. \"I had perhaps\na suspicion, it is true. Yes, I suspected. But I did not _really_\nthink, Tom, that there was a question of bombing. It is not how we were\ntaught. It is not what Slovetski promised, when we began.\"\n\n\"You mean you didn't know Slovetski was planning violence?\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"And even now, I think, perhaps you heard wrong,\nperhaps there was a mistake.\"\n\nI stood up and leaned over her. \"Rena, listen to me. There was no\nmistake. They're working on that casing. Tell me what you know!\"\n\nShe shook her head, weeping freely.\n\nI raged: \"This is asinine! What can there be that you will not tell?\nThe Company supply base that Slovetski hopes to raid to get a bomb?\nThe officers he plans to bribe, to divert some other nation's quota of\nplutonium?\"\n\nShe took a deep breath. \"Not that, Tom.\"\n\n\"Then what? You don't mean to say that he has a complete underground\nseparator plant--that he is making his own plutonium!\"\n\nShe was silent for a long time, looking at me. Then she sighed. \"I will\ntell you, Tom. No, he does not have a plant. He doesn't need one, you\nsee. He already has a bomb.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI straightened. \"That's impossible.\"\n\nShe was shaking her head. I protested, \"But the--the _quotas_, Rena.\nThe Company tracks every milligram of fissionable material from the\nmoment it leaves the reactor! The inspections! Expediters with Geiger\ncounters cover every city in the world!\"\n\n\"Not here, Tom. You remember that the Sicilians bombed Vesuvius? There\nis a high level of radioactivity all up and down the mountain. Not\nenough to be dangerous, but enough to mask a buried bomb.\" She closed\nher eyes. \"And--well, you are right, Tom. I might as well tell you.\nIn that same war, you see, there was a bomb that did not explode. You\nrecall?\"\n\n\"Yes, but--\"\n\n\"But it couldn't explode, Tom. It was a dummy. Slovetski is a brilliant\nman. Before that bomb left the ground, he had diverted it. What went\nup was a hollow shell. What is left--the heart of the bomb--is buried\nforty feet beneath us.\"\n\nI stared at her, the room reeling. I was clutching at straws. I\nwhispered, \"But that was only a fission bomb, Rena. Slovetski--I heard\nhim--he said a Thousand-kiloton bomb. That means hydrogen, don't you\nsee? Surely he hasn't tucked one of those away.\"\n\nRena's face was an agony of regret. \"I do not understand all these\nthings, so you must bear with me. I know this; there has been secret\ntalk about the Milanese generators, and I know that the talk has to\ndo with heavy water. And I am not stupid altogether, I know that from\nheavy water one can get what is used in a hydrogen bomb. And there is\nmore, of course--lithium, perhaps? But he has that. You have seen it, I\nthink. It is on a pedestal in this building.\"\n\nI sat down hard. It was impossible. But it all fell into place.\nGiven the fissionable core of the bomb--plus the deuterium, plus the\nlithium-bearing shell--it was no great feat to put the parts together\nand make a Hell-bomb.\n\nThe mind rejected it; it was too fantastic. It was frightful and\nterrifying, and worst of all was that something lurking at the\nthreshold of memory, something about that bomb on display in the\nmuseum....\n\nAnd, of course, I remembered.\n\n\"Rena!\" I said, struggling for breath. I nearly could not go on, it was\ntoo dreadful to say. \"Rena! Have you ever looked at that bomb? Have you\nread the placard on it? _That bomb is cobalt!_\"\n\n\nXI\n\nFrom the moment I had heard those piercing words from Slovetski's\nmouth, I had been obsessed with a vision. A Hell-bomb on the Home\nOffice. America's eastern seaboard split open. New York a hole in the\nocean, from Kingston to Sandy Hook; orange flames spreading across\nConnecticut and the Pennsylvania corner.\n\nThat was gone--and in its place was something worse.\n\nRadiocobalt bombing wouldn't simply kill locally by a gout of flaring\nradiation. It would leave the atmosphere filled with colloidal\nparticles of deadly, radioactive Cobalt-60. A little of that could be\nused to cure cancers and perform miracles. The amount released from\nthe sheathing of cobalt--normal, \"safe\" cobalt--around a fissioning\nhydrogen bomb could kill a world. A single bomb of that kind could wipe\nout all life on Earth, as I remembered my schooling.\n\nI'm no physicist; I didn't know what the quantities involved might\nmean, once the equations came off the drafting paper and settled like\na ravening storm on the human race. But I had a glimpse of radioactive\ndust in every breeze, in every corner of every land. Perhaps a handful\nof persons in Cambodia or Vladivostok or Melbourne might live through\nit. But there was no question in my mind: If that bomb went off, it was\nthe end of our civilization.\n\nI saw it clearly.\n\nAnd so, having betrayed the Company to Slovetski's gang, I came full\ncircle.\n\nEven Judas betrayed only One.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGetting away from the Observatory was simple enough, with Rena shocked\nand confused enough to look the other way. Finding a telephone near\nMount Vesuvius was much harder.\n\nI was two miles from the mountain before I found what I was looking\nfor--a Blue Wing fully-automatic filling station. The electronic\nscanners clucked worriedly, as they searched for the car I should have\nbeen driving, and the policy-punching slot glowed red and receptive,\nwaiting for my order. I ignored them.\n\nWhat I wanted was inside the little unlocked building--A\nhushaphone-booth with vision attachment. The important thing was to\ntalk direct to Defoe and only to Defoe. In the vision screen, impedance\nmismatch would make the picture waver if there was anyone uninvited\nlistening in.\n\nBut I left the screen off while I put through my call. The office\nservo-operator (it was well after business hours) answered blandly, and\nI said: \"Connect me with Defoe, crash priority.\"\n\nIt was set to handle priority matters on a priority basis; there was\nneither fuss nor argument, though a persistent buzzing in the innards\nof the phone showed that, even while the robot was locating Defoe for\nme, it was double-checking the connection to find out why there was no\nvision on the screen.\n\nIt said briskly, \"Stand by, sir,\" and I was connected with Defoe's\nline--on a remote hookup with the hotel where he was staying, I\nguessed. I flicked the screen open.\n\nBut it wasn't Defoe on the other end of the line. It was Susan\nManchester, with that uncharacteristic, oddly efficient look she had\nshown at the vaults.\n\nShe said crisply, and not at all surprised: \"Tom Wills.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" I said, thinking quickly. Well, it didn't much matter.\nI should have realized that Defoe's secretary, howsoever temporary,\nwould be taking his calls. I said rapidly: \"Susan, I can't talk to you.\nIt has to be Defoe. Take my word for it, it's important. Please put him\non.\"\n\nShe gave me no more of an argument than the robot had.\n\nIn a second, Defoe was on the screen, and I put Susan out of my mind.\nShe must have said something to him, because the big, handsome face was\nunsurprised, though the eyes were contracted. \"Wills!\" he snapped. \"You\nfool! Where are you?\"\n\nI said, \"Mr. Defoe, I have to talk to you. It's a very urgent matter.\"\n\n\"Come in and do it, Wills! Not over the telephone.\"\n\nI shook my head. \"No, sir. I can't. It's too, well, risky.\"\n\n\"Risky for you, you mean!\" The words were icily disgusted. \"Wills, you\nhave betrayed me. No man ever got away with that. You're imposing on\nme, playing on my family loyalty to your dead wife, and I want to tell\nyou that you won't get away with it. There's a murder charge against\nyou, Wills! Come in and talk to me--or else the police will pick you up\nbefore noon.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI said with an effort, \"I don't mean to impose on any loyalty, but, in\ncommon decency, you ought to hear--\"\n\n\"Decency!\" His face was cold. \"You talk about decency! You and that\ndell'Angela traitor you joined. Decency! Wills, you're a disgrace to\nthe memory of a decent and honest woman like Marianna. I can only say\nthat I am glad--glad, do you hear me?--that she's dead and rid of you.\"\n\nI said, \"Wait a minute, Defoe! Leave Marianna out of this. I only--\"\n\n\"Don't interrupt me! God, to think a man I trusted should turn out to\nbe Judas himself! You animal, the Company has protected you from the\nday you were born, and you try to destroy it. Why, you pitiful idiot,\nyou aren't fit to associate with the dogs in the kennel of a decent\nhuman being!\"\n\nThere was more. Much, much more. It was a flow of abuse that paralyzed\nme, less because of what he said than because of who was saying it.\nSuave, competent Defoe, ranting at me like a wounded Gogarty! I\ncouldn't have been more astonished if the portrait of Millen Carmody\nhad whispered a bawdy joke from the frontispiece of the Handbook.\n\nI stood there, too amazed to be furious, listening to the tirade from\nthe midget image in the viewplate. It must have lasted for three or\nfour minutes; then, almost in mid-breath, Defoe glanced at something\noutside my range of vision, and stopped his stream of abuse. I started\nto cut in while I could, but he held up one hand quickly.\n\nHe smiled gently. Very calmly, as though he had not been damning me a\nmoment before, he said: \"I shall be very interested to hear what you\nhave to say.\"\n\nThat floored me. It took me a second to shake the cobwebs out of my\nbrain before I said waspishly, \"If you hadn't gone through all that\njabber, you would have heard it long ago.\"\n\nThe midget in the scanner shrugged urbanely. \"True,\" he conceded. \"But\nthen, Thomas, I wouldn't have had you.\"\n\nAnd he reached forward and clicked off the phone. Tricked! Tricked and\ntrapped! I cursed myself for stupidity. While he kept me on the line,\nthe call was being traced--there was no other explanation. And I had\nfallen for it!\n\nI slapped the door of the booth open and leaped out.\n\nI got perhaps ten feet from the booth.\n\nThen a rope dropped over my shoulders. Its noose yanked tight around my\narms, and I was being dragged up, kicking futilely. I caught a glimpse\nof the broad Latin faces gaping at me from below, then two men on a\nrope ladder had me.\n\nI was dragged in through the bottom hatch of a big helicopter with no\nmarkings. The hatch closed. Facing me was a lieutenant of expediters.\n\nThe two men tumbled in after me and reeled in the rope ladder, as the\ncopter dipped and swerved away. I let myself go limp as the rope was\nloosened around me; when my hands were free I made my bid.\n\nI leaped for the lieutenant; my fist caught him glancingly on the\nthroat, sending him reeling and choking backward. I grabbed for the\nhard-pellet gun at his hip--he was pawing at it--and we tumbled across\nthe floor.\n\nIt was, for one brief moment, a chance. I was no copter pilot, but the\ngun was all the pilot I'd need--if only I got it out.\n\nBut the expediters behind me were no amateurs. I ducked as the knotted\nend of the rope whipped savagely toward me. Then one of the other\nexpediters was on my back; the gun came out, and flew free. And that\nwas the end of that.\n\nI had, I knew, been a fool to try it. But I wasn't sorry. They had too\nmuch rough-and-tumble training for me to handle. But that one blow had\nfelt good.\n\nIt didn't seem as worth while a few moments later. I was fastened to a\nseat, while the wheezing lieutenant gave orders in a strangled voice.\n\"Not too many marks on him,\" he was saying. \"Try it over the kidneys\nagain....\"\n\nI never even thought of maintaining a heroic silence. They had had\nplenty of experience with the padded club, too, and I started to black\nout twice before finally I went all the way down.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI came to with a light shining in my eyes.\n\nThere was a doctor putting his equipment away. \"He'll be all right, Mr.\nDefoe,\" he said, and snapped his bag shut and left the circle of light.\n\nI felt terrible, but my head was clearing.\n\nI managed to focus my eyes. Defoe was there, and a couple of other\nmen. I recognized Gogarty, looking sick and dejected, and another\nface I knew--it was out of my Home Office training--an officer whose\nname I didn't recall, wearing the uniform of a lieutenant-general of\nexpediters. That meant at least an expediter corps in Naples!\n\nI said weakly, \"Hi.\"\n\nDefoe stood over me. He said, \"I'm very glad to see you, Thomas.\nCoffee?\"\n\nHe steadied my hands as I gulped it. When I had managed a few swallows,\nhe took the cup away.\n\n\"I did not think you would resist arrest, Thomas,\" he said in a\nparental tone.\n\nI said, \"Damn it, you didn't have to arrest me! I came down here of my\nown free will!\"\n\n\"Down?\" His eyebrows rose. \"Down from where do you mean, Thomas?\"\n\n\"Down from Mount--\" I hesitated, then finished. \"All right. Down from\nMount Vesuvius. The museum, where I was hiding out with the ringleaders\nof the anti-Company movement. Is that what you want to know?\"\n\nDefoe crackled: \"Manning!\" The lieutenant-general saluted and left the\nroom. Defoe said, \"That was the first thing I wanted, yes. But now I\nwant much more. Please begin talking, Thomas. I will listen.\"\n\nI talked. There was nothing to stop me. Even with my body a mass of\naches and pains from the tender care of the Company's expediters, I\nstill had to side with the Company in this. For the Cobalt-bomb ended\nall loyalties.\n\nI left nothing important out, not even Rena. I admitted that I had\ntaken Benedetto from the clinic, how we had escaped to Rome, how we had\nfled to Vesuvius ... and what I had learned. I made it short, skipping\na few unimportant things like Zorchi.\n\nAnd Defoe sat sipping his coffee, listening, his warm eyes twinkling.\n\nI stopped. He pursed his lips, considering.\n\n\"Silly,\" he said at last.\n\n\"Silly? What's silly!\"\n\nHe said, \"Thomas, I don't care about your casual affairs. And I would\nhave excused your--precipitousness--since you have brought back certain\nuseful information. Quite useful. I don't deny it. But I don't like\nbeing lied to, Thomas.\"\n\n\"I haven't lied!\"\n\nHe said sharply, \"There is no way to get fissionable material except\nthrough the Company!\"\n\n\"Oh, hell!\" I shook my head. \"How about a dud bomb, Defoe?\"\n\nFor the first time he looked puzzled. \"Dud bomb?\"\n\nGogarty looked sick. \"There's--there's a report on your desk, Mr.\nDefoe,\" he said worriedly. \"We--well--figured the half-masses just got\nclose enough to boil instead of to explode. We--\"\n\n\"I see.\" Defoe looked at him for a long moment. Then, disregarding\nGogarty, he turned back to me, shoved the coffee at me. \"All right,\nThomas. They've got the warhead. Hydrogen? Cobalt? What about fuel?\"\n\nI told him what I knew. Gogarty, listening, licked his lips. I didn't\nenvy him. I could see the worry in him, the fear of Defoe's later\nwrath. For in Defoe, as in Slovetski, there was that deadly fire.\nIt blazed only when it was allowed to; but what it touched withered\nand died. I had not seen Defoe as tightly concentrated, as drivingly\nintent, before. I was sorry for Gogarty when at last, having drained me\ndry, Defoe left. But I was glad for me.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was gone less than an hour--just time for me to eat a Class-C meal a\nsilent expediter brought.\n\nHe thrust the door open and stared at me with whitely glaring eyes.\n\"If I thought you were lying, Thomas ...\" His voice was cracking with\nsuppressed emotion.\n\n\"What happened?\" I demanded.\n\n\"Don't you know?\" He stood trembling, staring at me. \"You told the\ntruth--or part of the truth. There _was_ a hideout on Vesuvius. But an\nhour ago they got away--while you were wasting time. Was it a stall,\nThomas? Did you know they would run?\"\n\nI said, \"Defoe, don't you see, that's all to the good? If they had to\nrun, they couldn't possibly take the bomb with them. That means--\"\n\nHe was shaking head. \"Oh, but you're wrong, Thomas. According to the\ndirector of the albergo down the hill, three skyhook helicopters came\nover--big ones. They peeled the roof off, as easy as you please, and\nthey lifted the bomb out and then flew away.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI said stupidly, \"Where?\" He nodded. There was no emotion in his voice,\nonly in his eyes. He might have been discussing the weather. \"Where?\nThat is a good question. I hope we will find it out, Thomas. We're\nchecking the radar charts; they can't hide for long. But how did they\nget away at all? Why did you give them the time?\"\n\nHe left me. Perversely, I was almost glad. It was part of the price\nof switching allegiance, I was learning, that shreds and tatters of\nloyalties cling to you and carry over. When I went against the Company\nto rescue Benedetto, I still carried with me my Adjusters' Handbook.\nAnd I confess that I never lost the habit of reading a page or two\nin it, even in the Catacombs, when things looked bad. And when I saw\nthe murderous goal that Slovetski's men were marching toward, and I\nreturned to Defoe, I still could feel glad that Benedetto, at least,\nhad got away.\n\nBut not far.\n\nIt was only a few hours, but already broad daylight when Gogarty,\nlooking shaken, came into the room. He said testily, \"Damn it, Wills, I\nwish I'd never seen you! Come on! Defoe wants you with us.\"\n\n\"Come on where?\" I got up as he gestured furiously for haste.\n\n\"Where do you think? Did you think your pals would be able to stay out\nof sight forever? We've got them pinpointed, bomb and all.\"\n\nHe was almost dragging me down the corridor, toward a courtyard. I\nlimped out into the bright morning and blinked. The court was swarming\nwith armed expediters, clambering into personnel-carrying copters\nmarked with the vivid truce-team insignia of the Company. Gogarty\nhustled me into the nearest and the jets sizzled and we leaped into the\nair.\n\nI shouted, over the screaming of the jets, \"Where are we going?\"\n\nGogarty spat and pointed down the long purple coastline. \"To their\nhideout--Pompeii!\"\n\n\nXII\n\nNo one discussed tactics with me, but it was clear that this operation\nwas carefully planned. Our copter was second in a long string of at\nleast a dozen that whirled down the coastline, past the foothills of\nVesuvius, over the clusters of fishing villages and vineyards.\n\nI had never seen Pompeii, but I caught a glimpse of something\nglittering and needle-nosed, up-thrust in the middle of a cluster of\nstone buildings that might have been the ruins.\n\nThen the first ten of the copters spun down to a landing, while two or\nthree more flew a covering mission overhead.\n\nThe expediters, hard-pellet guns at the ready, leaped out and formed in\na skirmish line. Gogarty and a pair of expediters stayed close by me,\nbehind the line of attack; we followed the troops as they dog-trotted\nthrough a field of some sort of grain, around fresh excavations, down\na defile into the shallow pit that held the ruins of first-century\nPompeii.\n\nI had no time for archeology, but I remember tripping over wide,\nshallow gutters in the stone-paved streets, and cutting through a tiny\nvilla of some sort whose plaster walls still were decorated with faded\nfrescoes.\n\nThen we heard the spatter of gunfire and Gogarty, clutching at me,\nskidded to a halt. \"This is specialist work,\" he panted. \"Best thing we\ncan do is stay out of it.\"\n\nI peered around a column and saw a wide open stretch. Beyond it was a\nRoman arch and the ruined marble front of what once had been a temple\nof some sort; in the open ground lay the three gigantic copters Defoe\nhad mentioned.\n\nThe vanes of one of them were spinning slowly, and it lurched and\nquivered as someone tried to get it off the ground under fire. But\nthe big thing was in the middle of the area: The bomb, enormous and\nterrifying as its venomous nose thrust up into the sky. By its side was\na tank truck, the side of it painted with the undoubtedly untrue legend\nthat it contained crude olive oil. Hydrazine, more likely!\n\nHoses connected it with the base of the guided-missile bomb; and a knot\nof men were feverishly in action around it, some clawing desperately\nat the fittings of the bomb, some returning the skirmish fire of the\nexpediters.\n\nWe had the advantage of surprise, but not very much of that. From\nthe top of the ancient temple a rapid-fire pellet gun sprayed into\nthe flank of the skirmish line, which immediately broke up as the\nexpediters leaped for cover.\n\nOne man fell screaming out of the big skyhook copter, but someone\nremained inside, for it lurched and dipped and roared crazily across\nthe field in as ragged a take-off as I ever saw, until its pilot got\nit under control. It bobbed over the skirmish line under fire, but\nreturning the fire as whatever few persons were inside it leaned out\nand strafed the expediters. Then the skyhook itself came under attack\nas the patrol copters swooped in.\n\nThe big ship staggered toward the nearest of them. It must have been\nintentional: We could see the faint flare of muzzle-blast as the two\ncopters fired on each other; they closed, and there was a brutal\nrending noise as they collided. They were barely a hundred feet in the\nair; they crashed in a breath, and flames spread out from the wreckage.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd Slovetski's resources still had not run out. There was a roar and a\nscreech of metal, and a one-man cobra tank slithered out of one of the\nbuildings and came rapidly across the field toward the expediters.\n\nGogarty, beside me, was sobbing with fear; that little tank carried\nself-loading rockets. It blasted a tiny shrine into rubble, spun and\ncame directly toward us.\n\nWe ran. I didn't even see the second expediter aircraft come whirling\nin and put the cobra tank out of action with its heavy weapons. I heard\nthe firing, but it was swallowed up in a louder screaming roar.\n\nGogarty stared at me from the drainage trench we had flung ourselves\ninto. We both leaped up and ran back toward the open field.\n\nThere was an explosion as we got there--the fake \"olive-oil\" truck,\nnow twenty yards from the bomb, had gone up in a violent blast. But we\nhardly noticed. For at the base of the bomb itself red-purple fire was\nbillowing out. It screamed and howled and changed color to a blinding\nblue as the ugly squat shape danced and jiggled. The roar screamed\nup from a bull-bass to a shrieking coloratura and beyond as the bomb\nlifted and gained speed and, in the blink of an eye, was gone.\n\nI hardly noticed that the sound of gunfire died raggedly away. We were\nnot the only ones staring unbelievingly at the sky where that deadly\nshape had disappeared. Of the scores of men on both sides in that area,\nnot a single eye was anywhere else.\n\nThe bomb had been fueled; we were too late. Its servitors, perhaps at\nthe cost of their own lives, had torched it off. It was on its way.\n\nThe cobalt bomb--the single weapon that could poison the world and wipe\nout the human race--was on its way.\n\n\nXIII\n\nWhat can you do after the end? What becomes of any plot or plan, when\nan indigo-gleaming missile sprays murder into the sky and puts a period\nto planning?\n\nI do not think there ever was a battlefield as abruptly quiet as that\nsquare in old Pompeii. Once the bomb had gone, there was not a sound.\nThe men who had been firing on each other were standing still, jaws\nhanging, eyes on the sky.\n\nBut it couldn't last. For one man was not surprised; one man knew what\nwas happening and was ready for it.\n\nA crouching figure at the top of the ruined temple gesticulated and\nshouted through a power-megaphone: \"Give it up, Defoe! You've lost,\nyou've lost!\" It was Slovetski, and beside him a machine-gun crew\nsighted in on the nearest knot of expediters.\n\nPause, while the Universe waited. And then his answer came; it was a\nshot that screamed off a cracked capital, missing him by millimeters.\nHe dropped from sight, and the battle was raging.\n\nHuman beings are odd. Now that the cause of the fight was meaningless,\nit doubled in violence. There were fewer than a hundred of Slovetski's\nmen involved, and not much more than that many expediters. But for\nconcentrated violence I think they must have overmatched anything in\nthe Short War's ending.\n\nI was a non-combatant; but the zinging of the hard-pellet fire swarmed\nall around me. Gogarty, in his storm sewer, was safe enough, but I was\nmore exposed. While the rapid-fire weapons pattered all around me, I\njumped up and zigzagged for the shelter of a low-roofed building.\n\nThe walls were little enough protection, but at least I had the\nillusion of safety. Most of all, I was out of sight.\n\nI wormed my way through a gap in the wall to an inner chamber. It\nwas as tiny a room as ever I have been in; less than six feet in its\ngreatest dimension--length--and with most of its floor area taken up by\nwhat seemed to be a rude built-in bed. Claustrophobia hit me there; the\nwall on the other side was broken too, and I wriggled through.\n\nThe next room was larger; and it was occupied.\n\nA man lay, panting heavily, in a corner. He pushed himself up on\nan elbow to look at me. In a ragged voice he said: \"Thomas!\" And he\nslumped back, exhausted by the effort, blood dripping from his shirt.\n\nI leaped over to the side of Benedetto dell'Angela. The noise of the\nbattle outside rose to a high pitch and dwindled raggedly away.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI suppose it was inertia that kept me going--certainly I could see with\nmy mind's vision no reason to keep struggling. The world was at an\nend. There was no reason to try again to escape from the rubber hoses\nof the expediters--and, after I had seen the resistance end, and an\nexpediter-officer appeared atop the temple where Slovetski had shouted\nhis defiance, no possibility of rejoining the rebels.\n\nWithout Slovetski, they were lost.\n\nBut I kept on.\n\nBenedetto helped. He knew every snake-hole entrance and exit of all\nthe hideouts of Slovetski's group. They had not survived against the\nstrength of the Company without acquiring skill in escape routes; and\nhere, too, they had a way out. It required a risky dash across open\nground but, even with Benedetto on my back, I made it.\n\nAnd then we were in old Pompeii's drainage sewer, the arched stone\ntunnel that once had carried sewage from the Roman town to the sea. It\nwas a hiding place, and then a tunnel to freedom, for the two of us.\n\nWe waited there all of that day, Benedetto mumbling almost inaudibly\nbeside me. In lucid moments, he told me the name of the hotel where\nRena had gone when the Observatory was abandoned, but there seemed few\nlucid moments. Toward evening, he began to recover.\n\nWe found our way to the seashore just as darkness fell. There was a\nlateen-rigged fishing vessel of some sort left untended. I do not\nsuppose the owner was far away, but he did not return in time to stop\nus.\n\nBenedetto was very weak. He was muttering to himself, words that I\ncould hardly understand. \"Wasted, wasted, wasted,\" was the burden of\nhis complaint. I did not know what he thought was wasted--except,\nperhaps, the world.\n\nWe slipped in to one of the deserted wharves under cover of darkness,\nand I left Benedetto to find a phone. It was risky, but what risk\nmattered when the world was at an end?\n\nRena was waiting at the hotel. She answered at once. I did not think\nthe call had been intercepted--or that it would mean anything to anyone\nif it had. I went back to the boat to wait with Benedetto for Rena to\narrive, in a rented car. We didn't dare chance a cab.\n\nBenedetto was sitting up, propped rigidly against the mast, staring\noff across the water. Perhaps I startled him as I came to the boat; he\nturned awkwardly and cried out weakly.\n\nThen he saw that it was I. He said something I could not understand and\npointed out toward the west, where the Sun had gone down long before.\n\nBut there was still light there--though certainly not sunset.\n\nFar off over the horizon was a faint glow! I couldn't understand at\nfirst, since I was sure the bomb had been zeroed-in on the Home Offices\nin New York; but something must have happened. From that glow, still\nshowing in the darkness so many hours after the explosion as the dust\nparticles gleamed bluely, it must have gone off over the Atlantic.\n\nThere was no doubt in my mind any longer. The most deadly weapon the\nworld had ever known had gone off!\n\n\nXIV\n\nThe hotel was not safe, of course, but what place was when the world\nwas at an end? Rena and I, between us, got her father, Benedetto,\nupstairs into her room without attracting too much attention. We put\nhim on the bed and peeled back his jacket.\n\nThe bullet had gone into his shoulder, a few inches above the heart.\nThe bone was splintered, but the bleeding was not too much. Rena did\nwhat she could and, for the first time in what seemed like years, we\nhad a moment's breathing space.\n\nI said, \"I'll phone for a doctor.\"\n\nBenedetto said faintly, \"No, Thomas! The Company!\"\n\nI protested, \"What's the difference? We're all dead, now. You've\nseen--\" I hesitated and changed it. \"Slovetski has seen to that. There\nwas _cobalt_ in that bomb.\"\n\nHe peered curiously at me. \"Slovetski? Did you suppose it was Slovetski\nwho planned it so?\" He shook his head--and winced at the pain. He\nwhispered, \"Thomas, you do not understand. It was my project, not\nSlovetski's. That one, he proposed to destroy the Company's Home\nOffice; it was his thought that killing them would bring an end to\nevil. I persuaded him there was no need to kill--only to gamble.\"\n\nI stared at him. \"You're delirious!\"\n\n\"Oh, no.\" He shook his head and succeeded in a tiny smile. \"Do you not\nsee it, Thomas? The great explosion goes off, the world is showered\nwith particles of death. And then--what then?\"\n\n\"We die!\"\n\n\"Die? No! Have you forgotten the vaults of the clinics?\"\n\nIt staggered me. I'd been reciting all the pat phrases from early\nschooling about the bomb! If it had gone off in the Short War, of\ncourse, it would have ended the human race! But I'd been a fool.\n\nThe vaults had been built to handle the extreme emergencies that\ncouldn't be foreseen--even one that knocked out nearly the whole race.\nThey hadn't expected that a cobalt-cased bomb would ever be used. Only\nthe conspirators would have tried, and how could they get fissionables?\nBut they were ready for even that. I'd been expecting universal doom.\n\n\"The clinics,\" Benedetto repeated as I stared at him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was the answer. Even radio-poisons of cobalt do not live forever.\nFive years, and nearly half of them would be gone; eleven years, and\nmore than three-quarters would be dissipated. In fifty years, the\nresidual activity would be down to a fraction of one per cent--and the\nhuman race could come back to the surface.\n\n\"But why?\" I demanded. \"Suppose the Company can handle the population\nof the whole world? Granted, they've space enough and one year is the\nsame as fifty when you're on ice. But what's the use?\"\n\nHe smiled faintly. \"Bankruptcy, Thomas,\" he whispered. \"So you see, we\ndo not wish to fall into the Company's hands right now. For there is a\nchance that we will live ... and perhaps the very faintest of chances\nthat we will win!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt wasn't even a faint chance--I kept telling myself that.\n\nBut, if anything could hurt the Company, the area in which it was\nvulnerable was money. Benedetto had been intelligent in that. Bombing\nthe Home Office would have been an inconvenience, no more. But to\ndisrupt the world's work with a fifty-year hiatus, while the air purged\nitself of the radioactive cobalt from the bomb, would mean fifty years\nwhile the Company lay dormant; fifty years while the policies ran their\ncourse and became due.\n\nFor that was the wonder of Benedetto's scheme: _The Company insured\nagainst everything_. If a man were to be exposed to radiation and\nneeded to be put away, he automatically went on \"disability\" benefits,\nwhile his policy paid its own premiums!\n\nMultiply this single man by nearly four billion. The sum came out to a\nbankrupt Company.\n\nIt seemed a thin thread with which to strangle a monster. And yet,\nI thought of the picture of Millen Carmody in my Adjuster's Manual.\nThere was the embodiment of honor. Where a Defoe might cut through the\nlegalities and flout the letter of the agreements, Carmody would be\nbound by his given word. The question, then, was whether Defoe would\ndare to act against Carmody.\n\nEverything else made sense. Even exploding the bomb high over the\nAtlantic: It would be days before the first fall-out came wind-borne to\nthe land, and in those days there would be time for the beginnings of\nthe mass migration to the vaults.\n\nWait and see, I told myself. Wait and see. It was flimsy, but it was\nhope, and I had thought all hope was dead.\n\nWe could not stay in the hotel, and there was only one place for us to\ngo. Slovetski captured, the Company after our scalps, the whole world\nabout to be plunged into confusion--we had to get out of sight.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt took time. Zorchi's hospital gave me a clue; I tracked it down and\nlocated the secretary.\n\nThe secretary spat at me over the phone and hung up, but the second\ntime I called him he grudgingly consented to give me another number to\ncall. The new number was Zorchi's lawyer. The lawyer was opaque and\nuncommunicative, but proposed that I call him back in a quarter of an\nhour. In a quarter of an hour, I was on the phone. He said guardedly:\n\"What was left in Bay 100?\"\n\n\"A hypodermic and a bottle of fluid,\" I said promptly.\n\n\"That checks,\" he confirmed, and gave me a number.\n\nAnd on the other end of that number I reached Zorchi.\n\n\"The junior assassin,\" he sneered. \"And calling for help? How is that\npossible, Weels? Did my _avocatto_ lie?\"\n\nI said stiffly, \"If you don't want to help me, say so.\"\n\n\"Oh--\" he shrugged. \"I have not said that. What do you want?\"\n\n\"Food, a doctor, and a place for three of us to hide for a while.\"\n\nHe pursed his lips. \"To hide, is it?\" He frowned. \"That is very grave,\nWeels. Why should I hide you from what is undoubtedly your just\npunishment?\"\n\n\"Because,\" I said steadily, \"I have a telephone number. Which can be\ntraced. Defoe doesn't know you've escaped, but that can be fixed!\"\n\nHe laughed angrily. \"Oh-ho. The assassin turns to blackmail, is that\nit?\"\n\nI said furiously, \"Damn you, Zorchi, you know I won't turn you in. I\nonly point out that I can--and that I will not. Now, will you help us\nor not?\"\n\nHe said mildly, \"Oh, of course. I only wished you to say 'please'--but\nit is not a trick you Company men are good at. Signore, believe me,\nI perish with loneliness for you and your two friends, whoever they\nmay be. Listen to me, now.\" He gave me an address and directions for\nfinding it. And he hung up.\n\nZorchi's house was far outside the city, along the road to New Caserta.\nIt lay at the bend of the main highway, and I suppose I could have\npassed it a hundred thousand times without looking inside, it was\nso clearly the white-stuccoed, large but crumbling home of a mildly\nprosperous peasant. It was large enough to have a central court partly\nconcealed from the road.\n\nThe secretary, spectacles and all, met us at the door--and that was a\nshock. \"You must have roller skates,\" I told him.\n\nHe shrugged. \"My employer is too forgiving,\" he said, with ice on his\nvoice. \"I had hoped to reach him before he made an error. As you see, I\nwas too late.\"\n\nWe lifted Benedetto off the seat; he was just barely conscious by\nnow, and his face was ivory under the Mediterranean tan. I shook the\nsecretary off and held Benedetto carefully in my arms as Rena held the\ndoor before me.\n\nThe secretary said, \"A moment. I presume the car is stolen. You must\ndispose of it at once.\"\n\nI snarled over my shoulder, \"It isn't stolen, but the people that own\nit will be looking for it all right. _You_ get rid of it.\"\n\nHe spluttered and squirmed, but I saw him climbing into the seat\nas I went inside. Zorchi was there waiting, in a fancy motorized\nwheelchair. He had legs! Apparently they were not fully developed as\nyet, but in the short few days since I had rescued him _something_ had\ngrown that looked like nearly normal limbs. He had also grown, in that\nshort time, a heavy beard.\n\nThe sneer, however, was the same.\n\nI made the error of saying, \"Signore Zorchi, will you call a doctor for\nthis man?\"\n\nThe thick lips writhed under the beard. \"_Signore_ it is now, is it? No\nlonger the freak Zorchi, the case Zorchi, the half-man? God works many\nmiracles, Weels. See the greatest of them all--it has transmuted the\ndog into a _signore_!\"\n\nI grated, \"For God's sake, Zorchi, call a doctor!\"\n\nHe said coldly, \"You mentioned this over the phone, did you not? If you\nwould merely walk on instead of bickering, you would find the doctor\nalready here.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPlasma and antibiotics: They flowed into Benedetto from half a dozen\nplastic tubes like oil into the hold of a tanker. And I could see, in\nthe moments when I watched, the color come back into his face, and the\nsunken eyes seem to come back to life.\n\nThe doctor gave him a sedative that made him sleep, and explained to\nus that Benedetto was an old man for such goings-on. But if he could be\nkept still for three or four weeks, the doctor said, counting the lire\nZorchi's secretary paid him, there was no great danger.\n\nIf he could be kept still for three or four weeks. In scarcely ten\ndays, the atmosphere of the planet would be death to breathe! Many\nthings might happen to Benedetto in that time, but remaining still was\nnot one of them.\n\nZorchi retired to his own quarters, once the doctor was gone, and Rena\nand I left Benedetto to sleep.\n\nWe found a television set and turned it on, listening for word of\nthe cobalt-bomb. We got recorded _canzoni_ sung by a reedy tenor. We\ndialed, and found the Neapolitan equivalent of a soap opera, complete\nwith the wise, fat old mother and the sobbing new daughter-in-law. It\nwas like that on all the stations, while Rena and I stared at each\nother in disbelief.\n\nFinally, at the regular hourly newscast, we got a flicker: \"An\nunidentified explosion,\" the announcer was saying, \"far out at sea,\ncaused alarm to many persons last night. Although the origins are not\nknown, it is thought that there is no danger. However, there has been\ntemporary disturbance to all long-lines communications, and air travel\nis grounded while the explosion is being investigated.\"\n\nWe switched to the radio: it was true. Only the UHF television bands\nwere on the air.\n\nI said, \"I can't figure that. If there's enough disturbance to ruin\nlong-distance transmission, it ought to show up on the television.\"\n\nRena said doubtfully, \"I do not remember for sure, Tom, but is there\nnot something about television which limits its distance?\"\n\n\"Well--I suppose so, yes. It's a line of sight transmission, on these\nfrequencies at any rate. I don't suppose it has to be, except that all\nthe television bands fall in VHF or UHF channels.\"\n\n\"Yes. And then, is it not possible that only the distance transmission\nis interrupted? On purpose, I mean?\"\n\nI slammed my hand on the arm of the chair. \"On purpose! The\nCompany--they are trying to keep this thing localized. But the idiots,\ndon't they know that's impossible? Does Defoe think he can let the\nworld burn up without doing anything to stop it--just by keeping the\npeople from knowing what happened?\"\n\nShe shrugged. \"I don't know, Tom.\"\n\nI didn't know either, but I suspected--and so did she. It was out\nof the question that the Company, with its infinite resources, its\nnerve-fibers running into every part of the world, should not know just\nwhat that bomb was, and what it would do. And what few days the world\nhad--before the fall-out became dangerous--were none too many.\n\nAlready the word should have been spread, and the first groups alerted\nfor movement into the vaults, to wait out the day when the air would be\npure again. If it was being delayed, there could be no good reason for\nit.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe only reason was Defoe. But what, I asked myself miserably, was\nMillen Carmody doing all this while? Was he going to sit back and\nplacidly permit Defoe to pervert every ideal of the Company?\n\nI could not believe it. It was not possible that the man who had\nwritten the inspiring words in the Handbook could be guilty of genocide.\n\nRena excused herself to look in on her father. Almost ashamed of\nmyself, I took the battered book from my pocket and opened it to check\non Millen Carmody's own preface.\n\nIt was hard to reconcile the immensely reassuring words with what I had\nseen. And, as I read them, I no longer felt safe and comforted.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere seemed to be no immediate danger, and Rena needed to get out\nof that house. There was nothing for Benedetto to do but wait, and\nZorchi's servants could help him when it was necessary.\n\nI took her by the arm and we strolled out into the garden, breathing\ndeeply. That was a mistake. I had forgotten, in the inconspicuous air\nconditioning of Zorchi's home, that we were in the center of the hemp\nfields that had nearly cost me my dinner, so long ago, with Hammond.\nI wondered if I ever would know just why Hammond was killed. Playing\nboth ends against the middle, it seemed--he had undoubtedly been in\nwith Slovetski's group. Rena had admitted as much, and I was privately\ncertain that he had been killed by them.\n\nBut of more importance was the stench in our nostrils. \"Perhaps,\" said\nRena, \"across the road, in the walnut grove, it will not be as bad.\"\n\nI hesitated, but it felt safe in the warm Italian night, and so we\ntried it. The sharp scent of the walnut trees helped a little; what\nhelped even more was that the turbinates of the nostril can stand just\nso much, and when their tolerance is exceeded they surrender. So that\nit wasn't too long before, though the stench was as strong as ever, we\nhardly noticed it.\n\nWe sat against the thick trunk of a tree, and Rena's head fitted\nnaturally against my shoulder. She was silent for a time, and so was\nI--it seemed good to have silence, after violent struggle and death.\n\nThen she said: \"Strange man.\"\n\n\"Me?\"\n\n\"No. Oh, yes, Tom, if it comes to that, you, too. But I was thinking\njust now of Zorchi. Is it true, what you told me of his growing legs\nand arms so freely?\"\n\n\"I thought everyone in Naples knew that. I thought he was a national\nhero.\"\n\n\"Of course, but I have never really known that the stories were _true_.\nHow does it happen, Tom?\"\n\nI shrugged. \"Heaven knows, I don't. I doubt if even Zorchi knows. His\nparents might have been involved in some sort of atomic business and\ngot radiated, and so they produced a mutation. It's perfectly possible,\nyou know.\"\n\n\"I have heard so, Tom.\"\n\n\"Or else it just happened. Something in his diet, in the way his glands\nresponded to a sickness, some sort of medicine. No one knows.\"\n\n\"Cannot scientists hope to tell?\"\n\n\"Well--\" it was beginning to sound like the seeds of one of our old\narguments--\"well, I suppose so. Pure research isn't much encouraged,\nthese days.\"\n\n\"But it should be, you think?\"\n\n\"Of course it should. The only hope of the world--\" I trailed off.\nThrough the trees was a bright, distant glare, and I had just\nremembered what it was.\n\n\"Is what, Tom?\"\n\n\"There isn't any,\" I said, but only to myself. She didn't press me;\nshe merely burrowed into my arm.\n\nPerhaps the wind shifted, and the smell of the hemp fields grew\nstronger; perhaps it was only the foul thought that the glaring sky had\ntriggered that contaminated my mood. But where I had been happy and\nrelaxed--the C-bomb completely out of my mind for the moment--now I was\ntoo fully aware of what was ahead for all of us.\n\n\"Let's go back, Rena,\" I said. She didn't ask why. Perhaps she, too,\nwas feeling the weight of our death sentence.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe caught the evening newscast; its story varied little from the early\nones.\n\nBenedetto still slept, but Zorchi joined us as we watched it.\n\nThe announcer, face stamped with the careful blend of gravity and\nconfidence that marks tele-casters all over the world, was saying:\n\"Late word on the bomb exploded over the North Atlantic indicates that\nthere is some danger that radioactive ash may be carried to this area.\nThe danger zones are now being mapped and surveyed, and residents of\nall such sections will be evacuated or placed in deep sleep until the\ndanger is over.\n\n\"Blue Bolt policies give you complete protection against all hazards\nfrom this explosion. I repeat, Blue Bolt policies give you complete\nprotection against all hazards from this explosion. Check your policies\nand be sure of your status. There is absolutely no risk for any person\ncarrying the basic Blue Bolt minimum coverage or better.\"\n\nI clicked off the set. \"I wonder what the people in Shanghai are\nhearing tonight,\" I said.\n\nZorchi had only listened without comment, when I told him about the\nbomb that afternoon; he listened without comment now.\n\nRena said: \"Tom, I've been wondering. You know, I--I don't have any\ninsurance. Neither has my father, since we were canceled. And we're not\nthe only ones without it, either.\"\n\nI patted her hand. \"We'll straighten this out,\" I promised. \"You'll get\nyour coverage back.\"\n\nShe gave me a skeptical look, but shook her head. \"I don't mean just\nabout father and me. What about all of the uninsurables, all over the\nworld? The bomb goes off, and everybody with a policy files down into\nthe vaults, but what about the others?\"\n\nI explained, \"There are provisions for them. Some of them can be cared\nfor under the dependency-clauses in the policies of their next of\nkin. Others have various charitable arrangements--some localities,\nfor instance, carry blanket floater policies for their paupers and\nprisoners and so on. And--well, I don't suppose it would ever come to\nthat, but if someone turned up who had no coverage at all, he could\nbe cared for out of the loss-pool that the Company carries for such\ncontingencies. It wouldn't be luxurious, but he'd live.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You see,\" I went on, warming to my subject, \"the Company is set up\nso the actual premiums paid are meaningless. The whole objective of\nthe Company is service; the premiums are only a way to that goal. The\nCompany has no interest other than the good of the world, and--\"\n\nI stopped, feeling like a fool. Zorchi was laughing raucously.\n\nI said resentfully, \"I guess I asked for that, Zorchi. Well, perhaps\nwhat I said sounds funny. But, before God, Zorchi, that's the way the\nCompany is set up. Here--\" I picked the Handbook from the end-table\nbeside me and tossed it to him--\"read what Millen Carmody says. I won't\ntry to convince you. Just read it.\"\n\nHe caught it expertly and dropped it on the floor before him. \"So much\nfor your Chief Assassin,\" he remarked pleasantly. \"The words are no\ndoubt honied, Weels, but I am not at this moment interested to read\nthem.\"\n\nI shrugged. It was peculiar how even a reasonable man--I have always\nthought of myself as a reasonable man--could make a fool of himself. It\nwas no sin that habit had betrayed me into exalting the Company; but it\nwas, at the least, quite silly of me to take offense when my audience\ndisagreed with me.\n\nI said, in what must have been a surly tone, \"I don't suppose you\nare--why should you? You hate the Company from the word go.\"\n\nHe shook his head mildly. \"I? No, Weels. Believe me, I am the Company's\nmost devoted friend. Without it, how would I feed my five-times-a-day\nappetite?\"\n\nI sneered at him. \"If you're a friend to the Company, then my best\nbuddy is a tapeworm.\"\n\n\"Meaning that Zorchi is a parasite?\" His eyes were furious. \"Weels,\nyou impose on me too far! Be careful! Is it the act of a tapeworm that\nI bleed and die, over and over? Is it something I chose, did I pray\nto the saints, before my mother spawned me, that I should be born a\nmonster? No, Weels! We are alike, you gentlemen of the Company and\nI--we live on blood money, it is true. But the blood I live on, man--it\nis my own!\"\n\nI said mollifyingly, \"Zorchi, I've had a hard day. I didn't mean to be\nnasty. I apologize.\"\n\n\"Hah!\"\n\n\"No, really.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe shrugged, abruptly quiet. \"It is of no importance,\" he said. \"If I\nwished to bear you a grudge, Weels, I would have more than that to give\nme cause.\" He sighed. \"It all looked quite simple twenty-four hours\nago, Weels. True, I had worked my little profession in this area as far\nas it might go--with your help, of course. But the world was before\nme--I had arranged to fly next week to the Parisian Anarch, to change\nmy name and, perhaps within a month, with a new policy, suffer a severe\naccident that would provide me with francs for my hobbies. Why is it\nthat you bring bad news always?\"\n\nI said, \"Wasn't I of some little assistance to you at one time?\"\n\n\"In helping me from the deep-freeze? Oh, yes, perhaps. But didn't\nyou help me into it in the first place, as well? And surely you have\nalready had sufficient credit for aiding my escape--I observe the young\nlady looking at you with the eyes of one who sees a hero.\"\n\nI said in irritation, \"You're infuriating, Zorchi. I suppose you know\nthat. I never claimed any credit for helping you out of the clinic. As\na matter of fact, I don't think I ever mentioned it. Everyone assumed\nthat I had just happened to bring you along--no one questioned it.\"\n\nHe flared, \"You let them _assume_, Weels? You let them assume that\nZorchi was as helpless a side of pork as those other dead ones--you let\nthem guess that you stuck me with a needle, so that it would seem how\nbrave you were? Is it not true that I had revived by myself, Weels?\"\n\nI felt myself growing angry. \"Of course! But I just didn't see any\nreason to--\"\n\n\"To divide the credit, is that it, Weels? No, say no more; I have\nclosed the subject. However, I point out that there is a difference\nbetween the rescue of a helpless hulk and the mere casual assistance\none may be invited to give to a Zorchi.\"\n\nI let it go at that. There was no point in arguing with that man, ever.\n\nSo I left the room--ostensibly to look in on Benedetto, actually to\ncool off a little. Benedetto seemed fine--that is, the dressings were\nstill in place, he had not moved, his breath and pulse were slow and\nregular. I took my time before I went back to the room where Zorchi\nstill sat waiting.\n\nHe had taken advantage of the time to improve his mind. The man's\ncuriosity was insatiable; the more he denied it, the more it stuck out\nall over him. He had thrown the Handbook on the floor when I gave it to\nhim, but as soon as I was out of sight he was leafing through it. He\nhad it open on his lap, face down, as he faced me.\n\n\"Weels.\" There was, for once, no sardonic rasp to his voice. And his\nface, I saw, was bone-white. \"Weels, permit me to be sure I understand\nyou. It is your belief that this intelligent plan of seeding the world\nwith poison to make it well will succeed, because you believe that a\nSignore Carmody will evict Defoe from power?\"\n\nI said, \"Well, not exactly--\"\n\n\"But almost exactly? That is, you require this Millen Carmody for your\nplan?\"\n\n\"It wasn't _my_ plan. But you're right about the other.\"\n\n\"Very good.\" He extended the Handbook to me. \"There is here a picture\nwhich calls itself Millen Carmody. Is that the man?\"\n\nI glanced at the familiar warm eyes on the frontispiece. \"That's right.\nHave you seen him?\"\n\n\"I have, indeed.\" The shaggy beard was twitching--I did not know\nwhether with laughter or the coming of tears. \"I saw him not long ago,\nWeels. It was in what they call Bay 100--you remember? He was in a\nlittle bag like the pasta one carries home from a store. He was quite\nsound asleep, Weels, in the shelf just below the one I woke up in.\"\n\n\nXV\n\nSo now at last I knew why Millen Carmody had permitted Defoe to turn\nthe Company into a prison cell for the world. He couldn't forbid it,\nbecause the dead can forbid nothing, and Carmody was sleeping with the\ndead. No wonder Defoe was so concerned with the Naples sector!\n\nHow long? How long had Carmody been quietly out of the way, while\nDefoe made his plans and took his steps, and someone in a little room\nsomewhere confected \"statements\" with Millen Carmody's signature on\nthem and \"interviews\" that involved only one man?\n\nIt could not have been less than five or six years, I thought, counting\nback to the time when Defoe's name first began to register with me as\nan ordinary citizen, before I had married his cousin. Six years. That\nwas the date of the Prague-Vienna war. And the year following, Hanoi\nclashed with Cebu. And the year after that, Auckland and Adelaide.\n\nWhat in God's name was Defoe's plan? Nothing as simple as putting\nCarmody out of the way so that he could loot the Company. No man could\nwish to be that rich! It was meaningless....\n\nDefoe could be playing for only one thing--power.\n\nBut it didn't matter; all that mattered was that now I knew that\nCarmody was an enemy to Defoe. He was therefore an ally to Rena and to\nme, and we needed allies. But how might we get Carmody out of Bay 100?\n\nThere weren't any good answers, though Rena and I, with the help of\ngrumbling comments from Zorchi, debated it until the morning light\nbegan to shine. Frontal assault on the clinic was ridiculous. Even\na diversionary raid such as Rena had staged to try to rescue her\nfather--only ten days before!--would hardly get us in through the\ntriple-locked door of Bay 100. Even if Slovetski's movement had still\nbeen able to muster the strength to do it, which was not likely.\n\nIt was maddening. I had hidden the hypodermic Rena had brought in Bay\n100 to get it out of the way. Undoubtedly it was there still--perhaps\nonly a few yards from Millen Carmody. If fifty cubic centimeters of a\nwatery purplish liquid could have been plucked from the little glass\nbottle and moved the mere inches to the veins of his arms, the problem\nwould be solved--for he could open the door from inside as easily as\nZorchi had, and certainly once he was that far we could manage to get\nhim out.\n\nBut the thing was impossible, no matter how we looked at it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI suppose I fell asleep sitting in that chair, because I woke up in it.\nIt was in the middle of a crazy nightmare about an avenging angel with\ncobalt-blue eyes burning at me out of heaven; and I wanted to run from\nhim, but I was frozen by a little man with a hypodermic of ice. I woke\nup, and I was facing the television set. Someone--Rena, I suppose--had\ncovered me with a light spread. The set was blaring a strident tenor\nvoice. Zorchi was hunched over, watching some opera; I might as well\nhave been a thousand miles away.\n\nI lay blearily watching the tiny figures flickering around the screen,\nnot so much forgetting all the things that were on my mind as knowing\nwhat they were and that they existed, but lacking the strength to pick\nthem up and look at them. The opera seemed to concern an Egyptian queen\nand a priest of some sort; I was not very interested in it, though it\nseemed odd that Zorchi should watch it so eagerly.\n\nPerhaps, after all, there was something to his maudlin\nself-pity--perhaps I really did think of him as a monster or a dog, for\nI was as uneasy to see him watching an opera as I would have been to\nsee an ape play the flute.\n\nI heard trucks going by on the highway. By and by it began to penetrate\nthrough the haze that I was hearing a _lot_ of trucks going by on the\nhighway. I had no idea how heavily traveled the Naples-Caserta road\nmight be, but from the sound, they seemed nearly bumper to bumper,\nwhizzing along at seventy or eighty miles an hour.\n\nI got up stiffly and walked over to the window.\n\nI had not been far wrong. There was a steady stream of traffic in both\ndirections--not only trucks but buses and private cars, everything from\nlate-model gyromaxions to ancient piston-driven farm trucks.\n\nZorchi heard me move, and turned toward me with a hooded expression. I\npointed to the window.\n\n\"What's up?\" I asked.\n\nHe said levelly, \"The end of the world. It is now official; it has been\non the television. Oh, they do not say it in just so many words, but it\nis there.\"\n\nI turned to the television set and flicked off the tape-relay\nswitch--apparently the opera had been recorded. Zorchi glared, but\ndidn't try to stop me as I hunted on the broadcast bands for a news\nannouncer.\n\nI didn't have far to hunt. Every channel was the same: The Company was\nissuing orders and instructions. Every man, woman and child was to be\nready within ten days for commitment to the clinic....\n\nI tried to imagine the scenes of panic and turmoil that would be going\non in downtown Naples at that moment.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe newscaster was saying: \"Remember, if your Basic Blue Bolt policy\nnumber begins with the letters A, B or C--if it begins with the letters\nA, B or C--you are to report to the local first aid or emergency post\nat six hundred hours tomorrow. There is no danger. I repeat, there is\nno danger. This is merely a precaution taken by the Company for your\nprotection.\" He didn't really look as though there were no danger,\nhowever. He looked like a man confronted by a ghost.\n\nI switched to another channel. An equally harried-looking announcer:\n\"--reported by a team of four physicists from the Royal University to\nhave produced a serious concentration of radioactive byproducts in the\nupper atmosphere. It is hoped that the cloud of dangerous gases will\nveer southward and pass harmlessly through the Eastern Mediterranean;\nhowever, strictly as a precautionary measure, it is essential that\nevery person in this area be placed in a safety zone during the danger\nperiod, the peak of which is estimated to come within the next fourteen\ndays. If there is any damage, it will be only local and confined to\nlivestock--for which you will be reimbursed under your Blue Bolt\ncoverage.\"\n\nI switched to another channel. _Local_ damage! Local to the face of the\nEarth!\n\nI tried all the channels; they were all the same.\n\nThe Company had evidently decided to lie to the human race. Keep\nthem in the dark--make each little section believe that only it was\naffected--persuade them that they would be under for, at most, a few\nweeks or months.\n\nWas that, I wondered, Defoe's scheme? Was he planning to try somehow to\nconvince four billion people that fifty years were only a few weeks?\nIt would never work--the first astronomer to look at a star, the first\nseaman to discover impossible errors in his tide table, would spot the\nlie.\n\nMore likely he was simply proceeding along what must always have been\nhis basic assumption: The truth is wasted on the people.\n\nZorchi said with heavy irony, \"If my guest is quite finished with the\ninstrument, perhaps he will be gracious enough to permit me to resume\nA\u00efda.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI woke Rena and told her about the evacuation. She said, yawning, \"But\nof course, Tom. What else could they do?\" And she began discussing\nbreakfast.\n\nI went with her, but not to eat; in the dining hall was a small\ntelevision set, and on it I could listen to the same repeat broadcasts\nover and over to my heart's content. It was--in a way--a thrilling\nsight. It is always impressive to see a giant machine in operation, and\nthere was no machine bigger than the Company.\n\nThe idea of suspending a whole world, even piecemeal, was staggering.\nBut if there had been panic at first in the offices of the Company,\nnone of it showed. The announcers were harried and there was bustle and\nstrain, but order presided.\n\nThose long lines of vehicles outside the window; they were going\nsomewhere; they were each one, I could see by the medallion slung\nacross each radiator front, on the payroll of the Company.\n\nPerhaps the trick of pretending to each section that only it would be\naffected was wise--I don't know. It was working, and I suppose that\nis the touchstone of wisdom. Naples knew that something was going on\nin Rome, of course, but was doubtful about the Milanese Republic. The\nRomans were in no doubt at all about Milan, but weren't sure about the\nDuchy of Monaco, down the Riviera shore. And the man on the street, if\nhe gave it a thought at all, must have been sure that such faraway\nplaces as America and China were escaping entirely.\n\nI suppose it was clever--there was no apparent panic. The trick took\naway the psychological horror of world catastrophe and replaced it\nwith only a local terror, no different in kind than an earthquake or\na flood. And there was always the sack of gold at the end of every\ncatastrophe: Blue Bolt would pay for damage, with a free and uncounting\nhand.\n\nExcept that this time, of course, Blue Bolt would not, could not, pay\nat all.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBy noon, Benedetto was out of bed.\n\nHe shouldn't have been, but he was conscious and we could not make him\nstay put--short of chains.\n\nHe watched the television and then listened as Rena and I brought him\nup to date. Like me, he was shocked and then encouraged to find that\nMillen Carmody was in the vaults--encouraged because it was at least a\nhandle for us to grasp the problem with; if we could get at Carmody,\nperhaps we could break Defoe's usurped power. Without him, Defoe\nwould simply use the years while the world slept to forge a permanent\ndictatorship.\n\nWe got the old man to lie down, and left him. But not for long. Within\nthe hour he came tottering to where we were sitting, staring at the\ntelevision. He waved aside Rena's quick protest.\n\n\"There is no time for rest, my daughter,\" he said. \"Do not scold me. I\nhave a task.\"\n\nRena said worriedly, \"Dear, you _must_ stay in bed. The doctor said--\"\n\n\"The doctor,\" Benedetto said formally, \"is a fool. Shall I allow us to\ndie here? Am I an ancient idiot, or am I Benedetto dell'Angela who with\nSlovetski led twenty thousand men?\"\n\nRena said, \"Please! You're sick!\"\n\n\"Enough.\" Benedetto wavered, but stood erect. \"I have telephoned. I\nhave learned a great deal. The movement--\" he leaned against the wall\nfor support--\"was not planned by fools. We knew there might be bad\ndays; we do not collapse because a few of us are put out of service by\nthe Company. I have certain emergency numbers to call; I call them. And\nI find--\" he paused dramatically--\"that there is news. Slovetski has\nescaped!\"\n\nI said, \"That's impossible! Defoe wouldn't let him go!\"\n\n\"Perhaps Slovetski did not consult him,\" Benedetto said with dignity.\n\"At any rate, he is free and not far from here. And he is the answer\nwe have sought, you understand.\"\n\n\"How?\" I demanded. \"What can he do that we can't?\"\n\nBenedetto smiled indulgently, though the smile was strained. His wound\nmust have been giving him hell; it had had just enough time to stiffen\nup. He said, \"Leave that to Slovetski, Thomas. It is his m\u00e9tier, not\nyours. I shall go to him now.\"\n\nWell, I did what I could; but Benedetto was an iron-necked old man. I\nforbade him to leave and he laughed at me. I begged him to stay and he\nthanked me--and refused. Finally I abandoned him to Rena and Zorchi.\n\nZorchi gave up almost at once. \"A majestic man!\" he said admiringly, as\nhe rolled into the room where I was waiting, on his little power cart.\n\"One cannot reason with him.\"\n\nAnd Rena, in time, gave up, too. But not easily. She was weeping when\nshe rejoined me.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe had been unable even to get him to let her join him, or to consider\ntaking someone else with him; he said it was his job alone. She didn't\neven know where he was going. He had said it was not permissible, in so\ncritical a situation, for him to tell where Slovetski was.\n\nZorchi coughed. \"As to that,\" he said, \"I have already taken the\nliberty of instructing one of my associates to be ready. If the Signore\nhas gone to meet Slovetski, my man is following him....\"\n\nSo we waited, while the television announcers grew more and more\ngrim-lipped and imperative.\n\nI listened with only half my mind. Part of my thoughts were with\nBenedetto, who should have been in a hospital instead of wandering\naround on some dangerous mission. And partly I was still filled with\nthe spectacle that was unfolding before us.\n\nIt was not merely a matter of preserving human lives. It was almost as\nimportant to provide the newly awakened men and women, fifty years from\nnow, with food to eat and the homes and tools and other things that\nwould be needed.\n\nFactories and transportation gear--according to the telecasts--were\nbeing shut down and sealed to stand up under the time that would\npass--\"weeks,\" according to the telecast, but who needed to seal a\ntool in oil for a few weeks? Instructions were coming hourly over\nthe air on what should be protected in each home, and how it was to\nbe done. Probably even fifty years would not seriously damage most\nof the world's equipment--if the plans we heard on the air could be\nefficiently carried out.\n\nBut the farms were another matter. The preserving of seeds was\nroutine, but I couldn't help wondering what these flat Italian fields\nwould look like in fifty untended years. Would the radiocobalt\nsterilize even the weeds? I didn't think so, but I didn't know. If not,\nwould the Italian peninsula once again find itself covered with the\ndense forests that Caesar had marched through, where Spartacus and his\nrunaway slaves had lurked and struck out against the Senators?\n\nAnd how many millions would die while the forests were being cleared\noff the face of the Earth again to make way for grain? Synthetic foods\nand food from the sea might solve that--the Company could find a way.\nBut what about the mines--three, four and five thousand feet down--when\nthe pumps were shut off and the underground water seeped in? What about\nthe rails that the trains rode on? You could cosmoline the engines,\nperhaps, but how could you protect a million miles of track from the\nrains of fifty years?\n\nSo I sat there, watching the television and waiting. Rena was too\nnervous to stay in one place. Zorchi had mysterious occupations of his\nown. I sat and stared at the cathode screen.\n\nUntil the door opened behind me, and I turned to look.\n\nRena was standing there. Her face was an ivory mask. She clutched the\ndoor as her father had a few hours before; I think she looked weaker\nand sicker than he.\n\nI said, for the first time, \"Darling!\" She stood silent, staring at me.\nI asked apprehensively, \"What is it?\"\n\nThe pale lips opened, but it was a moment before she could frame the\nwords. Then her voice was hard to hear. \"My father,\" she said. \"He\nreached the place where he was meeting Slovetski, but the expediters\nwere there before him. They shot him down in the street. And they are\non their way here.\"\n\n\nXVI\n\nIt was quick and brutal. Somehow Benedetto had been betrayed; the\nexpediters had known where he had come from. And that was the end of\nthat.\n\nThey came swarming down on us in waves, at least a hundred of them, to\ncapture a man, a girl and a cripple--Zorchi's servants had deserted us,\nmelting into the hemp fields like roaches into a garbage dump. Zorchi\nhad a little gun, a Beretta; he fired it once and wounded a man.\n\nThe rest was short and unpleasant.\n\nThey bound us and gagged us and flew us, trussed like game for the\nspit, to the clinic. I caught a glimpse of milling mobs outside the\nlong, low walls as we came down. Then all I could see was the roof of\nthe copter garage.\n\nWe were brought to a tiny room where Defoe sat at a desk. The\nUnderwriter was smiling. \"Hello, Thomas,\" he said, his eyes studying\nthe bruise on my cheek. He turned toward Rena consideringly. \"So this\nis your choice, eh, Thomas?\" He studied Rena coolly. \"Hardly my type.\nStill, by sticking with me, you could have had a harem.\"\n\nBound as I was, I started forward. Something hit me in the back at\nmy first step, driving a hot rush of agony up from my kidneys. Defoe\nwatched me catch my breath without a change of expression.\n\n\"My men are quite alert, Thomas. Please do not try that again. Once is\namusing, but twice would annoy me.\" He sighed. \"I seem to have been\nwrong about you, Thomas. Perhaps because I needed someone's help, I\noverestimated you. I thought long ago that beneath your conditioning\nyou had brains. Manning is a machine, good for taking orders. Dr.\nLawton is loyal, but not intelligent. And between loyalty and\nintelligence, I'll take brains. Loyalty I can provide for myself.\" He\nnodded gravely at the armed expediters.\n\nZorchi spat. \"Kill us, butcher,\" he ordered. \"It is enough I die\nwithout listening to your foolish babbling.\"\n\nDefoe considered him. \"You interest me, Signore. A surprise, finding\nyou revived and with Wills. Before we're finished, you must tell me\nabout that.\"\n\nI saw Zorchi bristle and open his mouth, but a cold, suddenly\ncalculating idea made me interrupt. \"To get dell'Angela out as an\nattendant, I needed a patient for him to wheel. Zorchi had money, and I\n_expected_ gratitude when I revived him later. It wasn't hard getting\nLawton's assistant to stack his cocoon near Benedetto's.\"\n\n\"Lawton!\" Defoe grimaced, but seemed to accept the story. He smiled\nat me suddenly. \"I had hopes for you, then. That escape was well\ndone--simple, direct. A little crude, but a good beginning. You could\nhave been my number one assistant, Thomas. I thought of that when I\nheard of the things you were saying after Marianna died--I thought you\nmight be awaking.\"\n\nI licked my lips. \"And when you picked me up after Marianna's death,\nand bailed me out of jail, you made sure the expediter corps had\ninformation that I was possibly not reliable. You made sure the\ninformation reached the underground, so they would approach me and I\ncould spy for you. You wanted a patsy!\"\n\nThe smile was gleaming this time. \"Naturally, until you could prove\nyourself. And of course, I had you jailed for the things you said\nbecause I wanted it that way. A pity all my efforts were wasted on you,\nThomas. I'm afraid you're not equipped to be a spy.\"\n\nIt took everything I had, but this time I managed to smile back. \"On\nwhich side, Defoe? How many spies know you've got Millen Carmody down\nin Bay--\"\n\nThat hit him. But I didn't have time to enjoy it. He made a sudden\ngesture, and the expediters moved. This time, when they dragged me\ndown, it was very bad.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen I came to, I was in another room. Zorchi and Rena were with me,\nbut not Defoe. It was a preparation chamber, racked with instruments,\nfurnished with surgical benches.\n\nA telescreen was flickering and blaring unheeded at one end of the\nroom. I caught a glimpse of scenes of men, women and children standing\nin line, going in orderly queues through the medical inspections,\nfiling into the clinic and its local branch stations for the sleep\ndrug. The scenes were all in Naples; but they must have been, with\nlocal variations, on every telescreen on the globe.\n\nDr. Lawton appeared. He commanded coldly: \"Take your clothes off.\"\n\nI think that was the most humiliating moment of all.\n\nIt was, of course, only a medical formality. I knew that the suspendees\nhad to be nude in their racks. But the very impersonality of the\nproceeding made it ugly. Reluctantly I began to undress, as did Rena,\nsilent and withdrawn, and Zorchi, sputtering anger and threats. My\nwhole body was a mass of redness; in a few hours the red would turn to\npurple and black, where the hoses of the expediters had caressed me.\n\nOr did a suspendee bruise? Probably not. But it was small satisfaction.\n\nLawton was looking smug; no doubt he had insisted on the privilege of\nputting us under himself after I'd blamed him for Zorchi's escape. I\ncouldn't blame him; I would have returned the favor with great joy.\n\nWell, I had wanted to reach Millen Carmody, and Defoe was granting my\nwish. We might even lie on adjacent racks in Bay 100. After what I'd\ntold Defoe, we should rate such reserved space!\n\nLawton approached with the hypospray, and a pair of expediters grabbed\nmy arms. He said: \"I want to leave one thought with you, Wills. Maybe\nit will give you some comfort.\" His smirk told me that it certainly\nwould not. \"Only Defoe and I can open Bay 100,\" he reminded me. \"I\ndon't think either of us will; and I expect you will stay there a long,\nlong time.\"\n\nHe experimentally squirted a faint mist from the tip of the hypospray\nand nodded satisfaction. He went on: \"The suspension is effective for\na long time--several hundred years, perhaps. But not forever. In time\nthe enzymes of the body begin to digest the body itself.\" He pursed his\nlips thoughtfully. \"I don't know if the sleeping brain knows it is pain\nor not. If it does, you'll know what it feels like to dissolve in your\nown gutwash....\"\n\nHe smiled. \"Good night,\" he crooned, and bent over my arm.\n\nThe spray from the end of the hypo felt chilly, but not at all painful.\nIt was as though I had been touched with ice; the cold clung, and\nspread.\n\nI was vaguely conscious of being dumped on one of the surgical tables,\neven more vaguely aware of seeing Rena slumping across another.\n\nThe light in the room yellowed, flickered and went out.\n\nI thought I heard Rena's voice....\n\nThen I heard nothing. And I saw nothing. And I felt nothing, except\nthe penetrating cold, and then even the cold was gone.\n\n\nXVII\n\nMy nerves throbbed with the prickling of an infinity of needles. I was\ncold--colder than I had ever been. And over everything else came the\ninsistent, blurred voice of Luigi Zorchi.\n\n\"Weels! Weels!\"\n\nAt first it was an annoyance. Then, abruptly, full consciousness came\nrushing back, bringing some measure of triumph with it. It had worked!\nMy needling of Defoe and my concealing of Zorchi's ability to revive\nhimself had succeeded in getting us all put into Bay 100, where the\nprecious hypodermic and fluid were hidden. After being pushed from\npillar to post and back, even that much success was enough to shock me\ninto awareness.\n\nMy heart was thumping like a rusty cargo steamer in a high sea. My\nlungs ached for air and burned when they got it. But I managed to\nopen my eyes to see Zorchi bending over me. Beyond him, I saw the\nblue-lighted sterilizing lamps, the door that opened from inside, and\nthe racked suspendees of Bay 100.\n\n\"It is time! But now finally you awake, you move!\" Zorchi grumbled.\n\"The body of Zorchi does not surrender to poisons; it throws them\noff. But then because of these small weak legs, I must wait for you!\nCome, Weels, no more dallying! We have still work to do to escape this\nabomination!\"\n\nI sat up clumsily, but the drugs seemed to have been neutralized. I was\non the bottom tier, and I managed to locate the floor with my legs and\nstand up. \"Thanks, Zorchi,\" I told him, trying to avoid looking at his\nugly, naked body and the things that were almost his legs.\n\n\"Thanks are due,\" he admitted. \"I am a modest man who expects no\npraise, but I have done much. I cannot deny it. It took greatness to\ncrawl through this bay to find you. On my hands and these baby knees,\nWeels, I crawled. Almost. I am overcome with wonder at so heroic--But\nI digress. Weels, waste no more time in talking. We must revive the\nothers who are above my reach. Then let us, for God, go and find food.\"\n\nSomehow, though I was still weak, I managed to follow Zorchi and drag\ndown the sacks containing Rena and Carmody. And while waiting for them\nto revive, I began to realize how little chance we would have to escape\nthis time, naked and uncertain of what state affairs were in. I also\nrealized what might happen if Lawton or Defoe decided to check up on\nBay 100 now!\n\nFor the few minutes while Rena revived and recognized me, and while I\nexplained how I'd figured it out, it was worth any risk. Then finally,\nCarmody stirred and sat up. Maybe we looked enough like devils in a\nblue hell to justify his first expression.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe wasn't much like my mental image of the great Millen Carmody. His\nface was like his picture, but it was an older face and haggard under\nthe ugly light. Age was heavy on him, and he couldn't have been a noble\nfigure at any time. Now he was a pot-bellied little man with scrawny\nlegs and a faint tremble to his hands.\n\nBut there was no fat in his mind as he tried to absorb our explanations\nwhile he answered our questions in turn. He'd come to Naples, bringing\nhis personal physician, Dr. Lawton. His last memory was of Lawton\ngiving him a shot to relieve his indigestion.\n\nIt must have been rough to wake up here after that and find what a\nmess had been made of the world. But he took it, and his questions\nbecame sharper as he groped for the truth. Finally he sat back, nodding\nsickly. \"Defoe!\" he said bitterly. \"Well, what do we do now, Mr.\nWills?\"\n\nIt shook me. I'd unconsciously expected him to take over at once. But\nthe eyes of Rena and Zorchi also turned to me. Well, there wasn't much\nchoice. We couldn't stay here and risk discovery. Nor could we hide\nanywhere in the clinic; when Defoe found us gone, no place would be\nsafe.\n\n\"We pray,\" I decided. \"And if prayers help, maybe we'll find some way\nout.\"\n\n\"I can help,\" Carmody offered. He grimaced. \"I know this place and\nthe combination to the private doors. Would it help if we reached the\ngarage?\"\n\nI didn't know, but the garage was half a mile beyond the main entrance.\nIf we could steal a car, we might make it. We had to try.\n\nThere were sounds of activity when we opened the door, but the section\nwe were in seemed to be filled, and the storing of suspendees had moved\nelsewhere.\n\nWe shut and relocked the door and followed Carmody through the\nseemingly endless corridors, with Zorchi hobbling along, leaning on\nRena and me and sweating in agony. We offered to carry him, but he\nwould have none of that. We moved further and further back, while the\nsight of Carmody's round, bare bottom ahead ripped my feeling of awe\nfor him into smaller and smaller shreds.\n\nHe stopped at a door I had almost missed and his fingers tapped out\nsomething on what looked like an ornamental pattern. The door opened\nto reveal stairs that led down two flights, winding around a small\nelevator shaft. At the bottom was a long corridor that must be the one\nleading underground to the garage. Opposite the elevator was another\ndoor, and Carmody worked its combination to reveal a storeroom, loaded\nwith supplies the expediters might need.\n\nHe ripped a suit of the heavy gray coveralls off the wall and began\ndonning them. \"Radiation suits,\" he explained. They were ugly things,\nbut better than nothing. Anyone seeing us in them might think we were\non official business. Zorchi shook off our help and somehow got into\na pair. Then he grunted and began pulling hard-pellet rifles and\nbandoliers of ammunition off the wall.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Now, Weels, we are prepared. Let them come against us. Zorchi is\nready!\"\n\n\"Ready to kill yourself!\" I said roughly. \"Those things take practice!\"\n\n\"And again I am the freak--the case who can do nothing that humans can\ndo, eh, Weels?\" He swore thickly, and there was something in his voice\nthat abruptly roughened it. \"Never Zorchi the man! There are Sicilians\nwho would tell you different, could they open dead mouths to speak of\ntheir downed planes!\"\n\n\"He was the best jet pilot Naples had,\" Rena said quietly.\n\nIt was my turn to curse. He was right; I hadn't thought of him as\na man, or considered that he could do anything but regrow damaged\ntissues. \"I'm sorry, Luigi!\"\n\n\"No matter.\" He sighed, and then shrugged. \"Come, take arms and\nammunition and let us be out of this place. Even the nose of Zorchi can\nstand only so much of the smell of assassins!\"\n\nWe moved down the passage, staggering along for what seemed to be\nhours, expecting every second to run into some official or expediter\nforce. But apparently the passage wasn't being used much during the\nemergency. We finally reached stairs at the other end and headed up,\nafraid to attract attention by taking the waiting elevator.\n\nAt the top, Carmody frowned as he studied the side passages and doors.\n\"Here, I guess,\" he decided. \"This may still be a less used part of the\ngarage.\" He reached for the door.\n\nI stopped him. \"Wait a minute. Is there any way back in, once we leave?\"\n\n\"The combination will work--the master combination used by the Company\nheads. Otherwise, these doors are practically bomb-proof!\" He pressed\nthe combination and opened the door a crack.\n\nOutside, I could see what seemed to be a small section of the Company\ncar pool. There were sounds of trucks, but none were moving nearby. I\nsaw a few men working on trucks a distance from us. Maybe luck was on\nour side.\n\nI pointed to the nearest expediter patrol wagon--a small truck, really,\nenclosed except for the driver's seat. \"That one, if there's fuel.\nWe'll have to act as if we had a right to it, and hope for the best.\nZorchi, can you manage it that far?\"\n\n\"I shall walk like a born assassin,\" he assured me, but sweat began\npopping onto his forehead at what he was offering. Yet there was no\nsign of the agony he must have felt as he followed and managed to climb\ninto the back with Rena and Carmody.\n\nThe fuel gauge was at the half mark and, as yet, there was no cry of\nalarm. I gunned the motor into life, watching the nearest workmen. They\nlooked up casually, and then went back to their business. Ahead, I\ncould see a clear lane toward the exit, with a few other trucks moving\nin and out. I headed for it, my hair prickling at the back of my neck.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe reached the entrance, passed through it, and were soon blending into\nthe stream of cars that were passing the clinic on their way out for\nmore suspension cases.\n\nThe glass doors of the entrance were gone now, and workmen were putting\nup huge steel ones in their place, even while a steady stream of cases\nwere hobbling or being carried into the clinic. Most of them were old\nor shabby, I noticed. The class-D type. The last ones to be admitted.\nWe must have spent more time in the vault than I'd thought, and zero\nhour was drawing near.\n\nBeyond the clinic, the whole of Anzio was a mass of abandoned cars that\nseemed to stretch for miles, and the few buildings not boarded up were\nobviously class-D dwellings, too poor to worry about. I cursed my way\nthrough a jam-up of trucks, and managed to find one of the side roads.\n\nThen I pressed down on the throttle as far as I dared without\nattracting attention, until I could find a safe place to turn off with\nno other cars near to see me.\n\n\"Where to?\" I asked. We couldn't go back to Zorchi's, since any\nexpediter investigation would start there. Maybe we'd never be missed,\nbut I couldn't risk it. If we had to, we could use some abandoned\nvilla and hide out, but I was hoping for a better suggestion.\n\nZorchi looked blank, and Rena shrugged. \"If we could only find\nNikolas--\" she suggested doubtfully.\n\nI shook my head. I'd had a chance to think about that a little while\nthe expediters took us to see Defoe, and I didn't like it. The leader\nof the revolution had apparently been captured by Defoe. According to\nBenedetto dell'Angela, he'd escaped. Yet Defoe hadn't tried to pump us\nabout him. And when Benedetto set out to meet him, the expediters had\ndescended at once.\n\nIt made an ugly picture. I had no wish to go looking for the man.\n\n\"There's my place,\" Carmody said finally. \"I had places all over the\nworld, kept ready for me and stocked. If Defoe let it be thought that I\nhad retired, he must have kept them all up as I'd have done. Wait, let\nme orient myself. Up that road.\"\n\nPlaces all over the world, with food that was wasted, and with servants\nwho might never see their master! And I'd been brought up believing\nthat the Underwriters were men of quiet, simple tastes! Carmody's clay\nfeet were beginning to crumble up to the navel!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe villa was surrounded by trees, on a low hill that overlooked an\nartificial lake. It had been sealed off, but the combination lock\nyielded to Carmody's touch. There were beds made up and waiting,\nfreezers stocked with food that sent Zorchi into ecstasy, and even a\ncomplete file of back issues of the Company paper. Carmody headed for\nthose, with the look of a man hunting his lost past. He had a lot of\ncatching up to do.\n\nBut it was the television set that interested me. It was still working,\nwith taped material being broadcast. The appeal had been stepped up,\nasking for order and cooperation; I recognized the language as being\npitched toward the lower classes now, though. And the clicking of a\nradiation-counter sounded as a constant background, with occasional\nshots of its meter, the needle well into the danger area.\n\nZorchi joined me and Rena, dribbling crumbs of meat down his beard. He\nsnorted as he caught sight of the counter. \"There is a real one in the\nother room, and it registers higher,\" he said. \"It is interesting. For\nme, of no import. Doctors whom I trust have said Defoe is wrong; my\nbody can resist damage from radiation--and perhaps even from old age.\nBut for you and the young lady....\"\n\nHe shut up at my expression, but the tape cut off and a live announcer\ncame on before I could say anything. \"A bulletin just in,\" he said,\n\"shows that the government of Naples has unanimously passed a\nmoritorium on all contracts, obligations and indebtedness for the\nduration of the emergency. The Company has just followed this with\na declaration that it will extend the moritorium to include all\ncrimes against the Company. During the emergency, the clinics will be\navailable to all without prejudice, Director Defoe said today.\"\n\n\"A trap,\" Rena guessed. \"We wouldn't have a chance, anyhow. But, Tom,\ndoes the other mean that--\"\n\n\"It means your father was wrong,\" I answered. \"As of right now--and\nprobably in every government at the same time--the Company has been\nfreed from any responsibility.\"\n\nIt didn't make any difference, of course. Benedetto had expected that\neveryone must secretly hate the Company as he did; he hadn't realized\nthat men who have just been saved from the horrible danger of radiation\ndeath aren't going to turn against the agency that saved them. And\ndamn it, the Company _was_ saving them, after its opponents had\nrisked annihilation of the race. Defoe would probably make sure the\nsuspendees were awakened at a rate where he could keep absolute power,\nbut not from any danger of bankruptcy.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCarmody had come out and listened, attracted by the broadcast radiation\nclicking, apparently. Now he asked enough questions to discover\nBenedetto's idea, and shook his head.\n\n\"It wouldn't work,\" he agreed with me. \"Even if I still had control,\nI couldn't permit such a thing. What good would it do? Could money\npayments make food for a revived world, Miss dell'Angela? Would\nbankrupting the only agency capable of rebuilding the Earth be a thing\nof honor? Besides, even with what I've read, I can see no hope. There's\nnothing we can do.\"\n\n\"But if you can arouse the other Underwriters against Defoe,\" she\ninsisted, \"at least you can prevent _his_ type of world!\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"How? All communications are in his hands. Even if\nI could fly to the Home Office, most of the ones I could trust--and\nthere apparently are a few Defoe hasn't been able to retire--would be\nscattered, out of my reach. A week ago, there might have been a chance.\nNow, it's impossible. Impossible.\"\n\nHe shook his head sadly and wandered back toward the library. I could\nsee that in his secret thoughts, he was wishing we'd left him safely\nin the vault. Maybe it would have been just as well.\n\n\"Cheer up,\" I told Rena. \"Carmody's an old man--too old to think in\nterms of direct action, even when it's necessary. Defoe doesn't own the\nworld yet!\"\n\nBut later, when I located the books I wanted in the library and went\nout into the vine-covered bower in the formal garden, I wasn't as\nconfident as I'd pretended.\n\nThinking wasn't a pleasant job, after all the years when I'd let others\ndo my thinking for me. But now I had to do it for myself. Otherwise,\nthe only alternative was to plan some means of quick death for us all\nbefore the radiation got too intense. And I couldn't accept that.\n\nRena had managed something Marianna couldn't have conceived--she'd\nquietly relinquished her fate into my hands, gambling on me with\neverything she had. Whether I wanted to or not, I'd taken the\nresponsibility. Carmody was an old man; one who hadn't been able to\nkeep Defoe from taking over in the first place. And Zorchi--well, he\nwas Zorchi.\n\nThat night, the radiation detector suddenly took a sharp lift, its\nneedle crossing over into the red. It was probably only a local rise.\nBut it didn't make my thinking any more comfortable.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was at breakfast that next morning when I finally took it up with\nCarmody. \"Just what will the situation be at the clinic after they\nclose down? How many will be kept awake? And what about their defenses?\"\n\nHe frowned, trying to see my idea. Then he shrugged. \"Too many, Tom.\nWe had plotted out a course for such things as this a number of times\nin Planning. And our mob psychologists warned that there'd inevitably\nbe a few who for one reason or another wouldn't come in in time, but\nwho would then grow desperate and try to break in. Outlaws, looters,\nprocrastinators, fanatics. That sort. So for some time, there should\nbe at least twenty guards kept alert. And that's enough to defend a\nclinic. Atomic cannon at every entrance, of course, and the clinics are\nbomb-proof.\"\n\n\"Twenty, eh? And how about Defoe and Lawton? Will they sleep?\" It\nseemed logical that they couldn't stay out of suspension for the whole\nfifty years or so. There'd be no profit to gaining a world after they\nwere too old to use it.\n\n\"Not at first. There's a great deal of final administrative work to be\ndone. There's a chamber equipped to keep a hundred or so men awake\nwith radiation washed from the air, and containing adequate supplies,\nin cable contact with other clinics. They'll be there. Later, they'll\ntake shifts, with only a couple of men awake at a time, I suppose. They\nmay age a little that way, but not much.\"\n\nHe frowned again, and then slowly nodded. \"It could be done, if we had\nsome way to wait safely for six months. Getting back in is no problem\nfor me.\"\n\n\"It's going to be done,\" I told him. \"And a lot sooner. Are you willing\nto take the chance?\"\n\n\"Have I any choice?\" He shrugged again. \"Do you think I haven't been\nsick at the idea of a man like Defoe in command of the Company for\nas long as he lives? Tom, my family started the Company. I've got an\nobligation to restore it to its right course. If there's any chance of\nkeeping Defoe from being emperor of the world, I've got to take it. If\nyou can put me in a position where I can get the honest Underwriters\ntogether again, where we can set up the Company as it was--\"\n\n\"Why? So this will happen all over again?\"\n\nHe looked shocked at Rena's question. \"I don't blame you for being\nbitter, Miss dell'Angela. But with Defoe gone--\"\n\n\"The Company made Defoe possible. In fact, it made him and Slovetski\ninevitable,\" I told him flatly. \"That's its one great crime. Whenever\nyou take power completely out of the hands of the many, it winds up in\nfewer and fewer hands. Those histories I was reading last night prove\nthat. Carmody, what do you know about your own Company? Or the world?\nLeave the consolidation of power in Company hands out of it, and what\nhas happened to progress?\"\n\nHe frowned. \"Well, we've leveled off a bit. We had to. We couldn't\nrisk--\"\n\n\"Exactly. You couldn't risk research that would lead to increased\nlongevity--too many pensioners. You couldn't risk going to\nMars--unpredictable dangers. You had to make the world fit actuarial\ncharts. I remember seeing one of the first suspendees awakened. He\nexpected things we could have done fifty years ago--and never will do.\nHow many men today work their way out of their class? And why have\nclasses so rigidly stratified? I've been reading your own speeches of\nnearly fifty years ago. I've got them here, together with some tables.\nLike to see them?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe took the papers silently and began going through them, his shock\ngiving way to a grudging realization. Maybe without the jolt of his\nawakening, he'd have laughed them off, but nothing was easy to dismiss\nwith the hell brewing outside. At last he looked up.\n\n\"Tom, I'll admit the many times when I've been worried. I've considered\nstarting research again countless times. I've been aware that\ndependence was growing too heavy on the Company. But we can't just toss\nit aside. It did bring an end to major war, when such a war would have\nruined the Earth completely. It showed that nobody had to starve--that\nhardly anyone had to lack for any necessity, or die for lack of care.\nYou can't throw that away.\"\n\n\"You can throw away its unrelated power.\" I knew I didn't have the\nanswers. All this had been growing slowly in my mind since I'd first\nfound Benedetto a political prisoner, but a lifetime wasn't enough to\nthink it out, even with the books I'd found.\n\nBut I had to try. \"In the middle ages, they had morality and politics\ntied into one bundle, Carmody. The church ruled. It wasn't good and\nthey finally had to divorce church and state. Maybe the same applies\nto administrative politics and economics. The Company has shown what\ncan be done economically. The church has survived as a great moral\nforce outside material power. Now let's see if we can't put things in\nperspective.\n\n\"There's a precedent. The United States--the old government--was set\nup on the idea of balance of power: an elected Congress for the people\nto handle legislative tasks, a selected President to handle executive\naffairs, and a Judiciary mostly independent. On a world scale, as it\ncan be done today--since the Company has really made it one world--the\nsame can be done, with something like the Company to insure economics.\"\n\n\"I suppose every man who had any idealism has thought the same,\"\nCarmody said slowly. He sighed softly. \"I remember trying to preach it\nto my father when I was just out of college. You're right. But can you\nset up such a perfect government? Can I? Tell me how, Tom, and I'll\ngive you your chance, if I can.\"\n\nZorchi laughed cynically, but that was what I'd hoped Carmody might say.\n\n\"All right,\" I told him. \"We can't do it. No one man is fit to rule,\never, or to establish rule. Oh, I had wish-dreams, a few days ago, I\nsuppose, about what I'd do, _if_! But men have set out to establish\nnew systems before, and done good jobs of it. Read the Constitution--a\nsystem put together artificially by expert political thinkers,\nand good for two hundred years, at least! And they didn't have our\nopportunities. For the first time, the world has to wait. Get the best\nminds you can, Carmody. Give them twenty-five years to work it out.\nThey can come up with an answer. And then, when the world is awakened,\nyou can start with it, fresh, without upsetting any old order. Is that\nyour answer?\"\n\n\"Most of it.\" There was a sudden light in his old eyes. \"Yes, the sleep\ndoes make the chance possible. But how are you going to get the experts\nand assemble them?\"\n\nI pointed to Zorchi. \"Hermes, the messenger of the gods. He's a jet\npilot who can get all over the world. And he can move outside, without\nneeding to worry about radiation.\"\n\n\"So?\" Zorchi snorted again. \"So, I am now your messenger, Weels! Do you\nthink I would trouble myself so much for all of you, Weels?\"\n\nI grinned at him. \"You defiantly speak of being a man. That makes you\npart of the human race. I'm simply taking you at your word.\"\n\n\"So?\" he repeated, his face wooden. \"Such a messenger would have much\npower, Weels. Suppose I choose to be Zorchi the ruler?\"\n\n\"Not while Zorchi the man is also Zorchi the freak,\" I said with\ndeliberate cruelty. \"Go look at yourself.\"\n\nAnd suddenly he smiled, his lips drawing back from his teeth. \"Weels,\nfor the first time you are honest. And for that as well as that I _am_\na man, I will be Zorchi the messenger. But first, should we not decide\non a plan of action? Or do we first rule and then conquer?\"\n\n\"We wait first,\" I told him.\n\nOn the wall, the radiation indicator clicked steadily, its needle\nmoving further into the red.\n\n\nXVIII\n\nThe second day, the television went off the air with the final curt\nannouncement that anyone not inside the clinics at noon would be left\noutside permanently. Then the set went dead, leaving only the clucking\nand beeping of our own radiation indicator. I'd thrown it out twice and\nbrought it back both times.\n\nCivilization had ended on the third day, though all the conveniences\nin the villa went on smoothly, except for the meter reading that told\nus nothing could be smooth. It was higher than the predictions I had\nheard, though I still hoped that was only a sporadic local phenomenon\nthat would level out later. In the face of that, it was hard to\nbelieve that even a few men would remain outside the clinics, though I\nwas counting on it.\n\nWe waited another twenty-four hours, forcing ourselves to sit in the\nvilla, discussing plans, when our nerves were yelling for action. We\nhad only an estimate to go on. If we got there too soon, there would be\nmore awake than we could handle. Too late and we'd be radiation cases,\ngood for nothing but the vaults.\n\nIt was a relief to leave at last, taking our weapons in the truck.\nWe were wearing the radiation suits, hoping they'd protect us, and\nZorchi spent the last two days devising pads and straps to cushion and\nstrengthen his developing legs.\n\nThe world was dead. Cars had been abandoned in the middle of the road,\nmaking driving difficult.\n\nThe towns and villas were deserted, boarded up or simply abandoned. We\nmight have been the last men on Earth, and we felt that we were as we\nheaded for Anzio. This wasn't just a road, or Naples--or all of Italy.\nIt was the world.\n\nThen Rena pointed. Ahead, a boy was walking beside a dog, the animal's\nleft rear leg bound and split as if it had been broken. I started to\nslow, then forced myself to drive on. As we passed, I saw that the boy\nwas about fourteen, and his face was dirty and tear-streaked. He shook\none fist at us, and came trudging on.\n\n\"If we win, we'll have the door open when he gets there,\" Rena said.\n\"For him and his dog! If not, it won't matter how long it takes him.\nYou couldn't stop, Tom.\"\n\nIt didn't make me feel any better. But now dusk was falling, and we\nslowed, waiting until it was dark to park quietly near the garage. In\nfront of the entrance, I could see a small ring of fires, and by their\nlight a few figures moving about. They were madmen, of course--and yet,\nprobably less mad than others who must be prowling through the towns,\nlooting for things they could never use.\n\nIt seemed incredible that any one could be outside, but the\npsychologists had apparently been right. These were determined men,\nwilling to wait for the forlorn chance that some miracle might give\nthem a futile, even more forlorn chance to try battering down the great\ndoors. Maybe somewhere in the world, such a group might succeed. But\nnot here. As I watched, there was a crackle of automatic gunfire from\nthe entrance. The guards were awake, all right, and not taking chances\non any poor devil getting too close.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere were no guards in the vault garage. We were prepared in case\nsomeone might be stationed inside the private entrance, as much\nprepared as we could be; since Carmody had been listed as still living,\nan ordinary guard who recognized him would probably let us in first and\nthen try to report--giving us time to handle him. But we were lucky.\nThe door opened to Carmody's top-secret combination.\n\n\"We designed such combinations into a few doors in case of internal\nrevolution locally while no Underwriters were around. We never\nconsidered having an Underwriter lead a revolution from outside,\" he\nwhispered to us.\n\nThe underground passage was deserted, and this time Carmody led through\nanother corridor, to a stairs that seemed to wind up forever. Zorchi\ngroaned, then caught himself.\n\n\"It leads to the main reception room,\" Carmody said.\n\nWith the men outside, most of the guards who still remained awake might\nbe there. But we had to chance it. We stopped when we reached the top,\ncatching our breath while Zorchi sank to the floor, writhing silently.\n\nThen Rena threw back the door, Zorchi's rifle poked through, and I\nwas leaping for the main door controls, hoping the memory I had was\naccurate. I was nearly to them when the two guards standing beside\nthem turned.\n\nThey yelled, just as my rifle spat. At that range, I couldn't miss. And\nbehind, I heard Zorchi's gun spit. The second guard slumped sickly to\nthe floor, holding his stomach. I grabbed for the controls, while other\nyells sounded, and feet began pounding toward me.\n\nThere was no time to look back. The doors were slowly moving apart and\nCarmody was beside me, smashing a maul from the storeroom onto the\nelectronic controls of the atomic cannon. I twisted between the opening\ndoors.\n\n\"We've seized the vaults,\" I shouted. \"We need help. Any man who joins\nus will be saved!\"\n\nI couldn't wait to watch, but I heard a hoarse, answering shout, and\nthe sound of feet.\n\nCarmody's maul had ruined the door controls. But the other guards were\nnearly on us. I saw two more sprawled on the floor. Zorchi hadn't\nmissed. Then Carmody's fingers had found another of the private doors\nthat looked like simple panels here. Rena and Carmody were through, and\nI yanked Zorchi after me, just as a bullet whined over his head. Behind\nus, I heard uncontrolled yelling as men from outside began pouring in.\n\nIt was our only hope. They had to take care of the guards, who were\nstill probably shocked at finding us _inside_. We headed for the\nprivate quarters where Defoe would be, praying that there would be only\na few there.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis passage was useless to us, though. It led from office to office\nfor the doctors who superintended here. We came out into an office,\nwatching our chance for the hall we had to take. I could see the men\nwho had been outside in action now. A few had guns of some kind, but\nthe clubs in the hands of the others were just as deadly in such a\ndesperation attack; men who had seen themselves already dead weren't\nafraid of chances. About a score of the expediter guards were trying to\nhold off at least twice their number.\n\nThen the hall seemed clear and we leaped into it. Suddenly gongs began\nringing everywhere. Some guard had finally reached or remembered the\nalarm system. Carmody cursed, and tried to move faster.\n\nThe small private vault for the executives lay through the\nadministration quarters and down several levels, before it was entered\nthrough a short passageway. Carmody had mapped it for me often enough.\nBut he knew it by physical memory, which was better than my training.\nHe'd also taught me the combination, but I left the door to his\npracticed fingers when we came to it.\n\nThe elevator wasn't up. We couldn't wait. We raced down the stairs that\ncircled it. Here Carmody's age told against him, and he fell behind.\nRena and I were going down neck and neck with Zorchi throwing himself\nalong with us. He had dropped his rifle and picked up a sub-machine gun\nfrom one of the fallen guards, and he clung to it now, using only one\nhand on the rail.\n\nIt was a reflection on a gun-barrel that saved us. The picked\nexpediters were hidden in the dark mouth of the passageway, waiting\nfor us to turn the stairs. But I caught a gleam of metal, and threw up\nmy gun. Instantly, Zorchi was beside me, the sub-machine spitting as\nquickly as I could fire the first shot. \"Aim for the wall. Ricochet!\"\n\nThe ambushers had counted too much on surprise. They weren't ready to\nhave the tables turned, nor for the trick Zorchi had suggested. Here we\ncouldn't fire directly, but the bouncing shots worked almost as well.\nThere were screams of men being hit, and the crazed pandemonium of\nothers suddenly afraid.\n\nShots came toward us, but the wall that protected them--or was supposed\nto--ruined their shooting.\n\nZorchi abruptly dropped, landing with a thud on his side. I grunted\nsickly, thinking he was hit.\n\nThen I saw the sub-machine gun point squarely into the passageway.\nIt began spitting out death. By the time we could reach him, the\nexpediters were dead or dying. There had been seven of them.\n\nZorchi staggered into the passage, through the bodies, crying\nsomething. I jumped after him, blinking my eyes to make out what he had\nseen. Then I caught sight of a door at the back being silently closed.\nIt was a thick, massive slab, like the door to a bank vault.\n\nZorchi made a final leap that brought a sob of anguish as he landed on\nhis weak legs, but his gun barrel slapped into the slit of opening. The\ndoor ground against it, strained and stopped. Zorchi pulled the trigger\nbriefly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor a second, then, there was silence. A second later, Defoe's voice\ncame out through the thin slit. \"You win. Dr. Lawton and I are alone\nand unarmed. We're coming out.\"\n\nThe door began opening again, somewhat jerkily this time. I watched it,\nexpecting a trick, but there was none.\n\nInside the vault, the first room was obviously for guards and for the\ncontrol of the equipment needed to wash all contamination out of the\nair and to provide the place with security for a century, even if all\nthe rest of the Earth turned into a radioactive hell.\n\nLawton was slumped beside the controls, his head cradled in his arms.\nBut at the sight of us, he stood up groggily, his mouth open, and shock\non his face.\n\nDefoe's eyes widened a trifle, but he stood quietly, and the bleak\nsmile never faltered. \"Congratulations, Thomas,\" he said. \"My one fault\nagain--I underrated the opposition. I wasn't expecting miracles. Hello,\nMillen. Fancy meeting you here.\"\n\n\"Search the place,\" I ordered.\n\nCarmody went past the two without looking at them, with Rena close\nbehind. A minute later, I heard a triumphant shout. They came back with\na cringing man who seemed totally unlike the genial Sam Gogarty who had\nfirst introduced me to fine food and to Rena. His eyes were on Carmody,\nand his skin was gray white. He started to babble incoherently.\n\nCarmody grinned at him. \"You've got things twisted, Gogarty. Tom\nWills is in charge of this affair.\" He turned toward one of the\nsmaller offices. \"As I remember it, there should be a transmitting\nsetup in here. I want to make sure it works. If it does, some of the\nUnderwriters are going to get a surprise, unless they're suspended.\"\n\nGogarty watched him go, and then sank slowly to a chair, shaking his\nhead as he looked up at me. His lips twisted into bitter resignation.\n\"You wouldn't understand, Tom. All my life, worked for things. Class-C,\ndigging in a mine, eating Class-D, getting no fun, so I could buy\nClass-B employment. Then Class-A. Not many can do it, but I sweated it\nout. Thirty years living like a dog and killing myself with work and\nstudy. Not even a real woman until I met Susan, and she went to Defoe.\nBut I wanted it easier for the young men. I wanted everybody to have\na good life. No harm to anyone. Pull together, and forget the tough\ntimes. Then you had to come and blow the roof off....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI felt sick. It was probably all true, and few men could make it. But\nif that's what it took to advance under the Company rules, it was\njustification enough for our fight. \"You'll be all right, Sam,\" I told\nhim. \"You'll go to sleep with the others. And when you wake up, you may\nhave to work like hell again, but it'll be to rebuild the Earth, not to\nruin it. Maybe there'll even be a chance with Susan again.\"\n\nDefoe laughed sardonically. \"Very nice, Thomas. And I suppose you mean\nit. What's in the future for me?\"\n\n\"Suspension until the new government gets organized and can decide your\ncase. I'd like to vote now for permanent suspension.\"\n\nHis face lost some of his amusement. Then he shrugged. \"All right, I\nsuppose I knew that. But now will you satisfy my curiosity? Just how\n_did_ you work the business with Bay 100?\"\n\n\"What happened to Slovetski?\" I asked. I couldn't be sure about some of\nmy suspicions over Benedetto's death, but I couldn't take chances that\nthe man might still be loose somewhere, or else hiding out here until\nwe were off guard.\n\nHe shook his head. \"I can answer, but I'm waiting for a better offer.\"\n\n\"Sam?\" I asked.\n\nGogarty nodded slowly. \"All right, Tom. I guess you're the boss now.\nAnd I think I'm even glad of it. I always liked you. I'll answer about\nSlovetski.\"\n\nDefoe snarled and swung, then saw my rifle coming up, and straightened\nagain. \"You win once more, Thomas. Your great international rebel\ncooperated with us very nicely after we caught him. We arranged for\nhim to receive all calls to his most secret hideout right here in this\nroom. It netted us his fellow conspirators--including your father,\nMiss dell'Angela!\"\n\nShe gasped faintly, but her head came up at once. \"Nikolas was no\ntraitor. You're lying!\"\n\n\"Why should I lie?\" he asked. \"With the right use of certain drugs, any\nman can become a traitor. And Dr. Lawton is an expert on drugs.\"\n\n\"Where is he?\" I asked.\n\nHe shrugged. \"How should I know? He wanted a radioactive world, so I\nlet him enjoy it. We put him outside just before we closed the doors\npermanently.\"\n\nGogarty nodded confirmation. I turned it over. He might even have\nbeen one of the men waiting outside. But it wouldn't matter. Without\nhis organization and with a world where life outside was impossible,\nSlovetski's power was finished.\n\nI turned to Zorchi. \"The men who broke in will be going crazy soon,\"\nI told him. \"While Rena finds the paging system and reassures them\nthey'll all be treated in the reception room, how about getting Lawton\nto locate and revive a couple of the doctors you know and trust?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRena came back from the paging system, and Zorchi prodded Lawton with\nthe gun, heading him toward the files that would show the location of\nthe doctors. Gogarty stood up doubtfully, but I shook my head. Zorchi\nwas able to handle a man of Lawton's type, even without full use of his\nlegs, and I couldn't trust Gogarty yet.\n\n\"You can give me a hand with Defoe, Sam,\" I suggested. \"We'd better\nstrap him down first.\"\n\nGogarty nodded, and then suddenly let out a shocked cry, and was\ncringing back!\n\nIn the split second when both Rena and I had looked away, Defoe had\nwhipped out an automatic and was now covering us, his teeth exposed in\na taut smile. \"Never underestimate an opponent, Thomas,\" he said. \"And\nnever believe what he says. You should have searched me, you know.\"\n\nThe gun was centered on Rena and he waited, as if expecting me to make\nsome move. All I could do was stand there, cursing myself. I'd thought\nof everything--except the obvious!\n\nDefoe backed toward the door and slipped around it, drawing its heavy\nweight slowly shut until only a crack showed. Then he laughed. \"Give my\nlove to Millen,\" he said, and laughed softly.\n\nI jumped for the door, but his feet were already moving out of the\npassage. The door began opening again, but I knew it was too late.\nThen, it was open. And amazingly, Defoe stood not ten feet away.\n\nAt the other end of the passage, a ragged bloody figure was standing,\nswaying slowly from side to side, holding a rifle. I took a second look\nto recognize Nikolas Slovetski. He was moving slowly toward Defoe. And\nnow Defoe jerked back and began frantically digging for the automatic\nhe must have pocketed.\n\nSlovetski leaped, tossing the gun aside in a way that indicated it must\nhave been empty. A bullet from Defoe's automatic caught his shoulder\nin mid-leap, but it couldn't stop him. He crashed squarely on Defoe,\nswinging a knife as the other went down. It missed, ringing against the\nhard floor.\n\nI'd come unfrozen by then. I kicked the knife aside and grabbed the gun\nfrom Defoe's hands. Slovetski lay limp on him, and I rolled the smaller\nman aside.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDefoe was out cold from the blow of his head hitting the floor. Gogarty\nhad come out behind me and now began binding him up. He opened his eyes\nslowly, blinked, and tried to grin as he stared at the bonds. He swung\nhis head to the figure on the floor beside him. \"Shall we go quietly,\nNikolas?\" he asked, as Gogarty picked him up and carried him back to\nthe private vault.\n\nBut his sarcasm was wasted on Slovetski. The man must have been dying\nas he stumbled and groped his way toward the place where he knew Defoe\nmust be. And the bullet in the shoulder had finished him. Rena bent\nover him, a faint sob on her lips.\n\nSurprisingly, he fought his way back to consciousness, staring up at\nher. \"Rena,\" he said weakly. \"Benedetto! I loved him. I--\" Then his\nhead rolled toward me. \"At least, I lived to die in a revolution,\nThomas. Dirty business, revolution. When in the course of human events,\nit becomes--\"\n\nHe died before he could finish. I went looking for Lawton, to make sure\nDefoe was suspended at once. He'd be the last political suspendee, if\nI had anything to do with it, but there would be a certain pleasure in\nwatching Lawton do the job.\n\n\nXIX\n\nThe doors of the reception hall were closed again, but there was no\nlock now. One of the two doctors whom Zorchi had trusted was there\nnow, waiting for the stragglers who came in slowly as a result of our\nbroadcast. We couldn't reach them all, of course, but some could be\nsaved. The men who had fought with us were treated and suspended. Even\nthe boy and his dog had finally reached us and been put away.\n\nIn the main room of the executive vault, Carmody was waiting for\nRena and me as we came in, haggard from lack of sleep, but somehow\nyounger-looking than he had been since we had first revived him.\n\nHe stood up, managing a tired smile. \"The first work's done, Tom,\" he\nsaid. \"It wasn't too hard, once they learned Defoe was suspended; a lot\nof the others were afraid of him, I guess. So far, I've only contacted\nthe ones I can trust, but it's a beginning. I've gotten tapes of their\ndelegation of authority to you as acting assistant Chief Underwriter. I\nguess the factor that influenced them most was your willingness to give\nup all hopes of suspension for the emergency. And having Zorchi was a\nhelp, too--one man like him is worth an army now. I'll introduce you\ntomorrow.\"\n\nHe stumbled out, heading toward the sleeping quarters.\n\nWell, I had the chance I'd wanted. And I had his promise to put off\nsuspension until things were running properly. With time to develop a\nsmall staff, and with a chance to begin the work of locating the men to\nstudy the problems that had to be solved, I couldn't ask for much more.\n\nZorchi grinned at me. \"Emperor Weels!\" he mocked.\n\nI grinned back. \"If you ever say that seriously, Luigi, I want you to\nsay it with a bullet through my brain. I've seen enough cases of power\ncorrupting.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor a second, he studied me. \"If that day should come, then there shall\nbe the bullet. But now, even I must sleep,\" he said.\n\nThen he glanced at Rena. \"I have left orders that a priest should be\nwakened.\"\n\nShe colored faintly.\n\n\"You'll be best man, I suppose?\" I asked.\n\nThis time, even his beard couldn't conceal his amusement. \"Is Zorchi\nnot always the best man?\" he asked as he left us alone.\n\nI stared at the vault that would be my home for the next twenty-five\nor fifty years--until I was an old man, and the rest of the world was\nready to be awakened. \"It's a lousy place to spend a honeymoon,\" I told\nRena.\n\nShe leaned against me. \"But perhaps a good place to bring up children,\"\nshe said. \"A place to teach them that their children will have a good\nworld, Tom. That's all a woman ever wants, I guess.\"\n\nI drew her to me. It was a good way to think of the future, whatever\nhappened. And it _would_ be a better world, where the virtues of the\nCompany could be used.\n\nProbably it wouldn't be perfect.\n\nEven the best form of government all the experts could devise couldn't\noffer a permanent solution. But it could give men a chance to fight\ntheir way to a still better world.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n[Transcriber's Note: There are two section V headings as per the\norginal publication.]\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Preferred Risk, by Edson McCann\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PREFERRED RISK ***\n\n***** This file should be named 51814-8.txt or 51814-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/1/8/1/51814/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
