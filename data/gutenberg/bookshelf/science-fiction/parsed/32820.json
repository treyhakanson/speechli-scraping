So here's good\nnews for Mayhem fans; another great adventure of the Man of Many\nBodies.]\n\n\nThey loaded the over-age spaceship at night because Triton's one\nspaceport was too busy with the oreships from Neptune during the day to\nhandle it.\n\n\"Symphonies!\" Pitchblend Hardesty groaned. Pitchblend Hardesty was the\nstevedore foreman and he had supervised upwards of a thousand loadings\non Triton's crowded blastways, everything from the standard mining\nequipment to the innards of a new tavern for Triton City's so-called\nStreet of Sin to special anti-riot weapons for the Interstellar\nPenitentiary not 54 miles from Triton City, but never a symphony\norchestra. And most assuredly never, never an all-girl symphony\norchestra.\n\n\"Symphonies!\" Pitchblend Hardesty groaned again as several stevedores\ncame out on the blastway lugging a harp, a base fiddle and a kettle\ndrum.\n\n\"Come off it, Pitchblend,\" one of the stevedores said with a grin. \"I\ndidn't see you staying away from the music hall.\"\n\nThat was true enough, Pitchblend Hardesty had to admit. He was a small,\nwiry man with amazing strength in his slim body and the lore of a solar\nsystem which had been bypassed by thirtieth century civilization for the\nlures of interstellar exploration in his brain. While the symphony--the\nall-girl symphony--had been playing its engagement at Triton's\nmake-shift music hall, Hardesty had visited the place three times.\n\n\"Well, it wasn't the music, sure as heck,\" he told his critic now. \"Who\never saw a hundred girls in one place at one time on Triton?\"\n\nThe stevedore rolled his eyes and offered Pitchblend a suggestive\nwhistle. Hardesty booted him in the rump, and the stevedore had all he\ncould do to stop from falling into the kettle drum.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJust then a loud bell set up a lonely tolling and Pitchblend Hardesty\nexclaimed: \"Prison break!\"\n\nThe bell could be heard all over the two-hundred square miles of\ninhabitable Triton, under the glassite dome which enclosed the small\ncity, the spaceport, the immigration station for nearby Neptune and the\nInterstellar Penitentiary. The bell hadn't tolled for ten years; the\nlast time it had tolled, Pitchblend Hardesty had been a newcomer on\nNeptune's big moon. That wasn't surprising, for Interstellar\nPenitentiary was as close to escape-proof as a prison could be.\n\n\"All right, all right,\" Pitchblend snapped. \"Hurry up and get her\nloaded.\"\n\n\"What's the rush?\" one of the stevedores asked. \"The gals ain't even\narrived from the hotel yet.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what the rush is,\" Pitchblend declared as the bell tolled\nagain. \"If you were an escaped prisoner on Triton, just where would you\nhead?\"\n\n\"Why, I don't know for sure, Pitchblend.\"\n\n\"Then I'll tell you where. You'd head for the spaceport, fast as your\nlegs could carry you. You'd head for an out-going spaceship, because it\nwould be your only hope. And how many out-going spaceships are there\ntonight?\"\n\n\"Why, just two or three.\"\n\n\"Because all our business is in the daytime. So if the convict was smart\nenough to get out, he'll be smart enough to come here.\"\n\n\"We got no weapons,\" the stevedore said. \"We ain't even got a\npea-shooter.\"\n\n\"Weapons on Triton? You kidding? A frontier moon like this, the place\nwould be blasted apart every night. Interstelpen couldn't hold all the\ndisturbers of the peace if we had us some guns.\"\n\n\"But the convict--\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Pitchblend said grimly. \"He'll be armed, all right.\"\n\nPitchblend rushed back to the manifest shed as the bell tolled a third\ntime. He got on the phone and called the desk of the Hotel Triton.\n\n\"Hardesty over at the spaceport,\" he said. \"Loading foreman.\"\n\n\"Loading foreman?\" The mild, antiseptic voice at the other end of the\nconnection said it as you would say talking dinosaur.\n\n\"Yeah, loading foreman. At night I'm in charge here. Listen, you the\nmanager?\"\n\n\"The manager--\" haughtily--\"is asleep. I am the night clerk.\"\n\n\"O.K., then. You tell those hundred girls of yours to hurry. Don't scare\nthem, but have you heard about the prison break?\"\n\n\"Heard about it? It's all I've been hearing. They--they want to stay and\nsee what happens.\"\n\n\"Don't let 'em!\" roared Pitchblend. \"Use any excuse you have to. Tell\n'em we got centrifigal-upigal and perihelion-peritonitus over here at\nthe spaceport, or any darn thing. Tell 'em if they want to blast off\ntonight, they'll have to get down here quick. You got it?\"\n\n\"Yes, but--\"\n\n\"Then do it.\" Pitchblend hung up.\n\nThe escape bell tolled a fourth time.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis name was House Bartock, he had killed two guards in his escape, and\nhe was as desperate as a man could be. He had been sentenced to\nInterstelpen for killing a man on Mars in this enlightened age when\ncapital punishment had been abolished. Recapture thus wouldn't mean\ndeath, but the prison authorities at Interstelpen could make their own\ninterpretations of what life-in-prison meant. If House Bartock allowed\nhimself to be retaken, he would probably spend the remaining years of\nhis life in solitary confinement.\n\nHe walked quickly now, but he did not run. He had had an impulse to run\nwhen the first escape bell had tolled, but that would have been foolish.\nAlready he was on the outskirts of Triton City because they had not\ndiscovered his escape for two precious hours. He could hole up in the\ncity, lose himself somewhere. But that would only be temporary.\n\nThey would find him eventually.\n\nOr, he could make his way to the spaceport. He had money in his\npocket--the dead guard's. He had a guardsman's uniform on, but stripped\nof its insignia it looked like the jumper and top-boots of any spaceman.\nHe had false identification papers, if needed, which he had worked on\nfor two years in the prison printshop where the prison newspaper was\npublished. He had....\n\nSuddenly he flattened himself on the ground to one side of the road,\nhugging the gravel and hardly daring to breathe. He'd heard a vehicle\ncoming from the direction of Interstelpen. It roared up, making the\nground vibrate; its lights flashed; it streaked by trailing a jet of\nfire.\n\nHouse Bartock didn't move until the afterglow had faded. Then he got up\nand walked steadily along the road which led from Interstelpen to Triton\nCity.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Girls! Hurry with your packing! Girls!\"\n\nSighing, Matilda Moriarity subsided. The girls, obviously, were in no\nhurry. That would have been out of character.\n\nMatilda Moriarity sighed again. She was short, stocky, fifty-two years\nold and the widow of a fabulously wealthy interstellar investment\nbroker. She had a passion for classical music and, now that her husband\nhad been dead three years, she had decided to exercise that passion. But\nfor Matilda Moriarity, a very out-going fifty-two, exercising it had\nmeant passing it on. The outworlds, Matilda had told her friends, lacked\nculture. The highest form of culture, for Matilda, was classical music.\nVery well. She would bring culture to the outworlds.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTriton was her first try and even now sometimes she had to pinch herself\nso she'd know the initial attempt had been a smashing success. She\ndidn't delude herself completely. It had been a brainstorm selecting\nonly girls--and pretty young things, at that--for the Interstellar\nSymphony. On a world like Triton, a world which played host to very few\nwomen and then usually to the hard types who turned up on any frontier\nin any century, a symphony of a hundred pretty girls was bound to be a\nsuccess.\n\nBut the music, Matilda Moriarity told herself. They had listened to the\nmusic. If they wanted to see the girls in their latest Earth-style\nevening gowns, they had to listen to the music. And they had listened\nquietly, earnestly, apparently enjoying it. The symphony had remained on\nTriton longer than planned, playing every night to a full house. Matilda\nhad had the devil's own time chaperoning her girls, but that was to be\nexpected. It was their first taste of the outworlds; it was the\noutworlds' first taste of them. The widow Moriarity had had her hands\nfull, all right. But secretly, she had enjoyed every minute of it.\n\n\"They say the bell means a prison break!\" First Violin squealed\nexcitedly. First Violin was twenty-two, an Earth girl named Jane\nCummings and a student at the conservatory on Sirtus Major on Mars, but\nto the widow Moriarity she was, and would remain, First Violin. That\nway, calling the girls after their instruments, the widow Moriarity\ncould convince herself that her symphonic music had been of prime\nimportance on Triton, and her lovely young charges of secondary\nimportance.\n\n\"How many times do I have to tell you to hurry?\"\n\n\"But these gowns--\"\n\n\"Will need a pressing when you return to Mars anyway.\"\n\n\"And a prison break. I never saw a prison break before. It's so\nexciting.\"\n\n\"You're not going to see it. You're just going to hear about it. Come\non, come on, all of you.\"\n\nAt that moment the room phone rang.\n\n\"Hello?\" the widow Moriarity said.\n\n\"This is Jenkins, ma'am, desk. The spaceport called a few minutes ago.\nI'm not supposed to frighten you, but, well, they're rather worried\nabout the prison break. The escaped convict, they figure, will head for\nthe spaceport. Disguised, he could--\"\n\n\"Let him try masquerading as a member of _my_ group!\" the widow\nMoriarity said with a smile.\n\n\"All the same, if you could hurry--\"\n\n\"We are hurrying, young man.\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am.\"\n\nThe widow Moriarity hung up. \"Gi-irls!\"\n\nThe girls squealed and laughed and dawdled.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHouse Bartock felt like laughing.\n\nHe'd just had his first big break, and it might turn out to be the only\none he needed. On an impulse, he had decided to strike out directly for\nthe spaceport. He had done so, and now stood on the dark tarmac between\nthe manifest shed and the pilot-barracks. And, not ten minutes after he\nhad reached the spacefield a cordon of guards rushed there from\nInterstelpen had been stationed around the field. Had Bartock arrived\njust a few minutes later, he would have been too late, his capture only\na matter of time. As it was now, though, he had a very good chance of\ngetting away. Circumstances were in his favor.\n\nHe could get so far away that they would never find him.\n\nIt was simple. Get off Triton on a spaceship. Go anyplace that had a big\nspaceport, and manage to tranship out in secret. Then all the police\nwould have to search would be a few quadrillion square miles of space!\n\nBut first he had to leave Triton.\n\nFrom the activity at the port, he could see that three ships were being\nmade ready for blastoff. Two of them were purely cargo-carriers, but the\nthird--Bartock could tell because he saw hand-luggage being\nloaded--would carry passengers. His instinct for survival must have been\nworking overtime: he knew that the third ship would be his best bet, for\nif he were discovered and pursued, hostages might make the difference\nbetween recapture and freedom.\n\nBartock waited patiently in the darkness outside the pilot-barracks. The\nonly problem was, how to discover which pilot belonged to which ship?\n\nThe cordon of police from Interstelpen had set up several score\narc-lights on the perimeter of the field. The spaces between the lights\nwere patrolled by guards armed, as Bartock was, with blasters. Bartock\ncould never have made it through that cordon now. But it wasn't\nnecessary. He was already inside.\n\nThe barracks door opened, and a pilot came out. Tensing, ready, Bartock\nwatched him.\n\nThe three ships were scattered widely on the field, _Venus Bell_ to the\nnorth, _Star of Hercules_ to the south, _Mozart's Lady_ to the east.\n_Venus Bell_ and _Star of Hercules_ were straight cargo carriers.\n_Mozart's Lady_--what a queer name for a spaceship, Bartock couldn't\nhelp thinking--had taken in hand luggage. So if the pilot who had just\nleft the barracks headed east, Bartock would take him. The pilot paused\noutside, lit a cigarette, hummed a tune. The scent of tobacco drifted\nover to Bartock. He waited.\n\nThe pilot walked east toward _Mozart's Lady_.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Ready, girls?\"\n\n\"Ready, Mrs. Moriarity. But couldn't we--well--sort of hang around until\nwe see what happens?\"\n\n\"You mean the escaped convict?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am.\" Hopefully.\n\n\"They'll catch him. They always catch them.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Come on.\"\n\n\"Aw, gosh, Mrs. Moriarity.\"\n\n\"I said, come on.\"\n\nReluctantly, the hundred girls trooped with their chaperone from the\nhotel.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBartock struck swiftly and without mercy.\n\nThe blaster would make too much noise. He turned it around, held it by\nthe barrel, and broke the pilot's skull with it. In the darkness he\nchanged clothing for the second time that night, quickly, confidently,\nhis hands steady. In the darkness he could barely make out the pilot's\nmanifest. The man's ship was _Mozart's Lady_, all right. Outbound from\nTriton City for Mars. Well, Bartock thought, he wouldn't go to Mars.\nAssuming they learned what ship he had boarded, they would be guarding\nthe inner orbits too closely.\n\nHe would take _Mozart's Lady_ daringly outward, beyond Neptune's orbit.\nNaturally, the ship wouldn't have interstellar drive, but as yet Bartock\nwasn't going interstellar. You couldn't have everything. You couldn't\nexpect a starship on Triton, could you? So Bartock would take _Mozart's\nLady_ outward to Pluto's orbit--and wait. From the amount of hand\nluggage taken aboard, _Mozart's Lady_ would be carrying quite a number\nof passengers. If that number were reduced--drastically reduced--the\nfood, water and air aboard would last for many months. Until the fuss\ndied down. Until Bartock could bring _Mozart's Lady_, long since given\nup for lost, in for a landing on one of the inner planets....\n\nNow he dragged the dead pilot's body into the complete darkness on the\nsouth side of the pilot-barracks, wishing he could hide it better but\nknowing he didn't have the time or the means.\n\nThen he walked boldly across the tarmac, wearing a pilot's uniform,\ntoward _Mozart's Lady_.\n\nFifteen minutes later, House Bartock watched with amazement while a\nhundred pretty young women boarded the ship. Of all the things that had\nhappened since his escape, this came closest to unnerving him, for it\nwas the totally unexpected. Bartock shrugged, chain-smoked three\ncigarettes while the women boarded slowly, taking last-minute looks at\ndark Triton, the spaceport, the cordon of guards, the arc-lights.\nBartock cursed impotently. Seconds were precious now. The pilot's body\nmight be found. If it were....\n\nAt last the port clanged shut and the ground-crew tromped away. Since\neven an over-age ship like _Mozart's Lady_ was close to ninety percent\nautomatic, there was no crew. Only the pilot--who was Bartock--and the\npassengers.\n\nBartock was about to set the controls for blastoff when he heard\nfootsteps clomp-clomping down the companionway. He toyed with the idea\nof locking the door, then realized that would arouse suspicion.\n\nA square woman's face over a plump middle-aged figure.\n\n\"I'm Mrs. Moriarity, pilot. I have a hundred young girls aboard. We'll\nhave no nonsense.\"\n\n\"No, sir. I mean, no ma'am.\"\n\n\"Well, make sure.\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am.\"\n\n\"And I want an easy trip, without fuss or incidents. For half of our\ngirls it's the second time in space--the first being when they came out\nhere. You understand?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am.\"\n\n\"What happened to the pilot who took us out?\"\n\n\"Uh, pressed into service last week on a Mercury run. I'm surprised the\ncontrol board didn't tell you.\"\n\n\"They didn't. It doesn't matter. You do your job, and that's all.\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" House Bartock said. \"Just my job.\"\n\nA few moments later, _Mozart's Lady_ blasted off.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Stop! Hey, wait!\" Pitchblend Hardesty bawled at the top of his voice.\nBut it didn't do any good. The police rushed up behind Pitchblend, not\ndaring to fire.\n\nMoments before, they had found the dead pilot's body.\n\nThey knew at once what it meant, of course. They had been not more than\na minute too late.\n\n\"Call Central Control on Neptune,\" a police officer said. \"We'll send a\ncruiser after them.\"\n\n\"Won't do any good,\" Pitchblend Hardesty groaned.\n\n\"What are you talking about, fellow?\"\n\n\"Unless the cruiser's brand new.\"\n\n\"On Neptune? Don't be silly. Newest one we've got is ten years old.\"\n\n\"Like I said, won't do any good. I worked that ship over, mister. I know\nwhat she's like inside. She may look like an over-age tub on the\noutside, but don't let that fool you. She's got power, mister. She's\nprobably the fastest thing this side of the Jovian moons, except for\nthose experimental one-man rocket-bombs down at Neptune Station. But\nchasing a big tub in a one-man space-bound coffin--\" here Pitchblend\nused the vernacular for the tiny one-man experimental ships--\"ain't\ngoing to do anybody any good. Best thing you can do is track _Mozart's\nLady_ by radar and hope she'll head sunward. Then they could intercept\nher closer in.\"\n\nBut _Mozart's Lady_ did not head sunward. Radar tracking confirmed this\nmoments later. _Mozart's Lady_ was outward bound for Pluto's orbit. And,\nwith Pluto and Neptune currently in conjunction, that could even mean a\nlanding, although, the police decided, that wasn't likely. There were no\nsettlements on Pluto. Pluto was too weird. For the strangest reason in a\nsolar system and a galaxy of wonders, Pluto was quite uninhabitable.\nMore likely, _Mozart's Lady_ would follow Pluto's orbit around, then\nmake a dash sunward....\n\nThe radar officer threw up his hands. \"I give up,\" he said. \"She's\nheading for Pluto's orb all right. Call Neptune Station.\"\n\n\"Neptune Station, sir?\"\n\n\"You bet. This job's too big for me. The brass will want to handle it.\"\n\nSeconds later, sub-space crackled with energy as the call was put\nthrough from Triton City to Neptune Station.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhatever else history would write about him, it would\ncertainly call Johnny Mayhem the strangest--and literally most\ndeath-defying--test-pilot in history. Of course, testing the sleek\nexperimental beauties out of Neptune Station and elsewhere wasn't\nMayhem's chief occupation. He was, in a phrase, a trouble-shooter for\nthe Galactic League. Whenever he had a spare few weeks, having completed\nan assignment ahead of schedule in his latest of bodies, he was likely\nto turn up at some testing station or other and volunteer for work. He\nwas never turned down, although the Galactic League didn't approve.\nMayhem was probably the galaxy's best pilot, with incredible reflexes\nand an utter indifference toward death.\n\nFor the past two weeks, having completed what turned out to be an\neasier-than-expected assignment on Neptune, he had been piloting the\nspace-bound coffins out of Neptune Station, and with very satisfactory\nexperimental results.\n\nA few minutes ago he had been called into the station director's office,\nbut when he entered he was surprised to see the Galactic League Firstman\nof Neptune waiting for him.\n\n\"Surprised, eh?\" the Firstman demanded.\n\n\"I'll bet you want me to quit test-flying,\" Mayhem said with a smile\nwhich, clearer than words, told the Firstman his advice would be\nrejected.\n\nThe Firstman smiled too, \"Why, no, Mayhem. As a matter of fact, I want\nyou to take one of the coffins into deep space.\"\n\n\"Maybe something's wrong with my hearing,\" Mayhem said.\n\n\"No. You heard it right. Of course, it's up to you. Everything you do,\nyou volunteer.\"\n\n\"Let's hear it, Firstman.\"\n\nSo the Firstman of Neptune told Johnny Mayhem about _Mozart's Lady_\nwhich, six hours ago, had left Triton for Pluto's orbit with an\neccentric wealthy widow, a hundred girls, and a desperate escaped\nkiller.\n\n\"The only thing we have out here fast enough to overtake them, Mayhem,\nis the one-man coffins. The only man we have who can fly them is you.\nWhat do you say?\"\n\nMayhem's answer was a question, but the question didn't really require\nan answer. Mayhem asked: \"What are we waiting for?\"\n\nThe Firstman grinned. He had expected such an answer, of course. The\nwhole galaxy, let alone the solar system, knew the Mayhem legend. Every\nworld which had an Earthman population and a Galactic League post,\nhowever small, had a body in cold storage, waiting for Johnny Mayhem if\nhis services were required. But of course no one knew precisely when\nMayhem's services might be required. No one knew exactly under what\ncircumstances the Galactic League Council, operating from the hub of the\nGalaxy, might summon Mayhem. And only a very few people, including those\nat the Hub and the Galactic League Firstmen on civilized worlds and\nObservers on primitive worlds, knew the precise mechanics of Mayhem's\ncoming.\n\nJohnny Mayhem, a bodiless sentience. Mayhem--Johnny Marlow, then--who\nhad been chased from Earth, a pariah and a criminal, eight years ago,\nwho had been mortally wounded on a wild planet deep within the\nSaggitarian Swarm, whose life had been saved--after a fashion--by the\nwhite magic of that planet. Mayhem, doomed now to possible immortality\nas a bodiless sentience, an _elan_, which could occupy and activate a\ncorpse if it had been frozen properly ... an _elan_ doomed to wander\neternally because it could not remain in one body for more than a month\nwithout body and _elan_ perishing. Mayhem, who had dedicated his\nstrange, lonely life to the service of the Galactic League because a\nnormal life and normal social relations were not possible for him....\n\n\"One thing, Mayhem,\" the Firstman said, now, on Neptune. \"How much\nlonger you have in that body of yours?\"\n\n\"Five days. Possibly six.\"\n\n\"That doesn't give you much time. If you're caught out there when your\nmonth is up--\"\n\n\"I won't be. We're wasting time talking about it.\"\n\n\"--it would mean your death.\"\n\n\"Then let's get started.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Firstman stared at him levelly. \"You're a brave man, Mayhem.\"\n\n\"Let's say I'm not afraid to die. I've been a living dead man for eight\nyears. Come on.\"\n\nOne of the so-called coffins, a tiny one-man ship barely big enough for\na prone man, food concentrates and water, was already waiting at the\nstation spacefield.\n\nTen minutes after hearing about _Mozart's Lady_, without fanfare, Mayhem\nblasted off in pursuit.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMaintaining top speed all the way, House Bartock brought _Mozart's Lady_\nacross almost two billion miles of space from Neptune's to Pluto's orbit\nin three days. He was delighted with the speed. It would have taken the\naverage space-tub ten days to two weeks and, since as far as Bartock\nknew there were nothing but average space-tubs on Neptune, that gave him\na considerable head-start.\n\nIt was Jane Cummings-First Violin who discovered Bartock's identity.\nBartock was studying the star-map at the time and considered himself\nsafe from discovery because he kept the control door of _Mozart's Lady_\nlocked. However, Jane Cummings had established something of a liaison\nwith the pilot outward bound from Earth and Mars, so she had been given\na spare key which she'd kept, secretly, all the time the symphony was on\nTriton. Now, curious about the new pilot for the same reason that the\nminers on Triton had been curious about the symphony, Jane made her way\nforward, inserted her key in the lock, and pushed open the control door.\n\n\"Hello there,\" she said.\n\nHouse Bartock whirled. The turning of a key in the lock had so unnerved\nhim--it was the last thing he expected--that he forgot to shut off the\nstar-map. Its tell-tale evidence glowed on the wall over his head.\n\n\"What do you want?\" he managed to ask politely.\n\n\"Oh, just to say hello.\"\n\n\"You already said it.\"\n\nJane Cummings pouted. \"You needn't bite my head off. What's your name?\nMine's Jane, and I play the violin. It wouldn't hurt you to be polite.\"\n\nBartock nodded, deciding that a little small talk wouldn't hurt if he\ncould keep the girl from becoming suspicious. That was suddenly\nimportant. If this girl had a key to the control room, for all he knew\nthere could be others.\n\n\"My, you have been hurrying,\" Jane said. \"I could tell by the\nacceleration. You must be trying to break the speed records or\nsomething. I'll bet we're almost to Earth--\"\n\nHer voice trailed off and her mouth hung open. At first Bartock didn't\nknow what was the matter. Then he saw where she was staring.\n\nThe star-map.\n\n\"We're not heading for Earth!\" she cried.\n\nBartock walked toward her. \"Give me that key,\" he said. \"You're going to\nhave to stay here with me. Give me that key.\"\n\nJane backed away. \"You--you couldn't be our pilot. If you were--\"\n\n\"The key. I don't want to hurt you.\"\n\nBartock lunged. Jane turned and ran, slamming the door behind her. It\nclanged, and echoed. The echo didn't stop. Bartock, on the point of\nopening the door and sprinting down the companionway after her, stopped.\n\nIt wasn't the echo of metal slamming against metal. It was the radar\nwarning.\n\nEither _Mozart's Lady_ was within dangerous proximity of a meteor, or a\nship was following them.\n\nBartock ran to the radar screen.\n\nThe pip was unmistakable. A ship was following them.\n\nA ship as fast--or faster--than _Mozart's Lady_.\n\nCursing, Bartock did things with the controls. _Mozart's Lady_, already\nstraining, increased its speed. Acceleration flung Bartock back in the\npilot's chair. Pluto loomed dead ahead.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJohnny Mayhem knew at what precise moment he had been discovered, for\nsuddenly the speed of _Mozart's Lady_ increased. Since this had occurred\nan hour and a half after Mayhem had first got a clear pip of the bigger\nship on his radar, it meant he'd been spotted.\n\nProne with his hands stretched forward in the coffin-like experimental\nship, Mayhem worked the controls, exactly matching speed with _Mozart's\nLady_.\n\nHe tried to put himself in the position of the escaped convict. What\nwould he do? His best bet would be to swing in close around Pluto, as\nclose as he dared. Then, on the dark side of the planet, to change his\norbit abruptly and come loose of its gravitational field in a new\ndirection. It was a dangerous maneuver, but since the escaped convict\nnow knew for sure that the tiny ship could match the speed of _Mozart's\nLady_, it was his only hope. The danger was grave: even a first-rate\npilot would try it only as a last resort, for the gravitational pull of\nPluto might upset _Mozart's Lady_'s orbit. If that happened, the best\nthe convict could hope for was an emergency landing. More likely, a\ndeath-crash would result.\n\nSeconds later, Mayhem's thinking was confirmed. _Mozart's Lady_ executed\na sharp turn in space and disappeared behind the white bulk of Pluto.\n\nMayhem swore and followed.\n\n\"He's trying to kill us all!\"\n\n\"He doesn't know how to pilot a ship! We're helpless, helpless!\"\n\n\"Do something, Mrs. Moriarity!\"\n\n\"Now girls, whatever happens, you must keep calm. We can only assume\nthat Jane was right about what she saw, but since none of us can pilot a\nspaceship, we'll have to bide our time....\"\n\n\"Bide our time!\"\n\n\"We're all as good as dead!\"\n\nOne of the girls began screaming.\n\nMrs. Moriarity slapped her. \"I'm sorry, dear. I had to hit you. Your\nbehavior bordered on the hysterical. And if we become hysterical we are\nlost, lost, do you understand?\"\n\n\"Yes'm.\"\n\n\"Good. Then we wait and see what happens.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhat was happening was an attempt at what test-pilots term\nplanet-swinging. Moving in the direction of Pluto's orbit, _Mozart's\nLady_ swung in very close behind the planet. Then, as the rotation of\nPluto on its axis hurled it forth again, as a sling-shot hurls a pellet,\n_Mozart's Lady_'s rockets would alter the expected direction of flight.\nUnless a pursuing ship followed exactly the same maneuver, it would be\nflung off into space at top-speed in the wrong direction. It might be\nhours before the first ship's trail could be picked up again--if ever.\n\nHouse Bartock, aware of all this--and one other factor--sat sweating it\nout at the controls.\n\nThe one other factor was closeness to Pluto. For if you got too close,\nand the difference was only a matter of miles covered in an elapsed time\nof mili-seconds, Pluto might drag you into a landing orbit. If that\nhappened, traveling at tremendous speed, there'd be the double danger of\noverheating in the planet's atmosphere and coming down too hard. Either\nway the results could be fatal.\n\nHis hands sweating, Bartock struggled with the controls. Now already he\ncould see Pluto bulking, its night-side black and mysterious, in the\nviewport. Now he could hear the faint shrill scream of its atmosphere.\nNow....\n\nTrying to time it perfectly, he slammed on full power.\n\nA fraction of a mili-second too late.\n\n_Mozart's Lady_ stood for an instant on its tail, shuddering as if it\nwere going to come apart and rain meteoric dust over Pluto's surface.\nThat had happened too in such a maneuver, but it didn't happen now.\n\nInstead, _Mozart's Lady_ went into a landing orbit.\n\nBut its speed was still terrific and, lowering, it whizzed twice around\nPluto's fifteen thousand mile circumference in twenty minutes.\nAtmosphere screamed, the heat siren shrilled, and a cursing House\nBartock applied the braking rockets as fast as he could.\n\nPluto's surface blurred in the viewport, coming closer at dizzying\nspeed. Bartock stood _Mozart's Lady_ on its tail a second time, this\ntime on purpose.\n\nThe ship shuddered, and struck Pluto.\n\nBartock blacked out.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen Mayhem's radar screen informed him that _Mozart's Lady_ had failed\nto break free of Pluto's field of gravity, Mayhem immediately went to\nwork. First he allowed the tiny scout-ship to complete its planet-swing\nsuccessfully, then he slowed down, turned around in deep space, and came\nback, scanning Pluto with radar scopes and telescope until he located\nthe bigger ship. That might have taken hours or days ordinarily, but\nhaving seen _Mozart's Lady_ go in, and having recorded its position via\nradar, Mayhem had a pretty good idea as to the landing orbit it would\nfollow.\n\nIt took him three-quarters of an hour to locate the bigger ship. When he\nfinally had located it, he brought it into close-up with the more\npowerful of the two telescopes aboard the scout.\n\n_Mozart's Lady_ lay on its side in a snow-tundra. It had been damaged,\nbut not severely. Part of the visible side was caved in, but the ship\nhad not fallen apart. Still, chances were that without extensive repairs\nit would not be able to leave Pluto.\n\nThere was no way, Mayhem knew, of making extensive repairs on Pluto.\n_Mozart's Lady_ was there to stay.\n\nThe safe thing to do would be to inform Neptune and wait in space until\nthe police cruisers came for House Bartock. The alternative was to\nplanetfall near _Mozart's Lady_, take the convict into custody, and then\nnotify Neptune.\n\nIf Bartock were alone the choice would have been an easy one. But\nBartock was not alone. He had a hundred girls with him. He was\ndesperate. He might try anything.\n\nMayhem had to go down after him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe trouble was, though, that of all the worlds in the galaxy--not\nmerely in Sol System--Pluto was the one most dangerous to Johnny Mayhem.\nHe had been pursuing House Bartock for three days. Which meant he had\ntwo days left before it was imperative that he leave his current body.\nThis would mean notifying the hub of the Galaxy by sub-space radio to\npull out his _elan_, but Pluto's heavyside layer was the strongest in\nthe solar system, so strong that sub-space radio couldn't penetrate it.\n\nAnd that was not the only thing wrong with Pluto. It was, in fact, an\nincredible anomaly of a world. Almost four billion miles from the sun at\nits widest swing, it still was not too cold to support life. Apparently\nradioactive heat in its core kept it warm. It even had an Earth-type\natmosphere, although the oxygen-content was somewhat too rich and apt to\nmake you giddy. And it was a slow world.\n\nTime moved slowly on Pluto. Too slowly. When you first landed, according\nto the few explorers who had attempted it, the native fauna seemed like\nstatues. Their movement was too slow for the eye to register. That was\nlucky, for the fauna tended to be enormous and deadly. But after a\nwhile--how long a while Mayhem didn't know--the fauna, subjectively,\nseemed to speed up. The animals commenced moving slowly, then a bit\nfaster, then normally. That, Mayhem knew, was entirely subjective. The\nanimals of Pluto were not changing their rate of living: the visitor to\nPluto was slowing down to match their laggard pace.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTwo days, thought Mayhem. That was all he had. And, hours after he\nlanded, he'd start to slow down. There was absolutely no way of telling\nhow much time elapsed once that happened, for the only clocks that did\nnot go haywire on Pluto were spring-wind clocks, and there hadn't been a\nspring-wind clock in the solar system for a hundred and fifty years.\n\nResult? On Pluto Mayhem would slow down. Once he reached Pluto's normal\ntime rate it might take him, say, ten minutes to run--top-speed--from\npoint A to point B, fifteen yards apart. Subjectively, a split-second of\ntime would have gone by in that period.\n\nTwo days would seem like less than an hour, and Mayhem would have no way\nof judging how much less.\n\nIf he didn't get off Pluto in two days he would die.\n\nIf he didn't land, House Bartock, growing desperate and trying to scare\nhim off or trying to keep control of the hundred girls while he made a\ndesperate and probably futile attempt to repair the damaged _Mozart's\nLady_, might become violent.\n\nMayhem called Neptune, and said: \"Bartock crash-landed on Pluto,\ngeographical coordinates north latitude thirty-three degrees four\nminutes, west longitude eighteen degrees even. I'm going down. That's\nall.\"\n\nHe didn't wait for an answer.\n\nHe brought the space-bound coffin down a scant three miles from\n_Mozart's Lady_. Here, though, the tundra of Pluto was buckled and\nconvoluted, so that two low jagged ranges of snow-clad hills separated\nthe ships.\n\nAgain Mayhem didn't wait. He went outside, took a breath of\nnear-freezing air, and stalked up the first range of hills. He carried a\nblaster buckled to his belt.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen he saw the scout-ship come down, Bartock didn't wait either. He\nmight have waited had he known anything about what Pluto did to the\ntime-sense. But he did not know. He only knew, after a quick inspection,\nthat the controls of _Mozart's Lady_ had been so badly damaged that\nrepair was impossible.\n\nHe knew too that the scout-ship had reported his whereabouts. He had, on\nregaining consciousness, been in time to intercept the radio message.\nTrue, it would take any other Neptune-stationed ship close to two weeks\nto reach Pluto, so Bartock had some temporal leeway. But obviously\nwhoever was pursuing him in the one-man ship had not come down just to\nsit and wait. He was out there in the snow somewhere. Well, Bartock\nwould go out too, would somehow manage to elude his pursuer, to get\nbehind him, reach the scout-ship and blast off in it. And, in the event\nthat anything went wrong, he would have a hostage.\n\nHe went arearships to select one.\n\nWent with his desperation shackled by an iron nerve.\n\nAnd a blaster in his hand.\n\n\"... very lucky,\" Matilda Moriarity was saying, trying to keep the\ndespair from her voice. \"We have some cuts and bruises, but no serious\ncasualties. Why, we might have all been killed.\"\n\n\"Lucky, she says! We're marooned here. Marooned--with a killer.\"\n\nBefore the widow Moriarity could defend her choice of words, if she was\ngoing to defend them, House Bartock came into the rear lounge, where the\nentire symphony and its chaperone was located. They would have locked\nthe door, of course; they had locked it ever since they had learned who\nBartock was. But the door, buckled and broken, had been one of the\ncasualties of the crash-landing.\n\n\"You,\" Bartock said.\n\nHe meant Jane Cummings.\n\n\"Me?\"\n\n\"Yes, you. We're going outside.\"\n\n\"Out--side?\"\n\n\"That's what I said. Let's get a move on.\"\n\nJane Cummings didn't move.\n\nThe widow Moriarity came between her and Bartock. \"If you must take\nanyone, take me,\" she said bravely.\n\n\"The girl.\"\n\nStill the widow Moriarity didn't move.\n\nHouse Bartock balled his fist and hit her. Three of the girls caught her\nas she fell. None of them tried to do anything about Bartock, who had\nlevelled his blaster at Jane Cummings.\n\nTrembling, she went down the companionway with him.\n\nA fierce cold wind blew as they opened the airlock door.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt looked like a sea-serpent floundering in the snow.\n\nOnly, it was caught in the act of floundering, like an excellent candid\nshot of a sea-serpent floundering in snow.\n\nIts movements were too slow for Mayhem's eyes to register.\n\nWhich meant, he realized gratefully, that he hadn't begun to slow down\nyet.\n\nHe had to be careful, though. If he were Bartock he would make\nimmediately for the scout-ship. It would be his only hope.\n\nRealizing this, Mayhem had gone through deep snow for what he judged to\nbe fifteen minutes, until he had reached a spine of rock protruding from\nthe snow. Then he had doubled back, now leaving no footprints, along the\nspine. He was waiting in the first low range of hills not four hundred\nyards from the scout-ship, his blaster ready. When Bartock prowled into\nview, Mayhem would shout a warning. If Bartock didn't heed it, Mayhem\nwould shoot him dead.\n\nIt seemed like an airtight plan.\n\nAnd it would have been, except for two things. First, Bartock had a\nhostage. And second, Pluto-time was beginning to act on Mayhem.\n\nHe realized this when he looked at the sea-serpent again. The long neck\nmoved with agonizing slowness, the great gray green bulk of the monster,\nsixty feet long, shifted slowly, barely perceptibly, in the snow.\nMountains of powdery snow moved and settled. The spade-shaped head\npointed at Mayhem. The tongue protruded slowly, hung suspended, forked\nand hideous, then slowly withdrew.\n\nThe neck moved again, ten feet long, sinuous. And faster.\n\nFaster? Not really.\n\nMayhem was slowing down.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen he saw Bartock and the girl.\n\nThey were close together. Bartock held her arm. Walking toward the\nscout-ship, they were too far away and too close together for Mayhem to\nfire. Bartock would know this and wouldn't heed any warning.\n\n[Illustration: Mayhem was blocked. The gun was useless.]\n\nSo Mayhem didn't give any warning. He left the spine of rock and rushed\ndown through the snow toward the space-bound coffin.\n\nA low rumble of sound broke the absolute stillness.\n\nIt was the monster, and now that his own hearing had slowed down, Mayhem\nwas able to hear the slower cycles of sound. How much time had really\npassed? He didn't know. How much time did he have left before death came\nswiftly and suddenly because he had been too long in his temporary body?\nHe didn't know that either. He sprinted toward the scout-ship. At least\nit felt like he was sprinting. He didn't know how fast he was really\nmoving. But the sea-serpent creature was coming up behind him, faster.\nNo place near what would have been its normal apparent speed, but\nfaster. Mayhem, his breath coming raggedly through his mouth, ran as\nfast as was feasible.\n\nSo did Bartock and the girl.\n\nIt was Bartock, spotting Mayhem on the run, who fired first. Mayhem\nfell prone as the raw _zing_ of energy ripped past. The\nsea-serpent-like-creature behind him bellowed.\n\nAnd reared.\n\nIt didn't look like a sea-serpent any longer. It looked like a dinosaur,\nwith huge solid rear limbs, small forelimbs, a great head with an\nenormous jaw--and speed.\n\nNow it could really move.\n\nSubjectively, time seemed normal to Mayhem. Your only basis was\nsubjective: time always seemed normal. But Mayhem knew, as he got up and\nran again, that he was now moving slower than the minute hand on a\nclock. Slower ... as objective time, as measured in the solar system at\nlarge, sped by.\n\nHe tripped as the creature came behind him. The only thing he could do\nwas prop up an elbow in the snow and fire. Raw energy ripped off the two\ntiny forelimbs, but the creature didn't falter. It rushed by Mayhem,\nalmost crushing him with the hind limbs, each of which must have weighed\na couple of tons. It lumbered toward Bartock and Jane Cummings.\n\nTurning and starting to get up, Mayhem fired again.\n\nHis blaster jammed.\n\nThen the bulk of the monster cut off his view of Bartock, the girl and\nthe scout-ship. He heard the girl scream. He ran toward them.\n\nJane Cummings had never been so close to death. She wanted to scream.\nShe thought all at once, hysterically, she was a little girl again. If\nshe screamed maybe the terrible apparition would go away. But it did not\ngo away. It reared up high, as high as a very tall tree, and its fangs\nwere hideous.\n\nBartock, who was also frightened, raised his blaster, fired, and missed.\n\nThen, for an instant, Jane thought she saw someone running behind the\nmonster. He had a blaster too, and he lifted it. When he fired, there\nwas only a clicking sound. Then he fired again.\n\nHalf the monster's bulk disappeared and it collapsed in the snow.\n\nThat was when Bartock shot the other man.\n\nMayhem felt the stab of raw energy in his shoulder. He spun around and\nfell down, his senses whirling in a vortex of pain. Dimly he was aware\nof Bartock's boots crunching on the snow.\n\nThey fired simultaneously. Bartock missed.\n\nAnd collapsed with a searing hole in his chest. He was dead before he\nhit the snow.\n\nThe girl went to Mayhem. \"Who--who are you?\"\n\n\"Got to get you back to the ship. No time to talk. Hurry.\"\n\n\"But you can't walk like that. You're badly hurt. I'll bring help.\"\n\n\"... dangerous. I'll take you.\"\n\nHe'd take her, flirting with death. Because, for all he knew, his time\non Pluto, objectively, had already totalled forty-eight hours. If it\ndid, he would never live to get off Pluto. Once his thirty days were up,\nhe would die. Still, there might be danger from other animals between\nthe scout-ship and _Mozart's Lady_, and he couldn't let the girl go back\nalone. It was almost ludicrous, since she had to help him to his feet.\n\nHe staggered along with her, knowing he would never make it to _Mozart's\nLady_ and back in time. But if he left her, she was probably doomed too.\nHe'd sacrifice his life for hers....\n\nThey went a hundred yards, Mayhem gripping the blaster and advancing by\nsheer effort of will. Then he smiled, and began to laugh. Jane thought\nhe was hysterical with pain. But he said: \"We're a pair of bright ones.\nThe scout-ship.\"\n\nInside, it was very small. They had to lie very close to each other, but\nthey made it. They reached _Mozart's Lady_.\n\nMayhem didn't wait to say good-bye. With what strength remained to him,\nhe almost flung the girl from the scout-ship. The pain in his shoulder\nwas very bad, but that wasn't what worried him. What worried him was the\nroaring in his ears, the vertigo, the mental confusion as his _elan_\ndrifted, its thirty days up, toward death.\n\nHe saw the girl enter _Mozart's Lady_. He blasted off, and when the\nspace-bound coffin pierced Pluto's heavyside layer, he called the Hub.\n\nThe voice answered him as if it were mere miles away, and not halfway\nacross a galaxy: \"Good Lord, man. You had us worried! You have about ten\nseconds. Ten seconds more and you would have been dead.\"\n\nMayhem was too tired to care. Then he felt a wrenching pain, and all at\nonce his _elan_ floated, serene, peaceful, in limbo. He had been plucked\nfrom the dying body barely in time, to fight mankind's lone battle\nagainst the stars again, wherever he was needed ... out beyond Pluto.\n\nForever? It wasn't impossible.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of World Beyond Pluto, by C. H.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
