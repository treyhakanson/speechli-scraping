When the\ndirector finally led him outside, Mr. Sims realized with a slight\ntwinge of fear that he hadn't really expected to see daylight again.\n\nThey were in the rich, rolling parkland at the rear of the palace and\nwalking across the immaculate turf where colored fountains frolicked\nand shimmered in the sun. Lilting music floated out from a dozen hidden\nsources. The two men sat down on a seat facing the palace with its\ntowering columns and vast marble steps.\n\n\"It's a very nice place,\" Mr. Sims commented, remembering that he\nhadn't said a word for at least five minutes.\n\n\"I suppose it's all right,\" Arthur Hoode agreed, his thin nostrils\ntwitching condescendingly. He was a small, sleek man with a habit of\nemphasizing his words with airy gestures of his slim hands. \"That\nsection of the palace is the part I consider most uninteresting. After\nall, there's nothing but row upon row of stuffy little rooms where\npeople come to die. And they take a long time doing it, too!\"\n\nMr. Sims winced noticeably.\n\n\"You'll forgive me if I don't appear overly sanctimonious about death,\"\nMr. Hoode said, smiling. \"It's just that the other directors and\nmyself decided we must take a realistic view of the situation. A place\nlike this could become pretty morbid, you know, and there's actually\nno reason why a guest's last hours here shouldn't be pleasant and\nsatisfying.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPleasant and satisfying--the key words when you spoke of Sunnylands\nPalace, Mr. Sims thought grimly. Everyone used them--when not going\nthere.\n\nThe words gave him a hollow, frightened feeling inside, perhaps because\nthey made him remember the first time he had heard them used.\n\n\"It's a pleasant place and quite satisfying,\" Dr. Van Stoke had said.\n\"There's no need to think of it as some kind of torture camp.\"\n\n\"But why should I go there at all?\" Mr. Sims had asked. \"I don't want\nto die. I'm only fifty-six and I've got nine more years left.\"\n\n\"Try and understand I'm doing you a good turn,\" the doctor had said.\n\"You've lived fifty-six _good_ years; in your condition, the last nine\nwon't be so good. You'll have pains, attacks, you won't be able to do\nanything strenuous. You'll hate to live under those conditions.\"\n\n\"I could always give it a try,\" Mr. Sims had protested.\n\nDr. Van Stoke had frowned bleakly over the tops of his glasses. \"I know\nI'm a friend and family doctor,\" the frown had said, \"but I'm also\nDistrict Referee under the Euthanasian Legislation and you are becoming\na burden to society. So don't make my job any more difficult.\"\n\nHe had signed his name at the bottom of the form.\n\nAnd Mr. Sims had had a hollow, anxious feeling ever since.\n\n\"There's one thing I haven't found out yet,\" he said to Mr. Hoode. \"Is\nit in order for me to ask how and when I can expect to die?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" Mr. Hoode said. \"It's the reason I brought you here to\ntalk. You see, anyone sent here under the Legislation is given a\ncompletely free choice as to the manner of his departure. Most people,\nalthough they realize this, show a distressing lack of imagination when\nthe time comes. They seem unable to think beyond the ordinary methods\nof taking a pill, or a needle, or a poisoned cocktail.\"\n\n\"I can't say I'd thought about it, either,\" Mr. Sims admitted.\n\n\"We have a service to assist you,\" said the director. \"We of the\nSunnylands staff have discovered what you might call a Philosophy of\nDying. For instance, if a man lives an active life, there's no reason\nwhy he should be subjected to a sneaking prick of a needle in his\nsleep just because he reaches the age of sixty-five. We discovered\nthat a few people objected strongly to such methods. There are some\npeople who would prefer to die fighting. We had a couple who chose the\nfiring squad, for instance. Another desired the guillotine and nothing\nwould satisfy him but a ride to his fate in a real tumbril. Because of\nthese--ah--pioneers, our advisory bureau has been set up.\"\n\n\"You mean you obliged them ... with a guillotine and everything?\" Mr.\nSims asked.\n\n\"Certainly, though most choose the sneaking, cowardly way out. As\nfar as I am concerned, they died as they lived--ignominously! It's\ndepressing. We have the best accommodation, food, entertainment,\neverything the guest requires during his three days here; then they go\nahead and die their miserable deaths. Somehow it makes all the luxury\nseem like pink sugar frosting around a rotten cake. That's why we're\nalways happy to find a guest with the proper spirit.\" Mr. Hoode said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMr. Sims listened in silence to the sales talk, wondering\nabsent-mindedly what the director's personal interest was in other\npeople's death.\n\n\"I took the liberty of looking up your record,\" Mr. Hoode continued. \"I\npicked you out for a personal talk because I see you led an interesting\nlife.\" He paused in recollection with a theatrically thoughtful finger\npressed to his chin, his eyes gazing skyward. \"You made a small fortune\nin oil in Central America before you were twenty. That was followed\nby more success in hemelium mining in Northern Canada. An excellent\nThird World War record, too. Founder of Transcontinental Rocket Lines.\nCo-builder of the Venus rocket. Oh, and a dozen other things. Quite a\ncareer!\"\n\nMr. Sims brightened a little. He smiled modestly.\n\n\"Too bad you had to come here at fifty-six,\" Mr. Hoode remarked.\n\"Heaven knows what you might have done with those last nine years.\nHeart trouble, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"So I've been told,\" Mr. Sims said, slipping back into his former glum\nmood. He still did not believe he was a sick man, but perhaps this was\nbecause things had moved too fast and he had not been given enough time\nto get used to the idea.\n\n\"It's a serious cardiac condition,\" Dr. Van Stoke had told him at the\nannual examination, \"due to an over-active life. I'll have to recommend\nyou for Sunnylands.\"\n\nAnd that had been the first mention of the subject.\n\n\"But I never had heart trouble in my life!\"\n\n\"The graphs show the condition clearly. There's nothing anyone can do\nto remedy it. I'll have to submit your name.\"\n\nHe had protested--threatened--pleaded.\n\n\"Overpopulation! Elimination of needless suffering! Burden to society!\nDuty to humanity!\" The cliches had tripped glibly off the doctor's\ntongue as he signed the form. \"Will you please send in a member of the\nfamily? I'll give him the final instructions. Save you the trouble of\nworrying over little details during the final weeks.\"\n\nSince then, things had moved more swiftly behind the scenes and he\nhad had to do nothing except prepare himself--or adopt a realistic\nattitude, as Mr. Hoode would have described it. But he had lived too\nmuch to allow him to get used to the idea of dying in two short weeks.\nHe hadn't even started to get realistic about it, which was probably\nwhy he could sit talking so calmly about death at that moment.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"We could give your life a climax,\" the director was saying. \"A man\nlike you shouldn't just fade away in one of those little cubicles.\" He\nwaved a hand in the direction of the shaded windows at the rear of the\npalace. \"You should die magnificently!\"\n\n\"Magnificently?\" Mr. Sims repeated. \"What did you have in mind?\"\n\n\"It's what _you_ have in mind that counts. I can offer you a lot of\nadvice, but the final choice is yours. For instance, a large number of\nmen like to die in some sort of combat, with guns or swords, or even\nwith animals. We had one man who fought a tiger. Another fulfilled a\nlife-long ambition to play the role of bullfighter. Perhaps I should\nexplain that the government allows each guest a generous sum of money\nto pay for his departure. As most people do not use one hundredth of\nthis sum, we have a rather large fund at the disposal of those who want\nto use it.\n\n\"The bullfighter was a good example,\" he went on. \"We had a large ring\nbuilt for him. He was given horses, uniforms, picadores, and a bull\nspecially imported from Spain. It was a wonderful afternoon.\" He paused\nin contemplation of the memory, while Mr. Sims looked on, tactfully\nrefraining from asking the outcome.\n\n\"Another time, we had a group of old soldiers who wanted to die in\nbattle,\" Mr. Hoode added. \"We built them an old-fashioned concrete\nblockhouse, then gave them authentic uniforms, machine-guns, grenades\nand rifles, and had one group attacking and the other defending.\"\n\n\"Did they actually volunteer for that?\" Mr. Sims asked.\n\n\"Of course, and I'll swear they enjoyed every minute of it. Right down\nto the last man. As a matter of fact, we're planning the same thing on\na larger scale with a re-enactment of Custer's Last Stand to be held in\n2013. One of the men in Research is working full time on that project.\nSo far, we have a tentative list of 138 names. It'll be held in the\npark over there.\" He waved gaily in the direction of the quiet meadow\nwhich would one day become another Little Big Horn.\n\nMr. Sims moved along the seat slightly, as though his companion had\nstarted to smell. It was as if, for the first time, he had noticed the\nglazed, visionary look in Mr. Hoode's eye. The director, he realized,\nwould be capable of re-enacting Hiroshima if given the required number\nof volunteers.\n\n\"I'll have to leave you, I'm afraid,\" said Mr. Hoode, standing up. \"But\nif you'd like to think the matter over some more, I can offer you a\nfine selection of books to read about famous deaths, duels, acts of\nheroism and such throughout history.\"\n\n\"It's an interesting notion,\" Mr. Sims said. \"I'll think about it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMr. Sims tried to avoid the director all that day and all the\nfollowing morning. He tried hard to convince himself that this was\nbecause he disliked the other's bloodthirsty tendencies, although he\nknew the truth was that his choice of departure was a cowardly one.\nNevertheless, he argued with himself, it was his choice, his death,\nand his mind was made up. Besides, he felt lonely and this might be an\nopportunity to see the family again, even though they probably wouldn't\nlike it.\n\nIt was the director who finally located Mr. Sims. \"Are you enjoying\nyour stay here?\" he asked heartily. Mr. Sims winced as though the cold\nhand of death itself had slapped him on the back.\n\n\"Have you come to any decision yet?\"\n\nMr. Sims nodded. \"Yes, I looked at the book last night and decided on\nSocrates. Just a simple cup of hemlock.\"\n\nA slight frown shadowed the director's features. Was it contempt, Mr.\nSims wondered, or disappointment because he had failed in his attempts\nto make poisoning seem a socially inferior way of dying? Nothing\nglamorous about such a departure, he realized. No disdainful refusal\nof the blindfold when gazing bravely into the leveled muzzles of the\nfiring squad. No bullfight, armed combat, duel or ferocious carnivores.\n\nThe director shrugged. \"Well, it's tranquil and dignified, I suppose,\"\nhe conceded finally. Then the practical streak in his nature came to\nthe forefront and his mind ran quickly over the possibilities. \"If I\nremember correctly, Socrates died in the company of a number of good\nfriends. They discussed philosophy.\"\n\n\"I'll have my family instead. I've no idea what we'll talk about. Their\nnames are on this list.\"\n\n\"It's irregular--\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, I want them here.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Mr. Hoode, disappointed. \"I'll send for them today.\nI'll also see the lab about some hemlock and something authentic to\nhold it in--an amphora or whatever the Greeks used. By the way, I'm not\ntoo well acquainted with Socrates. Are there any unusual details?\"\n\n\"If there are, forget them,\" Mr. Sims said. \"The family and the hemlock\nwill be sufficient.\"\n\nMr. Hoode sniffed peevishly. \"As you wish. Be ready tomorrow.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe rough woven garment was a concession to Mr. Hoode, who said it was\nGrecian, and Mr. Sims wore it to make up for any annoyance he may have\ncaused the director. It was rather itchy and much too warm, he thought,\nas he waited by the fountain at the far end of the park. The hemlock\nwas in a bronze goblet on the parapet beside him. The family would be\nhere soon. He wondered how they would feel about being dragged way out\nhere.\n\nThey arrived a half hour later: Cousin Nat, his two nephews, George and\nAlec, their wives, and George's five-year-old, Mike. Mr. Hoode was also\nwith them, but he left the party as soon as he had shown them where Mr.\nSims was waiting.\n\nThe meeting was restrained. Clearly they were not happy about making\nthe trip. There were no smiles of greeting; only young Mike showed any\ndistinct interest. He sat down at Mr. Sims' feet, playing havoc with\nthe lawn with a toy dagger.\n\n\"Where's the poison, Grandpa?\" he asked eagerly.\n\nMr. Sims lifted the boy up on to his knee and rumpled his hair\nplayfully in a feeble attempt to ease the tension. The others stood\naround silently watching. No one made any move to sit down. It was\ntheir way of telling him they hoped they wouldn't have to wait too\nlong. Mr. Sims suddenly wished he were in one of the quiet rooms of the\npalace, alone.\n\nCousin Nat was the first one to break the awkward silence. \"Who in hell\nwas that madman who brought us over here?\"\n\n\"That's Mr. Hoode, the director,\" Mr. Sims explained. \"He's quite an\nartist in his way.\"\n\n\"He's insane!\" Nat said flatly. \"All the way over, he talked about\nnothing but dying. Told us we could come here and die any way we\nwanted. If any of us wanted to go out like Early Christians, he would\nbe only too happy to set up an arena for us. He even asked me if I\nwanted to put my name down for a rehash of Custer's Last Stand for\n2013. With real bullets!\" He passed his hand nervously through his\nthinning hair. \"For God's sake, he must think I _want_ to get scalped!\"\n\n\"Didn't Dr. Van Stoke come with you?\" Mr. Sims asked. \"I wanted him to\nsee the place he sends everyone.\"\n\n\"He went on an ocean cruise,\" young Mike said.\n\n\"Dr. Van Stoke? You mean he left his practice?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" the little boy answered. \"Another doctor took his place.\"\n\nMr. Sims turned to the others for corroboration. \"Is that right? I\ndidn't think Van Stoke was a rich man. He was only around forty.\"\n\n\"He went with the money Uncle Nat gave him,\" the boy said.\n\n\"That'll be enough, Michael,\" Nat ordered sternly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMr. Sims laughed. \"You're mistaken, Mike. Uncle Nat wouldn't give the\ndoctor any money. He hasn't even got enough for himself.\"\n\n\"But he quit his job yesterday,\" said the boy.\n\nNat's voice cut in sharply. \"That's enough from you. You know what they\nsay about little boys.\"\n\nMr. Sims looked steadily at Nat as though seeing him for the first\ntime. His cousin gazed back, half-sullen, half-defiant.\n\n\"It certainly didn't take you long to get your hands on the money,\" Mr.\nSims said. \"It looks as if I can't die soon enough. But I still don't\nsee where Dr. Van Stoke comes into--\"\n\nThen suddenly there was no need to ask. The answer was clear on Nat's\ntight, sullen face.\n\nMr. Sims turned to the others for help and froze as identical\nexpressions stared back coldly from each of them, piercing him with\ntheir long-hidden envy of his success, their pent-up hatred of their\ndependence on him.\n\nA choking, frightened sound came from deep in Mr. Sims' throat. \"For\nGod's sake! _How much did you pay him to put me away?_\"\n\nHe jumped quickly off the parapet, knocking the little boy to the\nground, and hurled the hemlock into the fountain. He pushed his way\npast them and started to run. Then the woven garment twisted about his\nlegs. He tried to lift it clear, but his foot caught in the hem and he\nstumbled.\n\nNat was the first to move. He picked up the little toy dagger and fell\non the struggling man. Without hesitating, he plunged the knife between\nMr. Sims' shoulder blades and held it till the older man was still.\nThen he stabbed again, without malice, without any emotion ... again\nand again.... The blade made an odd ripping sound each time it pierced\nthe woven robe.\n\nAll of them looked away. One of the women leaned over the parapet, sick.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen he was finally done, Nat stood up and cleaned the knife on the\ngrass and then motioned them all back toward the palace.\n\nMr. Hoode met them as they walked through the foyer. \"Ah, Socrates'\nfriends!\" he said to Nat, who was dabbing at the front of his coat with\na piece of tissue. \"Was everything in order?\"\n\n\"There was a slight change of plan,\" Nat said. \"He decided at the last\nmoment to make it Julius Caesar.\" He held the knife up in explanation.\n\n\"_Julius Caesar!_ But--\"\n\nBut they were gone, filing out through the front door, the women\nsobbing in their handkerchiefs. No one looked back.\n\nThe door hissed quietly shut. Mr. Hoode started at the sound and then\nwalked slowly into his office, seized by a cold, limp rage. From his\nwindow, he could see them going down the driveway.\n\n\"Amateurs,\" he spat after them with deep disgust. \"Damned, lousy,\nunimaginative amateurs!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Amateurs, by Alan Cogan\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE AMATEURS ***\n\n***** This file should be named 51081.txt or 51081.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/1/0/8/51081/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
