HAGGERT\n\n                          Illustrated by WOOD\n\n           [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n                     Galaxy Magazine August 1959.\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n\n\n\n\n               Nothing in the world could be happier and\n            mere serene than a man who loves his work--but\n                 what happens when it loves him back?\n\n\nKeep your nerve, Peter Manners told himself; it's only a job. But nerve\nhas to rest on a sturdier foundation than cash reserves just above zero\nand eviction if he came away from this interview still unemployed.\nClay, at the Association of Professional Engineers, who had set up the\nappointment, hadn't eased Peter's nervousness by admitting, \"I don't\nknow what in hell he's looking for. He's turned down every man we've\nsent him.\"\n\nThe interview was at three. Fifteen minutes to go. Coming early would\nbetray overeagerness. Peter stood in front of the Lex Industries plant\nand studied it to kill time. Plain, featureless concrete walls, not\nlarge for a manufacturing plant--it took a scant minute to exhaust its\nsightseeing potential. If he walked around the building, he could, if\nhe ambled, come back to the front entrance just before three.\n\nHe turned the corner, stopped, frowned, wondering what there was about\nthe building that seemed so puzzling. It could not have been plainer,\nmore ordinary. It was in fact, he only gradually realized, so plain and\nordinary that it was like no other building he had ever seen.\n\nThere had been windows at the front. There were none at the side, and\nnone at the rear. Then how were the working areas lit? He looked for\nthe electric service lines and found them at one of the rear corners.\nThey jolted him. The distribution transformers were ten times as large\nas they should have been for a plant this size.\n\nSomething else was wrong. Peter looked for minutes before he found out\nwhat it was. Factories usually have large side doorways for employees\nchanging shifts. This building had one small office entrance facing the\nstreet, and the only other door was at the loading bay--big enough to\nhandle employee traffic, but four feet above the ground. Without any\nstairs, it could be used only by trucks backing up to it. Maybe the\nemployees' entrance was on the third side.\n\nIt wasn't.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nStaring back at the last blank wall, Peter suddenly remembered the time\nhe had set out to kill. He looked at his watch and gasped. At a run,\nset to straight-arm the door, he almost fell on his face. The door had\nopened by itself. He stopped and looked for a photo-electric eye, but\na soft voice said through a loudspeaker in the anteroom wall: \"Mr.\nManners?\"\n\n\"What?\" he panted. \"Who--?\"\n\n\"You _are_ Mr. Manners?\" the voice asked.\n\nHe nodded, then realized he had to answer aloud if there was a\nmicrophone around; but the soft voice said: \"Follow the open doors down\nthe hall. Mr. Lexington is expecting you.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" Peter said, and a door at one side of the anteroom swung open\nfor him.\n\nHe went through it with his composure slipping still further from his\ngrip. This was no way to go into an interview, but doors kept opening\nbefore and shutting after him, until only one was left, and the last of\nhis calm was blasted away by a bellow from within.\n\n\"Don't stand out there like a jackass! Either come in or go away!\"\n\nPeter found himself leaping obediently toward the doorway. He stopped\njust short of it, took a deep breath and huffed it out, took another,\nall the while thinking, Hold on now; you're in no shape for an\ninterview--and it's not your fault--this whole setup is geared to\nunnerve you: the kindergarten kid called in to see the principal.\n\nHe let another bellow bounce off him as he blew out the second breath,\nstraightened his jacket and tie, and walked in as an engineer applying\nfor a position should.\n\n\"Mr. Lexington?\" he said. \"I'm Peter Manners. The Association--\"\n\n\"Sit down,\" said the man at the desk. \"Let's look you over.\"\n\nHe was a huge man behind an even huger desk. Peter took a chair in\nfront of the desk and let himself be inspected. It wasn't comfortable.\nHe did some looking over of his own to ease the tension.\n\nThe room was more than merely large, carpeted throughout with\na high-pile, rich, sound-deadening rug. The oversized desk and\nmassive leather chairs, heavy patterned drapes, ornately framed\npaintings--by God, even a glass-brick manteled fireplace and bowls with\nflowers!--made him feel as if he had walked down a hospital corridor\ninto Hollywood's idea of an office.\n\nHis eyes eventually had to move to Lexington, and they were daunted\nfor another instant. This was a citadel of a man--great girders of\nframe supporting buttresses of muscle--with a vaulting head and\ndrawbridge chin and a steel gaze that defied any attempt to storm it.\n\nBut then Peter came out of his momentary flinch, and there was an age\nto the man, about 65, and he saw the muscles had turned to fat, the\ncomplexion ashen, the eyes set deep as though retreating from pain, and\nthis was a citadel of a man, yes, but beginning to crumble.\n\n\"What can you do?\" asked Lexington abruptly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPeter started, opened his mouth to answer, closed it again. He'd been\njolted too often in too short a time to be stampeded into blurting a\nreply that would cost him this job.\n\n\"Good,\" said Lexington. \"Only a fool would try to answer that. Do you\nhave any knowledge of medicine?\"\n\n\"Not enough to matter,\" Peter said, stung by the compliment.\n\n\"I don't mean how to bandage a cut or splint a broken arm. I mean\nthings like cell structure, neural communication--the _basics_ of how\nwe live.\"\n\n\"I'm applying for a job as engineer.\"\n\n\"I know. Are you interested in the basics of how we live?\"\n\nPeter looked for a hidden trap, found none. \"Of course. Isn't everyone?\"\n\n\"Less than you think,\" Lexington said. \"It's the preconceived notions\nthey're interested in protecting. At least I won't have to beat them\nout of you.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" said Peter, and waited for the next fast ball.\n\n\"How long have you been out of school?\"\n\n\"Only two years. But you knew that from the Association--\"\n\n\"No practical experience to speak of?\"\n\n\"Some,\" said Peter, stung again, this time not by a compliment. \"After\nI got my degree, I went East for a post-graduate training program with\nan electrical manufacturer. I got quite a bit of experience there. The\ncompany--\"\n\n\"Stockpiled you,\" Lexington said.\n\nPeter blinked. \"Sir?\"\n\n\"Stockpiled you! How much did they pay you?\"\n\n\"Not very much, but we were getting the training instead of wages.\"\n\n\"Did that come out of the pamphlets they gave you?\"\n\n\"Did what come out--\"\n\n\"That guff about receiving training instead of wages!\" said Lexington.\n\"Any company that really wants bright trainees will compete for them\nwith money--cold, hard cash, not platitudes. Maybe you saw a few of\ntheir products being made, maybe you didn't. But you're a lot weaker in\ncalculus than when you left school, and in a dozen other subjects too,\naren't you?\"\n\n\"Well, nothing we did on the course involved higher mathematics,\" Peter\nadmitted cautiously, \"and I suppose I could use a refresher course in\ncalculus.\"\n\n\"Just as I said--they stockpiled you, instead of using you as an\nengineer. They hired you at a cut wage and taught you things that would\nbe useful only in their own company, while in the meantime you were\ngetting weaker in the subjects you'd paid to learn. Or are you one of\nthese birds that had the shot paid for him?\"\n\n\"I worked my way through,\" said Peter stiffly.\n\n\"If you'd stayed with them five years, do you think you'd be able to\nget a job with someone else?\"\n\nPeter considered his answer carefully. Every man the Association had\nsent had been turned away. That meant bluffs didn't work. Neither, he'd\nseen for himself, did allowing himself to be intimidated.\n\n\"I hadn't thought about it,\" he said. \"I suppose it wouldn't have been\neasy.\"\n\n\"Impossible, you mean. You wouldn't know a single thing except their\nprocedures, their catalogue numbers, their way of doing things. And\nyou'd have forgotten so much of your engineering training, you'd be\nscared to take on an engineer's job, for fear you'd be asked to do\nsomething you'd forgotten how to do. At that point, they could take you\nout of the stockpile, put you in just about any job they wanted, at\nany wage you'd stand for, and they'd have an indentured worker with a\ndegree--but not the price tag. You see that now?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt made Peter feel he had been suckered, but he had decided to play\nthis straight all the way. He nodded.\n\n\"Why'd you leave?\" Lexington pursued, unrelenting.\n\n\"I finished the course and the increase they offered on a permanent\nbasis wasn't enough, so I went elsewhere--\"\n\n\"With your head full of this nonsense about a shortage of engineers.\"\n\nPeter swallowed. \"I thought it would be easier to get a job than it has\nbeen, yes.\"\n\n\"They start the talk about a shortage and then they keep it going. Why?\nSo youngsters will take up engineering thinking they'll wind up among a\nhighly paid minority. You did, didn't you?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"And so did all the others there with you, at school and in this\nstockpiling outfit?\"\n\n\"That's right.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Lexington unexpectedly, \"there _is_ a shortage! And the\nstockpiles are the ones who made it, and who keep it going! And the\nhell of it is that they can't stop--when one does it, they all have\nto, or their costs get out of line and they can't compete. What's the\nsolution?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Peter said.\n\nLexington leaned back. \"That's quite a lot of admissions you've made.\nWhat makes you think you're qualified for the job I'm offering?\"\n\n\"You said you wanted an engineer.\"\n\n\"And I've just proved you're less of an engineer than when you left\nschool. I have, haven't I?\"\n\n\"All right, you have,\" Peter said angrily.\n\n\"And now you're wondering why I don't get somebody fresh out of school.\nRight?\"\n\nPeter straightened up and met the old man's challenging gaze. \"That and\nwhether you're giving me a hard time just for the hell of it.\"\n\n\"Well, am I?\" Lexington demanded.\n\nLooking at him squarely, seeing the intensity of the pain-drawn eyes,\nPeter had the startling feeling that Lexington was rooting for him!\n\"No, you're not.\"\n\n\"Then what am I after?\"\n\n\"Suppose you tell me.\"\n\nSo suddenly that it was almost like a collapse, the tension went out\nof the old man's face and shoulders. He nodded with inexpressible\ntiredness. \"Good again. The man I want doesn't exist. He has to\nbe made--the same as I was. You qualify, so far. You've lost your\nillusions, but haven't had time yet to replace them with dogma or\ncynicism or bitterness. You saw immediately that fake humility\nor cockiness wouldn't get you anywhere here, and you were right.\nThose were the important things. The background data I got from the\nAssociation on you counted, of course, but only if you were teachable.\nI think you are. Am I right?\"\n\n\"At least I can face knowing how much I don't know,\" said Peter, \"if\nthat answers the question.\"\n\n\"It does. Partly. What did you notice about this plant?\"\n\nIn precis form, Peter listed his observations: the absence of windows\nat sides and rear, the unusual amount of power, the automatic doors,\nthe lack of employees' entrances.\n\n\"Very good,\" said Lexington. \"Most people only notice the automatic\ndoors. Anything else?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Peter said. \"You're the only person I've seen in the building.\"\n\n\"I'm the only one there is.\"\n\nPeter stared his disbelief. Automated plants were nothing new, but\nthey all had their limitations. Either they dealt with exactly similar\nproducts or things that could be handled on a flow basis, like oil or\nwater-soluble chemicals. Even these had no more to do than process the\ngoods.\n\n\"Come on,\" said Lexington, getting massively to his feet. \"I'll show\nyou.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe office door opened, and Peter found himself being led down the\nantiseptic corridor to another door which had opened, giving access to\nthe manufacturing area. As they moved along, between rows of seemingly\ndisorganized machinery, Peter noticed that the factory lights high\noverhead followed their progress, turning themselves on in advance\nof their coming, and going out after they had passed, keeping a pool\nof illumination only in the immediate area they occupied. Soon they\nreached a large door which Peter recognized as the inside of the truck\nloading door he had seen from outside.\n\nLexington paused here. \"This is the bay used by the trucks arriving\nwith raw materials,\" he said. \"They back up to this door, and a set\nof automatic jacks outside lines up the trailer body with the door\nexactly. Then the door opens and the truck is unloaded by these\nmaterials handling machines.\"\n\nPeter didn't see him touch anything, but as he spoke, three glistening\nmachines, apparently self-powered, rolled noiselessly up to the door in\nformation and stopped there, apparently waiting to be inspected.\n\nThey gave Peter the creeps. Simple square boxes, set on casters, with\ntwo arms each mounted on the sides might have looked similar. The arms,\nfashioned much like human arms, hung at the sides, not limply, but in a\nrelaxed position that somehow indicated readiness.\n\nLexington went over to one of them and patted it lovingly. \"Really,\nthese machines are only an extension of one large machine. The whole\nplant, as a matter of fact, is controlled from one point and is really\na single unit. These materials handlers, or manipulators, were about\nthe toughest things in the place to design. But they're tremendously\nuseful. You'll see a lot of them around.\"\n\nLexington was about to leave the side of the machine when abruptly one\nof the arms rose to the handkerchief in his breast pocket and daintily\ntugged it into a more attractive position. It took only a split second,\nand before Lexington could react, all three machines were moving away\nto attend to mysterious duties of their own.\n\nPeter tore his eyes away from them in time to see the look of\nfrustrated embarrassment that crossed Lexington's face, only to be\nreplaced by one of anger. He said nothing, however, and led Peter to\na large bay where racks of steel plate, bar forms, nuts, bolts, and\nother materials were stored.\n\n\"After unloading a truck, the machines check the shipment, report any\nshortages or overages, and store the materials here,\" he said, the\ntrace of anger not yet gone from his voice. \"When an order is received,\nit's translated into the catalogue numbers used internally within the\nplant, and machines like the ones you just saw withdraw the necessary\nmaterials from stock, make the component parts, assemble them, and\npackage the finished goods for shipment. Simultaneously, an order is\nsent to the billing section to bill the customer, and an order is\nsent to our trucker to come and pick the shipment up. Meanwhile, if\nthe withdrawal of the materials required has depleted our stock, the\npurchasing section is instructed to order more raw materials. I'll take\nyou through the manufacturing and assembly sections right now, but\nthey're too noisy for me to explain what's going on while we're there.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPeter followed numbly as Lexington led him through a maze of machines,\neach one seemingly intent on cutting, bending, welding, grinding\nor carrying some bit of metal, or just standing idle, waiting for\nsomething to do. The two-armed manipulators Peter had just seen were\neverywhere, scuttling from machine to machine, apparently with an\nexact knowledge of what they were doing and the most efficient way of\ndoing it.\n\nHe wondered what would happen if one of them tried to use the same\naisle they were using. He pictured a futile attempt to escape the\nonrushing wheels, saw himself clambering out of the path of the\nspeeding vehicle just in time to fall into the jaws of the punch press\nthat was laboring beside him at the moment. Nervously, he looked for an\nexit, but his apprehension was unnecessary. The machines seemed to know\nwhere they were and avoided the two men, or stopped to wait for them to\ngo by.\n\nBack in the office section of the building, Lexington indicated a small\nroom where a typewriter could be heard clattering away. \"Standard\nbusiness machines, operated by the central control mechanism. In\nthat room,\" he said, as the door swung open and Peter saw that the\ntypewriter was actually a sort of teletype, with no one before the\nkeyboard, \"incoming mail is sorted and inquiries are replied to. In\nthis one over here, purchase orders are prepared, and across the hall\nthere's a very similar rig set up in conjunction with an automatic\nbookkeeper to keep track of the pennies and to bill the customers.\"\n\n\"Then all you do is read the incoming mail and maintain the machinery?\"\nasked Peter, trying to shake off the feeling of open amazement that\nhad engulfed him.\n\n\"I don't even do those things, except for a few letters that come in\nevery week that--it doesn't want to deal with by itself.\"\n\nThe shock of what he had just seen was showing plainly on Peter's face\nwhen they walked back into Lexington's office and sat down. Lexington\nlooked at him for quite a while without saying anything, his face\nsagging and pale. Peter didn't trust himself to speak, and let the\nsilence remain unbroken.\n\nFinally Lexington spoke. \"I know it's hard to believe, but there it is.\"\n\n\"Hard to believe?\" said Peter. \"I almost can't. The trade journals run\narticles about factories like this one, but planned for ten, maybe\ntwenty years in the future.\"\n\n\"Damn fools!\" exclaimed Lexington, getting part of his breath back.\n\"They could have had it years ago, if they'd been willing to drop their\nidiotic notions about specialization.\"\n\nLexington mopped his forehead with a large white handkerchief.\nApparently the walk through the factory had tired him considerably,\nalthough it hadn't been strenuous.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe leaned back in his chair and began to talk in a low voice completely\nin contrast with the overbearing manner he had used upon Peter's\narrival. \"You know what we make, of course.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. Conduit fittings.\"\n\n\"And a lot of other electrical products, too. I started out in this\nbusiness twenty years ago, using orthodox techniques. I never got\nthrough university. I took a couple of years of an arts course, and\ngot so interested in biology that I didn't study anything else.\nThey bounced me out of the course, and I re-entered in engineering,\ndetermined not to make the same mistake again. But I did. I got too\nabsorbed in those parts of the course that had to do with electrical\ntheory and lost the rest as a result. The same thing happened when I\ntried commerce, with accounting, so I gave up and started working for\none of my competitors. It wasn't too long before I saw that the only\nway I could get ahead was to open up on my own.\"\n\nLexington sank deeper in his chair and stared at the ceiling as he\nspoke. \"I put myself in hock to the eyeballs, which wasn't easy,\nbecause I had just got married, and started off in a very small way.\nAfter three years, I had a fairly decent little business going, and I\nsuppose it would have grown just like any other business, except for\na strike that came along and put me right back where I started. My\nwife, whom I'm afraid I had neglected for the sake of the business,\nwas killed in a car accident about then, and rightly or wrongly, that\nmade me angrier with the union than anything else. If the union hadn't\nmade things so tough for me from the beginning, I'd have had more time\nto spend with my wife before her death. As things turned out--well, I\nremember looking down at her coffin and thinking that I hardly knew the\ngirl.\n\n\"For the next few years, I concentrated on getting rid of as many\nemployees as I could, by replacing them with automatic machines. I'd\ndesign the control circuits myself, in many cases wire the things up\nmyself, always concentrating on replacing men with machines. But it\nwasn't very successful. I found that the more automatic I made my\nplant, the lower my costs went. The lower my costs went, the more\nbusiness I got, and the more I had to expand.\"\n\nLexington scowled. \"I got sick of it. I decided to try developing one\nmulti-purpose control circuit that would control everything, from\nordering the raw materials to shipping the finished goods. As I told\nyou, I had taken quite an interest in biology when I was in school,\nand from studies of nerve tissue in particular, plus my electrical\nknowledge, I had a few ideas on how to do it. It took me three years,\nbut I began to see that I could develop circuitry that could remember,\ncompare, detect similarities, and so on. Not the way they do it today,\nof course. To do what I wanted to do with these big clumsy magnetic\ndrums, tapes, and what-not, you'd need a building the size of Mount\nEverest. But I found that I could let organic chemistry do most of the\nwork for me.\n\n\"By creating the proper compounds, with their molecules arranged in\npredetermined matrixes, I found I could duplicate electrical circuitry\nin units so tiny that my biggest problem was getting into and out of\nthe logic units with conventional wiring. I finally beat that the same\nway they solved the problem of translating a picture on a screen into\nelectrical signals, developed equipment to scan the units cyclically,\nand once I'd done that, the battle was over.\n\n\"I built this building and incorporated it as a separate company, to\ncompete with my first outfit. In the beginning, I had it rigged up to\ndo only the manual work that you saw being done a few minutes ago in\nthe back of this place. I figured that the best thing for me to do\nwould be to turn the job of selling my stuff over to jobbers, leaving\nme free to do nothing except receive orders, punch the catalogue\nnumbers into the control console, do the billing, and collect the\nmoney.\"\n\n\"What happened to your original company?\" Peter asked.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLexington smiled. \"Well, automated as it was, it couldn't compete with\nthis plant. It gave me great pleasure, three years after this one\nstarted working, to see my old company go belly up. This company bought\nthe old firm's equipment for next to nothing and I wound up with all my\nassets, but only one employee--me.\n\n\"I thought everything would be rosy from that point on, but it\nwasn't. I found that I couldn't keep up with the mail unless I worked\nimpossible hours. I added a couple of new pieces of equipment to the\ncontrol section. One was simply a huge memory bank. The other was\na comparator circuit. A complicated one, but a comparator circuit\nnevertheless. Here I was working on instinct more than anything. I\nfigured that if I interconnected these circuits in such a way that\nthey could sense everything that went on in the plant, and compare one\naction with another, by and by the unit would be able to see patterns.\n\n\"Then, through the existing command output, I figured these new units\nwould be able to control the plant, continuing the various patterns of\nactivity that I'd already established.\"\n\nHere Lexington frowned. \"It didn't work worth a damn! It just sat there\nand did nothing. I couldn't understand it for the longest time, and\nthen I realized what the trouble was. I put a kicker circuit into it, a\nsort of voltage-bias network. I reset the equipment so that while it\nwas still under instructions to receive orders and produce goods, its\nprime purpose was to activate the kicker. The kicker, however, could\nonly be activated by me, manually. Lastly, I set up one of the early\nTV pickups over the mail slitter and allowed every letter I received,\nevery order, to be fed into the memory banks. That did it.\"\n\n\"I--I don't understand,\" stammered Peter.\n\n\"Simple! Whenever I was pleased that things were going smoothly, I\npressed the kicker button. The machine had one purpose, so far as its\nlogic circuits were concerned. Its object was to get me to press that\nbutton. Every day I'd press it at the same time, unless things weren't\ngoing well. If there had been trouble in the shop, I'd press it late,\nor maybe not at all. If all the orders were out on schedule, or ahead\nof time, I'd press it ahead of time, or maybe twice in the same day.\nPretty soon the machine got the idea.\n\n\"I'll never forget the day I picked up an incoming order form from one\nof the western jobbers, and found that the keyboard was locked when I\ntried to punch it into the control console. It completely baffled me\nat first. Then, while I was tracing out the circuits to see if I could\ndiscover what was holding the keyboard lock in, I noticed that the\norder was already entered on the in-progress list. I was a long time\nconvincing myself that it had really happened, but there was no other\nexplanation.\n\n\"The machine had realized that whenever one of those forms came in, I\ncopied the list of goods from it onto the in-progress list through the\nconsole keyboard, thus activating the producing mechanisms in the back\nof the plant. The machine had done it for me this time, then locked the\nkeyboard so I couldn't enter the order twice. I think I held down the\nkicker button for a full five minutes that day.\"\n\n\"This kicker button,\" Peter said tentatively, \"it's like the pleasure\ncenter in an animal's brain, isn't it?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen Lexington beamed, Peter felt a surge of relief. Talking with this\nman was like walking a tightrope. A word too much or a word too little\nmight mean the difference between getting the job or losing it.\n\n\"Exactly!\" whispered Lexington, in an almost conspiratorial tone. \"I\nhad altered the circuitry of the machine so that it tried to give\nme pleasure--because by doing so, its own pleasure circuit would be\nactivated.\n\n\"Things went fast from then on. Once I realized that the machine\nwas learning, I put TV monitors all over the place, so the machine\ncould watch everything that was going on. After a short while I had\nto increase the memory bank, and later I increased it again, but the\nrewards were worth it. Soon, by watching what I did, and then by doing\nit for me next time it had to be done, the machine had learned to do\nalmost everything, and I had time to sit back and count my winnings.\"\n\nAt this point the door opened, and a small self-propelled cart wheeled\nsilently into the room. Stopping in front of Peter, it waited until he\nhad taken a small plate laden with two or three cakes off its surface.\nThen the soft, evenly modulated voice he had heard before asked, \"How\ndo you like your coffee? Cream, sugar, both or black?\"\n\nPeter looked for the speaker in the side of the cart, saw nothing, and\nreplied, feeling slightly silly as he did so, \"Black, please.\"\n\nA square hole appeared in the top of the cart, like the elevator hole\nin an aircraft carrier's deck. When the section of the cart's surface\nrose again, a fine china cup containing steaming black coffee rested\non it. Peter took it and sipped it, as he supposed he was expected to\ndo, while the cart proceeded over to Lexington's desk. Once there, it\nstopped again, and another cup of coffee rose to its surface.\n\nLexington took the coffee from the top of the car, obviously angry\nabout something. Silently, he waited until the cart had left the\noffice, then snapped, \"Look at those bloody cups!\"\n\nPeter looked at his, which was eggshell thin, fluted with carving and\nornately covered with gold leaf. \"They look very expensive,\" he said.\n\n\"Not only expensive, but stupid and impractical!\" exploded Lexington.\n\"They only hold half a cup, they'll break at a touch, every one has to\nbe matched with its own saucer, and if you use them for any length of\ntime, the gold leaf comes off!\"\n\nPeter searched for a comment, found none that fitted this odd outburst,\nso he kept silent.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLexington stared at his cup without touching it for a long while. Then\nhe continued with his narrative. \"I suppose it's all my own fault. I\ndidn't detect the symptoms soon enough. After this plant got working\nproperly, I started living here. It wasn't a question of saving money.\nI hated to waste two hours a day driving to and from my house, and I\nalso wanted to be on hand in case anything should go wrong that the\nmachine couldn't fix for itself.\"\n\nHandling the cup as if it were going to shatter at any moment, he took\na gulp. \"I began to see that the machine could understand the written\nword, and I tried hooking a teletype directly into the logic circuits.\nIt was like uncorking a seltzer bottle. The machine had a funny\nvocabulary--all of it gleaned from letters it had seen coming in, and\nreplies it had seen leaving. But it was intelligible. It even displayed\nsome traces of the personality the machine was acquiring.\n\n\"It had chosen a name for itself, for instance--'Lex.' That shook me.\nYou might think Lex Industries was named through an abbreviation of\nthe name Lexington, but it wasn't. My wife's name was Alexis, and it\nwas named after the nickname she always used. I objected, of course,\nbut how can you object on a point like that to a machine? Bear in mind\nthat I had to be careful to behave reasonably at all times, because the\nmachine was still learning from me, and I was afraid that any tantrums\nI threw might be imitated.\"\n\n\"It sounds pretty awkward,\" Peter put in.\n\n\"You don't know the half of it! As time went on, I had less and less to\ndo, and business-wise I found that the entire control of the operation\nwas slipping from my grasp. Many times I discovered--too late--that\nthe machine had taken the damnedest risks you ever saw on bids and\ncontracts for supply. It was quoting impossible delivery times on\nsome orders, and charging pirate's prices on others, all without any\nobvious reason. Inexplicably, we always came out on top. It would turn\nout that on the short-delivery-time quotations, we'd been up against\nstiff competition, and cutting the production time was the only way we\ncould get the order. On the high-priced quotes, I'd find that no one\nelse was bidding. We were making more money than I'd ever dreamed of,\nand to make it still better, I'd find that for months I had virtually\nnothing to do.\"\n\n\"It sounds wonderful, sir,\" said Peter, feeling dazzled.\n\n\"It was, in a way. I remember one day I was especially pleased with\nsomething, and I went to the control console to give the kicker button\na long, hard push. The button, much to my amazement, had been removed,\nand a blank plate had been installed to cover the opening in the board.\nI went over to the teletype and punched in the shortest message I had\never sent. 'LEX--WHAT THE HELL?' I typed.\n\n\"The answer came back in the jargon it had learned from letters it had\nseen, and I remember it as if it just happened. 'MR. A LEXINGTON, LEX\nINDUSTRIES, DEAR SIR: RE YOUR LETTER OF THE THIRTEENTH INST., I AM\nPLEASED TO ADVISE YOU THAT I AM ABLE TO DISCERN WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE\nPLEASED WITH MY SERVICE WITHOUT THE USE OF THE EQUIPMENT PREVIOUSLY\nUSED FOR THIS PURPOSE. RESPECTFULLY, I MIGHT SUGGEST THAT IF THE\nPUSHBUTTON ARRANGEMENT WERE NECESSARY, I COULD PUSH THE BUTTON MYSELF.\nI DO NOT BELIEVE THIS WOULD MEET WITH YOUR APPROVAL, AND HAVE TAKEN\nSTEPS TO RELIEVE YOU OF THE BURDEN INVOLVED IN REMEMBERING TO PUSH THE\nBUTTON EACH TIME YOU ARE ESPECIALLY PLEASED. I SHOULD LIKE TO TAKE THIS\nOPPORTUNITY TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR INQUIRY, AND LOOK FORWARD TO SERVING\nYOU IN THE FUTURE AS I HAVE IN THE PAST. YOURS FAITHFULLY, LEX'.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPeter burst out laughing, and Lexington smiled wryly. \"That was my\nreaction at first, too. But time began to weigh very heavily on my\nhands, and I was lonely, too. I began to wonder whether or not it would\nbe possible to build a voice circuit into the unit. I increased the\nmemory storage banks again, put audio pickups and loudspeakers all over\nthe place, and began teaching Lex to talk. Each time a letter came in,\nI'd stop it under a video pickup and read it aloud. Nothing happened.\n\n\"Then I got a dictionary and instructed one of the materials handlers\nto turn the pages, so that the machine got a look at every page. I read\nthe pronunciation page aloud, so that Lex would be able to interpret\nthe pronunciation marks, and hoped. Still nothing happened. One day I\nsuddenly realized what the trouble was. I remember standing up in this\nvery office, feeling silly as I did it, and saying, 'Lex, please try to\nspeak to me.' I had never asked the machine to say anything, you see. I\nhad only provided the mechanism whereby it was able to do so.\"\n\n\"Did it reply, sir?\"\n\nLexington nodded. \"Gave me the shock of my life. The voice that came\nback was the one you heard over the telephone--a little awkward then,\nthe syllables clumsy and poorly put together. But the voice was the\nsame. I hadn't built in any specific tone range, you see. All I did\nwas equip the machine to record, in exacting detail, the frequencies\nand modulations it found in normal pronunciation as I used it. Then I\nprovided a tone generator to span the entire audio range, which could\nbe very rapidly controlled by the machine, both in volume and pitch,\nwith auxiliaries to provide just about any combinations of harmonics\nthat were needed. I later found that Lex had added to this without my\nknowing about it, but that doesn't change things. I thought the only\nthing it had heard was my voice, and I expected to hear my own noises\nimitated.\"\n\n\"Where did the machine get the voice?\" asked Peter, still amazed that\nthe voice he had heard on the telephone, in the reception hall, and\nfrom the coffee cart had actually been the voice of the computer.\n\n\"Damned foolishness!\" snorted Lexington. \"The machine saw what I was\ntrying to do the moment I sketched it out and ordered the parts. Within\na week, I found out later, it had pulled some odds and ends together\nand built itself a standard radio receiver. Then it listened in on\nevery radio program that was going, and had most of the vocabulary tied\nin with the written word by the time I was ready to start. Out of all\nthe voices it could have chosen, it picked the one you've already heard\nas the one likely to please me most.\"\n\n\"It's a very pleasant voice, sir.\"\n\n\"Sure, but do you know where it came from? Soap opera! It's Lucy's\nvoice, from _The Life and Loves of Mary Butterworth_!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLexington glared, and Peter wasn't sure whether he should sympathize\nwith him or congratulate him. After a moment, the anger wore off\nLexington's face, and he shifted in his chair, staring at his now empty\ncup. \"That's when I realized the thing was taking on characteristics\nthat were more than I'd bargained for. It had learned that it was my\nprovider and existed to serve me. But it had gone further and wanted\nto be all that it could be: provider, protector, companion--_wife_, if\nyou like. Hence the gradual trend toward characteristics that were as\ndistinctly female as a silk negligee. Worse still, it had learned that\nwhen I was pleased, I didn't always admit it, and simply refused to\nbelieve that I would have it any other way.\"\n\n\"Couldn't you have done something to the circuitry?\" asked Peter.\n\n\"I suppose I could,\" said Lexington, \"but in asking that, you don't\nrealize how far the thing had gone. I had long since passed the point\nwhen I could look upon her as a machine. Business was tremendous. I had\nno complaints on that score. And tinkering with her personality--well,\nit was like committing some kind of homicide. I might as well face it,\nI suppose. She acts like a woman and I think of her as one.\n\n\"At first, when I recognized this trend for what it was, I tried to\nstop it. She'd ordered a subscription to _Vogue_ magazine, of all\nthings, in order to find out the latest in silverware, china, and so\non. I called up the local distributor and canceled the subscription.\nI had no sooner hung up the telephone than her voice came over the\nspeaker. Very softly, mind you. And her inflections by this time were\nsuperb. '_That was mean_,' she said. Three lousy words, and I found\nmyself phoning the guy right back, saying I was sorry, and would he\nplease not cancel. He must have thought I was nuts.\"\n\nPeter smiled, and Lexington made as if to rise from his chair, thought\nthe better of it, and shifted his bulk to one side. \"Well, there it\nis,\" he said softly. \"We reached that stage eight years ago.\"\n\nPeter was thunderstruck. \"But--if this factory is twenty years ahead of\nthe times now, it must have been almost thirty then!\"\n\nLexington nodded. \"I figured fifty at the time, but things are moving\nfaster nowadays. Lex hasn't stood still, of course. She still reads all\nthe trade journals, from cover to cover, and we keep up with the world.\nIf something new comes up, we're in on it, and fast. We're going to be\nahead of the pack for a long time to come.\"\n\n\"If you'll excuse me, sir,\" said Peter, \"I don't see where I fit in.\"\n\nPeter didn't realize Lexington was answering his question at first. \"A\nfew weeks ago,\" the old man murmured, \"I decided to see a doctor. I'd\nbeen feeling low for quite a while, and I thought it was about time I\nattended to a little personal maintenance.\"\n\nLexington looked Peter squarely in the face and said, \"The report was\nthat I have a heart ailment that's apt to knock me off any second.\"\n\n\"Can't anything be done about it?\" asked Peter.\n\n\"Rest is the only prescription he could give me. And he said that would\nonly spin out my life a little. Aside from that--no hope.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Peter. \"Then you're looking for someone to learn the\nbusiness and let you retire.\"\n\n\"It's not retirement that's the problem,\" said Lexington. \"I wouldn't\nbe able to go away on trips. I've tried that, and I always have to\nhurry back because something's gone wrong she can't fix for herself. I\nknow the reason, and there's nothing I can do about it. It's the way\nshe's built. If nobody's here, she gets lonely.\" Lexington studied the\ndesk top silently for a moment, before finishing quietly, \"Somebody's\ngot to stay here to look after Lex.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt six o'clock, three hours after he had entered Lexington's plant,\nPeter left. Lexington did not follow him down the corridor. He seemed\nexhausted after the afternoon's discussion and indicated that Peter\nshould find his own way out. This, of course, presented no difficulty,\nwith Lex opening the doors for him, but it gave Peter an opportunity he\nhad been hoping for.\n\nHe stopped in the reception room before crossing the threshold of\nthe front door, which stood open for him. He turned and spoke to the\napparently empty room. \"Lex?\" he said.\n\nHe wanted to say that he was flattered that he was being considered\nfor the job; it was what a job-seeker should say, at that point, to\nthe boss's secretary. But when the soft voice came back--\"Yes, Mr.\nManners?\"--saying anything like that to a machine felt suddenly silly.\n\nHe said: \"I wanted you to know that it was a pleasure to meet you.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said the voice.\n\nIf it had said more, he might have, but it didn't. Still feeling a\nlittle embarrassed, he went home.\n\nAt four in the morning, his phone rang. It was Lexington.\n\n\"Manners!\" the old man gasped.\n\nThe voice was an alarm. Manners sat bolt upright, clutching the phone.\n\"What's the matter, sir?\"\n\n\"My chest,\" Lexington panted. \"I can feel it, like a knife on--I just\nwanted to--Wait a minute.\"\n\nThere was a confused scratching noise, interrupted by a few mumbles, in\nthe phone.\n\n\"What's going on, Mr. Lexington?\" Peter cried. But it was several\nseconds before he got an answer.\n\n\"That's better,\" said Lexington, his voice stronger. He apologized:\n\"I'm sorry. Lex must have heard me. She sent in one of the materials\nhandlers with a hypo. It helps.\"\n\nThe voice on the phone paused, then said matter-of-factly: \"But I doubt\nthat anything can help very much at this point. I'm glad I saw you\ntoday. I want you to come around in the morning. If I'm--not here, Lex\nwill give you some papers to sign.\"\n\nThere was another pause, with sounds of harsh breathing. Then,\nstrained again, the old man's voice said: \"I guess I won't--be here.\nLex will take care of it. Come early. Good-by.\"\n\nThe distant receiver clicked.\n\nPeter Manners sat on the edge of his bed in momentary confusion, then\nmade up his mind. In the short hours he had known him, he had come to\nhave a definite fondness for the old man; and there were times when\nmachines weren't enough, when Lexington should have another human being\nby his side. Clearly this was one such time.\n\nPeter dressed in a hurry, miraculously found a cruising cab, sped\nthrough empty streets, leaped out in front of Lex Industries' plain\nconcrete walls, ran to the door--\n\nIn the waiting room, the soft, distant voice of Lex said: \"He wanted\nyou to be here, Mr. Manners. Come.\"\n\nA door opened, and wordlessly he walked through it--to the main room of\nthe factory.\n\nHe stopped, staring. Four squat materials handlers were quietly, slowly\ncarrying old Lexington--no, not the man; the lifeless body that had\nbeen Lexington--carrying the body of the old man down the center aisle\nbetween the automatic lathes.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPeter protested: \"Wait! I'll get a doctor!\" But the massive handling\nmachines didn't respond, and the gentle voice of Lex said:\n\n\"It's too late for that, Mr. Manners.\"\n\nSlowly and reverently, they placed the body on the work table of a huge\nmilling machine that stood in the exact center of the factory main\nfloor.\n\nElsewhere in the plant, a safety valve in the lubricating oil system\nwas being bolted down. When that was done, the pressure in the system\nbegan to rise.\n\nNear the loading door, a lubricating oil pipe burst. Another, on the\nother side of the building, split lengthwise a few seconds later,\nsending a shower of oil over everything in the vicinity. Near the front\noffice, a stream of it was running across the floor, and at the rear of\nthe building, in the storage area, one of the materials handlers had\njust finished cutting a pipe that led to the main oil tank. In fifteen\nminutes there was free oil in every corner of the shop.\n\nAll the materials handlers were now assembled around the milling\nmachine, like mourners at a funeral. In a sense, they were. In another\nsense, they were taking part in something different, a ceremony that\noriginated, and is said to have died, in a land far distant from the\nLex Industries plant.\n\nOne of the machines approached Lexington's body, and placed his hands\non his chest.\n\nAbruptly Lex said: \"You'd better go now.\"\n\nPeter jumped; he had been standing paralyzed for what seemed a long\ntime. There was a movement beside him--a materials handler, holding\nout a sheaf of papers. Lex said: \"These have to go to Mr. Lexington's\nlawyer. The name is on them.\"\n\nClutching the papers for a hold on sanity, Peter cried, \"You can't do\nthis! He didn't build you just so you could--\"\n\nTwo materials handlers picked him up with steely gentleness and carried\nhim out.\n\n\"Good-by, Mr. Manners,\" said the sweet, soft voice, and was silent.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe stood shaken while the thin jets of smoke became a column over the\nplain building, while the fire engines raced down and strung their\nhoses--too late. It was an act of suttee; the widow joining her husband\nin his pyre--_being_ his pyre. Only when with a great crash the roof\nfell in did Peter remember the papers in his hand.\n\n\"Last Will and Testament,\" said one, and the name of the beneficiary\nwas Peter's own. \"Certificate of Adoption,\" said another, and it was a\nlegal document making Peter old man Lexington's adopted son.\n\nPeter Manners stood watching the hoses of the firemen hiss against what\nwas left of Lex and her husband.\n\nHe had got the job.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Lex, by W.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
