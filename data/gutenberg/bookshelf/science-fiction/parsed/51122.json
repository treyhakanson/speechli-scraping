Bands of the Male Society occupied the outermost\nfour of these interconnected corridors and patrolled it with their\nfull strength, twenty-three young adult males in the prime of courage\nand alertness. They were stationed there to take the first shock of\nany danger to Mankind, they and their band captains and the youthful\ninitiates who served them.\n\nEric the Only was an initiate in this powerful force. Today, he was a\nstudent warrior, a fetcher and a carrier for proven, seasoned men. But\ntomorrow, tomorrow....\n\nThis was his birthday. Tomorrow, he would be sent forth to Steal for\nMankind. When he returned--and have no fear: Eric was swift, Eric was\nclever, he would return--off might go the loose loin cloths of boyhood\nto be replaced by the tight loin straps of a proud Male Society warrior.\n\nHe would be free to raise his voice and express his opinions in the\nCouncils of Mankind. He could stare at the women whenever he liked,\nfor as long as he liked, to approach them even--\n\nHe found himself wandering to the end of his band's burrow, still\ncarrying the spear he was sharpening for his uncle. There, where a\nwomen's burrow began, several members of the Female Society were\npreparing food stolen from the Monster larder that very day. Each spell\nhad to be performed properly, each incantation said just right, or\nit would not be fit to eat. It might even be dangerous. Mankind was\nindeed fortunate: plenty of food, readily available, and women who well\nunderstood the magical work of preparing it for human consumption.\n\nAnd such women--such splendid creatures!\n\nSarah the Sickness-Healer, for example, with her incredible knowledge\nof what food was fit and what was unfit, her only garment a cloud of\nhair that alternately screened and revealed her hips and breasts, the\nlargest in all Mankind. There was a woman for you! Over five litters\nshe had had, two of them of maximum size.\n\nEric watched as she turned a yellow chunk of food around and around\nunder the glow lamp hanging from the ceiling of the burrow, looking for\nshe only knew what and recognizing it when she found it she only knew\nhow. A man could really strut with such a mate.\n\nBut she was the wife of a band leader and far, far beyond him. Her\ndaughter, though, Selma the Soft-Skinned, would probably be flattered\nby his attentions. She still wore her hair in a heavy bun: it would\nbe at least a year before the Female Society would consider her an\ninitiate and allow her to drape it about her nakedness. No, far too\nyoung and unimportant for a man on the very verge of warrior status.\n\nAnother girl caught his eye. She had been observing him for some time\nand smiling behind her lashes, behind her demurely set mouth. Harriet\nthe History-Teller, the oldest daughter of Rita the Record-Keeper,\nwho would one day succeed to her mother's office. Now there was a\nlovely, slender girl, her hair completely unwound in testament to full\nwomanhood and recognized professional status.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEric had caught these covert, barely stated smiles from her before;\nespecially in the last few weeks, as the time for his Theft approached.\nHe knew that if he were successful--and he _had_ to be successful:\ndon't dare think of anything but success!--she would look with favor on\nadvances from him. Of course, Harriet was a redhead, and therefore,\naccording to Mankind's traditions, unlucky. She was probably having a\nhard time finding a mate. But his own mother had been a redhead.\n\nYes, and his mother had been very unlucky indeed.\n\nEven his father had been infected with her terrible bad luck. Still,\nHarriet the History-Teller was an important person in the tribe for one\nher age. Good-looking too. And, above all, she didn't turn away from\nhim. She smiled at him, openly now. He smiled back.\n\n\"Look at Eric!\" he heard someone call out behind him. \"He's already\nsearching for a mate. Hey, Eric! You've not even wearing straps yet.\nFirst comes the stealing. _Then_ comes the mating.\"\n\nEric spun around, bits of fantasy still stuck to his lips.\n\nThe group of young men lounging against the wall of his band's burrow\nwere tossing laughter back and forth between them. They were all\nadults: they had all made their Theft. Socially, they were still his\nsuperiors. His only recourse was cold dignity.\n\n\"I know that,\" he began. \"There is no mating until--\"\n\n\"Until never for some people,\" one of the young men broke in. He\nrattled his spear in his hand, carelessly, proudly. \"After you steal,\nyou still have to convince a woman that you're a man. And some men\nhave to do an awful lot of convincing. An _awful_ lot, Eric-O.\"\n\nThe ball of laughter bounced back and forth again, heavier than before.\nEric the Only felt his face turn bright red. How dare they remind him\nof his birth? On this day of all days? Here he was about to prepare\nhimself to go forth and Steal for Mankind....\n\nHe dropped the sharpening stone into his pouch and slid his right\nhand back along his uncle's spear. \"At least,\" he said, slowly and\ndefinitely, \"at least, my woman will stay convinced, Roy the Runner.\nShe won't be always open to offers from every other man in the tribe.\"\n\n\"You lousy little throwback!\" Roy the Runner yelled. He leaped away\nfrom the rest of the band and into a crouch facing Eric, his spear\ntense in one hand. \"You're asking for a hole in the belly! My woman's\nhad two litters off me, two big litters. What would you have given her,\nyou dirty singleton?\"\n\n\"She's had two litters, but not off you,\" Eric the Only spat, holding\nhis spear out in the guard position. \"If you're the father, then the\nchief's blonde hair is contagious--like measles.\"\n\nRoy bellowed and jabbed his spear forward. Eric parried it and lunged\nin his turn. He missed as his opponent leaped to one side. They\ncircled each other, cursing and insulting, eyes only for the point of\neach other's spears. The other young men had scrambled a distance down\nthe burrow to get out of their way.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA powerful arm suddenly clamped Eric's waist from behind and lifted\nhim off his feet. He was kicked hard, so that he stumbled a half-dozen\nsteps and fell. On his feet in a moment, the spear still in his hand,\nhe whirled, ready to deal with this new opponent. He was mad enough to\nfight all Mankind.\n\nBut not Thomas the Trap-Smasher. No, not that mad.\n\nAll the tension drained out of him as he recognized the captain of his\nband. He couldn't fight Thomas. His uncle. And the greatest of all men.\nGuiltily, he walked to the niche in the wall where the band's weapons\nwere stacked and slid his uncle's spear into its appointed place.\n\n\"What the hell's the matter with you, Roy?\" Thomas was asking behind\nhim. \"Fighting a duel with an initiate? Where's your band spirit?\nThat's all we need these days, to be cut down from six effectives to\nfive. Save your spear for Strangers, or--if you feel very brave--for\nMonsters. But don't show a point in our band's burrow if you know\nwhat's good for you, hear me?\"\n\n\"I wasn't fighting a duel,\" the Runner mumbled, sheathing his own\nspear. \"The kid got above himself. I was punishing him.\"\n\n\"You punish with the haft of the spear. And anyway, this is my band and\nI do the punishing around here. Now move on out, all of you, and get\nready for the council. I'll attend to the boy myself.\"\n\nThey went off obediently without looking back. The Trap-Smasher's band\nwas famous for its discipline throughout the length and breadth of\nMankind. A proud thing to be a member of it. But to be called a boy in\nfront of the others! A boy, when he was full-grown and ready to begin\nstealing!\n\nAlthough, come to think of it, he'd rather be called a boy than a\nsingleton. A boy eventually became a man, but a singleton stayed a\nsingleton forever. He put the problem to his uncle who was at the\nniche, inspecting the band's reserve pile of spears.\n\n\"Isn't it possible--I mean, it is possible, isn't it--that my father\nhad some children by another woman? You told me he was one of the best\nthieves we ever had.\"\n\nThe captain of the band turned to study him, folding his arms across\nhis chest so that biceps swelled into greatness and power. They\nglinted in the light of the tiny lantern bound to his forehead, the\nglow lantern that only fully accredited warriors might wear. After a\nwhile, the older man shook his head and said, very gently:\n\n\"Eric, Eric, forget about it, boy. He was all of those things and more.\nYour father was famous. Eric the Storeroom-Stormer, we called him,\nEric the Laugher at Locks, Eric the Roistering Robber of all Mankind.\nHe taught me everything I know. But he only married once. And if any\nother woman ever played around with him, she's been careful to keep it\na secret. Now dress up those spears. You've let them get all sloppy.\nButts together, that's the way, points up and even with each other.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDutifully, Eric rearranged the bundle of armament that was his\nresponsibility. He turned to his uncle again, now examining the\nknapsacks and canteens that would be carried on the expedition.\n\"Suppose there had been another woman. My father could have had two,\nthree, even four litters by different women. Extra-large litters too.\nIf we could prove something like that, I wouldn't be a singleton any\nmore. I would not be Eric the Only.\"\n\nThe Trap-Smasher sighed and thought for a moment. Then he pulled the\nspear from his back sling and took Eric's arm. He drew the youth along\nthe burrow until they stood alone in the very center of it. He looked\ncarefully at the exits at either end, making certain that they were\ncompletely alone before giving his reply in an unusually low, guarded\nvoice.\n\n\"We'd never be able to prove anything like that. If you don't want to\nbe Eric the Only, if you want to be Eric the something-else, well then,\nit's up to you. You have to make a good Theft. That's what you should\nbe thinking about all the time now--your Theft. Eric, which category\nare you going to announce?\"\n\nHe hadn't thought about it very much. \"The usual one I guess. The one\nthat's picked for most initiations. First category.\"\n\nThe older man brought his lips together, looking dissatisfied. \"First\ncategory. _Food._ Well....\"\n\nEric felt he understood. \"You mean, for someone like me--an Only,\nwho's really got to make a name for himself--I ought to announce\nlike a real warrior? I should say I'm going to steal in the second\ncategory--Articles Useful to Mankind. Is that what my father would have\ndone?\"\n\n\"Do you know what your father would have done?\"\n\n\"No. What?\" Eric demanded eagerly.\n\n\"He'd have elected the third category. That's what I'd be announcing\nthese days, if I were going through an initiation ceremony. That's what\nI want you to announce.\"\n\n\"Third category? Monster souvenirs? But no one's elected the third\ncategory in I don't know how many auld lang synes. Why should I do it?\"\n\n\"Because this is more than just an initiation ceremony. It could be the\nbeginning of a new life for all of us.\"\n\nEric frowned. What could be more than an initiation ceremony and his\nattainment of full thieving manhood?\n\n\"There are things going on in Mankind, these days,\" Thomas the\nTrap-Smasher continued in a strange, urgent voice. \"Big things. And\nyou're going to be a part of them. This Theft of yours--if you handle\nit right, if you do what I tell you, it's likely to blow the lid off\neverything the chief has been sitting on.\"\n\n\"The _chief_?\" Eric felt confused. He was walking up a strange burrow\nnow without a glow lamp. \"What's the chief got to do with my Theft?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis uncle examined both ends of the corridor again. \"Eric, what's the\nmost important thing we, or you, or anyone, can do? What is our life\nall about? What are we here for?\"\n\n\"That's easy,\" Eric chuckled. \"That's the easiest question there is. A\nchild could answer it:\n\n\"_Hit back at the Monsters_,\" he quoted. \"_Drive them from the planet,\nif we can. Regain Earth for Mankind, if we can. But above all, hit back\nat the Monsters. Make them suffer as they've made us suffer. Make them\nknow we're still here, we're still fighting. Hit back at the Monsters._\"\n\n\"Hit back at the Monsters. Right. Now how have we been doing that?\"\n\nEric the Only stared at his uncle. That wasn't the next question in the\ncatechism. He must have heard incorrectly. His uncle couldn't have made\na mistake in such a basic ritual.\n\n\"_We will do that_,\" he went on in the second reply, his voice sliding\ninto the singsong of childhood lessons, \"_by regaining the science and\nknowhow of our fore-fathers. Man was once Lord of all Creation: his\nscience and knowhow made him supreme. Science and knowhow is what we\nneed to hit back at the Monsters._\"\n\n\"Now, Eric,\" his uncle asked gently. \"Please tell me this. What in hell\nis knowhow?\"\n\nThat was way off. They were a full corridor's length from the normal\nprogression of the catechism now.\n\n\"Knowhow is--knowhow is--\" he stumbled over the unfamiliar verbal\nterrain. \"Well, it's what our ancestors knew. And what they did with\nit, I guess. Knowhow is what you need before you can make hydrogen\nbombs or economic warfare or guided missiles, any of those really big\nweapons like our ancestors had.\"\n\n\"Did those weapons do them any good? Against the Monsters, I mean. Did\nthey stop the Monsters?\"\n\nEric looked completely blank for a moment, then brightened. Oh! He knew\nthe way now. He knew how to get back to the catechism:\n\n\"_The suddenness of the attack, the_--\"\n\n\"Stop it!\" his uncle ordered. \"Don't give me any of that garbage! _The\nsuddenness of the attack, the treachery of the Monsters_--does it sound\nlike an explanation to you? Honestly? If our ancestors were really\nLords of Creation and had such great weapons, would the Monsters have\nbeen able to conquer them? I've led my band on dozens of raids, and I\nknow the value of a surprise attack; but believe me, boy, it's only\ngood for a flash charge and a quick getaway if you're facing a superior\nforce. You can knock somebody down when he doesn't expect it. But if he\nreally has more than you, he won't _stay_ down. Right?\"\n\n\"I--I guess so. I wouldn't know.\"\n\n\"Well, I know. I know from plenty of battle experience. The thing to\nremember is that once our ancestors were knocked down, they stayed\ndown. That means their science and knowhow were not so much in the\nfirst place. And _that_ means--\" here he turned his head and looked\ndirectly into Eric's eyes--\"_that_ means the science of our ancestors\nwasn't worth one good damn against the Monsters, and it wouldn't be\nworth one good damn to us!\"\n\nEric the Only turned pale. He knew heresy when he heard it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis uncle patted him on the shoulder, drawing a deep breath as if he'd\nfinally spat out something extremely unpleasant. He leaned closer, eyes\nglittering beneath the forehead glow lamp and his voice dropped to a\nfierce whisper.\n\n\"Eric. When I asked you how we've been hitting back at the Monsters,\nyou told me what we _ought_ to do. We haven't been _doing_ a\nsingle thing to bother them. We don't know how to reconstruct\nthe Ancestor-science, we don't have the tools or weapons or\nknowhow--whatever _that_ is--but they wouldn't do us a bit of good even\nif we had them. Because they failed once. They failed completely and\nat their best. There's just no point in trying to put them together\nagain.\"\n\nAnd now Eric understood. He understood why his uncle had whispered,\nwhy there had been so much strain in this conversation. Bloodshed was\ninvolved here, bloodshed and death.\n\n\"Uncle Thomas,\" he whispered, in a voice that kept cracking despite\nhis efforts to keep it whole and steady, \"how long have you been an\nAlien-Science man? When did you leave Ancestor-Science?\"\n\nThomas the Trap-Smasher caressed his spear before he answered. He\nfelt for it with a gentle, wandering arm, almost unconsciously, but\nboth of them registered the fact that it was loose and ready. His\ntremendous body, nude except for the straps about his loins and the\nlight spear-sling on his back, looked as if it were preparing to move\ninstantaneously in any direction.\n\nHe stared again from one end of the burrow to the other, his forehead\nlamp reaching out to the branching darkness of the exits. Eric stared\nwith him. No one was leaning tightly against a wall and listening.\n\n\"How long? Since I got to know your father. He was in another band;\nnaturally we hadn't seen much of each other before he married my\nsister. I'd heard about him, though: everyone in the Male Society\nhad--he was a great thief. But once he became my brother-in-law,\nI learned a lot from him. I learned about locks, about the latest\ntraps--and I learned about Alien-Science. He'd been an Alien-Science\nman for years. He converted your mother, and he converted me.\"\n\nEric the Only backed away. \"No!\" he called out wildly. \"Not my father\nand mother! They were decent people--when they were killed a service\nwas held in their name--they went to add to the science of our\nancestors--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis uncle jammed a powerful hand over his mouth.\n\n\"Shut up, you damn fool, or you'll finish us both! Of course your\nparents were decent people. How do you think they were killed? Your\nmother was with your father out in Monster territory. Have you ever\nheard of a woman going along with her husband on a Theft? And taking\nher baby with her? Do you think it was an ordinary robbery of the\nMonsters? They were Alien-science people, serving their faith as best\nthey could. They died for it.\"\n\nEric looked into his uncle's eyes over the hand that covered the lower\nhalf of his face. _Alien-science people ... serving their faith ... do\nyou think it was an ordinary robbery ... they died for it!_\n\nHe had never realized before how odd it was that his parents had gone\nto Monster territory together, a man taking his wife and the woman\ntaking her baby!\n\nAs he relaxed, his uncle removed the gagging hand. \"What kind of Theft\nwas it that my parents died in?\"\n\nThomas examined his face and seemed satisfied. \"The kind you're going\nafter,\" he said. \"If you are your father's son. If you're man enough to\ncontinue the work he started. Are you?\"\n\nEric started to nod, then found himself shrugging weakly, and finally\njust hung his head. He didn't know what to say. His uncle--well, his\nuncle was his model and his leader, and he was strong and wise and\ncrafty. His father--naturally, he wanted to emulate his father and\ncontinue whatever work he had started. But this was his initiation\nceremony, after all, and there would be enough danger merely in proving\nhis manhood. For his initiation ceremony to take on a task that had\ndestroyed his father, the greatest thief the tribe had ever known, and\na heretical, blasphemous task at that....\n\n\"I'll try. I don't know if I can.\"\n\n\"You can,\" his uncle told him heartily. \"It's been set up for you. It\nwill be like walking through a dug burrow, Eric. All you have to face\nthrough is the council. You'll have to be steady there, no matter what.\nYou tell the chief that you're undertaking the third category.\"\n\n\"But why the third?\" Eric asked. \"Why does it have to be Monster\nsouvenirs?\"\n\n\"Because that's what we need. And you stick to it, no matter what\npressure they put on you. Remember, an initiate has the right to decide\nwhat he's going to steal. A man's first Theft is his own affair.\"\n\n\"But, listen, uncle--\"\n\nThere was a whistle from the end of the burrow. Thomas the Trap-Smasher\nnodded in the direction of the signal.\n\n\"The council's beginning, boy. We'll talk later, on expedition. Now\nremember this: stealing from the third category is your own idea, and\nall your own idea. Forget everything else we've talked about. If you\nhit any trouble with the chief, I'll be there. I'm your sponsor, after\nall.\"\n\nHe threw an arm about his confused nephew and walked to the end of the\nburrow where the other members of the band waited.\n\n\nII\n\nThe tribe had gathered in its central and largest burrow under the\ngreat, hanging glow lamps that might be used in this place alone.\nExcept for the few sentinels on duty in the outlying corridors, all of\nMankind was here. It was an awesome sight to behold.\n\nOn the little hillock known as the Royal Mound, lolled Franklin the\nFather of Many Thieves, Chieftain of all Mankind. He alone of the\ncluster of warriors displayed heaviness of belly and flabbiness of\narm--for he alone had the privilege of a sedentary life. Beside the\nsternly muscled band leaders who formed his immediate background, he\nlooked almost womanly; and yet one of his many titles was simply The\nMan.\n\nYes, unquestionably The Man of Mankind was Franklin the Father of Many\nThieves. You could tell it from the hushed, respectful attitudes of the\nsubordinate warriors who stood at a distance from the mound. You could\ntell it from the rippling interest of the women as they stood on the\nother side of the great burrow, drawn up in the ranks of the Female\nSociety. You could tell it from the nervousness and scorn with which\nthe women were watched by their leader, Ottilie, the Chieftain's First\nWife. And finally, you could tell it from the faces of the children,\nstanding in a distant, disorganized bunch. A clear majority of their\nfaces bore an unmistakable resemblance to Franklin's.\n\nFranklin clapped his hands, three evenly spaced, flesh-heavy wallops.\n\n\"In the name of our ancestors,\" he said, \"and the science with which\nthey ruled the Earth, I declare this council opened. May it end as one\nmore step in the regaining of their science. Who asked for a council?\"\n\n\"I did.\" Thomas the Trap-Smasher moved out of his band and stood before\nthe chief.\n\nFranklin nodded, and went on with the next, formal question:\n\n\"And your reason?\"\n\n\"As a band leader, I call attention to a candidate for manhood. A\nmember of my band, a spear-carrier for the required time, and an\naccepted apprentice in the Male Society. My nephew, Eric the Only.\"\n\nAs his name was sung out, Eric shook himself. Half on his own volition\nand half in response to the pushes he received from the other warriors,\nhe stumbled up to his uncle and faced the chief. This, the most\nimportant moment of his life, was proving almost too much for him. So\nmany people in one place, accredited and famous warriors, knowledgeable\nand attractive women, the chief himself, all this after the shattering\nrevelations from his uncle--he was finding it hard to think clearly.\nAnd it was vital to think clearly. His responses to the next few\nquestions had to be exactly right.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe chief was asking the first: \"Eric the Only, do you apply for full\nmanhood?\"\n\nEric breathed hard and nodded. \"I do.\"\n\n\"As a full man, what will be your value to Mankind?\"\n\n\"I will steal for Mankind whatever it needs. I will defend Mankind\nagainst all outsiders. I will increase the possessions and knowledge of\nthe Female Society so that the Female Society can increase the power\nand well-being of Mankind.\"\n\n\"And all this you swear to do?\"\n\n\"And all this I swear to do.\"\n\nThe Chief turned to Eric's uncle. \"As his sponsor, do you support his\noath and swear that he is to be trusted?\"\n\nWith just the faintest hint of sarcasm in his voice, Thomas the\nTrap-Smasher replied: \"Yes. I support his oath and swear that he is to\nbe trusted.\"\n\nThere was a rattling moment, the barest second, when the chief's eyes\nlocked with those of the band leader. With all that was on Eric's mind\nat the moment, he noticed it. Then the chief looked away and pointed to\nthe women on the other side of the burrow.\n\n\"He is accepted as a candidate by the men. Now the women must ask for\nproof, for only a woman's proof bestows full manhood.\"\n\nThe first part was over. And it hadn't been too bad. Eric turned\nto face the advancing leaders of the Female Society, Ottilie, the\nChieftain's First Wife, in the center. Now came the part that scared\nhim. The women's part.\n\nAs was customary at such a moment, his uncle and sponsor left him when\nthe women came forward. Thomas the Trap-Smasher led his band to the\nwarriors grouped about the Throne Mound. There, with their colleagues,\nthey folded their arms across their chests and turned to watch. A man\ncan only give proof of his manhood while he is alone; his friends\ncannot support him once the women approach.\n\nIt was not going to be easy, Eric realized. He had hoped that at least\none of his uncle's wives would be among the three examiners: they were\nboth kindly people who liked him and had talked to him much about\nthe mysteries of women's work. But he had drawn a trio of hard-faced\nfemales who apparently intended to take him over the full course before\nthey passed him.\n\nSarah the Sickness-Healer opened the proceedings. She circled him\nbelligerently, hands on hips, her great breasts rolling to and fro like\na pair of swollen pendulums, her eyes glittering with scorn.\n\n\"Eric the Only,\" she intoned, and then paused to grin, as if it were a\nname impossible to believe, \"Eric the Singleton, Eric the one and only\nchild of either his mother or his father. Your parents almost didn't\nhave enough between them to make a solitary child. Is there enough in\nyou to make a man?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a snigger of appreciation from the children in the distance,\nand it was echoed by a few growling laughs from the vicinity of the\nThrone Mound. Eric felt his face and neck go red. He would have fought\nany man to the death for remarks like these. Any man at all. But who\ncould lift his hand to a woman and be allowed to live? Besides, one of\nthe main purposes of this exhibition was to investigate his powers of\nself-control.\n\n\"I think so,\" he managed to say after a long pause. \"And I'm willing to\nprove it.\"\n\n\"Prove it, then!\" the woman snarled. Her right hand, holding a long,\nsharp-pointed pin, shot to his chest like a flung spear. Eric made his\nmuscles rigid and tried to send his mind away. That, the men had told\nhim, was what you had to do at this moment: it was not you they were\nhurting, not you at all. You, your mind, your knowledge of self, were\nin another part of the burrow entirely, watching these painful things\nbeing done to someone else.\n\nThe pin sank into his chest for a little distance, paused, came out.\nIt probed here, probed there; finally it found a nerve in his upper\narm. There, guided by the knowledge of the Sickness-Healer, it bit and\nclawed at the delicate area until Eric felt he would grind his teeth\nto powder in the effort not to cry out. His clenched fists twisted\nagonizingly at the ends of his arms in a paroxysm of protest, but he\nkept his body still. He didn't cry out; he didn't move away; he didn't\nraise a hand to protect himself.\n\nSarah the Sickness-Healer stepped back and considered him. \"There\nis no man here yet,\" she said grudgingly. \"But perhaps there is the\nbeginnings of one.\"\n\nHe could relax. The physical test was over. There would be another one,\nmuch later, after he had completed his theft successfully; but that\nwould be exclusively by men as part of his proud initiation ceremony.\nUnder the circumstances, he knew he would be able to go through it\nalmost gaily.\n\nMeanwhile, the women's physical test was over. That was the important\nthing for now. In sheer reaction, his body gushed forth sweat which\nslid over the bloody cracks in his skin and stung viciously. He felt\nthe water pouring down his back and forced himself not to go limp,\nprodded his mind into alertness.\n\n\"Did that hurt?\" he was being asked by Rita, the old crone of a\nRecord-Keeper. There was a solicitous smile on her forty-year-old face,\nbut he knew it was a fake. A woman as old as that no longer felt sorry\nfor anybody. She had too many aches and pains and things generally\nwrong with her to worry about other people's troubles.\n\n\"A little,\" he said. \"Not much.\"\n\n\"The Monsters will hurt you much more if they catch you stealing from\nthem, do you know that? They will hurt you much more than we ever\ncould.\"\n\n\"I know. But the stealing is more important than the risk I'm taking.\nThe stealing is the most important thing a man can do.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRita the Record-Keeper nodded. \"Because you steal things Mankind needs\nin order to live. You steal things that the Female Society can make\ninto food, clothing and weapons for Mankind, so that Mankind can live\nand flourish.\"\n\nHe saw the way, saw what was expected of him. \"No,\" he contradicted\nher. \"That's not why we steal. We live on what we steal, but we do not\nsteal just to go on living.\"\n\n\"Why?\" she asked blandly, as if she didn't know the answer better than\nany other member of the tribe. \"Why do we steal? What is more important\nthan survival?\"\n\nHere it was now. The catechism.\n\n\"_To hit back at the Monsters_,\" he began. \"_To drive them from the\nplanet, if we can. Regain Earth for Mankind, if we can. But, above all,\nhit back at the Monsters...._\"\n\nHe ploughed through the long verbal ritual, pausing at the end of each\npart, so that the Record-Keeper could ask the proper question and\ninitiate the next sequence.\n\nShe tried to trip him once. She reversed the order of the fifth and\nsixth questions. Instead of \"_What will we do with the Monsters when we\nhave regained the Earth from them?_\" she asked, \"_Why can't we use the\nMonsters' own Alien-Science to fight the Monsters?_\"\n\nCarried along by mental habit, Eric was well into the passage beginning\n\"_We will keep them as our ancestors kept all strange animals, in a\nplace called a zoo, or we will drive them into our burrows and force\nthem to live as we have lived_,\" before he realized the switch and\nstopped in confusion. Then he got a grip on himself, sought the right\nanswer in his memory with calmness, as his uncle's wives had schooled\nhim to do, and began again.\n\n\"_There are three reasons why we cannot ever use Alien-Science_,\"\nhe recited, holding up his hand with the thumb and little finger\nclosed. \"_Alien-Science is non-human, Alien-Science is inhuman,\nAlien-Science is anti-human. First, since it is non-human_,\"\nhe closed his forefinger, \"_we cannot use it because we can never\nunderstand it. And because it is inhuman, we would never want to use it\neven if we could understand it. And because it is anti-human and can\nonly be used to hurt and damage Mankind, we would not be able to use\nit so long as we remain human ourselves. Alien-Science is the opposite\nof Ancestor-Science in every way, ugly instead of beautiful, hurtful\ninstead of helpful. When we die, Alien-Science would not bring us to\nthe world of our ancestors, but to another world full of Monsters._\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll in all, it went very well, despite the trap into which he had\nalmost fallen.\n\nBut he couldn't help remembering the conversation with his uncle in the\nother burrow. As his mouth reeled off the familiar words and concepts,\nhis mind kept wondering how the two fitted together. His uncle was\nAlien-Science, and, according to his uncle, so had been his parents.\nDid that make them non-human, inhuman, anti-human?\n\nAnd what did it make him? He knew his religious duty well: he should at\nthis moment be telling all Mankind about his uncle's horrible secret.\n\nThe whole subject was far too complicated for someone with his limited\nexperience.\n\nWhen he had completed the lengthy catechism, Rita the Record-Keeper\nsaid: \"And this is what you say about the science of our ancestors. Now\nwe will find out what the science of our ancestors says about you.\"\n\nShe signaled over her shoulder, without turning her head, and two young\ngirls--female apprentices--pulled forward the large record machine\nwhich was the very center of the tribe's religious life. They stepped\nback, both smiling shyly and encouragingly at Eric the Only.\n\nHe knew the smiles meant little more than simple best wishes from\napprentices of one sex to apprentices of the other, but even that was\nquite a bit at the moment. It meant that he was much closer to full\nstatus than they. It meant that, in the opinion of unprejudiced,\ndisinterested observers, his examination was proceeding very well\nindeed.\n\n_Singleton_, he thought fiercely to himself. _I'll show them what a\nsingleton can do!_\n\nRita the Record-Keeper turned a knob at the top of the squat machine\nand it began to hum. She flung her arms up, quiveringly apart, and all,\nwarriors, women, children, apprentices, even the chief himself, all\nbowed their heads.\n\n\"Harken to the words of our ancestors,\" she chanted. \"Watch closely the\nspectacle of their great achievements. When their end was upon them,\nand they knew that only we, their descendants, might regain the Earth\nthey had lost, they made this machine for the future generations of\nMankind as a guide to the science that once had been and must be again.\"\n\nThe old woman lowered her arms. Simultaneously, heads went up all over\nthe burrow and stared expectantly at the wall opposite the record\nmachine, waiting for the magic message.\n\n\"Eric the Only,\" Rita called, spinning the dial on the left of the\nmachine with one hand and stabbing at it randomly with the forefinger\nof the other. \"This is the sequence in the science of our ancestors\nthat speaks for you alone. This is the appointed vision under which\nyou will live and die.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe stared at the wall, breathing hard. Now he would find out what his\nlife was to be about--_now_! His uncle's vision at this moment, years\nago, had suggested the nickname he came to bear: the Trap-Smasher. At\nthe last initiation ceremony, a youth had called forth a sequence in\nwhich two enormous airborne vehicles of the ancestors had collided.\n\nThey'd tried to cheer the boy up, but he'd known his fate was upon him.\nSure enough, he had been caught by a monster in the middle of his Theft\nand dashed to pieces against a wall.\n\nEven then, Eric decided, he'd rather have that kind of a sequence than\nthe awful emptiness of a _blank_ vision. When, every once in a while,\nthe machine went on and showed nothing but a blinding white rectangle,\nthe whole tribe knew that the youth being examined had no possibility\nof manhood in him at all. And the machine was never wrong. A boy who'd\ndrawn a blank vision inevitably became more and more effeminate as he\ngrew older without ever going out on his Theft. He tended to shun the\ncompany of warriors and to ask the women for minor tasks to perform.\nThe machine of the ancestors looked at a boy and told exactly what he\nwas and what he would become.\n\nIt had been great, that science which had produced this machine,\nno doubt about it. There was a power source in it which was\nself-contained, and which was supposed to be like the power behind all\nthings. It would run almost forever, if the machine were not tampered\nwith--although who could dream of tampering with it? In its visions\nwere locked, not only the secrets of every individual human being,\nbut enormous mysteries which the whole of Mankind had to solve before\nit could work out its salvation through the rituals and powers of the\nancestral science.\n\nNow, however, there was only one small part of Mankind that concerned\nEric. Himself. His future. He waited, growing more and more tense as\nthe power hum from the machine increased in pitch. And suddenly there\nwas a grunt of awe from the entire burrow of people as a vision was\nthrown upon the wall.\n\nHe hadn't drawn a blank. That was the most important thing. He had been\ngiven an authentic ancestral vision.\n\n\"Scattergood's does it again!\" a voice blared, as the picture projected\non the wall showed people coming from all directions, wearing the\nstrange body wrappings of the ancestors. They rushed, men, women,\nchildren, from the four corners of the glittering screen to some\nstrange structure in the center and disappeared into its entrance. More\nand more poured in, more and more kept materializing at the edges and\nscrambling toward the structure in the center.\n\n\"Scattergood's does it again!\" the vision yelled out at them. \"The\nsale of sales! The value of values! Only at Scattergood's three stores\ntomorrow. Binoculars, tape recorders, cameras, all at tremendous\nreductions, many below cost. Value, value, value!\"\n\nNow the vision showed only objects. Strange, unfamiliar objects such as\nthe ancestors used. And as each object appeared, the voice recited a\ncharm over it. Powerful and ancient magic this, the forgotten lore of\nAncestor-Science.\n\n\"Krafft-Yahrmann Exposure Meters, the best there is, you've heard about\nthem and now you can buy them, the light meter that's an eye-opener,\na price to fit every pocketbook, eight dollars and ninety-five cents,\ntomorrow at Scattergood's, absolutely only one to a customer.\n\n\"Kyoto Automatic Eight-Millimeter Movie Cameras with an f 1.4 lens and\nan electric eye that does all the focusing and gives you a perfect\nexposure every single time. As low as three dollars a week. The supply\nis limited, so hurry, hurry, hurry!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEric watched the sequence unfold, his hands squeezing each other, his\neyes almost distended in reverence and concentration. This was the clue\nto his life, to what he might become. This was the sequence that the\nrecord machine of the ancestors, turned on at random, had vouchsafed as\na prophecy of his future.\n\nAll knowledge was in that machine--and no possibility of error.\n\nBut Eric was getting worried. The vision was so strange. Sometimes\nthere would be a vision that baffled even the wisest women. And that\nmeant the youth who had called it forth would always be a puzzle, to\nhimself and all of Mankind.\n\nLet it not happen to him! O ancestors, O science, O record machine, let\nit not happen to him!\n\nLet him only have a clear and definite vision so that his personality\ncould be clear and definite for the rest of his life!\n\n\"Our special imported high-power precision binoculars,\" the voice\nroared on as a man appeared in the vision and brought one of the\nstrange objects up to his eyes. \"If we told you the manufacturer's\nname, you'd recognize it immediately. 7 x 50, only fourteen dollars\nand ninety-five cents, _with case_. 10 x 50, only fifteen dollars and\nninety-five cents, _with case_. You see further, you see clearer, you\npay less. You always pay less at Scattergood's. Rock-bottom prices!\nSkyscraper values! Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, at Scattergood's\nannual week-after-Hallowe'en Sale!\"\n\nThere was a click as the vision went off abruptly to be replaced by a\nwhite rectangle on the wall of the burrow. Eric realized that this was\nall the clue there was to be to his life. What did it mean? Could it be\ninterpreted?\n\nAnxiously, now, he turned to Ottilie, the Chieftain's First Wife. He\nturned to her as everyone else in Mankind was now turning, Sarah the\nSickness-Healer and Rita the Record-Keeper amongst them.\n\nOnly Ottilie could read a vision, only short, squat, imperious Ottilie.\nThe Chieftain's First Wife was her title of honor and her latest title,\nbut long before she had acquired that, long before even she had become\nHead of the Female Society, she had been Ottilie the Augur, Ottilie the\nOmen-Teller, Ottilie who could walk in her mind from the homey burrow\nof the present into the dark, labyrinthine corridors of the future,\nOttilie who could read signs, Ottilie who could announce portents.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was as Ottilie the Augur that she could pick out the one new-born\nbabe in a litter of three that had to be destroyed because, in some\nway or other, it would one day bring death to its people. It was as\nOttilie the Augur that, upon the death of the old chief, she had chosen\nFranklin the Father of Many Thieves to take over the leadership of\nMankind since he stimulated the most propitious omens. In everything\nshe had been right. And now, once again it was as Ottilie the Augur\nthat she threw her arms over her head and twisted and swayed and moaned\nas she sought deep inside herself for the meaning of Eric's vision, it\nwas as Ottilie the Augur and not as Ottilie the Chieftain's First Wife,\nfor that she had been only since Franklin had ascended the Throne Mound.\n\nThe scratches and holes gouged in his body by Sarah the Sickness-Healer\nhad begun to ache badly, but Eric shrugged off their annoyance. Could\nhis vision be interpreted? And _how_ would it be interpreted?\n\nWhatever Ottilie saw in the vision would stick to him for the rest\nof his life, much closer than the dried blood upon his arms and legs\nand chest. How could you possibly interpret such a vision? Eric the\nScattergood? That was meaningless. Eric the Value?\n\nNo, that was a little better, but it was dreadfully vague, almost as\nbad as a blank vision.\n\nHe stared past Ottilie's writhing figure to where his uncle stood,\nsurrounded by his band, a little to the left of the Throne Mound.\nThomas the Trap-Smasher was watching Ottilie and grinning with all his\nteeth.\n\nWhat did he find so funny, Eric wondered desperately? Was there nothing\nholy to him? Didn't he realize how important it was to Eric's future\nthat his vision be readable, that he get a name to be proud of? What\nwas funny in Ottilie's agony as she gave birth to Eric's future?\n\nHe realized that Ottilie was beginning to make coherent sounds. He\nstrained his ears to listen. This, this was it. Who he really was. Who\nhe would be, for all his life.\n\n\"Three times,\" Ottilie mumbled in a voice that steadily grew clearer\nand louder, \"three times our ancestors gave Eric his name. Three\nrepetitions they made. Three different ways they called on him to\nbecome what their science needed him to be. And all of you heard it,\nand I heard it, and Eric heard it too.\"\n\nWhich, Eric puzzled, which among the many strange magical statements\nhad contained his name and his life's-work? He waited for the Augur to\ncome out with it. He had almost given up breathing.\n\nHer body relaxed now, her hands hanging at her sides, Ottilie was\nspeaking to them in a sharp, authoritative voice as she stared at the\nwall of the burrow where the vision had appeared.\n\n\"'A light meter that's an eye-opener,' the Ancestor-science said,\" she\nreminded them. \"And 'an electric eye that does all the focusing.' And\n'you see further, you see clearer, you pay less,' the Record-Machine\ntold us of Eric. What the ancestors want of Eric is unmistakable, what\nhe must be if we are to hit back at the Monsters and regain the Earth\nwhich is rightfully ours.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThank the record machine, thank each and every ancestor! At least the\nmessage had been unmistakable. But what precisely had it been?\n\nOttilie the Augur, the Omen-Teller, turned to face him now where he\nstood apart from the rest of eagerly-watching Mankind. He straightened\nup and stood stiffly to learn his fate.\n\n\"Eric,\" she said. \"Eric the Only, Eric the Singleton, you go out\nnow to make your Theft. If you are successful and return alive, you\nwill become a man. And as a man you will no longer be Eric the Only,\nyou will be Eric the Eye. Eric the Eye, Eric the Espier, Eric who\nseeks out the path for Mankind. Eric who hits back at the Monsters\nwith his eye, his open eye, his electric eye, his further-seeing,\nclearer-seeing, less-paying eye. For this is the word of the ancestors,\nand all of you have heard it.\"\n\nAt last Eric could take a deep breath, and he did so now, noisily, in\ncommon with the whole of Mankind who had been hanging on Ottilie's\nwords. Eric the Eye--that was what he was to be. If he was\nsuccessful ... and if he lived.\n\nEric the Eye. Eric the Espier. Now he knew about himself. It was fixed,\nand for all time. It was a good name to bear, a fine personality to\nhave. He had been very fortunate.\n\nRita the Record-Keeper and her daughter Harriet the History-Teller,\nrolled the record machine back into its accustomed holy place, the\nniche in the wall behind the Throne Mound. Despite the sacred quality\nof the act in which she was engaged, the younger woman could not take\nher eyes off Eric. He was a person of consequence now, or at least\nwould be when he returned. Other young and mating-aged women, he\nnoticed, were looking at him the same way.\n\nHe began to walk around in a little circle before Mankind, and, as he\nwalked, he strutted. He waited until Ottilie, no longer the Augur now,\nno longer the Omen-Teller, but once more the Chieftain's First Wife--he\nwaited until she had returned to her place at the head of the Female\nSociety, before he began to sing.\n\nHe threw back his head and spread out his arms and danced proudly,\nstampingly, before Mankind. He spun around in great dizzying circles\nand leaped in the air and came down with wrenching spasmodic twists of\nhis legs and arms. And as he danced, he sang.\n\nHe sang out of the pride that racked his chest like a soul coughing,\nout of the majesty of the warrior-that-was-to-be, out of his sure\nknowledge of self. And he sang his promise to his fellows:\n\n    I am Eric the Eye,\n    Eric the Open Eye,\n    Eric the Electric Eye,\n    Eric the Further-Seeing,\n    Clearer-Seeing, Less-Paying Eye.\n    Eric the Espier--\n    Eric who finds and points out the way.\n    Are you lost in a strange place?\n    I will show you the path to your home.\n    Does the burrow break off in too many branches?\n    I will pick out the best one and Mankind shall walk through in safety.\n    Are there enemies about, hidden traps, unthought-of dangers?\n    I will see them and give warning of them in time.\n    I will walk at the head of the line of warriors and see for them,\n    And they shall be confident and they shall conquer--\n    For they have Eric the Espier to lead the way and point the path!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSo he sang as he danced before Mankind, under the enormous glow lamps\nof its great central burrow. He sang of his mission in life as just\na few short auld lang synes ago he had heard Roy the Runner, at his\ninitiation, sing of the fleetness and swiftness that he would soon be\nthe master of; as his Uncle Thomas had sung long before that of his\ncoming ability to detect and dismantle traps; as once his own father\nhad sung of the robberies he was to commit, of the storerooms he would\nempty for the benefit of Mankind. He sang and he leaped and he whirled,\nand all the while the watching host of Mankind beat time with its feet\nand hands and played chorus in the litany of his triumph.\n\nThen came a loud grunt from Franklin the Father of Many Thieves. The\nnoise stopped. Eric danced to a quivering halt, his body wet all over,\nhis limbs still trembling.\n\n\"That is what is to be,\" Franklin pointed out, \"once the Theft has\nbeen made. But first, first comes the Theft. Always before manhood\ncomes the Theft. Now let us speak of your Theft.\"\n\n\"I will go into the very home of the Monsters,\" Eric announced proudly,\nhis head thrown back before the chief. \"I will go into their home\nalone, with no companion but my own weapons, as a warrior should. I\nwill steal from them, no matter what the danger, no matter what the\nthreat. And what I steal, I will bring back for the use and enjoyment\nof Mankind.\"\n\nFranklin nodded and made the formal reply. \"That is good, and it is\nspoken like a warrior. What do you promise to steal from the Monsters?\nFor your first Theft must be a promise made in advance and kept, kept\nexactly.\"\n\nNow they were at it. Eric glanced at his uncle for support. Thomas the\nTrap-Smasher was staring off in a different direction. Eric licked his\nlips. Well, maybe it wouldn't be too bad. After all, a youth going off\non his first Theft had complete freedom of choice.\n\n\"I promise to make my theft in the third category,\" he said, his voice\ntrembling just a little.\n\nThe results were much more than he had anticipated. Franklin the Father\nof Many Thieves yelped sharply. He leaped off the Royal Mound and stood\ngaping at Eric for a while. His great belly and fat arms quivered with\ndisbelief.\n\n\"The third category, did you say? The _third_?\"\n\nEric, thoroughly frightened now, nodded.\n\nFranklin turned to Chief Wife Ottilie. They both peered through the\nranks of Mankind to where Thomas the Trap-Smasher stood in the midst\nof his band, seemingly unconcerned by the sensation that had just been\ncreated.\n\n\"What _is_ this, Thomas?\" the chief demanded, all ceremony and\nformality gone from his speech. \"What are you trying to pull? What's\nthis third category stuff you're up to?\"\n\nThomas the Trap-Smasher turned a bland eye upon him. \"What am _I_ up\nto? I'm not up to a damn thing. The boy's got a right to pick his\ncategory. If he wants to steal in the third category, well, that's his\nbusiness. What have I got to do with it?\"\n\nThe chief stared at him for a few moments longer. Then he swung back to\nEric and said shortly: \"All right. You've chosen. The third category it\nis. Now let's get on with the feast.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSomehow it was all spoiled for Eric. The initiation feast that preceded\na first Theft--how he had looked forward to it! But he was apparently\ninvolved in something going on in Mankind, something dangerous and\nunsavory.\n\nThe chief obviously considered him an important factor in whatever\ndifficulty had arisen. Usually, an initiate about to depart on a Theft\nwas the focus of all conversation as Mankind ate in its central burrow,\nthe women squatting on one side, the men on the other, the children at\nthe far ends where light was dim. But at this meal, the chief made only\nthe most necessary ritual remarks to Eric. His eyes kept wandering from\nhim to Thomas the Trap-Smasher.\n\nOnce in a while, Franklin's eyes met those of Ottilie, his favored and\nfirst wife, across the feast that had been spread the length of the\nburrow. He seemed to be saying something to her, although neither of\nthem moved their lips. Then they would nod at each other and look back\nto Eric's uncle.\n\nThe rest of Mankind became aware of the strained atmosphere: there was\nlittle of the usual laughter and gaiety of an initiation feast. The\nTrap-Smasher's band had pulled in tightly all around him; most of them\nwere not even bothering to eat but sat watchful and alert. Other band\ncaptains--men like Stephen the Strong-Armed and Harold the Hurler--had\nworried looks on their faces as if they were calculating highly\ncomplex problems.\n\nEven the children were remarkably quiet. They served the food over\nwhich the women had said charms much earlier, then scurried to their\nplaces and ate with wide eyes aimed at their elders.\n\nAll in all, Eric was distinctly relieved when Franklin the Father of\nMany Thieves belched commandingly, stretched, and lay back on the floor\nof the burrow. In a few minutes, he was asleep, snoring loudly.\n\nNight had officially begun.\n\n\nIV\n\nAt the end of the sleep period, as soon as the chief had awakened and\nyawned, thus proclaiming the dawn, Thomas the Trap-Smasher's band\nstarted on its trip.\n\nEric, still officially surnamed the Only, carried the precious loin\nstraps of manhood in the food knapsack the women had provided for a\npossible journey of several days. They should return before the next\nsleep period, but when one went on an expedition into Monster territory\nanything might happen.\n\nThey stepped out in full military formation, a long, straggling single\nfile, each man barely in sight of the warrior immediately ahead. For\nthe first time in his military career, Eric was wearing only one set of\nspears--those for himself. Extra weapons for the band--as well as extra\nsupplies--were on the back of a new apprentice, a stripling who marched\na distance behind Eric, watching him with the same mixture of fright\nand exhilaration Eric himself had once accorded all other warriors.\n\nAhead of Eric, momentarily disappearing as the dim corridor curved and\nbranched, was Roy the Runner, his long, loose-jointed legs purposefully\ntreading down the mileage. And all the way in the lead of the column,\nEric knew, was his uncle. Thomas the Trap-Smasher would be striding\ncautiously yet without any unnecessary waste of time, the large glow\nlamp on his forehead constantly shifting from wall to wall of the\nuninhabited burrow and then straight ahead, the heavy spear in each\nbrawny hand ready for instant action, his mouth set to call the warning\nbehind him if danger materialized.\n\nTo be a man--this was what it was like! To go on expeditions like this\nfor the rest of one's life, glorious, adventure-charged expeditions\nso that Mankind might eat well and have weapons and live as Mankind\nshould. And when you returned, triumphant, victorious, the welcoming\ndance of the women as they threaded their way through the tired ranks,\ngiving you refreshment and taking from you the supplies that only they\ncould turn into usable articles. Then, after you had eaten and drunk\nand rested, your own dance, the dance of the men, where you sang and\nacted out for the tribe all the events of this particular expedition,\nthe dangers you had overcome, the splendid courage you had shown, the\nstrange and mysterious sights you had seen.\n\nThe sights you had seen! As Eric the Eye, he would probably be entitled\nto a solo dance any time his band came across anything particularly\ncurious. Oh, how high Eric the Eye would leap, how loudly, how proudly,\nhow melodiously, he would sing of the wonders the expedition had\nencountered!\n\n\"Eric the Eye,\" the women would murmur. \"What a fine, fine figure of a\nman! What a mate for some lucky woman!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHarriet the History-Teller this morning, for example, before they\nstarted out. She had filled his canteen for him with fresh water as if\nhe were already an accredited man instead of an initiate going out to\nface his ultimate trial. Before the eyes of all Mankind she had filled\nit and brought it to him, her eyes down-cast and light purple blushes\non the rosy skin of her face and body. She had treated him the way a\nwife treats a husband, and many warriors--Eric thought gleefully--many\nfull warriors with their Thefts long behind them had observed that Eric\nwas likely to join the ranks of the Male Society and the married men\nalmost simultaneously.\n\nOf course, with her unlucky red hair, her bustling, domineering mother,\nHarriet was not exactly the most marriageable girl in Mankind. Still,\nthere were many full warriors who had not yet been able to persuade\na woman to mate with them, who watched Franklin and his three wives\nwith unconcealed hunger and envy. How they would envy Eric, the newest\nwarrior of all, when he mated the same night he returned from his\ntheft! Call him Only, then! Call him singleton, then!\n\nThey would have litter after litter, he and Harriet, large litters,\nample litters, four, five, even six at a time. People would forget he'd\never been the product of a singleton birth. Other women, mates of other\nwarriors, would wriggle to attract his attention as they now wriggled\nwhen they caught the eye of Franklin the Father of Many Thieves. He\nwould make the litters fathered by Franklin look puny in comparison,\nhe would prove that the best hope for Mankind's increase lay in his\nloins and his loins alone. And when the time came to select another\nchief....\n\n\"Hey, you damned day-dreaming singleton!\" Roy the Runner was calling\nfrom the burrow ahead. \"Will you wipe that haze out of your face and\npay attention to signals? This is an expedition to Monster territory,\nnot a stroll in the women's quarters. Stay alert, will you? The band\ncaptain's sent down a call for you.\"\n\nAmid the chuckles ahead and behind him--damn it, even the new\napprentice was laughing!--Eric took a firmer grip on his glow torch\nand sprinted for the head of the column. As he passed each man, he was\nasked the name of the girl he'd been thinking about and pressed for\ninteresting details. Since he kept his mouth tightly shut, some of the\nwarriors hypothesized out loud. They were painfully close to the truth.\n\nHis uncle wasn't much gentler with him. \"Eric the _Eye_!\" the\nTrap-Smasher growled. \"Eric the Eyebrow, Eric the Closed Eyelash,\nyou'll be known as, if you don't wake up! Now stay abreast of me and\ntry to _act_ like Eric the Eye. These are dangerous burrows and my\nvision isn't as sharp as yours. Besides, I have to fill you in on a\ncouple of things.\" He turned. \"Spread out a little farther back there,\"\nhe called out to the men behind him. \"Spread out! You should be a full\nspear-cast from the backside of the man in front of you. Let me see a\nreal strung-out column with plenty of distance between each warrior.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTo Eric, he muttered, once the maneuver had been completed: \"Good.\nGives us a chance to talk without everyone in the band hearing us. You\ncan trust my bunch, but still, why take chances?\"\n\nEric nodded, with no idea what he was talking about. His uncle had\nbecome slightly odd recently. Well, he was still the best band captain\nin all Mankind.\n\nThey marched along together, the light from the strange glowing\nsubstance on Eric's torch and his uncle's forehead spreading a\nyellowish illumination some hundred feet ahead of them. On either side,\nunderfoot, overhead, were the curved, featureless walls of the burrow.\nFrom the center of the corridor, where they marched, the walls looked\nsoft and spongy, but Eric knew what tremendous labor was involved in\ndigging a niche or recess in them. It took several strong men at least\ntwo sleep periods to make a niche large enough to hold a handful of\nMankind's store of artifacts.\n\nWhere had the burrows come from? Some said they had been dug by the\nancestors when they had first begun to hit back at the Monsters. Others\nclaimed the burrows had always been there, waiting for Mankind to find\nthem and be comfortable in them.\n\nIn all directions the burrows stretched. On and on they went,\ninterminably curving and branching and forking, dark and silent, until\nhuman beings stamped into them with glow lamp and glow torch. These\nparticular corridors, Eric knew, led to Monster territory. He had been\nalong them many times as a humble spear carrier when his uncle's band\nhad been dispatched to bring back the necessities of life for Mankind.\nOther corridors went off to more exotic and even more dangerous places.\nBut were there any places which had no burrows?\n\nWhat a thought! Even the Monsters lived in burrows, big as they were\nreputed to be. But there was a legend that Mankind had once lived\noutside burrows, outside the branching corridors. Then what had they\nlived in? Just trying to work it out made you dizzy.\n\nThey came to a place where the burrow became two burrows, each curving\naway from the other in opposite directions.\n\n\"Which one?\" his uncle demanded.\n\nEric unhesitatingly pointed the right.\n\nThomas the Trap-Smasher nodded. \"You have a good memory,\" he said as he\nbore in the direction that Eric had indicated. \"That's half of being an\nEye. The other half is having a feeling, a knack, for the right way to\ngo. You have that too. I've noticed it on every expedition where you've\nbeen along. That's what I told those women--Rita, Ottilie--I told them\nwhat your name had to be. Eric the Eye, I told them. Find a vision for\nthe kind that corresponds to it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was so shocked that he almost came to a halt. \"You picked my name?\nYou told them what kind of vision.... That's--that's--I never heard of\nsuch a thing!\"\n\nHis uncle laughed. \"It's no different from Ottilie the Omen-Teller\nmaking a deal with Franklin to have a vision showing him as the new\nchief. He gets to be chief, she becomes the Chieftain's First Wife and\nautomatically takes over the Female Society. Religion and politics,\nthey're always mixed up together these days, Eric. We're not living in\nthe old times any more when Ancestor-science was real and holy and it\nworked.\"\n\n\"It still works, Ancestor-science, doesn't it?\" he pleaded. \"Some of\nthe time?\"\n\n\"Everything works _some_ of the time. Only Alien-science, though, works\n_all_ of the time. It's working for Aliens, for the Monsters. It's got\nto begin working for us. That's where you come in.\"\n\nHe had to remember that his uncle was an experienced captain, a\nknowledgeable warrior. Thomas the Trap-Smasher's protection and advice\nhad brought him, a despised singleton, an orphaned child of parents\nthat no one dared even talk about, to his present estate of almost full\nthieving status. It was very fortunate for him that neither of his\nuncle's wives had yet produced a son which survived into the initiate\nyears. He still had a lot to learn from this man.\n\n\"Now,\" the Trap-Smasher was saying, his eyes still on the dimly\nilluminated corridors ahead. \"When we get to the Monster burrows, you\ngo in. You go in alone, of course.\"\n\nWell, of course, Eric thought. What other way was there to make your\nTheft? The first time you stole for Mankind, you did it all alone, to\nprove your manhood, your courage, also the amount of personal luck you\nenjoyed. It was not like a regular band theft--or organized stealing of\na large amount of goods that would last Mankind many sleep-periods,\nalmost a tenth of an auld lang syne. In a regular band theft, assigned\nto each band in rotation, a warrior had to be assured of the luck and\nskill of the warriors at his side. He had to know that each one of them\nhad made his Theft--and proved himself when completely alone.\n\nStealing from the Monsters was dangerous enough under the best of\nconditions. You wanted only the cleverest, bravest, most fortunate\nwarriors along with you.\n\n\"Once you're inside, stay close to the wall. Don't look up at first or\nyou're likely to freeze right where you are. Keep your eyes on the wall\nand move close to it. Move fast.\"\n\nNothing new here. Every initiate learned over and over again, before\nhe made his Theft, that it was terribly dangerous to look up when you\nfirst entered Monster territory. You had to keep your eyes on the wall\nand move in the protection of it, the wall touching your shoulder as\nyou ran alongside it. Why this was so, Eric had no idea, but that it\nwas so he had long ago learned to repeat as a fact.\n\n\"All right,\" Thomas the Trap-Smasher went on. \"You turn right as you go\nin. _Right_, do you hear me, Eric? You turn right, without looking up,\nand run along the wall, letting it brush your shoulder every couple of\nsteps. You run forty, fifty paces, and you come to a great big thing, a\nstructure, that's almost touching the wall. You turn left along that,\nmoving away from the wall, but still not looking up, until you pass an\nentrance in the structure. You don't go in that first entrance, Eric;\nyou pass it by. About twenty, twenty-five paces further on, there'll be\na second entrance, a bigger one. You go in that one.\"\n\n\"I go in that one,\" Eric repeated carefully, memorizing his uncle's\nwords. He was receiving directions for his Theft, the most important\nact of his life! Every single thing his uncle told him must be listened\nto carefully, must not be forgotten.\n\n\"You'll be in something that looks like a burrow again, but it'll be\ndarker, at first. The walls will soak up light from your glow lamp.\nAfter a while, the burrow will open out into a great big space, a real\nbig and real dark space. You go on in a straight line, looking over\nyour shoulder at the light from the entrance and making sure it's\nalways directly behind you. You'll hit another burrow, a low one this\ntime. Turn right at the first fork as soon as you go in, and there you\nare.\"\n\n\"Where? Where will I be? What happens then?\" Eric demanded eagerly.\n\"How do I make my Theft? Where do I find the third category?\"\n\nThomas the Trap-Smasher seemed to have trouble continuing.\nIncredible--he was actually nervous! \"There'll be a Stranger there. You\ntell him who you are, your name. He'll do the rest.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis time Eric came to a full stop. \"A Stranger?\" he asked in complete\namazement. \"Someone who's not of Mankind?\"\n\nHis uncle grabbed at his arm and pulled him along. \"Well, you've seen\nStrangers before,\" he said with a weak laugh. \"You know there are\nothers in the burrows besides Mankind. You know that, don't you, boy?\"\n\nEric certainly did.\n\nFrom an early age he had accompanied his uncle and his uncle's band on\nwarfare and trading expeditions to the burrows a bit further back. He\nknew that the people in these burrows looked down on the people in his,\nthat they were more plentiful than his people, and led richer, safer\nlives--but he still couldn't help feeling sorry for them.\n\nThey were nothing but Strangers, after all. He was a member of Mankind.\n\nIt wasn't just that Mankind lived in the front burrows, those\nclosest to the Monster larder. This enormous convenience might be\ncounterbalanced, he would readily admit, by the dangers associated\nwith it--although the constant exposure to dangers and death in every\nform were part of Mankind's greatness. They were great despite their\ninferior technology. So what if they were primarily a source of raw\nmaterials to the more populous but less hardy burrows in the rear? How\nlong would the weaponsmiths, the potters and tanners and artificers of\nthese burrows be able to go on with their buzzing, noisy industries\nonce Mankind ceased to bring them the basic substances--food, cloth,\nmetal--it had so gloriously stolen from fear-filled Monster territory?\nNo, Mankind was the bravest, greatest, most important people in all the\nburrows.\n\nBut that still wasn't the point of it all.\n\nThe point was that you had nothing more to do with Strangers than was\nabsolutely necessary. They were Strangers. You were Mankind. You stayed\nproudly aloof from them at all times.\n\nTrading with them--well, you traded with them. Mankind needed\nspear-points and sturdy spear-shafts, knapsacks and loin-straps,\ncanteens and cooking vessels. You needed these articles and got\nthem in exchange for heavy backloads of shapeless, unprocessed stuff\nfreshly stolen. Mating with them--well, of course you mated with them.\nOne was always on the lookout for extra women who could add to the\nknowledge and technical abilities of Mankind. But these women became a\nwell-adjusted part of Mankind once they were stolen, just as Mankind's\nwomen were complete outsiders and Strangers the moment they had been\ncarried off by a foreign raiding party. And fighting with them, warring\nwith them--next to stealing from the Monsters, that was the sweetest,\nmost exciting part of a warrior's existence.\n\nYou traded with Strangers, coldly, suspiciously, always alert for a\nbetter bargain; you stole Stranger women whenever you could, gleefully,\nproudly, because that diminished them and increased the numbers and\nwell-being of Mankind; and you fought Stranger men whenever there was\nmore to be gained that way than by simple trading--and periodically\nthey came upon you as you lay in your burrow unawares and fought you.\n\nBut otherwise, for all normal social purposes, they were taboo. Almost\nas taboo and not-to-be-related-to as the Monsters on the other side of\nMankind's burrows. When you came upon an individual Stranger wandering\napart from his people, you killed him quickly and casually.\n\nYou certainly didn't ask him for advice on your Theft.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEric was still brooding on the unprecedented nature of his uncle's\ninstructions when they came to the end of their journey, a large,\nblind-alley burrow. There was a line cut deep into the blank wall here,\na line that started at the floor, went up almost to the height of a\nman's head, and then curved down to the floor again.\n\nThe door to Monster territory.\n\nThomas the Trap-Smasher waited for a moment, listening. When his\nexperienced ears had detected no unusual noises in the neighborhood,\nno hint of danger on the other side, he cupped his hands around his\nmouth, faced back the way he had come, and softly gave the ululating\nrecognition-call of the band. The four other warriors and the\napprentice came up swiftly and grouped themselves about him. Then, at a\nsignal from their leader, all squatted near the door.\n\nThey ate first, rapidly and silently, removing from their knapsacks\nhandfuls of food that the women had prepared for them and stuffing\ntheir mouths full, the beams from the glow lamps above their eyes\ndarting incessantly back and forth along the arched, empty corridor.\nThis was the place of ultimate, awful danger. This was the place where\nanything might happen.\n\nEric ate most sparingly of all as was correct for an initiate about to\nemerge upon his Theft. He knew he had to keep his springiness of body\nand watchfulness of mind at their highest possible pitch. He saw his\nuncle nodding approvingly as he returned the bulk of his food to the\nknapsack.\n\nThe floor vibrated slightly underfoot; there was a regular, rhythmic\ngurgling. Eric knew that meant they were directly over a length of\nMonster plumbing: upon his return, before the band started homewards,\nThomas the Trap-Smasher would make an opening in the plumbing and\nthey would refill their canteens. The water here, nearest to Monster\nterritory, was always the sweetest and best.\n\nNow his uncle got to his feet and called Roy the Runner to him. While\nthe other warriors watched, tense and still, the two men walked to\nthe curved line and laid their ears against it. Satisfied, finally,\nthey inserted spear points into the door's outline on either side and\ncarefully pried the slab back toward them. They laid it on the floor of\nthe corridor, very gently.\n\nA shimmering blur of pure whiteness appeared where the door had been.\n\nMonster territory. The strange, alien light of Monster territory. Eric\nhad seen many warriors disappear into it to fulfill their manhood\ntasks. Now it was his turn.\n\nHolding his heavy spear at the ready, Eric's uncle leaned forward into\nthe whiteness. His body twisted as he looked up, down, around, on both\nsides. He withdrew and came back into the burrow.\n\n\"No new traps,\" he said in a soft voice. \"The one I dismantled last\nexpedition is still up there on the wall. It hasn't been repaired. Now\nEric. Here you go, boy.\"\n\nEric rose and walked with him to the doorway, remembering to keep his\neyes on the floor. You can't look up, he had been told again and again,\nnot right away, not the first time you're in Monster territory. If you\ndo, you freeze, you're lost, you're done for completely.\n\nHis uncle checked him carefully and fondly, making certain that his new\nloin straps were tight, that his knapsack and back-sling were both in\nthe right position on his shoulders. He took a heavy spear from Eric's\nright hand and replaced it with a light one from the back-sling. \"If\nyou're seen by a Monster,\" he whispered, \"the heavy spear's not worth\na damn. You scuttle into the closest hiding-place and throw the light\nspear as far as you can. The Monster can't distinguish between you and\nthe spear. It will follow the spear.\"\n\nEric nodded mechanically, although this too he had been told many\ntimes, this too was a lesson he knew by heart. His mouth was so dry! He\nwished that it weren't unmanly to beg for water at such a moment.\n\nThomas the Trap-Smasher took his torch from him and slipped a glow lamp\nabout his forehead. Then he pushed him through the doorway. \"Go make\nyour Theft, Eric,\" he whispered. \"Come back a man.\"\n\n\nV\n\nHe was on the other side. He was in Monster territory. He was\nsurrounded by the strange Monster light, the incredible Monster world.\nThe burrows, Mankind, everything familiar, lay behind him.\n\nPanic rose from his stomach and into his throat like vomit.\n\n_Don't look up. Eyes down, eyes down or you're likely to freeze right\nwhere you are. Stay close to the wall, keep your eyes on the wall and\nmove along it. Turn right and move along the wall. Move fast._\n\nEric turned. He felt the wall brush his right shoulder. He began to\nrun, keeping his eyes down, touching the wall with his shoulder at\nregular intervals. He ran as fast as he possibly could, urging his\nmuscles fiercely on. As he ran, he counted the steps to himself.\n\n_Twenty paces._ Where did the light come from? It was everywhere; it\nglowed so; it was white, white. _Twenty-five paces. Touch the wall with\nyour shoulder. Don't--above everything--don't wander away from the\nwall. Thirty paces._ In light like this you had no need of the glow\nlamp. It was almost too bright to see in. _Thirty-five paces._ The\nfloor was not like a burrow floor. It was flat and very hard. So was\nthe wall. Flat and hard and straight. _Forty paces. Run and keep your\neyes down. Run. Keep touching the wall with your shoulder. Move fast.\nBut keep your eyes down. Don't look up. Forty-five paces._\n\nHe almost smashed into the structure he had been told about, but his\nreflexes and the warnings he had received swung him to the left and\nalong it just in time. It was a different color than the wall, he\nnoted, and a different-textured material. _Keep your eyes down. Don't\nlook up._ He came to an entrance, like the beginning of a small burrow.\n\n_Don't go in that first entrance, Eric; you pass it by._ He began to\ncount again as he ran. Twenty-three paces more, and there was another\nentrance, a much higher, wider one. He darted inside. _It'll be darker,\nat first. The walls will soak up light from your glow lamp._\n\nEric paused, gasping. He was grateful for the sucking darkness. After\nthat terrible, alien white light, the gloom was friendly, reminiscent\nof the familiar burrows now so horribly far away.\n\nHe could afford to take a breath at this point, he knew. The first, the\nworst part was over. He wasn't out in the open any more.\n\nHe had emerged into Monster territory. He had run fast, following\ninstructions until he was safely under cover again. He was still alive.\n\nThe worst was over. Nothing else would be as bad as this.\n\nMonster territory. It lay behind him, bathed in its own peculiar light.\nNow. Why not? Now, when he was in a place of comparative safety. He\ncould take a chance. He _wanted_ to take a chance.\n\nHe turned, gingerly, fearfully. He raised his eyes. He looked.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe cry that tore from his lips was completely involuntary and\nfrightened him almost as much as what he saw. He shut his eyes and\nthrew himself down and sideways. He lay where he had fallen for a long\nwhile, almost paralyzed.\n\nIt couldn't be. He hadn't seen it. Nothing was that high, nothing ran\non and on for such incredible distances!\n\nAfter a time, he opened his eyes again, keeping them carefully focused\non the dark near him. The gloom in this covered place had diminished\nsomewhat as his eyes had grown more accustomed to it. Yellowish light\nfrom his glow lamp was providing illumination now: he could make out\nthe walls, about as far apart from each other as those in a burrow,\nbut--unlike a burrow's walls--oddly straight and at right angles to the\nfloor and ceiling. Far off there was an immense patch of darkness. _The\nburrow will open out into a great big space, a real big and real dark\nspace._\n\nWhat was this place, he wondered? What was it to the Monsters?\n\nHe had to take another look behind, into the open. One more quick look.\nHe was going to be Eric the Eye. An Eye should be able to look at\nanything. He had to take another look.\n\nBut guardedly, guardedly.\n\nEric turned again, opening his eyes a little at a time. He clamped his\nteeth together so as not to cry out. Even so, he almost did. He shut\nhis eyes quickly, waited, then opened them again.\n\nBit by bit, effort by effort, he found he was able to look into\nthe great open whiteness without losing control of himself. It was\nupsetting, overpowering, but if he didn't look too long at any one\ntime, he could stand it.\n\nDistance. Enormous, elongated, unbelievable distance. Space upon space\nupon space--that white light bathing it all. Space far ahead, space on\nall sides, space going on and on until it seemed to have no end to it\nat all. But there, fantastically far off, there was an end. There was\na wall, a wall made by giants that finally sealed off the tremendous\nspace. It rose hugely from the flat, huge floor and disappeared\nsomewhere far overhead.\n\nAnd in between--once you could stand to look at it this much--in\nbetween, there were objects. Enormous objects, dwarfed only by the\ngreatness of the space which surrounded them, enormous, terribly alien\nobjects. Objects like nothing you had ever imagined.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNo, that wasn't quite true. That thing over there. Eric recognized it.\n\nA great, squat thing like a full knapsack without the straps. Since\nearly boyhood, many was the time he had heard it described by warriors\nback from an expedition into Monster territory.\n\nThere was food in that sack and the others like it. Enough food in that\none sack to feed the entire population of Mankind for unnumbered auld\nlang synes. A different kind of food in each sack.\n\nNo spear point possessed by Mankind would cut through the fabric of\nits container, not near the bottom where it was thickest. Warriors had\nto climb about halfway up the sack, Eric knew, before they could find\na place thin enough to carve themselves an entrance. Then the lumps\nof food would be lowered from man to man all the way down the sack,\nwarriors clinging to precarious handholds every few paces.\n\nOnce the pile on the floor was great enough, they would clamber down\nand fill their specially large, food-expedition knapsacks. Then back\nto the burrows and to the women who alone possessed the lore of\ndetermining whether the food was fit for consumption and of preparing\nit if it were.\n\nThat's where he would be at this moment, on that sack, cutting a hole\nin it, if he'd chosen a first category Theft like most other youths.\nHe'd be cutting a hole, scooping out a handful of food--any quantity,\nno matter how small, was acceptable on an initiatory Theft--and be\npreparing to go home to plaudits from the women and acceptance from the\nmen. He'd be engaged in a normal, socially-acceptable endeavor.\n\nInstead of which....\n\nHe found that he was able to stare at the Monster room now from under\nthe cover of his hiding place with only a slight feeling of nausea.\nWell, that in itself was an achievement. After only a short time, here\nhe was, able to look around and estimate the nature of Monster goods\nlike the most experienced warrior. He couldn't look up too high as yet,\nbut what warrior could?\n\nWell and good, but this wasn't getting him anywhere. He didn't have a\nnormal Theft to make. His was third category. Monster souvenirs.\n\nEric turned and faced the darkness again. He walked rapidly forward\ninto the straight-walled burrow, the glow-lamp on his forehead lighting\na yellow path. Ahead of him, the great black space grew steadily larger\nas he pushed towards it.\n\nEverything about his Theft, his initiation into manhood, was\nextraordinary. Thomas the Trap-Smasher telling the women about his\nspecial talents, so that he would be accorded a vision and a name\nwhich would fit with them. Visions were supposed to come from the\nancestors, through the Ancestor-science of the record machine. Nobody\nwas supposed to have the slightest idea in advance of what the vision\nwould be. That was all up to the ancestors and their mysterious plans\nfor their descendants.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWas it possible, was it conceivable, that all visions and names were\npre-arranged, that the record machine was set in advance for every\ninitiation? Where did that leave religion? If that were so, how could\nyou continue to believe in logic, in cause and effect?\n\nAnd having someone--a Stranger, at that!--help you make your Theft.\nA Theft was supposed to be purely and simply a test of your male\npotential; by definition, it was something you did alone.\n\nBut if you could accept the concept of pre-arranged visions, why not\npre-arranged Thefts?\n\nEric shook his head. He was getting into very dark corridors mentally:\nhis world was turning into sheer confusion.\n\nBut one thing he knew. Making an arrangement with a Stranger, as his\nuncle had done, was definitely an act contrary to all the laws and\npractices of Mankind. Thomas's uncertain speech had underlined that\nfact. It was--well, it was _wrong_.\n\nYet his uncle was the greatest man in all Mankind, so far as Eric was\nconcerned. Thomas the Trap-Smasher could do no wrong. But Thomas the\nTrap-Smasher was evidently leaning toward Alien-science. Alien-science\nwas wrong. But again, on the other hand, his parents, according to the\nTrap-Smasher, his father and his mother had been Alien-sciencers.\n\nToo much. There was just too much to work out. There was too much he\ndidn't know. He'd better concentrate on his Theft.\n\nThe strange burrow had come to an end. The hairs rose on the back of\nhis neck as he walked into the great dark area and sensed enormous\nblack heights above him. He began to hurry, turning every once in a\nwhile to make certain that he was staying in a straight line with the\nlight from the entrance. Here, his forehead glow lamp was almost no use\nat all. He didn't like this place. It felt almost like being out in the\nopen.\n\nWhat, he wondered again feverishly, was this structure in the world of\nthe Monsters? What function did it have? He was not sure he wanted to\nknow.\n\nEric was running by the time he came to the end of the open space. He\nhit the wall so hard that he was knocked over backwards.\n\nFor a moment, he was badly frightened, then he realized what had\nhappened. He hadn't taken his bearings for a while: he must have moved\noff at an angle.\n\nGroping along the wall with extended arms, he found the entrance to\nthe low burrow at last. It was quite low--he had to bend his knees and\nduck his head as he went up to. It was an unpleasantly narrow little\ncorridor. But then there was an opening on his right--the fork his\nuncle had told him about--and he turned into it with relief.\n\nHe had arrived.\n\nThere was a burst of light from a group of glow lamps. And there were\nStrangers, there were _several_ Strangers here. Three of them--no,\nfour--no, five! They squatted in a corner of this large, square\nburrow, three of them talking earnestly, the other two engaged in some\nincomprehensible task with materials that were mostly unfamiliar.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll of them leaped to their feet as he trotted in and deployed\ninstantly in a wide semi-circle facing him. Eric wished desperately\nhe had been holding two heavy spears instead of the single light one.\nWith two heavy spears you had both a shield and a dangerous offensive\nweapon. A light spear was good for a single cast, and that was that.\n\nHe held it nevertheless in the throwing position above his shoulder and\nglared fiercely, as a warrior of Mankind should. If he had to throw, he\ndecided, he would spring to one side immediately afterward and try to\npluck the two heavy spears from his back-sling. But if they rushed him\nright now--\n\n\"Who are you?\" asked a strong-faced, middle-aged man in the center of\nthe semi-circle, his spear throbbing in an upraised arm. \"What's your\nname--what's your people?\"\n\n\"Eric the Only,\" Eric told him quickly. Then he remembered to add: \"I'm\ndestined to be Eric the Eye. My people are Mankind.\"\n\n\"He's expected, one of us,\" the middle-aged man told the others who\nimmediately relaxed, slung their spears and went back to what they had\nbeen doing. \"Welcome, Eric the Only of Mankind. Put up your spear and\nsit with us. I am Arthur the Organizer.\"\n\nEric gingerly dropped his spear into the back-sling. He studied the\nStranger.\n\nA man about as old as his uncle and not nearly as hefty, although\nwell-muscled enough for normal warlike purposes. He wore the\nloin-straps of a full warrior, but--as if these were not enough honor\nfor a man--he also wore straps laced about his chest and across his\nshoulders, though he was carrying no knapsack. This was the fashion\nof many Strangers, Eric knew, as was the strap at the back of the\nhead that held the hair in a tight tail away from the eyes instead of\nletting it hang wild and free as the hair of a warrior should. And\nthe straps were decorated with odd, incised designs--another weak and\nunmanlike Stranger fashion.\n\nWho but Strangers, Eric thought contemptuously, would group up in so\nan alien place without setting sentries at either end of their burrow?\nTruly Mankind had good reason to despise them!\n\nBut this man was a leader, he realized, a born leader, with an even\nmore self-assured air than Thomas the Trap-Smasher, captain of the\nbest band in all Mankind. He was studying Eric in turn, with eyes\nthat weighed carefully and then, having decided on the measure, made\na definite placement, fitting Eric permanently into this plan or that\nplan. He looked like a man whose head was full of many plans, each one\nevolving inexorably through action to a predetermined end.\n\nHe took Eric's arm companionably and led him to where the others\nsquatted and talked and worked. This was no tribal burrow of any\nsort: it was quite apparently a field headquarters--and Arthur the\nOrganizer was Commander-in-Chief. \"I met your uncle,\" he told Eric,\n\"about a dozen auld lang synes ago, when he came to us on a trading\nexpedition--back in our burrows, I mean. A fine man, your uncle, very\nprogressive. He's attended our secret meetings regularly, and there's\ngoing to be an important place for him in the great burrows we will\ndig, in the new world we are making. He reminds me a lot of your\nfather. But so do you, my boy, so do you.\"\n\n\"Did you know my father?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nArthur the Organizer smiled and nodded. \"Very well. He could have been\na great man. He gave his life for the Cause. Who among us will ever\nforget Eric the--the--Eric the Store-keeper or something, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"The Storeroom-Stormer. His name was Eric the Storeroom-Stormer.\"\n\n\"Yes, of course. Eric the Storeroom-Stormer. An unforgettable name with\nus, and an unforgettable man. But that's another story; we'll talk\nabout it some other time. You'll have to be getting back to your uncle\nvery soon.\" He picked up a flat board covered with odd markings and\nstudied it with his glow lamp.\n\n\"How do you like that?\" one of the men working with the unfamiliar\nmaterials muttered to his neighbor. \"You ask him his people, and he\nsays, 'Mankind.' _Mankind!_\"\n\nThe other man chuckled. \"A front-burrow tribe. What the hell do you\nexpect--sophistication? Each and every front-burrow tribe calls itself\nMankind. As far as these primitives are concerned, the human race stops\nat their outermost burrow. Your tribe, my tribe--you know what they\ncall us? Strangers. In their eyes, there's not too much difference\nbetween us and the Monsters.\"\n\n\"That's what I mean. They don't see us as fellow-men. They are\nnarrow-minded savages. Who needs them?\"\n\nArthur the Organizer glanced at Eric's face. He turned sharply to the\nman who had spoken last.\n\n\"I'll tell you who needs them, Walter,\" he said. \"The Cause needs them.\nIf the front-burrow tribes are with us, it means our main lines of\nsupply to Monster territory are kept open. But we need every fighter\nwe can get, no matter how primitive. Every single tribe has to be with\nus if Alien-science is to be the dominant religion of the burrows, if\nwe're to avoid the fiasco of the last rising. We need front-burrow\nmen for their hunting, foraging skills and back-burrow men for their\ncivilized skills. We need everybody in this thing, especially now.\"\n\nThe man called Walter put down his work and scowled at Eric dubiously.\nHe seemed to be totally unconvinced.\n\n\"These arrogant back-burrowers with their ornamented straps and\nunmilitary manners! Men from different tribes sitting around and\ntalking, when--if they had any sense of propriety at all--they should\nbe killing each other!\"\n\nSuddenly, the floor shook under him. He almost fell. He staggered back\nand forth, trying to grab at the spears in his back-sling. He finally\ngot used to it, managed to find a solid footing in the upheaval. The\nspear he held vibrated in his hand.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFrom far away came a series of ear-splitting thumps. The floor swung to\ntheir rhythm. \"What is it?\" he cried, turning to Arthur. \"What's going\non?\"\n\n\"You've never heard a Monster walking before?\" the Organizer asked him\nunbelievingly. \"That's right--this is your Theft, your first time out.\nIt's a Monster, boy. A Monster's moving around in the Monster larder,\ndoing whatever Monsters do. They have a right, you know,\" he added with\na smile. \"It's their larder. We're just--visitors.\"\n\nEric noticed that none of the others seemed particularly concerned. He\ndrew a deep breath and reslung his spear. How the floor and the walls\nshook! What a fantastic, enormous creature that must be!\n\nAs an apprentice warrior, he had often stood with the rear-guard on the\nother side of the doorway to Monster territory while the band went in\nto steal for Mankind. A few times there had been heavy, thumping noises\noff in the distance, and the walls of the burrow had quivered slightly.\nBut not like this. It had never been remotely as awesome as this.\n\nHe raised his eyes to the straight, flat ceiling of the burrow\nabove them. He remembered the dark space further back stretching up\nlimitlessly. \"And this,\" he said aloud. \"This structure we're in. What\nis _this_ to them?\"\n\nArthur the Organizer shrugged. \"A piece of Monster furniture. Something\nthey use for something or other. We're in one of the open spaces they\nalways leave in the bases of their furniture. Makes the furniture\nlighter, easier to move around, I guess.\" He listened for a moment\nas the thumps drifted further away and then died out. \"Let's get\ndown to business. Eric, this is Walter the Weapon-Seeker. Walter the\nWeapon-Seeker of the Miximilian people. Walter, what do you have for\nEric's tribe--for, uh, for Mankind?\"\n\n\"I hate to give anything even halfway good to a front-burrow tribe,\"\nthe squatting man muttered. \"No matter how much you explain it to them,\nthey always use it wrong, they botch it up every single time. Let's\nsee. This should be simple enough.\"\n\nHe rummaged in the pile of strange stuff in front of him and picked up\na small, red, jelly-like blob. \"All you do,\" he explained, \"is tear\noff a pinch with your fingers. Just a pinch at a time, no more. Then\nspit on it and throw it. After you spit on it, get it out of your hands\nfast. Throw it as fast and as far as you can. Do you think you can\nremember that?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Eric took the red blob from him and stared at it in puzzlement.\nThere was a strange, irritating odor: it made his nose itch slightly.\n\"But what happens? What does it do?\"\n\n\"That's not your worry, boy,\" Arthur the Organizer told him. \"Your\nuncle will know when to use it. You have your third category theft--a\nMonster souvenir that no one in your tribe has ever seen before. It\nshould make them sit up and take notice. And tell your uncle to bring\nhis band to my burrow three days--three sleep-periods--from now. That\nwill be the last time we meet before the rising. Tell him to bring them\narmed with every last spear they can carry.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEric nodded weakly. There were so many complex, incomprehensible things\ngoing on! The world was a bigger, more active place than he had ever\nimagined.\n\nHe watched Arthur the Organizer add a mark to the flat board on which\nmany symbols were scratched. This was another Stranger practice--made\nnecessary, he knew, by the weak Stranger memory, so inferior to that of\nMankind.\n\nThe Weapon-Seeker leaped up and stopped him as he was about to put the\nred blob into his knapsack. \"Nothing wet in there?\" Walter demanded,\nopening the bag and rummaging about in Eric's belongings. \"No water?\nRemember, get this stuff wet and you're done for.\"\n\n\"Mankind keeps its water in canteens,\" Eric explained irritably. \"We\nkeep it here,\" he pointed to the sloshing pouch at his hip, \"not\nsplashing around loosely with our provisions.\" He swung the full\nknapsack on his back and stepped away with stiff dignity.\n\nArthur the Organizer accompanied him to the end of the burrow. \"Don't\nmind Walter,\" he whispered. \"He's always afraid that nobody but\nhimself will be able to use the Monster weapons he digs up. He talks\nthat way to everyone. Now, suppose I refresh your memory about the way\nback. We don't want you to get lost.\"\n\n\"I won't get lost,\" Eric said coldly. \"I have a good memory, and I know\nenough to perform a simple reversal of the directions on the way here.\nBesides, I am Eric the Espier, Eric the Eye of Mankind. I won't get\nlost.\"\n\nHe was rather proud of himself as he trotted away, without turning his\nhead. Let the Strangers know what you think of them. The snobs. The\nstuck-up bastards.\n\nBut still, he felt damaged somehow, made less--as when Roy the Runner\nhad called him a singleton before the entire band. And the last comment\nhe had heard behind him--\"These primitives: so damned touchy!\"--made it\nno better.\n\nHe crossed the dark open space, still brooding, his eyes fixed on\nthe patch of white light ahead, his mind engaged in a completely\nunaccustomed examination of values. Mankind's free simplicity against\nthe Stranger multiplicity and intricacy. Mankind's knowledge of basics,\nthe important foraging basics of day-to-day life, against the Stranger\nknowledge of so many things and techniques he had never even heard\nabout. Surely Mankind's way was infinitely preferable, far superior?\n\nThen why did his uncle want to get mixed up with Stranger politics,\nhe wondered, as he emerged from the structure? He turned left and,\npassing the small entrance he had ignored before, sped for the wall\nwhich separated him from the burrows. And why did all these Strangers,\nevidently each from a different tribe, agree in the contempt with which\nthey held Mankind?\n\nHe had just turned right along the wall, on the last stretch before the\ndoorway, when the floor shook again, jarring him out of his thoughts.\nHe bounced up and down, frozen with fear where he stood.\n\nHe was out in the open while a Monster was abroad. A Monster had come\ninto the larder again.\n\n\nVI\n\nFar off in the dazzling distance, he caught sight of the tremendously\nlong gray body he had heard about since childhood, higher than a\nhundred men standing on each other's shoulders, the thick gray legs\neach wider than two hefty men standing chest to chest. He caught just\none wide-eyed, fear-soluble glimpse of the thing before he went into\ncomplete panic.\n\nHis panic was redeemed by a single inhibition: he didn't spring forward\nand run away from the wall. But that was only because it would have\nmeant running directly toward the Monster. For one thoroughly insane\nmoment, however, he thought of trying to claw his way through the wall\nagainst which his shoulders were pressed.\n\nThen--because it was the direction he had been running in--he\nremembered the doorway. He must be about thirty, thirty-five paces from\nit. There lay safety: his uncle, the band, Mankind and the burrows--the\nblessed, closed-in, narrow burrows!\n\nEric leaped along the wall for the doorway. He ran as he'd never in his\nlife run before, as he'd never imagined he could run.\n\nBut even as he fled madly, almost weeping at the effort he was\nmaking, a few sane thoughts--the result of long, tiresome drills\nas an initiate--organized themselves in his screaming mind. He had\nbeen closer to the structure in which the Strangers were hiding the\nstructure which Arthur the Organizer explained was a piece of Monster\nfurniture. He should have turned the other way, towards the structure,\ngotten between it and the wall. There, unless he'd been seen as the\nMonster entered the larder, he could have rested safely until it was\npossible to make his escape.\n\nHe had gone too far to turn back now. But run silently, he reminded\nhimself: run swiftly but make no noise, make no noise at all. According\nto the lessons that the warriors taught, at this distance Monster\nhearing was more to be feared than Monster vision. Run silently. Run\nfor your life.\n\nHe reached the door. It had been set back in place!\n\nIn disbelief and utter horror he stared at the curved line in the wall\nthat showed where the door had been replaced in its socket. But this\nwas never done! This had never been heard of!\n\nEric beat frantically on the door with his fists. Would his knuckles\nmake enough noise to penetrate the heavy slab? Or just enough to\nattract the Monster's attention?\n\nHe twisted his head quickly--a look, a deliberately wasted moment,\nto estimate the closeness of his danger. The Monster's legs moved so\nslowly: its speed would have been laughable if the very size of those\nlegs didn't serve to push it forward an incredible distance with each\nstep. And there was nothing laughable in that long, narrow neck,\nalmost as long as the rest of the body, and the malevolent, relatively\ntiny head on the end of the neck. And those horrible pink things, all\naround the neck, just behind the head--\n\nIt was much nearer than it had been just seconds ago, but whether it\nhad noticed him and was coming at him he had no idea. Beat at the door\nwith the shaft of a spear? That should attract attention, that might be\nheard.\n\nYes, by the Monster too.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was only one thing to do. He stepped a few paces back from the\nwall. Then he leaped forward, smashing his shoulder into the door. He\nfelt it give a little. Another try.\n\nThe floor-shaking thumps of the Monster's steps were now so close as to\nbe almost deafening. At any moment, a great gray foot might come down\nand grind out his life. Eric stepped back again, forcing himself not to\nlook up.\n\nAnother leap, another bruising collision with the door. It had\ndefinitely moved. An indentation showed all around it.\n\nWas he about to be stepped on--to be squashed?\n\nEric put his hands on the door. He pushed. Slowly, suckingly, it left\nthe place out of which it had been carved long ago.\n\n_Where was the Monster? How close? How Close?_\n\nSuddenly, the door fell over into the burrow, and Eric spilled\npainfully on top of it. He scrambled to his feet and darted down the\ncorridor.\n\nHe had no time to feel relief. His mind was repeating its lessons,\nreminding him what he had to do next in such a situation.\n\n_Run a short distance down the burrow. Then stop and wait on the\nballs of your feet, ready to bolt. Get as much air into your lungs as\npossible. You may need it. If you hear a hissing, whistling sound,\nstop breathing and start running. Hold your breath for as long as you\ncan--as long as you possibly can--then suck another chestful of air and\nkeep running. Keep this up until you are far away. Far, far away._\n\nEric waited, poised to run, his back to the doorway.\n\n_Don't look around--just face the direction you'll have to run. There's\nonly one thing you have to worry about, only one thing you have to\nlisten for. A hissing, whistling sound. When you hear it, hold your\nbreath and run._\n\nHe waited, his muscles contracted for instant action.\n\nTime went by. He remembered to count. If you counted up to five\nhundred, slowly, and nothing happened, you were likely to be all right.\nYou could assume the Monster probably hadn't noticed you.\n\nSo the experienced warriors said, the men who had lived through such an\nexperience.\n\nFive hundred. He reached five hundred and, just to be on the safe side,\nstill tense, still ready to run, counted another five hundred, up to\nthe ultimate number conceived by man, a full thousand.\n\nNo hissing, no whistling sounds. No suggestion of danger.\n\nHe relaxed, and his muscles--suddenly set free--gave way. He fell to\nthe floor of the burrow, whimpering with the release of tension.\n\nIt was over. His Theft was over. He was a man.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe had been in the same place as a Monster, and lived through it. He\nhad met Strangers and dealt with them as a representative of Mankind.\nSuch things as he would have to tell his uncle!\n\nHis uncle. Where was his uncle? Where was the band?\n\nSuddenly fully aware of how much was wrong, Eric scrambled to his feet\nand walked cautiously back to the open doorway. The burrow was empty.\nThey hadn't waited for him.\n\nBut that was another incredible thing! A band never gave an initiate\nup for lost until at least two full days had gone by. In the chief's\nabsence, of course, this was measured by the sleep periods of the band\ncaptain. Any band would wait two days before giving up and turning\nhomeward. And, Eric was positive, his uncle would have waited a bit\nlonger than that for _him_. He'd been away for such a short time! Then\nwhat had happened?\n\nHe crept to the doorway and peeped outside. There was almost no\ndizziness this time. His eyes adjusted quickly to the different scale\nof distance. The Monster was busy on the other side of the larder. It\nhad merely been crossing the room, then, not pursuing and attacking.\nApparently it hadn't noticed him at all.\n\nFantastic. And with all the noise he had made! All that rushing back\nand forth, that battering-down of the door!\n\nThe Monster turned abruptly, walked a few gigantic steps and hurled\nitself at the structure in which Eric had met the Strangers. The walls,\nthe floor, everything, shook mightily in sympathy to the impact of the\ngreat organism as it wriggled a bit and became still.\n\nEric was startled until he realized that the creature had done no more\nthan lie down in the structure. It _was_ a piece of Monster furniture,\nafter all.\n\nHow had that felt to Arthur the Organizer and Walter the Weapon-Seeker\nand the others hidden in the base? Eric grinned. Those Strangers must\nbe a little less haughty, a little more sober at this moment.\n\nMeanwhile, he had work to do, things to find out.\n\nHe got his fingers under the slab of door and tugged it upright. It was\nheavy! He pushed against it, slowly, carefully, first one side and then\nthe other, walking it back to the hole in the wall. A final push, and\nit slid into place tightly, only the thin, curved line suggesting its\nexistence.\n\nNow he could look around.\n\nThere had been a fight here--that much was certain. A brief, bitter\nbattle. Examining the area closely, Eric saw unmistakable signs of\nconflict.\n\nA broken spear shaft. Some blood on the wall. Part of a torn knapsack.\nNo bodies, of course. You were not likely to find bodies after a\nbattle. Any people of the burrows knew that the one unavoidable\nimperative of victory was to drag the bodies away and dispose of them.\nNo one might ever leave dead enemies to rot where they would foul the\ncorridors.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSo there had been a battle. He had been right--his uncle and his\nuncle's band had not just gone off and left him. There must have been\nan attack by a superior force. The band had stood its ground for a\nwhile, sustained some losses, and then been forced to retreat.\n\nBut there were a few things which didn't make sense. First, it was very\nunusual for a war party of Strangers to come this close to Monster\nterritory. The burrows which were inhabited by Mankind, the natural\ngoal of a war party, were much further back. At this point, you would\nnot expect to find any group larger than a foraging expedition--a\nStranger band at most.\n\nHis uncle's men, fully armed, operating under battle alert, could\neasily cope with a single band of weavers, weaponsmiths or traders from\nthe decadent back-burrows. They would have driven them off, possibly\ntaking a few prisoners, and continued to wait for him.\n\nThat left only two possibilities. The unlikely war party--a two or\nthree-band attack--and, even more unlikely, a band from another fierce,\nfront-burrow people. But front-burrowers rarely went prowling at random\nnear Monster territory. They would have their own door cut into it and\nwould tend to feel hugely uncertain about one belonging to another\npeople. They too would head for the inhabited burrows if they were\non any business other than the important one of stealing for their\ntribe's needs.\n\nAnd another thing. Unless his uncle's band had been wiped out to the\nvery last man--a thought Eric rejected as highly improbable--the\nsurvivors were honor-bound, by their oath of manhood, after doing\nwhatever the immediate military situation required, from pursuit to\nretreat, to return as soon as possible to the spot where an initiate\nwas expected back from his Theft. No warrior would dare face the women\nif he failed to do this.\n\nPossibly the attack had just come. Possibly his uncle's band was a\nshort distance away, still fighting their way from burrow's end to\nburrow's end; and, once they had gotten clear of the enemy, would make\ntheir way back to him.\n\nNo. In that case, he should be able to hear the battle still going on.\nAnd the burrows were dreadfully still.\n\nEric shivered. A warrior was not meant to be abroad without companions.\nHe'd heard of tribeless Strangers--once, as a child, he remembered\nenjoying the intricate execution of a man who'd been expelled from\nhis own people for some major crime and who had wandered pathetically\ninto the neighborhood of Mankind--but these people were hardly to be\nconsidered human: tribes, bands, societies, were the surroundings of\nhuman creatures.\n\nIt was awful to be alone. It was unthinkable.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWithout bothering to eat, though he was quite hungry after his Theft,\nhe began walking rapidly down the corridor. After a while, he broke\ninto a trot. He wanted to get home as soon as possible--to be among his\nown kind again.\n\nHe reached into his back-sling and got a spear for each hand.\n\nA nervous business going through the corridors all by yourself. They\nwere so empty and so quiet. They hadn't seemed this quiet when he'd\nbeen on expedition with the band. And so fearfully, frighteningly dim.\nEric had never before realized how much difference there was between\nthe light you got from one forehead glow-lamp and the usual band\ncomplement of a half-dozen. He found himself getting more and more wary\nof the unexpected shadows where the wall curved sharply: he picked up\nspeed as he ran past the black hole of a branching burrow.\n\nAt any one of those places, an enemy could be waiting for him, warned\nby the sound of his approaching footsteps. It could be the same enemy\nwhich had attacked his uncle's band, a handful of cruel and murderous\nStrangers, or a horde of them. It could be something worse. Abruptly he\nremembered legends of unmentionable creatures who lurked in the empty\nburrows, creatures who fled before the approach of a band of warriors,\nbut who would come noiselessly upon a single man. Big creatures who\nengulfed you. Tiny creatures who came in their hundreds and nibbled you\nto pieces. Eric kept jerking his head around to look behind him: at\nleast he could keep his doom from taking him by surprise.\n\nIt was _awful_ to be alone.\n\nAnd yet, in the midst of his fears, his mind returned again and again\nto the problem of his uncle's disappearance. Eric could not believe\nanything serious had happened to him. Thomas the Trap-Smasher was a\nveteran of too many bloody adventures, too many battles against unequal\nodds. Then where had he gone? And where had he taken the band?\n\nAnd why was there no sound of him anywhere, no sign in all this\ninfinity of gloomy, stretching, menace-filled tunnels?\n\nFortunately, he was an Eye. He knew the way back and sped desperately\nalong it without the slightest feeling of doubt. The Record Machine\nwas right: he would never be lost. Let him just get safely back to the\ncompanionship of Mankind and he would be Eric the Eye.\n\nAnd there it was again: who had been right, the Record Machine or his\nuncle? The vision that named him had come from the Record Machine, but\nhis uncle claimed that this was religious claptrap. The vision had been\nselected and his name proposed to the women well in advance of the\nceremony. And his uncle was an Alien-sciencer, in touch with Strangers\nwho were also Alien-sciencers....\n\nSo many things had happened in the last two days, Eric felt. So much of\nhis world had shifted. It was as if the walls of the burrows had moved\noutward and upward until they resembled Monster territory more than\nhuman areas.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was getting close now. These corridors looked friendlier, more\nfamiliar. He made himself run faster, although he was almost at the\npoint of exhaustion. He wanted to be home, to be officially Eric the\nEye, to inform Mankind of what had happened so that a rescue and\nsearching party could be sent out for his uncle.\n\nThat doorway to Monster territory: who had replaced it? If a battle had\nbeen fought, and his uncle's band had retreated, still fighting, would\nthe attacker have stopped to put the door neatly back in its socket?\nNo.\n\nCould it be explained by a sudden onslaught and the complete\nextermination of his uncle's band? Then, before dragging the bodies\naway, the enemy would have had time to put the door back. A doorway\ninto Monster territory was a valuable human resource, after all,\nvaluable to Mankind and Strangers alike--why jeopardize it by leaving\nit visible and open?\n\nBut who--or what--could have been capable of such a sudden onslaught,\nsuch a complete extermination of the best-led band in all Mankind? He'd\nhave to get the answer from one of the other band captains or possibly\na wise old crone in the Female Society.\n\nDefinitely within the boundaries of Mankind now, Eric forced himself to\nslow to a walk. He would be coming upon a sentry at any moment, and he\nhad no desire at all to have a spear flung through him. A sentry would\nreact violently to a man dashing out of the darkness.\n\n\"Eric the Only,\" he called out, identifying himself with each step.\n\"This is Eric the Only.\" Then he remembered his Theft proudly and\nchanged the identification. \"Eric the Eye. This is Eric the Eye, the\nEspier, the further-seeing, less-paying Eye. Eric the Eye is coming\nback to Mankind!\"\n\nOddly, there was no returning call of recognition. Eric didn't\nunderstand that. Had Mankind itself been attacked and driven away from\nits burrow? A sentry should respond to a familiar name. Something was\nvery, inexplicably wrong.\n\nThen he came around the last curve and saw the sentry at the other end.\nRather, he saw what at first looked like three sentries. They were\nstaring at him, and he recognized them. Stephen the Strong-Armed and\ntwo members of Stephen's band. Evidently he had arrived just at the\nmoment when the sentry on duty was about to be relieved. That would\naccount for Stephen and the other man. But why hadn't they replied to\nhis shouts of identification?\n\nThey stood there silently as he came up, their spears still at the\nready, not going down in welcome. \"Eric the Eye,\" he repeated, puzzled.\n\"I've made my Theft, but something happened to the rest--\"\n\nHis voice trailed off, as Stephen came up to him, his face grim, his\npowerful muscles taut. The band captain shoved a spear point hard\nagainst Eric's chest. \"Don't move,\" he warned. \"Barney. John. Tie him\nup. We've caught the little rat!\"\n\n\nVII\n\nHis spears taken from him, his arms bound securely behind his back by\nthe thongs of his own knapsack, Eric was pushed and prodded into the\ngreat central burrow of Mankind.\n\nThe place was almost unrecognizable.\n\nUnder the direction of Ottilie, the Chieftain's First Wife, a horde of\nwomen--what seemed at first like the entire membership of the Female\nSociety--was setting up a platform in front of the Royal Mound. With\nthe great scarcity of any building materials that Mankind suffered\nfrom, a construction of this sort was startling and unusual, yet there\nwas something about it that awoke highly unpleasant memories in Eric's\nmind. But he was pulled from place to place too fast and there were too\nmany other unprecedented things going on for him to be able to identify\nthe memory properly.\n\nTwo women who were accredited members of the Female Society were not\nworking under Ottilie's direction, he noticed. Bound hand and foot,\nthey were lying against the far wall of the great central burrow. They\nwere both covered with blood and showed every sign of having undergone\nprolonged and most vicious torture. He judged them to be barely this\nside of death.\n\nAs he was jerked past, he recognized them. They were the two wives of\nThomas the Trap-Smasher.\n\n_Just wait until his uncle got back! Someone would really pay for\nthis_, he thought, more in absolute amazement than horror. He had the\nfeeling that he must keep the horror away at all costs. Once let it in\nand it would soak through his thoughts right into the memory he was\ntrying to avoid.\n\nThe place was full of armed men, running back and forth from their band\ncaptains to unknown destinations in the outlying corridors. Between\nthem and around them scuttled the children, fetching and carrying\nraw materials for the hard-working women. There was a steady buzz of\ncommands in the air ... \"Go to--\" \"Bring some more--\" \"Hurry with\nthe--\" ... that mingled with the smell of many people whose pores\nwere sweating urgency. And it wasn't just sweat that he smelled. Eric\nrealized as he was dragged before the Royal Mound. It was anger. The\nanger and fear of all Mankind.\n\nFranklin the Father of Many Thieves stood on the mound, carrying\nunaccustomed spears in his fat hands, talking rapidly to a group of\nwarriors, band captains and--yes, actually!--_Strangers_. Even now,\nEric found he could still be astonished at this fantastic development.\n\nStrangers in the very midst of Mankind! Walking around freely and\nbearing arms!\n\nAs the chief caught sight of Eric, his face broke into a loose-skinned\nsmile. He nudged a Stranger beside him and pointed at the prisoner.\n\n\"That's him,\" he said. \"That's the nephew. The one that asked for the\nthird category Theft. Now we've got them all.\"\n\nThe Stranger didn't smile. He looked briefly at Eric and turned away.\n\"I'm glad you think so. From our point of view, you've just got one\nmore.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFranklin's smile faded to an uncertain grin. \"Well, you know what I\nmean. And the damned fool came back by himself. It saved us a lot of\ntrouble, I mean, didn't it?\" Receiving no answer, he shrugged. He\ngestured with flabby imperiousness at Eric's guards. \"You know where to\nput him. We'll be ready for them pretty soon.\"\n\nAgain the point of a spear stabbed into Eric's back, and he was forced\nforward across the central space to a small burrow entrance. Before he\ncould reach it, however, he heard Franklin the Father of Many Thieves\ncall out to Mankind: \"There goes Eric, my people. Eric the Only. Now\nwe've got the last of the filthy gang!\"\n\nFor a moment, the activity stopped and seemed to focus on him. Eric\nshivered as a low, drawn-out grunt of viciousness and hatred arose\neverywhere, but most of all from the women.\n\nSomeone ran up to him. Harriet the History-Teller. The girl's face\nwas absolutely contorted. She reached up to the crown of her head and\npulled out the long pin held in place by a few knotted scarlet hairs.\nAbout her face and neck the hair danced like flames.\n\n\"You Alien-sciencer!\" she shrieked, driving the pin straight at his\neyes. \"You filthy, filthy Alien-sciencer!\"\n\nEric whipped his head to one side; she was back at him in a moment. His\nguards leaped at the girl and grappled with her, but she was able to\nget in one ripping slash that opened up almost all of his right cheek\nbefore they drove her away.\n\n\"Leave something for the rest of us,\" one of his guards pleaded the\ncause of reason as he strolled back to Eric. \"After all, he belongs to\nthe whole of Mankind.\"\n\n\"He does not!\" she yelled. \"He belongs to me most of all. I was going\nto mate with him when he returned from his Theft, wasn't I, Mother?\"\n\n\"There wasn't anything official,\" Eric heard Rita the Record-Keeper\nadmonishing as he tried to stanch the flow of blood by bringing his\nshoulder up and pressing it against the wound. \"There couldn't be\nanything official about it until he'd achieved manhood. So you'll just\nhave to wait your turn, Harriet, darling. You'll have to wait until\nyour elders are finished with him. There'll be plenty left for you.\"\n\n\"There won't be,\" the girl pouted. \"I know what you're like. There\nwon't be hardly anything left.\"\n\nEric was shoved at the small burrow entrance again. The moment he was\ninside it, one of his guards planted a foot in his back, knocking the\nbreath out of him. The kick propelled him forward, staggering wildly\nfor balance, until he smashed into the opposite wall. As he fell,\nunable to use his arms to cushion himself, he heard laughter behind him\nin the great central burrow. He rolled on his side dizzily. There was a\nfresh flow of blood coming down from his cheek.\n\nThis wasn't the homecoming he'd imagined after his Theft--not in the\nslightest! What was going on?\n\nHe knew where he was. A tiny, blind-alley burrow off Mankind's major\nmeeting-place, a sort of little vault used mostly for storage. Excess\nfood and goods stolen from Monster territory were kept here until\nthere was enough accumulated for a trading expedition to the back\nburrows. Occasionally, also, a male Stranger, taken prisoner in battle,\nmight be held in this place until Mankind found out if his tribe valued\nhim enough to pay anything substantial for his recovery.\n\nAnd if they didn't....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEric remembered the unusual structure that the women had been building\nnear the Royal Mound--and shivered. The memory that he'd suppressed\nhad now come alive in his mind. And it fitted with the way Harriet had\nacted--and with what her mother, Rita the Record-Keeper, had said.\n\nThey couldn't be planning that for him! He was a member of Mankind,\nalmost a full warrior. They didn't even do that to Strangers captured\nin battle--not _normal_ Strangers. A warrior was always respected as a\nwarrior. At the worst, he deserved a decent execution, quietly done.\nExcept for--Except for--\n\n\"_No!_\" he screamed. \"_No!_\"\n\nThe single guard who'd been left on duty at the entrance turned around\nand regarded him humorously.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" he said. \"Oh, definitely yes! We're going to have a lot of\nfun with both of you, as soon as the women say they're ready.\" He\nnodded with ominous, emphatic slowness and turned back to miss none of\nthe preparations.\n\n_Both_ of you? For the first time, Eric looked around the little\nstorage burrow. The place was almost empty of goods, but off to one\nside, in the light of his forehead glow-lamp (how proud he had been\nwhen it had been bestowed on him at the doorway to Monster territory!)\nhe now saw another man lying bound against the wall.\n\nHis uncle.\n\nEric brought his knees up and wriggled rapidly over to him. It was a\npainful business. His belly and sides were not calloused and inured to\nthe rough burrow floor like his feet. But what did a few scratches more\nor less matter any more?\n\nThe Trap-Smasher was barely conscious. He had been severely handled,\nand he looked almost as bad as his wives. There was a thick crust of\ndried blood on his hair. The haft of a spear, Eric guessed, had all but\ncracked his head open. And in several places on his body, his right\nshoulder, just above his left hip, deep in his thigh, were the oozing\ncraters of serious spear wounds, raw and unbandaged.\n\n\"Uncle Thomas,\" Eric urged. \"What happened? Who did this to you?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe wounded man opened his eyes and shuddered. He looked around\nstupidly as if he had expected to find the walls talking to him. And\nhis powerful arms struggled with the knots that held them firmly behind\nhis back. When he finally located Eric, he smiled.\n\nIt was a bad thing to do. Someone had also smashed in most of his front\nteeth.\n\n\"Hello, Eric,\" he mumbled. \"What a fight, eh? How did the rest of the\nband do? Anybody get away?\"\n\n\"I don't know. That's what I'm asking you! I came back from my\nTheft--you were gone--the band was gone. I got here, and everyone's\ncrazy! There are Strangers out there, walking around with weapons in\nour burrows. Who are they?\"\n\nThomas the Trap-Smasher's eyes had slowly darkened. They were fully\nin focus now, and long threads of agony swam in them. \"Strangers?\"\nhe asked in a low voice. \"Yes, there were Strangers fighting in\nStephen the Strong-Armed's band. Fighting against us. That chief of\nours--Franklin--he got in touch with Strangers after we left. They\ncompared notes. They must have been working together, been in touch\nwith each other, for a long time. Mankind, Strangers, what difference\ndoes it make when their lousy Ancestor-science is threatened? I should\nhave remembered.\"\n\n\"What?\" Eric begged. \"What should you have remembered?\"\n\n\"That's the way they put down Alien-science in the other rising,\nlong ago. A chief's a chief. He's got more in common with another\nchief--even a chief of Strangers--than with his own people. You attack\nAncestor-science, and you're attacking their power as chiefs. They'll\nwork together then. They'll give each other men, weapons, information.\nThey'll do everything they can against the common enemy. Against the\nonly people who really want to hit back at the Monsters. I should have\nremembered! Damn it all,\" the Trap-Smasher groaned through his ruined\nmouth, \"I saw that the chief and Ottilie were suspicious. I should have\nrealized how they were going to handle it. They were going to call in\nStrangers, exchange information--and unite against us!\"\n\nEric stared at his uncle, dimly understanding. Just as there was\na secret organization of Alien-sciencers that cut across tribal\nboundaries, so there was a tacit, rarely-used understanding among the\nchiefs, based on the Ancestor-science religion that was the main prop\nof their power. _And_ the power of the leaders of the Female Society,\ncome to think of it. All special privileges were derived from their\nknowledge of Ancestor-science. Take that away from them, and they'd be\nordinary women with no more magical abilities than was necessary to\ntell edible food from Monster poison.\n\nGrunting with pain, Thomas the Trap-Smasher wormed his way up to a\nsitting position against the wall. He kept shaking his head as if to\njar recollection loose.\n\n\"They came up to us,\" he said heavily, \"Stephen the Strong-Armed and\nhis band came up to us just after you'd gone into Monster territory.\nA band from Mankind with a message from the chief--who suspected\nanything? They might be coming to tell us that the home burrows were\nunder attack by Strangers. Strangers!\" He gave a barking laugh, and\nsome blood splashed out of his mouth. \"They had Strangers with them,\nhidden all the way behind in the corridors. Mobs and mobs of Strangers.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEric began to visualize what had happened.\n\n\"Then, when they were among us, when most of us had reslung our spears,\nthey hit us. Eric, they hit us real good. They had us so much by\nsurprise that they didn't even need outside help. I don't think there\nwas much left of us by the time the Strangers came running up. I was\ndown, fighting with my bare hands, and so was the rest of the band. The\nStrangers did the mopping up. I didn't see most of it. Somebody handed\nme one hell of a wallop--I never expected to wake up alive.\" His voice\ngot even lower and huskier. \"I'd have been lucky not to.\"\n\nThe Trap-Smasher's chest heaved: a strange, long noise came out of it.\n\"They brought me back here. My wives--they were working on my wives.\nThose bitches from the Female Society--Ottilie, Rita--this part of it\nis their business--they had my wives pegged out and they worked on them\nin front of me. I was blanking out and coming to, blanking out and\ncoming to; I was conscious while they--\"\n\nHe dropped to a bloody mumble again, his head falling forward loosely.\nHis voice became clear for a moment, but not entirely rational. \"They\nwere good women,\" he muttered. \"Both of them. Good, good girls. And\nthey loved me. They had their chance to become more important. A dozen\ntimes Franklin must have offered to impregnate them, and they turned\nhim down every time. They really loved me.\"\n\nEric almost sobbed himself. He'd had little to do with them once he'd\nreached the age of the warrior initiate, but in his childhood, they'd\ngiven him all the mother love he ever remembered. They'd cuffed him and\ncaressed him and wiped his nose. They'd told him stories and taught him\nthe catechism of the ancestral science. Neither had sons of his age who\nhad survived the various plagues and the Monster-inflicted calamities\nthat periodically swept through Mankind's burrows. He'd been lucky.\nHe'd received much of the care and affection that their own sons might\nhave enjoyed.\n\nTheir fidelity to the Trap-Smasher had been a constant source of\nastonishment in Mankind. It had cost them more than the large, healthy\nlitters for which the chief had a well proven capacity: such eccentric,\nalmost non-womanly behavior had inevitably denied them the high\npositions in the Female Society they would otherwise have enjoyed.\n\nAnd now they were dead or dying, and their surviving babies had\nbeen apportioned to other women whose importance would thereby be\nsubstantially increased.\n\n\"Tell me,\" he asked his uncle. \"Why did the Female Society kill them?\nWhat did they do that was so awful?\"\n\nHe saw that Thomas had lifted his head again and was staring at him.\nWith pity. He felt his own body turn completely cold even before the\nTrap-Smasher spoke.\n\n\"You still won't let yourself think about it? I don't blame you, Eric.\nBut it's there. It's being prepared for us outside.\"\n\n\"What?\" Eric demanded, although a distant part of him had already\nworked out the terrible answer and knew what it was.\n\n\"We've been declared outlaws, Eric. They say we're guilty of the\nultimate sacrilege against Ancestor-Science. We don't belong to Mankind\nanymore--you, me, my family, my band. We're outside Mankind, outside\nthe law, outside religion. And you know what happens to outlaws, Eric,\ndon't you? Anything goes. _Anything._\"\n\n\nVIII\n\nEver since early childhood, Eric remembered looking forward to\nceremonies of this sort. A Stranger would have been caught by one of\nthe warrior bands, and it would be determined that he was an outlaw.\nNine times out of ten, such a man was easy enough to identify. No one\nbut an outlaw, for example, would be wandering the burrows by himself,\nwithout a band or at least a single companion to guard his back. The\ntenth time, when there was the slightest doubt, a request for ransom\nto his people would make the prisoner's position clear. There would\nbe a story of some unforgivable sacrilege, some particularly monstrous\ncrime that could be punished by nothing but complete anathema and the\nrevocation of all privileges as a human being. The man had escaped the\npunishment being prepared for him. Do with him as you will, his people\nwould say. He is no longer one of us; he is the same as a Monster; he\nis something non-human so far as we are concerned.\n\nThen a sort of holiday would be declared. Out of the bits and pieces\nof lumber stolen from Monster territory and set aside by the women for\nthis purpose, the members of the Female Society would erect a structure\nwhose specifications had been handed down from mother to daughter for\ncountless generations--all the way back to the ancestors who had built\nthe Record-Machines. It was called a Stage or a Theater, although Eric\nhad also heard it referred to as The Scaffold. In any case, whatever\nits true name, most of the details concerning it were part of the\nsecret lore of the Female Society and, as such, were no proper concern\nof males.\n\nOne thing about it, however, everyone knew. On it would be enacted a\nmoving religious drama: the ultimate triumph of humanity over the\nwickedness of the Monsters.\n\nFor this, the central character had to fulfill two requirements. He had\nto be an intelligent creature, as the Monsters were, so that he could\nbe made to suffer as some day Mankind meant the Monsters to suffer;\nand he had to be non-human, as the Monsters were, so that every drop\nof fear, resentment and hatred distilled by the enormous swaggering\naliens could be poured out upon his flesh without any inhibition of\ncompunction or fellow-feeling.\n\nFor this purpose, outlaws were absolutely ideal, since all agreed that\nsuch disgusting creatures had resigned their membership in the human\nrace.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen an outlaw was caught, work stopped in the burrows, and Mankind's\nwarrior bands were called home. It was a great time, a joyous time,\na time of festival. Even the children--doing whatever they could to\nprepare for the glorious event, running errands for the laboring women,\nfetching refreshment for the stalwart, guarding men--even the children\nboasted to each other of how they would express their hatred upon this\ntrapped representative of the non-human, this bound and shrieking\nprotagonist of the utterly alien.\n\nEveryone had their chance. All, from the chief himself to the youngest\nchild capable of reciting the catechism of ancestral science, all\nclimbed in their turn upon the Stage--or Theater--or Scaffold--that the\nwomen had erected. All were thrilled to vent a portion of Mankind's\nvengeance upon the creature who had been declared alien, as an earnest\nof what they would some day do collectively to the Monsters who had\nstolen their world.\n\nSarah the Sickness-Healer had her turn early in the proceedings;\nthenceforth, she stood on the structure and carefully supervised the\nceremony. It was her job to see that nobody went too far, that everyone\nhad a fair and adequate turn, and that even at the end there was some\nlife left in the victim. Because then, at the end, the structure had to\nbe completely burned--along with its bloody occupant--as a symbol of\nhow the Monsters must eventually be turned into ash and be blown away\nand vanish.\n\n\"_And Mankind will come into its own_,\" she would chant, while the\ncharred fragments were kicked out of the burrow contemptuously. \"_And\nthe Monsters will be gone. They will be gone forever, and there will be\nnothing upon all the wide Earth but Mankind._\"\n\nAfterwards, there was feasting, there was dancing, there was singing.\nMen and women chased each other into the dimmer side corridors;\nchildren whooped and yelled around the great central burrow; the few\nold folks went to sleep with broad, reminiscent smiles upon their\nfaces. Everyone felt they had somehow struck back at the Monsters.\nEveryone felt a little like the lords of creation their ancestors had\nbeen.\n\nEric remembered the things he himself had done--the things he had seen\nothers do--on these occasions. A tremendous tic of fear rippled through\nhis body. He had to draw his shoulders up to his neck in a tight hunch\nand tense the muscles of his arms and legs. Finally his nerves subsided.\n\nHe could think again. Only he didn't want to think.\n\nThose others, those outlaws in previous ceremonies of this sort in\nauld lang synes long past--was it possible that they had experienced\nthe same sick, bewildered dread while waiting for the structure to be\ncompleted? Had they trembled like this, had they also felt wetness\nrunning down their backs, had they felt the same pleading squirm in\ntheir intestines, the same anticipatory twinges of soft, vulnerable\nflesh?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe thought had never crossed his mind before. He'd seen them as things\ncompletely outside humanity, the compressed symbol of all that was\nalien. One worried about their feelings no more than about those of the\nroaches scurrying madly about here in the storage burrow. One squashed\nthem slowly or rapidly--at one's pleasure. What difference did it make?\nYou didn't sympathize with roaches. You didn't identify with them.\n\nBut now that he was about to be squashed himself, he realized that it\ndid make a difference. He was human. No matter what Mankind and its\nleaders now declared him to be, he was human. He felt human fears; he\nexperienced a desperate human desire to live.\n\nThen so had the others been. The outlaws whom he'd helped tear to\npieces. Human. Completely human.\n\nThey'd sat here, just as he did now, they'd sat and waited for the\nfestival and its agonies....\n\nOnly twice in his memory had members of Mankind ever been declared\noutlaw. Both cases had occurred a long time ago, before he'd even been\na warrior-initiate. Eric tried now to remember what they had been like\nas living people. He wanted to reach out and feel companionship, some\nsort of companionship, even that of the dead. The dead were better than\nthis beaten, bloody man next to him who had subsided into half-insane\nmumbles, his battered head on his torn and wound-scribbled chest.\n\nWhat had they been like? It was no use. In the first case, memory\nbrought back only a picture of a screaming hulk just before the fire\nwas lit. No recollection of a man. No fellow-human in Mankind. And in\nthe second case--\n\nEric sat bolt upright, straining against his bonds. The second man to\nbe declared an outlaw had escaped! How he had done it Eric had never\nfound out: he remembered only that a guard was severely punished, and\nthat bands of warriors had sniffed for him along far-distant corridors\nfor a long time afterward.\n\nEscape. That was it. He had to escape. Once declared an outlaw, he\ncould have no hope of mercy, no remission of sentence. The religious\novertones of the ceremony being prepared were too highly charged to be\nhalted for anything short of the disappearance of its chief protagonist.\n\nYes, escape. But how? Even if he could get free of the knots which so\nexpertly and so strongly tied his hands behind his back, he had no\nweapon to hand. The guard at the entrance would transfix him with a\nspear in a moment. And if he failed, there were others outside, almost\nthe entire warrior strength of the people.\n\nHow? _How?_ He forced himself to be calm, to go over every possible\nalternative in his mind. He knew there was not much time. In a little\nwhile, the structure would be finished and the leaders of the Female\nSociety would come for him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEric began working on the knots behind him. He worked without much\nhope. If he could get his hands loose, perhaps he might squirm his way\ncarefully to the entrance, leap up suddenly and break into a run. So\nwhat if they threw a spear through him--wouldn't that be better and\nquicker than the other thing?\n\nBut they wouldn't, he realized. Not unless he were very lucky and some\nwarrior forgot to think straight. In cases like this, when it was a\nmatter of keeping, not killing a prisoner, you aimed for the legs.\nThere were at least a dozen men in Mankind with skill great enough to\nbring him down even at twenty or twenty-five paces. And another dozen\nwho might be able to catch him. He was no Roy the Runner, after all.\n\nRoy! He was dead and sewered by now. He found himself regretting the\nfight he'd had with Roy.\n\nA Stranger passed by the storage burrow entrance, glancing in with\nonly a slight curiosity. He was followed in a moment by two more\nStrangers, going the same way. They were leaving, Eric guessed, before\nthe ceremony began. They probably had ceremonies of their own to\nattend--with their own people.\n\nWalter the Weapon-Seeker, Arthur the Organizer--were they at this\nmoment sitting in similar storage burrows awaiting the same slow death?\nEric doubted it. Somehow he couldn't see these men caught as easily as\nhe and his uncle had been. Arthur was too clever, he was certain of\nthat, and Walter, well, Walter would come up with some fantastic weapon\nthat no one had ever seen or heard of....\n\nLike the one he had in his knapsack right now--that red blob the\nWeapon-Seeker had given him!\n\nWas it a weapon? He didn't know. But even if it wasn't, he had the\nimpression it could create some kind of surprise. \"It should make them\nsit up and take notice,\" Walter had said back in Monster territory.\n\nAny kind of surprise, any kind of upset and he might have a diversion\nunder cover of which he and his uncle could escape.\n\nBut that was the trouble. His uncle. With his hands bound as thoroughly\nas he could now ascertain they were, he needed his uncle's help to do\nanything at all. And the Trap-Smasher was obviously too far gone to be\nat all useful.\n\nHe was talking to himself in a steady, monotonous, argumentative\nmutter, his upper body slumping further and further across his own lap.\nEvery once in a while, the mutters would be broken by a sharp, almost\nsurprised moan as his wounds woke into a clearer consciousness of\nthemselves.\n\nMost other men in his condition, Eric judged, would have been dead by\nnow. Only a body as powerful as the Trap-Smasher's could have lasted\nthis long. And--who knew?--if they could escape, it was possible that\nhis uncle's wounds, given care and rest, might heal.\n\nIf they could escape.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Uncle Thomas,\" he said, leaning toward him and whispering urgently. \"I\nthink I know a way out. I think I've figured out a way to escape.\"\n\nNo response. The bloody head continued to talk in a low, toneless voice\nto the lap. Mutter, mutter, mutter. Moan. Mutter, mutter.\n\n\"Your wives,\" Eric said desperately. \"Your wives. Don't you want to get\nrevenge for your wives?\"\n\nThat seemed to be worth a flicker. \"My wives,\" said the thick voice.\n\"They were good women. Real good women. They never let Franklin near\nthem. They were real good women.\" Then the flicker was over and the\nmutters returned.\n\n\"Escape!\" Eric whispered. \"Don't you want to escape?\"\n\nA thin, coagulating line of blood dripped out of his uncle's slowly\nworking jaws. There was no other answer.\n\nEric looked towards the entrance of the storage burrow. The guard\nposted there was no longer turning from time to time to glance at the\nprisoners. The structure outside was evidently nearing completion, and\nhis interest in the final preparations had caused him to take a step\nor two away from the entrance. He was staring off to the left down the\ngreat central burrow in absolute fascination.\n\nWell, that was something. It gave them a chance. On the other hand, it\nalso meant that they had scant moments left to their lives. Any time\nnow, the leaders of the Female Society would be coming to drag them to\nthe torture ceremony.\n\nWith his eyes on the guard, Eric leaned against the rough burrow wall\nand began scraping the imprisoning knapsack thongs against the sharpest\nedges he could find. It wouldn't be fast enough, he realized. If there\nwere only a spear point in this place, something sharp. He looked\naround feverishly. No, nothing. A few tumbled bags of food, over which\nlazy roaches wandered. Nothing he could use to help him get free.\n\nHis uncle was his only hope. Somehow he had to rouse the man,\nget through to him. He squirmed up close, his mouth against the\nTrap-Smasher's battered ear.\n\n\"This is Eric, Eric the Only. Do you remember me, Uncle? I went on the\nTheft, Uncle Thomas, I went on the Theft with you. Third category.\nRemember, I asked for a third category theft, just like you told me to?\nI did my Theft, I was successful, I made it. I did just what you told\nme to do. I'm Eric the Eye now, right? Tell me, am I Eric the Eye?\"\n\nMutters, mumbles and moans. The man seemed beyond intelligibility.\n\n\"What about Franklin? He can't do this to us, can he, Uncle Thomas?\nDon't you want to escape? Don't you want revenge on Franklin, on\nOttilie, for what they did to your wives? Don't you? _Don't you?_\"\n\nHe had to cut through his uncle's confused mist of gathering delirium.\n\nIn complete desperation, he lowered his head and sank his teeth into a\nwounded shoulder.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNothing. Just the steady flow of argumentative gibberish. And the thin\nblood dripping from the mouth.\n\n\"I saw Arthur the Organizer. He said he'd known you for a long time.\nWhen did you meet him, Uncle Thomas? When did you first meet Arthur the\nOrganizer?\"\n\nThe head drooped lower, the shoulders slumped further forward.\n\n\"Tell me about Alien-science. What is Alien-science?\" Eric was almost\ngibbering himself now in his frantic efforts to find a key that would\nunlock his uncle's mind. \"Are Arthur the Organizer and Walter the\nWeapon-Seeker very important men among the Alien-sciencers? Are they\nthe chiefs? What was the name of the structure they were hiding in?\nWhat is it to the Monsters? They talked about other tribes, tribes\nI never heard of. How many other tribes are there? Are these other\ntribes--\"\n\nThat was it. He had found the key. He had gotten through.\n\nThomas the Trap-Smasher's head came up waveringly, dimness swirling in\nhis eyes. \"Other tribes. Funny that you should ask about other tribes.\nThat _you_ should ask.\"\n\n\"Why? What about them?\" Eric fought to hold the key in place, to keep\nit turning. \"Why shouldn't I ask about those other tribes?\"\n\n\"Your grandmother was from another tribe, a real strange tribe in a\nfaroff burrow. I remember hearing about it when I was a little boy.\"\nThomas the Trap-Smasher nodded to himself. \"Your grandfather's band\nwent on a long journey, the longest they'd ever taken. And they caught\nyour grandmother and brought her back.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"My grandmother?\" For the moment, Eric forgot what was being prepared\nfor him outside. He'd known there was some peculiar secret about his\ngrandmother. She had rarely been mentioned in Mankind. Up to now, he'd\ntaken it for granted that this was because she'd had a son who was\nterribly unlucky--almost the worst thing a person in the burrows could\nbe. A one-child litter, after all, and being killed together with his\nwife in Monster territory. Very unlucky.\n\n\"My grandmother was from another tribe? Not from Mankind?\" He knew, of\ncourse, that several of the women had been captured from other peoples\nin neighboring burrows and had the good fortune now to be considered\nfull-fledged members of Mankind. Sometimes one of their own women would\nbe lost this way, when she strayed too far down an outlying burrow and\nstumbled into a band of Stranger warriors. If you stole a woman from\nanother people, after all, you stole a substantial portion of their\nknowledge. But he'd never imagined--\n\n\"Dora the Dream-Singer.\" Thomas's head waggled loosely: he dribbled\nwords mixed with red saliva. \"Did you know why your grandmother was\ncalled the Dream-Singer, Eric? The women used to say that the things\nshe talked about happened only in dreams, and that she couldn't talk\nstraight like other people--she could only sing about her dreams. But\nshe taught your father a lot, and he was like her. Women were a little\nafraid to mate with him. My sister was the first to take a chance--and\neveryone said she deserved what she got.\"\n\nAbruptly, Eric became conscious of a change in the sounds outside the\nburrow. More quiet. Were they coming for him now?\n\n\"Uncle Thomas, listen! I have an idea. Those Strangers--Walter, Arthur\nthe Organizer--they gave me a Monster souvenir. I don't know what it\ndoes, but I can't get at it. I'll turn around. You try to reach down\ninto my knapsack with the tips of your fingers and--\"\n\nThe Trap-Smasher paid no attention to him. \"She was an\nAlien-sciencer,\" he rambled on, mostly to himself. \"Your grandmother\nwas the first Alien-sciencer we ever had in Mankind. I guess her tribe\nwere all Alien-sciencers. Imagine--a whole tribe of Alien-sciencers!\"\n\nEric groaned. This half-alive, delirious man was his only hope of\nescaping. This bloody wreck who had once been the proudest, most alert\nband captain of them all.\n\nHe turned for another look at the guard. The man was still staring\ndown the length of the great central burrow. There was nothing to be\nheard now but a terrifying silence, as if dozens of pairs of eyes were\nglowing in anticipation. And footsteps--were not those footsteps? He\nhad to find a way to make his uncle co-operate.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Thomas the Trap-Smasher!\" he said sharply, barely managing to keep his\nvoice low. \"Listen to me. This is an order! There's something in my\nknapsack, a blob of sticky stuff. We're going to turn our backs to each\nother, and you're going to reach in with your fingers and fish it out.\nDo you hear me? That's an order--a warrior's order!\"\n\nHis uncle nodded, completely docile. \"I've been a warrior for over\ntwenty auld lang synes,\" he mumbled, twisting around. \"Six of them a\nband captain. I've given orders and taken them, given them and taken\nthem. I've never disobeyed an order. What I always say is how can you\nexpect to give orders if you don't--\"\n\n\"_Now_,\" Eric told him, bringing their backs together and hunching down\nso that his knapsack would be just under his uncle's bound arms. \"Reach\nin. Work that mass of sticky stuff out. It's right on top. And hurry!\"\n\nYes. Those were footsteps coming up outside. Several of them. The\nleaders of the Female Society, the chief, an escort of warriors. And\nthe guard, watching that deadly procession, was liable to remember his\nduties and turn back to the prisoners.\n\n\"_Hurry_,\" he demanded. \"I told you to hurry, dammit! That's an order,\ntoo. Get it out fast. Fast!\"\n\nAnd, all this time, as the Trap-Smasher's fumbling fingers wandered\nabout in his knapsack, as he listened with fright and impatience to the\nsounds of the approaching execution party--all this time, somewhere in\nhis mind, there was wonderment at the orders he was rapping out to an\nexperienced band captain and the incredible authority he had managed to\nget into his voice.\n\n\"Now you're wondering where your grandmother's tribe have their\nburrow,\" Thomas began suddenly, reverting to an earlier topic as if\nthey were having a pleasant conversation after a fine, full meal.\n\n\"Forget it! Get that stuff out. Just get it out!\"\n\n\"It's hard to describe,\" the other man's voice wandered on. \"A long\nway off, their burrow is, a long way off. You know the Strangers call\nus front-burrow people. You know that, don't you? The Strangers are\nback-burrowers. Well, your grandmother's people are the bottom-most\nburrowers of all.\"\n\nEric sensed his fingers closing in the knapsack.\n\nThe three women who ruled the Female Society came into the storage\nburrow. Ottilie the Omen-Teller, Sarah the Sickness-Healer and Rita the\nRecord-Keeper. With them was the chief and two band captains, heavily\narmed.\n\n\nIX\n\nOttilie, the Chieftain's First Wife, was in the lead. She stopped, just\ninside the entrance to the burrow and the others came to a halt around\nher.\n\n\"Look at them,\" she jeered. \"They're trying to free each other! And\nwhat do they plan to do if they get themselves untied?\"\n\nFranklin moved to her side and took a long, judicious look at the two\nmen squatting back to back. \"They'll try to escape,\" he explained,\ncontinuing his wife's joke. \"They'll have their hands free, they\nfigure, and surely Thomas the Trap-Smasher and his nephew are a match,\neven bare-handed, for the best spearmen in Mankind!\"\n\nAnd then Eric felt the searching hands come up out of the knapsack\nto which his own arms were tied. Something fell to the floor of the\nburrow. It made an odd noise, halfway between a splash and a thud. He\ntwisted around for it immediately with his mouth open, flexing his\nknees in a tight crouch underneath his body.\n\n\"You've never seen anything like the burrows of your grandmother's\npeople,\" his uncle was mumbling, as if what his hands had just done\nwas no concern of the rest of him. \"And neither have I, though I've\nlistened to the tales.\"\n\n\"He won't last long now,\" Sarah the Sickness-Healer commented. \"We'll\nhave to have our fun with the boy.\"\n\n_All you do_, Walter the Weapon-Seeker had said, _is tear off a pinch\nwith your fingers. Then spit on it and throw it. Throw it as fast and\nas far as you can._\n\nHe couldn't use his fingers. But he leaned down to the red blob and\nnipped off a piece with his teeth. He brought his tongue against the\nstrange soft substance, lashing saliva into it. And simultaneously he\nkicked at the burrow floor with curved toes, straightening his legs,\njerking his thighs and body upward. Unable to use his arms for balance,\nhe tottered erect and turned, swaying, to face the leaders of his\npeople.\n\n_After you spit on it, throw it fast. As fast and as far as you can._\n\n\"I don't know what he's doing,\" someone said, \"but I don't like it. Let\nme through.\"\n\nStephen the Strong-Armed stepped ahead of the group and lifted a heavy\nspear, ready for throwing.\n\nEric shut his eyes, bent his head far back on his neck and took a deep,\ndeep breath. Then he snapped his head forward, flipping his tongue hard\nagainst the object in his mouth. He forced out his breath so abruptly\nthat the exhalation became a wild, barking cough.\n\nThe soft little mass flew out of his mouth, and he opened his eyes to\nwatch its course. For a moment, he was unable to find it anywhere; then\nhe located it by the odd expression on Stephen's face and the fearful\nupward roll of his eyes.\n\nThere was a little red splotch in the middle of the band captain's\nforehead.\n\nWhat was supposed to happen, he wondered? He had followed directions\nas well as he could under the circumstances, but he had no idea what\nthe scarlet stain, made loose and moist by his saliva, was supposed to\naccomplish. He watched it, hoping and waiting.\n\nThen Stephen the Strong-Armed brought his free hand up slowly to wipe\nthe stuff off. Eric stopped hoping. Nothing was going to happen.\n\n_Strangers_, he had begun to think despairingly, _that's what comes of\ntrusting Strangers--_\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe blast of sound was so tremendous that for a moment he thought the\nroof of the burrow had fallen in. He was slammed backwards against the\nwall and fell as if he'd been walloped with a spear haft. He remembered\nthe cough with which he'd expelled the bit of red blob from his mouth.\nHad there been a delayed echo to his cough, a gigantic, ear-splitting\necho?\n\nHe lifted his head from the floor finally, when the reverberations\nin the little storage burrow had rumbled into a comparative silence.\nSomeone was screaming. Someone was screaming over and over again.\n\nIt was Sarah. She was looking at Stephen the Strong-Armed from the\nrear. She had been standing directly behind him. Now she was staring at\nhim and screaming in sharp steady bursts.\n\nHer mouth was open so wide that it seemed she was about to tear her\njaws apart. And with each scream she lifted her arm rigidly and pointed\nto the back of Stephen's neck. She kept lifting her arm and pointing as\nif she wanted everyone present to know beyond the least doubt why and\nhow she came to be screaming.\n\nStephen the Strong-Armed had no head. His body ended at the neck, and\nflaps of skin fell down to his chest in an irregular wavy pattern. A\nfountain of blood bubbled and spurted where his head had been. His\nbody still stood upright, feet planted wide apart in a good warrior's\nstance, one arm holding the spear ready for action and the other\ncongealed in its upward motion to wipe the red blob away. It stood,\nincredibly straight and tall and alive.\n\nSuddenly, it fell apart.\n\nFirst the spear slid slowly forward out of the right hand and clattered\nto the floor. Then the arms began to fall loosely to the sagging knees\nand the entire great, brawny body slumped as if its bones had left\nit. It dropped aimlessly to the floor, an arm poking out here, a leg\ntwisting out there, in a pattern as meaningless as if an oddly shaped\nbag of skin had been flung to one side of the burrow.\n\nIt continued to twitch for a moment or two, as the bubbling fountain\nof blood turned into a sluggishly flowing river. At last it lay still,\na motionless heap of limbs and torso. Of the missing head there was no\ntrace anywhere.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSarah the Sickness-Healer stopped screaming and turned, shaking, to her\ncompanions. Their protruding eyes left the body on the floor.\n\nThen they all reacted at once.\n\nThey yelled madly, wildly, fearfully, as if they were a chorus and\nshe the conductor. Still bellowing, they made for the narrow entrance\nbehind them. They got through in a pushing, punching scramble that at\none point looked like a composite monster with dozens of arms, legs and\nswinging, naked breasts. They carried the guard outside with them, and\nwith them, too, they carried their uncontrollable panic, screaming it\ninto existence all along the great central burrow.\n\nFor a little while, Eric could hear feet pounding into the distant\ncorridors. Then there was quiet. There was quiet everywhere, except for\nThomas the Trap-Smasher's interminable mumbling.\n\nEric forced himself upright again. He was unable to imagine what had\nhappened. That red blob--the Stranger, Walter, had said it was a\nweapon, but it didn't operate like any weapon he had ever in his life\nheard of. Except possibly in the times of the ancestors: the ancestors\nwere supposed to have had things which could blow an object apart\nand leave no trace. But this was an alien artifact, a possession of\nthe Monsters which Walter the Weapon-Seeker had somehow found and\nappropriated. What was it? How had it exploded the head of Stephen the\nStrong-Armed?\n\nThat was to be worked out another time. Meanwhile, he had his chance.\nIt might not last long: he had no idea when the panic might subside and\na patrol of warriors be sent back to investigate. He stepped carefully\nacross the red stream flowing from the fallen man's neck. Squatting\ndown in front of the dropped spear, he managed to get a grip on it with\nhis bound hands and rose, holding it awkwardly behind him.\n\nNo time to cut his bonds. Not here.\n\n\"Uncle Thomas,\" he called. \"We can get away. We have a chance now. Come\non, get up!\"\n\nThe wounded band captain stared up at him without comprehension.\n\"--corridors like you've never seen or imagined,\" he continued in a low\nmonotone. \"Glow lamps that aren't on foreheads. Corridors filled with\nglow lamps. Corridors and corridors and corridors--\"\n\nFor a moment, Eric considered. The man would be a heavy liability in\nfast travel. But he couldn't desert him. This was his last surviving\nrelative, the only person who didn't consider him an outlaw and a\nthing. And, shattered as he was, also still his captain.\n\n\"Get up!\" he said again. \"Thomas the Trap-Smasher, get up! That's an\norder, a warrior's order. Get up!\"\n\nAs he'd hoped, his uncle responded to the old command. He managed to\nget his legs under his body, and strained against them, but it was no\nuse. He didn't have the energy to rise.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCasting apprehensive looks over his shoulder at the entrance to the\nstorage burrow, Eric ran to the struggling man. Working backwards, he\nmanaged to get one end of the spear under the crook of his uncle's arm.\nThen, using his own hip as a fulcrum, he levered hard at the other end.\n\nIt was painful, slippery work, since he couldn't bring all of his\nmuscles into play and it was difficult to see what he was doing. In\nbetween efforts, he gasped out orders to \"Get up, get up, get _up_,\ndamn you!\" At last the end of the spear went all the way down. His\nuncle was on his feet, staggering, but at least on his feet.\n\nDragging the spear awkwardly, Eric urged and butted him out of the\nplace. The great central burrow was empty of people. Weapons, pots and\nmiscellaneous possessions lay strewn about where they had been dropped.\nThe finished structure of the Stage stood deserted in front of the\nroyal mound. And some time before, the bodies of his uncle's wives had\nevidently been removed.\n\nThe chief and the other leaders had bolted to the left once they had\nclawed their way out of the storage burrow. They had apparently run\npast the scaffold structure and picked up the rest of Mankind in their\npanic.\n\nEric turned right.\n\nHis uncle was a problem. Thomas the Trap-Smasher kept coming to a\nbewildered halt. Again and again he began the story of his long-ago\njourney to the burrows of the strange, distant tribe. Eric had to push\nagainst him to keep him moving.\n\nOnce they were in the outlying corridors, he felt better. But not until\nthey had made many turns, passed dozens of branches and were well into\ncompletely uninhabited burrows, did he feel he could stop and saw\nhimself free of his bonds on the point of the spear. He did the same\nfor his uncle. Then, throwing the Trap-Smasher's left arm across his\nown shoulders and clutching him tightly about the waist, he started\noff again. It was slow going: his uncle was a heavy man, but the more\ndistance they could put between themselves and Mankind, the better.\n\nBut distance where? Where should they go? He pondered the problem as\nthey tottered together down the silent, branching corridors. One place\nwas as good as another. There was nowhere that they would be welcome.\nJust keep going.\n\nHe may have muttered his questions aloud. To his surprise, Thomas\nthe Trap-Smasher suddenly said in an entirely coherent but very weak\nvoice: \"The doorway to Monster territory, Eric. Make for the doorway to\nMonster territory where you went to make your Theft.\"\n\n\"Why?\" Eric asked. \"What can we do there?\"\n\nThere was no answer. His uncle's head fell forward on his chest. He was\nevidently sliding into a stupor again. And yet, somehow, as long as\nEric's encircling arm pulled at his body, the man's legs kept moving\nforward. There was some residual stamina and a warrior's determination\nin him yet.\n\nMonster territory. Was there more safety for them there now than they\ncould find among human beings?\n\nVery well then. The doorway to Monster territory. They would have to\ncome around in a wide arc through many corridors to get to it, but Eric\nknew the way. He was Eric the Eye, after all, he told himself: it was\nhis business always to know the way.\n\nBut was it? He had not enjoyed the formal initiation into manhood that\nwas the usual aftermath of a successful Theft. Without that, perhaps he\nwas still Eric the Only, still a boy and an initiate. No, he knew what\nhe was. He was Eric the Outlaw, nothing else.\n\nHe was an outlaw, without a home and a people. And, except for the\ndying man he pulled along, everyone's hand was henceforth against him.\n\n\nX\n\nThomas the Trap-Smasher had been badly injured in the surprise attack\nthat had wiped out his band. Ordinarily, he would have had his wounds\ncarefully dressed by the cleverness and accumulated experience of Sarah\nthe Sickness-Healer. Under the circumstances, however, Sarah had done\nthe reverse.\n\nNow, the strain of escape and the forced headlong flight that followed\nit had emptied his body of its last resources. His eyes were glazed\nand his strong shoulders hung slack. He was a somnambulist walking\njerkily in the direction of death.\n\nWhen they stopped to rest, Eric--after listening intently for any\nsounds of pursuit--had washed his uncle's wounds carefully with water\nfrom the canteens and had bound the uglier gashes with strips torn\nfrom a knapsack. It was all he knew how to do: warrior's first aid. A\nwoman's advanced therapeutic knowledge was needed for anything more\ncomplicated.\n\nNot that it would have made very much difference by this time. The\nTrap-Smasher was too far gone.\n\nEric felt desperate at the thought of being left alone forever in the\ndark, uninhabited corridors. He tried to force water and bits of food\nupon his uncle. The man's head rolled back, nourishment dribbling\ncarelessly down from both sides of his mouth. He was breathing lightly\nand very rapidly. His body had grown quite warm by the time they\nstopped.\n\nEric himself ate ravenously: it was his first meal in a long, long\nwhile. He kept staring at his recumbent uncle and trying to work out a\nline of action that would do some good. In the end, he had thought of\nnothing better than to hitch the man's arm up over his shoulder again\nand to keep going in the direction of Monster territory.\n\nOnce erect, the Trap-Smasher's feet began walking again, but with a\ndragging, soggy quality that became more and more pronounced. After\na while, Eric had to come to a halt: he had the feeling that he was\nhauling dead weight.\n\nWhen he tried to lower his uncle to the floor of the burrow, he found\nthat the body had become almost completely limp. Thomas lay on his\nback, his eyes staring without curiosity at the rounded ceiling upon\nwhich his forehead glow-lamp outlined a bright circular patch.\n\nThe heartbeat was very, very faint.\n\n\"Eric,\" he heard a weak voice say. He raised his eyes from his uncle's\nchest and looked at the painfully working mouth.\n\n\"Yes, uncle?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry--about--what I got you into. I had--no right.\nYour life--after all--your life. You--my wives--the band. I\nled--death--everyone. I'm sorry.\"\n\nEric fought hard to hold back his tears. \"It was for a reason, Uncle\nThomas,\" he said. \"We had a cause. It wasn't just you. The cause\nfailed.\"\n\nThere was a hideous cackle from the prone man. For a moment, Eric\nthought it was a death rattle. Then he realized that it had been a\nlaugh, but such a laugh as he had never heard before.\n\n\"A cause?\" the Trap-Smasher gasped. \"A cause? Do you know--do you--know\nwhat--the cause was? I wanted--wanted to be chief. Chief. The\nonly--only way I could--do it--Alien-science--the Strangers--a cause.\nEveryone--the killings--I wanted to--to be chief. _Chief!_\"\n\nHe went rigid as he coughed out the last word. Then slowly, like flesh\nturning into liquid, he relaxed.\n\nHe was dead.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEric stared at the body a long time. It didn't make any difference, he\nfound. The numbness in his mind remained. There was a great paralyzed\nspot in the center of his brain that was unable to think or to feel.\n\nIn the end, he shook himself, bent down and grabbed the body by the\nshoulders. Walking backwards, he dragged it in the direction of Monster\nterritory.\n\nSomething he had to do. The duty of anyone who lived in the burrows\nwhen death occurred in his neighborhood. Now it filled time and used up\nenergies that he might otherwise have expended in thoughts which were\nagonizing.\n\nThe energies which it demanded were almost more than he was capable of\nat this point. His uncle had been a heavy, well built man. Eric found\nthat he had to stop at the end of almost every curving corridor and get\nhis breath back.\n\nHe finally arrived at the doorway, grateful for the fact that his uncle\nhad died so relatively close to it. He also felt he understood why this\nhad been suggested as their destination. Thomas the Trap-Smasher had\nknown he had little time left. His nephew would have the responsibility\nof sewering him. He had tried to make it as easy for Eric as possible\nby going the greater part of the distance on his own feet.\n\nThere was a fresh-water pipe in the wall near the doorway to Monster\nterritory. And wherever there was a fresh-water pipe, the Monsters were\nlikely to have laid a sewer pipe nearby. It was down this, probably,\nthat the men killed in the battle with Stephen the Strong-Armed's band\nhad been disposed of much earlier. And it was down this that Thomas had\nknown his remains must also go--the closest point at which his nephew\ncould sewer him in comparative safety.\n\nThis much, at least, he had done for Eric's benefit.\n\nEric located the fresh-water pipe without much difficulty. There was a\nconstant low rumbling and gurgling underfoot, and--at the spot where it\nwas most pronounced--he found the slab in the floor cut at the cost of\ninfinite labor by some past generation of Mankind. Near it, after the\nslab was lifted, was another, much thicker pipe, large enough to carry\ntwo men abreast. Like the other one, the hard stuff of the burrow floor\nhad been scraped away so that a joint lay exposed.\n\nOpening the joint was another matter. Eric had seen it done many times\nby his elders, but this was his own first attempt. It was a tricky\nbusiness of tugging a heavy covering plate first right, then left, and\ngetting his fingers under the rim and pulling at just the right moment.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe joint opened at last, and the incredible stink of Monster sewage\npoured out as the liquid swirled darkly by. Death had always been\nassociated in Eric's mind with this stink, since the pipe carried not\nonly the Monster's waste matter but also that of Mankind, collected\nfrom its burrows every week by the old women who were too feeble for\nany other work. All that was not alive or useful was carried to the\nnearest Monster sewer pipe, all that might decay and foul the burrows.\nAnd that included, of course, the bodies of the dead.\n\nEric stripped his uncle's body of all useful gear as he had seen the\nwomen do many times. Then he dragged it to the hole in the burrow\nfloor and held it by one arm for a moment as the current of the sewage\ncaught it. He repeated as much of the ceremony as he could remember,\nconcluding with the words: \"_And therefore, O ancestors, I beg you to\nreceive the body of this member of Mankind, Thomas the Trap-Smasher, a\nwarrior of the first rank, a band captain of renown and the father of\nnine._\"\n\nThere was usually another line or so--\"_Take him to you and keep\nhim with you until the time when the Monsters have been destroyed\nutterly and the Earth is ours again. Then shall you and he and all\nhuman beings who have ever lived rise from the sewers and joyously\nwalk the surface of our world forever._\" But this, after all, was\na pure Ancestor-science passage; and his uncle had died fighting\nAncestor-science. What was the Alien-science equivalent? Was it likely\nto be any more potent, any less full of falsehood? In the end, Eric\nomitted those last two lines.\n\nHe let go of the stiffening arm. The body shot away and down the pipe.\nThomas the Trap-Smasher was gone, he was gone for all time, the way\nEric reasoned now. He was dead and sewered, and that was that.\n\nEric closed the joint, pulled the slab down and stamped it into place.\n\nHe was completely alone. An outlaw who could expect nothing from other\nhuman beings but death by slow torture. He had no companions, no home,\nno beliefs of any sort. His uncle's last words still lay, in all their\nstern ugliness, at the bottom of his mind. \"_I wanted to--to be chief._\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was bad enough to discover that the religion on which he had been\nraised was a mere prop to the power of the chieftainship, that the\nmysterious Female Society was completely unable to see into a person's\nfuture. But to find out that his uncle's thoughtful antagonism to such\nnonsense was based on nothing more substantial than simple personal\nambition, an ambition murderously unscrupulous and willing to sacrifice\nanybody who trusted him--well, what was there left to believe in, to\nbase a life upon?\n\nHad his father and mother been any less gullible than the most naive\nchild in the burrows? They had sacrificed themselves--for what? For one\nsuperstition as opposed to another, for the secret political maneuvers\nof this person as opposed to that.\n\nNot for him. He would be free. He laughed, bitterly and\nself-consciously. He had to be free. There was no choice: he was an\noutlaw.\n\nEric walked a few steps and put his hands on the door to Monster\nterritory. To shift it out of its socket was a hard job for one man.\nHe strained and tore his fingers; finally he managed it. The door came\naway and he deposited it carefully on the floor of the burrow.\n\nHe stared at it for a while, trying to figure out a way of getting\nit back after he'd passed through the doorway. No, a single man just\ncouldn't do that from the other side. He'd have to leave the doorway\nopen, an incredible social crime.\n\nWell, he couldn't commit a crime any more. He was beyond all rules made\nby human communities. Ahead lay the glaring white light that he and his\nkind feared so much. Into this he would go. Here, where there were no\nillusions to be found and no help to be expected, here he would make\nhis solitary outlaw home.\n\nBehind him lay the dark, safe, intricate burrows. They were tunnels,\nEric knew now, in the walls that surrounded Monster territory. Men\nlived in these walls, and shivered, and were ignorant, and made fools\nof each other. He could no longer do these things: he had to face the\nMonsters. He wanted to face them and destroy them.\n\nIt was like one of the roaches in the storage burrow declaring war on a\ncook who came in to make the evening meal for Mankind. The cook would\nroar with laughter at such a thought. Who knew what went on in the\nmind of a roach--and who cared? Yet the roach would enjoy two special\nadvantages. He had once and for all stopped crawling greedily and\naimlessly with his own kind; and the enemy he had selected could regard\nhim with nothing more than heavy oblivious contempt. If he could ever\nfor a moment find one usable weapon and one vital area on which that\nweapon could be used....\n\nHe hefted his two special advantages grimly. Then Eric the Only, the\nEye, the Outlaw, Eric the Self-Aware Individual Man, stepped through\nthe doorway into Monster territory.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n[Transcriber's Note: Heading III missing from original publication.]\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Men in the Walls, by William Tenn\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE MEN IN THE WALLS ***\n\n***** This file should be named 51122.txt or 51122.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/1/1/2/51122/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations.

The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
