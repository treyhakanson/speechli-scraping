She said mildly, \"You're late.\"\n\n\"Don't yell at me, I feel awful,\" Simon told her. He sat down at his\ndesk, passed his tongue over his teeth in distaste, groaned, fumbled in\na drawer for the aspirin bottle.\n\nHe looked over at Betty and said, almost as though reciting, \"What I\nneed is a vacation.\"\n\n\"What,\" Betty said, \"are you going to use for money?\"\n\n\"Providence,\" Simon told her whilst fiddling with the aspirin bottle,\n\"will provide.\"\n\n\"Hm-m-m. But before providing vacations it'd be nice if Providence\nturned up a missing jewel deal, say. Something where you could deduce\nthat actually the ruby ring had gone down the drain and was caught in\nthe elbow. Something that would net about fifty dollars.\"\n\nSimon said, mournful of tone, \"Fifty dollars? Why not make it five\nhundred?\"\n\n\"I'm not selfish,\" Betty said. \"All I want is enough to pay me this\nweek's salary.\"\n\n\"Money,\" Simon said. \"When you took this job you said it was the romance\nthat appealed to you.\"\n\n\"Hm-m-m. I didn't know most sleuthing amounted to snooping around\ndepartment stores to check on the clerks knocking down.\"\n\nSimon said, enigmatically, \"Now it comes.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a knock.\n\nBetty bounced up with Olympic agility and had the door swinging wide\nbefore the knocking was quite completed.\n\nHe was old, little and had bug eyes behind pince-nez glasses. His suit\nwas cut in the style of yesteryear but when a suit costs two or three\nhundred dollars you still retain caste whatever the styling.\n\nSimon said unenthusiastically, \"Good morning, Mr. Oyster.\" He indicated\nthe client's chair. \"Sit down, sir.\"\n\nThe client fussed himself with Betty's assistance into the seat,\nbug-eyed Simon, said finally, \"You know my name, that's pretty good.\nNever saw you before in my life. Stop fussing with me, young lady. Your\nad in the phone book says you'll investigate anything.\"\n\n\"Anything,\" Simon said. \"Only one exception.\"\n\n\"Excellent. Do you believe in time travel?\"\n\nSimon said nothing. Across the room, where she had resumed her seat,\nBetty cleared her throat. When Simon continued to say nothing she\nventured, \"Time travel is impossible.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Yes, why?\"\n\nBetty looked to her boss for assistance. None was forthcoming. There\nought to be some very quick, positive, definite answer. She said, \"Well,\nfor one thing, paradox. Suppose you had a time machine and traveled back\na hundred years or so and killed your own great-grandfather. Then how\ncould you ever be born?\"\n\n\"Confound it if I know,\" the little fellow growled. \"How?\"\n\nSimon said, \"Let's get to the point, what you wanted to see me about.\"\n\n\"I want to hire you to hunt me up some time travelers,\" the old boy\nsaid.\n\nBetty was too far in now to maintain her proper role of silent\nsecretary. \"Time travelers,\" she said, not very intelligently.\n\nThe potential client sat more erect, obviously with intent to hold the\nfloor for a time. He removed the pince-nez glasses and pointed them at\nBetty. He said, \"Have you read much science fiction, Miss?\"\n\n\"Some,\" Betty admitted.\n\n\"Then you'll realize that there are a dozen explanations of the\nparadoxes of time travel. Every writer in the field worth his salt has\nexplained them away. But to get on. It's my contention that within a\ncentury or so man will have solved the problems of immortality and\neternal youth, and it's also my suspicion that he will eventually be\nable to travel in time. So convinced am I of these possibilities that I\nam willing to gamble a portion of my fortune to investigate the presence\nin our era of such time travelers.\"\n\nSimon seemed incapable of carrying the ball this morning, so Betty said,\n\"But ... Mr. Oyster, if the future has developed time travel why don't\nwe ever meet such travelers?\"\n\nSimon put in a word. \"The usual explanation, Betty, is that they can't\nafford to allow the space-time continuum track to be altered. If, say, a\ntime traveler returned to a period of twenty-five years ago and shot\nHitler, then all subsequent history would be changed. In that case, the\ntime traveler himself might never be born. They have to tread mighty\ncarefully.\"\n\nMr. Oyster was pleased. \"I didn't expect you to be so well informed on\nthe subject, young man.\"\n\nSimon shrugged and fumbled again with the aspirin bottle.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMr. Oyster went on. \"I've been considering the matter for some time\nand--\"\n\nSimon held up a hand. \"There's no use prolonging this. As I understand\nit, you're an elderly gentleman with a considerable fortune and you\nrealize that thus far nobody has succeeded in taking it with him.\"\n\nMr. Oyster returned his glasses to their perch, bug-eyed Simon, but then\nnodded.\n\nSimon said, \"You want to hire me to find a time traveler and in some\nmanner or other--any manner will do--exhort from him the secret of\neternal life and youth, which you figure the future will have\ndiscovered. You're willing to pony up a part of this fortune of yours,\nif I can deliver a bona fide time traveler.\"\n\n\"Right!\"\n\nBetty had been looking from one to the other. Now she said, plaintively,\n\"But where are you going to find one of these characters--especially if\nthey're interested in keeping hid?\"\n\nThe old boy was the center again. \"I told you I'd been considering it\nfor some time. The _Oktoberfest_, that's where they'd be!\" He seemed\nelated.\n\nBetty and Simon waited.\n\n\"The _Oktoberfest_,\" he repeated. \"The greatest festival the world has\never seen, the carnival, _feria_, _fiesta_ to beat them all. Every year\nit's held in Munich. Makes the New Orleans Mardi gras look like a\nquilting party.\" He began to swing into the spirit of his description.\n\"It originally started in celebration of the wedding of some local\nprince a century and a half ago and the Bavarians had such a bang-up\ntime they've been holding it every year since. The Munich breweries do\nup a special beer, _Marzenbr\u00e4u_ they call it, and each brewery opens a\ntremendous tent on the fair grounds which will hold five thousand\ncustomers apiece. Millions of liters of beer are put away, hundreds of\nthousands of barbecued chickens, a small herd of oxen are roasted whole\nover spits, millions of pair of _weisswurst_, a very special sausage,\nmillions upon millions of pretzels--\"\n\n\"All right,\" Simon said. \"We'll accept it. The _Oktoberfest_ is one\nwhale of a wingding.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Well,\" the old boy pursued, into his subject now, \"that's where they'd\nbe, places like the _Oktoberfest_. For one thing, a time traveler\nwouldn't be conspicuous. At a festival like this somebody with a strange\naccent, or who didn't know exactly how to wear his clothes correctly, or\nwas off the ordinary in any of a dozen other ways, wouldn't be noticed.\nYou could be a four-armed space traveler from Mars, and you still\nwouldn't be conspicuous at the _Oktoberfest_. People would figure they\nhad D.T.'s.\"\n\n\"But why would a time traveler want to go to a--\" Betty began.\n\n\"Why not! What better opportunity to study a people than when they are\nin their cups? If _you_ could go back a few thousand years, the things\nyou would wish to see would be a Roman Triumph, perhaps the Rites of\nDionysus, or one of Alexander's orgies. You wouldn't want to wander up\nand down the streets of, say, Athens while nothing was going on,\nparticularly when you might be revealed as a suspicious character not\nbeing able to speak the language, not knowing how to wear the clothes\nand not familiar with the city's layout.\" He took a deep breath. \"No\nma'am, you'd have to stick to some great event, both for the sake of\nactual interest and for protection against being unmasked.\"\n\nThe old boy wound it up. \"Well, that's the story. What are your rates?\nThe _Oktoberfest_ starts on Friday and continues for sixteen days. You\ncan take the plane to Munich, spend a week there and--\"\n\nSimon was shaking his head. \"Not interested.\"\n\nAs soon as Betty had got her jaw back into place, she glared\nunbelievingly at him.\n\nMr. Oyster was taken aback himself. \"See here, young man, I realize this\nisn't an ordinary assignment, however, as I said, I am willing to risk a\nconsiderable portion of my fortune--\"\n\n\"Sorry,\" Simon said. \"Can't be done.\"\n\n\"A hundred dollars a day plus expenses,\" Mr. Oyster said quietly. \"I\nlike the fact that you already seem to have some interest and knowledge\nof the matter. I liked the way you knew my name when I walked in the\ndoor; my picture doesn't appear often in the papers.\"\n\n\"No go,\" Simon said, a sad quality in his voice.\n\n\"A fifty thousand dollar bonus if you bring me a time traveler.\"\n\n\"Out of the question,\" Simon said.\n\n\"But _why_?\" Betty wailed.\n\n\"Just for laughs,\" Simon told the two of them sourly, \"suppose I tell\nyou a funny story. It goes like this:\"\n\n       *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *\n\nI got a thousand dollars from Mr. Oyster (Simon began) in the way of an\nadvance, and leaving him with Betty who was making out a receipt, I\nhustled back to the apartment and packed a bag. Hell, I'd wanted a\nvacation anyway, this was a natural. On the way to Idlewild I stopped\noff at the Germany Information Offices for some tourist literature.\n\nIt takes roughly three and a half hours to get to Gander from Idlewild.\nI spent the time planning the fun I was going to have.\n\nIt takes roughly seven and a half hours from Gander to Shannon and I\nspent that time dreaming up material I could put into my reports to Mr.\nOyster. I was going to have to give him some kind of report for his\nmoney. Time travel yet! What a laugh!\n\nBetween Shannon and Munich a faint suspicion began to simmer in my mind.\nThese statistics I read on the _Oktoberfest_ in the Munich tourist\npamphlets. Five million people attended annually.\n\nWhere did five million people come from to attend an overgrown festival\nin comparatively remote Southern Germany? The tourist season is over\nbefore September 21st, first day of the gigantic beer bust. Nor could\nthe Germans account for any such number. Munich itself has a population\nof less than a million, counting children.\n\nAnd those millions of gallons of beer, the hundreds of thousands of\nchickens, the herds of oxen. Who ponied up all the money for such\nexpenditures? How could the average German, with his twenty-five dollars\na week salary?\n\nIn Munich there was no hotel space available. I went to the Bahnhof\nwhere they have a hotel service and applied. They put my name down,\npocketed the husky bribe, showed me where I could check my bag, told me\nthey'd do what they could, and to report back in a few hours.\n\nI had another suspicious twinge. If five million people attended this\nbeer bout, how were they accommodated?\n\nThe _Theresienwiese_, the fair ground, was only a few blocks away. I was\nstiff from the plane ride so I walked.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere are seven major brewers in the Munich area, each of them\nrepresented by one of the circuslike tents that Mr. Oyster mentioned.\nEach tent contained benches and tables for about five thousand persons\nand from six to ten thousands pack themselves in, competing for room. In\nthe center is a tremendous bandstand, the musicians all _lederhosen_\nclad, the music as Bavarian as any to be found in a Bavarian beer hall.\nHundreds of peasant garbed _fr\u00e4uleins_ darted about the tables with\nquart sized earthenware mugs, platters of chicken, sausage, kraut and\npretzels.\n\nI found a place finally at a table which had space for twenty-odd beer\nbibbers. Odd is right. As weird an assortment of Germans and foreign\ntourists as could have been dreamed up, ranging from a seventy- or\neighty-year-old couple in Bavarian costume, to the bald-headed drunk\nacross the table from me.\n\nA desperate waitress bearing six mugs of beer in each hand scurried\npast. They call them _masses_, by the way, not mugs. The bald-headed\ncharacter and I both held up a finger and she slid two of the _masses_\nover to us and then hustled on.\n\n\"Down the hatch,\" the other said, holding up his _mass_ in toast.\n\n\"To the ladies,\" I told him. Before sipping, I said, \"You know, the\ntourist pamphlets say this stuff is eighteen per cent. That's nonsense.\nNo beer is that strong.\" I took a long pull.\n\nHe looked at me, waiting.\n\nI came up. \"Mistaken,\" I admitted.\n\nA _mass_ or two apiece later he looked carefully at the name engraved on\nhis earthenware mug. \"L\u00f6wenbr\u00e4u,\" he said. He took a small notebook from\nhis pocket and a pencil, noted down the word and returned the things.\n\n\"That's a queer looking pencil you have there,\" I told him. \"German?\"\n\n\"Venusian,\" he said. \"Oops, sorry. Shouldn't have said that.\"\n\nI had never heard of the brand so I skipped it.\n\n\"Next is the Hofbr\u00e4u,\" he said.\n\n\"Next what?\" Baldy's conversation didn't seem to hang together very\nwell.\n\n\"My pilgrimage,\" he told me. \"All my life I've been wanting to go back\nto an _Oktoberfest_ and sample every one of the seven brands of the best\nbeer the world has ever known. I'm only as far as L\u00f6wenbr\u00e4u. I'm afraid\nI'll never make it.\"\n\nI finished my _mass_. \"I'll help you,\" I told him. \"Very noble endeavor.\nName is Simon.\"\n\n\"Arth,\" he said. \"How could you help?\"\n\n\"I'm still fresh--comparatively. I'll navigate you around. There are\nseven beer tents. How many have you got through, so far?\"\n\n\"Two, counting this one,\" Arth said.\n\nI looked at him. \"It's going to be a chore,\" I said. \"You've already got\na nice edge on.\"\n\nOutside, as we made our way to the next tent, the fair looked like every\nbig State-Fair ever seen, except it was bigger. Games, souvenir stands,\nsausage stands, rides, side shows, and people, people, people.\n\nThe Hofbr\u00e4u tent was as overflowing as the last but we managed to find\ntwo seats.\n\nThe band was blaring, and five thousand half-swacked voices were roaring\naccompaniment.\n\n    _In Muenchen steht ein Hofbr\u00e4uhaus!\n    Eins, Zwei, G'sufa!_\n\nAt the _G'sufa_ everybody upped with the mugs and drank each other's\nhealth.\n\n\"This is what I call a real beer bust,\" I said approvingly.\n\nArth was waving to a waitress. As in the L\u00f6wenbr\u00e4u tent, a full quart\nwas the smallest amount obtainable.\n\nA beer later I said, \"I don't know if you'll make it or not, Arth.\"\n\n\"Make what?\"\n\n\"All seven tents.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nA waitress was on her way by, mugs foaming over their rims. I gestured\nto her for refills.\n\n\"Where are you from, Arth?\" I asked him, in the way of making\nconversation.\n\n\"2183.\"\n\n\"2183 where?\"\n\nHe looked at me, closing one eye to focus better. \"Oh,\" he said. \"Well,\n2183 South Street, ah, New Albuquerque.\"\n\n\"New Albuquerque? Where's that?\"\n\nArth thought about it. Took another long pull at the beer. \"Right across\nthe way from old Albuquerque,\" he said finally. \"Maybe we ought to be\ngetting on to the Pschorrbr\u00e4u tent.\"\n\n\"Maybe we ought to eat something first,\" I said. \"I'm beginning to feel\nthis. We could get some of that barbecued ox.\"\n\nArth closed his eyes in pain. \"Vegetarian,\" he said. \"Couldn't possibly\neat meat. Barbarous. Ugh.\"\n\n\"Well, we need some nourishment,\" I said.\n\n\"There's supposed to be considerable nourishment in beer.\"\n\nThat made sense. I yelled, \"_Fr\u00e4ulein! Zwei neu bier!_\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSomewhere along in here the fog rolled in. When it rolled out again, I\nfound myself closing one eye the better to read the lettering on my\nearthenware mug. It read Augustinerbr\u00e4u. Somehow we'd evidently\nnavigated from one tent to another.\n\nArth was saying, \"Where's your hotel?\"\n\nThat seemed like a good question. I thought about it for a while.\nFinally I said, \"Haven't got one. Town's jam packed. Left my bag at the\nBahnhof. I don't think we'll ever make it, Arth. How many we got to go?\"\n\n\"Lost track,\" Arth said. \"You can come home with me.\"\n\nWe drank to that and the fog rolled in again.\n\nWhen the fog rolled out, it was daylight. Bright, glaring, awful\ndaylight. I was sprawled, complete with clothes, on one of twin beds. On\nthe other bed, also completely clothed, was Arth.\n\nThat sun was too much. I stumbled up from the bed, staggered to the\nwindow and fumbled around for a blind or curtain. There was none.\n\nBehind me a voice said in horror, \"Who ... how ... oh, _Wodo_, where'd\nyou come from?\"\n\nI got a quick impression, looking out the window, that the Germans were\ncertainly the most modern, futuristic people in the world. But I\ncouldn't stand the light. \"Where's the shade,\" I moaned.\n\nArth did something and the window went opaque.\n\n\"That's quite a gadget,\" I groaned. \"If I didn't feel so lousy, I'd\nappreciate it.\"\n\nArth was sitting on the edge of the bed holding his bald head in his\nhands. \"I remember now,\" he sorrowed. \"You didn't have a hotel. What a\nstupidity. I'll be phased. Phased all the way down.\"\n\n\"You haven't got a handful of aspirin, have you?\" I asked him.\n\n\"Just a minute,\" Arth said, staggering erect and heading for what\nundoubtedly was a bathroom. \"Stay where you are. Don't move. Don't touch\nanything.\"\n\n\"All right,\" I told him plaintively. \"I'm clean. I won't mess up the\nplace. All I've got is a hangover, not lice.\"\n\nArth was gone. He came back in two or three minutes, box of pills in\nhand. \"Here, take one of these.\"\n\nI took the pill, followed it with a glass of water.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd went out like a light.\n\nArth was shaking my arm. \"Want another _mass_?\"\n\nThe band was blaring, and five thousand half-swacked voices were roaring\naccompaniment.\n\n    _In Muenchen steht ein Hofbr\u00e4uhaus!\n    Eins, Zwei, G'sufa!_\n\nAt the _G'sufa_ everybody upped with their king-size mugs and drank each\nother's health.\n\nMy head was killing me. \"This is where I came in, or something,\" I\ngroaned.\n\nArth said, \"That was last night.\" He looked at me over the rim of his\nbeer mug.\n\nSomething, somewhere, was wrong. But I didn't care. I finished my _mass_\nand then remembered. \"I've got to get my bag. Oh, my head. Where did we\nspend last night?\"\n\nArth said, and his voice sounded cautious, \"At my hotel, don't you\nremember?\"\n\n\"Not very well,\" I admitted. \"I feel lousy. I must have dimmed out. I've\ngot to go to the Bahnhof and get my luggage.\"\n\nArth didn't put up an argument on that. We said good-by and I could feel\nhim watching after me as I pushed through the tables on the way out.\n\nAt the Bahnhof they could do me no good. There were no hotel rooms\navailable in Munich. The head was getting worse by the minute. The fact\nthat they'd somehow managed to lose my bag didn't help. I worked on that\nproject for at least a couple of hours. Not only wasn't the bag at the\nluggage checking station, but the attendant there evidently couldn't\nmake heads nor tails of the check receipt. He didn't speak English and\nmy high school German was inadequate, especially accompanied by a\nblockbusting hangover.\n\nI didn't get anywhere tearing my hair and complaining from one end of\nthe Bahnhof to the other. I drew a blank on the bag.\n\nAnd the head was getting worse by the minute. I was bleeding to death\nthrough the eyes and instead of butterflies I had bats in my stomach.\nBelieve me, _nobody_ should drink a gallon or more of Marzenbr\u00e4u.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI decided the hell with it. I took a cab to the airport, presented my\nreturn ticket, told them I wanted to leave on the first obtainable plane\nto New York. I'd spent two days at the _Oktoberfest_, and I'd had it.\n\nI got more guff there. Something was wrong with the ticket, wrong date\nor some such. But they fixed that up. I never was clear on what was\nfouled up, some clerk's error, evidently.\n\nThe trip back was as uninteresting as the one over. As the hangover\nbegan to wear off--a little--I was almost sorry I hadn't been able to\nstay. If I'd only been able to get a room I _would_ have stayed, I told\nmyself.\n\nFrom Idlewild, I came directly to the office rather than going to my\napartment. I figured I might as well check in with Betty.\n\nI opened the door and there I found Mr. Oyster sitting in the chair he\nhad been occupying four--or was it five--days before when I'd left. I'd\nlost track of the time.\n\nI said to him, \"Glad you're here, sir. I can report. Ah, what was it you\ncame for? Impatient to hear if I'd had any results?\" My mind was\nspinning like a whirling dervish in a revolving door. I'd spent a wad of\nhis money and had nothing I could think of to show for it; nothing but\nthe last stages of a grand-daddy hangover.\n\n\"Came for?\" Mr. Oyster snorted. \"I'm merely waiting for your girl to\nmake out my receipt. I thought you had already left.\"\n\n\"You'll miss your plane,\" Betty said.\n\nThere was suddenly a double dip of ice cream in my stomach. I walked\nover to my desk and looked down at the calendar.\n\nMr. Oyster was saying something to the effect that if I didn't leave\ntoday, it would have to be tomorrow, that he hadn't ponied up that\nthousand dollars advance for anything less than immediate service.\nStuffing his receipt in his wallet, he fussed his way out the door.\n\nI said to Betty hopefully, \"I suppose you haven't changed this calendar\nsince I left.\"\n\nBetty said, \"What's the matter with you? You look funny. How did your\nclothes get so mussed? You tore the top sheet off that calendar\nyourself, not half an hour ago, just before this marble-missing client\ncame in.\" She added, irrelevantly, \"Time travelers yet.\"\n\nI tried just once more. \"Uh, when did you first see this Mr. Oyster?\"\n\n\"Never saw him before in my life,\" she said. \"Not until he came in this\nmorning.\"\n\n\"This morning,\" I said weakly.\n\nWhile Betty stared at me as though it was _me_ that needed candling by a\nhead shrinker preparatory to being sent off to a pressure cooker, I\nfished in my pocket for my wallet, counted the contents and winced at\nthe pathetic remains of the thousand. I said pleadingly, \"Betty, listen,\nhow long ago did I go out that door--on the way to the airport?\"\n\n\"You've been acting sick all morning. You went out that door about ten\nminutes ago, were gone about three minutes, and then came back.\"\n\n       *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *\n\n\"See here,\" Mr. Oyster said (interrupting Simon's story), \"did you say\nthis was supposed to be amusing, young man? I don't find it so. In fact,\nI believe I am being ridiculed.\"\n\nSimon shrugged, put one hand to his forehead and said, \"That's only the\nfirst chapter. There are two more.\"\n\n\"I'm not interested in more,\" Mr. Oyster said. \"I suppose your point was\nto show me how ridiculous the whole idea actually is. Very well, you've\ndone it. Confound it. However, I suppose your time, even when spent in\nthis manner, has some value. Here is fifty dollars. And good day, sir!\"\n\nHe slammed the door after him as he left.\n\nSimon winced at the noise, took the aspirin bottle from its drawer, took\ntwo, washed them down with water from the desk carafe.\n\nBetty looked at him admiringly. Came to her feet, crossed over and took\nup the fifty dollars. \"Week's wages,\" she said. \"I suppose that's one\nway of taking care of a crackpot. But I'm surprised you didn't take his\nmoney and enjoy that vacation you've been yearning about.\"\n\n\"I did,\" Simon groaned. \"Three times.\"\n\nBetty stared at him. \"You mean--\"\n\nSimon nodded, miserably.\n\nShe said, \"But _Simon_. Fifty thousand dollars bonus. If that story was\ntrue, you should have gone back again to Munich. If there was one time\ntraveler, there might have been--\"\n\n\"I keep telling you,\" Simon said bitterly, \"I went back there three\ntimes. There were hundreds of them. Probably thousands.\" He took a deep\nbreath. \"Listen, we're just going to have to forget about it. They're\nnot going to stand for the space-time continuum track being altered. If\nsomething comes up that looks like it might result in the track being\nchanged, they set you right back at the beginning and let things\nstart--for you--all over again. They just can't allow anything to come\nback from the future and change the past.\"\n\n\"You mean,\" Betty was suddenly furious at him, \"you've given up! Why\nthis is the biggest thing-- Why the fifty thousand dollars is nothing.\nThe future! Just think!\"\n\nSimon said wearily, \"There's just one thing you can bring back with you\nfrom the future, a hangover compounded of a gallon or so of Marzenbr\u00e4u.\nWhat's more you can pile one on top of the other, and another on top of\nthat!\"\n\nHe shuddered. \"If you think I'm going to take another crack at this\nmerry-go-round and pile a fourth hangover on the three I'm already\nnursing, all at once, you can think again.\"\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Astounding Science Fiction_ June 1959.\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
