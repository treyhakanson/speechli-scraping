It's good.\"\n\n\"The two smoked pork chops left over from yesterday evening,\"\nLoudons said, \"and that bowl of rice that's been taking up space\nin the refrigerator the last couple of days, together with a\nlittle egg powder and some milk. I ground the chops up and mixed\nthem with the rice and other stuff. Then added some bacon, to\nmake grease to fry it in.\"\n\nAltamont chuckled. That was Loudons, all right: he could take a\nfew left-overs, mess them together, pop them in the skillet, and\nhave a meal that would turn the chef back at the Fort green with\nenvy. He filled his cup and offered the pot.\n\n\"Caffchoc?\" he asked.\n\nLoudons held his cup out to be filled, blew on it, sipped, and\nthen hunted on the ledge under the desk for the butt of the cigar\nhe had half-smoked the evening before.\n\n\"Did you ever drink coffee, Monty?\" the socio-psychologist asked,\ngetting the cigar drawing to his taste.\n\n\"Coffee? No. I've read about it, of course. We'll have to\norganize an expedition to Brazil, sometime, to get seeds and try\nraising some.\"\n\nLoudons blew a smoke ring toward the rear of the cabin.\n\n\"A much overrated beverage,\" he replied. \"We found some, once,\nwhen I was on that expedition into Idaho, in what must have been\nthe stockroom of a hotel. Vacuum-packed in moisture-proof\ncontainers, and free from radioactivity. It wasn't nearly as good\nas caffchoc.\n\n\"But then, I suppose, a pre-bustup coffee drinker couldn't\nstomach this stuff we're drinking.\"\n\nLoudons looked forward, up the river they were following. \"Get\nanything on the radio?\" he asked. \"I noticed you took us up to\nabout ten thousand, while I was shaving.\"\n\nAltamont got out his pipe and tobacco pouch, filling the former\nslowly and carefully.\n\n\"Not a whisper. I tried Colony Three, in the Ozarks, and I tried\nto call in that tribe of workers in Louisiana. I couldn't get\neither.\"\n\n\"Maybe if we tried to get a little more power on the set....\"\n\nThat was Loudons, too, Altamont thought. There wasn't a better\nman at the Fort, when it came to dealing with people. But\nconfront him with a problem about things and he was lost.\n\nThat was one of the reasons why he and the stocky, phlegmatic social\nscientist made such a good team, he thought. As far as he, himself,\nwas concerned, people were just a mysterious, exasperatingly\nunpredictable order of things which were subject to no known natural\nlaws.\n\nAnd Loudons thought the same thing about machines: he couldn't\npsychoanalyze them.\n\nAltamont gestured with his pipe toward the nuclear-electric\nconversion unit, between the control-cabin and the living\nquarters in the rear of the boxcar-sized helicopter.\n\n\"We have enough power back there to keep this windmill in the air\ntwenty-four hours a day, three hundred and sixty-five days a\nyear, for the next fifteen years,\" he said. \"We just don't have\nenough radio. If I'd step up the power on this set any more, it'd\nburn out before I could say, 'Altamont calling Fort Ridgeway.'\"\n\n\"How far are we from Pittsburgh now?\" Loudons wanted to know.\n\nAltamont looked across the cabin at the big map of the United\nStates as they had been, the red and green and blue and yellow\npatchwork of vanished political divisions. The colors gleamed\nthrough the transparent overlay on which this voyage of\nre-discovery was plotted.\n\nThe red line of their journey started at Fort Ridgeway, in what\nhad been Arizona. It angled east by a little north, to Colony\nThree, in northern Arkansas ... sharply northeast to St. Louis\nand its lifeless ruins ... then to Chicago and Gary, where little\nbands of Stone Age reversions stalked and fought and ate each\nother ... Detroit, where things that had completely forgotten\nthey were human emerged from their burrows only at night ...\nCleveland, where a couple of cobalt bombs must have landed in the\nlake and drenched everything with radioactivity that still\nlingered after two centuries ... Akron, where vegetation was only\nbeginning to break through the glassy slag ... Cincinnati, where\nthey had last stopped....\n\n\"How's the leg this morning, Jim?\" he asked.\n\n\"Little stiff. Doesn't hurt much, though.\"\n\n\"Why, we're about fifty miles, as we follow that river, and\nthat's relatively straight.\" He looked down through the\ntransparent nose of the copter at a town, now choked with trees\nthat grew among the tumbled walls. \"I think that's Aliquippa.\"\n\nLoudons looked and shrugged, then looked again and pointed.\n\n\"There's a bear. Just ducked into that church or movie theater or\nwhatever. I wonder what he thinks we are.\"\n\nAltamont puffed slowly at his pipe. \"I wonder if we're going to\nfind anything at all in Pittsburgh.\"\n\n\"You mean people, as distinct from those biped beasts we've found\nso far? I doubt it,\" Loudons replied, finishing his caffchoc and\nwiping his mustache with the back of his hand. \"I think the whole\neastern half of the country is nothing but forest like this, and\nthe highest type of life is just about three cuts below Homo\nNeanderthalensis, almost impossible to contact, and even more\nimpossible to educate.\"\n\n\"I wasn't thinking about that. I've just about given up hope of\nfinding anybody or even a reasonably high level of barbarism,\"\nAltamont said. \"I was thinking about that cache of microfilmed\nbooks that was buried at the Carnegie Library.\"\n\n\"If it was buried,\" Loudons qualified. \"All we have is that\narticle in that two-century-old copy of Time about how the\npeople at the library had constructed the crypt and were\nbeginning the microfilming. We don't know if they ever had a\nchance to get it finished, before the rockets started landing.\"\n\nThey passed over a dam of flotsam that had banked up at a\nwrecked bridge and accumulated enough mass to resist the periodic\nfloods that had kept the river usually clear. Three human figures\nfled across a sand-flat at one end of it and disappeared into the\nwoods. Two of them carried spears tipped with something that\nsparkled in the sunlight, probably shards of glass.\n\n\"You know, Monty, I get nightmares, sometimes, thinking about\nwhat things must be like in Europe,\" Loudons said.\n\nFive or six wild cows went crashing through the brush below.\nAltamont nodded when he saw them.\n\n\"Maybe tomorrow, we'll let down and shoot a cow,\" he said. \"I was\nlooking in the freeze-locker and the fresh meat's getting a\nlittle low. Or a wild pig, if we find a good stand of oak trees.\nI could enjoy what you'd do with some acorn-fed pork.\"\n\nHe looked across the table. \"Finished?\" he asked Loudons. \"Take\nover, then. I'll go back and wash the dishes.\"\n\nThey rose, and Loudons, favoring his left leg, moved over to the\nseat at the controls.\n\nAltamont gathered up the two cups, the stainless-steel dishes,\nand the knives and the forks and spoons, going up the steps over\nthe shielded converter and ducking his head to avoid the seat in\nthe forward top machine-gun turret. He washed and dried the\ndishes, noting with satisfaction that the gauge of the water tank\nwas still reasonably high, and glanced out one of the windows.\nLoudons was taking the big helicopter upstairs, for a better\nview.\n\nNow and then, among the trees, there would be a glint of glassy\nslag, usually in a fairly small circle. That was to be expected:\nbeside the three or four H-bombs that had fallen on the\nPittsburgh area, mentioned in the transcripts of the last news to\nreach the Fort from the outside, the whole district had been\npelted, more or less at random, with fission bombs.\n\nWest of the confluence of the Allegheny and the Monongahela, it\nwould probably be worse than this.\n\n\"Can you see Pittsburgh yet, Jim?\" he called out.\n\n\"Yes, it's a mess! Worse than Gary, worse than Akron even.\"\n\n\"Monty! Come here! I think I have something!\"\n\nPicking up the pipe he had laid down, Altamont hurried forward,\ndodging his six-foot length under the gun turret and swinging\ndown from the walkway over the converter.\n\n\"What is it?\" he asked.\n\n\"Smoke. A lot of smoke, twenty or thirty fires at the very\nleast.\"\n\nLoudons had shifted from Forward to Hover and was peering through\na pair of binoculars. \"See that island, the long one? Across the\nriver from it, on the north side, toward this end. Yes, by\nEinstein! And I can see cleared ground, and what I think are\nhouses, inside a stockade....\"\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nMurray Hughes walked around the corner of the cabin into the\nmorning sunlight, lacing his trousers, with his hunting shirt\nthrown over his bare shoulders. He found, without much surprise,\nthat his father had also slept late. Verner Hughes was just\nbeginning to shave.\n\nInside the kitchen, his mother and the girls were clattering pots\nand skillets.\n\nOutside the kitchen door, his younger brother, Hector, was\nnoisily chopping wood.\n\nGoing through the door, he filled another of the light-metal\nbasins with hot water, found his razor, and went outside again,\nsetting the basin on the bench.\n\nMost of the ware in the Hughes cabin was of light-metal. Murray\nand his father had mined it in the dead city up the river, from a\nplace where it had floated to the top of a puddle of slag, back\nwhen the city had been blasted, at the end of the hard times.\n\nIt had been hard work, but the stuff had been easy to carry down\nto where they had hidden their boat. And, for once, they'd had no\ntrouble with the Scowrers.\n\nToo bad they couldn't say as much for yesterday's hunting trip!\n\nAs he rubbed lather into the stubble on his face, he cursed with\nirritation. That had been a bad-luck hunt, all around.\n\nThey had gone out before dawn, hunting into the hills to the\nnorth. They'd spent the day at it, and shot one small wild pig.\nLucky it was small, at that. They'd have had to abandon a\nfull-grown one, after the Scowrers had began hunting them. Six of\nthem, as big a band as he'd ever seen together at one time, had\nmanaged to cut them off from the stockade. He and his father had\nbeen forced to circle miles out of their way.\n\nHis father had shot one, and he'd had to leave his hatchet\nsticking in the skull of another, when his rifle had misfired.\n\nThat meant a trip to the gunsmith's, for a new hatchet and to\nhave the mainspring of the rifle replaced. Nobody could afford to\nhave a rifle that couldn't be trusted, least of all a hunter and\nprospector.\n\nOn top of everything else, he had had a few words with Alex\nBarrett, the gunsmith, the other day.\n\nWell, at least that could be smoothed over. Barrett would be glad\nto do business with him, once the gunsmith saw that hard\ntool-steel he had dug out of that place down the river. Hardest\nsteel either he or his father had ever found, and it hadn't been\natom-spoiled, either.\n\nHe cleaned, wiped and stropped his razor and put it back in the\ncase. He threw out the wash-water on the compost pile and went\ninto the cabin, putting on his shirt and his belt. Then he passed\nthrough to the front porch, where his father was already eating\nat the table.\n\nThe people of the Toon like to eat in the open. It was something\nthey'd always done, just as they'd always like to eat together in\nthe evenings.\n\nHe sweetened his cup of chicory with a lump of maple sugar and\nbegan to sip it before he sat down, standing with one foot on the\nbench and looking down across the parade ground, past the\nAitch-Cue House, toward the river and the wall.\n\n\"If you're coming around to Alex's way of thinking--and mine--it\nwon't hurt you to admit it, son,\" his father said.\n\nMurray turned, looking at his father with the beginning of anger,\nand then he grinned. The elders were constantly keeping the young\nmen alert with these tests. He checked back over his actions\nsince he had come out onto the porch.\n\n... to the table, sugar in his chicory, one foot on the bench ...\nwhich had reminded him again of the absence of the hatchet from\nhis belt and brought an automatic frown ... then the glance\ntoward the gunsmith's shop, and across the parade ground ... the\nglance including the houses into which so much labor had gone,\nthe wall that had been built from rubble and topped with pointed\nstakes, the white slabs of marble that marked the graves of the\nFirst Tenant and the men of the Old Toon....\n\nHe had thought, at that moment, that maybe his father and Alex\nBarrett and Reader Rawson and Tenant Mycroft Jones and the others\nwere right: there were too many things here that could not be\nmoved along with them, if they decided to move.\n\nIt would be false modesty, refusal to see things as they were, not\nto admit that he was the leader of the younger men, and the boys of\nthe Irregulars. He had been forced to face the responsibilities of\nthat fact since last winter.\n\nThen, the usual theological arguments about the proper order of\nthe Sacred Books and the true nature of the Risen One had been\nreplaced by a violent controversy when Sholto Jiminez and Birdy\nEdwards had reopened the old question of the advisability of\nmoving the Toon and settling elsewhere.\n\nHe had been in favor of the idea himself and found that the other\nyoung men had followed his lead. But, for the last month or so,\nhe had begun to doubt the wisdom of it.\n\nIt was probably reluctance to admit this to himself that had\nbrought on the strained feelings between himself and his old\nfriend, the gunsmith.\n\n\"I'll have to drill the Irregulars, today,\" he said. \"Birdy\nEdwards has been drilling them while we've been hunting. But I'll\ngo up and see Alex about a new hatchet and fixing my rifle. I'll\nhave a talk with him.\"\n\nHe stepped forward to the edge of the porch, still munching on a\nhoney-dipped piece of cornbread, and glanced up at the sky. That\nwas a queer bird; he had never seen a bird with a wing action\nlike that.\n\nThen he realized that the object was not a bird at all.\n\nHis father was staring at it, too.\n\n\"Murray! That's ... that's like the old stories from the time of\nthe wars!\"\n\nBut Murray was already racing across the parade ground toward the\nAitch-Cue House, where the big iron ring hung by its chain from a\ngallows-like post, with a hammer beside it.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nThe stockaded village became larger, details grew plainer, as the\nhelicopter came slanting down and began spiraling around it.\n\nIt was a fairly big place, some forty or fifty acres in a rough\nparallelogram, surrounded by a wall of varicolored stone and\nbrick and concrete rubble from old ruins, topped with a palisade\nof pointed poles. There was a small jetty projecting into the\nriver, to which six or eight boats of different sorts were tied;\na gate opened onto this from the wall.\n\nInside the stockade, there were close to a hundred buildings,\nranging from small cabins to a structure with a belfry. It seemed\nto have been a church, partly ruined in the war of two centuries\nago and later rebuilt.\n\nA stream came down from the woods, across the cultivated land\naround the fortified village. There was a rough flume which\ncarried the water from a dam close to the edge of the forest and\nprovided a fall to turn a mill wheel.\n\n\"Look, strip farming,\" Loudons pointed. \"See the alternate strips\nof grass and plowed ground. These people understand soil\nconservation.\n\n\"They have horses, too.\"\n\nAs he spoke, three riders left the village at a gallop. They\nseparated, and the people in the fields, who had all started for\nthe village, turned and began hurrying toward the woods. Two of\nthe riders headed for a pasture in which cattle had been grazing\nand started herding them also into the woods.\n\nFor a while, there was a scurrying of little figures in the\nvillage below. Then, not a moving thing was in sight.\n\n\"There's good organization,\" Loudons said. \"Everybody seems to\nknow what to do, and how to get it done promptly. And look how\nneat the whole place is. Policed up. I'll bet anything we'll find\nthat they have a military organization, or a military tradition\nat least.\n\n\"We'll have a lot to find out: you can't understand a people until\nyou understand their background and their social organization.\"\n\n\"Humph. Let me have a look at their artifacts: that will tell\nwhat kind of people they are,\" Altamont said, swinging the\nglasses back and forth over the enclosure. \"Water-power mill,\nwater-power sawmill--building on the left side of the water\nwheel, see the pile of fresh lumber beside it. Blacksmith shop,\nand from that chimney, I'd say a small foundry, too.\n\n\"Wonder what that little building out on the tip of the island\nis, it has a water wheel too. Undershot wheel, and it looks like\nit could be raised or lowered. Now, I wonder....\"\n\n\"Monty, I think we ought to land right in the middle of the\nenclosure, on that open plaza thing, in front of the building\nthat looks like a reconditioned church. That's probably the Royal\nPalace, or the Pentagon, or the Kremlin, or whatever.\"\n\nAltamont started to object, paused, and then nodded. \"I think\nyou're right, Jim. From the way they scattered, and got their\nlivestock into the woods, they probably expect us to bomb them.\nWe have to get inside and that's the quickest way to do it.\" He\nthought for a moment. \"We'd better be armed, when we go out.\nPistols, auto-carbines, and a few of those concussion-grenades in\ncase we have to break up a concerted attack. I'll get them.\"\n\nThe plaza, the houses and the cabins around it, the\ntwo-hundred-year-old church, all were silent and apparently\nlifeless as they set the helicopter down. Once Loudons caught a\nmovement inside the door of a house, and saw a metallic glint.\n\n\"There's a gun up there,\" he said. \"Looks like a four-pounder.\nBrass. I knew that smith-shop was also a foundry. See that little\ncurl of smoke? That's the gunner's slow-match.\n\n\"I'd thought maybe that thing on the island was a powder mill.\nThat would be where they'd put it. Probably extract their niter\nfrom the dung of their horses and cows. Sulfur probably from\ncoal-mine drainage.\n\n\"Jim, this is really something!\"\n\n\"I hope they don't cut loose with that thing,\" Loudons said,\nlooking apprehensively at the brass-rimmed black muzzle that was\ncovering them from the belfry. \"I wonder if we ought to--Oh-oh,\nhere they come!\"\n\nThree or four young men stepped out of the wide door of the old\nchurch. They wore fringed buckskin trousers and buckskin shirts\nand odd caps of deerskin with visors to shade the eyes and\nsimilar beaks behind to protect the neck. They had powder horns\nand bullet pouches slung over their shoulders, and long rifles in\ntheir hands. They stepped aside as soon as they were out.\nCarefully avoiding any gesture of menace, they simply stood,\nwatching the helicopter which had landed in their village.\n\nThree other men followed them out. They, too, wore buckskins and\nthe odd double-visored caps. One had a close-cropped white beard,\nand on the shoulders of his buckskin shirt, he wore the single\nsilver bars of a first lieutenant of the vanished United States\nArmy. He had a pistol on his belt. The pistol had the saw-handle\ngrip of an automatic, but it was a flintlock, as were the rifles\nof the young men who stood so watchfully on either side of the\ndoor.\n\nTwo middle-aged men accompanied the bearded man and the trio\nadvanced toward the helicopter.\n\n\"All right, come on, Monty.\"\n\nLoudons opened the door and let down the steps. Picking up an\nauto-carbine, he slung it and stepped out of the helicopter,\nAltamont behind him. They advanced to meet the party from the\nchurch, halting when they were about twenty feet apart.\n\n\"I must apologize, lieutenant, for dropping in on you so\nunceremoniously.\"\n\nLoudons stopped, wondering if the man with the white beard\nunderstood a word of what he was saying.\n\n\"The natural way to come in, when you travel in the air,\" the old\nman replied. \"At least, you came in openly. I can promise you a\nbetter reception than that you got at the city to the west of us\na couple of days ago.\"\n\n\"Now how did you know that we had trouble the\nday-before-yesterday?\" Loudons demanded.\n\nThe old man's eyes sparkled with child-like pleasure. \"That\nsurprises you, my dear sir? In a moment, I daresay you'll be\nsurprised at the simplicity of it.\n\n\"You have a nasty rip in the left leg of your trousers, and the\ncloth around it is stained with blood. Through the rip, I\nperceive a bandage. Obviously, you have suffered a recent wound.\nI further observe that the side of your flying machine bears\nrecent scratches, as though from the spears or throwing hatchets\nof the Scowrers. Evidently, they attacked you as you were\nlanding. It is fortunate that these cannibal devils are too\nstupid and too anxious for human flesh to exercise patience.\"\n\n\"Well, that explains how you knew that we'd recently been\nattacked,\" Loudons told him. \"But how did you guess that it had\nbeen to the west of here, in a ruined city?\"\n\n\"I never guess,\" the oldster with the silver bar and the\nkeystone-shaped red patch on his left shoulder replied. \"It is a\nshocking habit--destructive to the logical faculties. What seems\nstrange to you is only so because you do not follow my train of\nthought.\n\n\"For example, the wheels and their framework under your flying\nmachine are splashed with mud which seems to be predominantly\nbrick-dust, mixed with plaster. Obviously, you landed recently in\na dead city, either during or after a rain. There was a rain here\nyesterday evening, the wind being from the west. Obviously, you\nfollowed behind the rain as it came up the river. And now that I\nlook at your boots, I see traces of the same sort of mud, around\nthe soles and in front of the heels.\n\n\"But this is heartless of us, keeping you standing here on a\nwounded leg, sir. Come in, and let our medic take a look at it.\"\n\n\"Well, thank you, lieutenant,\" Loudons replied. \"But don't bother\nyour medic. I've attended to the wound myself, and it wasn't\nserious to begin with.\"\n\n\"You are a doctor?\" the white-haired man asked.\n\n\"Of sorts. A sort of general scientist. My name is Loudons. My\nfriend, Mr. Altamont, here, is a scientist, too.\"\n\nThere was an immediate reaction: all three of the elders of the\nvillage, and the young riflemen who had accompanied them,\nexchanged glances of surprise.\n\nLoudons dropped his hand to the grip of his slung auto-carbine\nand Altamont sidled away from his partner, his hand moving as if\nby accident toward the butt of his pistol. The same thought was\nin both men's minds, that these people might feel, as the\nheritage of the war of two centuries ago, a hostility to science\nand scientists.\n\nThere was no hostility, however, in their manner as the old man\ncame forward with outstretched hand.\n\n\"I am Tenant Mycroft Jones, the Toon Leader here,\" he said. \"This\nis Stamford Rawson, our Reader, and Verner Hughes, our Toon\nSarge. This is his son, Murray Hughes, the Toon Sarge of the\nIrregulars.\n\n\"But come into the Aitch-Cue House, gentlemen. We have much to\ntalk about.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBy this time, the villagers had begun to emerge from the log\ncabins and rubble-walled houses around the plaza and the old\nchurch. Some of them, mostly the young men, were carrying rifles,\nbut the majority were unarmed. About half of them were women, in\nshort deerskin skirts or homespun dresses. There were a number of\nchildren, the younger ones almost completely naked.\n\n\"Sarge,\" the old man told one of the youths, \"post a guard over\nthis flying machine. Don't let anybody meddle with it. And have\nall the noncoms and techs report here, on the double.\" He turned\nand shouted up at the truncated steeple: \"Atherton, sound 'All\nClear!'\"\n\nA horn up in the belfry began blowing, apparently to advise the\npeople who had run from the fields into the forest that there was\nno danger.\n\nThey went through the open doorway of the old stone church and\nentered the big room inside. The building had evidently once been\ngutted by fire, two centuries ago, but portions of the wall had\nbeen restored. The floor had been replaced by one of rough\nplanks, and there was a plank ceiling at about ten feet.\n\nThe room was apparently used as a community center. There were a\nnumber of benches and chairs, all very neatly made; and along one\nwall, out of the way, ten or fifteen long tables had been\nstacked, the tops in a pile and the trestles on the tops.\n\nThe walls were decorated with trophies of weapons--a number of\nM-12 rifles and M-16 submachine-guns, all in good, clean\ncondition; a light machine rifle; two bazookas. Among them were\ncruder weapons, stone-and metal-tipped spears and clubs, the work\nof the wild men of the woods.\n\nA stairway led to the second floor, and it was up this stairway\nthat the man who bore the title of Toon Leader conducted them, to\na small room furnished with a long table, a number of chairs, and\nseveral big wooden chests bound with iron.\n\n\"Sit down, gentlemen,\" the Toon Leader invited, going to a\ncupboard and producing a large bottle stoppered with a corncob\nand a number of small cups.\n\n\"It's a little early in the day,\" he went on, \"but this is a very\nspecial occasion.\n\n\"You smoke a pipe, I take it?\" he asked Altamont. \"Then try some\nof this, of our own growth and curing.\"\n\nHe extended a doeskin moccasin, which seemed to be the tobacco\ncontainer.\n\nAltamont looked at the thing dubiously, then filled his pipe from\nit.\n\nThe oldster drew his pistol, pushed a little wooden plug into the\nvent, added some tow to the priming, and, aiming at the wall,\nsnapped it. Evidently, at time the formality of plugging the vent\nhad been overlooked: there were a number of holes in the wall\nthere.\n\nThis time, however, the pistol didn't go off. The old man shook\nout the smoldering tow, blew it into flame, and lit a candle from\nit, offering the light to Altamont.\n\nLoudons got out a cigar and lit it from the candle; the others\nfilled and lighted pipes. The Toon Leader reprimed his pistol,\nthen holstered it, took off his belt and laid it aside, an\nexample the others followed.\n\nThey drank ceremoniously, and then seated themselves at the\ntable. As they did, two more men entered the room. They were\nintroduced as Alexander Barrett, the gunsmith and Stanley\nMarkovitch, the distiller.\n\nThe Toon Leader began by asking, \"You come, then, from the west?\"\n\n\"Are you from Utah?\" the gunsmith interrupted, suspiciously.\n\n\"Why, no, we're from Arizona. A place called Fort Ridgeway,\"\nLoudons said.\n\nThe others nodded, in the manner of people who wish to conceal\nignorance. It was obvious that none of them had ever heard of\nFort Ridgeway, or Arizona either.\n\n\"You say you come from a fort? Then the wars aren't over yet?\"\nSarge Hughes asked.\n\n\"The wars have been over for a long time. You know how terrible\nthey were. You know how few in all the countries were left\nalive,\" Loudons said.\n\n\"None that we know of, beside ourselves and the Scowrers, until\nyou came,\" the Toon Leader said.\n\n\"We have found only a few small groups, in the whole country, who\nhave managed to save anything of the Old Times. Most of them\nlived in little villages and cultivated land. A few had horses or\ncows. None, that we have ever found before, made guns and powder\nfor themselves. But they remembered that they were men, and did\nnot eat one another.\n\n\"Whenever we find a group of people like this, we try to persuade\nthem to let us help them.\"\n\n\"Why?\" the Toon Leader asked. \"Why do you do this for people that\nyou have never met before? What do you want from them--from\nus--in return for your help?\"\n\nHe was speaking to Altamont, rather than to Loudons. It seemed\nobvious that he believed Altamont to be the leader and Loudons\nthe subordinate.\n\n\"Because we are trying to bring back the best of the Old Times,\"\nAltamont told him. \"Look, you have had troubles, here. So have\nwe, many times. Years when the crops didn't ... didn't....\" He\nlooked at Loudons, aware that his partner should be talking now,\nand also suddenly aware that Loudons had recognized the situation\nand left the leadership up to him....\n\n\"... years that the crops failed. Years of storms, or floods.\nTroubles with those beast-men in the woods.\n\n\"And you were alone, as we were, with no one to help.\n\n\"We want to put all men who are still men in touch with one\nanother, so that they can help each other in trouble, and work\ntogether.\n\n\"If this isn't done, everything that makes men different from\nbeasts will soon be no more.\"\n\n\"He's right. One of us, alone, is helpless,\" the Reader said. \"It\nis only in the Toon that there is strength. He wants to organize\na Toon of all Toons.\"\n\n\"That's about it. We are beginning to make helicopters, like the\none Loudons and I came in. We'll furnish your community with one\nor more of them. We can give you a radio, so that you can\ncommunicate with other communities. We can give you rifles and\nmachine guns and ammunition, to fight the--the Scowrers, did you\ncall them? And we can give you atomic engines, so that you can\nbuild machines for yourselves.\"\n\n\"Some of our people,--Alex Barrett here, the gunsmith, and Stan\nMarkovitch, the distiller, and Harrison Grant, the iron-worker--get\ntheir living by making things. How'd they make out, after your machines\ncame in here?\" Verner Hughes asked.\n\n\"We've thought of that. We had that problem with other groups\nwe've helped,\" Loudons said. \"In some communities, everybody owns\neverything in common and so we don't have much of a problem. Is\nthat the way you do it, here?\"\n\n\"Well, no. If a man makes a thing, or digs it out of the ruins,\nor catches it in the woods, it's his.\"\n\n\"Then we'll work out some way. Give the machines to the people\nwho are already in a trade, or something like that. We'll have to\ntalk it over with you and with the people concerned.\"\n\n\"How is it you took so long finding us?\" Alex Barrett asked.\n\"It's been two hundred or so years since the Wars.\"\n\n\"Alex! You see but you do not observe!\" The Toon Leader rebuked.\n\"These people have their flying machines, which are highly\ncomplicated mechanisms. They would have to make tools and\nmachines to make them, and tools and machines to make those tools\nand machines. They would have to find materials, often going in\nsearch of them. The marvel is not that they took so long, but\nthat they did it so quickly.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Altamont said. \"Originally, Fort Ridgeway was a\nmilitary research and development center. As the country became\ndisorganized, the Government set this project up to develop ways\nof improvising power and transportation and communication methods\nand extracting raw materials. If they'd had a little more time,\nthey might have saved the country.\n\n\"As it was, they were able to keep themselves alive, and keep\nsomething like civilization going at the Fort, while the whole\ncountry was breaking apart around them.\n\n\"Then, when the rockets stopped falling, they started to rebuild.\nFortunately, more than half the technicians at the Fort were\nwomen, so there was no question of them dying out.\n\n\"But it's only been in the last twenty years that we've been able\nto make nuclear-electric engines, and this is the first time any\nof us have gotten east of the Mississippi.\"\n\n\"How did your group manage to survive?\" Loudons asked. \"You call\nit the Toon. I suppose that's what the word platoon has become,\nwith time. You were, originally, a military platoon?\"\n\n\"Pla-toon!\" the white-bearded man said. \"Of all the unpardonable\nstupidities! Of course that's what it was. And the title, Tenant,\nwas originally lieu-tenant. I know that, though we have dropped\nall use of the first part of the word. But that should have led\nme, if I had used my wits, to deduce platoon from toon.\"\n\nThe Tenant shook his head in dismay at his stupidity and Loudons\nfound himself forced to say, \"One syllable like that could have\ncome from many words.\"\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nThe Tenant smiled at Loudons and said, \"Your courtesy does not\nexcuse our stupidity. We know our history and we should have\nidentified the word accurately.\n\n\"Yes, we were originally a ... a pla-toon of soldiers, two hundred\nyears ago, at the time when the Wars ended. The old Toon, and the\nFirst Tenant, were guarding POWs, and there, sir,\"--to Loudons--\"is a\nword we cannot trace. We have no idea what they were. In any event,\nthe pows were all killed by a big bomb, and the First Tenant,\nLieutenant Gilbert Dunbar, took his platoon and started to march to\nDeeCee, where the government was.\n\n\"But there was no government any more.\n\n\"They fought with people along the way. When they needed food, or\nammunition, or animals to pull their wagons, they took them, and\nkilled those who tried to prevent them. Other people joined the\ntoon, and when they found women they wanted, they took them.\n\n\"They did all sorts of things that would have been crimes if\nthere had been any law, but since there was no law, it was\nobvious that they could be no crime.\n\n\"The First Ten--Lieutenant--kept his men together, because he had\nThe Books. Each evening, at the end of each day's march, he read\nto his men out of them.\"\n\nAltamont knew without looking at his associate that Loudons would\nbe inconspicuously jotting down notes. The last was an item the\nsociologist would be sure to record: the white-bearded Tenant had\npronounced that reference to a written testament in capital\nletters.\n\nThe story was continuing....\n\n\"... finally, they came here. There had been a town here, but it\nhad been burned and destroyed, and there were people camping in\nthe ruins.\n\n\"Some of them fought and were killed, others came in and joined\nthe platoon.\n\n\"At first, they built shelters around this building and made this\ntheir fort. Then they cleared away the ruins, and built new\nhouses. When the cartridges for the rifles began to get scarce,\nthey began to make gunpowder, and new rifles, like these we are\nusing now, to shoot without cartridges.\n\n\"Lieutenant Dunbar did this out of his own knowledge because\nthere is nothing in The Books about making gunpowder. The guns in\nThe Books are rifles and shotguns and revolvers and airguns.\nExcept for the airguns, which we haven't been able to make, these\nall shot cartridges.\n\n\"As with your people, we did not die out because we too had\nwomen. Neither did we increase greatly--too many died or were\nkilled young. But several times we've had to tear down the wall\nand rebuild it, to make room inside for more houses. And we've\nbeen clearing out a little more land for the fields each year.\n\n\"We still read and follow the teachings of The Books: we have\nmade laws for ourselves out of them.\"\n\nThere was a silence during which Altamont felt himself to be the\nfocus of attention; not obtrusively, but, nonetheless, insistently.\nHowever, this was Loudon's field and Altamont preferred not to\nspeak.\n\n\"And we are waiting for the Slain and Risen One,\" Tenant Jones\nadded, and there was no doubt that he was looking at Altamont\nintently. \"It is impossible that He will not, sooner or later,\ndeduce the existence of this community, if He has not done so\nalready.\"\n\nAgain the silence and lack of movement, broken by Loudons this\ntime, when he picked up the candle to re-lit his cigar.\nMentally, Altamont thanked his partner.\n\n\"Well, sir,\" the Toon Leader changed the subject abruptly,\n\"enough of this talk about the past. If I understand rightly, it\nis the future in which you gentlemen are interested.\" He pushed\nback the cuff of his hunting shirt and looked at an old and worn\nwrist watch. \"Eleven hundred: we'll have lunch shortly.\n\n\"This afternoon, you will meet the other people of the Toon, and\nthis evening, at eighteen hundred, we'll have a mess together.\nThen, when we have everyone together, we can talk over your offer\nto help us, and decide what it is that you can give us that we\ncan use.\"\n\n\"You spoke, a while ago, of what you could do for us, in return,\"\nAltamont said. He knew that now he would have to be the one to\nstress their original mission: Loudons would probably be so\nfascinated by this society that the sociologist might never\nremember the primary reason for coming to Pittsburgh.\n\n\"There's one thing you can do, no further away than tomorrow, if\nyou're willing.\"\n\nHe had no time to wonder at the interchange of glances around the\ntable before the Toon Leader said, \"And that is--?\"\n\n\"In Pittsburgh, somewhere, there is an underground crypt, full of\nbooks. Not printed and bound books, but spools of microfilm. Do\nyou know what that is?\"\n\nThe men of the Toon shook their heads. Altamont continued:\n\n\"They are spools on which strips of films are wound and on which\npictures have been taken of books, page by page. We can make\nother, larger pictures from them, big enough to be read--\"\n\n\"Oh, photographs, which you can enlarge. I can understand that.\nYou mean, you can make many copies of them?\"\n\n\"That's right. And you shall have copies, as soon as we can take\nthe originals back to Fort Ridgeway, where we have the equipment\nfor enlarging them. But while we have information which will help\nus to find the crypt where the books are, we will need help in\ngetting it open.\"\n\n\"Of course! This is wonderful. Copies of The Books!\" the Reader\nexclaimed. \"We thought that we had the only one left in the\nworld!\"\n\n\"Not just The Books, Stamford, other books,\" the Toon Leader\ntold him. \"The books mentioned in The Books. But of course we\nwill help you. You have a map to show where they are?\"\n\n\"Not a map, just some information. But we can work out the\nlocation of the crypt.\"\n\n\"A ritual,\" Stamford Rawson said happily. \"Of course!\"\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nThey lunched together at the house of Toon Sarge Hughes with the\nToon Leader and the Reader and five or six of the leaders of the\ncommunity. The food was plentiful, but Altamont found himself\nwishing that the first book they found in the Carnegie Library\ncrypt would be a cook-book.\n\nIn the afternoon, he and Loudons separated.\n\nLoudons attached himself to the Tenant, the Reader and an old\nwoman, Irene Klein, who was almost a hundred years old and was\nthe repository and arbiter of most of the community's oral\nlegends.\n\nAltamont, on the other hand, started with Alex Barrett, the\ngunsmith, and Mordecai Ricci, the miller, to inspect the gunshop\nand the grist mill. They were later joined by a half dozen more\nof the village craftsmen and so also visited the forge and\nfoundry, the sawmill and the wagon shop. Altamont additionally\nlooked at the flume, a rough structure of logs lined with sheet\naluminum; and at the nitriary, a shed-roofed pit in which\npotassium nitrate was extracted from the community's animal\nrefuse.\n\nBut he reversed matters when it came to visiting the powder mill\non the island: he became the host and took them by helicopter to\nthe island and then for a trip up the river.\n\nThe guests were a badly-scared lot, for the first few minutes, as\nthey watched the ground receding under them through the\ntransparent plastic nose. Then, when nothing serious seemed to be\nhappening, exhilaration took the place of fear. By the time they\nset down on the tip of the island, the eight men were confirmed\naviation enthusiasts.\n\nThe trip up-river was an even bigger success, the high point\ncoming when Altamont set his controls for Hover, pointed out a\nsnarl of driftwood in the stream, and allowed his passengers to\nfire one of the machine-guns at it.\n\nThe lead balls of their own black-powder rifles would have\nplunked into the water-logged wood without visible effect. The\ncopper-jacketed machine-gun bullets ripped it to splinters.\n\nThey returned for a final visit to the distillery awed by what\nthey had seen.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\n\"Monty, I don't know what the devil to make of this crowd,\"\nLoudons said, that evening, after the feast, when they had\nentered the helicopter and were preparing to retire.\n\n\"We've run into some weird communities--that lot down in New\nMexico who live in the church and claim that they have a divine\nmission to redeem the world by prayer, fasting, and flagellation.\n\n\"Or those yogis in Los Angeles--\"\n\n\"Or the Blackout Boys in Detroit!\" Altamont interrupted. He had\ngood reason to remember them.\n\n\"That's understandable,\" Loudons said, \"after what their\nancestors went through in the last war. And so are the others, in\ntheir own way.\n\n\"But this crowd here!\" Loudons put down his cigar and began\nchewing on his mustache, a sure sign that he was more than\npuzzled: he was a very worried man.\n\nAltamont respected his partner's abilities in this area. However,\nhe also knew that the best way to get his friend to work any\nproblem was to have him do it in conversation.\n\n\"What has you stopped, Jim?\"\n\n\"Number of things, Monty. They're hard to explain because--\" the\nsociologist shrugged, winced a little as the gesture pushed his\nleg down on the edge of his bunk--\"well, let me just mention\nthem.\n\n\"These people are the descendants of an old United States Army\nplatoon, yet they have a fully-developed religion centered on a\nslain and resurrected god.\n\n\"Now, Monty, with all due respect to the old US Army, that just\ndoesn't make sense! Normally, it would take thousands of years for a\nslain-god religion to develop, and then only in a special situation,\nfrom the field-fertility magic of primitive agriculturists.\n\n\"Well, you saw those people's fields from the air. Some members\nof that old platoon were men who knew the latest methods of\nscientific farming. They didn't need naive fairy tales about the\nplanting and germination of seed.\"\n\n\"Sure this religion isn't just a variant of Christianity?\"\n\n\"Absolutely not!\n\n\"In the first place, these Sacred Books cannot be the Bible--you\nheard Tenant Jones say that they mentioned firearms that used\ncartridges. That means they can't be older than 1860 at the\nearliest.\n\n\"And, in the second place, this slain god wasn't crucified, or\nput to death by any form of execution: he perished, together with\nhis enemy, in combat, and both god and devil were later\nresurrected.\"\n\nLoudons picked up his cigar again. \"By the way, the Enemy is\nsupposed to be the master-mind back of these cannibal savages in\nthe woods and also in the ruins.\"\n\n\"Did you get a look at these Sacred Books, or find out what they\nmight be?\"\n\nLoudons shook his head disgustedly. \"Every time I brought up the\nquestion, they evaded me. The Tenant sent the Reader out to bring\nin this old lady, Irene Klein--she was a perfect gold-mine of\ninformation about the history and traditions of the platoon, by\nthe way--and then he sent the Reader out on some other errand,\nundoubtedly to pass the word around not to talk to us about their\nreligion.\"\n\n\"I don't get that,\" Altamont said. \"They showed me\neverything--their gunshop, their powder mill, their defenses,\neverything.\"\n\nHe smoked in silence for a moment, then added, in an apologetic\ntone, \"Jim, I'm sure you've thought of this: the slain god\ncouldn't be the original platoon commander, could he?\"\n\n\"I've thought of it, and he isn't, Monty.\n\n\"No, definitely not, though they have the greatest respect for\nhis memory--decorate his grave regularly, drink toasts to him,\nand so on. But he hasn't been deified. They got the idea for this\ngod of theirs out of the Sacred Books.\"\n\nLoudons put the cigar down again and returned to chewing his\nmustache. \"Monty, this has me worried like the devil:\n\n\"I believe that they suspect that you are the Slain and Risen\nOne!\"\n\nAltamont considered the idea, then nodded slowly. \"Could be, at\nthat. I know the Tenant came up to me, very respectfully, and\nsaid, 'I hope you don't think, sir, that I was presumptuous in\ntrying to display my humble deductive abilities to you.'\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" Loudons demanded rather sharply.\n\n\"Told him certainly not, that he'd used a good, quick method of\ndemonstrating that he and his people weren't like those mindless\nsubhumans in the woods.\"\n\n\"That was all right,\" Loudons approved, but then his worries\nreturned. \"I don't know how we're going to handle this--\"\n\n\"Jim, how about that pows business? Is there something there?\"\n\n\"Monty!\" Loudons voice was drily chiding as he took a pad of\npaper and scribbled briefly. \"Take a look and figure for\nyourself.\"\n\nAltamont looked at the paper. Loudons had simply printed the\nfirst three letters of the word in capitals and separated each\nletter with a period. \"Ouch! Yes, of course, that's what an\ninfantry platoon would be guarding.\n\n\"Go ahead, Jim, this is your end of our business. I'll stay out\nof it and, especially, I'll keep my mouth shut.\"\n\n\"I don't think you'll be able to,\" Loudons said soberly. \"As\nthings stand now, they only suspect that you are their deity.\n\n\"And that means this: we're on trial here!\"\n\n\"We have been in spots like this before, Jim,\" Altamont reminded\nhis friend.\n\n\"Not like this, Monty, and let me explain.\n\n\"I get the impression here that logic, not faith, is the supreme\nreligious virtue. And get this, Monty, because it's something\npractically unheard of: skepticism is a religious obligation, not\na sin!\n\n\"I wish I knew....\"\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nTenant Mycroft Jones, Reader Stamford Rawson, Toon Sarge Verner\nHughes, and his son, Murray Hughes, sat around the bare-topped\ntable in the room on the second floor of the Aitch-Cue House. A\nlighted candle flickered in the cool breeze that came in through\nthe open window, throwing their shadows back and forth on the\nwalls.\n\n\"Pass the tantalus, Murray,\" the Tenant said, and the youngest of\nthe four handed the corncob-corked bottle to the eldest. Tenant\nJones filled his cup and then sat staring at it, while Verner\nHughes thrust his pipe into the toe of the moccasin and filled\nit. Finally, the Tenant drank about half the clear, wild-plum\nbrandy.\n\n\"Gentlemen, I am baffled,\" he confessed. \"We have three alternate\npossibilities here and we dare not disregard any of them.\n\n\"Either this man who calls himself Altamont is truly He, or his\nis merely what we are asked to believe, one of a community of men\nlike ours, with more of the old knowledge than we possess.\"\n\n\"You know my views,\" Verner Hughes said. \"I cannot believe that\nHe was more than a man, as we are. A great, a good, a wise man,\nbut a man and mortal.\"\n\n\"Let's not go into that, now.\" The Reader emptied his cup and\ntook the bottle, filling it again. \"You know my views, too. I\nhold that He is no longer upon earth in the flesh, but lives in\nthe spirit and is only with us in the spirit.\n\n\"But you said there were three possibilities, none of which can\nbe eliminated. What was your third possibility, Tenant?\"\n\n\"That they are creatures of the Enemy, perhaps that one or the\nother of them is the Enemy.\"\n\nReader Rawson, lifting his cup to his lips, almost strangled. The\nHugheses, father and son stared at Tenant Jones in horror.\n\n\"The Enemy--with such weapons and resources!\" Murray Hughes\ngasped. Then he emptied his cup and refilled it. \"No! I can't\nbelieve that: he would have struck before this and wiped us all\nout!\"\n\n\"Not necessarily, Murray,\" the Tenant replied. \"Until he became\nconvinced that his agents, the Scowrers, could do nothing\nagainst us, he would bide his time. He sits motionless, like a\nspider, at the center of the web; he does little himself; his\nagents are numerous.\n\n\"Or, perhaps, he wishes to recruit us into this hellish\norganization.\"\n\n\"It is a possibility,\" the Reader admitted, \"and one which we can\nneither accept or reject safely. And we must learn the truth as\nsoon as possible. If this man is really He, we must not spurn Him\non mere suspicion. If he is a man, come to help us, we must\naccept his help; if he is speaking the truth, the people who sent\nhim could do wonders for us, and the greatest wonder would be to\nmake us again a part of a civilized community.\n\n\"And if he is the Enemy....\" Rawson left the sentence unfinished,\nbut his face was grim.\n\n\"But if he is really He,\" Murray said, a little diffidently, for\nhe was not yet accustomed to being included in the council of the\nelders, \"I think we are on trial.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, son? Oh, I see. Of course, I don't believe\nthat he is, but that's mere doubt, not negative certainty.\nHowever, if I'm wrong, if this man is truly He, we are worthy of\nhim, we will penetrate his disguise.\"\n\n\"A very pretty problem, gentlemen,\" the Tenant said, smacking his\nlips over his brandy, \"for all that it may be a deadly serious\none for us. There is, of course, nothing we can do tonight. But,\ntomorrow, we have promised to help our visitors, whoever they may\nbe, in searching for this crypt in the city.\n\n\"Murray, you were to be in charge of the detail that was to\naccompany them. Carry on as arranged, and say nothing of our\nsuspicions, but advise your men to keep a sharp watch on the\nstrangers, that they may learn all they can from them.\n\n\"Stamford, you and Verner and I will go along. We should, if we\nhave any wits at all, observe something.\"\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\n\"Listen to this infernal thing!\" Altamont raged. \"'Wielding a\ngold-plated spade handled with oak from an original rafter of the\nCongressional Library, at three-fifteen one afternoon last\nweek--' One afternoon last week!\" He cursed luridly. \"Why\ncouldn't that blasted magazine say what afternoon? I've gone over\na lot of twentieth century copies of that magazine and that\nexpression was a regular cliche with them.\"\n\nLoudons looked over his shoulder at the photostated magazine\npage.\n\n\"Well, we know it was between June thirteen and nineteen,\ninclusive,\" he said. \"And there's a picture of the university\npresident, complete with gold-plated spade, breaking ground. Call\nit Wednesday, the sixteenth. Over there's the tip of the shadow\nof the old Cathedral of Learning, about a hundred yards away.\nThere are so many inexactitudes, that one'll probably cancel out\nthe other.\"\n\n\"That's so, and it's also pretty futile getting angry at somebody\nwho's been dead two hundred years, but why couldn't they say\nWednesday, or Monday, or Saturday, or whatever?\"\n\nMonty checked back in the astronomical handbook, and the\nphotostated pages of the old almanac, then looked over his\ncalculations. \"All right, here is the angle of the shadow, and\nthe compass-bearing.\n\n\"I had a look, yesterday, when I was taking the local citizenry\non that junket. The old baseball diamond at Forbes Field is\nplainly visible, and I located the ruins of the Cathedral of\nLearning from that.\n\n\"Here's the above-sea-level altitude of the top of the tower.\nAfter you've landed us, go up to this altitude--use the\nbarometric altimeter, not the radar--and hold position.\"\n\nLoudons leaned forward from the desk to the contraption Altamont\nhad rigged up in the nose of the helicopter; one of the\ntelescope-sighted hunting rifles clamped in a vise, with a\ncompass and a spirit-level under it.\n\n\"Rifle's pointing downward at the correct angle now?\" he asked.\n\"Good. Then all I have to do is to hold the helicopter steady,\nkeep it at the right altitude, level and pointed in the right\ndirection, and watch through the sight while you move the flag\naround, and direct you by radio.\"\n\n\"Simple, if I had been born quintuplets!\"\n\n\"Mr. Altamont! Doctor Loudons!\" a voice outside the helicopter\ncalled. \"Are you ready for us now?\"\n\nAltamont went to the open door and looked out. The old Toon\nLeader, the Reader, Toon Sarge Hughes, his son and four young men\nin buckskins with slung rifles were standing outside.\n\n\"I have decided,\" the Tenant said, \"that Mr. Rawson and Sarge\nHughes and I would be of more help than an equal number of young\nmen. We may not be as active, but we do know the old ruins\nbetter, especially the paths and hiding places of the Scowrers.\nThese four young men you probably met last evening, but it will\ndo no harm to introduce them again.\n\n\"Birdy Edwards; Sholto Jiminez; Jefferson Burns; Murdo Olsen.\"\n\n\"Very pleased, Tenant, gentlemen. I met all of you young men last\nevening and I remember you,\" Altamont said. \"Now, if you'll crowd\nin here, I'll explain what we're going to try to do.\"\n\nHe showed them the old picture. \"You see where the shadow of a\ntall building falls?\" he asked. \"We know the height and location\nof this building. Doctor Loudons will hold this helicopter at\nexactly the position of the top of the building and aim through\nthe sights of the rifle, there. One of you will have this flag in\nhis hand, and will move it back and forth. Doctor Loudons will\ntell us when the flag is in sight of the rifle.\"\n\n\"He'll need a good pair of lungs to do that,\" Verner Hughes\ncommented.\n\n\"We'll use the radio. A portable set on the ground, and the\nhelicopter's radio set,\" Altamont said.\n\nTo his surprise, he was met with looks of incomprehension. He had\nnot supposed that these people would have lost all memory of\nradio communication.\n\n\"Why, that's wonderful!\" the Reader exclaimed, when the\nexplanation was concluded. \"You can talk directly. How much\nbetter than just sending a telegram!\"\n\n\"But, finding the crypt by the shadow, that's exactly like the--\"\nMurray Hughes began, then stopped short. Immediately, he began\ntalking about the rifle that was to be used as a surveying\ntransit, comparing it with the ones in the big first-floor room\nat the Aitch-Cue House.\n\nLocating the point where the shadow of the old Cathedral of\nLearning had fallen proved easier than either Altamont or Loudons\nhad expected. The towering building was now a tumbled mass of\nslagged rubble, but it was quite possible to determine its\noriginal center, and with the old data from the excellent\nreference library at Fort Ridgeway, its height above sea level\nwas known. After a little jockeying, the helicopter came to a\nhovering stop, and the slanting barrel of the rifle in the vise\npointed downward along the line of the shadow that had been cast\non that afternoon in June, 1993.\n\nThe cross-hairs of the scope sight centered almost exactly on the\nspot Altamont had estimated on the map.\n\nGuiding himself by peering through the rifle-sight, Loudons\nbrought the helicopter slanting down to land on the sheet of\nfused glass that had once been a grassy campus.\n\n\"Well, this is probably it,\" Altamont said. \"We didn't have to\nbother fussing around with that flag after all. That hump over\nthere looks as though it had been a small building, and there's\nnothing corresponding to it on the city map. That may be the\nbunker over the stair-head to the crypt.\"\n\nThey began unloading equipment--a small, portable\nnuclear-electric conversion unit, a powerful solenoid-hammer,\ncrowbars and intrenching tools, tins of blasting plastic. They\ntook out the two hunting rifles and the auto-carbines, and\nAltamont showed the young men of Murray Hughes' detail how to use\nthem.\n\n\"If you will pardon me, sir,\" the Tenant said to Altamont, \"I\nthink it would be a good idea if your companion went up in the\nflying machine and circled over us, to keep watch for the\nScowrers. There are quite a few of them, particularly farther up\nthe rivers, to the east, where the damage was not so great and\nthey can find cellars and shelters and buildings to live in.\"\n\n\"Good idea. That way, we won't have to put out guards,\" Altamont\nsaid. \"From the looks of this, we'll need every body to help dig\ninto that thing. Hand out one of the portable radios, Jim and go\nup to about a thousand feet. If you see anything suspicious, give\nus a yell, then spray it with bullets, and find out what it is\nafterward.\"\n\nThey waited until the helicopter had climbed to position and was\ncircling above, and then turned their attention to the place\nwhere the sheet of fused earth and stone bulged upward. It must\nhave been almost ground-zero of one of the hydrogen-bombs: the\nwreckage of the Cathedral of Learning had fallen predominantly to\nthe north, and the Carnegie Library was tumbled to the east.\n\n\"I think the entrance would be on this side, toward the Library,\"\nAltamont said. \"Let's try it, to begin with.\"\n\nHe used the solenoid-hammer, slowly pounding a hole in the glaze,\nand placed a small charge of the plastic explosive. Chunks of the\nlava-like stuff pelted down between the little mound and the huge\none of the old library, blowing a hole six feet in diameter and\nthe two and a half feet deep, revealing concrete bonded with\ncrushed steel-mill slag.\n\n\"We missed the door,\" Altamont said. \"That means we'll have to\ntunnel in through who knows how much concrete. Well....\"\n\nHe used a second and larger charge, after digging a hole a foot\ndeep. When he and his helpers came up to look, they found a large\nmass of concrete blown out, and solid steel behind it. Altamont\ncut two more holes, one on either side of the blown-out place,\nand fired a charge in each of them, bringing down more concrete.\n\nHe found he hadn't missed the door after all. It had merely been\nconcreted over.\n\nA few more shots cleared it, and after some work, they got it\nopen. There was a room inside, concrete-floored and entirely\nempty. Altamont stood in the doorway and inspected the interior\nwith his flashlight; he heard somebody behind him say something\nabout a most peculiar sort of dark-lantern.\n\nAcross the small room, on the opposite wall, was a bronze plaque.\n\nThe plaque carried quite a lengthy inscription, including the\nnames of all the persons and institutions participating in the\nmicrofilm project. The History Department at the Fort would be\ninterested in that, but the only thing that interested Altamont\nwas the statement that the floor had been laid over the trapdoor\nleading to the vault where the microfilms were stored. He went\noutside to the radio.\n\n\"Hello, Jim. We're inside, but the films were stored in an\nunderground vault, and so we have to tear up a concrete floor,\"\nhe said. \"Go back to the village and gather up all the men you\ncan carry. I don't want to use explosives inside. The interior of\nthe crypt oughtn't to be damaged. Besides, I don't know what a\nblast in there might do to the film, and I don't want to take any\nchances.\"\n\n\"No, of course not. How thick do you think the floor is?\"\n\n\"Haven't the least idea. Plenty thick, I would guess. Those films\nwould have to be well-buried, to shield them from radioactivity.\nWe can expect that it will take some time.\"\n\n\"All right. I'll be back as soon as I can.\"\n\nThe helicopter turned and went windmilling away, over what had\nbeen the Golden Triangle, down the Ohio. Altamont went back to\nthe little concrete bunker and sat down, lighting his pipe.\nMurray Hughes and his four riflemen spread out, one circling\naround the glazed butte that had been the Cathedral of Learning,\nanother climbing to the top of the old Library, and the others\ntaking positions to the south and east.\n\nAltamont sat in silence, smoking his pipe and trying to form some\nconception of the wealth under that concrete floor.\n\nIt was no use.\n\nJim Loudons probably understood a little more clearly what those\nbooks would mean to the world of today, and what they could do\ntoward shaping the world of the future.\n\nThere was a library at Fort Ridgeway, and it was an excellent one ...\nfor its purpose. In 1996, when the rockets had come crashing\ndown, it had contained the cream of the world's technical\nknowledge--and very little else. There was only a little fiction,\na few books of ideas, just enough to give the survivors a\ntantalizing glimpse of the world of their fathers.\n\nBut now....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA rifle banged to the south and east, and banged again. Either\nMurray Hughes or Birdy Edwards: it was one of the two hunting\nrifles from the helicopter.\n\nOn the heels of the reports, they heard a voice shouting,\n\"Scowrers! A lot of them, coming from up the river!\"\n\nA moment later, there was a light whip-crack of one of the\nmuzzleloaders, from the top of the old Carnegie Library, and\nAltamont could see a wisp of grey-white smoke drifting away from\nwhere it had been fired.\n\nAltamont jumped to his feet and raced for the radio, picking it\nup and bring it to the bunker.\n\nTenant Jones, old Reader Rawson, and Verner Hughes had caught up\ntheir rifles. The Tenant was shouting. \"Come on in! Everybody,\ncome on in!\"\n\nThe boy on top of the library began scrambling down. Another came\nrunning from the direction of the half-demolished Cathedral of\nLearning, a third from the baseball field that had served as\nAltamont's point of reference the afternoon before.\n\nThe fourth, Murray Hughes, was running in from the ruins of the\nold Carnegie Tech buildings, and Birdy Edwards sped up the main\nroad from Schenley Park. Once, twice, as he ran, Murray Hughes\npaused, turned, and fired behind him.\n\nThen his pursuers came into sight!\n\nThey ran erect, they wore a few rags of skin garments, and they\ncarried spears and hatchets and clubs, so they were probably\nclassifiable as men. But their hair was long and unkempt, and\ntheir bodies were almost black with dirt and from the sun. A few\nof them were yelling, but most of them ran silently. They ran\nmore swiftly than the boy they were pursuing: the distance\nbetween them narrowed every moment. There were at least fifty of\nthem.\n\nVerner Hughes' rifle barked, one of them dropped. As cooly as\nthough he were shooting squirrels instead of his son's pursuers,\nhe dropped the butt of the rifle to the ground, poured a charge\nof powder, patched a ball and rammed it home, replaced the\nramrod. Tenant Jones fired then, and Birdy Edwards joined them,\nbeginning to shoot with the telescope-sighted rifle.\n\nThe young man who had been north of the Cathedral of Learning had\none of the auto-carbines; luckily, Altamont had providently set\nthe control for semi-auto before giving it to him. He dropped to\none knee and began to empty the clip, shooting slowly and\ndeliberately, picking off the runners who were in the lead.\n\nThe boy who had started to climb down off the Library halted,\nfired his flintlock, and began reloading it.\n\nAltamont, sitting down and propping his elbows on his knees, took\nboth hands to the automatic which was his only weapon, emptying\nthe magazine and replacing it. The last three savages he shot in\nthe back: they had had enough and were running for their lives.\n\nSo far, everybody was safe. The boy in the Library came down\nthrough a place where the wall had fallen. Murray Hughes stopped\nrunning and came slowly toward the bunker, putting a fresh clip\ninto his rifle. The others came drifting in.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Altamont, calling Loudons,\" the scientist from Fort Ridgeway was\nsaying into the radio. \"Monty to Jim: can you hear me?\"\n\nSilence.\n\n\"We'd better get ready for another attack,\" Birdy Edwards said.\n\"There's another gang coming from down that way. I never saw so\nmany Scowrers!\"\n\n\"Maybe there's a reason, Birdy,\" Tenant Jones said. \"The Enemy is\nafter big game, this time.\"\n\n\"Jim, where the devil are you?\" Altamont fairly yelled into the\nradio; and as he did, he knew the answer. Loudons was in the\nvillage, away from the helicopter, gathering tools and workers.\n\nNothing to do but keep on trying!\n\n\"Here they come!\" Reader Rawson warned.\n\n\"How far can these rifles be depended on?\" Birdy Edwards wanted\nto know.\n\nAltamont straightened, saw the second band of savages approaching\nabout four hundred yards away.\n\n\"Start shooting now,\" he said. \"Aim for the upper part of their\nbodies.\"\n\nThe two auto-loading rifles began to crack. After the first few\nshots, the savages took cover. Evidently they understood the\ncapabilities and limitations of the villagers' flintlocks, but\nthis was a terrifying surprise to them.\n\n\"Jim!\"--Altamont was almost praying into the radio--\"Come in,\nJim!\"\n\n\"What is it, Monty? I was outside.\"\n\nAltamont told him.\n\n\"Those fellows you had up with you yesterday, think they could\nbe trusted to handle the guns? A couple of them are here with\nme,\" Loudons inquired.\n\n\"Take a chance on it! It won't cost anything but my life, and\nthat's not worth much at the present.\"\n\n\"All right, hold on. We'll be there in a few minutes.\"\n\n\"Loudons is bringing the helicopter,\" Altamont told the others.\n\"All we have to do is to hold on, here, until he comes.\"\n\nA naked savage raised his head from behind what might, two\nhundred years ago, have been a cement park-bench and he was only\na hundred yards away. Reader Rawson promptly killed him and began\nreloading.\n\n\"I think you're right, Tenant,\" he said. \"The Scowrers have never\nattacked in bands like this before. They must have a powerful\nreason and I can think of only one.\"\n\n\"That's what I'm beginning to think, too,\" Verner Hughes agreed.\n\"At least, we've eliminated the third of your possibilities,\nTenant. And I think probably the second, as well.\"\n\nAltamont wondered what they were double-talking about. There\nwasn't any particular mystery about the mass attack of the wild\nmen to him.\n\nDebased as they were, they still possessed speech and the ability\nto transmit experiences. No matter how beclouded in superstition,\nthey still remembered that aircraft dropped bombs, and bombs\nkilled people, and where people had been killed, they would find\nfresh meat. They had seen the helicopter circling about, and had\nheard the blasting: everyone in the area had been drawn to the\nscene as soon as Loudons had gone down the river.\n\nBut they seemed to have forgotten that aircraft carried guns,\nalthough they did spring to their feet and start to run at the\nreturn of the helicopter.\n\nHowever, most of them did not run far.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\nAltamont and Loudons shook hands many times in front of the\nAitch-Cue House, and listened to many good wishes, and repeated\ntheir promise to return. Most of the microfilmed books were to be\nstored in the old church. They were taking with them only the\ncatalogue and a few of the most important works. Finally, they\nentered the helicopter. The crowd shouted farewell as they rose.\n\nAltamont, at the controls, waited until they had gained five\nthousand feet, then turned on a compass-course for Colony Three.\n\n\"I can't wait until we're in radio range of the Fort, Jim. This\nis one report that I really want to make,\" he said.\n\n\"Of all the wonderful luck!\" he went on. \"And I don't know which\nis the more important: finding those books, or finding those\npeople. In a few years, when we can get them supplied with modern\nequipment and instructed in its use--\n\n\"What's the matter, Jim? You should be even more excited than I\nam.\"\n\n\"I'm not very happy about this, Monty,\" Loudons confessed. \"I\nkeep thinking about what's going to happen to them.\"\n\n\"Why, nothing's going to happen to them. They're going to be\ngiven the means of producing more food, keeping more of them\nalive, giving them more leisure to develop themselves in--\"\n\n\"Monty, I saw the Sacred Books.\"\n\n\"The deuce! What were they?\"\n\n\"It. One volume. A collection of works. We have it at the Fort\nand I've read it. How I ever missed all those clues--\"\n\n\"You see, Monty, what I'm worried about is what's going to happen\nto those people when they find out that we're not really Sherlock\nHolmes and Doctor Watson....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Return, by H.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n*** END: FULL LICENSE ***\n"}
