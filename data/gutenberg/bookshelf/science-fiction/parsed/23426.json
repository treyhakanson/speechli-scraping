He saluted. The skeletal figure in endless\nblack nodded gravely, and took hold of Sam Collins' arm with a death\ngrip.\n\n\"I'm going to bury you, Sam Collins,\" the undertaker said.\n\nThe tall false fronts of Main Street spilled out a lake of shadow, a\ncanal of liquid heat that soaked through the iron weave of Collins'\njeans and turned into black ink stains. The old window of the hardware\nstore showed its age in soft wrinkles, ripples that had caught on fire\nin the sunset. Collins felt the twilight stealing under the arms of his\ntee-shirt. The overdue hair on the back of his rangy neck stood up in\nattention. It was a joke, but the first one Collins had ever known Doc\nCandle to make.\n\n\"In time, I guess you'll bury me all right, Doc.\"\n\n\"In my time, not yours, Earthling.\"\n\n\"Earthling?\" Collins repeated the last word.\n\nThe old man frowned. His face was a collection of lines. When he\nfrowned, all the lines pointed to hell, the grave, decay and damnation.\n\n\"Earthling,\" the undertaker repeated. \"Earthman? Terrestrial? Solarian?\nSpace Ranger? _Homo sapiens?_\"\n\nCollins decided Candle was sure in a jokey mood. \"Kind of makes you\nthink of it, don't it, Doc? The spaceport going right up outside of\ntown. Rocketships are going to be out there taking off for the\nSatellite, the Moon, places like that. Reminds you that we _are_\nEarthlings, like they say in the funnies, all right.\"\n\n\"Not outside town.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Inside. Inside town. Part of the spaceship administration building is\ngoing to go smack in the middle of where your house used to be.\"\n\n\"My house _is_.\"\n\n\"For less time than you will be yourself, Earthling.\"\n\n\"Earthling yourself! What's wrong with you, Doc?\"\n\n\"No. I am not an Earthling. I am a superhuman alien from outer space. My\nmission on Earth is to destroy you.\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nCollins pulled away gently. When you lived in a town all your life and\nknew its people, it wasn't unusual to see some old person snap under the\nweight of years.\n\n\"You have to destroy the rocketship station, huh, Doc, before it sends\nup spaceships?\"\n\n\"No. I want to kill _you_. That is my mission.\"\n\n\"_Why?_\"\n\n\"Because,\" Candle said, \"I am a basically evil entity.\"\n\nThe undertaker turned away and went skittering down Main Street, his\nlopsided gait limping, sliding, hopping, skipping, at a refined\nleisurely pace. He was a collection of dancing, straight black lines.\n\nCollins stared after the old man, shook his head and forgot about him.\n\nHe moved into the hardware store. The bell tinkled behind him. The store\nwas cramped with shadows and the smell of wood and iron. It was lined\noff as precisely as a checkerboard, with counters, drawers,\ncompartments.\n\nEd Michaels sat behind the counter, smoking a pipe. He was a handsome\nman, looking young in the uncertain light, even at fifty.\n\n\"Hi, Ed. You closed?\"\n\n\"Guess not, Sam. What are you looking for?\"\n\n\"A pound of tenpenny nails.\"\n\nMichaels stood up.\n\nSarah Comstock waddled energetically out of the back. Her sweet, angelic\nface lit up with a smile. \"Sam Collins. Well, I guess _you'll_ want to\nhelp us murder them.\"\n\n\"Murder?\" Collins repeated. \"Who?\"\n\n\"Those Air Force men who want to come in here and cause all the\ntrouble.\"\n\n\"How are you going to murder them, Mrs. Comstock?\"\n\n\"When they see our petition in Washington, D.C., they'll call those men\nback pretty quick.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Collins said.\n\nMrs. Comstock produced the scroll from her voluminous handbag. \"You want\nto sign, don't you? They're going to put part of the airport on your\nplace. They'll tear down your house.\"\n\n\"They can't tear it down. I won't sell.\"\n\n\"You know government men. They'll just _take_ it and give you some money\nfor it. Sign right there at the top of the new column, Sam.\"\n\nCollins shook his head. \"I don't believe in signing things. They can't\ntake what's mine.\"\n\n\"But Sam, dear, they _will_. They'll come in and push your house down\nwith those big tractors of theirs. They'll bury it in concrete and set\noff those guided missiles of theirs right over it.\"\n\n\"They can't make me get out,\" Sam said.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nEd Michaels scooped up a pound, one ounce of nails and spilled them onto\nhis scale. He pinched off the excess, then dropped it back in and fed\nthe nails into a brown paper bag. He crumpled the top and set it on the\ncounter. \"That's twenty-nine plus one, Sam. Thirty cents.\"\n\nCollins laid out a quarter and a nickel and picked up the bag.\n\"Appreciate you doing this after store hours, Ed.\"\n\nMichaels chuckled. \"I wasn't exactly getting ready for the opera, Sam.\"\n\nCollins turned around and saw Sarah Comstock still waiting, the petition\nin her hand.\n\n\"Now what's a pretty girl like you doing, wasting her time in politics?\"\nCollins heard himself ask.\n\nMrs. Comstock twittered. \"I'm old enough to be your mother, Sam\nCollins.\"\n\n\"I like mature women.\"\n\nCollins watched his hand in fascination as it reached out to touch one\nof Sarah Comstock's plump cheeks, then dropped to her shoulder and\nripped away the strap-sleeve of her summer print dress.\n\nA plump, rosy shoulder was revealed, splattered with freckles.\n\nSarah Comstock put her hands over her ears as if to keep from hearing\nher own shrill scream. It reached out into pure soprano range.\n\nSarah Comstock backed away, into the shadows, and Sam Collins followed\nher, trying to explain, to apologize.\n\n\"Sam! _Sam!_\"\n\nThe voice cut through to him and he looked up.\n\nEd Michaels had a double-barreled shotgun aimed at him. Mrs. Michaels'\nface was looking over his shoulder in the door to the back, her face a\nsick white.\n\n\"You get out of here, Sam,\" Michaels said. \"You get out and don't you\ncome back. Ever.\"\n\nCollins' hands moved emptily in air. He was always better with his hands\nthan words, but this time even they seemed inexpressive.\n\nHe crumpled the sack of nails in both fists, and turned and left the\nhardware store.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nHis house was still there, sitting at the end of Elm Street, at the end\nof town, on the edge of the prairie. It was a very old house. It was\ndecorated with gingerboard, a rusted-out tin rooster-comb running the\npeak of the roof and stained glass window transoms; and the top of the\nhouse was joined to the ground floor by lapped fishscales, as though it\nwas a mermaid instead of a house. The house was a golden house. It had\nbeen painted brown against the dust, but the keening wind, the\nrelentless sun, the savage rape of the thunderstorms, they had all\nbleached the brown paint into a shining pure gold.\n\nSam stepped inside and leaned back against the front door, the door of\nfull-length glass with a border of glass emeralds and rubies. He leaned\nback and breathed deep.\n\nThe house didn't smell old. It smelled new. It smelled like sawdust and\nfresh-hewn lumber as bright and blond as a high school senior's\ncrewcut.\n\nHe walked across the flowered carpet. The carpet didn't mind footsteps\nor bright sun. It never became worn or faded. It grew brighter with the\nyears, the roses turning redder, the sunflowers becoming yellower.\n\nThe parlor looked the same as it always did, clean and waiting to be\nused. The cane-backed sofa and chairs eagerly waiting to be sat upon,\nthe bead-shaded kerosene lamps ready to burst into light.\n\nSam went into his workshop. This had once been the ground level master\nbedroom, but he had had to make the change. The work table held its\nshare of radios, toasters, TV sets, an electric train, a spring-wind\nVictrola. Sam threw the nails onto the table and crossed the room,\nrunning his fingers along the silent keyboard of the player piano. He\nlooked out the window. The bulldozers had made the ground rectangular,\nlevel and brown, turning it into a gigantic half-cent stamp. He\nremembered the mail and raised the window and reached down into the\nmailbox. It was on this side of the house, because only this side was\ntechnically within city limits.\n\nAs he came up with the letters, Sam Collins saw a man sighting along a\nplumbline towards his house. He shut the window.\n\nSome of the letters didn't have any postage stamps, just a line of\nsmall print about a $300 fine. Government letters. He went over and\nforced them into the tightly packed coal stove. All the trash would be\nburned out in the cold weather.\n\nCollins sat down and looked through the rest of his mail. A new\ncatalogue of electronic parts. A bulky envelope with two paperback\nnovels by Richard S. Prather and Robert Bloch he had ordered. A couple\nof letters from hams. He tossed the mail on the table and leaned back.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe thought about what had happened in the hardware store.\n\nIt wasn't surprising it had happened to him. Things like that were bound\nto happen to him. He had just been lucky that Ed Michaels hadn't called\nthe sheriff. What had got into him? He had never been a sex maniac\nbefore! But still ... it was hardly unexpected.\n\nMight as well wait to start on those rabbit cages until tomorrow, he\ndecided. This evening he felt like exploring.\n\nThe house was so big, and packed with so many things that he never found\nand examined them all. Or if he did, he forgot a lot about the things\nbetween times, so it was like reading a favorite book over again, always\ndiscovering new things in it.\n\nThe parlor was red in the fading light, and the hall beyond the sliding\ndoors was deeply shadowed. In the sewing room, he remembered, in the\ndrawers of the treadle machine the radio was captured. The rings and\nsecret manuals of the days when radio had been alive. He hadn't looked\nover those things in some little time.\n\nHe looked up the shadowed stairway. He remembered the night, a few weeks\nbefore Christmas when he had been twelve and really too old to believe,\nhis mother had said she was going up to see if Santa Claus had left any\npackages around a bit early. They often gave him his presents early,\nsince they were never quite sure he would live until Christmas.\n\nBut his mother had been playing a trick on him. She hadn't been going up\nafter packages. She had gone up those stairs to murder his father.\n\nShe had shot him in the back of the head with his Army Colt .45 from the\nfirst war. Collins never quite understood why the hole in back was so\nneat and the one in front where it came out was so messy.\n\nAfter he went to live with Aunt Amy and the house had been boarded up,\nhe heard them talking, Aunt Amy and her boy friend, fat Uncle Ralph. And\nthey had said his mother had murdered his father because he had gone\nahead and made her get pregnant again and she was afraid it would be\nanother one like Sam.\n\nSam Collins knew she must have planned it a long time in advance. She\nhad filled up the bathtub with milk, real milk, and she went in after\nshe had done it and took a bath in the milk. Then she slit her wrists.\n\nWhen Sam Collins had run down the stairs, screaming, and barged into the\nbathroom, he had found the tub looking like a giant stick of peppermint\ncandy.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nAunt Amy had been good to him.\n\nBecause he didn't talk for about a year after he found the bodies, most\npeople thought he was simple-minded. But Aunt Amy had always treated him\njust like a regular boy. That was embarrassing sometimes, but still it\nwas better than what he got from the others.\n\nThe doctor hadn't wanted to perform the operation on his clubfoot. He\nsaid it would be an unproductive waste of his time and talent, that he\nowed it to the world to use them to the very best advantage. Finally he\nagreed. The operation took about thirty seconds. He stuck a knife into\nSam's foot and went _snick-snick_. A couple of weeks later, his foot was\nhealed and it was just like anybody else's. Aunt Amy had paid him $500\nin payments, only he returned the money order for the last fifty\ndollars and wished them Merry Christmas.\n\nSam Collins could work after that. When Aunty Amy and Uncle Ralph\ndisappeared, he opened up the old house and started doing odd jobs for\npeople who weren't very afraid of him any more.\n\nThat first day had been quite a shock, when he discovered that not in\nall these years had anybody cleaned the bathtub.\n\nSometimes, when he was taking his Saturday night soaker he still got\nkind of a funny feeling. But he knew it was only rust from the faucets.\n\nCollins sighed. It seemed like a long time since he had seen his mother\ncoming down those stairs....\n\nHe stopped, his throat aching with tightness.\n\nSomething was very strange.\n\nHis mother was coming down the stairs right now.\n\nShe was walking down the stairs, one step, two steps, coming closer to\nhim.\n\nCollins ran up the stairs, prepared to run through the phantom to prove\nit wasn't there.\n\nThe figure raised a gun and pointed it at him.\n\nThis time, she was going to shoot _him_.\n\nIt figured.\n\nHe always had bad luck.\n\n\"Stop!\" the woman on the stairs said. \"Stop or I'll shoot, Mr.\nCollins!\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nCollins stopped, catching to the bannister. He squinted hard, and as a\nstereoptic slide lost its depth when you shut one eye, the woman on the\nstairs was no longer his mother. She was young, pretty, brunette and\nsweet-faced, and the gun she held shrunk from an old Army Colt to a .22\ntarget pistol.\n\n\"Who _are_ you?\" Collins demanded.\n\nThe girl took a grip on the gun with both hands and held it steady on\nhim.\n\n\"I'm Nancy Comstock,\" she said. \"You tried to assault my mother a half\nhour ago.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" he said. \"I've never seen you before.\"\n\n\"Yes, you have. I've been away to school a lot, but you've seen me\naround. I've had my eye on you. I know about men like you. I know what\nhas to be done. I came looking for you in your house for this.\"\n\nThe bore of the gun was level with his eye as he stood a few steps below\nher. Probably if she fired now, she would kill him. Or more likely he\nwould only be blinded or paralyzed; that was about his luck.\n\n\"Are you going to use that gun?\" he asked.\n\n\"Not unless I have to. I only brought it along for protection. I came\nto help you, Mr. Collins.\"\n\n\"Help me?\"\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Collins. You're sick. You need help.\"\n\nHe looked the girl over. She was a half-dozen years younger than he was.\nIn most states, she couldn't even vote yet. But still, maybe she could\nhelp, at that. He didn't know much about girls and their abilities.\n\n\"Why don't we go into the kitchen and have some coffee?\" Collins\nsuggested.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nNancy sipped her coffee and kept her eyes on his. The gun lay in her\nlap. The big kitchen was a place for coffee, brown and black, wood\nceiling and iron stove and pans. Collins sat across the twelve square\nfeet of table from her, and nursed the smoking mug.\n\n\"Sam, I want you to take whatever comfort you can from the fact that I\ndon't think the same thing about you as the rest of Waraxe.\"\n\n\"What does the rest of the town think about me?\"\n\n\"They think you are a pathological degenerate who should be lynched. But\nI don't believe that.\"\n\n\"Thanks. That's a big comfort.\"\n\n\"I know what you were after when you tore Mom's dress.\"\n\nIn spite of himself, Collins felt his face warming in a blush.\n\n\"You were only seeking the mother love you missed as a boy,\" the girl\nsaid.\n\nCollins chewed on his lip a moment, and considered the idea. Slowly he\nshook his head.\n\n\"No,\" he said. \"No. I don't think so.\"\n\n\"Then what do you think?\"\n\n\"I think old Doc Candle _made_ me do it. He said he was going to bury\nme. Getting me lynched would be one good way to do it. Ed Michaels\nalmost blew my head off with his shotgun. It was close. Doc Candle\nalmost made it. He didn't miss by far with you and that target pistol\neither.\"\n\n\"Sam--I may call you 'Sam'?--just try to think calmly and reasonably for\na minute. How could Dr. Candle, the undertaker, possibly make you do a\nthing like you did in Mr. Michaels' hardware store?\"\n\n\"Well ... he _said_ he was a superhuman alien from outer space.\"\n\n\"If he said that, do you believe him, Sam?\"\n\n\"_Something_ made me do that. It just wasn't my own idea.\"\n\n\"It's easier that way, isn't it, Sam?\" Nancy asked. \"It's easy to say.\n'It wasn't me; some space monster made me do it.' But you really know\nbetter, don't you, Sam? Don't take the easy way out! You'll only get\ndeeper and deeper into your makebelieve world. It will be like\nquicksand. Admit your mistakes--face up to them--_lick them_.\"\n\nCollins stood up, and came around the end of the table.\n\n\"You're too pretty to be so serious all the time,\" he said.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Sam, I want to help you. Please don't spoil it by misinterpreting my\nintentions.\"\n\n\"You should get a little fun out of life,\" Collins listened to himself\nsay.\n\nHe came on around the big table towards her.\n\nThe first time he hadn't realized what was happening, but this time he\nknew. Somebody was pulling strings and making him jump. He had as much\ncontrol as Charlie McCarthy.\n\n\"Don't come any closer, Sam.\"\n\nNancy managed to keep her voice steady, but he could tell she was\nfrightened.\n\nHe took another step.\n\nShe threw her coffee in his face.\n\nThe liquid was only lukewarm but the sudden dash had given him some\nawareness of his own body again, like the first sound of the alarm\nfaintly pressing through deep layers of sleep.\n\n\"Sam, Sam, _please_ don't make me do it! Please, Sam, _don't_!\"\n\nNancy had the gun in her hand, rising from her chair.\n\nHis hands wanted to grab her clothes and _tear_.\n\nBut that's _suicide_, he screamed at his body.\n\nAs his hand went up with the intention of ripping, he deflected it just\nenough to shove the barrel of the gun away from him.\n\nThe shot went off, but he knew instantly that it had not hit him.\n\nThe gun fell to the floor, and with its fall, something else dropped\naway and he was in command of himself again.\n\nNancy sighed, and slumped against him, the left side of her breast\nsuddenly glossy with blood.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nEd Michaels stared at him. Both eyes unblinking, just staring at _him_.\nHe had only taken one look at the girl lying on the floor, blood all\nover her chest. He hadn't looked back.\n\n\"I didn't know who else to call, Ed.\" Collins said. \"Sheriff Thurston\nbeing out of town and all.\"\n\n\"It's okay, Sam. Mike swore me in as a special deputy a couple years\nback. The badge is at the store.\"\n\n\"They'll hang me for this, won't they, Ed?\"\n\nMichaels put his hand on Collins' shoulder. \"No, they won't do that to\nyou, boy. We know you around here. They'll just put you away for a\nwhile.\"\n\n\"The asylum at Hannah, huh?\"\n\n\"Damn it, yes! What did you expect? A marksman medal?\"\n\n\"Okay, Ed, okay. Did you call Doc Van der Lies like I told you when I\nphoned?\"\n\nMichaels took a folded white handkerchief from his pocket and wiped his\nsquare-jawed face. \"You sure are taking this calm, Sam. I'm telling you,\nSam, it would look better for you if you at least _acted_ like you were\nsorry.... Doc Van der Lies is up in Wisconsin with Mike. I called Doc\nCandle.\"\n\n\"He's an undertaker,\" Collins whispered.\n\n\"Don't you expect we need one?\" Michaels asked. Then as if he wasn't\nsure of the answer to his own question, he said, \"Did you examine her to\nsee if she was dead? I--I don't know much about women. I wouldn't be\nable to tell.\"\n\nIt didn't sound like a very good excuse to Collins.\n\n\"I guess she's dead,\" Collins said. \"That's the way he must have wanted\nit.\"\n\n\"_He?_ Wait a minute, Sam. You mean you've got one of those split\npersonalities like that girl on TV the other night? There's somebody\nelse inside you that takes over and makes you do things?\"\n\n\"I never thought of it just like that before. I guess that's one way to\nlook at it.\"\n\nThe knock shook the back door before Michaels could say anything. The\ndoor opened and Doc Candle slithered in disjointedly, a rolled-up\nstretcher over his shoulder.\n\n\"Hello, boys,\" Candle said. \"A terrible accident, it brings sorrow to us\nall. Poor Nancy. Has the family been notified?\"\n\n\"Good gosh, I forgot about it,\" Michaels said. \"But maybe we better wait\nuntil you get her--arranged, huh, Doc?\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Quite so.\" The old man laid the canvas stretcher out beside the girl on\nthe floor and unrolled it. He flipped the body over expertly like a\nwindow demonstrator flipping a pancake over on a griddle.\n\n\"Ed, if you'd just take the front, I'll carry the rear. My vehicle is in\nthe alley.\"\n\n\"Sam, you carry that end for Doc. You're a few years younger.\"\n\nCollins wanted to say that he couldn't, but he didn't have enough yet to\nargue with. He picked up the stretcher and looked down at the white feet\nin the Scotch plaid slippers.\n\nCandle opened the door and waited for them to go through.\n\nThe girl on the stretcher parted her lips and rolled her head back and\nforth, a puzzled expression of pain on her face.\n\nCollins nearly dropped the stretcher, but he made himself hold on\ntight.\n\n\"Ed! Doc! She moved! She's still _alive_.\"\n\n\"Cut that out now, Sam,\" Ed Michaels snapped. \"Just carry your end.\"\n\n\"She's alive,\" Collins insisted. \"She moved again. Just turn around and\ntake a look, Ed. That's all I ask.\"\n\n\"I hefted this thing once, and that's enough. You _move_, Sam. I've got\na .38 in my belt, and I went to Rome, Italy, for the Olympics about the\ntime you were getting yourself born, Sam. I ought to be able to hit a\ntarget as big as you. Just go ahead and do as you're told.\"\n\nCollins turned desperately towards Candle. Maybe Nancy had been right,\nmaybe he had been imagining things.\n\n\"Doc, you take a look at her,\" Collins begged.\n\nThe old man vibrated over to the stretcher and looked down. The girl\ntwisted in pain, throwing her head back, spilling her hair over the head\nof the stretcher.\n\n\"Rigor mortis,\" Doc Candle diagnosed, with a wink to Collins.\n\n\"No, Doc! She needs a doctor, blood transfusions....\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Nonsense,\" Candle snapped. \"I'll take her in my black wagon up to my\nplace, put her in the tiled basement. I'll pump out all her blood and\nflush it down the commode. Then I'll feed in Formaldi-Forever Number\nZero. Formaldi-Forever, for the Blush of Death. 'When you think of a\nPretty Girl, think of Formaldi-Forever, the Way to Preserve that\nBeauty.' Then I'll take a needle and some silk thread and just a few\nstitches on the eyelids and around the mouth....\"\n\n\"Doc, will you...?\" Michaels said faintly.\n\n\"Of course. I just wanted to show Sam how foolish he was in saying the\nBeloved was still alive.\"\n\nNancy kicked one leg off the stretcher and Candle picked it up and\ntucked it back in.\n\n\"Ed, if you'd just turn around and _look_.\" Collins said.\n\n\"I don't want to have to look at your face, you murdering son. You make\nme, you say one more word, and I'll turn around and shoot you between\nthe eyes.\"\n\nDoc Candle nodded. Collins knew then that Michaels really would shoot\nhim in the head if he said anything more, so he kept quiet.\n\nCandle held the door. They managed to get the stretcher down the back\nsteps, and right into the black panel truck. They fitted the stretcher\ninto the special sockets for it, and Doc Candle closed the double doors\nand slapped his dry palm down on the sealing crevice.\n\nInstantly, there was an answering knock from inside the truck, a dull\necho.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Didn't you hear that?\" Collins asked.\n\n\"Hear what?\" Michaels said.\n\n\"What are you hearing now, Sam?\" Candle inquired solicitously.\n\n\"Oh. Sure,\" Michaels said. \"Kind of a _voice_, wasn't it, Sam? Didn't\nunderstand what it said. Wasn't listening too close, not like you.\"\n\n_Thud-thud-thump-thud._\n\n\"No voice,\" Collins whispered. \"That infernal sound, don't you hear it,\nEd?\"\n\n\"I must hurry along,\" the undertaker said. \"Must get ready to work on\nNancy, get her ready for her parents to see.\"\n\n\"All right, Doc. I'll take care of Sam.\"\n\n\"Where you going to jail me, Ed?\" Collins asked, his eyes on the closed\ntruck doors. \"In your storeroom like you did Hank Petrie?\"\n\nMichaels' face suddenly began to work. \"Jail? Jail you? Jail's too good\nfor you. Doc, have you got a tow rope in that truck?\"\n\nEd Michaels was the best shot in town, probably one of the best marksmen\nin the world. He had been in the Olympics about thirty years ago. He was\nWaraxe's one claim to fame. But he wasn't a cowboy. He wasn't a fast\ndraw.\n\nCollins put all of his weight behind his left fist and landed it on the\npoint of Michaels' jaw, just the way he used to do when gangs of boys\njumped onto him.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nMichaels sprawled out, spread-eagled.\n\nThen Collins wanted to take the revolver out of Ed's belt, and press it\ninto Ed's hand, curling his fingers around the grip and over the\ntrigger, and then he wanted to shake Ed awake, slap his face and shake\nhim....\n\nCollins spun around, clawed open the door to the truck cab and threw\nhimself behind the steering wheel.\n\nHe stopped wanting to make Ed Michaels shoot him.\n\nHe flipped the ignition switch, levered the floor shift and drove away.\n\nAnd he was going to drive on and on and on and on.\n\nAnd on and on and on.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nCollins turned onto the old McHenty blacktop, his foot pressed to the\nfloorboards. Ed Michaels didn't own a car; he would have to borrow one\nfrom somebody. That would take time. Maybe Candle would give him his\nhearse to use to follow the Black Rachel.\n\nTrees, fences, barns whizzed past the windows of the cab and then the\nsteel link-mesh fence took up, the fence surrounding the New Kansas\nNational Spaceport. Behind it, further from town, some of the concrete\nhad been poured and the horizon was a remote, sterile gray sweep.\n\nThe McHenty Road would soon be closed to civilian traffic. But right now\nthe government wanted people to drive along and see that the spaceship\nwas nothing terrible, nothing to fear.\n\nThe girl, Nancy Comstock, was alive in the back. He knew that. But he\ncouldn't stop to prove it or to help her. Candle would make them lynch\nhim first.\n\nWhy hadn't Candle stopped him from getting away?\n\nHe had managed to break his control for a second. He had done that\nbefore when he deflected Nancy's aim. But he couldn't resist Candle for\nlong. Why hadn't Candle made him turn around and come back?\n\nCandle's control of him had seemed to stop when he got inside the cab of\nthe truck. Could it be that the metal shield of the cab could protect an\nEarthling from the strange mental powers of the creature from another\nplanet which was inhabiting the body of Doc Candle?\n\nCollins shook his head.\n\nMore likely Candle was doing this just to get his hopes up. He probably\nwould seize control of him any time he wanted to. But Collins decided to\ngo on playing it as if he did have some hope, as if a shield of metal\ncould protect him from Candle's control. Otherwise ... there was no\notherwise.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nCollins suddenly saw an opening.\n\nThe steel mesh fence was ruptured by a huge semitrailer truck turned on\nits side. Twenty feet of fence on either side was down. This was\nrestricted government property, but of course spaceships were hardly\nprime military secrets any longer. Repairs in the fence had not been\nmade instantaneously, and the wreckage was not guarded.\n\nCollins swerved the wheel and drove the old wagon across the\nwaffle-plate obstruction, onto the smooth tarmac beyond.\n\nHe raced, raced, raced through the falling night, not sure where he was\nheaded.\n\nUp above he saw the shelter of shadows from a cluster of half-finished\nbuildings. He drove into them and parked.\n\nCollins sat still for a moment, then threw open the door and ran around\nto the back of the truck, jerking open the handles.\n\nNancy fell out into his arms.\n\n\"What kind of ambulance is this?\" she demanded. \"It doesn't look like an\nambulance. It doesn't smell like an ambulance. It looks like--looks\nlike--\"\n\nCollins said, \"Shut up. Get out of there. We've got to hide.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"They think I murdered you.\"\n\n\"Murdered me? But I'm alive. Can't they see I'm alive?\"\n\nCollins shook his head. \"I doubt it. I don't know why, but I don't think\nit would be that simple. Come with me.\"\n\nThe blood on her breast had dried, and he could see it was only a\nshallow groove dug by the bullet. But she flinched in pain as she began\nto walk, pulling the muscles.\n\nThey stopped and leaned against a half-finished metallic shed.\n\n\"Where are we? Where are you taking me?\"\n\n\"This is the spaceport. Now shut up.\"\n\n\"Let me go.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"I'm not dead,\" Nancy insisted. \"You know I'm not dead. I won't press\ncharges against you--just let me go free.\"\n\n\"I told you it wasn't that simple. He wants them to think you're dead,\nand that's what they'll think.\"\n\nNancy passed fingers across her eyes. \"Who? Who are you talking about?\"\n\n\"Doc Candle. He won't let them know you're alive.\"\n\nNancy rubbed her forehead with both hands. \"Sam, you don't know what\nyou're doing. You don't--know what you're getting yourself into. Just\nlet me show myself to someone. They'll know I'm not dead. Really they\nwill.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" he said. \"Let's find somebody.\"\n\nHe led her toward a more nearly completed building, showing rectangles\nof light. They looked through the windows to see several men in uniforms\nbending over blueprints on a desk jury-rigged of sawhorses and planks.\n\n\"Sam,\" Nancy said, \"one of those men is Terry Elston. He's a Waraxe boy.\nI went to school with him. He'll know me. Let's go in....\"\n\n\"No,\" Collins said. \"We don't go in.\"\n\n\"But--\" Nancy started to protest, but stopped. \"Wait. He's coming out.\"\n\nCollins slid along the wall and stood behind the door. \"Tell him who you\nare when he comes out. I'll stay here.\"\n\nThey waited. After a few seconds, the door opened.\n\nNancy stepped into the rectangle of light thrown on the concrete from\nthe window.\n\n\"Terry,\" she said. \"Terry, it's me--Nancy Comstock.\"\n\nThe blue-jawed young man in uniform frowned. \"Who did you say you were?\nHave you got clearance from this area?\"\n\n\"It's me, Terry. Nancy. Nancy Comstock.\"\n\nTerry Elston stepped front and center. \"That's not a very good joke. I\nknew Nancy. Hell of a way to die, killed by some maniac.\"\n\n\"Terry, _I'm_ Nancy. Don't you recognize me?\"\n\nElston squinted. \"You look familiar. You look a little like Nancy. But\nyou can't be her, because she's dead.\"\n\n\"I'm here, and I tell you I'm _not_ dead.\"\n\n\"Nancy's dead,\" Elston repeated mechanically. \"Say, what are you trying\nto pull?\"\n\n\"Terry, behind you. A maniac!\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Elston said. \"Sure. There's a maniac _behind_ me.\"\n\nCollins stepped forward and hit Elston behind the ear. He fell silently.\n\nNancy stared down at him.\n\n\"He refused to recognize me. He acted like I was crazy, pretending to be\nNancy Comstock.\"\n\n\"Come on along,\" Collins urged. \"They'll probably shoot us on sight as\ntrespassers.\"\n\nShe looked around herself without comprehension.\n\n\"Which way?\"\n\n\"_This way._\"\n\nCollins did not say those words.\n\nThey were said by the man with the gun in the uniform like the one worn\nby Elston. He motioned impatiently.\n\n\"This way, this way.\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"No priority,\" Colonel Smith-Boerke said as he paced back and forth, gun\nin hand.\n\nFrom time to time he waved it threateningly at Collins and Nancy who sat\non the couch in Smith-Boerke's office. They had been sitting for close\nto two hours. Collins now knew the Colonel did not intend to turn him\nover to the authorities. They were being held for reasons of\nSmith-Boerke's own.\n\n\"They sneak the ship in here, plan for an unscheduled hop from an\nuncompleted base--the strictest security we've used in ten or fifteen\nyears--and now they cancel it. This is bound to get leaked by somebody!\nThey'll call it off. It'll never fly now.\"\n\nCollins sat quietly. He had been listening to this all evening.\nSmith-Boerke had been drinking, although it wasn't very obvious.\n\nSmith-Boerke turned to Collins.\n\n\"I've been waiting for somebody like you. Just waiting for you to come\nalong. And here you are, a wanted fugitive, completely in my power!\nPerfect, _perfect_.\"\n\nCollins nodded to himself. Of course, Colonel Smith-Boerke had been\nwaiting for him. And Doc Candle had driven him right to him. It was\ninescapable. He had been intended to escape and turn up right here all\nalong.\n\n\"What do you want with me?\"\n\nSmith-Boerke's flushed face brightened. \"You want to become a hero? A\nhero so big that all these trumped-up charges against you will be\ndropped? It'll be romantic. Back to Lindbergh-to-Paris. Tell me,\nCollins, how would you like to be the first man to travel faster than\nlight?\"\n\nCollins knew there was no way out.\n\n\"All right,\" he said.\n\nSmith-Boerke wiped a hand across his dry mouth.\n\n\"Project Silver _has_ to come off. My whole career depends on it. You\ndon't have anything to do. Everything's cybernetic. Just ride along and\nprove a human being can survive. Nothing to it. No hyperdrives, none of\nthat kind of stuff. We had an engine that could go half lightspeed and\nnow we've made it twice as efficient and more. No superstitions about\nEinstein, I hope? No? Good.\"\n\n\"I'll go,\" Collins said. \"But what if I had said 'no'.\"\n\nSmith-Boerke put the gun away in a desk drawer.\n\n\"Then you could have walked out of here, straight into the MP's.\"\n\n\"Why didn't they come in here after me?\"\n\n\"They don't have security clearance for this building.\"\n\n\"_Don't_ leave me alone,\" Nancy said urgently. \"I don't understand\nwhat's happening. I feel so helpless. I need help.\"\n\n\"You're asking the wrong man,\" Collins said briefly.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nCollins felt safe when the airlock kissed shut its metal lips.\n\nIt was not like the house, but yet he felt safe, surrounded by all the\ncomplicated, expensive electronic equipment. It was big, solid,\nsterilely gleaming.\n\nAnother thing--he had reason to believe that Doc Candle's power could\nnot reach him through metal.\n\n\"But I'm not outside,\" Doc Candle said, \"I'm in here, with you.\"\n\nCollins yelled and cursed, he tried to pull off the acceleration webbing\nand claw through the airlock. Nobody paid any attention to him. Count\ndowns had been automated. Smith-Boerke was handling this one himself,\nand he cut off the Audio-In switch from the spaceship. Doc Candle said\nnothing else for a moment, and the spaceship, almost an entity itself,\nwent on with its work.\n\nThe faster-than-light spaceship took off.\n\nAt first it was like any other rocket takeoff.\n\nThe glow of its exhaust spread over the field of the spaceport, then\nover the hills and valleys, and then the town of Waraxe, spreading\nillumination even as far as Sam Collins' silent house.\n\nAfter a time of being sick, Collins lay back and accepted this too.\n\n\"That's right, that's it,\" Doc Candle said. \"Take it and die with it.\nThat's the ticket.\"\n\nCollins' eyes settled on a gauge. Three quarters lightspeed. Climbing.\n\nNothing strange, nothing untoward happened when you reached lightspeed.\nIt was only an arbitrary number. All else was superstition. Forget it,\nforget it, forget it.\n\n_Something_ was telling him that. At first he thought it was Doc Candle\nbut then he knew it was the ship.\n\nCollins sat back and took it, and what he was taking was death. It was\ncreeping over him, seeping into his feet, filling him like liquid does a\nsponge.\n\nNot will, but curiosity, caused him to turn his head.\n\nHe saw Doc Candle.\n\nThe old body was dying. He was in the emergency seat, broken, a ribbon\nof blood lacing his chin. But Doc Candle continued to laugh triumphantly\nin Collins' head.\n\n\"Why? Why do you have to kill me?\" Collins asked.\n\n\"Because I am evil.\"\n\n\"How do you know you're evil?\"\n\n\"_They told me so!_\" Candle shouted back in the thundering silence of\nDeath's approach. \"They were always saying I was bad.\"\n\n_They._\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nCollins got a picture of something incredibly old and incredibly wise,\nbut long unused to the young, clumsy gods. Something that could mar the\nmolding of a godling and make it mortal.\n\n\"But I'm not really so very bad,\" Doc Candle went on. \"I had to\ndestroy, but I picked someone who really didn't care if he were\ndestroyed or not. An almost absolutely passive human being, Sam. You.\"\n\nCollins nodded.\n\n\"And even then,\" said the superhuman alien from outer space, \"I could\nnot just destroy. I have created a work of art.\"\n\n\"Work of art?\"\n\n\"Yes. I have taken your life and turned it into a horror story, Sam! A\nchilling, demonic, black-hearted horror!\"\n\nCollins nodded again.\n\n_LIGHTSPEED._\n\nThere was finally something human within Sam Collins that he could not\ndeny. He wanted to live. It wasn't true. He did care what happened.\n\nYou do? said somebody.\n\nHe does? asked somebody else, surprised, and suddenly he again got the\nimage of wiser, older creatures, a little ashamed because of what they\nhad done to the creature named Doc Candle.\n\nHe does, chorused several voices, and Sam Collins cried aloud: \"I do! I\nwant to live!\" They were just touching lightspeed; he felt it.\n\nThis time it was not just a biological response. He really wanted help.\nHe wanted to stay alive.\n\nFrom the older, wiser voices he got help, though he never knew how; he\nfelt the ship move slipwise under him, and then a crash.\n\nAnd Doc Candle got help too, the only help even the older, wiser ones\ncould give him.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey pulled him out of the combined wreckage of the spaceship and his\nhouse. Both were demolished.\n\nIt was strange how the spaceship Sam Collins was on crashed right into\nhis house. Ed Michaels recalled a time in a tornado when Sy Baxter's car\nwas picked up, lifted across town and dropped into his living room.\n\nWhen the men from the spaceport lifted away tons of rubble, they found\nhim and said, \"He's dead.\"\n\nNo, I'm not, Collins thought. I'm alive.\n\nAnd then they saw that he really was alive, that he had come through it\nalive somehow, and nobody remembered anything like it since the airliner\ncrash in '59.\n\nA while later, after they found Doc Candle's body and court-martialed\nSmith-Boerke, who took drugs, Nancy was nuzzling him on his hospital\nbed. It was nice, but he wasn't paying much attention.\n\nI'm free, Collins thought as the girl hugged him. _Free!_ He kissed her.\n\nWell, he thought while she was kissing him back, as free as I want to\nbe, anyway.\n\n                                                                     END\n\n\n[Transcriber's Note:\n\nThis e-text was produced from Worlds of If January 1962.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
