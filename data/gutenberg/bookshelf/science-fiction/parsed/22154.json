More than a week\nof Earth time had passed since the self-styled \"vagabonds of space\" had\nleft Europa, and now they were fast approaching the great ringed orb of\nSaturn with the intention of exploring her satellites.\n\nBehind him, his Martian friend, Mado, was manipulating the mechanism of\nthe _rulden_, that remarkable Europan optical instrument which Detis\nhad installed in the vessel before they left. Mado was utterly\nfascinated by the machine, having spent most of his time during the\nvoyage searching the surfaces of Saturn's moons for signs of human\nhabitation. Now, as they headed directly for Titan, the sixth satellite,\nhe was completely absorbed in an examination of the heavy cloud layer\nthat covered it.\n\nBut Carr's thoughts were of his bride, who still slumbered in their\nstateroom amidships. In his bachelor days he never had imagined he could\nfind such contentment as had come with his marriage to Ora. He had\nfought shy of the fair sex on Earth. Somehow, the women he knew back\nhome had bored him; angling for a man's money and position, most of\nthem, and incapable of giving real love and companionship in return for\nthe luxuries they demanded. He was resigned to his single state.\n\nBut all that was changed by the little blue-eyed girl he had met in\nPaladar. She was a different sort; worth a hundred of those others and\nfulfilling to perfection the ideal he had always set up. On her world,\nJupiter's satellite, Europa, he had neither wealth nor influence; he'd\nleft these behind when he deserted Earth for a life of vagabondage among\nthe stars. But, to the daughter of Detis, this lack meant less than\nnothing; his love, and hers, meant everything.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd, what a good sport she had been! When they were threatened by Rapaju\nand his minions; when they barely escaped being swallowed up by that\nmonster of space which Mado had likened to the Sargasso Sea of Earth;\nwhen she herself proposed joining them in their rovings throughout the\nuniverse.\n\nShe was a companion of whom even the phlegmatic Martian was proud, she\nbrought with her presence on the _Nomad_ a subtle something that made of\nthe coldly mechanical space-ship a thing of new beauty and a place of\ncheerfulness--a home. And, to think he had won her for his own. To\nthink....\n\n\"Carr!\" Mado's sharp exclamation startled him from his pleasant\nthoughts. \"Come here and take a look at this,\" the Martian demanded, his\nvoice betraying an excitement unusual for him. \"Something is wrong on\nthis satellite we're heading for.\"\n\nLocking the controls in the automatic position, Carr turned to join his\nfriend at the viewing-disk of the rulden. Mado had found an opening in\nthe heavy cloud layer, and before them was an unobstructed view of a\nrugged countryside where huge boulders had been scattered by the mighty\nhand of creation and where the sun shone weakly on the rim of a yawning\ncrater in which sulphurous vapors curled. They saw this strange land as\nfrom an altitude of a few hundred feet, though the _Nomad_ was still\nmore than a million miles from the satellite.\n\n\"What's wrong about that?\" Carr grunted. \"Excepting that it's just\nanother of these barren and useless bodies that doesn't even provide us\nwith an attracting interest.\"\n\n\"Wait,\" Mado replied, \"You'll see in a moment. Something--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt that instant there came a puff of blue flame from out the pit,\ncarrying on its heated breath a drifting sheet of incandescence that\nfluttered and pulsated like a thing alive. Mado switched on the sound\nmechanism of the rulden and the roaring of the pillar of flame came to\ntheir ears. There were other sounds as well; the babble of alien voices\nand the rumble of drums.\n\nImmediately the rough ground in the vicinity was filled with creatures\nof human mold, half naked red-skinned beings that rose up from behind\nthe boulders and rushed toward the pit of fire and the uncanny heat\nmantle that wandered ghost-like along its rim. Two of them carried\nsomething between them, a struggling writhing something which they stood\nerect at the crater's edge. It was a girl!--a slim, bronzed figure that\nswayed there an instant uncertainly as the throb of the drums rose high\nand the voices of the assembled savages swelled in a monotony of\nexultant chanting.\n\n\"Good Lord!\" Carr gasped. \"A human sacrifice!\"\n\nA quick push, a piercing scream immediately drowned out by the cries of\nthe multitude, and the girl was flung headlong into the welcoming folds\nof the white-hot ghost-mantle which hovered there like some greedy\nmonster of the lava pools of Mercury. The thing closed in around the\nwildly struggling body, enwrapping it with exultant constrictions of its\nhell-born substance and diving, flapping, smoking heat devil, into the\nflame from whence it had sprung. Mado touched a lever with quick\ntrembling fingers and the rulden's disk went blank.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSickened by what they had seen, the two friends stared at one another,\nwhite-faced.\n\n\"No place for us,\" Mado said, after a moment. \"Not with Ora.\"\n\n\"Right!\" Carr agreed grimly. \"But I'd like to get in close enough to see\nmore of Titan. How high is this cloud layer?\"\n\n\"About a mile above the surface. We can dive through and look them over;\nperhaps give them a taste of the disintegrator.\"\n\n\"Attaboy! You took the words out of my mouth. The devils! Who'd ever\ndream of such a horror in the twenty-fourth century--even out here?\"\n\n\"What's the reason for this serious discussion?\" The voice of Detis\nbroke in on them from the door of the control room.\n\n\"Plenty!\" Carr exclaimed. And the Europan listened gravely as he\ndescribed the awful thing they had witnessed.\n\n\"I am not surprised,\" he said calmly, when the Terrestrial ended his\nrecital. \"There are certain emanations from the mother planet that most\ncertainly will affect the mentality and baser instincts of a race living\nwithin their influence. I have been studying these vibrations for\nseveral hours.\"\n\nThey turned to the forward port as the scientist indicated the great orb\nof Saturn with its gleaming rings. Now, as they drew near to the\nenormous planet, it did indeed seem that there was a sinister quality in\nits shifting luminosity. Carr shivered, thinking of Ora.\n\n\"You mean,\" Mado asked, \"that there are vibrations in the ether\nhereabouts that are set up electrically by the planet?\"\n\n\"Precisely. Or rather I should say they are set up by the vast number of\nwhirling particles of which its encircling rings are composed. The wave\nform propagated is of a characteristic that is in tune with those\nportions of the brain which control the savage impulses. We may\ncertainly expect to find superstition-ridden ignorance and all manner of\nvice prevalent in the races of Titan.\"\n\n\"You think these vibrations will affect us?\" Carr inquired anxiously.\n\n\"Not if we make our visit short. The intensity is quite low.\"\n\n\"It'll be a short visit, all right. We'll be in Titan's atmosphere in\nabout forty minutes now, and, if I have my say, we'll be out of it and\naway again inside of an hour.\"\n\n\"Best thing you've said today,\" Mado approved. \"But let's have another\nlook in the rulden. We may find other gaps in the clouds.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe mechanism of the radio telescope whirred into life as he spoke and\nits disk shone bright with the reflected light of Titan as it pictured\nthe body. The _Nomad_ was speeding toward the ill-omened satellite at\nthe rate of more than a thousand miles a second.\n\nBut the surface was nowhere visible and Mado adjusted the focus so that\nthe view of the billowy cloud-covering fell rapidly away. Though\nactually they were approaching the satellite with tremendous velocity,\nit receded swiftly in the rulden's disk until the entire body showed as\na perfect sphere of uniform brilliancy. All surface markings were\nconcealed by the blanket of clouds.\n\n\"Just a moment, Mado,\" said Detis. \"I believe I saw something.\"\n\nThe Martian pressed a button and the image was stationary. A tiny black\nspot had appeared near one edge of the satellite's disk and this now\nspread rapidly like a blot of spilled ink. Then it stretched out into a\nwriggling line that quickly streaked its way across the equator,\ncompletely banding the body as they watched. A moment it lay there like\na great serpent encircling the globe, and then it vanished in a flash of\nintense light that left them blinking in amazement. It was as if a trail\nof gunpowder had been laid across the surface and then set off by a\ntorch in the hand of some unseen giant of the cosmos. A strange\nelectrical storm that agitated the cloud blanket mightily, then left it\nmore densely closed in than before.\n\nThrough the forward port the satellite could be seen with the naked eye,\ngrowing larger now and resolving itself into a tiny globe. To Carr it\nseemed that the diminutive moon winked provocatively as he turned to\nregard it without the rulden's aid. Off to the west, Saturn and her\nrings almost filled the sky, and their baleful light shone cold and\nmenacing against the black velvet of the heavens.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMado took the controls when the _Nomad_ entered the atmosphere of Titan\nand drifted over the sea of clouds. He corrected the altimeter for the\nmass of this body of three thousand miles diameter, and noted that they\nwere up about six thousand feet. Test samples indicated that the outside\nair, although thin, was pure. But they did not open the ports as they\nhad no intention of landing.\n\nOra had not yet awakened and Carr hoped fervently that she would not do\nso until they had left the immediate vicinity of Titan. It was vastly\nbetter if she missed seeing anything of the barbarians of the cloudy\nsatellite. Besides, with her adventuresome and fearless nature, she'd\nnot be satisfied merely to look on from afar--she'd want them to land.\nAnd that must not be done.\n\nSomething tinkled metallically against the hull plates of the vessel.\nAgain and again the sound was repeated, and soon they saw that the air\nwas filled with driving particles which clattered on the thick glass of\nthe ports and contacted resoundingly with the hull. A vast cloud of\nblack loomed directly ahead, springing up from the tossing cloud banks;\nand Mado yanked at the controls, swerving the _Nomad_ sharply from her\ncourse.\n\nBut there was no escaping the fury of that sudden squall; they were in\nthe thick of it in an instant, and the ship was buffeted and tossed\nabout as if it were a toy. Millions of the driving particles battered\nthe _Nomad_ and the din of their pounding was terrific as the ship was\nwhirled deeper into the midst of the tempest.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCarr saw that the black particles were piling up around the rim of the\nport, sticking fast to the metal of the hull. They were bristling in\nfantastic array, like iron filings adhering to the poles of a magnet. In\na flash it came to him that these particles were magnetic; the _Nomad_\nwas covered with them and they piled on ever more thickly, soon\nweighting her down so heavily that she lost altitude. They were at the\nmercy of a furious electrical storm of mysterious nature.\n\n\"Imps of the canals!\" Mado shouted above the din. \"We're finished! The\nmachinery is paralyzed. This iron hail is charged.\"\n\nThe viewing port was completely covered over now with particles that\narched across from rim to rim, slender rod-like things about two inches\nlong and of the thickness of heavy wire. Black, they were, as black as\ngraphite. Detis worked frantically with Mado at the useless controls,\nvainly endeavoring to stabilize the pitching vessel.\n\nDazed by the suddenness of the calamity, Carr turned to look at the\naltimeter. Five thousand feet, forty-five hundred, four thousand! Nose\ndown, and reeling drunkenly, the _Nomad_ was diving to certain disaster\non the rocky ground of Titan. He dashed from the control room, calling\ndistractedly to Ora as he raced along the passageway.\n\nShe staggered from the stateroom and into his arms, a slim, boyish\nfigure in her snug leather jacket and breeches. Together they were flung\nviolently against the partition by a heavy lurch of the vessel.\n\n\"What is it?\" she gasped, clinging to him for support.\n\n\"A freak storm, in Titan's atmosphere. Guess the _Nomad's_ done for.\"\nCarr drew her fiercely close as an awful picture flashed across his\nmind--of Ora's body mangled in twisted wreckage; of the savages finding\nit, down there....\n\nThe metal floor-plates seemed to buckle and hurl themselves aft with a\ngrinding crash of disrupted joints. Holding desperately to the precious\nlittle body within his arms, Carr was thrown off his feet. There was a\ndetonation as if the universe had been blasted into oblivion--then\ndarkness, and numbed silence.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Carr, you're hurt!\" Ora moaned.\n\nHe was--a little. His head was splitting and the taste of blood was in\nhis mouth, but it was nothing serious. He'd been half knocked out, but\nhis head was clearing already. Of far greater importance was the fact\nthat Ora was unharmed; he satisfied himself of that immediately.\n\n\"I'm all right,\" he grunted, struggling to his feet and feeling around\nin the blackness.\n\nThe lights in the passage were out and he groped blindly along the\npartition, the metal of which had suddenly become very hot to the touch.\nThere was a curious feeling of lightness as if his body had no weight at\nall; the ship rolled gently and he knew they were falling swiftly to the\ninevitable crash. Yet he clung fast to Ora, and, together, they made\ntheir way to the control room.\n\nFaint daylight streamed in through the ports there and he saw Mado and\nDetis, both bleeding from injuries they had received when the mysterious\nshock hurled them amongst the control mechanisms. They were working\nfuriously with the exciter-generator, which had stopped. The _Nomad_ was\nwithout power and helpless to exert her anti-gravity energy.\n\n\"The iron hail!\" gasped the Europan scientist. \"It gave up its charge,\nCarr--exploded. Here, give us a hand and see if we can get the\ngenerators started.\"\n\nThe ports were clear of the black particles and Carr saw that the outer\nsurface of the glass was cracked and darkened from the heat of the\nblast. He understood, remembering the black band and the flash they had\nseen across the cloud layer from afar. And in the instant of remembering\nhe saw that the ground was very near, rushing upward to meet them. A\ncoil of the exciter-armature broke away in his fingers; the thing had\nbeen burned out by the electric storm, and the _Nomad_ was doomed.\n\nThe altimeter needle moved with sickening speed and already registered\nbut little more than five hundred feet. Four hundred! Carr braced\nhimself for the impending crash and gathered Ora in his arms.\n\nAnd then a strange thing happened. Four light rays, dazzling in\nintensity, stabbed up at them from the forest beneath them and converged\non the vessel's hull. The _Nomad_ staggered, then came to an even keel\nand slackened in her mad dash to the surface. She vibrated from stem to\nstern under the mighty conflict of energies and they felt themselves\npressed hard against the floor-plate. But the mysterious energy beams\nhad come too late to save them. A densely wooded slope loomed directly\nahead. There was a crashing of branches and the rending of mighty\ntrunks, and the _Nomad_ came to a jarring stop.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Devils of Terra!\" Mado ejaculated. \"We're in a fine fix now. We'll have\nto set foot on Titan whether we want to or not.\"\n\nCarr had laughed, somewhat shakily, in relief. They were safe, all of\nthem, and no one much hurt. And the generator coils could be rewound.\nBut he sobered instantly at Mado's words; they'd have to produce copper\nand insulating materials for the job.\n\n\"Right,\" he agreed. \"And that's not so good.\"\n\n\"What's so terrible about landing here?\" Ora inquired. \"I thought we\nwere expecting to explore this satellite.\" She looked up from her\nministrations to Detis, who had a nasty scalp wound.\n\n\"The people here are dangerous savages,\" Carr answered gravely. \"At\nleast some of them are; we saw them in the rulden. You'll have to remain\naboard while we look up the ones who projected those rays and do some\nbargaining with them.\"\n\n\"What! You expect me to hide in the vessel while you're at work outside?\nNot much! I want to see something of Titan while we are here.\" Her\npretty chin was set in that determined manner she had.\n\n\"I tell you it's too risky!\" Carr was firm, but he looked at Mado\nbeseechingly, signaling for his support.\n\nBut the Martian only grinned owlishly. He knew as well as did Carr that\nOra would have her way.\n\n\"Risky--pooh!\" she returned. \"I'm not afraid. We have our ray pistols\nand the funny torpedoes you brought from Mars. Besides, I don't believe\nit's as bad as you think.\"\n\nCarr shrugged his shoulders. After all, they probably would not\nencounter any of the savages here in the forest. Beings of far greater\nintelligence were responsible for those rays, that much was certain.\nBesides, they'd be three able-bodied men out there to watch over her,\nand he'd make sure she didn't get too far away from the ship.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCarr was first to step from the opened manhole to the soft carpet of the\nTitanese forest. He found the air cool and crisp, with a tang of ozone\nassailing his nostrils. There was a pulsating motion in it that he could\nhardly define; it seemed that it massaged his cheeks and raised the\nshort hairs at the nape of his neck and on his forearms as if they were\nelectrified. Those vibrations Detis had told them about were actively at\nwork.\n\nThe gravity was even less than on Mars, though slightly greater than\nthat of Europa. Mado was entirely at ease, and the Europans would not be\nbothered by the slight change in their weight. But Carr would have to\ntake it easy, as he'd done ever since leaving Earth. His muscles were\ntoo powerful for his body on these smaller worlds, though this was a\nmighty advantage if he took care not to over-exert.\n\nA melodious whistling note rose high somewhere in the depths of the\nforest and trailed off into eery silence. The sky was overcast with gray\nclouds and the light was poor, of little more than twilight intensity on\nTerra, this being partly due to the masking of the sun by the clouds and\npartly to their tremendous distance from that radiant body. Odd that it\nwas not colder, he thought. Probably those vibratory radiations of\nSaturn's rings had something to do with the temperature in addition to\ntheir other effects.\n\nDetis was on his knees, examining a queer specimen of purplish moss\nwhich had drawn his eye. The eternal scientist in the man could not be\ndowned. Mado had come out armed with one of the bulky kalbite\ntorpedo-projectors and was looking around belligerently.\n\nOra drew herself erect and took a deep breath as soon as her feet\ntouched the ground, her eyes bright and her cheeks flushed with\nexcitement. \"Oh, Carr,\" she breathed, \"it's marvelous; an\nhonest-to-goodness virgin forest. We've neither of us ever seen one, you\nknow. Aren't you thrilled?\"\n\n\"We-e-ll,\" he admitted, \"I've always looked forward to wandering in just\nsuch places. But, with you along, and thinking of those barbarians we\nsaw--\"\n\n\"Silly. I'm as capable as any of you. And, even if I couldn't look out\nfor myself, I know that you will be at my side.\" She pursed her lips and\ntossed back her head provocatively.\n\nWhat was a man to do?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA deep-toned booming note came then from the hills, commencing like the\nwarning siren of a space liner approaching its berth and swelling to a\nbombilation of ear-shattering sound that set the steel of the _Nomad's_\nhull vibrating and their very flesh and bones a-tingle. Then it died\naway as had the bird note which was the first sound of this world to\ngreet them.\n\n\"Jupiter! What's that?\" Mado unslung his torpedo-projector.\n\nAs if in answer to his startled question, a weird object drifted over\nthe treetops and poised directly above them, about fifty feet up. An\negg-shaped thing, six or seven feet in length, and seemingly made of\nwhite metal. It swayed there gently, without visible means of support,\nand they could make out a transparent disk on its side, back of which\nthere was a human head with eyes that regarded them curiously.\n\nMado raised his torpedo tube and took aim.\n\n\"Hold it!\" Carr warned him. \"This fellow's no savage. Probably he's one\nof those who tried to break our fall. Friendly, perhaps.\"\n\nTwo more of the ovoids drifted in from the woods and joined the first\none, all three settling a few feet lower and their occupants staring\nintently at the intruders.\n\n\"I'll get the psycho-ray apparatus,\" Detis said excitedly. \"We may be\nable to get thought contact with them.\" He dived through the _Nomad's_\nentrance-manhole as he spoke.\n\n\"Nothing so frightening about these creatures,\" Ora murmured, her eyes\nreproaching Carr. \"Why, they seem anxious to know that _we_ are not\nenemies.\"\n\nAnd, indeed, this seemed to be the case, for the strange ovoids wafted\nstill lower, dropping until a faint humming of the internal gravity\nmechanism came to their ears. These were a highly developed people of\nscientific attainment; civilized beings. But Mado kept firm hold of his\ntorpedo tube, and Carr fingered the ray pistol at his belt.\n\nThe booming note from the hills came then, frightfully near this time,\nand the three ovoids moved with sudden roaring of their motors,\nliterally hurling themselves skyward. But the menace they sought to\nescape was real, and not to be outdone in speed. A vast black something\nwhirred out from beyond the treetops and flung itself upon them.\n\n\"A pterodactyl!\" Mado gasped. \"One of the prehistoric monsters of\nTerra!\"\n\n\"Carr, there are men riding it!\" Ora exclaimed. \"Red men!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was true; the pteranodon, a horrid bat-like thing with a wing-spread\nof fully twenty feet, carried three of the bronzed savages clinging to a\nsort of harness that encircled its body just back of the crested head.\nThe huge flying reptile whistled raucously as it flew and one of the\nsavages was whirling a sling which held a stone as large as his own\nhead. They watched in amazement as the swift aerial steed flapped its\nway after the rising ovoids. And then the savage let loose an end of his\nthong and released its missile, which crashed full against the\ntransparent disk of an ovoid and tore its way through.\n\nThe damaged ovoid careened violently and then fell end over end,\ncrashing in the forest. With a bellow of fury, Mado fired with the\nkalbite tube at his hip. There was the twang of the propelling ray, and\nthe slender arrow-like torpedo sped forth on its message of death,\nsinging spitefully as it cleaved the air of Titan.\n\nIt was a fair hit, catching the pteranodon just ahead of its trailing\nlegs and exploding with the characteristic screaming roar of the deadly\nkalbite. The monstrous reptile and its crew of barbarians vanished in a\nblaze that lighted the clouds above them and brought a babble of excited\nshoutings from the depths of the forest on all sides. They were\nsurrounded by the uncivilized ones of Titan! And those of the ovoids had\nrun off at the first sign of danger.\n\nThe din from the forest was augmented by the whistlings of a second\npteranodon which darted after the remaining ovoids, following swiftly as\nthese retreated with ludicrous, wabbling haste.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOra screamed and struck out at something with her fist. A naked arm had\nreached out from the underbrush and grasped her wrist. Carr wheeled and\nhis ray pistol spat crackling flame. The savage, an undersized red man\nwith an enormous head, rose unsteadily from his hiding place, a look of\nterrible hate in his contorted features. Then, like a punctured balloon,\nhis body collapsed into the nothingness of complete disintegration.\n\n\"Back, back to the _Nomad_!\" Carr roared, dragging Ora with him and\nleveling his pistol at a group of the bronze brutes who rushed into the\nspace where the vessel lay amongst the trees.\n\nMado was busy with his torpedo tube and a vast explosion shook the\nground beneath them as a trio of the savages were blasted out of\nexistence. A great tree toppled and crashed across the nose of the\n_Nomad_, its roots ripped from the soil by the concussion.\n\nOra had whipped out her own pistol and was firing as they fell back.\nGame kid, she was! Carr gloated as he saw she was making each shot tell.\nBut this couldn't last; there were hundreds of them now, long-armed and\nbig-headed red devils swarming in from every direction. Carr dodged none\ntoo quickly to save his skull from a swift-flung stone, which clanged\nagainst the _Nomad's_ hull. There was a perfect hail of the missiles\nnow: one struck his left arm a numbing blow, and he heard a sickening\nthud and Ora's moan as she was hit. And there were winged darts, from\nblow-guns.\n\nA dusky moon-face leered into his own, horribly close, and he yelled his\nrage as he drove it back with a swift uppercut. But the horde of savages\ncame on in ever increasing numbers and with renewed vigor.\n\n\"Quick--inside!\" Carr hissed in Ora's ear as his fingers found the rim\nof the manhole. He'd have her safely within in a moment.\n\nDetis clambered out with the thought machine in his arms, and a singing\ndart from one of the blow-guns pierced him through and through. A look\nof astonishment spread over his kindly features, and he fell forward,\ndying.\n\nAnd then Carr looked up into a grinning face behind a huge club that was\nswinging downward. He threw up his arm to break the force of the blow,\nbut the club fell too swiftly; the enormous weight of it crashed down on\nhis skull, and he knew no more.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen he awakened it was to stare for a dazed moment into a pair of blue\neyes that looked down upon him in a place of dim light and stuffy\natmosphere. The eyes were only vaguely familiar in his befuddled memory.\nBeautiful eyes, though, and incredibly dear....\n\n\"Ora!\" he exclaimed, in wondering remembrance, trying to sit up as he\ngrasped her hand.\n\n\"Hush!\" she warned him, placing a finger-tip to his lips. \"Be quiet now\nand perhaps they'll leave us alone for a while.\"\n\n\"They! Did they capture us?\" he whispered. \"Are you hurt?\"\n\n\"We're prisoners, all right, excepting poor father. But they didn't harm\n_me_ much, outside of the rough handling.\"\n\n\"The devils. What of Detis?\" He was growing stronger by the minute and\nnow saw that they were in an open-mouthed cave and that Mado was sitting\nhunched dejectedly in a corner, his massive shoulders drooping and his\nproud head bowed on his chest.\n\n\"Father--they killed him,\" Ora sighed almost inaudibly. \"Have you\nforgotten? We saw the dart strike him and I--I saw it sticking from his\nchest. Oh, Carr!\" A dry sob caught in her throat.\n\n\"Yes--yes. Lord!\" Carr groaned, sick at heart with the sudden\nrecollection and full of compassion for the stricken girl.\n\nHe patted her hand with clumsy tenderness as she turned her head and\ngazed out through the cave mouth in silence that was fraught with\nintense pain. She would take it like that: with little to say but with\nmuch inward suffering.\n\nAnd then he noticed a fourth occupant of the cavern, a young lad of\nTitan. Like one of the savages in his small stature and in the large\nsize of his head, he was much lighter in color and his body was encased\nin a snug one-piece garment of shimmering material of silky texture. And\nthere was a different light in his eyes, the light of intelligence and\nculture.\n\n\"Who is that?\" Carr whispered.\n\nOra stared when she saw that the stranger was on his feet. \"Oh,\" she\nexclaimed, \"I'm glad he has recovered. He's one of the civilized ones;\nthey captured him with his ovoid when the second pteranodon went out\nafter them.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMado was standing now, endeavoring to communicate with the lad by means\nof signs and the drawing of crude pictures in the red sand of the cavern\nfloor. The graceful little fellow watched him with understanding and\nwith a smile of amused tolerance. Then he halted the big Martian with an\nimperious motion, addressing him in velvety voice.\n\n\"Nazu,\" he said simply, placing a forefinger on his breast and bowing\nbefore the astonished Mado.\n\n\"Imps of the canals!\" the Martian exclaimed, grinning delightedly as he\ncast a swift look at Carr and Ora. \"He's telling me his name.\" \"Mine's\nMado,\" he said, turning his eyes to the keen gray ones that smiled up at\nhim. \"Mado,\" he repeated, placing a huge fist against his own chest and\nbending his body in awkward imitation of the lad's courtly gesture.\n\nThey made no attempt to converse in tongues that would convey no\nmeaning, but there was no mistaking the quick friendship that sprang up\nbetween the incongruous pair. Mado was the boy's slave from that moment,\nand Nazu looked up to the Martian with all of youth's admiration for his\nvast bulk and rippling muscles.\n\nSuddenly they were without light and Carr saw that a curtain of woven\nrushes had been dropped over the mouth of the cave. There were soft\npadding footsteps on every side and he drew back against the rock wall\nwith Ora clasped in his arms. A sinewy hand grasped his wrist and\ntwisted his right arm free. He lashed out in the darkness and was\nrewarded by a grunt of pain as his fist contacted with an unseen face.\nNazu's voice rose in anguish, and Mado's wrathful bellow was followed by\na frightful commotion as he tore into his assailants.\n\nThey were everywhere in the blackness, these slippery little savages of\nTitan, their half naked bodies crowding him and stifling him with their\nsweaty nearness. Again and again Carr struck out, but it was like\nfighting a horde of squirming and clawing feline creatures that swarmed\nover him and bore him down by sheer weight of numbers. They dragged Ora\nfrom his arms and quickly overpowered him. Thongs of rawhide twisted\ndeeply into the flesh of his wrists and he was hauled forth into the\ndaylight.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSecurely tied, hand and foot, Carr was propped sitting with his back to\na huge boulder. He saw they had been carried to the place they had\nviewed in the disk of the rulden. A dozen paces away, Ora and Mado sat\nsimilarly bound. The Martian had been gagged as well and Carr was forced\nto smile despite the seriousness of the situation. His mad bellowings\nmust have proved as painful to the ears of the red dwarfs as had his\nfists to their bodies.\n\nNazu, unbound and walking proudly erect, was being marched to the edge\nof a smoking fissure by two of the savages. No others of the red men\nwere in sight.\n\nCarr shuddered. It was the place of sacrifice they had seen in the\nrulden, and the natives were in hiding as before. Nazu would be first to\ngo; then Ora, most likely. He strained desperately at his bonds when he\nrealized the awful significance of their position. It was incredible\nthat Ora was here and in the hands of these unspeakable monsters. Why,\nshe'd be thrown into the incandescent folds of the flapping\nfire-god, along with the rest of them! He groaned in an agony of\nself-recrimination; he should not have allowed her to come on this mad\nvoyage.\n\nThen came that roaring column of flame from out the crater, and the\nweird fluttering thing whose intense heat radiated across the\nintervening space like the breath of a blast furnace. The rumble of\ndrums commenced, and thousands of the red men dashed over the rocky area\nto worship at the shrine of their pitiless god.\n\nAs their monotonous chant rose high, Nazu was rushed to the edge of the\npit. The ghastly, shimmering heat-ghost drifted hungrily to await the\nflinging of the slight form into its consuming embrace. Carr was glad to\nsee that Ora had turned her head.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd then there came a sucking noise from the depths of the crater, and\nthe pillar of blue flame vanished abruptly, the incandescent ghost-shape\nflapping disconsolately in its wake. The chant of the savages trailed\noff into a chorus of disgruntled murmurings and the booming of the drums\ndied down in disappointment. The worshippers had been cheated of their\nsadistic pleasure. There was something wrong with the timing of the\nrite; their mysterious fire-god had granted the captives a reprieve.\n\nBut the prisoners were not deceived by the solicitous treatment accorded\nthem by their captors when they were returned to the cave and their\nbonds were severed. For well they knew that at the next appearance of\nthe phenomenon of the pit they would be dragged off to the sacrifice.\nSooner or later all of them were to meet the fate of those given into\nthe embrace of the heat-demon.\n\nA guard of fifty or more of the savages, armed with blow-guns and stone\nhatchets, paraded continuously before the mouth of the cave as one of\ntheir number returned with a huge woven container of fruits and nuts of\nstrange form and color. This was set before them and the bearer\nwithdrew.\n\n\"Humph!\" Mado grunted. \"Seems like they want to fatten us up for this\nheated sheet of theirs. Like hogs fattened for the market.\"\n\nBut he reached for the striped yellow melon atop the heap, and, at a\nbright nod of approval from Nazu, bit into its smooth skin.\n\nCarr's stomach rebelled when he looked at the food. He could not bear\nthe sight of the stuff, sitting there in the damp cavern with Ora's blue\neyes regarding him in the dim light. Those wide eyes held a gleam of\nhope and trust that would not be discouraged.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe gazed out through the cave mouth and calculated their chances. There\nwere none. Not against that horde of barbarians; there were too many of\nthe devils to fight with their bare hands. If only they had their ray\npistols, or a torpedo projector. At least they could sell their lives\ndearly. His eyes narrowed speculatively when they came to rest on a\npeculiar egg-shaped object that stood out there in the open. It was\nNazu's ovoid. Here was an idea!\n\nBut he saw that its entrance door was open and that the space inside was\ntoo small for any of them excepting one of the small stature of the\nTitanese. It was crammed with machinery. Nazu was the only one of their\nnumber who could squeeze into the thing; in fact he alone knew how to\noperate the queer flying machine. There must be others of his kind,\nplenty of them; another country, or a city full of them at least.\nPerhaps he might obtain aid if only he could be made to understand, and\nif they could get him out there safely somehow.\n\n\"Mado,\" he called, pointing, \"do you suppose we could dope out a way of\ngetting Nazu aboard his sky vehicle to go for help?\"\n\nThe Martian stared, his mouth stuffed with food and his jaws in full\naction. He strained suddenly to swallow the huge mouthful so he could\nmake reply.\n\n\"Not a chance,\" he grunted. \"Why, there's a million of them out there.\nYou won't catch them napping.\"\n\nBut he turned his attention from the basket of fruit and made a\ndesperate effort to convey the idea to Nazu, whose bright eyes took in\nhis every significant motion and whose sensitive fingers traced images\nin the sand that conveyed his own thoughts to the mind of the Martian in\nrapid succession.\n\n\"He's got it!\" Mado gloated. \"The game little cuss would go in a minute\nif we could get him to the ovoid. He's got a picture of a big island\nhere, so help me! An island covered with circular dwellings, made of\nmetal like the ovoids, he indicates. Look here.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCarr and Ora moved over to watch the swift sketching of the Titanese\nlad. By means of pantomime and his carefully drawn pictures, he told\nthem of his people, making it clear that they were forced to live in\ninsulated dwellings and travel only in the ovoids, which likewise were\ninsulated against the devastating vibrations that emanated from Saturn's\nrings. He sketched those rings, illustrating the vibrations and tapping\nhis own forehead in explanation of the effect on the brain; pointing to\nthe savages to indicate the ultimate fate of his kind. The protective\ninsulation, it appeared, was not permanent; sooner or later, all of them\nwould become barbarians like the others.\n\nThe savages out there were their fathers, mothers, sisters and brothers,\ngone mad; their skins darkened by continued action of the vibrations\nafter they fled their insulated homes. His pictures of the family life\nwere meticulously drawn. His people never warred upon these savage kin\nof theirs--naturally--though the reverse was not always true. However,\nNazu pointed to the ovoid and showed his willingness to help the\nstrangers. But he shook his head sadly as he counted the barbarians on\nhis fingers, multiplying the number endlessly by clapping his hands.\nThere were too many of them; the thing was impossible.\n\n\"Good Lord!\" Carr exclaimed. \"He's a marvel at communicating his\nthoughts without words. But I'd think his people would beat it for the\nhills without waiting. Might as well have it over with.\"\n\n\"But, they're still working on the problem,\" Ora objected. \"With their\nwisdom, they'll finally get the thing under control. And they probably\nhope to discover a way of restoring their maddened relatives.\"\n\nShe was doing something with the red sand; wetting her fingers in a\ntrickle of water that oozed from the wall and making a red paste which\nshe smeared on her white forearm and then rubbed off.\n\n\"I guess you're right,\" Carr admitted. Then, watching her strange\nperformance, he asked, \"What are you doing?\"\n\nShe looked up with sparkling eyes and stretched forth her arm. \"It\nstains, Carr, see!\" she exclaimed excitedly. \"We can fix up Nazu to\nresemble one of the savages. It is the exact color of their skin.\"\n\n\"Mado!\" he called, sensing at once the possibilities of her discovery.\nThey could make up Nazu to perfection. Mingling with the barbarians\nunsuspected, he might get possession of the ovoid.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Titanese lad fell in with the idea at once and the two men started\nwork on him with water and the powdery stuff they had taken for red\nsand. They stripped him of his silken garment and smeared him from head\nto foot, Carr taking especial care to see that his upper body and face\nwere thoroughly covered. Then, after using his own clothing to swab off\nthe coating, they stepped back to view the result. He was exactly like\none of the red men in color now, and he stood there twisting his face in\na wicked grin to heighten the similarity.\n\n\"The little devil!\" Mado chuckled. \"He gets the idea perfectly. We'll\nhave to muss his hair now and fix him up with a kirtle like theirs.\"\n\nRemoving his suede jacket and turning it inside out, he draped it about\nthe slim hips of Nazu, then slapped his chest approvingly. \"There you\nare, lad,\" he told the grinning youngster. \"A tough-looking kid we've\nmade of you, too.\"\n\nThe words were lost on the young Titanese, but his bright eyes showed\nthat he fully comprehended the humor as well as the gravity of the\nsituation. The improvised covering would pass without question as one of\nthe untanned hides the barbarians wore dangling from their waists. The\ndisguise was faultless.\n\nOra had been watching at the mouth of the cave. Now she called out in\nlow-voiced warning, \"Hurry! One of them is coming.\"\n\nCarr moved forward swiftly to face the opening, while Mado stood with\nhis great bulk hiding the now unrecognizable Nazu. The savage entered,\nproceeding directly to where Carr was standing. He bent over the fruit\nbasket and then the Earth-man was upon him.\n\nThe wiry red man struggled furiously, but Carr had a grip on his\nwindpipe that stopped his attempts to cry out and quickly reduced him to\na state of flabby subjection. Then he bound and gagged his captive,\ntearing strips of linen from his own shirt to provide the necessary\nmaterial. In a moment they had bundled the trussed-up dwarf into a dark\ncorner of the cavern, and Nazu stepped forth blithely to lift the basket\nto his shoulder.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEverything seemed to happen at once after that. Nazu stalked boldly out\namong the savages, who paid him no attention whatsoever. He passed out\nof their field of vision for a moment, and then they saw him at the\ncircular door of the ovoid. In a flash he was inside and the thing\nsoared speedily into the air and out of sight. The red men broke forth\nin a babel of excited jabbering and then they were crowding into the\ncave, hundreds of them it seemed, shrieking their rage as they attacked\nthe hapless prisoners.\n\nCarr went down fighting madly but to no avail. He hadn't counted on\nthis; he should have known better. A crushing weight of them was upon\nhim, clawing and beating at him as he struggled to rise. They were\nsuffocating him with their rank animal odors.\n\nAnd then he was dragged into the open air. Battered and dazed, he saw\nthey had found their fellow, the one he had bound and gagged. Ora was\nconsiderably mussed up, but unharmed, he observed with relief; but Mado\nlay there inert. This was the first time Carr had ever seen him take the\ncount at the hands of man.\n\nWhen they had untied the one whose place had been taken by Nazu, he came\nstraight for the Earth-man and would have brained him with a huge stone\nhad not his fellows interfered. He objected strenuously, his eyes red\nwith hate and a torrent of harsh gutturals pouring from his lips. But\nthe others held him off; this strange white giant from the machine of\nthe skies was to be saved for the embrace of the fire-god.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith the entire blame for Nazu's escape thus placed upon the\nTerrestrial, Ora and Mado were returned to the cavern and left\nunmolested. But Carr was prodded into moving over against a boulder and\nwas surrounded by a semi-circle of the dwarfs who squatted calmly to\nwatch him, blow-guns in their hands and stone hatchets on the ground\nwithin easy reach. They were taking no more chances with this one.\n\nThe long day of Titan dragged interminably but the watchful eyes of his\nguards never strayed from their prisoner. At any moment the fire-god\nmight make an appearance and the rite of sacrifice take place. Carr\nsupposed that the thing made more or less regular appearances, like a\ngeyser of Earth. And, next time, there would be no escape.\n\nNight fell, and still those eyes watched intently in the light reflected\nagainst the low-flung clouds from the seething crater nearby. Nothing\nhad been seen of Nazu or any of the ovoids. Probably it was useless to\nexpect them; they could not bring themselves to do battle against these\nsavage kin of theirs. Anyway, he was glad the little fellow had gotten\naway; he hoped he was safely in bed--if they had beds in those insulated\ndwellings.\n\nHe could not sleep. All through the night he sat with bowed head,\nalternately planning rescue attempts and cursing himself for bringing\nOra to this horrible end. Detis was dead; the _Nomad_ was hopelessly\nbeyond repair for many days, even if they could make their escape and\nlocate it; Nazu had saved his own skin, and they were left to the mercy\nof these vibration-crazed brutes who waited there in the flickering red\ntwilight all around him. It was a revolting ending for an adventure that\nhad started so auspiciously.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith the first faint light of dawn came the roaring of the pillar of\nflame from out the crater. Instantly there rose the hollow booming of\nthe drums and the chanting of thousands of the barbarous worshippers.\nThe place was swarming with them almost instantly, and Carr's guards\nclosed in on him with evil glee.\n\nOra was brought out into the open, her arms held fast by two of the red\ndevils who yanked her roughly along between them. Carr roared out in\nblind rage and in awful fear for the girl. He struck out viciously into\nthe first grinning face that pressed near. Something in his brain seemed\nto snap then, and he became a snarling, fighting animal, battling\nagainst overwhelming odds in defence of his mate. A dart buried itself\nin his arm and a stone hatchet bit into his shoulder, but he scarcely\nfelt the hurts. All that mattered now was Ora; they were taking her\naway--taking her to the folds of that incredible hot thing that flapped\nthere at the crater's rim. An arm snapped like a pipestem in his fingers\nand he heard the squeal of pain from somewhere in the tangled mass of\nsavages around him.\n\nAnd then they were falling back; easing up on him. The din was\nincreasing, but it seemed that a note of fear had crept in to replace\nthe exultant frenzy of those chanting voices. The drums were stilled.\n\nWiping the blood from his eyes with the back of his hand, he saw the\nbarbarians running everywhere; they were screaming in superstitious\nterror and fighting one another in their desperate anxiety to escape the\nvicinity of their precious fire-god. A tremendous voice boomed out over\nthe hubbub, a voice that came from the crater in vast commanding\ngutturals that struck terror into the souls of the panicky barbarians.\nYet somehow that mightily sonorous voice carried a familiar ring.\n\nCarr raised astonished eyes to the pillar of blue flame and was seized\nwith a well-nigh uncontrollable impulse to flee with the red men. For a\nmonstrous image of Detis swayed there in the hot vapors, a massive arm\nraised menacingly and an equally Brobdingnagian voice issuing from his\nlips in fierce syllables of the red man's tongue!\n\n\"Detis!\" Carr shouted. \"Detis! Ora--Mado!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd then he was running toward the crater's edge in bounding strides\nthat carried him twenty feet at a leap. He understood now. Detis had\nrecovered from his wound and was reversing the rulden's energy. He was\nprojecting his own image and voice, many times amplified, into the\ncolumn of fire to terrify the savages!\n\nOra was lying there, on the rim of the pit. She had fainted at sight of\nthe ghost-shape, whose white-hot folds flapped there, reaching to engulf\nher in their all-consuming embrace. Carr babbled like a madman as he\npulled her away from the horrible thing that pulsated with eager\nflutterings not three feet away, its hot breath singeing her silken\nlashes and brows.\n\nMado was there, encouraging him and yelling something else he couldn't\nunderstand; pointing skyward. And then he saw it; the _Nomad_, with its\nsleek, tapered cylinder of a body nosing down toward them with the\nsilvery aura of its propulsive energy gleaming like a beacon of hope\nagainst the dull clouds of the satellite of terror. And there was\nsomething else: one of the ovoids of Titan, clinging there to the\nvessel's hull plates, alongside the open manhole. Nazu had not failed\nthem after all. His mind refused to question the miracle further.\n\nSomehow, when the vessel landed, he managed to reach the manhole with\nhis precious burden. He staggered through the passageway and into their\nstateroom, tenderly stretching Ora on her own bed. In the next instant\nhe was rummaging in the medicine closet. He found ointment for her\nburns; smelling salts; damp cloths. With trembling fingers he ministered\nto her, a great joy welling up within him as he saw she was recovering.\nAnother minute, back there at the crater, and he'd have lost her\nforever. He swallowed hard at the thought, his eyes misty as he looked\ndown at her and remembered.\n\nImpatiently he jerked the barbed dart from his arm and poured a powerful\nantiseptic into the open wound, unmindful of the pain. As best he could,\nhe disinfected his other cuts and bandaged them. Ora had raised herself\nand now sat there, swaying weakly and regarding him with anxious gaze.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA little later they made their way forward to the control room. The\n_Nomad_ had taken off and was drifting slowly higher. At the controls\nsat a strange, bedaubed figure. Nazu!\n\nMado was peering through the coils of a helix of silver ribbon that had\nbeen erected beside the rulden.\n\n\"Father!\" Ora darted past him and dropped to her knees on the\nfloor-plates at the Martian's side. The body of Detis was slumped there\na ghastly corpse within those gleaming coils. But his kind features were\nfixed in a serene smile. He had gone to his reward with content in his\nheart.\n\nOnly then did Carr remember. One could not subject his body to the\nreversed energies of the rulden without certain expectation of death. A\nfew short seconds with those terrible oscillations surging through his\nbeing, carrying the amplified visual and oral reproduction through the\nether, and the Europan scientist had perished. Knowingly, willingly,\nDetis had given his life that the rest of them might live! Recovered\nmiraculously from his first serious injury, he had done this magnificent\nthing deliberately and gladly....\n\nA great lump rose in Carr's throat as Ora's sobbing came to his ears.\nWith his vision blurred by tears, he turned to the pilot's seat, where\nNazu faced him with solemn eyes.\n\n\"Nazu go now,\" the amazing young Titanese stated. He spoke in halting\nsyllables of Cos, the language of the inner planets!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCarr stared agape, scarcely believing his ears.\n\n\"Detis great man,\" Nazu continued, relinquishing his seat to the dazed\nEarthman. \"Nazu find him in ship. My people already there with him. They\nwant to help when you come. Return after capture and heal dart wound of\nDetis. Bring wire and help him fix motors. Work very quick, my people.\nDetis have brain machine. Talk with Nazu; teach him words, also very\nquick. Nazu tell where you are and we come to help. Then he scare away\nred men--and die. That is all. Now I go--and you go also. Quickly.\"\n\n\"So that's how it happened,\" Carr muttered, slowly mulling over the\namazing things he had heard. He watched the Titanese lad keenly as his\neyes wandered in Mado's direction. He saw the admiring light that came\ninto them as the big Martian removed the body of Detis from the helix\nand carried it gently away.\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" he interposed, as Nazu made as if to leave. \"Mado would\nlike to talk to you.\"\n\n\"Must go soon.\" The youngster drew himself up proudly. \"Nazu is prince\nof his people. They need him. And you--you must go at once. Vibrations\nof mother planet's rings work on you too long already. Must be quick.\nElse you be wild men--like those down there.\"\n\nHe waved his arm in a gesture that embraced all Titan. Anxiety was\nwritten large on his countenance and his gaze traveled nervously to the\ndoor through which Mado must return.\n\nThe big Martian was not long in coming. He had carried the body of Detis\naft, leaving Ora there with her dead. Carr's heart ached for her; he\nknew how silently and terribly she suffered. Knowing that her father had\nbeen healed of his deadly wound by the friendly Titanese, only to be\ntaken from her afterwards by his own heroic act, made the blow doubly\nhard.\n\nLater they would give Detis a decent burial, sending him through the\nairlock to drift aimlessly in space, preserved through the ages by the\nintense cold and the absence of air. A fitting tomb for the noblest of\nthe vagabonds!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMado chattered endlessly with Nazu, who was impatient to be off. Seeing\nthat it was impossible to detain him, and realizing at last the stern\nnecessity of hastening their own departure, he finally let him go. The\nyoungster bid Carr a sober, friendly farewell and followed Mado to the\nairlock.\n\nCarr heard the clang of the manhole cover as it swung home, and was\nbolted to its seat. The ovoid drifted away from the vessel and dropped\ntoward the forest beneath them. Nazu had gone to rejoin his people.\n\nHis fingers strayed to the controls. They must get away from the evil\ninfluence of those vibrations; he had felt something of their degrading\npower in the fighting down there. He had almost become a savage himself,\nhe remembered with a revulsion of feeling.\n\nThe feel of the levers brought to him a renewed sense of confidence and\nresponsibility. A while back he thought he'd never perform such simple\nduties again. The _Nomad_ responded instantly and rose swiftly to hover\nover the pit of the fire-god. The flame had partly subsided and the\nghost-shape wabbled there, changing form rapidly with darkening colors.\nSome weird phenomenon of nature that those brutes had set up as a deity.\n\nCarr increased the repulsion energy once more and the _Nomad_ shot\nskyward like a rocket. Through the floor port he saw Nazu's tiny ovoid\nscudding over the treetops. Then it had vanished.\n\n\"We're getting away none too soon,\" said Mado, rejoining him.\n\n\"Right.\" Carr watched the temperature indicator as he increased speed to\nthe maximum they could withstand in the atmosphere.\n\nThey were out above the cloud layer then and he cast apprehensive eyes\non the enormous flat disks encircling the great globe that was Saturn.\nSomething like a hundred and seventy thousand miles across them, he\nremembered. But the astronomers of the inner planets had little actual\nknowledge of their composition; they knew nothing at all of their\nterrible power or their strange inhabitants.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe _Nomad_ left Titan with tremendous acceleration now, as he increased\nthe speed of the rejuvenated generators. They'd go on, on toward Uranus,\nNeptune--anywhere, away from this ringed planet that was responsible for\nthe death of one of their number; away from the region that was soon to\nbecome the tomb of Detis.\n\nThere was silence then as the _Nomad_ raced on through the blackness.\nMado gripped the rail of the port and peered long and earnestly at the\ntiny pinpoint of light that now was Titan.\n\n\"Great kid, that Nazu,\" the Martian said, after a while. \"Too bad he\ncouldn't come along with us.\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Carr was thinking of the different life there would be on board\nthe _Nomad_; and well he knew that Mado was thinking of the same thing.\nThe Martian had missed the close companionship of his Terrestrial friend\nsince his marriage to Ora; missed it more than he would admit, even to\nhimself. And the lad, Nazu, had appealed to him; he would have fathered\nhim as only a lonely bachelor can. Suddenly Carr's own friendship for\nthe big fellow seemed a wonderful thing.\n\n\"Never mind, old man,\" he whispered, reaching over and gripping Mado's\nhand mightily, \"We'll be a three-cornered family, Ora and you and I.\nAnd, who knows but that you'll find the one and only girl yourself, some\nfine day?\"\n\n\"Oh, shut up!\" Mado grunted.\n\nBut a big hand closed down hard on Carr's fingers, and the Earthman knew\nthat their friendship was more firmly cemented than ever before.\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\nThis etext was produced from _Astounding Stories_ January 1932.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright\non this publication was renewed.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
