He\nwas almost through; only a few more letters and the inscription, cut\ndeeply into the tough granite, would be finished. He rounded out the\nlast period and straightened up, dropping his tools carelessly to the\nfloor of the cave. Proudly he wiped the perspiration from his dirty\nstubbled face and read what he had written.\n\n     I ROSE FROM THE SLIME OF THE PLANET. NAKED AND DEFENSELESS,\n     I FASHIONED TOOLS. I BUILT AND DEMOLISHED, CREATED AND DESTROYED.\n     I  CREATED A THING GREATER THAN MYSELF THAT DESTROYED ME.\n\n     MY NAME IS MAN AND THIS IS MY LAST WORK.\n\nHe smiled. What he had written was good. Not literary enough, perhaps,\nbut a fitting tribute to the human race, written by the last man. He\nglanced at the tools at his feet. Having no further use for them, he\ndissolved them, and, hungry from his long work, squatted in the rubble\nof the cave and created a dinner. He stared at the food for a moment,\nwondering what was lacking; then, sheepishly, created a table and\nchair, utensils and plates. He was embarrassed. He had forgotten them\nagain.\n\nAlthough there was no need to rush, he ate hurriedly, noting the odd\nfact that when he didn't think of anything specific, he always created\nhamburger, mashed potatoes, peas, bread and ice cream. Habit, he\ndecided. Finished, he made the remnants of the meal disappear, and with\nthem the plates, utensils and table. The chair he retained. Sitting on\nit, he stared thoughtfully at the inscription. _It's fine_, he thought,\n_but no human other than myself will ever read it._\n\nIt was fairly certain that he was the last man alive on the Earth. The\nwar had been thorough. Thorough as only man, a meticulous animal, could\nmake it. There had been no neutrals in this war, no middle-of-the-road\npolicy. You were on one side or the other. Bacteria, gas and radiations\nhad covered the Earth like a vast cloud. In the first days of that\nwar, invincible secret weapon had succeeded secret weapon with almost\nmonotonous regularity. And after the last hand had pushed the last\nbutton, the bombs, automatically guided and impelled, had continued\nto rain down. The unhappy Earth was a huge junkyard, without a living\nthing, plant or animal, from pole to pole.\n\nHe had watched a good part of it. He had waited until he was fairly\nsure the last bomb had been dropped; then he had come down.\n\n_Very clever of you_, he thought bitterly, looking out the mouth of the\ncave at the lava plain his ship rested on, and at the twisted mountains\nbehind it.\n\n_You're a traitor--but who cares?_\n\nHe had been a captain in the Western Hemisphere Defense. Within two\ndays of warfare, he had known what the end would be. Filling a cruiser\nwith canned air, food and water, he had fled. In the confusion and\ndestruction, he knew that he would never be missed; after a few days\nthere was no one left to miss him. He had raced the big ship to the\ndark side of the Moon, and waited. It was a twelve-day war--he had\nguessed it would last fourteen--but he had to wait nearly six months\nbefore the automatic missiles stopped falling. Then he had come down.\n\nTo find himself the only survivor....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe had expected others to recognize the futility of it, load ships\nand flock to the dark side of the Moon also. Evidently there had been\nno time, even if there had been the desire. He had thought that there\nwould be scattered groups of survivors, but he hadn't found any. The\nwar had been too thorough.\n\nLanding on the Earth should have killed him, for the air itself was\npoisoned. He hadn't cared--and he had lived. He seemed to be immune to\nthe various kinds of germs and radiations, or perhaps that was part of\nhis new power. He certainly had encountered enough of both, skipping\naround the world in his ship, from the ruins of one city to another,\nacross blasted valleys and plains, scorched mountains. He had found no\nlife, but he did discover something.\n\nHe could create. He realized the power on his third day on Earth.\nWistfully, he had wished for a tree in the midst of the melted rock\nand metal; a tree had appeared. The rest of the day he experimented,\nand found that he could create anything that he had ever seen or heard\nabout.\n\nThings he knew best, he could create best. Things he knew just from\nbooks or conversation--palaces, for example--tended to be lopsided\nand uncertain, although he could make them nearly perfect by laboring\nmentally over the details. Everything he created was three-dimensional.\nEven food tasted like food and seemed to nourish him. He could forget\nall about one of his creations, go to sleep, and it would still be\nthere when he awakened. He could also uncreate. A single concentrated\nthought and the thing he had made would vanish. The larger the thing,\nthe longer it took to uncreate.\n\nThings he _hadn't_ made--valleys and mountains--he could uncreate, too,\nbut it took longer. It seemed as though matter was easier to handle\nonce he had shaped it. He could make birds and small animals, or things\nthat looked like birds and small animals.\n\nHe had never tried to make a human being.\n\nHe wasn't a scientist; he had been a space-pilot. He had a vague\nconcept of atomic theory and practically no idea of genetics. He\nthought that some change must have taken place in his germ-plasm, or\nin his brain, or perhaps in the Earth. The \"why\" of it all didn't\nespecially bother him. It was a fact and he accepted it.\n\nHe stared at the monument again. Something about it bothered him.\n\nOf course, he could have created it, but he didn't know if the things\nhe made would endure after his death. They seemed stable enough, but\nthey might dissolve with his own dissolution. Therefore he compromised.\nHe created a chisel and mallet, but selected a granite wall that he\nhadn't made. He cut the letters into the inside of the wall of the\ncave so they would be safe from the elements, working many hours at a\nstretch, sleeping and eating beside the wall.\n\nFrom the mouth of the cave, he could see his ship, perched on a level\nplain of scorched ground. He was in no rush to get back to it. In six\ndays the inscription was done, cut deeply and eternally into the rock.\n\nThe thought that had been bothering him as he stared at the gray\ngranite finally came to the surface. The only people who would come\nto read it would be visitors from the stars. How would they decipher\nit? He stared at the inscription angrily. He should have written it in\nsymbols. But what kind of symbols? Mathematics? Of course, but what\nwould that tell them about Man? And what made him think _they_ would\ndiscover the cave anyway? There was no use for an inscription when\nMan's entire history was written over the face of the planet, scorched\ninto the crust for anyone to see. He cursed his stupidity for wasting\nsix days working at the useless inscription. He was about to uncreate\nit when he turned his head, hearing footsteps at the mouth of the cave.\n\nHe almost fell off the chair getting to his feet.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA girl was standing there. He blinked rapidly, and she was still there,\na tall, dark-haired girl dressed in a torn, dirty one-piece coverall.\n\n\"Hi,\" she said, and walked into the cave. \"I heard your hammer from the\nvalley.\"\n\nAutomatically, he offered her his chair and created another for\nhimself. She tested it gingerly before she sat down.\n\n\"I saw you do it,\" she said, \"but I still don't believe it. Mirrors?\"\n\n\"No,\" he muttered uncertainly. \"I create. That is, I have the power\nto--wait a minute! How did you get here?\" While he was demanding to\nknow, he was considering and rejecting possibilities. Hidden in a cave?\nOn a mountain top? No, there would be only one possible way....\n\n\"I was in your ship, pal.\" She leaned back in the chair and clasped her\nhands around one knee. \"When you loaded up that cruiser, I figured you\nwere going to beat it. I was getting tired of setting fuses eighteen\nhours a day, so I stowed away. Anybody else alive?\"\n\n\"No. Why didn't I see you, then?\" He stared at the ragged, beautiful\ngirl, and a vague thought crossed his mind. He reached out and touched\nher arm. She didn't draw back, but her pretty face grew annoyed.\n\n\"I'm real,\" she said bluntly. \"You must have seen me at the base.\nRemember?\"\n\nHe tried to think back to the time when there had been a\nbase--centuries ago, it seemed. There _had_ been a dark-haired girl\nthere, one who had never given him a tumble.\n\n\"I think I froze to death,\" she was saying. \"Or into coma, anyhow, a\nfew hours after your ship took off. Lousy heating system you have in\nthat crate!\" She shivered reminiscently.\n\n\"Would have used up too much oxygen,\" he explained. \"Just kept the\npilot's compartment heated and aired. Used a suit to drag supplies\nforward when I needed them.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you didn't see me,\" she laughed. \"I must have looked like the\ndevil, all covered with frost and killed, I bet. Some sleeping beauty I\nprobably made! Well, I froze. When you opened all the compartments, I\nrevived. That's the whole story. Guess it took a few days. How come you\ndidn't see me?\"\n\n\"I suppose I never looked back there,\" he admitted. \"Quick enough,\nI found I didn't need supplies. Funny, I thought I opened all the\ncompartments, but I don't really remember--\"\n\nShe looked at the inscription on the wall. \"What's that?\"\n\n\"I thought I'd leave a sort of monument--\"\n\n\"Who's going to read it?\" she asked practically.\n\n\"No one, probably. It was just a foolish idea.\" He concentrated on it.\nIn a few moments the granite wall was bare. \"I still don't understand\nhow you could be alive now,\" he said puzzled.\n\n\"But I am. I don't see how you do that--\" she gestured at the chair and\nwall--\"But I'll accept the fact that you can. Why don't you accept the\nfact that I'm alive?\"\n\n\"Don't get me wrong,\" the man said. \"I want company very much,\nespecially female company. It's just--Turn your back.\"\n\nShe complied, with a questioning look. Quickly he destroyed the stubble\non his face and created a clean pair of pressed pants and a shirt.\nStepping out of his tattered uniform, he put on the new clothes,\ndestroyed the rags, and, on an afterthought, created a comb and\nstraightened his tangled brown hair.\n\n\"All right,\" he said. \"You can turn back now.\"\n\n\"Not bad,\" she smiled, looking him over. \"Let me use that comb--and\nwould you please make me a dress? Size twelve, but see that the weight\ngoes in the right places.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the third attempt he had the thing right--he had never realized how\ndeceptive the shapes of women could be--and then he made a pair of gold\nsandals with high heels for her.\n\n\"A little tight,\" she said, putting them on, \"and not too practical\nwithout sidewalks. But thanks much. This trick of yours really solves\nthe Christmas present problem, doesn't it?\" Her dark hair was shiny in\nthe noon sun, and she looked very lovely and warm and human.\n\n\"See if _you_ can create,\" he urged, anxious to share his startling new\nability with her.\n\n\"I've already tried,\" she said. \"No go. Still a man's world.\"\n\nHe frowned. \"How can I be absolutely sure you're real?\"\n\n\"That again? Do you remember creating me, Master?\" she asked mockingly,\nbending to loosen the strap on one shoe.\n\n\"I had been thinking--about women,\" he said grimly. \"I might have\ncreated you while I was asleep. Why shouldn't my subconscious mind\nhave as much power as my conscious mind? I would have equipped you\nwith a memory, given you a background. You would have been extremely\nplausible. And if my subconscious mind _did_ create you, then it would\nmake certain that my conscious mind would never know.\"\n\n\"You're ridiculous!\"\n\n\"Because if my conscious mind knew,\" he went on relentlessly, \"it\nwould reject your existence. Your entire function, as a creation of my\nsubconscious, would be to keep me from knowing. To prove, by any means\nin your power, by any logic, that you were--\"\n\n\"Let's see you make a woman, then, if your mind is so good!\" She\ncrossed her arms and leaned back in the chair, giving a single sharp\nnod.\n\n\"All right.\" He stared at the cave wall and a woman started to appear.\nIt took shape sloppily, one arm too short, legs too long. Concentrating\nharder, he was able to make its proportions fairly true. But its eyes\nwere set at an odd angle; its shoulders and back were sloped and\ntwisted. He had created a shell without brains or internal organs,\nan automaton. He commanded it to speak, but only gulps came from the\nshapeless mouth; he hadn't given it any vocal apparatus. Shuddering,\nhe destroyed the nightmare figure.\n\n\"I'm not a sculptor,\" he said. \"Nor am I God.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you finally realize that.\"\n\n\"That still doesn't prove,\" he continued stubbornly, \"that _you're_\nreal. I don't know what my subconscious mind is capable of.\"\n\n\"Make something for me,\" she said abruptly. \"I'm tired of listening to\nthis nonsense.\"\n\n_I've hurt her feelings_, he thought. _The only other human on Earth\nand I've hurt her._ He nodded, took her by the hand and led her\nout of the cave. On the flat plain below he created a city. He had\nexperimented with it a few days back, and it was much easier this time.\nPatterned after pictures and childhood dreams of the Thousand and One\nNights, it towered black and white and rose. The walls were gleaming\nruby, and the gates were of silver-stained ebony. The towers were red\ngold, and sapphires glittered in them. A great staircase of milky\nivory climbed to the highest opal spire, set with thousands of steps\nof veined marble. There were lagoons of blue water, and little birds\nfluttered above them, and silver and gold fish darted through the still\ndepths.\n\nThey walked through the city, and he created roses for her, white and\nyellow and red, and gardens of strange blossoms. Between two domed\nand spired buildings he created a vast pool of water; on it he put a\npurple-canopied pleasure barge, loading it with every kind of food and\ndrink he could remember.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey floated across the lagoon, fanned by the soft breeze he had\ncreated.\n\n\"And all this is false,\" he reminded her after a little while.\n\nShe smiled. \"No it's not. You can touch it. It's real.\"\n\n\"Will it be here after I die?\"\n\n\"Who cares? Besides, if you can do all this, you can cure any sickness.\nPerhaps you can even cure old age and death.\" She plucked a blossom\nfrom an over-hanging bough and sniffed its fragrance. \"You could keep\nthis from fading and dying. You could probably do the same for us, so\nwhere's the problem?\"\n\n\"Would you like to go away?\" he said, puffing on a newly created\ncigarette. \"Would you like to find a new planet, untouched by war?\nWould you like to start over?\"\n\n\"Start over? You mean.... Later perhaps. Now I don't even want to go\nnear the ship. It reminds me of the war.\"\n\nThey floated on a little way.\n\n\"Are you sure now that I'm real?\" she asked.\n\n\"If you want me to be honest, no,\" he replied. \"But I want very much to\nbelieve it.\"\n\n\"Then listen to me,\" she said, leaning toward him. \"I'm real.\" She\nslipped her arms around his neck. \"I've always been real. I always will\nbe real. You want proof? Well, I know I'm real. So do you. What more\ncan you ask?\"\n\nHe stared at her for a long moment, felt her warm arms around his neck,\nlistened to her breathing. He could smell the fragrance of her skin and\nhair, the unique essence of an individual.\n\nSlowly he said, \"I believe you. I love you. What--what is your name?\"\n\nShe thought for a moment. \"Joan.\"\n\n\"Strange,\" he said. \"I always dreamed of a girl named Joan. What's your\nlast name?\"\n\nShe kissed him.\n\nOverhead, the swallows he had created--_his_ swallows--wheeled in wide\ncircles above the lagoon, his fish darted aimlessly to and fro, and his\ncity stretched, proud and beautiful, to the edge of the twisted lava\nmountains.\n\n\"You didn't tell me your last name,\" he said.\n\n\"Oh, that. A girl's maiden name never matters--she always takes her\nhusband's.\"\n\n\"That's an evasion!\"\n\nShe smiled. \"It is, isn't it?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Proof of the Pudding, by Robert Sheckley\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PROOF OF THE PUDDING ***\n\n***** This file should be named 50844.txt or 50844.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/0/8/4/50844/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\nwww.gutenberg.org\n\n\n\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\nU.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the\nmailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its\nvolunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous\nlocations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
