Trouble Times Two\n\n\nThe sun was glowing dull red as it slipped down behind the curving\nhorizon of Mars, but Gregory Hunter was not able to see it.\n\nThere was no viewscreen in the ship's cabin; it was too tiny for that.\nGreg twisted around in the cockpit that had been built just big enough\nto hold him, and shifted his long legs against the brace-webbing, trying\nto get them comfortable.\n\nHe knew he was afraid ... but nobody else knew that, not even the\ncaptain waiting at the control board on the satellite, and in spite of\nthe fear Greg Hunter would not have traded places at this moment with\nanyone else in the universe.\n\nHe had worked too hard and waited too long for this moment.\n\nHe heard the count-down monitor clicking in his ears, and his hands\nclenched into fists. How far from Mars would he be ten minutes from now?\nHe didn't know. Farther than any man had ever traveled before in the\nspace of ten minutes, he knew, and faster. How far and how fast would\ndepend on him alone.\n\n\"All set, Greg?\" It was the captain's voice in the earphones.\n\n\"All set, Captain.\"\n\n\"You understand the program?\"\n\nGreg nodded. \"Twenty-four hours out, twenty-four hours back, ninety\ndegrees to the ecliptic, and all the accelleration I can stand both\nways.\"\n\nGreg grinned to himself. He thought of the months of conditioning he had\ngone through to prepare for this run ... the hours in the centrifuge to\nbuild up his tolerance to accelleration, the careful diet, the rigorous\nhours of physical conditioning. It was only one experiment, one tiny\nstep in the work that could someday give men the stars, but to Gregory\nHunter at this moment it was everything.\n\n\"Good luck, then.\" The captain cut off, and the blastoff buzzer sounded.\n\nHe was off. His heart hammered in his throat, and his eyes ached\nfiercely, but he paid no attention. His finger crept to the air-speed\nindicator, then to the cut-off switch. When the pressure became too\ngreat, when he began to black out, he would press it.\n\nBut not yet. It was speed they wanted; they had to know how much\naccelleration a man could take for how long and still survive, and now\nit was up to him to show them.\n\nFleetingly, he thought of Tom ... poor old stick-in-the-mud Tom, working\naway in his grubby little Mars-bound laboratory, watching bacteria grow.\nTom could never have qualified for a job like this. Tom couldn't even go\ninto free-fall for ten minutes without getting sick all over the place.\nGreg felt a surge of pity for his brother, and then a twinge of\nmalicious anticipation. Wait until Tom heard the reports on _this_ run!\nIt was all right to spend your time poking around with bottles and test\ntubes if you couldn't do anything else, but it took something special to\npilot an XP ship for Project Star-Jump. And after this run was over,\neven Tom would have to admit it....\n\nThere was a lurch, and quite suddenly the enormous pressure was gone.\n\nSomething was wrong. He hadn't pushed the cut-off button, yet the ship's\nengines were suddenly silent. He jabbed at the power switch. Nothing\nhappened. Then the side-jets sputted, and he was slammed sideways into\nthe cot.\n\nHe snapped on the radio speaker. \"Control ... can you hear me?\nSomething's gone wrong out here....\"\n\n\"Nothing's wrong,\" the captain's voice said in his earphones. \"Just sit\ntight. I'm bringing you back in. There's a call here from Sun Lake City.\nThey want you down there in a hurry. We'll have to scratch you on this\nrun.\"\n\n\"_Who_ wants me down there?\"\n\n\"The U.N. Council office. Signed by Major Briarton himself and I can't\nargue with the Major. We're bringing you in.\"\n\nGreg Hunter sank back, disappointment so thick he could taste it in his\nmouth. Sun Lake City! That meant two days at least, one down, one back,\nmaybe more if connections weren't right. It meant that the captain would\nsend Morton or one of the others out in his place. It meant....\n\nSuddenly he thought of what else it meant, and a chill ran up his back.\n\nThere was only one reason Major Briarton would call him in like this.\nSomething had happened to Dad.\n\nGreg leaned back in the cot, suddenly tense, as a thousand frightful\npossibilities flooded his mind. It could only mean that Dad was in some\nkind of trouble.\n\nAnd if anything had happened to Dad....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe sun was sinking rapidly toward the horizon when the city finally\ncame into sight in the distance, but try as he would, Tom Hunter could\nnot urge more than thirty-five miles an hour from the huge lurching\nvehicle he was driving.\n\nOn an open paved highway the big pillow-wheeled Sloppy Joe would do\nsixty in a breeze, but this desert route was far from a paved road.\nInside the pressurized passenger cab, Tom gripped the shock-bars with\none arm and the other leg, and jammed the accelerator to the floor. The\nengine coughed, but thirty-five was all it would do.\n\nThrough the windshield Tom could see the endless rolling dunes of the\nMartian desert stretching to the horizon on every side. They called Mars\nthe Red Planet, but it was not red when you were close to it. There were\nmultitudes of colors here ... yellow, orange, brown, gray, occasional\npatches of gray-green ... all shifting and changing in the fading\nsunlight. Off to the right were the worn-down peaks of the Mesabi II,\none of the long, low mountain ranges of almost pure iron ore that helped\ngive the planet its dull red appearance from outer space. And behind\nhim, near the horizon, the tiny sun glowed orange out of a blue-black\nsky.\n\nTom fought the wheel as the Sloppy Joe jounced across a dry creek bed,\nand swore softly to himself. Why hadn't he kept his head and waited for\nthe mail ship that had been due at the Lab to give him a lift back? He'd\nhave been in Sun Lake City an hour ago ... but the urgency of the\nmessage had driven caution from his mind.\n\nA summons from the Mars Coordinator of the U.N. Interplanetary Council\nwas the same as an order ... but there was more to Tom's haste than\nthat. There was only one reason that Major Briarton would be calling him\nin to Sun Lake City, and that reason meant trouble.\n\nSomething was wrong. Something had happened to Dad.\n\nNow Tom peered up at the dark sky, squinting into the sun. Somewhere out\nthere between Mars and Jupiter was a no-man's-land of danger, a great\ncircling ring of space dirt and debris, the Asteroid belt. And somewhere\nout there, Dad was working.\n\nTom thought for a moment of the pitiful little mining rig that Roger\nHunter had taken out to the Belt ... the tiny orbit-ship to be used for\nheadquarters and storage of the ore; the even tinier scout ship, Pete\nRacely's old _Scavenger_ that he had sold to Roger Hunter for back taxes\nand repairs when he went broke in the Belt looking for his Big Strike.\nIt wasn't much of a mining rig for anybody to use, and the dangers of a\nsmall mining operation in the Asteroid Belt were frightening. It took\nskill to bring a little scout-ship in for a landing on an asteroid rock\nhardly bigger than the ship itself; it took even more skill to rig the\ncontrolled-Murexide charges to blast the rock into tiny fragments, and\nthen run out the shiny magnetic net to catch the explosion debris and\nbring it in to the hold of the orbit-ship....\n\nTom Hunter scowled, trying to shake off the feeling of uneasiness that\nwas nibbling at his mind. Asteroid mining was dangerous ... but Dad was\nno novice. Nobody on Mars knew how to handle a mining rig better than\nRoger Hunter did. He knew what he was doing out there, there was no real\ndanger for him or was there....\n\nRoger Hunter, a good man, a gentle and peaceful man, had finally seen\nall he could stomach of Jupiter Equilateral and its company mining\npolicies six months before. He had told them so in plain, simple\nlanguage when he turned in his resignation. They didn't try to stop\nhim ... a man was still free to quit a job on Mars if he wanted to, even\na job with Jupiter Equilateral. But it was an open secret that the big\nmining outfit had not liked Roger Hunter's way of resigning, taking half\na dozen of their first-rate mining engineers with him. There had been\nveiled threats, rumors of attempts to close the markets to Roger\nHunter's ore, in open violation of U.N. Council policies on Mars....\n\nTom fought the wheel as the big tractor lumbered up another rise, and\nthe huge plastic bubble of Sun Lake City came into view far down the\nvalley below.\n\nHe thought of Greg. Had Greg been summoned too? He closed his lips\ntightly as a wave of anger passed through his mind. If anything had\nhappened, no matter what, he thought, Greg would be there. Taking over\nand running things, as usual. He thought of the last time he had seen\nhis brother, and then deliberately blocked out the engulfing bitterness.\n\nThat had been more than a year ago. Maybe Greg had changed since then.\n\nBut somehow, Tom didn't think so.\n\nThe Sloppy Joe was on the valley floor now, and ahead the bubble\ncovering the city was drawing closer. The sun was almost gone; lights\nwere appearing inside the plastic shielding. Born and raised on Mars,\nTom had seen the teeming cities of Earth only once in his life ... but\nto him none of the splendors of the Earth cities could match the simple,\nquiet beauty of this Martian outpost settlement. There had been a time\nwhen people had said that Sun Lake City could never be built, that it\ncould never survive if it were, but with each successive year it grew\nlarger and stronger, the headquarters city for the planet that had\nbecome the new frontier of Earth.\n\nThe radiophone buzzed, and the airlock guard hailed him when he returned\nthe signal. Tom gave his routine ID. He guided the tractor into the\nlock, waited until pressure and atmosphere rose to normal, and then\nleaped out of the cab.\n\nFive minutes later he was walking across the lobby of the Interplanetary\nCouncil building, stepping into the down elevator. Three flights below\nhe stepped out into the office corridor of the U.N. Interplanetary\nCouncil on Mars.\n\nIf there was trouble, this was where he would find it.\n\nHe paused for a minute before the gray plastic door marked MAJOR FRANK\nBRIARTON in raised stainless steel letters. Then he pushed open the door\nand walked into the ante-room.\n\nIt was empty. Suddenly he felt a touch on his shoulder. Behind him, a\nfamiliar voice said, \"Hello, Twin.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt first glance they looked like carbon copies of each other, although\nthey were no more identical than identical twins ever are. Greg stood a\ngood two inches taller than Tom. His shoulders were broad, and there was\na small gray scar over one eye that stood out in contrast to the healthy\ntanned color of his face. Tom was of slighter build, and wirier, his\nskin much more pale.\n\nBut they had the same dark hair, the same gray eyes, the same square,\nstubborn line to the jaw. They looked at each other for a moment without\nspeaking. Then Greg grinned and clapped his brother on the shoulder.\n\n\"So you got here, finally,\" he said. \"I was beginning to think I'd have\nto go out on the desert and find you.\"\n\n\"Oh, I got here, all right,\" Tom said. \"I see you did too.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Greg said heavily. \"Can't argue with the major, you know.\"\n\n\"But what does he want?\"\n\n\"How should I know? All he said was to get down here fast. And now he\nisn't even here himself.\"\n\n\"Is Dad on Mars?\" Tom asked.\n\nGreg looked at him. \"I don't know.\"\n\n\"We could check the register.\"\n\n\"I already checked it. He has not logged in, but that doesn't mean\nanything.\"\n\n\"I suppose not,\" Tom said glumly.\n\nThey were silent for a moment. Then Greg said, \"Look, what are you\nworried about? Nothing could have happened to Dad. He's been mining the\nBelt for years.\"\n\n\"I know. I just wish he were here, that's all. If he's in some kind of\ntrouble....\"\n\n\"What kind of trouble? You're looking for spooks.\"\n\n\"Spooks like Jupiter Equilateral, maybe,\" Tom said. \"They could make\nplenty of trouble for Dad.\"\n\n\"With the U.N. in the driver's seat here? They wouldn't dare. Why do you\nthink the major rides them so hard with all the claim-filing\nregulations? He'd give his right arm for a chance to break that outfit\ninto pieces.\"\n\n\"I still wish somebody had gone out to the Belt with Dad,\" Tom said.\n\nJust then the door opened. The newcomer was a tall, gray-haired man with\nU.N. Council stripes on his lapel, and major's rockets on his shoulders.\n\"Sorry I'm late, boys,\" Major Briarton said. \"I'd hoped to be here when\nyou arrived. I'm sorry to pull you in here like this, but I'm afraid I\nhad no choice. When did you boys hear from your father last?\"\n\nThey looked at each other. \"I saw him six weeks ago,\" Tom said. \"Just\nbefore he left to go out to the Belt again.\"\n\n\"Nothing since then?\"\n\n\"Not a word.\"\n\nThe major chewed his lip. \"Greg?\"\n\n\"I had a note at Christmas, I think. But what....\"\n\n\"What did he say in the note?\"\n\n\"He said Merry Christmas and Happy New Year. Dad isn't much of a letter\nwriter.\"\n\n\"Nothing at all about what he was doing?\"\n\nGreg shook his head. \"Look, Major, if there's some sort of trouble....\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm afraid there's trouble,\" the major said. He looked up at them,\nand spread his hands helplessly. \"There isn't any easy way to tell you,\nbut you've got to know. There's been an accident, out in the Belt.\"\n\n\"Accident?\" Greg said.\n\n\"A very serious accident. A fuel tank exploded in the scooter your\nfather was riding back to the _Scavenger_. It must have been very\nsudden, and by the time help arrived....\" The major broke off, unable to\nfind words.\n\nFor a long moment there was utter silence in the room. Outside, an\nelevator was buzzing, and a typewriter clicked monotonously somewhere in\nthe building.\n\nThen Tom Hunter broke the silence. \"Who was it, Major?\" he said. \"Who\nkilled Dad? Tell us, or we'll find out!\"\n\n\n\n\n2. Jupiter Equilateral\n\n\nFor a moment, Major Briarton just stared at him. Then he was on his\nfeet, shaking his head as he came around the desk. \"Tom, use your head,\"\nhe said. \"It's as much of a shock to me as it is to you, but you can't\nafford to jump to false conclusions....\"\n\nTom Hunter looked up bitterly. \"He's dead, isn't he?\"\n\n\"Yes, he's dead. He must have died the instant of the explosion....\"\n\n\"You mean you don't know?\"\n\n\"I wasn't there at the time it happened, no.\"\n\n\"Then who was?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMajor Briarton spread his hands helplessly. \"Nobody was. Your father was\nalone. From what we could tell later, he'd left the _Scavenger_ to land\non one of his claims, using the ship's scooter for the landing. He was\non the way back to the _Scavenger_ when the rear tank exploded. There\nwasn't enough left of it to tell what went wrong ... but it was an\naccident, there was no evidence to suggest anything else.\"\n\nTom looked at him. \"You really believe that?\"\n\n\"I can only tell you what we found.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't believe it for a minute,\" Tom said angrily. \"How long\nhave you and Dad been friends? Twenty years? Twenty-five? Do you really\nthink Dad would have an accident with a mining rig?\"\n\n\"I know he was an expert engineer,\" the major said. \"But things can\nhappen that even an expert can't foresee, mining in the Belt.\"\n\n\"Things like a fuel tank exploding? Not to Dad, they would never happen.\nI don't care what anybody says....\"\n\n\"Easy, Tom,\" Greg said.\n\n\"Well, I won't take it easy. Dad was too careful for something like that\nto happen. If he had an accident, somebody _made_ it happen.\"\n\nGreg turned to the major. \"What was Dad doing out there?\"\n\n\"Mining.\"\n\n\"By himself? No crew at all?\"\n\n\"No, he was alone.\"\n\n\"I thought the regulations said there always had to be at least two men\nworking an asteroid claim.\"\n\n\"That's right. Your father had Johnny Coombs with him when he left Sun\nLake City. They signed out as a team ... and then Johnny came back to\nMars on the first shuttle ship.\"\n\n\"How come?\"\n\n\"Not even Johnny knows. Your father just sent him back, and there was\nnothing we could do about it then. The U.N. has no jurisdiction in the\nbelt, unless a major crime has been committed.\" Major Briarton shook his\nhead helplessly. \"If a man is determined to mine a claim all by himself\nout there, he can find a dozen different ways to wiggle out of the\nregulations.\"\n\n\"But Dad would never be that stupid,\" Greg said. \"If he was alone when\nit happened, who found him?\"\n\n\"A routine U.N. Patrol ship. When Roger failed to check in at the\nregular eight-hour signal, they went out to see what was wrong. But by\nthe time they reached him, it was too late to help.\"\n\n\"I just don't get it,\" Greg said. \"Dad had more sense than to try to\nmine out there all by himself.\"\n\n\"I know,\" the major said. \"I don't know the answer. I had the Patrol\nship go over the scene of the accident with a comb after they found what\nhad happened, but there was nothing there to find. It was an accident,\nand that's that.\"\n\n\"What about Jupiter Equilateral?\" Tom said hotly. \"Everybody knows they\nwere out to get Dad ... why don't you find out what _they_ were doing\nwhen it happened, bring them in for questioning....\"\n\n\"I can't do that, I haven't a scrap of evidence,\" the major said\nwearily.\n\n\"Why can't you? You're the Mars Coordinator, aren't you? You act like\nyou're scared of them.\"\n\nMajor Briarton's lips tightened angrily. \"All right, since you put it\nthat way ... I _am_ scared of them. They're big, and they're powerful.\nIf they had their way, there wouldn't be any United Nations control on\nMars, there wouldn't be _anybody_ to fight them and keep them in check.\nThere wouldn't be any independent miners out in the Belt, either,\nbecause they'd all be bought out or dead, and Earth would pay through\nthe nose for every ounce of metal that they got from the Asteroid Belt.\nThat company has been trying to drive the U.N. off Mars for thirty\nyears, and they've come so close to it that it scares me plenty.\" He\npushed his chair back sharply and rose to his feet. \"And that is\nexactly why I refuse to stir up a mess over this thing, unhappy as\nit is, without something more than suspicions and rumors to back me\nup ... because all Jupiter Equilateral needs is one big issue to make us\nlook like fools out here, and we're through.\"\n\nHe crossed the room to a wall cabinet, opened it, and pulled out a\nscarred aluminum box. \"We found this in the cabin of the _Scavenger_. I\nthought you boys might want it.\"\n\nThey both recognized it instantly ... the battered old spacer's pack\nthat Roger Hunter had used for as long as they could remember. It seemed\nto them, suddenly, as if a part of him had appeared here in the room\nwith them. Greg looked at the box and turned away. \"You open it,\" he\nsaid to Tom in a sick voice.\n\nThere was nothing much inside ... some clothing, a pipe and tobacco\npouch, a jack knife, half a dozen other items so familiar that Tom could\nhardly bear to touch them. At the bottom of the pack was the heavy\nleather gun case which had always held Roger Hunter's ancient .44\nrevolver. Tom dropped it back without even opening the flap. He closed\nthe box and took a deep breath. \"Then you really believe that it was an\naccident and nothing more?\" he said to the major.\n\nMajor Briarton shook his head. \"What I think or don't think doesn't make\nany difference. It just doesn't matter. In order to do anything, I've\ngot to have evidence, and there just isn't any evidence. I can't even\ntake a ship out there for a second look, with the evidence I have, and\nthat's all there is to it.\"\n\n\"But you think that maybe it wasn't an accident, just the same,\" Tom\npursued.\n\nThe major hesitated. Then he shook his head again. \"I'm sorry, but I've\ngot to stand on what I've said. And I think you'd better stand on it,\ntoo. There's nothing else to be done.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt should have been enough, but it wasn't. As Tom Hunter walked with his\nbrother down the broad Upper Ramp to the business section of Sun Lake\nCity, he could not shake off the feeling of helpless anger, the growing\nconviction that Roger Hunter's death involved something more than the\ntragic accident in space that Major Briarton had insisted it was.\n\n\"He didn't tell us everything he knew,\" Tom said fiercely. \"He didn't\nsay everything he wanted to say, either. He doesn't think it was an\naccident any more than I do.\"\n\n\"How do you know, are you a mind reader?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Well, Dad wasn't a superman, either. He was taking an awful risk,\ntrying to work a mining rig by himself, and he had a bad break. Why do\nyou have to have somebody to blame for it?\"\n\n\"Keep talking,\" Tom said. \"You'll convince yourself yet.\"\n\nGreg just jammed his hands in his pockets, and they walked in silence\nfor a moment.\n\nFor Tom and Greg Hunter, Sun Lake City had always been home. Now they\nwalked along the Main Concourse, Tom with the aluminum box under his\narm, Greg with his own spacer's pack thrown over his shoulder. They\ndidn't talk; rather than being drawn closer by the news of the tragedy,\nit seemed that they had drawn farther apart, as though the one common\nlink that had held them together had suddenly been broken.\n\nFinally Tom broke the silence. \"At least there's one thing we can do,\"\nhe said. \"I'm going to call Johnny Coombs.\"\n\nHe shortly found a phone booth and dialed a number. Johnny had been a\nfriend of the family for years; he and Roger Hunter had been partners in\nmany mining ventures in the Asteroid Belt before Roger had taken his\nposition with Jupiter Equilateral. If Johnny had any suspicions that\nRoger Hunter's accident had been more than an accident, he certainly\nwould not hesitate to voice them....\n\nAfter a dozen rings, Tom hung up, tried another number. There was no\nanswer there, either. Frowning, Tom rang the city's central paging\nsystem. \"Put in a personal call for Johnny Coombs,\" he said when the\n\"record\" signal flashed on. \"Tell him to contact the Hunters when he\ncomes in. We'll be at home....\"\n\nThey resumed their silent walk. When they reached H wing on the fourth\nlevel, they turned right down an apartment corridor, and stopped in\nfront of a familiar doorway. Tom pressed his palm against the\nlock-plate, and the door swung open.\n\nIt was home to them, the only home they had ever known. Soft lights\nsprang up on the walls of the apartment as the door opened. Tom saw the\nold bookcases lining the walls, the drafting-board and light at the far\nend of the room, the simple chairs and dining table, the door which led\ninto the bedroom and kitchen beyond. The room had the slightly\ndisheveled look that it had had ever since Mom had died ... a slipper on\nthe floor here, a book face down on the couch there....\n\nIt looked as though Dad had just stepped out for an hour or so.\n\nTom was three steps into the room before he saw the visitor.\n\nThe man was sitting comfortably in Roger Hunter's easy chair, a short,\nfat man with round pink cheeks that sagged a little and a double chin\nthat rested on his neck scarf. There were two other men in the room,\nboth large and broad-shouldered; one of them nodded to the fat man, and\nmoved to stand between the boys and the door.\n\nThe fat man was out of his seat before the boys could speak, smiling at\nthem and holding out his hand. \"I wanted to be sure to see you before\nyou left the city,\" he was saying, \"so we just came on in to wait. I\nhope you don't mind our ... butting in, so to speak.\" He chuckled,\nlooking from one twin to the other. \"You don't know me, I suppose. I'm\nMerrill Tawney. Representing Jupiter Equilateral, you know.\"\n\nTom took the card he was holding out, looked at the name and the tiny\ngold symbol in the corner, a letter \"J\" in the center of a triangle. He\nhanded the card to Greg. \"I've seen you before,\" he told the fat man.\n\"What do you want with us?\"\n\nTawney smiled again, spreading his hands. \"We've heard about the\ntragedy, of course. A shocking thing ... Roger was one of our group so\nrecently. We wanted you to know that if there is anything at all we can\ndo to help, we'd be only too glad....\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" Greg said. \"But we're doing just fine.\"\n\nTawney's smile tightened a little, but he hung onto it. \"I always felt\nclose to your father,\" he said. \"All of us at Jupiter Equilateral did.\nWe were all sorry to see him leave.\"\n\n\"I bet you were,\" Greg said, \"he was the best mining engineer you ever\nhad. But Dad could never stand liars, or crooked ways of doing\nbusiness.\"\n\nOne of the men started for Greg, but the fat man stopped him with a wave\nof his hand. \"We had our differences of opinion,\" he said. \"We saw\nthings one way, your father saw them another way. But he was a fine man,\none of the finest....\"\n\n\"Look, Mr. Tawney, you'd better say what you came to say and get out of\nhere,\" Greg said dangerously, \"before we give your friends here\nsomething to do.\"\n\n\"I merely came to offer you some help,\" Tawney said. He was no longer\nsmiling. \"Since your father's death, you two have acquired certain\nresponsibilities. I thought we might relieve you of some of them.\"\n\n\"What sort of responsibilities?\"\n\n\"You have an unmanned orbit-ship which is now a derelict in the Asteroid\nBelt. You have a scout-ship out there also. You can't just leave them\nthere as a navigation hazard to every ship traveling in the sector.\nThere are also a few mining claims which aren't going to be of much\nvalue to you now.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Greg said. \"Are you offering to buy Dad's mining rig?\"\n\n\"Well, I doubt very much that we'd have any use for it, as such. But we\ncould save you the trouble of going out there to haul it in.\"\n\n\"That's very thoughtful,\" Greg said. \"How much are you offering?\"\n\nTom looked up in alarm. \"Wait a minute,\" he said. \"That rig's not for\nsale....\"\n\n\"How much?\" Greg repeated.\n\n\"Forty thousand dollars,\" Merrill Tawney said. \"Ship, rig and claims.\nWe'll even pay the transfer tax.\"\n\nTom stared at the man, wondering if he had heard right. He knew what\nRoger Hunter had paid for the rig; he had been with Dad when the papers\nwere signed. Tawney's offer was three times as much as the rig was\nworth.\n\nBut Greg was shaking his head. \"I don't think we could sell at that\nprice.\"\n\nThe fat man's hands fluttered. \"You understand that those ships are\nhardly suited to a major mining operation like ours,\" he said, \"and the\nclaims....\" He dismissed them with a wave of his hand. \"Still, we'd want\nyou to be happy with the price. Say, forty-five thousand?\"\n\nGreg hesitated, shook his head again. \"I guess we'd better think it\nover, Mr. Tawney.\"\n\n\"Fifty thousand is absolutely the top,\" Tawney said sharply. \"I have the\npapers right here, drawn up for your signatures, but I'm afraid we can't\nhold the offer open.\"\n\n\"I don't know, we might want to do some mining ourselves,\" Greg said.\n\"For all we know, Dad might have struck some rich ore on one of those\nclaims.\"\n\nTawney laughed. \"I hardly think so. Those claims were all Jupiter\nEquilateral rejects. Our own engineers found nothing but low grade ore\non any of them.\"\n\n\"Still, it might be fun to look.\"\n\n\"It could be very expensive fun. Asteroid mining is a dangerous\nbusiness, even for experts. For amateurs....\" Tawney spread his hands.\n\"Accidents occur....\"\n\n\"Yes, we've heard about those accidents,\" Greg said coldly. \"I don't\nthink we're quite ready to sell, Mr. Tawney. We may never be ready to\nsell to you, so don't stop breathing until we call you. Now if there's\nnothing else, why don't you take your friends and go somewhere else?\"\n\nThe fat man scowled; he started to say something more, then saw the look\non Greg's face, and shrugged. \"I'd advise you to give it some careful\nthought,\" he said as he started for the door. \"It might be very foolish\nfor you to try to use that rig.\"\n\nSmiling, Greg closed the door in his face. Then he turned and winked at\nTom. \"Great fellow, Mr. Tawney. He almost had me sold.\"\n\n\"So I noticed,\" Tom said. \"For a while I thought you were serious.\"\n\n\"Well, we found out how high they'd go. That's a very generous outfit\nMr. Tawney works for.\"\n\n\"Or else a very crooked one,\" Tom said. \"Are you wondering the same\nthing I'm wondering?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Greg said slowly. \"I think I am.\"\n\n\"Then that makes three of us,\" a heavy voice rumbled from the bedroom\ndoor.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJohnny Coombs was a tall man, so thin he was almost gangling, with a\nlong nose and shaggy eyebrows jutting out over his eyes. With his rudely\ncropped hair and his huge hands, he looked like a caricature of a\nfrontier Mars-farmer, but the blue eyes under the eyebrows were not\ndull.\n\n\"Johnny!\" Tom cried. \"We were trying to find you.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Johnny said. \"So have a lot of other people, includin' your\nfriends there.\"\n\n\"Well, did you hear what Tawney wanted?\"\n\n\"I'm not so quick on my feet any more,\" Johnny Coombs said, \"but I got\nnothin' wrong with my ears.\" He scratched his jaw and looked up sharply\nat Greg. \"Not many people nowadays get a chance to bargain with Merrill\nTawney.\"\n\nGreg shrugged. \"He named a price and I didn't like it.\"\n\n\"Three times what the rig is worth,\" Coombs said.\n\n\"That's what I didn't like,\" Greg said. \"That outfit wouldn't give us a\nbreak like that just for old times' sake. Do you think they would?\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know,\" Johnny said slowly. \"Back before they built the\ncity here, they used to have rats getting into the grub. Came right down\noff the ships. Got rid of most of them, finally, but it seems to me\nwe've still got some around, even if they've got different shapes now.\"\nHe jerked his thumb toward the bedroom door. \"In case you're wondering,\nthat's why I was standin' back there all this time ... just to make sure\nyou didn't sell out to Tawney no matter what price he offered.\"\n\nTom jumped up excitedly. \"Then you know something about Dad's accident!\"\n\n\"No, I can't say I do. I wasn't there.\"\n\n\"Do you really think it was an accident?\"\n\n\"Can't prove it wasn't.\"\n\n\"But at least you've got some ideas,\" Tom said.\n\n\"Takes more than ideas to make a case,\" he said at length. \"But there's\none thing I do know. I've got no proof, not a shred of it, but I'm sure\nof one thing just as sure as I'm on Mars.\" He looked at the twins\nthoughtfully. \"Your dad wasn't just prospecting, out in the Belt. He'd\nrun onto something out there, something big.\"\n\nThe twins looked at him. \"Run onto something?\" Greg said. \"You mean....\"\n\n\"I mean I think your dad hit a Big Strike out there, rich metal, a real\nbonanza lode. Maybe the biggest strike that's ever been made,\" the miner\nsaid slowly. \"And then somebody got to him before he could bring it in.\"\n\n\n\n\n3. Too Many Warnings\n\n\nFor a moment, neither of the boys could say anything at all.\n\nFrom the time they had learned to talk, they had heard stories and tales\nthat the miners and prospectors told about the Big Strike, the pot of\ngold at the end of the rainbow, the wonderful, elusive goal of every man\nwho had ever taken a ship into the Asteroid Belt.\n\nFor almost a hundred and fifty years ... since the earliest days of\nspace exploration ... there had been miners prospecting in the\nAsteroids. Out there, beyond the orbit of Mars and inside the orbit of\nJupiter, were a hundred thousand ... maybe a hundred million, for all\nanybody knew ... chunks of rock, metal and debris, spinning in silent\norbit around the sun. Some few of the Asteroids were big enough to be\ncalled planets ... Ceres, five hundred miles in diameter; Juno, Vesta,\nPallas, half a dozen more. A few hundred others, ranging in size from\nten to a hundred miles in diameter, had been charted and followed in\ntheir orbits by the observatories, first from Earth's airless Moon, then\nfrom Mars. There were tens of thousands more that had never been\ncharted. Together they made up the Asteroid Belt, spread out in space\nlike a broad road around the sun, echoing the age-old call of the\nbonanza.\n\nFor there was wealth in the Asteroids ... wealth beyond a man's wildest\ndreams ... if only he could find it.\n\nEarth, with its depleted iron ranges, its exhausted tin and copper\nmines, and its burgeoning population, was hungry for metal. Earth needed\nsteel, tin, nickel, and zinc; more than anything, Earth needed\nruthenium, the rare-earth catalyst that made the huge solar energy\nconverters possible.\n\nMars was rich in the ores of these metals ... but the ores were buried\ndeep in the ground. The cost of mining them, and of lifting the heavy\nore from Mars' gravitational field and carrying it to Earth was\nprohibitive. Only the finest carbon steel, and the radioactive metals,\nsmelted and purified on Mars and transported to Earth, could be made\nprofitable.\n\nBut from the Asteroid Belt, it was a different story. There was no\ngravity to fight on the tiny asteroids. On these chunks of debris, the\nmetals lay close to the surface, easy to mine. Ships orbiting in the\nBelt could fill their holds with their precious metal cargoes and\ntransfer them in space to the interplanetary orbit-ships spinning back\ntoward Earth. It was hard work, and dangerous work; most of the ore was\nlow-grade, and brought little return. But always there was the lure of\nthe Big Strike, the lode of almost-pure metal that could bring a fortune\nback to the man who found it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA few such strikes had been made. Forty years before a single claim had\nbrought its owner seventeen million dollars in two years. A dozen other\nmen had stumbled onto fortunes in the Belt ... but such metal-rich\nfragments were grains of sand in a mighty river. For every man who found\none, a thousand others spent years looking and then perished in the\nfruitless search.\n\nAnd now Johnny Coombs was telling them that their father had been one of\nthat incredible few.\n\n\"You really think Dad hit a bonanza lode out there?\"\n\n\"That's what I said.\"\n\n\"Did you see it with your own eyes?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"You weren't even out there with him!\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then why are you so sure he found something?\"\n\n\"Because he told me so,\" Johnny Coombs said quietly.\n\nThe boys looked at each other. \"He actually _said_ he'd found a rich\nlode?\" Tom asked eagerly.\n\n\"Not exactly,\" Johnny said. \"Matter of fact, he never actually told me\n_what_ he'd found. He needed somebody to sign aboard the _Scavenger_\nwith him in order to get a clearance to blast off, but he never did plan\nto take me out there with him. 'I can't take you now, Johnny,' he told\nme. 'I've found something out there, but I've got to work it alone for a\nwhile.' I asked him what he'd found, and he just gave me that funny\nlittle grin of his and said, 'Never mind what it is, it's big enough for\nboth of us. You just keep your mouth shut, and you'll find out soon\nenough.' And then he wouldn't say another word until we were homing in\non the shuttle ship to drop me off.\"\n\nJohnny finished his coffee and pushed the cup aside. \"I knew he wasn't\njoking. He was excited, and I think he was scared, too. Just before I\nleft him, he said, 'There's one other thing, Johnny. Things might not\nwork out quite the way I figure them, and if they don't ... make sure\nthe twins know what I've told you.' I told him I would, and headed back.\nThat was the last I heard from him until the Patrol ship found him\nfloating in space with a torn-open suit and a ruined scooter floating a\nfew miles away.\"\n\n\"Do you think that Jupiter Equilateral knew Dad had found something?\"\nTom asked.\n\n\"Who knows? I'm sure that _he_ never told them, but it's awful hard to\nkeep a secret like that, and they sound awful eager to buy that rig,\"\nJohnny Coombs said.\n\n\"Yes, and it doesn't make sense. I mean, if they were responsible for\nDad's accident, why didn't they just check in for him on schedule and\nthen quietly bring in their rig to jump the claim?\"\n\n\"Maybe they couldn't find it,\" Johnny said. \"If they'd killed your dad,\nthey wouldn't have dared hang around very long right then. Even if\nthey'd kept the signal going, a Patrol ship might have come into the\nregion any time. And if a U.N. Patrol ship ever caught them working a\ndead man's claim without reporting the dead man, the suit would really\nstart to leak.\" Johnny shook his head. \"Remember, your Dad had a dozen\nclaims out there. They might have had to scout the whole works to find\nthe right one. Much easier to do it out in the open, with your\nsignatures on a claim transfer. But one thing is sure ... if they _knew_\nwhat Roger found out there, and where it was, Tawney would never be\noffering you triple price for the rig.\"\n\n\"Then whatever Dad found is still out there,\" Tom said.\n\n\"I'd bet my last dime on it.\"\n\n\"There might even be something to show that the accident wasn't an\naccident,\" Tom went on. \"Something even the Major would have to admit\nwas evidence.\"\n\nJohnny Coombs pursed his lips, looking up at Tom. \"Might be,\" he\nconceded.\n\n\"Well, what are we waiting for? We turned Tawney's offer down ... he\nmight be sending a crew out to jump the claim right now.\"\n\n\"If he hasn't already,\" Johnny said.\n\n\"Then we've got to get out there.\"\n\nJohnny turned to Greg. \"You could pilot us out and handle the\nnavigation, and as for Tom....\"\n\n\"As for Tom, he could get sick all over the place and keep us busy just\ntaking care of him,\" Greg said sourly. \"You and me, yes. Not Tom. You\ndon't know that boy in a spaceship.\"\n\nTom started to his feet, glaring at his brother. \"That's got nothing to\ndo with it....\"\n\n\"It's true, isn't it? You'd be a big help out there.\"\n\nJohnny looked at Tom. \"You always get sick in free fall?\"\n\n\"Look, let's be reasonable,\" Greg said. \"You'd just be in the way. There\nare plenty of things you could do right here, and Johnny and I could\nhandle the rig alone....\"\n\nTom faced his brother angrily. \"If you think I'm going to stay here and\nkeep myself company, you're crazy,\" he said. \"This is one show you're\nnot going to run, so just quit trying. If you go out there, I go.\"\n\nGreg shrugged. \"Okay, Twin. It's your stomach, not mine.\"\n\n\"Then let me worry about it.\"\n\n\"I hope,\" Johnny said, \"that that's the worst we have to worry about.\nLet's get started planning.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTime was the factor uppermost in their minds. They knew that even under\nthe best of conditions, it could take weeks to outfit and prepare for a\nrun out to the Belt. A ship had to be leased and fueled; there were\nsupplies to lay in. There was the problem of clearance to take care of,\nclaims to be verified and spotted, orbit coordinates to be computed and\nchecked ... a thousand details to be dealt with, anyone of which might\ndelay embarkation from an hour to a day or more.\n\nIt was not surprising that Tom and Greg were dubious when Johnny told\nthem they could be ready to clear ground in less than twenty-four hours.\nEven knowing that Merrill Tawney might already have a mining crew at\nwork on Roger Hunter's claims, they could not believe that the red tape\nof preparation and clearance could be cut away so swiftly.\n\nThey underestimated Johnny Coombs.\n\nSix hours after he left them, he was back with a signed lease giving\nthem the use of a scout-ship and fuel to take them out to the Belt and\nback again; the ship was in the Sun Lake City racks waiting for them\nwhenever they were ready.\n\n\"What kind of a ship?\" Greg wanted to know.\n\n\"A Class III Flying Dutchman with overhauled atomics and hydrazine\nside-jets,\" Johnny said, waving the transfer order. \"Think you can fly\nit?\"\n\nGreg whistled. \"Can I? I trained in a Dutchman ... just about the\nfastest scouter there is. What condition?\"\n\n\"Lousy ... but it's fueled, with six weeks' supplies in the hold, and it\ndoesn't cost us a cent. Courtesy of a friend. You'll have to check it\nover, but it'll do.\"\n\nThey inspected the ship, a weatherbeaten scouter that looked like a\nrelic of the '90's. Inside there were signs of many refittings and\noverhauls, but the atomics were well shielded, and it carried a\nsurprising chemical fuel auxiliary for the cabin size. Greg disappeared\ninto the engine room, and Tom and Johnny left him testing valves and\ncircuits while they headed down to the U.N. Registry office in the\ncontrol tower.\n\nOn the way Johnny outlined the remaining outfitting steps. Tom would be\nresponsible for getting the clearance permit through Registry; Johnny\nwould check out all supplies, and then contact the observatory for the\norbit coordinates of Roger Hunter's claims.\n\n\"I thought the orbits were mapped on the claim papers,\" Tom said. \"I\nmean, every time an asteroid is claimed, the orbit has to be\ncharted....\"\n\n\"That's right, but the orbit goes all the way around the sun. We know\nwhere the _Scavenger_ was when the Patrol ship found her ... but she's\nbeen travelling in orbit ever since. The observatory computer will\npinpoint her for us and chart a collision course so we can cut out and\nmeet her instead of trailing her for a week. Do you have the crew-papers\nGreg and I signed?\"\n\n\"Right here.\"\n\nThey were stepping off the ramp below the ship when a man loomed up out\nof the shadows. It was a miner Tom had never seen before. Johnny nodded\nas he approached. \"Any news, Jack?\"\n\n\"Quiet as a church,\" the man said.\n\n\"We'll be held up another eight hours at least,\" Johnny said. \"Don't go\nto sleep on us, Jack.\"\n\n\"Don't worry about us sleepin',\" the man said grimly. \"There's been\nnobody around but yourselves, so far ... except the clearance\ninspector.\"\n\nJohnny looked up sharply. \"You check his papers?\"\n\n\"_And_ his prints. He was all right.\"\n\nJohnny took Tom's arm, and they headed through the gate toward the\ncontrol tower. \"I guess I'm just naturally suspicious,\" he grinned, \"but\nI'd sure hate to have a broken cut-off switch, or a fuel valve go out of\nwhack at just the wrong moment.\"\n\n\"You think Tawney would dare to try something here?\" Tom said.\n\n\"Never hurts to check. We've got our hands full for a few hours getting\nset, so I just asked my friends to keep an eye on things. Always did say\nthat a man who's going to gamble is smart to cover his bets.\"\n\nAt the control tower they parted, and Tom walked into the clearance\noffice. Johnny's watch-man had startled him, and for the first time he\nfelt a chill of apprehension. If they were right ... if this trip to the\nBelt were not a wild goose chase from the very start ... then Roger\nHunter's accident had been no accident at all.\n\nQuite suddenly, Tom felt very thankful that Johnny Coombs had\nfriends....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I don't like it,\" the Major said, facing Tom and Greg across the desk\nin the U.N. Registry office below the control tower. \"You've gotten an\nidea in your heads, and you just won't listen to reason.\"\n\nSomewhere above them, Tom could hear the low-pitched rumble of a\nscout-ship blasting from its launching rack. \"All we want to do is go\nout and work Dad's claim,\" he said for the second time.\n\n\"I know perfectly well what you want to do, that's why I told the people\nhere to alert me if you tried to clear a ship. You don't know what\nyou're doing ... and I'm not going to sign those clearance papers.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" Greg said.\n\n\"Because you're going out there asking for trouble, that's why not.\"\n\n\"But you told us before that there wasn't any trouble. Dad had an\naccident, that was all. So how could we get in trouble?\"\n\nThe Major's face was an angry red. He started to say something, then\nstopped, and scowled at them instead. They met his stare. Finally he\nthrew up his hands. \"All right, so I can't legally stop you,\" he said.\n\"But at least I can beg you to use your heads. You're wasting time and\nmoney on a foolish idea. You're walking into dangers and risks that you\ncan't handle, and I hate to see it happen.\n\n\"Mining in the Belt is a job for experienced men, not rank novices.\"\n\n\"Johnny Coombs is no novice.\"\n\n\"No, but he's lost his wits, taking you two out there.\"\n\n\"Well, are there any other dangers you have in mind?\"\n\nOnce more the Major searched for words, and failed to find them. \"No,\"\nhe sighed, \"and you wouldn't listen if I did.\"\n\n\"It seems everybody is warning us about how dangerous this trip is\nlikely to be,\" Greg said quietly. \"Last night it was Merrill Tawney. He\noffered to buy us out, he was so eager for a deal that he offered us a\nfantastic price. Then Johnny tells us that Dad mined some rich ore when\nhe was out there on his last trip, but never got a chance to bring it in\nbecause of his ... accident. Up until now I haven't been so sure Dad\n_didn't_ just have an accident, but now I'm beginning to wonder. Too\nmany people have been warning us....\"\n\n\"You're determined to go out there, then?\"\n\n\"That's about right.\"\n\nThe Major picked up the clearance papers, glanced at them quickly,\nand signed them. \"All right, you're cleared. I hate to do it, but I\nsuppose I'd go with you if the law would let me. And I'll tell you one\nthing ... if you can find a single particle of evidence that will link\nJupiter Equilateral or anybody else to your father's death, I'll use all\nthe power I have to break them.\" He handed the papers back to Tom. \"But\nbe careful, because if Jupiter Equilateral is involved in it, they're\ngoing to play dirty.\"\n\nAt the door he turned. \"Good trip, and good luck.\"\n\nTom folded the papers and stuck them thoughtfully into his pocket.\n\nThey met Johnny Coombs in the Registry offices upstairs; Tom patted his\npocket happily. \"We're cleared in forty-five minutes,\" he said.\n\nJohnny grinned. \"Then we're all set.\" They headed up the ramp, reached\nground level, and started out toward the launching racks.\n\nAt the far end of the field a powerful Class I Ranger, one of the\nJupiter Equilateral scout fleet, was settling down into its slot in a\nperfect landing maneuver. The triangle-and-J-insignia gleamed brightly\non her dark hull. She was a rich, luxurious-looking ship. Many miners on\nMars could remember when Jupiter Equilateral had been nothing more than\na tiny mining company working claims in the remote \"equilateral\" cluster\nof asteroids far out in Jupiter's orbit. Gradually the company had grown\nand flourished, accumulating wealth and power as it grew, leaving behind\nit a thousand half-confirmed stories of cheating, piracy, murder and\ntheft. Other small mining outfits had fallen by the wayside until now\nover two-thirds of all asteroid mining claims were held by Jupiter\nEquilateral, and the small independent miners were forced more and more\nto take what was left.\n\nThey reached the gate to the Dutchman's launching slot and entered.\n\nInside the ship Tom and Johnny strapped down while Greg made his final\ncheck-down on the engines, gyros and wiring. The cabin was a tiny vault,\nwith none of the spacious \"living room\" of the orbit-ships. Tom leaned\nback in the accelleration cot, and listened to the count-down signals\nthat came at one minute intervals now. In the earphones he could hear\nthe sporadic chatter between Greg and the control tower. No hint that\nthis was anything but a routine blastoff....\n\nBut there was trouble ahead, Tom was certain of that. Everybody on Mars\nwas aware that Roger Hunter's sons were heading out to the Belt to pick\nup where he had left off. Greg had secured a leave of absence from\nProject Star-Jump ... unhappily granted, even though his part in their\nprogram had already been disrupted. Even they had heard the rumors that\nwere adrift....\n\nAnd if there was trouble now, they were on their own. The Asteroid Belt\nwas a wilderness, untracked and unexplored, and except for an almost\ninsignificant fraction, completely unknown. If there was trouble out\nthere, there would be no one to help.\n\nSomewhere below the engines roared, and Tom felt the weight on his\nchest, sudden and breath-taking.\n\nThey were on their way.\n\n\n\n\n4. \"Between Mars and Jupiter....\"\n\n\nAfter all the tension of preparing for it, the trip out seemed\ninterminable.\n\nThey were all impatient to reach their destination. During blastoff and\naccelleration they had watched Mars dwindle to a tiny red dot; then time\nseemed to stop altogether, and there was nothing to do but wait.\n\nFor the first eight hours of free fall, after the engines had cut out,\nTom was violently ill. He fought it desperately, gulping the pills\nJohnny offered and trying to keep them down. Gradually the waves of\nnausea subsided, but it was a full twenty-four hours before Tom felt\nlike stirring from his cot to take up the shipboard routine.\n\nAnd then there was nothing for him to do. Greg handled the navigation\nskilfully, while Johnny kept radio contact and busied himself in the\nstoreroom, so Tom spent hours at the viewscreen. On the second day he\nspotted a tiny chunk of rock that was unquestionably an asteroid moving\nswiftly toward them. It passed at a tangent ten thousand miles ahead of\nthem, and Greg started work at the computer, feeding in the data tapes\nthat would ultimately guide the ship to its goal.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPinpointing a given spot in the Asteroid Belt was a gargantuan task,\nvirtually impossible without the aid of the ship's computer to compute\norbits, speeds, and distances. Tom spent more and more time at the\nviewscreen, searching the blackness of space for more asteroid\nsightings. But except for an occasional tiny bit of debris hurtling by,\nhe saw nothing but the changeless panorama of stars.\n\nJohnny Coombs found him there on the third day, and laughed at his sour\nexpression. \"Gettin' impatient?\"\n\n\"Just wondering when we'll reach the Belt, is all,\" Tom said.\n\nJohnny chuckled. \"Hope you're not holdin' your breath. We've already\nbeen _in_ the Belt for the last forty-eight hours.\"\n\n\"Then where are all the asteroids?\" Tom said.\n\n\"Oh, they're here. You just won't see many of them. People always think\nthere ought to be dozens of them around, like sheep on a hillside, but\nit just doesn't work that way.\" Johnny peered at the screen. \"Of course,\nto an astronomer the Belt is just loaded ... hundreds of thousands of\nchunks, all sizes from five hundred miles in diameter on down. But\nactually, those chunks are all tens of thousands of miles apart, and the\nBelt _looks_ just as empty as the space between Mars and Earth.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't see how we're ever going to find one particular rock,\"\nTom said, watching the screen gloomily.\n\n\"It's not too hard. Every asteroid has its own orbit around the sun, and\neveryone that's been registered as a claim has the orbit charted. The\none we want isn't where it was when your Dad's body was found ... it's\nbeen travelling in its orbit ever since. But by figuring in the fourth\ndimension, we can locate it.\"\n\nTom blinked. \"Fourth dimension?\"\n\n\"Time,\" Johnny Coombs said. \"If we just used the three linear\ndimensions ... length, width and depth ... we'd end up at the place where\nthe asteroid _was_, but that wouldn't help us much because it's been\nmoving in orbit ever since the Patrol Ship last pinpointed it. So we\nfigure in a fourth dimension ... the time that's passed since it was last\nspotted ... and we can chart a collision course with it, figure out just\nwhere _we'll_ have to be to meet it.\"\n\nIt was the first time that the idea of time as a \"dimension\" had ever\nmade sense to Tom. They talked some more, until Johnny started bringing\nin fifth and sixth dimensions, and problems of irrational space and\nhyperspace, and got even himself confused.\n\n\"Anyway,\" Tom said, \"I'm glad we've got a computer aboard.\"\n\n\"And a navigator,\" Johnny added. \"Don't sell your brother short.\"\n\n\"Fat chance of that. Greg would never stand for it.\"\n\nJohnny frowned. \"You lads don't like each other very much, do you?\" he\nsaid.\n\nTom was silent for a moment. Then he looked away. \"We get along, I\nguess.\"\n\n\"Maybe. But sometimes just gettin' along isn't enough. Especially when\nthere's trouble. Give it a thought, when you've got a minute or two....\"\n\nLater, the three of them went over the computer results together. Johnny\nand Greg fed the navigation data into the ship's drive mechanism,\nchecking and rechecking speeds and inclination angles. Already the\nDutchman's orbital speed was matching the speed of Roger Hunter's\nasteroid ... but the orbit had to be tracked so that they would arrive\nat the exact point in space to make contact. Tom was assigned to the\nviewscreen, and the long wait began.\n\nHe spotted their destination point an hour before the computer had\npredicted contact ... at first a tiny pinpoint of reflected light in the\nscope, gradually resolving into two pinpoints, then three in a tiny\ncluster. Greg cut in the rear and lateral jets momentarily, stabilizing\ntheir contact course; the dots grew larger.\n\nTen minutes later, Tom could see their goal clearly in the\nviewscreen ... the place where Roger Hunter had died.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was neither large nor small for an asteroid, an irregular chunk of\nrock and metal, perhaps five miles in diameter, lighted only by the dull\nreddish glow from the dime-sized sun. Like many such jagged chunks of\ndebris that sprinkled the Belt, this asteroid did not spin on any axis,\nbut constantly presented the same face to the sun.\n\nJust off the bright side the orbit-ship floated, stable in its orbit\nnext to the big rock, but so small in comparison that it looked like a\ntiny glittering toy balloon. And clamped on its rack on the orbit-ship's\nside, airlock to airlock, was the _Scavenger_, the little scout ship\nthat Roger Hunter had brought out from Mars on his last journey.\n\nWhile Greg maneuvered the Dutchman into the empty landing rack below the\n_Scavenger_ on the hull of the orbit-ship, Johnny scanned the blackness\naround them through the viewscope, a frown wrinkling his forehead.\n\n\"Do you see anybody?\" Tom asked.\n\n\"Not a sign ... but I'm really looking for other rocks. I can see three\nthat aren't too far away, but none of them have claim marks. This one\nmust have been the only one Roger was working.\"\n\nThey stared at the ragged surface of the planetoid. Raw veins of\nmetallic ore cut through it with streaks of color, but most of the\nsun-side showed only the dull gray of iron and granite. There was\nnothing unusual about the surface that Tom could see. \"Could there be\nanything on the dark side?\"\n\n\"Could be,\" Johnny said. \"We'll have to go over it foot by foot ... but\nfirst, we should go through the orbit-ship and the _Scavenger_. If the\nPatrol ship missed anything, we want to know it.\"\n\nThe interior of the orbit-ship was dark. It spun slowly on its axis,\ngiving them just enough weight so they would not float free whenever\nthey moved. Their boots clanged on the metal decks as they climbed up\nthe curving corridor toward the control cabin.\n\nThen Johnny threw a light switch, and they stared around them in\namazement.\n\nThe cabin was a shambles. Everything that was not bolted down had been\nripped open and thrown aside.\n\nGreg whistled through his teeth. \"The Major said the Patrol crew had\ngone through the ship ... but he didn't say they'd wrecked it.\"\n\n\"They didn't,\" Johnny said grimly. \"No Patrol ship would ever do this.\nSomebody else has been here since.\" He turned to the control panel,\nflipped switches, checked gauges. \"Hydroponics are all right. Atmosphere\nis still good; we can take off these helmets. Fuel looks all right,\nstorage holds ...\" He shook his head. \"They weren't looting, but they\nwere looking for something, all right. Let's look around and see if they\nmissed anything.\"\n\nIt took them an hour to survey the wreckage. Not a compartment had been\nmissed. Even the mattresses on the accelleration cots had been torn\nopen, the spring-stuffing tossed about helter-skelter. Tom went through\nthe lock into the _Scavenger_; the scout ship too had been searched,\nrapidly but thoroughly.\n\nBut there was no sign of anything that Roger Hunter might have found.\n\nBack in the control cabin Johnny was checking the ship's log. The old\nentries were on microfilm, stored on their spools near the reader. More\nrecent entries were still recorded on tape. From the jumbled order,\nthere was no doubt that marauders had examined them. Johnny ran through\nthem nevertheless, but there was nothing of interest. Routine\nnavigational data; a record of the time of contact with the asteroid; a\nlog of preliminary observations on the rock; nothing more. The last tape\nrecorded the call-schedule Roger Hunter had set up with the Patrol, a\nroutine precaution used by all miners, to bring help if for some reason\nthey should fail to check in on schedule.\n\nThere was no hint in the log of any extraordinary discovery.\n\n\"Are any tapes missing?\" Greg wanted to know.\n\n\"Doesn't look like it. There's one here for each day-period.\"\n\n\"I wonder,\" Tom said. \"Dad always kept a personal log. You know, a sort\nof a diary, on microfilm.\" He peered into the film storage bin, checked\nthrough the spools. Then, from down beneath the last row of spools he\npulled out a slightly smaller spool. \"Here's something our friends\nmissed, I bet.\"\n\nIt was not really a diary, just a sequence of notes, calculations and\nideas that Roger Hunter had jotted down and microfilmed from time to\ntime. The entries on the one spool went back for several years. Tom fed\nthe spool into the reader, and they stared eagerly at the last few\nentries.\n\nA series of calculations, covering several pages, but with no notes to\nindicate what, exactly, Roger Hunter had been calculating. \"Looks like\nhe was plotting an orbit,\" Greg said. \"But what orbit? And why? Nothing\nhere to tell.\"\n\n\"It must have been important, though, or Dad wouldn't have filmed the\npages,\" Tom said. \"Anything else?\"\n\nAnother sheet with more calculations. Then a short paragraph written in\nRoger Hunter's hurried scrawl. \"No doubt now what it is,\" the words\nsaid. \"Wish Johnny were here, show him a _real_ bonanza, but he'll know\nsoon enough if....\"\n\nThey stared at the scribbled, uncompleted sentence. Then Johnny Coombs\nlet out a whoop. \"I told you he found something! And he found it _here_,\nnot somewhere else.\"\n\n\"Hold it,\" Greg said, peering at the film reader. \"There's something\nmore on the last page, but I can't read it.\"\n\nTom blinked at the entry. \"'Inter Jovem et Martem planetam interposui,'\"\nhe read. He scratched his head. \"That's Latin, and it's famous, too.\nKepler wrote it, back before the asteroids were discovered. 'Between\nJupiter and Mars I will put a planet.'\"\n\nGreg and Johnny looked at each other. \"I don't get it,\" Greg said.\n\n\"Dad told me about that once,\" Tom said. \"Kepler couldn't understand\nthe long jump between Mars and Jupiter, when Venus and Earth and Mars\nwere so close together. He figured there ought to be a planet out\nhere ... and he was right, in a way. There wasn't any one planet, unless\nyou'd call Ceres a planet, but it wasn't just empty space between Mars\nand Jupiter either. The asteroids were here.\"\n\n\"But why would Dad be writing that down?\" Greg asked. \"And what has it\ngot to do with what he found out here?\" He snapped off the reader switch\nangrily. \"I don't understand any of this, and I don't like it. If Dad\nfound something out here, where is it? And who tore this ship apart\nafter the Patrol ship left?\"\n\n\"Probably the same ones that caused the 'accident' in the first place,\"\nJohnny said.\n\n\"But why did they come back?\" Greg protested. \"If they killed Dad, they\nmust have known what he'd found before they killed him.\"\n\n\"You'd think so,\" Johnny conceded.\n\n\"Then why take the risk of coming back here again?\"\n\n\"Maybe they _didn't_ know,\" Tom said thoughtfully.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean maybe they killed him too soon. Maybe they thought they knew\nwhat he'd found and where it was ... and then found out that they\ndidn't, after all. Maybe Dad hid it....\"\n\nJohnny Coombs shook his head. \"No way a man can hide an ore strike.\"\n\n\"But suppose Dad did, somehow, and whoever killed him couldn't find it?\nIt would be too late to make him tell them. They'd _have_ to come back\nand look again, wouldn't they? And from the way they went about it, it\nlooks as though they weren't having much luck.\"\n\n\"Then whatever Dad found would still be here, somewhere,\" Greg said.\n\n\"That's right.\"\n\n\"But where? There's nothing on this ship.\"\n\n\"Maybe not,\" Tom said, \"but I'd like to take a look at that asteroid\nbefore we give up.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey paused in the big ore-loading lock to reclamp their pressure\nsuit helmets, and looked down at the jagged chunk of rock a hundred\nyards below them. In the lock they had found scooters ... the little\none-man propulsion units so commonly used for short distance work in\nspace ... but decided not to use them. \"They're clumsy,\" Johnny said,\n\"and the bumper units in your suits will do just as well for this\ndistance.\" He looked down at the rock. \"I'll take the center section.\nYou each take an edge and work in. Look for any signs of work on the\nsurface ... chisel marks, Murexide charges, anything.\"\n\n\"What about the dark side?\" Greg asked.\n\n\"If we want to see anything there, we'll either have to rig up lights or\nturn the rock around,\" Johnny said. \"Let's cover this side first and see\nwhat we come up with.\"\n\nHe turned and leaped from the airlock, moving gracefully down toward\nthe surface, using the bumper unit to guide himself with short bursts\nof compressed CO_{2}, from the nozzle. Greg followed, pushing off\nharder and passing Johnny halfway down. Tom hesitated. It looked easy\nenough ... but he remembered the violent nausea of his first few hours\nof free fall.\n\nFinally he gritted his teeth and jumped off after Greg. Instantly he\nknew that he had jumped too hard. He shot away from the orbit-ship like\na bullet; the jagged asteroid surface leaped up at him. Frantically he\ngrabbed for the bumper nozzle and pulled the trigger, trying to break\nhis fall.\n\nHe felt the nozzle jerk in his hand, and then, abruptly, he was spinning\noff at a wild tangent from the asteroid, head over heels. For a moment\nit seemed that asteroid, orbit-ship and stars were all wheeling crazily\naround him. Then he realized what had happened. He fired the bumper\nagain, and went spinning twice as fast. The third time he timed the\nblast, aiming the nozzle carefully, and the spinning almost stopped.\n\nHe fought down nausea, trying to get his bearings. He was three hundred\nyards out from the asteroid, almost twice as far from the orbit-ship. He\nstared down at the rock as he moved slowly away from it. Before, from\nthe orbit-ship, he had been able to see only the bright side of the huge\nrock; now he could see the sharp line of darkness across one side.\n\nBut there was something else....\n\nHe fired the bumper again to steady himself, peering into the blackness\nbeyond the light-line on the rock. He snapped on his helmet lamp, aimed\nthe spotlight beam down to the dark rock surface. Greg and Johnny were\nlanding now on the bright side, with Greg almost out of sight over the\n\"horizon\" ... but Tom's attention was focussed on something he could see\nonly now as he moved away from the asteroid surface.\n\nHis spotlight caught it ... something bright and metallic, completely\nhidden on the dark side, lying in close to the surface but not quite on\nthe surface. Then suddenly Tom knew what it was ... the braking jets of\na Class I Ranger, crouching beyond the reach of sunlight in the shadow\nof the asteroid....\n\nSwiftly he fired the bumper again, turning back toward the orbit-ship.\nHis hand went to the speaker-switch, but he caught himself in time. Any\nwarning shouted to Greg and Johnny would certainly be picked up by the\nship. But he had to give warning somehow.\n\nHe tumbled into the airlock, searching for a flare in his web belt. It\nwas a risk ... the Ranger ship might pick up the flash ... but he had to\ntake it. He was unscrewing the fuse cap from the flare when he saw Greg\nand Johnny leap up from the asteroid surface.\n\nThen he saw what had alarmed them. Slowly, the Ranger was moving out\nfrom its hiding place behind the rock. Tom reached out to catch Greg as\nhe came plummeting into the lock. There was a flash from the Ranger's\nside, and Johnny Coombs' voice boomed in his earphones: \"Get inside! Get\nthe lock closed, fast ... hurry up, can't waste a second.\"\n\nJohnny caught the lip of the lock, dragged himself inside frantically.\nThey were spinning the airlock door closed when they heard the\nthundering explosion, felt the ship lurch under their feet, and all\nthree of them went crashing to the deck.\n\n\n\n\n5. The Black Raider\n\n\nFor a stunned moment they were helpless as they struggled to pick\nthemselves up. The stable airlock deck was suddenly no longer\nstable ... it was lurching back and forth like a rowboat on a heavy sea,\nand they grabbed the shock-bars along the bulkheads to steady themselves.\n\"What happened?\" Greg yelped. \"I saw a ship....\"\n\nAs if in answer there was another crash belowdecks, and the lurching\nbecame worse. \"They're firing on us, that's what happened,\" Johnny\nCoombs growled.\n\n\"Well, they're shaking us loose at the seams,\" Greg said. \"We've got to\nget this crate out of here.\" He reached for his helmet, began unsnapping\nhis pressure suit.\n\n\"Leave it on,\" Johnny snapped.\n\n\"But we can't move fast enough in these things....\"\n\n\"Leave it on all the same. If they split the hull open, you'll be dead\nin ten seconds without a suit.\"\n\nSomewhere below they heard the steady _clang-clang-clang_ of the\nemergency-station's bell ... already one of the compartments somewhere\nhad been breached, and was pouring its air out into the vacuum of space.\n\"But what can we do?\" Greg said. \"They could tear us apart!\"\n\n\"First, we see what they've already done,\" Johnny said, spinning the\nwheel on the inner lock. \"If they plan to tear us apart, we're done for,\nbut they may want to try to board us.... We'll wait and see.\"\n\nAn orbit-ship under fire was completely vulnerable. One well-placed\nshell could rip it open like a balloon.\n\nTom and Greg followed Johnny to where the control cabin was located. In\ncontrol they found alarm lights flashing in three places on the\ninstrument panel. Another muffled crash roared through the ship, and a\nnew row of lights sprang on along the panel.\n\n\"How are the engines?\" Greg said, staring at the flickering lights.\n\n\"Can't tell. Looks like they're firing at the main jets, but they've\nripped open three storage holds, too. They're trying to disable us....\"\n\n\"What about the _Scavenger_?\"\n\nJohnny checked a gauge. \"The airlock compartment is all right, so the\nscout ships haven't been touched. They couldn't fire on them without\nsplitting the whole ship down the middle.\" Johnny leaned forward,\nflipped on the viewscreen, and an image came into focus.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was a Class I Ranger, and there was no doubt of its origin. Like the\none they had seen berthing at the Sun Lake City racks, this ship had a\nglossy black hull, with the golden triangle-and-J insignia standing out\nin sharp relief in the dim sunlight.\n\n\"It's our friends, all right,\" Johnny said.\n\n\"But what are they trying to do?\" Tom said.\n\nEven as they watched, a pair of scooters broke from the side of the\nRanger and slid down toward the sun side of the asteroid. \"I don't\nknow,\" Johnny said. \"I think they intended to stay hidden, until Tom\nlost control of his bumper, and got far enough around there to spot\nthem.\" He frowned as the first scooter touched down on the asteroid\nsurface.\n\n\"Can't we fire on them?\" Greg said angrily.\n\n\"Not the way this tub is lurching around. They've got our main gyros,\nand the auxilliaries aren't powerful enough to steady us. Another blast\nor two could send us spinning like a top, and we'd have nothing to\nstabilize us....\"\n\nThere was another flash from the Ranger's hull, and the ship jerked\nunder their feet. \"Well, we're a sitting duck here,\" Greg said. \"Maybe\nthose engines will still work.\" He slid into the control seat, flipped\nthe drive switches to fire the side jets in opposite pairs. They fired,\nsteadying the lurching of the ship somewhat, but there was no response\nfrom the main engines. \"No good. We couldn't begin to run from them.\nWe're stuck here.\"\n\n\"They could outrun us anyway,\" Tom said, watching the viewscreen. \"And\nthey're moving in closer now.\"\n\n\"They're going to board us,\" Tom said.\n\nJohnny nodded, his eyes suddenly bright. \"I think you're right. And if\nthey do, we may have a chance. But we've got to split up.... Greg, you\ntake the control cabin here, try to keep them out if you can. Tom can\ncover the main corridor to the storage holds, and I'll take the engine\nroom section. That will sew up the entrances to control, here, and give\nus a chance to stop them.\"\n\n\"They may have a dozen men,\" Tom said. \"They could just shoot us down.\"\n\n\"I don't think so,\" Johnny said. \"They want _us_, not the ship, or they\nwouldn't bother to board us. We may not be able to hold them off, but we\ncan try.\"\n\n\"What about making a run for it in the _Scavenger_?\" Greg said.\n\nJohnny chuckled grimly. \"It'd be a mighty short run. That Ranger's got\nhoming shells that could blow the _Scavenger_ to splinters if we tried\nit. Our best bet is to put up such a brawl that they think twice about\ntaking us.\"\n\nThey parted in the corridor outside control, Johnny heading down for the\nengine room corridors, while Tom ran up toward the main outer-shell\ncorridor, a Markheim stunner in his hand. The entire outer shell of the\nship was storage space, each compartment separately sealed and connected\nwith the two main corridors that circled the ship. On each side these\ncorridors came together to join the short entry corridors from the\nscout-ship airlocks.\n\nTom knew that the only way the ship could be boarded was through those\nlocks; a man stationed at the place where the main corridors joined\ncould block any entry from the locks ... as long as he could hold his\nposition. Tom reached the junction of the corridors, and crouched close\nto the wall. By peering around the corner, he had a good view of the\nairlock corridor.\n\nTom gripped the Markheim tightly, and he dialed it down to a narrow\nbeam. Nobody had ever been killed by a stunner ... but a direct hit with\na narrow beam could paralyze a man for three days.\n\nThere was movement at the far end of the airlock corridor. A helmeted\nhead peered around the turn in the corridor; then two men in pressure\nsuits moved into view, walking cautiously, weapons in hand. Tom shrank\nback against the wall, certain they had not seen him. He waited until\nthey were almost to the junction with the main corridor; then he took\naim and pressed the trigger stud on his Markheim. There was an ugly\nripping sound as the gun jerked in his hand. The two men dropped as\nthough they had been pole-axed.\n\nA shout, a scrape of metal against metal, and a shot ripped back at him\nfrom the end of the corridor. Tom jerked back fast, but not quite fast\nenough. He felt a sledge-hammer blow on his shoulder, felt his arm jerk\nin a cramping spasm while the corridor echoed the low rumble of\nsub-sonics. He flexed his arm to work out the spasm ... they were using\na wide beam, hardly strong enough to stun a man. His heart pounded. They\nwere being careful, very careful....\n\nTwo more men rounded the bend in the corridor. Tom fired, but they hit\nthe deck fast, and the beam missed. The first one jerked to his feet,\ncharged up the corridor toward him, dodging and sliding. Tom followed\nhim in his sights, fired three times as the Markheim heated up in his\nhand. The beam hit the man's leg, dumping him to the deck, and bounced\noff to catch the second one.\n\nBut now there was another sound, coming from the corridor behind him.\nVoices, shouts, clanging of boots. He pressed against the wall,\nlistening. The sounds were from below. They must have gotten past\nJohnny ... probably the men on the scooters. Tom looked around\nhelplessly. If they came up behind him, he was trapped in a crossfire.\nBut if he left his position, more men could come in through the airlock.\nEven now two more came around the bend, starting up the corridor for\nhim....\n\nQuite suddenly, the lights went out.\n\nThe men stopped. Sound stopped. The corridor was pitch black. Tom fired\nwildly down the corridor, heard shouts and oaths from the men, but he\ncould see nothing. Then, ahead, a flicker of light as a headlamp went\non. The men from the airlock were close, moving in on him, and from\nbehind he saw light bouncing off the corridor walls....\n\nHe jerked open the hatch to a storage hold, ducked inside, and slammed\nthe hatch behind him. He pressed against the wall, panting.\n\nHe waited.\n\nSuddenly an idea flickered in Tom's mind.\n\nIt was a chance ... a long chance ... but it was something. If they were\ngoing to be captured in spite of anything they could do, even a long\nchance would be worth trying....\n\nHe waited in the darkness, tried to think it through. It was a wild\nidea, an utterly impossible idea, he had never heard of it being tried\nbefore ... but _any_ chance was better than none. He remembered what\nJohnny had said in the control cabin. The Ranger ship would have homing\nshells. An attempt to make a run with the _Scavenger_ might be\ndisastrous.\n\nHe thought about it, trying to reason it out. The Jupiter Equilateral\nmen obviously wanted them alive. They did not dare to kill Roger\nHunter's sons, because Roger Hunter might have told them where the\nbonanza was. And Jupiter Equilateral would not dare let anyone of them\nbreak away. If one of them got back to Mars, the whole U.N. Patrol would\nbe out in the Belt....\n\nThe plan became clear in his mind, but he had to let Greg know. He\nfingered the control of his helmet radio. The boarding party would have\na snooper, but if he was quick, they wouldn't have time to nail him. He\nbuzzed an attention code. \"Greg? Can you hear me?\"\n\nSilence. He buzzed again, and waited. What was wrong? Had they already\nbroken through to the control cabin and taken Greg? He buzzed again.\n\"Greg! Sound off if you can hear me.\"\n\nMore silence. Then a click. \"Tom?\"\n\n\"Here. Are you all right?\"\n\n\"So far. You?\"\n\n\"They got past me, but they didn't hit me. How's Johnny?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Greg said. \"I think he's been hurt. Tom, you'd better\nget off, they'll have snoopers....\"\n\n\"All right, listen,\" Tom said. \"How does it look to you?\"\n\n\"Bad. We're outnumbered, they'll be through to here any minute.\"\n\n\"All right, I've got an idea. It's risky, but it might let us pull\nsomething out of this mess. I'll need some time, though.\"\n\n\"How much?\"\n\n\"Ten, fifteen minutes.\"\n\nThere was an edge to Greg's voice. \"What are you planning?\"\n\n\"I can't tell you, they're listening in. But if it works....\"\n\n\"Look, don't do anything stupid.\"\n\n\"I can't hear you,\" Tom said. \"You try to hold them for fifteen\nminutes ... and don't worry. Take care of yourself.\"\n\nTom snapped off the speaker and moved to the hatchway. The corridor was\nempty, and pitch black. He started down toward the airlock, then stopped\nshort at the sound of voices and the flicker of headlamps up ahead.\n\nHe crouched back, but the lights were not moving. Guards at the lock,\nmaking certain that nobody tried to board their own ship. Tom grinned to\nhimself. They weren't missing any bets, he thought.\n\nExcept one. There was one bet they wouldn't even think of.\n\nHe backtracked to the storage hold, crossed through it, and out into the\nfar corridor. He followed the gentle curve of the deck a quarter of the\nway around the ship. Twice along the way he stumbled in the darkness,\nbut saw no sign of the raiders. At last he reached the far side, and the\ncorridor leading to No. 2 airlock. Again he could see the lamps of the\nguards around the bend; they were stationed directly inside their own\nlock.\n\nInching forward, he peered into blackness. Each step made a muffled\nclang on the deck plates. He edged his boots along as quietly as\npossible, reaching along the wall with his hand until he felt the lip of\na hatchway.\n\nThe lights and voices seemed nearer now. In the dim reflected light he\nsaw the sign on the door of the hatchway:\n\n     No. 2 Airlock\n     BE SURE PRESSURE GAUGE IS AT ZERO BEFORE OPENING HATCH\n\nHe checked the gauge, silently spun the wheel. There was a _ping_ as the\nseals broke. He pulled the hatch open just enough to squeeze into the\nlock, then closed it behind him. Then he switched on the pumps, waiting\nimpatiently until the red \"all clear\" signal flashed on. Then he opened\nthe outside lock.\n\nJust beyond, he could see the sleek silvery lines of the _Scavenger_.\n\nIt was their only chance.\n\nHe took a deep breath, and jumped across the gap to the open lock of the\n_Scavenger_.\n\n\n\n\n6. The Last Run of the Scavenger\n\n\nTo Greg Hunter the siege of the orbit-ship had been a nerve-wracking\ngame of listening and waiting for something to happen.\n\nIn the darkness of the control cabin he stretched his fingers, cramped\nfrom gripping the heavy Markheim stunner, and checked the corridor\noutside again. There was no sound in the darkness there, no sign of\nmovement. Somewhere far below he heard metal banging on metal; minutes\nbefore he thought he had heard the sharp ripping sound of a stunner\nblast overhead, but he wasn't sure. Wherever the fighting was going on,\nit was not here.\n\nHe shook his head as his uneasiness mounted. Why hadn't Johnny come\nback? He'd gone off to try and disable the Ranger ship leaving Greg to\nguard the control cabin. Why no sign of the marauders in the control\ncabin corridor? This should have been the first place they would head\nfor, if they planned to take the ship, but there had been nothing but\nsilence and darkness. Johnny had been gone near 15 minutes already. Greg\nbecame more uneasy.\n\nHe waited. Suddenly, bitterly, he realized the hopelessness of it. Even\nif Johnny did manage to damage the Ranger ship, what difference would it\nmake? They had been fools to come out here, idiots to ignore Tawney's\nwarning, the three of them. Tawney had told them in so many words that\nthere would be trouble, and they had come out anyway, just begging for\nit.\n\nWell, now they had what they'd begged for. Greg slammed his fist into\nhis palm angrily. What had they expected? That the big company would\nstep humbly aside for them, with a fortune hanging in the balance? If\nthey had even begun to think it through before they started....\n\nBut they hadn't, and now it was too late. They were under attack; Johnny\nwas off on a fool's errand, gone too long for comfort, and Tom ... Greg\nglanced at his watch. It had been ten minutes since Tom's call. What had\nhe meant by it? A plan, he said. A long chance.\n\nHe couldn't shake off the cold feeling in his chest when he thought\nabout Tom. What if something happened to him....\n\nGreg remembered how he had grown to resent his brother. The time when\nthey were very young and Tom had been struck by the sickness, a native\nMartian virus they called it. He remembered the endless nights of\nattention given to Tom alone. From then on somehow they weren't friends\nany more. But now all that seemed to disappear and Greg only wished that\nTom would appear down the corridor....\n\nA sound startled him. He tensed, gripping the stunner, peering into the\ndarkness. Had he heard something? Or was it his own foot scraping on\nthe deck plate? He held his breath, listening, and the sound came\nagain, louder.\n\nSomeone was moving stealthily up the corridor.\n\nGreg waited, covered by the edge of the hatchway. It might be Johnny\nreturning, or maybe even Tom ... but there was no sign of recognition.\nWhoever it was was coming silently....\n\nThen a beam of light flared from a headlamp, and he saw the blue crackle\nof a stunner. He jerked back as the beam bounced off the metal walls.\nThen he was firing point blank down the corridor, his stunner on a tight\nbeam, a deadly pencil of violent energy. He heard a muffled scream and a\nbulk loomed up in front of him, crashed to the deck at his feet.\n\nHe fired again. Another crash, a shout, and then the sound of footsteps\nretreating. He waited, his heart pounding, but there was nothing more.\n\nThe first attempt on the control cabin had failed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFive minutes later the second attempt began. This time there was no\nwarning sound. A sudden, ear-splitting crash, a groan of tortured metal,\nand the barricaded hatchway glowed dull red. Another crash followed. The\nedge of the hatch split open, pouring acrid Murexide fumes into the\ncabin. A third explosion breached the door six inches; Greg could see\nheadlamps in the corridor beyond.\n\nHe fired through the crack, pressing down the stud until the stunner\nscorched his hand. Then he heard boots clanging up the other corridor.\nHe pressed back against the wall, waited until the sounds were near,\nthen threw open the hatch. For an instant he made a perfect target, but\nthe raiders did not fire. The stunner buzzed in his hand, and once again\nthe footfalls retreated.\n\nThey _were_ being careful!\n\nSilence then, and blackness. Minutes passed ... five, ten.... Greg\nchecked the time again. It was over twenty minutes since Tom had talked\nto him. What had happened? Whatever Tom had planned must have misfired,\nor something would have happened by now. For a moment he considered\nleaving his post and starting down the dark corridor to search ... but\nwhere to search? There was nothing to do but wait and hope for a\nmiracle.\n\nThen suddenly the lights blazed on in the control cabin and the corridor\noutside. An attention signal buzzed in Greg's earphones. \"All right,\nHunter, it's all over,\" a voice grated. \"You've got five minutes to get\ndown to No. 3 lock. If you make us come get you, you'll get hurt.\"\n\n\"I'll chance it,\" Greg snapped back. \"Come on up.\"\n\n\"We're through fooling,\" the voice said. \"You'd better get down here.\nAnd bring your brother with you.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Greg said. \"Start holding your breath.\"\n\nThe contact broke for a moment, then clicked on again. This time it was\nanother voice. \"We've got Johnny Coombs down here,\" it said. \"You want\nhim to stay alive, you start moving. Without your stunner.\"\n\nGreg chewed his lip. They could be bluffing ... but they might not be.\n\"I want to see Johnny,\" he said.\n\nOn the control panel a viewscreen flickered to life. \"Take a look,\nthen,\" the voice said in his earphones.\n\nThey had Johnny, all right. A burly guard was holding his good arm\nbehind his back. Greg could see the speaker wires jerked loose from his\nhelmet.\n\n\"It's up to you,\" the voice said. \"You've got three minutes. If you're\nnot down here by then, this helmet comes off and your friend goes out\nthe lock. It's quick that way, but it's not very pleasant.\"\n\nJohnny was shaking his head violently; the guard wrenched at his arm,\nand the miner's face twisted in pain. \"Two minutes,\" the voice said.\n\n\"Okay,\" Greg said. \"I'm coming down.\"\n\n\"Drop the stunner right there.\"\n\nHe dropped the weapon onto the deck. Three steps out into the corridor,\nand two guards were there to meet him, stunners raised. They marched him\nup the ramp to the outer level corridor and around to No. 3 lock.\n\nThey were waiting there with Johnny. A moment later the guards herded\nthem through the lock and into the hold of the Ranger ship, stripped off\ntheir suits, and searched them.\n\nA big man with a heavy face and coarse black hair came into the cabin.\nHe looked at Johnny and Greg and grunted. \"You must be Hunter,\" he said\nto Greg. \"Where's the other one?\"\n\n\"What other one?\" Greg said.\n\n\"Your brother. Where is he?\"\n\n\"How would I know?\" Greg said.\n\nThe man's face darkened. \"You'd be smart to watch your tongue,\" he said.\n\"We know there were three of you, we want the other one.\"\n\nThe man turned to a guard. \"What about it?\"\n\n\"Don't know, Doc. Nobody's reported him.\"\n\n\"Then take a crew and search the ship. We were due back hours ago. He's\nin there somewhere.\"\n\n\"Sure, Doc.\" The guard disappeared through the lock. The man called Doc\nmotioned Greg and Johnny through into the main cabin.\n\n\"What are you planning to do with us?\" Greg demanded.\n\n\"You'll find out soon enough.\" Doc's mouth twisted angrily.\n\nA guard burst into the cabin. \"Doc, there's just nobody there! We've\nscoured the ship.\"\n\n\"You think he just floated away in his space suit?\" Doc growled. \"_Find\nhim._ Tawney only needs one of them, but we can't take a chance on the\nother one getting back....\" He broke off, his eyes on the viewscreen.\n\"Did you check those scout ships?\"\n\n\"No, I thought....\"\n\n\"Get down there and check them.\" Doc turned back to the viewscreen\nimpatiently.\n\nGreg caught Johnny's eye, saw the big miner's worried frown. \"Where is\nhe?\" he whispered.\n\n\"I don't know. Thought you did....\"\n\n\"All I know is that he had some kind of scheme in mind.\"\n\n\"Shut up,\" Doc said to them. \"If you're smart, you'll be strapping down\nbefore we....\" He broke off in mid sentence, listening.\n\nQuite suddenly, the Ranger ship had begun to vibrate. Somewhere, far\naway, there was the muffled rumble of engines.\n\nDoc whirled to the viewscreen. Greg and Johnny looked at the same\ninstant, and Johnny groaned.\n\nBelow them, the _Scavenger_'s jets were flaring. First the pale starter\nflame, then a long stream of fire, growing longer as the engines\ndeveloped thrust.\n\nDoc slammed down a switch, roared into a speaker. \"That scout\nship ... stop it! He's trying to make a break!\"\n\nTwo guards appeared at the lock almost instantly, but it was too late.\nAlready she was straining at her magnetic cable moorings; then the\nexhaust flared, and the little scout ship leaped away from the\norbit-ship, moving out at a tangent to the asteroid's orbit, picking up\nspeed, moving faster and faster....\n\nIn toward the orbit of Mars.\n\nThe man called Doc had gone pale. Now he snapped on the speaker again.\n\"Frank? Stand by on missile control. He's asking for it.\"\n\n\"Right,\" the voice came back. \"I'm sighting in.\"\n\nThe _Scavenger_ was moving fast now, dwindling in the viewscreen. One\npanel of the screen went telescopic to track her. \"All right,\" Doc said.\n\"Fire one and two.\"\n\nFrom both sides of the Ranger, tiny rockets flared. Like twin bullets\nthe homing shells moved out, side by side, in the track of the escaping\n_Scavenger_. With a strangled cry, Greg leaped forward, but Johnny\ncaught his arm.\n\n\"Johnny, _Tom's on ... that thing_....\"\n\n\"I know. But he's got a chance.\"\n\nAlready the homing shells were out of sight; only the twin flares were\nvisible. Greg stared helplessly at the tiny light-spot of the\n_Scavenger_. At first she had been moving straight, but now she was\ndodging and twisting, her side-jets flaring at irregular intervals. The\ntwin pursuit shells mimicked each change in course, drawing closer to\nher every second.\n\nAnd then there was a flash, so brilliant it nearly blinded them, and the\n_Scavenger_ burst apart in space. The second shell struck a fragment;\nthere was another flash. Then there was nothing but a nebulous powdering\nof tiny metal fragments.\n\nThe last run of the _Scavenger_ had ended.\n\nDazed, Greg turned away from the screen, and somewhere, as if in a\ndream, he heard Doc saying, \"All right, boys, strap this pair down.\nWe've got a lot of work to do before we can get out of here.\"\n\n\n\n\n7. Prisoners\n\n\nWherever they were planning to take them, the captors took great pains\nto make sure that their two prisoners did not escape before they were\nunderway. Greg and Johnny were strapped down securely into accelleration\ncots. Two burly guards were assigned to them, and the guards were taking\ntheir job seriously. One of the two was watching them at all times, and\nboth men held their stunners on ready.\n\nMeanwhile, under Doc's orders, the crew of the Jupiter Equilateral ship\nbegan a systematic looting of the orbit-ship they had disabled. Earlier\nthey had merely searched the cabins and compartments. Now a steady\nstream of pressure-suited men crossed through the airlocks into the\ncrippled vessel, marched back with packing cases full of tape records,\nmicrofilm spools, stored computer data ... anything that might\nconceivably contain information. The control cabin was literally torn\napart. Every storage hold was ransacked.\n\nA team of six men was dispatched to the asteroid surface, searching for\nany sign of mining or prospecting activity. They came back an hour\nlater, long-faced and empty handed. Doc took their reports, his scowl\ngrowing deeper and deeper.\n\nFinally the last of the searchers reported in. \"Doc, we'd scraped it\nclean, and there's nothing there. Not one thing that we didn't check\nbefore.\"\n\n\"There's _got_ to be something there,\" Doc said.\n\n\"You tell me where else to look, and I'll do it.\"\n\nDoc shook his head ominously. \"Tawney's not going to like it,\" he said.\n\"There's no other place it could be....\"\n\n\"Well, at least we have this pair,\" the other said, jerking a thumb at\nGreg and Johnny. \"They'll know.\"\n\nDoc looked at them darkly. \"Yes, and they'll tell, too, or I don't know\nTawney.\"\n\nGreg watched it all happening, heard the noises, saw the packing-cases\ncome through the cabin, and still he could not quite believe it. He\ncaught Johnny's eye, then turned away, suddenly sick. Johnny shook his\nhead. \"Take it easy, boy.\"\n\n\"He didn't even have a chance,\" Greg said.\n\n\"I know that. He must have known it too.\"\n\n\"But why? What was he thinking of?\"\n\n\"Maybe he thought he could make it. Maybe he thought it was the only\nchance....\"\n\nThere was no other answer that Greg could see, and the ache in his chest\nwas deeper.\n\nThere was no way to bring Tom back now. However things had been between\nthem, they could never be changed now. But he knew that as long as he\nwas still breathing, somebody somehow was going to answer for that last\ndesperate run of the _Scavenger_....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt had been an excellent idea, Tom Hunter thought to himself, and it had\nworked perfectly, exactly as he had planned it ... so far. But now, as\nhe clung to his precarious perch, he wondered if it had not worked out a\nlittle too well. The first flush of excitement that he had felt when he\nsaw the _Scavenger_ blow apart in space had begun to die down now; on\nits heels came the unpleasant truth, the realization that only the easy\npart lay behind him so far. The hard part was yet to come, and if that\nwere to fail....\n\nHe realized, suddenly, that he was afraid. He was well enough concealed\nat the moment, clinging tightly against the outside hull of the Ranger\nship, hidden behind the open airlock door. But soon the airlock would be\npulled closed, and then the real test would come.\n\nCarefully, he ran through the plan again in his mind. He was certain now\nthat his reasoning was right. There had been two dozen men on the raider\nship; there had been no question, even from the start, that they would\nsucceed in boarding the orbit-ship and taking its occupants prisoners.\nThe Jupiter Equilateral ship had not appeared there by coincidence. They\nhad come looking for something that they had not found.\n\nAnd the only source of information left was Roger Hunter's sons. The\nthree of them together might have held the ship for hours, or even\ndays ... but with engines and radios smashed, there had been no hope\nof contacting Mars for help. Ultimately, they would have been taken.\n\nAs he had crouched in the dark storage hold in the orbit-ship, Tom had\nrealized this. He had also realized that, once captured, they would\nnever have been freed and allowed to return to Mars.\n\nIf the three of them were taken, they were finished. But what if only\ntwo were taken? He had pushed it aside as a foolish idea, at first. The\nboarding party would never rest until they had accounted for all three.\nThey wouldn't dare go back to their headquarters leaving one live man\nbehind to tell the story....\n\nUnless they thought the third man was dead. If they were sure of\nthat ... _certain_ of it ... they would not hesitate to take the\nremaining two away. And if, by chance, the third man wasn't as dead as\nthey thought he was, and could find a way to follow them home, there\nmight still be a chance to free the other two.\n\nIt was then that he thought of the _Scavenger_, and knew that he had\nfound a way.\n\nIn the cabin of the little scout ship he had worked swiftly, fearful\nthat at any minute one of the marauders might come aboard to search it.\nTom was no rocket pilot, but he did know that the count-down was\nautomatic, and that every ship could run on an autopilot, as a drone,\nfollowing a prescribed course until it ran out of fuel. Even the\nshell-evasion mechanism could be set on automatic....\n\nQuickly he set the autopilot, plotted a simple high school math course\nfor the ship, a course the Ranger ship would be certain to see, and to\nfire upon. He set the count-down clock to give himself plenty of time\nfor the next step.\n\nBoth the airlock to the _Scavenger_ and to the orbit-ship worked on\nelectric motors. The _Scavenger_ was grappled to the orbit-ship's hull\nby magnetic cables. Tom dug into the ship's repair locker, found the\nwires and fuses that he needed, and swiftly started to work.\n\nIt was an ingenious device. The inner airlock door in the orbit-ship was\ntriggered to a fuse. He had left it ajar; the moment it was closed, by\nanyone intending to board the _Scavenger_, the fuse would burn, a\ncircuit would open, and the little ship's autopilot would go on active.\nThe ship would blast away from its moorings, head out toward Mars....\n\nAnd the fireworks would begin. All that he would have to worry about\nthen would be getting himself aboard the Ranger ship without being\ndetected.\n\nWhich was almost impossible. But he knew there was a way. There was one\nplace no one would think to look for him, if he could manage to keep out\nof range of the viewscreen lenses ... the outer hull of the ship. If he\ncould clamp himself to the hull, somehow, and manage to cling there\nduring blastoff, he could follow Greg and Johnny right home.\n\nHe checked the fuse on the airlock once again to make certain it would\nwork. Then he waited, hidden behind the little scout ship's hull,\nuntil the orbit-ship swung around into shadow. He checked his suit\ndials ... oxygen for twenty-two hours, heater pack fully charged,\nsoda-ash only half saturated ... it would do. Above him he could see the\nrear jets of the Ranger. He swung out onto the orbit-ship's hull, and\nbegan crawling up toward the enemy ship.\n\nIt was slow going. Every pressure suit had magnetic boots and hand-pads\nto enable crewmen to go outside and make repairs on the hull of a ship\nin transit. Tom clung, and moved, and clung again, trying to reach the\nprotecting hull of the Ranger before the orbit-ship swung him around to\nthe sun-side again....\n\nHe couldn't move fast enough. He saw the line of sunlight coming around\nthe ship as it swung full into the sun. He froze, crouching motionless.\nIf somebody on the Ranger spotted him now, it was all over. He was\nexposed like a lizard on a rock. He waited, hardly daring to breathe, as\nthe ship spun ponderously around, carrying him into shadow again.\n\nAnd nothing happened. He started crawling upward again, reached up to\ngrab the mooring cable, and swung himself across to the hull of the\nRanger. The airlock hung open; he scuttled behind it, clinging to the\nhull in its shadow just as Greg and Johnny were herded across by the\nJupiter Equilateral guards.\n\nThen he waited. There was no sound, no sign of life. After a while the\nRanger's inner lock opened, and a group of men hurried across to the\norbit-ship. Probably a searching party, Tom thought. Soon the men came\nback, then returned to the orbit-ship. After another minute, he felt the\nvibration of the _Scavenger_'s motors, and he knew that his snare had\nbeen triggered.\n\nHe saw the little ship break free and streak out in its curving\ntrajectory. He saw the homing shells burst from the Ranger's tubes. The\n_Scavenger_ vanished from his range of vision, but moments later he saw\nthe sudden flare of light reflected against the hull of the orbit-ship,\nand he knew his plan had worked, but the ordeal lay ahead.\n\nAnd at the end of it, he might really be a dead man.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHours later, the last group of looters left the orbit-ship, and the\nairlock to the Ranger clanged shut. Tom heard the sucking sound of the\nair-tight seals, then silence. The orbit-ship was empty, its insides\ngutted, its engines no longer operable. The Ranger hung like a long\nsplinter of silver alongside her hull, poised and ready to move on.\n\nHe knew that the time had come. Very soon the blastoff and the\naccelleration would begin. He had a few moments to find a position of\nsafety, no more.\n\nQuickly, he began scrambling toward the rear of the Ranger's hull,\nhugging the metal sides, moving sideways like a crab. Ahead, he knew,\nthe viewscreen lenses would be active; if one of them picked him up, it\nwould be quite a jolt to the men inside the ship ... but it would be the\nend of his free ride.\n\nBut the major peril was the blastoff. Once the engines cut off, the ship\nwould be in free fall. Then he could cling easily to the hull, walk all\nover it if he chose to, with the aid of his boots and hand-pads. But\nunless he found a way to anchor himself firmly to the hull during\nblastoff, he could be flung off like a pebble.\n\nHe heard a whirring sound, and saw the magnetic mooring cables jerk. The\nship was preparing for blastoff. Automatic motors were drawing the\ncables and grappling plates into the hull. Moving quickly, Tom reached\nthe rear cable. Here was his anchor, something to hold him tight to the\nhull! With one hand he loosened the web belt of his suit, looped it over\na corner of the grappling plate as it pulled in to the hull.\n\nThe plate pulled tight against the belt. Each plate fit into a shallow\nexcavation in the hull, fitting so tightly that the plates were all but\ninvisible when they were in place. Tom felt himself pulled in tightly as\nthe plate gripped the belt against the metal, and the whirring of the\nmotor stopped.\n\nFor an instant it looked like the answer. The belt was wedged\ntight ... he couldn't possibly pull loose without ripping the nylon\nwebbing of the belt. But a moment later the motor started whirring again.\nThe plate pushed out from the hull a few inches, then started back, again\npulling in the belt....\n\nA good idea that just wouldn't work. The automatic machinery on a\nspaceship was built to perfection; nothing could be permitted to\nhalf-work. Tom realized what was happening. Unless the plate fit\nperfectly in its place, the cable motor could not shut off, and\npresently an alarm signal would start flashing on the control panel.\n\nHe pulled the belt loose, reluctantly. He would have to count on his\nboots and his hand-pads alone.\n\nHe searched the rear hull, looking for some break in the polished metal\nthat might serve as a toehold. To the rear the fins flared out,\nsupported by heavy struts. He made his way back, crouching close to the\nhull, and straddled one of the struts. He jammed his magnetic boots down\nagainst the hull, and wrapped his arms around the strut with all his\nstrength.\n\nClinging there, he waited.\n\nIt wasn't a good position. The metal of the strut was polished and\nslick, but it was better than trying to cling to the open hull. He\ntensed now, not daring to relax for fear that the blastoff accelleration\nwould slam him when he was unprepared.\n\nDeep in the ship, the engines began to rumble. He felt it rather\nthan heard it, a low-pitched vibration that grew stronger and stronger.\nThe Ranger would not need a great thrust to move away from the\norbit-ship ... but if they were in a hurry, they might start out at\nnearly Mars-escape....\n\nThe jets flared, and something slammed him down against the fin strut.\nThe Ranger moved out, its engines roaring, accellerating hard. Tom felt\nas though he had been hit by a ton of rock. The strut seemed to press in\nagainst his chest; he could not breathe. His hands were sliding, and he\nfelt the pull on his boots. He tightened his grip desperately. This was\nit. He had to hang on, _had_ to hang on....\n\nHe saw his boot on the hull surface, sliding slowly, creeping back and\nstretching his leg, suddenly it broke loose; he lurched to one side, and\nthe other boot began sliding. There was a terrible ache in his arms, as\nthough some malignant giant were tearing at him, trying to wrench him\nloose as he fought for his hold.\n\nThere was one black instant when he knew he could not hold on another\nsecond. He could see the blue flame of the jet streaming behind him, the\ncold blackness of space beyond that. It had been a fool's idea, he\nthought in despair, a million-to-one shot that he had taken, and\nlost....\n\nAnd then the pressure stopped. His boots clanged down on the hull, and\nhe almost lost his hand-grip. He stretched an arm, shook himself, took a\ngreat painful breath, and then clung to the strut, almost sobbing,\nhardly daring to move.\n\nThe ordeal was over. Somewhere, far ahead, an orbit-ship was waiting for\nthe Ranger to return. He would have to be ready for the braking thrust\nand the side-maneuvering thrusts, but he would manage to hold on.\nCrouching against the fin, he would be invisible to viewers on the\norbit-ship ... and who would be looking for a man clinging to the\noutside of a scout-ship?\n\nTom sighed, and waited. Jupiter Equilateral would have its prisoners,\nall right. He wished now that he had not discarded the stunner, but\nthose extra pounds might have made the difference between life and death\nduring the blastoff. And at least he was not completely unarmed. He\nstill had Dad's revolver at his side.\n\nHe smiled to himself. The pirates would have their prisoners,\nindeed ... but they would have one factor to deal with that they\nhad not counted on.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor Greg it was a bitter, lonely trip.\n\nAfter ten hours they saw the huge Jupiter Equilateral orbit-ship looming\nup in the viewscreen like a minor planet. Skilfully Doc maneuvered the\nship into the launching rack. The guards unstrapped the prisoners, and\nhanded them pressure suits.\n\nMoments later they were in a section in crews' quarters where they\nstripped off their suits. This orbit-ship was much larger than Roger\nHunter's; the gravity was almost Mars-normal, and it was comforting just\nto stretch and relax their cramped muscles.\n\nAs long as they didn't think of what was ahead.\n\nFinally Johnny grinned and slapped Greg's shoulder. \"Cheer up,\" he said.\n\"We'll be honored guests for a while, you can bet on that.\"\n\n\"For a while,\" Greg said bitterly.\n\nJust then the hatchway opened. \"Well, who do we have here?\" a familiar\nvoice said. \"Returning a call, you might say. And maybe this time you'll\nbe ready for a bit of bargaining.\"\n\nThey turned to see the heavy face and angry eyes of Merrill Tawney.\n\n\n\n\n8. The Scavengers of Space\n\n\nThe casual observer might have been fooled. Tawney's guard was down only\nfor an instant; then the expression of cold fury and determination on\nhis face dropped away as though the shutter of a camera had clicked, and\nhe was all smiles and affability. They were honored guests here, one\nwould have thought, and this pudgy agent of the Jupiter Equilateral\ncombine was their genial host, anxious for their welfare, eager to do\nanything he could for their comfort....\n\nThey were amazed by the luxuriousness of the ship. For the next few\nhours they received the best treatment, sumptuous accommodations,\nexcellent food.\n\nThey were finishing their second cup of coffee when Tawney asked,\n\"Feeling better, gentlemen?\"\n\n\"You do things in a big way,\" Johnny said. \"This is real coffee, made\nfrom grounds. Must have cost a fortune to ship it out here.\"\n\nTawney spread his hands. \"We keep it for special occasions. Like when we\nhave special visitors.\"\n\n\"Even when the visits aren't voluntary,\" Greg added sourly.\n\n\"We have to be realistic,\" Tawney said. \"Would you have come if we\ninvited you? Of course not. You gentlemen chose to come out to the Belt\nin spite of my warnings. You thus made things very awkward for us, upset\ncertain of our plans.\" He looked at Greg. \"We don't ordinarily allow\npeople to upset our plans, but now we find that we're forced to include\nyou in our plans, whether you happen to like the idea or not.\"\n\n\"You're doing a lot of talking,\" Greg said. \"Why don't you come to the\npoint?\"\n\nTawney was no longer smiling. \"We happen to know that your father struck\na rich lode on one of his claims.\"\n\n\"That's interesting,\" Greg said. \"Did Dad tell you that?\"\n\n\"He didn't have to. A man can't keep a secret like that, not for very\nlong. Ask your friend here, if you don't believe me. And we make it our\nbusiness to know what's going on out here. We have to, in order to\nsurvive.\"\n\n\"Well, suppose you heard right. The law says that what a man finds on\nhis own claim is his.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" Tawney said. \"Nobody would think of claim-jumping, these\ndays. But when a man happens to die before he can bring in his bonanza,\nthen it's a question of who gets there first, wouldn't you think?\"\n\n\"Not when the man is murdered,\" Greg said hotly, \"not by a long shot.\"\n\n\"But you can't prove that your father was murdered.\"\n\n\"If I could, I wouldn't be here.\"\n\n\"Then I think we'll stick to the law,\" Tawney said, \"and call it an\naccident.\"\n\n\"And what about my brother? Was that an accident?\"\n\n\"Ah, yes, your brother.\" Tawney's eyes hardened. \"Quite a different\nmatter, that. Sometimes Doc tends to be over-zealous in carrying out his\nassigned duties. I can assure you that he has been ... disciplined.\"\n\n\"That's not going to help Tom very much.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately not,\" Tawney said. \"Your brother made a very foolish\nmove, under the circumstances. But from a practical point of view,\nperhaps it's not entirely a tragedy.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"From what I've heard,\" Tawney said, \"you didn't have much use for your\ntwin brother. And now you certainly won't have to share your father's\nlegacy....\"\n\nIt was too much. With a roar Greg swung at the little fat man. The blow\ncaught Tawney full in the jaw, jerked his head back. Greg threw his\nshoulder into a hard left, slamming Tawney back against the wall. The\nguard charged across the room, dragging them apart as Tawney blubbered\nand tried to cover his face. Greg dug his elbow into the guard's\nstomach, twisted away and started for Tawney again. Then Johnny caught\nhis arm and spun him around. \"Stop it,\" he snapped. \"Use your head,\nboy....\"\n\nGreg stopped, glaring at Tawney and gasping for breath. The company man\npicked himself up, rubbing his hand across his mouth. For a moment he\ntrembled with rage. Then he gripped the table with one hand, forcibly\nregaining his control. He even managed a sickly smile. \"Just like your\nfather,\" he said, \"too hot-headed for your own good. But we'll let it\npass. I brought you here to make you an offer, a very generous offer,\nand I'll still make it. I'm a businessman, when I want something I want\nI bargain for it. If I have to share a profit to get it, I share the\nprofit. All right ... you know where your father's strike is. We want\nit. We can't find it, so you've got us over a barrel. We're ready to\nbargain.\"\n\nGreg started forward. \"I wouldn't bargain with you for....\"\n\n\"Shut up, Greg,\" Johnny said.\n\nGreg stared at him. The big miner's voice had cracked like a whip; now\nhe was drawing Merrill Tawney aside, speaking rapidly into his ear.\nTawney listened, shot a venomous glance across at Greg, and finally\nnodded. \"All right,\" he said, \"but I can't wait forever....\"\n\n\"You won't have to.\"\n\nTawney turned to the guard. \"You have your orders,\" he said. \"They're to\nhave these quarters, and the freedom of the ship, except for the outer\nlevel. They're not to be harmed, and they're not to be out of your sight\nexcept when they're locked in here. Is that clear?\"\n\nThe guard nodded. Tawney looked at Johnny, and started for the door,\nstill rubbing his jaw. \"We'll talk again later,\" he said, and then he\nwas gone.\n\nWhen the guard had left, and the lock buzzed in the door, Johnny looked\nat Greg and shook his head sadly. \"You just about fixed things, boy, you\nreally did. You've got to use your head if you want to stay alive a\nwhile, that's all. Look, there isn't going to be any bargaining with\nTawney, he just doesn't work that way. It's heads he wins, tails we\nlose. Once he has what he wants we won't last six minutes. All right,\nthen there's just one thing that can keep us alive ... stalling him.\nWe've got to make him think you'll give in if he plays his cards right.\"\n\nGreg was silent for a minute. \"I hadn't thought of it that way.\"\n\n\"And we've got to use the time we have to find some way to break for\nit.\" Johnny stood up, staring around the luxurious lounge. \"If you want\nmy opinion, it's going to take some pretty fancy footwork to get out of\nhere with our skins.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTrue to his word, Tawney had given them the freedom of the ship. Greg\nand Johnny discovered that their guard was also an excellent guide. All\nday he had been leading them through the ship, chatting and answering\ntheir questions about asteroid mining, until they almost forgot that\nthey were really prisoners here. And the guard's obvious pride in the\nscope and skill of his company's mining operations was strangely\ninfectious.\n\nWatching the Jupiter Equilateral ship in operation, Greg felt his heart\nsink. Here was a huge, powerful organization, with all the equipment and\nmen and know-how they could ever need. How could one man, or two or\nthree in a team, hope to compete with them? For the independent miner,\nthe only hope was the Big Strike, the single lode that could make him\nrich. He might work all his life without finding it, and then stumble\nupon it by sheer chance....\n\nBut if he couldn't keep it when he found it, then what? What if the\ngreat mining company became so strong that they could be their own law\nin the Belt? What if they grew strong enough and powerful enough to\nchallenge the United Nations on Mars itself, and gain control of the\nentire mining industry? What chance would the independent miner have\nthen?\n\nIt was a frightening picture. Suddenly something began to make sense to\nGreg; he realized something about his father that he had never known\nbefore.\n\nRoger Hunter had been a miner, yes. But he had been something else too,\nsomething far more important than just a miner.\n\nRoger Hunter had been a fighter, fighting to the end for something he\nbelieved in....\n\nTawney interrupted Greg's thought.\n\n\"Quite an operation,\" he said.\n\nGreg looked at him. \"So I see.\"\n\n\"And very efficient, too. Our men have everything they need to work\nwith. We can mine at far less cost than anyone else.\"\n\n\"But you still can't stand the idea of independent miners working the\nBelt,\" Greg said.\n\nTawney's eyebrows went up. \"But why not? There's lots of room out here.\nOur operation with Jupiter Equilateral is no different from an\nindependent miner's operation. We aren't different kinds of people.\"\nTawney smiled. \"When you get right down to it, we're both exactly the\nsame thing ... scavengers in space, vultures picking over the dead\nremains to see what we can find. We come out to the asteroids, and we\nbring back what we want and leave the rest behind. And it doesn't matter\nwhether we've got one ship working or four hundred ... we're still just\nscavengers.\"\n\n\"With just one difference,\" Greg said, turning away from the viewscreen.\n\n\"Difference?\"\n\nGreg nodded. \"Even vultures don't kill their own,\" he said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLater, when they were alone in their quarters again, Greg and Johnny\nstared at each other gloomily.\n\n\"Didn't you see _anything_ that might help us?\" Greg said.\n\n\"Not much. For an orbit-ship, this place is a fortress. I got a good\nlook at that scout ship coming in ... it was armed to the teeth.\nProbably they all are. And they're keeping a guard now at every\nairlock.\"\n\n\"So we're sewed up tight,\" Greg said.\n\n\"Looks that way. They've got us, boy, and I think Tawney's patience is\nwearing thin, too. We're either going to have to produce or else.\"\n\n\"But what can we do?\"\n\n\"Start bluffing.\"\n\n\"It seems to me we're just about bluffed out.\"\n\n\"I mean talk business,\" Johnny said. \"Tell Tawney what he wants to\nknow.\"\n\n\"When we don't know any more than he does? How?\"\n\nJohnny Coombs scratched his jaw. \"I've been thinking about that,\" he\nsaid slowly, \"and I wonder if we don't know a whole lot more than we\nthink we do.\"\n\n\"Like what?\" Greg said.\n\n\"We've all been looking for the same thing ... a Big Strike, a bonanza\nlode. Tawney's men have raked over every one of your Dad's claims, and\nthey haven't turned up a thing.\" Johnny looked at Greg. \"Makes you\nwonder a little, doesn't it? Your Dad was smart, but he was no magician.\nAnd how does a man go about hiding something like a vein of ore?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Greg said. \"It doesn't seem possible.\"\n\n\"It isn't possible,\" Johnny said flatly. \"There's only one possible\nexplanation, and we've been missing it all along. Whatever he found, _it\nwasn't an ore strike_. It was something else, something far different\nfrom anything we've been thinking of.\"\n\nGreg stared at him. \"But if it wasn't an ore strike, what was it?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Johnny said. \"But I'm sure of one thing ... it was\nsomething important enough that he was ready to die before he'd reveal\nit. And that means it was important enough that Tawney won't dare kill\nus until he finds out what it was.\"\n\n\n\n\n9. The Invisible Man\n\n\nCrouching back into the shadow, Tom Hunter waited as the heavy footsteps\nmoved up the corridor, then back down, then up and down again. He peered\naround the corner for a moment, looking quickly up and down the curving\ncorridor. The guard was twenty yards away, moving toward him in a slow\nmeasured pace. Tom jerked his head back, then peered out again as the\nfootsteps receded.\n\nThe guard was a big man, with a heavy-duty stunner resting in the crook\nof his elbow. He paused, scratched himself, and resumed his pacing. Tom\nwaited, hoping that something might distract the big man, but he moved\nstolidly back and forth, not too alert, but far too alert to risk\nbreaking out into the main corridor.\n\nTom moved back into the darkened corridor where he was standing, trying\nto decide what to do. It was a side corridor, and a blind alley; it\nended in a large hatchway marked HYDROPONICS, and there were no\nbranching corridors. If he were discovered here, there would be no place\nto hide.\n\nBut he knew that he could never hope to accomplish his purpose here....\n\nA hatch clanged open, and there were more footsteps down the main\ncorridor as a change of guards hurried by. There was a rumble of voices,\nand Tom listened to catch the words.\n\n\"... don't care what you think, the boss says tighten it up....\"\n\n\"But they got them locked in....\"\n\n\"So tell it to the boss. We're supposed to check every compartment in\nthe section every hour. Now get moving....\"\n\nThe footsteps moved up and down the corridor then, and Tom heard hatches\nclanging open. If they sent a light down this spur ... he turned to the\nhatch, spun the big wheel on the door, and slipped inside just as the\nfootsteps came closer.\n\nThe stench inside was almost overpowering. The big, darkened room was\nextremely warm, the air damp with vapor. The plastic-coated walls\nstreamed with moisture. Against the walls Tom could see the great\nhydroponic vats that held the yeast and algae cultures that fed the crew\nof the ship. Water was splashing in one of the vats, and there was a\ngurgling sound as nutrient broth drained out, to be replaced with\nfresh.\n\nHe moved swiftly across the compartment, into a darkened area behind the\nrows of vats, and crouched down. He heard footsteps, and the ring of\nmetal as the hatchway came open. One of the guards walked in, peered\ninto the gloom, wrinkled his nose, and walked out again, closing the\nhatchway behind him.\n\nIt would do for a while ... if he didn't suffocate ... but if this ship\nwas organized like smaller ones, it would be a blind alley. Modern\nhydroponic tanks did not require much servicing, once the cultures were\ngrowing; the broth was drained automatically and sluiced through a\nseries of pipes to the rendering plant where the yeasts could be\nflavored and pressed into surrogate steaks and other items for spaceship\ncuisine. There would be no other entrances, no way to leave except the\nway he had come in.\n\nAnd with the guards on duty, that was out of the question. He waited,\nlistening, as the check-down continued in nearby compartments. Then\nsilence fell again. The heavy yeast aroma had grown more and more\noppressive; now suddenly a fan went on with a whir, and a cool draft of\nfreshened reprocessed air poured down from the ventilator shaft above\nhis head.\n\nGetting into the orbit-ship had been easier than he had hoped. In the\nexcitement as the new prisoners were brought aboard, security measures\nhad been lax. No one had expected a third visitor; in consequence, no\none looked for one. Huge as it was, the Jupiter Equilateral ship had\nnever been planned as a prison, and it had taken time to stake out the\nguards in a security system that was at all effective. In addition,\nevery man who served as a guard had been taken from duty somewhere else\non the ship.\n\nSo there had been no guard at the airlock in the first few moments after\nthe prisoners were taken off the Ranger ship. Tom had waited until the\nship was moored, clinging to the fin strut. He watched Greg and Johnny\ntaken through the lock, and soon the last of the crew had crossed over\nafter securing the ship. Presently the orbit-ship airlock had gone dark,\nand only then had he ventured from his place of concealment, creeping\nalong the dark hull of the Ranger ship and leaping across to the\nairlock.\n\nA momentary risk, then, as he opened the lock. In the control room, he\nknew, a signal light would blink on a panel as the lock was opened. Tom\nmoved as quickly as he could, hoping that in the excitement of the new\nvisitors, the signal would go unnoticed ... or if spotted, that the\nspotter would assume it was only a crewman making a final trip across to\nthe Ranger ship.\n\nBut once inside, he began to realize the magnitude of his problem. This\nwas not a tiny independent orbit-ship with a few corridors and\ncompartments. This was a huge ship, a vast complex of corridors and\ncompartments and holds. There was probably a crew of a thousand men on\nthis ship ... and there was no sign where Greg and Johnny might have\nbeen taken.\n\nHe moved forward, trying to keep to side corridors and darkened areas.\nIn the airlock he had wrapped up his pressure suit and stored it on a\nrack; no one would notice it there, and it might be handy later. He had\nstrapped his father's gun case to his side, some comfort, but a small\none.\n\nNow, crouching behind the yeast vat, he lifted out the gun, hefted it\nidly in his hand. It was a weapon, at least. He was not well acquainted\nwith guns, and in the shadowy light it seemed to him that this one\nlooked odd for a revolver; it even felt wrong, out of balance in his\nhand. He slipped it back in the case. After all, it had been fitted to\nDad's hand, not his. And Johnny or Greg would know how to use it better\nthan he would.\n\nIf he could find them. But to do that, he would have to search the ship.\nHe would have to move about, he couldn't just wait in a storage hold.\nAnd with all the guards that were posted, he would certainly stumble\ninto one of them sooner or later if he tried leaving this spot....\n\nHe shook his head, and started for the hatch. He would have to chance\nit. There was no way to tell how much time he had, but it was a sure bet\nthat he didn't have very long.\n\nIn the spur corridor again, he waited until the guard's footsteps were\nmuffled and distant. Then he darted out into the main corridor, moving\nswiftly and silently away from the guard. At the first hatchway he\nducked inside, waited in the darkness, panting....\n\nThe guard had stopped walking. Then his footsteps resumed, but more\nquickly, coming down the corridor. He stopped, almost outside the\nhatchway door. \"Funny,\" Tom heard him mutter. \"I'd have sworn....\"\n\nTom held his breath, waiting. This was a storage hold, but he didn't\ndare to move, even to take cover. The guard stood motionless for a\nmoment, then grunted, and resumed his slow pacing.\n\nWhen he had moved away Tom caught his breath in huge gasps, his heart\nbeating in his throat. It was no use, he thought in despair. Once or\ntwice he might get away with it, but sooner or later a guard would be\nalert enough to investigate an obscure noise, a flicker of movement in\nthe corner of his eye....\n\nThere had to be another way. His eye probed the storage hold,\nhopelessly, and then stopped on a metal grill in the wall.\n\nFor a moment, he didn't recognize what it was. Then there was a\n_whoosh-whoosh-whoosh_ as a fan went on, and he felt cool air against\nhis cheek. He held out his hand to the grill, found the air coming from\nthere.\n\nA ventilation shaft. Every space craft had to have reconditioning units\nfor the air inside the ship; the men inside needed a constant supply of\nfresh oxygen, but even more, without pumps to move the air in each\ncompartment they would soon suffocate from the accumulation of carbon\ndioxide in the air they breathed out, or bake from the heat their bodies\nradiated. On the other hand, the yeasts and algae required carbon\ndioxide and yielded copious amounts of oxygen as they grew.\n\nIn Roger Hunter's little orbit-ship the ventilation shafts were small, a\nloose network of foot-square ducts leading from the central pumps and\nair-reconditioning units to every compartment in the ship. But in a ship\nof this size....\n\nThe grill was over a yard wide, four feet tall. It started about\nshoulder height and ran up to the overhead. The ducts would network the\nship, opening into every compartment, and no one would ever open them\nunless something went wrong.\n\nAnd then he was laughing out loud, working the grill out of the slots\nthat held it to the wall, trying to make his hands work in his\nexcitement.\n\nHe knew he had found his answer.\n\nThe grill came loose, lifted down in a piece. He stopped short as\nfootsteps approached in the corridor, paused, and went on. Then he\npeered into the black gaping hole behind the grill. It was big enough\nfor a man to crawl in. He shinned up into the hole, and pulled the grill\nback into its slot behind him.\n\nSomewhere far away he heard a throbbing of giant pumps. There was a rush\nof cool fresh air past his cheek, cold when it contacted the sweat\npouring down his forehead. He could not quite stand up, but there was\nplenty of room for him to crouch and move.\n\nAhead of him was a black tunnel, broken only by a patch of light coming\nthrough the grill that opened into the next compartment. He started into\nthe blackness, his heart racing.\n\nSomewhere in the ship Johnny Coombs and Greg Hunter were\nprisoners ... but now, Tom knew, there was a way to escape.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was a completely different world, a world within a world, a world of\ndarkness and silence, of a thousand curving and intersecting tunnels,\nsome large, some small. For hours it seemed to him that he had been\nwandering through a tomb, moving through the corridors of a dead ship,\nthe lone surviving crewman. There was some contact with the other world,\nof course, the world of the spaceship outside ... each compartment had\nits metal grill, and he passed many of them. But there were like doors\nthat only he knew existed. He met no one in _these_ corridors, there was\nno danger of sudden discovery and arrest in these dark alleys....\n\nHis boots had made too much noise as he started out, so he had slipped\nthem off, hanging them from his belt and moving on in his stocking feet.\nAs he went from duct to duct, he had an almost ridiculous feeling of\nfreedom and power. In every sense, he was an invisible man. Not one soul\non this great ship knew he was here, or even suspected. He had the run\nof the ship, complete freedom to go wherever he chose. He could move\nfrom compartment to compartment as silently and invisibly as if he had\nno substance at all.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe knew the first job was to learn the pattern of the ducts, and\norientation was a problem. He had heard stories of men getting lost in\nthe deep underground mining tunnels on Mars, wandering in circles for\ndays until their food gave out and they starved. And there was that\nhazard here, for every duct looked like every other one.\n\nBut there was a difference here, because the ducts curved just as the\nmain ship's corridors did. He could always identify the center of the\nship by the force of false gravity pulling the other way. Furthermore,\nas the ducts drew closer to the pumps and reconditioning units, they\nopened into larger vents, and the noise of the pumps thundered in his\nears. After an hour of exploration, Tom was certain that from any place\nin the ship he could at least find his way to the outer layer, and from\nthere to one of the scout-ship airlocks.\n\nFinding Greg and Johnny was quite a different matter.\n\nHe could not see enough through the compartment grills to identify just\nwhat the compartments were; he was forced to rely on what he could hear.\nThe engine rooms were easily identified. In one area he heard the\nbanging of pots and pans, the steaming of kettles ... obviously the\ngalley. He found the control area. He could hear the clatter of typing\ninstruments, the _click-click-click_ of the computers working out the\norbits and trajectories for the scout-ships as they moved out from the\norbit-ship or came back in. In another compartment he heard a dispatcher\nchattering his own special code-language into a microphone in a\nlow-pitched voice. He passed another grill, and then stopped short as a\nfamiliar voice drifted through.\n\nMerrill Tawney's voice.\n\nTom hugged the grill, straining to catch the words. The company man\nsounded angry; the man he was talking to sounded even angrier. \"I can't\nhelp what you want or don't want, Merrill, I can only report what we've\nfound, and that's nothing at all. Every one of those claims has been\nsearched twice over. Doc and his boys went over them, and we didn't find\nanything they missed. I think you're barking up the wrong tree.\"\n\n\"There's _got_ to be something,\" Tawney said, his voice tight with\nanger. \"Hunter couldn't have taken anything away from there, he didn't\nhave a chance to. You read the reports...\"\n\n\"I know,\" the other said wearily, \"I know what the reports said.\"\n\n\"Then what he found is still there. There's no other possibility,\"\nTawney said.\n\n\"We went over that rock with a microscope. We blew it to shreds. Assay\nhas gone through the fragments literally piece by piece. They found low\ngrade iron, a trace of nickel, a little tin, and lots of granite. If we\nnever found anything richer than that, we'd have been out of business\nten years ago.\"\n\nThere was a long silence. Tom pressed closer to the grill. Then he heard\nTawney slam his fist into his palm. \"You know what Roger Hunter's doing,\ndon't you?\" he said. \"He's making fools of us, that's what! The man's\ndead, and he's making us look like idiots. If we hadn't been so sure we\nhad the lode spotted ...\" He broke off. \"Well, that's done, we can't\nundo it. But this brat of his....\"\n\n\"Any luck there?\"\n\n\"Not a word. He's playing coy.\"\n\n\"Maybe he doesn't know anything. Doc made a bad mistake when he blasted\nthe other one ... suppose _he_ was the only one that knew.\"\n\n\"All right, it was a mistake,\" Tawney snapped. \"What was he supposed to\ndo, let him get back to Mars? We've got a good front there, but it's not\nthat good. If the United Nations gets a toehold out here, the whole Belt\nwill go into their pocket, you realize that. They're waiting for us to\nmake one slip.\" He paused, and Tom heard him pacing the compartment.\n\"But I think we've got our boy. This one knows. We've been spoiling him\nso far, that's all. Well, now we start digging. When I get through with\nhim, he'll be begging us to let him tell. You just watch me, as soon as\nthe okay comes through....\"\n\nTom drew back from the grill, moving on in the darkness. So far he had\nnot rushed his exploration ... there was a chance to use the ducts for\nescape, he wanted to know them well. But now he knew the hour was\ngetting late. So far Greg and Johnny had been stalling Tawney ... but\nTawney was getting impatient.\n\nHe moved quickly and he thought again of what Tawney had said. Tawney\nwas right about one thing ... there was no way that Dad could have\nhidden a Big Strike so nobody could find it. It had to be there....\n\nAnd yet it wasn't. He and Greg hadn't found it. Tawney's men hadn't\nfound it, either. Why not? There must be a reason.\n\nBut he could not put his finger on it.\n\nHalf an hour later he was seriously worried. Half the compartments in\nthe area were deserted, the men leaving for the cafeteria. The thought\nreminded Tom how hungry he was, and thirsty. His small emergency ration\nkit was empty. He toyed with the thought of sneaking into a food storage\ncompartment, then thrust it out of his mind as too risky. He had to find\nGreg and Johnny before anything.\n\nHe passed a grill, and heard a murmur of voices; something in the deep\nbass rumble caught his ear, and he stopped, listened.\n\nThe voices stopped also.\n\nHe waited for them to begin, pressing against the grill. Johnny Coombs\nwas not the only man with a deep bass voice, he might have been\nmistaken. He listened, but there was no sound. He heard the whir of a\nfan begin, still no sound, not even footsteps.\n\nAnd then it happened, so fast he was taken completely off guard. The\ngrill suddenly gave way, pitching him forward into the compartment.\nSomething struck him behind the ear as he fell; there was a grunt, a\nsharp command, and he was pinned to the floor in the semi-darkness of\nthe compartment.\n\nThen he heard a gasp, and he opened his eyes. He was staring into his\nbrother's startled face. Greg was pinning his shoulders to the carpeted\ndeck, and behind him Johnny Coombs had a fist raised....\n\nBut they had stopped in mid-air, like a tableau of puppets. Greg gaped,\nhis jaw falling open, and Tom heard himself saying, \"What are you trying\nto do, kill a guy? Seems to me one time is enough.\"\n\nHe had found them.\n\n\n\n\n10. The Trigger\n\n\nIn the first instance of astonishment they were speechless. Later, Tom\nsaid it was the first time in his life that he had ever seen Greg\ntotally without words; his brother jumped back, as if he had seen a\nghost, and his mouth worked, but no sounds came out.\n\n\"Don't worry, it's me all right,\" Tom said, \"and I'm mighty hungry.\"\n\nGreg and Johnny stared at the black hole behind the grill ... and then\nGreg was pumelling him, pounding him on the back, so excited he couldn't\nget a sentence out, and Johnny was hovering over them, incredulous but\nforced to believe his eyes, like a father overwhelmed by the impossible\nbehavior of a pair of unpredictable children. It was a jubilant reunion.\nThey broke open the cabinets and refrigerator in the back of the lounge\nand pulled out surro-ham and rolls, while Johnny got some coffee going.\nTom was so famished he could hardly wait to make sandwiches of the ham.\nHe ate it as fast as he got it.\n\nBut finally he slowed up, got his mouth empty enough to talk. \"All\nright, let's have the story,\" Greg said, still looking as though he\ncouldn't believe his eyes. \"The last we saw, you were blown into atoms\nout there in that _Scavenger_ ... you've got some nerve turning up now\nand scaring us half out of our skins....\"\n\n\"You want me to go back in my hole?\"\n\n\"Just sit still and talk!\"\n\nTom told them, then, starting from the beginning.\n\nThrough it all Greg stared in admiration. \"We've got a genius among us,\nthat's all,\" he said finally. \"And I always thought you were the timid\none....\"\n\n\"But what else could I do?\" Tom said. \"You know what they say about\ngrabbing a tiger by the tail ... once you get hold, you've got to hold\non.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Greg said, \"but the next time I make a crack about your retiring\nnature, remind me to stick my foot in my mouth.\"\n\n\"I'll do it for him,\" Johnny Coombs rumbled.\n\nTom nodded toward the open grill. \"The only thing I don't see is how you\nknew I was back there.\"\n\nJohnny grinned. \"We were busy taking down the grill when you came\nalong. We'd found three microphones in this place, and figured they\nmight have one behind the grill. And then we heard somebody breathing\nback there ... we thought they'd posted a guard back there, just to snoop\nus.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm glad you didn't hit him any harder....\"\n\nJohnny started to say something, then stopped, cocked his head toward\nthe door. There were footsteps in the corridor outside; they came\ncloser, stopped by the door. \"Quick,\" Johnny hissed, \"back inside!\"\n\nThere was no time to look for other concealment. Tom leaped across the\nroom, jumped up into the shaft again, and Greg slammed the grate up into\nplace just as the hatchway door swung open.\n\nMerrill Tawney walked into the room, with two burly guards behind him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor the first few seconds, Greg was certain that they were lost. He\nstood with his back to the ventilator grill, frozen in his tracks as the\nfat little company man came in the room. He tried to keep his face\nblank, but he knew he wasn't succeeding. He saw the puzzled frown form\non Tawney's face.\n\nThe company man motioned the guards into the room, peered suspiciously\nat Greg and Johnny. \"Am I interrupting something, by any chance?\"\n\n\"Nothing at all,\" Johnny blurted. \"We were just talking.\"\n\n\"Talking.\" Tawney repeated the word as if it were some strange language\nhe didn't quite understand. He looked at the guard. \"Let's just check\nthem.\"\n\nWhile one guard patted down their clothes, the other withdrew a stunner,\nheld it on ready. Tawney prowled the lounge. He glanced at the food on\nthe table, then reached under the chair cushion and withdrew the\ndisconnected microphone, looked at the loose wires, and tossed it aside.\n\n\"They're clean,\" the guard said.\n\nTawney's face was a study of uneasiness, but he clearly could not\npinpoint what the trouble was. Finally he shrugged, turned on the smile\nagain, although his eyes remained watchful. \"Well, maybe you won't mind\nif I join in the talking for a while,\" he said. \"You've been\ncomfortable? No complaints?\"\n\n\"No complaints,\" Greg said.\n\n\"Then I presume we're ready to talk business.\" He looked at Greg.\n\n\"You said you were ready to bargain,\" Greg said, \"but I haven't heard\nany terms yet.\"\n\n\"Terms? Very simple. You direct us to the lode, we give you half of\neverything we realize from it,\" Tawney said, smiling.\n\n\"You mean you'll write us a contract? With a U.N. witness to it?\"\n\n\"Well, hardly ... under the circumstances. I'm afraid you'll have to\ntake our word.\"\n\nGreg looked at the company man, and shook his head. \"Not that I don't\ntrust you,\" he said, \"but I'm afraid I can't give you what you want,\"\nGreg said.\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because I don't know where Dad made his strike.\"\n\nThe company man's face darkened. \"Somebody knows where it is. Your\nfather would never have found something like that without telling his\nown sons....\"\n\n\"Sorry,\" Greg said. \"Of course, I can tell you where you can find out,\nif you want to go look.\"\n\n\"We've already searched his records....\"\n\n\"_Some_ of his records,\" Greg said. \"Not all of them. There was a\ncompartment behind the main control panel in Dad's orbit-ship. Dad used\nit to store deeds, claims, other important papers. There was a packet of\nnotes in there before your men fired on the ship. But of course, maybe\nyou searched more thoroughly, the second time.\"\n\nTawney stared at him for a moment, then at Johnny. Johnny Coombs\nshrugged his shoulders solemnly, and shook his head. Without a word, the\nlittle company man walked to the intercom speaker on the wall. He spoke\nsharply into it, waited, then had a brief, pungent conversation with\nsomeone. Then he turned back to Greg, his face heavy with suspicion.\n\"You saw these papers?\"\n\n\"Certainly I saw them. I didn't have time to read them through, but what\nelse could they be?\"\n\n\"Let me warn you,\" Tawney said coldly, \"if I send a crew out there on a\nwild goose chase, the party will be over when they get back, do you\nunderstand? You've been given every consideration. If this is a fool's\nerrand, you'll pay for it very dearly.\" He turned on his heel, snarled\nat one of the guards. \"I want them watched every minute,\" he said. \"One\nof you stay with them constantly. It won't take long to find out if this\nis a stall....\"\n\nHe stalked out, and the hatchway clanged behind him. One guard went\nalong; the big one with the stunner stayed behind, eyeing his prisoners\nunpleasantly. The stunner was in his hand, the safety off.\n\nJohnny Coombs started across the room toward the kitchennette, passing\nclose to the guard. Suddenly he turned, swung his fist heavily down on\nthe guard's neck. The stunner crackled, but Greg had jumped aside.\nAnother blow from Johnny's fist sent the gun flying. Another blow, and\nthe guard's legs slid out from under him. He fell unconscious to the\nfloor.\n\nIn an instant they were across the room, lifting down the grill, helping\nTom out of his hiding place. \"Okay, boy,\" Johnny said to Greg, \"I guess\nyou pulled the trigger with that story of yours.\"\n\n\"Not me,\" Greg said. \"Tom did. He's the one that showed us the way\nout ... the same way he came in.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe guard was out for a while, they made sure of that first. Then there\nwas a hasty consultation. \"The airlocks are guarded,\" Johnny said, \"and\nif they tumble to the ventilator shafts, they can smoke us out in no\ntime. How are we going to get a scout-ship without showing ourselves?\nFor that matter, how are we going to get a scout-ship away from here\nwithout being blown up the way the _Scavenger_ was blown up?\"\n\n\"I think I know a way,\" Tom said. \"We have to have something to keep a\nlot of the crew busy. If we could get to the ship's generators and put\nthem out of commission somehow, it might do it.\"\n\n\"Why?\" Greg wanted to know.\n\n\"Because of the air supply,\" Tom said. \"Without the generators, the fans\nwon't run. They'll have to get a crew to fix them or they'll suffocate.\"\n\n\"But that would only take a few men,\" Johnny said. \"As soon as\nthe generators went out, they'd look for us, and if we were\nmissing ... well, they'd have the whole crew beating the bushes for us.\nIt wouldn't be long before somebody thought of the ventilators.\"\n\n\"But we've got to do something, and do it fast,\" Tom said.\n\n\"I know.\" Johnny chewed his lip. \"It's a good idea, but we need more\nthan just the generators. We've got to disable the ship ... throw so\nmany things at them so fast from so many different directions that they\ndon't know which way to turn. That means we'd need to split up, and we'd\nneed weapons.\" He hefted the guard's Markheim. \"One stunner between\nthree of us isn't enough.\"\n\n\"Well, we have this.\" Tom unbuckled Roger Hunter's gun case from his\nbelt. \"Dad's revolver. It's not a stunner, but it might help.\" He tossed\nthe case to Johnny. \"I can give you both a rundown on how the shafts go.\nWe could plan to meet at a certain spot in a certain length of time....\"\n\nHe broke off, looking at Johnny. The big miner had taken Roger Hunter's\ngun from the case, and hefted it in his hand, started to check it\nautomatically as Tom talked. But now his hand froze as he stared at the\nweapon.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Tom asked.\n\n\"This gun is wrong,\" Johnny said. \"All wrong. Where did you get this\nthing?\"\n\n\"From Dad's spacer pack, the one the Patrol brought back. The Major gave\nit to us in Sun Lake City.\" Tom peered at the gun. \"Is it broken or\nsomething? It's just Dad's revolver....\"\n\n\"It is, eh?\" Johnny turned the gun over in his hand. \"Whoever told you\nabout guns?\"\n\n\"What's wrong with it?\"\n\nThere was an odd expression on Johnny's face as he handed the weapon\nback to Tom. \"Take a look at it,\" he said. \"Tell me whether it's loaded\nor not.\"\n\nTom looked at it. Except for a few hours on the firing range, he had had\nno experience with guns; he couldn't have taken down a Markheim and\nreassembled it if his life depended on it. But he had seen his father\ntake the old revolver out of the leather case many times before.\n\nNow Tom could see that this was not the same gun.\n\nThe thing in his hand was large and awkward. The hand-grips didn't fit;\nthere was no trigger guard, and no trigger. Several inches along the\ngleaming metal barrel was a shiny stud, and below it a dial with notches\non it.\n\n\"That's funny,\" Tom said. \"I've never seen this thing before.\"\n\nGreg took it from him, balanced it in his hand. \"Doesn't feel right,\" he\nsaid. \"All out of balance.\"\n\n\"Look at the barrel,\" Johnny said quietly.\n\nGreg looked. There was no hole in the end of the barrel. \"This thing's\ncrazy,\" he said.\n\n\"And then some,\" Johnny said. \"You haven't had this out of the case\nsince you took it from the pack?\"\n\n\"Just once,\" said Tom. \"And I put it right back. I hardly looked at it.\nLook, maybe it's just a new model Dad got.\"\n\n\"It's no new model. I'm not even sure it's a gun,\" Johnny said. \"Doesn't\n_feel_ like a gun.\"\n\n\"What happens when you push the stud here?\" Greg asked.\n\nJohnny licked his lips nervously. \"Try it,\" he said.\n\nGreg leveled the thing at the rear wall of the lounge and pressed the\nstud. There was a sharp buzzing sound, and a blinding flash of blue\nlight against the wall. It looked for all the world like the flash of a\nlive power line shorting out. They squinted at the flash, rubbed their\neyes....\n\nAnd stared at the wall. Or at what was left of the wall, because most of\nthe wall was gone. The metal had bellied out in a six-foot hole into the\nstorage hold beyond....\n\nJohnny Coombs whistled. \"This thing did _that_?\" he whispered.\n\n\"It must have....\"\n\n\"But there's no gun ever made that could do that.\" He walked over to the\nhole in the wall. \"That's half-inch steel plate. There's no way to pack\nthat kind of energy into a hand gun.\"\n\nThey stared at the innocent-looking weapon in Greg's hand. \"Whatever it\nis, Dad must have put it in the gun-case.\"\n\n\"Yes, he must have,\" Johnny said.\n\n\"Well, don't you see what that means? _Dad must have found it\nsomewhere_. Somewhere out here in the Belt ... a gun that no man could\nhave made....\"\n\nHe took the weapon, ran his finger along the gleaming barrel. \"I\nwonder,\" he said, \"what else Dad might have found out there.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSomewhere below them they heard a hatch clang shut, and even deeper in\nthe ship generator motors began throbbing in a steady even rhythm. In\nthe silence of the lounge they could hear their own breathing, and\noutside a thousand tiny sounds of the ship's activity were audible.\n\nBut now they had attention only for the odd-shaped piece of metal in\nGreg's hand, and for the hole that gaped in the wall.\n\n\"You think that _this_ was what Dad found?\" Greg said. \"The Big Strike\nhe told Johnny about?\"\n\n\"It must be part of it,\" Tom said.\n\n\"But what is it? And where did it come from? It doesn't make sense,\"\nGreg protested.\n\n\"It doesn't make sense the way we've been looking at it,\" Tom said. \"All\nwe've found was some gobbledegook in Dad's private log to tell us what\nhe found ... but it couldn't have been a vein of ore, or Tawney's men\nwould have unearthed it. It had to be something else. Something that was\nso big and important that Dad didn't even dare let Johnny in on it.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's been the craziest part of it, to me,\" Johnny said. \"I've\ndone a lot of mining with your Dad. If he'd hit rich ore, he would have\ntaken me out there to mine it with him. But he didn't. He said it was\nsomething he had to work on alone for a while, and he sent me back.\"\n\n\"As if he'd found something that scared him,\" Tom said, \"or something\nthat he didn't understand. He was _afraid_ to tell anybody. And whatever\nhe found, he managed to hide it somewhere, so that nobody would find\nit....\"\n\n\"Then why didn't he hide this part of it, too?\" Greg said.\n\n\"Maybe to be sure there was some trace left, if anything happened to\nhim,\" Tom said.\n\nThey were silent for a moment. The only sound was the stertorous\nbreathing of the unconscious guard. \"Well,\" Greg said finally, \"I have\nto admit it makes sense. It makes other things add up better, too. Dad\nwas no fool, he must have known that Tawney was onto something. And Dad\nwould never have risked his life for an ore strike. He'd either have\nmade a deal with Tawney or let him hijack the lode, if that was all\nthere was to it. But there's still one big question ... where did he\nhide what he found? And we aren't going to find the answer here.\" He\nwalked over to the hole in the wall.\n\n\"Made quite a mess of it, didn't it?\" Johnny said.\n\n\"Looks like it. I wonder what that thing would do to a ship's generator\nplant.\" He turned to Johnny. \"We haven't much time. With this thing, we\ncould tear this ship apart, leave them so confused they'll never know\nwhat broke loose. And if we could get that gun back to Major Briarton,\nhe'd have to listen to us, and get the U.N. Patrol into the search....\"\n\nThey had been so intent on their talking that they did not hear the\nfootsteps in the corridor until the door swung open. It was another\nguard, the one who had departed with Tawney. He stopped short, blinking\nat his companion on the floor, and then at the gaping hole in the wall.\nWhen he saw the twins, side by side, his jaw sagged and a strangled\nsound came from his throat.\n\nThen Johnny grabbed his arm, jerked him into the lounge, and slammed the\nhatch shut. Greg pulled the stunner from his holster and tossed it to\nTom. The guard let out a roar, twisted free, and met Johnny's fist as he\ncame around. He sagged at the knees and slid to the floor beside the\nother guard. \"All right,\" Johnny said, \"we've dealt the cards, now we'd\nbetter play the hand. Tom, you first.\"\n\nTom pulled the ventilator grill down, and climbed up into the shaft.\nGreg followed, with Johnny at his heels, pulling the grill back up into\nplace from the inside. They waited for a moment, but there was no sound\nfrom the lounge.\n\n\"All right,\" Johnny said breathlessly. \"Let's move.\"\n\nSwiftly they started down the dark tunnel.\n\n\n\n\n11. The Haunted Ship\n\n\nThey did not pause, even to catch their breath, for the first twenty\nminutes as Tom led them swiftly and silently down through the maze of\ncorridors and chutes that made up the ventilation system of the huge\nship. Greg lost his bearing completely in the first twenty seconds; each\ntime his brother paused at a junction of tubes, he felt a wave of panic\nrise up in his throat ... suppose they lost themselves in here! He heard\nJohnny's trousers flapping behind him, saw Tom's figure flit past\nanother grill up ahead, and plunged doggedly on.\n\nIt was amazingly hard to move quietly. Even in stocking feet they made a\nsoft thud with each footfall.\n\nBut there was no sign of detection, no sound of alarm. Finally they came\nout into a large shaft which allowed them to stand upright, and they\nstopped to catch their breath.\n\n\"Main tube to the living quarters,\" Tom said when they had caught up to\nhim. \"Joins with the lower-level tube by a series of chutes. We've\nactually been circumnavigating the ship ... I wanted to get as far away\nfrom that lounge compartment as possible, in case they check up on you\nright away.\"\n\n\"We can't have much time,\" Johnny said. \"That second guard must have\nbeen coming to relieve the other, and when the first one doesn't report\nback, they'll smell something fishy.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey talked it over for a moment. Johnny had been careful to leave the\nhatchway into the corridor ajar before he climbed into the ventilator\nshaft, and then he had pulled the shaft snugly into place behind him.\nAnyone who came would find two unconscious guards, a burnt-out hole in\nthe wall, and the door unlocked.\n\n\"We'll hope that he takes things at face value, and assumes we're at\nlarge in the ship somewhere, for a while at least,\" Johnny said. \"That\nhole in the wall is going to set them back a couple of steps, too.\"\n\n\"But they'll sound the alarm, at least,\" Tom said.\n\n\"You bet they will! They'll have every man on the crew shaking down the\nship for us. But they may not think of the ventilators until they can't\nfind us anywhere else.\"\n\n\"But sooner or later they're bound to think of it.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" Johnny said. \"Unless they keep seeing us in the ship. The\nway I figure it, this crew has been on battle stations plenty of times.\nThey'll be able to search the whole ship in half an hour. We're just\ngoing to have to show ourselves ... at least enough to keep them\nsearching.\"\n\n\"Well, what if they do think of the ventilators?\" Greg said. \"They'd\nstill have a time finding us.\"\n\n\"Maybe, but don't underestimate Tawney. He might just mask up his crew\nand flood the tubes with cyanide.\"\n\nThey thought about that for a minute. There was no sound here but their\nown breathing, and the low chug-chug-chug of the pumps somewhere deep in\nthe ship. Momentarily they expected to hear the raucous clang of the\nalarm bell, as some crew member or another walked into the lounge and\nfound them gone. But so far there was no sign they had been discovered\nmissing. \"No,\" Johnny said finally, \"if we just hide out in here, and\nhope for a chance at one of the scout ships, they'll find us eventually.\nBut we've got three big advantages, if we can figure out how to use\nthem. That fancy gun, for one. A way to get around the ship, for\nanother ... and the fact that there's one more of us than they count on.\"\nHe flipped on his pocket flash, began drawing lines on the dusty floor of\nthe shaft. \"My idea is to keep them so busy fighting little fires that\nthey won't have a chance to worry about where the big one is.\"\n\nHe drew a rough outline-sketch of the organization of the ship. \"This\nlook right to you, from what you've seen?\" he asked Tom.\n\n\"Pretty much,\" Tom said. \"There are more connecting tubes.\"\n\n\"All the better. We want to get the generators with our little toy here\nfirst. That'll darken the ship, and put the blowers out of commission in\ncase they think of using gas. Also, it will cut out their computers and\nmissile-launching rigs, which might give us a chance to get a scout-ship\naway in one piece if we could get aboard one.\"\n\n\"All right, the generators are first,\" Tom said. \"But then what? There\nare four hundred men on this ship. They'll have every airlock triple\nguarded. They'll block us for sure.\"\n\n\"Not when we get through, they won't,\" Johnny grinned. \"We've got an old\nfriend aboard who's going to help us.\"\n\n\"_Friend?_\"\n\n\"Ever hear of panic?\" Johnny said. \"Just listen a minute.\"\n\nQuickly then, he outlined his plan. Tom and Greg listened, watched\nJohnny make marks with his finger in the dust. When he finished, Greg\nwhistled softly. \"You missed your life work,\" he said. \"You should have\ngone into crime.\"\n\n\"If I'd had a ghost to help me, I might have,\" Johnny said.\n\n\"It's perfect,\" Tom said, \"if it works. But it all depends on one\nthing ... keeping it rolling after we start....\"\n\nFor another five minutes they went over the details. Then Johnny clapped\nthem each on the shoulder. \"It's up to you two,\" he said. \"Let's go.\"\n\nThey moved down the large shaft to the place where it broke into several\nspurs. Johnny started down the chute toward the engine rooms; Tom and\nGreg headed in opposite directions toward the main body of the ship.\nJust as they broke up, they heard a muffled metallic sound from the\nnearest compartment grill.\n\nIt was the _clang-clang-clang_ of the orbit-ship's general alarm.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCrewmen stopped with food halfway to their mouths, jerked away from\ntables. Orders buzzed along a dozen wires, and section chiefs began\nreporting their battle-stations alert and ready. Finally Tawney snapped\non the general public address system speaker. \"Now get this,\" he roared.\n\"I want every inch of this ship searched ... every corridor, every\ncompartment. I want a special crew standing by for missile launching.\nI want double guards at every airlock. If they get a ship away from\nhere, the man who lets them through had better be dead when I find\nhim....\" He broke off, clutching the speaker until his voice was under\ncontrol again. \"All right, move. They're armed, but there's no place they\ncan go. Find them.\"\n\nA section-chief came back over the speaker. \"Dead or alive, boss?\"\n\n\"Alive, you idiot! At least the Hunter brat. I'll take the other one any\nway you can get him.\"\n\nHe switched off, and waited, pacing the control cabin like a caged\nanimal. Ten minutes later a buzzer sounded. \"Hydroponics, boss. All\nclear.\"\n\n\"No sign of them?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\nAnother buzz. \"Number seven ore hold. Nothing here.\"\n\nStill another buzz. \"Crew's quarters. Nothing, boss.\"\n\nOne by one the reports came in. Fuming, Tawney checked off the sections,\nwatched the net draw tighter throughout the ship. They were somewhere,\nthey _had_ to be....\n\nBut nobody seemed to find them.\n\nHe was buzzing for his first mate when the power went off. The lights\nwent out, the speaker went dead in his hand. The computers sighed\ncontentedly and stopped computing. Abruptly the emergency circuits went\ninto operation, flooding the darkness with harsh white lights. The\nintercom started buzzing again.\n\n\"Engine room, boss.\"\n\n\"What happened down there?\" Tawney roared.\n\nThe man sounded like he'd just run the mile. \"Generators,\" he panted.\n\"Blown out.\"\n\n\"Well, get somebody in there to fix them. Have a crew seal off the\narea....\"\n\n\"Can't, boss. Fix them, I mean.\"\n\n\"Why not? What have we got electricians for?\"\n\n\"There's nothing left to fix. The generators aren't wrecked ... they're\ndemolished....\"\n\n\"Then get the pair that did it....\"\n\n\"They're not here. We've been sealed up tight. There's no way anybody\ncould have gotten in here....\"\n\nAfter that, things began to get confusing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor a while Merrill Tawney thought that his crew was going crazy ... and\nthen he began to wonder if he were the one who was losing his mind.\n\nWhatever the case, Merrill Tawney was certain of one thing. The things\nthat were happening on his orbit-ship could not possibly be happening.\n\nA guard in one of the outer shell storage holds called in with a\ndisquieting report. Greg Hunter, it seemed, had just been spotted\nvanishing into one of the storage compartments from the main outer-shell\ncorridor. When the guard had broken through the jammed hatchway to\ncollar his trapped victim, there was no sign of the victim anywhere\naround.\n\nAt the same moment, a report came in from a guard on the opposite side\nof the ship. He had just spotted Greg Hunter _there_, it seemed, moving\ndown a spur corridor. The guard had held his fire (according to Tawney's\norders) and summoned help to corner the quarry ... but when help\narrived, the quarry had vanished.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFive minutes later the Hunter boy was discovered in the Hydroponics\nsection, busily reducing all the yeast vats to shambles with a curious\nweapon that seemed to eat holes in things. It ate the deck out from\nunder the guard's feet, sending him plunging through the floor into the\ngalley. By the time he had scrambled back again, the Hunter boy was\ngone, and a rapid move to seal off the region failed to turn him up\nagain. The guard was upset; Tawney was a great deal more upset, because\nat the time Greg Hunter was (reportedly) playing havoc with the\nyeast-vats in Hydroponics he was also (reportedly) knocking guards down\nlike ten-pins in the main corridor off the engine room while\nreinforcements tried to pin him down with a wide-beam stunner....\n\nQuite suddenly emergency circuits closed and lights flashed in the\ncontrol cabin, the special signal for a meteor-collision with the outer\nshell in No. 3 hold. Tawney signalled for the section chief frantically.\n\"What's happening down there?\"\n\n\"I can't talk,\" the section chief gasped. \"Gotta get into a suit, we're\nleaking in here....\"\n\n\"Well, plug up the hole!\"\n\n\"The hole's four feet wide, sir!\" There was a fit of coughing and the\ncontact broke. The signals for No. 4 hold and No. 5 hold were flashing\nnow; while the crew members in the vicinity scrambled for pressure suits\nsomeone systematically proceeded to blow holes in No. 9, No. 10 and No.\n11 holds....\n\nIt was impossible. The reports came in thick and fast. Greg Hunter\nwas in two places at once, and everywhere he went ... in both\nplaces ... there was a trail of unbelievable destruction. Bulkheads\ndemolished, gaping holes torn in the outer shell, the air-reconditioning\nunits smashed beyond repair.... Tawney buzzed for his first mate.\n\nAn emergency switch cut into the line, with the frantic voice of a\nsection chief. Johnny Coombs had been spotted disappearing into the\nventilator shaft in the engine sector. \"Well, go in after him!\" Tawney\nscreamed. He got his first mate finally, and snarled orders into the\nspeaker. \"They're in the ventilators. Get a crew in there and stop\nthem.\"\n\nBut it was dark in the ventilator shafts. No emergency lights in there.\nWorse, the crewmen were hearing the things that were being whispered\naround the ship. The ventilator shafts yawned menacingly before them;\nthey went in reluctantly. Once in the dark maze of tunnels,\nidentification was difficult. Two guards met each other headlong in the\ndarkness, and put each other out of the fight in a flurry of nervous\nstunner-fire. While they searched more of the holds were broken open,\nleaking air through gaping rents in the hull....\n\nTawney felt the panic spreading; he tried to curb it, and it spread in\nspite of him. The fugitives were appearing and disappearing like\nwraiths. Reports back to control cabin took on a frantic note, confused\nand garbled. Now the second-level bulkheads were being attacked. Over a\nthird of the compartments were leaking precious air into outer space.\n\nWhen a terrified section chief came through with a report that two Greg\nHunters had been spotted by the same man at the same time, and that the\nguards in the sector were shooting at anything that moved, including\nother guards, Tawney made his way to the radio cabin and put through a\nfrantic signal to Jupiter Equilateral headquarters on Mars.\n\nThe contact took forever, even with the ship's powerful emergency\nboosters. By the time someone at headquarters was reading him, Tawney's\nreport sounded confused. He was trying for the third time to explain,\nclearly and logically, how two men and a ghost were scuttling his\norbit-ship under his very feet when one wall of the cabin vanished in a\ncrackle of blue fire, and he found himself staring at two Greg Hunters\nand a grim-faced Johnny Coombs.\n\nHe made squeaky noises into the microphone and dropped it with a crash.\nHe groped for a chair; Johnny jerked him to his feet again. \"A\nscout-ship,\" he said tersely. \"Clear it for launching. We want one with\nplenty of fuel, and we don't want a single guard anywhere near the\nairlock.\" He picked up an intercom microphone and thrust it into the\nlittle fat man's trembling hand. \"Now move! And you'd better be sure\nthey understand you, because you're coming with us.\"\n\nMerrill Tawney stared first at Tom, then at Greg, and finally at the\nmicrophone. Then he moved. The orders he gave to his section chiefs were\nvery clear and concise.\n\nHe had never argued with a ghost before, and he didn't care to start\nnow.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was over so quickly that it seemed to Tom it had just begun, and if\nso much had not been at stake, it might have been fun.\n\nIt had been the gun ... the remarkable gun that Roger Hunter had left as\nhis legacy ... that had been the key. It ate through steel and aluminum\nalloy like putty. Whatever its power source, however it worked, by\nwhatever means it had been built, there had been no match for it on the\norbit-ship.\n\nIt had _worked_ ... and that was all that mattered right then.\n\nWith it, and with the advantage of a ghost that walked like a\nman ... Tom Hunter, to be exact ... they had reduced the Jupiter\nEquilateral orbit-ship to a smoking wreck in something less than thirty\nminutes.\n\nThe signal came back that a scout-ship was ready, unguarded. Johnny\nprodded Tawney with the stunner. \"You first,\" he said.\n\n\"But where are you taking me?\"\n\n\"You'll see,\" Johnny said.\n\n\"It was a trick,\" Tawney said, glaring at Tom. \"They told me they shot\nyour ship to pieces....\"\n\n\"The ship, yes,\" Tom said. \"Not me.\"\n\n\"Well ... well, that's good, that's good,\" Tawney said quickly. He\nturned to Greg. \"You don't have to take me back ... the bargain is still\ngood....\"\n\n\"Move,\" Johnny Coombs said.\n\nWith Tawney between them, Greg and Tom marched down the corridor toward\nthe airlock, with Johnny bringing up the rear. No one stopped them. No\none even came near them. One crewman stumbled on them in the corridor;\nhe saw Tawney with a gun in his back, and fled in terror.\n\nThey found the scout-ship, and strapped Tawney down to an accelleration\nbunk, binding his hands and feet so he couldn't move. Greg checked the\ncontrols while Tom and Johnny strapped down. A moment later the engines\nfired, and the leaking wreck of the orbit-ship fell away, dwindling and\ndisappearing in the blackness of space.\n\nIt was a quiet journey. The red dot that was Mars grew larger every\nhour. One of the three stayed awake at all times to watch Tawney while\nthe others slept. During the second rest period, Tom woke up while Greg\nwas on duty.\n\n\"How's our prisoner doing?\" Tom asked.\n\n\"No problem there, he can barely move. I almost wish he'd try something,\nhe's too quiet.\"\n\nIt was true. Tawney had recovered from his shock ... but rather than\ngrow more worried as Mars grew large on the screen, he seemed to become\nmore cheerful by the minute. \"He doesn't seem very worried, does he?\"\nTom said.\n\n\"No, and it doesn't quite add. We've got enough on him to get Jupiter\nEquilateral pushed right out of the Belt.\"\n\n\"I'd still feel better if we had the whole picture for the Major,\" Tom\nsaid. \"We still don't know what Dad found, or where he hid it....\"\n\nThe uneasiness grew. Tawney ignored them, staring at the image of the\nred planet on the viewscreen almost eagerly. Then, eight hours out of\nSun Lake City a U.N. Patrol ship appeared, moving toward them swiftly.\n\"Intercepting orbit,\" Greg said. \"Looks like they were waiting for us.\"\n\nThey watched as the big ship moved in to tangential orbit, matching its\nspeed to theirs. Then Greg snapped the communicator switch. \"Sound off,\"\nhe said cheerfully. \"We've got a prize for you.\"\n\n\"Stand by, we're boarding you,\" the Patrol sent back. \"And put your\nweapons aside.\"\n\nFour scooters broke from the side of the Patrol ship. Greg activated the\nairlock. Five minutes later a man in Patrol uniform with captain's bars\nstepped into the control cabin, a stunner on ready in his hand. Three\nPatrolmen came in behind him.\n\nThe captain looked around the cabin, then saw Tawney, and took a deep\nbreath. \"Well, thank the stars you're safe at any rate. Pete, Jimmy,\ntake the controls.\"\n\n\"Hold on,\" Greg said. \"We don't need a pilot.\"\n\nThe Captain looked at him. \"Sorry, but we're taking you in. There won't\nbe any trouble unless you make it. You three are under arrest, and I'm\nauthorized to make it stick if I have to. I suggest you just cooperate.\"\n\nThey stared at him. Then Johnny said, \"What are the charges?\"\n\n\"You ought to know,\" the Captain said. \"We have a formal complaint from\nthe main offices of Jupiter Equilateral, charging you with piracy,\nmurder, kidnapping of a company official, and totally wrecking a company\norbit ship. I don't quite see how you managed it, but we're going to\nfind out in short order.\"\n\nThere was a stunned silence in the cabin, and then a sound came from the\nrear of the cabin.\n\nMerrill Tawney was laughing.\n\n\n\n\n12. The Sinister Bonanza\n\n\nThey were taken to a small, drab internment room. A half hour passed and\nstill no word from the Major. From the moment the Patrol crew had\nboarded them, everything had seemed like a bad dream. The shock of the\narrest, the realization that the Captain had been serious when he reeled\noff the charges lodged against them ... they had been certain it was\nsome kind of ill-planned joke until they saw the delegation of Jupiter\nEquilateral officials waiting at the port to greet Merrill Tawney like a\nman returned from the dead. They had watched Tawney climb into the sleek\ncompany car and drive off toward the gate, while the Captain had\nescorted them without a word down to the internment rooms.\n\nThe door clicked, and the Captain looked in. \"All right, come along\nnow,\" he said.\n\n\"Is the Major here?\" Tom said.\n\n\"You'll see the Major soon enough.\" The Captain herded them into another\nroom, where a clerk efficiently fingerprinted them. Then they went down\na ramp to a jitney-platform, and boarded a U.N. official car. The trip\ninto the city was slow; rush-hour traffic from the port was heavy. When\nthey reached U.N. headquarters, there was another wait in an upper\nlevel ante-room. The Captain stood stiffly with his hands behind his\nback and ignored them.\n\n\"Look, this is ridiculous,\" Greg burst out finally. \"We haven't done\nanything. You haven't even let us make a statement.\"\n\n\"Make your statement to the Major. It's his headache, not mine, I'm\nhappy to say.\"\n\n\"But you let that man walk out of there scot free....\"\n\nThe Captain looked at him. \"If I were you,\" he said, \"I'd stop\ncomplaining and start worrying. If I had Jupiter Equilateral at my\nthroat, I'd worry plenty, because once they start they don't stop.\"\n\nA signal light blinked, and he took them downstairs. Major Briarton was\nbehind his desk; his eyes tired, his face grim. He dismissed the\nCaptain, and motioned them to seats. \"All right, let's have the story,\"\nhe said, \"and by the ten moons of Saturn it had better be convincing,\nbecause I've about had my fill of you three.\"\n\nHe listened without interruption as Tom told the story, with Greg and\nJohnny adding details from time to time. Tom told him everything, from\nthe moment they had blasted off for Roger Hunter's claim to the moment\nthe Patrol ship had boarded them, except for a single detail.\n\nHe didn't mention the remarkable gun from Roger Hunter's gun case. The\ngun was still in the spacer's pack he had slung over his shoulder; he\nhad not mentioned it when the Patrolmen had taken their stunners away.\nNow as he talked, he felt a twinge of guilt in not mentioning it....\n\nBut he had a reason. Dad had died to keep that gun secret. It seemed\nonly right to keep the secret a little longer. When he came to the part\nabout their weapons, he simply spoke of \"Dad's gun\" and omitted any\ndetails.\n\nAnd through the story, the Major listened intently, interrupting only\noccasionally, pulling at his lip and scowling.\n\n\"So we decided that the best way to convince you that we had the\nevidence you wanted was to bring Tawney back with us,\" Tom concluded.\n\n\"A brilliant maneuver,\" the Major said dryly. \"A real stroke of genius.\"\n\n\"But then the Patrol ship intercepted us and told us we were under\narrest. And when we landed, they let Tawney drive off without even\nquestioning him.\"\n\n\"The least we could do, under the circumstances,\" the Major said.\n\n\"Well, I'd like to know why,\" Greg broke in bitterly. \"Why pick on us?\nWe've just been telling you....\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, I heard every word of it,\" the Major sighed. \"If you knew the\ntrouble ... oh, what's the use? I've spent the last three solid hours\ntalking myself hoarse, throwing in every bit of authority I could\nmuster and jeopardizing my position as Coordinator here, for the sole\npurpose of keeping you three idiots out of jail for a few hours.\"\n\n\"Jail!\"\n\n\"That's what I said. The brig. The place they put people when they don't\nbehave. You three are sitting on a nice, big powder keg right now, and\nwhen it blows I don't know how much of you is going to be left.\"\n\n\"Do you think we're lying?\" Greg said.\n\n\"Do you know what you're charged with?\" the Major snapped back.\n\n\"Some sort of nonsense about piracy....\"\n\n\"Plus kidnapping. Plus murder. To say nothing of totally disabling a\nseventeen-million-dollar orbit-ship and placing the lives of four\nhundred crewmen in jeopardy.\" The Major picked up a sheet of paper from\nhis desk. \"According to Merrill Tawney's statement, the three of you\nhijacked a company scout-ship that chanced to be scouting in the\nvicinity of your father's claim. Your attack was unprovoked and violent.\nEverybody on Mars knows you were convinced that Jupiter Equilateral was\nresponsible for your father's death.\" He looked up. \"In the absence of\nany evidence, I might add, although I did my best to tell you that.\" He\nrattled the report-sheet. \"All right. You took the scout-ship by force,\nwith the pilot at gunpoint, and made him home in on his orbit-ship. Then\nyou proceeded to reduce that orbit-ship to a leaking wreck, although\nTawney tried to reason with you and even offered you amnesty if you\nwould desist. By the time the crew stopped shooting each other in the\ndark ... fifteen of them subsequently expired, it says here ... you had\nstolen another scout-ship and kidnapped Tawney for the purpose of\nextorting a confession out of Jupiter Equilateral, threatening him with\ntorture if he did not comply....\" The Major dropped the paper to the\ndesk.\n\nJohnny Coombs picked it up, looked at it owlishly, and put it back\nagain. \"Pretty large operation for three men, Major,\" he said.\n\nThe Major shrugged. \"You were armed. That orbit-ship was registered as a\ncommercial vessel. It had no reason to expect a surprise attack, and had\nno way to defend itself.\"\n\n\"They were armed to the teeth,\" Greg said disgustedly. \"Why don't you\nsend somebody out to look?\"\n\n\"Oh, I could, but why waste the time and fuel? There wouldn't be any\nweapons aboard.\"\n\n\"Then how do they explain the fact that the _Scavenger_ was blown to\nbits and Dad's orbit-ship ripped apart from top to bottom?\"\n\n\"Details,\" the Major said. \"Mere details. I'm sure that the company's\nlawyers can muddy the waters quite enough so that little details like\nthat are overlooked. Particularly with a sympathetic jury and a judge\nthat plays along.\"\n\nHe stood up and ran his hand through his hair. \"All right, granted I'm\npainting the worst picture possible ... but I'm afraid that's the way\nit's going to be. I believe your story, don't worry about that. I know\nwhy you went out there to the Belt and I can't really blame you, I\nsuppose. But you were asking for trouble, and that's what you got.\nFrankly, I am amazed that you ever returned to Mars, and how you managed\nto make rubble of an orbit-ship with a crew of four hundred men trying\nto stop you is more than I can comprehend. But you did it. All right,\nfine. You were justified; they attacked you, held you prisoner,\nthreatened you. Fine. They'd have cut your throats in another few hours,\nperhaps. Fine. I believe you. But there's one big question that you\ncan't answer, and unless you can no court in the Solar System will\nlisten to you.\"\n\n\"What question?\" Tom said.\n\n\"The question of motives,\" the Major replied. \"You had plenty of motive\nfor doing what Tawney says you did. But what motive did Jupiter\nEquilateral have, if your story is true?\"\n\n\"They wanted to get what Dad found, out in the Belt.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes, that mysterious bonanza that Roger Hunter found. I was afraid\nthat was what you'd say. And it's the reason that Jupiter Equilateral is\ngoing to win this fight, and you're going to lose it.\"\n\n\"I don't think I understand,\" Tom said slowly.\n\n\"I mean that I'm going to have to testify against you,\" the Major said.\n\"_Because your father didn't find a thing in the Asteroid Belt_, and I\nhappen to know it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"It's been a war,\" the Major said later, \"a dirty vicious war with no\nholds barred and no quarter given. Not a shooting war, of course,\nnothing out in the open ... but a war just the same, with the highest\nstakes of any war in history.\n\n\"It didn't look like a war, at first,\" the Major went on. \"Back when the\ncolonies were being built, nobody really believed that anything of value\nwould come of them ... scientific outposts, perhaps, places for\nlaboratories and observatories, not much more. The colonies were placed\nunder United Nations control. Nobody argued about it.\n\n\"And then things began to change. There was wealth out here ... and\nopportunities for power. With the overpopulation at home, Earth was\nlooking more and more to Mars and Venus for a place to move ... not tiny\ncolonies, but places for millions of people. And as Mars grew, Jupiter\nEquilateral grew.\"\n\n\"But it was just a mining company,\" Tom said.\n\n\"At first it was, but then its interests began to expand. The company\naccumulated wealth, unbelievable wealth, and it developed many friends.\nVery soon it had friends back on Earth fighting for it, and the United\nNations found itself fighting to stay on Mars.\"\n\n\"I don't see why,\" Tom said. \"The company already has half the mining\nclaims in the Belt....\"\n\n\"They aren't interested in the mining,\" the Major said. \"They have a\nmuch longer-range goal than that. The men behind Jupiter Equilateral are\nlooking ahead. They know that someday Earthmen are going to have to go\nto the stars for colonies ... it won't be a matter of choice after a\nwhile, they'll _have_ to go. Well, Jupiter Equilateral's terms are very\nsimple. They're perfectly willing to let the United Nations control\nthings on Earth. All they want is control of everything else. Mars, if\nthey can drive us out. Venus too, if it ever proves up for colonies. And\nif they can gain control of the ships that leave our Solar System for\nthe stars, they can build an empire, and they know it.\"\n\nThey were silent for a moment. Then Johnny Coombs said, \"Doesn't anybody\non Earth know about this?\"\n\n\"There are some who know ... but they don't see the danger. They think\nof Jupiter Equilateral as just another big company. So far U.N. control\nof Mars and Venus has held up, even though the pressure on the\nlegislators back on Earth has been getting heavier and heavier. Jupiter\nEquilateral won the greatest fight in its history when they limited U.N.\njurisdiction to Mars, and kept us out of the Belt. And now they hope to\nconvince the lawmakers that we're incompetent to administer the Martian\ncolonies and keep peace out here. If they succeed, we'll be called home\nin nothing flat; we've had to fight just to stay.\"\n\nThe Major spread his hands helplessly. \"Like I said, it's been a war.\nOur only hope was to prove that the company was using piracy and murder\nto gain control of the asteroids. We had to find a way to smash the\npicture they've been painting of themselves back on Earth as a big,\nbenevolent organization interested only in the best for Earth colonists\non the planets. We had to expose them before they had the Earth in\nchains ... not now, maybe not even a century from now, but sometime,\nyears from now, when the breakthrough to the stars comes and Earthmen\ndiscover that if they want to leave Earth they have to pay toll....\"\n\n\"They could never do that!\" Greg protested.\n\n\"They're doing it, son. And they're winning. We have been searching\ndesperately for a way to fight back, and that was where your father came\nin. He could see the handwriting, he knew what was happening. That was\nwhy he broke with the company and tried to organize a competing force\nbefore it was too late. And it was why he died in the Belt. He knew I\ncouldn't send an agent out there without unquestionable evidence of\nmajor crime of some sort or another. But a private citizen could go out\nthere, and if he happened to be working with the U.N. hand in glove,\nnobody could do anything about it.\"\n\n\"Then Dad was a U.N. agent?\"\n\n\"Oh, not officially. There's not a word in the records. If I were forced\nto testify under oath, I would have to deny any connection. But\nunofficially, he went out there to lay a trap.\"\n\nThe Major told them then. It had been an incredible risk that Roger\nHunter had taken, but the decision had been his. The plan was simple: to\ninvolve Jupiter Equilateral in a case of claim-jumping and piracy that\nwould hold up in court, pressed by a man who would not be intimidated\nand could not be bought out. Roger Hunter had made a trip to the Belt\nand come back with stories ... very carefully planted in just the right\nears ... of a fabulous strike. He knew that Jupiter Equilateral had\njumped a hundred rich claims in the past, forcing the independent miners\nto agree, frightening them into silence or disposing of them with\n\"accidents.\"\n\nBut this was one claim they were not going to jump. The U.N. cooperated,\nhelping him spread the story of his Big Strike until they were certain\nthat Jupiter Equilateral would go for the bait. Then Roger Hunter had\nreturned to the Belt, with a U.N. Patrol ship close by in case he needed\nhelp.\n\n\"We thought it would be enough,\" the Major said unhappily. \"We were\nwrong, of course. At first nothing happened ... not a sign of a company\nship, nothing. Your father contacted me finally. He was ready to give\nup. Somehow they must have learned that it was a trap. But they had just\nbeen careful, was all. They waited until our guard was down, and then\nmoved in fast and hit hard.\"\n\nHe sank down in his seat behind the desk, regarding the Hunter twins\nsadly. \"You know the rest. Perhaps you can see now why I tried to keep\nyou from going out there. There was no proof to uncover and no bonanza\nlode for you to find. There never was a bonanza lode.\"\n\nThe twins looked at each other, and then at the Major. \"Why didn't you\ntell us?\" Greg said.\n\n\"Would you have listened? Would telling you have kept you from going out\nthere? There was no point to telling you, I knew you would have to find\nout for yourselves, however painfully. But what I'm telling you now is\nthe truth.\"\n\n\"As far as it goes,\" Tom Hunter said. \"But if this is really the truth,\nthere's one thing that doesn't fit into the picture.\"\n\nSlowly Tom pulled the gun case from his pack and set it down on the\nMajor's desk. \"It doesn't explain what Dad was doing with this.\"\n\n\n\n\n13. Pinpoint in Space\n\n\nTom knew now that it was the right thing to do. There was no question,\nafter the Major's story, of what Dad had been doing out in the Belt at\nthe time he had been killed. He had been doing a job that was more\nimportant to him than asteroid mining ... but he had found something\nmore important than his own life, and had no chance to send word of what\nhe had found back to Major Briarton on Mars. That had been the\nunforeseeable part of the trap.\n\nBut now, of course, the Major had to know.\n\nThe Mars Coordinator looked at the thing on the desk for a long moment\nbefore he reached out to touch it. The bright metal gleamed in the\nlight, pale gray, lustrous. The Major picked it up, balanced it expertly\nin his hand, and a puzzled frown clouded his face. He examined it\nminutely.\n\n\"What is this thing?\" he said.\n\n\"Suppose you tell us,\" Johnny Coombs said from across the room.\n\n\"It looks like a gun.\"\n\n\"That's what it is, all right.\"\n\n\"You've fired it?\"\n\n\"Yes ... but I wouldn't fire it in here, if I were you,\" Johnny said.\n\"You were wondering how we wrecked Tawney's orbit-ship so thoroughly.\nThat's your answer right there.\" He told about the hole in the bulkhead,\nthe way the ship's generators had melted like clay under the powerful\nblast of the weapon.\n\nThe Major could hardly control his excitement. \"Where did you get it?\"\nhe asked, turning to Tom.\n\n\"From the space pack that you turned over to us. I didn't even look at\nit, until we needed a gun in a hurry. I just assumed it was Dad's\nrevolver.\"\n\n\"And your father found it somewhere in the Belt,\" the Major said softly.\nHe looked at the weapon again, shaking his head. \"There isn't any such\ngun,\" he said finally. \"These things you say it could do ... they would\nrequire energy enough to break down the cohesive forces of molecules.\nThere isn't any way we know of to harness that kind of energy and\nchannel it in a hand weapon. Nobody on Earth....\"\n\nHe broke off and stared at them.\n\n\"That's right,\" Johnny said. \"Nobody on Earth.\"\n\n\"You mean ... extraterrestrial?\"\n\n\"There isn't any other answer,\" Johnny said. \"_Look_ at the thing,\nMajor. _Feel_ it. Does it feel like it was made for a human hand? It\ndoesn't fit, it doesn't balance, you have to hold it with both hands to\naim it....\"\n\n\"_But where did it come from?_\" the Major said. \"We've never had\nvisitors from another star system ... not in the course of recorded\nhistory. And we know that Earthmen are the only intelligent creatures in\nour Solar System.\"\n\n\"You mean that they're the only ones _now_,\" Tom said.\n\n\"Or any other time.\"\n\n\"We don't know that, for sure,\" Tom said.\n\n\"Look, we've explored Venus, Mars, all the major satellites. If there\nhad ever been intelligence on any of them, we'd have known it.\"\n\n\"Maybe there was a planet that Earthmen haven't explored,\" Tom said.\n\"Even Dad tried to tell us that. The quotation from Kepler that he\nscribbled down in his log ... 'Between Jupiter and Mars I will put a\nplanet.' Why would Dad have written that? Unless he had suddenly\ndiscovered proof that there _had_ been a planet there?\"\n\n\"You mean this ... this gun,\" the Major said.\n\n\"And whatever else he found.\"\n\n\"But there's never been any proof of that theory ... not even a hint of\nproof.\"\n\n\"Maybe Dad found proof. There are hundreds of thousands of asteroid\nfragments out there in the Belt, and only a few hundred of them have\never been examined by men.\"\n\nOn the desk the strange weapon stared up at them. Evidence, mute\nevidence, and yet its very existence said more than a thousand words. It\nwas there. It could not be denied.\n\nAnd someone ... or _something_ ... had made it.\n\nSlowly the Major pulled himself to his feet. \"It must have happened\nafter his last message to me,\" he said. \"It wasn't part of the scheme we\nhad set up, but he made a strike just the same ... an archeological\nstrike ... and this gun was part of it.\" He picked up the weapon, turned\nit over in his hand. \"But it was days after that last message before his\nsignal went off, and the Patrol ship moved in.\"\n\n\"It makes sense,\" Johnny Coombs said. \"He found the gun, and something\nmore.\"\n\n\"Like what?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't even guess,\" Johnny said. \"A planet with a race of creatures\nintelligent enough and advanced enough to make a weapon like that ... it\ncould have been anything. But whatever it was, it must have scared him.\nHe must have known that a company ship might turn up any minute ... so\nhe hid whatever he had found, and all he dared to leave was a hint.\"\n\n\"And now it's vanished,\" the Major said. \"The big flaw in the whole\nidea. My Patrol ship found nothing when it searched the region. You\nlooked, and drew a blank. The company men scoured the area.\" He spread\nhis hands helplessly. \"You see, it just won't hold up, not a bit of it.\nEven with this gun, it won't hold up. We've got to find the answer.\"\n\n\"It's out there somewhere,\" Tom said doggedly. \"It's got to be.\"\n\n\"But _where_? Don't you see that everything hangs on that one thing? If\nwe could prove that your father found something just before he was\nkilled, we could tear Jupiter Equilateral's case against you into\nshreds. We could charge them with piracy and murder, and make it stick.\nWe could break their power once and for all ... but until we know what\nRoger Hunter found, we're helpless. They'll take you three to court, and\nI won't be able to stop them. And if you lose that case, it may mean the\nend of U.N. authority on Mars.\"\n\n\"Then there's just one thing to do,\" Johnny Coombs said. \"We've got to\nfind Roger Hunter's bonanza.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was almost midnight when they left the Major's office, a gloomy trio,\nwalking silently up the ramp to the Main Concourse, heading toward the\nliving quarters.\n\nThey had been talking with the Major for hours, going over every facet\nof the story, wracking their brains for the answer ... but the answer\nhad not come.\n\nRoger Hunter had found something, and hidden it so well that three\ngroups of searchers had failed to discover it. After seeing the gun, the\nMajor was convinced that there had indeed been a discovery made. But\nwhatever that discovery had been, it was gone as if it had never\nexisted ... as if by some sort of magic it had been turned invisible,\nor conjured away to another part of the Solar System.\n\nFinally, they had given up, at least for the moment. \"It has to be\nthere,\" the Major had said wearily. \"It hasn't vanished, or miraculously\nceased to exist. We know he was working on one claim, one asteroid.\nThere were no other asteroids in the region ... and even the ones within\nsuicide radius have been searched.\"\n\n\"It's there, all right,\" Tom said. \"We're missing something, that's\nall.\"\n\n\"But what? Asteroids have stable orbits. Nobody can just make one\ndisappear....\"\n\nThey had called it a night, finally.\n\nOnce home they found more bad news waiting. There were two messages on\nthe recordomat. The first was an official summons to appear before the\nUnited Nations Board of Investigations at 9:00 the following morning to\nanswer \"certain charges placed against the above named persons by the\nGoverning Board of Jupiter Equilateral Mining Industries, and by one\nMerrill Tawney, plaintiff, representing said Governing Board.\" They\nlistened to the plastic record twice. Then Greg tossed it down the waste\nchute.\n\nThe other message was addressed to Greg, from the Commanding Officer of\nProject Star-Jump. The message was very polite and regretful; it was\nalso very firm. The pressure of the work there, in his absence, made it\nnecessary for the Project to suspend Greg on an indefinite leave of\nabsence. Application for reinstatement could be made at a later date,\nbut acceptance could not be guaranteed....\n\n\"Well, I might have expected it,\" Greg said, \"after what the Major told\nus. The money for Star-Jump must have been coming from somewhere, and\nnow we know where. The company probably figures to lay claim on any\nstar-drive that's ever developed.\" He dropped the notice down the chute,\nand laughed. \"I guess I really asked for it.\"\n\n\"You mean I pushed you into it,\" Tom said bitterly. \"If I'd kept my big\nmouth shut at the very start of this thing, you'd have gone back to the\nProject and that would have been the end of it....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGreg looked at him. \"You big bum, do you think I really care?\" He\ngrinned. \"Don't feel too guilty, Twin. We've been back to back on this\none.\"\n\nHe pulled off his shirt and walked into the shower room. Johnny Coombs\nwas already stretched out on the sofa, snoring softly.\n\nQuite suddenly the room seemed hot and stuffy, oppressive. He couldn't\nmake his thoughts come straight. There had been too much thinking, too\nmuch speculation. Tom stood up and slipped on his jacket.\n\nHe had to walk, to move about, to try to think. He slipped open the\ndoor, and started for the ramp leading to the Main Concourse.\n\nThere was an answer, somewhere.\n\nHe walked on along the steel walkways, trying to clear his mind of the\ndoubts and questions that were plaguing him. At first he just wandered,\nbut presently he realized that he had a destination in mind.\n\nHe went up a ramp and across the lobby of the United Nations\nAdministration Building. He took a spur off the main corridor, and came\nto a doorway with a small circular staircase beyond it. At the bottom of\nthe stairs he opened a steel door and stepped into the Map Room.\n\nIt was a small darkened amphitheater, with a curving row of seats along\none wall. On either side were film viewers and micro-readers. And\ncurving around on the far wall, like a huge parabolic mirror, was the\nMap.\n\nTom had been here many times before, and always he gasped in wonder when\nhe saw the awesome beauty of the thing. Stepping into the Map Room was\nlike stepping into the center of a huge cathedral. Here was the glowing,\nmoving panorama of the Solar System spread out before him in a\nbreath-taking three-dimensional image. Standing here before the Map it\nseemed as if he had suddenly become enormous and omnipotent, hanging\nsuspended in the blackness of space and staring down at the Solar System\nfrom a vantage point a million miles away.\n\nOnce, Dad had told him, there had been a great statue in the harbor of\nOld New York which had been a symbol of freedom for strangers coming to\nthat city from across the sea, and a welcome for countrymen returning\nhome. And someday, he knew, this view of the Solar System would be\nwaiting to greet Earthmen making their way home from distant stars. The\nMap was only an image, a gift from the United Nations to the colonists\non Mars, but it reproduced the Solar System in the minutest detail that\nastronomers could make possible.\n\nIn the center, glowing like a thing alive, was the Sun, the hub of the\nmagnificent wheel. Around it, moving constantly in their orbits, were\nthe planets, bright points of light on the velvet blackness of the\nscreen. Each orbit was computed and held on the screen by the great\ncomputer in the vault below.\n\nBut there was more on the Map than the Sun and the planets, with their\nsatellites. Tiny green lights marked the Earth-Mars and the Earth-Venus\norbit-ships, moving slowly across the screen. Beyond Mars, a myriad of\ntiny lights projected on the screen, the asteroids. Without the\nmagnifier Tom could identify the larger ones ... Ceres, on the opposite\nside of the Sun from Mars now as it moved in its orbit; smaller Juno,\nand Pallas, and Vesta....\n\nFor each asteroid which had been identified, and its orbit plotted,\nthere was a pinpoint of light on the screen. For all its beauty, the Map\nhad a very useful purpose ... the registry and identification of\nasteroid claims among the miners of Mars. Each asteroid registered as a\nclaim showed up as a red pinpoint; unclaimed asteroids were white. But\neven with the advances of modern astronomy only a small percentage of\nthe existing asteroids were on the map, for the vast majority had never\nbeen plotted.\n\nTom moved up to the Map and activated the magnifier. Carefully he\nfocussed down on the section of the Asteroid Belt they had visited so\nrecently. Dozens of pinpoints sprang to view, both red and white, and\nbeneath each red light the claim-number neatly registered. Tom peered at\nthe section, searching until he found the number of Roger Hunter's last\nclaim.\n\nIt was quite by itself, not a part of an asteroid cluster. He stepped up\nthe magnification, peered at it closely. There were a dozen other\npinpoints, all unclaimed, within a ten-thousand-mile radius....\n\nBut near it, nothing....\n\nNo hiding place.\n\nAnd then, suddenly, he knew the answer. He stared at the Map, his heart\npounding in his throat. He cut the magnification, scanning a wide area.\nThen he widened the lens still further, and checked the coordinates at\nthe bottom of the viewer.\n\nHe knew that he was right. He _had_ to be right. But this was no wild\ndream, this was something that could be proved beyond any question of\nerror.\n\nAcross the room he picked up the phone to Map Control. It buzzed\ninterminably; then a sleepy voice answered.\n\n\"The Map,\" Tom managed to say. \"It's recorded on time-lapse film, isn't\nit?\"\n\n\"'Course it is,\" the sleepy voice said. \"Observatory has to have the\nrecord. One frame every hour....\"\n\n\"I've got to see some of the old film,\" Tom said.\n\n\"_Now?_ It's three in the morning.\"\n\n\"I don't need the film itself, just project it for me. There's a reader\nhere.\"\n\nHe gave the man the dates he wanted, Mars time. The man broke the\ncontact, grumbling, but moments later one of the film-viewers sprang to\nlife. The Map coordinates showed at the bottom of the screen.\n\nTom stared at the filmed image ... the image of a segment of the\nAsteroid Belt the day before Roger Hunter had died.\n\nIt was there. When he had looked at the Map, he had seen a single red\npinpoint of light, Roger Hunter's asteroid, with nothing in the heavens\nanywhere near it.\n\nBut on the film image taken weeks before there were two points of light.\nOne was red, with Roger Hunter's claim number beneath it. The other was\nwhite, so close to the first that even at full magnification it was\nbarely distinguishable.\n\n_But it was there._\n\nTom's hands were trembling with excitement; he nearly dropped the phone\nreceiver as he punched the buttons to ring the apartment. Greg's face\nappeared on the screen, puffy with sleep. \"What's that? Thought you were\nin bed....\"\n\n\"You've got to get down here,\" Tom said.\n\nGreg blinked, waking up. \"What's the matter? Where are you?\"\n\n\"In the Map Room. Wake Johnny up and get down here. And try to get hold\nof the Major.\"\n\n\"You've found something,\" Greg said, excited now.\n\n\"I've found something,\" Tom said. \"I've found where Dad hid his\nstrike ... and I know how we can find it! We've got the answer, Greg.\"\n\n\n\n\n14. The Missing Asteroid\n\n\nIt had been a wild twelve hours since Tom Hunter's call to his brother\nfrom the Map Room in Sun Lake City. The Major had arrived first, still\nbuttoning his shirt and wiping sleep from his eyes. Johnny and Greg came\nin on his heels. They had found Tom waiting for them, so excited he\ncould hardly keep his words straight.\n\nHe told them what he had found, and they wondered why they had not\nthought of it from the first moment. \"We knew there had to be an\nanswer,\" Tom said, \"some place Dad could have used for a hiding place,\nsome place nobody would even think to look. Dad must have realized that\nhe didn't have much time. When he saw his chance, he took it.\"\n\nAnd it was pure, lucky chance. Tom showed them the section of the Map he\nhad examined, with the pinpoint of light representing Roger Hunter's\nasteroid claim. Then the Map Control officer ... much more alert when he\nsaw Major Briarton ... brought an armload of films up and loaded them\ninto the projector. They stared at the screen, and saw the two pinpoints\nof light where one was now.\n\n\"What was the date of this?\" the Major asked sharply.\n\n\"Two days before Dad died,\" Tom said. \"There's quite a distance between\nthem there ... but watch. One frame for every hour. Watch what happens.\"\n\nHe began running the film, the record taken from the Map itself,\naccurate as clockwork. The white dot was moving in toward the red dot at\na forty-degree angle. For an instant it looked as though the two were\ncolliding ... and then the distance between them began to widen again.\nSlowly, hour by hour, the white dot was moving away, off the screen\naltogether....\n\nThe Major looked up at Tom and slammed his fist on the chair-arm. \"By\nthe ten moons of Saturn....\" he exploded, and then he was on his feet,\nshouting at the startled Map Control officer. \"Get me Martinson down\nhere, and fast. Call the port on a scrambled line and tell them to stand\nby with a ship on emergency call, with a crack interceptor pilot ready\nto go. Then get me the plotted orbits of every eccentric asteroid that's\ncrossed Mars' orbit in the last two months. And double-A security on\neverything ... we don't want to let Tawney get wind of this....\"\n\nLater, while they waited, they went over it to make sure that nothing\nwas missing. \"No wonder we couldn't spot it,\" the Major said. \"We were\nlooking for an asteroid in a standard orbit in the Belt.\"\n\n\"But there wasn't any,\" Tom said. \"Dad's rock was isolated, nowhere near\nany others. And we were so busy thinking of the thousands of rocks in\nnormal orbits between Mars and Jupiter that we forgot that there are a\nfew eccentric ones that just don't travel that way.\"\n\n\"Like this one.\" The Major stared at the screen. \"A long, intersecting\norbit. It must swing out almost to Jupiter's orbit at one end, and come\nclear in to intersect Earth's orbit at the other end....\"\n\n\"Which means that it cuts right through the Asteroid Belt and on out\nagain.\" Tom grinned. \"Dad must have seen it coming ... must have thought\nit was on collision course for a while. But he also must have realized\nthat if he could hide something on its surface as it came near, it would\nbe carried clear out of the Belt altogether in a few days' time.\"\n\n\"And if we can follow it up and intercept it....\" The Major was on his\nfeet, talking rapidly into the telephone. Sleep was forgotten now,\nnothing mattered but pinpointing a tiny bit of rock speeding through\nspace. Within an hour the asteroid had been identified, its eccentric\norbit plotted. The coordinates were taped into the computers of the\nwaiting Patrol ship, as the preparations for launching were made.\n\nIt could not be coincidence. Somewhere on the surface of that tiny\nplanetoid racing in toward the Sun they knew they would find Roger\nHunter's secret.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBelow them, as they watched, the jagged surface of the asteroid drew\ncloser.\n\nIt was not round ... it was far too tiny a bit of cosmic debris to have\nsufficient gravity to crush down rocks and round off ragged corners. It\nwas roughly oblong in shape, and one side was sheer smooth rock surface.\nThe other side was rough, bristling with jutting rock. More than\nanything else it looked like a ragged mountain top, broken off at the\npeak and hurled into space by an all-powerful hand.\n\nSlowly the scout-ship moved closer, braking with its forward jets. The\npilot was expert. Carefully and surely he aligned the ship with the rock\nin speed and direction. In the accelleration cot Tom could feel only an\noccasional gentle tug as the power cut on and off.\n\nThen the Lieutenant said, \"I think we can make a landing now, Major.\"\n\n\"Fine. Take a scooter down first, and carry a guy line.\"\n\nThey unstrapped, and changed into pressure suits. In the airlock they\nwaited until the Lieutenant had touched the scooter down. Then Major\nBriarton nodded, and they clamped their belts to the guy line.\n\nOne by one they leaped down toward the rock.\n\nFrom a few miles out in space, the job of searching the surface had not\nappeared difficult. From the rock itself, things looked very different.\nThere was no way, from the surface, to scan large areas, and the surface\nwas so rough that they had to take constant care not to damage their\nboots or rip holes in their suits. There were hundreds of crevices and\ncaves, half concealed by the loose rock that crumbled under their feet\nas they moved.\n\nThey spread out from the scooter for an hour of fruitless searching. Tom\nspent most of the time pulling his boots free of surface cracks and\npicking his way over heaps of jagged rock. None of them got farther than\na hundred yards from the starting place. None of them found anything\nremarkable.\n\n\"We could spend weeks covering it this way,\" Greg said when they met at\nthe scooter again. \"Why don't I take the scooter and criss-cross the\nwhole surface at about fifty feet? If I spot anything, I'll yell.\"\n\nIt seemed like a good idea. Greg strapped himself into the scooter's\nsaddle, straddling the fuel tanks, using the hand jet to guide himself\nas he lifted lightly off the surface. He disappeared over the horizon of\nrock, then reappeared as he moved over the surface and back.\n\nTom and Johnny waited with the Major. Twenty minutes later Greg brought\nthe tiny craft back again. \"It's no good,\" he said. \"I've scanned the\nwhole bright-side, came as close as I dared.\"\n\n\"No sign of anything?\" Johnny said.\n\n\"Not a thing. The dark side looks like a sheer slab, from what my lights\nshow. If we only had some idea what we were looking for....\"\n\n\"Maybe you weren't close enough,\" Tom said. \"Why not drop each of us off\nto take a quarter of the bright-side and work our way in?\"\n\nThe others agreed. Tom waited until the Major and Johnny had been\nposted; then he hopped on the scooter behind Greg and dropped off almost\nat the line of darkness, where the sheer slab began. All of them had\nhoped that there might be a sign, something that Roger Hunter might have\nleft to mark his cache, but if there was one none of them spotted it.\nTom checked with the others by the radio in his helmet, and started\nmoving back toward the center of the bright side.\n\nAn hour later he was only halfway to the center, and he was nearly\nexhausted. At a dozen different spots he thought he had found a\npromising cleft in the rock, a place where something might have been\nconcealed ... but exploration of the clefts proved fruitless.\n\nAnd now his confidence began to fail. Supposing he had been wrong? They\nknew the rock had passed very close to Roger Hunter's asteroid, the\nastronomical records proved that. But suppose Dad had not used it as his\nhiding place at all? He pulled himself around another jagged rock shelf,\nstaring down at the rough asteroid surface beyond....\n\nAt the base of the rock shelf, something glinted in the sunlight. He\nleaped down, and thrust his hand into a small crevice in the rock. His\nhand closed on a small metal object.\n\nIt was a gun. It felt well balanced, familiar in his hand ... the\nrevolver Dad had always carried in his gun case.\n\nHe had to let them know. He was just snapping the speaker switch when he\nheard a growl of static in his earphones, and then Greg's voice,\nhigh-pitched and excited. \"Over here! I think I've found something!\"\n\nIt took ten minutes of scrambling over the treacherous surface to reach\nGreg. Tom saw his brother tugging at a huge chunk of granite that was\nwedged into a crevice in the rock. Tom got there just as the Major and\nJohnny topped a rise on the other side and hurried down to them.\n\nThe rock gave way, rolling aside, and Greg reached down into the\ncrevice. Tom leaned over to help him. Between them they lifted out the\nthing that had been wedged down beneath the boulder.\n\nIt was a metal cylinder, four feet long, two feet wide, and bluntly\ntapered at either end. In the sunlight it gleamed like polished silver,\nbut they could see a hairline break in the metal encircling the center\nportion.\n\nThey had found Roger Hunter's bonanza.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the cabin of the scout-ship they broke the cylinder open into two\nperfect halves. It came apart easily, a shell of paper-thin but\nremarkably strong metal, protecting the tightly packed contents.\n\nThere was no question what the cylinder was, even though there was\nnothing inside that looked even slightly familiar at first examination.\nThere were several hundred very tiny thin discs of metal that fit on the\nspindle of a small instrument that was packed with them. There were\nspools of film, thin as tissue but amazingly strong. Examined against\nthe light in the cabin, the film seemed to carry no image at all ... but\nthere was another small machine that accepted the loose end of the film,\nand a series of lenses that glowed brightly with no apparent source of\npower. There was a thick block of shiny metal covered on one side with\nalmost invisible scratches....\n\nA time capsule, beyond doubt. A confusing treasure, at first glance, but\nthe idea was perfectly clear. A hard shell of metal protecting the\nrecords collected inside....\n\n_Against what? A planetary explosion? Some sort of cosmic disaster that\nhad blown a planet and its people into the fragments that now filled the\nAsteroid Belt?_\n\nAt the bottom of the cylinder was a small tube of metal. They examined\nit carefully, trying to guess what it was supposed to be. At the bottom\nwas a tiny stud. When they pressed it, the cylinder began to expand and\nunfold, layer upon layer of thin glistening metallic material that\nspread out into a sheet that stretched halfway across the cabin.\n\nThey stared down at it. The metal seemed to have a life of its own,\nglowing and glinting, focussing light into pinpoints on its surface.\n\nIt was a map.\n\nAt one side, a glowing ball with a fiery corona, an unmistakeable\nsymbol that any intelligent creature in the universe that was able to\nperceive it at all would recognize as a star. Around it, in clearly\nmarked orbits, ten planets. The third planet had a single satellite, the\nfourth two tiny ones. The sixth eleven. The seventh planet had ten, and\nwas encircled by glowing rings.\n\nBut the fifth planet was broken into four parts.\n\nBeyond the tenth planet there was nothing across a vast expanse of the\nmap ... but at the far side was another star symbol, this one a double\nstar with four planetary bodies.\n\nThey stared at the glowing map, speechless. There could be no mistaking\nthe meaning of the thing that lay before them, marked in symbols that\ncould mean only one thing to any intelligence that could recognize stars\nand planets.\n\nBut in the center of the sheet was another symbol. It lay halfway\nbetween the two Solar Systems, in the depths of interstellar space. It\nwas a tiny picture, a silvery sliver of light, but it too was\nunmistakeable.\n\nIt could be nothing else but a Starship.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLater, as they talked, they saw that the map had told each of them,\nindividually, the same thing. \"They had a star-drive,\" Tom said.\n\"Whatever kind of creatures they were, and whatever the disaster that\nthreatened their planet, they had a star-drive to take them out of the\nSolar System to another star.\"\n\n\"But why leave a record?\" Greg wanted to know. \"If nobody was here to\nuse it....\"\n\n\"Maybe for the same reason that Earthmen bury time capsules with records\nof their civilization,\" Major Briarton said. \"I'd guess that the records\nhere will tell, when they have been studied and deciphered. Perhaps\nthere was already some sign of intelligent life developing elsewhere in\nthe Solar System. Perhaps they hoped that some of their own people would\nsurvive. But they had a star-drive, so some of them must have escaped.\nAnd with the record here....\"\n\n\"We may be able to follow them,\" Greg said.\n\n\"If we can decipher the record,\" Johnny Coombs said. \"But we don't have\nany clue to their language.\"\n\n\"Did you have any trouble understanding what the map had to say?\" the\nMajor said quietly.\n\n\"No....\"\n\n\"I don't think the rest will be much more difficult. They were\nintelligent creatures. The record will be understandable, all right.\" He\nstarted to fold the map back into a tube again. \"Maybe Roger Hunter\ntried to use the film projector. We'll never know. But he must have\nrealized that he had discovered the secret of a star-drive. He realized\nthat the United Nations were the ones to explore it and use it, and he\ngave his life to keep it out of the hands of Tawney and his men....\"\n\n\"A pity,\" a cold voice said close behind them, \"that he didn't succeed,\nafter all.\"\n\nThey whirled. In the hatchway to the after-cabin, Merrill Tawney was\nstanding, with a smile on his lips and a Markheim stunner trained\ndirectly on Major Briarton's chest.\n\n\n\n\n15. The Final Move\n\n\n\"I realize I'm much earlier than you expected, Major. You did a very\nneat job of camouflaging your takeoff ... we were almost fooled ... and\nno doubt the dummy ship you sent off later got full fanfare. I suppose\nthere will be a dozen Patrol ships converging on this spot in a few\nhours, expecting to surprise a Jupiter Equilateral ship making a\ndesperate attempt to hijack your little treasure here.\"\n\nThe little fat man laughed cheerfully. \"Unfortunately for you,\" he\nadded, \"we have many friends on Mars ... including a man in the Map\nroom ... and I'm afraid your little trap isn't going to work after all.\"\n\nThe Major's face was gray. \"How did you get here?\"\n\n\"By hitch-hiking. How else? Most uncomfortable, back there, even with a\npile of pressure suits for padding, but your pilot was really very\nskillful.\"\n\nJohnny Coombs turned on the Major. \"What does he mean, a trap? I don't\nget this....\"\n\nThe Major sighed wearily. \"I had to try to force his hand. Even if we\nfound what we were looking for, we had no case that could stand up\nagainst them. We needed _proof_ ... and I thought that with this as bait\nwe could trap them. He's right about the Patrol ships ... but they won't\nbe near for hours.\"\n\n\"And that will be a little late to help,\" Tawney said pleasantly.\n\nThe Major glared at him. \"Maybe so ... but you've gone too far this\ntime. This is an official U.N. ship. You'll never be able to go back to\nMars.\"\n\n\"Really?\" the fat man said. \"And why not? Officially I'm on Mars right\nnow, with plenty of people to swear to the fact.\" He chuckled. \"You seem\nto forget that little matter of proof, Major. When your Patrol ships\nfind a gutted ship and five corpses, they may suspect that something\nmore than an accident was involved, but what can they prove? Nothing\nmore than they could prove in the case of Roger Hunter's accident.\nScout-ships have been known to explode before.\"\n\nHe ran his hand over the metal cylinder. \"And as for this ... it's\nreally a surprise. Of course when we failed to find any evidence of\nmining activity, we were certain that Roger Hunter's bonanza was\nsomething more than a vein of ore, but _this_! You can be certain that\nwe will exploit the secret of a star-drive to the very fullest.\"\n\n\"How do you think you can get away with it?\" the Major said. \"Turning up\nwith something like that right after a whole series of suspicious\naccidents in space?\"\n\n\"Oh, we aren't as impatient as some people. We wouldn't be so foolish as\nto break the news now. Five years from now, maybe ten years, one of our\norbit-ships will happen upon a silvery capsule on one of our asteroid\nclaims, that's all. I wouldn't be surprised if a non-company observer\nmight be on board at the time, maybe even a visiting Senator from Earth.\nFor something this big, we can afford to be patient.\"\n\nThere was silence in the little scout-ship cabin. The end seemed\ninevitable. This was a desperate move on Tawney's part. He was gambling\neverything on it; he would not take the chance of letting any of them\nreturn to Mars or anywhere else to testify.\n\nGreg caught Tom's eye, saw the hopelessness on his brother's face. He\nclenched his fists angrily at his side. If it were not for Tom, Dad's\nbonanza might have gone on circling the sun for centuries, maybe\nforever, wedged in its hiding place on the rocky surface of the\neccentric asteroid.\n\nBut it had been found. Earth needed a star-drive badly; a few more\nyears, and the need would be desperate. And if a group of power-hungry\nmen could control a star-drive and hold it for profit, they could\nblackmail an entire planet for centuries, and build an empire in space\nthat could never be broken.\n\nHe knew that it must not happen that way. Dad had died to prevent it.\nNow it was up to them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGreg glanced quickly around the cabin, searching for some way out,\nsomething that might give them a chance. His eyes stopped on the control\npanel, and he sucked in his breath, his heart pounding. A\npossibility....\n\nIt would require a swift, sure move, and someone to help, someone with\nfast reflexes. It was dangerous; they might all be killed. But if his\ntraining at Star-jump was good for anything, it might work.\n\nHe caught Johnny Coombs' eye, winked cautiously. A frown creased\nJohnny's forehead. He shot a quick look at Tawney, then lowered his\neyelid a fraction of an inch. Greg could see the muscles of his\nshoulders tightening.\n\nGreg took quick stock of the cabin again. Then he took a deep breath and\nbellowed, \"Johnny ... _duck_!\"\n\nAlmost by reflex, Johnny Coombs hurled himself to the floor. Tawney\nswung the gun around. There was an ugly ripping sound as the stunner\nfired ... but Greg was moving by then. In two bounds he was at the\ncontrol panel. He hooked an arm around a shock bar, and slammed the\ndrive switch on full.\n\nThere was a roar from below as the engines fired. Greg felt a jolt of\npain as the accelleration jerked at his arm. Tom and the Major were\nslammed back against a bulkhead, then fell in a heap on top of Johnny\nand the Lieutenant as the awful force of the accelleration dragged them\nback. Across the cabin Tawney sprawled on the floor. The stunner flew\nfrom his hand and crashed against the rear bulkhead.\n\nOn the panel Greg could see the accelleration gauge climbing\nswiftly ... past four g's, up to five, to six. The ship was moving\nwildly; there was no pilot, no course.\n\nWith all the strength he could muster Greg tightened his arm on the\nshock bar, lifting his other arm slowly toward the cut-off switch. He\nhad spent many hours in the accelleration centrifuge at Star-Jump,\nlearning to withstand and handle the enormous forces of accelleration\nfor brief periods, but the needle was still climbing and he knew he\ncould not hold on long. His fingers touched the control panel. He\nstrained, inching them up toward the switch....\n\nHis fingers closed on the stud, and he pulled. The engine roar ceased.\nOn the floor behind him Tawney moved sluggishly, trying to sit up. Blood\nwas dripping from his nose. He was still too stunned to know what had\nhappened.\n\nGreg leaped across the room, caught up the stunner, and then sank to the\nfloor panting. \"All right,\" he said as his breath came back, \"that's\nall. Your ship may have trouble finding us now ... but I bet our pilot\ncan get us back to Mars.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen they left the Sun Lake City infirmary it was almost noon, and the\nred sun was gleaming down from overhead. Walking slowly, the Hunter\ntwins moved along the surface street toward the U.N. building.\n\n\"He'll recover without any trouble,\" the doctor had assured them. \"He\ncaught the stunner beam in the shoulder, and it will be a while before\nhe can use it, but Johnny Coombs will be hard to keep down.\"\n\nThey had promised Johnny to return later. They had had check-ups\nthemselves. Both Tom's eyes were surrounded by purple splotches, and his\nbroken left arm was in a sling. Greg's arms and legs were so stiff he\ncould hardly move them. The Major and the Lieutenant had been sore but\nuninjured.\n\nNow the boys walked without talking. Already a U.N. linguist was at work\non the record tapes from the metal cylinder, and a mathematician was\ndoing a preliminary survey on the math symbols on the metal block.\n\n\"I hope there's no trouble reading them,\" Greg said.\n\n\"There won't be. It'll take time, but the records are decipherable. And\nDr. Raymond was certain that the engineering can be figured out. Earth\nis going to get her star-ship, all right.\"\n\n\"And we've got work to do.\"\n\n\"You mean the trial? I guess. The Major says that Jupiter Equilateral is\ntrying to pin the whole thing on Tawney now. They won't get away with\nit, but it may be nasty just the same.\"\n\n\"Well, one thing's sure ... there'll be some changes made, with the U.N.\nmoving out into the Belt,\" Greg said.\n\nSomewhere in the distance the twins heard the rumble of engines. They\nstopped and watched as a great silvery cargo ship lifted from the space\nport and headed up into the dark blue sky. They watched it until it\ndisappeared from sight.\n\nThey were both thinking the same thing.\n\nAn Earth-bound ship, powerful and beautiful, but limited now to the sun\nand nine planets, unable to reach farther out.\n\nBut someday soon a different kind of ship would rise.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Gold in the Sky, by Alan Edward Nourse\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK GOLD IN THE SKY ***\n\n***** This file should be named 23882.txt or 23882.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/3/8/8/23882/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
