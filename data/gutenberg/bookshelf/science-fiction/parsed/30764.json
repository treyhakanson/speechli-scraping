He was almost half an hour late for the regular Sunday night\nmeeting of advanced students; and even Mavis Greenfield, Dr. Ormond's\nsecretary, who always stayed for a while at her desk in the hall to\nsign in the stragglers, had disappeared. However, she had left the\nattendance book lying open on the desk with a pen placed invitingly\nbeside it.\n\nWallace Cavender dutifully entered his name in the book. The distant\ndeep voice of Dr. Aloys Ormond was dimly audible, coming from the\ndirection of the lecture room, and Cavender followed its faint\nreverberations down a narrow corridor until he reached a closed door.\nHe eased the door open and slipped unobtrusively into the back of the\nlecture room.\n\nAs usual, most of the thirty-odd advanced students present had seated\nthemselves on the right side of the room where they were somewhat\ncloser to the speaker. Cavender started towards the almost vacant rows\nof chairs on the left, smiling apologetically at Dr. Ormond who, as\nthe door opened, had glanced up without interrupting his talk. Three\nother faces turned towards Cavender from across the room. Reuben\nJeffries, a heavyset man with a thin fringe of black hair circling an\notherwise bald scalp, nodded soberly and looked away again. Mavis\nGreenfield, a few rows further up, produced a smile and a reproachful\nlittle headshake; during the coffee break she would carefully explain\nto Cavender once more that students too tardy to take in Dr. Al's\nintroductory lecture missed the most valuable part of these meetings.\n\nFrom old Mrs. Folsom, in the front row on the right, Cavender's\nbelated arrival drew a more definite rebuke. She stared at him for\nhalf a dozen seconds with a coldly severe frown, mouth puckered in\ndisapproval, before returning her attention to Dr. Ormond.\n\nCavender sat down in the first chair he came to and let himself go\ncomfortably limp. He was dead-tired, had even hesitated over coming to\nthe Institute of Insight tonight. But it wouldn't do to skip the\nmeeting. A number of his fellow students, notably Mrs. Folsom, already\nregarded him as a black sheep; and if enough of them complained to Dr.\nOrmond that Cavender's laxness threatened to retard the overall\nadvance of the group towards the goal of Total Insight, Ormond might\ndecide to exclude him from further study. At a guess, Cavender thought\ncynically, it would have happened by now if the confidential report\nthe Institute had obtained on his financial status had been less\nimpressive. A healthy bank balance wasn't an absolute requirement for\nmembership, but it helped ... it helped! All but a handful of the\nadvanced students were in the upper income brackets.\n\nCavender let his gaze shift unobtrusively about the group while some\nalmost automatic part of his mind began to pick up the thread of Dr.\nAl's discourse. After a dozen or so sentences, he realized that the\nevening's theme was the relationship between subjective and objective\nreality, as understood in the light of Total Insight. It was a\nwell-worn subject; Dr. Al repeated himself a great deal. Most of the\naudience nevertheless was following his words with intent interest,\nmany taking notes and frowning in concentration. As Mavis Greenfield\nliked to express it, quoting the doctor himself, the idea you didn't\npick up when it was first presented might come clear to you the fifth\nor sixth time around. Cavender suspected, however, that as far as he\nwas concerned much of the theory of Total Insight was doomed to remain\nforever obscure.\n\nHe settled his attention on the only two students on this side of the\nroom with him. Dexter Jones and Perrie Rochelle were sitting side by\nside in front-row chairs--the same chairs they usually occupied during\nthese meetings. They were exceptions to the general run of the group\nin a number of ways. Younger, for one thing; Dexter was twenty-nine\nand Perrie twenty-three while the group averaged out at around\nforty-five which happened to be Cavender's age. Neither was blessed\nwith worldly riches; in fact, it was questionable whether the Rochelle\ngirl, who described herself as a commercial artist, even had a bank\naccount. Dexter Jones, a grade-school teacher, did have one but was\nable to keep it barely high enough to cover his rent and car payment\nchecks. Their value to the Institute was of a different kind. Both\npossessed esoteric mental talents, rather modest ones, to be sure, but\nstill very interesting, so that on occasion they could state\naccurately what was contained in a sealed envelope, or give a\nrecognizable description of the photograph of a loved one hidden in\nanother student's wallet. This provided the group with encouraging\nevidence that such abilities were, indeed, no fable and somewhere\nalong the difficult road to Total Insight might be attained by all.\n\nIn addition, Perrie and Dexter were volunteers for what Dr. Aloys\nOrmond referred to cryptically as \"very advanced experimentation.\" The\ngroup at large had not been told the exact nature of these\nexperiments, but the implication was that they were mental exercises\nof such power that Dr. Al did not wish other advanced students to try\nthem, until the brave pioneer work being done by Perrie and Dexter was\nconcluded and he had evaluated the results....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Headaches, Dr. Al,\" said Perrie Rochelle. \"Sometimes quite bad\nheadaches--\" She hesitated. She was a thin, pale girl with untidy\narranged brown hair who vacillated between periods of vivacious\nalertness and activity and somewhat shorter periods of blank-faced\nwithdrawal. \"And then,\" she went on, \"there are times during the day\nwhen I get to feeling sort of confused and not quite sure whether I'm\nasleep or awake ... you know?\"\n\nDr. Ormond nodded, gazing at her reflectively from the little lectern\non which he leaned. His composed smile indicated that he was not in\nthe least surprised or disturbed by her report on the results of the\nweek's experiments--that they were, in fact, precisely the results he\nhad expected. \"I'll speak to you about it later, Perrie,\" he told her\ngently. \"Dexter ... what experiences have you had?\"\n\nDexter Jones cleared his throat. He was a serious young man who\nappeared at meetings conservatively and neatly dressed and shaved to\nthe quick, and rarely spoke unless spoken to.\n\n\"Well, nothing very dramatic, Dr. Al,\" he said diffidently. \"I did\nhave a few nightmares during the week. But I'm not sure there's any\nconnection between them and, uh, what you were having us do.\"\n\nDr. Ormond stroked his chin and regarded Dexter with benevolence. \"A\nconnection seems quite possible, Dexter. Let's assume it exists. What\ncan you tell us about those nightmares?\"\n\nDexter said he was afraid he couldn't actually tell them anything. By\nthe time he was fully awake he'd had only a very vague impression of\nwhat the nightmares were about, and the only part he could remember\nclearly now was that they had been quite alarming.\n\nOld Mrs. Folsom, who was more than a little jealous of the special\nattention enjoyed by Dexter and Perrie, broke in eagerly at that point\nto tell about a nightmare _she'd_ had during the week and which _she_\ncould remember fully; and Cavender's attention drifted away from the\ntalk. Mrs. Folsom was an old bore at best, but a very wealthy old\nbore, which was why Dr. Ormond usually let her ramble on a while\nbefore steering the conversation back to the business of the meeting.\nBut Cavender didn't have to pretend to listen.\n\nFrom his vantage point behind most of the group, he let his gaze and\nthoughts wander from one to the other of them again. For the majority\nof the advanced students, he reflected, the Institute of Insight\nwasn't really too healthy a place. But it offered compensations.\nMiddle-aged or past it on the average, financially secure, vaguely\ndisappointed in life, they'd found in Dr. Al a friendly and eloquent\nguide to lead them into the fascinating worlds of their own minds. And\nDr. Al was good at it. He had borrowed as heavily from yoga and\nwestern mysticism as from various orthodox and unorthodox\npsychological disciplines, and composed his own system, almost his own\ncosmology. His exercises would have made conservative psychiatrists\nshudder, but he was clever enough to avoid getting his flock into too\nserious mental difficulties. If some of them suffered a bit now and\nthen, it made the quest of Total Insight and the thought that they\nwere progressing towards that goal more real and convincing. And\nmeeting after meeting Dr. Al came up with some intriguing new twist or\ndevice, some fresh experience to keep their interest level high.\n\n\"Always bear in mind,\" he was saying earnestly at the moment, \"that an\nadvance made by any member of the group benefits the group as a whole.\nThus, because of the work done by our young pioneers this week I see\nindications tonight that the group is ready to attempt a new\nexperiment ... an experiment at a level I frankly admit I hadn't\nanticipated you would achieve for at least another two months.\"\n\nDr. Ormond paused significantly, the pause underlining his words.\nThere was an expectant stirring among the students.\n\n\"But I must caution you!\" he went on. \"We cannot, of course, be\ncertain that the experiment will succeed ... in fact, it would be a\nvery remarkable thing if it did succeed at a first attempt. But if it\nshould, you will have had a rather startling experience! You will have\nseen a thing generally considered to be impossible!\"\n\nHe smile reassuringly, stepping down from the lectern. \"Naturally,\nthere will be no danger. You know me well enough to realize that I\nnever permit the group or individuals to attempt what lies beyond\ntheir capability.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCavender stifled a yawn, blinked water from his eyes, watching Ormond\nwalk over to a small polished table on the left side of the room in\nfront of the rows of chairs. On it Mavis Greenfield had placed a\nnumber of enigmatic articles, some of which would be employed as props\nin one manner or another during the evening's work. The most prominent\nitem was a small suitcase in red alligator hide. Dr. Ormond, however,\npassed up the suitcase, took a small flat wooden plate from the table\nand returned to the center of the room.\n\n\"On this,\" he said, holding up the plate, \"there rests at this moment\nthe air of this planet and nothing else. But in a minute or two--for\neach of you, in his or her world of subjective reality--something else\n_will_ appear on it.\"\n\nThe students nodded comprehendingly. So far, the experiment was on\nfamiliar ground. Dr. Ormond gave them all a good-humored wink.\n\n\"To emphasize,\" he went on, \"that we deal here with practical,\ndown-to-earth, _real_ matters ... not some mystical nonsense ... to\nemphasize that, let us say that the object each of you will visualize\non this plate will be--a ham sandwich!\"\n\nThere were appreciative chuckles. But Cavender felt a twinge of\nannoyance. At the moment, when along with fighting off fatigue he'd\nbeen trying to forget that he hadn't eaten since noon, Dr. Al's choice\nlooked like an unfortunate one. Cavender happened to be very fond of\nham.\n\n\"Now here,\" Ormond continued, putting the plate down, \"is where this\nexperiment begins to differ from anything we have done before. For all\nof us will try to imagine--to visualize as being on this plate--_the\nsame ham sandwich_. And so there will be no conflict in our\nprojections, let's decide first on just what ingredients we want to\nput on it.\" He smiled. \"We'll make this the finest ham sandwich our\ncollective imagination can produce!\"\n\nThere were more chuckles. Cavender cursed under his breath, his mouth\nbeginning to water. Suggestions came promptly.\n\n\"Mustard?\" Dr. Ormond said, \"Of course--Not too sharp though,\nEleanor?\" He smiled at Mrs. Folsom. \"I agree! A light touch of\ndelicate salad mustard. Crisp lettuce ... finely chopped gherkins.\nVery well!\"\n\n\"Put it all on rye,\" Cavender said helplessly. \"Toasted rye.\"\n\n\"Toasted rye?\" Ormond smiled at him, looked around. \"Any objections?\nNo? Toasted rye it shall be, Wally. And I believe that completes our\nselection.\"\n\nHe paused, his face turning serious. \"Now as to that word of caution I\ngave you. For three minutes each of you will visualize the object we\nhave chosen on the plate I will be holding up before me. You will do\nthis with your eyes open, and to each of you, in your own subjective\nreality, the object will become, as you know, more or less clearly\ndiscernible.\n\n\"But let me tell you this. Do not be too surprised if at the end of\nthat time, when the exercise is over, the object _remains visible to_\nyou ... does not disappear!\"\n\nThere was silence for a moment. Then renewed chuckles, but slightly\nnervous ones, and not too many.\n\nDr. Ormond said sternly, \"I am serious about that! The possibility,\nthough it may be small tonight, is there. You have learned that, by\nthe laws of Insight, any image of subjective reality, if it can be\nendowed with _all_ the attributes of objective reality by its human\ncreator, _must_ spontaneously become an image in objective reality!\n\n\"In this case, our collective ham sandwich, if it were perfectly\nvisualized, could not only be seen by you but felt, its weight and the\ntexture of each of its ingredients perceived, their appetizing\nfragrance savored\"--Cavender groaned mentally--\"and more: if one of\nyou were to eat this sandwich, he would find it exactly as nourishing\nas any produced by the more ordinary methods of objective reality.\n\n\"There are people in the world today,\" Dr. Ormond concluded, speaking\nvery earnestly now, \"who can do this! There always have been people\nwho could do this. And you are following in their footsteps, being\ntrained in even more advanced skills. I am aware to a greater extent\nthan any of you of the latent power that is developing--has\ndeveloped--in this group. Tonight, for the first time, that power will\nbe focused, drawn down to a pinpoint, to accomplish one task.\n\n\"Again, I do not say that at the end of our exercise a ham sandwich\nwill lie on this plate. Frankly, I don't expect it. But I suggest very\nstrongly that you don't let it surprise or startle you too much if we\nfind it here!\"\n\nThere was dead stillness when he finished speaking. Cavender had a\nsense that the lecture room had come alive with eerie little chills.\nDr. Ormond lifted the plate solemnly up before him, holding it between\nthe fingertips of both hands.\n\n\"Now, if you will direct your attention here ... no, Eleanor, with\nyour eyes open!\n\n\"Let us begin....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCavender sighed, straightened up in his chair, eyes fixed obediently\non the wooden plate, and banned ham sandwiches and every other kind of\nfood firmly from his thoughts. There was no point in working his\nappetite up any further when he couldn't satisfy it, and he would have\nto be on guard a little against simply falling asleep during the next\nthree minutes. The cloudiness of complete fatigue wasn't too far away.\nAt the edge of his vision, he was aware of his fellow students across\nthe room, arranged in suddenly motionless rows like staring zombies.\nHis eyelids began to feel leaden.\n\nThe three minutes dragged on, came to an end. Ormond slowly lowered\nhis hands. Cavender drew a long breath of relief. The wooden plate, he\nnoted, with no surprise, was still empty.\n\n\"You may stop visualizing,\" Ormond announced.\n\nThere was a concerted sighing, a creaking of chairs. The students came\nout of their semitrances, blinked, smiled, settled into more\ncomfortable positions, waiting for Dr. Al's comments.\n\n\"No miracles this time!\" Ormond began briskly. He smiled.\n\nMrs. Folsom said, \"Dr. Al--\"\n\nHe looked over at her. \"Yes, Eleanor?\"\n\nEleanor Folsom hesitated, shook her head. \"No,\" she said. \"Go on. I'm\nsorry I interrupted.\"\n\n\"That's all right.\" Dr. Al gave her a warm smile. It had been, he\ncontinued, a successful exercise, a very promising first attempt, in\nspite of the lack of an immediate materialization, which, of course,\nhad been only a remote possibility to start with. He had no fault to\nfind with the quality of the group's effort. He had sensed it ... as\nthey, too, presently would be able to sense it ... as a smooth flow of\ndirected energy. With a little more practice ... one of these days ...\n\nCavender stifled one yawn, concealed another which didn't allow itself\nto be stifled behind a casually raised hand. He watched Ormond move\nover to the prop table, put the wooden plate down beside the red\nsuitcase without interrupting his encouraging summary of the exercise,\nhesitate, then pick up something else, something which looked like a\nflexible copper trident, and start back to the center of the room with\nit.\n\nMrs. Folsom's voice said shrilly, \"_Dr. Al--!_\"\n\n\"Yes, Eleanor? What is it?\"\n\n\"Just now,\" Mrs. Folsom said, her voice still holding the shrill note,\n\"just a moment ago, on the plate over there, I'm certain ... I'm\nalmost certain I saw the ham sandwich!\"\n\nShe added breathlessly, \"And that's what I was going to say before,\nDr. Al! Right after you told us to stop visualizing I thought I saw\nthe sandwich on the plate! But it was only for a moment and I wasn't\nsure. But now I'm sure, almost sure, that I saw it again on the plate\non the table!\"\n\nThe old woman was pointing a trembling finger towards the table. Her\ncheeks showed spots of hectic red. In the rows behind her, the\nstudents looked at one another, shook their heads in resignation, some\nobviously suppressing amusement. Others looked annoyed. They were all\nfamiliar with Eleanor Folsom's tendency to produce such little\nsensations during the meetings. If the evening didn't promise to bring\nenough excitement, Eleanor always could be counted on to take a hand\nin events.\n\nCavender felt less certain about it. This time, Mrs. Folsom sounded\ngenuinely excited. And if she actually believed she'd seen something\nmaterialize, she might be fairly close to getting one of those little\nheart attacks she kept everyone informed about.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDr. Al could have had the same thought. He glanced back at the prop\ntable, asked gravely, \"You don't see it there now, do you, Eleanor?\"\n\nMrs. Folsom shook her head. \"No. No, of course not! It disappeared\nagain. It was only there for a second. But I'm sure I saw it!\"\n\n\"Now this is very interesting,\" Ormond said seriously. \"Has anyone\nelse observed anything at all unusual during the last few minutes?\"\n\nThere was a murmured chorus of dissent, but Cavender noticed that the\nexpressions of amusement and annoyance had vanished. Dr. Al had\nchanged the tune, and the students were listening intently. He turned\nback to Mrs. Folsom.\n\n\"Let us consider the possibilities here, Eleanor,\" he said. \"For one\nthing, you should be congratulated in any case, because your\nexperience shows that your visualization was clear and true throughout\nour exercise. If it hadn't been, nothing like this could have\noccurred.\n\n\"But precisely what was the experience? There we are, as of this\nmoment, on uncertain ground. You saw something. That no one else saw\nthe same thing might mean simply that no one else happened to be\nlooking at the plate at those particular instances in time. I, for\nexample, certainly gave it no further attention after the exercise was\nover. You _may_ then have observed a genuine materialization!\"\n\nMrs. Folsom nodded vigorously. \"Yes, I--\"\n\n\"But,\" Ormond went on, \"under the circumstances, the scientific\nattitude we maintain at this Institute demands that we leave the\nquestion open. For now. Because you might also, you understand, have\nprojected--for yourself only--a vivid momentary impression of the\nimage you had created during our exercise and were still holding in\nyour mind.\"\n\nMrs. Folsom looked doubtful. The flush of excitement began to leave\nher face.\n\n\"Why ... well, yes, I suppose so,\" she acknowledged unwillingly.\n\n\"Of course,\" Ormond said. \"So tonight we shall leave it at that. The\nnext time we engage in a similar exercise ... well, who knows?\" He\ngave her a reassuring smile. \"I must say, Eleanor, that this is a very\nencouraging indication of the progress you have made!\" He glanced over\nthe group, gathering their attention, and raised the trident-like\ndevice he had taken from the table.\n\n\"And now for our second experiment this evening--\"\n\nLooking disappointed and somewhat confused, Eleanor Folsom settled\nback in her chair. Cavender also settled back, his gaze shifting\nsleepily to the remaining items on the prop table. He was frowning a\nlittle. It wasn't his business, but if the old woman had started to\nhypnotize herself into having hallucinations, Dr. Al had better turn\nto a different type of meeting exercises. And that probably was\nexactly what Ormond would do; he seemed very much aware of danger\nsignals. Cavender wondered vaguely what the red suitcase on the table\ncontained.\n\nThere was a blurry shimmer on the wooden plate beside the suitcase.\nThen something thickened there suddenly as if drawing itself together\nout of the air. Perrie Rochelle, sitting only ten feet back from the\ntable, uttered a yelp--somewhere between surprise and alarm. Dexter\nJones, beside her, abruptly pushed back his chair, made a loud,\nincoherent exclamation of some kind.\n\nCavender had started upright, heart hammering. The thing that had\nappeared on the wooden plate vanished again.\n\nBut it had remained visible there for a two full seconds. And there\nwas no question at all of what it had been.\n\nFor several minutes, something resembling pandemonium swirled about\nthe walls of the lecture room of the Institute of Insight. The red\nsuitcase had concealed the wooden plate on the prop table from the\neyes of most of the students sitting on the right side of the room,\nbut a number of those who could see it felt they had caught a glimpse\nof something. Of just what they weren't sure at first, or perhaps they\npreferred not to say.\n\nPerrie and Dexter, however, after getting over their first shock, had\nno such doubts. Perrie, voice vibrant with excitement, answered the\nquestions flung at her from across the room, giving a detailed\ndescription of the ham sandwich which had appeared out of nowhere on\nthe polished little table and stayed there for an incredible instant\nbefore it vanished. Dexter Jones, his usually impassive face glowing\nand animated, laughing, confirmed the description on every point.\n\nOn the opposite side of the room, Eleanor Folsom, surrounded by her\nown group of questioners, was also having her hour of triumph, in the\nwarmth of which a trace of bitterness that her first report of the\nphenomenon had been shrugged off by everyone--even, in a way, by Dr.\nAl--gradually dissolved.\n\nDr. Al himself, Cavender thought, remained remarkably quiet at first,\nthough in the excitement this wasn't generally noticed. He might even\nhave turned a little pale. However, before things began to slow down\nhe had himself well in hand again. Calling the group to a semblance of\norder, he began smilingly to ask specific questions. The witnesses on\nthe right side of the room seemed somewhat more certain now of what\nthey had observed.\n\nDr. Ormond looked over at Cavender.\n\n\"And you, Wally?\" he asked. \"You were sitting rather far back, to be\nsure--\"\n\nCavender smiled and shrugged.\n\n\"Sorry, Dr. Al. I just wasn't looking in that direction at the moment.\nThe first suggestion I had that anything unusual was going on was when\nPerrie let out that wild squawk.\"\n\nThere was general laughter. Perrie grinned and flushed.\n\n\"Well, I'd have liked to hear _your_ squawk,\" she told Cavender, \"if\nyou'd seen a miracle happen right before your nose!\"\n\n\"Not a miracle, Perrie,\" Ormond said gently. \"We must remember that.\nWe are working here with natural forces which produce natural\nphenomena. Insufficiently understood phenomena, perhaps, but never\nmiraculous ones. Now, how closely did this materialization appear to\nconform to the subjective group image we had decided on for our\nexercise?\"\n\n\"Well, I could only see it, of course, Dr. Al. But as far as I saw it,\nit was exactly what we'd ... no, wait!\" Perrie frowned, wrinkling her\nnose. \"There was something added!\" She giggled. \"At least, I don't\nremember anyone saying we should imagine the sandwich wrapped in a\npaper napkin!\"\n\nAcross the room, a woman's voice said breathlessly, \"Oh! A _green_\npaper napkin, Perrie?\"\n\nPerrie looked around, surprised. \"Yes, it was, Mavis.\"\n\nMavis Greenfield hesitated, said with a nervous little laugh, \"I\nsuppose I did that. I added a green napkin after we started the\nexercise.\" Her voice quavered for an instant. \"I thought the image\nlooked neater that way.\" She looked appealingly at the students around\nher. \"This is really incredible, isn't it.\"\n\nThey gave her vague smiles. They were plainly still floating on a\ncloud of collective achievement--if they hadn't created that sandwich,\nthere could have been nothing to see!\n\nIt seemed to Cavender that Dr. Ormond's face showed a flicker of\nstrain when he heard Mavis' explanation. But he couldn't be sure\nbecause the expression--if it had been there--was smoothed away at\nonce. Ormond cleared his throat, said firmly and somewhat chidingly.\n\"No, not incredible, Mavis! Although--\"\n\nHe turned on his smile. \"My friends, I must admit that you _have_\nsurprised me! Very pleasantly, of course. But what happened here is\nsomething I considered to be only a very remote possibility tonight.\nYou are truly more advanced than I'd realized.\n\n\"For note this. If even one of you had been lagging behind the others,\nif there had been any unevenness in the concentration each gave to the\nexercise tonight, this materialization simply could not have occurred!\nAnd that fact forces me now to a very important decision.\"\n\nHe went over to the prop table, took the suitcase from it. \"Mavis,\" he\nsaid gravely, \"you may put away these other devices. We will have no\nfurther need for them in this group! Dexter, move the table to the\ncenter of the room for me, please.\"\n\nHe waited while his instructions were hastily carried out, then laid\nthe suitcase on the table, drew up a chair and sat down. The buzz of\nexcited conversation among the students hushed. They stared at him in\nanticipatory silence. It appeared that the evening's surprises were\nnot yet over--and they were ready for _anything_ now!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"There is a point,\" Dr. Ormond began in a solemn voice, riveting their\neager attention on him, \"a point in the orderly advance towards Total\nInsight at which further progress becomes greatly simplified and\naccelerated, because the student has now developed the capability to\naugment his personal efforts by the use of certain instruments.\"\n\nCavender thoughtfully reached inside his coat, brought out a cigarette\ncase, opened it and slowly put a cigarette to his lips. About to flick\non a lighter, he saw Ruben Jeffries watching him with an expression of\ndisapproval from across the aisle. Jeffries shook his head, indicated\nthe NO SMOKING sign on the wall. Cavender nodded, smiling a rueful\napology for his absent-mindedness, and returned the cigarette to its\ncase. He shoved his hands into his trousers pockets, slouched back in\nthe chair.\n\n\"I have told you,\" Ormond was saying, \"that the contributions many of\nyou so generously made to the Institute were needed for and being\nabsorbed by vital research. Tonight I had intended to give you a first\ninkling of what that research was accomplishing.\" He tapped the\nsuitcase on the table before him. \"In there is an instrument of the\nkind I have mentioned. The beneficial forces of the Cosmos are\nharnessed by it, flow through it. And I believe I can say that my\nefforts in recent months have produces the most effective such device\never seen....\"\n\n\"Dr. Al,\" Mrs. Folsom interrupted firmly, \"I think you should let them\nknow how the instrument cured my heart condition.\"\n\nFaces shifted toward her, then back to Dr. Al. The middle-aged\nmajority of the students pricked their ears. For each of them,\nconscious of the years of increasingly uncertain health to come, Mrs.\nFolsom's words contained a personal implication, one that hit home.\nBut in spite of the vindication of her claim to have seen a\nmaterialized ham sandwich, they weren't quite ready to trust her about\nthis.\n\nDr. Ormond's face was grave.\n\n\"Eleanor,\" he said reprovingly, \"that was letting the cat out of the\nbag, wasn't it? I hadn't intended to discuss that part of the matter\njust yet.\"\n\nHe hesitated, frowning, tapping the table top lightly with his\nknuckles. Mrs. Folsom looked unabashed. She had produced another\nsensation and knew it.\n\n\"Since it was mentioned,\" Ormond said with deliberation at last, \"it\nwould be unfair not to tell you, at least in brief, the facts to which\nEleanor was alluding. Very well then--Eleanor has served during the\npast several weeks as the subject of certain experiments connected\nwith this instrument. She reports that after her first use of it, her\nperiodically recurring heart problem ceased to trouble her.\"\n\nMrs. Folsom smiled, nodded vigorously. \"I have not,\" she announced,\n\"had one single touch of pain or dizziness in all this time!\"\n\n\"But one should, of course,\" Dr. Ormond added objectively, \"hesitate\nto use the word 'cure' under such circumstances.\"\n\nIn the front row someone asked, \"Dr. Al, will the instrument heal ...\nwell, other physical conditions?\"\n\nOrmond looked at the speaker with dignity. \"John, the instrument does,\nand is supposed to do, one thing. Providing, as I've said, that the\nstudent working with it has attained a certain minimum level of\nInsight, it greatly accelerates his progress towards Total Insight.\nVery greatly!\n\n\"Now, as I have implied before: as one approaches the goal of Total\nInsight, the ailments and diseases which commonly afflict humanity\nsimply disappear. Unfortunately, I am not yet free to show you proof\nfor this, although I have the proof and believe it will not be long\nbefore it can be revealed at least to the members of this group. For\nthis reason, I have preferred not to say too much on the point....\nYes, Reuben? You have a question?\"\n\n\"Two questions, Dr. Al,\" Reuben Jeffries said. \"First, is it your\nopinion that our group has now reached the minimum level of Insight\nthat makes it possible to work with those instruments?\"\n\nOrmond nodded emphatically. \"Yes, it has. After tonight's occurrence\nthere is no further question about that.\"\n\n\"Then,\" Jeffries said, \"my second question is simply--_when do we\nstart?_\"\n\nThere was laughter, a scattering of applause. Ormond smiled, said, \"An\nexcellent question, Reuben! The answer is that a number of you will\nstart immediately.\n\n\"A limited quantity of the instruments--fifteen, I believe--are\navailable now on the premises, stored in my office. Within a few weeks\nI will have enough on hand to supply as many of you as wish to speed\nup their progress by this method. Since the group's contributions paid\nmy research expenses, I cannot in justice ask more from you\nindividually now than the actual cost in material and labor for each\ninstrument. The figure ... I have it somewhere ... oh, yes!\" Ormond\npulled a notebook from his pocket, consulted it, looked up and said,\nmildly, \"Twelve hundred dollars will be adequate, I think.\"\n\nCavender's lips twitched sardonically. Three or four of the group\nmight have flinched inwardly at the price tag, but on the whole they\nwere simply too well heeled to give such a detail another thought.\nCheckbooks were coming hurriedly into sight all around the lecture\nroom. Reuben Jeffries, unfolding his, announced, \"Dr. Al, I'm taking\none of the fifteen.\"\n\nHalf the students turned indignantly to stare at him. \"Now wait a\nminute, Reuben!\" someone said. \"That isn't fair! It's obvious there\naren't enough to go around.\"\n\nJeffries smiled at him. \"That's why I spoke up, Warren!\" He appealed\nto Ormond. \"How about it, Dr. Al?\"\n\nOrmond observed judiciously, \"It seems fair enough to me. Eleanor, of\ncourse, is retaining the instrument with which she has been working.\nAs for the rest of you--first come, first served, you know! If others\nwould like to have Mavis put down their names....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a brief hubbub as this suggestion was acted on. Mavis,\nDexter Jones and Perrie Rochelle then went to the office to get the\ninstruments, while Dr. Ormond consoled the students who had found\nthemselves left out. It would be merely a matter of days before the\nnew instruments began to come in ... and yes, they could leave their\nchecks in advance. When he suggested tactfully that financial\narrangements could be made if necessary, the less affluent also\nbrightened up.\n\nFifteen identical red alligator-hide suitcases appeared and were lined\nup beside Ormond's table. He announced that a preliminary\ndemonstration with the instrument would be made as soon as those on\nhand had been distributed. Mavis Greenfield, standing beside him,\nbegan to read off the names she had taken down.\n\nReuben Jeffries was the fifth to come up to the table, hand Ormond his\ncheck and receive a suitcase from the secretary. Then Cavender got\nunhurriedly to his feet.\n\n\"Dr. Ormond,\" he said, loudly enough to center the attention of\neveryone in the room on him, \"may I have the floor for a moment?\"\n\nOrmond appeared surprised, then startled. His glance went up to Reuben\nJeffries, still standing stolidly beside him, and his face slowly\nwhitened.\n\n\"Why ... well, yes, Wally.\" His voice seemed unsteady. \"What's on your\nmind?\"\n\nCavender faced the right side of the room and the questioning faces\nturned towards him.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"My name, as you know,\" he told the advanced students, \"is Wallace\nCavender. What you haven't known so far is that I am a police\ndetective, rank of lieutenant, currently attached to the police force\nof this city and in temporary charge of its bunco squad.\"\n\nHe shifted his gaze towards the front of the room. Ormond's eyes met\nhis for a moment, then dropped.\n\n\"Dr. Ormond,\" Cavender said, \"you're under arrest. The immediate\ncharge, let's say, is practicing medicine without a license. Don't\nworry about whether we can make it stick or not. We'll have three or\nfour others worked up by the time we get you downtown.\"\n\nFor a moment, there was a shocked, frozen stillness in the lecture\nroom. Dr. Ormond's hand began to move out quietly towards the checks\nlying on the table before him. Reuben Jeffries' big hand got there\nfirst.\n\n\"I'll take care of these for now, Dr. Al,\" Jeffries said with a\nfriendly smile. \"The lieutenant thinks he wants them.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNot much more than thirty minutes later, Cavender unlocked the door to\nDr. Ormond's private office, went inside, leaving the door open behind\nhim, and sat down at Ormond's desk. He rubbed his aching eyes, yawned,\nlit a cigarette, looked about in vain for an ashtray, finally emptied\na small dish of paper clips on the desk and placed the dish\nconveniently close to him.\n\nThere had been an indignant uproar about Dr. Al's arrest for a while,\nbut it ended abruptly when uniformed policemen appeared in the two\nexit doors and the sobering thought struck the students that any\npublicity given the matter could make them look personally ridiculous\nand do damage to their business and social standing.\n\nCavender had calmed their fears. It was conceivable, he said, that the\ndistrict attorney's office would wish to confer with some of them\nprivately, in connection with charges to be brought against William\nFitzgerald Grady--which, so far as the police had been able to\nestablish, was Dr. Ormond's real name. However, their association with\nthe Institute of Insight would not be made public, and any proceedings\nwould be carried out with the discretion that could be fully expected\nby blameless citizens of their status in the community.\n\nThey were fortunate, Cavender went on, in another respect. Probably\nnone of them had been aware of just how much Grady had milked from the\ngroup chiefly through quiet private contributions and donations during\nthe two years he was running the Institute. The sum came to better\nthan two hundred thousand dollars. Grady naturally had wasted none of\nthis in \"research\" and he was not a spendthrift in other ways.\nCavender was, therefore, happy to say that around two thirds of this\nmoney was known to be still intact in various bank accounts, and that\nit would be restored eventually to the generous but misled donors.\n\nDr. Al's ex-students were beginning to look both chastened and very\nmuch relieved. Cavender briefly covered a few more points to eliminate\nremaining doubts. He touched on Grady's early record as a confidence\nman and blackmailer, mentioned the two terms he had spent in prison\nand the fact that for the last eighteen years he had confined himself\nto operations like the Institute of Insight where risks were less. The\nprofits, if anything, had been higher because Grady had learned that\nit paid off, in the long run, to deal exclusively with wealthy\ncitizens and he was endowed with the kind of personality needed to\novercome the caution natural to that class. As for the unusual\nexperiences about which some of them might be now thinking, these,\nCavender concluded, should be considered in the light of the fact that\nGrady had made his living at one time as a stage magician and\nhypnotist, working effectively both with and without trained\naccomplices.\n\nThe lecture had gone over very well, as he'd known it would. The\nex-students left for their homes, a subdued and shaken group, grateful\nfor having been rescued from an evil man's toils. Even Mrs. Folsom,\nwho had announced at one point that she believed she had a heart\nattack coming on, recovered sufficiently to thank Cavender and assure\nhim that in future she would take her problems only to a reliable\nphysician.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFootsteps were coming down the short hall from the back of the\nbuilding. Then Reuben Jeffries' voice said, \"Go into the office. The\nlieutenant's waiting for you there.\"\n\nCavender stubbed out his cigarette as Dexter Jones, Perrie Rochelle\nand Mavis Greenfield filed into the office. Jeffries closed the door\nbehind them from the hall and went off.\n\n\"Sit down,\" Cavender said, lighting a fresh cigarette.\n\nThey selected chairs and settled down stiffly, facing him. All three\nlooked anxious and pale; and Perrie's face was tear-stained.\n\nCavender said, \"I suppose you've been wondering why I had Sergeant\nJeffries tell you three to stay behind.\"\n\nPerrie began, her eyes and voice rather wild, \"Mr. Cavender ...\nLieutenant Cavender....\"\n\n\"Either will do,\" Cavender said.\n\n\"Mr. Cavender, I swear you're wrong! We didn't have anything to do\nwith Dr. Al's ... Mr. Grady's cheating those people! At least, I\ndidn't. I swear it!\"\n\n\"I didn't say you had anything to do with it, Perrie,\" Cavender\nremarked. \"Personally I think none of you had anything to do with it.\nNot voluntarily, at any rate.\"\n\nHe could almost feel them go limp with relief. He waited. After a\nsecond or two, Perrie's eyes got the wild look back. \"But....\"\n\n\"Yes?\" Cavender asked.\n\nPerrie glanced at Dexter Jones, at Mavis.\n\n\"But then what _did_ happen?\" she asked bewilderedly, of the other two\nas much as of Cavender. \"Mr. Cavender, I saw something appear on that\nplate! I know it did. It was a sandwich. It looked perfectly natural.\nI don't think it could have possibly been something Mr. Grady did with\nmirrors. And how could it have had the paper napkin Mavis had just\nbeen thinking about wrapped around it, unless....\"\n\n\"Unless it actually was a materialization of a mental image you'd\ncreated between you?\" Cavender said. \"Now settle back and relax,\nPerrie. There's a more reasonable explanation for what happened\ntonight than that.\"\n\nHe waited a moment, went on. \"Grady's one real interest is money and\nsince none of you have any to speak of, his interest in you was that\nyou could help him get it. Perrie and Dexter showed some genuine\ntalent to start with, in the line of guessing what card somebody was\nthinking about and the like. It's not too unusual an ability, and in\nitself it wasn't too useful to Grady.\n\n\"But he worked on your interest in the subject. All the other\nstudents, the paying students, had to lose was a sizable amount of\ncash ... with the exception of Mrs. Folsom who's been the next thing\nto a flip for years anyway. She was in danger. And you three stood a\ngood chance of letting Grady wreck your lives. I said he's a competent\nhypnotist. He is. Also a completely ruthless one.\"\n\nHe looked at Mavis. \"As far as I know, Mavis, you haven't ever\ndemonstrated that you have any interesting extrasensory talents like\nDexter's and Perrie's. Rather the contrary. Right?\"\n\nShe nodded, her eyes huge.\n\n\"I've always tested negative. Way down negative. That's why I was\nreally rather shocked when that.... Of course, I've always been\nfascinated by such things. And he insisted it would show up in me\nsometime.\"\n\n\"And,\" Cavender said, \"several times a week you had special little\ntraining sessions with him, just as his two star pupils here did, to\nhelp it show up. You were another perfect stooge, from Grady's point\nof view. Well, what it amounts to is that Grady was preparing to make\nhis big final killing off this group before he disappeared from the\ncity. He would have collected close to thirty thousand dollars\ntonight, and probably twice as much again within the next month or so\nbefore any of the students began to suspect seriously that Dr. Al's\ninstruments could be the meaningless contraptions they are.\n\n\"You three have been hypnotically conditioned to a fare-you-well in\nthose little private sessions you've had with him. During the past\nweek you were set up for the role you were to play tonight. When you\ngot your cue--at a guess it was Mrs. Folsom's claim that she'd seen\nthe ham sandwich materialize--you started seeing, saying, acting, and\nthinking exactly as you'd been told to see, say, act, and think.\nThere's no more mystery about it than that. And in my opinion you're\nthree extremely fortunate young people in that we were ready to move\nin on Grady when we were.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was silence for a moment. Then Perrie Rochelle said hesitantly,\n\"Then Mrs. Folsom....\"\n\n\"Mrs. Folsom,\" Cavender said, \"has also enjoyed the benefits of many\nprivate sessions with Grady. She, of course, was additionally paying\nvery handsomely for them. Tonight, she reported seeing what she'd been\ntold to report seeing, to set off the hypnotic chain reaction.\"\n\n\"But,\" Perrie said, \"she said her heart attacks stopped after she\nstarted using the instrument. I really don't see how that could have\nbeen just her imagination?\"\n\n\"Very easily,\" Cavender said. \"I've talked with her physician. Mrs.\nFolsom belongs to a not uncommon type of people whose tickers are as\nsound as yours or mine, but who are convinced they have a serious\nheart ailment and can dish up symptoms impressive enough to fool\nanyone but an informed professional. They can stop dishing them up\njust as readily if they think they've been cured.\" He smiled faintly.\n\"You look as if you might be finally convinced, Perrie.\"\n\nShe nodded. \"I ... yes, I guess so. I guess I am.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Cavender said. He stood up. \"You three can run along\nthen. You won't be officially involved in this matter, and no one's\ngoing to bother you. If you want to go on playing around with E.S.P.\nand so forth, that's your business. But I trust that in future you'll\nhave the good sense to keep away from characters like Grady. Periods\nof confusion, chronic nightmares--even chronic headaches--are a good\nsign you're asking for bad trouble in that area.\"\n\nThey thanked him, started out of the office in obvious relief. At the\ndoor, Perrie Rochelle hesitated, looked back.\n\n\"Mr. Cavender....\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"You don't think I ... I need....\"\n\n\"Psychiatric help? No. But I understand,\" Cavender said, \"that you\nhave a sister in Maine who's been wanting you to spend the summer with\nher. I think that's a fine idea! A month or two of sun and salt water\nis exactly what you can use to drive the last of this nonsense out of\nyour mind again. So good night to the three of you, and good luck!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCavender snapped the top of the squat little thermos flask back in\nplace and restored it to the glove compartment of Jeffries' car. He\nbrushed a few crumbs from the knees of his trousers and settled back\nin the seat, discovering he no longer felt nearly as tired and washed\nout as he had been an hour ago in the lecture room. A few cups of\ncoffee and a little nourishment could do wonders for a man, even at\nthe tail end of a week of hard work.\n\nThe last light in the Institute building across the street went out\nand Cavender heard the click of the front door. The bulky figure of\nDetective Sergeant Reuben Jeffries stood silhouetted for a moment in\nthe street lights on the entrance steps. Then Jeffries came down the\nsteps and crossed the street to the car.\n\n\"All done?\" Cavender asked.\n\n\"All done,\" Jeffries said through the window. He opened the door,\neased himself in behind the wheel and closed the door.\n\n\"They took Grady away by the back entrance,\" he told Cavender. \"The\nrecords in his files ... he wasn't keeping much, of course ... and the\nstuff in the safe and those instruments went along with him. He was\nvery co-operative. He's had a real scare.\"\n\nCavender grunted. \"He'll get over it.\"\n\nJeffries hesitated, said, \"I'm something of a Johnny-come-lately in\nthis line of work, you know. I'd be interested in hearing how it's\nhandled from here on.\"\n\n\"In this case it will be pretty well standard procedure,\" Cavender\nsaid. \"Tomorrow around noon I'll have Grady brought in to see me. I'll\nbe in a curt and bitter mood--the frustrated honest cop. I'll tell him\nhe's in luck. The D. A.'s office has informed me that because of the\nimportant names involved in this fraud case, and because all but\naround forty thousand dollars of the money he collected in this town\nhave been recovered, they've decided not to prosecute. He'll have till\nmidnight to clear out. If he ever shows up again, he gets the book.\"\n\n\"Why leave him the forty thousand?\" Jeffries asked. \"I understood they\nknow darn well where it's stashed.\"\n\nCavender shrugged. \"The man's put in two years of work, Reuben. If we\nclean him, he might get discouraged enough to get out of the racket\nand try something else. As it is, he'll have something like the\nInstitute of Insight going again in another city three months from\nnow. In an area that hasn't been cropped over recently. He's good in\nthat line ... one of the best, in fact.\"\n\nJeffries thoughtfully started the car, pulled out from the curb.\nHalfway down the block, he remarked, \"You gave me the go-ahead sign\nwith the cigarette right after the Greenfield girl claimed she'd put\nthe paper napkin into that image. Does that mean you finally came to a\ndecision about her?\"\n\n\"Uh-huh.\"\n\nJeffries glanced over at him, asked, \"Is there any secret about how\nyou're able to spot them?\"\n\n\"No ... except that I don't know. If I could describe to anyone how to\ngo about it, we might have our work cut in half. But I can't, and\nneither can any other spotter. It's simply a long, tedious process of\nstaying in contact with people you have some reason to suspect of\nbeing the genuine article. If they are, you know it eventually. But if\nit weren't that men with Grady's type of personality attract them\nsomehow from ten miles around, we'd have no practical means at present\nof screening prospects out of the general population. You can't\ndistinguish one of them from anyone else if he's just walking past you\non the street.\"\n\nJeffries brought the car to a halt at a stop light.\n\n\"That's about the way I'd heard it,\" he acknowledged. \"What about\nnegative spotting? Is there a chance there might be an undiscovered\nlatent left among our recent fellow students?\"\n\n\"No chance at all,\" Cavender said. \"The process works both ways. If\nthey aren't, you also know it eventually--and I was sure of everyone\nbut Greenfield over three weeks ago. She's got as tough a set of\nobscuring defenses as I've ever worked against. But after the jolt she\ngot tonight, she came through clear immediately.\"\n\nThe light changed and the car started up. Jeffries asked, \"You feel\nboth of them can be rehabilitated?\"\n\n\"Definitely,\" Cavender said. \"Another three months of Grady's\npseudoyoga might have ruined them for good. But give them around a\nyear to settle out and they'll be all right. Then they'll get the\ncall. It's been worth the trouble. Jones is good medium grade--and\nthat Greenfield! She'll be a powerhouse before she's half developed.\nEasily the most promising prospect I've come across in six years.\"\n\n\"You're just as certain about Perrie Rochelle?\"\n\n\"Uh-huh. Protopsi--fairly typical. She's developed as far as she ever\nwill. It would be a complete waste of time to call her. You can't\ntrain something that just isn't there.\"\n\nJeffries grunted. \"Never make a mistake, eh?\"\n\nCavender yawned, smiled. \"Never have yet, Reuben! Not in that area.\"\n\n\"How did you explain the sandwich to them--and Greenfield's napkin?\nThey couldn't have bought your stage magic idea.\"\n\n\"No. Told them those were Dr. Al's posthypnotic suggestions. It's the\nother standard rationalization.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey drove on in silence for a while. Then Jeffries cleared his\nthroat.\n\n\"Incidentally,\" he said. \"I should apologize for the slip with the\nsandwich, even though it turned out to our advantage. I can't quite\nexplain it. I was thinking of other matters at the moment, and I\nsuppose I....\"\n\nCavender, who had been gazing drowsily through the windshield, shook\nhis head.\n\n\"As you say, it turned out very well, Reuben. Aside from putting the\nfirst crack in Mavis Greenfield's defenses, it shook up Dr. Al to the\npoint where he decided to collect as much as he could tonight, cash\nthe checks, and clear out. So he set himself up for the pinch. We\nprobably gained as much as three or four weeks on both counts.\"\n\nJeffries nodded. \"I realize that. But....\"\n\n\"Well, you'd have no reason to blame yourself for the slip in any\ncase,\" Cavender went on. \"The fact is I'd been so confoundedly busy\nall afternoon and evening, I forgot to take time out for dinner. When\nthat sandwich was being described in those mouth-watering terms, I\nrealized I was really ravenous. At the same time I was fighting off\nsleep. Between the two, I went completely off guard for a moment, and\nit simply happened!\"\n\nHe grinned. \"As described, by the way, it was a terrific sandwich.\nThat group had real imagination!\" He hesitated, then put out his hand,\npalm up, before him. \"As a matter of fact, just talking about it again\nseems to be putting me in a mood for seconds....\"\n\nSomething shimmered for an instant in the dim air wrapped in its green\ntissue napkin, a second ham sandwich appeared.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Ham Sandwich, by James H.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
