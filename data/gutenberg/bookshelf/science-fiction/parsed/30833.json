The Angelus had rung at six, as always,\nand my lord D'Evreux had been awakened by it, as always. At least, Sir\nPierre could not remember any time in the past seventeen years when my\nlord had not awakened at the Angelus. Once, he recalled, the sacristan\nhad failed to ring the bell, and the Count had been furious for a\nweek. Only the intercession of Father Bright, backed by the Bishop\nhimself, had saved the sacristan from doing a turn in the dungeons of\nCastle D'Evreux.\n\nSir Pierre stepped out into the corridor, walked along the carpeted\nflagstones, and cast a practiced eye around him as he walked. These\nold castles were difficult to keep clean, and my lord the Count was\nfussy about nitre collecting in the seams between the stones of the\nwalls. All appeared quite in order, which was a good thing. My lord\nthe Count had been making a night of it last evening, and that always\nmade him the more peevish in the morning. Though he always woke at the\nAngelus, he did not always wake up sober.\n\nSir Pierre stopped before a heavy, polished, carved oak door, selected\na key from one of the many at his belt, and turned it in the lock.\nThen he went into the elevator and the door locked automatically\nbehind him. He pressed the switch and waited in patient silence as he\nwas lifted up four floors to the Count's personal suite.\n\nBy now, my lord the Count would have bathed, shaved, and dressed. He\nwould also have poured down an eye-opener consisting of half a water\nglass of fine Champagne brandy. He would not eat breakfast until\neight. The Count had no valet in the strict sense of the term. Sir\nReginald Beauvay held that title, but he was never called upon to\nexercise the more personal functions of his office. The Count did not\nlike to be seen until he was thoroughly presentable.\n\nThe elevator stopped. Sir Pierre stepped out into the corridor and\nwalked along it toward the door at the far end. At exactly seven\no'clock, he rapped briskly on the great door which bore the\ngilt-and-polychrome arms of the House D'Evreux.\n\nFor the first time in seventeen years, there was no answer.\n\nSir Pierre waited for the growled command to enter for a full minute,\nunable to believe his ears. Then, almost timidly, he rapped again.\n\nThere was still no answer.\n\nThen, bracing himself for the verbal onslaught that would follow if he\nhad erred, Sir Pierre turned the handle and opened the door just as if\nhe had heard the Count's voice telling him to come in.\n\n\"Good morning, my lord,\" he said, as he always had for seventeen\nyears.\n\nBut the room was empty, and there was no answer.\n\nHe looked around the huge room. The morning sunlight streamed in\nthrough the high mullioned windows and spread a diamond-checkered\npattern across the tapestry on the far wall, lighting up the brilliant\nhunting scene in a blaze of color.\n\n\"My lord?\"\n\nNothing. Not a sound.\n\nThe bedroom door was open. Sir Pierre walked across to it and looked\nin.\n\nHe saw immediately why my lord the Count had not answered, and that,\nindeed, he would never answer again.\n\nMy lord the Count lay flat on his back, his arms spread wide, his eyes\nstaring at the ceiling. He was still clad in his gold and scarlet\nevening clothes. But the great stain on the front of his coat was not\nthe same shade of scarlet as the rest of the cloth, and the stain had\na bullet hole in its center.\n\nSir Pierre looked at him without moving for a long moment. Then he\nstepped over, knelt, and touched one of the Count's hands with the\nback of his own. It was quite cool. He had been dead for hours.\n\n\"I knew someone would do you in sooner or later, my lord,\" said Sir\nPierre, almost regretfully.\n\nThen he rose from his kneeling position and walked out without another\nlook at his dead lord. He locked the door of the suite, pocketed the\nkey, and went back downstairs in the elevator.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMary, Lady Duncan stared out of the window at the morning sunlight and\nwondered what to do. The Angelus bell had awakened her from a fitful\nsleep in her chair, and she knew that, as a guest at Castle D'Evreux,\nshe would be expected to appear at Mass again this morning. But how\ncould she? How could she face the Sacramental Lord on the altar--to\nsay nothing of taking the Blessed Sacrament itself.\n\nStill, it would look all the more conspicuous if she did not show up\nthis morning after having made it a point to attend every morning with\nLady Alice during the first four days of this visit.\n\nShe turned and glanced at the locked and barred door of the bedroom.\n_He_ would not be expected to come. Laird Duncan used his wheelchair\nas an excuse, but since he had taken up black magic as a hobby he had,\nshe suspected, been actually afraid to go anywhere near a church.\n\nIf only she hadn't lied to him! But how could she have told the truth?\nThat would have been worse--infinitely worse. And now, because of that\nlie, he was locked in his bedroom doing only God and the Devil knew\nwhat.\n\nIf only he would come out. If he would only stop whatever it was he\nhad been doing for all these long hours--or at least finish it! Then\nthey could leave Evreux, make some excuse--any excuse--to get away.\nOne of them could feign sickness. Anything, anything to get them out\nof France, across the Channel, and back to Scotland, where they would\nbe safe!\n\nShe looked back out of the window, across the courtyard, at the\ntowering stone walls of the Great Keep and at the high window that\nopened into the suite of Edouard, Count D'Evreux.\n\nLast night she had hated him, but no longer. Now there was only room\nin her heart for fear.\n\nShe buried her face in her hands and cursed herself for a fool. There\nwere no tears left for weeping--not after the long night.\n\nBehind her, she heard the sudden noise of the door being unlocked, and\nshe turned.\n\nLaird Duncan of Duncan opened the door and wheeled himself out. He was\nfollowed by a malodorous gust of vapor from the room he had just left.\nLady Duncan stared at him.\n\nHe looked older than he had last night, more haggard and worn, and\nthere was something in his eyes she did not like. For a moment he said\nnothing. Then he wet his lips with the tip of his tongue. When he\nspoke, his voice sounded dazed.\n\n\"There is nothing to fear any more,\" he said. \"Nothing to fear at\nall.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Reverend Father James Valois Bright, Vicar of the Chapel of\nSaint-Esprit, had as his flock the several hundred inhabitants of the\nCastle D'Evreux. As such, he was the ranking priest--socially, not\nhierarchically--in the country. Not counting the Bishop and the\nChapter at the Cathedral, of course. But such knowledge did little\ngood for the Father's peace of mind. The turnout of the flock was\nabominably small for its size--especially for week-day Masses. The\nSunday Masses were well attended, of course; Count D'Evreux was there\npunctually at nine every Sunday, and he had a habit of counting the\nhouse. But he never showed up on weekdays, and his laxity had allowed\na certain further laxity to filter down through the ranks.\n\nThe great consolation was Lady Alice D'Evreux. She was a plain, simple\ngirl, nearly twenty years younger than her brother, the Count, and\nquite his opposite in every way. She was quiet where he was\nthundering, self-effacing where he was flamboyant, temperate where he\nwas drunken, and chaste where he was--\n\nFather Bright brought his thoughts to a full halt for a moment. He\nhad, he reminded himself, no right to make judgments of that sort. He\nwas not, after all, the Count's confessor; the Bishop was.\n\nBesides, he should have his mind on his prayers just now.\n\nHe paused and was rather surprised to notice that he had already put\non his alb, amice, and girdle, and he was aware that his lips had\nformed the words of the prayer as he had donned each of them.\n\n_Habit_, he thought, _can be destructive to the contemplative\nfaculty_.\n\nHe glanced around the sacristy. His server, the young son of the Count\nof Saint Brieuc, sent here to complete his education as a gentleman\nwho would some day be the King's Governor of one of the most\nimportant counties in Brittany, was pulling his surplice down over his\nhead. The clock said 7:11.\n\nFather Bright forced his mind Heavenward and repeated silently the\nvesting prayers that his lips had formed meaninglessly, this time\nputting his full intentions behind them. Then he added a short mental\nprayer asking God to forgive him for allowing his thoughts to stray in\nsuch a manner.\n\nHe opened his eyes and reached for his chasuble just as the sacristy\ndoor opened and Sir Pierre, the Count's Privy Secretary, stepped in.\n\n\"I must speak to you, Father,\" he said in a low voice. And, glancing\nat the young De Saint-Brieuc, he added: \"Alone.\"\n\nNormally, Father Bright would have reprimanded anyone who presumed to\nbreak into the sacristy as he was vesting for Mass, but he knew that\nSir Pierre would never interrupt without good reason. He nodded and\nwent outside in the corridor that led to the altar.\n\n\"What is it, Pierre?\" he asked.\n\n\"My lord the Count is dead. Murdered.\"\n\nAfter the first momentary shock, Father Bright realized that the news\nwas not, after all, totally unexpected. Somewhere in the back of his\nmind, it seemed he had always known that the Count would die by\nviolence long before debauchery ruined his health.\n\n\"Tell me about it,\" he said quietly.\n\nSir Pierre reported exactly what he had done and what he had seen.\n\n\"Then I locked the door and came straight here,\" he told the priest.\n\n\"Who else has the key to the Count's suite?\" Father Bright asked.\n\n\"No one but my lord himself,\" Sir Pierre answered, \"at least as far as\nI know.\"\n\n\"Where is his key?\"\n\n\"Still in the ring at his belt. I noticed that particularly.\"\n\n\"Very good. We'll leave it locked. You're certain the body was cold?\"\n\n\"Cold and waxy, Father.\"\n\n\"Then he's been dead many hours.\"\n\n\"Lady Alice will have to be told,\" Sir Pierre said.\n\nFather Bright nodded. \"Yes. The Countess D'Evreux must be informed of\nher succession to the County Seat.\" He could tell by the sudden\nmomentary blank look that came over Sir Pierre's face that the Privy\nSecretary had not yet realized fully the implications of the Count's\ndeath. \"I'll tell her, Pierre. She should be in her pew by now. Just\nstep into the church and tell her quietly that I want to speak to her.\nDon't tell her anything else.\"\n\n\"I understand, Father,\" said Sir Pierre.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere were only twenty-five or thirty people in the pews--most of them\nwomen--but Alice, Countess D'Evreux was not one of them. Sir Pierre\nwalked quietly and unobtrusively down the side aisle and out into the\nnarthex. She was standing there, just inside the main door, adjusting\nthe black lace mantilla about her head, as though she had just come in\nfrom outside. Suddenly, Sir Pierre was very glad he would not have to\nbe the one to break the news.\n\nShe looked rather sad, as always, her plain face unsmiling. The\njutting nose and square chin which had given her brother the Count a\nlook of aggressive handsomeness only made her look very solemn and\nrather sexless, although she had a magnificent figure.\n\n\"My lady,\" Sir Pierre said, stepping towards her, \"the Reverent Father\nwould like to speak to you before Mass. He's waiting at the sacristy\ndoor.\"\n\nShe held her rosary clutched tightly to her breast and gasped. Then\nshe said, \"Oh. Sir Pierre. I'm sorry; you quite surprised me. I didn't\nsee you.\"\n\n\"My apologies, my lady.\"\n\n\"It's all right. My thoughts were elsewhere. Will you take me to the\ngood Father?\"\n\nFather Bright heard their footsteps coming down the corridor before he\nsaw them. He was a little fidgety because Mass was already a minute\noverdue. It should have started promptly at 7:15.\n\nThe new Countess D'Evreux took the news calmly, as he had known she\nwould. After a pause, she crossed herself and said: \"May his soul rest\nin peace. I will leave everything in your hands, Father, Sir Pierre.\nWhat are we to do?\"\n\n\"Pierre must get on the teleson to Rouen immediately and report the\nmatter to His Highness. I will announce your brother's death and ask\nfor prayers for his soul--but I think I need say nothing about the\nmanner of his death. There is no need to arouse any more speculation\nand fuss than necessary.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said the Countess. \"Come, Sir Pierre; I will speak to the\nDuke, my cousin, myself.\"\n\n\"Yes, my lady.\"\n\nFather Bright returned to the sacristy, opened the missal, and changed\nthe placement of the ribbons. Today was an ordinary Feria; a Votive\nMass would not be forbidden by the rubics. The clock said 7:17. He\nturned to young De Saint-Brieuc, who was waiting respectfully.\n\"Quickly, my son--go and get the unbleached beeswax candles and put\nthem on the altar. Be sure you light them before you put out the white\nones. Hurry, now; I will be ready by the time you come back. Oh\nyes--and change the altar frontal. Put on the black.\"\n\n\"Yes, Father.\" And the lad was gone.\n\nFather Bright folded the green chasuble and returned it to the drawer,\nthen took out the black one. He would say a Requiem for the Souls of\nAll the Faithful Departed--and hope that the Count was among them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis Royal Highness, the Duke of Normandy, looked over the official\nletter his secretary had just typed for him. It was addressed to\n_Serenissimus Dominus Nostrus Iohannes Quartus, Dei Gratia, Angliae,\nFranciae, Scotiae, Hiberniae, et Novae Angliae, Rex, Imperator, Fidei\nDefensor_, ... \"Our Most Serene Lord, John IV, by the Grace of God\nKing and Emperor of England, France, Scotland, Ireland, and New\nEngland, Defender of the Faith, ...\"\n\nIt was a routine matter; simple notification to his brother, the King,\nthat His Majesty's most faithful servant, Edouard, Count of Evreux had\ndeparted this life, and asking His Majesty's confirmation of the\nCount's heir-at-law, Alice, Countess of Evreux as his lawful\nsuccessor.\n\nHis Highness finished reading, nodded, and scrawled his signature at\nthe bottom: _Richard Dux Normaniae_.\n\nThen, on a separate piece of paper, he wrote: \"Dear John, May I\nsuggest you hold up on this for a while? Edouard was a lecher and a\nslob, and I have no doubt he got everything he deserved, but we have\nno notion who killed him. For any evidence I have to the contrary, it\nmight have been Alice who pulled the trigger. I will send you full\nparticulars as soon as I have them. With much love, Your brother and\nservant, Richard.\"\n\nHe put both papers into a prepared envelope and sealed it. He wished\nhe could have called the king on the teleson, but no one had yet\nfigured out how to get the wires across the channel.\n\nHe looked absently at the sealed envelope, his handsome blond features\nthoughtful. The House of Plantagenet had endured for eight centuries,\nand the blood of Henry of Anjou ran thin in its veins, but the Norman\nstrain was as strong as ever, having been replenished over the\ncenturies by fresh infusions from Norwegian and Danish princesses.\nRichard's mother, Queen Helga, wife to His late Majesty, Henry X,\nspoke very few words of Anglo-French, and those with a heavy Norse\naccent.\n\nNevertheless, there was nothing Scandinavian in the language, manner,\nor bearing of Richard, Duke of Normandy. Not only was he a member of\nthe oldest and most powerful ruling family of Europe, but he bore a\nChristian name that was distinguished even in that family. Seven Kings\nof the Empire had borne the name, and most of them had been good\nKings--if not always \"good\" men in the nicey-nicey sense of the word.\nEven old Richard I, who'd been pretty wild during the first forty-odd\nyears of his life, had settled down to do a magnificent job of kinging\nfor the next twenty years. The long and painful recovery from the\nwound he'd received at the Siege of Chaluz had made a change in him\nfor the better.\n\nThere was a chance that Duke Richard might be called upon to uphold\nthe honor of that name as King. By law, Parliament must elect a\nPlantagenet as King in the event of the death of the present\nSovereign, and while the election of one of the King's two sons, the\nPrince of Wales and the Duke of Lancaster, was more likely than the\nelection of Richard, he was certainly not eliminated from the\nsuccession.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nMeantime, he would uphold the honor of his name as Duke of Normandy.\n\nMurder had been done; therefore justice must be done. The Count\nD'Evreux had been known for his stern but fair justice almost as well\nas he had been known for his profligacy. And, just as his pleasures\nhad been without temperance, so his justice had been untempered by\nmercy. Whoever had killed him would find both justice and mercy--in so\nfar as Richard had it within his power to give it.\n\nAlthough he did not formulate it in so many words, even mentally,\nRichard was of the opinion that some debauched woman or cuckolded man\nhad fired the fatal shot. Thus he found himself inclining toward mercy\nbefore he knew anything substantial about the case at all.\n\nRichard dropped the letter he was holding into the special mail pouch\nthat would be placed aboard the evening trans-Channel packet, and then\nturned in his chair to look at the lean, middle-aged man working at a\ndesk across the room.\n\n\"My lord Marquis,\" he said thoughtfully.\n\n\"Yes, Your Highness?\" said the Marquis of Rouen, looking up.\n\n\"How true are the stories one has heard about the late Count?\"\n\n\"True, Your Highness?\" the Marquis said thoughtfully. \"I would\nhesitate to make any estimate of percentages. Once a man gets a\nreputation like that, the number of his reputed sins quickly surpasses\nthe number of actual ones. Doubtless many of the stories one hears are\nof whole cloth; others may have only a slight basis in fact. On the\nother hand, it is highly likely that there are many of which we have\nnever heard. It is absolutely certain, however, that he has\nacknowledged seven illegitimate sons, and I dare say he has ignored a\nfew daughters--and these, mind you, with unmarried women. His\nadulteries would be rather more difficult to establish, but I think\nyour Highness can take it for granted that such escapades were far\nfrom uncommon.\"\n\nHe cleared his throat and then added, \"If Your Highness is looking for\nmotive, I fear there is a superabundance of persons with motive.\"\n\n\"I see,\" the Duke said. \"Well, we will wait and see what sort of\ninformation Lord Darcy comes up with.\" He looked up at the clock.\n\"They should be there by now.\"\n\nThen, as if brushing further thoughts on the subject from his mind, he\nwent back to work, picking up a new sheaf of state papers from his\ndesk.\n\nThe Marquis watched him for a moment and smiled a little to himself.\nThe young Duke took his work seriously, but was well-balanced about\nit. A little inclined to be romantic--but aren't we all at nineteen?\nThere was no doubt of his ability, nor of his nobility. The Royal\nBlood of England always came through.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"My lady,\" said Sir Pierre gently, \"the Duke's Investigators have\narrived.\"\n\nMy Lady Alice, Countess D'Evreux, was seated in a gold-brocade\nupholstered chair in the small receiving room off the Great Hall.\nStanding near her, looking very grave, was Father Bright. Against the\nblaze of color on the walls of the room, the two of them stood out\nlike ink blots. Father Bright wore his normal clerical black,\nunrelieved except for the pure white lace at collar and cuffs. The\nCountess wore unadorned black velvet, a dress which she had had to\nhave altered hurriedly by her dressmaker; she had always hated black\nand owned only the mourning she had worn when her mother died eight\nyears before. The somber looks on their faces seemed to make the black\nblacker.\n\n\"Show them in, Sir Pierre,\" the Countess said calmly.\n\nSir Pierre opened the door wider, and three men entered. One was\ndressed as one gently born; the other two wore the livery of the Duke\nof Normandy.\n\nThe gentleman bowed. \"I am Lord Darcy, Chief Criminal Investigator for\nHis Highness, the Duke, and your servant, my lady.\" He was a tall,\nbrown-haired man in his thirties with a rather handsome, lean face. He\nspoke Anglo-French with a definite English accent.\n\n\"My pleasure, Lord Darcy,\" said the Countess. \"This is our vicar,\nFather Bright.\"\n\n\"Your servant, Reverend Sir.\" Then he presented the two men with him.\nThe first was a scholarly-looking, graying man wearing pince-nez\nglasses with gold rims, Dr. Pateley, Physician. The second, a tubby,\nred-faced, smiling man, was Master Sean O Lochlainn, Sorcerer.\n\nAs soon as Master Sean was presented he removed a small, leather-bound\nfolder from his belt pouch and proffered it to the priest. \"My\nlicense, Reverend Father.\"\n\nFather Bright took it and glanced over it. It was the usual thing,\nsigned and sealed by the Archbishop of Rouen. The law was rather\nstrict on that point; no sorcerer could practice without the\npermission of the Church, and a license was given only after careful\nexamination for orthodoxy of practice.\n\n\"It seems to be quite in order, Master Sean,\" said the priest, handing\nthe folder back. The tubby little sorcerer bowed his thanks and\nreturned the folder to his belt pouch.\n\nLord Darcy had a notebook in his hand. \"Now, unpleasant as it may be,\nwe shall have to check on a few facts.\" He consulted his notes, then\nlooked up at Sir Pierre. \"You, I believe, discovered the body?\"\n\n\"That is correct, your lordship.\"\n\n\"How long ago was this?\"\n\nSir Pierre glanced at his wrist watch. It was 9:55. \"Not quite three\nhours ago, your lordship.\"\n\n\"At what time, precisely?\"\n\n\"I rapped on the door precisely at seven, and went in a minute or two\nlater--say 7:01 or 7:02.\"\n\n\"How do you know the time so exactly?\"\n\n\"My lord the Count,\" said Sir Pierre with some stiffness, \"insisted\nupon exact punctuality. I have formed the habit of referring to my\nwatch regularly.\"\n\n\"I see. Very good. Now, what did you do then?\"\n\nSir Pierre described his actions briefly.\n\n\"The door to his suite was not locked, then?\" Lord Darcy asked.\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"You did not expect it to be locked?\"\n\n\"No, sir. It has not been for seventeen years.\"\n\nLord Darcy raised one eyebrow in a polite query. \"Never?\"\n\n\"Not at seven o'clock, your lordship. My lord the Count always rose\npromptly at six and unlocked the door before seven.\"\n\n\"He did lock it at night, then?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nLord Darcy looked thoughtful and made a note, but he said nothing more\non that subject. \"When you left, you locked the door?\"\n\n\"That is correct, your lordship.\"\n\n\"And it has remained locked ever since?\"\n\nSir Pierce hesitated and glanced at Father Bright. The priest said:\n\"At 8:15, Sir Pierre and I went in. I wished to view the body. We\ntouched nothing. We left at 8:20.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMaster Sean O Lochlainn looked agitated. \"Er ... excuse me, Reverend\nSir. You didn't give him Holy Unction, I hope?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Father Bright. \"I thought it would be better to delay that\nuntil after the authorities has seen the ... er ... scene of the\ncrime. I wouldn't want to make the gathering of evidence any more\ndifficult than necessary.\"\n\n\"Quite right,\" murmured Lord Darcy.\n\n\"No blessings, I trust, Reverend Sir?\" Master Sean persisted. \"No\nexorcisms or--\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" Father Bright interrupted somewhat testily. \"I believe I\ncrossed myself when I saw the body, but nothing more.\"\n\n\"Crossed _yourself_, sir. Nothing else?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Well, that's all right, then. Sorry to be so persistent, Reverend\nSir, but any miasma of evil that may be left around is a very\nimportant clue, and it shouldn't be dispersed until it's been checked,\nyou see.\"\n\n\"_Evil?_\" My lady the Countess looked shocked.\n\n\"Sorry, my lady, but--\" Master Sean began contritely.\n\nBut Father Bright interrupted by speaking to the Countess. \"Don't\ndistress yourself, my daughter; these men are only doing their duty.\"\n\n\"Of course. I understand. It's just that it's so--\" She shuddered\ndelicately.\n\nLord Darcy cast Master Sean a warning look, then asked politely, \"Has\nmy lady seen the deceased?\"\n\n\"No,\" she said. \"I will, however, if you wish.\"\n\n\"We'll see,\" said Lord Darcy. \"Perhaps it won't be necessary. May we\ngo up to the suite now?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" the Countess said. \"Sir Pierre, if you will?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lady.\"\n\nAs Sir Pierre unlocked the emblazoned door, Lord Darcy said: \"Who else\nsleeps on this floor?\"\n\n\"No one else, your lordship,\" Sir Pierre said. \"The entire floor is ...\nwas ... reserved for my lord the Count.\"\n\n\"Is there any way up besides that elevator?\"\n\nSir Pierre turned and pointed toward the other end of the short\nhallway. \"That leads to the staircase,\" he said, pointing to a massive\noaken door, \"but it's kept locked at all times. And, as you can see,\nthere is a heavy bar across it. Except for moving furniture in and out\nor something like that, it's never used.\"\n\n\"No other way up or down, then?\"\n\nSir Pierre hesitated. \"Well, yes, your lordship, there is. I'll show\nyou.\"\n\n\"A secret stairway?\"\n\n\"Yes, your lordship.\"\n\n\"Very well. We'll look at it after we've seen the body.\"\n\nLord Darcy, having spent an hour on the train down from Rouen, was\nanxious to see the cause of the trouble at last.\n\nHe lay in the bedroom, just as Sir Pierre and Father Bright had left\nhim.\n\n\"If you please, Dr. Pateley,\" said his lordship.\n\nHe knelt on one side of the corpse and watched carefully while Pateley\nknelt on the other side and looked at the face of the dead man. Then\nhe touched one of the hands and tried to move an arm. \"Rigor has set\nin--even to the fingers. Single bullet hole. Rather small caliber--I\nshould say a .28 or .34--hard to tell until I've probed out the\nbullet. Looks like it went right through the heart, though. Hard to\ntell about powder burns; the blood has soaked the clothing and dried.\nStill, these specks ... hm-m-m. Yes. Hm-m-m.\"\n\nLord Darcy's eyes took in everything, but there was little enough to\nsee on the body itself. Then his eye was caught by something that gave\noff a golden gleam. He stood up and walked over to the great canopied\nfour-poster bed, then he was on his knees again, peering under it. A\ncoin? No.\n\nHe picked it up carefully and looked at it. A button. Gold,\nintricately engraved in an Arabesque pattern, and set in the center\nwith a single diamond. How long had it lain there? Where had it come\nfrom? Not from the Count's clothing, for his buttons were smaller,\nengraved with his arms, and had no gems. Had a man or a woman dropped\nit? There was no way of knowing at this stage of the game.\n\nDarcy turned to Sir Pierre. \"When was this room last cleaned?\"\n\n\"Last evening, your lordship,\" the secretary said promptly. \"My lord\nwas always particular about that. The suite was always to be swept and\ncleaned during the dinner hour.\"\n\n\"Then this must have rolled under the bed at some time after dinner.\nDo you recognize it? The design is distinctive.\"\n\nThe Privy Secretary looked carefully at the button in the palm of\nLord Darcy's hand without touching it. \"I ... I hesitate to say,\" he\nsaid at last. \"It looks like ... but I'm not sure--\"\n\n\"Come, come, Chevalier! Where do you think you _might_ have seen it?\nOr one like it.\" There was a sharpness in the tone of his voice.\n\n\"I'm not trying to conceal anything, your lordship,\" Sir Pierre said\nwith equal sharpness. \"I said I was not sure. I still am not, but it\ncan be checked easily enough. If your lordship will permit me--\" He\nturned and spoke to Dr. Pateley, who was still kneeling by the body.\n\"May I have my lord the Count's keys, doctor?\"\n\nPateley glanced up at Lord Darcy, who nodded silently. The physician\ndetached the keys from the belt and handed them to Sir Pierre.\n\nThe Privy Secretary looked at them for a moment, then selected a small\ngold key. \"This is it,\" he said, separating it from the others on the\nring. \"Come with me, your lordship.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDarcy followed him across the room to a broad wall covered with a\ngreat tapestry that must have dated back to the sixteenth century. Sir\nPierre reached behind it and pulled a cord. The entire tapestry slid\naside like a panel, and Lord Darcy saw that it was supported on a\ntrack some ten feet from the floor. Behind it was what looked at first\nlike ordinary oak paneling, but Sir Pierre fitted the small key into\nan inconspicuous hole and turned. Or, rather, tried to turn.\n\n\"That's odd,\" said Sir Pierre. \"It's not locked!\"\n\nHe took the key out and pressed on the panel, shoving sideways with\nhis hand to move it aside. It slid open to reveal a closet.\n\nThe closet was filled with women's clothing of all kinds, and styles.\n\nLord Darcy whistled soundlessly.\n\n\"Try that blue robe, your lordship,\" the Privy Secretary said. \"The\none with the--Yes, that's the one.\"\n\nLord Darcy took it off its hanger. The same buttons. They matched. And\nthere was one missing from the front! Torn off! \"Master Sean!\" he\ncalled without turning.\n\nMaster Sean came with a rolling walk. He was holding an oddly-shaped\nbronze thing in his hand that Sir Pierre didn't quite recognize. The\nsorcerer was muttering. \"Evil, that there is! Faith, and the\nvibrations are all over the place. Yes, my lord?\"\n\n\"Check this dress and the button when you get round to it. I want to\nknow when the two parted company.\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord.\" He draped the robe over one arm and dropped the button\ninto a pouch at his belt. \"I can tell you one thing, my lord. You talk\nabout an evil miasma, this room has got it!\" He held up the object in\nhis hand. \"There's an underlying background--something that has been\nhere for years, just seeping in. But on top of that, there's a hellish\nbig blast of it superimposed. Fresh it is, and very strong.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't be surprised, considering there was murder done here\nlast night--or very early this morning,\" said Lord Darcy.\n\n\"Hm-m-m, yes. Yes, my lord, the death is there--but there's something\nelse. Something I can't place.\"\n\n\"You can tell that just by holding that bronze cross in your hand?\"\nSir Pierre asked interestedly.\n\nMaster Sean gave him a friendly scowl. \"'Tisn't quite a cross, sir.\nThis is what is known as a _crux ansata_. The ancient Egyptians called\nit an _ankh_. Notice the loop at the top instead of the straight piece\nyour true cross has. Now, your true cross--if it were properly\nenergized, blessed, d'ye see--your true cross would tend to dissipate\nthe evil. The _ankh_ merely vibrates to evil because of the closed\nloop at the top, which makes a return circuit. And it's not energized\nby blessing, but by another ... um ... spell.\"\n\n\"Master Sean, we have a murder to investigate,\" said Lord Darcy.\n\nThe sorcerer caught the tone of his voice and nodded quickly. \"Yes, my\nlord.\" And he walked rollingly away.\n\n\"Now where's that secret stairway you mentioned, Sir Pierre?\" Lord\nDarcy asked.\n\n\"This way, your lordship.\"\n\nHe led Lord Dacy to a wall at right angles to the outer wall and slid\nback another tapestry.\n\n\"Good Heavens,\" Darcy muttered, \"does he have something concealed\nbehind every arras in the place?\" But he didn't say it loud enough for\nthe Privy Secretary to hear.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis time, what greeted them was a solid-seeming stone wall. But Sir\nPierre pressed in on one small stone, and a section of the wall swung\nback, exposing a stairway.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" Darcy said. \"I see what he did. This is the old spiral\nstairway that goes round the inside of the Keep. There are two\ndoorways at the bottom. One opens into the courtyard, the other is a\npostern gate through the curtain wall to the outside--but that was\nclosed up in the sixteenth century, so the only way out is into the\ncourtyard.\"\n\n\"Your lordship knows Castle D'Evreux, then?\" Sir Pierre said. The\nknight himself was nearly fifty, while Darcy was only in his thirties,\nand Sir Pierre had no recollection of Darcy's having been in the\ncastle before.\n\n\"Only by the plans in the Royal Archives. But I have made it a point\nto--\" He stopped. \"Dear me,\" he interrupted himself mildly, \"what is\nthat?\"\n\n\"That\" was something that had been hidden by the arras until Sir\nPierre had slid it aside, and was still showing only a part of itself.\nIt lay on the floor a foot or so from the secret door.\n\nDarcy knelt down and pulled the tapestry back from the object. \"Well,\nwell. A .28 two-shot pocket gun. Gold-chased, beautifully engraved,\nmother-of-pearl handle. A regular gem.\" He picked it up and examined\nit closely. \"One shot fired.\"\n\nHe stood up and showed it to Sir Pierre. \"Ever see it before?\"\n\nThe Privy Secretary looked at the weapon closely. Then he shook his\nhead. \"Not that I recall, your lordship. It certainly isn't one of the\nCount's guns.\"\n\n\"You're certain?\"\n\n\"Quite certain, your lordship. I'll show you the gun collection if you\nwant. My lord the Count didn't like tiny guns like that; he preferred\na larger caliber. He would never have owned what he considered a toy.\"\n\n\"Well, we'll have to look into it.\" He called over Master Sean again\nand gave the gun into his keeping. \"And keep your eyes open for\nanything else of interest, Master Sean. So far, everything of interest\nbesides the late Count himself has been hiding under beds or behind\narrases. Check everything. Sir Pierre and I are going for a look down\nthis stairway.\"\n\nThe stairway was gloomy, but enough light came in through the arrow\nslits spaced at intervals along the outer way to illuminate the\ninterior. It spiraled down between the inner and outer walls of the\nGreat Keep, making four complete circuits before it reached ground\nlevel. Lord Darcy looked carefully at the steps, the walls, and even\nthe low, arched overhead as he and Sir Pierre went down.\n\nAfter the first circuit, on the floor beneath the Count's suite, he\nstopped. \"There was a door here,\" he said, pointing to a rectangular\narea in the inner wall.\n\n\"Yes, your lordship. There used to be an opening at every floor, but\nthey were all sealed off. It's quite solid, as you can see.\"\n\n\"Where would they lead if they were open?\"\n\n\"The county offices. My own office, the clerk's offices, the\nconstabulary on the first floor. Below are the dungeons. My lord the\nCount was the only one who lived in the Keep itself. The rest of the\nhousehold live above the Great Hall.\"\n\n\"What about guests?\"\n\n\"They're usually housed in the east wing. We only have two house\nguests at the moment. Laird and Lady Duncan have been with us for four\ndays.\"\n\n\"I see.\" They went down perhaps four more steps before Lord Darcy\nasked quietly, \"Tell me, Sir Pierre, were you privy to _all_ of Count\nD'Evreux's business?\"\n\nAnother four steps down before Sir Pierre answered. \"I understand what\nyour lordship means,\" he said. Another two steps. \"No, I was not. I\nwas aware that my lord the Count engaged in certain ... er ... shall\nwe say, liaisons with members of the opposite sex. However--\"\n\nHe paused, and in the gloom, Lord Darcy could see his lips tighten.\n\"However,\" he continued, \"I did not procure for my lord, if that is\nwhat you're driving at. I am not and never have been a pimp.\"\n\n\"I didn't intend to suggest that you had, good knight,\" said Lord\nDarcy in a tone that strongly implied that the thought had actually\nnever crossed his mind. \"Not at all. But certainly there is a\ndifference between 'aiding and abetting' and simple knowledge of what\nis going on.\"\n\n\"Oh. Yes. Yes, of course. Well, one cannot, of course, be the\nsecretary-in-private of a gentleman such as my lord the Count for\nseventeen years without knowing something of what is going on, you're\nright. Yes. Yes. Hm-m-m.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLord Darcy smiled to himself. Not until this moment had Sir Pierre\nrealized how much he actually _did_ know. In loyalty to his lord, he\nhad literally kept his eyes shut for seventeen years.\n\n\"I realize,\" Lord Darcy said smoothly, \"that a gentleman would never\nimplicate a lady nor besmirch the reputation of another gentleman\nwithout due cause and careful consideration. However,\"--like the\nknight, he paused a moment before going on--\"although we are aware\nthat he was not discreet, was he particular?\"\n\n\"If you mean by that, did he confine his attentions to those of gentle\nbirth, your lordship, then I can say, no he did not. If you mean did\nhe confine his attentions to the gentler sex, then I can only say\nthat, as far as I know, he did.\"\n\n\"I see. That explains the closet full of clothes.\"\n\n\"Beg pardon, your lordship?\"\n\n\"I mean that if a girl or woman of the lower classes were to come\nhere, he would have proper clothing for them to wear--in spite of the\nsumptuary laws to the contrary.\"\n\n\"Quite likely, your lordship. He was most particular about clothing.\nCouldn't stand a woman who was sloppily dressed or poorly dressed.\"\n\n\"In what way?\"\n\n\"Well. Well, for instance, I recall once that he saw a very pretty\npeasant girl. She was dressed in the common style, of course, but she\nwas dressed neatly and prettily. My lord took a fancy to her. He said,\n'Now there's a lass who knows how to wear clothes. Put her in decent\napparel, and she'd pass for a princess.' But a girl, who had a pretty\nface and a fine figure, made no impression on him unless she wore her\nclothing well, if you see what I mean, your lordship.\"\n\n\"Did you ever know him to fancy a girl who dressed in an offhand\nmanner?\" Lord Darcy asked.\n\n\"Only among the gently born, your lordship. He'd say, 'Look at Lady\nSo-and-so! Nice wench, if she'd let me teach her how to dress.' You\nmight say, your lordship, that a woman could be dressed commonly or\nsloppily, but not both.\"\n\n\"Judging by the stuff in that closet,\" Lord Darcy said, \"I should say\nthat the late Count had excellent taste in feminine dress.\"\n\nSir Pierre considered. \"Hm-m-m. Well, now, I wouldn't exactly say so,\nyour lordship. He knew _how_ clothes should be worn, yes. But he\ncouldn't pick out a woman's gown of his own accord. He could choose\nhis own clothing with impeccable taste, but he'd not any real notion\nof how a woman's clothing should go, if you see what I mean. All he\nknew was how good clothing should be worn. But he knew nothing about\ndesign for women's clothing.\"\n\n\"Then how did he get that closet full of clothes?\" Lord Darcy asked,\npuzzled.\n\nSir Pierre chuckled. \"Very simply, your lordship. He knew that the\nLady Alice had good taste, so he secretly instructed that each piece\nthat Lady Alice ordered should be made in duplicate. With small\nvariations, of course. I'm certain my lady wouldn't like it if she\nknew.\"\n\n\"I dare say not,\" said Lord Darcy thoughtfully.\n\n\"Here is the door to the courtyard,\" said Sir Pierre. \"I doubt that it\nhas been opened in broad daylight for many years.\" He selected a key\nfrom the ring of the late Count and inserted it into the keyhole. The\ndoor swung back, revealing a large crucifix attached to its outer\nsurface. Lord Darcy crossed himself. \"Lord in Heaven,\" he said softly,\n\"what is this?\"\n\nHe looked out into a small shrine. It was walled off from the\ncourtyard and had a single small entrance some ten feet from the\ndoorway. There were four _prie-dieus_--small kneeling benches--ranged\nin front of the doorway.\n\n\"If I may explain, your lordship--\" Sir Pierre began.\n\n\"No need to,\" Lord Darcy said in a hard voice. \"It's rather obvious.\nMy lord the Count was quite ingenious. This is a relatively\nnewly-built shrine. Four walls and a crucifix against the castle wall.\nAnyone could come in here, day or night, for prayer. No one who came\nin would be suspected.\" He stepped out into the small enclosure and\nswung around to look at the door. \"And when that door is closed, there\nis no sign that there is a door behind the crucifix. If a woman came\nin here, it would be assumed that she came for prayer. But if she knew\nof that door--\" His voice trailed off.\n\n\"Yes, your lordship,\" said Sir Pierre. \"I did not approve, but I was\nin no position to disapprove.\"\n\n\"I understand.\" Lord Darcy stepped out to the doorway of the little\nshrine and took a quick glance about. \"Then anyone within the castle\nwalls could come in here,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes, your lordship.\"\n\n\"Very well. Let's go back up.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the small office which Lord Darcy and his staff had been assigned\nwhile conducting the investigation, three men watched while a fourth\nconducted a demonstration on a table in the center of the room.\n\nMaster Sean O Lochlainn held up an intricately engraved gold button\nwith an Arabesque pattern and a diamond set in the center.\n\nHe looked at the other three. \"Now, my lord, your Reverence, and\ncolleague Doctor, I call your attention to this button.\"\n\nDr. Pateley smiled and Father Bright looked stern. Lord Darcy merely\nstuffed tobacco--imported from the southern New England counties on\nthe Gulf--into a German-made porcelain pipe. He allowed Master Sean a\ncertain amount of flamboyance; good sorcerers were hard to come by.\n\n\"Will you hold the robe, Dr. Pateley? Thank you. Now, stand back.\nThat's it. Thank you. Now, I place the button on the table, a good ten\nfeet from the robe.\" Then he muttered something under his breath and\ndusted a bit of powder on the button. He made a few passes over it\nwith his hands, paused, and looked up at Father Bright. \"If you will,\nReverend Sir?\"\n\nFather Bright solemnly raised his right hand, and, as he made the Sign\nof the Cross, said: \"May this demonstration, O God, be in strict\naccord with the truth, and may the Evil One not in any way deceive us\nwho are witnesses thereto. In the Name of the Father and of the Son\nand of the Holy Spirit. Amen.\"\n\n\"Amen,\" the other three chorused.\n\nMaster Sean crossed himself, then muttered something under his breath.\n\nThe button leaped from the table, slammed itself against the robe\nwhich Dr. Pateley held before him, and stuck there as though it had\nbeen sewed on by an expert.\n\n\"Ha!\" said Master Sean. \"As I thought!\" He gave the other three men a\nbroad, beaming smile. \"The two were definitely connected!\"\n\nLord Darcy looked bored. \"Time?\" he asked.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"In a moment, my lord,\" Master Sean said apologetically. \"In a\nmoment.\" While the other three watched, the sorcerer went through more\nspells with the button and the robe, although none were quite so\nspectacular as the first demonstration. Finally, Master Sean said:\n\"About eleven thirty last night they were torn apart, my lord. But I\nshouldn't like to make it any more definite than to say between\neleven and midnight. The speed with which it returned to its place\nshows that it was ripped off very rapidly, however.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said Lord Darcy. \"Now the bullet, if you please.\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord. This will have to be a bit different.\" He took more\nparaphernalia out of his large, symbol-decorated carpet bag. \"The Law\nof Contagion, gently-born sirs, is a tricky thing to work with. If a\nman doesn't know how to handle it, he can get himself killed. We had\nan apprentice o' the guild back in Cork who might have made a good\nsorcerer in time. He had the talent--unfortunately, he didn't have the\ngood sense to go with it. According to the Law of Contagion any two\nobjects which have ever been in contact with each other have an\naffinity for each other which is directly proportional to the product\nof the degree of relevancy of the contact and the length of time they\nwere in contact and inversely proportional to the length of time since\nthey have ceased to be in contact.\" He gave a smiling glance to the\npriest. \"That doesn't apply strictly to relics of the saints, Reverend\nSir; there's another factor enters in there, as you know.\"\n\nAs he spoke, the sorcerer was carefully clamping the little handgun\ninto the padded vise so that its barrel was parallel to the surface of\nthe table.\n\n\"Anyhow,\" he went on, \"this apprentice, all on his own, decided to get\nrid of the cockroaches in his house--a simple thing, if one knows how\nto go about it. So he collected dust from various cracks and crannies\nabout the house, dust which contained, of course, the droppings of the\npests. The dust, with the appropriate spells and ingredients, he\nboiled. It worked fine. The roaches all came down with a raging fever\nand died. Unfortunately, the clumsy lad had poor laboratory technique.\nHe allowed three drops of his own perspiration to fall into the\nsteaming pot over which he was working, and the resulting fever killed\nhim, too.\"\n\nBy this time, he had put the bullet which Dr. Pateley had removed from\nthe Count's body on a small pedestal so that it was exactly in line\nwith the muzzle of the gun. \"There now,\" he said softly.\n\nThen he repeated the incantation, and the powdering that he had used\non the button. As the last syllable was formed by his lips, the bullet\nvanished with a _ping_! In its vise, the little gun vibrated.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Master Sean. \"No question there, eh? That's the death\nweapon, all right, my lord. Yes. Time's almost exactly the same as\nthat of the removal of the button. Not more than a few seconds later.\nForms a picture, don't it, my lord? His lordship the Count jerks a\nbutton off the girl's gown, she outs with a gun and plugs him.\"\n\nLord Darcy's handsome face scowled. \"Let's not jump to any hasty\nconclusions, my good Sean. There is no evidence whatever that he was\nkilled by a woman.\"\n\n\"Would a man be wearing that gown, my lord?\"\n\n\"Possibly,\" said Lord Darcy. \"But who says that anyone was wearing it\nwhen the button was removed?\"\n\n\"Oh.\" Master Sean subsided into silence. Using a small ramrod, he\nforced the bullet out of the chamber of the little pistol.\n\n\"Father Bright,\" said Lord Darcy, \"will the Countess be serving tea\nthis afternoon?\"\n\nThe priest looked suddenly contrite. \"Good heavens! None of you has\neaten yet! I'll see that something is sent up right away, Lord Darcy.\nIn the confusion--\"\n\nLord Darcy held up a hand. \"I beg your pardon, Father; that wasn't\nwhat I meant. I'm sure Master Sean and Dr. Pateley would appreciate a\nlittle something, but I can wait until tea time. What I was thinking\nwas that perhaps the Countess would ask her guests to tea. Does she\nknow Laird and Lady Duncan well enough to ask for their sympathetic\npresence on such an afternoon as this?\"\n\nFather Bright's eyes narrowed a trifle. \"I dare say it could be\narranged, Lord Darcy. You will be there?\"\n\n\"Yes--but I may be a trifle late. That will hardly matter at an\ninformal tea.\"\n\nThe priest glanced at his watch. \"Four o'clock?\"\n\n\"I should think that would do it,\" said Lord Darcy.\n\nFather Bright nodded wordlessly and left the room.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDr. Pateley took off his pince-nez and polished the lenses carefully\nwith a silk handkerchief. \"How long will your spell keep the body\nincorrupt, Master Sean?\" he asked.\n\n\"As long as it's relevant. As soon as the case is solved, or we have\nenough data to solve the case--as the case may be, heh heh--he'll\nstart to go. I'm not a saint, you know; it takes powerful motivation\nto keep a body incorrupt for years and years.\"\n\nSir Pierre was eying the gown that Pateley had put on the table. The\nbutton was still in place, as if held there by magnetism. He didn't\ntouch it. \"Master Sean, I don't know much about magic,\" he said, \"but\ncan't you find out who was wearing this robe just as easily as you\nfound out that the button matched?\"\n\nMaster Sean wagged his head in a firm negative. \"No, sir. 'Tisn't\nrelevant sir. The relevancy of the integrated dress-as-a-whole is\nquite strong. So is that of the seamstress or tailor who made the\ngarment, and that of the weaver who made the cloth. But, except in\ncertain circumstances, the person who wears or wore the garment has\nlittle actual relevancy to the garment itself.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I don't understand,\" said Sir Pierre, looking puzzled.\n\n\"Look at it like this, sir: That gown wouldn't be what it is if the\nweaver hadn't made the cloth in that particular way. It wouldn't be\nwhat it is if the seamstress hadn't cut it in a particular way and\nsewed it in a specific manner. You follow, sir? Yes. Well, then, the\nconnections between garment-and-weaver and garment-and-seamstress are\nstrongly relevant. But this dress would still be pretty much what it\nis if it had stayed in the closet instead of being worn. No\nrelevance--or very little. Now, if it were a well-worn garment, that\nwould be different--that is, if it had always been worn by the same\nperson. Then, you see, sir, the garment-as-a-whole is what it is\nbecause of the wearing, and the wearer becomes relevant.\"\n\nHe pointed at the little handgun he was still holding in his hand.\n\"Now you take your gun, here, sir. The--\"\n\n\"It isn't my gun,\" Sir Pierre interrupted firmly.\n\n\"I was speaking rhetorically, sir,\" said Master Sean with infinite\npatience. \"This gun or any other gun in general, if you see what I\nmean, sir. It's even harder to place the ownership of a gun. Most of\nthe wear on a gun is purely mechanical. It don't matter _who_ pulls\nthe trigger, you see, the erosion by the gases produced in the\nchamber, and the wear caused by the bullet passing through the barrel\nwill be the same. You see, sir, 'tisn't relevant _to the gun_ who\npulled its trigger or what it's fired at. The bullet's a slightly\ndifferent matter. To the bullet, it _is_ relevant which gun it was\nfired from and what it hit. All these things simply have to be taken\ninto account, Sir Pierre.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said the knight. \"Very interesting, Master Sean.\" Then he\nturned to Lord Darcy. \"Is there anything else, your lordship? There's\na great deal of county business to be attended to.\"\n\nLord Darcy waved a hand. \"Not at the moment, Sir Pierre. I understand\nthe pressures of government. Go right ahead.\"\n\n\"Thank you, your lordship. If anything further should be required, I\nshall be in my office.\"\n\nAs soon as Sir Pierre had closed the door, Lord Darcy held out his\nhand toward the sorcerer. \"Master Sean; the gun.\"\n\nMaster Sean handed it to him. \"Ever see one like it before?\" he asked,\nturning it over in his hands.\n\n\"Not _exactly_ like it, my lord.\"\n\n\"Come, come, Sean; don't be so cautious. I am no sorcerer, but I don't\nneed to know the Laws of Similarity to be able to recognise an\n_obvious_ similarity.\"\n\n\"Edinburgh,\" said Master Sean flatly.\n\n\"Exactly. Scottish work. The typical Scot gold work; remarkable\nbeauty. And look at that lock. It has 'Scots' written all over it--and\nmore. 'Edinburgh', as you said.\"\n\nDr. Pateley, having replaced his carefully polished glasses, leaned\nover and peered at the weapon in Lord Darcy's hand. \"Couldn't it be\nItalian, my lord? Or Moorish? In Moorish Spain, they do work like\nthat.\"\n\n\"No Moorish gunsmith would put a hunting scene on the butt,\" Lord\nDarcy said flatly, \"and the Italians wouldn't have put heather and\nthistles in the field surrounding the huntsman.\"\n\n\"But the _FdM_ engraved on the barrel,\" said Dr. Pateley, \"indicates\nthe--\"\n\n\"Ferrari of Milan,\" said Lord Darcy. \"Exactly. But the barrel is of\nmuch newer work than the rest. So are the chambers. This is a fairly\nold gun--fifty years old, I'd say. The lock and the butt are still in\nexcellent condition, indicating that it has been well cared for, but\nfrequent usage--or a single accident--could ruin the barrel and\nrequire the owner to get a replacement. It was replaced by Ferrari.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Dr. Pateley somewhat humbled.\n\n\"If we open the lock ... Master Sean, hand me your small screwdriver.\nThank you. If we open the lock, we will find the name of one of the\nfinest gunsmiths of half a century ago--a man whose name has not yet\nbeen forgotten--Hamish Graw of Edinburgh. Ah! There! You see?\" They\ndid.\n\nHaving satisfied himself on that point, Lord Darcy closed the lock\nagain. \"Now, men, we have the gun located. We also know that a guest\nin this very castle is Laird Duncan of Duncan. The Duncan of Duncan\nhimself. A Scot's laird who was, fifteen years ago, His Majesty's\nMinister Plenipotentiary to the Free Grand Duchy of Milan. That\nsuggests to me that it would be indeed odd if there were not some\nconnection between Laird Duncan and this gun. Eh?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Come, come, Master Sean,\" said Lord Darcy, rather impatiently. \"We\nhaven't all the time in the world.\"\n\n\"Patience, my lord; patience,\" said the little sorcerer calmly. \"Can't\nhurry these things, you know.\" He was kneeling in front of a large,\nheavy traveling chest in the bedroom of the guest apartment occupied\ntemporarily by Laird and Lady Duncan, working with the lock. \"One\nposition of a lock is just as relevant as the other so you can't work\nwith the bolt. But the pin-tumblers in the cylinder, now, that's a\ndifferent matter. A lock's built so that the breaks in the tumblers\nare not related to the surface of the cylinder when the key is out,\nbut there is a relation when the key's _in_, so by taking advantage of\nthat relevancy--Ah!\"\n\nThe lock clicked open.\n\nLord Darcy raised the lid gently.\n\n\"Carefully, my lord!\" Master Sean said in a warning voice. \"He's got a\nspell on the thing! Let me do it.\" He made Lord Darcy stand back and\nthen lifted the lid of the heavy trunk himself. When it was leaning\nback against the wall, gaping open widely on its hinges, Master Sean\ntook a long look at the trunk and its lid without touching either of\nthem. There was a second lid on the trunk, a thin one obviously\noperated by a simple bolt.\n\nMaster Sean took his sorcerer's staff, a five-foot, heavy rod made of\nthe wood of the quicken tree or mountain ash, and touched the inner\nlid. Nothing happened. He touched the bolt. Nothing.\n\n\"Hm-m-m,\" Master Sean murmured thoughtfully. He glanced around the\nroom, and his eyes fell on a heavy stone doorstop. \"That ought to do\nit.\" He walked over, picked it up, and carried it back to the chest.\nThen he put it on the rim of the chest in such a position that if the\nlid were to fall it would be stopped by the doorstop.\n\nThen he put his hand in as if to lift the inner lid.\n\nThe heavy outer lid swung forward and down of its own accord, moving\nwith blurring speed, and slammed viciously against the doorstop.\n\nLord Darcy massaged his right wrist gently, as if he felt where the\nlid would have hit if he had tried to open the inner lid. \"Triggered\nto slam if a human being sticks a hand in there, eh?\"\n\n\"Or a head, my lord. Not very effectual if you know what to look for.\nThere are better spells than that for guarding things. Now we'll see\nwhat his lordship wants to protect so badly that he practices sorcery\nwithout a license.\" He lifted the lid again, and then opened the inner\nlid. \"It's safe now, my lord. _Look at this!_\"\n\nLord Darcy had already seen. Both men looked in silence at the\ncollection of paraphernalia on the first tray of the chest. Master\nSean's busy fingers carefully opened the tissue paper packing of one\nafter another of the objects. \"A human skull,\" he said. \"Bottles of\ngraveyard earth. Hm-m-m--this one is labeled 'virgin's blood.' And\nthis! A Hand of Glory!\"\n\nIt was a mummified human hand, stiff and dry and brown, with the\nfingers partially curled, as though they were holding an invisible\nball three inches or so in diameter. On each of the fingertips was a\nshort candle-stub. When the hand was placed on its back, it would act\nas a candelabra.\n\n\"That pretty much settles it, eh, Master Sean?\" Lord Darcy said.\n\n\"Indeed, my lord. At the very least, we can get him for possession of\nmaterials. Black magic is a matter of symbolism and intent.\"\n\n\"Very well. I want a complete list of the contents of that chest. Be\nsure to replace everything as it was and relock the trunk.\" He tugged\nthoughtfully at an earlobe. \"So Laird Duncan has the Talent, eh?\nInteresting.\"\n\n\"Aye. But not surprising, my lord,\" said Master Sean without looking\nup from his work. \"It's in the blood. Some attribute it to the\nDedannans, who passed through Scotland before they conquered Ireland\nthree thousand years ago, but, however that may be, the Talent runs\nstrong in the Sons of Gael. It makes me boil to see it misused.\"\n\nWhile Master Sean talked, Lord Darcy was prowling around the room,\nreminding one of a lean tomcat who was certain that there was a mouse\nconcealed somewhere.\n\n\"It'll make Laird Duncan boil if he isn't stopped,\" Lord Darcy\nmurmured absently.\n\n\"Aye, my lord,\" said Master Sean. \"The mental state necessary to use\nthe Talent for black sorcery is such that it invariably destroys the\nuser--but, if he knows what he's doing, a lot of other people are hurt\nbefore he finally gets his.\"\n\nLord Darcy opened the jewel box on the dresser. The usual traveling\njewelry--enough, but not a great choice.\n\n\"A man's mind turns in on itself when he's taken up with hatred and\nthoughts of revenge,\" Master Sean droned on. \"Or, if he's the type who\n_enjoys_ watching others suffer, or the type who doesn't care but is\nwilling to do anything for gain, then his mind is already warped and\nthe misuse of the Talent just makes it worse.\"\n\nLord Darcy found what he was looking for in a drawer, just underneath\nsome neatly folded lingerie. A small holster, beautifully made of\nFlorentine leather, gilded and tooled. He didn't need Master Sean's\nsorcery to tell him that the little pistol fit it like a hand in a\nglove.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFather Bright felt as though he had been walking a tightrope for\nhours. Laird and Lady Duncan had been talking in low, controlled\nvoices that betrayed an inner nervousness, but Father Bright realized\nthat he and the Countess had been doing the same thing. The Duncan of\nDuncan had offered his condolences on the death of the late Count with\nthe proper air of suppressed sorrow, as had Mary, Lady Duncan. The\nCountess had accepted them solemnly and with gratitude. But Father\nBright was well aware that no one in the room--possibly, he thought,\nno one in the world--regretted the Count's passing.\n\nLaird Duncan sat in his wheelchair, his sharp Scots features set in a\nsad smile that showed an intent to be affable even though great sorrow\nweighed heavily upon him. Father Bright noticed it and realized that\nhis own face had the same sort of expression. No one was fooling\nanyone else, of that the priest was certain--but for anyone to admit\nit would be the most boorish breach of etiquette. But there was a\nhaggardness, a look of increased age about the Laird's countenance\nthat Father Bright did not like. His priestly intuition told him\nclearly that there was a turmoil of emotion in the Scotsman's mind\nthat was ... well, _evil_ was the only word for it.\n\nLady Duncan was, for the most part, silent. In the past fifteen\nminutes, since she and her husband had come to the informal tea, she\nhad spoken scarcely a dozen words. Her face was masklike, but there\nwas the same look of haggardness about her eyes as there was in her\nhusband's face. But the priest's emphatic sense told him that the\nemotion here was fear, simple and direct. His keen eyes had noticed\nthat she wore a shade too much make-up. She had almost succeeded in\ncovering up the faint bruise on her right cheek, but not completely.\n\nMy lady the Countess D'Evreux was all sadness and unhappiness, but\nthere was neither fear nor evil there. She smiled politely and talked\nquietly. Father Bright would have been willing to bet that not one of\nthe four of them would remember a word that had been spoken.\n\nFather Bright had placed his chair so that he could keep an eye on the\nopen doorway and the long hall that led in from the Great Keep. He\nhoped Lord Darcy would hurry. Neither of the guests had been told that\nthe Duke's Investigator was here, and Father Bright was just a little\napprehensive about the meeting. The Duncans had not even been told\nthat the Count's death had been murder, but he was certain that they\nknew.\n\nFather Bright saw Lord Darcy come in through the door at the far end\nof the hall. He murmured a polite excuse and rose. The other three\naccepted his excuses with the same politeness and went on with their\ntalk. Father Bright met Lord Darcy in the hall.\n\n\"Did you find what you were looking for, Lord Darcy?\" the priest asked\nin a low tone.\n\n\"Yes,\" Lord Darcy said. \"I'm afraid we shall have to arrest Laird\nDuncan.\"\n\n\"Murder?\"\n\n\"Perhaps. I'm not yet certain of that. But the charge will be black\nmagic. He has all the paraphernalia in a chest in his room. Master\nSean reports that a ritual was enacted in the bedroom last night. Of\ncourse, that's out of my jurisdiction. You, as a representative of the\nChurch, will have to be the arresting officer.\" He paused. \"You don't\nseem surprised, Reverence.\"\n\n\"I'm not,\" Father Bright admitted. \"I felt it. You and Master Sean\nwill have to make out a sworn deposition before I can act.\"\n\n\"I understand. Can you do me a favor?\"\n\n\"If I can.\"\n\n\"Get my lady the Countess out of the room on some pretext or other.\nLeave me alone with her guests. I do not wish to upset my lady any\nmore than absolutely necessary.\"\n\n\"I think I can do that. Shall we go in together?\"\n\n\"Why not? But don't mention why I am here. Let them assume I am just\nanother guest.\"\n\n\"Very well.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll three occupants of the room glanced up as Father Bright came in\nwith Lord Darcy. The introductions were made: Lord Darcy humbly begged\nthe pardon of his hostess for his lateness. Father Bright noticed the\nsame sad smile on Lord Darcy's handsome face as the others were\nwearing.\n\nLord Darcy helped himself from the buffet table and allowed the\nCountess to pour him a large cup of hot tea. He mentioned nothing\nabout the recent death. Instead, he turned the conversation toward the\nwild beauty of Scotland and the excellence of the grouse shooting\nthere.\n\nFather Bright had not sat down again. Instead, he left the room once\nmore. When he returned, he went directly to the Countess and said, in\na low, but clearly audible voice: \"My lady, Sir Pierre Morlaix has\ninformed me that there are a few matters that require your attention\nimmediately. It will require only a few moments.\"\n\nMy lady the Countess did not hesitate, but made her excuses\nimmediately. \"Do finish your tea,\" she added. \"I don't think I shall\nbe long.\"\n\nLord Darcy knew the priest would not lie, and he wondered what sort of\narrangement had been made with Sir Pierre. Not that it mattered except\nthat Lord Darcy had hoped it would be sufficiently involved for it to\nkeep the Countess busy for at least ten minutes.\n\nThe conversation, interrupted but momentarily, returned to grouse.\n\n\"I haven't done any shooting since my accident,\" said Laird Duncan,\n\"but I used to enjoy it immensely. I still have friends up every year\nfor the season.\"\n\n\"What sort of weapon do you prefer for grouse?\" Lord Darcy asked.\n\n\"A one-inch bore with a modified choke,\" said the Scot. \"I have a pair\nthat I favor. Excellent weapons.\"\n\n\"Of Scottish make?\"\n\n\"No, no. English. Your London gunsmiths can't be beat for shotguns.\"\n\n\"Oh. I thought perhaps your lordship had had all your guns made in\nScotland.\" As he spoke, he took the little pistol out of his coat\npocket and put it carefully on the table.\n\nThere was a sudden silence, then Laird Duncan said in an angry voice:\n\"What is this? Where did you get that?\"\n\nLord Darcy glanced at Lady Duncan, who had turned suddenly pale.\n\"Perhaps,\" he said coolly, \"Lady Duncan can tell us.\"\n\nShe shook her head and gasped. For a moment, she had trouble in\nforming words or finding her voice. Finally: \"No. No. I know nothing.\nNothing.\"\n\nBut Laird Duncan looked at her oddly.\n\n\"You do not deny that it is your gun, my lord?\" Lord Darcy asked. \"Or\nyour wife's, as the case may be.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"_Where did you get it?_\" There was a dangerous quality in the\nScotsman's voice. He had once been a powerful man, and Lord Darcy\ncould see his shoulder muscles bunching.\n\n\"From the late Count D'Evreux's bedroom.\"\n\n\"What was it doing there?\" There was a snarl in the Scot's voice, but\nLord Darcy had the feeling that the question was as much directed\ntoward Lady Duncan as it was to himself.\n\n\"One of the things it was doing there was shooting Count D'Evreux\nthrough the heart.\"\n\nLady Duncan slumped forward in a dead faint, overturning her teacup.\nLaird Duncan made a grab at the gun, ignoring his wife. Lord Darcy's\nhand snaked out and picked up the weapon before the Scot could touch\nit. \"No, no, my lord,\" he said mildly. \"This is evidence in a murder\ncase. We mustn't tamper with the King's evidence.\"\n\nHe wasn't prepared for what happened next. Laird Duncan roared\nsomething obscene in Scots Gaelic, put his hands on the arms of his\nwheelchair, and, with a great thrust of his powerful arms and\nshoulders, shoved himself up and forward, toward Lord Darcy, across\nthe table from him. His arms swung up toward Lord Darcy's throat as\nthe momentum of his body carried him toward the investigator.\n\nHe might have made it, but the weakness of his legs betrayed him. His\nwaist struck the edge of the massive oaken table, and most of his\nforward momentum was lost. He collapsed forward, his hands still\ngrasping toward the surprised Englishman. His chin came down hard on\nthe table top. Then he slid back, taking the tablecloth and the china\nand silverware with him. He lay unmoving on the floor. His wife did\nnot even stir except when the tablecloth tugged at her head.\n\nLord Darcy had jumped back, overturning his chair. He stood on his\nfeet, looking at the two unconscious forms.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I don't think there's any permanent damage done to either,\" said Dr.\nPateley an hour later. \"Lady Duncan was suffering from shock, of\ncourse, but Father Bright brought her round in a hurry. She's a devout\nwoman, I think, even if a sinful one.\"\n\n\"What about Laird Duncan?\" Lord Darcy asked.\n\n\"Well, that's a different matter. I'm afraid that his back injury was\naggravated, and that crack on the chin didn't do him any good. I don't\nknow whether Father Bright can help him or not. Healing takes the\nco-operation of the patient. I did all I could for him, but I'm just a\nchirurgeon, not a practitioner of the Healing Art. Father Bright has\nquite a good reputation in that line, however, and he may be able to\ndo his lordship some good.\"\n\nMaster Sean shook his head dolefully. \"His Reverence has the Talent,\nthere's no doubt of that, but now he's pitted against another man who\nhas it--a man whose mind is bent on self-destruction in the long run.\"\n\n\"Well, that's none of my affair,\" said Dr. Pateley. \"I'm just a\ntechnician. I'll leave healing up to the Church, where it belongs.\"\n\n\"Master Sean,\" said Lord Darcy, \"there is still a mystery here. We\nneed more evidence. What about the eyes?\"\n\nMaster Sean blinked. \"You mean the picture test, my lord?\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"It won't stand up in court, my lord,\" said the sorcerer.\n\n\"I'm aware of that,\" said Lord Darcy testily.\n\n\"Eye test?\" Dr. Pateley asked blankly. \"I don't believe I understand.\"\n\n\"It's not often used,\" said Master Sean. \"It is a psychic phenomenon\nthat sometimes occurs at the moment of death--especially a violent\ndeath. The violent emotional stress causes a sort of backfiring of the\nmind, if you see what I mean. As a result, the image in the mind of\nthe dying person is returned to the retina. By using the proper\nsorcery, this image can be developed and the last thing the dead man\nsaw can be brought out.\n\n\"But it's a difficult process even under the best of circumstances,\nand usually the conditions aren't right. In the first place, it\ndoesn't always occur. It never occurs, for instance, when the person\nis expecting the attack. A man who is killed in a duel, or who is shot\nafter facing the gun for several seconds, has time to adjust to the\nsituation. Also, death must occur almost instantly. If he lingers,\neven for a few minutes, the effect is lost. And, naturally if the\nperson's eyes are closed at the instant of death, nothing shows up.\"\n\n\"Count D'Evreux's eyes were open,\" Dr. Pateley said. \"They were still\nopen when we found him. How long after death does the image remain?\"\n\n\"Until the cells of the retina die and lose their identity. Rarely\nmore than twenty-four hours, usually much less.\"\n\n\"It hasn't been twenty-four hours yet,\" said Lord Darcy, \"and there is\na chance that the Count was taken completely by surprise.\"\n\n\"I must admit, my lord,\" Master Sean said thoughtfully, \"that the\nconditions seem favorable. I shall attempt it. But don't put any hopes\non it, my lord.\"\n\n\"I shan't. Just do your best, Master Sean. If there is a sorcerer in\npractice who can do the job, it is you.\"\n\n\"Thank you, my lord. I'll get busy on it right away,\" said the\nsorcerer with a subdued glow of pride.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTwo hours later, Lord Darcy was striding down the corridor of the\nGreat Hall, Master Sean following up as best he could, his\n_caorthainn_-wood staff in one hand and his big carpet bag in the\nother. He had asked Father Bright and the Countess D'Evreux to meet\nhim in one of the smaller guest rooms. But the Countess came to meet\nhim.\n\n\"My Lord Darcy,\" she said, her plain face looking worried and unhappy,\n\"is it true that you suspect Laird and Lady Duncan of this murder?\nBecause, if so, I must--\"\n\n\"No longer, my lady,\" Lord Darcy cut her off quickly. \"I think we can\nshow that neither is guilty of murder--although, of course, the black\nmagic charge must still be held against Laird Duncan.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" she said, \"but--\"\n\n\"Please, my lady,\" Lord Darcy interrupted again, \"let me explain\neverything. Come.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and led the way to the room where\nFather Bright was waiting.\n\nThe priest stood waiting, his face showing tenseness.\n\n\"Please,\" said Lord Darcy. \"Sit down, both of you. This won't take\nlong. My lady, may Master Sean make use of that table over there?\"\n\n\"Certainly, my lord,\" the Countess said softly, \"certainly.\"\n\n\"Thank you my lady. Please, please--sit down. This won't take long.\nPlease.\"\n\nWith apparent reluctance, Father Bright and my lady the Countess sat\ndown in two chairs facing Lord Darcy. They paid little attention to\nwhat Master Sean O Lochlainn was doing; their eyes were on Lord Darcy.\n\n\"Conducting an investigation of this sort is not an easy thing,\" he\nbegan carefully. \"Most murder cases could be easily solved by your\nChief Man-at-Arms. We find that well-trained county police, in by far\nthe majority of cases, can solve the mystery easily--and in most cases\nthere is very little mystery. But, by His Imperial Majesty's law, the\nChief Man-at-Arms must call in a Duke's Investigator if the crime is\ninsoluble or if it involves a member of the aristocracy. For that\nreason, you were perfectly correct to call His Highness the Duke as\nsoon as murder had been discovered.\" He leaned back in his chair. \"And\nit has been clear from the first that my lord the late Count was\nmurdered.\"\n\nFather Bright started to say something, but Lord Darcy cut him off\nbefore he could speak. \"By 'murder', Reverend Father, I mean that he\ndid not die a natural death--by disease or heart trouble or accident\nor what-have-you. I should, perhaps, use the word 'homicide'.\n\n\"Now the question we have been called upon to answer is simply this:\nWho was responsible for the homicide?\"\n\nThe priest and the countess remained silent, looking at Lord Darcy as\nthough he were some sort of divinely inspired oracle.\n\n\"As you know ... pardon me, my lady, if I am blunt ... the late Count\nwas somewhat of a playboy. No. I will make that stronger. He was a\nsatyr, a lecher; he was a man with a sexual obsession.\n\n\"For such a man, if he indulges in his passions--which the late Count\nmost certainly did--there is usually but one end. Unless he is a man\nwho has a winsome personality--which he did not--there will be someone\nwho will hate him enough to kill him. Such a man inevitably leaves\nbehind him a trail of wronged women and wronged men.\n\n\"One such person may kill him.\n\n\"One such person did.\n\n\"But we must find the person who did and determine the extent of his\nor her guilt. That is my purpose.\n\n\"Now, as to the facts. We know that Edouard has a secret stairway\nwhich led directly to his suite. Actually, the secret was poorly kept.\nThere were many women--common and noble--who knew of the existence of\nthat stairway and knew how to enter it. If Edouard left the lower door\nunlocked, anyone could come up that stairway. He has another lock in\nthe door of his bedroom, so only someone who was invited could come\nin, even if she ... or he ... could get into the stairway. He was\nprotected.\n\n\"Now here is what actually happened that night. I have evidence, by\nthe way, and I have the confessions of both Laird and Lady Duncan. I\nwill explain how I got those confessions in a moment.\n\n\"_Primus_: Lady Duncan had an assignation with Count D'Evreux last\nnight. She went up the stairway to his room. She was carrying with her\na small pistol. She had had an affair with Edouard, and she had been\nrebuffed. She was furious. But she went to his room.\n\n\"He was drunk when she arrived--in one of the nasty moods with which\nboth of you are familiar. She pleaded with him to accept her again as\nhis mistress. He refused. According to Lady Duncan, he said: 'I don't\nwant you! You're not fit to be in the same room with _her_!'\n\n\"The emphasis is Lady Duncan's, not my own.\n\n\"Furious, she drew a gun--the little pistol which killed him.\"\n\nThe Countess gasped. \"But Mary _couldn't_ have--\"\n\n\"_Please!_\" Lord Darcy slammed the palm of his hand on the arm of his\nchair with an explosive sound. \"My lady, you _will_ listen to what I\nhave to say!\"\n\nHe was taking a devil of a chance, he knew. The Countess was his\nhostess and had every right to exercise her prerogatives. But Lord\nDarcy was counting on the fact that she had been under Count\nD'Evreux's influence so long that it would take her a little time to\nrealize that she no longer had to knuckle under to the will of a man\nwho shouted at her. He was right. She became silent.\n\nFather Bright turned to her quickly and said: \"Please, my daughter.\nWait.\"\n\n\"Your pardon, my lady,\" Lord Darcy continued smoothly. \"I was about to\nexplain to you why I know Lady Duncan could not have killed your\nbrother. There is the matter of the dress. We are certain that the\ngown that was found in Edouard's closet was worn by the killer. _And\nthat gown could not possibly have fit Lady Duncan!_ She's much too ...\ner ... hefty.\n\n\"She has told me her story, and, for reasons I will give you later, I\nbelieve it. When she pointed the gun at your brother, she really had\nno intention of killing him. She had no intention of pulling the\ntrigger. Your brother knew this. He lashed out and slapped the side of\nher head. She dropped the pistol and fell, sobbing, to the floor. He\ntook her roughly by the arm and 'escorted' her down the stairway. He\nthrew her out.\n\n\"Lady Duncan, hysterical, ran to her husband.\n\n\"And then, when he had succeeded in calming her down a bit, she\nrealized the position she was in. She knew that Laird Duncan was a\nviolent, a warped man--very similar to Edouard, Count D'Evreux. She\ndared not tell him the truth, but she had to tell him something. So\nshe lied.\n\n\"She told him that Edouard had asked her up in order to tell her\nsomething of importance; that that 'something of importance' concerned\nLaird Duncan's safety; that the Count told her that he knew of Laird\nDuncan's dabbling in black magic; that he threatened to inform Church\nauthorities on Laird Duncan unless she submitted to his desires; that\nshe had struggled with him and ran away.\"\n\nLord Darcy spread his hands. \"This was, of course, a tissue of lies.\nBut Laird Duncan believed everything. So great was his ego that he\ncould not believe in her infidelity, although he has been paralyzed\nfor five years.\"\n\n\"How can you be certain that Lady Duncan told the truth?\" Father\nBright asked warily.\n\n\"Aside from the matter of the gown--which Count D'Evreux kept only for\nwomen of the common class, _not_ the aristocracy--we have the\ntestimony of the actions of Laird Duncan himself. We come then to--\n\n\"_Secondus_: Laird Duncan could not have committed the murder\nphysically. _How could a man who was confined to a wheelchair go up\nthat flight of stairs?_ I submit to you that it would have been\nphysically impossible.\n\n\"The possibility that he has been pretending all these years, and that\nhe is actually capable of walking, was disproved three hours ago,\nwhen he actually injured himself by trying to throttle me. His legs\nare incapable of carrying him even one step--much less carrying him to\nthe top of that stairway.\"\n\nLord Darcy folded his hands complacently.\n\n\"There remains,\" said Father Bright, \"the possibility that Laird\nDuncan killed Count D'Evreux by psychical, by magical means.\"\n\nLord Darcy nodded. \"That is indeed possible, Reverend Sir, as we both\nknow. But not in this instance. Master Sean assures me, and I am\ncertain that you will concur, that a man killed by sorcery, by black\nmagic, dies of internal malfunction, not of a bullet through the\nheart.\n\n\"In effect, the Black Sorcerer induces his enemy to kill himself by\npsychosomatic means. He dies by what is technically known as psychic\ninduction. Master Sean informs me that the commonest--and\ncrudest--method of doing this is by the so-called 'simalcrum\ninduction' method. That is, by the making of an image--usually, but\nnot necessarily, of wax--and, using the Law of Similarity, inducing\ndeath. The Law of Contagion is also used, since the fingernails, hair,\nspittle, and so on, of the victim are usually incorporated into the\nimage. Am I correct, Father?\"\n\nThe priest nodded. \"Yes. And, contrary to the heresies of certain\nmaterialists, it is not at all necessary that the victim be informed\nof the operation--although, admittedly, it can, in certain\ncircumstances, aid the process.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Lord Darcy. \"But it is well known that material\nobjects can be moved by a competent sorcerer--'black' or 'white'.\nWould you explain to my lady the Countess why her brother could not\nhave been killed in that manner?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFather Bright touched his lips with the tip of his tongue and then\nturned to the girl sitting next to him. \"There is a lack of relevancy.\nIn this case, the bullet must have been relevant either to the heart\nor to the gun. To have traveled with a velocity great enough to\npenetrate, the relevancy to the heart must have been much greater than\nthe relevancy to the gun. Yet the test, witnessed by myself, that was\nperformed by Master Sean indicates that this was not so. The bullet\nreturned to the gun, not to your brother's heart. The evidence, my\ndear, is conclusive that the bullet was propelled by purely physical\nmeans, and was propelled from the gun.\"\n\n\"Then what was it Laird Duncan did?\" the Countess asked.\n\n\"_Tertius_:\" said Lord Darcy. \"Believing what his wife had told him,\nLaird Duncan flew into a rage. He determined to kill your brother. He\nused an induction spell. But the spell backfired and almost killed\nhim.\n\n\"There are analogies on a material plane. If one adds mineral spirits\nand air to a fire, the fire will be increased. But if one adds ash,\nthe fire will be put out.\n\n\"In a similar manner, if one attacks a living being psychically it\nwill die--but if one attacks a dead thing in such a manner, the\npsychic energy will be absorbed, to the detriment of the person who\nhas used it.\n\n\"In theory, we could charge Laird Duncan with attempted murder, for\nthere is no doubt that he did attempt to kill your brother, my lady.\n_But your brother was already dead at the time!_\n\n\"The resultant dissipation of psychic energy rendered Laird Duncan\nunconscious for several hours, during which Lady Duncan waited in\nsuspenseful fear.\n\n\"Finally, when Laird Duncan regained consciousness, he realized what\nhad happened. He knew that your brother was already dead when he\nattempted the spell. He thought, therefore, that Lady Duncan had\nkilled the Count.\n\n\"On the other hand, Lady Duncan was perfectly well aware that she had\nleft Edouard alive and well. So she thought the black magic of her\nhusband had killed her erstwhile lover.\"\n\n\"Each was trying to protect the other,\" Father Bright said. \"Neither\nis completely evil, then. There may be something we can do for Laird\nDuncan.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't know about that, Father,\" Lord Darcy said. \"The Healing\nArt is the Church's business, not mine.\" He realized with some\namusement that he was paraphrasing Dr. Pateley. \"What Laird Duncan had\nnot known,\" he went on quickly, \"was that his wife had taken a gun up\nto the Count's bedroom. That put a rather different light on her\nvisit, you see. That's why he flew into such a towering rage at\nme--not because I was accusing him or his wife of murder, but because\nI had cast doubt on his wife's behavior.\"\n\nHe turned his head to look at the table where the Irish sorcerer was\nworking. \"Ready, Master Sean?\"\n\n\"Aye, my lord. All I have to do is set up the screen and light the\nlantern in the projector.\"\n\n\"Go ahead, then.\" He looked back at Father Bright and the Countess.\n\"Master Sean has a rather interesting lantern slide I want you to look\nat.\"\n\n\"The most successful development I've ever made, if I may say so, my\nlord,\" the sorcerer said.\n\n\"Proceed.\"\n\nMaster Sean opened the shutter on the projector, and a picture sprang\ninto being on the screen.\n\nThere were gasps from Father Bright and the Countess.\n\nIt was a woman. She was wearing the gown that had hung in the Count's\ncloset. A button had been torn off, and the gown gaped open. Her right\nhand was almost completely obscured by a dense cloud of smoke.\nObviously she had just fired a pistol directly at the onlooker.\n\nBut that was not what had caused the gasps.\n\nThe girl was beautiful. Gloriously, ravishingly beautiful. It was not\na delicate beauty. There was nothing flower-like or peaceful in it. It\nwas a beauty that could have but one effect on a normal human male.\nShe was the most physically desirable woman one could imagine.\n\n_Retro mea, Sathanas_, Father Bright thought wryly. _She's almost\nobscenely beautiful._\n\nOnly the Countess was unaffected by the desirability of the image.\nShe saw only the startling beauty.\n\n\"Has neither of you seen that woman before? I thought not,\" said Lord\nDarcy. \"Nor had Laird or Lady Duncan. Nor Sir Pierre.\n\n\"Who is she? We don't know. But we can make a few deductions. She must\nhave come to the Count's room by appointment. This is quite obviously\nthe woman Edouard mentioned to Lady Duncan--the woman, the 'she' that\nthe Scots noblewoman could not compare with. It is almost certain she\nis a commoner; otherwise she would not be wearing a robe from the\nCount's collection. She must have changed right there in the bedroom.\nThen she and the Count quarreled--about what, we do not know. The\nCount had previously taken Lady Duncan's pistol away from her and had\nevidently carelessly let it lay on that table you see behind the girl.\nShe grabbed it and shot him. Then she changed clothes again, hung up\nthe robe, and ran away. No one saw her come or go. The Count had\ndesigned the stairway for just that purpose.\n\n\"Oh, we'll find her, never fear--now that we know what she looks like.\n\n\"At any rate,\" Lord Darcy concluded, \"the mystery is now solved to my\ncomplete satisfaction, and I shall so report to His Highness.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRichard, Duke of Normandy, poured two liberal portions of excellent\nbrandy into a pair of crystal goblets. There was a smile of\nsatisfaction on his youthful face as he handed one of the goblets to\nLord Darcy. \"Very well done, my lord,\" he said. \"Very well done.\"\n\n\"I am gratified to hear Your Highness say so,\" said Lord Darcy,\naccepting the brandy.\n\n\"But how were you so certain that it was _not_ someone from outside\nthe castle? Anyone could have come in through the main gate. That's\nalways open.\"\n\n\"True, Your Highness. But the door at the foot of the stairway was\n_locked_. Count D'Evreux locked it after he threw Lady Duncan out.\nThere is no way of locking or unlocking it from the outside; the door\nhad not been forced. No one could have come in that way, nor left that\nway, after Lady Duncan was so forcibly ejected. The only other way\ninto the Count's suite was by the other door, and that door was\nunlocked.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Duke Richard. \"I wonder why she went up there in the\nfirst place?\"\n\n\"Probably because he asked her to. Any other woman would have known\nwhat she was getting into if she accepted an invitation to Count\nD'Evreux's suite.\"\n\nThe Duke's handsome face darkened. \"No. One would hardly expect that\nsort of thing from one's own brother. She was perfectly justified in\nshooting him.\"\n\n\"Perfectly, Your Highness. And had she been anyone but the heiress,\nshe would undoubtedly have confessed immediately. Indeed, it was all I\ncould do to keep her from confessing to me when she thought I was\ngoing to charge the Duncans with the killing. But she knew that it was\nnecessary to preserve the reputation of her brother and herself. Not\nas private persons, but as Count and Countess, as officers of the\nGovernment of His Imperial Majesty the King. For a man to be known as\na rake is one thing. Most people don't care about that sort of thing\nin a public official so long as he does his duty and does it\nwell--which, as Your Highness knows, the Count did.\n\n\"But to be shot to death while attempting to assault his own\nsister--that is quite another thing. She was perfectly justified in\nattempting to cover it up. And she will remain silent unless someone\nelse is accused of the crime.\"\n\n\"Which, of course, will not happen,\" said Duke Richard. He sipped at\nthe brandy, then said: \"She will make a good Countess. She has\njudgment and she can keep cool under duress. After she had shot her\nown brother, she might have panicked, but she didn't. How many women\nwould have thought of simply taking off the damaged gown and putting\non its duplicate from the closet?\"\n\n\"Very few,\" Lord Darcy agreed. \"That's why I never mentioned that I\nknew the Count's wardrobe contained dresses identical to her own. By\nthe way, Your Highness, if any good Healer, like Father Bright, had\nknown of those duplicate dresses, he would have realized that the\nCount had a sexual obsession about his sister. He would have known\nthat all the other women the Count went after were sister\nsubstitutes.\"\n\n\"Yes; of course. And none of them measure up.\" He put his goblet on\nthe table. \"I shall inform the King my brother that I recommended the\nnew Countess whole-heartedly. No word of this must be put down in\nwriting, of course. You know and I know and the King must know. No one\nelse must know.\"\n\n\"One other knows,\" said Lord Darcy.\n\n\"Who?\" The Duke looked startled.\n\n\"Father Bright.\"\n\nDuke Richard looked relieved. \"Naturally. He won't tell her that we\nknow, will he?\"\n\n\"I think Father Bright's discretion can be relied upon.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the dimness of the confessional, Alice, Countess D'Evreux knelt and\nlistened to the voice of Father Bright.\n\n\"I shall not give you any penance, my child, for you have committed no\nsin--that is, in so far as the death of your brother is concerned. For\nthe rest of your sins, you must read and memorize the third chapter of\n'The Soul and The World,' by St. James Huntington.\"\n\nHe started to pronounce the absolution, but the Countess said:\n\n\"I don't understand one thing. That picture. That wasn't me. I never\nsaw such a gorgeously beautiful girl in my life. And I'm so plain. I\ndon't understand.\"\n\n\"Had you looked more closely, my child, you would have seen that the\nface did look like yours--only it was idealized. When a subjective\nreality is made objective, distortions invariably show up; that is why\nsuch things cannot be accepted as evidence of objective reality in\ncourt.\" He paused. \"To put it another way, my child: Beauty is in the\neye of the beholder.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Eyes Have It, by Gordon Randall Garrett\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE EYES HAVE IT ***\n\n***** This file should be named 30833.txt or 30833.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/0/8/3/30833/\n\nProduced by Sankar Viswanathan, Greg Weeks, and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
