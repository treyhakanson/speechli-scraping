He\nunderstood. Mankind's age-old hatred, brought from his native planet\nto the distant stars, was evil symbolized by a coil in a twisted,\nbelly-path across the ground. And on Nahuatl, as well as a dozen other\nworlds, Wass was the serpent.\n\nA night wind was rising, stirring the exotic, half-dozen other worlds'\nfoliage planted cunningly on the terrace to simulate the mystery of an\noff-world jungle.\n\n\"Hume?\" The inquiry seemed to come out of thin air over his head.\n\n\"Hume,\" he repeated his own name calmly.\n\nA shaft of light brilliant enough to dazzle the eyes struck through\nthe massed vegetation, revealing a path. Hume lingered for a moment,\noffering a counterstroke of indifference in what he had always known\nwould be a test of wits. Wass was Veep of a shadowy empire, but that\nwas apart from the world in which Ras Hume moved.\n\nHe strode deliberately down the corridor illuminated between leaf and\nblossom walls. A grotesque lump of crystal leered at him from the\nheart of a tharsala lilly bed. The intricate carving of a devilish\nnonhuman set of features was a work of alien art. Tendrils of smoke\ncurled from the thing's flat nostrils, and Hume sniffed the scent of a\nnarcotic he recognized. He smiled. Such measures might soften up the\nusual civ Wass interviewed here. But a star pilot turned out-hunter\nwas immunized against such mind clouding.\n\nThere was a door, the lintel and posts of which had more carving, but\nthis time Terran, Hume thought--old, very old. Perhaps rumor was\nright, Milfors Wass might be truly native Terran and not second,\nthird, nor fourth generation star stock as most of those who reached\nNahuatl were.\n\nThe room beyond that elaborately carved entrance was, in contrast,\nsevere. Rust walls were bare of any pattern save an oval disk of\ncloudy golden shimmer behind the chair at the long table of solid ruby\nrock from Nahuatl's poisonous sister planet of Xipe. Without a pause\nhe walked to the chair and seated himself without invitation to wait\nin the empty room.\n\nThat clouded oval might be a com device. Hume refused to look at it\nafter his first glance. This interview was to be person to person. If\nWass did not appear within a reasonable length of time he would leave.\n\nAnd Hume hoped to any unseen watcher he presented the appearance of a\nman not impressed by stage settings. After all he was now in the\nseller's space boots, and it was a seller's market.\n\nRas Hume rested his right hand on the table. Against the polished glow\nof the stone, the substance of it was flesh-tanned brown--a perfect\nmatch for his left. And the subtle difference between true flesh and\nfalse was no hindrance in the use of those fingers or their strength.\nSave that it had pushed him out of command of a cargo-cum-liner and\nhurled him down from the pinnacle of a star pilot. There were bitter\nbrackets about his mouth, set there by that hand as deeply as if\ncarved with a knife.\n\nIt had been four years--planet time--since he had lifted the Rigal\nRover from the launch pad on Sargon Two. He had suspected it might be\na tricky voyage with young Tors Wazalitz, who was a third owner of the\nKogan-Bors-Wazalitz line, and a Gratz chewer. But one did not argue\nwith the owners, except when the safety of the ship was concerned. The\nRigal Rover had made a crash landing at Alexbut, and a badly injured\npilot had brought her in by will, hope and a faith he speedily lost.\n\nHe received a plasta-hand, the best the medical center could supply\nand a pension for life, forced by the public acclaim for a man who had\nsaved ships and lives. Then--the sack because a crazed Tors Wazalitz\nwas dead. They dared not try to stick Hume with a murder charge; the\nvoyage record tapes had been shot straight through to the Patrol\nCouncil, and the evidence on those could be neither faked nor tampered\nwith. They could not give him a quick punishment, but they could try\nto arrange a slow death. The word had gone out that Hume was off pilot\nboards. They had tried to keep him out of space.\n\nAnd they might have done it, too, had he been the usual type of pilot,\nknowing only his trade. But some odd streak of restlessness had always\nled him to apply for the rim runs, the very first flights to newly\nopened worlds. Outside of the survey men, there were few qualified\npilots of his seniority who possessed such a wide and varied knowledge\nof the galactic frontiers.\n\nSo when he learned that the ships' boards were irrevocably closed to\nhim, Hume had signed up with the Out-Hunters' Guild. There was a vast\ndifference between lifting a liner from a launching pad and guiding\nciv hunters to worlds surveyed and staked out for their trips into the\nwild. Hume relished the exploration part--he disliked the\nleading-by-the-hand of nine-tenths of the Guild's clients.\n\nBut if he had not been in the Guild service he would never have made\nthat find on Jumala. That lucky, lucky find! Hume's plasta-flesh\nfingers curved, their nails drew across the red surface of the table.\nAnd where was Wass? He was about to rise and go when the golden oval\non the wall smoked, its substance thinning to a mist as a man stepped\nthrough to the floor.\n\nThe newcomer was small compared to the former pilot, but he had\nbreadth of shoulder which made the upper part of his torso overbalance\nhis thin hips and legs. He was dressed most conservatively except for\na jeweled plaque resting on the tightly stretched gray silk of his\nupper tunic at heart level. Unlike Hume he wore no visible arms belt,\nbut the other did not doubt that there were a number of devices\nconcealed in that room to counter the efforts of any assassin.\n\nThe man from the mirror spoke with a flat, toneless voice. His black\nhair had been shaven well above his ears, the locks left on top of his\nskull trained into a kind of bird's crest. As Hume, his visible areas\nof flesh were deeply browned, but by nature rather than exposure to\nspace, the pilot guessed. His features were harsh, with a prominent\nnose, a back-slanting forehead, eyes dark, long and large, with heavy\nlids.\n\n\"Now--\" He spread both his hands, palm down and flat on the table, a\ngesture Hume found himself for some unknown reason copying. \"You have\na proposition?\"\n\nBut the pilot was not to be hurried, any more than he was to be\ninfluenced by Wass' stage-settings.\n\n\"I have an idea,\" he corrected.\n\n\"There are many ideas.\" Wass leaned back in his chair, but he did not\nremove his hands from the table. \"Perhaps one in a thousand is the\nkernel of something useful. For the rest, there is no need to trouble\na man.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" Hume returned evenly. \"But that one idea in a thousand can\nalso pay off in odds of a million to one, when and if a man has it.\"\n\n\"And you have such a one?\"\n\n\"I have such a one.\" It was Hume's role now to impress the other by\nhis unshakable confidence. He had studied all the possibilities. Wass\nwas the right man, perhaps the only partner he could find. But Wass\nmust not know that.\n\n\"On Jumala?\" Wass returned.\n\nIf that stare and statement was intended to rattle Hume it was a\nwasted shot. To discover that he had just returned from that frontier\nplanet required no ingenuity on the Veep's part.\n\n\"Perhaps.\"\n\n\"Come, Out-Hunter Hume. We are both busy men, this is no time to play\ntricks with words and hints. Either you have made a find worth the\nattention of my organization or you have not. Let me be the judge.\"\n\nThis was it--the corner of no return. But Wass had his own code. The\nVeep had established his tight control of his lawless organization by\nset rules, and one of them was, don't be greedy. Wass was never\ngreedy, which is why the patrol had never been able to pull him down,\nand those who dealt with him did not talk. If you had a good thing,\nand Wass accepted temporary partnership, he kept his side of the\nbargain rigidly. You did the same--or regretted your stupidity.\n\n\"A claimant to the Kogan estate--that good enough for you?\"\n\nWass showed no surprise. \"And how would such a claimant be profitable\nto us?\"\n\nHume appreciated that \"us\"; he had an in now. \"If you supply the\nclaimant, surely you can claim a reward, in more ways than one.\"\n\n\"True. But one does not produce a claimant out of a Krusha dream. The\ninvestigation for any such claim now would be made by a verity lab and\nno imposture will pass those tests. While a real claimant would not\nneed your help or mine.\"\n\n\"Depends upon the claimant.\"\n\n\"One you discovered on Jumala?\"\n\n\"No.\" Hume shook his head slowly. \"I found something else on\nJumala--an L-B from Largo Drift intact and in good shape. From the\nevidence now in existence it could have landed there with survivors\naboard.\"\n\n\"And the evidence of such survivors living on--that exists also?\"\n\nHume shrugged, his plasta-flesh fingers flexed slightly. \"It has been\nsix planet years, there is a forest where the L-B rests. No, no\nevidence at present.\"\n\n\"The Largo Drift,\" Wass repeated slowly, \"carrying, among others,\nGentlefem Tharlee Kogan Brodie.\"\n\n\"And her son Rynch Brodie, who was at the time of the Largo Drift's\ndisappearance a boy of fourteen.\"\n\n\"You have indeed made a find.\" Wass gave that simple statement enough\nemphasis to assure Hume he had won. His one-in-a-thousand idea had\nbeen absorbed, was now being examined, amplified, broken down into\ndetails he could never have hoped to manage for himself, by the most\ncunning criminal brain in at least five solar systems.\n\n\"Is there any hope of survivors?\" Wass attacked the problem straight\non.\n\n\"No evidence even of there being any passengers when the L-B planeted.\nThose are automatic and released a certain number of seconds after an\naccident alarm. For what it's worth the hatch of this one was open. It\ncould have brought in survivors. But I was on Jumala for three months\nwith a full Guild crew and we found no sign of any castaways.\"\n\n\"So you propose--?\"\n\n\"On the basis of my report Jumala has been put up for a safari choice.\nThe L-B could well be innocently discovered by a client. Every one\nknows the story with the case dragging through the Ten Sector-Terran\nCourts now. Gentlefem Brodie and her son might not have been news ten\nyears ago. Now, with a third of the Kogan-Bors-Wazalitz control going\nto them, any find linked with the Largo Drift would gain full galactic\ncoverage.\"\n\n\"You have a choice of survivor? The Gentlefem?\"\n\nHume shook his head. \"The boy. He was bright, according to the stories\nsince, and he would have the survival manual from the ship to study.\nHe could have grown up in the wilds of an unopened planet. To use a\nwoman is too tricky.\"\n\n\"You are entirely right. But we shall require an extremely clever\nimposter.\"\n\n\"I think not.\" Hume's cool glance met Wass'. \"We only need a youth of\nthe proper general physical description and the use of a conditioner.\"\n\nWass' expression did not change, there was no sign that Hume's hint\nhad struck home. But when he replied there was a slight change in the\nmonotone of his voice.\n\n\"You seem to know a great deal.\"\n\n\"I am a man who listens,\" Hume replied, \"and I do not always discount\nrumor as mere fantasy.\"\n\n\"That is true. As one of the guild you would be interested in the root\nof fact beneath the plant of fiction,\" Wass acknowledged. \"You appear\nto have done some planning on your own.\"\n\n\"I have waited and watched for just such an opportunity as this,\" Hume\nanswered.\n\n\"Ah, yes. The Kogan-Bors-Wazalitz combine incurred your displeasure. I\nsee you are also a man who does not forget easily. And that, too, I\nunderstand. It is a foible of my own, Out-Hunter. I neither forget\nnor forgive my enemies, though I may seem to do so and time separates\nthem from their past deeds for a space.\"\n\nHume accepted that warning--both must keep any bargain. Wass was\nsilent for a moment, as if to leave time for the thought to root\nitself, then he spoke again.\n\n\"A youth with the proper physical qualifications. Have you any such in\nmind?\"\n\n\"I think so.\" Hume was short.\n\n\"He will need certain memories; those take time to tape.\"\n\n\"Those dealing with Jumala, I can supply.\"\n\n\"Yes. You will have to provide a tape beginning with his arrival on\nthat world. For such family material as is necessary I shall have\nready. An interesting project, even apart from its value to us. This\nis one to intrigue experts.\"\n\nExpert psycho-techs--Wass had them. Men who had slipped over the\nborder of the law, had entered Wass' organization and prospered there.\nThere were some techs crooked enough to enjoy such a project for its\nown sake, indulging in forbidden experimentation. For a moment, but\nonly for a moment, something in Hume jibbed at the intent of carrying\nthrough his plan. Then he shrugged that tinge aside.\n\n\"How soon do you wish to move?\"\n\n\"How long will preparation take?\" Hume asked in return, for the second\ntime battling a taste of concern.\n\n\"Three months, maybe four. There's research to be done and tapes to be\nmade.\"\n\n\"It will be six months probably before the Guild sets up a safari for\nJumala.\"\n\nWass smiled. \"That need not worry us. When the time comes for a\nsafari, there shall also be clients, impeccable clients, asking for it\nto be planned.\"\n\nThere would be, too, Hume knew. Wass' influence reached into places\nwhere the Veep himself was totally unknown. Yes, he could count on an\nexcellent, well above suspicion, set of clients to discover Rynch\nBrodie when the time came.\n\n\"I can deliver the boy tonight, or early tomorrow morning. Where?\"\n\n\"You are sure of your selection?\"\n\n\"He fulfills the requirements, the right age, general appearance. A\nboy who will not be missed, who has no kin, no ties, and who will\ndrop out of sight without any questions to be asked.\"\n\n\"Very well. Get him at once. Deliver him here.\"\n\nWass swept one hand across the table surface. On the red of the stone\nthere glowed for seconds an address. Hume noted it, nodded. It was one\nin the center of the port town, one which could be visited at an odd\nhour without exciting any curiosity. He rose.\n\n\"He will be there.\"\n\n\"Tomorrow, at your convenience,\" Wass added, \"you will come to this\nplace.\" Again the palm moved and a second address showed on the table.\n\n\"There you will begin your tape for our use. It may take several\nsessions.\"\n\n\"I'm ready. I still have the long report to make to the Guild, so the\nmaterial is still available on my note tapes.\"\n\n\"Excellent. Out-Hunter Hume, I salute a new colleague.\" At last Wass'\nright hand came up from the table. \"May we both have luck equal to our\nindustry.\"\n\n\"Luck to equal our desires,\" Hume corrected him.\n\n\"A very telling phrase, Out-Hunter. Luck to equal our desires. Yes,\nlet us both deserve that.\"\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nThe Starfall was a long way down scale from the pleasure houses of the\nupper town. Here strange vices were also merchandise, but not such\nexotics as Wass provided. This was strictly for crewmen of the star\nfreighters who could be speedily and expertly separated from a\nvoyage's pay in an evening. The tantalizing scents of Wass' terraces\nwere reduced here to simply smells, the majority of which were not\nfragrant.\n\nThere had already been two fatal duels that evening. A tubeman from a\nrim ship had challenged a space miner to settle a difference with\nthose vicious whips made from the tail casings of Flangoid flying\nlizards, an encounter which left both men in ribbons, one dead, one\ndying. And a scarred, ex-space marine had blaster-flamed one of the\nStar-and-Comet dealers into charred human ash.\n\nThe young man who had been ordered to help clear away the second loser\nretired to the stinking alley outside to lose the meal which was part\nof his meager day's pay. Now he crawled back inside, his face\ngreenish, one hand pressed to his middle section.\n\nHe was thin, the fine bones of his face tight under the pallid skin,\nhis ribs showing even through the sleazy fabric of the threadbare\ntunic with its house seal. When he leaned his head back against the\ngrime encrusted wall, raising his face to the light, his hair had the\nglint of bright chestnut, a gold which was also red. And for his\nswamper's labor he was almost fastidiously clean.\n\n\"You--Lansor!\"\n\nHe shivered as if an icy wind had found him and opened his eyes. They\nseemed disproportionately large in his skin and bone face and were of\nan odd shade, neither green nor blue, but somewhere between.\n\n\"Get going, you! Ain't paying out good credits for you to sit there\nlike you was buying on your own!\" The Salarkian who loomed above him\nspoke accentless, idiomatic Basic Space which came strangely from\nbetween his yellow lips. A furred hand thrust the handle of a mop-up\nstick at the young man, a taloned thumb jerked the direction in which\nto use that evil-smelling object. Vye Lansor levered himself up the\nwall, took the mop, setting his teeth grimly.\n\nSomeone had spilled a mug of Kardo and the deep purple liquid was\nalready patterning the con-stone floor past any hope of cleaning. But\nhe set to work slapping the fringe of the noisome mop back and forth\nto sop up what he could. The smell of the Kardo uniting with the\ngeneral effluvia of the room and its inhabitants heightened his\nqueasiness.\n\nWorking blindly in a half stupor, he was not aware of the man sitting\nalone in the booth until his mop spattered the ankle of one of the\ndrinking girls. She struck him sharply across the face with a\nsputtering curse in the tongue of Altar-Ishtar.\n\nThe blow sent him back against the open lattice of the booth. As he\ntried to steady himself another hand reached up, fingers tightened\nabout his wrist. He flinched, tried to jerk away from that hold, only\nto discover that he was the other's prisoner.\n\nAnd looking down at his captor in apprehension, he was aware even then\nof the different quality of this man. The patron wore the tunic of a\ncrewman, lighter patches where the ship's badges should have been to\nshow that he was not engaged. But, though his tunic was shabby, dirty,\nhis magnetic boots scuffed and badly worn, he was not like the others\nnow enjoying the pleasures of the Starfall.\n\n\"This one--he makes trouble?\" The vast bulk of the Vorm-man who was\nthe Starfall's private law moved through the crowd with serene\nconfidence in his own strength, which no one there, unless blind,\ndeaf, and out-of-the-senses drunk, could dispute. His scaled,\nsix-fingered, claw hand reached out for Lansor and the boy cringed.\n\n\"No trouble!\" There was the click of authority in the voice of the man\nin the booth. His face, moments earlier taut and sharp with\nintelligence, was suddenly slack, his tone slurred as he answered:\n\"Looks like an old shipmate. No trouble, just want a drink with an old\nshipmate.\"\n\nBut the grip which had pulled Vye forward, swung him around and down\non the other bench in the booth, was anything but slack. The Vorm-man\nglanced from the patron of the Starfall to its least important\nemployee and then grinned, thrusting his fanged jaws close to\nLansor's.\n\n\"If the master wants to drink, you dirt-rat, you drink!\"\n\nVye nodded vigorously, and then put his hand to his mouth, afraid his\nstomach was about to betray him again. Apprehensive, he watched the\nVorm-man turn away. Only when that broad, green-gray back was lost in\nthe smoky far reaches of the room did he expel his breath again.\n\n\"Here--\" The grip was gone from his wrist, but fingers now put a mug\ninto his hand. \"Drink!\"\n\nHe tried to protest, knew it was hopeless, and used both hands to get\nthe mug to his lips, mouthing the stinging liquid in dull despair.\nOnly, instead of bringing nausea with it, the stuff settled his\nstomach, cleared his head, with an after glow with which he managed\nto relax from the tense state of endurance which filled his hours in\nthe Starfall.\n\nHalf of the mug's contents inside him and he dared to raise his eyes\nto the man opposite him. Yes, this was no common crewman, nor was he\ndrunk as he had pretended for the Vorm-man. Now he watched the milling\ncrowd with a kind of detachment, though Vye was sure he was aware of\nevery move he himself made.\n\nVye finished the liquid. For the first time since he had come into\nthis place two months earlier he felt like a real person again. And he\nhad wits enough to guess that the potion he had just swallowed\ncontained some drug. Only now he did not care at all. Anything which\ncould wipe out in moments all the shame, fear, and sick despair the\nStarfall had planted in him was worth swallowing. Why the other had\ndrugged him was a mystery, but he was content to wait for\nenlightenment.\n\nLansor's companion once more applied that compelling pressure to the\nyounger man's bony forearm. Linked by that hold they left the\nStarfall, came into the cooler, far more pleasant atmosphere of the\nstreet. They were a block away before Vye's guide halted, though he\ndid not release his prisoner.\n\n\"Forty names of Dugor!\" he spat.\n\nLansor waited, breathing in the air of early morning. The confidence\nof the drug still held. At the moment he was certain nothing could be\nas bad as the life behind him, he was willing to face what this\nstrange patron of the Starfall had in mind.\n\nThe other slapped his hand down on an air-car call button, stood\nwaiting until one of the city flitters landed on beam before them.\n\nFrom the seat of the air-car Vye noted they were heading into the\nrespectability of the upper city, away from the stews ringing the\nlaunch port. He tried to guess their destination or purpose, not that\neither mattered much. Then the car descended on a landing stage.\n\nThe stranger waved Lansor through a doorway, down a short corridor\ninto a room of private quarters. Vye sat down gingerly on the foam\nseat extending from the wall as he neared. He stared about. Dimly he\ncould just remember rooms which had this degree of comfort, but so\ndimly now he could not be sure they did not exist only in his vivid\nimagination. For Vye's imagination had buoyed him first through the\ndrab existence in a State Child's Cr\u00e8che, then through a state-found\njob which he had lost because he could not adapt to the mechanical\nlife of a computer tender, and had been an anchor and an escape when\nhe had sunk through the depths of the port to the last refuge in the\nStarfall.\n\nNow he pressed both his hands into the soft stuff of the seat and\ngaped at a small tri-dee on the wall facing him, a miniature scene of\nlife on some other planet wherein a creature enveloped in short black\nand white striped fur crept belly flat, to stalk long-legged,\nshort-winged birds making blood-red splotches against yellow reed\nbanks under a pale violet sky. He feasted on its color, on the sense\nof freedom and off-world wonders which it raised in him.\n\n\"Who are you?\"\n\nThe stranger's abrupt question brought him back, not only to the room\nbut to his own precarious position. He moistened his lips, no longer\nquite so aglow with confidence.\n\n\"Vye--Vye Lansor.\" Then he added his other identification, \"S. C. C.\n425061.\"\n\n\"State child, eh?\" The other had pushed a button for a refresher cup,\nthen was sipping its contents slowly. He did not ring for a second to\noffer Vye. \"Parents?\"\n\nLansor shook his head. \"I was brought in after the Five-Hour Fever\nepidemic. They didn't try to keep records, there were too many of us.\"\n\nThe man was watching him levelly over the rim of that cup. There was\nsomething cold in that study, something which curbed Vye's pleasant\nfeeling of only moments earlier. Now the other set down his drink,\ncrossed the room. Cupping his hand under Lansor's chin, he brought up\nhis head in a way which stirred a sullen resentment in the younger\nman, yet something told him resistance would only bring trouble.\n\n\"I'd say Terran stock--not more than second generation.\" He was\ntalking to himself more than to Vye. He loosed his hold on the boy's\nchin, but he still stood there surveying him from head to foot. Lansor\nwanted to squirm, but he fought that impulse, and managed to meet the\nother's gaze when it reached his face again.\n\n\"No--not the usual port-drift. I was right all the way.\" Now he\nlooked at Vye again as if the younger man did have a brain, emotions,\nsome call on his interest as a personality. \"Want a job?\"\n\nLansor pressed his hand deeper into the foam seat. \"What--what kind?\"\nHe was angry and ashamed at that small betraying break in his voice.\n\n\"You have scruples?\" The stranger appeared to think that amusing. Vye\nreddened, but he was also more than a little surprised that the man in\nthe worn space uniform had read hesitancy right. Someone out of the\nStarfall should not be too particular about employment, and he could\nnot tell why he was.\n\n\"Nothing illegal, I assure you.\" The man crossed to set his refresher\ncup in the empty slot. \"I am an Out-Hunter.\"\n\nLansor blinked. This had all taken on some of the fantastic aura of a\ndream. The other was eyeing him impatiently, as if he had expected\nsome reaction.\n\n\"You may inspect my credentials if you wish.\"\n\n\"I believe you,\" Vye found his voice.\n\n\"I happen to need a gearman.\"\n\nBut this wasn't happening! Of course, it couldn't happen to him, Vye\nLansor, state child, swamper in the Starfall. Things such as this did\nnot happen, except in a thaline dream, and he wasn't a smoke eater! It\nwas the kind of dream a man didn't want to wake from, not if he was\nport-drift.\n\n\"Would you be willing to sign on?\"\n\nVye tried to clutch reality to himself, to remain level-headed. A\ngearman for an Out-Hunter! Why five men out of six would pay a large\npremium for a chance at such rating. The chill of doubt cut through\nthe first hazy rosiness. A swamper from a port-side dive simply did\nnot become a gearman for a Guild Hunter.\n\nAgain it was as if the stranger read his thoughts. \"Look here,\" he\nspoke abruptly. \"I had a bad time myself, years ago. You resemble\nsomeone to whom I owe a debt. I can't repay him, but I can make the\nscales a little even this way.\"\n\n\"Make the scales even.\" Vye's fading hope brightened. Then the\nOut-Hunter was a follower of the Fata Rite. That would explain\neverything. If you could not repay a good deed to the one you owed,\nyou must balance the Eternal Scales in another fashion. He relaxed\nagain, a great many of his unasked questions so answered.\n\n\"You will accept?\"\n\nVye nodded eagerly. \"Yes, Out-Hunter.\" He still could not believe that\nthis was happening.\n\nThe other pressed the refresher button, and this time he handed Lansor\nthe brimming cup. \"Drink on the bargain.\" His words had the ring of\ncommand.\n\nLansor drank, gulping down the contents of the cup, and suddenly was\naware of being tired. He leaned back against the wall, his eyes\nclosed.\n\nRas Hume took the cup from the lax fingers of the young man. So far,\nvery good. Chance appeared to be playing on his side of the board. It\nhad been chance which had steered him into the Starfall just three\nnights ago when he had been in quest of his imposter. And Vye Lansor\nwas better than he dared hope to find. The boy had the right coloring,\nhe had been batted around enough to fall for the initial story, he was\nmalleable now. And after Wass' techs worked on him he would be Rynch\nBrodie--heir to one-third of Kogan-Bors-Wazalitz!\n\n\"Come!\" He touched Vye on the shoulder. The boy opened his eyes but\nhis gaze did not focus as he got slowly to his feet. Hume glanced at\nhis planet-time watch. It was still very early; the chance he must run\nin getting Lansor out of this building was small if they went at once.\nGuiding the younger man with a light hold above the elbow, he walked\nhim out back to the flitter landing stage. The air-car was waiting.\nHume's sense of being a gambler facing a run of good luck grew as he\nshepherded the boy into the flitter, punched a cover destination and\ntook off.\n\nOn another street he transferred himself and his charge into a second\nair-car, set the destination to within a block of the address Wass had\ngiven him. Not much later he walked Vye into a small lobby with a\ndiscreet list of names posted in its rack. No occupations attached to\nthose colored streamers Hume noted. This meant either that their\nowners represented luxury trades, where a name signified the\nprofession or service, or that they were covers--perhaps both. Wass'\nworld fringed many different circles, intermingled with some quite\nsurprising professions dedicated to the comfort, pleasure or health of\nthe idle rich, off-world nobility, and the criminal elite.\n\nHume fingered the right call button, knowing that the thumb pattern\nhe had left on Wass' conference table would have already been relayed\nas his symbol of admission here. A flicker of light winked below the\nname, the wall to the right shimmered, and produced a doorway.\nSteering Vye to it, Hume nodded to the man waiting there. He was a\nflat-faced Eucorian of the servant caste, and now he reached out to\ndraw Lansor over the threshold.\n\n\"I have him, gentlehomo.\" His voice was as expressionless as his face.\nThere was another shimmer and the door disappeared.\n\nHume brushed his hand down the outer side of his thigh, wiping flesh\nagainst the coarse stuff of the crew uniform. He left the lobby\nfrowning at his own thoughts.\n\nStupid! A swamper from one of the worst rat holes in the port. Like as\nnot that youngster would have had his brains kicked out in a brawl, or\nbeen fried to a crisp when some drunk got wild with a blaster, before\nthe year was out. He'd done him a real kindness, given him a chance at\na future less than one man in a billion ever had the power to even\ndream about. Why, if Vye Lansor had known what was going to happen to\nhim, he would have been so willing to volunteer, that he would have\ndragged Hume here. There was no reason to have any regrets over the\nboy, he had never had it so good--never! There was only one small\nperiod of risk for Vye to face. Those days he would have to spend\nalone on Jumala between the time Wass' organization would plant him\nthere and the coming of Hume's party to \"discover\" him. Hume himself\nwould tape every possible aid to cover that period. All the knowledge\nof a Guild Out-Hunter, added to the information gathered by the\nsurvey, would be used to provide Rynch Brodie with the training\nnecessary for wilderness survival. Hume was already listing the items\nto be included as he strode down the street, his tread once more\nassured.\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nHis head ached dully, of that he was conscious first. As he turned,\nwithout opening his eyes, he felt the brush of softness against his\ncheek, and a pungent odor fill his nostrils.\n\nHe opened his eyes, stared up past a rim of broken rock toward the\ncloudless, blue-green sky. A relay clicked into proper place deep in\nhis mind.\n\nOf course! He had been trying to lure a strong-jaws out of its\ntraphole with hooked bait, then his foot had slipped. Rynch Brodie sat\nup, flexed his bare thin arms, and moved his long legs experimentally.\nNo broken bones, anyway. But still he frowned. Odd--that dream which\njarred with the here and now.\n\nCrawling to the side of the creek, he dipped head and shoulders into\nthe water, letting the chill of the stream flush away some of his\nwaking bewilderment. He shook himself, making the drops fly from his\nuncovered torso and arms, and then discovered his hunting tackle.\n\nHe stood for a moment fingering each piece of his scanty clothing,\nrecalling every piece of labor or battle which had added pouch, belt,\nstrip of fabric to his equipment. Yet--there was still that odd sense\nof strangeness, as if none of this was really his.\n\nRynch shook his head, wiped his wet face with his arm. It was all his,\nthat was sure, every bit of it. He'd been lucky, the survival manual\non the L-B had furnished him with general directions and this was a\nworld which was not unfriendly--not if one was prepared for trouble.\n\nHe climbed up and loosened the net, coiling its folds into one hand,\ntaking the good spear in his other. A bush stirred ahead, against the\npull of the light breeze. Rynch froze, then the haft of his spear slid\ninto a new hand grip, the coils of his net spun out. A snarl cut over\nthe purr of water.\n\nThe scarlet blot which sprang for his throat was met with the flail of\nthe net. Rynch stabbed twice at the creature he had so swept off\nbalance. A water-cat, this year's cub. Dying, its claws, over-long in\nproportion to its paws, drew inch deep furrows in the earth and\ngravel. Its eyes, almost the same shade as its long, burr-entangled\nbody fur, glared up at him in deathly enmity.\n\nAs Rynch watched, that feeling that he was studying something strange,\nutterly alien, came to him once again. Yet he had hunted water-cats\nfor many seasons. Fortunately they were solitary, evil-tempered beasts\nthat marked out a roaming territory to defend it from others of their\nkind, and not too many were to be encountered in cross-country travel.\n\nHe stooped to pull his net from the now still paws. Some definite\nplace he must reach. The compulsion to move on in that sudden flash\nshook him, raised the dull ache still troubling his temples into a\npunishing throb. Going down on his knees, Rynch once more turned to\nthe stream water; this time after splashing it onto his face, he drank\nfrom his cupped hands.\n\nRynch swayed, his wet hands over his eyes, digging fingertips into the\nskin of his forehead to ease that pain bursting in his skull. Sitting\nin a room, drinking from a cup--it was as if a shadow picture fitted\nover the reality of the stream, rocks and brush about him. He had sat\nin a room, had drank from a cup--that action had been important!\n\nA sharp, hot pain made him lose contact with that shadow. He looked\ndown. From the gravel, from under rocks, gathered an army of\nblue-black, hard-shelled things, their clawed forelimbs extended, blue\nsense organs raised on fleshy stalks well above their heads, all\nturned towards the dead feline.\n\nRynch slapped out vigorously, stumbled into the water loosening the\nhold of two vicious scavengers on the torn skin of his ankle when he\nwaded out knee-deep. Already that black tongue of small bodies licked\nacross the red-haired side of the hunter. Within minutes the corpse\nwould be only well-cleaned bones.\n\nRetrieving his spear and net, Rynch immersed both in the water to\nclean off attackers, and hurried on, splashing through the creek until\nhe was well away from the vicinity of the kill. A little later he\nflushed a four-footed creature from between two rocks and killed it\nwith one blow from his spear haft. He skinned his kill, feeling the\nsubstance of the skill. Was it exceedingly rough hide, or rudimentary\nscales? And knew a return of that puzzlement.\n\nHe felt, he thought painfully as he toasted the dry looking, grayish\nmeat on a sharpened stick, as if a part of him knew very well what\nmanner of animal he had killed. And yet, far inside him, another\nperson he could not understand stood aloof watching in amazement.\n\nHe was Rynch Brodie, and he had been traveling on the Largo Drift with\nhis mother.\n\nMemory presented him automatically with a picture of a thin woman with\na narrow, rather unhappy face, a twist of elaborately dressed hair in\nwhich jeweled lights sparkled. There had been something bad--memory\nwas no longer exact but chaotic. And his head ached as he tried to\nrecall that time with greater clarity. Afterwards the L-B and a man\nwith him in it--\n\n\"Simmons Tait!\"\n\nAn officer, badly hurt. He had died when the L-B landed here. Rynch\nhad a clear memory of himself piling rocks over Tait's twisted body.\nHe had been alone then with only the survival manual and some of the\nL-B supplies. The important thing was that he must never forget he was\nRynch Brodie.\n\nHe licked grease from his fingers. The ache in his head made him\ndrowsy. He curled up on a patch of sun-warmed sand and slept.\n\nOr did he? His eyes were open again. Now the sky above him was no\nlonger a bowl of light, but rather a muted halo of evening. Rynch sat\nup, his heart pounding as if he had been racing to outdistance the\nrising wind now pushing against his half-naked body.\n\nWhat was he doing here? Where _was_ here?\n\nPanic, carried through from that awakening, dried his mouth, roughened\nhis skin, made wet the palms of the hands he dug into the sand on\neither side of him. Vaguely, a picture projected into his mind--he had\nsat in a room, and watched a man come to him with a cup. Before that,\nhe had been in a place of garish light and evil smells.\n\nBut he was Rynch Brodie, he had come here on an L-B when he was a boy,\nhe had buried the ship's officer under a pile of rocks, managed to\nsurvive by himself because he had applied the aids in the boat to\nlearn how. This morning he had been hunting a strong-jaw, tempting it\nout of its hiding by a hook and line and a bait of fresh killed\nskipper.\n\nRynch's hands went to his face, he crouched forward on his knees. That\nall was true, he could prove it--he would prove it! There was the\nstrong-jaw's den back there, somewhere on the rise where he had left\nthe snapped haft of the spear he had broken in his fall. If he could\nfind the den, then he would be sure of the reality of everything else.\n\nHe had only had a very real dream--that was it! Only, why did he\ncontinue to dream of that room, that man, and the cup? Of the place of\nlights and smells, which he hated so much that the hate was a sour\ntaste in his fright-dried mouth? None of it had ever been a part of\nRynch Brodie's world.\n\nThrough the dusk he started back up the stream bed, towards the narrow\nlittle valley where he had wakened after that fall. Finally, finding\nshelter within the heart of a bush, he crouched low, listening to the\nnoises of another world which awoke at night to take over the stage\nfrom the day dwellers.\n\nAs he plodded back, he fought off panic, realizing that some of those\nnoises he could identify with confidence, while others remained\nmysteries. He bit down hard on the knuckles of his clenched fist,\nattempting to bend that discovery into evidence. Why did he know at\nonce that that thin, eerie wailing was the flock call of a\nleather-winged, feathered tree dweller, and that a coughing grunt from\ndownstream was just a noise?\n\n\"Rynch Brodie--Largo Drift--Tait.\" He tasted the blood his teeth drew\nfrom his own skin as he recited that formula. Then he scrambled up.\nHis feet tangled in the net, and he went down again, his head cracking\non a protruding root.\n\nNothing tangible reached him in that brush shelter. What did venture\nout of hiding to investigate was a substance none of his species could\nhave named. It was neither body, nor mind--perhaps it was closest to\nalien emotion.\n\nMaking contact stealthily, but with confidence, it explored after its\nown fashion. Then, puzzled, it withdrew to report. And since that to\nwhich it reported was governed by a set pattern which had not been\naltered for eons, its only answer was a basic command reaffirmed.\nAgain it made contact, strove to carry out that order fruitlessly.\nWhere it should have found easy passage, a clear channel to carry\ninfluence to the sleeper's brain, it found a jumble of impressions,\ninterwoven until they made a protective barrier.\n\nThe invader strove to find some pattern, or meaning--withdrew baffled.\nBut its invasion, as ghostly as that had been, loosened a knot here,\ncleared a passage there.\n\nRynch awoke at dawn, slowly, dazedly, sorting out sounds, smells,\nthoughts. There was a room, a man, trouble and fear, then there was\nhe, Rynch Brodie, who had lived in this wilderness on an unmapped\nfrontier world for the passage of many seasons. That world was about\nhim now, he could feel its winds, hear its sounds, taste, smell. It\nwas not a dream--the other was the dream. It had to be!\n\nProve it. Find the L-B, retrace the trail of yesterday past the point\nof the fall which had started all this. Right there was the slope down\nwhich he must have tumbled. Above, he would find the den he had been\nexploring when the accident had occurred.\n\nOnly--he did not find it. His mind had produced a detailed picture of\nthat rounded depression, at the bottom of which the strong-jaw lurked.\nBut when he reached the crown of the bluff, nowhere did he sight the\nmounded earth of the pit's rim. He searched carefully for a good\nlength, both north and south. No den--no trace of one. Yet his memory\ntold him that there had been one here yesterday.\n\nHad he fallen elsewhere and stumbled on, dazed, to fall a second time?\n\nSome disputant inside him said no to that. This was where he had\nregained consciousness yesterday and there was no den!\n\nHe faced away from the river, breathing fast. No den--was there also\nno L-B? If he had passed this way dazed from a former fall, surely he\nwould have left some trace.\n\nThere was a crushed, browned plant flattened by weight. He stooped to\nfinger the wilted leaves. Something had come in this direction. He\nwould back-track. Rynch gave a hunter's attention to the ground.\n\nA half-hour later he found nothing but some odd, almost obliterated\nmarks on grass too resilient to hold traces very long. And from them\nhe could make nothing.\n\nHe knew where he was, even if he did not know how he got here. The\nL-B--if it did exist--was to the west. He had a vivid mental picture\nof the rocket shape, its once silvery sides dulled by exposure, canted\ncrookedly amid trees. And he was going to find it!\n\nBeyond the edge of any conscious sense there was a new stir. He was\ncontacted again, tested. A forest called delicately in its alien way.\nRynch had a fleeting thought of trees, was not aware of more than a\nmild desire to see what lay in their shade.\n\nFor the present his own problem held him. That which beckoned was\ndefeated, repulsed by his indifference. While Rynch started at a\nsteady distance to trot towards the east, far away a process akin to a\nrelay clicked into a second set of impulse orders.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWell above the planet Hume spun a dial to bring in the image of the\nwide stretches of continents, the small patches of seas. They would\nset down on the western land mass. Its climate, geographical features\nand surface provided the best site. And he had the very important\nco-ordinates for their camp already taped in the directo.\n\n\"That's Jumala.\"\n\nHe did not glance around to see what effect that screen view had on\nthe other four men in the control cabin of the safari ship. Just now\nhe was striving to master his impatience. The slightest hint could\ngive birth to a suspicion which would blast their whole scheme. Wass\nmight have had a hand in the selection of the three clients, but they\nwould certainly be far from briefed on the truth of any discovery made\non Jumala--they had to be for the safety of the whole enterprise.\n\nThe fourth man, serving as his gearman for this trip, was Wass' own\ninsurance against any wrong move on Hume's part. And the Out-Hunter\nrespected him as being man enough to be wary of giving any suspicion\nof going counter to the agreed plan.\n\nDawn was touching up the main points of the western continent, and he\nmust set this spacer down within a day's journey of the abandoned L-B.\nExploration in that direction would be the first logical move for his\nparty. They could not be openly steered to the find, but there were\nways of directing a hunt which would do as well.\n\nTwo days ago, according to schedule, their castaway had been deposited\nhere with a sub-conscious command to remain in the general area. There\nhad been a slight element of risk in leaving him alone, armed only\nwith the crude weapons he could manipulate, but that was part of the\ngamble.\n\nThey were down--right on the mark. Hume saw to the unpacking and\nactivating of those machines and appliances which would protect and\nserve his civ clients. He slapped the last inflate valve on a bubble\ntent, watched it critically as it billowed from a small roll of fabric\ninto a weather resistant, one-room, air-conditioned and heated\nshelter.\n\n\"Ready and waiting for you to move in, Gentlehomo,\" he reported to the\nsmall man who stood gazing about him with a child's wondering interest\nin the new and strange.\n\n\"Very ingenious, Hunter. Ah--now just what might that be?\" His voice\nwas also eager as he pointed a finger to the east.\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nHume glanced up alertly. There was a bare chance that \"Brodie\" might\nhave witnessed their arrival and might be coming in now to save them\nall a great amount of time and trouble by acting the overjoyed,\nrescued castaway.\n\nBut he could sight nothing at all in that direction to excite any\nattention. The distant mountains provided a stark, dark blue\nbackground. Up their foothills and lower slopes was a thick furring\nof trees with foliage of so deep a green as to register black from\nthis distance. And on the level country was the lighter blue-green of\nthe other variety of wood edging the open country about the river. In\nthere rested the L-B.\n\n\"I don't see anything!\" he snapped, so sharply the little man stared\nat him in open surprise. Hume forced a quick smile.\n\n\"Just what did you sight, Gentlehomo Starns? There is no large game in\nthe woodlands.\"\n\n\"This was not an animal, Hunter. Rather a flash of light, just about\nthere.\" Again he pointed.\n\nSun, Hume thought, could have been reflected from some portion of the\nL-B. He had believed that small spacer so covered with vines and\nringed in by trees that it could not have been so sighted. But a storm\nmight have disposed of some of nature's cloaking. If so Starns'\ninterest must be fed, he would make an ideal discoverer.\n\n\"Odd.\" Hume produced his distance glasses. \"Just where, Gentlehomo?\"\n\n\"There.\" Starns obligingly pointed a third time.\n\nIf there had been anything to see it was gone now. But it did lie in\nthe right direction. For a second or two Hume was uneasy. Things\nseemed to be working too well; his cynical distrust was triggered by\nfitting so smoothly.\n\n\"Might be the sun,\" he observed.\n\n\"Reflected from some object you mean, Hunter? But the flash was very\nbright. And there could be no mirror surface in there, surely there\ncould not be?\"\n\nYes, things were moving too fast. Hume might be overly cautious but he\nwas determined that no hint of any pre-knowledge of the L-B must ever\ncome to these civs. When they would find the Largo Drift's life boat\nand locate Brodie, there would be a legal snarl. The castaway's\nidentity would be challenged by a half dozen distant and unloving\nrelatives, and there would be an intense inquiry. These civs must be\nthe impartial witnesses.\n\n\"No, I hardly believe in a mirror in an uninhabited forest,\nGentlehomo,\" he chuckled. \"But we are on a hunting planet and not all\nits life forms have yet been classified.\"\n\n\"You are thinking of an intelligent native race, Hunter?\" Chambriss,\nthe most demanding of the civ party, strode up to join them.\n\nHume shook his head. \"No native intelligence on a hunting world,\nGentlehomo. That is assured before the planet is listed for a safari.\nHowever, a bird or flying thing, perhaps with metallic plumage or\nscales to catch the sunlight, might under the right circumstances seem\na flash of light. That has happened before.\"\n\n\"It was _very_ bright,\" Starns said doubtfully. \"We might look over\nthere later.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" Chambriss spoke briskly as one used to overriding the\nconflicting wishes in any company. \"I came here for a water-cat, and a\nwater-cat I'm going to have. You don't find those in wooded areas.\"\n\n\"There will be a schedule,\" Hume announced. \"Each of you has signed\nup, according to contract, for a different trophy. You for a\nwater-cat, Gentlehomo. And you, Gentlehomo Starns, want to make\ntri-dees of the pit-dragons. While Gentlehomo Yactisi wishes to try\nelecto fishing in the deep holes. To alternate days is the fair way.\nAnd, who knows, each of you may discover your own choice near the\nother man's stake out.\"\n\n\"You are quite right, Hunter,\" Starns nodded. \"And since my two\ncolleagues have chosen to try for a water creature, perhaps we should\nstart along the river.\"\n\nIt was two days, then, before they could work their way into the\nwoods. One part of Hume protested, the more cautious section of his\nmind was appeased. He saw, beyond the three clients now turning over\nand sorting space bags, Wass' man glanced at the woods and then back\nto Starns. And, being acutely aware of all undercurrents here, Hume\nwondered what the small civ had actually seen.\n\nThe camp was complete, a cluster of seven bubble tents not too far\nfrom the ship. At least this crowd did not appear to consider that the\nHunter was there to do all the serious moving and storing of supplies.\nAll three of the clients pitched in to help, and Wass' man went down\nto the river to return with half a dozen silver-fins cleaned and\nthreaded on a reed, ready to broil over the cook unit.\n\nA fire in the night was not needed except to afford the proper stage\nsetting. But it was enjoyed. Hume leaned forward to feed the flames,\nand Starns pushed some lengths of driftwood closer.\n\n\"You have said, Hunter, that hunting worlds never contain intelligent\nnative life. Unless the planet is minutely explored how can your\nsurvey teams be sure of that fact?\" His voice bordered on the\npedantic, but his interest was plain.\n\n\"By using the verifier.\" Hume sat crosslegged, his plasta-hand resting\non one knee. \"Fifty years ago, we would have had to keep rather a\nlengthy watch to be sure of a free world. Now, we plant verifiers at\nsuitable test points. Intelligence means mental activity of some\nsort--any of which would be recorded on the verifier.\"\n\n\"Amazing!\" Starns extended his plump hands to the flames in the\nimmemorial gesture of a human attracted not only to the warmth of the\nburning wood, but to its promise of security against the forces of the\ndark. \"No matter how few, or how scattered your native thinkers may\nbe, you record them without missing any?\"\n\nHume shrugged. \"Maybe one or two,\" he grinned, \"might get through such\na screening. But we have yet to discover a planet with such a sparse\nnative life as that at the level of intelligence.\"\n\nYactisi juggled a cup in and out of the firelight. \"I agree, this is\nmost interesting.\" He was a thin man, with scanty drab gray hair and\ndark skin, perhaps the result of the mingling of several human races.\nHis eyes were slightly sunken, so that it was difficult in this light\nto read their expression. He was, Hume had already decided, a class\none brain and observant to a degree, which could either be a help or a\nmenace. \"There have been no cases of failure?\"\n\n\"None reported,\" Hume returned. All his life he had relied on machines\noperating, of course, under the competent domination of men trained to\nuse them properly. He understood the process of the verifier, had seen\nit at work. At the Guild Headquarters there were no records of its\nfailure; he was willing to believe it was infallible.\n\n\"A race residing in the sea now--could you be sure your machine would\ndiscover its presence?\" Starns continued to question.\n\nHume laughed. \"Not to be found on Jumala, you may be sure of that--the\nseas here are small and shallow. Such, not to be picked up by the\nverifier, would have to exist at great depths and never venture on\nland. So we need not fear any surprises here. The Guild takes no\nchances.\"\n\n\"As it always continues to assure one,\" Yactisi replied. \"The hour\ngrows late. I wish you rewarding dreams.\" He arose to go to his own\nbubble tent.\n\n\"Yes, indeed!\" Starns blinked at the fire and then scrambled up in\nturn. \"We hunt along the river, then, tomorrow?\"\n\n\"For water-cat,\" Hume agreed. Of the three, he believed Chambriss the\nmost impatient. Might as well let him pot his trophy as soon as\npossible. The ex-pilot deduced there would be little cooperation in\nexploration from that client until he was satisfied in his own quest.\n\nRovald, Wass' man, lingered by the fire until the three civs were safe\nin their bubbles.\n\n\"River range tomorrow?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes. We can't rush the deal.\"\n\n\"Agreed.\" Rovald spoke with a curtness he did not use when the civs\nwere present. \"Only don't delay too long. Remember, our boy's roaming\naround out there. He might just be picked off by something before\nthese stumble-footed civs catch up with him.\"\n\n\"That's the chance we knew we'd have to take. We don't dare raise any\nsuspicion. Yactisi, for one, is no fool, neither is Starns. Chambriss\njust wants to get his water-cat, but he could become nasty if anyone\ntried to steer him.\"\n\n\"Too long a wait might run us into trouble. Wass doesn't like\ntrouble.\"\n\nHume spun around. In the half light of the fire his features were set,\nhis mouth grim. \"Neither do I, Rovald, neither do I!\" he said softly,\nbut with an icy promise beneath the words.\n\nRovald was not to be intimidated. He grinned. \"Set your fins down,\nfly-boy. You need Wass--and I'm here to hold his stakes for him. This\nis a big deal, we won't want any misses!\"\n\n\"There won't be any--not from my side.\" Hume stepped away from the\nfire, approached a post which gleamed with a dull, red line of fire\ndown either side. He pressed a control button. That red line flared\ninto a streak of brilliance. Now encircling the bubble tents and the\nspace ship was a force field: routine protection of a safari camp on a\nstrange world and one Hume had set as a matter of course.\n\nHe stood for a long moment staring through that invisible barrier\ntoward the direction of the wood. It was a dark night, there were\nscudding clouds to hide the stars, which meant rain probably before\nmorning. This was no time to be plagued by uncertain weather.\n\nSomewhere out there Brodie was holed up. He hoped the boy had long ago\nreached the \"camp\" so carefully erected and left for his occupancy.\nThe L-B, that stone covered \"grave\" showing signs of several years'\noccupancy, was all assembled and constructed to the last small detail.\nFar less might have deceived the civs in this safari. But as soon as\nthe story of their find leaked, there would be others on the scene,\nmen trained to assess the signs of a castaway's fight for survival.\nHis own Guild training and the ability of Wass' renegade techs should\nbring them through that test.\n\nWhat had Starns seen? The glint of sun on the tail of the L-B, tilted\nnow to the sky? Hume walked slowly back to the fire, when he saw\nRovald going up the ramp into the spacer. He smiled. Did Wass think he\nwas stupid enough not to guess that the Veep's man would be in com\ntouch with his employer? Rovald was about to report along some channel\nof the shadow world that they had landed and that the play was about\nto begin. Hume wondered idly how far and through how many relays that\nmessage would pass before it reached its destination.\n\nHe stretched and yawned, moving to his sleeping pad. Tomorrow they\nmust find Chambriss a water-cat. Hume shoved Brodie into the back of\nhis mind to center his thoughts on the various ways of delivering, to\nthe waiting sportsman, a fair-sized alien feline.\n\nThe lights in the bubbles went out one by one. Within the circle\nbarrier of the force field men slept. And by midnight the rain began\nto fall, streaming down the sides of the bubbles, soaking the ashes of\nthe fire.\n\nOut of the dark crept that which was not thought, not substance, but\nalien to the off-world men. But the barrier, meant to deter\nmulti-footed creatures, with wings or no visible limbs at all, proved\nto be a better protection than its creators had hoped. There was no\npenetration--only a baffled butting of one force against another. And\nthen the probe withdrew as undetected as it had come.\n\nOnly, the thing which had no intelligence, as humankind rated\nintelligence, did possess the ability to fathom the nature of that\nartificial barrier. The force field was examined, its nature digested.\nFirst approach had failed. The second was now ready--ready as it had\nnot been months before when the first coming of these creatures had\nalerted the very ancient watchdog on Jumala.\n\nDeep in the darker woods on the mountain sides there was a stirring.\nThings whimpered in their sleep, protested subconsciously commands\nthey could never understand, only obey. With the coming of dawn there\nwould be a marshaling of hosts, a new assault--not on the camp, but on\nany leaving its protection. And also on the boy now sleeping in a\nshallow cave formed by the swept roots of a tree--a tree which had\ncrashed when the L-B landed.\n\nAgain, fortune favored Hume. With the dawn the rain was over. There\nwas a cloudy sky overhead, but he believed the day would clear. The\nroily, rushing water of the river would aid Chambriss' quest.\nWater-cats holed up in the banks, but rising water often forced them\nout of such dens. A course parallel to the stream bed could well show\nthem the tracks of one of the felines.\n\nThey started off in a group, Hume leading, with Chambriss treading\nbriskly behind him, Rovald bringing up the rear in the approved trail\ntechnique. Chambriss carried a needler, Starns was unarmed except for\na small protection stunner, his tri-dee box slung on his chest by\nwell-worn carrying straps. Yactisi shouldered an electric pole, wore\nits control belt buckled about his middle, though Hume had warned him\nthat the storm would prevent any deep hole fishing.\n\nOnly a short distance from the campsite they came upon the\nunmistakable marks of a water-cat's broad paws, pressed in so heavy\nand distinct a pattern that Hume knew the animal could not be far\nahead. The indentations were deep, and he measured the distance\nbetween them with the length of his hand.\n\n\"Big one!\" Chambriss exclaimed in satisfaction. \"Going away from the\nriver, too.\"\n\nThat point puzzled Hume slightly. The red coated felines might be\nwashed out of their burrows, but they did not willingly head so\nsharply away from the water. He squatted on his heels and surveyed the\nstretch of countryside between them and the distant wood with care.\n\nThe grass was this season's, still growing, not tall enough to afford\ncover for an animal with paws as large as these prints. There were two\nclumps of brush. It could have holed up in either, waiting to attack\nany trailer--but why? It had not been wounded, nor frightened by their\nparty, there was no reason for it to set an ambush on its back trail.\n\nStarns and Yactisi dropped back, though Starns was fussing with his\ntri-dee. Rovald caught up. He had drawn his ray tube in answer to\nHume's hand wave. Any action foreign to the regular habits of an\nanimal was to be mistrusted.\n\nGetting to his feet Hume paced along the line of marks. They were\nfresh--hot fresh. And they still led in a straight line for the woods.\nWith another wave of his hand he stopped Chambriss. The civ was\ntrained in spite of his eagerness and obeyed. Hume left the tracks,\nmade a detour which brought him to a point from which he could study\nthose clumps of brush. No sign except that line of prints pointed to\nthe woods. And if the party kept on, they might well come upon the\nL-B!\n\nHe decided to risk it. But when they were less than a couple of yards\nfrom the tree fringe his hand shot up to direct Chambriss to fire\ntowards the quivering bush.\n\nOnly, that formless half seen thing, hardly to be distinguished in\ncolor from the vegetation, was no water-cat. There was a thin, ragged\ncry. Then the creature plunged backward, was gone.\n\n\"What in the name of nine Gods was that?\" Chambriss demanded.\n\n\"I don't know.\" Hume went forward, jerked the needler dart from a tree\ntrunk. \"But don't shoot again--not unless you are sure of what you are\naiming at!\"\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nMoisture from the night's rain hung on the tree leaves, clung in\nglobules to Rynch's sweating body. He lay on a wide branch trying to\ncontrol the heavy panting which supplied his laboring lungs. And he\ncould still hear the echoes of the startled cries which had come from\nthe men who had threaded through the woods to the up-pointed tail fins\nof the L-B.\n\nNow he tried to reason why he had run. They were his own kind, they\nwould take him out of the loneliness of a world heretofore empty of\nhis species. But that tall man--the one who had led the party into the\nirregular clearing about the life boat--\n\nRynch shivered, dug his nails into the wood on which he lay. At the\nsight of that man, dream and reality had crashed together, sending him\ninto panic-stricken flight. That was the man from the room--the man\nwith the cup!\n\nAs his heart quieted he began to think more coherently. First, he had\nnot been able to find the strong-jaws's den. Then the marks on the\nground at the point from which he had fallen and the L-B were here,\njust as he remembered. But not far from the small ship he had\ndiscovered something more--a campsite with a shelter fashioned out of\nspalls and vines, containing possessions a castaway might have\naccumulated.\n\nThat man would come, Rynch was sure of that, but he was too spent to\nstruggle on.\n\nNo, the answer to every part of the puzzle lay with that man. To go\nback to the ship clearing was to risk capture--but he had to know.\nRynch looked with more attention at his present surroundings. Deep\nmold under the trees here would hold tracks. There might just be\nanother way to move. He eyed the spread of limbs on a neighbor tree.\n\nHis journey through those heights was awkward and he sweated and\ncringed when he disturbed vocal treetop dwellers. He was also to\ndiscover that close to the site of the L-B crash others waited.\n\nHe huddled against the bole of a tree when he made out the curve of a\nround bulk holding tight to the tree trunk aloft. Though it was balled\nin upon itself he was sure the creature was fully as large as he, and\nthe menacing claws suggested it was a formidable opponent.\n\nWhen it made no move to follow him Rynch began to hope it had only\nbeen defending its own hiding place, for its present attitude\nsuggested concealment.\n\nStill facing that featureless blob in the tree, the man retreated,\nalert for the first sign of advance on the part of the creature above.\nNone came, and he dared to slip around the bole of the tree under\nwhich he stood, listening intently for any corresponding movement\noverhead. Now he was facing that survivor's camp.\n\nAnother object crouched in the dark of the lean-to shelter, just as\nits fellow was on sentry duty in the tree! Only this one did not have\nthe self-color of the foliage to disguise it. Four-limbed, its long\nforearms curved about its bent knees, its general outline almost that\nof a human--if a human went clothed in a thick fuzz. The head hunched\nright against the shoulders as if the neck were very short, or totally\nlacking, was pear-shaped, with the longer end to the back, and the\nsense organs of eyes and nose squeezed together on the lower quarter\nof the rounded portion, with a line of wide mouth to split the blunt\nround of the muzzle. Dark pits for eyes showed no pupil, iris, or\ncornea. The nose was a black, perfectly rounded tube jutting an inch\nor so beyond the cheek surface. Grotesque, alien and terrifying, it\nmade no hostile move. And, since it had not turned its head, he could\nnot be sure it had even sighted him. But it knew he was there, he was\ncertain of that. And was waiting--for what? As the long seconds\ncrawled by Rynch began to believe that it was not waiting for him.\nHeartened, he pulled at the vine loop, climbed back into the tree.\n\nMinutes later he discovered that there were more than two of the\nbeasts waiting quietly about the camp, and that their sentry line ran\nbetween him and the clearing of the L-B. He withdrew farther into the\nwood, intent upon finding a detour which would bring him out into the\nopen lands. Now he wanted to join forces with his own kind, whether\nthose men were potential enemies or not.\n\nAs time passed the beasts closed about the clearing of the camp.\nAfternoon was fading into evening when he reached a point several\nmiles downstream near the river. Since he had come into the open he\nhad not sighted any of the watchers. He hoped they did not willingly\nventure out of the trees where the leaves were their protection.\n\nRynch went flat on the stream bank, made a worm's progress up the\nslope to crouch behind a bush and survey the land immediately ahead.\nThere stood an off-world spacer, fins down, nose skyward, and grouped\nnot too far from its landing ramp, a collection of bubble tents. A\nfire burned in their midst and men were moving about it.\n\nNow that he was free from the wood and its watchers and had come so\nnear to his goal, Rynch was curiously reluctant to do the sensible\nthing, to rise out of concealment and walk up to that fire, to claim\nrescue by his own kind.\n\nThe man he sought stood by the fire, shrugging his arms into a webbing\nharness which brought a box against his chest. Having made that fast\nhe picked up a needler by its sling. By their gestures the others were\narguing with him, but he shook his head, came on, to be a shadow\nstalking among other shadows. One of the men trailed him, but as they\nreached a post planted a little beyond the bubble tents he stopped,\nallowed the explorer to advance alone into the dark.\n\nRynch went to cover under a bush. The man was heading to the stream\nbed. Had they somehow learned of his own presence nearby, were they\nout to find him? But the preparations the tall man had made seemed\nmore suited to going on patrol. The watchers! Was the other out to spy\non them? That idea made sense. And in the meantime he would let the\nother past him, follow along behind until he was far enough from the\ncamp so that his friends could not interfere--then, they would have a\nmeeting!\n\nRynch's fingers balled into fists. He would find out what was real,\nwhat was a dream in this crazy, mixed up mind of his! That other would\nknow, and would tell him the truth!\n\nAlert as he was, he lost sight of the stranger who melted into the\ndusky cover of the shadows. Then came a quiet ripple of water close to\nhis own hiding place. The man from the spacer camp was using the\nstream as his road.\n\nIn spite of his caution Rynch was close to betrayal as he edged around\na clump of vegetation growing half in, half out of the stream. Only a\ntimely rustle told him that the other had sat down on a drift log.\n\nWaiting for him? Rynch froze, so startled that he could not think\nclearly for a second. Then he noted that the outline of the other's\nbody was visible, growing brighter by the moment.\n\nMinute particles of pale-greenish radiance were gathering about the\nother. The dark shadow of an arm flapped, the radiance swirled, broke\nagain into pinpoint sparks.\n\nRynch glanced down at his own body--the same sparks were drifting in\nabout him, edging his arms, thighs, chest. He pushed back into the\nbushes while the sparks still flitted, but they no longer gathered in\nstrength enough to light his presence. Now he could see they drifted\nabout the vegetation, about the log where the man sat, about rocks and\nreeds. Only they were thicker about the stranger as if his body were a\nmagnet. He continued to keep them whirling by means of waving hand and\narm, but there was enough light to show Rynch the fingers of his other\nhand, busy on the front panel of the box he wore.\n\nThat fingering stopped, then Rynch's head came up as he heard a very\nfaint sound. Not a beast's cry--or was it?\n\nAgain those fingers moved on the panel. Was the other sending a\nmessage by that means? Rynch watched him check the webbing, count the\nequipment at his belt, settle the needler in the crook of his arm.\nThen the stranger left the stream, headed towards the woods.\n\nRynch jumped to his feet, a cry of warning shaping, but not to be\nuttered. He padded after the other. There was plenty of time to stop\nthe man before he reached the danger which might lurk under the trees.\n\nHowever the other was as wary of that dark as if he suspected what\nmight lie in wait there. He angled along northward, avoiding clumps of\nscattered brush, keeping in the open where Rynch dared not tail him\ntoo closely.\n\nTheir course, parallel to the woods, brought them at last to a second\nstream, the size of a river, into which the first creek emptied. Here\nthe other settled down between two rocks with every indication of\nremaining there for a period.\n\nThankfully Rynch found his own lurking place from which he could keep\nthe other in sight. The light points gathered, hung in a small\nluminous cloud over the rocks. But Rynch had prudently withdrawn under\na bush, and the scent of its aromatic leaves must have discouraged the\nsparks, for no such crown came to his sentry post.\n\nDrugged with fatigue, the younger man slept, awaking to full day, a\nfog of bewilderment and disorientation. To open his eyes to this\nblue-green pocket instead of to four dirty walls, was wrong.\n\nRemembering, he started up and slunk down the slope, angry at his\nfailure. He found the other's track, not turning back as he had half\nfeared, cleanly printed on level spots of wet earth--eastward now.\nWhat was the purpose of the other's expedition? Was he going to use\nthe open cut through which the river ran as a way of penetrating the\nwooded country?\n\nNow Rynch considered the problem from his own angle. The man from the\nspacer had made no effort to conceal his trail, in fact it would\nalmost seem that he had deliberately gone out of his way to leave boot\nprints on favorable stretches of ground. Did he guess that Rynch\nlurked behind, was now leading him on for some purpose of his own? Or\nwere those traces left to guide another party from the camp?\n\nTo advance openly up the stream bed was to invite discovery. Rynch\nsurveyed the nearer bank. Clumps of small trees and high growing\nbushes dotted that expanse, an ideal cover.\n\nHe was hardly out of sight of the bush which had sheltered him when he\nheard the coughing roar of a water-cat. And the feline was attacking\nan enemy, enraged to the pitch of vocal frenzy. Rynch ran a zigzag\ncourse from one clump of bush to the next. That sound of snarling,\nspitting hate ended in mid-cry as Rynch crawled to the river bank.\n\nThe man from the spacer camp had been the focus of a three-prong\nattack from a female and her cubs. Three red bodies were flat and\nstill on the gravel as the off-worlder leaned back against a rock\nbreathing heavily. As Rynch sighted him, he stooped to recover the\nneedler he had dropped, lurched away from the rock towards the water,\nand so blundered straight into another Jumalan trap.\n\nHis unsteady foot advancing for another step came down on a slippery\nsurface, and he fell forward as his legs were engulfed in the trap\nburrow of a strong-jaws. With a startled cry the man dropped the\nneedler again, clawed at the ground about him. Already he was buried\nto his knees, then his mid-thighs, in the artificial quicksand. But he\nhad not lost his head and was jerking from side to side in an effort\nto pull free.\n\nRynch got to his feet, walked with slow deliberation down to the\nriver's brink. The trapped prisoner had shied halfway around,\nstretching out his arms to find a firmer grip on some rock large and\nheavy enough to anchor him. After his first startled cry he had made\nno sound, but now, as he sighted Rynch, his eyes widened and his lips\nparted.\n\nThe box on his chest caught on a stone he had dragged to him in a\ndesperate try for support. There was a spitting of sparks and the\nstranger worked frantically at the buckle of the webbing harness to\nloosen it and toss the whole thing from him. The box struck one of the\ndead water-cats, flashed as fur and flesh were singed.\n\nRynch watched dispassionately before he caught the needler, jerking it\naway from the prisoner. The man eyed him steadily, and his expression\ndid not alter even when Rynch swung the off-world weapon to center its\nsights on the late owner.\n\n\"Suppose,\" Rynch's voice was rusty sounding in his own ears, \"we talk\nnow.\"\n\nThe man nodded. \"As you wish, Brodie.\"\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n\"Brodie?\" Rynch squatted on his heels.\n\nThose gray eyes, so light in the other's deeply tanned face, narrowed\nthe smallest fraction, Rynch noted with an inner surge of triumph.\n\n\"Were you looking for me?\" he added.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"We found an L-B--we wondered if there were survivors.\"\n\nSlowly Rynch shook his head. \"No--you knew I was here. Because you\nbrought me!\" He fashioned his suspicions into one quick thrust.\n\nThis time there was not the slightest hint of self-betrayal from the\nother.\n\n\"You see,\" Rynch leaned forward, but still well out of reach from the\ncaptive, \"I remember!\"\n\nNow there was a faint flicker of answer in the man's eyes. He asked\nquietly:\n\n\"What do you remember, Brodie?\"\n\n\"Enough to know that I am not Brodie. That I did not get here on the\nL-B, did not build that camp.\"\n\nHe ran one hand over the stock of the needler. Whatever motive lay\nbehind this weird game into which he had been unwillingly introduced,\nhe was now sure that it was serious enough to be dangerous.\n\n\"You have no cup this time.\"\n\n\"So you do remember.\" The other accepted that calmly. \"All right. That\nneed not necessarily spoil our plans. You have nothing to return to on\nNahuatl--unless you _liked_ the Starfall.\" His voice was icy with\ncontempt. \"To play our roles will be for your advantage, too.\" He\npaused, his gaze centering on Rynch with the intensity of one willing\nthe desired answer out of his inferior.\n\nNahuatl. Rynch caught at that. He had been on or in Nahuatl--a planet?\na city? If he could make this man believe he remembered everything\nclearly, more than just the scattered patches that he did....\n\n\"You had me planted here, then came back to hunt me. Why? What makes\nRynch Brodie so important?\"\n\n\"Close to a billion credits!\" The man from the spacer leaned well back\nin the hole, his arms spread flat out on either side to keep his body\nfrom sinking deeper. \"A billion credits,\" he repeated softly.\n\nRynch laughed. \"You'll have to think of a better one than that,\nfly-boy.\"\n\n\"The stakes would have to be high, wouldn't they, for us to go to all\nthis staging? You've been conditioned, Brodie, illegally\nbrain-channeled!\"\n\nTo Rynch the words meant nothing. If they ever had, that was gone,\nlost in the maze of other things which had been blotted out of his\nmind by the Brodie past. But he would not give the other the advantage\nof knowing his uncertainty.\n\n\"You need a Brodie for a billion credits. But you don't have a Brodie\nnow!\"\n\nTo his surprise the prisoner in the earth trap laughed. \"I'll have a\nBrodie when he's needed. Think about a good share of a billion\ncredits, boy, keep thinking of that hard.\"\n\n\"I will.\"\n\n\"Thoughts alone won't work it, you know.\" For the first time there was\na hint of some emotion in the man's voice.\n\n\"You mean I need you? I don't think so. I've stopped being a plaque\nfor someone to play across the board.\" That expression brought another\nmomentary flash of hazy memory--a smoky, crowded room where men slid\ncounters back and forth across tables--not one of Brodie's edited\nrecalls, but his own.\n\nRynch stood up, started for the rise of the slope, but before he\ntopped that he glanced back. The damaged com box still smoked where\nits wearer had flung it. Now the man was already straining forward\nwith both arms, trying to reach a rock just a finger space beyond.\nLucky for him the burrow was an old one, uninhabited. In time he\nshould be able to work his way out. Meanwhile there was the whole of a\nwide countryside in which Rynch could discover a hideout--no one would\nfind him now against his will.\n\nHe tried, as he strode along, to piece together more of his memories\nand the scanty information he had had from the Nahuatl man. So he had\nbeen \"brain-channeled,\" given a set of false memories to fit a Rynch\nBrodie whose presence on this world meant a billion credits for\nsomeone. He could not believe that this was the spaceman's game alone,\nfor hadn't he spoken of \"we\"?\n\nA billion credits! The sum was fantastic, the whole story\nunbelievable.\n\nThere was a hot stab of pain on his instep. Rynch cried out, stamped\nhard. One of the clawed scavengers was crushed. The man leaped back in\ntime to avoid another step into a swarming mass of them at work on\nsome unidentifiable carrion. Staring down at the welter of scaled,\nsegmented bodies and busy claws, he gasped.\n\nThree dead water-cats were near the man trapped in the pit. Bait to\ndraw these voracious eaters straight to the prisoner. Rynch's empty\nstomach heaved. He swung around, ran across the grassy verge of the\nupper bank, hoping he was not too late.\n\nAs he half fell, half slid down to the water, he saw that the man had\nmanaged to hook the webbing of the smouldering box to him, was casting\nit out and dragging it back patiently, aiming at the nearest rock of\nsize, fruitlessly attempting to hitch its straps over the round of\nstone.\n\nRynch dashed on, caught at that loop of webbing, and dug his heels\ninto the loose gravel as he began a steady pull. With his aid the\nother crawled out, lay panting. Rynch grabbed the man's shoulder,\njerked him away from the body of the female water-cat. He was sure he\nhad seen a telltale scurrying around the smaller of the dead cubs.\n\nThe man straightened, glanced toward Rynch who was backing off, the\nneedler up and ready between them.\n\n\"My turn to ask why?\"\n\nThen his gaze followed Rynch's. The smallest cub twitched from side to\nside. Not with any faint trace of life, but under the attack of the\nscavengers. More scuttled towards the second cub.\n\n\"Thanks!\" The stranger was on his feet. \"My name is Ras Hume. I don't\nthink I told you that when we last met.\"\n\n\"This doesn't make any difference. I'm not your man, not Brodie!\"\n\nHume shrugged. \"You think about it, Brodie, think about it with care.\nCome back to camp with me and--\"\n\n\"No!\" Rynch interrupted. \"You go your way, I go mine from here on.\"\n\nAgain the other laughed. \"Not so simple as all that, boy. We've\nstarted something which can't just be turned off as easily as you snap\ndown a switch.\" He took a step or two in Rynch's direction.\n\nThe younger man brought up the needler. \"Stay right where you are!\nYour game, Hume? All right, you play it--but not with me.\"\n\n\"And what are you going to do, take to the woods?\"\n\n\"What I do is my business, Hume.\"\n\n\"No, my business, too, very much so. I'm giving you a warning, boy, in\nreturn for your help here.\" He nodded at the pit. \"There's something\nin that woods--something which didn't show up when the Guild had their\nsurvey exploration here.\"\n\n\"The watchers.\" Rynch retreated step by step, keeping the needler\nready. \"I saw them.\"\n\n\"You've seen them!\" Hume was eager. \"What do they look like?\"\n\nIn spite of his desire to be rid of Hume, Rynch found himself\nanswering that in detail, discovering that on demand he could recall\nminutely the description of the animal hiding in the tree, the one who\nhad waited in the shelter, and those he had glimpsed drawing in about\nthe L-B clearing.\n\n\"No intelligence.\" Hume turned his head to survey the distant wood.\n\"The verifier reported no intelligence.\"\n\n\"These watchers--you don't know them?\"\n\n\"No. Nor do I like what you've seen of them, Brodie. So I'm willing to\ncall a truce. The Guild believed Jumala an open planet, our records\naccredited it so. If that is not true we may be in for bad trouble. As\nan Out-Hunter I am responsible for the safety of three civs back there\nin the safari camp.\"\n\nHume made sense, much as Rynch disliked admitting it. And the Hunter\nmust have read something of his agreement in his face for now he\nnodded and added briskly:\n\n\"Best place now is the safari camp. We'll head back at once.\"\n\nOnly time had run out. A noise sounded with a metallic ring. Rynch\nwhirled, needler cocked. A glittering ball about the size of his fist\nrolled away from contact with a boulder, came to rest in the deep\ndepression of one of Hume's boot tracks. Then another flash through\nthe air, a clatter as a second ball spun across a patch of gravel.\n\nThe balls seemed to appear out of the air. Displaying rainbow glints\nthey rolled in a semicircle about the two men. Rynch stooped, then\nHume's fingers latched about his wrist, dragging his hand away from\nthe globe. It was only then that he realized that sharp action had\ndetached his attention from that ball he had wanted to take up.\n\n\"Don't touch!\" Hume barked. \"And don't look at that too closely! Come\nalong!\" He pulled Rynch forward through the yet unclosed arc of the\nglobe circle.\n\nHume detoured around the feasting scavengers and brought Rynch with\nhim at a trot. They could hear behind them the plop and tinkle of more\nglobes. Glancing back Rynch saw one fall close to the bodies of the\nwater-cats.\n\n\"Wait a minute!\" He pulled back against Hume's hold. Here was a chance\nto see what effect that crystal had on the clawed carrion eater.\n\nThere was a change in the crystal: Yellow now, then red--red as the\nfew scraps of fur remaining on the rapidly disappearing body.\n\n\"Look!\"\n\nThe pulsating carpet which had covered the dead feline ceased to move.\nBut towards that spot rolled two more of the globes, approaching the\nscavengers. Now the clawed things were stirring, dropping away from\ntheir prey. They spread out in a patch, moved purposefully forward.\nBehind them, as guardians might head a flock, rolled three globes,\nflushing scarlet, then more.\n\nHume's hand came up. From the cone tip of the ray tube spat a lance of\nfire, to strike the middle crystal. The beam was reflected into the\nblock of scavengers. Scaled bodies, twisted, crisped, were ash. But\nthe crystal continued to roll at the same pace.\n\n\"Move!\" Hume's other hand hit Rynch's shoulder, knocked him forward in\nan impetuous shove which nearly took him off his feet. Both men began\nto run.\n\n\"What--what are those things?\" Rynch appealed between panting breaths.\n\n\"I don't know--and I don't like their looks. They're between us and\nthe safari camp if we keep to the river--\"\n\n\"Between us and the river now.\" Rynch saw that glittering swoop\nthrough the air, marked the landing of a ball near the water's edge.\n\n\"Might be trying to box us in. But that's not going to work.\nSee--ahead there where that log's caught between two rocks? Run out on\nthat when we reach there and take to the water. I don't think those\nthings can float and if they sink to the bottom that ought to fix them\nas far as we are concerned.\"\n\nRynch ran, still holding the needler. He balanced along the drift log\nHume had pointed out and a jump sent him floundering in the brown\nstream thigh deep. Hume joined him, his face grim.\n\n\"Downstream--\"\n\nRynch looked. One shape--two--three--Clearly detailed where matching\nvegetation gave them no covering camouflage, the watchers had come out\nof the woods at last. A line of them were walking quietly and upright\ntowards the humans, their blue-green fuzz covering like a mist under\nthe direct rays of the sun. Quiet as they seemed at present, the\nthings out of the Jumalan forest were a picture of sheer brute\nstrength as they moved.\n\n\"Let's get out of here--fast!\"\n\nThe men kept moving, and always after them padded that silent line of\ngreen-blue, pushing them farther and farther away from the safari\ncamp, on towards the rising mountain peaks. Just as the globes had\nshaken the scavengers loose from their meal and sent them marching on,\nso were the humans being herded for some unknown purpose.\n\nAt least, once the march of the beasts began, they saw and heard no\nmore of the globes. And as they reached a curve in the river, Hume\nstopped, swung around, stood studying the line of decorously pacing\nanimals.\n\n\"We can pick them off with the needler or the ray.\"\n\nThe Hunter shook his head. \"You don't kill,\" he recited the credo of\nhis Guild, \"not until you are sure. There is a method behind this, and\nmethod means intelligence.\"\n\nHandling of X-tee creatures and peoples was a part of Guild training.\nIn spite of his devious game here on Jumala, Hume was Guild educated\nand Rynch was willing to leave such decisions to him.\n\nThe other held out the ray tube. \"Take this, cover me, but don't use\nit until I say so. Understand?\"\n\nHe waited only for Rynch's nod before he started, at a deliberate pace\nwhich matched that of the beasts, back through the river shallows to\nmeet them. But that advancing line halted, stood waiting in silence.\nHume's hands went up, palm out, he spoke slowly in Basic-X-Tee clicks:\n\n\"Friend.\" This was all Rynch could make out of that sing-song of\nsyllables Rynch knew to be a contact pattern.\n\nThe dark eye pits continued to stare. A light breeze ruffled the fuzz\ncovering of wide shoulders, long muscular arms. Not a head moved, not\none of those heavy, rounded jaws opened to emit any answering sound.\nHume halted. The silence was threatening, a portending atmosphere\nspread from the alien things as might a tangible wave.\n\nFor perhaps two breaths they stood so, man facing alien. Then Hume\nturned, walked back, his face set. Rynch offered him the ray tube.\n\n\"Fight our way out?\"\n\n\"Too late. Look!\"\n\nMoving lines of blue-green coming down to the river. Not five or six\nnow--a dozen--twenty. There was a small trickle of moisture down the\nside of the Hunter's brown face.\n\n\"We're penned--except straight ahead.\"\n\n\"But we're going to fight!\" Rynch protested.\n\n\"No. Move on!\"\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nIt was some time before Hume found what he wanted, an islet in\nmidstream lacking any growth and rising to a rough pinnacle. The sides\nwere seamed with crevices and caves which promised protection for\none's back in any desperate struggle. And they had discovered it none\ntoo soon, for the late afternoon shadows were lengthening.\n\nThere had been no attack, just the trailing to herd the men to the\nnortheast. And Rynch had lost the first tight pinch of panic, though\nhe knew the folly of underestimating the unknown.\n\nThey climbed with unspoken consent, going clear to the top, where they\nhuddled together on a four-foot tableland. Hume unhooked his distance\nlenses, but it was toward the rises of the mountains that he aimed\nthem, not along the back trail.\n\nRynch wriggled about, studied the river and its banks. The beasts\nthere were quiet, blue-green lumps, standing down on the river bank or\nsquatting in the grass.\n\n\"Nothing.\" Hume lowered the lenses, held them before his broad chest\nas he still watched the peaks.\n\n\"What did you expect?\" Rynch snapped. He was hungry, but not hungry\nenough to abandon the islet.\n\nHume laughed shortly. \"I don't know. Only I'm sure they are heading us\nin that direction.\"\n\n\"Look here,\" Rynch rounded on him. \"You know this planet, you've been\nhere before.\"\n\n\"I was one of the survey team that approved it for the Guild.\"\n\n\"Then you must have combed it pretty thoroughly. How is it that you\ndidn't know about them?\" He gestured to their pursuers.\n\n\"That is what I would like to ask a few assorted experts right about\nnow,\" Hume returned. \"The verifiers registered no intelligent native\nlife here.\"\n\n\"No native life.\" Rynch chewed that over, came up with the obvious\nexplanation. \"All right--so then maybe our blue-backed friends are\nimported. Suppose someone's running a private business of his own here\nand wants to get rid of visitors?\"\n\nHume looked thoughtful. \"No.\" He did not enlarge upon his negative.\nSitting down he pulled a cylinder container from a belt loop and shook\nout four tablets, handing two to Rynch, mouthing the others.\n\n\"Vita-blocks--good for twenty-four hours sustenance.\"\n\nThe iron rations depended upon by all exploring services did not have\nthe satisfying taste of real food. However Rynch swallowed them\ndutifully before he descended with Hume to river level. The Hunter\nsplashed water from the stream into a depression in the rock and\ndropped a pinch of clarifying powder into it.\n\n\"With the dark,\" he announced, \"we might be able to get through their\nlines.\"\n\n\"You believe that?\"\n\nHume laughed. \"No--but one doesn't overlook the factor of sheer luck.\nAlso, I don't care to finish up at the place they may have chosen for\nus.\" He tilted his chin to study the sky. \"We'll take watches and rest\nin turn. No use trying anything until it is dark--unless they start to\nmove in. You take the first one?\"\n\nAs Rynch nodded, Hume edged back into a crevice as a shelled creature\nwithdrawing to natural protection, going to sleep as easily as if he\ncould control that state by will. Rynch, watching him curiously for a\nsecond or two before climbing up to a position from which he judged he\ncould see all sides of their refuge, determined not to be surprised.\n\nThe watchers were crouched down, waiting with that patience which had\nimpressed him from his first sight of the camp sentries back in the\nforest. There was no movement, no sound. They were simply there--on\nguard. And Rynch did not believe that the darkness of night would\nbring any relaxation of that vigilance.\n\nHe leaned back, feeling the grit of the rocky surface against his bare\nback and shoulders. Under his hand was the most efficient and\nformidable weapon known to the frontier worlds, from this post he\ncould keep the enemy under surveillance and think.\n\nHume had had him planted here, in the first place, provided with the\nmemory of Rynch Brodie--the reward for him was to be a billion\ncredits. Too much staff work had gone into his conditioning for just a\nsmall stake.\n\nSo Rynch Brodie was on Jumala, and Hume had come with witnesses to\nfind him. Another part of his mind stood aloof now, applauding the\nclearness of his reasoning. Rynch Brodie was to be discovered a\ncastaway on Jumala. Only, matters had not worked out according to\nHume's plan. In the first place he was certain he had not been\nintended to know that he was not Rynch Brodie. For a fleeting second\nhe wondered why that conditioning had not completely worked, then went\nback to the problem of his relationship with Hume.\n\nNo, the Out-Hunter had expected a castaway who would be just what he\nordered. Then this affair of the watchers--creatures the Guild men had\nnot found here a few months ago--Rynch felt a small cold chill along\nhis spine. Hume's game was one thing, something he could understand,\nbut the silent beasts were another and somehow far more disturbing\nthreat.\n\nRynch edged forward, watching the mist on the water, his brain\nstriving to solve this other puzzle as neatly as he thought he had\ndiscovered the reason for his scrambled memories and his being on\nJumala.\n\nThe mist was an added danger. Thick enough and those watchers could\nmove in under its curtain. A needler was efficient, yes, but it could\nwipe out only an enemy at which it was aimed. Blind cross sweeping\nwith its darts would only exhaust the clip without results, save by\nlucky chance.\n\nOn the other hand, suppose they could turn that same gray haze to\ntheir own advantage--use it to blanket their withdrawal? He was about\nto go to Hume with that suggestion when he sighted the new move in\ntheir odd battle with the aliens.\n\nA wink of light--two more--blinking, following the erratic course by\nthe pull of the stream. All bobbing along toward the rugged coastline\nof the islet. Those had appeared out of nothingness as suddenly as the\nglobes when this chase had begun.\n\nThe globes and the winking lights on the water connected in his mind,\nargued new danger. Rynch took careful aim, fired a dart at one which\nhad grounded on the pointed tip of the rocks where the river current\ncame together after its division about the island. For the first time\nRynch realized those things below were moving _against_ the\ncurrent--they had come upstream as if propelled.\n\nHe had fired and the light was still there, two more coming in behind\nit, so that now there was an irregular cluster of them. And there was\nactivity on the water-washed rocks before them. Just as the scavengers\nhad moved ahead of the globes on land, so now aquatic creatures had\ncome out of the river, were flopping higher on the islet. And those\nlights were changing color--from white to reddish-yellow.\n\nRynch scrabbled with one hand in a rock crevice, found a stone he had\nnoted earlier. He hurled that at the cluster of lights. There was a\npuff of brilliant red, one was gone. Something flopping on the rocks\ngave a mewling cry and somersaulted back into the water. Then a finger\nof mist drew between Rynch and the lights which were now only faint,\nglowing patches. He swung down from his perch, shook Hume awake.\n\nThe Out-Hunter made that instant return to full consciousness which\nwas another defense for the men who live long on the rim of wild\nworlds.\n\n\"What--?\"\n\nRynch pulled him forward. The mist had thickened, but there were more\nof those ominous lights at water level, spreading down both sides of\nthe point, forming a wall. Dark forms moved out of the water ahead of\nthem, flopping on the rocks, pressing higher, towards the ledge where\nthe men stood.\n\n\"Those globes--I think they're moving in the river now.\" Rynch found\nanother stone, took careful aim, and smashed a second one. \"The\nneedler has no effect on them,\" he reported. \"Stones do--but I don't\nknow why.\"\n\nThey searched about them in the crevices for more ammunition, laying\nup a line of fist-sized rocks, while the lights gathered in, spreading\nfarther and farther down the shores of the islet. Hume cried out\nsuddenly, and aimed his ray tube below. The lance of its blast cut the\ndark as might a bolt of lightning.\n\nWith a shrill squeal, a blot shadow detached from the slope\nimmediately below them. A vile, musky scent, now mingled with the\nstench of burning flesh, set them coughing.\n\n\"Water spider!\" Hume identified. \"If they are driving those out and up\nat....\"\n\nHe fumbled at his equipment belt and then tossed an object downward to\ndisintegrate in a shower of fiery sparks. Wherever those sparks\ntouched rock or ground they flared up in tall thin columns of fire,\nlighting up the nightmare on the rocks and up the ledges.\n\nRynch fired the needler, Hume's ray tube flashed and flashed again.\nThings squealed, or grunted, or died silently, while clawing to reach\nthe upper ledges. He could not be sure of the nature of some of those\nthings. One, armed and clawed as the scavengers, was nearly as large\nas a water-cat. And a furry, man-legged creature, with a double-jawed\nhead, bore also a ring of phosphorescent eyes set in a complete circle\nabout its skull. They were alien life routed out of the water.\n\n\"The lights--smash the lights!\" Hume ordered.\n\nRynch understood. The lights had driven these attackers out of the\nriver. Put out the lights and the boiling broth of water dwellers\nmight conceivably return to their homes. He dropped the needler, took\nup stones and set about the business of finishing off as many of the\nlights as he could.\n\nHume fired into the crawling mass, pausing only once to send another\nof those flame bombs crashing to illuminate the scene. The water\ncreatures bewildered, clumsy out of their element, were so far at his\nmercy. But their numbers, in spite of the piling dead, were still a\ndangerous threat.\n\nRynch tore gapping holes in that line of lights. But he could see,\nthrough the mist, more floating sparks, gathering to take their\nplaces, perhaps herding before them more water things to attack.\nExcept for those few gaps he had wrought, the islet was now completely\nenveloped.\n\n\"Ahhhh--\" Hume's voice arose in a roar of anger and defiance. He\nstabbed his ray down at a spot just below their ledge. A huge\nsegmented, taloned leg kicked, caught on the edge of the stone at the\nlevel of their feet, twisted aloft again and was gone.\n\n\"Up!\" Hume ordered. \"To the top!\"\n\nRynch caught up two handsful of stones, holding them to his chest with\nhis left arm as he made a last cast to see one light puff out in\nanswer. Then they both scrambled on to that small platform at the top\nof the islet. By the aid of the burning flame-torches the Hunter had\nset, they could see that most of the rocky slopes below them now\nsquirmed with a horrible mass of water life.\n\nWhere Hume had fired his ray there was fierce activity, as the living\nfeasted on the slain and quarreled over the bounty. But from other\nquarters the crawling advance pressed on.\n\n\"I have only one more flame flare,\" Hume stated.\n\nOne more flare--then they would be in the dark with the mist hiding\nthe forward-moving enemy.\n\n\"I wonder if they are watching out there?\" Rynch scowled into the\ndark.\n\n\"They--or what sent them. They know what they are doing.\"\n\n\"You mean they must have done this before?\"\n\n\"I think so. That L-B back there--it made a good landing, and there\nare supplies missing from its lockers.\"\n\n\"Which you removed--\" Rynch countered.\n\n\"No. There might have been real castaways landed here. Not that we\nfound any trace of them. Now I can guess why--\"\n\n\"But you Guild men were here, and you didn't run into this!\"\n\n\"I know.\" Hume sounded baffled. \"Not a sign then.\"\n\nRynch threw the last of his stones, heard it clink harmlessly against\na rock. Hume balanced an object on the palm of his hand.\n\n\"Last flare!\"\n\n\"What's that? Over there?\"\n\nRynch had sighted the flashing out of the dark from the river bank,\nmaking a pattern of flickers which bore no relation to the infernal\nlights at the water's edge.\n\nHume's ray tube pointed skyward as he answered with a series of short\nbursts.\n\n\"Take cover!\" The call came weirdly out over the water, the tone\ndehumanized. Hume cupped his mouth with one hand, shouted back:\n\n\"We're on top--no cover.\"\n\n\"Then flatten down--we're blasting!\"\n\nThey flattened, lay almost in each other's arms, curled on that narrow\nspace. Even through his closed eyelids Rynch caught the flash of\nvivid, man-made lightning crashing first on one side of the islet and\nthen on the other, and sweeping every crawling horror out of life,\ninto odorous ash. The backlash of that blast must have caught the\nmajority of the lights also. For when Rynch and Hume cautiously sat\nup, they saw only a handful of widely scattered and dulling globes\nbelow.\n\nThey choked, coughed, rubbed watering eyes as the fumes from the\nscorched rocks wreathed up about their perch.\n\n\"Flitter with life line--above you!\"\n\nThat voice had come out of what should have been empty air over their\nheads. A gangling line trailed across their bodies, a line with a\nsafety belt locked to it, and a second was uncoiling in a slow loop as\nthey watched.\n\nIn unison they grabbed for those means of escape, buckled the belts\nabout them.\n\n\"Haul away!\" Hume called. The lines tightened, their bodies swung up\nclear of the blasted river island, as their unseen transport headed\nfor the eastern shore.\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nA subdued but steady light all around him issued from stark gray\nwalls. He lay on his back in an empty cell-room. And he'd better be on\nthe move before Darfu comes to enforce a rising order with a powerful\nkick or one of these backhanded blows which the Salarkian used to\nreduce most humans to helpless obedience.\n\nVye blinked again. But this wasn't his cubby hole at the Starfall, his\nnose as well as his eyes told him that. There was no hint of\nuncleanliness or corruption here. He sat up stiffly, looked down at\nhis own body in dull wonder. The only covering on his bare, brown self\nwas a wide, scaled belt and a loin cloth. Clumsy sandals shod his\nfeet, and his legs, up to thigh level, were striped with healing\nscratches and blotched with bruises.\n\nPainfully, with mental processes as stiff as his arms and his legs, he\ntried to think back. Sluggishly, memory associated one picture with\nanother.\n\nLast night--or yesterday--Rynch Brodie had been locked in here. And\n\"here\" was one of the storage compartments of a spacer belonging to a\nman named Wass. It had been Wass' pilot in the flitter which snaked\nthem from the river islet where the monsters had besieged them.\n\nThis was a concealed, fortified camp--Wass' hideout. And he was a\nprisoner with a very uncertain future, depending upon the will of the\nVeep and a man named Hume.\n\nHume, the Out-Hunter, had shown no surprise when Wass stood up in the\nlamplight to greet the rescued. \"I see you have been hunting.\" His\neyes had moved from Hume to Rynch and back again.\n\n\"Yes--but that does not matter!\" the Hunter had returned impatiently.\n\n\"No? Then what does?\"\n\n\"This is not a free world, I have to report that. Get my civs off\nplanet before something happens to them!\"\n\n\"I thought all safari worlds were certified as free,\" Wass countered.\n\n\"This one isn't. I don't know how or why. But that fact has to be\nreported and the civs lifted--\"\n\n\"Not so fast.\" Wass' voice had been quiet, almost gentle. \"Such a\nreport would interest the Patrol, would it not?\"\n\n\"Of course--\" Hume began and then stopped abruptly.\n\nWass smiled. \"You see--complications already. I do not wish to explain\nanything to the Patrol. Nor do you either, my young friend, not when\nyou stop to think about what might result from such explanations.\"\n\n\"There wouldn't have been any trouble if you'd kept away from Jumala.\"\nHume's control had returned; both voice and manner were under tight\nrein. \"Weren't Rovald's reports explicit enough to satisfy you?\"\n\n\"I have risked a great deal on this project,\" Wass replied. \"Also, it\nis well from time to time for a Veep to check upon his field\noperatives. Men do not grow careless when personal supervision is ever\nin mind. And it is well that I did arrive here, is it not, Hunter? Or\nwould you have preferred remaining on that island? Whether any of our\nproject may be salvaged is a point we must consider. But for the\nmoment we make no moves. No, Hume, your civs will have to take their\nchances for a time.\"\n\n\"And if there is trouble?\" Hume challenged him. \"A report of an alien\nattack will bring in the Patrol quickly enough.\"\n\n\"You forget Rovald,\" Wass corrected. \"The chance that one of your civs\ncan activate and transmit from the spacer is remote, and Rovald will\nsee that it is impossible. You have picked up Brodie, I see.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"No!\" What had possessed him at that moment to contradict? He had\nrealized the folly of his outburst the moment Wass had looked at him.\n\n\"This becomes more interesting,\" the Veep had remarked with that\ndeceptive gentleness. \"You are Rynch Brodie, castaway from the Largo\nDrift, are you not? I trust that Out-Hunter Hume has made plain to you\nour concern with your welfare, Gentlehomo Brodie.\"\n\n\"I'm not Brodie.\" Having taken the leap into the dangerous truth he\nwas stubborn enough to continue swimming.\n\n\"I find this enlightening indeed. If you are not Brodie--then who are\nyou?\"\n\nThat had been it. At that moment he couldn't have told Wass who he\nwas, explain that his patchwork of memories had gaping holes.\n\n\"And you, Out-Hunter,\" Wass' reptilian regard had moved again to Hume,\n\"perhaps you have an adequate explanation for this discovery.\"\n\n\"None of his doing,\" he burst out, \"I remembered--\"\n\nSome inexplicable emotion made Rynch defend Hume then.\n\nHume laughed, and there was a reckless edge to that sound. \"Yes, Wass,\nyour techs are not as good as they pretend to be. He didn't follow the\npattern of action they set for him.\"\n\n\"A pity. But there are always errors when one deals with the human\nfactor. Peake!\" One of the other three men moved towards them. \"You\nwill escort this young man to the spacer, see him safely stowed for\nthe present. Yes, a pity. Now we must see just how much can be\nsalvaged.\"\n\nThen Vye had been brought into the shop, supplied with a ration\ncontainer, and left to himself within this bare-walled cabin to\nmeditate upon the folly of talking too freely. Why had he been so\nutterly stupid? Veeps of Wass' calibre did not swim through the murky\nchannels of the Starfall, but their general breed had smaller but just\nas vicious representatives there, and he knew the man for what he was,\nruthless, powerful and thorough.\n\nA sound, slight, but easily heard in the silent vacuum of the storage\ncabin, alerted him. The crack of the sliding panel door opened and Vye\ncrouched, his hand cupping the only possible weapon, the ration\ncontainer. Hume edged through, shut the door behind him. He stood\nthere, his head turned so his ear rested against the wall; obviously\nhe was listening.\n\n\"You brain-smoothed idiot!\" The Hunter's voice was a thread of\nwhisper. \"Why couldn't you have kept that swinging jaw of yours closed\nlast night? Now listen and listen good. This is a slim try, but it's\none we have to take.\"\n\n\"We?\" Vye was startled into asking.\n\n\"Yes, we! By rights I ought to leave you right here to do the rest of\nyour big, brave speechmaking for Wass' benefit. If I didn't need you,\nthat's just what I would do! If it weren't for those civs--\" His head\nsnapped back, cheek to panel, he was listening again. After a long\nmoment his whisper came once more. \"I don't have time to repeat this.\nIn about five minutes Peake'll be here with rations. I'll leave this\ndoor unlatched. There's another storage cabin across the corridor--see\nif you can hide there, then trick him into getting in here and lock\nhim in. Got it?\"\n\nVye nodded.\n\n\"Then--make for the exit port. Here.\" He snapped a packet loose from\nhis belt. \"This is a flare pak, you saw how they worked on the island.\nWhen you get on the ramp beyond the atom lamp, throw this. It should\nhit the camp force barrier. And the result ought to hold their\nattention. Then you head for the flitter. Understand?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nThe flitter, yes, that was the perfect escape. With a camp force\nbarrier on, any fugitive could only break out by going straight up.\n\nHume gazed at him soberly, listened once more, and then went. Vye\ncounted a slow five before he followed. The cabin across the corridor\nwas open, just as Hume had promised. He slipped inside, waited.\n\nPeake was coming now, the metallic plates on his spaceboots clicking\nin regular pattern of sound. He earned another ration container and\ncrooked it in his arm as he snapped up the lock bar on the other\ncabin.\n\nThere was an exclamation of surprise. Vye went into action. His hand,\nbacked by all the strength of his thrusting arm, thumped between\nPeake's shoulders, sending him staggering into the prison compartment.\nBefore the other could recover either his balance or his wits, Vye had\nthe panel shut, the bar locked into place.\n\nHe ran down the corridor to the well ladder, swung down its rungs with\nan agility born of necessity. Then he was in the air lock, getting his\nbearings. The flitter stood to his left, the flashing atom lamp, where\nthe men were gathered, to his right.\n\nVye stepped out on the ramp. He wiped his sweating hand across his\nthigh. There had to be no failures in the tossing of the flare pak.\n\nChoosing a spot, not directly in line with the lamp but near enough to\ndazzle the men, he hurled it with all the force he could muster. Then\nhe was running down the ramp, forward to the area of the ship.\n\nThere was a flash--shouting--Vye curbed the impulse to look back,\ndarted for the flitter. He jerked open the cabin compartment,\nscrambled into the cramped space behind the pilot's seat, leaving that\nfree for Hume's quick entrance. More shouting--now he saw the lines of\nfire wavering from earth to sky along the barrier.\n\nA black shape put on a burst of speed, was silhouetted against that\nflaming wall, then passed the spacer, grabbed at the open cockpit, and\nslid in behind the controls. Hume pulled the levers with flying\nfingers. They arose vertically at a pace which practically slapped\nVye's stomach up into the lower regions of his throat.\n\nThe searing line of at least one blaster reached after them--too\nslowly, too low. He heard Hume grunt, and they again leaped higher.\nThen the Hunter spoke:\n\n\"Half an hour at the most--\"\n\n\"The safari camp?\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nThey no longer climbed. The flitter was boring forwards on a\nprojectile flight, into the dark of the night.\n\n\"What're those?\" Vye suddenly leaned forward.\n\nHad some of the stars across the space void broken free from their\nfixed orbits? Flecks of light, moving in an arc, headed towards the\nspeeding flitter.\n\nHume hit a button. Again they arose in a violent leap above those\nwandering lights. But ahead on this new level more such dots flocked,\nmoving fast to close in on the flyer.\n\n\"A straight ram course,\" Hume muttered, more to himself than Vye.\n\nAgain the flyer drove forward in a rising thrust of speed. Then the\nsmooth purr of the propulsion unit faltered, broke into protesting\ncoughs. Hume worked over the controls, beads of sweat showing on his\nforehead and cheek in the gleam of the cabin light.\n\n\"Deading--deading out!\"\n\nHe brought the flitter around in a wide circle, the purr smoothed out\nonce more in a steady reassuring beat.\n\n\"Out run them!\"\n\nBut Vye feared they were back again on the losing side of a struggle\nwith the unknown alien power. As they had been herded along the river,\nso now they were being pushed across the sky, towards the mountains.\nThe enemy had followed them aloft!\n\nSome core of stubborn will in Hume would not yet allow him to admit\nthat. Time and time again he climbed higher--always to meet climbing,\ntwisting, spurting lines of lights which reacted on the engine of the\nflitter and threatened it with complete failure.\n\nWhere they were now in relation to Wass' camp or that of the safari,\nVye had no idea, and he guessed that Hume could not be too certain.\n\nHume switched on the flitter's com unit, tried a channel search until\nhe picked up a click of signal--the automatic reply of the safari\ncamp. His fingertip beat out in return the danger warning, then the\nseries of code sounds to give an edited version of what must be\nguarded against.\n\n\"Wass has a man in your camp. His skin is in just as much danger as\nthe rest. He may not relay it to the Patrol, but he'll keep the force\nbarrier up and the civs inside--anything else would be malicious\nneglect and a murder charge when the Guild check tape goes in. This\ncall is on the spacer tape now and will be a part of that--he can't\npossibly alter such a report and he knows it. This is the best we can\ndo now--\"\n\n\"We're close to the mountains, aren't we?\"\n\n\"Do you know much about this part of the country?\" Vye persisted.\nHume's knowledge might be their only hope.\n\n\"Flew over the range twice. Nothing to see.\"\n\n\"But there has to be something there.\"\n\n\"If there is, it didn't show up during our survey.\" Hume's voice was\ndull with fatigue.\n\n\"You're a Guild man, you've dealt with alien life forms before--\"\n\n\"The Guild doesn't deal with intelligent aliens. That's X-Tee Patrol\nbusiness. We don't land on any planet with unknown intelligent life\nforms. Why should we court trouble--couldn't run a safari in under\nthose conditions. X-Tee certified Jumala as a wild world, our survey\nconfirmed that.\"\n\n\"Someone or something landed here after you left?\"\n\n\"I don't believe so. This is too well organized an action. And since\nwe have a satellite guard in space, any ship landing would be taped\nand recorded. No such record appeared on the Guild screens. One small\nspacer--such as Wass'--could slip through by knowing procedure--just\nas he did. But to land all those beasts and equipment they'd need a\nregular transport. No--this must be native.\" Hume leaned forward\nagain, flipped a switch.\n\nA small red light answered on the central board.\n\n\"Radar warn-off,\" he explained.\n\nSo they wouldn't end up smeared against some cliff face anyway. Which\nwas only small comfort amid terrifying possibilities.\n\nHume had taken the precaution just in time. The light blinked faster,\nand the speed of the flyer was checked as the automatic control\ntriggered by the warn-off came into command. Hume's hands were still\non the board, but a system of relays put safety devices into action\nwith a speed past that which a human pilot could initiate.\n\nThey were descending and had to accept that, since the warn-off,\noperating for the sake of the passengers, had ruled that move best.\nThe directive would glide the flitter to the best available landing.\nIt was only moments before the shock gear did touch surface. Then the\nengine was silent.\n\n\"This is it,\" Hume observed.\n\n\"What do we do now?\" Vye wanted to know.\n\n\"Wait--\"\n\n\"Wait! For what?\"\n\nHume consulted his planet-time watch in the light of the cabin.\n\n\"We have about an hour until dawn--if dawn arrives here at the same\ntime it does in the plains. I don't propose to go out blindly in the\ndark.\"\n\nWhich made sense. Except that to sit here, quietly, in their cramped\nquarters, not knowing what might be waiting outside, was an ordeal Vye\nfound increasingly harder to bear. Maybe Hume guessed his discomfort,\nmaybe he was following routine procedure. But he turned, thumbed open\none of the side panels in Vye's compartment, and dug out the emergency\nsupplies.\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\nThey sorted the crash rations into small packs. A blanket of the\nwater-resistant, feather-heavy Ozakian spider silk was cut into a\nprotective covering for Vye. That piece of tailoring occupied them\nuntil the graying sky permitted them a full picture of the pocket in\nwhich the flitter had landed. The dark foliage of the mountain growth\nwas broken here by a ledge of dark-blue stone on which the flyer\nrested.\n\nTo the right was a sheer drop, and a land slip had cut away the ledge\nitself a few feet behind the flitter. There was only a steadily\nnarrowing path ahead, slanting upward.\n\n\"Can we take off again?\" Vye hoped to be reassured that such a feat\nwas possible.\n\n\"Look up!\"\n\nVye backed against the cliff wall, stared up at the sky. Well above\nthem those globes still swam in unwearied circles, commanding the air\nlanes.\n\nHume had cautiously approached the outer rim of the ledge, was using\nhis distance glasses to scan what might lie below.\n\n\"No sign yet.\"\n\nVye knew what he meant. The globes were overhead, but the blue beasts,\nor any other fauna those balls might summon, had not yet appeared.\n\nShouldering their packs they started along the ledge. Hume had his ray\ntube, but Vye was weaponless, unless somewhere along their route he\ncould pick up some defensive and offensive arm. Stones had burst the\nlights of the islet, they might prove as effective against the blue\nbeasts. He kept watch for any of the proper size and weight.\n\nThe ledge narrowed, one shoulder scraped the cliff now as they\nrounded a pinnacle to lose sight of the flitter. But the globes\ncontinued to hover over them.\n\n\"We are still traveling in the direction they want,\" Vye speculated.\n\nHume had gone to hands and knees to negotiate an ascent so steep he\nhad to search for head and toe holds. When they were safely past that\npoint they took a breather, and Vye glanced aloft again. Now the sky\nwas empty.\n\n\"We may have arrived, or are about to do so,\" said Hume.\n\n\"Where?\"\n\nHume shrugged. \"Your guess is as good as mine. And both of us can be\nwrong.\"\n\nThe steep ascent did not quite reach the top of the cliff around the\nface of which the ledge curled. Instead their path now leveled off and\nbegan to widen out so that they could walk with more confidence. Then\nit threaded into a crevice between two towering rock walls and sloped\ndownward.\n\nA path unnaturally smooth, Vye thought, as if shaped to funnel\nwayfarers on. And they came out on the rim of a valley, a valley\ncentered with a wood-encircled lake. They stepped from the rock of the\npassage onto a springy turf which gave elastically to their tread.\n\nVye's sandal struck a round stone. It started from its bed in the\nblack-green vegetation, turned over so that round pits stared\neyelessly up at him. He was faced by the fleshless grin of a human\nskull.\n\nHume went down on one knee, examined the ground growth, gingerly\nlifted the lace of vertebrae forming a spine. That ended in a crushed\nbreak which he studied briefly before he laid the bones gently back\ninto the concealing cover of the mossy stuff.\n\n\"That was done by teeth!\"\n\nThe cup of green valley had not changed, it was the same as it had\nbeen when they had emerged from the crevice. But now every clump of\ntrees, every wind-rippled mound of brush promised cover.\n\nVye moistened his lips, diverted his eyes from the skull.\n\n\"Weathered,\" Hume said slowly, \"must have been here for seasons, maybe\nplanet years.\"\n\n\"A survivor from the L-B?\" Yet this spot lay days of travel from that\nclearing back in the plains.\n\n\"How did he get here?\"\n\n\"Probably the same way we would have, had we not holed up on that\nriver island.\"\n\nDriven! Perhaps the lone human on Jumala herded up into this dead-end\nvalley by the globes or the blue beasts. \"This process must have been\nin action for some time.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"I can give you two reasons.\" Hume studied the nearest trees narrowly.\n\"First--for some purpose, whatever we are up against wants all\ninterlopers moved out of the lowlands into this section, either to\nimprison them, or to keep them under surveillance. Second--\" He\nhesitated.\n\nVye's own imagination supplied a second reason, a revolting one he\ntried to deny to himself even as he put it into words:\n\n\"That broken spine--food....\" Vye wanted Hume to contradict him, but\nthe Hunter only glanced around, his expression already sufficient\nanswer.\n\n\"Let's get out of here!\" Vye was fighting down panic with every ounce\nof control he could summon, trying not to bolt for the crevice. But he\nknew he could not force himself any farther into that sinister valley.\n\n\"If we can!\" Hume's words lingered direly in his ears.\n\nStones had smashed the globes by the river. If they still waited out\nthere Vye was willing to try and break them with his bare hands,\nshould escape demand such action. Hume must have agreed with those\nthoughts, he was already taking long strides back to the cliff\nentrance.\n\nBut that door was closed. Hume's foot, raised for the last step toward\nthe crevice corridor, struck an invisible obstruction. He reeled back,\nclutching at Vye's shoulder.\n\n\"Something's there!\"\n\nThe younger man put out his hand questingly. What his fingers\nflattened against was not a tight, solid surface, but rather an unseen\nelastic curtain which gave a little under his prodding and then drew\ntaut again.\n\nTogether they explored by touch what they could not see. The crevice\nthrough which they had entered was now closed with a curtain they\ncould not pierce or break. Hume tried his ray tube. They watched thin\nflame run up and down that invisible barrier, but not destroy it.\n\nHume relooped the tube. \"Their trap is sprung.\"\n\n\"There may be another way out!\" But Vye was already despondently sure\nthere was not. Those who had rigged this trap would leave no bolt\nholes. But because they were human and refused to accept the\ninevitable without a fight, the captives set off, not down into the\ncurve of the cup, but along its slope.\n\nTongues of brush and tree clumps brought about detours which forced\nthem slowly downward. They were well away from the crevice when Hume\nhalted, flung up a hand in silent warning. Vye listened, trying to\npick up the sound which had alarmed his companion.\n\nIt was as Vye strained to catch a betraying noise that he was first\nconscious of what he did not hear. In the plains there had been\nsqueaking, humming, chitterings, the vocalizing of myriad grass\ndwellers. Here, except for the sighing of the wind and a few insect\nsounds--nothing. All inhabitants bigger than a Jumalan fly might have\nlong ago been routed out of the land.\n\n\"To the left.\" Hume faced about.\n\nThere was a heavy thicket there, too stoutly grown for anything to be\nwithin its shadow. Whatever moved must be behind it.\n\nVye looked about him frantically for anything he could use as a\nweapon. Then he grabbed at the long bush knife in Hume's belt sheath.\nEighteen inches of tri-fold steel gleamed wickedly, its hilt fitting\nneatly into his fist as he held it point up, ready.\n\nHume advanced on the bush in small steps, and Vye circled to his left\na few paces behind. The Hunter was an expert with ray tube; that, too,\nwas part of the necessary skill of a safari leader. But Vye could\noffer other help.\n\nHe shrugged out of the blanket pack he had been carrying on his back,\ntossed that burden ahead.\n\nOut of cover charged a streak of red, to land on the bait. Hume\nblasted, was answered by a water-cat's high-pitched scream. The feline\nwrithed out of its life in a stench of scorched fur and flesh. As Vye\nretrieved his clawed pack Hume stood over the dead animal.\n\n\"Odd.\" He reached down to grasp a still twitching foreleg, stretched\nthe body out with a sudden jerk.\n\nIt was a giant of its species, a male, larger than any he had seen.\nBut a second look showed him those ribs starting through mangy fur in\nvisible hoops, the skin tight over the skull, far too tight. The\nwater-cat had been close to death by starvation; its attack on the men\nprobably had been sparked by sheer desperation. A starving carnivore\nin a land lacking the normal sounds of small birds and animal life, in\na valley used as a trap.\n\n\"No way out and no food.\" Vye fitted one thought to another out loud.\n\n\"Yes. Pin the enemy up, let them finish off one another.\"\n\n\"But why?\" Vye demanded.\n\n\"Least trouble that way.\"\n\n\"There are plenty of water-cats down on the plains. All of them\ncouldn't be herded up here to finish each other off; it would take\nyears--centuries.\"\n\n\"This one's capture may have been only incidental, or done for the\npurpose of keeping some type of machinery in working order,\" Hume\nreplied. \"I don't believe this was arranged just to dispose of\nwater-cats.\"\n\n\"Suppose this was started a long time ago, and those who did it are\ngone, so now it goes on working without any real intelligence behind\nit. That could be the answer, couldn't it?\"\n\n\"Some process triggers into action when a ship sets down on this\nportion of Jumala, maybe when one planet's under certain conditions\nonly? Yes, that makes sense. Only why wasn't the first Patrol explorer\nflaming in here caught? And the survey team--we were here for months,\ncataloguing, mapping, not a whisper of any such trouble.\"\n\n\"That dead man--he's been here a long time. And when did the Largo\nDrift disappear?\"\n\n\"Five--six years ago. But I can't give you any answers. I have none.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt began as a low hum, hardly to be distinguished from the distant\nhowling of the wind. Then it slid up scale until the thin wail became\nan ululating scream torturing the ears, dragging out of hiding those\nfears of a man confronting the unknown in the dark.\n\nHume tugged at Vye, drew the other by force back into the brush.\nScratched, laced raw by the whip of branches, they stood in a small\nhollow with the drift of leaves high about their ankles. And the\nHunter pulled into place the portions of growth they had dislodged in\ntheir passage into the thicket's heart. Through gaps they could see\nthe opening where lay the body of the water-cat.\n\nThe wail was cut off short, that cessation in itself a warning. Vye's\nbody, touching earth with knee and hand as he crouched, picked up a\nvibration. Whatever came towards them walked heavily.\n\nDid the smell of death draw it now? Or had it trailed them from the\nclosed gate? Hume's breath hissed lightly between his teeth. He was\nsighting the ray tube through a leaf gap.\n\nA snuffling, heavier than a man's panting. A vast blot, which was\nneither clearly paw nor hand, swept aside leaves and branches on the\nother side of the small clearing, tearing them casually from the\nshrubs.\n\nWhat shuffled into the open might be a cousin of the blue beasts. But\nwhere they had given only an impression of brutal menace, this was\nsavagery incarnate. Taller than Hume, but hunched forward in its\nneckless outline, the thing was a monster. And over the round of the\nlower jaw, tusks protruded in ugly promise.\n\nBeing carnivorous and hungry, it scooped up the body of the water-cat\nand fed without any prolonged ceremony. Vye, remembering the crushed\nspine of the human skeleton, was sickened.\n\nDone, it reared on hind feet once again, the pear-shaped head swung in\ntheir direction. Vye was half certain he had seen that tube-nose\nexpand to test the air and scent them.\n\nHume pressed the button of the ray tube. That soundless spear of death\nstruck in midsection of that barrel body. The thing howled, threw\nitself in a mad forward rush at their bush. Hume snapped a second\nblast at the head, and the fuzz covering it blackened.\n\nMissing them by a precious foot, the creature crashed straight on\nthrough the thicket, coming to its knees, writhing in a rising chorus\nof howls. The men broke out of cover, raced into the open where they\ntook refuge behind a chimney of rock half detached from the parent\ncliff. Down the slope the bushes were still wildly agitated.\n\n\"What was that?\" Vye got out between sobbing breaths.\n\n\"Maybe a guardian, or a patrol stationed to dispose of any catch.\nProbably not alone, either.\" Hume fingered his ray tube. \"And I am\ndown to one full charge--just one.\"\n\nVye turned the knife he held around in his fingers, tried to imagine\nhow one could face up to one of those tusked monsters with only this\nfor a weapon. But if that thing had companions, none were coming in\nanswer to its dying wails. And after it had been quiet for a while\nHume motioned them out of hiding.\n\n\"From now on we'll keep to the open, better see trouble like that\nbefore it arrives. And I want to find a place to hole up for the\nnight.\"\n\nThey trailed along the steep upper slope and in time found a place\nwhere a now dried stream had once formed a falls. The empty\nwatercourse provided an overhang, not quite a cave, but shelter.\nGathering brush and stones, they made a barricade and settled behind\nit to eat sparingly of their rations.\n\n\"Water--a whole lake of it down there. The worst of it is that a water\nsupply in a dry country is just where hunters congregate. That lake's\nentirely walled in by woodland and provides cover for a thousand\nambushes.\"\n\n\"We might find a way out before our water bulbs fail,\" Vye offered.\n\nHume did not answer directly. \"A man can live for quite a while on\nvery thin rations, and we have tablets from the flitter emergency\nsupplies. But he can't live long without water. We have two bulbs.\nWith stretching that is enough for two days--maybe three.\"\n\n\"We ought to get completely around the cliffs in another day.\"\n\n\"And if we do find a way out, which I doubt, we're still going to need\nwater for the trek out. It's right down there waiting until our need\nis greater than either our fear or our cunning.\"\n\nVye moved impatiently, his blanket-clad shoulders scraping the rock at\ntheir backs. \"You don't think we have a chance!\"\n\n\"We aren't dead. And as long as a man is breathing, and on his feet,\nwith all his wits in his skull, he always has a chance. I've blasted\noff-world with odds stacked high on the other side of the board.\" He\nflexed that plasta-flesh hand which was so nearly human and yet not by\nthe fraction which had changed the course of his life. \"I've lived on\nthe edge of the big blackout for a long time now--after a while you\ncan get used to anything.\"\n\n\"One thing I would like--to get at the one who set this trap,\"\ncommented Vye.\n\nHume laughed with dry humor. \"After me, boy, after me. But I think we\nmight have to wait a long time for that meeting.\"\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nVye crawled weakly from the area of a rock outcrop. The sun, reflected\nfrom the cliff side, was a lash of fire across his emaciated body. His\nswollen tongue moved a pebble back and forth in his dry mouth. He\nstared dimly down the slope to that beckoning platter of water open\nunder the sun, rimmed with the deadly woodland.\n\nWhat had happened? They had gone to sleep that first night under the\nledge of the dried waterfall. And all of the next day was only a haze\nto him now. They must have moved on, though he could remember nothing,\nsave Hume's odd behavior--dull-eyed silence while stumbling on as a\nbrainless servio-robot, incoherent speech wherein all the words came\nfast, running together unintelligibly. And for himself--patches of\nblackout.\n\nAt some time they had come to the cave and Hume had collapsed, not\nrousing in answer to any of Vye's struggles to awaken him. How long\nthey had been there Vye could not tell now. He had the fear of being\nleft alone in this place. With water perhaps Hume could be returned to\nconsciousness, but that was all gone.\n\nVye believed he could scent the lake, that every breeze up slope\nbrought its compelling enticement. Just in case Hume might awake to a\nstate of semi-consciousness and wander off, Vye tethered him with\nblanket bonds.\n\nVye fingered Hume's knife, which had been painstakingly lashed to a\ntrimmed shaft of wood. Since he had emerged from that clouding of mind\nwhich still gripped the Hunter, he had done what he could to prepare\nfor another attack from any roving beast. And he also had Hume's ray\ntube--its single charge to be used only in dire need.\n\nWater! His cracked lips moved, ejected the pebble. Their four empty\nwater bulbs were in the front of his blanket tunic, pressing against\nhis ribs. It was now--or die, because soon he would be too weak to\nmake the attempt at all. He darted for the first stand of bush\ndownhill.\n\nAs the brooding silence of the valley continued, he reached the edge\nof the wood unhindered, intent on his mission with a concentration\nwhich shut out everything save his need and the manner of satisfying\nit.\n\nHe squatted in the bush, eyeing the length of woodland ahead. Then he\ntried the only action he had been able to think out. That beast Hume\nhad killed had been too heavy to swing up in trees. But Vye's own\nweight now did not prohibit that form of travel.\n\nWith spear and ray tube firmly attached to him, Vye climbed into the\nfirst tree. A slim chance--but his only defense against a possible\nambush. A wild outward swing brought him, heart-thudding, to the next\nset of limbs. Then he had a piece of luck, a looped vine tied together\na whole group of branches from one treetop to the next.\n\nHand grips, balance, sometimes a walk along a branch--he threaded\ntowards the lake. Then he came to a gap. With hands laced into\ntendrils, Vye hunched to look down on a beaten ribbon of gray earth--a\ntrail well used by the evidence of its pounded surface.\n\nThat area had to be crossed on foot, but his passage through the brush\nbelow would leave traces. Only--there was no other way. Vye checked\nthe lashings of his weapons again before leaping. Almost in the same\ninstant his sandals hit the packed earth he was running. His palms\nskinned raw on rough bark as he somehow scrambled aloft once more.\n\nNo more vines, but broad limbs shooting well out. He dropped from one\nto another-stopped for breath--listened.\n\nThe dark gloom of the wood was broken by sunlight. He was at the final\nring of trees. To get to the water he must descend again. A dead trunk\nextended over the water. If he could run out on that and lower the\nbulb, it could work.\n\nEerie silence. No flying things, no tree dwelling reptiles or animals,\nno disturbance of any water creature on the unruffled surface of the\nlake. Yet the sensation of life, inimical life, lurking in the depths\nof the wood, under the water, bore in upon him.\n\nVye made the light leap to the bole of the dead tree, balanced out on\nit over the water, moving slowly as the trunk settled a little under\nhis weight. He hunkered down, brought out the first bulb tied fast to\na blanket string.\n\nThe water of the river had been brown, opaque. But here the liquid was\nnot so cloudy. He could see snags of dead branches below its surface.\n\nAnd something else!\n\nDown in those turgid depths he made out a straight ridge running with\na trueness of line which could not be nature's unassisted product.\nThat ridge joined another in a squared corner. He leaned over,\nstrained his eyes to follow through the murk the farther extent of\nthose two ridges. Looked along both pointed protuberances aimed at the\nsurfaces of the lake, like fangs in an open jaw. Down there was\nsomething--something artificially fashioned which might be the answer\nto all their questions. But to venture into the lake himself--he could\nnot do it! If he could bring the Out-Hunter to his senses the other\nmight find the solution to this puzzle.\n\nVye filled his bulbs, working speedily, but still studying what he\ncould see of the strange erection under the lake. He thought it was\ncuriously free of silt, and its color, as far as he could distinguish,\nallowing for the dark hue of the water, was light gray--perhaps even\nwhite. He lowered his last bulb.\n\nDown in the bleached forest of dead branches, well to one side of the\nmysterious walls, there was movement, a slow rolling of a shadow so\nhidden by a stirring of bottom mud that Vye could not make out its\ntrue form. But it was rising to the bulb.\n\nVye hated to lose a single precious drop. Once he might have the luck\nto make this journey unmolested, a second time the odds could be too\nhigh.\n\nA flash--the slowly rising shadow was transformed into a whizzing\nspear of attack. Vye snapped the bulb out of the water just as a\nnightmarish, armored head arose on a whiplash of coiled, scaled neck,\nand a blunt nose thudded against the tree trunk with a hollow boom.\nVye clung to his perch as the thing flopped back into deeper water\nfrom a froth of beaten foam, leaving a patch of odorous scum and slime\nto bracelet the waterlogged wood.\n\nHe ran for the shelter of the trees to get away. This time there was\nno rear, no thump of feet in warning. Out of the ground itself, or so\nit seemed to Vye's startled terror, reared one of the tusked beasts.\nTo reach his tree and its dubious safety he had to wind past that\nchimera. And the creature waited with a semblance of ease for him to\ncome to it.\n\nVye brought around his spear. The length of the haft might afford him\na fighting chance if he could send the point home in some vulnerable\nspot. Yet he knew that the beasts were hard to kill.\n\nThe mouth opened in a wide grin of menace. Vye noted a telltale\ntightening of shoulder muscles. It was going to rush for him now with\nthose clawed forepaws out to rip.\n\nTo wait was to court disaster. Vye shouted, his battle cry piercing\nthe silence of the lake and wood. He sprang, aiming the spear point at\nthe beast's protuberant belly, and then swerved to the side as the\nknife bit home, raking his weapon to open a gaping wound.\n\nThe spear was jerked from Vye's hold as both those taloned paws closed\non it. Then the creature pulled it free, snapped the haft in two. Vye\nfired a short blast from the ray tube before it could turn on him, saw\nfur-fuzz afire, as he ran for the tree.\n\nBeneath its branches he looked back. The beast was pawing at the\nburning fur on its head, and he had perhaps a second or two. He jumped\nand his fingers caught on the low hanging branch, then he made a\nsuperhuman effort, was up out of the path of the thing which rushed\nblindly for the tree, shrieking in frenzied complaint.\n\nThe huge body crashed against the trunk with force which nearly shook\nVye from his hold. As the giant forepaws belabored the wood, strove to\nlift the body from the ground, Vye worked his way out on another\nbranch. In the end it was the shaking of that limb under him which\naided his swing to the next tree. And from there he traveled\nrecklessly, intent only on getting out of the woods as fast as he\ncould.\n\nBy the noise the beast was still assaulting the tree, and Vye marveled\nat its vitality, for the belly wound would long ago have killed any\ncreature he knew. Whether it could trace his flight aloft, or whether\nits howls would bring more of its kind, he could not guess, but every\nsecond he could gain was all important now.\n\nAt the gap over the trail he hesitated. That path ran in the direction\nof the open, and to go on foot meant the possibility of greater speed.\nVye slipped from the bough, hit the ground, and ran. His ragged\nlungsful of air came in great gasps and he doubted if he could take\nthe exertion of more tree travel now. He raced down the path.\n\nThose mewling cries were louder, he was sure of it. Now he heard the\nthump of the beast's blundering pursuit behind him. But its bulk and\nhurts slowed it. In the open he could find cover behind a rock, use\nthe ray again.\n\nThe trees began to thin. Vye summoned power for a last burst of speed,\ncame out of the shadow of the wood as might a dart expelled from a\nneedler. Before him, up slope, was the closed door of the valley. And\nmoving in from the left was another of the blue beasts.\n\nHe could not retreat to the trees. But the newcomer was moving with\nthe same ponderous self-confidence its fellow had shown earlier. Vye\ndodged right, headed for the rocks by the gap. As he pulled himself\ninto that temporary fortification, the wounded beast dragged out of\nthe woods below. He thought it was blind, yet some instinct drove it\nafter him.\n\nShaking from fatigue, Vye steadied his forearm on the top of the rock,\nbrought up the ray tube. Less than two yards away now was the\ndeceptively open mouth of the gap. If he threw himself at that, would\nthe elasticity of the unseen curtain hurl him back into the claws of\nthe enemy?\n\nHe fired his blast at the head of the unwounded beast. It screeched,\nthrew out its arms, and one of those paws struck against its wounded\nfellow. With a cry, that one flung itself at its companion in the\nhunt, and they tangled in a body-to-body battle terrible in its utter\nferocity. Vye edged along the cliff determined to reach the cave and\nHume. And the two blue things seemed intent on finishing each other\noff.\n\nThe one from the wood was done, the fangs of the other ripping out its\nthroat. Tearing viciously the victor made sure of its kill, then its\nseared head came up, swung about to face Vye. He guessed it was aware\nof his movements whether it could see or not.\n\nBut he was not prepared for the speed of its attacking lunge.\nHeretofore the creatures had given the impression of brute strength\nrather than agility. And he had been almost fatally deceived. He\njumped backwards, knowing he must elude that attack, for he could not\nsurvive hand-to-hand combat with the alien thing.\n\nThere was a moment of dazed disorientation, a weird sensation of\nfalling through unstable space in which there had never been and never\nwould be firm footing again. He was rolling across rock--outside the\ncurtain of the gap.\n\nHe sat up, the feeling of being adrift in unmeasurable nothingness\nmaking him sick, to watch mistily as the blue beast came to a halt.\nWhimpering it turned, but before it reached the level of the woods, it\nsagged to its knees, fell face forward and was still, a destructive\nmachine no longer controlled by life.\n\nVye tried to understand what had happened. He had somehow broken\nthrough that barrier which made the valley a prison. For a moment all\nthat mattered was his freedom. Then he looked apprehensively behind\nhim along the road to the open, more than half expecting to see a\ngathering of the globes, or of the less impressive lowland beasts that\nacted as herders. But there was nothing.\n\nFreedom! He dragged himself to his feet. Free to go! He slipped Hume's\nray tube back into his belt. Hume was still in the valley!\n\nVye rubbed his shaking hands across his face. Through the barrier and\nfree--but Hume was back there, without a weapon, defenseless against\nany questing beast able to nose him out. Sickly, without water and\nprotection, he was a dead man even while he still breathed.\n\nKeeping one hand against the wall of the gap in support, Vye started\nto walk, not out of the gap towards the distant lowlands, but back\ninto the valley, forcing himself to that by his will alone and\nscreaming inside against such suicidal folly. He put out his hand\ntentatively when he reached the two points of rock where that curtain\nhad hung. There was no obstruction--the barrier was down! He must get\nback to Hume.\n\nStill keeping his wall hold, Vye lurched through the gate, was once\nmore in the valley. He stood swaying, listening. But once again there\nwas silence, not even the wind moved through trees or bushes. Placing\none foot carefully before the other he went on towards Hume's cave.\nThe haze which had clouded his thinking processes since that first\nmorning's awakening in this bowl was gone now. Except for the physical\nweakness that weighted his body, he felt once more entirely alive and\nalert.\n\nWriggling in the cave's entrance was the Hunter. He had freed the\nbonds Vye had put on his legs, but his hands were still tied. His\nface, grimy, sweat-covered, was turned up to the sunlight, and his\neyes were again bright with reason.\n\nVye found the strength to run the last few feet between them. He was\nfumbling with those ties about Hume's wrists as he blurted out the\nnews. The barrier was out--they could go.\n\nThen he was bringing one of those precious bulbs, raising it to Hume's\neager mouth, squeezing a portion of its contents between the man's\ncracked and bleeding lips.\n\nSomehow they made that trip back to the valley gate. When they saw\ntheir goal, Hume broke from Vye's hold, tottered forward with a cry\nnot far removed from a sob. He rebounded to slip full length to the\nground and lie there. Sobbing dryly, his gaunt face, eyes closed,\nturned up to the sky. The trap had snapped shut once again.\n\n\"Why--why?\" Vye found he was repeating the same words over and over,\nhis gaze blank, unfocussed, yet turned to the woods of the lake.\n\n\"Tell me what happened again.\"\n\nVye's head came around. Hume had pulled himself up so that his\nshoulders rested against the rock wall. His plasta-hand was out-flung,\nslipping up and down what seemed empty air, but which was the barrier\nagainst freedom. And now his eyes seemed entirely sane.\n\nSlowly, hesitating between words, Vye went over the full account of\nhis visit to the lake, his retreat before the beasts, his fortunate\nstumble through the gap.\n\n\"But you came back.\"\n\nVye flushed. He was not going to try to explain that. Instead he said:\n\n\"If it went away once, it can again.\"\n\nHume did not press the subject of his return. Rather he fastened upon\nthe end of that action with the wounded beast, made Vye go through it\nverbally a third time.\n\n\"There is just this,\" he said when the other was done. \"When you fell\nyou were not thinking of the barrier at all--and your wits were\nworking again. You had come out of the daze we both had.\"\n\nVye tried to remember, decided that the Hunter was correct. He had\nbeen trying to elude the charge of the beast, only, fear and that\ndesperate desire had occupied his mind at that moment. But what did\nthat signify?\n\nTo test just what he did not know, he crawled now to Hume's side, put\nup his own hand to the space where the plasta-flesh palm slid back and\nforth on nothingness. But he almost fell on his face, forward into the\ngap. Where he had been expecting the resistance of the unseen curtain\nthere had been nothing at all! He turned to Hume with the expression\nof a man who had been stunned by an unexpected blow.\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n\"It is open for you!\" Hume broke the quiet first. His eyes were very\nbleak in his bony face.\n\nVye stood up, took one step and was on the other side of the curtain\nwhere Hume's hand still found substance. He came back with the same\nlack of hindrance. Yes, to him there was no longer a barrier. But\nwhy--why him when Hume was still a prisoner?\n\nThe Hunter raised his head so his eyes could meet Vye's with the\nauthority of an order. \"Go, get away while you can!\"\n\nInstead Vye dropped down beside the other. \"Why?\" he asked baldly. And\nthen the most obvious of all answers came.\n\nHe glanced at Hume. The Hunter's head lolled back against the rock\nwhich supported him, his eyes were closed now, and he had the look of\na man who had been driven to the edge of endurance and was now willing\nto relinquish his grip and let go.\n\nDeliberately Vye brought up his right hand, balled his fingers into a\nfist. And just as deliberately he struck home, square on the point of\nthat defenseless chin. Hume sagged, would have slipped down the\nsurface of the rock had Vye's hands not caught in his armpits.\n\nSince he had not the strength left to get to his feet with such a\nburden, Vye crawled, dragging the inert body of the Hunter with him.\nAnd this time, as he had hoped, there was no resistance at the gap.\nUnconscious, Hume was able to cross the barrier. Vye stretched him as\ncomfortably flat as he could, used a portion of their water on his\nface until he moaned, muttered, and raised his hand feebly to his\nhead.\n\nThen those gray eyes opened, focussed on Vye.\n\n\"What--\"\n\n\"We're both through now, both of us!\" The younger man saw Hume glance\naround him with waking belief.\n\n\"But how--?\"\n\n\"I knocked you out, that's how,\" Vye returned.\n\n\"Knocked me out? I crossed when I was unconscious!\" Hume's voice\nsteadied, strengthened. \"Let me see!\" He rolled over on his side,\nthrew out his arm, and this time the hand found no wall. For him, too,\nthe barrier was gone.\n\n\"Once through, you are free,\" he added wonderingly. \"Maybe they never\nforesaw any escapes.\" He struggled up, sitting with his hands hanging\nloosely between his knees.\n\nVye turned his head, looked down the trail. The length of distance\nlying between them and the safari camp now faced them with a new\nproblem. Neither of them could make that trek on foot.\n\n\"We're out, but we aren't back--yet,\" Hume echoed his thought.\n\n\"I was wondering, if _this_ door is open--\" Vye began.\n\n\"The flitter!\" Again Hume's mind matched his. \"Yes, if those globes\naren't hanging around just waiting for us to try.\"\n\n\"They might act only to get us here, not to keep us once we're in.\"\nThat might be wishful thinking, they wouldn't know until they tried to\nprove it.\n\n\"Give me a hand.\" Hume held out his own, let Vye pull him to his feet.\nWeak as he was, he was clear-eyed, plainly clear-headed once more.\n\"Let's go!\"\n\nTogether they went back through the gap, then tested the absence of\nthe barrier once more, to make sure. Hume laughed. \"At least the front\ndoor remains open, even if we find the back one closed.\"\n\nVye left him sitting by that entrance while he made a quick trip to\nthe cave to pick up the small pack of supplies left them. When he\nreturned they crammed tablets into their mouths, drank feverishly of\nthe lake water, and, with the stimulation of the new energy, set off\nalong the cliff face.\n\n\"This wall in the lake,\" Hume asked suddenly, \"you are sure it is\nartificial?\"\n\n\"Runs too straight to be anything else, and those projections are\nevenly spaced. I don't see how it could be natural.\"\n\n\"We'll have to be sure.\"\n\nVye thought of that attacking water creature. \"No diving in there,\" he\nprotested. Hume smiled, a stretch of skin far too tight over his jaw\nnow.\n\n\"Not us, at least not us now,\" he agreed. \"But the Guild will send\nanother survey.\"\n\n\"What could be the reason for all this?\" Vye helped his companion over\nthe loose debris of a cliff slide.\n\n\"Information.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Someone--or something--picked our brains while we were out of our\nheads. Or--\" Hume paused suddenly, looked directly at Vye. \"I have a\nvague feeling that you were able to keep going a lot better than I\nwas. That so?\"\n\n\"Some of the time,\" Vye admitted.\n\n\"That checks. Part of me knew what was going on, but was helpless\nwhile that other thing,\" his smile of moments earlier was wiped away,\nthere was a chill edge in his voice, \"picked over my brains, sorted\nout what it wanted.\"\n\nVye shook his head. \"I didn't feel that way. Just thick-headed--as if\nI were sleep walking and yet awake.\"\n\n\"So it took me over, but didn't go all the way with you. Why? Another\nquestion for our list.\"\n\n\"Maybe--maybe Wass' techs fixed it so I couldn't be brain-picked, as\nyou call it,\" Vye offered.\n\nHume nodded. \"Could be--would well be. Come on.\" He pressed the pace\nnow.\n\nVye turned to look down the slope suspiciously. Had Hume another\nwarning of menace out of the wood? He could sight no movement there.\nAnd from this distance the lake was a topaz sheet of calm which could\nhide anything. Hume was already several paces ahead, scrambling as if\nthe valley monsters were again on their track.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" Vye demanded, as he caught up.\n\n\"Night coming.\" Which was true. Then Hume added, \"If we can reach the\nflitter before sunset, we'll have a chance to fly over the lake down\nthere, to make a taping of it before we go.\"\n\nThe energy of the tablets strengthened them so that by the time they\nreached the crevice door they were moving with their former agility.\nFor a single second Hume hesitated before that slit, almost as if he\nfeared the test he must make. Then he stepped forward and this time\ninto freedom.\n\nThey reached the ledge where the flitter perched just as they had seen\nit last. How long ago that had been they could not have told, but they\nsuspected that days of haze hung in between. Vye searched the sky. No\nglobes winking there--just the flyer alone.\n\nHe took his old seat behind the pilot, watched Hume test the relays\nand responses in the quick run down of a man who has done this chore\nmany times before. But the other gave a little sigh of relief when he\nfinished.\n\n\"She's all right, we can lift.\"\n\nAgain they both looked aloft, half fearing to see those malignant\nherders wink into being to forbid flight. But the sky was as serenely\nclear of even a drifting cloud as they could hope. Hume pressed a\nbutton and they arose vertically with an even progress totally unlike\nthe leap which had taken them out of Wass' camp.\n\nWell above the cliff wall they hovered, and were able to see below the\nround bowl of the valley prison. Hume touched controls, the flitter\ndescended slowly just above the center of the lake. And from this\nposition they were able to sight the other peculiarity of that body of\nwater, that it was perfectly oval in shape, far too perfect to be an\nundeveloped product of nature. Hume took a round disk from his\nequipment belt, fitted it carefully into a slot on the control board\nand pressed the button below. Then he sent the flitter in a weaving\nzigzag course well above the surface of the water, so that eventually\nthe flyer passed over every foot of its surface.\n\nAnd from above, in spite of the turgid quality of the liquid, they\ncould see what did rest on the bottom of that oval. The wall with its\nsharp corner which Vye had noted from shore level was only part of a\nwater covered erection. It made a design when seen from overhead, a\nsix-pointed star surrounding an oval and in the midst of that oval a\nblack blot which they could not identify.\n\nHume brought the flitter over in one last sweep. \"That's it. We have a\nfull taping.\"\n\n\"What do you think it is?\"\n\n\"A device set there by an intelligent being, and set a long time ago.\nThis valley wasn't arranged over night, six months ago--or even a year\nago. We'll have to let the experts tell us when and for what reason.\nNow, let's head for home!\"\n\nHe brought the flitter up and over the valley wall, flying southwest\nso that they passed over the gap which was the main entrance to the\ntrap. And now he tried the com unit, endeavoring to pick up a signal\non which they could beam in for a safe ride.\n\n\"That's odd.\" Under Hume's control the direction finder passed back\nand forth without bringing any answering code click from the mike. \"We\nmay be too far in the mountains to pick up the beam. I wonder....\" He\nswept the needle in another direction, slightly to the left.\n\nA crackle spat from the mike. Vye could not read code but the very\nfury and intensity of that sound suggested panic--even terror.\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\nHume spoke without looking away from the control board. \"Alarm.\"\n\n\"From the safari?\"\n\n\"No. Wass.\" For a long second Hume sat very still, his fingers quiet.\nThe flitter was on the automatic course, taking them out of the\nmountains, and Vye thought that their air speed was such they were\nalready well removed from that sinister valley.\n\nHume made a slight adjustment to a dial, and the flitter banked,\ncoming around on another course. Once more he spun the finder of the\ncom. This time he was answered with a series of well-spaced clicks\nwhich lacked the urgency of that other call. Hume listened until the\ncode rattled into silence again.\n\n\"They're all right at the safari camp.\"\n\n\"But Wass is in trouble. So what does that matter?\" Vye wanted to\nknow.\n\n\"It matters this much.\" Hume spoke slowly as if he must convince\nhimself as well as Vye. \"I'm the Guild man on Jumala, and the Guild\nman is responsible for all civs.\"\n\n\"You can't call him your client!\"\n\nHume shook his head. \"No, he's no client. But he's human.\"\n\nIt narrowed down to that when a man was on the frontier worlds--humans\nstood together. Vye wanted to deny it, but his own emotions, as well\nas the centuries of age-old tradition, argued him down. Wass was a\nVeep, one of the criminal parasites dabbling in human misery along\nmore than one solar lane. But he was also human and, as one of their\nown species, had his claim on them.\n\nVye watched Hume take over the controls, felt the flitter answer\nanother change of course, then heard the frantic yammer of the\ndistress call as they leveled off to ride its beam in to the hidden\ncamp.\n\n\"Automatic.\" Hume had turned down the volume of the receiver so that\nthe clicks in the mike no longer were so strident. \"Set on maximum and\nleft that way.\"\n\n\"They had a force barrier around the camp and they knew about the\nglobes and the watchers.\" Vye tried to imagine what had happened in\nthat woods clearing.\n\n\"The barrier might have shorted. And without the flitter they would\nhave been pinned.\"\n\n\"Could have taken off in the spacer.\"\n\n\"Wass doesn't have the reputation of letting any project get out of\nhis hands.\"\n\nVye remembered. \"Oh--your billion credit deal.\"\n\nTo his surprise Hume laughed. \"Seems all very far and out of orbit\nnow, doesn't it, Lansor? Yes, our billion credit deal--but that was\nthought out before we knew there were more players around the table\nthan we counted. I wonder....\"\n\nBut what he wondered he did not put into words and a moment later he\nadded over his shoulder, \"Better try to get some rest, boy. We've some\ntime to a set-down.\"\n\nVye did sleep, deeply, dreamlessly. And he roused after a gentle\nshaking to see a beam of light in the sky ahead, though around them\nwas the solid darkness of night.\n\n\"That's a warning,\" Hume explained. \"And I can't raise any reply from\nthe camp except a repeat of the distress call. If there is anyone\nthere now, he can't or won't answer.\"\n\nAgainst that column of light they could make out the sky-pointed taper\nof the spacer and the auto-pilot landed them beside that ship in the\nmiddle of an area well lighted by the steady shaft of light from the\ntripod standing where the atom lamp had been on the night they had\nmade their escape from camp.\n\nClimbing stiffly from the small flyer they advanced with caution. A\nvery few minutes later Hume slid his ray tube back into its belt loop.\n\n\"Unless they've holed up in the spacer--and I can't see why they'd do\nthat--this camp's deserted. And they haven't taken any equipment with\nthem except maybe a few items they could back-pack.\"\n\nThe ship proved as empty of life as the campsite. A wall seat pulled\nout too hastily so that it was jammed awry, the com cabin suggested\nthat the leave-taking, when and for what reason, had been a matter of\nsome emergency. Hume did not touch the tape set to keep on\nbroadcasting the call for assistance.\n\n\"What now?\" Vye wanted to know as they completed the search.\n\n\"The safari camp first--and a call for the Patrol.\"\n\n\"Look here,\" Vye set down the ration container he had found, was\nemptying it with vast satisfaction of one who had been too long on\ntablets, \"if you beam the Patrol you'll have to talk, won't you?\"\n\nHume went on fitting new charges into his ray tube. \"The Patrol has to\nhave a full report. There's no way of bypassing that. Yes, we'll have\nto give all the story. You needn't worry.\" He snapped closed the load\nchamber. \"I can clear you all the way. You're the victim, remember.\"\n\n\"I wasn't thinking about that.\"\n\n\"Boy.\" Hume tossed the tube up in the air, caught it in his\nplasta-hand. \"I went into this deal with my eyes wide open--why\ndoesn't matter very much now. In fact,\" he stared beyond Vye out into\nthe empty, lighted camp, \"I've begun to wonder about a lot of\nthings--maybe too late. No--we'll call the Patrol and we'll do it not\nbecause it is Wass and his men out there, but because we're human and\nthey're human, and there's a nasty set-up here which has already\nsucked in other humans for its own purposes.\"\n\nThe skeleton in the valley! And how very close they had been\nthemselves to joining that unknown in his permanent residence.\n\n\"So now we make time--back to the safari camp. Get our message off to\nthe Patrol and then we'll try to trace Wass and see what we can do.\nJumala is off a regular route. The Patrol won't be here tomorrow at\nsunrise, no matter how much we wish a scouter would planet then.\"\n\nVye was quiet as he stowed in the flitter again. As Hume had said,\nevents moved fast. A little while ago he had wanted to settle with\nthis Out-Hunter, wring out of him not only an explanation for his\nbeing here, but claim satisfaction for the humiliation of being moved\nabout to suit some others' purposes. Now he was willing to defeat\nWass, bring in the Patrol, go up against whatever hid in that lake up\nthere, providing Hume was not the loser. He tried to think why that\nwas so and could not, he only knew it was the truth.\n\nThey were both silent as they took off from Wass' deserted camp, sped\naway over the black blot of the woodland towards the safari\nheadquarters on the plains. There were stars above again but no\nglobes. Just as they had won their freedom from the valley, so they\nmoved without escort on the plains.\n\nBut the lights were there--not impinging on the flitter, or patrolling\nalong its line of flight. No, they hung in a glowing cluster ahead\nwhen in the dawn the flitter shot away from the woods, headed for the\nlandmark of the safari camp. A crown of lights circled over the camp\nsite, as if those below were in a state of siege.\n\nHume aimed straight for them and this time the bobbing circle split\nwide open, broke to left and right. Vye looked below. Though the\ngrayness of the morning was still hardly more than dusk he could not\nmiss those humps spaced at intervals on the land, just beyond the\nunseen line of the force barrier. The lights above, the beasts below,\nthe safari camp was under guard.\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n\"There is only one way they could be moving--toward the mountains.\"\nHume stood in the open space among the bubble tents, facing him the\nfour men of the camp, the three civs and Rovald. \"You say it's been\nseven days, planet time, since I left here. They may have been five\ndays on that trail. If possible we have to stop them before they reach\nthat valley.\"\n\n\"A fantastic story.\" Chambriss wore the affronted expression of a man\nwho expected no interference with his own concerns. Then catching\nHume's eye he added, \"Not that we doubt you, Hunter. We have the\nevidence in those dumb brutes waiting out there. However, by your own\nstory, this Wass is an outside-the-law Veep, on this planet secretly\nfor criminal purposes. Surely there is no reason for us to risk our\nsafety in his behalf. Are you certain he is in any danger at all? You\nand this young man here have, by your testimony, been into the\nenemies' territory and have been able to get out again.\"\n\n\"Through a series of fortunate chances which might never occur again.\"\nHume was patient, too patient, Rovald seemed to think. His hand moved,\nhe was holding a ray tube so that a simple movement of the wrist could\nsend a crisping blast across all the rest of the party.\n\n\"I say, stop this yapping and get out there and pick up the Veep!\"\n\n\"I intend to--after I call the Patrol.\"\n\nRovald's tube was now aimed directly at Hume. \"No Patrol!\" he\nordered.\n\n\"This wrangling has gone far enough.\" It was Yactisi who spoke with an\nauthority which startled them all. And as their attention swung to\nhim, he was already in action.\n\nRovald cried out, the weapon spun from his fingers, fingers which were\nslowly reddening. Yactisi nodded with satisfaction and he held his\nelecto pole ready for a second attack. Vye scooped up the tube which\nhad whirled across the ground to strike against his borrowed boot.\n\n\"I'll set the call for the Patrol, then I'll try to locate Wass,\" Hume\nstated.\n\n\"Sensible procedure,\" Yactisi approved in his dry voice. \"You believe\nthat you are now immune to whatever force this alien installation\ncontrols?\"\n\n\"It would seem so.\"\n\n\"Then, of course, you must go.\"\n\n\"Why?\" Chambriss countered for the second time. \"Suppose he isn't so\nimmune after all? Suppose he gets out there and is captured again?\nHe's our pilot--do you want to be planet bound _here_?\n\n\"This man is also a pilot.\" Starns indicated Rovald, who was nursing\nhis numb hand.\n\n\"Since he, too, is one of these criminals, he's not to be trusted!\"\nChambriss shot back. \"Hunter, I demand that you take us off planet at\nonce! And it is only fair to inform you that I also intend to prefer\ncharges against you and against the Guild. Empty world! Just how empty\nhave we found this world?\"\n\n\"But, Gentlehomo,\" Starns showed no signs of any emotion but eager\ncuriosity, \"to be here at this time is a privilege we could not hope\nto equal except by good fortune! The T-Casts will be avid for our\nstories.\"\n\nWhat had that to do with the matter, puzzled Vye. But he saw Starns'\nreminder produce a quick change in Chambriss.\n\n\"The T-Casts,\" he repeated, his expression of anger smoothing away.\n\"Yes, of course, this is, in a manner of speaking, a truly historic\noccasion. We are in a unique position!\"\n\nHad Yactisi smiled? That change of lip line had been so slight Vye\ncould not call it a smile. But Starns appeared to have found the right\nway to handle Chambriss. And it was the same little man who offered\nhis services in another way when he said, diffidently to Hume:\n\n\"I have some experience with coms, Hunter. Do you wish me to send your\nmessage and take over the unit until you return? I gather,\" he added\nwith a certain delicacy, \"that it will not be expedient for your\ngearman to engage in that duty now.\"\n\nSo it was that Starns was installed in the com cabin of the spacer,\nsending out the request for Patrol aid, while Rovald was locked in the\nstorage compartment of the same ship, pending arrival of those same\nauthorities. As Hume sorted out supplies and Vye loaded them into the\nwaiting flitter, Yactisi approached the Hunter.\n\n\"You have a definite plan of search?\"\n\n\"Just to cast north from their camp. If they've been gone long enough\nto hit the foothills we may be able to sight them climbing. Otherwise,\nwe'll go all the way up to the valley, wait for them there.\"\n\n\"You don't believe that they will be released after they have\nbeen--processed?\"\n\nHume shook his head. \"I don't think we would have been free,\nGentlehomo, if it hadn't been for a series of fortunate accidents.\"\n\n\"Yes, though you didn't give us many details about that, Hunter.\"\n\nHume put down the needler he had been charging. He studied Yactisi\nacross that weapon.\n\n\"Who are you?\" His voice was soft but carried a snap.\n\nFor the first time Vye saw the tall, lean civ really smile.\n\n\"A man of many interests, Hunter--shall we let it go at that for the\npresent? Though I assure you that Wass is not one of them in the way\nyou might believe.\"\n\nGray eyes met brown, held so straightly. Then Hume spoke. \"I believe\nyou. But I have told you the truth.\"\n\n\"I have never doubted that--only the amount of it. There must be more\ntalking later on--you understand that?\"\n\n\"I never thought otherwise.\" Hume set the needler inside the flitter.\nThe civ smiled again, this time including Vye in that evidence of good\nwill before he walked away.\n\nHume made no comment. \"That does it,\" he told his companion. \"Still\nwant to go?\"\n\n\"If you do--and you can't do it alone.\" No man could take on the\nvalley and Wass and his men.\n\nHume made no comment. They had rested briefly after their return to\nthe safari camp, and Vye had been supplied with clothing from Hume's\nbags, so that now he wore the uniform of the Guild. He went armed,\ntoo, with the equipment belt taken from Rovald and that other's\nweapons, needler and tube. At least they started on their dubious\nrescue mission with every aid the safari camp could muster.\n\nIt was mid-afternoon when the flitter took to the air once again,\nscattering the hovering globes. There was no alteration in the ranks\nof the blue watchers waiting--for the barrier to go down, or someone\nin the camp to step beyond that protection?\n\n\"They're stupid,\" Vye said.\n\n\"Not stupid, just geared to one set of actions,\" Hume returned.\n\n\"Which could mean that what sends them here can't change its orders.\"\n\n\"Good guess. I'd say that they were governed by something akin to our\ntapes. No provision made for any innovations.\"\n\n\"So the guiding intelligence could be long gone.\"\n\n\"I think it has been.\" Hume then changed the subject sharply.\n\n\"How did you get into service at the Starfall?\"\n\nIt was hard now to think back to Nahuatl--as if the Vye Lansor who had\nbeen swamper in that den of the port town was a different person\naltogether. In that patch of memories into which Rynch Brodie still\nintruded he hunted for the proper answer.\n\n\"I couldn't hold the state jobs. And once you get the habit of eating,\nyou don't starve willingly.\"\n\n\"Why not the state jobs?\"\n\n\"Without premium they're all low-rung tenders' places. I tried hard\nenough. But to sit pressing buttons when a light flashed, hour after\nhour--\" Vye shook his head. \"They said I was too erratic and gave me\nthe shove. One more move on and it would have been compulsive\nconditioning. I turned port-drift instead.\"\n\n\"Ever thought of trying for a loan premium?\"\n\nVye laughed shortly. \"Loan premium? That's a true fantasy if you've\nbeen job hopping. None of the companies will take a chance on a man\nwith an in and out record. Oh, I tried....\" That memory arose to the\nsurface, clear and very chilling. Yes, he had tried to break out of\nthe net the law and custom had put around him from the day he had\nbeen made a state child. \"No--it was conditioning, or port-drift.\"\n\n\"And you chose port-drift?\"\n\n\"I was still me--as long as I stayed away from conditioning.\"\n\n\"Then you became Rynch Brodie in spite of your flight.\"\n\n\"No--well, maybe, for a while. But I'm still Vye Lansor here.\"\n\n\"Yes, here. And I don't think you'll have to worry about raising a\npremium to get a new start. You can claim victim compensation, you\nknow.\"\n\nVye was silent, but Hume did not let him remain so.\n\n\"When the Patrol arrives, you put in your claim. I'll back you.\"\n\n\"You can't.\"\n\n\"That's where you're mistaken,\" Hume told him crisply. \"I've already\ntaped a full story back at the spacer--it's on record now.\"\n\nVye frowned. The Hunter seemed determined to ask for the worst the\nPatrol--or the planet police back on Nahuatl--could deal out. A case\nof illegal conditioning was about as serious as you could get.\n\nThey shot along the diagonal of the triangle made by three points, the\nmountain valley, Wass' camp, and the safari headquarters, heading to\nthe slopes up which the men must be herded if the beasts were\nshepherding them to the mountain valley. Vye, surveying the forest\nthick below, began to doubt they would ever be able to pick them up\nbefore they reached the valley gate.\n\nHume took a weaving course, zigzagging back and forth, while they both\nwatched intently for a glint from one of the globes, any movement\nwhich would betray that trail. And it was on one of the upper slopes\nthat the flitter passed over two of the blue beasts lumbering along.\nNeither of the creatures paid any attention to the flyer, they moved\nwith purpose on some mission of their own.\n\n\"Maybe the tail end of the hunting pack,\" Hume commented.\n\nHe sent the flyer hovering over a stunted line of trees and brush.\nBeyond that was bare rock. But though they hung for moments, nothing\nmoved into that open.\n\n\"Wrong scent somehow.\" Hume brought the flitter around. He had it on\nmanual control now, keeping it answering to the quick changes of his\nwill.\n\nA longer sweep supplied the answer--a vegetation roofed slit running\nback into the uplands, in a way resembling the crevice through which\nthey had originally found their way into this country. Hume brought\nthe flyer along that. But if the men they sought were pushing their\nway through below they could not be sighted from the air. At last,\nwith evening drawing in, Hume was forced to admit failure.\n\n\"Wait by the gap?\" Vye asked.\n\n\"Have to now.\" Hume glanced about. \"I'd say maybe\ntomorrow--mid-morning before they make it that far--_if_ they are\nhere. We'll have plenty of time.\"\n\nTime for what? To make ready for a pitched battle with Wass--or with\nthe beasts herding him? To try in the space of hours to solve the\nmystery of the lake?\n\n\"Do you think we could blast that thing in the lake?\" Vye asked.\n\n\"We might be able to, just might. But that must be the last resort. We\nwant that in working order for the X-Tee men to study. No, we'd better\nplan to hold Wass at the gate, wait for the Patrol to come in.\"\n\nLess than an hour later after a soaring approach, Hume brought the\nflitter down with neat skill on the top of one of the cliffs which\nhelped to form the portal of the gap. There was no difference in the\nscene below, save that where the two bodies of the blue beasts had\nlain there were now only clean and shining bones.\n\nDarkness spread out from the lake woods like a growing stain of evil\npromise as the sun fell behind the peaks. Night came earlier here than\nin the plains.\n\n\"Watch!\" Vye had been gazing down the gap; he was the first to note\nthat movement in the cloaking bush.\n\nOut of the cover trotted a four-footed, antlered animal he had not\nseen before.\n\n\"Syken deer,\" Hume identified. \"But why in the mountains? It's a long\nway from its home range.\"\n\nThe deer did not pause, but headed directly for the gap and, as it\nneared, Vye saw that its brown coat was roughed with patches of white\nfroth, while more dripped from the pale pink tongue protruding from\nits open jaws, and its shrunken sides heaved.\n\n\"Driven!\" Hume picked up a stone, hurled it to strike the ground ahead\nof the deer.\n\nThe creature did not start, nor show any sign of seeing the rock fall.\nIt trotted on at the same wearied pace, passed the portal rocks into\nthe valley. Then it stood still, wedge-shaped head up, black horns\ndisplayed, while the nose flaps expanded, testing the air, until it\nbounded toward the lake, disappearing in the woods.\n\nThough they shared watches during the night there were no other signs\nof life, nor did the deer reappear from the woods. With the\nmid-morning there was a sudden sound to warn them--a wild cry which\nmust have come from a human throat. Hume tossed one of the needlers to\nVye, took the other, and they scrambled down to the floor of the gap\npassage.\n\nWass did not lead his men, he came behind the reeling trio as if he\nhad joined the blasts as driver. And while his men wavered, staggered,\ngave the appearance of nearly complete exhaustion, he still walked\nwith a steady tread, in command of his wits, his fears, and the\ncompany.\n\nAs the first of the men blundered on, a fresh trickle of red running\ndown his bruised face, Hume called:\n\n\"Wass!\"\n\nThe Veep stopped short. He made no move to unsling the needler he\ncarried, its barrel pointing skyward over his shoulder, but his round\nhead with its upstanding comb of hair swung slightly from side to\nside.\n\n\"Stop--Wass--this is a trap!\"\n\nHis three men kept on. Vye moved, for Peake leading that wavering\ngroup, stumbled, would have fallen had not the younger man advanced\nfrom the shadows to steady him.\n\n\"Vye!\" Hume made his name a warning.\n\nHe had only time to glance around. Wass, his broad face impassive\nexcept for the eyes--those burning madman's eyes--was aiming a ray\ntube.\n\nBroken free of his hold, Peake fell to the right, came up against\nHume. As Vye went down he saw Wass dart forward at a speed he wouldn't\nhave believed a driven man could summon. The Veep lunged, escaping the\nshot the Hunter had no time to aim, rolled, and came up with the\nneedler Vye had dropped.\n\nThen Hume, hampered by Peake's feeble clawing, met head on the\nswinging barrel of that weapon. He gave a startled grunt and smashed\nback against the cliff, a wave of scarlet blood streaming down the\nside of his head.\n\nThe momentum of Wass' charge carried him on. He collided with his men,\nand the last thing Vye saw, was the huddle of all four of them,\nflailing arms and legs, spinning on through the gate into the valley\nwith Wass' hoarse, wordless shouting, bringing echoes from the cliffs.\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\nHe lay against a rock, and it was quiet again, except for a small\nwhimpering sound which hurt, joined with the eating pain in his side.\nVye turned his head, smelled burned cloth and flesh. Cautiously he\ntried to move, bring his hand across his body to the belt at his\nwaist. One small part of his mind was very clear--if he could get his\nfingers to the packet there, and the contents of that packet to his\nmouth, the pain would go away, and maybe he could slip back into the\ndarkness again.\n\nSomehow he did it, pulled the packet out of its container pouch,\nworked the fingers of his one usable hand until he shredded open the\nend of the covering. The tablets inside, spilled out. But he had three\nor four of them in his grasp. Laboriously he brought his hand up,\nmouthed them all together, chewing their bitterness, swallowing them\nas best he could without water.\n\nWater--the lake! For a moment he was back in time, feeling for the\nwater bulbs he should be carrying. Then the incautious movement of his\nquesting fingers brought a sudden stab of raw, red agony and he\nmoaned.\n\nThe tablets worked. But he did not slide back into unconsciousness\nagain as the throbbing torture became something remote and\nuntroubling. With his good arm he braced himself against the cliff,\nmanaged to sit up.\n\nSun flashed on the metal barrel of a needler which lay in the trampled\ndust between him and another figure, still very still, with a pool of\nblood about the head. Vye waited for a steadying breath or two, then\nstarted the infinitely long journey of several feet which separated\nhim from Hume.\n\nHe was panting heavily when he crawled close enough to touch the\nHunter. Hume's face, cheek down in the now sodden dust, was dabbled\nwith congealing blood. As Vye turned the hunter's head, it rolled\nlimply. The other side was a mass of blood and dust, too thick to\nafford Vye any idea of how serious a hurt Hume had taken. But he was\nstill alive.\n\nWith his good hand Vye thrust his numb and useless left one into the\nfront of his belt. Then, awkwardly he tried to tend Hume. After a\nclose inspection he thought that the mass of blood had come from a\nragged tear in the scalp above the temple and the bone beneath had\nescaped damage. From Hume's own first-aid pack he crushed tablets into\nthe other's slack mouth, hoping they would dissolve if the Hunter\ncould not swallow. Then he relaxed against the cliff to wait--for what\nhe could not have said.\n\nWass' party had gone on into the valley. When Vye turned his head to\nlook down the slope he could see nothing of them. They must have tried\nto push on to the lake. The flitter was at the top of the cliff, as\nfar out of his reach now as if it were in planetary orbit. There was\nonly the hope that a rescue party from the safari camp might come.\nHume had set the directional beam on the flyer, when he had brought\nher down, to serve as a beacon for the Patrol, if and when Starns was\nlucky enough to contact a cruiser.\n\n\"Hmmm....\" Hume's mouth moved, cracked the drying bloody mask on his\nlips and chin. His eyes blinked open and he lay staring up at the sky.\n\n\"Hume--\" Vye was startled at the sound of his own voice, so thready\nand weak, and by the fact that he found it difficult to speak at all.\n\nThe other's head turned; now the eyes were on him and there was a\nspark of awareness in them.\n\n\"Wass?\" The whisper was as strained as his own had been.\n\n\"In there.\" Vye's hand lifted from Hume's chest indicating the\nvalley.\n\n\"Not good.\" Hume blinked again. \"How bad?\" His attention was not for\nhis own hurt; his eyes searched Vye. And the latter glanced down at\nhis side.\n\nBy some chance, perhaps because of his struggle with Peake, Wass' beam\nhad not struck true, the main core of the bolt passing between his arm\nand his side, burning both. How deeply he could not tell, in fact he\ndid not want to find out. It was enough that the tablets had banished\nthe pain now.\n\n\"Seared a little,\" he said. \"You've a bad cut on your head.\"\n\nHume frowned. \"Can we make the flitter?\"\n\nVye moved, then relaxed quickly into his former position. \"Not now,\"\nhe evaded, knowing that neither of them would be able to take that\nclimb.\n\n\"Beam on?\" Hume repeated Vye's thoughts of moments before. \"Patrol\ncoming?\"\n\nYes, eventually the Patrol would come--but when? Hours--days? Time was\ntheir enemy now. He did not have to say any of that, they both knew.\n\n\"Needler--\" Hume's head had turned in the other direction; now his\nhand pointed waveringly to the weapon in the dust.\n\n\"They won't be back,\" Vye stated the obvious. Those others had been\ncaught in the trap, the odds on their return without aid were very\nhigh.\n\n\"Needler!\" Hume repeated more firmly, and tried to sit up, falling\nback with a sharp intake of breath.\n\nVye edged around, stretched out his leg and scraped the toe of his\nboot into the loop of the carrying sling, drawing the weapon up to\nwhere he could get his hand on it. As he steadied it across his knee\nHume spoke again:\n\n\"Watch for trouble!\"\n\n\"They all went in,\" Vye protested.\n\nBut Hume's eyes had closed again. \"Trouble--maybe....\" His voice\ntrailed off. Vye rested his hand on the stock of the needler.\n\n\"Hoooooo!\"\n\nThat beast wail--as they had heard it in the valley! Somewhere from\nthe wood. Vye brought the needler around, so that the sights pointed\nin that direction. There death might be hunting, but there was nothing\nhe could do.\n\nA scream, filled with all the agony of a man in torment, caught up on\nthe echoes of that other cry. Vye sighted a wild waving of bushes. A\nfigure, very small and far away, crawled into the open on hands and\nknees and then crumpled into only a shadowy blot on the moss. Again\nthe beast's cry, and a shouting!\n\nVye watched a second man back out of the trees, still facing whatever\npursued him. He caught the glint of sun on what must be a ray tube.\nLeaves crisped into a black hole, curls of smoke arose along the path\nof that blast.\n\nThe man kept on backing, passed the inert body of his companion,\nglancing now and then over his shoulder at the slope up which he was\nmaking a slow but steady way. He no longer rayed the bush, but there\nwas the crackle of a small fire outlining the ragged hole his beam had\ncut.\n\nBack two strides, three. Then he turned, made a quick dash, again\nfacing around after he had gained some yards in the open. Vye saw now\nit was Wass.\n\nAnother dash and an about face. But this time to confront the enemy.\nThere were three of them, as monstrous as those Vye and Hume had\nfought in the same place. And one of them was wounded, swinging a\ncharred forepaw before it, and giving voice to a wild frenzy of roars.\n\nWass leveled the ray tube, centered sights on the beast nearest to\nhim. The man hammered at the firing button with the flat of his other\nhand, and almost paid for that second of distraction with his life,\nfor the creature made one of those lightning swift dashes Vye had so\nluckily escaped. The clawed forepaw tore a strip from the shoulder of\nWass' tunic, left sprouting red furrows behind. But the man had thrown\nthe useless tube into its face, was now running for the gap.\n\nVye held the needler braced against his knee to fire. He saw the dart\nquiver in the upper arm of the beast, and it halted to pull out that\nsliver of dangerously poisoned metal, crumpled it into a tight twist.\nVye continued to fire, never sure of his aim, but seeing those slivers\ngo home in thick legs, in outstretched forelimbs, in wide, pendulous\nbellies. Then there were three blue shapes lying on the slope behind\nthe man running straight for the gap.\n\nWass hit the invisible barrier full force, was hurled back, to lie\ngasping on the turf, but already raising himself to crawl again to the\ngateway he saw and could not believe was barred. Vye closed his eyes.\nHe was very tired now--tired and sleepy--maybe the pain pills were\nbringing the secondary form of relief. But he could hear, just beyond,\nthe man who beat at that unseen curtain, first in anger and fear, and\nthen just in fear, until the fear was a lonesome crying that went on\nand on until even that last feeble assault on the barrier failed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"We have here the tape report of Ras Hume, Out-Hunter of the Guild.\"\n\nVye watched the officer in the black and silver of the Patrol, a black\nand silver modified with the small, green, eye badge of X-Tee, with\nlevel and hostile gaze.\n\n\"Then you know the story.\" He was going to make no additions nor\nexplanations. Maybe Hume had cleared him. All right, that was all he\nwould ask, to be free to go his way and forget about Jumala--and Ras\nHume.\n\nHe had not seen the Hunter since they had both been loaded into the\nPatrol flitter in the gap. Wass had come out of the valley a witless,\ndazed creature, still under the mental influence of whoever, or\nwhatever, had set that trap. As far as Vye knew the Veep had not yet\nrecovered his full senses, he might never do so. And if Hume had not\ndictated that confession to damn himself before the Patrol, he might\nhave escaped. They could suspect--but they would have had no proof.\n\n\"You continue to refuse to tape?\" The officer favored him with one of\nthe closed-jaw looks Vye had often seen on the face of authority.\n\n\"I have my rights.\"\n\n\"You have the right to claim victim compensation--a good compensation,\nLansor.\"\n\nVye shrugged and then winced at a warning from the tender skin over\nribs.\n\n\"I make no claim, and no tape,\" he repeated. And he intended to go on\nsaying that as long as they asked him. This was the second visit in\ntwo days and he was getting a little tired of it all. Perhaps he\nshould do as prudence dictated and demand to be returned to Nahuatl.\nOnly his odd, unexplainable desire to at least see Hume kept him from\nmaking the request they would have to honor.\n\n\"You had better reconsider.\" Authority resumed.\n\n\"Rights of person--\" Vye almost grinned as he recited that. For the\nfirst time in his pushed-around life he could use that particular\nphrase and make it stick. He thought there was a sour twist to the\nofficer's mouth, but the other still retained his impersonal tone as\nhe spoke into the intership com:\n\n\"He refused to make a tape.\"\n\nVye waited for the other's next move. This should mark the end of\ntheir interview. But instead the officer appeared to relax the\nrestraint of his official manner. He brought a viv-root case from an\ninner pocket, offered a choice of contents to Vye, who gave an instant\nand suspicious refusal by shake of head. The officer selected one of\nthe small tubes, snapped off the protecto-nib, and set it between his\nlips for a satisfying and lengthy pull. Then the panel of the cabin\ndoor pushed open, and Vye sat up with a jerk as Ras Hume, his head\nbanded with a skin-core covering, entered.\n\nThe officer waved his hand at Vye with the air of one turning over a\nproblem. \"You were entirely right. And he's all yours, Hume.\"\n\nVye looked from one to the other. With Hume's tape in official hands\nwhy wasn't the Hunter under restraint? Unless, because they were\naboard the Patrol cruiser, the officers didn't think a closer\nconfinement was necessary. Yet the Hunter wasn't acting the role of\nprisoner very well. In fact he perched on a wall-flip seat with the\nease of one completely at home, accepted the viv-root Vye had refused.\n\n\"So you won't make a tape,\" he asked cheerfully.\n\n\"You act as if you want me to!\" Vye was so completely baffled by this\nodd turn of action that his voice came out almost plaintively.\n\n\"Seeing as how a great deal of time and effort went into placing you\nin the position where you _could_ give us that tape, I must admit some\ndisappointment.\"\n\n\"Give _us_?\" Vye echoed.\n\nThe officer removed the viv-root from between his lips. \"Tell him the\nwhole sad story, Hume.\"\n\nBut Vye began to guess. Life in the Starfall, or as port-drift, either\nsharpened the wits or deadened them. Vye's had suffered the burnishing\nprocess. \"A set-up?\"\n\n\"A set-up,\" Hume agreed. Then he glanced at the Patrol officer a\nlittle defensively. \"I might as well tell the whole truth--this\ndidn't quite begin on the right side of the law. I had my reasons for\nwanting to make trouble for the Kogan estate, only not because of the\ncredits involved.\" He moved his plasta-flesh hand. \"When I found that\nL-B from the Largo Drift and saw the possibilities, did a little day\ndreaming--I worked out this scheme. But I'm a Guild man and as it\nhappens, I want to stay one. So I reported to one of the Masters and\ntold him the whole story--why I hadn't taped on the records my\ndiscovery on Jumala.\n\n\"When he passed along the news of the L-B to the Patrol, he also\nsuggested that there might be room for fraud along the way I had\nthought it out. That started a chain reaction. It happened that the\nPatrol wanted Wass. But he was too big and slick to be caught in a\ncase which couldn't be broken in court. They thought that here was\njust the bait he might snap at, and I was the one to offer it to him.\nHe could check on me, learn that I had excellent reason to do what I\nsaid I was doing. So I went to him with my story and he liked it. We\nmade the plan work just as I had outlined it. And he planted Rovald on\nme as a check. But I didn't know Yactisi was a plant, also.\"\n\nThe Patrol officer smiled. \"Insurance,\" he waved the viv-root, \"just\ninsurance.\"\n\n\"What we didn't foresee was this complicating alien trouble. You were\nto be collected as the castaway, brought back to the Center and then,\nonce Wass was firmly enmeshed, the Patrol would blow the thing wide\nopen. Now we do have Wass, with your tape we'll have him for good,\nsubject to complete reconditioning. But we also have an X-Tee puzzle\nwhich will keep the services busy for some time. And we would like\nyour tape.\"\n\nVye watched Hume narrowly. \"Then you're an agent?\"\n\nHume shook his head. \"No, just what I said I am, an Out-Hunter who\nhappened to come into some knowledge that will assist in straightening\nout a few crooked quirks in several systems. I have no love for the\nKogan clan, but to help bring down a Veep of Wass' measure does aid in\nreinstating one's self-esteem.\"\n\n\"This victim compensation--I _could_ claim it, even though the deal\nwas a set-up?\"\n\n\"You'll have first call on Wass' assets. He has plenty invested in\nlegitimate enterprises, though we'll probably never locate all his\nhidden funds. But everything we can get open title to will be\nimpounded. Have something to do with your share?\" inquired the\nofficer.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nHume was smiling subtly. He was a different man from the one Vye had\nknown on Jumala. \"Premium for the Guild is one thousand credits down,\ntwo thousand for training and say another for about the best field\noutfit you can buy. That'll give you maybe another two or three\nthousand to save for your honorable retirement.\"\n\n\"How did you know?\" Vye began and then had to laugh in spite of\nhimself as Hume replied:\n\n\"I didn't. Good guess, eh? Well, zoom out your recorder, Commander. I\nthink you are going to have some very free speech now.\" He got to his\nfeet. \"You know, the Guild has a stake in this alien discovery. We may\njust find that we haven't seen the last of that valley after all,\nrecruit.\"\n\nHe was gone and Vye, eager to have the past done with, and the future\nbeginning, reached for the dictation mike.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nTWO COMPLETE SPACE ADVENTURE NOVELS\n\nPLANET OF ALIEN MONSTERS....\n\n    Somewheres on the jungle world of Jumala, there was a man in\n    hiding--a man whose mind had been reconditioned with\n    another's brain pattern and for whom there was a fabulous\n    reward.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
