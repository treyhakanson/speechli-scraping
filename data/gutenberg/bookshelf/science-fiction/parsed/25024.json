Otherwise, so\n    long as his strength held out, he would be on your trail._\n\n                                        --The Twenty-Fifth Hour,\n                                                     _by Herbert Best_\n\n\nI was one hundred miles from Nowhere--and I mean that literally--when I\nspotted this girl out of the corner of my eye. I'd been keeping an extra\nlookout because I still expected the other undead bugger left over\nfrom the murder party at Nowhere to be stalking me.\n\n[Illustration: They were two desperate scavengers in a no-man's land of\nradiation and death.]\n\nI'd been following a line of high-voltage towers all canted over at the\nsame gentlemanly tipsy angle by an old blast from the Last War. I judged\nthe girl was going in the same general direction and was being edged\nover toward my course by a drift of dust that even at my distance showed\ndangerous metallic gleams and dark humps that might be dead men or\ncattle.\n\nShe looked slim, dark topped, and on guard. Small like me and like me\nwearing a scarf loosely around the lower half of her face in the style\nof the old buckaroos.\n\nWe didn't wave or turn our heads or give the slightest indication we'd\nseen each other as our paths slowly converged. But we were intensely,\nminutely watchful--I knew I was and she had better be.\n\nOverhead the sky was a low dust haze, as always. I don't remember what a\nhigh sky looks like. Three years ago I think I saw Venus. Or it may have\nbeen Sirius or Jupiter.\n\nThe hot smoky light was turning from the amber of midday to the bloody\nbronze of evening.\n\nThe line of towers I was following showed the faintest spread in the\ndirection of their canting--they must have been only a few miles from\nblast center. As I passed each one I could see where the metal on the\nblast side had been eroded--vaporized by the original blast, mostly\nsmoothly, but with welts and pustules where the metal had merely melted\nand run. I supposed the lines the towers carried had all been vaporized\ntoo, but with the haze I couldn't be sure, though I did see three dark\nblobs up there that might be vultures perching.\n\nFrom the drift around the foot of the nearest tower a human skull peered\nwhitely. That is rather unusual. Years later now you still see more dead\nbodies with the meat on them than skeletons. Intense radiation has\nkilled their bacteria and preserved them indefinitely from decay, just\nlike the packaged meat in the last advertisements. In fact such bodies\nare one of the signs of a really hot drift--you avoid them. The vultures\npass up such poisonously hot carrion too--they've learned their lesson.\n\nAhead some big gas tanks began to loom up, like deformed battleships and\nflat-tops in a smoke screen, their prows being the juncture of the\nnatural curve of the off-blast side with the massive concavity of the\non-blast side.\n\nNone of the three other buggers and me had had too clear an idea of\nwhere Nowhere had been--hence, in part, the name--but I knew in a\ngeneral way that I was somewhere in the Deathlands between Porter County\nand Ouachita Parish, probably much nearer the former.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt's a real mixed-up America we've got these days, you know, with just\nthe faintest trickle of a sense of identity left, like a guy in the\npaddedest cell in the most locked up ward in the whole loony bin. If a\ntime traveler from mid Twentieth Century hopped forward to it across the\nfew intervening years and looked at a map of it, if anybody has a map of\nit, he'd think that the map had run--that it had got some sort of\ndisease that had swollen a few tiny parts beyond all bounds, paper\ntumors, while most of the other parts, the parts he remembered carrying\nnames in such big print and showing such bold colors, had shrunk to\nnothingness.\n\nTo the east he'd see Atlantic Highlands and Savannah Fortress. To the\nwest, Walla Walla Territory, Pacific Palisades, and Los Alamos--and\nthere he'd see an actual change in the coastline, I'm told, where three\nof the biggest stockpiles of fusionables let go and opened Death Valley\nto the sea--so that Los Alamos is closer to being a port. Centrally he'd\nfind Porter County and Manteno Asylum surprisingly close together near\nthe Great Lakes, which are tilted and spilled out a bit toward the\nsouthwest with the big quake. South-centrally: Ouachita Parish inching\nup the Mississippi from old Louisiana under the cruel urging of the\nFisher Sheriffs.\n\nThose he'd find and a few, a very few other places, including a couple I\nsuppose I haven't heard of. Practically all of them would surprise\nhim--no one can predict what scraps of a blasted nation are going to\nhang onto a shred of organization and ruthlessly maintain it and very\nslowly and very jealously extend it.\n\nBut biggest of all, occupying practically all the map, reducing all\nthose swollen localities I've mentioned back to tiny blobs, bounding\nmost of America and thrusting its jetty pseudopods everywhere, he'd see\nthe great inkblot of the Deathlands. I don't know how else than by an\narea of solid, absolutely unrelieved black you'd represent the\nDeathlands with its multicolored radioactive dusts and its skimpy\nfreightage of lonely Deathlanders, each bound on his murderous, utterly\npointless, but utterly absorbing business--an area where names like\nNowhere, It, Anywhere, and the Place are the most natural thing in the\nworld when a few of us decide to try to pad down together for a few\nnervous months or weeks.\n\nAs I say, I was somewhere in the Deathlands near Manteno Asylum.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe girl and me were getting closer now, well within pistol or dart\nrange though beyond any but the most expert or lucky knife throw. She\nwore boots and a weathered long-sleeved shirt and jeans. The black\ntopping was hair, piled high in an elaborate coiffure that was held in\nplace by twisted shavings of bright metal. A fine bug-trap, I told\nmyself.\n\nIn her left hand, which was closest to me, she carried a dart gun,\npointed away from me, across her body. It was the kind of potent tiny\ncrossbow you can't easily tell whether the spring is loaded. Back around\non her left hip a small leather satchel was strapped to her belt. Also\non the same side were two sheathed knives, one of which was an\noddity--it had no handle, just the bare tang. For nothing but throwing,\nI guessed.\n\nI let my own left hand drift a little closer to my Banker's Special in\nits open holster--Ray Baker's great psychological weapon, though (who\nknows?) the two .38 cartridges it contained might actually fire. The one\nI'd put to the test at Nowhere had, and very lucky for me.\n\nShe seemed to be hiding her right arm from me. Then I spotted the weapon\nit held, one you don't often see, a stevedore's hook. She _was_ hiding\nher right hand, all right, she had the long sleeve pulled down over it\nso just the hook stuck out. I asked myself if the hand were perhaps\ncovered with radiation scars or sores or otherwise disfigured. We\nDeathlanders have our vanities. I'm sensitive about my baldness.\n\nThen she let her right arm swing more freely and I saw how short it was.\nShe had no right hand. The hook was attached to the wrist stump.\n\nI judged she was about ten years younger than me. I'm pushing forty, I\nthink, though some people have judged I'm younger. No way of my knowing\nfor sure. In this life you forget trifles like chronology.\n\nAnyway, the age difference meant she would have quicker reflexes. I'd\nhave to keep that in mind.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe greenishly glinting dust drift that I'd judged she was avoiding\nswung closer ahead. The girl's left elbow gave a little kick to the\nsatchel on her hip and there was a sudden burst of irregular ticks that\nalmost made me start. I steadied myself and concentrated on thinking\nwhether I should attach any special significance to her carrying a\nGeiger counter. Naturally it wasn't the sort of thinking that interfered\nin any way with my watchfulness--you quickly lose the habit of that kind\nof thinking in the Deathlands or you lose something else.\n\nIt could mean she was some sort of greenhorn. Most of us old-timers can\nvisually judge the heat of a dust drift or crater or rayed area more\nreliably than any instrument. Some buggers claim they just feel it,\nthough I've never known any of the latter too eager to navigate in\nunfamiliar country at night--which you'd think they'd be willing to do\nif they could feel heat blind.\n\nBut she didn't look one bit like a tenderfoot--like for instance some\ncitizeness newly banished from Manteno. Or like some Porter burgher's\nunfaithful wife or troublesome girlfriend whom he'd personally carted\nout beyond the ridges of cleaned-out hot dust that help guard such\nplaces, and then abandoned in revenge or from boredom--and they call\nthemselves civilized, those cultural queers!\n\nNo, she looked like she _belonged_ in the Deathlands. But then why the\ncounter?\n\nHer eyes might be bad, real bad. I didn't think so. She raised her boot\nan extra inch to step over a little jagged fragment of concrete. No.\n\nMaybe she was just a born double-checker, using science to back up\nknowledge based on experience as rich as my own or richer. I've met the\nsuper-careful type before. They mostly get along pretty well, but they\ntend to be a shade too slow in the clutches.\n\nMaybe she was _testing_ the counter, planning to use it some other way\nor trade it for something.\n\nMaybe she made a practice of traveling by night! Then the counter made\ngood sense. But then why use it by day? Why reveal it to me in any case?\n\nWas she trying to convince me that she was a greenhorn? Or had she hoped\nthat the sudden noise would throw me off guard? But who would go to the\ntrouble of carrying a Geiger counter for such devious purposes? And\nwouldn't she have waited until we got closer before trying the noise\ngambit?\n\nThink-shmink--it gets you nowhere!\n\nShe kicked off the counter with another bump of her elbow and started to\nedge in toward me faster. I turned the thinking all off and gave my\nwhole mind to watchfulness.\n\nSoon we were barely more than eight feet apart, almost within lunging\nrange without even the preliminary one-two step, and still we hadn't\nspoken or looked straight at each other, though being that close we'd\nhad to cant our heads around a bit to keep each other in peripheral\nvision. Our eyes would be on each other steadily for five or six\nseconds, then dart forward an instant to check for rocks and holes in\nthe trail we were following in parallel. A cultural queer from one of\nthe \"civilized\" places would have found it funny, I suppose, if he'd\nbeen able to watch us perform in an arena or from behind armor glass for\nhis exclusive pleasure.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe girl had eyebrows as black as her hair, which in its piled-up and\nmetal-knotted savagery called to mind African queens despite her typical\npale complexion--very little ultraviolet gets through the dust. From the\ninside corner of her right eye socket a narrow radiation scar ran up\nbetween her eyebrows and across her forehead at a rakish angle until it\ndisappeared under a sweep of hair at the upper left corner of her\nforehead.\n\nI'd been smelling her, of course, for some time.\n\nI could even tell the color of her eyes now. They were blue. It's a\ncolor you never see. Almost no dusts have a bluish cast, there are few\nblue objects except certain dark steels, the sky never gets very far\naway from the orange range, though it is green from time to time, and\nwater reflects the sky.\n\nYes, she had blue eyes, blue eyes and that jaunty scar, blue eyes and\nthat jaunty scar and a dart gun and a steel hook for a right hand, and\nwe were walking side by side, eight feet apart, not an inch closer,\nstill not looking straight at each other, still not saying a word, and I\nrealized that the initial period of unadulterated watchfulness was over,\nthat I'd had adequate opportunity to inspect this girl and size her up,\nand that night was coming on fast, and that here I was, once again, back\nwith _the problem of the two urges_.\n\nI could try either to kill her or go to bed with her.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI know that at this point the cultural queers (and certainly our\nimaginary time traveler from mid Twentieth Century) would make a great\nnoise about not understanding and not believing in the genuineness of\nthe simple urge to murder that governs the lives of us Deathlanders.\nLike detective-story pundits, they would say that a man or woman murders\nfor gain, or concealment of crime, or from thwarted sexual desire or\noutraged sexual possessiveness--and maybe they would list a few other\n\"rational\" motives--but not, they would say, just for the simple sake of\nmurder, for the sure release and relief it gives, for the sake of wiping\nout one recognizable bit more (the closest bit we can, since those of us\nwith the courage or lazy rationality to wipe out ourselves have long\nsince done so)--wiping out one recognizable bit more of the whole\nmiserable, unutterably disgusting human mess. Unless, they would say, a\nperson is completely insane, which is actually how all outsiders view us\nDeathlanders. They can think of us in no other way.\n\nI guess cultural queers and time travelers simply _don't_ understand,\nthough to be so blind it seems to me that they have to overlook much of\nthe history of the Last War and of the subsequent years, especially the\nmushrooming of crackpot cults with a murder tinge: the werewolf gangs,\nthe Berserkers and Amuckers, the revival of Shiva worship and the Black\nMass, the machine wreckers, the kill-the-killers movements, the new\nwitchcraft, the Unholy Creepers, the Unconsciousers, the radioactive\nblue gods and rocket devils of the Atomites, and a dozen other groupings\nclearly prefiguring Deathlander psychology. Those cults had all been as\nunpredictable as Thuggee or the Dancing Madness of the Middle Ages or\nthe Children's Crusade, yet they had happened just the same.\n\nBut cultural queers are good at overlooking things. They have to be, I\nsuppose. They think they're humanity growing again. Yes, despite their\nlaughable warpedness and hysterical crippledness, they actually\nbelieve--each howlingly different community of them--that they're the\nnew Adams and Eves. They're all excited about themselves and whether or\nnot they wear fig leaves. They don't carry with them, twenty-four hours\na day, like us Deathlanders do, the burden of all that was forever lost.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSince I've gone this far I'll go a bit further and make the paradoxical\nadmission that even us Deathlanders don't really understand our urge to\nmurder. Oh, we have our rationalizations of it, just like everyone has\nof his ruling passion--we call ourselves junkmen, scavengers, gangrene\nsurgeons; we sometimes believe we're doing the person we kill the\nultimate kindness, yes and get slobbery tearful about it afterwards; we\nsometimes tell ourselves we've finally found and are rubbing out the one\nman or woman who was responsible for everything; we talk, mostly to\nourselves, about the aesthetics of homicide; we occasionally admit, but\nonly each to himself alone, that we're just plain nuts.\n\nBut we don't really understand our urge to murder, we only _feel_ it.\n\nAt the hateful sight of another human being, we feel it begins to grow\nin us until it becomes an overpowering impulse that jerks us, like a\npuppet is jerked by its strings, into the act itself or its attempted\ncommission.\n\nLike I was feeling it grow in me now as we did this parallel deathmarch\nthrough the reddening haze, me and this girl and our problem. This girl\nwith the blue eyes and the jaunty scar.\n\nThe problem of the _two_ urges, I said. The other urge, the sexual, is\none that I know all cultural queers (and certainly our time traveler)\nwould claim to know all about. Maybe they do. But I wonder if they\nunderstand how intense it can be with us Deathlanders when it's the only\nrelease (except maybe liquor and drugs, which we seldom can get and even\nmore rarely dare use)--the only complete release, even though a brief\none, from the overpowering loneliness and from the tyranny of the urge\nto kill.\n\nTo embrace, to possess, to glut lust on, yes even briefly to love,\nbriefly to shelter in--that was good, that was a relief and release to\nbe treasured.\n\nBut it couldn't last. You could draw it out, prop it up perhaps for a\nfew days, for a month even (though sometimes not for a single\nnight)--you might even start to talk to each other a little, after a\nwhile--but it could never last. The glands always tire, if nothing else.\n\nMurder was the only _final_ solution, the only _permanent_ release.\nOnly us Deathlanders know how good it feels. But then after the kill the\nloneliness would come back, redoubled, and after a while I'd meet\nanother hateful human ...\n\n_Our_ problem of the two urges. As I watched this girl slogging along\nparallel to me, as I kept constant watch on her of course, I wondered\nhow _she_ was feeling the two urges. Was she attracted to the ridgy\nscars on my cheeks half revealed by my scarf?--to me they have a\npleasing symmetry. Was she wondering how my head and face looked without\nthe black felt skullcap low-visored over my eyes? Or was she thinking\nmostly of that hook swinging into my throat under the chin and dragging\nme down?\n\nI couldn't tell. She looked as poker-faced as I was trying to.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor that matter, I asked myself, how was _I_ feeling the two urges?--how\nwas I feeling them as I watched this girl with the blue eyes and the\njaunty scar and the arrogantly thinned lips that asked to be smashed,\nand the slender throat?--and I realized that there was no way to\ndescribe that, not even to myself. I could only feel the two urges grow\nin me, side by side, like monstrous twins, until they would simply be\ntoo big for my taut body and one of them would have to get out fast.\n\nI don't know which one of us started to slow down first, it happened so\ngradually, but the dust puffs that rise from the ground of the\nDeathlands under even the lightest treading became smaller and smaller\naround our steps and finally vanished altogether, and we were standing\nstill. Only then did I notice the obvious physical trigger for our\nstopping. An old freeway ran at right angles across our path. The\nshoulder by which we'd approached it was sharply eroded, so that the\npavement, which even had a shallow cave eroded under it, was a good\nthree feet above the level of our path, forming a low wall. From where\nI'd stopped I could almost reach out and touch the rough-edged\nsmooth-topped concrete. So could she.\n\nWe were right in the midst of the gas tanks now, six or seven of them\ntowered around us, squeezed like beer cans by the decade-old blast but\ntheir metal looking sound enough until you became aware of the red light\nshowing through in odd patterns of dots and dashes where vaporization or\nlater erosion had been complete. Almost but not quite lace-work. Just\nahead of us, right across the freeway, was the six-storey skeletal\nstructure of an old cracking plant, sagged like the power towers away\nfrom the blast and the lower storeys drifted with piles and ridges and\nsmooth gobbets of dust.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe light was getting redder and smokier every minute.\n\nWith the cessation of the physical movement of walking, which is always\nsome sort of release for emotions, I could feel the twin urges growing\nfaster in me. But that was all right, I told myself--this was the\ncrisis, as she must realize too, and that should key us up to bear the\nurges a little longer without explosion.\n\nI was the first to start to turn my head. For the first time I looked\nstraight into her eyes and she into mine. And as always happens at such\ntimes, a third urge appeared abruptly, an urge momentarily as strong as\nthe other two--the urge to speak, to tell and ask all about it. But even\nas I started to phrase the first crazily happy greeting, my throat\nlumped, as I'd known it would, with the awful melancholy of all that was\nforever lost, with the uselessness of any communication, with the\nimpossibility of recreating the past, our individual pasts, any pasts.\nAnd as it always does, the third urge died.\n\nI could tell she was feeling that ultimate pain just like me. I could\nsee her eyelids squeeze down on her eyes and her face lift and her\nshoulders go back as she swallowed hard.\n\nShe was the first to start to lay aside a weapon. She took two sidewise\nsteps toward the freeway and reached her whole left arm further across\nher body and laid the dart gun on the concrete and drew back her hand\nfrom it about six inches. At the same time looking at me hard--fiercely\nangrily, you'd say--across her left shoulder. She had the experienced\nduelist's trick of seeming to look into my eyes but actually focussing\non my mouth. I was using the same gimmick myself--it's tiring to look\nstraight into another person's eyes and it can put you off guard.\n\nMy left side was nearest the wall so I didn't for the moment have the\nproblem of reaching across my body. I took the same sidewise steps she\nhad and using just two fingers, very gingerly--_disarmingly_, I hoped--I\nlifted my antique firearm from its holster and laid it on the concrete\nand drew back my hand from it all the way. Now it was up to her again,\nor should be. Her hook was going to be quite a problem, I realized, but\nwe needn't come to it right away.\n\nShe temporized by successively unsheathing the two knives at her left\nside and laying them beside the dart gun. Then she stopped and her look\ntold me plainly that it was up to me.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNow I am a bugger who believes in carrying _one perfect\nknife_--otherwise, I know for a fact, you'll go knife-happy and end up\nby weighing yourself down with dozens, literally. So I am naturally very\nreluctant to get out of touch in any way with Mother, who is a little\nrusty along the sides but made of the toughest and most sharpenable\nalloy steel I've ever run across.\n\nStill, I was most curious to find out what she'd do about that hook, so\nI finally laid Mother on the concrete beside the .38 and rested my\nhands lightly on my hips, all ready to enjoy myself--at least I hoped I\ngave that impression.\n\nShe smiled, it was almost a nice smile--by now we'd let our scarves drop\nsince we weren't raising any more dust--and then she took hold of the\nhook with her left hand and started to unscrew it from the\nleather-and-metal base fitting over her stump.\n\nOf course, I told myself. And her second knife, the one without a grip,\nmust be that way so she could screw its tang into the base when she\nwanted a knife on her right hand instead of a hook. I ought to have\nguessed.\n\nI grinned my admiration of her mechanical ingenuity and immediately\nunhitched my knapsack and laid it beside my weapons. Then a thought\noccurred to me. I opened the knapsack and moving my hand slowly and very\nopenly so she'd have no reason to suspect a ruse, I drew out a blanket\nand, trying to show her both sides of it in the process, as if I were\nperforming some damned conjuring trick, dropped it gently on the ground\nbetween us.\n\nShe unsnapped the straps on her satchel that fastened it to her belt and\nlaid it aside and then she took off her belt too, slowly drawing it\nthrough the wide loops of weathered denim. Then she looked meaningfully\nat my belt.\n\nI had to agree with her. Belts, especially heavy-buckled ones like ours,\ncan be nasty weapons. I removed mine. Simultaneously each belt joined\nits corresponding pile of weapons and other belongings.\n\nShe shook her head, not in any sort of negation, and ran her fingers\ninto the black hair at several points, to show me it hid no weapon, then\nlooked at me questioningly. I nodded that I was satisfied--I hadn't seen\nanything run out of it, by the way. Then she looked up at my black\nskullcap and she raised her eyebrows and smiled again, this time with a\nspice of mocking anticipation.\n\nIn some ways I hate to part with that headpiece more than I do with\nMother. Not really because of its sandwiched lead-mesh inner lining--if\nthe rays haven't baked my brain yet they never will and I'm sure that\nthe patches of lead mesh sewed into my pants over my loins give a lot\nmore practical protection. But I was getting real attracted to this girl\nby now and there are times when a person must make a sacrifice of his\nvanity. I whipped off my stylish black felt and tossed it on my pile and\ndared her to laugh at my shiny egg top.\n\nStrangely she didn't even smile. She parted her lips and ran her tongue\nalong the upper one. I gave an eager grin in reply, an incautiously wide\none, and she saw my plates flash.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMy plates are something rather special though they are by no means\nunique. Back toward the end of the Last War, when it was obvious to any\nrealist how bad things were going to be, though not how strangely\nterrible, a number of people, like myself, had all their teeth jerked\nand replaced with durable plates. I went some of them one better. My\nplates were stainless steel biting and chewing ridges, smooth continuous\nones that didn't attempt to copy individual teeth. A person who looks\nclosely at a slab of chewing tobacco, say, I offer him will be puzzled\nby the smoothly curved incision, made as if by a razor blade mounted on\nthe arm of a compass. Magnetic powder buried in my gums makes for a real\nnice fit.\n\nThis sacrifice was worse than my hat and Mother combined, but I could\nsee the girl expected me to make it and would take no substitutes, and\nin this attitude I had to admit that she showed very sound judgment,\nbecause I keep the incisor parts of those plates filed to razor\nsharpness. I have to be careful about my tongue and lips but I figure\nit's worth it. With my dental scimitars I can in a wink bite out a chunk\nof throat and windpipe or jugular, though I've never had occasion to do\nso yet.\n\nFor the first minute it made me feel like an old man, a real dodderer,\nbut by now the attraction this girl had for me was getting irrational. I\ncarefully laid the two plates on top of my knapsack.\n\nIn return, as a sort of reward you might say, she opened her mouth wide\nand showed me what was left of her own teeth--about two-thirds of them,\na patchwork of tartar and gold.\n\nWe took off our boots, pants and shirts, she watching very\nsuspiciously--I knew she'd been skeptical of my carrying only one knife.\n\nOddly perhaps, considering how touchy I am about my baldness, I felt no\nsensitivity about revealing the lack of hair on my chest and in fact a\nsort of pride in displaying the slanting radiation scars that have\nreplaced it, though they are crawling keloids of the ugliest, bumpiest\nsort. I guess to me such scars are tribal insignia--one-man and\none-woman tribes of course. No question but that the scar on the girl's\nforehead had been the first focus of my desire for her and it still\nadded to my interest.\n\nBy now we weren't staying as perfectly on guard or watching each other's\nclothing for concealed weapons as carefully as we should--I know I\nwasn't. It was getting dark fast, there wasn't much time left, and the\nother interest was simply becoming too great.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe were still automatically careful about how we did things. For\ninstance the way we took off our pants was like ballet, simultaneously\ncrouching a little on the left foot and whipping the right leg out of\nits sheath in one movement, all ready to jump without tripping\nourselves if the other person did anything funny, and then skinning down\nthe left pants-leg with a movement almost as swift.\n\nBut as I say it was getting too late for perfect watchfulness, in fact\nfor any kind of effective watchfulness at all. The complexion of the\nwhole situation was changing in a rush. The possibilities of dealing or\nreceiving death--along with the chance of the minor indignity of\ncannibalism, which some of us practice--were suddenly gone, all gone. It\nwas going to be all right this time, I was telling myself. This was the\ntime it would be different, this was the time love would last, this was\nthe time lust would be the firm foundation for understanding and trust,\nthis time there would be really safe sleeping. This girl's body would be\nhome for me, a beautiful tender inexhaustibly exciting home, and mine\nfor her, for always.\n\nAs she threw off her shirt, the last darkly red light showed me another\nsmooth slantwise scar, this one around her hips, like a narrow girdle\nthat has slipped down a little on one side.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\n    _Murder most foul, as in the best it is;\n    But this most foul, strange and unnatural._\n\n                                        --Hamlet\n\n\nWhen I woke the light was almost full amber and I could feel no flesh\nagainst mine, only the blanket under me. I very slowly rolled over and\nthere she was, sitting on the corner of the blanket not two feet from\nme, combing her long black hair with a big, wide-toothed comb she'd\nscrewed into the leather-and-metal cap over her wrist stump.\n\nShe'd put on her pants and shirt, but the former were rolled up to her\nknees and the latter, though tucked in, wasn't buttoned.\n\nShe was looking at me, contemplating me you might say, quite dreamily\nbut with a faint, easy smile.\n\nI smiled back at her.\n\nIt was lovely.\n\nToo lovely. There had to be something wrong with it.\n\nThere was. Oh, nothing big. Just a solitary trifle--nothing worth\nnoticing really.\n\nBut the tiniest solitary things can sometimes be the most irritating,\nlike _one_ mosquito.\n\nWhen I'd first rolled over she'd been combing her hair straight back,\nrevealing a wedge of baldness following the continuation of her forehead\nscar deep back across her scalp. Now with a movement that was swift\nthough not hurried-looking she swept the mass of her hair forward and to\nthe left, so that it covered the bald area. Also her lips straightened\nout.\n\nI was hurt. She shouldn't have hidden her bit of baldness, it was\nsomething we had in common, something that brought us closer. And she\nshouldn't have stopped smiling at just that moment. Didn't she realize\nI loved that blaze on her scalp just as much as any other part of her,\nthat she no longer had any need to practice vanity in front of me?\n\nDidn't she realize that as soon as she stopped smiling, her\ncontemplative stare became an insult to me? What right had she to stare,\ncritically I felt sure, at my bald head? What right had she to know\nabout the nearly-healed ulcer on my left shin?--that was a piece of\ninformation worth a man's life in a fight. What right had she to cover\nup, anyways, while I was still naked? She ought to have waked me up so\nthat we could have got dressed as we'd undressed, together. There were\nlots of things wrong with her manners.\n\nOh, I know that if I'd been able to think calmly, maybe if I'd just had\nsome breakfast or a little coffee inside me, or even if there'd been\nsome hot breakfast to eat at that moment, I'd have recognized my\nirritation for the irrational, one-mosquito surge of negative feeling\nthat it was.\n\nEven without breakfast, if I'd just had the knowledge that there was a\nreasonably secure day ahead of me in which there'd be an opportunity for\nme to straighten out my feelings, I wouldn't have been irked, or at\nleast being irked wouldn't have bothered me terribly.\n\nBut a sense of security is an even rarer commodity in the Deathlands\nthan a hot breakfast.\n\nGiven just the ghost of a sense of security and/or some hot breakfast,\nI'd have told myself that she was merely being amusingly coquettish\nabout her bald streak and her hair, that it was natural for a woman to\ntry to preserve some mystery about herself in front of the man she beds\nwith.\n\nBut you get leery of any kind of mystery in the Deathlands. It makes you\nfrightened and angry, like it does an animal. Mystery is for cultural\nqueers, strictly. The only way for two people to get along together in\nthe Deathlands, even for a while, is never to hide anything and never to\nmake a move that doesn't have an immediate clear explanation. You can't\ntalk, you see, certainly not at first, and so you can't explain anything\n(most explanations are just lies and dreams, anyway), so you have to be\ndoubly careful and explicit about everything you do.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis girl wasn't being either. Right now, on top of her other\ngaucheries, she was unscrewing the comb from her wrist--an unfriendly if\nnot quite a hostile act, as anyone must admit.\n\nUnderstand, please, I wasn't _showing_ any of these negative reactions\nof mine any more than she was showing hers, except for her stopping\nsmiling. In fact _I hadn't_ stopped smiling, I was playing the game to\nthe hilt.\n\nBut inside me everything was stewed up and the other urge had come back\nand presently it would begin to grow again. That's the trouble, you\nknow, with sex as a solution to the problem of the two urges. It's fine\nwhile it lasts but it wears itself out and then you're back with Urge\nNumber One and you have nothing left to balance it with.\n\nOh, I wouldn't kill this girl today, I probably wouldn't seriously think\nof killing her for a month or more, but Old Urge Number One would be\nthere and growing, mostly under cover, all the time. Of course there\nwere things I could do to slow its growth, lots of little gimmicks, in\nfact--I was pretty experienced at this business.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor instance, I could take a shot at talking to her pretty soon. For a\ncatchy starter, I could tell her about Nowhere, how these five other\nbuggers and me found ourselves independently skulking along after this\nscavenging expedition from Porter, how we naturally joined forces in\nthat situation, how we set a pitfall for their alky-powered jeep and\nwrecked it and them, how when our haul turned out to be unexpectedly big\nthe four of us left from the kill chummied up and padded down together\nand amused each other for a while and played games, you might say. Why,\nat one point we even had an old crank phonograph going and read some\nbooks. And, of course, how when the loot gave out and the fun wore off,\nwe had our murder party and I survived along with, I think, a bugger\nnamed Jerry--at any rate, he was gone when the blood stopped spurting,\nand I'd had no stomach for tracking him, though I probably should have.\n\nAnd in return she could tell me how she had killed off her last set of\ngirlfriends, or boyfriends, or friend, or whatever it was.\n\nAfter that, we could have a go at exchanging news, rumors and\nspeculations about local, national and world events. Was it true that\nAtlantic Highlands had planes of some sort or were they from Europe?\nWere they actually crucifying the Deathlanders around Walla Walla or\nonly nailing up their dead bodies as dire warnings to others such? Had\nManteno made Christianity compulsory yet, or were they still tolerating\nZen Buddhists? Was it true that Los Alamos had been completely wiped out\nby plague, but the area taboo to Deathlanders because of the robot\nguards they'd left behind--metal guards eight feet tall who tramped\nacross the white sands, wailing? Did they still have free love in\nPacific Palisades? Did she know there'd been a pitched battle fought by\nexpeditionary forces from Ouachita and Savannah Fortress? Over the loot\nof Birmingham, apparently, after yellow fever had finished off that\nprincipality. Had she rooted out any \"observers\" lately?--some of the\n\"civilized\" communities, the more \"scientific\" ones, try to maintain a\nfew weather stations and the like in the Deathlands, camouflaging them\nelaborately and manning them with one or two impudent characters to whom\nwe give a hard time if we uncover them. Had she heard the tale that was\ngoing around that South America and the French Riviera had survived the\nLast War absolutely untouched?--and the obviously ridiculous rider that\nthey had blue skies there and saw stars every third night? Did she think\nthat subsequent conditions were showing that the Earth actually had\nplunged into an interstellar dust cloud coincidentally with the start of\nthe Last War (the dust cloud used as a cover for the first attacks, some\nsaid) or did she still hold with the majority that the dust was solely\nof atomic origin with a little help from volcanoes and dry spells? How\nmany green sunsets had she seen in the last year?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter we'd chewed over those racy topics and some more like them, and\nincidentally got bored with guessing and fabricating, we might, if we\nfelt especially daring and conversation were going particularly well,\neven take a chance on talking a little about our childhoods, about how\nthings were before the Last War (though she was almost too young for\nthat)--about the _little_ things we remembered--the big things were much\ntoo dangerous topics to venture on and sometimes even the little\nmemories could suddenly twist you up as if you'd swallowed lye.\n\nBut after that there wouldn't be anything left to talk about. Anything\nyou'd risk talking about, that is. For instance, no matter how long we\ntalked, it was very unlikely that we'd either of us tell the other\nanything complete or very accurate about how we lived from day to day,\nabout our techniques of surviving and staying sane or at least\nfunctional--that would be too imprudent, it would go too much against\nthe grain of any player of the murder game. Would I tell her, or anyone,\nabout how I worked the ruses of playing dead and disguising myself as a\nwoman, about my trick of picking a path just before dark and then\ncircling back to it by a pre-surveyed route, about the chess games I\nplayed with myself, about the bottle of green, terribly hot-looking\npowder I carried to sprinkle behind me to bluff off pursuers? A fat\nchance of my revealing things like that!\n\nAnd when all the talk was over, what would it have gained us? Our\nminds would be filled with a lot of painful stuff better kept\nburied--meaningless hopes, scraps of vicarious living in \"cultured\"\ncommunities, memories that were nothing but melancholy given concrete\nform. The melancholy is easiest to bear when it's the diffused\nbackground for everything; and all garbage is best kept in the can. Oh\nyes, our talking would have gained us a few more days of infatuation, of\nphantom security, but those we could have--almost as many of them, at\nany rate--without talking.\n\nFor instance things were smoothing over already between her and me again\nand I no longer felt quite so irked. She'd replaced the comb with an\ninoffensive-looking pair of light pliers and was doing up her hair with\nthe metal shavings. And I was acting as if content to watch her, as in a\nway I was. I'd still made no move to get dressed.\n\nShe looked real sweet, you know, primping herself that way. Her face was\na little flat, but it was young, and the scar gave it just the fillip it\nneeded.\n\nBut what was going on behind that forehead right now, I asked myself? I\nfelt real psychic this morning, my mind as clear as a bottle of White\nRock you find miraculously unbroken in a blasted tavern, and the answers\nto the question I'd asked myself came effortlessly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe was telling herself she'd got herself a man again, a man who was\nadequate in the primal clutch (I gave myself that pat on the back), and\nthat she wouldn't have to be plagued and have her safety endangered by\n_that_ kind of mind-dulling restlessness and yearning for a while.\n\nShe was lightly playing around with ideas about how she'd found a home\nand a protector, knowing she was kidding herself, that it was the most\ngimcracky feminine make-believe, but enjoying it just the same.\n\nShe was sizing me up, deciding in detail just what I went for in a\nwoman, what whetted my interest, so she could keep that roused as long\nas seemed desirable or prudent to her to continue our relation.\n\nShe was kicking herself, only lightly to begin with, because she hadn't\ntaken any precautions--because we who've escaped hot death against all\nreasonable expectations by virtue of some incalculable resistance to the\nills of radioactivity, quite often find we've escaped sterility too. If\nshe should become pregnant, she was telling herself, then she had a real\nsticky business ahead of her where no man could be trusted for a second.\n\nAnd because she was thinking of this and because she was obviously a\nrealistic Deathlander, she was reminding herself that a woman is\nbasically less impulsive and daring and resourceful than a man and so\nhad always better be sure she gets in the first blow. She would be\nthinking that I was a realist myself and a smart man, one able to\nunderstand her predicament quite clearly--and because of that a much\nsooner danger to her. She was feeling Old Number One Urge starting to\ngrow in her again and wondering whether it mightn't be wisest to give it\nthe hot-house treatment.\n\nThat is the trouble with a clear mind. For a little while you see things\nas they really are and you can accurately predict how they're going to\nshape the future ... and then suddenly you realize you've predicted\nyourself a week or a month into the future and you can't live the\nintervening time any more because you've already imagined it in detail.\nPeople who live in communities, even the cultural queers of our maimed\nera, aren't much bothered by it--there must be some sort of blinkers\nthey hand you out along with the key to the city--but in the Deathlands\nit's a fairly common phenomenon and there's no hiding from it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMe and my clear mind!--once again it had done me out of days of fun,\nchanged a thoroughly-explored love affair into a one night stand. Oh,\nthere was no question about it, this girl and I were finished, right\nthis minute, as of now, because she was just as psychic as I was this\nmorning and had sensed every last thing that I'd been thinking.\n\nWith a movement smooth enough not to look rushed I swung into a crouch.\nShe was on her knees faster than that, her left hand hovering over the\nlittle set of tools for her stump, which like any good mechanic she'd\nlined up neatly on the edge of the blanket--the hook, the comb, a long\ntelescoping fork, a couple of other items, and the knife. I'd grabbed a\nhandful of blanket, ready to jerk it from under her. She'd seen that I'd\ngrabbed it. Our gazes dueled.\n\nThere was a high-pitched whine over our heads! Quite loud from the\nstart, though it sounded as if it were very deep up in the haze. It\nswiftly dropped in pitch and volume.\n\nThe top of the skeletal cracking plant across the freeway glowed with\nSt. Elmo's fire! Three times it glowed that way, so bright we could see\nthe violet-blue flames of it reaching up despite the full amber\ndaylight.\n\nThe whine died away but in the last moment, paradoxically, it seemed to\nbe coming closer!\n\nThis shared threat--for any unexpected event is a threat in the\nDeathlands and a mysterious event doubly so--put a stop to our murder\ngame. The girl and I were buddies again, buddies to be relied on in a\npinch, for the duration of the threat at least. No need to say so or to\nreassure each other of the fact in any way, it was taken for granted.\nBesides, there was no time. We had to use every second allowed us in\ngetting ready for whatever was coming.\n\nFirst I grabbed up Mother. Then I relieved myself--fear made it easy.\nThen I skinned into my pants and boots, slapped in my teeth, thrust the\nblanket and knapsack into the shallow cave under the edge of the\nfreeway, looking around me all the time so as not to be surprised from\nany quarter.\n\nMeanwhile the girl had put on her boots, located her dart gun, unscrewed\nthe pliers from her stump, put the knife in, and was arranging her scarf\nso it made a sling for the maimed arm--I wondered why but had no time to\nwaste guessing, even if I'd wanted to, for at that moment a small dull\nsilver plane, beetle-shaped more than anything else, loomed out of the\nhaze beyond the cracking plant and came silently drifting down toward\nus.\n\nThe girl thrust her satchel into the cave and along with it her dart\ngun. I caught her idea and tucked Mother into my pants behind my back.\n\nI'd thought from the first glimpse of it that the plane was disabled--I\nguess it was its silence that gave me the idea. This theory was\nconfirmed when one of its very stubby wings or vanes touched a corner\npillar of the cracking plant. The plane was moving in too slow a glide\nto be wrecked, in fact it was moving in a slower glide than I would have\nbelieved possible--but then it's many years since I have seen a plane in\nflight.\n\nIt wasn't wrecked but the little collision spun it around twice in a\nlazy circle and it landed on the freeway with a scuffing noise not fifty\nfeet from us. You couldn't exactly say it had crashed in, but it stayed\nat an odd tilt. It looked crippled all right.\n\nAn oval door in the plane opened and a man dropped lightly out on the\nconcrete. And what a man! He was nearer seven feet tall than six,\nclose-cropped blond hair, face and hands richly tanned, the rest of him\ncovered by trim garments of a gleaming gray. He must have weighed as\nmuch as the two of us together, but he was beautifully built, muscular\nyet supple-seeming. His face looked brightly intelligent and\neven-tempered and kind.\n\nYes, kind!--damn him! It wasn't enough that his body should fairly glow\nwith a health and vitality that was an insult to our seared skins and\nstringy muscles and ulcers and half-rotted stomachs and half-arrested\ncancers, he had to look kind too--the sort of man who would put you to\nbed and take care of you, as if you were some sort of interesting sick\nfox, and maybe even say a little prayer for you, and all manner of other\nabominations.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI don't think I could have endured my fury standing still. Fortunately\nthere was no need to. As if we'd rehearsed the whole thing for hours,\nthe girl and I scrambled up onto the freeway and scurried toward the man\nfrom the plane, cunningly swinging away from each other so that it would\nbe harder for him to watch the two of us at once, but not enough to make\nit obvious that we attended an attack from two quarters.\n\nWe didn't run though we covered the ground as fast as we dared--running\nwould have been too much of a give-away too, and the Pilot, which was\nhow I named him to myself, had a strange-looking small gun in his right\nhand. In fact the way we moved was part of our act--I dragged one leg as\nif it were crippled and the girl faked another sort of limp, one that\nmade her approach a series of half curtsies. Her arm in the sling was\nall twisted, but at the same time she was accidently showing her\nbreasts--I remember thinking _you won't distract this breed bull that\nway, sister, he probably has a harem of six-foot heifers_. I had my head\nthrown back and my hands stretched out supplicatingly. Meanwhile the\nboth of us were babbling a blue streak. I was rapidly croaking something\nlike, \"Mister for God's sake save my pal he's hurt a lot worse'n I am\nnot a hundred yards away he's dyin' mister he's dyin' o' thirst his\ntongue's black'n all swole up oh save him mister save my pal he's not a\nhundred yards away he's dyin' mister dyin'--\" and she was singsonging an\neven worse rigamarole about how \"they\" were after us from Porter and\ngoing to crucify us because we believed in science and how they'd\nalready impaled her mother and her ten-year-old sister and a lot more of\nthe same.\n\nIt didn't matter that our stories didn't fit or make sense, the babble\nhad a convincing tone and getting us closer to this guy, which was all\nthat counted. He pointed his gun at me and then I could see him hesitate\nand I thought exultingly _it's a lot of healthy meat you got there,\nmister, but it's tame meat, mister, tame!_\n\nHe compromised by taking a step back and sort of hooting at us and\nwaving us off with his left hand, as if we were a couple of stray dogs.\n\nIt was greatly to our advantage that we'd acted without hesitation, and\nI don't think we'd have been able to do that except that we'd been all\nset to kill each other when he dropped in. Our muscles and nerves and\nminds were keyed for instant ruthless attack. And some \"civilized\"\npeople still say that the urge to murder doesn't contribute to\nself-preservation!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe were almost close enough now and he was steeling himself to shoot and\nI remember wondering for a split second what his damn gun did to you,\nand then me and the girl had started the alternation routine. I'd stop\ndead, as if completely cowed by the threat of his weapon, and as he took\nnote of it she'd go in a little further, and as his gaze shifted to her\nshe'd stop dead and I'd go in another foot and then try to make my halt\neven more convincing as his gaze darted back to me. We worked it\nperfectly, our rhythm was beautiful, as if we were old dancing partners,\nthough the whole thing was absolutely impromptu.\n\nStill, I honestly don't think we'd ever have got to him if it hadn't\nbeen for the distraction that came just then to help us. I could tell,\nyou see, that he'd finally steeled himself and we still weren't quite\nclose enough. He wasn't as tame as I'd hoped. I reached behind me for\nMother, determined to do a last-minute rush and leap anyway, when there\ncame this sick scream.\n\nI don't know how else to describe it briefly. It was a scream, feminine\nfor choice, it came from some distance and the direction of the old\ncracking plant, it had a note of anguish and warning, yet at the same\ntime it was weak and almost faltering you might say and squeaky at the\nend, as if it came from a person half dead and a throat choked with\nphlegm. It had all those qualities or a wonderful mimicking of them.\n\nAnd it had quite an effect on our boy in gray for in the act of shooting\nme down he started to turn and look over his shoulder.\n\nOh, it didn't altogether stop him from shooting me. He got me partly\ncovered again as I was in the middle of my lunge. I found out what his\ngun did to you. My right arm, which was the part he'd covered, just went\ndead and I finished my lunge slamming up against his iron knees, like a\nhighschool kid trying to block out a pro footballer, with the knife\nslipping uselessly away from my fingers.\n\nBut in the blessed meanwhile the girl had lunged too, not with a slow\nslash, thank God, but with a high, slicing thrust aimed arrow-straight\nfor a point just under his ear.\n\nShe connected and a fan of blood sprayed her full in the face.\n\nI grabbed my knife with my left hand as it fell, scrambled to my feet,\nand drove the knife at his throat in a round-house swing that happened\nto come handiest at the time. The point went through his flesh like\nnothing and jarred against his spine with a violence that I hoped would\nshock into nervous insensibility the stoutest medulla oblongata and\nprevent any dying reprisals on his part.\n\nI got my wish, in large part. He swayed, straightened, dropped his gun,\nand fell flat on his back, giving his skull a murderous crack on the\nconcrete for good measure. He lay there and after a half dozen gushes\nthe bright blood quit pumping strongly out of his neck.\n\nThen came the part that was like a dying reprisal, though obviously not\nbeing directed by him as of now. And come to think of it, it may have\nhad its good points.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe girl, who was clearly a most cool-headed cuss, snatched for his gun\nwhere he'd dropped it, to make sure she got it ahead of me. She\nsnatched, yes--and then jerked back, letting off a sizable squeal of\npain, anger, and surprise.\n\nWhere we'd seen his gun hit the concrete there was now a tiny\nincandescent puddle. A rill of blood snaked out from the pool around his\nhead and touched the whitely glowing puddle and a jet of steam sizzled\nup.\n\nSomehow the gun had managed to melt itself in the moment of its owner\ndying. Well, at any rate that showed it hadn't contained any gunpowder\nor ordinary chemical explosives, though I already knew it operated on\nother principles from the way it had been used to paralyze me. More to\nthe point, it showed that the gun's owner was the member of a culture\nthat believed in taking very complete precautions against its gadgets\nfalling into the hands of strangers.\n\nBut the gun fusing wasn't quite all. As the girl and me shifted our gaze\nfrom the puddle, which was cooling fast and now glowed red like the\nblood--as we shifted our gaze back from the puddle to the dead man, we\nsaw that at three points (points over where you'd expect pockets to be)\nhis gray clothing had charred in small irregularly shaped patches from\nwhich threads of black smoke were twisting upward.\n\nJust at that moment, so close as to make me jump in spite of years of\nlearning to absorb shocks stoically--right at my elbow it seemed to (the\ngirl jumped too, I may say)--a voice said, \"Done a murder, hey?\"\n\nAdvancing briskly around the skewily grounded plane from the direction\nof the cracking plant was an old geezer, a seasoned, hard-baked\nDeathlander if I ever saw one. He had a shock of bone-white hair, the\nrest of him that showed from his weathered gray clothing looked fried by\nthe sun's rays and others to a stringy crisp, and strapped to his boots\nand weighing down his belt were a good dozen knives.\n\nNot satisfied with the unnerving noise he'd made already, he went on\nbrightly, \"Neat job too, I give you credit for that, but why the hell\ndid you have to set the guy afire?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\n    _We are always, thanks to our human nature, potential criminals.\n    None of us stands outside humanity's black collective shadow._\n\n                                        --The Undiscovered Self,\n                                                        _by Carl Jung_\n\n\nOrdinarily scroungers who hide around on the outskirts until the\nkilling's done and then come in to share the loot get what they\ndeserve--wordless orders, well backed up, to be on their way at once.\nSometimes they even catch an after-clap of the murder urge, if it hasn't\nall been expended on the first victim or victims. Yet they _will_ do it,\ntrusting I suppose to the irresistible glamor of their personalities.\nThere were several reasons why we didn't at once give Pop this\ntreatment.\n\nIn the first place we didn't neither of us have our distance weapons. My\nrevolver and her dart gun were both tucked in the cave back at the edge\nof the freeway. And there's one bad thing about a bugger so knife-happy\nhe lugs them around by the carload--he's generally good at tossing them.\nWith his dozen or so knives Pop definitely outgunned us.\n\nSecond, we were both of us without the use of an arm. That's right, the\nboth of us. My right arm still dangled like a string of sausages and I\ncouldn't yet feel any signs of it coming undead. While she'd burned her\nfingers badly grabbing at the gun--I could see their red-splotched tips\nnow as she pulled them out of her mouth for a second to wipe the Pilot's\nblood out of her eyes. All she had was her stump with the knife screwed\nto it. Me, I can throw a knife left-handed if I have to, but you bet I\nwasn't going to risk Mother that way.\n\nThen I'd no sooner heard Pop's voice, breathy and a little high like an\nold man's will get, than it occurred to me that he must have been the\none who had given the funny scream that had distracted the Pilot's\nattention and let us get him. Which incidentally made Pop a quick\nthinker and imaginative to boot, and meant that he'd helped on the\nkilling.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBesides all that, Pop did not come in fawning and full of extravagant\npraise, as most scroungers will. He just assumed equality with us right\nfrom the start and he talked in an absolutely matter-of-fact way,\nneither praising nor criticizing one bit--too damn matter-of-fact and\nopen, for that matter, to suit my taste, but then I have heard other\nbuggers say that some old men are apt to get talkative, though I had\nnever worked with or run into one myself. Old people are very rare in\nthe Deathlands, as you might imagine.\n\nSo the girl and me just scowled at him but did nothing to stop him as he\ncame along. Near us, his extra knives would be no advantage to him.\n\n\"Hum,\" he said, \"looks a lot like a guy I murdered five years back down\nLos Alamos way. Same silver monkey suit and almost as tall. Nice chap\ntoo--was trying to give me something for a fever I'd faked. That his gun\nmelted? My man didn't smoke after I gave him his quietus, but then it\nturned out he didn't have any metal on him. I wonder if this chap--\" He\nstarted to kneel down by the body.\n\n\"Hands off, Pop!\" I gritted at him. That was how we started calling him\nPop.\n\n\"Why sure, sure,\" he said, staying there on one knee. \"I won't lay a\nfinger on him. It's just that I've heard the Alamosers have it rigged so\nthat any metal they're carrying melts when they die, and I was wondering\nabout this boy. But he's all yours, friend. By the way, what's your\nname, friend?\"\n\n\"Ray,\" I snarled. \"Ray Baker.\" I think the main reason I told him was\nthat I didn't want him calling me \"friend\" again. \"You talk too much,\nPop.\"\n\n\"I suppose I do, Ray,\" he agreed. \"What's your name, lady?\"\n\nThe girl just sort of hissed at him and he grinned at me as if to say,\n\"Oh, women!\" Then he said, \"Why don't you go through his pockets, Ray?\nI'm real curious.\"\n\n\"Shut up,\" I said, but I felt that he'd put me on the spot just the\nsame. I was curious about the guy's pockets myself, of course, but I was\nalso wondering if Pop was alone or if he had somebody with him, and\nwhether there was anybody else in the plane or not--things like that,\ntoo many things. At the same time I didn't want to let on to Pop how\nuseless my right arm was--if I'd just get a twinge of feeling in that\narm, I knew I'd feel a lot more confident fast. I knelt down across the\nbody from him, started to lay Mother aside and then hesitated.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe girl gave me an encouraging look, as if to say, \"I'll take care of\nthe old geezer.\" On the strength of her look I put down Mother and\nstarted to pry open the Pilot's left hand, which was clenched in a fist\nthat looked a mite too big to have nothing inside it.\n\nThe girl started to edge behind Pop, but he caught the movement right\naway and looked at her with a grin that was so knowing and yet so\nfriendly, and yet so pitying at the same time--with the pity of the old\npro for even the seasoned amateur--that in her place I think I'd have\nblushed myself, as she did now ... through the streaks of the Pilot's\nblood.\n\n\"You don't have to worry none about me, lady,\" he said, running a hand\nthrough his white hair and incidentally touching the pommel of one of\nthe two knives strapped high on the back of his jacket so he could reach\none over either shoulder. \"I quit murdering some years back. It got to\nbe too much of a strain on my nerves.\"\n\n\"Oh yeah?\" I couldn't help saying as I pried up the Pilot's index finger\nand started on the next. \"Then why the stab-factory, Pop?\"\n\n\"Oh you mean those,\" he said, glancing down at his knives. \"Well, the\nfact is, Ray, I carry them to impress buggers dumber than you and the\nlady here. Anybody wants to think I'm still a practicing murderer I got\nno objections. Matter of sentiment, too, I just hate to part with\nthem--they bring back important memories. And then--you won't believe\nthis, Ray, but I'm going to tell you just the same--guys just up and\ngive me their knives and I doubly hate to part with a gift.\"\n\nI wasn't going to say \"Oh yeah?\" again or \"Shut up!\" either, though I\ncertainly wished I could turn off Pop's spigot, or thought I did. Then I\nfelt a painful tingling shoot down my right arm. I smiled at Pop and\nsaid, \"Any other reasons?\"\n\n\"Yep,\" he said. \"Got to shave and I might as well do it in style. A new\nblade every day in the fortnight is twice as good as the old ads. You\nknow, it makes you keep a knife in fine shape if you shave with it. What\nyou got there, Ray?\"\n\n\"You were wrong, Pop,\" I said. \"He did have some metal on him that\ndidn't melt.\"\n\nI held up for them to see the object I'd extracted from his left fist:\na bright steel cube measuring about an inch across each side, but it\nfelt lighter than if it were solid metal. Five of the faces looked\nabsolutely bare. The sixth had a round button recessed in it.\n\nFrom the way they looked at it neither Pop nor the girl had the faintest\nidea of what it was. I certainly hadn't.\n\n\"Had he pushed the button?\" the girl asked. Her voice was throaty but\nunexpectedly refined, as if she'd done no talking at all, not even to\nherself, since coming to the Deathlands and so retained the cultured\nintonations she'd had earlier, whenever and wherever that had been. It\ngave me a funny feeling, of course, because they were the first words\nI'd heard her speak.\n\n\"Not from the way he was holding it,\" I told her. \"The button was\npointed up toward his thumb but the thumb was on the outside of his\nfingers.\" I felt an unexpected satisfaction at having expressed myself\nso clearly and I told myself not to get childish.\n\nThe girl slitted her eyes. \"Don't you push it, Ray,\" she said.\n\n\"Think I'm nuts?\" I told her, meanwhile sliding the cube into the\nsmaller pocket of my pants, where it fit tight and wouldn't turn\nsideways and the button maybe get pressed by accident. The tingling in\nmy right arm was almost unbearable now, but I was getting control over\nthe muscles again.\n\n\"Pushing that button,\" I added, \"might melt what's left of the plane, or\nblow us all up.\" It never hurts to emphasize that you may have another\nweapon in your possession, even if it's just a suicide bomb.\n\n\"There was a man pushed another button once,\" Pop said softly and\nreflectively. His gaze went far out over the Deathlands and took in a\ngood half of the horizon and he slowly shook his head. Then his face\nbrightened. \"Did you know, Ray,\" he said, \"that I actually met that man?\nLong afterwards. You don't believe me, I know, but I actually did. Tell\nyou about it some other time.\"\n\nI almost said, \"Thanks, Pop, for sparing me at least for a while,\" but I\nwas afraid that would set him off again. Besides, it wouldn't have been\nquite true. I've heard other buggers tell the yarn of how they met (and\ninvariably rubbed out) the actual guy who pushed the button or buttons\nthat set the fusion missiles blasting toward their targets, but I felt a\nsudden curiosity as to what Pop's version of the yarn would be. Oh well,\nI could ask him some other time, if we both lived that long. I started\nto check the Pilot's pockets. My right hand could help a little now.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Those look like mean burns you got there, lady,\" I heard Pop tell the\ngirl. He was right. There were blisters easy to see on three of the\nfingertips. \"I've got some salve that's pretty good,\" he went on, \"and\nsome clean cloth. I could put on a bandage for you if you wanted. If\nyour hand started to feel poisoned you could always tell Ray here to\nslip a knife in me.\"\n\nPop was a cute gasser, you had to admit. I reminded myself that it was\nPop's business to play up to the both of us, charm being the secret\nweapon of all scroungers.\n\nThe girl gave a harsh little laugh. \"Very well,\" she said, \"but we will\nuse my salve, I know it works for me.\" And she started to lead Pop to\nwhere we'd hidden our things.\n\n\"I'll go with you,\" I told them, standing up.\n\nIt didn't look like we were going to have any more murders today--Pop\nhad got through the preliminary ingratiations pretty well and the girl\nand me had had our catharsis--but that would be no excuse for any such\nstupidity as letting the two of them get near my .38.\n\nStrolling to the cave and back I eased the situation a bit more by\nsaying, \"That scream you let off, Pop, really helped. I don't know what\ngave you the idea, but thanks.\"\n\n\"Oh that,\" he said. \"Forget about it.\"\n\n\"I won't,\" I told him. \"You may say you've quit killing, but helped on a\ndo-in today.\"\n\n\"Ray,\" he said a little solemnly, \"if it'll make you feel any happier,\nI'll take a bit of the responsibility for every murder that's been done\nsince the beginning of time.\"\n\nI looked at him for a while. Then, \"Pop, you're not by any chance the\nreligious type?\" I asked suddenly.\n\n\"Lord, no,\" he told us.\n\nThat struck me as a satisfactory answer. God preserve me from the\nreligious type! We have quite a few of those in the Deathlands. It\ngenerally means that they try to convert you to something before they\nkill you. Or sometimes afterwards.\n\nWe completed our errands. I felt a lot more secure with Old Financier's\nFriend strapped to my middle. Mother is wonderful but she is not enough.\n\nI dawdled over inspecting the Pilot's pockets, partly to give my right\nhand time to come back all the way. And to tell the truth I didn't much\nenjoy the job--a corpse, especially such a handsome cadaver as this,\njust didn't go with Pop's brand of light patter.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPop did up the girl's hand in high style, bandaging each finger\nseparately and then persuading her to put on a big left-hand work glove\nhe took out of his small pack.\n\n\"Lost the right,\" he explained, \"which was the only one I ever used\nanyway. Never knew until now why I kept this. How does it feel, Alice?\"\n\nI might have known he'd worm her name out of her. It occurred to me that\nPop's ideas of scrounging might extend to Alice's favors. The urge\ndoesn't die out when you get old, they tell me. Not completely.\n\nHe'd also helped her replace the knife on her stump with the hook.\n\nBy that time I'd poked into all the Pilot's pockets I could get at\nwithout stripping him and found nothing but three irregularly shaped\nblobs of metal, still hot to the touch. Under the charred spots, of\ncourse.\n\nI didn't want the job of stripping him. Somebody else could do a little\nwork, I told myself. I've been bothered by bodies before (as who hasn't,\nI suppose?) but this one was really beginning to make me sick. Maybe I\nwas cracking up, it occurred to me. Murder is a very wearing business,\nas all Deathlanders know, and although some crack earlier than others,\nall crack in the end.\n\nI must have been showing how I was feeling because, \"Cheer up, Ray,\" Pop\nsaid. \"You and Alice have done a big murder--I'd say the subject was six\nfoot ten--so you ought to be happy. You've drawn a blank on his pockets\nbut there's still the plane.\"\n\n\"Yeah, that's right,\" I said, brightening a little. \"There's still the\nstuff in the plane.\" I knew there were some items I couldn't hope for,\nlike .38 shells, but there'd be food and other things.\n\n\"Nuh-uh,\" Pop corrected me. \"I said _the plane_. You may have thought\nit's wrecked, but I don't. Have you taken a real gander at it? It's\nworth doing, believe me.\"\n\nI jumped up. My heart was suddenly pounding. I was glad of an excuse to\nget away from the body, but there was a lot more in my feelings than\nthat. I was filled with an excitement to which I didn't want to give a\nname because it would make the let-down too great.\n\nOne of the wide stubby wings of the plane, raking downward so that its\ntip almost touched the concrete, had hidden the undercarriage of the\nfuselage from our view. Now, coming around the wing, I saw that _there\nwas no undercarriage_.\n\nI had to drop to my hands and knees and scan around with my cheek next\nto the concrete before I'd believe it. _The \"wrecked\" plane was at all\npoints at least six inches off the ground._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI got to my feet again. I was shaking. I wanted to talk but I couldn't.\nI grabbed the leading edge of the wing to stop from falling. The whole\nbody of the plane gave a fraction of an inch and then resisted my\nleaning weight with lazy power, just like a gyroscope.\n\n\"Antigravity,\" I croaked, though you couldn't have heard me two feet.\nThen my voice came back. \"Pop, Alice! They got antigravity!\nAntigravity--and it's working!\"\n\nAlice had just come around the wing and was facing me. She was shaking\ntoo and her face was white like I knew mine was. Pop was politely\nstanding off a little to one side, watching us curiously. \"Told you\nyou'd won a real prize,\" he said in his matter-of-fact way.\n\nAlice wet her lips. \"Ray,\" she said, \"we can get away.\"\n\nJust those four words, but they did it. Something in me unlocked--no,\nexploded describes it better.\n\n\"We can go places!\" I almost shouted.\n\n\"Beyond the dust,\" she said. \"Mexico City. South America!\" She was\nforgetting the Deathlander's cynical article of belief that the dust\nnever ends, but then so was I. It makes a difference whether or not\nyou've got a means of doing something.\n\n\"Rio!\" I topped her with. \"The Indies. Hong Kong. Bombay. Egypt.\nBermuda. The French Riviera!\"\n\n\"Bullfights and clean beds,\" she burst out with. \"Restaurants. Swimming\npools. Bathrooms!\"\n\n\"Skindiving,\" I took it up with, as hysterical as she was. \"Road races\nand roulette tables.\"\n\n\"Bentleys and Porsches!\"\n\n\"Aircoups and DC4s and Comets!\"\n\n\"Martinis and hashish and ice cream sodas!\"\n\n\"Hot food! Fresh coffee! Gambling, smoking, dancing, music, drinks!\" I\nwas going to add _women_, but then I thought of how hard-bitten little\nAlice would look beside the dream creatures I had in mind. I tactfully\nsuppressed the word but I filed the idea away.\n\nI don't think either of us knew exactly what we were saying. Alice in\nparticular I don't believe was old enough to have experienced almost any\nof the things the words referred to. They were mysterious symbols of\nlong-interdicted delights spewing out of us.\n\n\"Ray,\" Alice said, hurrying to me, \"let's get aboard.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said eagerly and then I saw a little problem. The door to the\nplane was a couple of feet above our heads. Whoever hoisted himself up\nfirst--or got hoisted up, as would have to be the case with Alice on\naccount of her hand--would be momentarily at the other's mercy. I guess\nit occurred to Alice too because she stopped and looked at me. It was a\nlittle like the old teaser about the fox, the goose, and the corn.\n\nMaybe, too, we were both a little scared the plane was booby-trapped.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPop solved the problem in the direct way I might have expected of him by\nstepping quietly between us, giving a light leap, catching hold of the\ncurving sill, chinning himself on it, and scrambling up into the plane\nso quickly that we'd hardly have had time to do anything about it if\nwe'd wanted to. Pop couldn't be much more than a bantamweight, even with\nall his knives. The plane sagged an inch and then swung up again.\n\nAs Pop disappeared from view I backed off, reaching for my .38, but a\nmoment later he stuck out his head and grinned down at us, resting his\nelbows on the sill.\n\n\"Come on up,\" he said. \"It's quite a place. I promise not to push any\nbuttons 'til you get here, though there's whole regiments of them.\"\n\nI grinned back at Pop and gave Alice a boost up. She didn't like it, but\nshe could see it had to be her next. She hooked onto the sill and Pop\ncaught hold of her left wrist below the big glove and heaved.\n\nThen it was my turn. I didn't like it. I didn't like the idea of those\ntwo buggers poised above me while my hands were helpless on the sill.\nBut I thought _Pop's a nut. You can trust a nut, at least a little ways,\nthough you can't trust nobody else._ I heaved myself up. It was strange\nto feel the plane giving and then bracing itself like something alive.\nIt seemed to have no trouble accepting our combined weight, which after\nall was hardly more than half again the Pilot's.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nInside the cabin was pretty small but as Pop had implied, oh my!\nEverything looked soft and smoothly curved, like you imagine your\ninsides being, and almost everything was a restfully dull silver. The\ngeneral shape of it was something like the inside of an egg. Forward,\nwhich was the larger end, were a couple of screens and a wide viewport\nand some small dials and the button brigades Pop had mentioned, lined up\nlike blank typewriter keys but enough for writing Chinese.\n\nJust aft of the instrument panel were two very comfortable-looking\nstrange low seats. They seemed to be facing backwards until I realized\nthey were meant to be knelt into. The occupant, I could see, would sort\nof sprawl forward, his hands free for button-pushing and such. There\nwere spongy chinrests.\n\nAft was a tiny instrument panel and a kind of sideways seat, not nearly\nso fancy. The door by which we'd entered was to the side, a little aft.\n\nI didn't see any indications of cabinets or fixed storage spaces of any\nkinds, but somehow stuck to the walls here and there were quite a few\nsmooth blobby packages, mostly dull silver too, some large, some\nsmall--valises and handbags, you might say.\n\nAll in all, it was a lovely cabin and, more than that, it seemed lived\nin. It looked as if it had been shaped for, and maybe by one man. It had\na personality you could feel, a strong but warm personality of its own.\n\nThen I realized whose personality it was. I almost got sick--so close to\nit I started telling myself it must be something antigravity did to your\nstomach.\n\nBut it was all too interesting to let you get sick right away. Pop was\npoking into two of the large mound-shaped cases that were sitting loose\nand open on the right-hand seat, as if ready for emergency use. One had\na folded something with straps on it that was probably a parachute. The\nsecond had I judged a thousand or more of the inch cubes such as I'd\npried out of the Pilot's hand, all neatly stacked in a cubical box\ninside the soft outer bag. You could see the one-cube gap where he'd\ntaken the one.\n\nI decided to take the rest of the bags off the walls and open them, if I\ncould figure out how. The others had the same idea, but Alice had to\ntake off her hook and put on her pliers, before she could make progress.\nPop helped her. There was room enough for us to do these things without\ncrowding each other too closely.\n\nBy the time Alice was set to go I'd discovered the trick of getting the\nbags off. You couldn't pull them away from the wall no matter what force\nyou used, at least I couldn't, and you couldn't even slide them straight\nalong the walls, but if you just gave them a gentle counterclockwise\ntwist they came off like nothing. Twisting them clockwise glued them\nback on. It was very strange, but I told myself that if these boys could\ngenerate antigravity fields they could create screwy fields of other\nsorts.\n\nIt also occurred to me to wonder if \"these boys\" came from Earth. The\nPilot had looked human enough, but these accomplishments didn't--not by\nmy standards for human achievement in the Age of the Deaders. At any\nrate I had to admit to myself that my pet term \"cultural queer\" did not\ndescribe to my own satisfaction members of a culture which could create\nthings like this cabin. Not that I liked making the admission. It's hard\nto admit an exception to a pet gripe against things.\n\nThe excitement of getting down and opening the Christmas packages saved\nme from speculating too much along these or any other lines.\n\nI hit a minor jackpot right away. In the same bag were a compass, a\ncatalytic pocket lighter, a knife with a saw-tooth back edge that made\nmy affection for Mother waver, a dust mask, what looked like a compact\nwater-filtration unit, and several other items adding up to a deluxe\nDeathlands Survival Kit.\n\nThere were some goggles in the kit I didn't savvy until I put them on\nand surveyed the landscape out the viewport. A nearby dust drift I knew\nto be hot glowed green as death in the slightly smoky lenses. Wow! Those\nspecs had Geiger counters beat a mile and I privately bet myself they\nworked at night. I stuck them in my pocket quick.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe found bunches of tiny electronics parts--I think they were; spools of\nmagnetic tape, but nothing to play it on; reels of very narrow film with\nframes much too small to see anything at all unmagnified; about three\nthousand cigarettes in unlabeled transparent packs of twenty--we lit up\nquick, using my new lighter; a picture book that didn't make much sense\nbecause the views might have been of tissue sections or starfields, we\ncouldn't quite decide, and there were no captions to help; a thin book\nwith ricepaper pages covered with Chinese characters--_that_ was a\npuzzler; a thick book with nothing but columns of figures, all zeros and\nones and nothing else; some tiny chisels; and a mouth organ. Pop, who'd\nmake a point of just helping in the hunt, appropriated that last item--I\nmight have known he would, I told myself. Now we could expect \"Turkey in\nthe Straw\" at odd moments.\n\nAlice found a whole bag of what were women's things judging from the\nfrilliness of the garments included. She set aside some squeeze-packs\nand little gadgets and elastic items right away, but she didn't take any\nof the clothes. I caught her measuring some kind of transparent chemise\nagainst herself when she thought we weren't looking; it was for a girl\nmaybe six sizes bigger.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd we found food. Cans of food that was heated up inside by the time\nyou got the top rolled off, though the outside could still be cool to\nthe touch. Cans of boneless steak, boneless chops, cream soup, peas,\ncarrots, and fried potatoes--they weren't labeled at all but you could\ngenerally guess the contents from the shape of the can. Eggs that heated\nwhen you touched them and were soft-boiled evenly and barely firm by the\ntime you had the shell broke. And small plastic bottles of strong coffee\nthat heated up hospitably too--in this case the tops did a five-second\nhesitation in the middle of your unscrewing them.\n\nAt that point as you can imagine we let the rest of the packages go and\nhad ourselves a feast. The food ate even better than it smelled. It was\nreal hard for me not to gorge.\n\nThen as I was slurping down my second bottle of coffee I happened to\nlook out the viewport and see the Pilot's body and the darkening puddle\naround it and the coffee began to taste, well, not bad, but sickening. I\ndon't think it was guilty conscience. Deathlanders outgrow those if they\never have them to start with; loners don't keep consciences--it takes\ncultures to give you those and make them work. Artistic\ninappropriateness is the closest I can come to describing what bothered\nme. Whatever it was, it made me feel lousy for a minute.\n\nAbout the same time Alice did an odd thing with the last of _her_\ncoffee. She slopped it on a rag and used it to wash her face. I guess\nshe'd caught a reflection of herself with the blood smears. She didn't\neat any more after that either. Pop kept on chomping away, a slow feeder\nand appreciative.\n\nTo be doing something I started to inspect the instrument panel and\nright away I was all excited again. The two screens were what got me.\nThey showed shadowy maps, one of North America, the other of the World.\nThe first one was a whole lot like the map I'd been imagining\nearlier--faint colors marked the small \"civilized\" areas including one\nin Eastern Canada and another in Upper Michigan that must be \"countries\"\nI didn't know about, and the Deathlands were real dark just as I'd\nalways maintained they should be!\n\nSouth of Lake Michigan was a brightly luminous green point that must be\nwhere we were, I decided. And for some reason the colored areas\nrepresenting Los Alamos and Atlantic Highlands were glowing brighter\nthan the others--they had an active luminosity. Los Alamos was blue,\nAtla-Hi violet. Los Alamos was shown having more territory than I\nexpected. Savannah Fortress for that matter was a whole _lot_ bigger\nthan I'd have made it, pushing out pseudopods west and northeast along\nthe coast, though its red didn't have the extra glow. But its\ngrowth-pattern reeked of imperialism.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe World screen showed dim color patches too, but for the moment I was\nmore interested in the other.\n\nThe button armies marched right up to the lower edge of the screens and\nright away I got the crazy hunch that they were connected with spots on\nthe map. Push the button for a certain spot and the plane would go\nthere! Why, one button even seemed to have a faint violet nimbus around\nit (or else my eyes were going bad) as if to say, \"Push me and we go to\nAtlantic Highlands.\"\n\nA crazy notion as I say and no sensible way to handle a plane's\nnavigation according to any standards I could imagine, but then as I've\nalso said this plane didn't seem to be designed according to any\nstandards but rather in line with one man's ideas, including his whims.\n\nAt any rate that was my hunch about the buttons and the screens. It\ntantalized rather than helped, for the only button that seemed to be\nmarked in any way was the one (guessing by color) for Atlantic\nHighlands, and I certainly didn't want to go there. Like Alamos, Atla-Hi\nhas the reputation for being a mysteriously dangerous place. Not openly\nmean and death-on-Deathlanders like Walla Walla or Porter, but buggers\nwho swing too close to Atla-Hi have a way of never turning up again. You\nnever expect to see again two out of three buggers who pass in the\nnight, but for three out of three to keep disappearing is against\nstatistics.\n\nAlice was beside me now, scanning things over too, and from the way she\nfrowned and what not I gathered she had caught my hunch and also shared\nmy puzzlement.\n\nNow was the time, all right, when we needed an instruction manual and\nnot one in Chinese neither!\n\nPop swallowed a mouthful and said, \"Yep, now'd be a good time to have\nhim back for a minute, to explain things a bit. Oh, don't take offense,\nRay, I know how it was for you and for you too, Alice. I know the both\nof you _had_ to murder him, it wasn't a matter of free choice, it's the\nway us Deathlanders are built. Just the same, it'd be nice to have a way\nof killing 'em and keeping them on hand at the same time. I remember\nfeeling that way after murdering the Alamoser I told you about. You see,\nI come down with the very fever I'd faked and almost died of it, while\nthe man who could have cured me easy wouldn't do nothing but perfume the\nlandscape with the help of a gang of anaerobic bacteria. Stubborn\nsingle-minded cuss!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe first part of that oration started up my sickness again and irked me\nnot a little. Dammit, what right had Pop to talk about how all us\nDeathlanders _had to_ kill (which was true enough and by itself would\nhave made me cotton to him) if as he'd claimed earlier _he'd_ been able\nto quit killing? Pop was, an old hypocrite, I told myself--he'd helped\nmurder the Pilot, he'd admitted as much--and Alice and me'd be better\noff if we bedded the both of them down together. But then the second\npart of what Pop said so made me want to feel pleasantly sorry for\nmyself and laugh at the same time that I forgave the old geezer.\nPractically everything Pop said had that reassuring touch of insanity\nabout it.\n\nSo it was Alice who said, \"Shut up, Pop\"--and rather casually at\nthat--and she and me went on to speculate and then to argue about which\nbuttons we ought to push, if any and in what order.\n\n\"Why not just start anywhere and keep pushing 'em one after\nanother?--you're going to have to eventually, may as well start now,\"\nwas Pop's light-hearted contribution to the discussion. \"Got to take\nsome chances in this life.\" He was sitting in the back seat and still\nnibbling away like a white-topped mangy old squirrel.\n\nOf course Alice and me knew more than that. We kept making guesses as to\nhow the buttons worked and then backing up our guesses with hot\nlanguage. It was a little like two savages trying to decide how to play\nchess by looking at the pieces. And then the old escape-to-paradise\ntheme took hold of us again and we studied the colored blobs on the\nWorld screen, trying to decide which would have the fanciest\naccommodations for blase ex-murderers. On the North America screen too\nthere was an intriguing pink patch in southern Mexico that seemed to\ntake in old Mexico City and Acapulco too.\n\n\"Quit talking and start pushing,\" Pop prodded us. \"This way you're\ngetting nowhere fast. I can't stand hesitation, it riles my nerves.\"\n\nAlice thought you ought to push ten buttons at once, using both hands,\nand she was working out patterns for me to try. But I was off on a kick\nabout how we should darken the plane to see if any of the other buttons\nglowed beside the one with the Atla-Hi violet.\n\n\"Look here, you killed a big man to get this plane,\" Pop broke in,\ncoming up behind me. \"Are you going to use it for discussion groups or\nare you going to fly it?\"\n\n\"Quiet,\" I told him. I'd got a new hunch and was using the dark glasses\nto scan the instrument panel. They didn't show anything.\n\n\"Dammit, I can't stand this any more,\" Pop said and reached a hand and\narm between us and brought it down on about fifty buttons, I'd judge.\n\nThe other buttons just went down and up, but the Atla-Hi button went\ndown and stayed down.\n\nThe violet blob of Atla-Hi on the screen got even brighter in the next\nfew moments.\n\nThe door closed with a tiny thud.\n\nWe took off.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\n    _Any man who deals in murder, must have very incorrect ways of\n    thinking, and truly inaccurate principles._\n\n                                        --_Thomas de Quincey in_\n                                                  Murder Considered as\n                                                  One of the Fine Arts\n\n\nFor that matter we took off _fast_ with the plane swinging to beat hell.\nAlice and me was in the two kneeling seats and we hugged them tight, but\nPop was loose and sort of rattled around the cabin for a while--and\nserve him right!\n\nOn one of the swings I caught a glimpse of the seven dented gas tanks,\nlooking like dull crescents from this angle through the orange haze and\ngetting rapidly smaller as they hazed out.\n\nAfter a while the plane levelled off and quit swinging, and a while\nafter that my image of the cabin quit swinging too. Once again I just\nmanaged to stave off the vomits, this time the vomits from natural\ncauses. Alice looked very pale around the gills and kept her face buried\nin the chinrest of her chair.\n\nPop ended up right in our faces, sort of spread-eagled against the\ninstrument panel. In getting himself off it he must have braced his\nhands against half the buttons at one time or another and I noticed that\nnone of them went down a fraction. They were _locked_. It had probably\nhappened automatically when the Atla-Hi button got pushed.\n\nI'd have stopped him messing around in that apish way, but with the\nultra-queasy state of my stomach I lacked all ambition and was happy\njust not to be smelling him so close.\n\nI still wasn't taking too great an interest in things as I idly watched\nthe old geezer rummaging around the cabin for something that got\nmisplaced in the shake-up. Eventually he found it--a small almond-shaped\ncan. He opened it. Sure enough it turned out to have almonds in it. He\nfitted himself in the back seat and munched them one at a time. Ish!\n\n\"Nothing like a few nuts to top off with,\" he said cheerfully.\n\nI could have cut his throat even more cheerfully, but the damage had\nbeen done and you think twice before you kill a person in close quarters\nwhen you aren't absolutely sure you'll be able to dispose of the body.\nHow did I know I'd be able to open the door? I remember philosophizing\nthat Pop ought at least to have broke an arm so he'd be as badly off as\nAlice and me (though for that matter my right arm was fully recovered\nnow) but he was all in one piece. There's no justice in events, that's\nfor sure.\n\nThe plane ploughed along silently through the orange soup, though there\nwas really no way to tell it was moving now--until a skewy spindle shape\nloomed up ahead and shot back over the viewport. I think it was a\nvulture. I don't know how vultures manage to operate in the haze, which\nought to cancel their keen eyesight, but they do. It shot past _fast_.\n\nAlice lifted her face out of the sponge stuff and began to study the\nbuttons again. I heaved myself up and around a little and said, \"Pop,\nAlice and me are going to try to work out how this plane navigates. This\ntime we don't want no interference.\" I didn't say a word more about what\nhe'd done. It never does to hash over stupidities.\n\n\"That's perfectly fine, go right ahead,\" he told me. \"I feel calm as a\nkitten now we're going somewheres. That's all that ever matters with\nme.\" He chuckled a bit and added, \"You got to admit I gave you and Alice\nsomething to work with,\" but then he had the sense to shut up tight.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe weren't so chary of pushing buttons this time, but ten minutes or so\nconvinced us that you couldn't push any of the buttons any more, they\n_were_ all locked down--all locked except for maybe one, which we didn't\ntry at first for a special reason.\n\nWe looked for other controls--sticks, levers, pedals, finger-holes and\nthe like. There weren't any. Alice went back and tried the buttons on\nPop's minor console. They were locked too. Pop looked interested but\ndidn't say a word.\n\nWe realized in a general way what had happened, of course. Pushing the\nAtla-Hi button had set us on some kind of irreversible automatic. I\ncouldn't imagine the why of gimmicking a plane's controls like that,\nunless maybe to keep loose children or prisoners from being able to mess\nthings up while the pilot took a snooze, but there were a lot of whys to\nthis plane that didn't seem to have any standard answers.\n\nThe business of taking off on irreversible automatic had happened so\nneatly that I naturally wondered whether Pop might not know more about\nnavigating this plane than he let on, a whole lot more in fact, and the\nseemingly idiotic petulance of his pushing all the buttons have been a\nshrewd cover for pushing the Atla-Hi button. But if Pop had been acting\nhe'd been acting beautifully, with a serene disregard for the chances of\nbreaking his own neck. I decided this was a possibility I could think\nabout later and maybe act on then, after Alice and me had worked through\nthe more obvious stuff.\n\nThe reason we hadn't tried the one button yet was that it showed a green\nnimbus, just like the Atla-Hi button had had a violet nimbus. Now there\nwas no green on either of the screens except for the tiny green star\nthat I had figured stood for the plane and it didn't make sense to go\nwhere we already were. And if it meant some other place, some place not\nshown on the screens, you bet we weren't going to be too quick about\ndeciding to go there. It might not be on Earth.\n\nAlice expressed it by saying, \"My namesake was always a little too quick\nat responding to those DRINK ME cues.\"\n\nI suppose she thought she was being cryptic, but I fooled her. \"_Alice\nin Wonderland_?\" I asked. She nodded, and gave me a little smile, not at\nall like one of the EAT ME smiles she'd given me last evening.\n\nIt is funny how crazily happy a little touch of the intellectual past\nlike that can make you feel--and how horribly uncomfortable a moment\nlater.\n\nWe both started to study the North America screen again and almost at\nonce we realized that it had changed in one small particular. The green\nstar had twinned. Where there had been one point of green light there\nwere now two, very close together like the double star in the handle of\nthe Dipper. We watched it for a while. The distance between the two\nstars grew perceptibly greater. We watched it for a while longer,\nconsiderably longer. It became clear that the position of the more\nwesterly star on the screen was fixed, while the more easterly star was\nmoving east toward Atla-Hi with about the speed of the tip of the minute\nhand on a wrist watch (two inches an hour, say). The pattern began to\nmake sense.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI figured it this way: the moving star must stand for the plane, the\nother green dot must stand for where the plane had just been. For some\nreason the spot on the freeway by the old cracking plant was recognized\nas a marked locality by the screen. Why I don't know. It reminded me of\nthe old \"X Marks the Spot\" of newspaper murders, but that would be\ngetting very fancy. Anyway the spot we'd just taken off from was so\nmarked and in that case the button with the green nimbus ...\n\n\"Hold tight, everybody,\" I said to Alice, grudgingly including Pop in my\nwarning. \"I got to try it.\"\n\nI gripped my seat with my knees and one arm and pushed the green\nbutton. It pushed.\n\nThe plane swung around in a level loop, not too tight to disturb the\nstomach much, and steadied out again.\n\nI couldn't judge how far we'd swung but Alice and me watched the green\nstars and after about a minute she said, \"They're getting closer,\" and a\nlittle while later I said, \"Yeah, for sure.\"\n\nI scanned the board. The green button--the cracking-plant button, to\ncall it that--was locked down of course. The Atla-Hi button was up,\nglowing violet. All the other buttons were still up and _locked_ up--I\ntried them all again.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was clear as day used to be. We could either go to Atla-Hi or we\ncould go back where we'd started from. There was no third possibility.\n\nIt was a little hard to take. You think of a plane as freedom, as\nsomething that will carry you anywhere in the world you choose to go,\nespecially any paradise, and then you find yourself worse limited than\nif you'd stayed on the ground--at least that was the way it was\nhappening to us.\n\nBut Alice and me were realists. We knew it wouldn't help to wail. We\nwere up against another of those \"two\" problems, the problem of two\ndestinations, and we had to choose ours.\n\n_If we go back_, I thought, _we can trek on somewhere--anywhere--richer\nby the loot from the plane, especially that Survival Kit. Trek on with\nsome loot we'll mostly never understand and with the knowledge that we\nare leaving a plane that can fly, that we are shrinking back from an\nunknown adventure_.\n\n_Also if we go back there's something else we'll have to face, something\nwe'll have to live with for a little while at least that won't be nice\nto live with after this cozily personal cabin, something that shouldn't\nbother me at all but, dammit, it does._\n\nAlice made the decision for us and at the same time showed she was\nthinking about the same thing as me.\n\n\"I don't want to have to smell him, Ray,\" she said. \"I am not going back\nto keep company with that filthy corpse. I'd rather anything than that.\"\nAnd she pushed the Atla-Hi button again and as the plane started to\nswing she looked at me defiantly as if to say I'd reverse the course\nagain over her dead body.\n\n\"Don't tense up,\" I told her. \"I want a new shake of the dice myself.\"\n\n\"You know, Alice,\" Pop said reflectively, \"it was the smell of my\nAlamoser got to me too. I just couldn't bear it. I couldn't get away\nfrom it because my fever had me pinned down, so there was nothing left\nfor me to do but go crazy. No Atla-Hi for me, just Bug-land. My mind\ndied, though not my memory. By the time I'd got my strength back I'd\nstarted to be a new bugger. I didn't know no more about living than a\nnewborn babe, except I knew I couldn't go back--go back to murdering\nand all that. My new mind knew that much though otherwise it was just a\nblank. It was all very funny.\"\n\n\"And then I suppose,\" Alice cut in, her voice corrosive with sarcasm,\n\"you hunted up a wandering preacher, or perhaps a kindly old hermit who\nlived on hot manna, and he showed you the blue sky!\"\n\n\"Why no, Alice,\" Pop said. \"I told you I don't go for religion. As it\nhappens, I hunted me up a couple of murderers, guys who were worse cases\nthen myself but who'd wanted to quit because it wasn't getting them\nnowhere and who'd found, I'd heard, a way of quitting, and the three of\nus had a long talk together.\"\n\n\"And they told you the great secret of how to live in the Deathlands\nwithout killing,\" Alice continued acidly. \"Drop the nonsense, Pop. It\ncan't be done.\"\n\n\"It's hard, I'll grant you,\" Pop said. \"You have to go crazy or\nsomething almost as bad--in fact, maybe going crazy is the easiest way.\nBut it can be done and, in the long run, murder is even harder.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI decided to interrupt this idle chatter. Since we were now definitely\nheaded for Atla-Hi and there was nothing to do until we got there,\nunless one of us got a brainstorm about the controls, it was time to\nstart on the less obvious stuff I'd tabled in my mind.\n\n\"Why are you on this plane, Pop?\" I asked sharply. \"What do you figure\non getting out of Alice and me?--and I don't mean the free meals.\"\n\nHe grinned. His teeth were white and even--plates, of course. \"Why,\nRay,\" he said, \"I was just giving Alice the reason. I like to talk to\nmurderers, practicing murderers preferred. I need to--_have_ to talk to\n'em, to keep myself straight. Otherwise I might start killing again and\nI'm not up to that any more.\"\n\n\"Oh, so you get your kicks at second hand, you old peeper,\" Alice put in\nbut, \"Quit lying, Pop,\" I said. \"About having quit killing, for one\nthing. In my books, which happen to be the old books in this case, the\naccomplice is every bit as guilty as the man with the slicer. You helped\nus kill the Pilot by giving that funny scream and you know it.\"\n\n\"Who says I did?\" Pop countered, rearing up a little. \"I never said so.\nI just said, 'Forget it.'\" He hesitated a moment, studying me. Then he\nsaid, \"I wasn't the one gave that scream. In fact, I'd have stopped it\nif I'd been able.\"\n\n\"Who did then?\"\n\nAgain he studied me as he hesitated. \"I'm not telling,\" he said,\nsettling back.\n\n\"Pop!\" I said, sharp again. \"Buggers who pad together tell everything.\"\n\n\"Oh yeah,\" he agreed, smiling. \"I remember saying that to quite a few\nguys in my day. It's a very restful comradely sentiment. I killed every\nlast one of 'em, too.\"\n\n\"You may have, Pop,\" I granted, \"but we're two to one.\"\n\n\"So you are,\" he agreed softly, looking the both of us over. I knew what\nhe was thinking--that Alice still had just her pliers on and that in\nthese close quarters his knives were as good as my gun.\n\n\"Give me your right hand, Alice,\" I said. Without taking my eyes off Pop\nI reached the knife without a handle out of her belt and then I started\nto unscrew the pliers out of her stump.\n\n\"Pop,\" I said as I did so, \"you may have quit killing for all I know. I\nmean you may have quit killing clean decent Deathland style. But I don't\nbelieve one bit of that guff about having to talk to murderers to keep\nyour mind sweet. Furthermore--\"\n\n\"It's true though,\" he interrupted. \"I got to keep myself reminded of\nhow lousy it feels to be a murderer.\"\n\n\"So?\" I said. \"Well, here's one person who believes you've got a more\npractical reason for being on this plane. Pop, what's the bounty Atla-Hi\ngives you for every Deathlander you bring in? What would it be for two\nlive Deathlanders? And what sort of reward would they pay for a lost\nplane brought in? Seems to me they might very well make you a citizen\nfor that.\"\n\n\"Yes, even give you your own church,\" Alice added with a sort of wicked\ngaiety. I squeezed her stump gently to tell her let me handle it.\n\n\"Why, I guess you can believe that if you want to,\" Pop said and let out\na soft breath. \"Seems to me you need a lot of coincidences and\nhappenstances to make that theory hold water, but you sure can believe\nit if you want to. I got no way, Ray, to prove to you I'm telling the\ntruth except to say I am.\"\n\n\"Right,\" I said and then I threw the next one at him real fast. \"What's\nmore, Pop, weren't you traveling in this plane to begin with? That cuts\na happenstance. Didn't you hop out while we were too busy with the Pilot\nto notice and just _pretend_ to be coming from the cracking plant?\nWeren't the buttons locked because you were the Pilot's prisoner?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPop creased his brow thoughtfully. \"It could have been that way,\" he\nsaid at last. \"Could have been--according to the evidence as you saw it.\nIt's quite a bright idea, Ray. I can almost see myself skulking in this\ncabin, while you and Alice--\"\n\n\"You were skulking somewhere,\" I said. I finished screwing in the knife\nand gave Alice back her hand. \"I'll repeat it, Pop,\" I said. \"We're two\nto one. You'd better talk.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Alice added, disregarding my previous hint. \"You may have given\nup fighting, Pop, but I haven't. Not fighting, nor killing, nor anything\nin between those two. Any least thing.\" My girl was being her most\npantherish.\n\n\"Now who says I've given up _fighting_?\" Pop demanded, rearing a little\nagain. \"You people assume too much, it's a dangerous habit. Before we\nhave any trouble and somebody squawks about me cheating, let's get one\nthing straight. If anybody jumps me I'll try to disable them, I'll try\nto hurt them in any way short of killing, and that means hamstringing\nand rabbit-punching and everything else. Every least thing, Alice. And\nif they happen to die while I'm honestly just trying to hurt them in a\nway short of killing, then I won't grieve too much. My conscience will\nbe reasonably clear. Is that understood?\"\n\nI had to admit that it was. Pop might be lying about a lot of things,\nbut I just didn't believe he was lying about this. And I already knew\nPop was quick for his age and strong enough. If Alice and me jumped him\nnow there'd be blood let six different ways. You can't jump a man who\nhas a dozen knives easy to hand and not expect that to happen, two to\none or not. We'd get him in the end but it would be gory.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"And now,\" Pop said quietly, \"I _will_ talk a little if you don't mind.\nLook here, Ray ... Alice ... the two of you are confirmed murderers, I\nknow you wouldn't tell me nothing different, and being such you both\nknow that there's nothing in murder in the long run. It satisfies a\nhunger and maybe gets you a little loot and it lets you get on to the\nnext killing. But that's all, absolutely all. Yet you got to do it\nbecause it's the way you're built. The urge is there, it's an\noverpowering urge, and you got nothing to oppose it with. You feel the\nBig Grief and the Big Resentment, the dust is eating at your bones, you\ncan't stand the city squares--the Porterites and Mantenors and\nsuch--because you know they're whistling in the dark and it's a dirty\ntune, so you go on killing. But if there were a decent practical way to\nquit, you'd take it. At least I think you would. When you still thought\nthis plane could take you to Rio or Europe you felt that way, didn't\nyou? You weren't planning to go there as murderers, were you? You were\ngoing to leave your trade behind.\"\n\nIt was pretty quiet in the cabin for a couple of seconds. Then Alice's\nthin laugh sliced the silence. \"We were dreaming then,\" she said. \"We\nwere out of our heads. But now you're talking about practical things, as\nyou say. What do you expect us to do if we quit our trade, as you call\nit--go into Walla Walla or Ouachita and give ourselves up? I might lose\nmore than my right hand at Ouachita this time--that was just on\nsuspicion.\"\n\n\"Or Atla-Hi,\" I added meaningfully. \"Are you expecting us to admit we're\nmurderers when we get to Atla-Hi, Pop?\"\n\nThe old geezer smiled and thinned his eyes. \"Now that wouldn't\naccomplish much, would it? Most places they'd just string you up, maybe\nafter tickling your pain nerves a bit, or if it was Manteno they might\nput you in a cage and feed you slops and pray over you, and would that\nhelp you or anybody else? If a man or woman quits killing there's a lot\nof things he's got to straighten out--first his own mind and feelings,\nnext he's got to do what he can to make up for the murders he's\ndone--help the next of kin if any and so on--then he's got to carry the\nnews to other killers who haven't heard it yet. He's got no time to\nwaste being hanged. Believe me, he's got work lined up for him, work\nthat's got to be done mostly in the Deathlands, and it's the sort of\nwork the city squares can't help him with one bit, because they just\ndon't understand us murderers and what makes us tick. We have to do it\nourselves.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Hey, Pop,\" I cut in, getting a little interested in the argument (there\nwasn't anything else to get interested in until we got to Atla-Hi or Pop\nlet down his guard), \"I dig you on the city squares (I call 'em cultural\nqueers) and what sort of screwed-up fatheads they are, but just the same\nfor a man to quit killing he's got to quit lone-wolfing it. He's got to\nbelong to a community, he's got to have a culture of some sort, no\nmatter how disgusting or nutsy.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Pop said, \"don't us Deathlanders have a culture? With customs\nand folkways and all the rest? A very tight little culture, in fact.\nNutsy as all get out, of course, but that's one of the beauties of it.\"\n\n\"Oh sure,\" I granted him, \"but it's a culture based on murder and\ndevoted wholly to murder. Murder is our way of life. That gets your\nargument nowhere, Pop.\"\n\n\"Correction,\" he said. \"Or rather, re-interpretation.\" And now for a\nlittle while his voice got less old-man harsh and yet bigger somehow, as\nif it were more than just Pop talking. \"Every culture,\" he said, \"is a\nway of growth as well as a way of life, because the first law of life is\ngrowth. Our Deathland culture is devoted to growing _through_ murder\n_away from_ murder. That's my thought. It's about the toughest way of\ngrowth anybody was ever asked to face up to, but it's a way of growth\njust the same. A lot bigger and fancier cultures never could figure out\nthe answer to the problem of war and killing--_we_ know that, all right,\nwe inhabit their grandest failure. Maybe us Deathlanders, working with\nmurder every day, unable to pretend that it isn't part of every one of\nus, unable to put it out of our minds like the city squares do--maybe us\nDeathlanders are the ones to do that little job.\"\n\n\"But hell, Pop,\" I objected, getting excited in spite of myself, \"even\nif we got a culture here in the Deathlands, a culture that can grow, it\nain't a culture that can deal with repentant murderers. In a _real_\nculture a murderer feels guilty and confesses and then he gets hanged\nor imprisoned a long time and that squares things for him and everybody.\nYou need religion and courts and hangmen and screws and all the rest of\nit. I don't think it's enough for a man just to say he's sorry and go\naround glad-handing other killers--_that_ isn't going to be enough to\nwipe out his sense of guilt.\"\n\nPop squared his eyes at mine. \"Are you so fancy that you have to have a\nsense of guilt, Ray?\" he demanded. \"Can't you just see when something's\nlousy? A sense of guilt's a luxury. Of course it's not enough to say\nyou're sorry--you're going to have to spend a good part of the rest of\nyour life making up for what you've done ... and what you will do, too!\nBut about hanging and prisons--was it ever proved those were the right\nthing for murderers? As for religion now--some of us who've quit killing\nare religious and a lot of us (me included) aren't; and some of the ones\nthat are religious figure (maybe because there's no way for them to get\nhanged) that they're damned eternally--but that doesn't stop them doing\ngood work. I ask you now, is any little thing like being damned\neternally a satisfactory excuse for behaving like a complete rat?\"\n\nThat did it, somehow. That last statement of Pop's appealed so much to\nme and was completely crazy at the same time, that I couldn't help\nwarming up to him. Don't get me wrong, I didn't really fall for his line\nof chatter at all, but I found it fun to go along with it--so long as\nthe plane was in this shuttle situation and we had nothing better to do.\n\nAlice seemed to feel the same way. I guess any bugger that could kid\nreligion the way Pop could got a little silver star in her books.\nBronze, anyway.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRight away the atmosphere got easier. To start with we asked Pop to tell\nus about this \"us\" he kept mentioning and he said it was some dozens (or\nhundreds--nobody had accurate figures) of killers who'd quit and went\nnomading around the Deathlands trying to recruit others and help those\nwho wanted to be helped. They had semi-permanent meeting places where\nthey tried to get together at pre-arranged dates, but mostly they kept\non the go, by twos and threes or--more rarely--alone. They were all men\nso far, at least Pop hadn't heard of any women members, but--he assured\nAlice earnestly--he would personally guarantee that there would be no\nobjections to a girl joining up. They had recently taken to calling\nthemselves Murderers Anonymous, after some pre-war organization Pop\ndidn't know the original purpose of. Quite a few of them had slipped and\ngone back to murdering again, but some of these had come back after a\nwhile, more determined than ever to make a go of it.\n\n\"We welcomed 'em, of course,\" Pop said. \"We welcome everybody.\nEverybody that's a genuine murderer, that is, and says he wants to quit.\nGuys that aren't blooded yet we draw the line at, no matter how fine\nthey are.\"\n\nAlso, \"We have a lot of fun at our meetings,\" Pop assured us. \"You never\nsaw such high times. Nobody's got a right to go glooming around or pull\na long face just because he's done a killing or two. Religion or no\nreligion, pride's a sin.\"\n\nAlice and me ate it all up like we was a couple of kids and Pop was\ntelling us fairy tales. That's what it all was, of course, a fairy\ntale--a crazy mixed-up fairy tale. Alice and me knew there could be no\nfellowship of Deathlanders like Pop was describing--it was impossible as\nblue sky--but it gave us a kick to pretend to ourselves for a while to\nbelieve in it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPop could talk forever, apparently, about murder and murderers and he\nhad a bottomless bag of funny stories on the same topic and character\nvignettes--the murderers who were forever wanting their victims to\nunderstand and forgive them, the ones who thought of themselves as\nlittle kings with divine rights of dispensing death, the ones who\ninsisted on laying down (chastely) beside their finished victims and\nplaying dead for a couple of hours, the ones who weren't so chaste, the\nones who could only do their killings when they were dressed a certain\nway (and the troubles they had with their murder costumes), the ones who\ncould only kill people with certain traits or of a certain appearance\n(red-heads, say, or people who read books, or who couldn't carry tunes,\nor who used bad language), the ones who always mixed sex and murder and\nthe ones who believed that murder was contaminated by the least breath of\nsex, the sticklers and the Sloppy Joes, the artists and the butchers, the\nax- and stiletto-types, the _com_pulsives and the _re_pulsives--honestly,\nPop's portraits from life added up to a Dance of Death as good as\nanything the Middle Ages ever produced and they ought to have been\nillustrated like those by some great artist. Pop told us a lot about his\nown killings too. Alice and me was interested, but neither of us wasn't\ntempted into making parallel revelations about ourselves. Your private\nlife's your own business, I felt, as close as your guts, and no joke's\ngood enough to justify revealing a knot of it.\n\nNot that we talked about nothing but murder while we were bulleting\nalong toward Atla-Hi. The conversation was free-wheeling and we got onto\nall sorts of topics. For instance, we got to talking about the plane and\nhow it flew itself--or levitated itself, rather. I said it must generate\nan antigravity field that was keyed to the body of the plane but nothing\nelse, so that _we_ didn't feel lighter, nor any of the objects in the\ncabin--it just worked on the dull silvery metal--and I proved my point\nby using Mother to shave a little wisp of metal off the edge of the\ncontrol board. The curlicue stayed in the air wherever you put it and\nwhen you moved it you could feel the faintest sort of gyroscopic\nresistance. It was very strange.\n\nPop pointed out it was a little like magnetism. A germ riding on an iron\nfiling that was traveling toward the pole of a big magnet wouldn't feel\nthe magnetic pull--it wouldn't be operating on him, only on the\niron--but just the same the germ'd be carried along with the filing and\nfeel its acceleration and all, provided he could hold on--but for that\npurpose you could imagine a tiny cabin in the filing. \"That's what we\nare,\" Pop added. \"Three germs, jumbo size.\"\n\nAlice wanted to know why an antigravity plane should have even the\nstubbiest wings or a jet for that matter, for we remembered now we'd\nnoticed the tubes, and I said it was maybe just a reserve system in case\nthe antigravity failed and Pop guessed it might be for extra-fast battle\nmaneuvering or even for operating outside the atmosphere (which hardly\nmade sense, as I proved to him).\n\n\"If we're a battle plane, where's our guns?\" Alice asked. None of us had\nan answer.\n\nWe remembered the noise the plane had made before we saw it. It must\nhave been using its jets then. \"And do you suppose,\" Pop asked, \"that it\nwas something from the antigravity that made electricity flare out of\nthe top of the cracking plant? Like to have scared the pants off me!\" No\nanswer to that either.\n\nNow was a logical time, of course, to ask Pop what he knew about the\ncracking plant and just who had done the scream if not him, but I\nfigured he still wouldn't talk; as long as we were acting friendly there\nwas no point in spoiling it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe guessed around a little, though, about where the plane came from. Pop\nsaid Alamos, I said Atla-Hi, Alice said why not from both, why couldn't\nAlamos and Atla-Hi have some sort of treaty and the plane be traveling\nfrom the one to the other. We agreed it might be. At least it fitted\nwith the Atla-Hi violet and the Alamos blue being brighter than the\nother colors.\n\n\"I just hope we got some sort of anti-collision radar,\" I said. I\nguessed we had, because twice we'd jogged in our course a little, maybe\nto clear the Alleghenies. The easterly green star was by now getting\npretty close to the violet blot of Atla-Hi. I looked out at the orange\nsoup, which was _one_ thing that hadn't changed a bit so far, and I got\nto wishing like a baby that it wasn't there and to thinking how it\nblanketed the whole Earth (stars over the Riviera?--don't make me\nlaugh!) and I heard myself asking, \"Pop, did you rub out that guy that\npushed the buttons for all this?\"\n\n\"Nope,\" Pop answered without hesitation, just as if it hadn't been four\nhours or so since he'd mentioned the point. \"Nope, Ray. Fact is I\nwelcomed him into our little fellowship about six months back. This is\n_his_ knife here, this horn-handle in my boot, though he never killed\nwith it. He claimed he'd been tortured for years by the thought of the\nmillions and millions he'd killed with blast and radiation, but now he\nwas finding peace at last because he was where he belonged, with the\nmurderers, and could start to do something about it. Several of the boys\ndidn't want to let him in. They claimed he wasn't a real murderer, doing\nit by remote control, no matter how many he bumped off.\"\n\n\"I'd have been on their side,\" Alice said, thinning her lips.\n\n\"Yep,\" Pop continued, \"they got real hot about it. _He_ got hot too and\nall excited and offered to go out and kill somebody with his bare hands\nright off, or try to (he's a skinny little runt), if that's what he had\nto do to join. We argued it over, I pointed out that we let ex-soldiers\ncount the killings they'd done in service, and that we counted\npoisonings and booby traps and such too--which are remote-control\nkillings in a way--so eventually we let him in. He's doing good work.\nWe're fortunate to have him.\"\n\n\"Do you think he's really the guy who pushed the buttons?\" I asked Pop.\n\n\"How should I know?\" Pop replied. \"He claims to be.\"\n\nI was going to say something about people who faked confessions to get a\nlittle easy glory, as compared to the guys who were really guilty and\nwould sooner be chopped up than talk about it, but at that moment a\nfourth voice started talking in the plane. It seemed to be coming out of\nthe violet patch on the North America screen. That is, it came from the\ngeneral direction of the screen at any rate and my mind instantly tied\nit to the violet patch at Atla-Hi. It gave us a fright, I can tell you.\nAlice grabbed my knee with her pliers (she changed again), harder than\nshe'd intended, I suppose, though I didn't let out a yip--I was too\ndefensively frozen.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe voice was talking a language I didn't understand at all that went up\nand down the scale like atonal music.\n\n\"Sounds like Chinese,\" Pop whispered, giving me a nudge.\n\n\"It _is_ Chinese. Mandarin,\" the screen responded instantly in the\npurest English--at least that was how I'd describe it. Practically\nBoston. \"Who are you? And where is Grayl? Come in, Grayl.\"\n\nI knew well enough who Grayl must be--or rather, have been. I looked at\nPop and Alice. Pop grinned, maybe a mite feebly this time, I thought,\nand gave me a look as if to say, \"_You_ want to handle it?\"\n\nI cleared my throat. Then, \"We've taken over for Grayl,\" I said to the\nscreen.\n\n\"Oh.\" The screen hesitated, just barely. Then, \"Do any of 'you' speak\nMandarin?\"\n\nI hardly bothered to look at Pop and Alice. \"No,\" I said.\n\n\"Oh.\" Again a tiny pause. \"Is Grayl aboard the plane?\"\n\n\"No.\" I said.\n\n\"Oh. Incapacitated in some way, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, grateful for the screen's tactfulness, unintentional or\nnot.\n\n\"But you have taken over for him?\" the screen pressed.\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, swallowing. I didn't know what I was getting us into,\nthings were moving too fast, but it seemed the merest sense to act\ncooperative.\n\n\"I'm very glad of that,\" the screen said with something in its tone that\nmade me feel funny--I guess it was sincerity. Then it said, \"Is the--\"\nand hesitated, and started again with \"Are the blocks aboard?\"\n\nI thought. Alice pointed at the stuff she dumped out of the other seat.\nI said. \"There's a box with a thousand or so one-inch underweight steel\ncubes in it. Like a child's blocks, but with buttons in them. Alongside\na box with a parachute.\"\n\n\"That's what I mean,\" the screen said and somehow, maybe because whoever\nwas talking was trying to hide it, I caught a note of great relief.\n\n\"Look,\" the screen said, more rapidly now, \"I don't know how much you\nknow, but we may have to work very fast. You aren't going to be able to\ndeliver the steel cubes to us directly. In fact you aren't going to be\nable to land in Atlantic Highlands at all. We're sieged in by planes and\nground forces of Savannah Fortress. All our aircraft, such as haven't\nbeen destroyed, are pinned down. You're going to have to parachute the\nblocks to a point as near as possible to one of our ground parties\nthat's made a sortie. We'll give you a signal. I hope it will be\nlater--nearer here, that is--but it may be sooner. Do you know how to\nfight the plane you're in? Operate its armament?\"\n\n\"No,\" I said, wetting my lip.\n\n\"Then that's the first thing I'd best teach you. Anything you see in the\nhaze from now on will be from Savannah. You must shoot it down.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5\n\n    _And we are here as on a darkling plain\n    Swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight,\n    Where ignorant armies clash by night._\n\n                                        --Dover Beach,\n                                                   _by Matthew Arnold_\n\n\nI am not going to try to describe point by point all that happened the\nnext half hour because there was too much of it and it involved all\nthree of us, sometimes doing different things at the same time, and\nalthough we were told a lot of things, we were seldom if ever told the\nwhy of them, and through it all was the constant impression that we\nwere dealing with human beings (I almost left out the \"human\" and I'm\nstill not absolutely sure whether I shouldn't) of vastly greater\nscope--and probably intelligence too--than ourselves.\n\nAnd that was just the _basic_ confusion, to give it a name. After a\nwhile the situation got more difficult, as I'll try to tell in due\ncourse.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTo begin with, it was extremely weird to plunge from a rather leisurely\nconfab about a fairy-tale fellowship of non-practicing murderers into a\nshooting war between a violet blob and a dark red puddle on a shadowy\nfluorescent map. The voice didn't throw any great shining lights on this\ntopic, because after the first--and perhaps unguarded--revelation, we\nlearned little more of the war between Atla-Hi and Savannah Fortress and\nnothing of the reasons behind it. Presumably Savannah was the aggressor,\nreaching out north after the conquest of Birmingham, but even that was\njust a guess. It is hard to describe how shadowy it all felt to me;\nthere were some minutes while my mind kept mixing up the whole thing\nwith what I'd read long ago about the Civil War: Savannah was Lee,\nAtla-Hi was Grant, and we had been dropped spang into the middle of the\nsecond Battle of the Wilderness.\n\nApparently the Savannah planes had some sort of needle ray as part of\ntheir armament--at any rate I was warned to watch out for \"swinging\nlines in the haze, like straight strings of pink stars\" and later told\nto aim at the sources of such lines. And naturally I guessed that the\nsteel cubes must be some crucial weapon for Atla-Hi, or ammunition for a\nweapon, or parts for some essential instrument like a giant computer,\nbut the voice ignored my questions on that point and didn't fall into\nthe couple of crude conversational traps I tried to set. We were to drop\nthe cubes when told, that was all. Pop had the box of them closed again\nand rigged to the parachute--he took over that job because Alice and me\nwere busy with other things when the instructions on that came\nthrough--and he was told how to open the door of the plane for the drop\n(you just held your hand steadily on a point beside the door), but, as I\nsay, that was all.\n\nNaturally it occurred to me that once we had made the drop, Atla-Hi\nwould have no more use for us and might simply let us be destroyed by\nSavannah or otherwise--perhaps _want_ us to be destroyed--so that it\nmight be wisest for us to refuse to make the drop when the signal came\nand hang onto those myriad steel cubes as our only bargaining point.\nStill, I could see no advantage to refusing _before_ the signal came.\nI'd have liked to discuss the point with Alice and maybe Pop too, but\napparently everything we said, even whispered, could be overheard by\nAtla-Hi. (We never did determine, incidentally, whether Atla-Hi could\n_see_ into the cabin of the plane also. I don't believe they could,\nthough they sure had it bugged for sound.)\n\nAll in all, we found out almost nothing about Atla-Hi. In fact, three\nwitless germs traveling in a cabin in an iron filing wasn't a bad\ndescription of us at all. As I often say of my deductive\nfaculties--think--shmink! But Atla-Hi (always meaning, of course, the\npersonality behind the voice from the screen) found out all it wanted\nabout us--and apparently knew a good deal to start with. For one thing,\nthey must have been tracking our plane for some time, because they\nguessed it was on automatic and that we could reverse its course but\nnothing else. Though they seemed under the impression that we could\nreverse its course to Los Alamos, not the cracking plant. Here obviously\nI did get a nugget of new data, though it was just about the only one.\nFor a moment the voice from the screen got real unguarded--anxious as it\nasked, \"Do you know if it is true that they have stopped dying at Los\nAlamos, or are they merely broadcasting that to cheer us up?\"\n\nI answered, \"Oh yes, they're all fine,\" to that, but I couldn't have\nmade it very convincing, because the next thing I knew the voice was\ngetting me to admit that we'd only boarded the plane somewhere in the\nCentral Deathlands. I even had to describe the cracking plant and\nfreeway and gas tanks--I couldn't think of a lie that mightn't get us\ninto as much trouble as the truth--and the voice said, \"Oh, did Grayl\nstay there?\" and I said, \"Yes,\" and braced myself to do some more\nadmitting, or some heavy lying, as the inspiration took me.\n\nBut the voice continued to skirt around the question of what exactly had\nhappened to Grayl. I guess they knew well enough we'd bumped him off,\nbut didn't bring it up because they needed our cooperation--they were\nhandling us like children or savages, you see.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOne pretty amazing point--Atla-Hi apparently knew something about Pop's\nfairy-tale fellowship of non-practicing murderers, because when he had\nto speak up, while he was getting instructions on preparing the stuff\nfor the drop, the voice said, \"Excuse me, but you sound like one of\nthose M. A. boys.\"\n\nMurderers Anonymous, Pop had said some of their boys called their\nunorganized organization.\n\n\"Yep, I am,\" Pop admitted uncomfortably.\n\n\"Well, a word of advice then, or perhaps I only mean gossip,\" the screen\nsaid, for once getting on a side track. \"Most of our people do not\nbelieve you are serious about it, although you may think that you are.\nOur skeptics (which includes all but a very few of us) split quite\nevenly between those who think that the M. A. spirit is a terminal\npsychotic illusion and those who believe it is an elaborate ruse in\npreparation for some concerted attack on cities by Deathlanders.\"\n\n\"Can't say that I blame the either of them,\" was Pop's only comment. \"I\nthink I'm nuts myself and a murderer forever.\" Alice glared at him for\nthat admission, but it seemed to do us no damage. Pop really did seem\nout of his depth though during this part of our adventure, more out of\nhis depth than even Alice and me--I mean, as if he could only really\nfunction in the Deathland with Deathlanders and wanted to get anything\nelse over quickly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI think one reason Pop was that way was that he was feeling very\nintensely something I was feeling myself: a sort of sadness and\nbewilderment that beings as smart as the voice from the screen sounded\nshould still be fighting wars. Murder, as you must know by now, I can\nunderstand and sympathize with deeply, but war?--no!\n\nOh, I can understand cultural queers fighting city squares and even get\na kick out of it and whoop 'em on, but these Atla-Hi and Alamos folk\nseemed a different sort of cat altogether (though I'd only come to that\npoint of view today)--the kind of cat that ought to have outgrown war or\nthought its way around it. Maybe Savannah Fortress had simply forced the\nwar on them and they had to defend themselves. I hadn't contacted any\nSavannans--they might be as blood-simple as the Porterites. Still, I\ndon't know that it's always a good excuse that somebody else forced you\ninto war. That sort of justification can keep on until the end of time.\nBut who's a germ to judge?\n\nA minute later I was feeling doubly like a germ and a very lowly one,\nbecause the situation had just got more difficult and depressing\ntoo--the thing had happened that I said I'd tell you about in due\ncourse.\n\nThe voice was just repeating its instructions to Pop on making the drop,\nwhen it broke off of a sudden and a second voice came in, a deep voice\nwith a sort of European accent (not Chinese, oddly)--not talking _to_\nus, I think, but to the first voice and overlooking or not caring that\nwe could hear.\n\n\"_Also_ tell them,\" the second voice said, \"that we will blow them out\nof the sky the instant they stop obeying us! If they should hesitate to\nmake the drop or if they should put a finger on the button that reverses\ntheir course, then--_pouf!_ Such brutes understand only the language of\nforce. _Also_ warn them that the blocks are atomic grenades that will\nblow them out of the sky too if--\"\n\n\"Dr. Kovalsky, will you permit me to point out--\" the first voice\ninterrupted, getting as close to expressing irritation as I imagine it\never allowed itself to do. Then both voices cut off abruptly and the\nscreen was silent for ten seconds or so. I guess the first voice thought\nit wasn't nice for us to overhear Atla-Hi bickering with itself, even if\nthe second voice didn't give a damn (any more than a farmer would mind\nthe pigs overhearing him squabble with his hired man; of course this guy\nseemed to overlook that we were killer-pigs, but there wasn't anything\nwe could do in that line just now except get burned up).\n\nWhen the screen came on again, it was just the first voice talking once\nmore, but it had something to say that was probably the result of a\nrapid conference and compromise.\n\n\"Attention, everyone! I wish to inform you that the plane in which you\nare traveling can be exploded--melted in the air, rather--if we activate\na certain control at this end. We will _not_ do so, now or subsequently,\nif you make the drop when we give the signal and if you remain on your\npresent course until then. Afterwards you will be at liberty to reverse\nyour course and escape as best you may. Let me re-emphasize that when\nyou told me you had taken over for Grayl I accepted that assertion in\nfull faith and still so accept it. Is that all fully understood?\"\n\nWe all told him \"Yes,\" though I don't imagine we sounded very happy\nabout it, even Pop. However I did get that funny feeling again that the\nvoice was being really sincere--an illusion, I supposed, but still a\ncomforting one.\n\nNow while all these things were going on, believe it or not, and while\nthe plane continued to bullet through the orange haze--which hadn't\nshown any foreign objects in it so far, thank God, even vultures, let\nalone \"straight strings of pink stars\"--I was receiving a cram course in\ngunnery! (Do you wonder I don't try to tell this part of my story\nconsecutively?)\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt turned out that Alice had been brilliantly right about one thing: if\nyou pushed some of the buttons simultaneously in patterns of five they\nunlocked and you could play on them like organ keys. Two sets of five\nkeys, played properly, would rig out a sight just in front of the\nviewport and let you aim and fire the plane's main gun in any forward\ndirection. There was a rearward firing gun too, that you aimed by\nchanging over the World Screen to a rear-view TV window, but we didn't\nget around to mastering that one. In fact, in spite of my special\ntalents it was all I could do to achieve a beginner's control over the\nmain gun, and I wouldn't have managed even that except that Alice, from\nthe thinking she'd been doing about patterns of five, was quick at\nunderstanding from the voice's descriptions which buttons were meant.\nShe couldn't work them herself of course, what with her stump and burnt\nhand, but she could point them out for me.\n\nAfter twenty minutes of drill I was a gunner of sorts, sprawled in the\nright-hand kneeling seat and intently scanning the onrushing orange haze\nwhich at last was beginning to change toward the bronze of evening. If\nsomething showed up in it I'd be able to make a stab at getting a shot\nin. Not that I knew what my gun fired--the voice wasn't giving away any\nunnecessary data.\n\nNaturally I had asked why didn't the voice teach me to fly the plane so\nthat I could maneuver in case of attack, and naturally the voice had\ntold me it was out of the question--much too difficult and besides they\nwanted us on a known course so they could plan better for the drop and\nrecovery. (I think maybe the voice would have given me some hints--and\nmaybe even told me more about the steel cubes too and how much danger we\nwere in from them--if it hadn't been for the second voice, which\npresumably had issued from a being who was keeping watch to make sure\namong other things that the first voice didn't get soft-hearted.)\n\nSo there I was being a front gunner. Actually a part of me was getting a\nbig bang out of it--from antique Banker's Special to needle cannon (or\nwhatever it was)--but at the same time another part of me was disgusted\nwith the idea of acting like I belonged to a live culture (even a smart,\nunqueer one) and working in a war (even just so as to get out of it\nfast), while a third part of me--one that I normally keep down--was very\nsimply horrified.\n\nPop was back by the door with the box and 'chute, ready to make the\ndrop.\n\nAlice had no duties for the moment, but she'd suddenly started gathering\nup food cans and packing them in one bag--I couldn't figure out at first\nwhat she had in mind. Orderly housewife wouldn't be exactly my\ndescription of her occupational personality.\n\nThen of course everything had to happen at once.\n\nThe voice said, \"Make the drop!\"\n\nAlice crossed to Pop and thrust out the bag of cans toward him, writhing\nher lips in silent \"talk\" to tell him something. She had a knife in her\nburnt hand too.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut I didn't have time to do any lip-reading, because just then a\nglittering pink asterisk showed up in the darkening haze ahead--a whole\nhalf dozen straight lines spreading out from a blank central spot, as if\na super-fast gigantic spider had laid in the first strands of its web.\n\nWind whistled as the door of the plane started to open.\n\nI fought to center my sight on the blank central spot, which drifted\ntoward the left.\n\nOne of the straight lines grew dazzlingly bright.\n\nI heard Alice whisper fiercely, \"Drop _these_!\" and the part of my mind\nthat couldn't be applied to gunnery instantly deduced that she'd had\nsome last-minute inspiration about dropping a bunch of cans instead of\nthe steel cubes.\n\nI got the sight centered and held down the firing combo. The thought\nflashed to me: _it's a city you're firing at, not a plane_, and I\nflinched.\n\nThe dazzlingly pink line dipped down toward me.\n\nBehind me, the sound of a struggle. Alice snarling and Pop giving a\ngrunt.\n\nThen all at once a scream from Alice, a big whoosh of wind, a flash way\nahead (where I'd aimed), a spatter of hot metal inside the cabin, a\nblinding spot in the middle of the World Screen, a searing beam inches\nfrom my neck, an electric shock that lifted me from my seat and ripped\nat my consciousness!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen I came to (if I really ever was out--seconds later, at most) there\nwere no more pink lines. The haze was just its disgustingly tawny\nevening self with black spots that were only after-images. The cabin\nstunk of ozone, but wind funneling through a hole in the one-time World\nScreen was blowing it out fast enough--Savannah had gotten in one lick,\nall right. And we were falling, the plane was swinging down like a\ncrippled bird--I could feel it and there was no use kidding myself.\n\nBut staring at the control panel wouldn't keep us from crashing if that\nwas in the cards. I looked around and there were Pop and Alice glaring\nat each other across the closing door. He looked mean. She looked\nagonized and was pressing her burnt hand into her side with her elbow as\nif he'd stamped on the hand, maybe. I didn't see any blood though. I\ndidn't see the box and 'chute either, though I did see Alice's bag of\ngroceries. I guessed Pop had made the drop.\n\nNow, it occurred to me, was a bully time for Voice Two to melt the\nplane--if he hadn't already tried. My first thought had been that the\nspatter of hot metal had come from the Savannah craft spitting us, but\nthere was no way to be sure.\n\nI looked around at the viewport in time to see rocks and stunted trees\njump out of the haze. _Good old Ray_, I thought, _always in at the\ndeath_. But just then the plane took a sickening bounce, as if its\nantigravity had only started to operate within yards of the ground.\nAnother lurching fall and another bounce, less violent. A couple of\nrepetitions of that, each one a little gentler, and then we were sort of\nbumping along on an even keel with the rocks and such sliding past fast\nabout a hundred feet below, I judged. We'd been spoiled for altitude\nwork, it seemed, but we could still cripple along in some sort of\nlow-power repulsion field.\n\nI looked at the North America screen and the buttons, wondering if I\nshould start us back west again or leave us set on Atla-Hi and see what\nthe hell happened--at the moment I hardly cared what else Savannah did\nto us. I needn't have wasted the mental energy. The decision was made\nfor me. As I watched, the Atla-Hi button jumped up by itself and the\nbutton for the cracking plant went down and there was some extra bumping\nas we swung around.\n\nAlso, the violet patch of Atla-Hi went real dim and the button for it no\nlonger had a violet nimbus. The Los Alamos blue went dull too. The\ncracking-plant dot glowed a brighter green--that was all.\n\nAll except for one thing. As the violet dimmed I thought I heard Voice\nOne very faintly (not as if speaking directly but as if the screen had\nheard and remembered--not a voice but the fluorescent ghost of one):\n\"Thank you and good luck!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6\n\n    _Many a man has dated his ruin from some murder or other that\n    perhaps he thought little of at the time._\n\n                                        --Thomas de Quincey\n\n\n\"And a long merry siege to you, sir, and roast rat for Christmas!\" I\nresponded, very out loud and rather to my surprise.\n\n\"War! How I hate war!\"--that was what Pop exploded with. He didn't\nexactly dance in senile rage--he was still keeping too sharp a watch on\nAlice--but his voice sounded that way.\n\n\"Damn you, Pop!\" Alice contributed. \"And you too, Ray! We might have\npulled something, but you had to go obedience-happy.\" Then her anger got\nthe better of her grammar, or maybe Pop and me was corrupting it. \"Damn\nthe both of you!\" she finished.\n\nIt didn't make much sense, any of it. We were just cutting loose, I\nguess, after being scared to say anything for the last half hour.\n\nI said to Alice, \"I don't know what you could have pulled, except the\nchain on us.\" To Pop I remarked, \"You may hate war, but you sure helped\nthat one along. Those grenades you dropped will probably take care of a\nfew hundred Savannans.\"\n\n\"That's what you always say about me, isn't it?\" he snapped back. \"But I\ndon't suppose I should expect any kinder interpretation of my motives.\"\nTo Alice he said, \"I'm sorry I had to slap your burnt fingers, sister,\nbut you can't say I didn't warn you about my low-down tactics.\" Then to\nme again: \"I _do_ hate war, Ray. It's just murder on a bigger scale,\nthough some of the boys give me an argument there.\"\n\n\"Then why don't you go preach against war in Atla-Hi and Savannah?\"\nAlice demanded, still very hot but not quite so bitter.\n\n\"Yeah, Pop, how about it?\" I seconded.\n\n\"Maybe I should,\" he said, thoughtful all at once. \"They sure need it.\"\nThen he grinned. \"Hey, how'd this sound: HEAR THE WORLD-FAMOUS MURDERER\nPOP TRUMBULL TALK AGAINST WAR. WEAR YOUR STEEL THROAT PROTECTORS. Pretty\ngood, hey?\"\n\nWe all laughed at that, grudgingly at first, then with a touch of\nwholeheartedness. I think we all recognized that things weren't going to\nbe very cheerful from here on in and we'd better not turn up our noses\nat the feeblest fun.\n\n\"I guess I didn't have anything very bright in mind,\" Alice admitted to\nme, while to Pop she said, \"All right, I forgive you for the present.\"\n\n\"Don't!\" Pop said with a shudder. \"I hate to think of what happened to\nthe last bugger made the mistake of forgiving me.\"\n\nWe looked around and took stock of our resources. It was time we did. It\nwas getting dark fast, although we were chasing the sun, and there\nweren't any cabin lights coming on and we sure didn't know of any way of\ngetting any.\n\nWe wadded a couple of satchels into the hole in the World Screen without\ntrying to probe it. After a while it got warmer again in the cabin and\nthe air a little less dusty. Presently it started to get too smoky from\nthe cigarettes we were burning, but that came later.\n\nWe screwed off the walls the few storage bags we hadn't inspected. They\ndidn't contain nothing of consequence, not even a flashlight.\n\nI had one last go at the buttons, though there weren't any left with\nnimbuses on them--the darker it got, the clearer that was. Even the\nAtla-Hi button wouldn't push now that it had lost its violet halo. I\ntried the gunnery patterns, figuring to put in a little time taking pot\nshots at any mountains that turned up, but the buttons that had been\nresponding so well a few minutes ago refused to budge. Alice suggested\ndifferent patterns, but none of them worked. That console was really\nlocked--maybe the shot from Savannah was partly responsible, though\nAtla-Hi remote-locking things was explanation enough.\n\n\"The buggers!\" I said. \"They didn't have to tie us up _this_ tight.\nGoing east we at least had a choice--forward or back. Now we got none.\"\n\n\"Maybe we're just as well off,\" Pop said. \"If Atla-Hi had been able to\ndo anything more for us--that is, if they hadn't been sieged in, I\nmean--they'd sure as anything have pulled us in. Pull the plane in, I\nmean, and picked us out of it--with a big pair of tweezers, likely as\nnot. And contrary to your flattering opinion of my preaching (which by\nthe way none of the religious boys in my outfit share--they call me\n'that misguided old atheist'), I don't think none of us would go over\nbig at Atla-Hi.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe had to agree with him there. I couldn't imagine Pop or Alice or even\nme cutting much of a figure (even if we weren't murder-pariahs) with the\npack of geniuses that seemed to make up the Atla-Alamos crowd. The\nDouble-A Republics, to give them a name, might have their small-brain\ntypes, but somehow I didn't think so. There must be more than one\nEdison-Einstein, it seemed to me, back of antigravity and all the\nwonders in this plane and the other things we'd gotten hints of. Also,\nGrayl had seemed bred for brains as well as size, even if us small\nmammals had cooked his goose. And none of the modern \"countries\" had\nmore than a few thousand population yet, I was pretty sure, and that\nhardly left room for a dumbbell class. Finally, too, I got hold of a\nmemory I'd been reaching for the last hour--how when I was a kid I'd\nread about some scientists who learned to talk Mandarin just for kicks.\nI told Alice and Pop.\n\n\"And if _that's_ the average Atla-Alamoser's idea of mental recreation,\"\nI said, \"well, you can see what I mean.\"\n\n\"I'll grant you they got a monopoly of brains,\" Pop agreed. \"Not sense,\nthough,\" he added doggedly.\n\n\"Intellectual snobs,\" was Alice's comment. \"I know the type and I detest\nit.\" (\"You _are_ sort of intellectual, aren't you?\" Pop told her, which\nfortunately didn't start a riot.)\n\nStill, I guess all three of us found it fun to chew over a bit the new\nslant we'd gotten on two (in a way, three) of the great \"countries\" of\nthe modern world. (And as long as we thought of it as fun, we didn't\nhave to admit the envy and wistfulness that was behind our wisecracks.)\n\nI said, \"We've always figured in a general way that Alamos was the\nremains of a community of scientists and technicians. Now we know the\nsame's true of the Atla-Hi group. They're the Brookhaven survivors.\"\n\n\"Manhattan Project, don't you mean?\" Alice corrected.\n\n\"Nope, that was in Colorado Springs,\" Pop said with finality.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI also pointed out that a community of scientists would educate for\ntechnical intelligence, maybe breed for it too. And being a group picked\nfor high I. Q. to begin with, they might make startlingly fast progress.\nYou could easily imagine such folk, unimpeded by the boobs, creating a\nwonder world in a couple of generations.\n\n\"They got their troubles though,\" Pop reminded me and that led us to\nspeculating about the war we'd dipped into. Savannah Fortress, we knew,\nwas supposed to be based on some big atomic plants on the river down\nthat way, but its culture seemed to have a fiercer ingredient than\nAtla-Alamos. Before we knew it we were, musing almost romantically about\nthe plight of Atla-Hi, besieged by superior and (it was easy to suppose)\nbarbaric forces, and maybe distant Los Alamos in a similar\npredicament--Alice reminded me how the voice had asked if they were\nstill dying out there. For a moment I found myself fiercely proud that I\nhad been able to strike a blow against evil aggressors. At once, of\ncourse, then, the revulsion came.\n\n\"This is a hell of a way,\" I said, \"for three so-called realists to be\nmooning about things.\"\n\n\"Yes, especially when your heroes kicked us out,\" Alice agreed.\n\nPop chuckled. \"Yep,\" he said, \"they even took Ray's artillery away from\nhim.\"\n\n\"You're wrong there, Pop,\" I said, sitting up. \"I still got one of the\ngrenades--the one the pilot had in his fist.\" To tell the truth I'd\nforgotten all about it and it bothered me a little now to feel it\nsnugged up in my pocket against my hip bone where the skin is thin.\n\n\"You believe what that old Dutchman said about the steel cubes being\natomic grenades?\" Pop asked me.\n\n\"I don't know,\" I said, \"He sure didn't sound enthusiastic about telling\nus the truth about anything. But for that matter he sounded mean enough\nto tell the truth figuring we'd think it was a lie. Maybe this _is_ some\nsort of baby A-bomb with a fuse timed like a grenade.\" I got it out and\nhefted it. \"How about I press the button and drop it out the door? Then\nwe'll know.\" I really felt like doing it--restless, I guess.\n\n\"Don't be a fool, Ray,\" Alice said.\n\n\"Don't tense up, I won't,\" I told her. At the same time I made myself\nthe little promise that if I ever got to feeling restless, that is,\nrestless and _bad_, I'd just go ahead and punch the button and see what\nhappened--sort of leave my future up to the gods of the Deathlands, you\nmight say.\n\n\"What makes you so sure it's a weapon?\" Pop asked.\n\n\"What else would it be,\" I asked him, \"that they'd be so hot on getting\nthem in the middle of a war?\"\n\n\"I don't know for sure,\" Pop said. \"I've made a guess, but I don't want\nto tell it now. What I'm getting at, Ray, is that your first thought\nabout anything you find--in the world outside or in your own mind--is\nthat it's a weapon.\"\n\n\"Anything worthwhile in your mind is a weapon!\" Alice interjected with\nsurprising intensity.\n\n\"You see?\" Pop said. \"That's what I mean about the both of you. That\nsort of thinking's been going on a long time. Cave man picks up a rock\nand right away asks himself, 'Who can I brain with this?' Doesn't occur\nto him for several hundred thousand years to use it to start building a\nhospital.\"\n\n\"You know, Pop,\" I said, carefully tucking the cube back in my pocket,\n\"you _are_ sort of preachy at times.\"\n\n\"Guess I am,\" he said. \"How about some grub?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was a good idea. Another few minutes and we wouldn't have been able\nto see to eat, though with the cans shaped to tell their contents I\nguess we'd have managed. It was a funny circumstance that in this wonder\nplane we didn't even know how to turn on the light--and a good measure\nof our general helplessness.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe had our little feed and lit up again and settled ourselves. I judged\nit would be an overnight trip, at least to the cracking plant--we\nweren't making anything like the speed we had been going east. Pop was\nsitting in back again and Alice and I lay half hitched around on the\nkneeling seats, which allowed us to watch each other. Pretty soon it got\nso dark we couldn't see anything of each other but the glowing tips of\nthe cigarettes and a bit of face around the mouth when the person took a\ndeep drag. They were a good idea, those cigarettes--kept us from having\nideas about the other person starting to creep around with a knife in\nhis hand.\n\nThe North America screen still glowed dimly and we could watch our green\ndot trying to make progress. The viewport was dead black at first, then\nthere came the faintest sort of bronze blotch that very slowly shifted\nforward and down. The Old Moon, of course, going west ahead of us.\n\nAfter a while I realized what it was like--an old Pullman car (I'd\ntraveled in one once as a kid) or especially the smoker of an old\nPullman, very late at night. Our crippled antigravity, working on the\nirregularities of the ground as they came along below, made the ride\nrhythmically bumpy, you see. I remembered how lonely and strange that\nold sleeping car had seemed to me as a kid. This felt the same. I kept\nwaiting for a hoot or a whistle. It was the sort of loneliness that\nsettles in your bones and keeps working at you.\n\n\"I recall the first man I ever killed--\" Pop started to reminisce\nsoftly.\n\n\"Shut up!\" Alice told him. \"Don't you ever talk about anything but\nmurder, Pop?\"\n\n\"Guess not,\" he said. \"After all, it's the only really interesting topic\nthere is. Do you know of another?\"\n\nIt was silent in the cabin for a long time after that. Then Alice said,\n\"It was the afternoon before my twelfth birthday when they came into the\nkitchen and killed my father. He'd been wise, in a way, and had us\nliving at a spot where the bombs didn't touch us or the worst fallout.\nBut he hadn't counted on the local werewolf gang. He'd just been slicing\nsome bread--homemade from our own wheat (Dad was great on back to nature\nand all)--but he laid down the knife.\n\n\"Dad couldn't see any object or idea as a weapon, you see--that was his\ngreat weakness. Dad couldn't even see weapons as weapons. Dad had a\nphilosophy of cooperation, that was his name for it, that he was going\nto explain to people. Sometimes I think he was glad of the Last War,\nbecause he believed it would give him his chance.\n\n\"But the werewolves weren't interested in philosophy and although their\nknives weren't as sharp as Dad's they didn't lay them down. Afterwards\nthey had themselves a meal, with me for dessert. I remember one of them\nused a slice of bread to sop up blood like gravy. And another washed his\nhands and face in the cold coffee ...\"\n\nShe didn't say anything else for a bit. Pop said softly, \"That was the\nafternoon, wasn't it, that the fallen angels ...\" and then just said,\n\"My big mouth.\"\n\n\"You were going to say 'the afternoon they killed God?'\" Alice asked\nhim. \"You're right, it was. They killed God in the kitchen that\nafternoon. That's how I know he's dead. Afterwards they would have\nkilled me too, eventually, except--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAgain she broke off, this time to say, \"Pop, do you suppose I can have\nbeen thinking about myself as the Daughter of God all these years? That\nthat's why everything seems so intense?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Pop said. \"The religious boys say we're all children of\nGod. I don't put much stock in it--or else God sure has some lousy\nchildren. Go on with your story.\"\n\n\"Well, they would have killed me too, except the leader took a fancy to\nme and got the idea of training me up for a Weregirl or She-wolf Deb or\nwhatever they called it.\"\n\n\"That was my first experience of ideas as weapons. He got an idea about\nme and I used it to kill him. I had to wait three months for my\nopportunity. I got him so lazy he let me shave him. He bled to death the\nsame way as Dad.\"\n\n\"Hum,\" Pop commented after a bit, \"that was a chiller, all right. I got\nto remember to tell it to Bill--it was somebody killing his mother that\ngot _him_ started. Alice, you had about as good a justification for your\nfirst murder as any I remember hearing.\"\n\n\"Yet,\" Alice said after another pause, with just a trace of the old\nsarcasm creeping back into her voice, \"I don't suppose you think I was\nright to do it?\"\n\n\"Right? Wrong? Who knows?\" Pop said almost blusteringly. \"Sure you were\njustified in a whole pack of ways. Anybody'd sympathize with you. A man\noften has fine justification for the first murder he commits. But as you\nmust know, it's not that the first murder's always so bad in itself as\nthat it's apt to start you on a killing spree. Your sense of values gets\nshifted a tiny bit and never shifts back. But you know all that and who\nam I to tell you anything, anyway? I've killed men because I didn't like\nthe way they spit. And may very well do it again if I don't keep\nwatching myself and my mind ventilated.\"\n\n\"Well, Pop,\" Alice said, \"I didn't always have such dandy justification\nfor my killings. Last one was a moony old physicist--he fixed me the\nGeiger counter I carry. A silly old geek--I don't know how he survived\nso long. Maybe an exile or a runaway. You know, I often attach myself\nto the elderly do-gooder type like my father was. Or like you, Pop.\"\n\nPop nodded. \"It's good to know yourself,\" he said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a third pause and then, although I hadn't exactly been\nintending to, I said, \"Alice had justification for her first murder,\npersonal justification that an ape would understand. I had no personal\njustification at all for mine, yet I killed about a million people at a\nmodest estimate. You see, I was the boss of the crew that took care of\nthe hydrogen missile ticketed for Moscow, and when the ticket was\nfinally taken up I was the one to punch it. My finger on the firing\nbutton, I mean.\"\n\nI went on, \"Yeah, Pop, I was one of the button-pushers. There were\nreally quite a few of us, of course--that's why I get such a laugh out\nof stories about being or rubbing out the _one_ guy who pushed all the\nbuttons.\"\n\n\"That so?\" Pop said with only mild-sounding interest. \"In that case you\nought to know--\"\n\nWe didn't get to hear right then who I ought to know because I had a fit\nof coughing and we realized the cigarette smoke was getting just too\nthick. Pop fixed the door so it was open a crack and after a while the\natmosphere got reasonably okay though we had to put up with a low lonely\nwhistling sound.\n\n\"Yeah,\" I continued, \"I was the boss of the missile crew and I wore a\nvery handsome uniform with impressive insignia--not the bully old\nstripes I got on my chest now--and I was very young and handsome myself.\nWe were all very young in that line of service, though a few of the men\nunder me were a little older. Young and dedicated. I remember feeling a\nvery deep and grim--and _clean_--responsibility. But I wonder sometimes\njust how deep it went or how clean it really was.\n\n\"I had an uncle flew in the war they fought to lick fascism, bombardier\non a Flying Fortress or something, and once when he got drunk he told me\nhow some days it didn't bother him at all to drop the eggs on Germany;\nthe buildings and people down there seemed just like toys that a kid\nsets up to kick over, and the whole business about as naive fun as\npoking an anthill.\n\n\"_I_ didn't even have to fly over at seven miles what I was going to be\naiming at. Only I remember sometimes getting out a map and looking at a\ncertain large dot on it and smiling a little and softly saying,\n'Pow!'--and then giving a little conventional shudder and folding up the\nmap quick.\n\n\"Naturally we told ourselves we'd never have to do it, fire the thing, I\nmean, we joked about how after twenty years or so we'd all be given jobs\nas museum attendants of this same bomb, deactivated at last. But\nnaturally it didn't work out that way. There came the day when our side\nof the world got hit and the orders started cascading down from Defense\nCoordinator Bigelow--\"\n\n\"Bigelow?\" Pop interrupted. \"Not Joe Bigelow?\"\n\n\"Joseph A., I believe,\" I told him, a little annoyed.\n\n\"Why he's my boy then, the one I was telling you about--the skinny runt\nhad this horn-handle! Can you beat that?\" Pop sounded startlingly happy.\n\"Him and you'll have a lot to talk about when you get together.\"\n\nI wasn't so sure of that myself, in fact my first reaction was that the\nopposite would be true. To be honest I was for the first moment more\nthan a little annoyed at Pop interrupting my story of my Big Grief--for\nit was that to me, make no mistake. Here my story had finally been\nteased out of me, against all expectation, after decades of repression\nand in spite of dozens of assorted psychological blocks--and here was\nPop interrupting it for the sake of a lot of trivial organizational\ngossip about Joes and Bills and Georges we'd never heard of and what\nthey'd say or think!\n\nBut then all of a sudden I realized that I didn't really care, that it\ndidn't feel like a Big Grief any more, that just starting to tell about\nit after hearing Pop and Alice tell their stories had purged it of that\nunnecessary weight of feeling that had made it a millstone around my\nneck. It seemed to me now that I could look down at Ray Baker from a\nconsiderable height (but not an angelic or contemptuously superior\nheight) and ask myself _not_ why he had grieved so much--that was\nunderstandable and even desirable--but why he had grieved so _uselessly_\nin such a stuffy little private hell.\n\nAnd it _would_ be interesting to find out how Joseph A. Bigelow had\nfelt.\n\n\"How does it feel, Ray, to kill a million people?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI realized that Alice had asked me the question several seconds back and\nit was hanging in the air.\n\n\"That's just what I've been trying to tell you,\" I told her and started\nto explain it all over again--the words poured out of me now. I won't\nput them down here--it would take too long--but they were honest words\nas far as I knew and they eased me.\n\nI couldn't get over it: here were us three murderers feeling a trust and\nunderstanding and sharing a communion that I wouldn't have believed\npossible between _any_ two or three people in the Age of the Deaders--or\nin _any_ age, to tell the truth. It was against everything I knew of\nDeathland psychology, but it was happening just the same. Oh, our\nstrange isolation had something to do with it, I knew, and that\nPullman-car memory hypnotizing my mind, and our reactions to the voices\nand violence of Atla-Alamos, but in spite of all that I ranked it as a\nwonder. I felt an inward freedom and easiness that I never would have\nbelieved possible. Pop's little disorganized organization had really\ngot hold of something, I couldn't deny it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThree treacherous killers talking from the bottoms of their hearts and\nbelieving each other!--for it never occurred to me to doubt that Pop and\nAlice were feeling exactly like I was. In fact, we were all so sure of\nit that we didn't even mention our communion to each other. Perhaps we\nwere a little afraid we would rub off the bloom. We just enjoyed it.\n\nWe must have talked about a thousand things that night and smoked a\ncouple of hundred cigarettes. After a while we started taking little\ncatnaps--we'd gotten too much off our chests and come to feel too\ntranquil for even our excitement to keep us awake. I remember the first\ntime I dozed waking up with a cold start and grabbing for Mother--and\nthen hearing Pop and Alice gabbing in the dark, and remembering what had\nhappened, and relaxing again with a smile.\n\nOf all things, Pop was saying, \"Yep, I imagine Ray must be good to make\nlove to, murderers almost always are, they got the fire. It reminds me\nof what a guy named Fred told me, one of our boys ...\"\n\nMostly we took turns going to sleep, though I think there were times\nwhen all three of us were snoozing. About the fifth time I woke up,\nafter some tighter shut-eye, the orange soup was back again outside and\nAlice was snoring gently in the next seat and Pop was up and had one of\nhis knives out.\n\nHe was looking at his reflection in the viewport. His face gleamed. He\nwas rubbing butter into it.\n\n\"Another day, another pack of troubles,\" he said cheerfully.\n\nThe tone of his remark jangled my nerves, as that tone generally does\nearly in the morning. I squeezed my eyes. \"Where are we?\" I asked.\n\nHe poked his elbow toward the North America screen. The two green dots\nwere almost one.\n\n\"My God, we're practically there,\" Alice said for me. She'd waked fast,\nDeathlands style.\n\n\"I know,\" Pop said, concentrating on what he was doing, \"but I aim to be\nshaved before they commence landing maneuvers.\"\n\n\"You think automatic will land us?\" Alice asked. \"What if we just start\ncircling around?\"\n\n\"We can figure out what to do when it happens,\" Pop said, whittling away\nat his chin. \"Until then, I'm not interested. There's still a couple of\nbottles of coffee in the sack. I've had mine.\"\n\nI didn't join in this chit-chat because the green dots and Alice's first\nremark had reminded me of a lot deeper reason for my jangled nerves than\nPop's cheerfulness. Night was gone, with its shielding cloak and its\nfeeling of being able to talk forever, and the naked day was here, with\nits demands for action. It is not so difficult to change your whole\nview of life when you are flying, or even bumping along above the ground\nwith friends who understand, but soon, I knew, I'd be down in the dust\nwith something I never wanted to see again.\n\n\"Coffee, Ray?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I guess so.\" I took the bottle from Alice and wondered whether my\nface looked as glum as hers.\n\n\"They shouldn't salt butter,\" Pop asserted. \"It makes it lousy for\nshaving.\"\n\n\"It was the _best_ butter,\" Alice said.\n\n\"Yeah,\" I said. \"The Dormouse, when they buttered the watch.\"\n\nIt may be true that feeble humor is better than none. I don't know.\n\n\"What are you two yakking about?\" Pop demanded.\n\n\"A book we both read,\" I told him.\n\n\"Either of you writers?\" Pop asked with sudden interest. \"Some of the\nboys think we should have a book about us. I say it's too soon, but they\nsay we might all die off or something. Whoa, Jenny! Easy does it.\nGently, please!\"\n\nThat last remark was by way of recognizing that the plane had started an\nauthoritative turn to the left. I got a sick and cold feeling. This was\nit.\n\nPop sheathed his knife and gave his face a final rub. Alice belted on\nher satchel. I reached for my knapsack, but I was staring through the\nviewport, dead ahead.\n\nThe haze lightened faintly, three times. I remembered the St. Elmo's\nfire that had flamed from the cracking plant.\n\n\"Pop,\" I said--almost whined, to be truthful, \"why'd the bugger ever\nhave to land here in the first place? He was rushing stuff they needed\nbad at Atla-Hi--why'd he have to break his trip?\"\n\n\"That's easy,\" Pop said. \"He was being a bad boy. At least that's my\ntheory. He was supposed to go straight to Atla-Hi, but there was\nsomebody he wanted to check up on first. He stopped here to see his\ngirlfriend. Yep, his girlfriend. She tried to warn him off--that's my\nexplanation of the juice that flared out of the cracking plant and\ninterfered with his landing, though I'm sure she didn't intend the last.\nBy the way, whatever she turned on to give him the warning must still be\nturned on. But Grayl came on down in spite of it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBefore I could assimilate that, the seven deformed gas tanks\nmaterialized in the haze. We got the freeway in our sights and steadied\nand slowed and kept slowing. The plane didn't graze the cracking plant\nthis time, though I'd have sworn it was going to hit it head on. When I\nsaw we _weren't_ going to hit it, I wanted to shut my eyes, but I\ncouldn't.\n\nThe stain was black now and the Pilot's body was thicker than I\nremembered--bloated. But that wouldn't last long. Three or four vultures\nwere working on it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 7\n\n    _Here now in his triumph where all things falter,\n    Stretched out on the spoils that his own hand spread,\n    As a god self-slain on his own strange altar,\n    Death lies dead._\n\n                                        --A Forsaken Garden,\n                                                _by Charles Swinburne_\n\n\nPop was first down. Between us we helped Alice. Before joining them I\ntook a last look at the control panel. The cracking plant button was up\nagain and there was a blue nimbus on another button. For Los Alamos, I\nsupposed. I was tempted to push it and get away solo, but then I\nthought, _nope, there's nothing for me at the other end and the\nloneliness will be worse than what I got to face here_. I climbed out.\n\nI didn't look at the body, although we were practically on top of it. I\nsaw a little patch of silver off to one side and remembered the gun that\nhad melted. The vultures had waddled off but only a few yards.\n\n\"We could kill them,\" Alice said to Pop.\n\n\"Why?\" he responded. \"Didn't some Hindus use them to take care of dead\nbodies? Not a bad idea, either.\"\n\n\"Parsees,\" Alice amplified.\n\n\"Yep, Parsees, that's what I meant. Give you a nice clean skeleton in a\nmatter of days.\"\n\nPop was leading us past the body toward the cracking plant. I heard the\nflies buzzing loudly. I felt terrible. I wanted to be dead myself. Just\nwalking along after Pop was an awful effort.\n\n\"His girl was running a hidden observation tower here,\" Pop was saying\nnow. \"Weather and all that, I suppose. Or maybe setting up a robot\nstation of some kind. I couldn't tell you about her before, because you\nwere both in a mood to try to rub out anybody remotely connected with\nthe Pilot. In fact, I did my best to lead you astray, letting you think\nI'd been the one to scream and all. Even now, to be honest about it, I\ndon't know if I'm doing the right thing telling and showing you all\nthis, but a man's got to take some risks whatever he does.\"\n\n\"Say, Pop,\" I said dully, \"isn't she apt to take a shot at us or\nsomething?\" Not that I'd have minded on my own account. \"Or are you and\nher that good friends?\"\n\n\"Nope, Ray,\" he said, \"she doesn't even know me. But I don't think she's\nin a position to do any shooting. You'll see why. Hey, she hasn't even\nshut the door. That's bad.\"\n\nHe seemed to be referring to a kind of manhole cover standing on its\nedge just inside the open-walled first story of the cracking plant. He\nknelt and looked down the hole the cover was designed to close off.\n\n\"Well, at least she didn't collapse at the bottom of the shaft,\" he\nsaid. \"Come on, let's see what happened.\" And he climbed into the shaft.\n\nWe followed him like zombies. At least that's how I felt. The shaft was\nabout twenty feet deep. There were foot- and hand-holds. It got stuffy\nright away, and warmer, in spite of the shaft being open at the top.\n\nAt the bottom there was a short horizontal passage. We had to duck to\nget through it. When we could straighten up we were in a large and\nluxurious bomb-resistant dugout, to give it a name. And it was stuffier\nand hotter than ever.\n\nThere was a lot of scientific equipment around and several small control\npanels reminding me of the one in the back of the plane. Some of them, I\nsupposed, connected with instruments, weather and otherwise, hidden up\nin the skeletal structure of the cracking plant. And there were signs of\noccupancy, a young woman's occupancy--clothes scattered around in a\nfrivolous way, and some small objects of art, and a slightly more than\nlife-size head in clay that I guessed the occupant must have been\nsculpting. I didn't give that last more than the most fleeting look,\nstrictly unintentional to begin with, because although it wasn't\nfinished I could tell whose head it was supposed to be--the Pilot's.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe whole place was finished in dull silver like the cabin of the plane,\nand likewise it instantly struck me as having a living personality,\npartly the Pilot's and partly someone else's--the personality of a\nmarriage. Which wasn't a bit nice, because the whole place smelt of\ndeath.\n\nBut to tell the truth I didn't give the place more than the quickest\nlook-over, because my attention was rivetted almost at once on a long\nwide couch with the covers kicked off it and on the body there.\n\nThe woman was about six feet tall and built like a goddess. Her hair was\nblonde and her skin tanned. She was lying on her stomach and she was\nnaked.\n\nShe didn't come anywhere near my libido, though. She looked sick to\ndeath. Her face, twisted towards us, was hollow-cheeked and flushed. Her\neyes, closed, were sunken and dark-circled. She was breathing shallowly\nand rapidly through her open mouth, gasping now and then.\n\nI got the crazy impression that all the heat in the place was coming\nfrom her body, radiating from her fever.\n\nAnd the whole place stunk of death. Honestly it seemed to me that this\ndugout was Death's underground temple, the bed Death's altar, and the\nwoman Death's sacrifice. (Had I unconsciously come to worship Death as a\ngod in the Deathlands? I don't really know. There it gets too deep for\nme.)\n\nNo, she didn't come within a million miles of my libido, but there was\nanother part of me that she was eating at ...\n\nIf guilt's a luxury, then I'm a plutocrat.\n\n... eating at until I was an empty shell, until I had no props left,\nuntil I wanted to die then and there, until I figured I had to die ...\n\nThere was a faint sharp hiss right at my elbow. I looked and found that,\nunbeknownst to myself, I'd taken the steel cube out of my pocket and\nholding it snuggled between my first and second fingers I'd punched the\nbutton with my thumb just as I'd promised myself I would if I got to\nreally feeling bad.\n\nIt goes to show you that you should never give your mind any kind of\ninstructions even half in fun, unless you're prepared to have them\ncarried out whether you approve later or not.\n\nPop saw what I'd done and looked at me strangely. \"So you had to die\nafter all, Ray,\" he said softly. \"Most of us find out we have to, one\nway or another.\"\n\nWe waited. Nothing happened. I noticed a very faint milky cloud a few\ninches across hanging in the air by the cube.\n\nThinking right away of poison gas, I jerked away a little, dispersing\nthe cloud.\n\n\"What's that?\" I demanded of no one in particular.\n\n\"I'd say,\" said Pop, \"that that's something that squirted out of a tiny\nhole in the side of the cube opposite the button. A hole so nearly\nmicroscopic you wouldn't see it unless you looked for it hard. Ray, I\ndon't think you're going to get your baby A-blast, and what's more I'm\nafraid you've wasted something that's damn valuable. But don't let it\nworry you. Before I dropped those cubes for Atla-Hi I snagged one.\"\n\nAnd darn if he didn't pull the brother of my cube out of his pocket.\n\n\"Alice,\" he said, \"I noticed a half pint of whiskey in your satchel when\nwe got the salve. Would you put some on a rag and hand it to me.\"\n\nAlice looked at him like he was nuts, but while her eyes were looking\nher pliers and her gloved hand were doing what he told her.\n\nPop took the rag and swabbed a spot on the sick woman's nearest buttock\nand jammed the cube against the spot and pushed the button.\n\n\"It's a jet hypodermic, folks,\" he said.\n\nHe took the cube away and there was the welt to substantiate his\nstatement.\n\n\"Hope we got to her in time,\" he said. \"The plague is tough. Now I guess\nthere's nothing for us to do but wait, maybe for quite a while.\"\n\nI felt shaken beyond all recognition.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Pop, you old caveman detective!\" I burst out. \"When did you get that\nidea for a steel hospital?\" Don't think I was feeling anywhere near that\ngay. It was reaction, close to hysterical.\n\nPop was taken aback, but then he grinned. \"I had a couple of clues that\nyou and Alice didn't,\" he said. \"I knew there was a very sick woman\ninvolved. And I had that bout with Los Alamos fever I told you. They've\nhad a lot of trouble with it, I believe--some say its spores come from\noutside the world with the cosmic dust--and now it seems to have been\ncarried to Atla-Hi. Let's hope they've found the answer this time.\nAlice, maybe we'd better start getting some water into this gal.\"\n\nAfter a while we sat down and fitted the facts together more orderly.\nPop did the fitting mostly. Alamos researchers must have been working\nfor years on the plague as it ravaged intermittently, maybe with\nmutations and ET tricks to make the job harder. Very recently they'd\nfound a promising treatment (cure, we hoped) and prepared it for rush\nshipment to Atla-Hi, where the plague was raging too and they were\nsieged in by Savannah as well. Grayl was picked to fly the serum, or\ndrug or whatever it was. But he knew or guessed that this lone woman\nobserver (because she'd fallen out of radio communication or something)\nhad come down with the plague too and he decided to land some serum for\nher, probably without authorization.\n\n\"How do we know she's his girlfriend?\" I asked.\n\n\"Or wife,\" Pop said tolerantly. \"Why, there was that bag of woman's\nstuff he was carrying, frilly things like a man would bring for a woman.\nWho else'd he be apt to make a special stop for?\n\n\"Another thing,\" Pop said. \"He must have been using jets to hurry his\ntrip. We heard them, you know.\"\n\nThat seemed about as close a reconstruction of events as we could get.\nStrictly hypothetical, of course. Deathlanders trying to figure out what\ngoes on inside a \"country\" like Atla-Alamos and _why_ are sort of like\nfoxes trying to understand world politics, or wolves the Gothic\nmigrations. Of course we're all human beings, but that doesn't mean as\nmuch as it sounds.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen Pop told us how he'd happened to be on the scene. He'd been doing a\n\"tour of duty\", as he called it, when he spotted this woman's\nobservatory and decided to hang around anonymously and watch over her\nfor a few days and maybe help protect her from some dangerous characters\nthat he knew were in the neighborhood.\n\n\"Pop, that sounds like a lousy idea to me,\" I objected. \"Risky, I mean.\nSpying on another person, watching them without their knowing, would be\nthe surest way to stir up in me the idea of murdering them. Safest thing\nfor me to do in that situation would be to turn around and run.\"\n\n\"_You_ probably should,\" he agreed. \"For now, anyway. It's all a matter\nof knowing your own strength and stage of growth. Me, it helps to give\nmyself these little jobs. And the essence of 'em is that the other\nperson shouldn't know I'm helping.\"\n\nIt sounded like knighthood and pilgrimage and the Boy Scouts all over\nagain--for murderers. Well, why not?\n\nPop had seen this woman come out of the manhole a couple of times and\nlook around and then go back down and he'd got the impression she was\nsick and troubled. He'd even guessed she might be coming down with\nAlamos fever. He'd seen us arrive, of course, and that had bothered him.\nThen when the plane landed she'd come up again, acting out of her head,\nbut when she'd seen the Pilot and us going for him she'd given that\nscream and collapsed at the top of the shaft. He'd figured the only\nthing he could do for her was keep us occupied. Besides, now that he\nknew for sure we were murderers he'd started to burn with the desire to\ntalk to us and maybe help us quit killing if we seemed to want to. It\nwas only much later, in the middle of our trip, that he began to suspect\nthat the steel cubes were jet hypodermics.\n\nWhile Pop had been telling us all this, we hadn't been watching the\nwoman so closely. Now Alice called our attention to her. Her skin was\ncovered with fine beads of perspiration, like diamonds.\n\n\"That's a good sign,\" Pop said and Alice started to wipe her off. While\nshe was doing that the woman came to in a groggy sort of way and Pop fed\nher some thin soup and in the middle of his doing it she dropped off to\nsleep.\n\nAlice said, \"Any other time I would be wild to kill another woman that\nbeautiful. But she has been so close to death that I would feel I was\nrobbing another murderer. I suppose there is more behind the change in\nmy feelings than that, though.\"\n\n\"Yeah, a little, I suppose,\" Pop said.\n\nI didn't have anything to say about my own feelings. Certainly not out\nloud. I knew that they had changed and that they were still changing. It\nwas complicated.\n\nAfter a while it occurred to me and Alice to worry whether we mightn't\ncatch this woman's sickness. It would serve us right, of course, but\nplague is plague. But Pop reassured us. \"Actually I snagged three\ncubes,\" he said. \"That should take care of you two. I figure I'm\nimmune.\"\n\nTime wore on. Pop dragged out the harmonica, as I'd been afraid he\nwould, but his playing wasn't too bad. \"Tenting Tonight,\" \"When Johnnie\nComes Marching Home,\" and such. We had a meal.\n\nThe Pilot's woman woke up again, in her full mind this time or something\nlike it. We were clustered around the bed, smiling a little I suppose\nand looking inquiring. Being even assistant nurses makes you all\nconcerned about the patient's health and state of mind.\n\nPop helped her sit up a little. She looked around. She saw me and Alice.\nRecognition came into her eyes. She drew away from us with a look of\nloathing. She didn't say a word, but the look stayed.\n\nPop drew me aside and whispered, \"I think it would be a nice gesture if\nyou and Alice took a blanket and went up and sewed him into it. I\nnoticed a big needle and some thread in her satchel.\" He looked me in\nthe eye and added, \"You can't expect this woman to feel any other way\ntoward you, you know. Now or ever.\"\n\nHe was right of course. I gave Alice the high sign and we got out.\n\nNo point in dwelling on the next scene. Alice and me sewed up in a\nblanket a big guy who'd been dead a day and worked over by vultures.\nThat's all.\n\nAbout the time we'd finished, Pop came up.\n\n\"She chased me out,\" he explained. \"She's getting dressed. When I told\nher about the plane, she said she was going back to Los Alamos. She's\nnot fit to travel, of course, but she's giving herself injections. It's\nnone of our business. Incidentally, she wants to take the body back with\nher. I told her how we'd dropped the serum and how you and Alice had\nhelped and she listened.\"\n\nThe Pilot's woman wasn't long after Pop. She must have had trouble\ngetting up the shaft, she had a little trouble even walking straight,\nbut she held her head high. She was wearing a dull silver tunic and\nsandals and cloak. As she passed me and Alice I could see the look of\nloathing come back into her eyes, and her chin went a little higher. I\nthought, why shouldn't she want us dead? Right now she probably wants to\nbe dead herself.\n\nPop nodded to us and we hoisted up the body and followed her. It was\nalmost too heavy a load even for the three of us.\n\nAs she reached the plane a silver ladder telescoped down to her from\nbelow the door. I thought, _the Pilot must have had it keyed to her some\nway, so it would let down for her but nobody else. A very lovely\ngesture._\n\nThe ladder went up after her and we managed to lift the body above our\nheads, our arms straight, and we walked it through the door of the plane\nthat way, she receiving it.\n\nThe door closed and we stood back and the plane took off into the orange\nhaze, us watching it until it was swallowed.\n\nPop said, \"Right now, I imagine you two feel pretty good in a screwed-up\nsort of way. I know I do. But take it from me, it won't last. A day or\ntwo and we're going to start feeling another way, the _old_ way, if we\ndon't get busy.\"\n\nI knew he was right. You don't shake Old Urge Number One anything like\nthat easy.\n\n\"So,\" said Pop, \"I got places I want to show you. Guys I want you to\nmeet. And there's things to do, a lot of them. Let's get moving.\"\n\nSo there's my story. Alice is still with me (Urge Number Two is even\nharder to shake, supposing you wanted to) and we haven't killed anybody\nlately. (Not since the Pilot, in fact, but it doesn't do to boast.)\nWe're making a stab (my language!) at doing the sort of work Pop does in\nthe Deathlands. It's tough but interesting. I still carry a knife, but\nI've given Mother to Pop. He has it strapped to him alongside Alice's\nscrew-in blade.\n\nAtla-Hi and Alamos still seem to be in existence, so I guess the serum\nworked for them generally as it did for the Pilot's Woman; they haven't\nsent us any medals, but they haven't sent a hangman's squad after us\neither--which is more than fair, you'll admit. But Savannah, turned back\nfrom Atla-Hi, is still going strong: there's a rumor they have an army\nat the gates of Ouachita right now. We tell Pop he'd better start\npreaching fast--it's one of our standard jokes.\n\nThere's also a rumor that a certain fellowship of Deathlanders is doing\nsurprisingly well, a rumor that there's a new America growing in the\nDeathlands--an America that never need kill again. But don't put too\nmuch stock in it. Not _too_ much.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Science Fiction Stories_\n    January 1960.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
