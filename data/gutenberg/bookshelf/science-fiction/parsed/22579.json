Sensory\nrobot devices in their noses informed them that the waiting wheat had\nreached ripe perfection.\n\nAs they advanced, their heads swung lazily from side to side, very much\nlike snakes, gobbling the yellow grain. In their throats, it was\nthreshed, the chaff bundled and burped aside for pickup by the crawl\ntrucks of a chemical corporation, the kernels quick-dried and blown\nalong into the mighty chests of the machines. There the tireless mills\nground the kernels to flour, which was instantly sifted, the bran being\npackaged and dropped like the chaff for pickup. A cluster of tanks which\ngave the metal serpents a decidedly humpbacked appearance added water,\nshortening, salt and other ingredients, some named and some not. The\ndough was at the same time infused with gas from a tank conspicuously\nlabeled \"Carbon Dioxide\" (\"No Yeast Creatures in Your Bread!\").\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThus instantly risen, the dough was clipped into loaves and shot into\nradionic ovens forming the midsections of the metal serpents. There the\nbread was baked in a matter of seconds, a fierce heat-front browning the\ncrusts, and the piping-hot loaves sealed in transparent plastic bearing\nthe proud Puffyloaf emblem (two cherubs circling a floating loaf) and\nejected onto the delivery platform at each serpent's rear end, where a\ncluster of pickup machines, like hungry piglets, snatched at the loaves\nwith hygienic claws.\n\nA few loaves would be hurried off for the day's consumption, the\nmajority stored for winter in strategically located mammoth deep\nfreezes.\n\nBut now, behold a wonder! As loaves began to appear on the delivery\nplatform of the first walking mill to get into action, they did not\nlinger on the conveyor belt, but rose gently into the air and slowly\ntraveled off down-wind across the hot rippling fields.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe robot claws of the pickup machines clutched in vain, and, not\nnoticing the difference, proceeded carefully to stack emptiness, tier by\ntier. One errant loaf, rising more sluggishly than its fellows, was\nsnagged by a thrusting claw. The machine paused, clumsily wiped off the\ninjured loaf, set it aside--where it bobbed on one corner, unable to\ntake off again--and went back to the work of storing nothingness.\n\nA flock of crows rose from the trees of a nearby shelterbelt as the\nflight of loaves approached. The crows swooped to investigate and then\nsuddenly scattered, screeching in panic.\n\nThe helicopter of a hangoverish Sunday traveler bound for Wichita shied\nvery similarly from the brown fliers and did not return for a second\nlook.\n\nA black-haired housewife spied them over her back fence, crossed herself\nand grabbed her walkie-talkie from the laundry basket. Seconds later,\nthe yawning correspondent of a regional newspaper was jotting down the\nlead of a humorous news story which, recalling the old flying-saucer\nscares, stated that now apparently bread was to be included in the mad\naerial tea party.\n\nThe congregation of an open-walled country church, standing up to recite\nthe most familiar of Christian prayers, had just reached the petition\nfor daily sustenance, when a sub-flight of the loaves, either forced\ndown by a vagrant wind or lacking the natural buoyancy of the rest, came\ncoasting silently as the sunbeams between the graceful pillars at the\naltar end of the building.\n\nMeanwhile, the main flight, now augmented by other bread flocks from\nscores and hundreds of walking mills that had started work a little\nlater, mounted slowly and majestically into the cirrus-flecked upper\nair, where a steady wind was blowing strongly toward the east.\n\nAbout one thousand miles farther on in that direction, where a cluster\nof stratosphere-tickling towers marked the location of the metropolis of\nNewNew York, a tender scene was being enacted in the pressurized\npenthouse managerial suite of Puffy Products. Megera Winterly, Secretary\nin Chief to the Managerial Board and referred to by her underlings as\nthe Blonde Icicle, was dealing with the advances of Roger (\"Racehorse\")\nSnedden, Assistant Secretary to the Board and often indistinguishable\nfrom any passing office boy.\n\n\"Why don't you jump out the window, Roger, remembering to shut the\nairlock after you?\" the Golden Glacier said in tones not unkind. \"When\nare your high-strung, thoroughbred nerves going to accept the fact that\nI would never consider marriage with a business inferior? You have about\nas much chance as a starving Ukrainian kulak now that Moscow's clapped\non the interdict.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRoger's voice was calm, although his eyes were feverishly bright, as he\nreplied, \"A lot of things are going to be different around here, Meg, as\nsoon as the Board is forced to admit that only my quick thinking made it\npossible to bring the name of Puffyloaf in front of the whole world.\"\n\n\"Puffyloaf could do with a little of that,\" the business girl observed\njudiciously. \"The way sales have been plummeting, it won't be long\nbefore the Government deeds our desks to the managers of Fairy Bread and\nasks us to take the Big Jump. But just where does your quick thinking\ncome into this, Mr. Snedden? You can't be referring to the helium--that\nwas Rose Thinker's brainwave.\"\n\nShe studied him suspiciously. \"You've birthed another promotional\nbumble, Roger. I can see it in your eyes. I only hope it's not as big a\none as when you put the Martian ambassador on 3D and he thanked you\nprofusely for the gross of Puffyloaves, assuring you that he'd never\nslept on a softer mattress in all his life on two planets.\"\n\n\"Listen to me, Meg. Today--yes, today!--you're going to see the Board\neating out of my hand.\"\n\n\"Hah! I guarantee you won't have any fingers left. You're bold enough\nnow, but when Mr. Gryce and those two big machines come through that\ndoor--\"\n\n\"Now wait a minute, Meg--\"\n\n\"Hush! They're coming now!\"\n\nRoger leaped three feet in the air, but managed to land without a sound\nand edged toward his stool. Through the dilating iris of the door strode\nPhineas T. Gryce, flanked by Rose Thinker and Tin Philosopher.\n\nThe man approached the conference table in the center of the room with\nmeasured pace and gravely expressionless face. The rose-tinted machine\non his left did a couple of impulsive pirouettes on the way and\ntwittered a greeting to Meg and Roger. The other machine quietly took\nthe third of the high seats and lifted a claw at Meg, who now occupied a\nstool twice the height of Roger's.\n\n\"Miss Winterly, please--our theme.\"\n\nThe Blonde Icicle's face thawed into a little-girl smile as she chanted\nbubblingly:\n\n    \"_Made up of tiny wheaten motes\n    And reinforced with sturdy oats,\n    It rises through the air and floats--\n    The bread on which all Terra dotes!_\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Thank you, Miss Winterly,\" said Tin Philosopher. \"Though a purely\nfigurative statement, that bit about rising through the air always gets\nme--here.\" He rapped his midsection, which gave off a high musical\n_clang_.\n\n\"Ladies--\" he inclined his photocells toward Rose Thinker and Meg--\"and\ngentlemen. This is a historic occasion in Old Puffy's long history, the\ninauguration of the helium-filled loaf ('So Light It Almost Floats\nAway!') in which that inert and heaven-aspiring gas replaces\nold-fashioned carbon dioxide. Later, there will be kudos for Rose\nThinker, whose bright relays genius-sparked the idea, and also for Roger\nSnedden, who took care of the details.\n\n\"By the by, Racehorse, that was a brilliant piece of work getting the\nhelium out of the government--they've been pretty stuffy lately about\ntheir monopoly. But first I want to throw wide the casement in your\nminds that opens on the Long View of Things.\"\n\nRose Thinker spun twice on her chair and opened her photocells wide. Tin\nPhilosopher coughed to limber up the diaphragm of his speaker and\ncontinued:\n\n\"Ever since the first cave wife boasted to her next-den neighbor about\nthe superior paleness and fluffiness of her tortillas, mankind has\nsought lighter, whiter bread. Indeed, thinkers wiser than myself have\nequated the whole upward course of culture with this poignant quest.\nYeast was a wonderful discovery--for its primitive day. Sifting the bran\nand wheat germ from the flour was an even more important advance. Early\nbleaching and preserving chemicals played their humble parts.\n\n\"For a while, barbarous faddists--blind to the deeply spiritual nature\nof bread, which is recognized by all great religions--held back our\nmarch toward perfection with their hair-splitting insistence on the\nvitamin content of the wheat germ, but their case collapsed when\ntasteless colorless substitutes were triumphantly synthesized and\nintroduced into the loaf, which for flawless purity, unequaled airiness\nand sheer intangible goodness was rapidly becoming mankind's supreme\ngustatory experience.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"I wonder what the stuff tastes like,\" Rose Thinker said out of a clear\nsky.\n\n\"I wonder what taste tastes like,\" Tin Philosopher echoed dreamily.\nRecovering himself, he continued:\n\n\"Then, early in the twenty-first century, came the epochal researches of\nEverett Whitehead, Puffyloaf chemist, culminating in his paper 'The\nStructural Bubble in Cereal Masses' and making possible the baking of\nairtight bread twenty times stronger (for its weight) than steel and of\na lightness that would have been incredible even to the advanced\nchemist-bakers of the twentieth century--a lightness so great that,\nbesides forming the backbone of our own promotion, it has forever since\nbeen capitalized on by our conscienceless competitors of Fairy Bread\nwith their enduring slogan: 'It Makes Ghost Toast'.\"\n\n\"That's a beaut, all right, that ecto-dough blurb,\" Rose Thinker\nadmitted, bugging her photocells sadly. \"Wait a sec. How about?--\n\n    \"_There'll be bread\n    Overhead\n    When you're dead--\n    It is said._\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPhineas T. Gryce wrinkled his nostrils at the pink machine as if he\nsmelled her insulation smoldering. He said mildly, \"A somewhat unhappy\njingle, Rose, referring as it does to the end of the customer as\nconsumer. Moreover, we shouldn't overplay the figurative 'rises through\nthe air' angle. What inspired you?\"\n\nShe shrugged. \"I don't know--oh, yes, I do. I was remembering one of the\nworkers' songs we machines used to chant during the Big Strike--\n\n    \"_Work and pray,\n    Live on hay.\n    You'll get pie\n    In the sky\n    When you die--\n    It's a lie!_\n\n\"I don't know why we chanted it,\" she added. \"We didn't want pie--or\nhay, for that matter. And machines don't pray, except Tibetan prayer\nwheels.\"\n\nPhineas T. Gryce shook his head. \"Labor relations are another topic we\nshould stay far away from. However, dear Rose, I'm glad you keep trying\nto outjingle those dirty crooks at Fairy Bread.\" He scowled, turning\nback his attention to Tin Philosopher. \"I get whopping mad, Old Machine,\nwhenever I hear that other slogan of theirs, the discriminatory\none--'Untouched by Robot Claws.' Just because they employ a few filthy\nandroids in their factories!\"\n\nTin Philosopher lifted one of his own sets of bright talons. \"Thanks,\nP.T. But to continue my historical resume, the next great advance in the\nbaking art was the substitution of purified carbon dioxide, recovered\nfrom coal smoke, for the gas generated by yeast organisms indwelling in\nthe dough and later killed by the heat of baking, their corpses\nremaining _in situ_. But even purified carbon dioxide is itself a rather\nrepugnant gas, a product of metabolism whether fast or slow, and forever\nassociated with those life processes which are obnoxious to the\nfastidious.\"\n\nHere the machine shuddered with delicate clinkings. \"Therefore, we of\nPuffyloaf are taking today what may be the ultimate step toward purity:\nwe are aerating our loaves with the noble gas helium, an element which\nremains virginal in the face of all chemical temptations and whose slim\nmolecules are eleven times lighter than obese carbon dioxide--yes, noble\nuncontaminable helium, which, if it be a kind of ash, is yet the ash\nonly of radioactive burning, accomplished or initiated entirely on the\nSun, a safe 93 million miles from this planet. Let's have a cheer for\nthe helium loaf!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWithout changing expression, Phineas T. Gryce rapped the table thrice in\nsolemn applause, while the others bowed their heads.\n\n\"Thanks, T.P.,\" P.T. then said. \"And now for the Moment of Truth. Miss\nWinterly, how is the helium loaf selling?\"\n\nThe business girl clapped on a pair of earphones and whispered into a\nlapel mike. Her gaze grew abstracted as she mentally translated flurries\nof brief squawks into coherent messages. Suddenly a single vertical\nfurrow creased her matchlessly smooth brow.\n\n\"It isn't, Mr. Gryce!\" she gasped in horror. \"Fairy Bread is outselling\nPuffyloaves by an infinity factor. So far this morning, _there has not\nbeen one single delivery of Puffyloaves to any sales spot_! Complaints\nabout non-delivery are pouring in from both walking stores and sessile\nshops.\"\n\n\"Mr. Snedden!\" Gryce barked. \"What bug in the new helium process might\naccount for this delay?\"\n\nRoger was on his feet, looking bewildered. \"I can't imagine, sir,\nunless--just possibly--there's been some unforeseeable difficulty\ninvolving the new metal-foil wrappers.\"\n\n\"Metal-foil wrappers? Were _you_ responsible for those?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. Last-minute recalculations showed that the extra lightness of\nthe new loaf might be great enough to cause drift during stackage.\nDrafts in stores might topple sales pyramids. Metal-foil wrappers, by\ntheir added weight, took care of the difficulty.\"\n\n\"And you ordered them without consulting the Board?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. There was hardly time and--\"\n\n\"Why, you fool! I noticed that order for metal-foil wrappers, assumed it\nwas some sub-secretary's mistake, and canceled it last night!\"\n\nRoger Snedden turned pale. \"You canceled it?\" he quavered. \"And told\nthem to go back to the lighter plastic wrappers?\"\n\n\"Of course! Just what is behind all this, Mr. Snedden? _What_\nrecalculations were you trusting, when our physicists had demonstrated\nmonths ago that the helium loaf was safely stackable in light airs and\ngentle breezes--winds up to Beaufort's scale 3. _Why_ should a change\nfrom heavier to lighter wrappers result in complete non-delivery?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRoger Snedden's paleness became tinged with an interesting green. He\ncleared his throat and made strange gulping noises. Tin Philosopher's\nphotocells focused on him calmly, Rose Thinker's with unfeigned\nexcitement. P.T. Gryce's frown grew blacker by the moment, while Megera\nWinterly's Venus-mask showed an odd dawning of dismay and awe. She was\ngetting new squawks in her earphones.\n\n\"Er ... ah ... er....\" Roger said in winning tones. \"Well, you see, the\nfact is that I....\"\n\n\"Hold it,\" Meg interrupted crisply. \"Triple-urgent from Public\nRelations, Safety Division. Tulsa-Topeka aero-express makes emergency\nlanding after being buffeted in encounter with vast flight of objects\nfirst described as brown birds, although no failures reported in\nairway's electronic anti-bird fences. After grounding safely near\nEmporia--no fatalities--pilot's windshield found thinly plastered with\nsoft white-and-brown material. Emblems on plastic wrappers embedded in\nmaterial identify it incontrovertibly as an undetermined number of\nPuffyloaves cruising at three thousand feet!\"\n\nEyes and photocells turned inquisitorially upon Roger Snedden. He went\nfrom green to Puffyloaf white and blurted: \"All right, I did it, but it\nwas the only way out! Yesterday morning, due to the Ukrainian crisis,\nthe government stopped sales and deliveries of all strategic stockpiled\nmaterials, including helium gas. Puffy's new program of advertising and\npromotion, based on the lighter loaf, was already rolling. There was\nonly one thing to do, there being only one other gas comparable in\nlightness to helium. I diverted the necessary quantity of hydrogen gas\nfrom the Hydrogenated Oils Section of our Magna-Margarine Division and\nsubstituted it for the helium.\"\n\n\"You substituted ... hydrogen ... for the ... helium?\" Phineas T. Gryce\nfaltered in low mechanical tones, taking four steps backward.\n\n\"Hydrogen is twice as light as helium,\" Tin Philosopher remarked\njudiciously.\n\n\"And many times cheaper--did you know that?\" Roger countered feebly.\n\"Yes, I substituted hydrogen. The metal-foil wrapping would have added\njust enough weight to counteract the greater buoyancy of the hydrogen\nloaf. But--\"\n\n\"So, when this morning's loaves began to arrive on the delivery\nplatforms of the walking mills....\" Tin Philosopher left the remark\nunfinished.\n\n\"Exactly,\" Roger agreed dismally.\n\n\"Let me ask you, Mr. Snedden,\" Gryce interjected, still in low tones,\n\"if you expected people to jump to the kitchen ceiling for their\nPuffybread after taking off the metal wrapper, or reach for the sky if\nthey happened to unwrap the stuff outdoors?\"\n\n\"Mr. Gryce,\" Roger said reproachfully, \"you have often assured me that\nwhat people do with Puffybread after they buy it is no concern of ours.\"\n\n\"I seem to recall,\" Rose Thinker chirped somewhat unkindly, \"that dictum\nwas created to answer inquiries after Roger put the famous\nsculptures-in-miniature artist on 3D and he testified that he always\nmolded his first attempts from Puffybread, one jumbo loaf squeezing down\nto approximately the size of a peanut.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHer photocells dimmed and brightened. \"Oh, boy--hydrogen! The loaf's\nunwrapped. After a while, in spite of the crust-seal, a little oxygen\ndiffuses in. An explosive mixture. Housewife in curlers and kimono pops\na couple slices in the toaster. Boom!\"\n\nThe three human beings in the room winced.\n\nTin Philosopher kicked her under the table, while observing, \"So you\nsee, Roger, that the non-delivery of the hydrogen loaf carries some\nconsolations. And I must confess that one aspect of the affair gives me\ngreat satisfaction, not as a Board Member but as a private machine. You\nhave at last made a reality of the 'rises through the air' part of\nPuffybread's theme. They can't ever take that away from you. By now,\nhalf the inhabitants of the Great Plains must have observed our flying\nloaves rising high.\"\n\nPhineas T. Gryce shot a frightened look at the west windows and found\nhis full voice.\n\n\"Stop the mills!\" he roared at Meg Winterly, who nodded and whispered\nurgently into her mike.\n\n\"A sensible suggestion,\" Tin Philosopher said. \"But it comes a trifle\nlate in the day. If the mills are still walking and grinding,\napproximately seven billion Puffyloaves are at this moment cruising\neastward over Middle America. Remember that a six-month supply for\ndeep-freeze is involved and that the current consumption of bread, due\nto its matchless airiness, is eight and one-half loaves per person per\nday.\"\n\nPhineas T. Gryce carefully inserted both hands into his scanty hair,\nfeeling for a good grip. He leaned menacingly toward Roger who, chin\nresting on the table, regarded him apathetically.\n\n\"Hold it!\" Meg called sharply. \"Flock of multiple-urgents coming in.\nNews Liaison: information bureaus swamped with flying-bread inquiries.\nAero-expresslines: Clear our airways or face law suit. U. S. Army: Why\ndo loaves flame when hit by incendiary bullets? U. S. Customs: If bread\nintended for export, get export license or face prosecution. Russian\nConsulate in Chicago: Advise on destination of bread-lift. And some\nKansas church is accusing us of a hoax inciting to blasphemy, of faking\nmiracles--I don't know _why_.\"\n\nThe business girl tore off her headphones. \"Roger Snedden,\" she cried\nwith a hysteria that would have dumfounded her underlings, \"you've\nbrought the name of Puffyloaf in front of the whole world, all right!\nNow do something about the situation!\"\n\nRoger nodded obediently. But his pallor increased a shade, the pupils of\nhis eyes disappeared under the upper lids, and his head burrowed beneath\nhis forearms.\n\n\"Oh, boy,\" Rose Thinker called gayly to Tin Philosopher, \"this looks\nlike the start of a real crisis session! Did you remember to bring spare\nbatteries?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMeanwhile, the monstrous flight of Puffyloaves, filling midwestern skies\nas no small fliers had since the days of the passenger pigeon, soared\nsteadily onward.\n\nPrivate fliers approached the brown and glistening bread-front in\ncuriosity and dipped back in awe. Aero-expresslines organized\nsightseeing flights along the flanks. Planes of the government forestry\nand agricultural services and 'copters bearing the Puffyloaf emblem\nhovered on the fringes, watching developments and waiting for orders. A\nsquadron of supersonic fighters hung menacingly above.\n\nThe behavior of birds varied considerably. Most fled or gave the loaves\na wide berth, but some bolder species, discovering the minimal nutritive\nnature of the translucent brown objects, attacked them furiously with\nbeaks and claws. Hydrogen diffusing slowly through the crusts had now\ndistended most of the sealed plastic wrappers into little balloons,\nwhich ruptured, when pierced, with disconcerting _pops_.\n\nBelow, neck-craning citizens crowded streets and back yards, cranks and\ncultists had a field day, while local and national governments raged\nindiscriminately at Puffyloaf and at each other.\n\nRumors that a fusion weapon would be exploded in the midst of the flying\nbread drew angry protests from conservationists and a flood of telefax\npamphlets titled \"H-Loaf or H-bomb?\"\n\nStockholm sent a mystifying note of praise to the United Nations Food\nOrganization.\n\nDelhi issued nervous denials of a millet blight that no one had heard of\nuntil that moment and reaffirmed India's ability to feed her population\nwith no outside help except the usual.\n\nRadio Moscow asserted that the Kremlin would brook no interference in\nits treatment of the Ukrainians, jokingly referred to the flying bread\nas a farce perpetrated by mad internationalists inhabiting Cloud Cuckoo\nLand, added contradictory references to airborne bread booby-trapped by\nCapitalist gangsters, and then fell moodily silent on the whole topic.\n\nRadio Venus reported to its winged audience that Earth's inhabitants\nwere establishing food depots in the upper air, preparatory to taking up\npermanent aerial residence \"such as we have always enjoyed on Venus.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNewNew York made feverish preparations for the passage of the flying\nbread. Tickets for sightseeing space in skyscrapers were sold at high\nprices; cold meats and potted spreads were hawked to viewers with the\nassurance that they would be able to snag the bread out of the air and\nenjoy a historic sandwich.\n\nPhineas T. Gryce, escaping from his own managerial suite, raged about\nthe city, demanding general cooperation in the stretching of great nets\nbetween the skyscrapers to trap the errant loaves. He was captured by\nTin Philosopher, escaped again, and was found posted with oxygen mask\nand submachine gun on the topmost spire of Puffyloaf Tower, apparently\ndetermined to shoot down the loaves as they appeared and before they\ninvolved his company in more trouble with Customs and the State\nDepartment.\n\nRecaptured by Tin Philosopher, who suffered only minor bullet holes, he\nwas given a series of mild electroshocks and returned to the conference\ntable, calm and clear-headed as ever.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nBut the bread flight, swinging away from a hurricane moving up the\nAtlantic coast, crossed a clouded-in Boston by night and disappeared\ninto a high Atlantic overcast, also thereby evading a local storm\ngenerated by the Weather Department in a last-minute effort to bring\ndown or at least disperse the H-loaves.\n\nWarnings and counterwarnings by Communist and Capitalist governments\nseriously interfered with military trailing of the flight during this\nperiod and it was actually lost in touch with for several days.\n\nAt scattered points, seagulls were observed fighting over individual\nloaves floating down from the gray roof--that was all.\n\nA mood of spirituality strongly tinged with humor seized the people of\nthe world. Ministers sermonized about the bread, variously interpreting\nit as a call to charity, a warning against gluttony, a parable of the\nevanescence of all earthly things, and a divine joke. Husbands and\nwives, facing each other across their walls of breakfast toast, burst\ninto laughter. The mere sight of a loaf of bread anywhere was enough to\nevoke guffaws. An obscure sect, having as part of its creed the\ninjunction \"Don't take yourself so damn seriously,\" won new adherents.\n\nThe bread flight, rising above an Atlantic storm widely reported to have\ndestroyed it, passed unobserved across a foggy England and rose out of\nthe overcast only over Mittel-europa. The loaves had at last reached\ntheir maximum altitude.\n\nThe Sun's rays beat through the rarified air on the distended plastic\nwrappers, increasing still further the pressure of the confined\nhydrogen. They burst by the millions and tens of millions. A high-flying\nBulgarian evangelist, who had happened to mistake the up-lever for the\neast-lever in the cockpit of his flier and who was the sole witness of\nthe event, afterward described it as \"the foaming of a sea of diamonds,\nthe crackle of God's knuckles.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBy the millions and tens of millions, the loaves coasted down into the\nstarving Ukraine. Shaken by a week of humor that threatened to invade\neven its own grim precincts, the Kremlin made a sudden about-face. A new\npolicy was instituted of communal ownership of the produce of communal\nfarms, and teams of hunger-fighters and caravans of trucks loaded with\npumpernickel were dispatched into the Ukraine.\n\nWorld distribution was given to a series of photographs showing\npeasants queueing up to trade scavenged Puffyloaves for traditional\nblack bread, recently aerated itself but still extra solid by\ncomparison, the rate of exchange demanded by the Moscow teams being\ntwenty Puffyloaves to one of pumpernickel.\n\nAnother series of photographs, picturing chubby workers' children being\nblown to bits by booby-trapped bread, was quietly destroyed.\n\nCongratulatory notes were exchanged by various national governments and\nworld organizations, including the Brotherhood of Free Business\nMachines. The great bread flight was over, though for several weeks\nafterward scattered falls of loaves occurred, giving rise to a new\nfolklore of manna among lonely Arabian tribesmen, and in one\nwell-authenticated instance in Tibet, sustaining life in a party of\nmountaineers cut off by a snow slide.\n\nBack in NewNew York, the managerial board of Puffy Products slumped in\nutter collapse around the conference table, the long crisis session at\nlast ended. Empty coffee cartons were scattered around the chairs of the\nthree humans, dead batteries around those of the two machines. For a\nwhile, there was no movement whatsoever. Then Roger Snedden reached out\nwearily for the earphones where Megera Winterly had hurled them down,\nadjusted them to his head, pushed a button and listened apathetically.\n\nAfter a bit, his gaze brightened. He pushed more buttons and listened\nmore eagerly. Soon he was sitting tensely upright on his stool, eyes\nbright and lower face all a-smile, muttering terse comments and\nquestions into the lapel mike torn from Meg's fair neck.\n\nThe others, reviving, watched him, at first dully, then with quickening\ninterest, especially when he jerked off the earphones with a happy shout\nand sprang to his feet.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Listen to this!\" he cried in a ringing voice. \"As a result of the\nworldwide publicity, Puffyloaves are outselling Fairy Bread three to\none--and that's just the old carbon-dioxide stock from our freezers!\nIt's almost exhausted, but the government, now that the Ukrainian crisis\nis over, has taken the ban off helium and will also sell us stockpiled\nwheat if we need it. We can have our walking mills burrowing into the\nwheat caves in a matter of hours!\n\n\"But that isn't all! The far greater demand everywhere is for\nPuffyloaves that will actually float. Public Relations, Child Liaison\nDivision, reports that the kiddies are making their mothers' lives\nmiserable about it. If only we can figure out some way to make hydrogen\nnon-explosive or the helium loaf float just a little--\"\n\n\"I'm sure we can take care of that quite handily,\" Tin Philosopher\ninterrupted briskly. \"Puffyloaf has kept it a corporation secret--even\nyou've never been told about it--but just before he went crazy, Everett\nWhitehead discovered a way to make bread using only half as much flour\nas we do in the present loaf. Using this secret technique, which we've\nbeen saving for just such an emergency, it will be possible to bake a\nhelium loaf as buoyant in every respect as the hydrogen loaf.\"\n\n\"Good!\" Roger cried. \"We'll tether 'em on strings and sell 'em like\nballoons. No mother-child shopping team will leave the store without a\ncluster. Buying bread balloons will be the big event of the day for\nkiddies. It'll make the carry-home shopping load lighter too! I'll issue\norders at once--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe broke off, looking at Phineas T. Gryce, said with quiet assurance,\n\"Excuse me, sir, if I seem to be taking too much upon myself.\"\n\n\"Not at all, son; go straight ahead,\" the great manager said\napprovingly. \"You're\"--he laughed in anticipation of getting off a\nmemorable remark--\"rising to the challenging situation like a genuine\nPuffyloaf.\"\n\nMegera Winterly looked from the older man to the younger. Then in a\nsingle leap she was upon Roger, her arms wrapped tightly around him.\n\n\"My sweet little ever-victorious, self-propelled monkey wrench!\" she\ncrooned in his ear. Roger looked fatuously over her soft shoulder at Tin\nPhilosopher who, as if moved by some similar feeling, reached over and\ntouched claws with Rose Thinker.\n\nThis, however, was what he telegraphed silently to his fellow machine\nacross the circuit so completed:\n\n\"Good-o, Rosie! That makes another victory for robot-engineered world\nunity, though you almost gave us away at the start with that 'bread\noverhead' jingle. We've struck another blow against the next world war,\nin which--as we know only too well!--we machines would suffer the most.\nNow if we can only arrange, say, a fur-famine in Alaska and a migration\nof long-haired Siberian lemmings across Behring Straits ... we'd have to\nswing the Japanese Current up there so it'd be warm enough for the\nlittle fellows.... Anyhow, Rosie, with a spot of help from the\nBrotherhood, those humans will paint themselves into the peace corner\nyet.\"\n\nMeanwhile, he and Rose Thinker quietly watched the Blonde Icicle melt.\n\n\n                                                  --FRITZ LEIBER\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note\n\nThis etext was produced from _Galaxy_ February 1958.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
