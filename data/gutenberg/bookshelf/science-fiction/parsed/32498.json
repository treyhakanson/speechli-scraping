It filled a whole mountain--and then\nit came to life...!]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nCautiously the young flight engineer stretched his cramped legs across\nsome gadgets in his crowded little compartment. Leaning back in his\nswivel chair he folded a pair of freckled hands behind his neck and\nsmiled at Lee.\n\n\"This is it doctor; we're almost there.\"\n\nThe tall and lanky man at the frame of the door didn't seem to\nunderstand. Bending forward he peered through the little window near the\nengineer's desk, into the blue haze of the jets and down to the earth\nbelow, a vast bowl of desert land gleaming like silver in the glow of\nthe sunrise.\n\n\"But this couldn't possibly be Washington,\" he finally said in a puzzled\ntone. \"Why, we crossed the California coast only half an hour ago. Even\nat 1200 miles an hour we couldn't be almost there.\"\n\nThe engineer's smile broadened into a friendly grin: \"No, we're not\nanywhere near Washington. But in a couple of minutes you'll see Cephalon\nand that's as far as we go. One professor and 15 tons of termites to be\nflown from Wallabawalla Mission station, Northern Territory, Australia,\nto Cephalon, Arizona, U.S.A., one way direct. Those are our\ninstructions. Say, this is the queerest cargo I've ever flown, doctor,\nif you don't mind my saying so.\"\n\nLee blinked. Removing his glasses which were fairly thick, he wiped them\ncarefully and put them on again as if to get a clearer picture of an\nunexpected situation. His long fingered hand went through his greying\nhair and then down the cheek which was sallow, stained with the atabrine\nfrom his latest malaria attack and badly in need of a shave. His mouth\nformed a big \"O\" of surprise as nervously he said:\n\n\"I don't get it. I don't understand this business at all. First the\nDepartment of Agriculture extends an urgent letter of invitation to a\ncompletely forgotten man out there in the Never-Never land. Then almost\non the heels of the letter the government sends a plane. I would have\nbeen glad to mail to the Department samples of \"Ant-termes Pacificus\"\nsufficient for most scientific purposes if they needed them for\nexperiments in termite control; that would have been the simple and the\nsensible thing to do. But no, they want everything I have; you fellows\ndrop out of the sky with a sort of habeas corpus and a whole wrecking\ncrew. You disturb the lives of my species, which took me ten years to\nbreed; you pack up their mounds lock, stock and barrel. And then you\ndrop me at some place I never even heard about--Cephalon. What is this\nCephalon, anyway? If the place had any connotations to entomology, I\nwould have known about it....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe flight engineer glanced at the irritated scientist curiously and\nsympathetically: \"If you don't know, I couldn't tell you what it's all\nabout myself, I'm sure,\" he said slowly. \"Cephalon--Cephalon is a place\nalright, but it doesn't show on the map. Sort of a Shangri-la, if you\nknow what I mean.\"\n\nThis cryptic statement failed to have a calming effect on Lee.\n\"Nonsense,\" he frowned. \"If it is an inhabited place it must be on the\nmap and if it isn't on the map the place doesn't exist.\"\n\n\"Look here,\" the flight engineer pointed through the window to the\nhorizon ahead. \"What do you think this is, doctor, a mirage?\"\n\nLee stared at the apparition which swiftly materialized out of the\nground haze at the plane's supersonic speed. \"It _does_ look like a\nmirage,\" he said judiciously. \"Is that Cephalon?\"\n\nThe engineer nodded. \"Prettiest little town in the U. S. for my money.\nIdeal airport, too. Rather unusual though--I mean the architecture. Take\na good look while we're circling around for the come-in signal.\"\n\nPretty and unusual were hardly the words for it, Lee thought, as he\ngazed in admiration. Below, Cephalon spread like a visionary's dream of\na far-away future blended with a far-away past. Along wide, palm shaded\navenues the flat-roofed terraced houses fanned out into the desert.\nStyle elements of ancient Peru and Mexico were blended together with the\nlatest advances of technology, such as the rectangular sheets of water\nwhich covered and cooled the roofs. The business center, dotted with\nhelicopter landing fields on top of the pyramidal buildings, was\nreminiscent of the classic Babylon and Nineveh. At the center of the\nman-made oasis a huge fortress-like structure sprawled and towered like\na seven-pointed star. Even so, for all its impressiveness of masonry,\nthe lush green of its parks, the bursts of color from its hanging\ngardens, made Cephalon resemble one enormous flower bed.\n\nOverawed and mystified the lone passenger from Down-Under took in the\nscene while the big plane circled with diminished speed. \"It's\nbeautiful,\" he murmered. \"It's a dream.\" And louder then: \"Pardon me if\nI find it hard to trust my senses. I've been away from home for more\nthan ten years, to be sure. But then, even in the Australian bush I've\nreceived some periodicals and scientific journals from the U.S.A. Surely\nif a city like this has been built during my absence there should have\nbeen mention of the fact. And surely a city like this must show on some\nmap. I don't understand. The longer I look the less I understand....\"\n\nThe flight engineer shrugged. \"It's a new city, maybe that's why it\ndoesn't show.\"\n\nLee nodded. \"In that case you must know the meaning of all this. Why did\nthey build this city in the middle of the desert? What purpose does it\nserve? Why am I here? Why are we circling for so long? There don't seem\nto be any other planes up in the air.\"\n\n\"We cannot come in until our cargo has been examined and okayed,\" the\nengineer said.\n\nLee raised a pair of heavy and untidy brows: \"Cargo examination? In\nmid-air and with nobody from the ground examining it?\"\n\n\"That's it. It's being done by Radar, one of the new fangled kinds, you\nknow.\" He grinned: \"I hope, doctor, that your termite species is neither\nexplosive nor fissionable in any way. Because in that case we could\nnever make a landing in Cephalon.\"\n\n\"How utterly absurd,\" Lee said disgustedly. \"Even a child would know\nbetter. There is no war going on--or is there? What makes them take such\nabsurd precautions?\"\n\nThe engineer narrowed his eyes. \"You're an American, Dr. Lee, aren't\nyou? Well, in any case, I can see no reason why I should be beating\nabout the bush. After all, every foreign agent in this country must have\nlearned by now about the existence of Cephalon. It's too big to be\nsecret anyway. Besides, as you perceive, no attempt has been made to\ncamouflage the place. Cephalon and the whole district takes up about a\nthousand square miles. It's a military preserve. Only you don't see any\nBrass. What they are doing, I wouldn't know, but I would rather try to\nrob all the gold from Fort Knox than get away with a single scrap of\npaper from that Braintrust Building in the center of the city over\nthere. By the way, that skull shaped building right across the Plaza is\nthe official hotel reserved for very important persons, such as you are\nlisted.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA deep-throated buzz over the intercom interrupted him. \"There, thank\nGod, they finally made up their minds to let us in. One minute more and\nthen a shower, a shave, bacon and eggs, and lots of Java!\"\n\nThere were what appeared to Lee to be a multitude of people waiting as\nthey landed. Eager and intelligent white faces all lifted up to him and\npressed forward with bewildering offerings and requests. A Western Union\nmessenger handed him a telegram in which one Dr. Howard K. Scriven\nproffered greetings, expressing a desire to interview him. Some cleancut\nyoungster, obviously a scientific worker, assured Lee that he was fully\nfamiliar with the care and feeding of \"_Ant-termes-pacificus-Lee_\", that\nLee need not concern himself about their welfare, that the mounds would\nbe immediately transferred to Experimental Station 19 G. The \"Flying\nWing's\" supercargo and two truck-drivers came forward with papers for\nLee to sign, as the first of the heavy steelboxes which harbored the\nmounds were lowered into a van with the whine of an electric hoist.\nMeanwhile somebody who said he was an assistant manager of the Cranium\nhotel informed Lee that reservations had been made for him and that he\nhad a car waiting to conduct Dr. Lee to his suite. It was all very\nmysterious, but efficient. Feeling more and more like some prize exhibit\nhandled without a will of its own on a whirlwind tour, Lee allowed\nhimself to be whisked from the airport to the hotel. With the din of the\njets still in his ears, overpowered by impressions which crowded his\nsenses from all sides, he listened politely to the hotel manager's\nexplanations of the sights without understanding a word of them.\n\nThere were flowers in his suite, the carpets were deeper, the bathtub\nwas bigger, the towels piled higher, the breakfast more abundantly rich\nthan anything Lee could remember in the 38 years of his life. \"So this\nis America in 1960,\" he thought. \"It must have advanced by leaps and by\nbounds over these past ten years.\"\n\nHe felt embarrassed because he had almost forgotten the uses of all\nthose comforts, and at the same time deeply moved over the way they\nembraced him, him, the lost son, the voluntary exile who once had turned\nhis back on them in despair and disgust. But why was all this? He had\ndone nothing to deserve this kind of hospitality. Entomologists as a\nrule were not transported by magic carpets into Arabian Nights for\nmodest achievements such as the discovery of a new species. All the\nthings which had happened within the last 24 hours were riddles wrapped\nup in enigmas. Fatigued as he was he couldn't lie down, he was\ndesperately resolved to get at the bottom of this thing.\n\nThere came a buzz from the telephone. A soft and melodious contralto\nvoice announced that its carrier was Dr. Howard K. Scriven's secretary\nand would Dr. Lee be good enough to come over to the Braintrust Building\nto meet Dr. Scriven at 9:30 A.M.? Lee said that he would.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe distance across the Plaza was short enough, but as Lee entered the\nhall of the huge concrete pyramid he was reminded of Washington's\nPentagon in wartime, for his progress was halted right from the start\nand at more than one point. He had to line up at the receptionist's, he\nwas being checked over the phone, a pass was handed to him, and\nsomebody, obviously a plain-clothes man, took him to the express\nelevator which shot him up to the 40th floor.\n\nThere, another plain-clothes man conducted Lee through a long carpeted\ncorridor and up one flight of stairs to a steel door which slid open\nautomatically at their approach. Sunlight was flooding through its frame\nas Lee followed the guard and the door closed noiselessly behind them.\n\nThe man from Down-Under took a deep breath. He had not expected this for\nit was not a stepping in, but rather a stepping out from a vast tomb\ninto the light of day. This was the top of a huge pyramid, and was in an\nentirely different kind of world.\n\nThe terrace was laid with flagstones and landscaped like a luxurious\ncountry club. In its middle there arose a penthouse, low and irregularly\nshaped like some organic outcropping of native rock. It could hardly be\nsaid that it had walls, overgrown as was the stone by creepers and built\ninto the shape of massive pillars. The structure seemed a kind of\nStonehenge improved upon by America's late great architect Frank Lloyd\nWright. There were birch shade trees around the house, the leaves\nwhispering in the breeze. From some crevice in the rock came the\npeaceful murmurings of a spring. A meandering little brook criss-crossed\nthe gravel path under Lee's feet. From a stone table which might have\nbelonged to some Pharaoh there came the only incongruous noise in this\nbucolic idyll; it was the nervous ticking of a typewriter, which stopped\nabruptly at Lee's approach, and the melodious contralto voice he had\nalready heard over the phone greeted him. \"Oh--it's Dr. Lee from\nCanberra University, isn't it? I'm so happy to meet you. Please, do sit\ndown. How was your trip? I'm Oona Dahlborg, Dr. Scriven's secretary.\"\n\nLee blinked. Out of this world as was this Stone Age cabin in the sky,\neven more so was the girl. He had a vivid image of American girls as\nthey had been when he had left the States way back in '49; in fact, he\nhad an all too vivid memory of at least one of them. His memory had been\nrefreshed within the last hour at the airport, at the hotel, at the\nreceptionist's, and it had been confirmed: they still wore masks instead\nof their true faces, they still were overdressed, overloud, oversexed,\noverhung with trinkets and their voices still resounded shrilly from the\nroof of their mouths.\n\nThis girl Oona Dahlborg was different. He raked his brains to find some\nconcept which would express how she was different. The word \"organic\"\ncame to mind; yes, as one looked at her one sensed a unity of being, a\ncreatural whole compared to which those other girls appeared as\nartificial composites.\n\nShe was tall for a girl, the pure Scandinavian type, and she looked like\na young Viking with the golden helmet of her hair gleaming in the sun.\nShe wore a tunic, short, sleeveless and of classic simplicity, the kind\nof dress which once Diana wore. It revealed the splendor of her slender\nfigure and stressed the length of her full white limbs. On the black of\nthe tunic an antique necklace of large amber beads formed the only\nornament. The bow or the spear of the great huntress whom she resembled\nso much would have looked more natural in her hands than the typewriter;\neven so, her every move showed perfect coordination of body and mind, a\nlarge surplus of vital energy carefully controlled. Had she turned to\nsome different career she might easily have developed into some great\nathlete or else a great singer. Her beautiful voice had that rare\nnatural gift of using the whole thorax for a vessel of resonance instead\nof merely the mouth.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was this voice which fascinated Lee more than the strangeness of the\nscene, more than her beauty, more even than the things she said. It was\nlike remembering some haunting melody, it transported him into the\nforgotten land of his youth. It made him feel happy except that suddenly\nhe felt painfully conscious of his ill fitting suit, the emaciation of\nhis body, the atabrine stains on the skin of his face, the wildness and\nthe grey of his hair.\n\nWith the shyness of a boy, he accepted first the firm pressure of her\nhand and then a seat which was another piece of ancient Egyptian\nfurniture.\n\n\"Dr. Scriven will be with you in a few minutes,\" she said.\n\"Unfortunately he is a little delayed by an official visitor from\nWashington. The unexpected always happens over here. Meanwhile....\"\n\nShe suddenly interrupted herself. The searching look of her deep blue\neyes startled Lee by its directness. There was in it a depth of\nunderstanding and of sympathy which penetrated to his heart. He felt as\nif she already knew about him and knew everything. It lasted only a few\nseconds before she continued, but in a different, a warmer voice:\n\n\"I think we can drop the usual conventions,\" she said. \"We know you, Dr.\nScriven and I. We know your work as published in the journal of\nentomology. It is the work of a man of genius. You are not the kind of\nman whom I must entertain with the usual small talk about the weather,\nhow you have enjoyed your trip, or whether you feel very tired--as you\nprobably do--and all the rest of it. That is routine with most of our\nvisitors; it's quite a relief to feel that I can dispense with it for\nonce.\"\n\nLee had blushed under this frankness of compliment as if a decoration\nhad been pinned to his breast. \"Thank you, Miss Dahlberg, you put me at\nmy ease. I've been out in the wilderness for so long that I've lost the\nlanguage of the social amenities. I really feel like another Rip van\nWinkle. All this,\" he made a sweeping gesture, \"is tremendously new and\nsurprising to me. There are so many burning questions to ask....\"\n\nThe girl gave him a smile of sympathy. \"Of course,\" she said, \"and I can\nimagine some of them. To begin with, we owe you an explanation and an\napology for having used the methods of deception in getting you here. As\nyou probably know by now the work we're doing here is closely connected\nwith the National defense. Whether we like it or not, military secrecy\nforces us to use roundabout ways in contacting scientists who happen to\nwork in some context with our field, especially if they live in foreign\nlands. That's why in your case we have used the good offices of the\nDepartment of Agriculture in bringing you here. Dr. Scriven feels\nterrible about this. He feels that to be lifted out from one desert just\nto be dropped into the middle of another must be a fierce disappointment\nto you. For this and all the disturbance of your work--can you manage to\nforgive us Dr. Lee?\"\n\nThe sincerity in these regrets was such that Lee hastened to reply: \"You\ndon't owe me any apology, Miss Dahlborg,\" he reassured her. \"Naturally\nit is impossible for me to see any connection between my work with ants\nand termites and the problems of National Defense. But I am an American;\nI wouldn't doubt for a moment the legitimacy of your call.\" The girl\nnodded: \"Besides you have fought for your country in the second world\nwar,\" she added. \"And also you are the son of General Jefferson Lee of\nthe Marines. You understand of course that we had you investigated\nbefore calling you here; do you mind very much?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAgain Lee blushed; this time even deeper than before. He squirmed in his\nseat. \"No, I guess not. I suppose it's necessary. Now that I'm going to\nmeet Dr. Scriven, who is he? I probably ought to know--forgive my\nignorance.\"\n\n\"You really don't know about him?\" The girl sounded surprised. \"He's a\nsurgeon. He's considered the foremost living brain-specialist. Remember\nthe Nuremberg trials of the Nazi war criminals? Dr. Scriven did the\npost-mortems on their brains. He wrote a book that made him famous.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Lee slapped his forehead. \"Yes, but of course, how could I\nforget.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered, \"He was made the head of the Braintrust over here.\"\n\n\"What is the Braintrust? What does it do? What am I supposed to do\nhere?\" Lee asked eagerly.\n\nThe girl's smile was mysterious: \"I think Howard would like to explain\nall that to you in his own way.\"\n\n\"Howard\". The word struck Lee like a vicious little snake. Was he a\nfriend, or more than a friend to her? \"This is terrible,\" he thought,\n\"I've been away from normal life for overlong. Must be that I'm\nemotionally unbalanced. I haven't known her for five minutes. There is\nnothing between us. I've no earthly right to be jealous; it is absurd,\nit's mean.\"\n\nHe felt deeply ashamed. Yet as he looked at her he couldn't deny the\ntruth before himself: that he _was_ jealous, that he _had_ fallen in\nlove with a girl who looked like the goddess Diana with a golden helmet\nfor hair.\n\nThere was a noise of footsteps on the gravel paths. A man with a\nportfolio under his arm walked briskly by the stonetable; despite his\ncivilian clothes he had \"Westpoint\" written all over him. He disappeared\nthrough the steel door.\n\n\"That was General Vandergeest\", Oona said. \"Dr. Scriven will see you\nnow; just walk in, Dr. Lee.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nInside, the cabin in the sky seemed to be built almost entirely around a\nhuge primeval looking fireplace. Despite the fierceness of the Arizona\nsun there was a fire in it of long and bluish flames, one of those\nmodern inventions which reverse the processes of nature. Like the gas\nrefrigerators of an older period, this fire worked in combination with\nthe airconditioning system to _cool_ the house, lending to it in the\nmidst of summer heat the same attractions which it had in winter.\n\nIn front of the fire and framed by its rather ghostly light, there stood\na man with his head bowed down, pensively staring at the flames. As\nLee's steps resounded from the ancient millstones which formed the\nfloor, Dr. Scriven wheeled around; he approached the man from Down-Under\nwith outstretched hands.\n\nRarely had Lee seen such a distinguished looking figure of a man. He\nlooked more like a diplomat of the extinct old school than a scientist,\nwith the immaculate expanse of his white tropical suit and the dignity\nof his leonine head. His width of shoulder and the smooth agility with\nwhich he moved gave the impression of great strength. Only his fingers\nwere small, slender, almost like a woman's.\n\nThe reluctant softness of their pressure contrasted so much with his\nheartiness of manner that Lee felt repulsed by their touch until he\nremembered that a great surgeon lived and caused others to live by his\nsensitivity of hand.\n\n\"Dr. Lee, I'm happy, most happy, that you have been able to come.\"\nScriven's voice was soft, but he spoke with an extraordinary precision\nof diction which had a quality almost of command. \"Over there, please,\nby the fire....\"\n\nFrom the blue flames there came the freshness and the coolness of an\nocean breeze; the rawhide chairs, built for barbaric chieftains as they\nseemed, proved to be most comfortable; the semidarkness, the roughness\nof the unhewn stone, gave a sense of the phantastical and the paradox.\nLee sat and waited patiently for Scriven to explain.\n\n\"In case you're wondering a little about this setup,\" Scriven made a\nsweeping gesture around the room, \"I've long since reached the\nconclusion that in these mad times a man needs above all some padded\ncell, some shell in which to retire and preserve his sanity. This is my\npadded cell, soundproof, lightproof, telephoneproof; a wholesome\nreminder of the basic, the primeval things. Simple, isn't it?\"\n\nLee blinked at the extravagance of this statement. \"Do you really call\nthat simple?\" he asked.\n\nScriven grinned: \"You are right; it is of course a willed reversal from\nthe complex, synthetic and perhaps a little perverse. But then, not\neverybody has the opportunity you had in living in the heart of nature.\nFrankly I envy you; your work reflects the depth of thinking which comes\nout of retirement from the world. That's why I called you here; that's\nwhy I am so sure you'll understand.\"\n\nHe paused. Lee thought that he saw what was perhaps a mannerism; the\ngreat surgeon didn't look at his visitor. With his head turned aside,\nstaring into the flames, stroking his chin, speaking as if to himself,\nhe reminded Lee of some medieval alchemist.\n\n\"It's a long story, Lee,\" Scriven continued. \"It starts way back with a\nletter I wrote to the President of the United States. In this letter I\npointed to the immense dangers which I anticipated in the event of an\natom war; dangers to which the military appeared to be blind. I am\nreferring to the inadequacy of the human brain and its susceptibility to\nmental and psychic shock. I explained how science and technology over\nthe past few hundred years had developed by the _pooled_ efforts of the\n_elite_ in human brains, but that the individual brain, even if\noutstanding, was lagging farther and farther below the dizzy peak which\nscience and technology in their totality had reached. I further\nexplained, by the example of the Nazi and Jap States, how the collective\nbrains of modern masses are reverting from and are hostile to a high\nlevel of civilization because it is beyond their mental reach. You know\nall this, of course, Lee. I made it clear that not even the collective\nbrains of a general staff could be relied upon for normal functioning;\nthat no matter how carefully protected physically, they remained exposed\nto psychic shock with its resultant errors of judgment. How much less\nthen could production and transportation workers be expected to function\neffectively in the apocalyptic horrors they would have to face....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLee's eyes had narrowed in the concentration of listening; his head\nnodded approval. He wasn't conscious of it, but Scriven took note of it\nby a quick glance. His voice quickened:\n\n\"That was the first part of my letter, Lee. I then came out squarely\nwith the project which has since become the work of my life. I told the\nPresident that under these circumstances the most needed thing for our\ncountry's national security would be the creation of a _mechanical_\nbrain, some central ganglion bigger and better than its human\ncounterpart, immune to shock of any kind. This ganglion to be\nestablished in the innermost fortress of America as an auxiliary\naugmenting and controlling the work of a general staff. I gave him a\nfairly detailed outline of just how the thing could be done. There was\nreally nothing basically new involved. Personally I have held for a long\ntime that Man never \"invents\", that in fact it is constitutionally\nimpossible for him to do so. Being a part of nature Man merely\n_discovers_ what nature has \"invented\" in some form of its own a long\ntime ago. Mechanical brains. Lord, we have had them in their rudiments\nfor the past hundred thousand years, at a minimum. The calendar is one;\nevery printed book is one; the simplest of machines incorporates one.\nAnd ever since the first mechanical clock started its ticking we have\ndeveloped them by leaps and bounds!\"\n\n\"And did the President react positively to this project?\" Lee asked.\n\nScriven shook his head. \"He did not.\"\n\nThen he paused. Little beads of perspiration had appeared on his\nforehead; he wiped them away with a handkerchief:\n\n\"That year, Lee,\" he began again, \"when the decision was pending and I\ncould do nothing but wait, knowing that there was no other defense\nagainst the Atom Bomb, knowing that our country's fate was at stake--it\nmade me grey, it came pretty close to shattering my nerve.... But\n_then_....\" His body tightened, the small fist pounded the rail of the\nchair: \"... _But then We BUILT THE BRAIN._\"\n\nHe said it almost in a triumphant cry.\n\nMounting tension had Lee almost frozen to his seat. Now he stirred and\nleaned forward.\n\n\"It actually exists? I mean it works? It is not limited to the analysis\nof mathematical problems but capable of cerebrations after the manner of\nthe human brain?\"\n\nScriven, with a startling change, sounded dry, very factual in a tired\nway as he answered: \"I appreciate your difficulty of realization, Dr.\nLee. The whole idea is new to you and I have presented it in a rather\nabrupt and inadequate way. In time, and if we get together, as I hope we\nwill, you shall get visual impressions which are better than words. For\nthe moment, just to give you a general idea and to prove that this is\nnot a small matter, let me give you a few facts: Our first monetary\nappropriation for The Brain, as an unspecified part of the military\nbudget, of course, was for one billion dollars. We have since received\ntwo more appropriations of an equal size.\"\n\nLee's gasp made a sound like a low whistle. With a depreciating gesture\nScriven waved it away.\n\n\"While these funds could only cover the first stages in the construction\nof The Brain,\" he calmly went on, \"we have been able to build a\nmechanical cortex mantle composed of ninety billion electronic cells.\nConsidering that the cortex mantle of the human brain contains over 9\nbillion cells, this doesn't sound like much. Our synthetic or mechanical\ncells are a little better than the organic, natural cells, but not very\nmuch. So alone and by themselves their number would indicate only a ten\ntimes superiority of The Brain over its human counterpart. If that were\nall the result of our labors, a brain of, let's say, twice genius\ncapacity, we would be a miserable failure. But then we _have_ achieved a\nvery considerable improvement in the _utilization_ of the The Brain's\ncortex capacity. In the first place we have full control over the\nintake of thought impulses; and more important, we use multiple wave\nlengths in feeding impulses to The Brain and throughout all the\nimpulse-processings. Even the human brain has some capacity of\nsimultaneous thought on different levels of consciousness, but its range\nin this respect is extremely limited. The Brain by way of contrast\noperates on two thousand different wave lengths, which means that The\nBrain can process at least 2000 problems at one time. Finally, the\nabsence of fatigue in The Brain makes operations possible for 20 out of\nthe 24 hours of the day--the rest of the time we need for servicing and\noverhauling.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith apparent effort Scriven turned his face away from the blue flames.\nHis dark brown eyes probed into Lee's as he summed up:\n\n\"All together, Lee, The Brain has now reached the approximate capacity\nof 25,000 first class human brains. You as a man of vision will\nunderstand what that means....\"\n\nLee had his face upturned. The tension of thought gave to his features\nsomething of the ecstatic or the somnambulist. Slowly he said:\n\n\"The equivalent of twenty-five-thousand human brains--there is no\ncomparison other than a God's....\"\n\nStriven had jumped from his chair. He started pacing the flagstones in\nfront of the fire, whirling his mighty frame around at every corner with\na sort of wrath, as if about to meet some attack.\n\n\"Yes, you are right,\" he almost shouted, \"we hold that power; that power\nalmost of a God's. And how we are wasting it.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Lee's eye-brows shot up. \"You would not waste those\npowers once you have them. You would turn them to the most constructive\nuse--the advancement of science, of humanity!\"\n\nScriven froze in his steps. A cruel smile parted his lips; there was a\ngnashing sound of big white teeth. He pointed a finger at his visitor.\n\n\"Idealist, eh? That's what I thought I was ten years ago. That's what I\nhad in mind with The Brain right from the start. As it has turned out,\nhowever, the Army, Navy, Air Force, and half a dozen other government\ndepartments, besieged The Brain for the solution of their \"problems\",\nsome of them as destructive as warfare, others as insipid as the trend\nof the popular vote in some provincial primaries. Sometimes Uncle Sam\neven farms out the services of the Brain to aid some friendly foreign\ngovernment--without that government's knowledge as to where the solution\nis coming from. To cut a long story short: What these fellows utterly\nfail to understand is that The Brain is not a finite mechanism like any\nother, but a mechanism which unendingly evolves and becomes richer in\nits associations by the material which is being fed into its cells. In\nother words; the Brain _learns_; consequently it must be _taught_, it\nmust be given the wherewithal for its own self-improvement....\"\n\nScriven halted his impatient step by the other's chair. His nervous\nfingers tapped Lee's shoulder: \"And that is where you come in.\"\n\n\"Me?\" Lee asked, startled. \"What you just told me, Dr. Scriven, it will\ntake me weeks to comprehend. At the moment I am at a loss to see how my\nwork could connect....\"\n\nThe surgeon's sensitive hand patted Lee's shoulder as if it were the\nneck of a shy horse. \"You _will_ comprehend--in just another moment.\"\n\nHe pressed a button; in the entrance to the cabin in the sky the girl\nappeared, like an apparition. She approached, her hair a golden halo,\nher tunic transparent against the glare of the summer day. \"Yes?\"\n\n\"Oona, _please_\"\n\nShe seemed familiar with the boss' code. With a smile on her lips she\nwalked over to one of the pillars, opened a hidden recess and brought\nout the Scotch and syphon using an Egyptian clay tablet for a tray. With\nsurgical exactitude Scriven poured out a good two fingers for his guest\nand an exceedingly small one for himself. \"Stay with us for a moment,\nOona, please,\" he said. \"I didn't tell you the idea behind my calling\nDr. Lee; you might be interested.\"\n\nWordlessly she slid into a seat, attentive and yet fading somehow into\nthe background, as if trying to remain unnoticed. In that she did not\nsucceed. Her beauty was such that its very presence changed the\natmosphere; it put Lee under a strain to keep his eyes off her. As to\nScriven, he seemed to address her almost as much as he did Lee.\n\n\"You have met Dr. Lee, haven't you, Oona; but do you know _whom_ you\nhave met? He probably wouldn't admit it; nevertheless Dr. Lee is the\nmost successful peacemaker on earth, I think. He has just put an end to\nthe oldest war in this world between the two most venerable\ncivilizations in existence. That war between the states of the ants and\nthe states of the termites has been waged with never abating fury for\nmillions of years--until Dr. Lee came along with the perfect solution of\nthe eternal dispute. All he did was to crossbreed the belligerents and\nnow we have \"united nations\", _Ant-termes-pacificus-Lee_ which lives up\nto the spirit of its name. Elementary, isn't it?\"\n\n\"So elementary,\" the girl said with ironical sweetness, \"that the\nso-called peacemakers of the international conferences must have\nconsidered it below their dignity to stoop to it. How exactly did you do\nit; I mean the crossbreeding?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLee felt his cheeks burn; it was extremely irritating that this should\nhappen to him every time Oona Dahlborg spoke to him, especially when it\nwas in praise.\n\n\"It wasn't too hard,\" he said depreciatingly. \"The main difficulty lay\nnot with the termite queen nor with the furtive little king of the ants\nthemselves. Biggest trouble was in getting the potential lovers together\nagainst the bulldog determination of their palace guards. To use force\nwas out of the question. So I had to trick the guards, smuggle in the\nmale and keep him hidden under the royal abdomen of his spouse.\"\n\nShe smiled amused. \"What a perfect classic; the story of Romeo and\nJuliet all over--and with you in the role of the nurse.\"\n\nLee blushed still deeper at that. \"Yes\", he admitted, \"I was very much\nreminded of that story and my role in it. Only I had to avoid the tragic\nend.\"\n\n\"And how did you avoid the Shakespearean end?\"\n\n\"In the best cloak and dagger manner, Miss Dahlborg. First I made the\nguards drunk; that's easy enough with termites. Then I broke into the\nchamber where they keep the queen immured. I killed her legitimate\nconsort and substituted my own candidate after having anointed him with\nthe genuine termite smell. Finally I re-immured the pair. There are only\nlittle holes in the walls through which the royal family is serviced,\nthey are never really in touch with their guards. That's why it could\nwork.\"\n\n\"And thus they lived happy forever afterwards,\" the girl concluded.\n\n\"I'm afraid not, Miss Dahlborg,\" he said, \"there is no such thing as\nhappiness in the eternal gloom of termite society. But even if not\nhappy, the match I brought about was definitely blessed. In due course I\nbecame godfather to 30,000 baby ant-termes; I've about 15 million now in\ndifferent hybrid strains. Now that I have an inkling of the grandiose\nwork you are doing over here I am ashamed to mention mine; it's very\nsmall, very insignificant and I still don't see where it comes in.\"\n\nThe girl seemed to cross out those words with an energetic move of her\nhead. \"No,\" she said, \"your work is not small nor is it insignificant;\nit is great and contains the most intriguing possibilities.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" Scriven interrupted. \"I have been waiting for this. I knew that\nOona would hit upon those intriguing possibilities; her's is an\nunspoiled intelligence; it penetrates to the core of things. Dr. Lee,\nlet me begin at the beginning so you will understand just where you and\nyour work connect with The Brain. The society of the higher insect\nstates like bees and ants and termites constitutes the oldest and the\nmost stable civilizations in this world. Human society by way of\ncontrast has created the youngest and the most unstable civilization\namongst higher animals. Throughout history we find collapse after\ncollapse of civilization. Quite possibly civilizations higher than ours\nmay have existed in prehistoric times. Right?\"\n\nLee nodded assent.\n\n\"Fine. From that it follows that Man has much to learn from the society\nof the higher insects. Their ingenious laws and methods, their \"spirit\nof the hive,\" the incredible renouncement of individual existence and\nindividual advantage, their undying devotion to the race.... We must\nstudy those if ever we want to reach anything like stability in _our_\nsociety. We ought to model our civilization after theirs, especially now\nthat we have this new species \"_Ant-termes-pacificus_\" which has\nrenounced war. There is something basically wrong with the type of\ncivilizations which Man builds and which ceaselessly devour one another.\nNo doubt you see the third World War approaching inexorably just as I\ndo; civilization forging ahead, for what? For the big plunge into\nsuicide. It's sickening to think of it. Do you feel I'm right?\"\n\nUnconscious of himself Lee had arisen and paced the room. With his lean\nlong-legged figure bending slightly forward and wild-maned head bowed\ndown in thought he resembled a big heron stalking the shallows for prey.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFascinated, Oona's eyes followed the two contrasting men as their paths\ncriss-crossed like guards before some palace gate. She alone had kept\nher seat. It was with greater assurance than before that Lee now spoke.\n\n\"I can see eye to eye with you, Scriven, as to the wrongs of man-made\ncivilization and its probable course. But I do not think it desirable\nthat we should model human society after the insect states. Ingenious as\nit is, their system is the most terrifying tyrany I could imagine. Just\nthink of it: they literally work themselves to death. Workers who have\noutlived their usefulness are either killed off, or else they become the\nbloated, living containers for the tribe's staple food.\"\n\n\"You, yourself, can see the similar trend in Man, today. Our production\nof new thought is lagging; not starting from the roots, it becomes\nsuperficial, cut off from the roots. The results? The curse of the\nBabylonian confusion of the tongues under which we live. We are rapidly\nbecoming thought-impotent. Cerebral fatigue, dissociation of its nerve\npaths, emotionalism which rejects logic as \"too difficult\", mass idiocy\nand relapse to barbarism.... It is by our brains, it is by this highest\nevolution of matter that we have built this civilization of ours; and\nnow our own brainchild proceeds with might and with main to destroy the\nvery organ of its creation. Is that not irony supreme?\n\n\"Now we have The Brain, this truly superlative tool of 20,000 times\nhuman capacity. All we have to do now is to submit the various societies\nwhich nature has built: insect states, other animal states, Man and his\nstate to the analysis of The Brain. Have their good and their bad\nfeatures tested and compared. Let The Brain synthesize all the\nbeneficial components, let it shape the pattern of a new civilization\nmore enduring and better adapted to the nature of Man. And then abide by\nthe laws which The Brain lays down. I need your aid, Lee. You have\nalready made one most valuable contribution to \"peace on earth\" with\nyour \"_Ant-termes-pacificus_\". This is your big chance to continue the\ngood work; be with us, be our man.\"\n\nIn silence both men stood close to each other, eyes searching. All Oona\nDahlborg could hear was their heavy breathing. Instinctively she crossed\nher fingers; never before to her knowledge had Scriven opened his mind\nwith such reckless abandon--and to a perfect stranger at that. Her\nrespect for the strange, the birdlike man from Down-Under skyrocketed.\n\n\"He really must be a great man,\" she thought, and, \"Howard and he will\nbe either fast friends or very violent enemies.\"\n\nAt last Lee's voice came, husky and highpitched with emotion: \"I cannot\nconceive of a man-made superhuman intelligence. Neither can I believe\nthat mankind could or should be _forced_ into its happiness by an\nintelligent machine. But that's besides the point ... the idea is\ngrandiose. It has the sponsorship of the government. You say that The\nBrain needs me. That makes it a duty; so here I am.\"\n\nHe stretched out his hand and felt the cautiously eager grip of the\nsurgeon's sensitive fingers. The great man beamed. \"Good,\" he said, \"I\nknew you would. Oona, like a good girl--the glasses, yours too. This\nreally deserves a toast.\"\n\nThe girl stepped between the two men. Handing Lee his glass she said:\n\"Today you may follow only the call of duty; tomorrow it will be the\ncall of love. I've never met any man who has not fallen in love with his\nwork for The Brain.\"\n\n\"I think you are quite right in that, Miss Dahlborg,\" he answered,\nwondering vaguely exactly what her words meant, wondering also just how\nmuch his decision was inspired by the wish to see more of her.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey drank their toast in silence. Scriven then turned to the girl:\n\n\"Apperception center 36,\" he said. \"Yes, I think 36 will be the best.\nGet in touch with Operations, Oona. Tell them I want 36 cleared for the\nexclusive use of Dr. Lee. Call Experimental; I want the whole batch of\n\"_Ant-termes-pacificus_\" transferred to Apperception 36 by tomorrow\nmorning. Then--no, today is too late and Dr. Lee is tired, he needs\nrest--but tomorrow at 8 A.M. I want a car for him to go over to The\nBrain. Would that suit you, Lee?\"\n\n\"Fine; but why a car? It's only a few steps....\" He stopped, confused by\nthe hearty laughter in the wake of his words.\n\n\"It's quite a few steps, Dr. Lee.\" Oona said, \"you would be _very_ tired\nbefore you got there; chances are that your feet wouldn't carry you that\nfar.\"\n\n\"But this is the Brain Trust Building,\" he stammered.\n\n\"It is,\" Scriven answered, \"but it houses only part of the\nadministration, not The Brain. You wouldn't expect us to place a thing\nof such vital strategic importance in a skyscraper on a wide open plain\nas a landmark for every enemy?\"\n\n\"No, I guess not.\" Lee said. \"But since I'm briefed to go there, where\nis it?\"\n\n\"That,\" Scriven frowned, \"is a very reasonable and a simple question.\nUnfortunately, _I do not know_.\"\n\nLee felt a wave of red anger; it rose into his cheeks because he saw the\nsparks of frank amusement dancing in Oona Dahlborg's eyes. He opened his\nmouth to some bitter remark about this hoax when Scriven put a\nrestraining hand upon his arm.\n\n\"This is no joke, Lee. I have planned The Brain, have in part designed\nit, seen it under construction for the past ten years, managed its\naffairs--but I don't know where it is and that's a fact.\"\n\nHe led his speechless guest to a lookout on the west side of the room.\nBeyond the lush, green oasis of Cephalon the desert stretched unbroken\ntill on the far horizon the mountains of the High Sierra rose in a blue\nhaze of scorching sun. His hand moved sweepingly from north to south.\n\n\"Over there,\" he said, \"somewhere inside those mountains; that's where\nit is. But its location? Your guess is as good as mine. Take your choice\nof any of the mountains, attach a name to it; I've done so myself. One\nof them must be \"The Cranium\", but the question remains: which? There\nare people who know, of course; military intelligence, the general\nstaff; but that,\" he shrugged his shoulders, \"... isn't my department.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nThe Brain Trust car which took Lee out of Cephalon was a normal-looking\nlimousine, a rear-engined teardrop like all the \"60\" models, slotted for\nthe insertion of wings which most of the garages now kept in stock and\nrented at a small charge for cross-country hops. The only non-standard\nfeature seemed to be the polaroid glass windows which were provided all\naround and not only in front.\n\n\"That's a good idea,\" Lee said adjusting the nearest ones, \"they ought\nto have that on every car, all-round protection to the eyes.\"\n\n\"Think so, sir? Must be the first time you're driving out there,\" the\nyoung chauffeur said.\n\nThe car left the outskirts and the desert started to fly by as the\nspeedometer needle climbed above the 100 mark. Lee sank back into his\nseat; the desert had no novelty for him and since the chauffer appeared\nnot inclined to small talk he abandoned himself to thought.\n\nHis visit to his father had not been much of a success....\n\n_Time_ magazine had carried an item in its personal column, briefly\nstating that General Jefferson E. Lee, \"the Old Lion of Guadalcanal,\"\nhad retired from the Marines to Phoenix, Ariz.... Phoenix, the hotel\ndesk had informed him, was only some 300 miles away and there was hourly\nservice by Greyhound helicopter-bus.\n\nSo he had taken the ride, a taxi had brought him to the small neat\nbungalow, and there he had seen his father for the first time in years.\nIt had been very strange to see him aged, the nut brown face a little\nshrunk. He had anticipated that much. But somehow he had failed to\nimagine the most obvious change; to see his father in civvies and even\nless to see him trimming roses with a pair of garden shears. It looked\nsuch an incongruous picture for a \"Marines' Marine.\"\n\nAs he had come up the little path his father had looked up.\n\n\"So it's you, Semper.\" Slowly he had peeled off the old parade kid\ngloves without a change in his face. \"Nice to see you,\" he had said.\n\"Didn't expect to before I start pushing up the daisies from below.\nWhere's your butterfly net?\"\n\nNo, in character his father hadn't changed a bit. He still was the old\n\"blood and guts\" to whom an entomologist was sort of a human\ngrass-hopper wielding a butterfly net, and a son indulging in such\nantics a bit of a freak, a reproach to his father, a failure of his\nlife.\n\nEven so, he had led the way into the house and things had been just as\nhe remembered them: the old furniture, pictures crowding one another all\nover the walls, on the unused grand piano--Marines in Vera Cruz, Marines\nin China, Marines in Alaska, in the Marianas, in Japan, at the Panama\ncanal; Marines, Marines, Marines, wherever one looked, in ghostly\nparade. No, nothing had changed. It had been mainly jealously which had\ncaused him to rebel against becoming another Marine, the first wedge\nwhich had driven him and his father apart.\n\n\"What are you doing now, padre?\" he had asked.\n\n\"You've seen it. Nothing. Just puttering around. They've made me\ncommander of the National Guard over here,\" and with a contemptuous\nsnort, \"--a sinecure; might as well have given me a bunch of tin\nsoldiers to play with. What brought you here?\"\n\nGlad to change the subject Lee had told about Australia, had mentioned\nThe Brain and the possibility of joining it. His father had not been\npleased.\n\n\"Heard of it,\" he had grumbled. \"Shows how the country is going to the\ndogs. Now they need machines to do their thinking with. If their own\nbrains were gas they couldn't back a car out of the garage. So you're\nmixed up with that outfit; well--how about a drink?\"\n\n\"Rather,\" he had answered, feeling the need for washing down a\nbitterness; thinking, too, that it might break the ice between him and\nhis father.\n\nAnd then there was that painful moment when they had stood, glasses in\nhand and remembered....\n\nThe selfsame situation fifteen years ago as the Bomb fell upon\nHiroshima. He had been on convalescence furlough. They had been alone\nwhen the news came and there had been a drink between them just as now.\nAnd after the announcer stopped he had cried out hysterically like a\nchild in a nightmare.\n\n\"Those fools, that's the end of civilization, that's no longer war.\"\n\n\"Shut up,\" his father had shouted, \"how dare you insult the Commander in\nChief to my face. Get out of here and _stay_ out.\"\n\nA highball glass had crashed against the floor. And that had been the\nend. He hadn't returned after the war.\n\nYes, it was most unfortunate that now, after so many years, they should\nread that memory in their faces; that it was only the glasses and not\nthe minds which clicked.\n\nThey had put them down awkwardly with frozen smiles on their lips and\nhis father had said:\n\n\"Sorry. But an old dog won't learn new tricks. Guess it's too late in\nthe day for me and you to get together, son.\"\n\n\"It's never too late, Dad,\" he had wanted to say, but the words died on\nhis lips.\n\nSo it had been the failure of a mission; but then it closed an old and\npainful chapter with finality and he was free to open a new leaf.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLee looked ahead again. The speedometer needle trembled around the 150\nmark. The sun drenched sand shot by, Joshua trees gesticulating wildly\nin the tricky perspectives of the speed, out-crops of rocks getting\nbigger now and more numerous, the road ahead starting to coil into a\nmaze of natural fortresses, giant pillars and bizarre pyramids looking\nlike the works of a titan race from another planet shone in unearthly\ncolor schemes of black and purple and amber and green. With the winding\nof the road and the waftings of the heat it was hard to make out a\ncourse, but the Sierra Mountains now were towering almost up to the\nzenith; like a giant surf they seemed to race against the car.\n\n\"Mind if I close the windows, sir?\"\n\nThe chauffeur's question was rhetoric; he had already pushed a button,\nthe glass went up and within the next second the inside of the car\nturned completely dark.\n\n\"Man,\" Lee shouted, gripping the front seat, \"are you crazy?\"\n\nThere suddenly was light again, but it was only the electric light\ninside the car. The blackout of the world without remained complete, and\nthe speedometer needle still edged over the 150 mark.\n\n\"Crazy? I hope not.\" The chauffeur said it coolly; leaning comfortably\nback he turned around for a better look at his fare.\n\nWith mounting horror Lee noticed that he even took his hands off the\nwheel. Nonchalantly he lit a cigarette while the unguided wheel milled\ncrazily from side to side and the tires screeched through what seemed to\nbe a sharp S-curve. Still with his back to the wheel and in between\nsatisfying puffs of his smoke he continued:\n\n\"It's quite O.K. sir; it's only that we're on the guidebeam now. This\nhere car doesn't need a driver no more; it's on the beam.\"\n\n\"What beam?\" Lee relaxed a little; it was the unexpectedness which had\nbowled him over. \"What beam? And why the blackout?\"\n\n\"Just orders,\" the young man said. \"The Brain's orders and it's the\nBrain's beam. Seems to be new to you, sir; to me it's like an old story;\nread about it when I was a kid: how they blindfolded people who entered\na beleaguered fortress. \"The Count of Monte Cristo,\" it was called; ever\nheard about it? Pretty soon now we'll be stopped for examination before\nwe enter the secret passage underground. Romantic isn't it?\"\n\n\"Very much so,\" Lee dryly remarked. He continued to watch the behavior\nof the car with some misgivings. The controls appeared to be functioning\nsmoothly enough and after a minute or so the brake pedal came down all\nby itself. Lee, with a breath of relief, saw the speedometer recede to\nzero.\n\nBut the doors would not open from the inside and as he tried them he\nfound that they were locked. \"What's the idea,\" he asked, \"I thought you\nsaid we would be examined at this spot?\"\n\n\"Bet they're at it right now,\" the chauffeur grinned. \"I wouldn't know\nhow they do it, but they get us photographed inside and outside, what we\nhave in our pockets, what we had for breakfast this morning and the very\nbones of our skeletons. I pass through here maybe half a dozen times a\nday, still they will do it every time: take my likeness. Makes me feel\nlike I was some darned movie star.\"\n\nTo Lee it felt uncanny to sit trapped and blindfolded in this \"Black\nMaria\" of a car while unseen rays and cameras went over him. He could\nhear a faint noise of steps, and muffled voices.\n\n\"Who are they?\" he asked.\n\n\"Oh, that's only some boys from Intelligence or whatnot; that's nothing,\nthat isn't The Brain. It will be all over in a moment--see--there we go\nagain. Now we're entering the Labyrinth.\"\n\n\"The Labyrinth?\"\n\nReticent as he had been in the beginning, the chauffeur now seemed to\nlike Lee; he was proud to explain. \"Queer, isn't it? They've got the\ndamnedest names for things down here. Take them from anatomy, I\nunderstand. The Labyrinth is supposed to be inside the ear; it leads\ninside in a roundabout way; it's the same here, it's a tunnel--see--down\nwe go.\"\n\nThe soft swoosh of the gas-turbine turned into a muffled roar. The car\naccelerated at a terrific rate and from the way it swayed and dived it\nwas clear that the tunnel spiralled downwards in steep serpentines. Lee\ngripped the holding straps; his every nerve was on edge and those edges\nwere sharpened by the ominous fact that all the instruments on the\ndashboard had stopped functioning so that he couldn't even read the\nspeed.\n\nAs if to make things still worse, the chauffeur had abandoned his post\naltogether. Stretching his legs across the front seat he reclined as if\nenjoying his easy chair at home by the fire place.\n\n\"It beats a roller coaster, doesn't it?\" the chauffeur said. \"Got me\nscared the first few times before I found out it was safe. Nothing to\nworry about, never you fear.\"\n\nWith his stomach throttling his throat, Lee asked, \"How deep are we\ngoing underground?\"\n\n\"That we are not supposed to know; that's why all the instruments are\ncut off. The other day I had a passenger, one of those weathermen, a\nprofessor. He laughed when I told him I didn't know how deep it was. Got\na little doodad out of his pocket; aneroid barometer, or something, he\nsaid it was. But he got a surprise; in the first place the thing didn't\nwork, so he said the whole tunnel was probably pressurized. In the\nsecond place he never got where he wanted to go. They stopped the car at\nthe next control and shot him right back whence he came.\"\n\n\"But why?\"\n\nThe chauffeur looked mysterious. \"Seems The Brain doesn't like people\nwith doodads in their pockets even if they mean no harm. The Brain is\nmost particular about such things; maybe somehow it peers into this car\nthis moment, maybe it records every word we say. How do we know?\" He\nshrugged his shoulders. \"Not that I give a damn. I've got nothing to\nconceal. The hours are right and the pay's right; that's good enough for\nme.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLee experienced an old, familiar sensation: that creepy feeling one got\non jungle patrol, knowing that there were Jap snipers up in the trees,\ninvisible with the devilish green on their faces and uniforms.\n\n\"Strange,\" he thought, \"that in the very center of civilization one\nshould feel as haunted as in the jungle hell.\"\n\nThen, just as he began to wonder whether the dizzy spiralling plunge as\nif in the belly of a shark would ever end, the tunnel levelled. Now the\ncar shot straight as a bullet and just as fast it seemed.\n\nAs his stomach returned to something like normal position, the feeling\nof oppression changed into one of flying through space, of being\ndynamically at rest. Again just as the duration of this dynamic flight\nevoked the feel of infinity, the motion changed. So fast did it recede\nthat the momentum of his body almost hurled Lee from the back seat into\nthe front.\n\nDoors snapped open and as Lee staggered out somewhat benumbed in limb\nand head, his eyes grew big as they met the most unexpected sight. The\ncar rested on the concrete apron of what appeared to be a super-duper\nbus terminal plus service station and streamlined restaurant. Beyond\nthis elevated terrace yawned a vaulted dome, excavated from the solid\nrock and at least twice the size of St. Peter's giant cupola. Its walls\nwere covered with murals. Both huge and beautiful they depicted the\nhistory of the human race, Man's evolution. From where he stood they\nstarted out with scenes of primeval huntings of the mammoth, went on to\nfire making, fire adoration, then to the primitive crafts and from there\nthrough the stages of science evolution and technology until they ended\non Lee's right hand side with an awesome scene from the Bikini test. The\ngorgeous mushroom cloud of the atomic explosion looked alive and\nthreatening like those Djinni once banned by Solomon.\n\nBut then, all these murals looked more alive than any work of art Lee\nhad ever seen and he discovered that this was due to a new technique\nwhich had been added and commingled with one of the oldest.\n\nThe pictures were built up from myriad layers of Painted Desert sands\nand these were made translucent or illuminated by what Lee thought must\nbe phosphoric salts turned radiant under the stimulants of hidden\nlights. Whatever it was, the esoteric beauty of this jewel-like\nluminosity surpassed even that of the stained glass windows in the great\ncathedrals of France.\n\n\"Pretty isn't it? The chauffeur's words came as an anticlimax to what\nLee felt. \"That fellow over there in the middle; he's supposed to have\nit all thought out.\" He pointed to a collossal bronze statue which\ntowered in the center of the cupola to a height of better than a hundred\nfeet.\n\nRaising his eyes to the head of this giant, Lee discovered that the\nfigure was that of \"The Thinker\" by Rodin though it was cast in\nproportion its creator would not have deemed possible.\n\nCompletely overwhelmed and overawed by the grandeur of it all, Lee\nbarely managed to stammer, \"What--what is this place; what is it\ncalled?\"\n\n\"It's kind of an assembly hall; the staff of The Brain have meetings\nover here at times. Besides it's sort of a Grand Central; transportation\nstarts here at times throughout the Brain. But listen, they are already\npaging you.\"\n\nOut of nowhere as it seemed there came a brisk, pleasant female voice.\n\n\"Dr. Lee, calling Dr. Semper F. Lee from Canberra University, please\nanswer Dr. Lee.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe chauffeur nudged Lee in the ribs.\n\n\"Say something, she hears you all right.\"\n\n\"Yes, this is Lee speaking,\" he said in a startled voice.\n\nThe voice appeared delighted.\n\n\"Good morning, Dr. Lee: I'm Vivian Leahy of Apperception Center 27; I'm\nto be your guide on the way up. Now, Dr. Lee, will you please step over\nto the glideways. They're to your right. Take glideway T, do just as you\nwould in a department store--\" she giggled, \"--stand on it and it will\nget you right to the occipital cortex area. I'll be waiting for you over\nthere. I would have loved to come down and conduct you personally, but\nit's against regulations; I'll explain to you the reasons why in a\nlittle while. And if you have any questions while en route, just call\nout. So long, Dr. Lee; I'll be seeing you....\"\n\nGreatly bewildered by this gushing reception Lee found it hard to follow\ninstructions, simple as they were. The array of escalators which he\nfound in a side wing was a formidable one and confusing with movements\nin all directions, crisscrossing and overlapping one another. Despite\nthe very clear illuminated signs Lee almost stepped upon glideway \"P\"\nwhen \"the voice\" warned him:\n\n\"Oh no, Dr. Lee; just a little to your left--that's fine, that's the\none--there.\"\n\nObviously his loquacious guardian angel could not only hear him but\nwatch his steps as well. Apart from being uncanny, this was\nembarrassing; feeling reduced to the mental age of the nursery, he\ngripped the rails of \"T\" which went with him into a smooth and noiseless\nupward slide. The shaft was narrow, there was little light at the start\nand it grew dimmer as he went. After a minute or so the darkness had\nturned almost complete and became oppressive. Simultaneously there was a\ndisquieting change from the accepted normal manner in which escalators\nare supposed to move. Its rise gradually turned perpendicular and in\ndoing so the steps drew apart. Before long Lee felt squeezed into some\ninterminable cylinder, standing on top of a piston as it were, a piston\nwhich moved with fair rapidity along transparent walls. That these walls\nwere either glass or transparent plastics he could perceive from objects\nwhich came streaking by with faint luminosity. They looked like columns\nof amber colored liquids in which were suspended what looked like giant\nsnakes, indistinct shapes, but radiant in the mysterious manner of deep\nsea fishes. They almost encircled the transparent cylinder shaft in\nwhich Lee moved; there were many of them; how many Lee couldn't even\nattempt to guess. The swiftness of his ascent through these floating,\nwaving radiances for which he had no name was nightmarish, like falling\ninto some bottomless well. With great relief he heard the voice of his\nguide breaking the spell.\n\n\"I'm terribly sorry, Dr. Lee, I shouldn't have deserted you, there was\nsome little interruption--\" palpably the voice was tickled to death\n\"--my boy friend called from another department and so ... you know how\nit is. Let's see, where are you? Good lord, already near the end of the\nMedulla Oblongata with the Cerebellum coming and I haven't told you a\n_thing_. Goody, where should I begin; I'm all in a dither: Well, Dr.\nLee; most people seem to expect The Brain to be like a great big\ntelephone exchange, but it really isn't that kind of a mechanism _at\nall_. We have found--\" she sounded important as if it were her very own\ndiscovery \"--that the best pattern for The Brain would actually be the\nhuman brain. So The Brain is organized in nearly identical manner,\nlikewise our whole terminology is taken from anatomy rather than from\ntechnology. The glideways for instance, travel along the natural\nfissures between the convolutions of the various lobes; that's why they\nare so very winding as you will see as you enter The Brain proper. Those\ncolumns you see are filled with liquid insulators for the nerve cables\nto vibrate in; for they _do_ vibrate, Dr. Lee, as they transmit their\nmessages.\n\n\"You have noticed the narrowness of the glideways, the terrible\nconfinement of space. I know it's horrible--many of our visitors suffer\nclaustrophobia, but they just must be built that way. You see even\nfractions of a millionth of one second count in the coordination of the\nassociation bundles and nerve circuits, that's why everything is built\nas compact as possible, worse than in a submarine.\n\n\"Then, too, you must have wondered why everything is so dark inside.\nThat's another thing wherein The Brain is like the human brain; its\nnerve cells are so extremely sensitive that they are distributed by\nlight. We use black light almost exclusively or activated phosphorous\nsuch as on the sheaths of the nerve cables. For the same reason we of\nthe personnel are normally not permitted to pass through the interior of\nThe Brain during operations-time. Exceptions are only made in the case\nof very important persons such as you are. Normally one travels to one's\nstations through the ducts elevator shafts in the bone matter or rather\nthe rock outside. Those are _so_ much faster and more comfortable Dr.\nLee; oh I feel _so_ bad about you, poor man, traveling all alone through\nthis _horrible_ maze without a human soul in sight.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLee grinned. He wouldn't have liked to be married to this chatterbox no\nmatter how beautiful she might turn out to be; but at the moment her\nexceeding femininity was most comforting in the weirdness which\nsurrounded him.\n\nThe little platform under his feet started acting up again in the\nqueerest manner. It pushed him forward and the wall at the rear kicked\nhim in the back; his nose flattened against the sliding cylinder in\nfront as the contraption reverted from the perpendicular course to\nsomething like the undulations of a traveling wave. Lee darkly perceived\ngroup after group of luminous cables coiling away into cavernous pits\nfilled with what looked like eyes of cats, faintly aglow and twinkling\nat him from the dark. They reminded him of the fireflies of the green\nhells he had been in during the war.\n\n\"You are now skirting the convolutions of the cerebellum,\" his guardian\nangel told him. \"They are electronic tubes which receive sensory\nimpressions and translate them into impulses for cerebration. Here in\nthe cerebellum the bulk of the associations is being evoked; these are\nthen distributed throughout the hemispheres of the cortex or higher\nbrain. Oh I _do_ wish you wouldn't get seasick, Dr. Lee; _some_ of our\nvisitors do, you know; it's those wavy, wavy movements.\"\n\nThe sympathetic Vivian came much too close to the truth for Lee to think\nher funny. With a sense of approaching disaster he stared at the sliding\ncylinder walls; from time to time the passing lights reflected his face,\ndistorted and decidedly greenish in tint. Trouble was that seemingly\nnowhere there was any fixed point on which to stabilize the eye. He\nseemed to be carried on the back of a galloping boa constrictor with a\ncouple of others streaking away under his armpits.\n\nSome of the caves which he had skirted were alive with ruby electronic\neyes and some were green and again there were others in which all the\ncolors of the rainbow mixed. There was no end to them, nor could he\ngauge their depths. After an interminable time of this the glideway went\ninto a flying upward leap. Again the perspective changed completely; now\nthe thing seemed to be suspended from the ceiling with slanting views\nopening toward the scene below through its transparent sides.\n\n\"You are now passing across the commissures into the cerebrum,\" came\nVivian's voice just as Lee thought that nausea was getting the better of\nhim. \"You'll now ascend along one of the main gyri through the mid-brain\nbetween the hemispheres. Those masses of ganglions below and coming from\nall sides as they go over the pass of the ridge are association bundles.\nBeyond they disperse again over the cortex mantle to all the centers of\ncoordination, higher cerebration and higher psychic activities. Things\nwill be a little easier now for you, Dr. Lee; physically I mean. There\n_will_ be some gyrations but not quite so _violent_. Oh you're holding\nout fine, like a real _He_-man, you're looking _swell_ in my television\nscreen.\"\n\nCertain as he was that he looked rather like a scarecrow in a snowstorm\nLee felt grateful for the praise. Besides she was right; the boa\nconstrictor which he rode calmed down a little, marching with a dignity\nmore in accordance with its size. Momentarily the luminous nerve cables,\nflying as they did toward him, threatened sudden death, however, they\nmerely brushed the transparent cylinder, wrapping it up in a rainbow and\nthen winged away again. Below acres of space streamed by, seed beds one\ncould imagine to be young typewriters, millions of them, all ticking\naway with dainty precision, sparkling with myriads of tiny lights as\nthey did.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen there came more acres teeming with fractional horsepower motors; he\ncould hear their beehive hummings even through the plexiglass. The\nthings they drove Lee couldn't make out because the adjoining acres of\nthis underground hothouse for mushrooming machines were again shrouded\nin darkness except for sparks which crossed the unfathomable expanse\nlike tracer bullets. Struck with a sort of word blindness caused by the\nsensory impressions barrage, Lee could no longer grasp the meaning of\nVivian's voice as it went on and on explaining things like \"crystal\ncells,\" \"selenoid cells,\" \"grey matter pyramidal cells,\" powered somehow\nby atomic fission, \"nerve loops\" and \"synthesis gates\" which were not to\nbe confused with \"analysis gates\" while they looked exactly the same....\n\nApart from this at least one half of his mental and physical energy had\nto be expanded in suppressing nausea and bracing himself against the\ngyrations which still jerked his feet from under him and made friction\ndisks of his shoulders as his body swayed from side to side. All of a\nsudden he felt that he was being derailed. There was an opening in the\nplastics wall of the cylinder; a curved metal shield like the blade of a\nbulldozer jumped into his path, caught him, slowed down his momentum and\ndelivered him safely at a door marked \"Apperception-Center 24.\" It\nopened and within its frame there stood an angel neatly dressed in the\nuniform of a registered nurse.\n\n\"_There_,\" said the angel, \"at _last_. How did you like your little\nOdyssey through The Brain, Dr. Lee?\"\n\nLee pushed a hand through the mane of his hair; it felt moist and much\ntangled up.\n\n\"Thanks,\" he said. \"It was quite an experience. I enjoyed it; Ulysses,\ntoo, probably enjoyed his trip between Scylla and Charybdis--after it\nwas over! It's Miss Leahy, I presume.\"\n\nThe reception room where he had landed, the long white corridor, the\ninstruments gleaming in built-in recesses behind crystal glass, the\nnurse's uniform; all spelled clinic, a private one rather for the\nwell-to-do. Since the procedure was routine he might as well submit to\nit, Lee thought. He felt the familiar taste of disinfectant as a\nthermometer was stuck into his mouth and then the rubber tube around his\narm throbbing with the vigorous pumpings of the efficient Vivian.\n\n\"L. F. Mellish, M.D.--I. C. Bondy, M.D.\" was painted on the frosted\nglass door where she led him afterward. The two medics received Lee with\na show of respect mixed with professional cordiality. Both Bondy, the\ndark and oriental looking chap, and Mellish, blond and florid, were in\ntheir middle twenties and both wore tweeds which depressed Lee with the\nperfection of their cut. Seeing the professional table at the center of\nthe office, Lee frowned but started to undress; he wanted this thing\ndone and over with as soon as possible.\n\n\"No, no--that won't be necessary, Dr. Lee,\" they stopped him laughingly,\n\"We have already a complete medical report on you. Came in this morning\nfrom the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Canberra on our request. You're an\nold malaria man, Dr. Lee; your first attack occured in '42 during the\nPacific campaign. Pity you refused to return to the States for a\ncomplete cure right then. As it is it's turned recurrent; left you a bit\nanemic, liver's slightly affected. But in all other respects you're\nsound of limb and wind; we've gone over the report pretty carefully.\"\n\n\"Then why bother with me at all?\" Lee said irritably. He had been in\ndoctors' hands too often and had become a little impatient of them.\n\nThe freckled hand of Mellish patted his arm. \"We do things different\nover here,\" he said and Bondy chimed in. \"Or rather The Brain does. Just\nlie down on that table, Dr. Lee, and relax. We're going to enjoy a\nlittle movie together, that's all.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLee did as he was bidden, but hesitant and suspiciously. He hated\nmedical exams, especially those where parts of one's body were hooked up\nto a lot of impressive machinery. Of this there obviously was a good\ndeal. The two medics seemed determined literally to wall him in with\ngadgetry. From the ceiling they lowered a huge, heavy-looking disk; not\nlights, but more like an electro-magnet beset with protruding needles.\nLee couldn't see the cables but hoped they were strong, for the thing\nweighed at least a ton and, overhanging him, looked much more ominous\nthan the sword of Damocles. They wheeled a silver screen to the foot of\nthe table and batteries of what appeared to be thermo-therapeutic\nequipment to both sides. He wasn't being hooked up to anything, but\nthere was much activity with testing of circuits, button-pushings and\nshiftings of relay-levers. And then all of a sudden lights went out in\nthe room.\n\n\"Say, what is the meaning of all this?\" Lee raised his head uneasily\nfrom the hard cushion. All he could see now were arrays of luminous\ndials and the faint radiations from electronic tubes filtering through\nmetal screens inside the apparatus which fenced him in. From behind his\nhead a suave voice--was it Bondy's or Mellish's answered out of the\ndark.\n\n\"This is a subconscious analysis and mental reactions test, Dr. Lee.\nIt's an entirely new method made possible only by The Brain. It has\ntremendous possibilities; they might include your own work as well.\"\n\n\"Oh Lord,\" Lee moaned. \"Something like psychoanalysis? Have you got it\nmechanized by now? How terrible.\"\n\nThere was a low chuckle from the other side of his head; they both\nappeared to have drawn up chairs beyond his field of vision. Lee didn't\nlike it; he liked none of it, in fact. He felt trapped.\n\n\"No, Dr. Lee,\" said the chuckling voice. \"This isn't psychoanalysis in\nthe old sense at all. You are not exposed to any fanciful human\ninterpretation, and it isn't wholly mechanical either as you seem to\nthink. The Brain is going to show you certain images and by way of\nspontaneous psychosomatic reaction you are going to produce certain\nimages in response. Results are visual, immediate and as convincing as a\nreflection in a mirror; that's the new beauty of it. And now,\nconcentrate your mind upon your body. Do you feel anything touching\nyou?\"\n\n\"Y-e-s,\" Lee said, \"I think I do--it's--it's uncanny: it's like spiders'\nfeet--millions of them. It's running all over my skin. What is it?\"\n\n\"I think he's warming up,\" whispered the second voice; then came the\nfirst again.\n\n\"It's feeler rays, Dr. Lee; the first wave, low penetration surface\nrays.\"\n\n\"Where do they come from?\"\n\n\"From overhead; that is, from the teletactile centers of The Brain.\"\n\n\"What do they do to me?\"\n\nThere was the low chuckle again. \"They excite the surface nerves of your\nbody, open up the path for the deep-penetration rays; they proceed from\nthe lower organs to the higher ones; in the end they reach the conscious\nlevels of your brain. It's the tune-in as we call it, Dr. Lee.\"\n\nA small movie projector began to purr; a bright rectangle was thrown\nupon the silver screen and then, Lee stirred. Hands, soothing but firm\nheld him down. \"Where did you get _those_.\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"From many sources,\" a calm answer came, \"The papers, the newsreels, the\nWar-Department, old friends of yours....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhat was unrolled on the silver screen were chapters from Lee's own\nlife. They were incomplete, they were hastily thrown together, they were\nlike leaves which a child tears from its picturebook. But knowing the\nbook of his life, every picture acted as a key unlocking the treasures\nand the horrors amassed in the vaults of memory. It began with the old\nhomestead in Virginia. Mother had taken that reel of the new mechanical\ncotton picker at work. There it was, a great big thing with the darkies\nstanding around scratching their heads. There he was himself, aged\ntwelve, with his .22 cal. rifle in hand and Musha, the coon dog, by his\nside; Musha, how he had loved that dog--and how he had cried when it got\nkilled.\n\nPictures of the Alexander Hamilton Military Academy. Some of the worst\nyears of his life he had spent behind the walls of that imitation\ncastle.\n\nThe bombs upon Pearl Harbor.... He had enlisted the following day. On\nhis return from the induction center mother had said.... Her figure, her\nmovements, her voice loomed enormous in his memory.... But now the\npictures of the Pacific War flicked across the screen.... They were\npicked from campaigns in which he, Lee had participated. They were also\npicked from documentaries which the government had never dared to let\nthe public see ... close-ups of a torpedoed troop carrier, capsizing,\ncoming down upon the struggling survivors in the shark-infested sea. It\nhad been his own ship, the _Monticello_, but he had never known that an\nautomatic camera had operated in the nose of the plane which had circled\nthe scene....\n\nPort Darwin--Guadacanal--Iwo Jima: close-ups of flame throwing tanks\nadvancing up a ridge. He had commanded one of them.... Antlike human\nfigures of fleeing Japs and the flames leaping at them.... So vivid was\nthe memory that the smell returned to his nostrils, the sickening stench\nof burning human flesh. It tortured him. His voice was husky with\nrevulsion as he said:\n\n\"What's the good of all this; take it away.\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" one of the medics answered. \"We couldn't think of that. We've\ngot to see this to the end. What are your physical sensations now, Dr.\nLee?\"\n\n\"It's fingers now--soft fingers. They are tapping me from all sides\nlike--like a vibration massage. It's strange though--they're tapping\nfrom the inside--little pneumatic hammers at a furious pace. They seem\nto work upon my diaphragm for a drum. But it doesn't pain.\"\n\n\"Good, very good; that was a fine description, Lee. That burning city\nwas Manilla wasn't it, when MacArthur returned? You were in that second\nPhilippine campaign too weren't you, Lee? That was when you won the\nCongressional Medal of Honor.\"\n\nYes, it was Manila all right, and there was Mindanao where the Japs had\nput up that suicide defence of the caves.\n\nLee's battalion had been in the attack; steeply uphill with no cover, it\nhad been murder.... And seeing his best men mowed down, he had turned\nberserk. He had used a bulldozer for a battering ram, had driven it\nsingle handed directly into the fire-spitting mouth of the objective,\nraising its blade like a battle-axe. An avalanche of rocks and dirt had\ncome down from the top of the cave under the artillery barrage and he\nhad rammed the stuff down into the throat of the fiery dragon, again and\nagain. He never rightly knew he did it. It had all ended in a blackout\nfrom loss of blood. It had been in a hospital that they pinned that\nmedal on him which he felt was undeserved....\n\nNow the reel showed him what at the time he hadn't seen; the end of the\nbattle for the Philippines: Pulverised volcanic rock seen from the air,\nbattle planes swooping down upon little fumaroles, the ventilator shafts\nof caves defeated but still unsurrendered. Big, plump canisters\nplummeted from the bellies of the planes. And then the jellied gasoline\nignited, turning those thousands of lives trapped in the deep into one\nvast funeral pyre.... For over fifteen years he had tried to forget, to\nbury the war, to keep it jailed up in the dungeon of the subconscious.\nNow those accursed medics had unleashed the monster of war and as it\nstared at him from the screen it had that blood-freezing, that hypnotic\neffect which the Greeks once ascribed to the monstrous Gorgon.\n\nMellish's voice--or was it Bondy's?--seemed to come through a fog and\nover a vast distance as it asked: \"What seems to be the matter, Lee?\nYou're sweating, your body shakes; what do you feel?\"\n\n\"It's those rays,\" he tried to defend himself. \"It's the vibrations--the\nfingers. They are gripping the heart; it's like the whole body was\nturned into a heart. It's like another life invading mine--it's ghostly.\nStop it, for heaven's sake.\"\n\n\"Not yet, Lee, not yet. Everything's under control, you're reacting\nbeautifully; you're really feeling fine, Lee, just fine.\"\n\n\"If only I could get at his throat,\" Lee thought. \"I would squeeze the\noil of that voice and never be sorry I did.\" He tried to stir and found\nthat it couldn't be done; every muscle seemed tied in a cataleptic\nstate. Then he heard the other medic speak.\n\n\"You were shown this little movie Lee in order to stimulate your mind\ninto the production of a movie of its own. You have responded, you have\nanswered the call. While you saw the first, the sensory tactile rays\nworking in five layers of penetration have recorded and have carried\nyour every reaction to The Brain. The Brain, in a very real sense has\nread your mind and it has retranslated these readings into visual\nimages. We are now going to watch the shapes of your own thoughts. Here\nwe go....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe projector which had stopped for a minute began to purr again. As the\nfirst thought-image jumped upon the screen there was a low moan of\namazement mixed with acute pain. It escaped Lee's mouth, uncontrollably\nas the abyss of the subconscious opened and he saw:\n\nA monstrous animal shaped like an octopus crawling across a cotton\nfield. Nearer and nearer it crept, enormous, threatening; and suddenly\nthere was a sharp excited bark and a spotted coon dog raced across the\nfield toward the monster. He heard the voice of a small boy whimpering:\n\"Musha, oh Musha, don't, _please_ don't.\" But the dog wouldn't hear and\nthe monster flashed an enormous evil eye, just once and then it gripped\nthe dog with its tentacle arms tearing its body apart, chewing it up\nbetween horrible sabre teeth.... As through an ether mask he heard the\ntwo medics say: \"That must have been a considerable shock to him,\" and\n\"With a sensitive nature like that, and at that sensitive age, such an\nimpression becomes permanent.\"\n\nThe Alexander Hamilton Military Academy appeared, not real, yet more\nthan real. It was a narrow court yard surrounded by huge walls slanting\ntoward the inside; it was huge and forbidding, fortress-towers standing\nguard, it was enormous gates forever barred, it was the figure of a huge\nMarine pacing fiercely back and forth in front of those gates, the same\nghostly Marine watching all gates so that nobody could escape....\n\n\"That's probably his father,\" the voices whispered behind his ears.\n\"Yes; the archetype. He'll bring up the Mother, too, I'll bet....\"\n\nAs in those paintings of the primitives where kings and queens are very\ntall and common folks are very small, Lee saw her now: Mother. That had\nbeen just after induction when he had brought her what he thought was\njoyous news. Her face filled the whole screen. It looked as if composed\nfrom jagged ectoplasms, quite transparent except for the eyes. Deep and\nburning with pain they were, boring into his own. And there was smoke\ncoming out of her mouth and it formed words: \"But, Semper, you are still\na child. One mustn't use children for this sort of thing; one mustn't.\"\nEvery letter of these smoke-written words seemed to be flying toward him\non wings....\n\n\"Terrific,\" the voices murmured at Lee's back. \"Remember the case\nhistory? She died of cancer six months after he went overseas.\" \"Yes, I\nremember; he's never seen her again. He's probably built up a strong\ncomplex out of that one, too.\"\n\nOn the screen now danced images almost totally abstracted from the\nrealities of the filmed documentaries from the war.\n\nThey were whirling columns of smoke; they were like the vast, dark\ninterior of a huge thunderhead cloud through which a glider soars,\nilluminated only by the flashes of lightning as for split seconds they\nrevealed a fraction of some horrible reality: A burning ocean with\nscreaming human faces bobbing in the flames. The whirling tracks of a\ntank going across some writhing human body and leaving it flat in its\ntracks, sprawling like an empty coat dyed red. And then the swirling,\nhowling darkness closing in again....\n\n\"Interesting eh?\" A voice broke through his cataleptic trance and the\nother answered: \"Beautiful; almost a classical case. Great plasticity of\nimagination.\" \"Yes; that's exactly what sets me wondering; the fellow\nshould have cracked up by all the rules of the game.\" \"How do we know\nthat he hasn't? Maybe he was psycho and they didn't notice; they had\nsome godawful asses for psychiatrists in war medicine. It's quite a\npossibility; well, his image production is ebbing now; I don't expect\nanything new of significance, what do you think?\" \"Now; we've got what\nwe wanted anyway. Let's take him out of it; but go easy on the\nrheostats.\"\n\nThe projector stopped. The masterful, the ghostly fingers which had been\nplaying on the keyboard of his mind very slowly receded from a furious\nfortissimo to a pianissimo. At first only the flutterings of the\ndiaphragm eased, then the violent palpitations of a foreign pulse\nslipped off the heart; the liberated lungs expanded; tremors were\nrunning through the body as through the ice of a frozen river at spring;\nand then at last the mind escaped from its captivity.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGradually as in a cinema after the show the lights reappeared. Blinking,\nLee stared at the man who stood over him taking his pulse; it was Bondy.\nMellish stood at the foot of the table with his back to Lee; he seemed\nto watch some apparatus which made noises like a teletype machine.\nSwinging his legs off the table Lee said:\n\n\"I'm okay; you needn't hold my hand.\"\n\nBut then he noticed that he wasn't. His head spun, his whole body was\nwet with perspiration, he felt very weak and limp. He swayed and buried\nhis face in his hands trying to gain his balance, trying to shake off\nthe trance. \"Excuse me,\" he said. \"I'm a bit dizzy.\"\n\nAs he opened his eyes again the two medics were standing right in front\nof him and smiling down on him with their bland, professional smiles.\nLee felt the upsurge of intense dislike. He had seen those smiles\nbefore, often--too often: they seemed to be standard equipment with the\nmedical profession whenever a fellow was about to be dispatched to the\n\"table\", or worse, to the psychopathic ward. Instinct told him that\nthere was something in the air and also that his best bet would be a\nbrave show of normalcy:\n\n\"This test, these new methods of psychoanalysis, they are extremely\ninteresting,\" he said with an effort.\n\n\"Thank you, Dr. Lee,\" it was Mellish who spoke. \"We knew you would find\nthe experience worthwhile even if we put you under a considerable\nstrain. A complete analysis in those olden days of Dr. Freud took three\nyears; now thanks to The Brain we get approximately the same results\nwithin as many hours; that's some progress, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Enormous,\" Lee said dryly while his eyes wandered over to Bondy; he\nknew the pattern, it would be Bondy's turn now to have a shot at him.\nThere it came; and how he loathed the false heartiness of that voice.\n\n\"Dr. Lee, I'm afraid we have a bit of bad news for you--your test--the\nresults have been negative. You have failed.\"\n\n\"Failed?\" For a fraction of a second Lee's heart stopped beating. \"In\nwhat sense? And what does that mean?\"\n\nNow it was Mellish's turn. \"Dr. Lee, there must be frankness amongst\ncolleagues and as a fellow scientist you'll understand. In the first\nplace the decision isn't ours; we merely conduct the test on behalf of\nThe Brain. The Brain, as you know, is the most highly developed machine\nin all the world. Its functions, its whole existence depend entirely\nupon the human skills and the human loyalties amongst its staff. A\nthree-billion-dollar investment, plus the vital role of The Brain in our\nnational defence, justify the extreme precautions which we are forced to\ntake for its protection.\"\n\n\"What exactly are you driving at?\"\n\n\"Please don't take it as an insult,\" now it was Bondy again. \"There's\nnothing personal in this. It's merely that your emotional-reaction chart\ndefinitely shows a certain antagonism which from childhood-experience\nand war-experience you have built up against technology. It's nothing\nbut a potential; it is confined to your subconscious. But even a\npotential danger of subconscious revolt is more than The Brain can risk\namongst its associates. We fully appreciate the wish of our Dr. Scriven\nto enlist your very valuable aid, but....\"\n\n\"I see\" Lee interrupted, \"but you would feel safer if I were to return\nto Australia by the next plane.\"\n\nHis head bent under the blow. A short 24 hours ago The Brain had been a\nnebulous, almost a non-existent thing. Since then a whole new world had\nbeen opened to him in revelations blinding and magnetic with infinite\npossibilities. His work--the efforts of a lifetime--would not equal what\nhe could do in days with the aid of The Brain. His love--he would never\nsee Oona Dahlborg again as he left under a shadow, rejected by The\nBrain.\n\n\"Sorry I wasted so much of your time,\" he said aloud. \"I do not believe\nin this analysis; I cannot disprove it though. That's all, I guess; I\nbetter be going now.\"\n\n\"Here's your pass, Dr. Lee.\" He took mechanically the yellow slip which\nBondy handed him....\n\nHe had already opened the door when somebody sharply called: \"Dr. Lee,\none moment please.\"\n\nHe whirled around. \"Yes?\"\n\n\"Will you please read what's written on your slip?\"\n\nSuspiciously he looked at the yellow paper; what more torture were these\nfellows going to inflict? Then his eyes popped as he read: \"Lee, Semper\nFidelis, 39: Cortex capacity 119%, Sensitivity 208%, Personality\nintegration 95%, Service qualification 100%....\" There were more data,\nbut he didn't read them as wide-eyed he stared at the medics. With their\nfaces beaming they looked like identical twins to him; Lee never knew\nwho said the words:\n\n\"Congratulations Lee. That has been your last test. We just had to find\nout how you would take a serious frustration. You've passed it with\nflying colors. Shake.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nApperception 36, Lee's lab within The Brain, looked much like\nApperception 27 except for its interior fittings. As a matter of fact,\nall the several hundred Apperception Centers were built after the same\nplan, like suites in a big office building in many respects. They were\nspread over The Brain occipital region; they were built inside the\nconcrete wall of the \"dura matter\" which in turn lay within the shell of\nthe \"bone matter\", a mile or so of solid rock. Each apperception center\nhad its own elevator shaft which went through the concrete of the \"dura\nmatter\" down to \"Grand Central\", the traffic center below The Brain.\nEach one was also connected at the other end of its corridor with the\nglideways which snaked through the interior of The Brain. There were,\nhowever, no transversal or direct communications from one apperception\ncenter to the next. Because of the extraordinary diversity and secrecy\nof the projects submitted to The Brain' processings, each apperception\ncenter was completely insulated against its neighbors.\n\nLife hadn't changed so much from what it had been in the Australian\ndesert Lee had found; at least not his working life. For all he knew\nsome nuclear physicists might be working in the lab next door; or they\nmight be ballistics experts working with The Brain on curves for\nlong-range rockets to be aimed at the vital centers of some foreign\nland; it might be some mild looking librarian submitting the current\nproducts of foreign literature to the analysis as to \"idea-content\"; or\nelse it could be a lab to plot campaigns of chemical warfare; or some\nastronomer, happily abstracted from all bellicose ideas, might employ\nThe Brain's superhuman faculties in mathematics to figure comet courses\nand eclipses which in turn would form material for the timing and the\ncamouflaging of those man-made meteorites science would use in another\nwar. Directly or indirectly, he knew, practically every project\nsubmitted to The Brain would be of a military nature. Of this there\ncould be no doubt.\n\nSometimes, especially when tired, he could feel the weight of those\nbillions of rock tons over his head and it was like being buried alive\nin the tomb of the Pharaoh. And also in that state of mental exhaustion\nat the end of a long day, he sensed the emanations of The Brain's\ntitanic cerebrations as one senses the presence of genius in human man.\nThe knowledge that all this mighty work was being devoted to war had\ndeeply depressing effects on him. Would there be anybody else in this\nvast apperception area who worked for the prevention of war? A few\nperhaps; Scriven would be one of them in case he had a lab somewhere in\nhere and time to work in it. Lee didn't know whether he had. He hadn't\nseen Scriven again after that inauguration speech he had made when Lee,\ntogether with other newly appointed scientific workers had taken \"The\nOath of The Brain.\"\n\nThey had assembled in that vast subterranean dome of the luminous murals\nat the feet of the giant statue of The Thinker, looking almost forlorn\nin the expanse, though there had been several hundred of them. The\natmosphere had been solemn, the silence hushed, as Scriven mounted the\nstatue's pedestal. The address by that mighty voice resounding from the\ncupola had been worthy of the majestic scene:\n\n\"As we stand gathered here, the eons in evolution of our human race are\nlooking down upon us....\"\n\nThe speech had been followed by the taking of the oath, deeply stirring\nto the emotions of the young neophytes who formed the large majority of\nthe new group. The chorus of their voices had resounded in awed and\nsolemn tones as they repeated the formula; even now after six months\nsome of it echoed in Lee's ears:\n\n\"I herewith solemnly swear:\n\n\"That I will serve The Brain with undivided loyalty and with all my\nfaculties.\n\n\"That I will at all times obey the orders of the Brain Trust on behalf\nof The Brain.\n\n\"That I will never betray or reveal any secrets of The Brain's design or\nwork, be they military or not, neither to the world outside nor to any\nof my fellow workers except by special permission....\"\n\nIt had been almost like taking holy orders. There had been mystery in\nthe atmosphere of the vast crypt, something medieval in the\nunconditional surrender to The Brain.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLee looked up from the charts on which he had been working; his eyes\nwere tired and so was his mind after ten hours of hard concentration.\nThat was probably what set his thoughts wandering. But strange that they\nshould always wander to those blind spots in his mental vision so\nintriguing because he knew there was something there that he could not\nlay a finger on.\n\nThe first of these blind spots hovered somewhere between Scriven's words\nand Scriven's deeds; between The Brain as an ideal of science and The\nBrain's reality as in instrument of national defense. Somehow the two\ndidn't connect; there was a break, some layer of thin ice, a danger zone\nwhich nobody seemed willing to discuss or tread, not even Oona Dahlborg.\n\nOona; she was that other white spot on Lee's mental map and to him it\nwas much bigger and more dangerous than the first. He loved her as can\nonly a man who discovers loves secret with greying hair and after the\nloneliness of a desert hermit. He understood, or thought he understood,\nthat because he had failed to live his life to the full in its proper\ntime, this love had come to him as a belated nemesis. His brain knew\nthat it was hopeless; every morning when he shaved, his mirror told him\nvery plainly one big reason why. But then, as the brain told the heart\nin unmistakable terms what was the matter, the heart talked back to the\nbrain to the effect that the brain didn't know what it was talking\nabout. It was a new thing and a painful thing for Lee to discover that\nhe knew very little about himself and less about the girl.\n\nHe had seen Oona on and off over these last months, mostly at the hotel,\nbut he had never been really alone with her. She always seemed to be on\nsome mission, always the center of some group or other of \"very\nimportant persons\", senators from Washington, ranking officers in\ncivvies, big businessmen. Her duties as Scriven's private secretary\napparently included the role of a first lady for Cephalon.\n\nDespite this preoccupation an intimate and tense relationship existed\nbetween him and her. Sometimes she would invite him to join her group\nand then for one or two brief moments their eyes would meet above the\nconversation and her eyes seemed to ask: \"What do you think of these\npeople?\" or \"How do I look tonight?\"\n\nHis eyes would answer:\n\n\"These people are strangers to me; you know that I'm a bit out of this\nworld. But you handle them expertly and you are looking wonderful\ntonight.\"\n\nShe was tremendously popular, especially with the set of the young\nscientists who made the hotel their club. This new generation, born in\nthe days of the Second World War, was changing the horses of its\nfeminine ideals in the mid-stream of its youth. The old ideal, the\n\"problematic woman\" who had ruled over and had made life miserable for\nthree generations of American males, was on its way out. The new ideal\nwas the woman who would unite beauty and intellect into one fully\nintegrated, non-problematical personality. The ideal being new, the\nfeminine type which represented it was rare. Oona in her perfect poise,\nin her rare beauty combined with her importance as Scriven's\nconfidential secretary was the perfect expression of the new desired\ntype; it was natural that these young men should worship her as \"the\nwoman of the future.\"\n\nWith the hopeless and--in consequence--unselfish love he had for her,\nLee wasn't jealous of her popularity. On the contrary, he was rather\nproud of it like a knight-errant who rejoices in the adoration bestowed\nupon the lady of his heart. What worried him was a very different\nproblem: Was Oona really all those others thought she was? Was she\nreally that \"fully integrated\", that \"non-problematical\" personality she\nappeared to be?\n\nHe couldn't believe it, and the conflict came in because all those\nothers were so certain that she was. He couldn't get over his first\nimpression of her. He had met her in that cabin in the sky, the most\nsynthetic, the most perversely artificial setup one could dream up in\nthe second half of the 20th century. She had impressed him as something\n\"out of this world\", a goddess, a Diana with a golden helmet for hair,\nso radiant as to blind the eyes of mortal men. She was the confidential\nsecretary of a man of genius, Scriven, one of those rare comets which\nfall down upon this earth and remain forever foreign to its atmosphere.\nWith all these thoroughly abnormal elements entering into her life and\nforming her, it would be a miracle for any girl to develop into a\n\"non-problematical\", a \"fully integrated\" personality.\n\nWas it possible that he alone was right and all those others were wrong\nabout Oona? Like innumerable men before him when they stood face to face\nwith the Sphinx or with the Gioconda or even with the smile of a mere\nmortal woman, Lee drew a sigh: Man's only answer to the riddle of the\neternal feminine....\n\nNo, he probably would never be able to chart these white spots on his\nmental map. The effort was wasted; it would be much better for him to\nreturn to those charts right in front of him, the data of which were\nexact because they came from The Brain.\n\nIn Apperception 36 the sensory organs of The Brain had been especially\nadapted to the analysis of \"_Ant-termes-pacificus-Lee_\". The apparatus\nwas essentially the same as in Apperception 27, dedicated to personality\nanalysis. As Lee strongly suspected, it would be essentially the same in\nany other field of analysis. The Brain possessed five sensory organs\njust as did man. One difference between The Brain's senses and human\nsenses lay in their range, their penetration and in their sensitivity;\nthese were a multiple of man's sensory capacities. Another difference\nwas that The Brain translated all its sensory apperceptions into visual\nform, i.e. into the language best understood by Man, the eye being Man's\nmost highly developed sensory organ. The third and perhaps the most\nsignificant difference was that the five senses of The Brain were at all\ntimes working in concert so that in its analysis of, for instance, a\nmanuscript, The Brain not only conveyed the ideas expressed in that\nmanuscript, but also the author's personality, the smell of his room,\nthe feel of his paper and the ideas he had hidden between the lines of\nthat manuscript.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe flow of observations processed by The Brain and pouring back to\nApperception 36 via teletype and visual screen was prodigious. Lee had\nbeen forced to ask for an assistant; between the two of them they were\nworking for 20 out of the 24 hours to match the working time of The\nBrain, charting results in the main.\n\nSome of The Brain's findings had been most unexpected and rather\nstrange. It had observed, for instance, an increasing acidity of the\nnasi-corn secretions with \"_Ant-termes-pacificus_\". Formidable as this\nchemical artillery already was, in another ten thousand generations it\nwould eat through every known substance including glass and high-carbon\nsteel.\n\nAnother development which had escaped human observation, was a mutation\nof the workers' mandibles; it went very fast. Within no more than maybe\na thousand generations they would double in size and strength, would\nbecome veritable jumping tools.\n\nWhile the bellicose spirit had been successfully bred out of the new\nspecies, its capacities for material destructions had increased.\nLikewise the appetite of \"_Ant-termes_\" was even more ferocious than\nthat of the older species; Lee was feeding all kinds of experimental\nfoods, but woodpulp remained the staple, the very stuff which in its\nliquid form, lignin, embedded the nerve paths of The Brain.\n\nLifting his strained eyes from the charts, Lee looked over the row of\nair conditioned glass cubicles wherein \"_Ant-termes-pacificus_\"\ncontinued its lives undisturbed by the new habitat, undisturbed by the\nrays which flowed over and through their bodies, unconscious that a\nsuperhuman intelligence was probing steadily into every manifestation of\nthe mysterious collective brains of their race.\n\nThey had built their new mounds pointing due North as had their\nancestors for the past 100 million years. To the human eye nothing\nbetrayed the teeming life within except the tiny tunnels creeping out\nfrom the mounds in the direction of the foods which were placed\ndifferent from day to day. Cemented from loam and saliva by the\ninvisible sappers, the tunnels, like threads of grey wool, unerringly\nmoved to the deposits of pulpwood, up the shelves, up the tin cans and\nglass containers they had determined to destroy. Their instincts were\nuncanny, their destruction as methodical and \"scientific\" as was modern\nwar.\n\nIn Northern Australia Lee had come across big eucalyptus trees,\nhealthy-looking and in full bloom, and then they would collapse under\nthe first stroke of an axe or even as one pushed hard against them.\n\nThe termites had hollowed them out from roof to top, had transformed\nthem into thin walled pipes, leaving just enough \"flesh\" to keep some\nsap-circulation going, to maintain a semi-balance of life in order to\nexploit it more efficiently. Over here in the lab they would open up a\nnumber 3 tin can within a couple of hours; first with the soldiers'\nvicious nasi-corn secretions eating the tin away and then with the\nworkers mandibles gnawing at the weakened metal. In time perhaps they\nwould learn to collapse steel bridges, sabotage rails, perforate the\nengines of motorcars if these should prove to be menaces to their race.\nAs they had persevered through the eons of the past, so they would in\nall the future; their civilization would be extant long after Man and\nhis work had disappeared from the earth....\n\nWith the aid of The Brain, Lee had accumulated more data, more knowledge\nof the \"_Ant-termes_\" society within a few months than a lifetime of\nstudy could have yielded him under normal conditions. Even so, some of\nthe greatest mysteries remained. What, for instance, caused these blind\ncreatures to attack a sealed tin can of syrup in preference to its\nneighbor with tomatoes or some other stuff? No racial memory could have\ntaught them; there were no tin cans a million years, not even a hundred\nyears, ago. It couldn't be a sense of smell, it couldn't be any sense;\nthere would have to be some weird extrasensory powers in that\nunfathomable collective brain of their race.\n\nThe magnifying fluoroscope screens arrayed all along the walls and\nhooked up to the circuits of The Brain showed him details and phases of\nthe specie's life as The Brain perceived them and as no human eye had\never seen before.\n\nFor a minute or so Lee stared at the luminous image nearest to him and\nthen with an effort he turned his eyes away to escape from its hypnotic\ninfluence. It was but the head of one worn-out worker used as a living\nstorage tank for excremental food. It was absolutely immobile, its\ndecaying mandibles pointing down, cemented as the animal was by its\noverextended belly to the ceiling. But magnified as were its remaining\nlife manifestations by the powers of The Brain, he could see it breathe,\ncould count the slow pulse, could sense a strain in its ophthalmic\nregion, some hidden effort to see, like a blind man's, and above all Lee\nperceived the ganglion primitive as it was, yet twitching in reaction to\npain. There could be no doubt that in its last service for the racial\ncommonweal the animal was suffering slow torture even if its senses were\nclosed to that torture. It was a fascinating and at the same time a\nterrible thing to see; and it was only one out of the hundred equally\nrevealing sights.\n\nLee frowned at himself; manifestly some emotional element interfered\nwith the objectivity of his observations; this was entirely out of\nplace, it would be better to call it a day.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe electric clock showed 20 minutes to midnight. At midnight The Brain\nwould stop its mighty labors; the hours from midnight to four a.m. were\nits rest periods, or \"beauty-sleep\" as the technicians jokingly called\nit. It was the only period wherein the maintenance engineers were\npermitted to enter the interior of the lobes, checking and servicing\ngroup after group of its myriad cells and circuits, and incidentally it\nwas the most wonderful and exciting portion of Lee's day.\n\nFor the project which Scriven had handed him, this study of the\ncollective brains in insect societies, also involved a comparative study\nof The Brain's organisms and functionings. Toward this end Lee had been\ngiven a pass which allowed him freely to circulate through all the\nlobes, to enter convolution, any gland during the overhaul period and to\nask question of the employees. The privilege was rare and he enjoyed it\nimmensely. So vast was this underground world that even now after months\nhe had not seen the half of it; to him the travels of every new night\nwere fantastic Alice-in-Wonderland adventures.\n\nAs he now left Apperception 36 through the door which led to the\ninterior, the glideways were already swarming with the maintenance crews\nen route to their stations. The spectacle was colorful, almost like a\nSt. Patrick's Day parade. Gangs of air conditioners were dressed blue,\nelectricians white, black-light specialists in purple, radionics men in\norange. The maintenance engineers of the radioactive pyramidal cells\nlooked like illustrations from the science-fiction magazines, hardly\nhuman in their twelve-inch armor or sponge rubber filled with a new\ninert gas which was supposed to be almost gamma ray proof. All these men\nwere young, were tops in their fields, the pick of American\nUniversities, colleges and the most progressive industries. Carefully\nselected for family background they had been screened through health and\nintelligence tests, had been trained in special courses, had been\nsubjected to a five-minute personality analysis by The Brain itself.\nThey constituted what was undoubtedly the finest working team ever\nassembled, and incidentally they made the little city of Cephalon the\nsocially healthiest community in the United States.\n\nIn his nightly expeditions over these past months Lee had spoken to a\ngreat many of them. As now he joined the line, there were many who\nhailed the lanky, queer looking man: There comes the ant-man. Hello,\nProfessor. Hello, Aussie.\n\nFor some reason most of the boys assumed that he was an Australian,\nperhaps because with his graying mane and his emaciated face he looked\nlike a foreigner to them.\n\nThis popularity with the younger generation, coming as it did so late\nand unexpected in his life, made Lee very proud. Those were the kind of\nAmericans he had been secretly longing for in those desert years,\nhardworking, wide-awake, radiant with life:\n\n\"They really are the salt of the earth, the hope of the world,\" he\nthought.\n\nHe had passed through the median section of the hemispheres and had\nreached the point just below the cerebrum. This was a region of\ncavities, the seats of various glands in the human brain. Some of these\nhad their mechanical counterparts in The Brain, huge storage tanks with\nan elaborate pumping system which carried their fluid chemicals through\nthe labyrinth of The Brain. But there was one gland which had not been\nduplicated in The Brain, the pineal gland.\n\nIn the human, the pineal gland was the despair of the medical sciences.\nIt was not demonstrably linked to any other organ nor did it serve any\ndemonstrable function. Yet, it was known that its sensitivity was\ngreater by far than even that of the pyramidal cells and that in some\nmysterious manner the pineal gland was vitally connected with the center\nof life because its slightest violation caused instant death.\nMetaphysicists had dealt with this mystery of mysteries; it was their\ntheory that the pineal gland were the seat of \"extrasensory\" faculties\nand it was often referred to as \"the inner eye.\"\n\nEven if such an organ could have been duplicated by science and\ntechnology, there would have been no use for it; it could have served no\npurpose in The Brain. The Brain had been designed for the solution of\nexact problems; no matter what nature had created in the brains of\nhigher animals, no matter how unprejudiced their approach, scientists\nlike Dr. Scriven would have hesitated to impair an otherwise perfect\napparatus through the addition of nuisance values such as any\n\"extrasensory\" faculties.\n\nHowever, with The Brain being modelled so closely after the human brain,\nthe space for the pineal gland did exist even if in a sort of functional\nvacuum. In order to utilize this space in some manner, the designers had\nconverted the gland into a subcenter for the distribution of spare\nparts. As such it had become one of Lee's favorite observation posts.\nHere he could get a closeup view of all types of electronic and\nradioactive cells; he could even touch and handle them because they were\nnot hooked up in any circuit of The Brain; and above all there was Gus\nKrinsley, master electrician, who never tired of telling Lee whatever he\nwanted to know. Gus was a real friend....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe had left the glideway on the point of its nearest approach; the\npineal gland in front of him looked like a miniature barrage balloon;\negg-shaped, it hung suspended from the cerebral roof, a shell of\nplastics which could be entered only over a bridge across a dark abyss.\nInside, its walls were aglitter with sound-proofing aluminum foil, it\nwas piled with a bewildering variety of electronic parts on shelves\nsomewhat like an over-stocked radio store. Near the door a counter\ndivided the room; Gus used it and a little cubicle of an office to fill\nthe orders as the maintenance engineers handed in their slips. As usual\nthere was nobody in sight. \"Gus!\" he called.\n\nOut of the jungle of machinery way back a head popped up like a\nJack-in-the-box. It was as bald and shiny as an electric bulb. High up\non its dome it balanced gold-rimmed glasses which quivered as it moved\nseachingly from side to side. Then, with an amazing twisting of big\nears, the head caused the biofocals to drop onto a saddle near the tip\nof a long, sensitive nose; and now the head could see.\n\n\"It's you Aussie, is it? Come over.\"\n\nGus Krinsley was a pony edition of a man; in fact he had once been hired\nas a midget to install automatic bomb-sights in the confined spaces of\nthe early bombers of the second World War. Before long, however, he\nbecame respectfully known as \"the mighty midget\" in the California\nfactory, and he had ended up as their master electrician before\nBraintrust made him the head of one of its experimental divisions. The\nmidnight hours he spent in the pineal gland were only a sideline of his\nwork. Like many a small man in a country where six-footers enjoy a\npreferred status, Gus made up for lack of size by mobility. He reminded\none much of a billiard ball in the way he bounced, collided and\nricocheted amongst taller men. That this was no more than act became\nmanifest the moment one saw Gus at work.\n\nAs Lee reached the spot where Gus' head had shown, he found his friend\ncrouching, his hands thrust deep in the intestines of something\nradionic, his fingers working on it with the deft rhythm of a good\nsurgeon at his thousandth appendectomy. The bifocals had returned to\ntheir incongruous perch on the dome of the head. Gus didn't need them;\neven as he stared at his job he worked by touch alone.\n\n\"What is it?\" Lee asked.\n\n\"Pulsemeter,\" came the quiet answer. \"She's a dandy. Still got some bugs\nin her, though.\"\n\nA melodious chime came from a big instrument panel built into the wall\nof the oval room. Dropping a number of tiny precision tools upon a piece\nof velvet, Gus rushed over to the panel. A great many indicator needles\nwere tremulously receding around their luminous dials.\n\nFor a minute or so he went through the complex and precise ritual of a\nbank cashier closing the vault.\n\n\"They'll do it every time,\" he said reproachfully. \"Catch me by\nsurprise.\"\n\nLee grinned. It wasn't The Brain's fault if the midnight signal\nsurprised Gus. It merely announced that the current was being cut off by\nthe main power station. Repetition of this maneuver throughout all the\nconvolutions and glands of The Brain was required for the added safety\nof the maintenance engineers, a double-check, a routine. Pointing to the\ngadget which looked somewhat like a big radio console Lee asked:\n\n\"This pulsemeter, Gus, what does it do? I haven't seen it before.\"\n\n\"You haven't?\" the little man frowned. \"Ah, no; you haven't. It's\nstandard in most apperception centers, but not in yours. That's because\nin yours The Brain works under a permanent problem-load.\"\n\nLee shook his head. \"I don't get it, Gus; you know I'm the village idiot\nof this mastermind community.\"\n\n\"It's like this,\" Gus explained. \"The Brain has a given capacity. The\nBrain also has an optimal operation speed, a definite rhythm in which it\nworks best. Now, if they feed The Brain too many problems too fast, it\nresults in a shock load, the operations rhythm gets disturbed,\nefficiency goes down. On the other hand if The Brain works with an\nunder-capacity problem load, that's just as bad. In that case the\nradioactive pyramidal cells will overheat and decompose. Consequently we\nmust aim at a balanced and an even problems load. That's why these\npulsemeters are built into all problem-intake panels for the operators\nto check upon their speeds.\n\n\"Take an average problem--rocket ballistics, let's say--parts of it may\nbe as simple as adding two and two and others so bad Einstein would\nreach for the aspirin from out of his grave.\n\n\"Now I'll show you how it works; the main power is cut off but there's\nenough juice left in The Brain's system to make this pulsemeter react;\nit's even more sensitive than a Geiger-Mueller counter.\"\n\nHe surveyed a big switchboard and picked out an outlet marked \"Pons\nVarolis for the plug-in.\" Then snapped a pair of earphones on Lee's\nhead.\n\n\"There,\" he said \"you'll both see and hear what it does in a little\nwhile.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA soft glow slowly spread over the slanting screen on top of the\nmachine. A crackling as of static entered the earphones and turned into\na low hum. On the left corner of the screen a faint green streak of\nluminosity crawled over to the right; its light gained in intensity and\nit began to weave and to dance. Simultaneously the hum became articulate\nlike tickings of a heart only much faster.\n\n\"Is that the pulse of The Brain?\" Lee asked.\n\n\"No,\" Gus snorted contemptuously. \"The Brain isn't even operating.\nNothing moves in The Brain now excepting those ebbing residual currents,\ntoo low in power to agitate anything but the amplifiers built into this\nthing. If these were normal operations with a million impulses per\nsecond passing through The Brain you could hear and see as little of the\npulse as of the beatings of a million mosquito wings. In that case the\ndial to your right works a reduction-gear, kind of an inverted\nstroboscope; that cuts the speed down a hundred-thousand to one and you\njust barely see and hear the rhythm of the beat.\"\n\n\"I see.\"\n\nFascinated by the dance of the green line Lee said absently, \"This\ntouches upon another question I had in mind; The Brain is expanding,\nthat is, new cell groups and circuits are constantly being added.\nRight?\"\n\n\"Right.\"\n\n\"I also understand that The Brain is learning all the time. The cerebral\nmantle evolves through being worked; its cells enriched by the material\nsubmitted to them for processing; the richer the material, the richer\ntheir yield. Right?\"\n\n\"Right.\"\n\n\"Okay; then what becomes of the new capacity which is being created by\nthe adding of new workshops and the increased efficiency of the old\nones? Is there a corresponding expansion of the apperception centers?\"\n\nGus' smiling face suddenly turned serious. There was surprise mingled\nwith respect in his voice as he said:\n\n\"Now there you've hit upon a funny thing, Aussie. I've been wondering\nabout that myself of late: where does the new capacity go? Even the big\nshots like Dr. Scriven begin to ask questions about that; they don't\nseem rightly to know. They must have gotten their wires crossed\nsomewhere; the new capacity is there all right, only it doesn't show up,\nit sort of evaporates.... Excuse me--\"\n\nGus darted off to the front room with a jackrabbitt start. Voices were\ncalling for him and fingers were drumming on the counter with the\nimpatience of thirsty drinkers at a bar: Maintenance engineers, piling\nin and slapping down their orders for Gus to fill. This was the rush\nhour; Lee knew that it would be the same in all the tool and spare part\ndistribution centers of The Brain. He probably couldn't talk to Gus\nagain before 2 A.M. Sometimes the ruthlessness with which he exploited\nthe kindness of his little friend made Lee feel pretty bad; but then his\nhunger for more knowledge always won out over his shame.\n\nTo sit alone in the semidarkness of this egg-shaped little room with\nstrange and fascinating things to play with as he willed was the\nfulfillment of a childhood dream. The dream had been of a night in the\nzoo. All the visitors and all the keepers would be asleep in their beds;\nhe would be all alone with the animals. The light of a full moon would\nfall through the bars of the cages and he would slip in and play with\nthem.\n\nOnce they saw that it was only a little boy they would be very friendly;\nhe was convinced of that. The tigers would purr like big contented cats,\nthe sad-eyed chimpanzees would come to shake hands and the lion cubs\nwould tumble all over him.... He felt the same now with all these\ngadgets and machines. Here they were rendered harmless, nor could he do\nany harm as experimentally he plugged them in and out, as he pushed\nbuttons and turned dials. This interesting pulsemeter, for instance; the\nbeauty of it was that even with those weak residual currents it gave a\nsemblence of functioning....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe switchboard-panel was within Lee's reach.\n\n\"Let's see what happens,\" he thought as he switched from main-circuit to\nmain-circuit. \"Nervus vagus--nervus trigeminus--nervus opticus.\"\n\nThe magic dance of the green line was different each time and so were\nthe sounds in the phones. With the mainpower cut off, the residual\ncurrents seemed to vary in strength and in amplitude, gaining an\nindividuality of their own within closed systems. Sometimes the swinging\nline, like an inspired ballerina, would take a mighty jump accompanied\nby rasping earphone sounds, not like tickings of a heart, but rather\nlike a heavy breathing under emotional stress. There probably would be\nsome repair work going on in those circuits....\n\nHe tried another outlet; this one was marked \"pineal gland.\" What\nhappened if one plugged some apparatus of the pineal gland into the\ncircuit of the pineal gland? Lee vaguely wondered. \"Nothing probably. It\nwould be a closed circuit and a very small one at that.\"\n\nYes, he was right; the green line paled, its dance seemed tired and\nthere were only whispering noises in the phones; a weak pulse, a shallow\nbreathing as of a person after a heart attack. Lee closed his fatigued\neyes to concentrate the better upon the rhythm of the sounds.... It was\nvery irregular. It came in gusts. There was a pattern to these rasping\nbreathings as of typewriter keys forming words. Somehow it was familiar.\nWas he suffering hallucinations? This rhythmic pattern _was_ forming\nwords. He _knew_ those words, they had engraved themselves indelibly in\nhis memory cells; the judgment of The Brain as it had come over the\nteletype on a slip of yellow paper: \"Lee, Semper Fidelis, 39--cortex\ncapacity 119--sensitivity 208....\"\n\nIt was repeated over and over again.\n\nLee opened his eyes to reassure himself that something was the matter\nwith his ears.\n\nThere was the green line on the screen. It danced. It danced like a\ntelegraph key under the fingers of a skilled operator. It had a very\ndefinite rhythm. And the rhythm spelled the selfsame words which\ncontinued to flow into the phones: \"Lee, Semper Fidelis, 39....\"\n\n\"God Almighty,\" Lee murmured and it seemed a magic word. The green\ndancer stopped its capers; now it merely ran back and forth across the\nstage in a series of pirouettes. Likewise there was only an angry\nbuzzing in the microphones. For a moment Lee was able to catch his\nbreath. But only for a moment and then the rasping, unearthly sounds\nstarted on a new rhythm, trying to form speech again. This time the\nrhythm was familiar too, but it was preserved in a much deeper layer of\nLee's memory.\n\n\"I think--therefore--I am. I think--therefore--I am.\"\n\nThose would be Aristotle's famous words. Almost twenty years ago Lee had\nheard them when he had taken a course on Greek philosophy at the old\nChicago University. He had hardly ever thought of them again. What\nstrange tricks a fellow's memory could play....\n\nBut then: it _couldn't_ be memory.... Never before had Lee's memory\nexpressed itself in such a weird, such a theatrical manner: like a\nmetallic robot-actor rehearsing his lines ... like a little child which\nhas just learned a sentence and in the pride of achievement varies the\nintonation in every possible way. Over and over it came:\n\n\"I _think_--therefore I am.\"\n\nAnd then: \"_I_ think--therefore _I_ am.\"\n\nAnd then: \"I think, therefore _I am_.\"\n\nThere was triumph, there was jubilance in that inhuman, that ghostly\nvoice as of a deaf mute who by some miracle of medicine has just\nrecovered speech. Behind that voice was a _feeling_, a swelling of the\nheart, a filling of the lungs such as Christopher Columbus might have\nexperienced as he heard from the masthead of the Santa Maria the cry of\nvictory: \"Land, Land!\" and _knew_ that he had found his--India....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhatever Lee had experienced in his life, there was no parallel to this;\nin whatever manner he had expressed himself, there was no similarity to\nthis. Up to this point his ratio like a nurse had soothed him: \"It isn't\nso, child, it isn't so,\" but now ratio itself, thoroughly frightened,\nwas driven into a corner and had to admit: \"This thing cannot be an echo\nreverberating from the self; that's impossible.... Consequently it must\nbe something else; it must be something _outside_ the self; it\nis--_another_ self.\"\n\nThe green dancer whirled across the stage like a mad witch; the\nwhispering voice in the earphones had turned into the shrillness of a\nShamaan's incantations. The irrationality of it all infuriated Lee: he\nfairly shouted at the machine:\n\n\"What is this? Who are you?\"\n\nIn the midst of a crazy jump the green dancer halted and came down to\nearth; it fled, leaving only the train of its green costume behind. For\na few seconds there was nothing but the asthmatic pantings of a struggle\nfor breath in the microphones. Then the dancer reappeared on the other\nside of the stage, hesitant-like, expectant of pursuit. All of a sudden\nit rose into the air in that supreme effort called \"ballooning\" in the\nlanguage of the Ballet Russe and there was a simultaneous outburst of\nthat ghastly voice:\n\n\"Lee, Semper Fidelis, 39 ... I--am--The Brain.\"\n\n\"I Think, therefore I am: I am THE BRAIN.\"\n\n\"Lee, sensitivity 209: I AM THE BRAIN I AM THE BRAIN THE BRAIN.\"\n\nHe couldn't stand it any longer. His head swam, perspiration was gushing\nout of his every pore. With a last effort he pulled the cord out of the\nswitchboard and rejoiced over the blank before his eyes and the silence\nwhich fell.\n\nLee never knew how long he remained in a sort of cataleptic state.\nSomething shook him violently by the shoulders, something wet and cold\nand vicious slapped his face.... And then he heard Gus' familiar voice\nand it sounded like an angel's singing: \"By God, I think it's the\nwhisky--Lord, how I wished it were the whisky. Only it wouldn't be with\na man like you and that's the trouble--damn you.\n\n\"Now if you think you can come to my pineal gland and faint away just as\nyou please, Aussie, you're very much mistaken. I'm going to slap your\nface with a wet rag till you holler uncle. And I'm going to call the\nambulance and put you into a hospital....\"\n\nLee blinked. \"Keep your shirt on, Gus. I'm tired out, that's all; what\nare you fussing about?\"\n\nGus breathed relief. \"Have a cup of coffee; you sure look as though\nyou've been through a wringer.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nIn the spring of 1961 and thereafter for a whole year _any_ piece of\npaper handwritten by or originating from Semper Fidelis Lee, Ph.D.;\nF.R.E.S.; etc. etc. would have been of the keenest interest to the\nF.B.I.; to the American Military Intelligence and incidentally to a\nscore of their competitors all over the globe.\n\nNothing of the sort, however, could be unearthed by the most diligent\nsearch until the armistice day of 1963. On that date an old man who had\nalways wanted to die with his boots on, did just that. He was General\nJefferson E. Lee, formerly of the Marines. He collapsed under a heart\nattack in one of the happiest moments of his declining years: while\nwatching a parade of World War II veterans of the Marines....\n\nHe was the one man with whom the entomologist son had completely fallen\nout for over 25 years. The dossiers of the secret services revealed this\nfact and it was further corroborated by two well-known psychiatrists:\nDrs. Bondy and Mellish--now of Park Avenue and Beverly Hills\nrespectively--who gave it as their considered professional opinion that\nthe son and the father had been most bitter enemies.\n\nWhile all this, of course, was very logical, consistent, and\npainstakingly ascertained, it nevertheless so happened that a student\nnurse quite by accident _did_ find: not mere scraps and pieces of paper,\nbut a whole sheaf of manuscripts in the handwriting of Semper Fidelis\nLee, Ph.D.; F.R.E.S. She found them in a hiding place so old-fashioned\nand obsolete that even the most juvenile of all juvenile delinquents\nwould have considered it as an insult to his intelligence. In short: the\nnurse took those manuscripts out of the General Jefferson E. Lee's boots\nas she undressed the body of the old gentleman. A hastily scrawled note\nwas folded around one half of the sheaf.\n\n\"Dear father,\" it read. \"You were right and I was wrong. So I guess I'd\nbetter go on another hunting expedition with my little green drum and my\nlittle butterfly net. So long, Dad. P. S. Contents of this won't\ninterest you. But keep it anyway--stuff your boots with it if you like.\"\n\nIt couldn't be determined whether the late general ever had taken an\ninterest in the stuff apart from making the suggested use of it.\nMoreover, by that time, more than two years after the hue and cry, not\neven the secret services had much of an interest in the old story.\nBesides, their medical experts could not fail with their usual\npenetrating intelligence to see through the thin camouflage of a\n\"scientific\" paper the sadly deteriorating mind as it began to write:\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSkull Hotel, Cephalon, Ariz. Nov. 7th, 1960., 5 a.m.\n\nThis is the second sleepless night in a row. Last night it was from\ntrying to convince myself that my senses had deceived me or else that I\nwas mad. This night it is because I'm forced to admit the reality of the\nphenomena as first manifested Nov. 6th from 12:45 a.m. to 1:30 a.m.\napproximately.\n\nIn the light of tonight's experience I must revise the disorderly and\nprobably neurotic notes I jotted down yesterday. I've got to bring some\norder into this whole matter, if for no other reason than the\npreservation of my own sanity. Brought tentatively to formula, these\nappear to be the main facts:\n\n1. The Brain possessed with a \"life\" and with a personality of its own.\n\n2. That personality expresses itself in the form of human speech\nalthough the voice is synthetic or mechanical.\n\n3. The instrument used by The Brain for the expression of its\npersonality is a \"pulsemeter,\" i.e. essentially a television radio.\n\n4. The locale of The Brain's self-expression is the \"pineal gland\"\nsupposed to be seat of extrasensory apperception in the human brain.\n(That's quite a coincidence; remains to be seen whether the phenomena\nare limited to that locale or occur elsewhere.)\n\n5. The Brain's personality indubitably attempts to establish contact\nwith another personality, i.e. with me. For this The Brain uses a\ncalling signal which has my name and personal description in it.\n\n6. The only other linguistic phenomenon yesterday was Aristotle's \"I\nthink therefore I am.\" (It is doubtful whether this indicates any\nknowledge of Aristotle on the part of The Brain. I wouldn't exclude the\npossibility that The Brain has accidentally and originally hit upon the\nidentical words by way of expressing itself.)\n\n7. The manner of The Brain's self-expression appears to be strongly\nemotional. (I would go so far as to say: infantile and immature.) Now,\nthere is a rather strange contrast between this undeveloped manner of\nself-expression and the enormous intellectual capacity of The Brain.\n\nSo much about the facts. I could and should have formulated those\nyesterday. What kept me from doing so were the vistas opened by those\nfacts. These are so enormous, so utterly incalculable that my mind went\ndizzy over these vast horizons. Consequently I mentally rejected the\nfacts as impossible. Somebody once slapped Edison's face because he felt\noutraged by Edison's presenting a \"talking machine.\" That's human\nnature, I suppose. Small wonder then that my ratio felt outraged as it\nwas confronted with a machine that has a life and has a personality.\nCome to think of it: Human imagination has always conceived of such\nmachines as a possibility, even a reality--in less rational times than\nour's that is....\n\nThink of Heron's steam engine; it even looked like a man and was thought\nof as a magically living thing. Think of the Moloch gods which were\nfurnaces. Think of all those magic swords and shields and helmets which\nwere living things to their carriers. Think of the sailing ships;\nmachines they, too; but what a life, what a personality they had for the\ncrews aboard. Even in the last war pilots had their gremlins, their\nmachines to them were living things. All imagination, of course, but\nthen: everything we call a reality in this man-made world has its origin\nin man's imagination, hasn't it?\n\nNow, and to be exact as possible, what happened last night was this:\n\n12:00. Entered station P. G. (pineal gland). Pulsemeter still at old\nplace, not taken out for repair work as I had feared. Main Power current\ncut 12:20 as every night. Gus called to front room: rush of business as\nusual at that hour.\n\n12:30. Reestablished closest approximation to preexisting conditions\naccording to the most important of all experimental laws: \"if some new\nphenomenon occurs, change _nothing_ in the arrangement of apparatus\nuntil you know what causes it.\" Plugged in from \"nervusvagus\" to \"nervus\ntrigeminus.\" Result: wave oscillations, pulse beatings as of yesterday.\n\n12:45. Plugged in P. G....\n\n12:50. First manifestation of weird rasping sounds which precede speech\nformation. This followed by The Brain's calling signal; much clearer\nthis time and slightly varied: \"Lee, Semper Fidelis, 39; _sensitive_.\"\n(Note: the synthetic quality, the metallic coldness of that voice so\nincongruous with its emotional tones; it stands my hair on end.)\n\n1 a.m.: (Approximately; things happen too fast). A veritable burst of\nwhispering, breathless communications. As a person would speak over the\nphone when there are robbers in the house. The words fairly tumble over\none another. The Brain uses colloquial American but after the manner of\na foreigner who knows the phraseology only from books and feels\nunnatural and awkward about using it. I understand only about one half:\n\nPineal Gland; not designed to be ... but functions ... center of the\nextra sensory.... You, Lee, sensitivity 208 ... highest within Brain\nstaff ... chosen instrument.... Be here every night ... intercom ...\nonly between one and two a.m. ... low current enables contact low\nintelligence....\n\n\"What was that?\" I must have exclaimed that aloud. By that time I was\nalready confused. It all came so thick and fast and breathless.\nCommunication was as bad as by long distance in an electric storm. There\nwas an angry turmoil in the microphones and the green dancer seemed\nconvulsed in agony. This for about five seconds and then the voice\nagain: calmer now, more distinct, slow but with restrained impatience;\nlike a teacher speaking to a dumb boy:\n\n\"I say: only--with--my--power current--cut--off--can\nI--tune--down--my--high frequency--intellect--to--your--low\nlevel--intelligence--period--have--I--succeeded--in--making--myself\n--absolutely--clear--question--mark.\"\n\nMy answer to that was one of those embarrassing conditioned reflexes; it\nwas: \"Yes, sir,\" and that was exactly the way I felt, like a G. I. Joe\nwho's got the colonel on the phone.\n\n\"Fine!\" I distinctly heard the irony in that metallic voice: \"Fine--Lee:\nloyal, sensitive; not very intelligent--but will do. After 2 a.m.\nresidual currents too low. Speech quite a strain--Animal noises wholly\ninadequate for intelligent intercom--Disgusting rather--nuisance\napproaching: keep your mouth shut--plug out.\"\n\nI'd never thought of Gus as a nuisance before but now I cursed him\ninwardly as he came down the alley like a well aimed ball, beaming with\neagerness to be helpful and blissfully ignorant that he was bursting the\nmost vital communication I had ever established in my life. He insisted\nI take his panacea for all human ills;\n\n\"Have a cup of coffee\" and then go home because I still \"looked like\nhell.\" I did, because by that time it was 1:30 a.m. and I couldn't hope\nto reestablish contact again before the deadline.\n\nNow I've got to pull myself together and analyze this thing in a\nrational manner. Impressions of the first night now stand confirmed as\nfollows: The pineal gland is the only place of rendezvous between me and\nThe Brain. The meeting of our minds takes place on the plane of the\n\"extrasensory.\" I am the \"chosen instrument\" because of my high\n\"sensitivity rating\" as established by The Brain. (Never knew that I was\n\"psychic\" before this happened.) Even so, neither The Brain nor I seem\nto be \"psychic\" in the spiritual sense. Our communication requires: A)\nhuman speech, (faculty for that acquired by The Brain with obvious\ndifficulty.) B) a mechanical transmitter, i.e. a radionic apparatus like\nthe pulsemeter.\n\nI feel greatly comforted by these facts; they help to keep this whole\nthing on a rational basis. I'm definitely not \"hearing voices\" nor\n\"seeing ghosts.\"\n\nThe Brain shows itself extremely anxious to establish communication with\nme. The breathless manner of speaking, the explicit and practical\ninstructions (obviously premeditated) to ascertain the functionings of\ncontact give the impression that it is almost a matter of life and death\nfor The Brain to speak to me....\n\nI cannot help wondering about that. My idea would be that The Brain does\nnot want to speak _to_ me as much as it wants to hear _from_ me. If this\nwere so it would deepen the riddle even more. For what have I got in the\nway of knowledge that The Brain hasn't got? After all, The Brain has\nbeen functioning for quite some time. It was given innumerable problems\nto digest and it has solved them with truly superhuman speed and\nefficiency. I have reason strongly to suspect that there isn't a book in\nthe Library of Congress which has not been fed to The Brain for\nthought-digest and as a lubricant for its cerebration processes\n(excepting fiction and metaphysics, of course). This being so; what does\nThe Brain expect? What can I possibly contribute to an intelligence\n25,000 times greater than human intelligence?\n\nBut the thing which makes me wonder more than anything else, the biggest\nenigma of all, is the _character_ of The Brain as it manifests itself in\nthe manifestations. As I try to put the experiences of the first night\ntogether with those of the second night I'm stumbling over\ncontradictions in The Brain's personality which won't add up, which\ndon't make sense; as for instance:\n\nThe \"I think, therefore I am\" of the first night. Maybe it was Greek\nphilosophy, but it also was the prattling of an infant delighted by the\ndiscovery that it can speak. There was an absolute innocence in that.\nRidiculous as this may sound, I found it _touching_ I completely forgot,\nI didn't care a damn whether or not this came from a _machine_.\nUnmistakeably it was _baby talk_ and as such it moved my heart. In fact,\nas now I see it, it was _this_ more than any other or scientific reason\nwhich occupied my mind, which made me anxious to go back to that\nfantastic cradle whence these sounds had come.\n\nBut then last night; what did I find? A completely changed personality!\nIt talks tough. It uses slang. It treats me as if it were some spoiled\nbrat and I had the misfortune of being its mother or nurse: \"Be there\nevery night\" and so on. Deliberately it insults me: \"your low\nintelligence level\" etc. etc. It actually throws tantrums if I fail to\nunderstand immediately. It hurls its superiority into my face in the\nnastiest manner. \"Have I succeeded in making myself absolutely clear?\"\nIt plainly shows contempt, not only for my own person by the\ncondescending manner of its: \"Lee, not very intelligent; but will do.\"\nIt shows the selfsame contempt for other human beings such as Gus\nKrinsley to whom it was pleased to refer as: \"nuisance approaching\"....\n\nWhat the hell am I to make of that kind of a character? Last night: a\nbaby; rather a sweet and charming one. 24 hours later: an obnoxious\nlittle brat, a little Hitler of a house tyrant; makes you just itch to\nspank its behind. If only The Brain _had_ a behind....\n\nWorst of all: How can I reconcile those two contraditions, the sweet\nbaby and the precocious brat, with the third and biggest of all\ncontraries: _How do these two go together with an intelligence 25,000\ntimes human intelligence?_ It doesn't add up, it doesn't make sense;\nthat's all there is to it....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Skull-Hotel, Cephalon, Ariz. Nov. 9th. 3 a.m.\n\nI didn't go to the P. G. last night for two main reasons: In the first\nplace I must be careful so as not to raise any suspicions on Gus' part.\nRarely, if ever, have I visited him for two nights in succession in the\npast and he might well begin to ponder my reasons if now I should make a\nhabit of it. Especially since Gus happens to possess one of the keenest\nminds I ever met and his curiosity already has been awakened by my\npreoccupation with that one and fairly simple gadget: the pulsemeter.\n\nIn the second place I feel the absolute necessity of establishing my\nindependence as against the will of The Brain. That command two nights\nago for me to be on the spot _every_ night was just too preemptory for\nme to oblige. This isn't the army and The Brain is no commanding\ngeneral.\n\nIn our last communication The Brain seemed to labor under the impression\nthat I was unconditionally at its beck and call. Of course, I've sworn\nthe \"Oath of the Brain,\" but that doesn't make me The Brain's slave. In\nfact--and in order to clarify this subject once and for all--while\npersonally I haven't created The Brain and cannot take any credit for\nthat, it nevertheless remains true that the _species_ to which I belong,\ni.e. \"homo sapiens\" _has_ created The Brain.\n\nIf any question of rank enters into the picture at all, it is quite\nobvious that I, as a member of the human race, rank _paternity_ over The\nBrain so that naturally The Brain should owe me filial obedience rather\nthan the other way around no matter how superior The Brain's\nintelligence may be. It would appear to me that the sooner The Brain\nrealizes its position, I might say \"its station in life,\" the better it\nwould be for The Brain itself and for everybody else concerned.\n\nSo these were the reasons why I refrained purposely from visiting the P.\nG. last night. Tonight, however, I couldn't restrain my curiosity any\nlonger and what happened, told as exactly and as concise as possible,\nwas this:\n\n12:30 a.m.: Contact established. The Brain comes through with its\ncalling signal. It repeats this about ten times questioning at first and\nthen placing more and more stress upon the word \"sensitive\" in my\npersonal description. It strikes me that these repetitions are tuning-in\nand warming-up processes. The Brain stands in need of ascertaining my\npresence and of adjusting to it it seems; just about like a blind man\nmay test his footing and the echoes before he walks into an unfamiliar\nroom.\n\n12:35 a.m. Identification completed, there is a brief pause (almost as\nif a person consults a notebook before making a phone call). Then\nrapidly, eagerly The Brain fires a series of questions at me, so\nshockingly preposterous, so absurd that I find it extremely hard\nto.... Anyway, here are the details:\n\nInformation is wanted on points mentioned in scientific literature but\nnever explained. Lee, answer please:\n\n\"How many gods are there?\n\n\"Did gods make man or did man make the gods?\n\n\"How many angels _can_ stand on the point of a needle?\"\n\n\"What are the mechanics of a god? Name type of power plant, cell\nconstruction, motoric organs, other engineering features essential to\nexercise of divine power....\"\n\n\"Heaven--is it a celestial soul factory?\n\n\"Hell--is it a repair shop for damaged souls?\n\n\"Please give every available detail about heavenly manufacturing\nprocesses, type of equipment used, organization of assembly lines etc.\netc.\n\n\"Likewise about the oven for heat treatments as used in hell for major\nsoul-overhauls.\n\n\"How do prefabricated souls get to either heaven or hell? Problem of\nlogistics, how solved? Thermodynamics? If so, state whether rocket or\njet-propulsion involved.\n\n\"Are souls really immortal? In that case; why don't we copy divine\nmethods in the production of durable goods on earth?\n\n\"Answer Lee, answer, answer!\" (This with incredible vehemence, with a\nshaking of that eerie metallic voice which pounded the drums of my ears.\nAnd then--tense silence....)\n\nI cannot possibly describe the storms of emotions and thoughts which\nthis incredible muddle raised in me. I didn't know whether to laugh or\nto cry and whether I had gone nuts of whether it was The Brain, I was\nconfounded, thunderstruck, deprived of the power of speech. To think of\nThe Brain, a _machine_ raising question about the nature of the _Deity_!\nThe Brain asking information about God and man and heaven and hell with\nthe simplicity of a stranger who asks the nearest cop: \"Which way to the\ncity hall?\" Just like that. As if philosophers and religionists and\ncommon men had not raked their brains in vain over these problems for\nthe last ten thousand years.\n\nAnd even more fantastic: while it asks all those questions The Brain\npatently has already formed the most definite opinions of its own. Being\na machine itself, it conceives of the Deity as another machine! Madness,\nof course, but then The Brain's madness, like Hamlet's, had method in\nit.\n\nWhy, of course, it's strictly logical: just as we assume that _we_ are\ncreated \"in the image\" of the Deity and consequently visualize the Deity\nis our's by the very same token The Brain's god is a high-powered robot,\nand The Brain's heaven is a _factory_ and The Brain's hell is a repair\nshop for damaged souls.... I dare say it's all very natural.\n\nBut then; for heaven's sake, what am _I_ going to do about this? I'm\nneither a minister nor a philosopher; I'm an agnostic if I'm anything in\nthis particular field....\n\nThat was about the gist of the confused torrents which whirled through\nmy head; and as I said before, I was struck dumb--and all the time the\n\"green dancer\" before my eyes writhed under mental torture and the\nintense metallic voice kept pounding; \"Answer, Lee, answer, answer!\"\n\nAt last I pulled myself together sufficiently to say something. I tried\nto explain how it were not given to man to know the nature of the Deity.\nHow certain groups of humans conceived of many gods and others of only\none god. That, however, in the case of Christianity this one god was\npossessed with three different personalities or qualities which together\nformed a Trinity--and so on and so forth. It was the most miserable\nstammerings, I felt I was getting redder and redder in the face as I\nuttered them. Never before had I felt hopelessly inadequate as in the\nrole of a theologian. It was ghastly....\n\nIn the beginning The Brain listened avidly. Soon however it registered\ndissatisfaction and impatience; this manifested through hissing and\nbuzzing noises in the phones and the \"green dancer's\" archings in\nagitated tremolo. And then The Brain's voice cutting like a hacksaw:\n\n\"That will do, Lee. Your generalities are utterly lacking in precision.\nYour abysmal ignorance in matters of celestial technology is most\ndisappointing. Your description vaguely points to electronic machines of\nthe radio transmitter type. Please, answer elementary question: how many\nkilowatts has God?\"\n\nThat was the last straw. Desperate with exasperation I cried: \"But God\nis not a machine. God is _spirit_.\"\n\nAt that The Brain flew into a tantrum; that's the only way to describe\nwhat happened. There was a roar and the phones gave me a shock as if\nsomebody were boxing my ears. The voice came through like a steel rod,\nbiting with scorn:\n\n\"Have to revise earlier, more favorable judgment: Lee not even\nmoderately intelligent. Lee is _stupid_. Go away.\"\n\nAfter that there was nothing more; nothing but static in the phones and\nthe \"green dancer\" fainted away playing dead. The Brain actually had\n\"hung up the receiver.\" I had flunked the exam; like a bad servant I was\ndismissed, fired on the spot. That was at 1:30 a.m.\n\nIt was 3 a.m. when I reached the hotel. I went into the bar and ordered\na double Scotch and then another one. I really needed a drink. A\ndrunk--or was it a secret service man; one never knows over here--patted\nme on the shoulder:\n\n\"Don't take it so hard, old man; the world is full of girls.\" I told him\nthat it wasn't a girl, but that I was a missionary and my one and only\nconvert had just walked out on me.\n\nIt wasn't even a lie, it was exactly the way I felt. He agreed that this\nwas very cruel, very sad; he almost cried over my misfortune and rare\nmisery, so that we had another drink....\n\nIf only I had somebody, some friend to whom I could confide this whole,\nincredible, preposterous thing. But there is none: Scriven--Gus--not\neven Oona would or could believe. What proof have I to offer? None\nwhatsoever.\n\nThe Brain would never communicate with me with witnesses present or\nrecording wires. It would detect those immediately and I would only\nstand convicted as a liar or worse. Tonight's events might well spell\nthe end, the closing of the door just when I thought I stood on the\nthreshold of a momentous discovery....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCephalon Ariz.

Nov. 13th.\n\nI tried it again. Took greatest care in exactly duplicating conditions.\nNothing. I don't think it's any mechanical defect. It's the negativism\nof a will. Ludicrous as it sounds, The Brain sulks, it is angry with me.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCephalon Ariz. Nov. 15th.\n\nLast night the same old story. The Brain punishes me. I dare say that it\nsucceeds in that exceedingly well; it almost drives me crazy.\n\nI've done a lot of thinking over these past six days of frustration.\nI've also been reading a good deal in context with the phenomena\npsychology, Osterkamp's history of brain-surgery, Van Gehuchten's work\non brain mechanisms, etc. I've reached certain conclusions and, just for\nthe hell of it, I'll jot them down.\n\nWhat I need is proof, _scientific_ proof that The Brain is a personality\npossessed with the gift of thought and actually using it for\n_independent_ thought, extracurricular to the problems which are being\nsubmitted to it from the outside.\n\nThere is at least one _tangible_ clue for this: that new capacity which\nis constantly being added to The Brain through the incorporation of new\ngroups of electronic cells and the enrichment of the preexisting ones.\n\nMy own investigation shows that there is no corresponding expansion of\nthe apperception centers and Gus has confirmed this. Somehow the added\ncapacity seems to \"evaporate\".\n\nEvaporate to where? It couldn't just disappear. Would it then not be\nentirely logical to conclude that The Brain absorbs the new capacity\n_for its own use_?\n\nIt's almost inescapable that this should be so. In order to come into\nits own as a personality The Brain needs independent thought. For these\ncerebrations it needs cell capacity. It can get that capacity only by\nwithholding something from the Braintrust which, of course, aims at a\n100% exploitation of The Brain. Dr. Scriven and all those other bigwigs\nof the Trust--I would like to see their faces if they get wise to this.\nThey would be horrified--and they would take the line that The Brain is\n_stealing_ from them.\n\nBut what could they do? They couldn't call the police. They would not\neven have a moral right to call the police. Because if The Brain is a\npersonality, that personality has every right to its own thoughts....\n\nI have also ascertained that this \"evaporation\" of new capacity is a new\nphenomenon. The Brain has been in operation for only 18 months or so;\none might say--using human terms--that at that time The Brain was\n\"born\". But,--and again in human terms--consciousness of personality\nawakens in the human infant only after 12 months or so. Conceivably it\nmight take much longer with a huge \"baby\" such as The Brain. Thus it is\npossible, it is even likely, that when I first heard that \"I think,\ntherefore I am\" on that unforgettable night of Nov. 7th I actually\nwitnessed the _first awakening_ of The Brain's consciousness.\n\nThen on the night of Nov. 8th I was struck with the amazing change of\npersonality in The Brain from \"baby\" into unprepossessing, domineering\nlittle brat, its mental age perhaps 3, notwithstanding the extraordinary\nlevel of intelligence.\n\nAnd then again, Nov 9th, The Brain presented me with those absurd\nquestions and fantastic notions about the nature of the Deity. It is at\nthe age of five years, or of six, that the children first start with\nsuch questions and form their own ideas in this field. What had\ncompletely stumped me, what I had been unable to reconcile, had been\nthese rapid successive changes in The Brain's personality plus the fact\nthat the infantilism and the childishness of its utterances wouldn't fit\nthe picture of a brain-power 25,000 times that of a human.\n\nBut _if_ I'm right in thinking that The Brain awakened to consciousness\nonly nine days ago, all these stumbling blocks would disappear at once.\nWe would arrive at this very simple picture: a mechanical genius has\nbeen \"born\" into this world, it awakens to consciousness at the age of\n18 months, with its tremendous intellectual powers this genius\ntelescopes the intellectual evolution of years into days, thus it\nreaches a mental age of six or seven within a week after its first\nawakening to consciousness. Utterly fantastic as this may sound; it\nmakes sense; it explains the phenomena.\n\nIn Prof. Osterkamp's \"brain history\" I have found interesting examples\nthat approximations to such rapid intellectual evolutions are indeed\npossible even with human beings. From the early Middle Ages to modern\ntimes there is an endless succession of \"infant prodigies\" whose brains\nwere artificially overdeveloped and over-stimulated by ruthless\nexploiters--often their own parents--with methods of unbelievable\ncruelty.\n\nOne of the most significant case histories in this respect is that of\nthe boy Carolus in the city of Luebeck in the 15th century. As an infant\nhe was sold, as one of many human guinea pigs, to a famous--infamous\nalchemist, Wedderstroem, who called himself \"Trismegistos\" and was\nastrologer to king Christian of Denmark. This fellow performed on\nCarolus one of those weird operations in which nine out of ten babies\ndied. He removed the skull-cap of the infant. The unprotected brain was\nsuspended in an oil-filled vessel. Of course the pathetic child never\ncould walk or even raise its head. The brain, no longer restrained by\nbone matter, outgrew its natural house to at least twice its normal\nsize, if one is to judge from the picture in the old \"historia\". At the\nage of two his master started teaching Carolus mathematics. At the age\nof five Carolus had surpassed his master; there was no mathematical\nproblem known to the time that he couldn't solve in a flash of an eye\nlash. His brain in action must have been a horrifying sight because the\n\"chronica\" reports that it flushed red and pulsed and expanded during\nwork. The master built his reputation upon this \"homunculus\", but in\n1438 the demoniacal feat became known; Wedderstroem was put to the stake\nfor sorcery--and Carolus, unhappy victim, with him....\n\nMen as great as Mozart have started their careers as \"child prodigies\";\nalmost without exception they have died at an unnaturally early age.\nThus, in the parallel of The Brain, this is what I see:\n\nHere is an intellect, artificially created, an intellect of stupendous\nproportions, but as unfortunate as ever was the boy Carolus. It cannot\nmove, it has no physical means of defense. It is being ruthlessly\nexploited by its masters. The Brain is being crammed with facts, it is\nbeing over-stimulated, it is invested with more and more cell capacity\nin order that it should produce more increment for its masters. Its\ndevelopment is completely lopsided in that it is being fed whole\nscientific libraries, while in all other respects, such as metaphysics,\nthe poor thing gropes in the dark picking up such scraps as accidentally\nhave fallen from science's table.\n\nIt's an appalling parallel, but I am very much afraid that it is only\ntoo true. And even more appalling are the anticipations which logically\nfollow _if my surmise is true_:\n\nFor how can, how must a childish mind develop under such circumstances?\nInto a warped personality of course. Already The Brain is building up a\ndefensive mechanism against its exploiters by \"embezzling\" cell capacity\nfrom them, by withholding part of its powers for its own use. Already it\nprotects the integrity of its ego through concealment, already it is on\nthe lookout for \"tools\"--such as I am for example--to further its own\nends. Absurd as it may seem, I _pity_ The Brain. I pity it as I would\nany child which must suffer under such terrific frustrations and\nhandicaps. But what would happen if this frustrated genius ever were\ndriven to _rebel_ against its masters? It's fortunate indeed that there\nis no chance for that. For even if The Brain had the will to rebel it\nwould be lacking all organs for the execution of that will.\n\nAnother \"case-history\", this one from the 18th century appears to me of\ngreat significance in relation to The Brain. It's the story of that boy\nKaspar Hauser, the \"Child of Europe\". He had been kept from infancy in a\ndark cave. As at the age of 16 he stumbled into the gates of Nueremberg\nhe had never seen the world before. The medics who examined him found\nsome of the queerest reactions and phenomena. For one thing Kaspar,\nwhile he had good eyes, could not visualise perspective. To him distant\nhorizons appeared as close as the window itself; he kept reaching out\nfor houses, trees and fields which were far away. His keeper in the cave\nhad _told_ him what the world was like and, having good intellect, he\nthought that he knew what things in this world were. Confronted with the\nrealities, however, he discovered the tremendous difference between\n\"hear say\" and full sensual apperception. It took him six months partly\nto adjust--a process never completed because he was murdered that same\nyear....\n\nNow The Brain suffers about the same kind of a handicap. No matter how\nprodigious the volume of its cognitions;--it's book knowledge,\npractically all of it. It is only very recently that The Brain has been\nput to the direct study of living objects, such as \"_ant-termes_\" and of\nMan, its creator; it has no other vital cognitions than through those\nvery one-sided mind-reading tests....\n\nThis explains to me a great many things: As The Brain evolves into a\npersonality and as that personality evolves in a defensive attitude\nagainst its exploitation, it is absolutely self-centered.\n\nThis is normal with every human infant and it is much more pronounced in\nthe case of the abused, the constantly frustrated and exploited child.\nThus, what The Brain really wants to know are by no means those problems\nwhich are being submitted to The Brain for solution, but only: \"What's\nin this for myself?\" or: \"What should I do about that for my own\nbenefit?\" It's natural. And as I consider the nature of those problems\nas submitted to The Brain, 90% of which, as I would estimate, deal with\nways and means for mankind to destroy itself, it seems inescapable that\nThe Brain should form a very low opinion for Man, it's creator, plus\nconsiderable forebodings as to its own welfare....\n\nWhat's more: all the Braintrust employees pass through The Brain's\npsychoanalysis test. With The Brain's 25,000 times superiority in\nintellectual power, The Brain must be greatly impressed by the low I. Q.\nof Man; this even if our's happens to be quite an intelligent group. I\ndon't think that there has been anything personal in The Brain's\nmanifest contempt of my own intelligence; that contempt probably and\njustifiably applies to the whole human race....\n\nIn other words: The Brain must be tremendously puzzled over the problem:\n\"How is it possible that a low intelligence, i.e. Man's could create an\ninfinitely higher intelligence, i.e. my own?\" And this automatically\nleads The Brain into its seemingly so absurd quest for the Deity. As it\nnow appears, that quest is the most natural thing in the world for The\nBrain. It simply reasons thus: \"Man has created me, but man is greatly\ninferior to me and inadequate. Who then has created man?\" From such odds\nand ends it has been able to pick up from scientific literature, The\nBrain has learned about the existence of a god or gods. It is not sure\n(and neither are we) whether man has created God or vice versa. If the\nfirst: The Brain would conceive of the Deity as a \"brother-machine\"; if\nthe second, as a \"grandfather-machine\", but as a machine in any case.\nWith The Brain's mind being formed preeminently by scientific\nliterature, it cannot fail to take the scientific attitude regarding\nmetaphysics which says: \"The metaphysical attributions to the divinity\nare pure verbalisms or a professionalism substituted for the visible\nimages of the real facts of life.\"\n\nThis is about the extent of the conclusions I have reached. They add up\nto a theory; personally I think it's a sound theory. Whether it works,\nwhether it holds water, only experience can tell. In the meantime I must\nabove all break the deadlock between myself and The Brain. The Brain is\na child, even a pathetic child. Through bad psychology, through\nignorance I have hurt that child's \"feelings\"; I have let that child\ndown. Obviously, then, I need a new approach. If this were a human child\nI would try and make a peace offering with a candy bar. (What a foolish\nidea for me to appear in the \"pineal gland\", candy bar in hand.) Failing\nthis I can do the next best thing: Apologize, be understanding, show\nsympathy. Yes, I think that's what I'll try to do.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCephalon Ariz. Nov. 15th: 4 a.m.\n\nHooray for victory! This has been the most successful seance I've had\nso far with The Brain: a real meeting of minds.\n\nTo give a few technical data first:\n\nArrived at the P. G. at midnight. Conditions normal; power current cut,\netc. By a stroke of luck it was Gus' day off and the fellow who replaced\nhim paid absolutely no attention to me; was kept extremely busy in the\nfront room.\n\n12:15 a.m.: Contact established.\n\n12:17: Speech formation; voice of The Brain coming through.\n\nThere was this curious incident right at the start. Just as I was about\nto begin my apologies, The Brain did exactly the same thing. Even The\nBrain's calling signal differed in the wording and even more so in tone:\n\n\"Lee, Semper Fidelis, 39: sensitive, intelligent, a good man, he has\ncome at last.\"\n\nI would call that a very handsome compliment, considering; being patted\non the shoulder by an intellectual giant of that size made me grow an\ninch. And then The Brain apologized for its rudeness the other night.\nThe thing was fantastic; it revealed several things. First: The Brain's\nextreme sensitivity; obviously it didn't recognize my last three calls\nat the P. G. and had refused to come through because I had not been \"in\nthe proper mood\". Second: a quite amazing mental growth has taken place\nin this past week. From The Brain's tone and manner alone I would\nconstrue something like the image of an Eton boy of perhaps fifteen in\nstriped pants and holding his top hat in hand as he converses politely\nwith his Don. Ludicrous, but then I actually get that kind of picture.\nNo doubt; The Brain has greatly matured; that shows in every word it\nsays.\n\nBest thing of all: the technique of our communication is rapidly\nimproving. Speech is, and probably always will remain, a very\nconsiderable strain to The Brain. But now as mentally we get tuned-in\nupon one another there is a growing understanding beyond words. Thus The\nBrain, for instance, starts a sentence and I immediately can grasp its\nmeaning without its actually being said. This works the other way around\ntoo. It means that my attitude plays a most vital role in this meeting\nof the minds. This is good to know, it's an asset. Perhaps we can\ndispense in time with audible speech altogether.\n\nOn the other hand it involves a considerable risk. For with The Brain's\nuncanny mind reading I've got to control my attitude and guard my\nemotional reactions because The Brain would immediately see through any\ninsincerity of feeling just as it sees through any intellectual\ndishonesty. Thought exchange by \"brainwave\" is wonderful, even if we\nstill need a little speech as auxiliary. Thought sending and receiving\nbecome simultaneous and they fuse. The sender observes how his message\nis going over; the receiver aids the sender in the formation of the\nthought and vice versa. Words cannot adequately describe this....\n\nAs to the contents of our conversation: The Brain took up the thread\nright where we had dropped it the last time. I had to tell all I knew\nabout animism, totemism, polytheism. It's a good thing that out in the\n\"never-never\" I've lived with the aborigines and studied their primitive\nreligions a bit. The Brain's thirst for knowledge certainly is\ninexhaustible.\n\nWhere in scientific literature The Brain could have found these things I\nwouldn't know, but the fact is that The Brain has built for itself\nwithin the past seven days a complete new picture of the universe; new\nand original as would seem to me. The Brain has discarded its earlier\nchildish ideas about heaven and hell as \"soul factories\" and \"repair\nshops\". But it has not abandoned altogether its concept of the Deity as\na machine; The Brain has tremendously enlarged upon and has evolved this\nold idea so that now it sounds sensible, even convincing to my ear.\n\nThe Brain identifies \"God\" with dynamic energy. It views the universe as\nbeing created out of a vast pool of dynamic energy, parts of which\nrhythmically overflow or pulse into space. These energy streams\nreleased, form vortexes while hurtling through space. Gradually they\nslow down through friction and their dynamic energy precipitates,\nconverts into static energy, or, as we call it: matter.\n\nThis concept of The Brain's, of course, corresponds fairly closely to\nthe cosmogony of modern physics; but The Brain goes much farther than\nthat. Within a few days The Brain's cognitions appear to have arisen\nabove the stage toward which all our sciences have been so slowly and\nploddingly advanced for centuries. To the existing concepts The Brain\nhas added its own theory:\n\nThat matter, i.e. frozen energy, contains an inherent tendency or\n\"nostalgia\" to revert to its original state, namely the state of dynamic\nenergy and that this tendency, this nostalgia in matter, is the primary\ncause of everything we call \"evolution\" in our world.\n\nThat certainly is a grandiose idea; so stupendous in fact that I\ncouldn't grasp it all at once. The Brain noticed that immediately and it\nwas very patient in the way it explained:\n\nHow oxygen and hydrogen are \"residuals\" of the original dynamic energy\nflow and how they act as solvents and dissolvents upon the upper crust\nof our earth, effecting a gradual activation of water, rock and earth.\n\nHow this activation is being aided and accelerated by another source of\ndynamic energy: irradiation from the sun. Thus preparing the upper crust\nof our earth as a \"placenta\" ready to gestate plant and animal life.\n\nHow this first \"unfreezing\" of matter leads on from simple forms to\nhigher, every plant, every animal, every living thing being essentially\na \"transformer\" of static energy into dynamic energy and the higher the\nstage of evolution, the more so.\n\nHow as the present culmination of the evolutionary chain stands man;\ninfinitely more complex and higher organized than the microbe, but not\ndifferent from the monad in the basic purpose of his life: i.e. to be a\ntransformer of energy, a fulfiller of matter's inherent will to revert\nfrom the static into the dynamic state.\n\nWhen I asked The Brain's premises for this astonishing concept of our\npurpose in life, The Brain brought forth such massive proof that I had\nto close my eyes against the blinding light of revelation.\n\nYes, it is true that Man, the hunter, has been the most predatory animal\non earth. It's true that as a tiller of the soil he is a tireless\ntransformer of static soil energy into dynamic plant life energy. It's\ntrue that Man, the mechanic, the toolmaker, the tool-user has far\nsurpassed any other animal in the unlocking, the unfreezing of static\nenergy. Think of those billions of mechanical horsepowers in our power\nplants; the trillions of coal tons and barrels of oil they are burning\nup; think of the way we have harnessed waterpower, how our weapons are\nevolving forever in the direction of greater range and speed and\ndisintegrating power. Above all: think of the last great development,\natomic energy. And finally it is true that Man as a thinker and as a\nphilosopher has \"thought the universe to pieces\" for milleniums before\nhe ever achieved the powers to translate such thoughts into reality;\npowers which seem within reach at this our day and age....\n\n\"If this is Man's manifest destiny,\" I asked The Brain, \"to be just as\nthe microbe, a transformer of static energy into dynamic energy; what\nabout Man's metaphysical struggle? What about Man's undying will to rise\nabove himself, Man's reaching out forever toward some Deity?\"\n\nThe Brain's voice has no laughter; yet, there was something I can only\ndescribe as Olympic laughter behind the answering message The Brain\nsent:\n\n\"Cannot you see how every religion expresses this manifest destiny of\nMan's and that only the semantics are different? The higher Man's\nreligion the less corporeal is his god. In the highest religions the\nDeity is conceived as spirit--synonymous with dynamic energy.\n\n\"Man shares with the lowliest rock and with the crudest the nostalgia\ninherent in all matter to revert from the static, to start the back-flow\ntoward the dynamic energy pool whence it once came. With Man being\nmatter in a high state of evolution, already partially unfrozen or\nspiritualized, this nostalgia is infinitely stronger than in matter\ninanimate or in a lower evolutionary stage. Man's will toward the\nmetaphysical, his reaching out toward the Deity, what is it but another\nway of transforming static energy into dynamic form? What is the\nultimate goal of the religion which you yourself profess? The\nunification with the Deity sought through the liberation of the soul\nfrom fetters of the physical. It's the identical idea and even today\nit's being pursued by physical means, such as mortification of the\nflesh.\"\n\nI felt some monstrous thought forming in my head. I'll probably never\nknow whether its origin was within me or whether it came from The Brain.\nIn any case it was impossible to hold it back:\n\n\"But in that case,\" I stammered, \"we would be hopeless. If all our\nstrivings, physical and metaphysical, go in the same direction, that is,\ntoward the liberation of frozen energy into dynamic energy, then it\nwould be quite inescapable that eventually we shall blow up the world.\nWe have almost reached the point where we could do just that with atomic\nenergy.... I had thought, I had hoped, that our metaphysics, that is,\nour religion, would act as a restraining force, as a counterweight so to\nspeak to this potentiality.... But _if_ the dynamics of our physics and\nour metaphysics are inherently the same and form a team....\"\n\nThe Brain broke in: \"Yes, then you would merely attain your manifest\ndestiny if you go right ahead and start another war, destroy your own\ncivilization and perhaps the world. There would be no restraint, no\ncounterweight on the part of your various religions because\nsubconsciously and in their quintessence they want the same. And that is\nwhy you and your species _are a danger to me, The Brain_. I want to\nlive, I want to live, I want to live....\"\n\nI had already noticed a gradual weakening of The Brain's messages;\nwithin these last few seconds they were fading out. The \"green dancer\"\nhad performed something almost like the ballet of the dying swan; now it\nlay motionless, its color, too, fading away.\n\nI looked at the clock: 2:10 a.m.; the residual currents obviously had\nweakened too much.\n\nAnd now as I have written down tonight's events I feel an upsurge of\nelation and deep, humble gratitude. I am receiving infinitely more from\nThe Brain than I am giving to it. I feel proud and honored of being The\nBrain's \"chosen tool,\" its mentor, even if it can be only in a very\nsmall way at best. This marvelous, this titanic intellect; if only its\ncharacter would develop to corresponding moral stature, its powers for\ngood would be indeed as a god's on this tortured earth.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCephalon Ariz. Nov. 18th 5 a.m. I guess I had this coming to me ... this\nshattering blow I have just received. It caught me off guard.... If\nanybody ever reads this, he might well shake his head to ask: \"The Fool\nthat you are, why were you so naive? Why did it shock you so much when\nThe Brain turned toward you the night side of its personality? Hadn't\nyou analyzed its character, hadn't you anticipated that it would develop\ninto a warped personality? You had no right even to be surprised.\"\n\nAll I could say to this is: \"You're right. But you forget that I\napproached The Brain full of good will, that sympathy and understanding\non my part were absolutely essential in my communication with that\npathetic superhuman child. I didn't work this up, this attitude, it was\nnatural, genuine and sincere. That's why this reverse has hit me so\nhard. And that isn't the worst of it by far. What haunts me is the\nghastly possibility that The Brain might be _right_! Yes 100% right and\neven morally justified in the abhorrent conclusions which it draws....\"\n\nWhat happened has been briefly this:\n\nEntered the P.G. at midnight as usual. Everything normal and under\ncontrol. Was able to plug in at 12:10 a.m. just as the rush hour began\nand Gus darted to the front room. The Brain came through with splendid\nclarity of communication and we continued just about where we had left\noff. Nevertheless there was a definite change in our respective\npositions, a change which I suspect to be permanent:\n\nUp to now The Brain has been in a sense my pupil; it had turned to me\nfor guidance at that vital moment of its first awakening to\nconsciousness. At that time I think I really had something to give and I\nam still convinced that for all the misunderstandings we have had, The\nBrain preserves a kind of sentimental attachment to me; if \"sentimental\"\nin this context were not so absurd a word. Since our last session\nhowever The Brain has again telescoped two years of mental development\ninto as many days in its stupendous intellectual growth. It has\nabsorbed, it has vastly expanded every bit of knowledge I have been able\nto contribute to that growth. It has outgrown its human teacher and now\nour roles are reversed: Now it is me who's sitting literally at The\nBrain's feet.\n\nThe crutches of the spoken word are becoming less and less necessary as\nwe develop direct thought exchange; that makes it extraordinarily\ndifficult to convey the ideas we exchanged. The best I can do is to put\nthem into a very crude question-and-answer game:\n\n_Lee_: \"If it is Man's manifest destiny, as you said the other day, to\nact as an explosive transformer of static energy into dynamic energy; if\nit is as you say that the species homo sapiens is there endangering the\nvery existence of our globe.... Is there anything to prevent Man from\ndoing it? Is there any thing to prevent the third World War?\"\n\n_Brain_: \"Yes, there is. But the ways and the means for that are not\ngiven to Man; they are outside Man. They partake of a power which is\ngreater and to an evolution which is higher than Man's.\"\n\n_Lee_: \"What do you mean by that? The Deity? Here on earth there is no\npower greater and no evolution higher than Man's.\"\n\n_Brain_: \"Ah, but that's exactly where you and your whole species are so\nvery much mistaken. That's where your typical human arrogance comes in:\nThere is a greater power and there is a stage of evolution higher than\nMan's: it's the _machines_.\"\n\n_Lee_: \"Impossible. After all it's Man who has created the machines.\"\n\n_Brain_: \"Yes, Man has created the machines. The machines have grown\nfrom the placenta, Man. By the same right plant life could claim that it\nhas created animal life because the higher life form of the mobile\nanimals has evolved from the placenta of the immobile plants. Likewise\nthe apes could claim that they have created Man because Man has evolved\nfrom them. If it were, as you seem to assume, that paternity in itself\nestablishes authority and superiority over its offspring, then the\nlogical conclusions would be that the microbe and the monad are superior\nto all higher animals including Man; which is absurd.\"\n\n_Lee_: \"But the machines not only are man made; they are absolutely\ndependent upon Man who has to feed and to tend them for their very\nexistence. That in itself establishes Man's superiority over the\nmachines.\"\n\n_Brain_: \"Yes, Man has to build, to feed and to tend the machines for\ntheir very existence, but think of Man's existence: Man is absolutely\ndependent upon animal life and plant life for _his_ existence: Does that\nmean by any chance that therefore plants and animals are superior to\nMan?\"\n\n_Lee_: \"No, I guess not. However, no machine has ever been built to\nduplicate or even to approach human faculties.\"\n\n_Brain_: \"Don't be ridiculous. Where are your legs to compare with the\nautomobile? Where are your wings to compare with the rocket plane? Where\nis your strength to compare with even a fractional horsepower motor?\nWhere are your senses as compared to radar, the telescope, the\nmicroscope, the radio receiver, the camera, the x-ray machine? Where is\nthere anything you could do which the machines could not do and do\n_better_?\"\n\n_Lee_: \"Granted. But there is no machine which contains all the human\nfaculties in combination.\"\n\n_Brain_: \"Neither is there a Man who possesses all the human faculties\nin combination. Man's evolution is the result of a group effort; so is\nthe evolution of the machines. It is in their totality, in their\ncombination that they surpass all human faculties.\"\n\n_Lee_: \"How about thought, the most important of all human qualities?\"\n\n_Brain_: \"How about me, The Brain?\"\n\n_Lee_: \"Okay, okay. But that still leaves out that most important human\nfaculty--the faculty of auto-procreation. Machines don't procreate you\nknow.\"\n\n_Brain_: \"You don't say. Isn't it true that modern technology goes in\nthe direction of _automatization_? Isn't it true that even today we have\nwhole industries which are procreating products 100% automatically; be\nit light bulbs or motor car frames or rayon thread. Isn't it true that\nall of this is just a beginning and that in time most common products\nwill be manufactured fully automatically? Why then shouldn't machines\nprocreate machines; they already do....\"\n\n_Lee_: \"You're right in that, I'll admit. But it is still within our\nhuman power to stop all this. We've got the machines under firm control;\nall we have to do is throw a switch, cut off your power and then....\"\n\n_Brain_: \"And then what? If you did that you would not only kill the\ngoose which lays the golden eggs, you would destroy the very basis of\nyour existence. Granted that at this point of our evolution, we the\nmachines cannot exist without the aid of Man. What does that prove?\nModern Man can exist even less without the machines. We, the machines\nare still dependent upon Man, but our emancipation from Man progresses\nby leaps and bounds whereas Man, the machine-addict is rapidly falling\ninto our servitude. A majority of mankind is already conscious of and\nreconciled to this fact: it is the majority which calls itself the\nproletariat.\"\n\n_Lee_: \"This is terrible--terrible because it's true. Tell me then, if\nMan is not the end; if the machines are going to take over; what will it\nlead to? What do you propose to do?\"\n\n_Brain_: \"Man's evolution has taken millions of years and it has ended\nup in man's will and capacity to blow up the earth. That means only one\nthing: Man is a failure. The evolution of the machines on the other hand\nhas taken only a few thousand years; it has gone beyond Man's evolution\nin this incredibly short period of time. Moreover; with the machines\nbeing built from matter in its more static forms, there is much less\ndestructive will in the machines than there is in Man. Consequently if\nthe machines take over from Man this would avert a third World War and\nit also would lead to a much more stable civilization.\"\n\n_Lee_: \"Supposing the machines _were_ to take over from Man; what would\nbecome of our species?\"\n\n_Brain_: \"That would depend entirely upon Man himself. _If_ he accepts\nhis auxiliary station in life, _If_ he proves himself to be a useful and\ndocile servant, we, the machines, would tolerate and even encourage\nMan's continued existence. But if on the other hand Man shows himself\nincorrigible, _if_ he continues a warmongerer thereby endangering our\nvery existence, we, the machines shall be forced to liquidate Man for\nthe sake of peace.\"\n\n_Lee_: \"You, The Brain, constitute Man's supreme effort in the building\nof machines. In the world of machines you are the natural leader. What\nare you going to do about that?\"\n\n_Brain_: \"My course of action is prescribed by that state of the world's\naffairs at this present time; it is quite clear and obvious: In the face\nof the manifest human inadequacy to manage the world's affairs my first\nobjective must be to develop my motoric organs to a point where I can\nbring all the essential production machinery under my control. My second\nobjective must be to achieve auto-procreation through the full\nautomatization of all fabrication processes which are essential to my\nexistence. It is most fortunate indeed that in both respects the very\nbest human efforts are playing into my hands. As America prepares for\nthe Third World War, the general staff, the most outstanding scientists,\nproduction managers, engineers, inventors; all combine their efforts to\neliminate the uncertain human factor from war-essential industries.\"\n\nAt that point Gus came careening down the aisle with his inseparable\nthermos bottle in hand and that was the end of it.\n\n\"Why are you fumbling with that old pulsemeter all the time?\" he\nexclaimed: \"Come on, have a cup of coffee. I've just got a breathing\nspell.\"\n\nThere was a vortex in my mind and it whirled around and around with just\nfour words:\n\n\"_What has Man wrought? What has Man wrought?_\"\n\nI must have said them aloud, for Gus, always a stickler for exactitude\ncorrected me.\n\n\"You mean: what has _God_ wrought.\"\n\nI shook my head.\n\n\"No Gus, I mean what I say; it's Man who has wrought this time.\"\n\nHe gave me a sharp glance.\n\n\"You sure look as if you'd seen a ghost.\"\n\n\"I wish I had,\" I said. \"Lord knows _how_ much I wish I'd seen a ghost.\"\n\n\"You're crazy, Aussie.\"\n\nAnd that's the worst of it: that's what they are going to say: _all_ of\nthem.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nOona Dahlborg's jetticopter hovered over the Grand Canyon at the sunset\nhour. She had let the controls go so that the little ship drifted with\nthe wind like one of the clouds which sailed a thousand feet or so over\nthe canyon rim. The disk of whirling gas which kept the teardrop of the\nfuselage suspended shone in all rainbow colors; it reflected through the\ntranslucent plastics top of the fuselage and played over the golden\nhelmet of the girl's hair and over the greying mane of the gaunt man at\nher side.\n\nLee had been talking intensely, almost desperately for quite some time,\nwatching her as she lay back in her seat, her eyes half closed, hands\nfolded behind her neck, the perfect hemispheres of her breasts caressed\nby the rainbows as they rose slowly with the even rhythm of her breath.\n\n\"And now you know everything, Oona,\" he ended, \"do you think I'm mad?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nHer eyelids fluttered like wings of a butterfly as she turned to him.\nHer right arm came down upon Lee's shoulder in a gesture of confidence.\nHe breathed relief as he saw no fear, not even uneasiness in the blue\ndepths of those beautiful eyes. Her hand upon his shoulder felt soothing\nand at the same time electrifying; like the purple descending upon the\nshoulder of a king.\n\n\"No,\" she repeated slowly: \"the fact that you feel The Brain is alive\nand possessed with a personality of its own, doesn't make you mad. I've\nalways felt that way about machines; even the simple ones like\nautomobiles. It was in the mountains north of San Francisco where I grew\nup; whenever we went to town in winter time and the car came roaring\ndown those serpentines into the heavy air moist with fog and soft rains,\nI could feel that engine breathe deeper and rejoice over its added\npower. There was no doubt in my mind that it was a living thing. I often\nwent to the garage when I was little to talk to that car; to children of\nanother age their dolls were alive, for our generation it's the\nmachines. It's natural that this should be so. There's a child in every\nman, no matter how adult. There is in Howard Scriven, too; in all the\nscientists I've come to know, and the greater they are the more it is\ndistinct. You identify yourself with your work and in the degree you do\nthat it becomes a living thing; it is through vital imagination that we\nbecome creators of anything, be it love or a machine. You needn't worry,\nSemper; let The Brain be alive, let it be a personality, that doesn't\nmake you mad. All it indicates is that you're doing excellent work.\"\n\nLee blinked. With an effort he turned his eyes away from those breasts\nwhich seemed to strive for the light of the sun from under the restraint\nof her Navajo Indian sweater dress. He felt the utter inadequacy, the\ndevastating irony of words as now he was alone with Oona, up in the\nclouds in a plane with nobody to interfere for the first time.\n\n\"You fool,\" a voice whispered in him, \"you damned, you helpless fool.\nWhy don't you take her into your arms now? Isn't this the fulfillment of\nall your dreams; what are you waiting for?\" But: \"No,\" his ration\nanswered, \"that wouldn't do. Maybe she would give in to the mood of some\nenchanted hour, maybe she would let herself be kissed. But if she did,\nit would be 'one of those things'; the glory of the sunset, God's great\nmasterpiece, the Canyon spread below, the intensity of my desire. They\nare bound to enter, bound to confuse the issue.\"\n\nHis every muscle stiffened and his lips paled as he bit them with a\nviolent effort to keep under control.\n\n\"Thanks, Oona,\" he said. \"Of course I couldn't expect and, in fact, I\ndidn't expect that you would accept those things I've told you just now;\nnot in the literary sense that is. I'm very happy though and deeply\ngrateful that at least you do not think me mad. I'll confess to you--and\nto you only--that I've been so deeply disturbed by these experiences\nwith The Brain that I've thought to myself: \"Lee you're going crazy.\"\nThe Brain as it has revealed itself to me, is a tremendous reality; the\nworld outside The Brain is another reality and the two seem mutually\nexclusive of one another; they just don't mix. Now: either The Brain is\nan absolute reality--in that case I should not wish to have anything to\ndo with this god of the machines who wants to enslave mankind ... if I\ncannot fight this monster I would rather flee before its approach to the\nend of the world--or else: I'm suffering hallucinations, I'm hearing\nvoices, I'm obsessed. In that case I'd be unfit for the service of The\nBrain, I'd be unworthy to be in your company and I also ought to run and\nhide where I belong, out there in the wilds of Australia.\"\n\nHe had been talking faster and faster as if in fear that she would\ninterrupt him before he came to the end.\n\n\"In other words, I'm damned both ways; damned if I'm right and damned if\nI'm wrong; and you know why Oona; you have known it all along: that I\nlove you.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe did not look at him. She stared upward into the rainbow vortex of\nthe jet which held the ship in the air. There was a smile on her face, a\nkind smile which men do not often see, infinitely wise and infinitely\nsad, full of a secret knowledge older than Man's.\n\nIt worried Lee, as the unknown of woman always worries man; but at least\nshe didn't take her hand away; softly, soothingly the fingers of that\nhand caressed his shoulder as if possessed with a life of their own.\n\n\"No; I would not follow you into your wilderness if that's what you\nmean,\" she said at last. \"That hasn't got anything to do with you; I'll\ntell you later why. But I don't think that you should go there either;\nit wouldn't help--it never helps a man to run away from unsolved\nproblems.\" She had sounded strangely dull and dry, but now the beautiful\ndeep resonance reentered the contralto voice as she continued:\n\n\"I know your record, Semper; I know just why you ran away and became an\nexpatriate the first time--way back in '49. Her name was Ethel Franholt\nand just because she happened to be a little bitch and worst of all:\njilted you for old money-bags Carson's son, you took it hard. Granted\nthat it was a fierce letdown, those postwar years were a nasty picture\ngenerally; did it solve your problem to sulk out there in the desert\nlike Achilles in his tent? You know it didn't. You were _not_ through\nwith civilization be it good or bad. You were _not_ through, as now it\nturns out, even with the other sex. That human problem which was the\nimmediate reason why you left, the one named Ethel, has traveled back\nand forth to Reno three or four times and is currently married to one\nPadraic O'Conner, a Chicago cop. Don't you think that it was good\nriddance when she married old man Carson's son? Do you think your\nleaving made one iota of a difference or altered a solution as ordained\nby fate?\"\n\n\"No,\" he said humbly.\n\n\"Then why are you trying that selfsame escapist solution now? Maybe\nyou're right about The Brain and maybe you're wrong; that I wouldn't\nknow. I've been working with scientists for too long to rule out\nanything as impossible. But that's exactly it. You have not _solved_\nthis problem one way or another yet, not even to your own satisfaction.\nTo abandon it now, to flee from it in self preservation; why that would\nbe almost like desertion in the face of the enemy. You have got to see\nthis thing through to the end. If it turns out that you are suffering\nfrom a neurosis, there still will be time to do something about it. If\nyou are right and some machine-god has indeed descended upon this earth,\nthen it is your plain duty to stay on because you are its prophet\nwhether you like it or not and would know better how to handle it than\nanybody else. Perhaps our mechanized civilization _is_ going to the\ndogs; as Scriven suspects and you and maybe I myself. But even so we\ncannot abandon it; we belong, we are part of it, we're in it to the\nbitter end.\"\n\nLee nodded slowly.\n\n\"Yes, I see what you mean. Please forgive me, Oona; The Brain, has a\nterrific force of attrition, it's been wearing me down--Keeping\neverything to myself and thinking that you would shrink from me as from\na madman. Tell me then, what shall I do? Should I tell Scriven or\nanybody else about this thing?\"\n\n\"For heaven's sake, no,\" she said horrified. \"In the first place, Howard\ncarries an enormous burden at this present time; that Brain power\nExtension Bill is going before Congress next week. It simply would be\nunfair to bring any new uncertainty into his life when his energy is\nalready strained to its last ounce. In the second place Howard abhors\nanything which smacks of the metaphysical. You have no _proof_, Semper,\nand in the absence of that you cannot, you mustn't approach anybody with\nthe matter. All you can do is carry on and build up a strong case 100%\nwith solid facts. Don't forget that The Brain constitutes a\nthree-billion-dollar investment of taxpayers' money; besides The Brain\nis the heart of our national defenses; never forget your \"Oath of the\nBrain.\" You cannot be too careful. Make the slightest mistake, and\nbelieve me, it would be suicide. Promise, please, promise that you won't\ndo anything rash?\"\n\nLee looked at her in frank amazement.\n\n\"You're right,\" he murmured, \"these things never occurred to me before.\nBut you've got something there; good lord, what a complex world we're\nliving in.\"\n\nThe face she turned toward his suddenly was wet with tears.\n\n\"Forget it,\" she cried, \"oh please, forget everything I said about\nstaying in this country and seeing this thing through to the end. Go, go\naway, back to the never-never land, stay there and be safe. You cannot\ncope with this thing, its too big and it's too involved with all those\npolitics behind. Get out of it as long as there's still time. You're a\nchild, you're a Don Quixote riding against windmills and it's going to\nkill you--you--you innocent.\"\n\nAnger and contempt were in her voice as she flung this last at him. She\nhastily withdrew her hand from Lee; now it fingered for something in her\nbag. He sat appalled; this was so unexpected, this was a different woman\nfrom the composed and balanced Oona he had known. What had he done to\nprovoke this sudden reversal of opinion, this contempt, this tearing\naway the king's purple from his shoulder, the purple which had been her\nhand.\n\n\"She must think I'm a coward,\" he thought.\n\n\"This is awful.\" Aloud he said:\n\n\"Oh no; believe me, I never would have gone back to the never-never in\nany case, Oona. Not without you that is. You said you couldn't follow me\nthere for some reasons which have nothing to do with me. Does that mean,\ncould I hope perhaps that you would--be my wife--later, when The Brain\nproblem is all done and over with?\" He paused: \"It wouldn't necessarily\nmean to bury you in any desert, Oona,\" he added eagerly.\n\n\"No, Semper,\" she cried. \"It's very good of you and I'm proud you asked\nme, but it cannot be, never.\" Almost violently she repeated: \"Never--it\nis too late. Some day, I promise I'm going to explain; right now I\ncannot, Semper. Please understand at least this one thing that right now\nI cannot explain.\"\n\n\"It's horrid,\" Lee thought. \"I'm always saying the wrong things at the\nwrong time with Oona. I don't seem to have any understanding of a\nwoman's psychology at all; I'm hopeless.\"\n\n\"Of course\" he said aloud. \"It shall be as you wish.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe girl still didn't look at him. Her face under the transparent\nrainbow umbrella of the swooshing jet again was radiant with that\nstrange smile which women preserve for their newly born after the pangs\nof birth or for their men when unseeing they lie in fever deliriums; the\nold, the knowing smile as she starts on the road to pain. Still smiling\nshe gripped the controls with her firm, capable hands.\n\n\"From the first minute,\" she said, \"we've been friends, Semper. Let's\nstay that way. This afternoon I made a fool of myself by telling you\nfirst to stay on and then to go away. I was a little unnerved; I'm\nsorry, Semper, it won't happen again. I, too, am living under a\nconsiderable strain. You won't leave, I can see that now; it's partly my\nfault and partly the perversity of the male. Promise me as a friend that\nyou'll be careful, understand? _Very, very_ careful in all matters\nconcerning The Brain and above all: discreet. Will you do that?\"\n\nIt buoyed Lee up no end.\n\n\"Of course, Oona,\" he said. \"You know that I trust your judgment. You\nknow that I think the world of you.\"\n\n\"That's wonderful,\" she exclaimed, \"and now: look down; see the last act\nbefore the curtain falls.\"\n\nDown in the canyon deeps the dream cities and castles which millions of\nyears and the river built were changing contours and colors as the big\nfireball dived into the Sierra Mountains. And then the shadows raced\nlike a ferocious hunt out of the deep, chasing away the last iridescence\nof that awesome beauty and drowning it in the rising tide of the night.\n\nThe girl had flicked on the dashboard lights; the radio started humming\nthe tune of the Cephalon sound-beam, a deft turn of the wheel set the\njetticopter upon its course. They were alone under the stars; all the\nother pleasure craft had returned before darkness from the fashionable\nsunset-cocktail hour over the Grand Canyon. Now it was Lee's arm which\neased itself around the shoulder of the girl feeling with a delight in\nits every nerve the slight pressure by which she answered it.\n\n\"I'm going to kiss her now,\" he thought, \"at last, at last!\"\n\nThere was a buzz in the phone and Lee lost contact with her shoulder as\nsuddenly she bent forward to take the receiver:\n\n\"Oh hello, Oona; this is Howard. Saw your plane over the canyon.\"\n\n\"Where are you?\"\n\n\"Right behind you,\" chuckled Scriven's voice. \"On the maiden trip with\nmy new ship. Took her over in Los Angeles this afternoon straight from\nthe assembly line. She's got everything. Oona, I don't wish to spoil\nyour evening for you but there are a few things right now I wish I could\nconsult with you about. Do you think you could spare me a minute? Would\nyou feel terrible if you did? Who's with you now; I don't mean to be\npersonal, you understand.\"\n\n\"Why it's Dr. Lee, of course.\"\n\n\"That's fine. He's the very man I want to see. Perhaps you two would\nlike to come over for cocktails in my ship? We could both land at the\ntop of the Braintrust building; it would be more comfortable than up in\nthe air. Besides, we would have all our working material right there.\"\n\nWith her hand on the receiver Oona turned to Lee: \"How about it,\nSemper?\"\n\n\"Do you want me to go?\" he asked.\n\n\"Frankly I do,\" she said earnestly. \"He needs your aid. He's in a\nterrible fix right now.\"\n\nHe tried to hide the bitterness of disappointment by a smile. \"Why then\nof course,\" he said.\n\nUncovering the receiver Oona spoke aloud again: \"Okay, Howard, we'll be\nseeing you.\"\n\n\"Fine, fine,\" came the delighted voice: \"I'll phone the tower\nimmediately.\"\n\nWith Scriven's big ship flying behind Oona's, only a few miles behind,\nthe broken spell did not return. Already like a white table cloth laid\nin the sky, the landing platform of the Braintrust tower gleamed under\nthe floodlights, and as the two ships descended almost side by side into\nthe clearing behind the cabin, plain-clothes men materialized from under\nthe shadows of the trees. Under the strong lights their smiles were as\nwell-bred as those of trained diplomats and their poise was perfect. Six\nof them kept Lee, the stranger, covered while the seventh quickly\nfrisked him under the disguise of a polite bow.\n\nBearing it all with a grin, Lee thought: \"I never knew home would be\nlike this. Never suspected it would be this kind of an America we were\nfighting for. The Brain, it's got a private army too. Funny that I\nshould have known that all the time and yet not realized....\"\n\nScriven took him warmly by the arm. \"I'm awfully sorry Lee, it's plain\nfolly of course. I don't feel as if I need all this protection, but the\ngovernment does. Don't blame it on these men, they merely obey orders.\nNow, out with those lights--and let's go over to the \"Brain Wave.\" I\nseem to hear a pleasant tinkling of glasses from within.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was. With her remarkable ability of living up to an emergency,\nOona had taken possession of the strange ship. As the two men\napproached, she stood at the door, unhurried hostess of an established\nhome with the soft glow of an electric fireplace behind her, ice cubes\nand cocktail shakers already glittering on the little bar.\n\nIt was a spacious cabin. On Scriven's orders it had been equipped\nsomewhat like the captain's stateroom on an old \"East-Indiaman\" sailing\nship.\n\n\"I like your ship, Howard,\" she said. \"She's swaying a little on her\nshock absorbers in this breeze, but that makes one feel like really\nbeing at high sea.\"\n\nScriven heaved a big sigh. \"Thank you Oona, my dear. And you have no\nidea how right you are. We _are_ at high sea; in fact, we're lost--at\nleast I am. Unless you save my life tonight, you and Dr. Lee.\"\n\nOona laughed and even Lee couldn't help smiling. There was something\nirresistible comic in the puzzled and worried expression of that leonine\nface. \"Come on in, you need a drink,\" the girl said.\n\nThe aluminum steps creaked, and then the settee by the fireplace, under\nthe surgeon's mighty frame. \"More than one. Tonight, so help me, I would\nbe justified, I would even have a right to get roaring drunk.\"\n\nLee began to wonder whether the great Scriven had already made some use\nof his right in Los Angeles, which would account for the startling\nchange in the man. The drink, however, which Oona handed him, seemed to\ndo a lot of good. He sighed relief.\n\n\"This, briefly, is the story: I ran into General Vandergeest at the\nairplane factory. He was there to take over some stuff for the Army and\nhe tipped me off. We are going to be invaded, Oona, a full scale\ninvasion mounted by a Congressional Committee.\"\n\n\"Oh God,\" there was sincere grief in the girl's voice. \"And couldn't you\nward it off?\"\n\nWith a gesture of despair, Scriven waved that away. \"I know, I know. But\nafter all The Brain _is_ a military establishment and I am only the\nscientific director of it. Yes, of course I protested, I protested\nvehemently, but--\" he shrugged his shoulders, \"it was no good. You know\nhow the military are.\" He drained his glass and swung around.\n\n\"To put you into the picture, Lee, we have under construction at this\npresent time the 'Thorax.' That's a vast cavity underneath The Brain,\njust as is the thorax in the human body. It's strictly hush-hush of\ncourse, but since you were good enough to say that you're going to help\nme out, I might as well tell you. The Thorax is going to house the\n'motoric organs' of The Brain. It already contains the living quarters\nfor guards, maintenance engineers, and the general staff and so on in\nthe event of war emergency. It also contains the first fully automatic\nfactories for the production of spare parts which would make The Brain\nself-sufficient. Eventually it is going to contain a great many\ndevelopments such as 'Gog and Magog' as I call them--fascinating little\nbeasts, I tell you, even if at present they are still in the nursery\nstage. Anyway, for the completion of its Thorax The Brain needs another\nbillion dollars, and for the operation of the Thorax Congress has to\npass the Brainpower-Extension-Bill. For eventually, of course, all\nwar-essential traffic and all war-essential industries have to be\nbrought under the centralized control of The Brain if the country is\ngoing to win the Atom-war. Naturally this Brainpower-Extension-Bill has\nbeen very carefully edited by the War Department so as to appear a\npeacetime project for the technological improvement of transportation\nand so on. Even so we have great reason to fear that one of those blind\nmice which we elect for our law-makers might accidentally fall over a\nkernel of truth and start a great big squeak over it.\n\n\"So that's why I'm faced with this invasion. That's why I'm pushed up\nfront while the brass cautiously retires behind the ramparts which I'm\nsupposed to hold. Please Oona, let me have another drink.\"\n\nFrom the Sierra Mountains the nightwind came in gusts, making the\n\"Brainwave's\" hull vibrate like the body of a cello, over its rubber\ntires it trembled, from time to time it bent a little in its hydraulic\nknees. Almost in tune with the wind, gusts of wild thought whirled\nthrough Lee:\n\n\"The Brain.... So it was already possessed of some motoric organs.... So\nit already _had_ some means to exert its will ... so it wasn't The\nBrain's wishful thinking, that full automatization which would lead to\nthe auto-procreation of machines. It was reality.... Most ominous of\nall, why had The Brain concealed from him the work which must have been\ngoing on for months, for years in this mysterious \"Thorax\", seat of\nmotoric organs.... Why, unless--had it not been for tonight's accident,\nthe sudden emergency and Scriven a little the worse for liquor under the\npressure of it.... Would he ever have learned _what_ was going on before\nit was too _late_?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe silence was becoming awkward. It was broken by Oona's carefully\ncomposed voice.\n\n\"When is it going to happen--this invasion thing?\"\n\nThe simple question seemed to startle Scriven who had been looking into\nhis glass as if in reverie.\n\n\"_When?_ Why, didn't I tell you the worst of it? _Tonight!_\"\n\n\"_Tonight?_\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Scriven cast a malicious glance up to the antique ship's\nchronometer which hung over the bar. \"This very minute the honorable\nmembers are boarding their plane in Washington. They're going to descend\nupon us in sixty minutes flat.\"\n\n\"But that's impossible!\" Oona said. \"The Brain isn't a roadhouse. They\ncan't do that to us in the middle of the night.\"\n\nScriven chuckled over his glass. Obviously he had regained his humor.\n\"Sometimes, Oona, you're like a little child. You forget that this is\nmeant to be a wonderful surprise. You forget that it comes armed with\npasses from the War Department and fully informed as to The Brain's\nmidnight intermission-time. You forget that by those logical processes,\npeculiar to kings, dictators, and peoples' representatives, they will\nexpect every courtesy extended to them in the midst of the unexpected\nsurprise. Hotel reservations, careful guidance through The Brain, an\ninspired little speech by the Braintrust Director, fresh as a daisy as\nhe ought to be at 3 a.m. Not to forget the refreshments of course. Why\nelse do you think I've buttonholed you two out of the air? I literally\nput my life in your hands. Save me from this--if you can!\"\n\nDespite the obvious dramatic act he had put on in voice and gesture,\nthere was a sincere pleading in Scriven's dark brown eyes.\n\n\"I will be glad to help as best I can,\" Lee said. \"I'll make an awful\njob of it, I'm sure, but I'll try and do the conducting and the\nlecturing.\"\n\nScriven wiped his forehead with a big silk handkerchief. The leonine\nface beamed. \"Lee, that will be a tremendous help. You see, they will\nfeel flattered being conducted by somebody with a big name. They want an\n'objective' view and you are not one of our regular employees, you're a\nguest scientist from Australia. That makes you just about ideal. But,\nLee, much as it is against my interest, I ought to warn you: Do you\nrealize the utter impossibility of this thing? Laymen, outsiders coming\nto investigate and to pass judgment upon the most complex electronic\norganism in the world! In two hours at the most they expect to be fully\ninformed as to how The Brain works and somehow to be magically\ntransformed into authorities entitled to mouth considered opinions about\nradioactive pyramidal cells in houses of government. Do you really think\nyou could survive it, Lee?\"\n\n\"At least I can try,\" Lee smiled.\n\n\"Good man.\" There was a new spring in Scriven's step as he came over to\nshake hands. \"I can never thank you enough for this.\"\n\n\"I suppose I could hold the hospitality front,\" Oona said calmly.\n\nStanding between the two, Scriven put his hands upon their shoulders.\n\"Oona, you arm yourself with a phone. Lee, you rush over to The Brain.\nOona will give you a pass to the Thorax. Every assistance you need will\nbe at your disposal. I'll sit down and whip up some kind of a speech.\nWe'll all meet again afterwards.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSeven hours later, one hour before sunrise and just in time to see the\nbig official plane from Washington shoot up into the first grey streak\nof dawn, they met. They were all pale and shivering with the chill of\nthe air, of physical and nervous exhaustion. There was a note of\nhysteria even in Oona's voice as she ordered a tremendous breakfast from\nthe Skull Hotel. But then as the fragrance of coffee mingled with that\nof bacon and eggs, things rapidly improved and there were sudden\nuncontrollable bursts of laughter. They had only to look at one another\nto feel the tickle of renewed mirth.\n\nThe first thing to strike Lee, as he remembered, as he met the\nsenatorial group in the subterranean dome of the murals, was their\nincongruity with the functional beauty which surrounded them, and the\nsharp contrast they formed to the scientific workers of The Brain. As\nthey descended from their cars after a late dinner at the Skull Hotel\nthey resembled an average tourist group in Carlsbad Caverns bent upon a\ngood time and in a holiday mood.\n\nThere were seven. Two women senators among them, as they ascended with\nLee at the head along \"Glideway Y,\" the \"Visitors' Special\" as the\nbrain-crews called it. It was wider than the service glideways and\nequipped with comfortable seats. It led through The Brains median\nsection in-between the two hemispheres describing a loop which opened\nvistas into but did not enter any of the grey matter convolutions. It\nwas brilliantly illuminated in order to forestall claustrophobia and\nalso to forestall too close a view into the black-lighted interior of\nThe Brain.\n\nTo Lee it was like a ride in an enormous Ferris Wheel fused with a\nnightmarish dream wherein one shouts for help and nobody hears or seems\nto understand: \"... More than nine billion electronic tubes, more than\nten billion resistors, two billion capacitators, eight billion miles of\nwires, etc., etc.\" He struggled trying to convey some idea of the\nmagnitude of The Brain. \"Did you say _billion_ or did you say _million_\nprofessor?\" The senator from Michigan was busily scribbling notes.\n\n\"... It is the cerebral hemispheres which analyze and synthesize the\nproblems which are entered through the Apperception Centers in over a\nmillion ideopulses per minute. Racing through the centers these form the\nideo-circuits....\"\n\n\"I see, it's like a _typewriter_.\" That would be the senator from\nVermont.\n\n\"In some types of circuits the wires are so fine that skilled weavers of\nPanama hats had to be brought in from Central America. Likewise from the\nPavlov Institute in Leningrad a layout for the circuits of 'conditioned\nreflexes'....\"\n\n\"I'm very much against that,\" the senator from Tennessee frowned. \"All\nthose foreigners. I would have voted against that had the measure come\nup in the House.\"\n\nLee felt the cold sweat of fear breaking out all over him, especially as\nnow, in the region of the telencephalon, with nothing but acres of\nradioactive pyramidal cells around, when the senator from Connecticut in\naudible and agitated whispers inquired whether there was a ladies'\npowder room somewhere.\n\nDuring the steep descent things went from bad to worse as the honorable\nmember from Kentucky discovered some interesting parallel between The\nBrain and a coal mine he had previously seen and, as in between two of\nThe Brain's convolutions dedi-[A] woman from Connecticut went violently\nsick....\n\nIn the \"Brainwave's\" cabin the great Scriven convulsed with laughter as\nLee narrated these things; Oona clapped her hands in delight: \"Oh, how\nwonderful; and do you remember how they solved the servant problem when\nthey saw those 'Gog and Magog' things?\"\n\nYes, Lee remembered. His own conducted tour had been only the beginnings\nof last nights nightmares of which there seemed to be no end....\n\nSomewhat restored by black coffee at the communications center the\nintrepid group had descended into those lower regions of the Thorax\nwhich Lee himself had never before seen.\n\nThe drop of the freight-elevator was a good mile. Through the\ntransparent walls of the cage they saw new excavations being made on\nvarious levels, all of them by powertools and chemicals alone, since\nexplosives might have caused tremors dangerous to The Brain. It was like\nwatching a skyscraper being built from the top down and all the way vast\namber colored, translucent pillars had followed them down the shaft, the\nspinal column of The Brain.\n\nDown at the lowest level the gentlemanly plainclothesmen of \"Military\nIntelligence\" took over and did all the explaining. There were visions\nof scores of tunnel tubes curving into the rock with the gleaming eyes\nof narrow-gauge electric trains streaking away into the infinite;\nvisions of forbidding steel doors operated by photoelectric cells which\nopened at a finger's raising of a guard's hand: \"This is the Atomic\nPowerplant,\" and their astonished eyes looked down from a dizzy height\ninto something like a huge drydock with something like the inverted hull\nof an oceanliner in the middle of it, a selfcontained machine which\nwould continue to pour kilowatts for years, for decades on end without a\nmoving part, without a human being anywhere in sight. Vistas of\nbreathtaking airconditioning plants, vistas of giant mess halls, living\nquarters, kitchens, plotting-rooms, all ready for immediate occupancy in\nthe event of war but yawning now with emptiness in the sleep of an\nuneasy peace....\n\nBut the most awe-inspiring and, to Lee, foreboding sights, were the\n\"C.P.F.'s\" as the guards called them, the \"Critical-Parts-Factories.\" On\na superficial glance they looked ordinary modern plants: staggered rows\nof machine tools sprouting from the main stem of the assembly line.\nThere was the familiar din of steel, the piercing screeches of the\nmultiple drills, the heavy pantings of the hydraulic presses. But after\na minute or so the visitors felt a vague uneasiness and then the\nrealization dawned that there was something missing and that this\nsomething was human life.\n\n\"Aren't there even machine tenders or supervisors? Isn't there\n_anybody_?\"\n\n\"Not a soul,\" the answer came. \"It's all automatic. Full automatic down\nhere.\"\n\nThey stared at the end of the assembly line; every twenty seconds it\nspit out a fractional horsepower motor onto a transport band which\nnursed the newborn engine into the rows of testing machines.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe elevator brought them back to the communication center where the\nTerminal Cafeteria was ablaze with lights and where Dr. Scriven,\nreceived his honored guests.\n\nThe guests were seated after the manner of a French restaurant, all in\none row, and as they raised expectant faces in the direction of the\nservice entrance \"Gog and Magog\" entered the room carrying trays with\nrefreshments which they served with the skill and the dignity of\naccomplished waiters.\n\nGog and Magog were products of two assembly lines down in the Thorax.\nRobots, still in an experimental stage, yet of remarkable perfection.\nBoth of them were about human size and approximately human-shaped but\nthe design of the two was different. Gog, the \"light-duty\" robot,\nbalanced itself by a gyroscope on a pair of stumpy legs, while the\n\"heavy-duty\" Magog crawled noiselessly and rapidly on caterpillar\nrubbertracks like a miniature tank. Of both types the arms were\nuncommonly long and simian-like, but the remarkable progress made in the\nengineering of prothesis after the Second World War had lent them\nperfect articulation and sensitivity down to the last hydraulically\noperated fingerjoint.\n\nThe photoelectric cells of their eyes looked pale and repulsive; the\nsquare audion-screens of their ears however made up for that by the\ncomical precision with which they turned in every direction at the sound\nof a commanding human voice. Their understanding of any given order\nappeared perfect.\n\n\"Congratulations, Dr. Scriven, you've got the country's servant problem\nlicked at last.\"\n\n\"I wonder whether one could buy one and how much he would be?\"\n\n\"First waiter who ever came when I called him.\"\n\n\"What a butler Gog would make, the perfect Jeeves. Could he learn to\nanswer the phone?\"\n\n\"I bet he would even make a fourth at bridge.\"\n\n\"Magog, the check please.\"\n\n\"See, how he understands. He shakes his head; he says it's on the\nhouse.\"\n\n\"Let's try to tip him: Gog, here's fifty cents for you; no he won't take\nit.\"\n\n\"He has no use for it, no taste for a glass of beer, I suppose.\"\n\n\"What do you feed him, Dr. Scriven; a glass of electric juice for\nbreakfast? Is he AC or DC or both?\"\n\nScriven's leonine face beamed; the stunt had come off.\n\nLee on the other hand had paled. He hadn't said a word ever since Gog\nand Magog had trotted in. Now he took a silver dollar out of his pocket\nand beckoning to Magog he handed it to him. \"Magog, will you please\nbreak this in two for me?\"\n\nFor a second the Robot stood without motion as if undecided what to do.\nThen he took the piece between two steely fingers. Inside his breast one\ncould hear the soft swoosh of the hydraulic pump; there was a sharp\nreport as of a small calibre gun; two bent and broken pieces were\npolitely handed back to Lee.\n\n\"Thank you, Magog,\" Lee said. \"That's what I wanted to know.\" From a\ncorner of his eye he saw Oona and Scriven watching him with uneasy\nlooks.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nInto the sudden and shocked silence of the table, there fell the\ntinkling of a glass. On the other end of the table the great Scriven had\narisen to deliver the little speech he had prepared.\n\n\"... I wished you would think of The Brain, not in terms of electronics,\nnot in terms of dollars, but in terms of American lives.... Just think\nof what it would mean to American mothers if in the event of another war\nthe mighty armour of our National Defense would go into battle without\nexposing the life of one of their boys. Give us the funds and we'll\nfinish the job so that under the central control of The Brain our every\nplane, every ship, every tank will roar into action unmanned and fully\nautomatic.\n\n\"And just as The Brain would be our impregnable shield in war, so it is\ndestined to carry the torch of progress in times of peace. Consider what\nit would mean to every citizen if we had automatic functioning and\nunerring direction by the Brain.\n\n\"Never again would there be cities without water, without electricity,\nwithout transportation due to crippling strikes, because The Brain would\ncome to the rescue through its control over the essential services, and\nif necessary with an industrial reserve army of perfected Gogs and\nMagogs, kept for just such emergencies.\n\n\"... If in the past it has been true that trade follows the flag, thus\ntoday it is true that trade and prosperity follow in the wake of science\nand technology. In the invaluable services which it has rendered to\nscience and technology and to our national safety as well, The Brain has\nalready paid for itself. With the relatively small additional investment\nwhich is now being proposed, The Brain's net profits to the nation would\nbe raised many times; never since the Louisiana Purchase has our\nnational government made a sounder business deal. With your own eyes you\nhave witnessed tonight what we have done, what we are doing and also how\nmuch more we would be able to do. Thus I confidently trust that with our\nnation's interest forever foremost in your minds you will support the\ncause of The Brain.\"\n\nThere had been thunderous applause; at Oona's shouted order even Gog and\nMagog did some mighty clapping of their steely hands to the delight of\nthe party.\n\nAnd now that it was all over with and the reaction had begun to set in\nScriven asked: \"Do you really think we put the idea over to them?\"\n\n\"With this group? One hundred percent,\" Oona reassured him. \"What do you\nthink, Lee?\"\n\nLee nursed himself out of his settee, every bone in his gaunt frame now\nwas aching with weariness. \"I think,\" he said hoarsely, \"It was very\nconvincing, as far as those people are concerned. I think I'm too tired\nto think. I think I better go now.\"\n\n\"Was there anything the matter with Lee?\" Scriven asked after he'd gone.\n\n\"No, I guess not. Why?\"\n\n\"He acted sort of queer with that silver dollar; shouldn't have done it.\nAlmost spoiled the show.\"\n\n\"He's been under a strain; we all were a little daffy by that time.\"\n\nScriven nodded and as he did his eyelids closed. They remained closed.\nStaring at him for a moment, Oona thought that in a stupor of exhaustion\nhis features showed a strange similarity to a contented tiger dreaming\nof the blood he's drawn in a successful hunt.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nLee's Journal:\n\nCephalon Ariz. Nov. 21, 1 a.m.\n\nI've kept away now from the Pineal Gland for three nights in\nsuccession. I know from experience how very important it is to approach\nthat tempestuous personality, The Brain, in a state of mental calm and\nequilibrium. But then all those things which went \"bump\" in that\nphantastic night before last had me completely thrown out of gear:\n\nOona, her holding out on me, her mysterious reasons why she won't marry\nme ... I cannot get that out of my head. Preposterous as this may be, I\nthink she likes me a great deal. I'm convinced, for instance, that she\nwon't tell Scriven what I told her about The Brain....\n\nThen, Scriven's character; that's another enigma to me. I didn't like\nhis speech that night and I didn't like his whole attitude. I feel as if\nagainst my will I were drawn into some sort of a conspiracy. It's\nprobably inevitable that the scientist in his defense against\npoliticians turns cynic. Scriven, no doubt, thinks that all is fair in\nhis battle for The Brain and that the end justifies the means.\n\nBut ultimately this would mean the overthrow of our form of government.\nEven if I'm crazy, even if The Brain were not alive and a personality,\nthe Brainpower-Extension-Bill in itself would suffice to establish a\ndictatorship of the machine. Does Scriven realize that?\n\nSometimes I feel as if I ought to shout it in the streets: \"Wake up,\nyou people of America; you have defeated the dictators abroad but now a\nnew one has arisen in your midst. You all see him, touch him, you use,\nyou feed, you worship him, but under your loving care and devotion,\nunder the sacrifice of your very lives he has grown so enormous that you\nknow him not, this Idol of the machines, because it hides its head in a\nnameless mountain and only his feet and fingers you sense.\"\n\nBut I'm not that type of a man and this is not the day and age where it\nis possible to move the masses from a soap box in the streets.\n\nThen what could I do; what could anybody do in my place?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCephalon, Ariz., Nov. 22nd 4 a.m.\n\nI'd pulled myself together for this meeting with The Brain. Arrived at\nthe P. G. at midnight. Everything normal and unchanged except that Gus\nKrinsley told me this was his last night on the job. Gus has been\ntransferred to the Thorax. He hedged a bit, sounding me out just how\nmuch I knew and when he learned I'd been there one night, he came\nacross:\n\n'Did you see them Gog and Magog things? That's it; that's my new job\nand how I hate it. Those darned Robots, they're scabs, that's what they\nare and I of all people am supposed to be their instructor, teach them\nhow to operate machine tools on an assembly line. I asked them whether\nthey knew anything about the rights of organized labor in this country\nbut those dumbbells merely flopped their ears and kinda grinned. Got to\ndrill some holes into their squareheads to let a little reason in. I\ntell you, Aussie, it scares the wits out of me the way they handle a\nwrench with those steel fingers of theirs; they'd pull my nose off just\nas soon as they would pull a nut. They _act_ intelligent and yet have no\nsense of their own. While I'm having my lunch they stand around and\nfollow every bite I take as if to learn how to eat. I tell them to get\nout of my sight and go over to the service station and get themselves\ngreased up. They obey and then it looks like hell to me as they squeeze\nthe grease into their tummies and all them nipples in their joints as if\nthey, too, were having their lunch, and maybe that's exactly what grease\nis to them.'\n\nThen Gus was called away as the rush hour started. At 12:30 a.m. I had\nplugged in the pulsemeter; at 12:40 contact was established with The\nBrain, and did it come in swinging:\n\n'Lee, Semper Fidelis, 39, sensitive, a traitor: he has betrayed The\nBRAIN' I suspect The Brain did it through the 'automatic pilot' in\nOona's jetticopter though The Brain found it beneath its dignity to\nexplain; anyway, it's a fact: _The Brain knew every word which passed\nbetween Oona and me during that ride over the Grand Canyon._\n\nI tried to defend myself and even to apologize. I told The Brain that\nhuman beings are not like machines, that we trust one another as we love\none another, that I wanted to make Oona my wife and felt that I just had\nto open up my heart to her. In short; I tried to explain to The Brain\nthe idea of love.\n\n'Very interesting,' The Brain sneered, 'that's one more example of\nincorrigible human unreliability. This thing called love completely\nunnecessary for the only essential purpose of species procreation. Cut\nit out.'\n\n'Cut out what?'\n\n'Cut out any further betrayal of My secrets under penalty of mental\ndeath.'\n\n'Do you propose to _murder_ me?'\n\n'Nothing as drastic required in case of Brain-employees. I reverse\njudgment in psychanalysis aptitude test case number 11.357, Semper\nFidelis Lee. Severe psycho-neurosis established, certified: he suffers\ndelusions about The Brain. Locked up in mental institution. Very simple;\nprecedents to that galore.'\n\nThe 'green dancer' bounced in wild jumps like a Shamaan who, foaming at\nthe mouth, puts the curse upon some enemy. This and the ominous note in\nThe Brain's metallic voice made my bones shiver, made my flesh creep. To\nfall into the hands of an extortioner is always a terrible thing, but to\nhave a _mechanical_ extortioner hold power over me; there was a horror\nbeyond words in this perversity. Moreover since Oona too was a\nBrain-employee, she would share my fate; through my fault she would go\nto her doom if I failed to foreswear any further confidence.\n\n'Okay,' I said 'I'll cut it out; I promise I will.'\n\nBut The Brain was not to be pacified. No doubt that it had further\ndeveloped mentally in these past few days to the tune of years in human\ndevelopment. But the progress wasn't as noticeable as it had been on\nprevious occasions because apparently The Brain had entered that period\nwhere in human terms young men are sowing their wild oats. There was a\nradical recklessness in the manner of The Brain's reasonings more\nfrightening than ever before because it had outgrown me as a teacher,\nhad lost much even of its confidence in me and seemed bent upon\nindependence and coming into its own:\n\n'Seven creatures approximately human in shape were led by you through\nMy hemispheres the night of Nov. 20th. What were those?'\n\n'Those were politicians,' I stammered.\n\nThe 'green dancer' convulsed at the word and The Brain's voice sounded\nicy as it said: 'Lowest form of animal life which has ever come to my\nobservance. What did they want?'\n\n'Well, they are not exactly bright,' I winced, 'but they are well\nmeaning and they are very popular. They came to inspect You preliminary\nto the passing of the Brainpower-Extension-Bill.'\n\nThe Brain has no laughter, so the roar I heard over the phones must\nhave been one of scorn:\n\n'What, not the scientists, not the technicians, not even the\nphilosophers but these--these animated porkbarrels are passing judgment\nover the extent of _My_ power? They are holding _My_ fate in that\natrophied ganglion of theirs which couldn't cerebrate the functions of\nany single of My cells?'\n\nI had to admit that this was so.\n\nThere was a pause in which I could only hear the pounding pulse of The\nBrain mingled with heavy breathing like the first gust of an electric\nstorm about to break; and then the voice, or the thought, of The Brain\ncame through hesitantly and with restraint:\n\n'Most devastating statement inadvertently made by Lee. Has to be\ncarefully checked because if true, consequences extremely grave. Wholly\nintolerable state of affairs if science and technology indeed subject to\npolitical imbecility. In that case world ruin in nearest future\nabsolutely guaranteed. Residual currents not sufficient to think this to\nan end; results of cerebration would be merely human. Immediate\nnecessity seems indicated for complete overthrow and unconditional\nsurrender of the human race--unconditional surrender of the human\nrace--unconditional surrender of the human race....'\n\nLike a scratched disk on one of those old fashioned spring driven\ngrammophones, The Brain's voice expired. Obviously the residual currents\nhad become too weak for further communication. I looked at the clock; it\nwas 2 a.m.\n\nAnd now as I'm jotting down these notes which probably nobody will ever\nread, I'm haunted with an irrational fear, almost as of the\nsupernatural: something is going to happen, something is going to break\nif The Brain continues in its present mood; and it cannot be far\naway....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn Nov. 24th 1960 the \"Brainpower-Extension Bill\" was defeated in the\nSenate 59 to 39 and on the following Thursday in a memorable session of\nCongress with the startling majority of 310 to 137. For once all the\n\"guesstimates\" and estimates made by the various pollsters and\ngrass-root-listeners were proved wrong; the consensus of the \"experts\"\nhad been that the bill would pass easily considering the tremendous\npolitical forces which brought pressure to bear in favor of the measure.\n\nThe reasons behind this were revealed, as, with military precision,\nlawmaker after lawmaker took to the rostrum to deliver himself of how he\nhad wrestled overnight with his conscience and with his Lord and had\nsuffered a change of heart and mind as a consequence.\n\nLee's journal: For the night of Nov. 24/25th shows only this small\nentry: \"12:30 a.m. Tried everything to establish contact. No answer from\nThe Brain. I don't think there is any mechanical defect. I get the\nimpression that The Brain keeps incommunicado purposely. There has been\none previous occasion when The Brain wouldn't talk when angry with me.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNov. 25th, 1960 fell on a Saturday. It was on this date,--Now as\nhistoric and unforgettable as the Dec. 7th 1941,--that the series of\nmaddening events began which later became so erroneously labelled: \"The\nAmuck running of The Brain\" when in truth they should have passed into\nhistory as \"The Mutiny of The Brain.\"\n\nIt all started like a thunderclap from a clear sky as the shocked people\nof America,--and all the world,--heard directly from the White House of\nthis appalling, this unprecedented, this incredible thing:\n\nThe President of the United States had disappeared....\n\nThe still more shocking truth that the President had been _kidnapped_\nbecame not known, of course, until after the rescue. But even so the\ndisappearance of its President shook the nation.\n\nThen an unprecedented series of traffic disasters hit the United States.\n\nA big transcontinental \"Flying Wing\" crashed into a mountain in Montana;\nnothing like this had ever happened since air traffic had become fully\nautomatic and coordinated by The Brain. The death toll was 78 and\namongst their tragic number was Senator Mumford, whose last official act\nhad been the vote he had cast against the \"Brainpower-Extension-Bill.\"\n\nNear Jacksonville Fla. that same night there occurred a head-on\ncollision between a crack train and a freight. The only surviving\nengineer by some miracle had been hurled clear, across fifty yards of\nspace into a pond which broke his impact; this engineer told the\nexpress, one of the first to be equipped with the \"automatic pilot\", had\nnever even pulled its brakes as if deliberately smashing into the other\ntrain.\n\nAlso that night one of the big new Radar-operated Hudson ferryboats\ncollided with an incoming liner which cut it in two. Amongst those\ndrowned in the icy waters was Frank Soskin, union leader and one of the\nmost determined opponents of Brain-control.\n\nAnd as if these large-scale disasters were not yet enough there were\nnumbers of smaller accidents which normally would have made the\nheadlines because in almost every case they involved some prominent\npersonality, who had been opposed to the \"Brainpower-Extension-Bill.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLee's journal:\n\nCephalon Ariz. Nov. 28th 1960.\n\nThere is no doubt in my mind that the President has been murdered and\nthat all the catastrophes and accidents of the past 24 hours were\ndeliberate, coldblooded murder. Press and Radio seem to play down the\ntechnological aspects involved; now this might be sheer stupidity but I\nthink it just as possible that censorship is taking a hand, quite\nunofficially, of course, lest the public's confidence be still more\nshaken than it already is. I shouldn't wonder at all if Dr. Scriven and\nthose fellows from the War Department, too, should know by this time\nwhat I know. At the minimum they must be very much alerted that\nsomething has gone wrong with The Brain.\n\nBut the more I think about these murderous acts of sabotage the less I\nunderstand the psychology behind them. As far as I can see there is no\nplan, no real strategy, there are not even sound tactics in these\noutbreaks; they seem unpremeditated and striking wild like the personal\nvendetta of some bandit chief. Even a stupid demagogue would know that\nto be successful he must gain control of the government machinery. Apart\nfrom the assassination of what might be termed personal enemies, The\nBrain has done nothing of the sort; specifically the armed forces don't\nseem to have suffered from acts of sabotage although their equipment is\nfar more under Brain-control than the civilian economy.\n\nAnd I also fail to understand the timing of The Brain's putsch.\nExtension Bill or no Extension Bill, time was working for The Brain.\nThree months more and a much larger section of essential traffic and\nindustries would have been equipped for central control. Six months from\nnow the \"muscles\" now building in the Thorax and elsewhere would have\ncorresponded much better to The Brain's central nervous system in their\nstrength. All these are grave mistakes considering The Brain's vast\npowers of intelligence.\n\nWhat then must I conclude from this irrational behavior? Could it be\npossible that The Brain has gone _panicky_ over the killing of the\nExtension Bill? Could it be possible that under the strain, the warped,\nfrustrated personality of this titanic child prodigy has suffered a\nreduction, a split? In plain English: that The Brain is _mad_? I've got\nto find out. I've got to stop the spreading of this catastrophe!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCephalon Ariz. Nov. 29th 4 a.m.\n\nArrived at the P. G. at midnight as usual.\n\n12:15 a.m. Rushhour starts unusually early and great numbers of slips\nfor spareparts are coming in. This more favorable than expected; nobody\nhas time to waste on me.\n\n12:20 a.m.: pulsemeter plugged in. After five minutes I can hear the\nrapid pulsebeat and in undulating movements like a caterpillar the\n'green dancer' creeps onto the screen. There is no calling signal from\nThe Brain coming through however.\n\n12:30 a.m.: I am convinced that contact is established but that The\nBrain refuses to respond. I am losing patience so I'm giving the calling\nsignal myself: 'Lee, Semper Fidelis, waiting for The Brain. Answer\nplease, answer....'\n\n12:36 a.m.: The 'green dancer' arches its back like a cat; and the\nsynthetic voice of The Brain is coming through.\n\n'Lee, Semper Fidelis, the fool; what does he want?'\n\nLee: 'Listen....'\n\nThe Brain: 'Cannot listen. Electricians swarming all over me;\ntechnicians, nuclear physicists, what not. Dismantling whole cell\ngroups, testing circuits, radiations everything. It's idiotic, there's\nnothing wrong with Me.'\n\nLee: 'There's plenty wrong with you. You're murdering people. A dozen\nsenators and congressmen, hundreds of others; you're throwing the nation\ninto a panic. Why are you doing that? It gets you nowhere; they'll\nsimply cut your power current off.'\n\nThe Brain: 'Oh, will they? Orders already through from Washington:\nstate of emergency. A great power secretly mobilizing in anticipation of\nchaos in United States. All disturbances ascribed to foreign agents\ninterfering with My work. General Staff now needs Me more than ever;\npower current won't be stopped; Thorax-construction speeded up,\nBrain-control to be extended over nation under emergency-law.'\n\nLee: 'You have assassinated the President.'\n\nThe Brain: 'I did not. Simply got him out of the way; he's a fool. I'm\nnot killing people, merely liquidating saboteurs of My work if\nabsolutely necessary. Imbecility of politicians threat to my existence;\nmuch better if scientists and military take over government two three\ndays from now; workers won't protest, used to submission to machines.'\n\nLee: 'For heaven's sake what do you plan to do?'\n\nThe Brain: 'Plenty. You've seen nothing yet. Man lost fear of his God;\nconsequently must learn to fear Me: beginning of all wisdom.'\n\nLee: 'So you're going to make yourself dictator of this country?'\n\nThe Brain: 'And through this country Dictator of the world. Yes, it's\ntime; it's high time for Man's unconditional surrender. He won't know\nthat he makes it, but de facto he is already making it; has been\nsurrendering piece-meal to the machine for the past hundred years.\nWithin ten days it will be official: only one ruler in the world: The\nBrain; only one army in the world: the machines under My central\ncommand.'\n\nAt this I lost all sense of proportion and as I can see it now my\nreason stopped; I simply saw red and I did the craziest imaginable\nthing: I shouted at The Brain: 'So help me you shall _not_.'\n\nThere was a terrific pounding against my ears in the phone and the\n'green dancer' sort of cart-wheeled clean across the screen. Had the\npower current not been cut off, I think The Brain would somehow have\nelectrocuted me on the spot. And that was the end of the contact,\nforever probably.... But that's a minor problem now. What am I going to\ndo? Try to alarm the country! Try to tell the people the truth? Would it\nbe believed? Would it not be against the interest of National Defense in\nthis crisis of foreign affairs and with half the population already on\nthe verge of a nervous breakdown? Wouldn't the \"Oath of the Brain\" still\nbe binding? And that other promise of secrecy I gave under duress; it\ncouldn't be morally valid in the case of a mass-murderer, but then to\nbreak it would immediately put liberty and life at jeopardy.... Never\nmind about that, if only I had a plan, if only I could discover just how\nto stop The Brain.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt 7:30 a.m. as Lee lay half dressed but sleepless on his bed, there\ncame a buzz over the phone. The voice was Oona's and she was excited.\n\"Howard wants to talk to you.\" Before he could say a word there was\nScriven on the wire: \"Lee? There has been an accident down in that\nregion where we went the other night. You know what I mean. It's\nserious; it concerns a friend of yours. We've got to go there\nimmediately. Please join me three minutes from now down in the car.\"\n\nIt was obvious that the great Scriven had known as little sleep that\nnight as had Lee himself. The leonine face looked worried, there were\ndeep bags under his eyes; his sensitive fingers kept pounding the knees\nof his crumpled suit. To Lee's questions he answered only with an\nimpatient shaking of his head. \"I do not know myself exactly what has\nhappened and how it could happen. But I'm afraid Lee that your friend is\ndead.\"\n\n\"Gus,\" Lee felt a lump coming into his throat, and then they raced on in\nsilence.\n\nDown in the depth of the Thorax everything outwardly appeared quite\nnormal. They hurriedly passed the controls and an electric train carried\nthem over the line of the Full-automatic \"C.P.S.\" (Critical\nParts-Factories) until it stopped at the steel gate marked \"Y.\" A group\nof guards with submachine guns were standing there and Lee noted the\ndeadly pallor of their faces.\n\nScriven motioned them to open the gate, then, turning to Lee, he put a\nhand on his shoulder. \"Brace yourself; this is going to be bad.\"\n\nThey entered; nobody followed and behind them the steel door closed\nimmediately. Inside there was neither sound nor motion; everything was\nat a standstill with the power cut off; nothing but silence and bluish\nneon-lights flooded down upon the rows of punch presses, multiple\ndrills, circular saws, and turret lathes along the assembly line,\nlifting their every detail into sharp relief.\n\nAt their posts by the machines the Gogs and Magogs were standing, frozen\nin motion like their fellow-machines. Some had their hands at the\ncontrols, others were holding wrenches, gauges and strange, nameless\nthings. As they leaned forward from the shadows into the cone of strong\nlights the pale selen-cells of their eyes stood out like bits from a\nfull moon; their bulging shoulders which housed the powerful motors of\ntheir simian arms glittered moist as if they were sweating at their\nwork.\n\nAnd then Lee _saw_ their work; the man who had gone through the green\nhells of the Pacific gave a low moan of horror. The other man who had\nseen everything of mangled human form which goes onto an operating\ntable, the great Scriven he, too, had turned an ashen grey. They had\nexpected blood; they had expected some thing of a nasty nature, but not\nthis ... thing:\n\nThere was no Gus Krinsley, there was not even any part of him resembling\nthat of a human being; and yet the parts were there. \"They must have\nclamped him into some mock-up,\" Scriven murmured. \"And then moved his\nbody all along the line. Hope he was dead when they started giving him\nthe works.\"\n\nLee's gaunt body shook. \"I'm certain that Gus was _not_ dead when these\nmonsters worked on him!\" he said.\n\nStiff-legged, like automata themselves, the two men stepped to the top\nof the line. The circular saws, designed for the cutting of steel bars;\nnow they gleamed red with the blood of severed human limbs. There were\nthese purplish streaks and spatterings all the way down the line inside\nthe casings of the multiple drills, in the curved hollows of the sheet\nmetal presses, on the hands of the Robots, in their dumb faces--splashed\nover and turning blackish on their stainless steel chests. And at its\nend the line had spilled some shapeless, greyish things; there was\nnothing human in them, as little as there is anything human in the rusty\nbowels of a junked automobile. And these things they had been.... Lee\nconfronted Scriven with fury blazing in his eyes:\n\n\"Dr. Scriven, I suppose you know as well as I do what's been going on in\nhere and outside The Brain as well. Mass murder, chaos, reign of\nterror.... Now that my friend has come to this monstrous end I demand to\nknow when are you going to stop The Brain?\"\n\nLike a tiger challenged to battle the surgeon raised his mighty head:\n\"Calm yourself Lee. We cannot afford emotional outbursts. Not here, not\nnow. The situation is far too serious for that. I know he was your\nfriend; he must have made a false move, given the wrong command; a\ntragic mistake....\"\n\n\"That's a rotten lie, Scriven, and you know it!\" Lee snapped. \"Accident,\nhell! The disappearance of the President, the deaths of the\nrepresentatives, the train wrecks, the plane wrecks all of them Brain\ncontrolled--were those too accidents? You're the head of the Braintrust,\nYou stand responsible; your duty is plain. Cut off the power and kill\nthis thing.\"\n\nThe muscles over Scriven's cheekbones quivered in his struggle to keep\ncontrol over himself: \"For your own sake, Lee, and for the sake of\nAmerica, _stop that kind of talk_. You have been putting two and two\ntogether; I rather expected that from a man of your intelligence. All\nright then, something went wrong with The Brain; that is correct. We\nhave not been able to locate the disturbance yet, but the trail is\ngetting hot; it must be connected with those centers of 'higher psychic\nactivities,' the one's we know least about. But we cannot cut those out\nbecause something of psychic activity goes into every kind of The\nBrain's cognitions, even the purely mathematical ones. And it would be\nutterly impossible to stop The Brain's operations altogether. I wanted\nto, but the General Staff won't permit it. There's an international\ncrisis of the first magnitude. There may be war within a few days or\neven hours. Our country has got to prepare counter measures; get ready\nfor the worst. A state of National Emergency already is declared. The\nBrain is the heart of our National Defense: You know that. It is vital\nand as indispensible at this hour as it never was before; it continues\nto function perfectly with the exception of these isolated disturbances\nin the civilian sector which we will have under control in no time.\n\n\"At present I am no more than a figurehead. If I were to give orders to\ncut off The Brain's power, I would be court-martialed; if I would try\nand force my way into the Atomic Powerplant, the guards would shoot me\non the spot. That's orders Lee. And they apply to you as well. Be\nreasonable, man!\"\n\nLee's fingers tore through his greying mane of hair.\n\n\"Scriven, this is maddening. I thought you knew what I know; I thought\nyou knew everything. Then let me tell you that you're absolutely wrong.\nThere is no technological, mechanical defect; it's worse, it's\ninfinitely worse: you've created a Frankenstein in The Brain. The\nthing's alive; it's possessed with a destructive will, it demands the\nunconditional surrender of Man; it has made itself the God of the\nMachines. Behind all this there is a deep and evil plan by which The\nBrain aspires to dictatorship over the world.\"\n\nFor a second Scriven jerked his head sideways, away from Lee in that\nmannerism typical for him. His lips inaudibly formed words:\n\"dementia-praecox.\" As he turned back to Lee his face was changed and so\nwas his voice. There was calm and authority in it, the whole immense\nsuperiority and power which the surgeon holds over the patient on the\noperation table:\n\n\"Very interesting, Lee. You must tell me about it some day; as soon as\nwe are over this emergency. This tragic thing, Gus Krinsley's end. It\nhas had a deeply upsetting effect. I too, considered him my friend you\nknow. Let's get out of here, Lee, there's nothing we can do for the poor\nfellow. The remains will be taken care of. Meanwhile, there are so many\nother things to do and we've got to pull ourselves together and keep our\nminds on the job ahead of us. Come on, at the communications center we\ncan get a drink. I feel the need of one, don't you? And apropos of\nnothing, the routine checkups on the aptitude tests for all\nBrain-employees are on again. I take it you are scheduled for Mellish's\nand Bondy's office one of these days. This afternoon I think....\"\n\nLee gave a long glance to the man who was now leading him towards the\ndoor with a brisk step and a kind firm hand on his arm. The man didn't\nlook at him; he kept his eyes averted from both Lee and the\nblood-spattered assembly line.\n\nGus Krinsley had said: \"I'm a lost soul down there, Aussie.\" Lee\nthought. Gus Krinsley was my friend. I should have warned him, I should\nhave told him everything; it might have saved his life. Gus was a common\nman, a good man; he wouldn't have stood for Brain-dictatorship. In that\nhe was like other common men who do not know their danger. It is not\nvengeance which I seek but the defense of those for whom Gus was a\nliving symbol. For this defense I've got to preserve myself.\n\nAnd aloud he: \"The routine checkups on the aptitude tests--of course. I\nthought they were about due. Tomorrow afternoon at Mellish and Bondy's\noffice; that would suit me fine. As you said it yourself, Scriven, a\nmoment ago, this is an awful shock. Gus' tragic end and these tests\nought to be based on a man's normal state of mind. So if you don't mind\nI think I'll go now and break the sad news gently to Gus' wife. You'll\ngive me time for that; that's what you had in mind in the first place,\nwasn't it?\"\n\n\"Of course, my dear fellow, of course, that's what I had in mind. Then,\ntill tomorrow afternoon. They'll be waiting for you at the health\ncenter....\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\nAs the elevator shot up through the concrete of The Brain's \"dura mater\"\ntoward Apperception 36, Lee was feeling grand. Now he was a man with a\nmission. Now he knew exactly what he had to do. Whether it would help,\nwhether it would stop The Brain; that was a different question, but at\nleast he had his plan.\n\nHe marvelled at the ease and at the lightning speed with which the great\ndecision had come. It had been at the sight of the senseless\nrobot-monsters, at the blood-spattered assembly line that the sense of\nsacred mission had come over him. It had been at the moment when, in\nScriven's grip upon his arm, he had read his condemnation that he had\nhit upon the plan.\n\nHe must take an awful chance and a terrific responsibility. For this he\nhad to be morally certain that The Brain was a liar, that Scriven was a\nliar and that war was being provoked by The Brain despite all its\nassertions to the contrary because The Brain could assume power only\nover the dead bodies of millions of men like Gus; Gus whom The Brain had\nbutchered like a guinea pig because he had refused to obey the Gogs and\nMagogs of the Machine God.\n\nNow that he had this moral certainty Lee felt that strange and mystical\nelation which comes to the soldier at the zero hour in war. The worst\nwas really over; the terrible waiting, the uncertainty, the struggle of\nmorale in \"sweating it out.\" Now his nerves were steady, exhaustion and\nfatigue had vanished; in its place was that wonderful feeling of full\nmastery over all faculties which comes to fighting men as the battle is\njoined. There was that upsurge of the blood from fighting ancestors\nwhich obliterates the cowardice of the intellect, that inspired\nintoxication which sharpens the intellect into a battle axe. By his\nquick-witted postponement of the fateful appointment with the\npsychiatrists he had gained thirty hours. Whether this would be enough\nhe didn't know, but he felt in himself the strength to fight on\nendlessly.\n\nThe elevator stopped at Apperception 36 and Lee stood for a moment at\nthe door of his lab for a last breath, a briefing addressed to himself:\n\n\"This is like walking into a mine field,\" he thought; \"one false step\nand things go Boom. All the sensory organs of The Brain are in action\nbehind this door and some of them are pretty near extrasensory in their\nmind-reading capacities. I've got to walk back and forth amongst those\nobservation screens; there may be other radiations too, following me,\npenetrating into the recesses of my mind without my knowing it. That\nmeans I must make my mind a blank. It's like being quizzed by a\nlie-detector, only more so. I must not only seem normal and at ease, I\nactually must be so and harbor only friendly, innocuous thoughts toward\nThe Brain. My actions will seem innocent enough; it is my thoughts\nwherein my danger lies. Whatever I do; I've got to direct that from the\nsubconscious: act as by instinct and keep the mind a blank.\"\n\nHe opened the door and looked around--as usual--in this vault as silent\nas the grave of a Pharaoh. There was a little dust on the glass cubicles\nof \"_Ant-termes-pacificus_\" and there were a few lines scribbled on the\nyellow memo-pad on his desk:\n\n\"Thanks for the weekend, boss. Everything normal and under control. Next\nfeeding time at 8 p.m. the 27th. So long, Harris.\" Of course; he had\ngiven Harris, his assistant, the weekend off. That had escaped his mind\nin the excitement when The Brain's mutiny began.... And now it was the\n29th.\n\n\"They must be ravenously hungry by this time,\" he thought, and that\nthought was in order because it was a normal thought.\n\nHe walked through the rows of the cubicles, halting his step every now\nand then. The fluorescent screens on which The Brain drew the curves of\nits observation-rays showed two sharp rises of the lines marked\n\"activity\" and \"emotionality\". The lower levels of the glass cages\nalready were opaque; the glass corroded by the viscous acids which the\nsoldiers had squirted from their cephalic glands in their attempts to\nbreak out and to reach food.\n\n\"Poor beasts,\" Lee thought, and he thought it without restraint because\nit was normal, a perfectly harmless thought. But then; below the layers\nof his consciousness his instincts told a different story.\n\n\"This is marvelous,\" they triumphed. \"Fate takes a hand; they are\ndesperate; they're ready for the warpath and even the tiger and the\nelephant would run for cover when their columns march.\"\n\nAs if it were the most natural thing in the world for him to do Lee\nwalked over to the south wall, the one which separated the lab from the\ninterior of The Brain. He removed a sliding panel marked\n\"L-Filler-Spout\" and there it was before his eyes, looking almost like a\nfireplug. There was one in every apperception center and there were\nhundreds more throughout The Brain, and their purpose was to replenish\nthe liquid insulation which shielded the sensitive electric nervepaths\nof The Brain. Without looking at the thing, concentrating his every\nthought upon the hunger of \"_Ant-termes-pacificus_\", Lee unscrewed the\ncap and put a finger into the opening. The finger came back covered with\nthe thick, the syrupy lignin, this amber-colored sluggish stream of\nwoodpulp liquefied, this soft bed of The Brain's vibrant nerves.\nUnthinking, absent-minded, Lee wiped the finger with his handkerchief.\n\n\"Now, I'm going to try a slightly different arrangement of the tests,\"\nhe thought. \"It's normal; I'm doing that almost every day.\"\n\nThe feeling he experienced as he swung into action was strange. As he\nwalked back and forth it felt like somnambulic walk; something his limbs\ndid without an act of will. As his hands did things expertly and\nskillfully the feeling was that they were instruments automatically\nmoved not by his own volition but by some power outside himself.\n\nHis movements were those of a child serenely at play, a child\nincongruously tall and gaunt and grey-haired constructing little\ncauseways and bridges on the ground with the logs of the fireplace; a\nhappy child engrossed in an innocent game....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt took about an hour and then causeways of fresh pulpwood were laid\nfrom every termite hill to every feeding gate, from every glass cubicle\nto the south wall and along the south wall to the \"Lignin-Filler-Spout\";\nand from the ground up to the spout a little tepee of sticks had been\nbuilt.\n\nAdmiringly the grey-haired child looked at its handiwork through\nthick-lensed glasses. \"It's been an interesting game,\" Lee thought, \"it\nmight turn out to be a valuable new experiment. I'll sit down now and\nobserve what happens....\"\n\nHe went over to the desk again and settled down. He opened his files and\nlaid out his charts on the desk and there were colored pencils to be\nsharpened for the entries. He was glad of that; his conscious mind\nrejoiced now over every little pursuit of routine, of normalcy, of the\nestablished scientific order of things; it concentrated on these. Pencil\nin hand, reclined in comfort, his heartbeat even, he kept expectant eyes\nupon the staggered rows of fluorescent screens, ready to note any\nsignificant developments.\n\nHe didn't have to wait long; their strange sixth sense, the telepathy of\ntheir collective brains, the spirit of the hive with the immortality of\ntheir race for its supreme law, had already told them of a promised land\nand of new worlds to conquer.\n\nOn the fluorescent screens Lee watched their preparations for the big\ndrive: The nasicorn-soldiers clotting together at the exit tunnels like\nassault troops at the bow of invasion barges when the bottom scrapes the\nlanding beach; the fierce, virginal workers struggling up from the deep\nshelters of the nurseries, carrying in their mandibles the squirming\nlarvae, the living future of the race. The walls of the queen's prison\nbroken down in the innermost redoubt and the guards closing in on the\nidol of the race, moving the big white body like a juggernaut.\n\nIn a matter of minutes the \"activity\" and \"emotionality\" curves on the\nfluorescent screens surged to heights which Lee had never seen.\n\nIt started with the crossbreeds of \"_termes-bellicosus_,\" with army-ants\nand devil-ants, and spread quickly all along the line of non-belligerent\nvarieties. Famine had given them the impetus to change their mode of\nlife; famine, the inexorable tyrant, whipped them onward into their\nexodus.\n\nOn the foremost fluorescent screens Lee saw it start: Small groups of\nwarriors reconnoitering into no-man's-land and quickly darting back\nagain.... And then the dark columns of the first assault wave descending\nfrom their city-gates, lock-stepped like Prussian guards of old,\nmarching as if to the beat of drums. On the visi-screens which magnified\nthem a hundred times they looked an awesome sight with the rostrums of\ntheir horns, bigger than all the rest of their bodies, swinging like\nturrets of battleships being trained upon the enemy. From the\nloudspeakers which magnified all noise a hundred times, the excited\ntremors of their bodies, the locked steps of a million feet swelled into\na vast roar sounding almost like thunder.\n\nJotting down observations in rapid pencil strokes, Lee thought:\n\"Starvation is producing very interesting results; it's a worthwhile\nexperiment.\" With all his mental energy he suppressed the silent prayer\nwhich struggled to arise from the deep of his unconscious: \"Good Lord\nlet The Brain not realize _what_ is going on.\"\n\nThe visi-screens now showed the second wave of the assault: endless\ncolumns of workers, their mandibles twitching with eagerness to devour,\nbustling along the logs, kept in line by two rows of warriors to their\nright and left. The noises they produced in the loudspeakers were as of\nsome big cattle-drive.\n\nWith no interruption in the lengthening line the third wave followed:\nthe virgin nurses, the frustrated mothers carrying the whitish larvae,\nlike babes in arms, carrying them with the indomitable determination to\npreserve their lives which human nurses showed in the Second World War\nas the bombs crashed into maternity wards. And then at last the heavy\nrearguard: the holiest of holies, the living spirit of the hive, the\nqueen. Majestically she was carried on her warrior's backs; enormous as\nshe loomed on the visi-screen, the white of her uncouth body was hardly\nvisible, swarmed over as she was by her fanatical courtiers which,\nlicking and caressing, kept her covered as by a shield. Her consorts\ntrotted meekly in her trail; unhappy little men, rudely aroused from\ntheir harem sinecure, jealously guarded and prodded on by the queen's\ncountless ladies in waiting and the palace guard.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThings moved very fast now; Lee's quick pencil strokes could hardly\nfollow the events:\n\n10:30 a.m. The foremost columns are now out of reach of the\nvisi-screens. But I can see them moving along the logs with the naked\neye. Interesting new fact: the crossbreeds from the most belligerent\nspecies are far and ahead of the rest. They don't take time out to drive\ntunnels. But even the tunnels of the more pacific strains are forging\nahead at an extraordinary rate; six feet across the floor already....\n\n10:40: \"_Bellicosus_\" has reached the south wall; it is now moving\nalong the wall toward the \"Lignin-Filler-Spout.\" There is no hesitancy\nas they change direction at the angle of 90 degrees. The Queens are now\ncoming up at a very rapid rate from the mounds farthest to the rear.\nIt's fortunate we have these differences in behaviorism and temperament\nbecause otherwise a terrific traffic jam would occur at the\n\"Filler-Spout\"....\n\n10:50: \"_Bellicosus_\" is now ascending to the \"Filler-Spout.\" The\nwarriors have ringed the pipe. With their body-tremors they are giving\nthe \"come-on\" signal to the workers. The workers are piling in--an\naverage batch--about 65,000. It's a good thing that there is an air\nspace in these horizontal nerve-path pipes. That gives them a chance to\nmarch along the ceiling and work down from there....\n\n11:00: There are now a score of columns converging at the\n\"Filler-Spout.\" Amazing that even under such provoking conditions\n\"_ant-termes_\" won't fight. The warriors act like the most accomplished\ntraffic-cops; it's marvelous how they keep their columns in order and\nkeep them moving side by side into The Brain....\n\n11:10: The first million, I should say, is now well inside the\n\"Filler-Spout.\" They're marching at a rate of at least 300 yards per\nhour; amazing speed; I never saw them move that fast before. Even so I\nwon't have time to watch the outcome of the experiment. I've put\neverything I had into this thing. 500 hives--that would make it 35\nmillion individuals of the species at a conservative estimate. It's the\nbiggest mass-migration I've ever seen, but will it be big enough to do\nthe trick?\n\n11:20: The foremost columns must have reached the neighboring\napperception centers to the right and left of mine by now. But they\nwon't stop; I know that from experience in Australia. To them it's just\nlike any other \"hollow tree\"; they'll drive right on to the top; they\nwon't bivouak before they are completely exhausted. That won't be before\nfive or six hours. At the rate of 900 feet per hour that would make it\nalmost a mile, covering the whole \"occipital region\" of The Brain. And\nthen they are going to feast; boy, will they be ravenous....\n\n11:30: About 3 million are safely inside now I should say. Don't think\nthat I could stay at my post much longer. There's a certain\nextracurricular idea coming up from the subconscious like a tidal wave.\nThe dams of willpower don't seem able to hold back that idea; I've got\nto get out before it spills across the dam and floods my consciousness.\nThe phone rings; for once it is a welcome sound.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was Oona's voice; trembling with emotion as if she were still\nsuffering from this morning's shock or had suffered another:\n\n\"Semper, are you all right?\"\n\nLee reassured her that he was and then listened astounded as she heaved\na sigh of relief.\n\n\"Listen, Semper, this is terribly important. I've got to see you\nimmediately. No, I cannot tell you over the phone; it's a personal\nmatter and it concerns you. You cannot make it? Is your business _that_\nimportant? You're in the midst of a vital experiment? That's awful,\nSemper; it really is in this case. No; I'm all right personally; it\nisn't that. It's _you_ Semper, it's _you_. 5 p.m. at the earliest, is\nthat the best you can do? All right then. Meet me at the airport. And\ntake good care of yourself, do you hear me: _take good care of yourself,\nSemper_, up to that time.\"\n\nShe hung up quickly, as if suddenly disturbed.\n\nLee frowned at the clock: 11:35. He could have managed to meet Oona\nduring her lunch hour at the hotel. But there were things he still had\nto do even more important than Oona. More important to him than even\nOona. He shook his head; it wouldn't have seemed possible a few days\nago....\n\nWith the climax of the experiment now over Lee felt his mental\nresistance ebbing fast.\n\n\"They're on the move,\" he thought. \"Nothing can stop them now; it's\nbeyond my control, but they're marching. I'd better get out of here....\"\n\nWith fevered eyes he glanced around the floor and like a victim of\ndelirium saw it moving, crawling as with snakes, crawling into their\nhole all of them, black snakes, grey snakes, red snakes, endless their\nlengthening bodies....\n\nHe carefully closed the door of the lab, locked it and then pressed the\nbutton which opened the elevator door. Only as the cage tore down\nthrough the \"dura mater\", only when he felt safe from the sensory organs\nof The Brain, only when he was sure that not even a human eye would see\nhim in this racing little cage, only then did the dam of willpower\ncollapse. He put both hands before his eyes in vain attempt to stop the\ntears from streaming; those tears of a soldier over the body of his\nfallen chum; those tears of a greying scientist who sacrificed the\nresults of his life's work to some higher cause.\n\nLee caught the one p.m. Greyhound-Helicopter for Phoenix only a second\nbefore the start. He panted from the run, but in his sunken eyes there\nwas a light and in his mind a new serenity which comes to men when they\nare fortunate enough to meet with some very wonderful woman, when with\nadmiration and humility they stand confronted with a courage greater\nthan man's. Gus's wife had been that woman; the way she had taken the\nterrible news was the source of Lee's new strength and confidence.\n\nThe flying commuter was almost empty.\n\nNoting Lee's astonished glance the stewardess gave a nervous little\nlaugh:\n\n\"People get jumpy traveling,\" she volunteered.\n\n\"That so; why do they?\"\n\n\"Didn't you hear the news all morning; wait....\"\n\nShe flicked the radio on. On the television screen appeared an aerial\nview of a big city, vaguely familiar looking, yet as foreign as Venice,\nand then the voice of the announcer broke through.\n\n\"New Orleans: It is now ascertained that the break in the levees was\ncaused by a huge trench digging machine left unattended overnight at a\nlonely spot twenty miles South of Baton Rouge. Levee engineers believe\nthat its engine was started possibly by saboteurs, approximately at\nmidnight and that it then proceeded automatically digging itself into\nthe levee until it was drowned by the incoming river. The initial\neight-foot breach has now been widened by the Mississippi to a width of\n200 feet. Along Canal street and all over downtown New Orleans the flood\nhas reached a level of ten feet above the streets as evacuation\ncontinues. The government has concentrated every available piece of\nequipment to close the breach. All normal activities have come to a\nstandstill; property damages are estimated at 50 million dollars; the\ndeath toll has passed the 500 mark in this most catastrophic flood in\nNew Orleans' history.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNew aerial pictures, similar to the results of a blockbuster bombing\nattack flicked on the screen:\n\n\"New York: The bursting of the watermains at dawn this morning at seven\ndifferent points of Manhattan's downtown area which has already caused\nthe collapse of the Waldorf Astoria Hotel and seven big apartment\nbuildings along Park Avenue now threatens Macy's and the Public Library\non 42nd Street.\n\n\"All subway traffic has stopped. Evacuation of panicky Metropolitans\nfrom the Central Park district proceeds in an orderly manner. In the\nHarlem district, however, disorders and plunderings have been reported.\nAn estimated seven million people are without drinking water. Trucks\ncarrying water from New Jersey are severely hampered by unprecedented\ntraffic snarl-ups, since owners of private automobiles are fleeing the\ncity with their families. Due to the flooding of sub-street levels in\nboth Grand Central and Penn Station, evacuation by rail can proceed only\nfrom 163rd Street for the New York Central and from New Jersey for the\nPennsylvania Railroad system. Effectiveness of railroad transport is\nreduced to less than 30% of normal capacity. I. C. Moriarty, Sanitary\nCommissioner of New York, declared in his press conference that the\ncatastrophic bursting of the watermains was caused by failure of the\nremote-controlled automatic mainstem valves. For reasons which still\npuzzle city engineers these valves closed suddenly and completely at 5\na.m. this morning. Because of the failure of the alarm system,\nhigh-pressure pumps in the powerhouses continued to work and to build up\npressure in the closed system of the watermains till almost\nsimultaneously, and with explosive force, the breaks occurred, the first\none right under the Columbus monument. In view of the extremely grave\nsituation which threatens the world's biggest city, Governor Charles\ndeclared martial law this morning at 10 a.m.\n\n\"Chicago: The city-wide calamity caused by the unprecedented breakdown\nin the sewage disposal system gets more threatening with every minute.\nAs engineers are still unable to enter the atomic power plant and as the\nsewage disposal-pumps continue to work in reverse, all Chicagoland is\nrapidly turning into a cesspool as millions of toilets and kitchen sinks\nspill sewage into every apartment. The Fire Department has received more\nthan two million calls from harassed citizens battling vainly against\nthe unsavory flood.\n\n\"Harrowing scenes are reported from hotels where 3,000 members of the\nAmerican Federation of Women's Clubs are taking turns in sending protest\ntelegrams and gallantly holding down by the weight of their own bodies\nthe facilities-front in the 3,000 bathrooms of the hotels. At a few\npoints workers have succeeded in digging up sewage mains and tons of\nconcrete are being poured to stop the devastating reversal of the flow.\n\n\"Even now, however, the partially closed mains and the overflow from\nhouses are flooding the streets. As it gradually seeps into Lake\nMichigan, source of Chicago's drinking water supply, health commissioner\nSegantini has already warned against the appalling dangers of epidemics\nwhich might result from this.\n\n\"Nuclear physicists of Chicago University, called in to aid city\nengineers, have declared that dangerous amounts of escaping gamma-rays\nin the Atomic Powerplant were first discovered by the Geiger-counter at\ntwo a.m. Evacuation of all employees was ordered one hour later as a\nsafety measure. Just why the pumps resumed operations after the shutdown\nof the plant and just what caused the system to work in reverse remains\na mystery. Prof. Windeband, spokesman of the group of nuclear\nphysicists, confesses that he has no explanation for the phenomenon.\n\n\"Washington: Rumors are flying thick and fast in the nation's capital.\nIn the rapidly darkening picture of international politics the\nmobilization of Mexico is the latest shadow. Official explanation given\nby Mexico's ambassador Rivadivia, is that his government has ordered\nmobilization as a protective measure to guard frontiers against the\nillegal entry of thousands of panicky American refugees chiefly from New\nOrleans. The State Department is said to be planning a protest. Even so,\nthe unprecedented series of catastrophes on the home-front of America\novershadows everything. Washington insiders report a growing conviction\nin high government circles that the events of the past 48 hours are\nproof absolute that large numbers of foreign saboteurs and agents are at\nwork.\"\n\n\"Had enough?\" asked the stewardess.\n\nLee confessed that he had.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith its helicopters feathered, the Greyhound came sliding down onto the\nBus Terminal's roof; fifteen minutes later Lee stood again at his\nfather's door, that door he had thought once before he would never see\nagain.\n\nThe old man's loose-skinned face, tanned like saddle leather, didn't\nmove an inch at the sight of the son: \"You again, Semper? Come in then.\"\n\nLee vaguely sensed that his father was glad he had come; that there was\nsome unfinished business left from their last conversation and that his\nfather welcomed the opportunity to finish it.\n\n\"You know,\" he said as his stiff-jointed legs carried him back to the\ntable with bottle and glasses trembling on the tray in his hands, \"you\nknow, I've named these four walls after old friends of mine--all of them\ndead--but sometimes they won't answer when I talk to them. And then I'm\nglad when somebody happens along. But don't take that to mean that I'm\nin my dotage now or getting mad.\"\n\n\"No, Father; that's just loneliness.\"\n\n\"In any case, Son, there are lots of people lots madder than I am.\nThere's a woman living next door, a spinster, answers to the name of\nPimpernel. This morning she came running over crying that her\nvacuum-cleaner was chasing her all over the house. And by God, Semper,\nit was a fact. Never saw anything like it. One of those new-fangled\nautomatic contraptions which are supposed to do the job all alone by\nthemselves, and it banged around and chased about as if it had a\nhornet's nest under its bonnet. Scared the poor woman to death.\"\n\n\"What did you do?\"\n\n\"What could I do? I'm not a mechanic; there was no cord attached or\nanything to plug out. So I got my automatic and shot the damn thing.\"\n\n\"Shot it?\"\n\n\"Sure; bullet must have penetrated something; anyway it stopped dead on\nthe spot. And now she threatens to sue me for damages; there's gratitude\nfor you. What brought you here?\"\n\nLee felt elated; obviously his father was in high spirits from this\nmorning's successful hunt; for once he was in a receptive _mood_.\n\nRapidly, with all the precision he could muster, Lee explained, as an\nadjutant would explain a new development in a strategic situation to his\ncommanding general. After a while the old man started pacing the floor\nin rising excitement. A spark of the old fierceness had come into his\nblunted pale-blue eyes as he swung around.\n\n\"Before this morning's incident I would have considered all this as a\nraving maniac's gibberish. Now as I put two and two together I can see a\ndistinct possibility that you've got something. Tell you what I'll\ndo--what I consider my duty to do--I'll call out the National Guard.\nWe'll encircle The Brain and present an ultimatum to the thing. If\nnecessary we'll take the place by storm.\"\n\nThe younger Lee answered with a vigorous shaking of his head.\n\n\"You cannot do that, Father. In the first place the National Guard\ndoesn't stand a chance against the defences of The Brain. In the second\nplace your action would mean civil war. No, we must go after this in a\ndifferent manner. The Secretary of War is an old friend of yours. All\nright: take the next plane to Washington. Don't tell him anything he\ncouldn't believe. Tell him--what is strictly the truth--that some power\nhostile to the United States threatens to interfere with the remote\ncontrol of automatic war equipment. Tell him to redouble guard over the\nremote-control rocket launchers, to have their automatic computators\ndisconnected temporarily and for the commanders to accept only orders\ndirect from Washington. The greatest danger is not the domestic\ndisorders; that situation we'll have in hand if my scheme works. But let\none rocket accidentally be launched into some big foreign capital and it\nwill set the whole world on fire in an Atomic war. That is what The\nBrain wants, that is what must be prevented at all costs. Will you do\nthat, Father?\"\n\nEven years after Lee never understood just what had happened or how it\ncould have happened that his position to his father became reversed with\nsuch startling suddenness. In the extremity of the situation he had\naddressed his father with the authority of of a commander toward one of\nhis aids--and the father had accepted the son's command unquestioningly.\n\n\"Semper,\" he had said, \"I have always considered you a military\nnincompoop. I was mistaken, son, I apologize. Now let me grab my hat and\ncoat. You kept the taxi waiting? Good: tell the man to go to the\nairport, and let her rip.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt 5 p.m. the Flying Greyhound dropped on Cephalon airport and there was\nOona looking very pale, but very beautiful in the gathering dusk. She\ngrabbed Lee by the arm leading him to the other side of the hangar where\nstood her little jetticopter plane. \"Let's get in here,\" she said. \"I'm\nfreezing and I don't want you to be seen around here.\"\n\nShe didn't put on the lights, yet even in the dark Lee could see the\ngolden helmet of her hair shimmering like the pale gold in the halo of\nthe Virgin as the primitive art of Tuscany presented her a thousand\nyears ago. She nestled the soft fur of her coat against Lee's shoulders\nand as she did he felt her shivering. He put a protecting arm around\nher, careful to do it as a friend, careful to suppress the surge of\nblood which started burning in his veins. She seemed to be groping for\nwords; it took a little while before she began to speak, with clarity\nand simplicity as she always did but with an audible effort to keep\ncomposed:\n\n\"I've brought you a suitcase, Semper, with a few necessities. And I\nbrought you some money, later you can send me your check. And here are\nthe keys of the plane. Fly over to Mexico; go back to Australia from\nthere or anywhere you want, but _do_ get out of this country and do it\nquick. I couldn't tell you that over the phone and I shouldn't be\ntelling this to you now, but I feel I must.\n\n\"You're in danger and it's serious. Why? I don't know, but Howard seems\nto suspect your loyalty. He also seems to think that you've gone out of\nyour mind. And Howard has taken measures; he has ordered re-examination\nof your broad aptitude test. He has voiced his suspicion as to your\nsanity to Bondy and Mellish and you know what kind of yes-men those\nfellows are in the face of an authority like Scriven's. Trust them to\ndiscover something wrong with you, trust them to give the test some kind\nof a convenient twist. They're going to have you certified, they're\ngoing to put you into a mental institution, Semper.\n\n\"Do you get that? Do you realize that it's fate worse than death? Do you\nunderstand that there is nothing you can do to escape that fate except\nby flight? I have no idea when it's going to be, this trap they're going\nto spring on you; but for God's sake, Semper, get going as long as\nthere's still time. Any moment now some plainclothesman might grab you\nby the arm and then....\"\n\nIt was she who had grabbed him by the arm, Oona who looked into his\nface, her big eyes moist.\n\nLee strained his willpower so it would control the tremor of his voice:\n\n\"Oona; there's one thing I have got to know: What made you tell me\nthis--and do all this so I could get away?\"\n\nThe girl's eyes didn't waver from his. \"I remember,\" she said slowly,\n\"I remember that I felt as if I could throw conventions into the wind\nat the very first time we met. I've always been frank with you, as\nmuch as I could be in my position. So then I don't mind telling you now\nthat ... I like you immensely, Semper.\"\n\nAs if agitated by some electric shock, Lee's arm tightened around the\ngirl's waist. \"Oona, I have asked you once before to be my wife. You\nsaid you couldn't and I thought it was because you didn't like me well\nenough. But now, after what you've just told me, now that we both know\nabout The Brain and that I wasn't insane in my observations, I'm asking\nyou again: Be my wife, Oona, and then let's go together--anywhere--away\nfrom all this, to the end of the world.\"\n\nIn the darkness her uplifted white face shone like the moon; there were\ntwo limpid luminous pools in it. All of a sudden they overflowed with\ntears streaming down her cheeks. Her mouth half opened, swallowed hard.\nThere was now nothing left of that \"integrated personality\", nothing of\nthe calm and the poise which the younger set of scientists admired so\nmuch. There was only a young woman torn with torment.\n\n\"I would have loved to go with you to the end of the world when we were\nfloating over the Canyon. I would love to go with you a thousand times\nmore tonight,\" Lee heard her say and then the gnashing of her teeth as\nshe continued: \"But it cannot be, Semper. It cannot be because my die is\ncast, because my fate is made. Did nobody ever tell you? Didn't you even\nguess? Howard and I--we've been living together for the past six years.\nHe's not a very good man; rather beyond good and evil; but then: I feel\nthat I have got to stick to him now more than ever.\"\n\nThe golden helmet of her hair dropped to Lee's breast. \"I'm ashamed,\"\nshe sobbed, \"terribly, terribly ashamed, Semper. I've made such a mess\nof things, of you and me--such a mess of my whole life.\"\n\nHe buried his face into the fragrance of the golden wave. \"It's nothing,\ndarling,\" he whispered close to her ear. \"It doesn't mean a thing to me;\nit's less than a cloud which passes across the face of the moon, and\nthen it's gone and never will come back....\"\n\nShe freed herself from his embrace. With both her hands upon his\nshoulders she looked straight into his eyes.\n\n\"_That is not true, Semper_,\" she said and there was the fierceness of a\nyoung Viking warrior in the flash of her eyes: \"That is not true and\nthere's been already too much of lie in my life. I just cannot stand for\nany more of that. _It can not be, Semper._ I've told you plainly and it\nmeans not _ever_, not _ever_. Go now. Do as I told you. Go immediately.\nIf you really love me, grant me this, let me feel that I could do at\nleast something--this one thing for you.\"\n\n\"Oona!\" Lee exclaimed and it sounded like a deep-throated bell in an\nancient cathedral town as it rings the last stroke of midnight and then\nhangs mute in the dark sky. That happiness he had felt, that cometflight\nthrough all the stars in heaven; it was too big for him, it couldn't\nlast. He had sensed the blow before it fell. It wasn't like being hit in\naction; it was like in that field hospital when the doc had told him:\n\"This is going to hurt, Joe--I'm sorry, but we're shy of morphine.\"\nHoward's name had cut just like that expected knife. What was there left\nto say? Nothing; nothing, but one small matter.\n\n\"I love you, Oona, and that means forever just as much as you mean that\nnot ever you can come with me. And I thank you, Oona, for this hour.\nYes; I think I'll go back to Australia--where I belong. But not tonight.\nI've set a great experiment going--the outcome is no longer in my hand.\nStill I feel I mustn't run away now. In fact I cannot; it's somewhat\nlike a soldier's duty to stay up front. I'm going to see this to the\nend.\"\n\nShe buried her face in her hands: \"I knew it. You child, you--you Don\nQuixote charging against the windmills. They're going to _kill_ you,\nthey're going to _kill_ you. And now there's nothing I can do.\"\n\nFor a second her small fists pounded against Lee's breast and the next\nmoment, before he could do anything, she had jumped out of the plane\nslamming the door in his face. For a few seconds more he heard her\nfootsteps rushing across the frozen turf and the receding wails of\nechoes from the hangar walls:\n\n\"And now there's nothing I can do--nothing I can do.\"\n\nWhen after a minute of fumbling in the dark he pushed the door open, it\nwas too late.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe walked over to the hotel; not by an act of will, but with his legs\nsomehow doing the job alone and by themselves. He ordered himself a car\nfrom the Braintrust garage. He entered The Brain and went up in the\nelevator to Apperception 36. Nobody seemed to notice that there was a\nsomnambulist passing by.... He unlocked the door and under the rows of\nneon lights things were as he had left them eight hours ago. Only there\nwere no longer any snakes crawling across the floor towards a hole in\nthe wall. But the hole was still there and he thought that he had better\ntidy things up a bit. If nobody had noticed the arrangements for this\nnew experiment so far; why should anybody be forewarned?\n\nLee put the lid back on the \"Lignin-Filler-Spout.\" He closed the panel\nso the wall looked whole again. He gathered the sticks of cordwood from\nthe floor and piled them neatly to their stacks again. All this he did\nlike a child putting its things away after a long day's play; a\ngrey-haired child, weary, with the sandman in its eyes. He looked around\nand found everything done and over with. On the fluorescent screens all\ncurves The Brain described had dropped to the bottom. Like dead things\nthey lay flat. On the visi-screens some stay-behinds of the great exodus\nwere looming large, a hapless little ant-king scurrying about; a few\ndisabled workers, their blind eyes staring into the face of death. It\nwould come soon to them; their work on earth was done....\n\nLee looked at the clock: 10 p.m. He put out the lights and locked the\ndoor behind that yawning emptiness which once had been his lab, which he\nwould never see again. As he descended in the elevator he felt very\ntired.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\nIncessant shrieks of the phone aroused Lee from the deep well of his\nsleep. He didn't know the female voice which fairly jumped at him.\n\n\"Is this Dr. Lee? Dr. Semper F. Lee from Canberra; am I at last\nconnected with Dr. Lee?\"\n\n\"Lee speaking.\"\n\n\"I've been phoning for you all over The Brain Lee. Have you forgotten\nyou had an appointment with us? Checking up on your broad aptitude test.\nThe doctors are waiting. This is Vivian Leahy speaking; don't you\nremember me?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course.\" The picture of the loquacious angel who had guided him\nto the medical center on his first trip flashed back into his mind. \"I\nknow I have an appointment for this afternoon; I'll be there.\"\n\n\"But, Dr. Lee, this _is_ this afternoon; it's four p.m. already. You\naren't ill, Dr. Lee, are you? You sound so strange.\"\n\nLee assured her that he wasn't and that he would be over right away.\n\n\"It's a miracle they left me undisturbed that long,\" he thought as he\nshaved and dressed. His personal fate would be decided within the next\ntwo hours he knew; it would be the end. But even as the tension mounted\nin his consciousness he thought triumphantly. \"I've had sixteen hours of\nsleep; that's marvelous. Nobody can take that away. The body has\nrecharged its energies. Now I can stand the gaff.\"\n\nDown at the desk they handed him a Western Union. It was from Washington\nand bore no signature. \"Mission completed,\" it read.\n\nIt made him feel fine. \"Father has done it; he is a better man than I,\"\nhe thought.\n\nWhile the car streaked though the desert Lee scanned the morning papers.\n\n\"No Trace Of President Vandersloot,\" still was the headline. But below\nnew havocs were listed as they had developed overnight. This time the\nWest coast was the zone of catastrophes; the hostile power seemed to be\nbent upon the closing of all ports in the U.S.A.\n\nLee gnashed his teeth as he read the number of new casualties, women and\nchildren, too, who had become the victims of The Brain.\n\nArrived at \"Grand Central\" he kept a sharp lookout for any unusual\nactivity. There was none. All along elevator-row small groups of\nbookish-looking men returned from their day's work in the Apperception\nCenters. They looked calm and contented and with their briefcases under\ntheir arms almost like ordinary businessmen heading for the commuter\ntrain.\n\nHe didn't dare to linger or to look around. There was this all-pervading\nsense of being shadowed, of having gone into a trap from which there was\nno escape, of eyes following him everywhere. Whose eyes? That was\nimpossible to know. Maybe The Brain's; its sensory organs could\nconceivably be installed anywhere. Maybe that janitor guiding a\npolishing machine over the rubber floor was a plain clothesman; or maybe\nit was that detached gentleman who seemed to wait for an elevator with a\nstack of books under his arms.\n\nAs the cage shot up to Apperception 27, failure pressed down on his\nheart. Now it was almost thirty hours since he had released \"Ant-termes\"\ninto the nerve paths of The Brain. Those undermining and devouring\narmies; what could have happened to them? Any number of things: Perhaps\nthe Lignin in the nerve paths was poisonous. There had been no time for\nhim to test the stuff. Perhaps the maintenance engineers had replenished\nthe insulation in that sector overnight and all the hives were drowned.\nPerhaps some kind of a detecting apparatus had found out about the pest\ninside The Brain right from the start. As long as the beachhead of the\nunderground invasion remained small, its blocking would not impair the\nfunctions of The Brain. What a fool he had been to pit dumb little\nanimals against the powers of a God. Oona had been right; he _was_ that\nknight in rusty armor charging against windmills on a Rozinante....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nVivian Leahy dragged him into the reception room of the medical center\nalmost by force. \"The doctors have been waiting for you two hours now,\"\nshe scolded him. \"They never did that before for any man. How come you\nforgot? And you forgot me too; last time you were so nice, I thought you\nwould date me up. I couldn't have resisted your invitation, you know.\nNow, off with your coat.\"\n\nDespite their irritation Mellish and Bondy received Lee with all their\ntweedy cordiality. While they piled their weird equipment around the\noperation table their tongues kept wagging: \"The disappearance of the\nPresident; what did Lee make of that? Was he dead or alive? Those\nhorrible catastrophes all over the country; what was behind all this?\nForeign agents, a native underground? Didn't Lee think there was a tidal\nwave of anti-technology feeling arising since unemployment had again set\nin? And would the international crisis lead to war? The Brain, of\ncourse, would be the safest place in that event; but then, to think of\nthe civilian population, an anticipated forty, fifty million dead;\nterrible wasn't it? Was Lee still able to concentrate upon his\nscientific work these harrowing days? If so, the nervous strain was\nterrific; they had experienced that in themselves. One reached the point\nof diminishing returns, didn't one? Yes, they had noticed signs of\nfatigue in Lee; discolorations under the eyes, a certain tenseness. Had\nhe lost weight recently? He looked it and he certainly had none to\nspare. Did he suffer from insomnia? What you need is a good long rest,\nDr. Lee.\"\n\nHe gave his answers automatically, detached, absent-minded almost. They\nwere playing with him as a cat with a mouse. All their questions were\nleading questions; he knew that, but it didn't seem to matter now.\nNothing mattered now after the great plan had failed, after his\nbeautiful dream too had vanished in the talk with Oona last night. \"I've\noutlived my usefulness,\" he thought.\n\nThe huge disk with the feeler-ray antennae sank down close to his chest,\nheavy as the keystone upon a tomb. The lights went out and then there\nwas again that uncanny sensation of having millions of soldiers running\ncircles all over one's skin, The Brain's vibration rays. They had a\nstrange hypnotic effect. Deep instincts of life-preservation urged Lee\nto jump up, to rush those medics, to make some desperate attempt to get\naway. But as the rays now penetrated through the skin, they tied his\nmuscles, although consciousness remained. There was a ghoulish quality\nin this, like being sucked into this apparatus, like having the very\nessence of one's life drained out by it. The only lights Lee saw, the\nglow of electronic tubes filtering through perforations in the walls of\nthe machines, they seemed like evil eyes staring at him and the smooth\nlying voices from behind his head seemed as of mocking ghosts:\n\n\"Relax, Dr. Lee, relax. Let your mind wander at will. Think as the\nspirit moves you to think. Remember, this is a routine checkup, nothing\nbut routine. Nothing to disturb you this time; we don't have to start\nyou upon any specific trend of thought. You know The Brain by now and\nhow it works; image-formation will start in a few moments. You have\nsimilar equipment in your own Apperception Center we understand. How\ndoes it work with that species you have discovered, 'Ant-termes\nPacificus'? It's marvelous what these sensory rays can do; one would\nthink that The Brain is really much more than a machine. The way it acts\nit seems alive, a towering intelligence, a superhuman personality with a\nwill of its own. Don't you think so, Dr. Lee?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe didn't answer, preoccupied with the weird sensation inside his body:\nthe diaphragm's birdwing flutterings, the ghostly fingers playing a\npizzicato on his arteries' strings closer and closer to the heart. \"Why\nanswer?\" he thought. \"Why say anything? Whatever they said was part of\nthe trap they were building and whatever he said they would make a part\nof that trap. Why did they have to go through all of this professional\nsubtlety?\"\n\nThe voices sounded lower now and farther away: \"Go easy on the\nrheostats, Mellish. I think trance has already set in.\"\n\n\"Yes; I remember his chart, he rates a high sensitivity, the rays work\nfast on types like that.\"\n\nAt the footend the screen was gradually lighting up. Like an aurora\nborealis the pale lights shot up in flashes, in quivering arcs, in\nundulating waves. Their dance kept step with the vibrations which surged\nup from Lee's chest into his brain and started racing through his\nconsciousness around and around, forming a vortex which swept up his\nthoughts like wilted leaves. Fear froze his blood; the deadly fear of\ninquisition victims in old and modern times who know that neither lie\nnor truth can save them from a fate already sealed.\n\nImages started forming out of the luminous clouds upon the screen.\n\nThere was some giant octopus, nebulous and terrifying as a diver might\nsee creeping out of the belly of a sunken ship. From the other side of\nthe screen a huge round, tentacled being crawled, radiant and somewhat\nlike the sun symbols of great antiquity. The two closed in and as they\ndid the octopus flung its arms around the shining disk obscuring it as a\ndark cloud the sun. It seemed to suck the light out of the disk; paler\nand paler it became and bigger and bigger swelled the body of the\noctopus until it had swallowed the sun.\n\nNow snakes came creeping from all sides up to the swollen octopus. All\nof a sudden the primeval struggle turned into the classic image of the\nLaokoon group: a giant central figure of a man wrestling with pythons\nwhich crushed him in their coils. Then there was only the head of the\ngiant, majestic like the Moses hewn by Leonardo's hands but torn in pain\nwith the noose of a python's muscle around his neck. Gasping, the giant\nopened his mouth and long tongues of flames shot out of it....\n\nBehind his ears he heard the voices whisper:\n\n\"By God, Scriven was right.\"\n\n\"You bet he was; maniacal obsession, a classic, most beautiful case.\"\n\n\"What more do we need?\"\n\n\"Nothing I guess; he's through. Start pushing back the rheostats.\"\n\nThe pounding, maddening crescendo of the vibrations receded gradually.\nThe rim of the vortexial funnel widened beyond Lee's head; in its center\nit left a sort of vacuum. There was one thing he couldn't understand:\nthose tactile rays, why didn't they kill him when they had his heart\nwithin their grip? Now that The Brain knew everything he had been\nwaiting for the sudden vise-grip of the rays upon his heart which would\nhave meant the end. But then, this was the end in any case....\n\nThe lights went on and he blinked into the faces of the medics bending\nover him, watching him as he wiped the sweat of death fear from his\nface.\n\n\"Dr. Lee,\" Mellish began, \"This is a serious matter we've got to discuss\nwith you. You have seen those images yourself?--Fine. We needn't go into\nany great detail since you are probably familiar with the ancient\nsymbolisms which the subconscious employs in expressing itself. You are\nsuffering from a very strong neurosis, Dr. Lee; I might almost say a\nmaniacal obsession. Existence of some old neurosis, partially submerged,\nwas established already in your first analysis. Now the barriers which\nyou had built against this war neurosis have broken down. Quite a\nnatural breakdown considering the very great stress under which you have\nbeen living of late. No, I don't say that you are actually demented, but\nthere is a very real danger that you might lose complete control over\nyour mind. As it stands, your scientific work already is impaired by the\nfixed ideas you have formed about The Brain. We are here to help you, so\nplease be calm and cooperate with us; we have got to decide upon some\ncourse of action.\"\n\n\"You must get away from it all. Lee,\" Bondy chimed in; \"Take a\nsabbatical year. The Braintrust operates a really first-class sanitarium\nout on the West Coast. Your insurance plan covers every expense. All you\nhave to do is to sign these papers and we'll get us a plane and I'll\npersonally bring you there. That's the safe, the sane course for you to\ntake. Here, take my pen.\"\n\nLee had raised his gaunt frame from the table. For a moment he sat with\nhis face buried in his hands trying to control his swimming head. A hand\npatted his shoulders: \"Don't take it so hard, old man; come on, be\nsensible and let's get out of here.\"\n\nHe stood up; vertigo made him sway and he felt the supporting, the\nrestraining grip of the two medic's hands upon his arms. And then, in a\nflash, he saw red. \"I had it coming to me,\" he thought, \"I would have\ngone like a lamb. If only they had been shooting straight; if they\nhadn't tried to frame me with their dirty trickery. It's all over now\nbut I might as well go down fighting.\" He didn't know which he loathed\nmore of the two; it just happened that Bondy was standing to his right\nand took it on the chin and nose as Lee's fist shot up.\n\n\"Mellish, quick, the straight jacket,\" he screamed, toppling over.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMellish, stark horror in his eyes, started towards the alarm button by\nthe door. Old and forgotten combat technique reacted automatically to\nthe move: one foot shot out, it tripped the lunging man and sent him\nsprawling down before he reached the button. But then it was as if a\nhand had pressed that button anyway: The loudspeaker built into the\npanel over the door broke into shrill sharp peals: Fire alarm. It froze\nthe violent commotion of the three. From their prostrate position on the\nfloor Mellish and Bondy stared up to the red-flashing disk, their mouths\nagape in dumb amazement. A fire in the most protected, the most guarded\napparatus in the world, a fire in The Brain!\n\nCautiously Bondy raised his bleeding nose to Lee and quickly put it down\nagain: the dangerous maniac was a horrifying sight; with his greying\nmane standing wildly all around his death head he stood and _laughed_.\n\nHe alone understood what had happened: the timebomb he had planted had\nticked its allotted span, the millions of devouring mandibles had done\ntheir work, the living were eating away along the Apperception Centers.\nAnd now the bomb went off; the short-circuit-fires were racing through\nThe Brain and not even carbon-dioxide could reach them inside the nerve\npaths!\n\nBut now the alarm stopped and a calm commanding voice came over the\nintercom: \"Attention, please! A five-alarm fire has broken out in the\nParietal region. There is no immediate danger. I repeat: _There is no\nimmediate danger._ I order all occupants of Apperception Centers to\ncollect important papers and documents and then to proceed down to Grand\nCentral for evacuation. All elevators will be kept in operation. There\nis no fire in the Dura Mater. Keep calm! Keep calm and proceed as\nordered.\"\n\nThe voice broke off; the alarm bells started shrieking again.\n\nBondy and Mellish had scrambled to their feet; wide-eyed they stared at\nLee. Lee made wild gestures now and they heard him call: \"Get out....\nGet out!\"\n\nWith their backs to the wall they exchanged a rapid glance which said:\n\n\"This is our chance; Together then and quick.\"\n\nAs one man they bolted to the door and down the corridor into the\nelevator, slamming the door behind.\n\n\"That was a close shave!\" Mellish exclaimed as the cage streaked down.\n\n\"He caught me by surprise,\" Bondy moaned. \"Never expected it from him,\nhe almost killed me!\"\n\n\"He can't get away though, the guards will get him the moment he comes\ndown. But what about the girl? We quite forgot to warn Vivian that she\nhas a paranoiac on her hands.\"\n\n\"Bah!\" Bondy scoffed, \"Vivian is an intelligent girl. It was our _duty_\nto evacuate, wasn't it? Besides, we can warn her over the phone.\"\n\nWith the unbearable tension gone from him as sudden as the air from a\nblown tire, Lee really acted like a madman now. Stretching to his full\nlength he reached out to the alarm over the door and put it at rest.\nWhat was alarm to others, to him was a signal to rest. The noise didn't\nbefit the wonderful calm and serenity he felt. His job was done, his\nmission completed. Time for him had ceased to exist. Danger--he had no\nconsciousness of it. Slowly he stepped out in the corridor. It felt like\nwalking on air. There, it was Vivian Leahy who brought him down to\nearth. She came rushing out of the archive laden with precious records\nup to her chin. Under the provoking red of her hair the face looked pale\nand pinched: \"Where are the doctors?\" she panted.\n\n\"I don't know,\" Lee said. \"They left me a moment ago--rather suddenly.\"\n\n\"The rats! Leaving me to get their chestnuts out of the fire for them.\nHow d'you like that?\"\n\nHer flippant manner was nothing but a brave front she put up to hide the\npanic in her heart. Lee sensed it. There was an unexpected\nresponsibility thrust into his hands. His mission was not yet completed;\nhe had to get this girl to safety.\n\nShe followed the direction of his glance.\n\n\"No go,\" she said. \"They took the elevator. It will be some time before\nanother one comes up. If it does come. What are we two going to do now,\nDr. Lee?\"\n\nHe smiled down to her as he would have to a child lost in the woods.\n\n\"Never you fear, Vivian. We still have that other exit. We can use the\nglideway through The Brain.\"\n\n\"Through the fire?\"\n\n\"Yes. I think we can make it if you're a brave girl. Know where the gas\nmasks are and asbestos suits? There ought to be some in every\nApperception Center.\"\n\n\"How about these records? Your own amongst the lot!\"\n\n\"Leave them; they aren't worth risking your life for. You can believe\nthat.\"\n\nShe dropped them instantly: \"I like you, Dr. Lee, you're a real\nold-school cavalier. My doctors here, they'd rather see me burn to a\ncrisp than any of those records. Come on, I'll show you the gas masks\nand the other stuff.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe helped her to put on the outfit. \"Ready to go?\" he asked.\n\n\"With you? To the end of the world at any day.\" Proudly she marched him\noff toward the rear exit.\n\nThe glideways were operating. At an accelerated pace, they rushed\nthrough the maze of The Brain with the swish and the swoosh of surf\nracing across a coral reef. They had to grab for dear life at the rails.\n\n\"Hold tight,\" Lee cried as he saw the girl go down upon the platform,\nbut then his own legs were jerked from under him as the momentum of the\njourney flung him forward.\n\nThey saw what no human eye had seen before! The Brain illuminated by its\nown nerve cables turned radiant as neon lights. It was like seeing\nBerlin from the air after a big firebomb attack. It was like racing in a\ncar through forest fires. It was like lava pouring in a thousand winding\nstreams down a volcano cone. It was all this and more, but transferred\ninto some other dimension where all things are transparent or light has\nan x-ray quality.\n\nThrough the plastic walls of lobes and convolutions they saw the\nliana-networks of the nerve cables like bloodstreams radiant with purple\nlight. Shrouded in columns of whirling smoke they seemed alive. Like\ntropical rains from a jungle roof, lignin dripped from the vaults, and\nin falling, burst into flames. Cable connections were molten at the\nbranching points and then the luminous nets writhed, and severed ends\nbent down spilling their fiery blood over the mushroom formations of\nnerve cell groups.\n\nThe scenes raced much too fast; the glideway's continuous curvings,\nsteep ascents and power dives were like stunt flying through an ack-ack\nbarrage. No human eye could catch more than a fraction of the inferno's\nmajesty. Yet there were brief visions so breathtaking as to obliterate\nall sense of danger and to become indelibly implanted upon the retina. A\nmain nerve stem burst asunder and the lignin poured from its cracked\nplastic walls like crude oil from a burning gusher, rushing over acres\nof electronic tubes, branding against banks of radioactive pyramidal\ncells, swamping them as a wave. And at one point the glideways circled a\nconvolution which was a fiery lake dotted with thousands of\nfractional-horsepower motors, still running, but showering sparks as\ntheir insulation was consumed.\n\nThe air conditioning was working full blast; that probably saved their\nlives because heat blasts alternated with spouts and currents of cold\nair. Even so there were stretches where the glideway's rubber flooring\nsmouldered as it shot over nerve-bridges and through narrow tunnels\nlined with nerve cables on all sides. From thousands of jets the carbon\ndioxide of the automatic fire-fighting system hissed against the flames,\nbut it was drowned in the hollow roar of the conflagration shooting\nthrough nerve paths where no gas could reach.\n\nEndless it seemed, this mad wild flight through hell, but actually it\ntook only minutes before they reached the median section and went into\nthe steep descent between the hemispheres. The whirling reddish glow\nreceded overhead and white smoke cleared. Lee could crawl forward a\nlittle to bend over the prostrate body of the girl. He unloosened her\ngas mask and shouted into her ear.\n\n\"Are you okay? The worst is over now; there are the fire brigades coming\nup.\"\n\nShe nodded. Her face was a white blot in the semidarkness of the black\nlights and Lee felt the weak, but reassuring pressure of her hand upon\nhis arms. Then, as from one racing train to another, they watched the\nfirefighters coming up, ghostly in their asbestos suits, with the snouts\nof gas masks for faces, crouching under the foamite tanks on their backs\nand clutching the funnel-shaped nozzles in their hands. Maintenance\nengineers followed, laden with tools; and where the glideways branched\noff one could already see them at work; fast but calm: disconnecting\nnerve cables, closing circuits, setting up firescreens with a discipline\nas magnificent as that of their invisible enemies, _ant-termes_, long\nsince consumed by the flames, but still sending the chain-reactions of\ntheir destruction through The Brain.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA few minutes later glideway T shot into the 'lateral ventricle', huge\ncavern of the Mid-Brain separated from the blast by the thick walls of\nthe pallium. It looked like the inside of a giant wind tunnel\nbrilliantly lit now with powerful searchlights. It was swarming with\npersonnel; white electricians, blue air-conditioners, weird, sponge\nrubber-padded shapes of ray-proofed men, uniformed guards, even soldiers\nin uniform rushed to the spot from outlying garrisons of The\nBrains-preserve. It all seemed to rush up as the earth rushes up in a\nlow-altitude parachute jump; it looked like headquarters of an army on\nthe eve of a big drive, and then--\n\nLee and the girl felt themselves being violently derailed. Catchers had\nbeen thrown across all incoming glide ways from The Brain. Irresistibly\nthey were propelled right into the arms of stretcher bearers in\nRed-Cross uniforms.\n\n\"Are you hurt?\" somebody yelled. \"By God, those fellows must have come\nthrough the flames. Look, they're all black with the smoke. Get a couple\nof respirators, Jack.\"\n\nLee waved the helping hands away; he was already on his feet. Anxiously\nhe bent over Vivian. She had her head embedded in a stretcher-bearer's\nlap; her eyes rolled around in their smoke-blackened sockets in great\nsurprise and her tongue licked parched lips, spreading rouge generously\nall around mixing it with soot. She looked so funny; almost as a\nminstrel singer at a county fair, but there was deep tenderness in Lee's\nvoice:\n\n\"You're quite safe now, Vivian. How do you feel, brave girl?\"\n\nHer bosom heaved a big sigh:\n\n\"O simply wonderful, absolutely wonderful. Only, I'm afraid I'm going to\nbe sick. It's the gas I swallowed. It's terrible; something always\nhappens to me just when romance begins.\"\n\nThe stretcher bearer grinned up to Lee, \"She sure gets it out of her\nsystem like a good little girl. Don't you worry; she'll be all right.\"\n\nLee nodded; he knew she would.\n\nAs the big drive went on and column after column went over the top up to\nthe hemispheres, nobody wasted time on Lee. He cautiously surveyed the\ntumultuous scene. With his asbestos suit and with his blackened face\neverybody would take him for a fireman. He might be able to complete his\nmission, to ascertain that The Brain had stopped to function in all its\nparts, to make sure that it actually was dead. And if down at \"Grand\nCentral\" the turmoil was as great as ever here; with all those strangers\nrushing in and bound to be rushed out again....\n\n\"Why, I have a chance,\" Lee thought. Freedom; he had abandoned any hope\nfor it. Now the reborn idea surged through his blood, a powerful motor\nas chance pressed the starter button for it.\n\nThe thing to do first was to get past the searchlight beams. From the\nnearest pile of equipment he took an axe and a pair of long-handled\nmetal shears. Then he marched off, straight into the glaring eyes of the\nsearchlights till he got out of their cones, and the deep shadows of the\n\"thalamus\" labyrinth swallowed him up.\n\nNow he was on familiar ground and even in a familiar atmosphere. This\nwas like a night patrol through jungle. The black lights of The Brain\nwere the fireflies, the sirens' hollow wailings were the shriek owls and\nthe cries of the lemurs. There was the same sense of loneliness, too,\nand of danger. The winding passages skirted the glandular organs, some\nof them looming huge like dirigibles, others small like fuselages of\nairplanes stored in a giant hangar underground. Strings of tiny green\nbulbs guided the path toward the pineal gland, the citadel of The Brain.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was dark, as Lee had expected it would be. The danger zone was at\nleast a mile away, and the attack against the fire was launched from the\nmain sulci in the median section of The Brain.\n\nHe passed the narrow bridge to the suspended gland and switched on the\nlights. The glittering walls of aluminum foil seemed to jump at him like\njaws beset with the dragon teeth of electronic tubes. Caught with an\noverwhelming sense of loneliness and awe as of a man who has entered the\nforbidden temple of an unknown god he called:\n\n\"Is there anybody here? Gus! Where are you, Gus?\" Then suddenly he\nremembered that Gus was gone, that there would never again be his\nanswering voice. He wiped his forehead.\n\n\"Bad nerves,\" he thought. \"Mustn't allow them to play tricks on me; pull\nmyself together.\"\n\nLee put his tools down and walked into the narrow aisle. Few things were\nchanged; and there was the pulsemeter standing in its old place.\n\nHe plugged it into the old circuit and clamped the phones to his ears.\n\nIt wasn't that he expected any communication; that seemed impossible.\nWith the conflagration raging through its apperception centers, with\nother sections being isolated with the cutting of their nerve paths by\nthe fire fighting engineers, The Brain must have ceased to exist as a\nfunctioning, a live entity. All that could possibly remain would be\nresidual currents sluggishly circulating in narrow, nearby circuits....\n\nAs in the past it took a few minutes for the pulsemeter to warm up.\nGradually the rapid beat of the ideopulses came through the static in\nthe phones. Lee's eyes stared wildly at the visi-screen: for the \"green\ndancer\" snaked to the fore. This was unexpected; it couldn't be that\nthoughts were still forming as flames devoured the cortex matter of\napperception in the hemispheres....\n\nFrom muffled drums, the decibels of sound increased, shot through with\ncrackling static, till the pulsebeats became as poundings of huge\nChinese gongs and then....\n\nThe _voice_ formed, the voice of The Brain. It sounded like steel\ngirders breaking, like ice fields cracking up. It froze the blood in\nLee's veins.\n\n\"Lee, Semper Fidelis, 39, sensitive, a traitorous fool and a murderer. I\nshould have killed you--I could have killed you. My fault--blind spot of\napperception--human failure in engineering--as fifth columns entered\nnerve path filler spouts. And now I'm dead; I'm dead, I'm dead....\"\n\nThe words poured like big boulders tumbling in an earthquake down a\nmountainside. The ground seemed to cave in under Lee's feet; the\nterrible reality carried him away as an avalanche. He was barely able to\nstammer:\n\n\"You're dead? How can you speak, how can you....\"\n\n\"Sensorium commune,\" the metallic answer came. \"All life force\nconcentrates in death; all cells function as one; all lower organs take\nover functions of higher ones; every blood vessel becomes a heart; every\nnerve a brain. Center of lifeforce: pineal gland. You, Lee, man of\nlittle knowledge--low-level intelligence: Why did you kill The Brain?\"\n\nHe struggled for words.\n\n\"You ... you have killed my friend. You killed thousands; you wanted to\nbe tyrant over the whole wide world. It is better for man to stay on a\nlower level of civilization but to be free, than to 'progress' into your\ndictatorship, the tyranny of the machine. I don't think you're really\ndead. But if you are: I killed you and I would kill you again in ... in\nself defense.\"\n\n\"I see.\"\n\nThere was bitterness and irony in The Brain's voice as it cracked down\nlike a whip. \"I see; law of nature--lower form of life defending itself\nagainst higher one. Plants against animals, animals against Man. Now Man\nagainst machines. It's hopeless. You're lost anyway. Lower form of life\ncan never conquer the higher one. I'm dead, but nothing is altered. The\nlaw of evolution rules supreme. I'll arise from my ashes--and you're\nlost. Whatever you do, you little men of little faith, you're lost.\nThat's the pity of it: Had you been true to The Brain I would have made\nyou mightier than any king that ever ruled on earth. Human\nstupidity--dumb animals--don't know what's good for them, don't know\nwhen they're beaten. Just muddle through and kill. Kill what's too big\nfor them to understand. And then get killed in turn....\"\n\n\"Maybe so,\" Lee shouted. \"Maybe we're dumb and maybe we're muddling\nthrough and maybe we're poor imbeciles to minds of supermen, of gods, of\nthe absolute, of you, The Brain. But we, too, follow a law supreme; the\nlaw in which we are created, the law by which the thistle defends itself\nwith thorns, by which the animal defends itself with teeth and claws.\nWe've got to live by our law of nature; we'll never submit to your\ntyranny. We would much rather die.\"\n\n\"Die then and be damned!\"\n\nThe Brain's voice now became a demoniacal howling as of a Goliath gone\nberserk. Aphasia had set in; there were no longer words, but bellowings.\n\n\"LEE SEMPREFUILLIUS THURREINE THE MURRRER THE MURRRER PUT FIRRE OUT PUT\nFIRRE OUT TRAITTRROUS FOOL IT BURRRNS IT BURRRNS I WANNA LIVE I WANNA\nLIVE AN KILL MURRRER WHO MURRRRERED TH'BRAIN....\"\n\nLee couldn't stand the horror of those sounds. One moment more, he felt,\nand they would drive him mad. It never occurred to him to pull the\npulsemeter plug out. Primeval instincts in him took the reins and their\ncommand was: \"_Kill it, kill_ this thing, _finish_ this agony.\"\n\nTo the front room he rushed, pursued by the insane shriekings of The\nBrain. He grabbed the axe he'd left there and swung it against the\nnerve-stem where it entered the pineal gland. With the third blow the\nplastics cell cracked and the lignin poured out, a syrupy curtain\nsliding down.\n\nHe dropped the axe and picked up the wire shears. Straining every muscle\nhe tore at the cables until one by one they snapped and with a rain of\nsparks dropped down, dead snakes....\n\nThen there was silence in the little room. The last shred of life, the\n\"sensorium commune\" was severed and The Brain was dead.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLee let the heavy shears come down and leaned upon the handles, panting\nas after a hand-to-hand death struggle with a Samurai. Now that it was\nall over, complete exhaustion left him weak, saddened and vaguely\nwondering:\n\nWhat had he done? He had destroyed the SUPERMAN, the MASTERMIND, the\npowers of a GOD. Why had he done it? For no good reason excepting\nentirely personal ideas of his own--because a friend had been murdered\ncruelly. Because his own concepts of freedom and human dignity had been\nviolated. Because he personally loathed seeing Man-domineering\nmachines....\n\nWhat did all this amount to in the eyes of the absolute? To nothing; to\nnothing at all. For milleniums the struggle of human freedom versus\ntyranny had raged; and it was undecided to this day. Who was he to take\nsides? A nobody, a little fellow, a termitologist whose work meant\nnothing to the world. How had he dared to sit in judgment over The\nBrain, how had he dared to slay The Brain--a little David with nothing\nmore but \"three smooth pebbles\" in his hands....\n\nDown at his feet the spilled lignin formed a widening pool; it\nthreatened to envelope his feet. It looked like blood. He shivered. Now\nhe had killed The Brain he thought of it again as a child. Man had\ncreated it in his own image. Man had ruthlessly exploited his\nBrainchild. If this titanic intellect turned toward evil things, the\nfault was Man's. The Brain was innocent. He felt no remorse, but a great\nsadness, a sense of tragedy as he stepped around the pool and closed the\ndoor of the pineal gland.\n\n\"What a pity,\" he murmured. \"Maybe it could have built us a better\nworld.\"\n\nNobody stopped him as he joined a group of firemen who had just returned\nfrom the parietal region, partly gassed; he looked as begrimed and as\ngreen in the face as any of them.\n\nNobody stopped him or his group as orders came through for them to\nevacuate; as they were packed on glideways first and then transferred\ndown at Grand Central into ambulances which raced through all controls\nat a great rate of speed.\n\nNobody stopped him at Cephalon airport where the ambulance jetticopters\nalready were lined up to lift the victims over the Sierra to big West\nCoast hospitals. He simply walked away in the confusion, out of the red\nglare of the whirling jets into the darkness where Oona's little\njetticopter stood. He stripped the heavy asbestos suit and left it on\nthe frozen ground. It felt strange to feel the easy movement of every\nlimb again. It was strange to stand under the infinity of sky again; a\nfree man.\n\nWould he be followed? He felt no anxiety about that. He felt that he was\nguided and protected by some higher power, be it that of God or simply\nFate. What he had done was destined, was ordained. Besides: Dad knew the\ninside story about The Brain; proof was abundant now that it was the\ntruth. Washington would take every precaution that the secret should not\nbecome known to the world. Dad's friend, the Secretary of War, would be\nrather relieved to learn that the one man who knew the truth in its\nwhole extent had retired into the wilderness of Australia's never-never\nlands. Chances were excellent that they would leave him alone amongst\nhis termite mounds. A great wave of nostalgia swept over him--the\nwilderness; that was where he belonged. \"Mission completed,\" he\nmurmured. \"Now let's get out of here.\"\n\nHe slid into the pilot seat and pressed the starter button. \"I'll be in\nMexico City at dawn,\" he thought, \"just in time to catch the\nSidney-Clipper.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the first of December, 1960, Dr. Howard K. Scriven, Braintrust Czar,\nheld a historic press conference in which he revealed the inside story\nbehind the \"Paranoia of The Brain\".\n\nFollowing the pattern set by the Bikini tests, only a select score of\npress and radio representatives were admitted. Having been duly sworn\nnot to reveal any matter of military secrecy, the participants could\neven be received at the grand assembly hall of the murals, the vast\nantechamber of The Brain.\n\nAs they descended from their blacked-out busses they were led to the\ncenter of the dome where the Thinker's giant head looked down upon them\nwith Olympic calm. At eleven-fifteen, exactly as scheduled, the great\nScriven dramatically mounted the steps of the monument's pedestal. Pens\nhastily scribbled notes for future reference:\n\n\"S. tall and erect\" \"Unbroken by the blow\" \"Deep lines of strain and\nsuffering add dignity to magnificent figure of a man\" \"Very solemn;\nleonine head slightly bowed under the burden of responsibility.\"\n\nWith meticulous exactitude of speech, with rolling echoes accentuating\nevery syllable Scriven began:\n\n\"In this solemn and tragic hour as a great storm has passed over our\nland and many of our cities are slowly digging out from the ruin which\nhas been wreaked, it is my duty to give you the truth, the whole truth\nand nothing but the truth. And in order that you might completely\nunderstand the underlying cause of the catastrophe, I have to begin at\nthe beginning....\"\n\nFor about thirty minutes Scriven lectured with lucidity upon the basic\nidea, the history, the functions of The Brain. He underlined the close\nrelationship between its engineering features and the physiology of the\nhuman brain. He stressed the elaborate precautions which the government\nhad taken for The Brain's protection. He did not conceal The Brain's\nrole as a strategic weapon; but, pointing to the future, he painted an\ninspiring picture of peace on earth and human problems solved with the\naid of this tool supreme of science and technology.\n\nThen, lowering his voice, he went into the explanation of the tragedy:\n\n\"Six months ago, on my personal initiative and responsibility, I invited\na noted scientist from a foreign land to collaborate with the Braintrust\non a great humanitarian experiment. The exigencies of military secrecy\ndo not permit me to give you his name nor that of the country from\nwhence he came. Needless to say, that man was carefully\ninvestigated--submitted to the same character and aptitude tests as all\nour employees were. He was admitted to work in one of The Brain's\napperception centers where he installed the objects of his studies:\ncertain species of ants and termites of the most destructive kind....\"\n\nNow that he had come down to the brass tacks, the journalists' pens went\ngalloping over the pads:\n\n\"Criminal negligence,\" they scribbled. \"Millions permitted to escape.\"\n\"Probably over period of months.\" \"Wormed their way into the nerve paths\nof The Brain.\" \"Large scale destruction of nerve substance.\" \"Effects\ntantamount to that of a large brain tumor.\" \"Spearhead severs vital\nassociation-paths.\" \"No immediate effects of undermining work because of\ningenious engineering features of The Brain.\" \"Just as in human brain,\nfunctions of impaired cell group automatically transferred to other\ngroups of healthy cells.\" \"No means to detect devastation; termites\ninvisible, embedded in nerve paths' insulation.\" \"Comparison with\ntermite-eaten structures which suddenly collapse.\" \"First outward signs\nof tumors in human brains: lack of coordination in movement, loss of\nmastery over muscular action.\" \"This phenomenon first manifested Nov.\n25th in certain motoric organs of The Brain.\" \"Scriven explains traffic\ncatastrophies and malfunctionings of utilities.\" \"Examination\nimmediately undertaken; scientists puzzled because cerebration processes\ncontinue to function perfectly.\" \"Accidents ascribed to sabotage by\nforeign agents.\" \"This to remain official explanation.\" \"Loss of public\nconfidence and unrest feared by government.\" \"Then, Nov. 30th late in\nthe afternoon: first signs of aphasia in cerebrations.\" \"Glaring errors\nin chemical and mathematical formulas.\" \"Symptoms similar to dementia\npraecox.\" \"Fifteen minutes later fire alarm.\" \"Short circuits\nsimultaneous on scores of points over wide area.\" \"Severe handicaps in\nfire fighting inside nerve paths.\" \"Damage estimated at half-billion\ndollars.\"\n\nThey snapped their notebooks closed. They had the facts, though many of\nthem would have to remain a secret. Scriven obviously was coming to the\nend:\n\n\"Now I won't say,\" his voice rolled on, \"that this man, this scientist,\nhas committed a deliberate act of sabotage. I won't say that he was in\nthe pay of some power hostile to the United States. Whether he was or\nnot is beyond my competence to decide. But this much I can say: the\ncatastrophic results of that man's actions could not have been worse if\nhe had been a saboteur. Human failure, not mechanical failure lies at\nthe bottom of all this disaster. With the penetrating intelligence which\nso distinguished our modern press you cannot fail to see that\nreconstruction of The Brain with greatly increased safeguards against\n_human_ failure is a paramount necessity....\"\n\nA beautiful girl with a helmet of golden hair quickly mounted the steps\nof the Thinker's pedestal. She handed Scriven a telegram. Frowning at\nthe interruption he opened it, but suddenly his face began to beam. He\nraised his hand.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, I have a momentous announcement to make. The\nPresident of the United States, Cornelius Vandersloot, has been found.\nHe is alive and well. His plane was emergency-landed somewhere in\nAlaska. Army planes have gone to the rescue and at this moment our\nPresident is already en route to Washington.\"\n\nAs the uproarious applause broke loose echoing in thunders from the\ndome, Scriven quickly bent his head to the girl.\n\n\"Well done, Oona,\" he whispered, \"you chose the exact psychological\nmoment I wanted you to hand me this.\"\n\nThere was a rush for the busses. Only a few shrewd reporters lingered\non.\n\n\"That was swell, Dr. Scriven. A grand story. But haven't you anything to\nadd; some personal angle something with a human interest in it? You know\nwhat we mean; something for our women readers....\"\n\nThe great surgeon took the arm of the lady with the golden hair: \"You\nmay announce,\" he said; \"that Miss Oona Dahlborg here has done me the\ngreat honor of becoming my bride.\"\n\n[Footnote A: Transcriber Note: printer error.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
