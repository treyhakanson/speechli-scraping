Y._\n\n    Printed in the United States of America\n\n\n\n\n_One_\n\n\nThe moment arrived when Terry Holt realized that he was simply holding\nthe bag for Jimenez y C\u00eda.--Jimenez and Company--in the city of Manila.\nHe wasn't getting anywhere, himself. So, painfully, he prepared to wind\nup the company's affairs and his own, and start over. It seemed\nappropriate to take inventory, consult the police--they'd been both\namiable and co-operative--and then make new plans. But first it would be\na good idea to go somewhere else for a while, until the problem\npresented by _La Rubia_ and radar and fish and _orejas de ellos_ had\nbeen settled. He was at work on the inventory when the door opened, the\nwarning-bell tinkled, and the girl came into the shop.\n\nHe looked up with a wary eye, glancing over the partition separating the\nworkshop area in which the merchandise sold by Jimenez y C\u00eda. was\nassembled. There were certain people he felt should not come into the\nshop. The police agreed with him. He was prepared to throw out anybody\nwho came either to demand that he build something or else, or to demand\nthat he not build it or else. In such forcible ejections he would be\nbacked by the authorities of the city and the Philippine Republic.\n\nBut this customer was a girl. She was a pretty girl. She was pleasantly\ntanned. Her make-up, if she wore any, looked natural, and she carried a\nsizable parcel under her arm. She turned to close the door behind her.\nShe was definitely from the United States. So Terry said in English,\n\"Good afternoon. Can I do something for you?\"\n\nShe looked relieved.\n\n\"Ah! We can talk English,\" she said gratefully. \"I was afraid I'd have\ntrouble. I do have trouble with Spanish.\"\n\nTerry came out from behind the partition marking off the workshop. The\nshop was seventeen feet wide and its larger expanse of plate glass said,\n\"_Jimenez y C\u00eda._\" in large letters. Terry's now-vanished partner\nJimenez had liked to see his name in large print. Under the name was the\nline \"_Especialidades Electr\u00f3nicas y F\u00edsicas._\" This was Terry's angle.\nHe assembled specialties in the line of electronics and modern physics.\nJimenez had sold them, not wisely but too well. At the bottom corner of\nthe window there was a modest statement: \"_Orejas de Ellos_,\" which\nmeant nothing to anybody but certain commercial fishermen, all of whom\nwould deny it.\n\nThe girl looked dubiously about her. The front of the shop displayed two\nglaringly white electric washing machines, four electric refrigerators,\nand two deep-freeze cabinets.\n\n\"But I'm not sure this is the right shop,\" she said. \"I'm not looking\nfor iceboxes.\"\n\n\"They're window-dressing,\" said Terry. \"My former business associate\ntried to run an appliance shop. But the people who buy such things in\nManila only want the latest models. He got stuck with these from last\nyear. So we do--I did do--_especialidades electr\u00f3nicas y f\u00edsicas_. But\nI'm shutting up shop. What are you looking for?\"\n\nThe shop was in an appropriate place for its former products. Outside on\nthe Calle Enero there were places where one could buy sea food in\nquantity, mother-of-pearl, pitch, coir rope, b\u00eache-de-mer, copra, fuel\noil, Diesel repair-parts and edible birds' nests. _Especialidades_\nfitted in. But though it was certainly respectable enough, this\nneighborhood wasn't exactly where one would have expected to find a girl\nlike this shopping for what a girl like this would shop for.\n\n\"I'm looking,\" she explained, \"for somebody to make up a special device,\nprobably electronic, for my father's boat.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Terry regretfully. \"That's my line exactly, as is evidenced\nin Spanish on the window and in Tagalog, Malay and Chinese on cards you\ncan read through the glass. But I'm suspending operations for a while.\nWhat kind of special device? Radar--No. I doubt you'd want _orejas de\nellos_....\"\n\n\"What are they?\"\n\n\"Submarine ears,\" said Terry. \"For fishing boats. The name is no clue at\nall. They pick up underwater sounds, enabling one to hear surf a long\nway off. Which may be useful. And some fish make noises and the\nfishermen use these ears to eavesdrop on them and catch them. You\nwouldn't be interested in anything of that sort!\"\n\nThe girl brightened visibly.\n\n\"But I am! Something very much like it, at any rate. Take a look at this\nand see what my father wants to have made.\"\n\nShe put her parcel on a deep-freeze unit and pulled off its paper\ncovering. The object inside was a sort of curved paddle with a handle at\none end. It was about three feet long, made of a light-colored fibrous\nwood, and on the convex part of its curvature it was deeply carved in\npeculiar transverse ridges.\n\n\"A fish-driving paddle,\" she explained. \"From Alua.\"\n\nHe looked it over. He knew vaguely that Alua was an island somewhere\nnear Bohol.\n\n\"Naturally a fish-driving paddle is used to drive fish,\" she said.\n\"To--herd them, you might say. People go out in shallow water and form a\nline. Then they whack paddles like these on the surface of the water.\nFish try to get away from the sound and the people herd them where they\nwant them--into fish-traps, usually. I've tried this, while wearing a\nbathing suit. It makes your skin tingle--smart, rather. It's a sort of\npins-and-needles sensation. Fish would swim away from an underwater\nnoise like that!\"\n\nTerry examined the carving.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Of course we think there's something special about the noise these\npaddles make. Maybe a special wave-form?\"\n\n\"Possibly,\" he admitted. \"But--\"\n\n\"We want something else to do the same trick on a bigger scale.\nDirectional, if possible. Not a paddle, of course. Better. Bigger.\nStronger. Continuous. We want to drive fish and this paddle's limited in\nits effect.\"\n\n\"Why drive fish?\" asked Terry.\n\n\"Why not?\" asked the girl. She watched his face.\n\nHe frowned a little, considering the problem the girl posed.\n\n\"Oh, _ellos_ might object,\" he said absently.\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"_Ellos_,\" he repeated. \"It's a superstition. The word means 'they' or\n'them.' Things under the ocean who listen to the fish and the\nfishermen.\"\n\n\"You're not serious.\" It was a statement.\n\n\"No,\" he admitted, still eying the paddle. \"But the modern, businesslike\nfishermen who buy submarine ears for sound business reasons call them\n_orejas de ellos_ and everybody knows what they mean, even in the\nmodernized fishing fleet.\"\n\n\"Which,\" said the girl, \"Jimenez y C\u00eda. has had a big hand in\nmodernizing. That's why I came to you. Your name is Terry Holt, I think.\nAn American Navy Captain said you could make what my father wants.\"\n\nTerry nodded suddenly to himself.\n\n\"What you want,\" he said abruptly, \"might be done with a tape-recorder,\na submarine ear, and an underwater horn. You'd make a tape-recording of\nwhat these whackings sound like under water, edit the tape to make the\nwhackings practically continuous, and then play the tape through an\nunderwater horn to reproduce the sounds at will. That should do the\ntrick.\"\n\n\"Good! How soon can you do it?\" she asked.\n\n\"I'm afraid not at all,\" said Terry. \"I find I've been a little too\nefficient in updating the fishing fleet. I'm leaving the city for the\ncity's good.\"\n\nShe looked at him inquiringly.\n\n\"No,\" he assured her. \"The police haven't asked me to leave. They're\nglad I'm going, but they're cordial enough and it's agreed that I'll\ncome back when somebody else finds out how _La Rubia_ catches her fish.\"\n\n\"_La Rubia?_\"\n\n\"_The Redhead_,\" he told her. \"It's the name of a fishing boat. She's\nfound some place where fish practically fight to get into her nets. For\nmonths, now, she's come back from every trip loaded down gunwale-deep.\nAnd she makes her trips fast! Naturally the other fishermen want to get\nin on the party.\"\n\n\"So?\"\n\n\"The bonanza voyages,\" Terry explained, \"started immediately after _La\nRubia_ had submarine ears installed. Immediately all the other boats\ninstalled them. My former partner sold them faster than I could assemble\nthem. And nobody regrets them. They do increase the catches. But they\ndon't match _La Rubia_. She's making a mint of money! She's found some\nplace or she has some trick that loads her down deep every time she puts\nout to sea.\"\n\nThe girl made an interrogative sound.\n\n\"The other fishermen think it's a place,\" Terry added, \"so they ganged\nup on her. Two months back, when she sailed, the entire fishing fleet\ntrailed her. They stuck to her closer than brothers. So she sailed\naround for a solid week and never put a net overboard. Then she came\nback to Manila--empty. They were furious. The price of fish had gone\nsky-high in their absence. They went to sea to make some money\nregardless. When they got back they found _La Rubia_ had sailed after\nthey left, got back before they returned--and she was just loaded with\nfish, and the market was back to normal. There was bad feeling. There\nwere fights. Some fishermen landed in the hospital and some in jail.\"\n\nA motor truck rolled by on the street outside the shop of the now\nmoribund Jimenez y C\u00eda. The girl automatically turned her eyes to the\nsource of the noise. Then she looked back at Terry.\n\n\"And then my erstwhile associate Jimenez had a brainstorm,\" said Terry\nruefully. \"He sold the skipper of _La Rubia_ on the idea of short-range\nradar. I built a set for him. It was good for possibly twenty miles. So\n_La Rubia_ sailed in the dark of the moon with fifty fishing boats\nswearing violent oaths that they'd follow her to hell-and-gone. When\nnight fell _La Rubia_ put out her lights, used her radar to locate the\nother boats who couldn't see her, and sneaked out from their midst. She\ncame back loaded down with fish. There were more fights and more men in\nthe hospital and in jail. Some of _La Rubia's_ men boasted that they'd\nused radar to dodge their rivals. And that's how the police got\ninterested in me.\"\n\nThe girl had listened interestedly.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Oh, Jimenez began to take orders for radar from other fishing boat\nowners. If _La Rubia_ could dodge them by radar, they could trail her by\nradar even in the dark. So the skipper and crew of _La Rubia_ promised\nblood-curdling things as Jimenez's fate if he delivered a radar set to\nanybody else. Then the skippers and crews of other boats made even more\nblood-curdling threats if he didn't deliver radar to them. So Jimenez\nran away, leaving me to hold the bag.\"\n\nThe girl nodded.\n\n\"And therefore,\" said Terry, \"I'm shutting up shop. I'll turn the\ninventory over to the police and go off somewhere until someone learns\nwhere _La Rubia_ gets her fish. When things calm down again, I'll come\nback and start up business once more--without Jimenez. I'll probably\nstick to electric-eye doors, burglar alarms, closed-circuit television\nsystems and things like that. Then I might make this underwater\nbroadcasting device, if your father still wants it. I'd better not now.\"\n\n\"We heard about your problem,\" said the girl. \"Almost exactly the way\nyou just explained it.\"\n\nTerry stared. Then he said politely, \"Oh. You did?\"\n\n\"Yes, I thought--\"\n\n\"Then you knew,\" said Terry more politely still, \"that I was leaving\ntown and couldn't make the gadget you want? You knew it before you came\nhere?\"\n\n\"Why,\" said the girl, \"your plans seemed to fit in very nicely with\nours. We've got a sixty-five-foot schooner and we're sailing around. My\nfather wants something like--what you described. So since you want\nto--well--travel around for a time, why not come on board our boat and\nmake the thing we want there? We'll land you anywhere you like when it's\nfinished.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" said Terry with very great politeness indeed. \"I think I made\na fool of myself, explaining. You knew it all beforehand. I'm afraid I\nbored you horribly. You probably even know that Jimenez took all the\nfunds when he ran away.\"\n\nShe hesitated, and then said, \"Y-yes. We thought--\"\n\n\"That I should have trouble raising steamer-fare to any place at all,\"\nhe said without cordiality. \"And I will. You had that information too,\ndidn't you?\"\n\n\"Please!\" she said with distress. \"You make it sound--\"\n\n\"Did you have any idea what I'd charge to assemble the device you want?\"\n\n\"If you'll name a price.\"\n\nTerry named one. He was angry. The sum was far from a small one. It was,\nin fact, exorbitant. But he felt that he'd made a fool of himself,\nresponding to her encouragement by telling her things she already knew.\n\nShe opened her purse and peeled off bills. She put them down.\n\n\"I'll leave the paddle with you,\" she said crisply. \"Our boat is the\n_Esperance_. You'll find it....\" She named the anchorage, which was that\nof Manila's most expensive yacht club. \"There's a launch which will\nbring you out whenever you're ready to sail. It would be nice if you\ncould sail tomorrow--and nicer if you could come aboard today.\"\n\nShe nodded in friendly fashion, opened the door--the bell jangled--and\nwent out.\n\nTerry blinked. Then he swore and snatched up the pile of bills. Two\nfluttered to the floor and he lost time picking them up. He went out\nafter her, the money in his hand.\n\nHe saw a taxicab door close behind her, three or four doors down the\nstreet. Instantly the cab was in mad career away. The taxicabs of Manila\nare driven by a special breed of chauffeurs. It is said that they are\nall escaped lunatics with homicidal tendencies. The cab went roaring\ndown the Calle Enero's cluttered length and turned the corner.\n\nTerry went back to the shop. He swore again. He looked at the money in\nhis hand. It totalled exactly the excessive amount he'd named as the\nprice of an electronic fish-driving unit, including an underwater horn.\n\n\"The devil!\" he said angrily.\n\nHe felt the special indignation some men feel when they are in\ndifficulties which their pride requires them to surmount by themselves,\nand somebody tries to help. The indignation is the greater as they see\nless chance of success on their own.\n\nTerry's situation was offensive to him because he shouldn't be in this\nkind of situation at all, or rather, his troubles were not foreseeable\nby the most competent of graduate electronic engineers. He'd trained for\nthe work he'd undertaken. He'd prepared himself for competence. At\ngraduation he'd encountered the representatives of at least three large\ncorporations who were snapping up engineers as soon as they left the\ncloistered halls of learning. Terry'd asked how many men were employed\nin the category he'd fit in. When one representative boasted that ten\nthousand such engineers were on his company's payroll, Terry declined at\nonce. He wanted to accomplish something himself, not as part of a team\nof some thousands of members. The smaller the organization, the better\none's chance for personal satisfaction. He wouldn't make as much money,\nbut--\n\nIt was a matter of simple logic. If he was better off with a really\nsmall company, he'd be best off on his own. And he'd nearly managed it.\nHe'd worked only with Jimenez. Jimenez was the sales organization. Terry\nwas the production staff. In Manila there was certainly room for special\nelectronic equipment--_especialidades electr\u00f3nicas y f\u00edsicas_. He should\nhave had an excellent chance to build up a good business. Starting\nsmall, even without capital, he'd confidently expected to be going\nstrong within months. There were taxi fleets to be equipped with\nshort-wave radio. There were burglar alarms to be designed and\ninstalled, and all sorts of setups to be engineered. And these things\nwere still in demand. His expectations had a solid foundation. Nobody\ncould have anticipated the disaster caused by _La Rubia's_ phenomenal\nsuccess in commercial fishery. It was even irrational for it to be a\ndisaster to Terry. But it was.\n\nMore immediately, though, he was indignant because this girl had known\nall about him when she came into the shop. She'd probably even known\nabout his gimmicking a standard-design submarine listening device so it\nwas really good and really directional. But she'd let him talk, asking\nseemingly interested questions, when she knew the whole business\nbeforehand. And at the end she'd done a most infuriating thing by paying\nhim in advance for something he'd refused to do, thereby forcing him\ninto the obligation to do it.\n\nHe fretted. He needed the money. But he objected to being tricked. He\nwent back to the probably senseless business of taking an inventory.\nTime passed. Nothing happened. Nobody came to the shop. The police had\nbeen firm about _La Rubia_ crewmen calling on Terry to make threats.\nThey'd been equally firm about other people calling to make\ncounterthreats. No casual customers entered. Two hours went by.\n\nAt four o'clock the door opened--with the sound of its tinkling\nbell--and Police Captain Felicio Horta came in.\n\n\"_Buenas tardes_,\" he said cordially.\n\nTerry grunted at him.\n\n\"I hear,\" said Horta, \"that you leave Manila.\"\n\nTerry asked evenly, \"Is that a way of asking me to hurry up and do it?\"\n\n\"_Pero no! Por supuesto no!_\" protested Horta. \"But it is said that you\nhave new and definite plans.\"\n\n\"What do you know about them?\" demanded Terry.\n\nPolice Captain Horta said pleasantly, \"Officially, nothing. Privately,\nthat you will aid some _ricos americanos_ to do experiments\nin--_oceanograf\u00eda_? Some study of oceanic things. That you regret having\nagreed to do so. That you consider changing your mind. That you are\nangry.\"\n\nThe girl, of course, could have inferred all this from his angry charge\nout of the shop with the money in his hand, too late to stop her\ntaxicab. But Terry snapped, \"Now, who the devil told you that?\"\n\nPolice Captain Horta shrugged.\n\n\"One hears. I hope it is not true.\"\n\n\"That what's not true? That I leave? Or that I don't?\"\n\n\"I hope,\" said Horta benignly, \"that you do as you please. I am not on\nduty at the moment. I have my car. I offer myself to chauffeur you if\nthere is any place you wish to go--to a steamer or anywhere else. If\nyou do not wish to go anywhere, I will take my leave. With no pre ...\nprejudice,\" he finished. \"We have been friendly. I hope we remain so.\"\n\nTerry stared at him estimatingly. Police Captain Horta was a reasonable\nand honest man. He knew that Terry had contributed to matters giving the\npolice some trouble, but he knew it was accidental on Terry's part. He\nwould hold no grudge.\n\n\"Just why,\" asked Terry measuredly, \"did you come here to offer to drive\nme somewhere? Is there any special reason to want me to get out of\ntown?\"\n\n\"That is not it,\" said Horta. \"It could be wished that you would--take a\ncertain course of action. Yes. But not because you would be absent from\nhere. It is because you would be present at a special other place. The\nmatter connects with _La Rubia_, but in a manner you could not possibly\nguess. Yet you are wholly a free agent. You will do as you please. I\nwould like to make it--convenient. That is all.\"\n\nHe paused. Terry stared at him, frowning. Horta tried again.\n\n\"Let us say that I have much interest in _oceanograf\u00eda_. I would like to\nsee certain research carried on.\"\n\n\"Being, I'm sure, especially interested in fish-driving,\" said Terry\nskeptically. \"You sound as if you were acting unofficially to get\nsomething done that officially you can't talk about.\"\n\nHorta smiled warmly at him.\n\n\"That,\" he pronounced, \"is a logical conclusion.\"\n\n\"What's the object of the--research, if that's what it is? And why pick\nme?\"\n\nHorta shrugged and did not answer.\n\n\"Why not tell me?\"\n\n\"_Amigo_,\" said Horta, \"I would like nothing better than to tell you. I\nwould be interested to see your reception of the idea. But it would be\nfatal. You would think me cr-azy. And also more important persons. But\nespecially me.\"\n\nIt was Terry's turn to shrug his shoulders. He hesitated for a long\nmoment. If Horta had tried to apply pressure, he'd have turned obstinate\non the instant. But there was no pressure. First the girl and now Horta\ntried to lure him with mystery and assurance of interest in high places.\n\n\"And _La Rubia's_ involved in the secret?\" demanded Terry.\n\n\"Innocently,\" said Horta promptly. \"As you are.\"\n\n\"Thank you for faith in my innocence,\" said Terry with irony. \"All\nright. If I'm involved, I'm involved. I'll try to devolve out of being\ninvolved by playing along.\"\n\nHe turned to the workshop space at the back of the store. He found boxes\nto pack his working tools and the considerable stock of small parts\nneeded to make such things as burglar alarms, submarine ears and the\nassorted electronic devices modern business finds increasingly\nnecessary. He began to pack them. Surprisingly, Horta helped. Any man of\nSpanish blood is apt to be sensitive about manual labor. If he has an\nofficial position his sensitiveness is apt to be extreme. But Horta not\nonly helped pack the boxes with Terry's stock of parts; he helped carry\nthem to his car outside. He helped to load them.\n\nTerry turned the key in the door and handed it to him, with the nearly\ncomplete inventory of the shop's contents.\n\n\"Jimenez having run away, I leave the shop in your hands,\" he observed.\n\nHorta put the key and document away. He started the motor of his car and\ndrove along the Calle Enero. He drove with surprising moderation for a\npolice officer authorized to ignore traffic rules on occasion. Presently\nthe dock-area of Manila was left behind, and then the rest of the\ncommercial district, and then for a time the car tooled along wide\nstreets past the impressive residences of the wealthy. Some of the\narchitecture was remarkable. A little further, and the harbor--the\nbay--appeared again. The car entered the grounds of Manila's swankiest\nyacht club. The design of the clubhouse was astounding. The car stopped\nby the small-boat pier. There were two men waiting there. Without being\ngiven any orders, they accepted the parcels Horta handed out. Also\nwithout orders, they carried them out to the float. They loaded them\ninto the brass-trimmed motor tender which waited there.\n\n\"They knew we were coming,\" said Terry shortly. \"Would I have been\nbrought anyhow?\"\n\n\"_Pero no_,\" said Horta. \"But there are telephones. When we left the\nshop, one was used.\"\n\nThe men who'd carried out the parcels vanished. Terry and Horta stepped\naboard. The tender cast off and headed out into the harbor. There was a\nPhilippine gunboat and a mine-layer and an American flattop in plain\nview. There were tankers and tramp steamers and a vast array of smaller\ncraft at anchor. A seemingly top-heavy steamer ploughed across oily\nwater two miles distant. The tender headed for a trim sixty-five-foot\nschooner anchored a mile from shore. It grew larger and seemed more trim\nas the tender approached it.\n\nThe smaller boat passed under the larger one's stern, and the name\n_Esperance_ showed plainly. On the starboard side a boat boom projected.\nThe tender ran deftly up and a man in a sweat shirt and duck trousers\nsnubbed the line. He said cheerfully, \"How do you do, Mr. Holt?\" Then he\nnodded to Horta. \"Good to see you, Captain.\" He offered his hand as\nTerry straightened up on deck. \"My name's Davis. We'll have your stuff\naboard right away.\"\n\nTwo young men in dungarees and with crew cuts appeared and took over the\nmotley lot of cartons that Terry and Horta had made ready.\n\n\"Have you everything you need?\" asked Davis anxiously. \"Would some extra\nstuff be useful?\"\n\n\"I could do with a few items,\" said Terry, stiffly.\n\nHe had quickly developed an acute dislike for the patent attempt to\ninduce him to join the _Esperance_. He had no reason for his objection,\nsave that he had not been informed about the task he was urged to\nundertake.\n\n\"Also,\" he added abruptly, \"Captain Horta didn't think to stop at my\nhotel so I could get my baggage.\"\n\n\"Write a list of what you want,\" suggested Davis. \"I'm sure something\ncan be done about your baggage. Make the list complete. If something's\nleft over, it won't matter. There's a desk in the cabin for you to write\nat.\" He turned to Horta. \"Captain, what's the news about _La Rubia_?\"\n\n\"She sailed again yesterday,\" said Horta ruefully. \"She was followed by\nmany other boats. And now there is a moon. It rises late, but it rises.\nMany sailors will be watching her from mastheads. It is said that all\nthe night glasses in Manila have been bought by fishermen....\"\n\nHis voice died away as Terry went down the companion ladder. Belowdecks\nwas attractive. There was no ostentation, but the d\u00e9cor was obviously\nexpensive. There were armchairs, electric lamps, a desk, and shelves\nfilled with books--two or three on electronics and a highly\ncontroversial one on marine monsters and sea serpents. There were some\non anthropology. On skin diving. On astronomy. Two thick volumes on\nabyssal fish. There was a shelf of fiction and other shelves of\nreference books for navigation, radio and Diesel maintenance and repair.\nThere were obvious reasons for these last, but no reason that could be\nimagined for two books on the solar planets.\n\nTerry sat at the desk and compiled a list of electronic parts that he\nwas sure wouldn't be available in Manila. He was annoyed as he realized\nafresh the smoothness of the operation that had brought him to the\n_Esperance_. He found satisfaction in asking for some multi-element\nvacuum tubes that simply couldn't be had except on special order from\nthe manufacturers back in the United States. But it took time to think\nof them.\n\nWhen he went abovedecks, half an hour later, he had listed just six\nelectronic components. The tender was gone, and Horta with it. Davis\ngreeted Terry as cordially as before.\n\n\"The tender's left,\" said Terry with restraint. \"Here's my list.\"\n\nDavis did not even glance at it, but beckoned to one of the crew-cut\nyoung men who'd unloaded the tender.\n\n\"This is Nick Alden,\" he said to Terry. \"He's one of the gang. See about\nthis list, Nick.\"\n\nThe crew-cut young man put out his hand and Terry shook it. It seemed\nexpected. He went forward with the list and vanished down the forecastle\nladder. Davis looked at his watch.\n\n\"Five-thirty,\" he observed. \"A drink might not be a bad thing.\"\n\nHe went below, and Terry surveyed the _Esperance_. She had the look of a\npleasure craft, but was built along the lines of something more\nreliable. There was an unusual power winch amidships, with an\nextraordinarily large reel. Next to it there was a heavy spar by which\nto swing something outboard. There were two boats, well stowed against\nheavy weather, and a number of often-omitted bits of equipment, so that\nthe schooner was not convincing as the hobby of a mere yachtsman.\n\nThen Terry saw the brass-trimmed tender heading out from the yacht-club\nfloat again. Foam spread out from its bow. A figure in it waved. Terry\nrecognized the girl who'd come into the shop of Jimenez y C\u00eda. She was\nsmiling, and as the launch came nearer it seemed to Terry that there was\ntriumph in her smile. He bristled. Then he saw some parcels in the bow\nof the tender. Next to the parcels--and he unbelievingly suspected what\nthey were--he suddenly recognized something else: his suitcases and\nsteamer-trunk. In order to sail with the _Esperance_ he need not go\nashore to get his belongings. They were brought to him. He became\ntotally convinced that these people had assumed he'd do what they wanted\nhim to, without consulting him. He rebelled. Immediately. Any time other\npeople took for granted that they could make plans for him, he would\nbecome obstinate. When he was in a fix--and now he was practically\nstranded in Manila with a need to go elsewhere for a time and no money\nwith which to do it--he was especially touchy. He found himself scowling\nand angry, and the more angry because what was required of him would\nhave been very convenient if there'd been no attempt to inveigle him\ninto it.\n\nThe launch came around the _Esperance's_ stern. Davis came from below\nwith two glasses. The girl said cheerfully, \"Howdo! We've got your extra\nitems. All of them. And your baggage.\"\n\nTerry said curtly, \"How did my list get ashore?\"\n\n\"Nick phoned it,\" said Davis. \"By short-wave.\"\n\n\"And where the devil did you find the stuff I named?\"\n\n\"That,\" said Davis, \"is part of the mystery you don't like.\"\n\n\"Right!\" said Terry grimly. \"I don't like it. I don't think I'll play.\nI'll go ashore in the tender.\"\n\n\"Hold it!\" said Davis. But he was speaking to the operator of the\ntender. The crew-cut Nick was in the act of handing up the first piece\nof baggage. Davis waved it back. \"I'm sorry,\" he said to Terry. \"We'll\nstay at anchor here. If you change your mind, the tender will bring you\nout any time.\"\n\nTerry brought out the sheaf of bills the girl had left in the shop of\nthe vanished Jimenez. He held them out to the girl. She put her hands\nbehind her back and shook her head.\n\n\"We put you to trouble,\" she said pleasantly, \"and we haven't been frank\nwith you. That's to make up for it.\"\n\n\"I won't accept it,\" said Terry stiffly. \"I insist.\"\n\n\"We won't have it back,\" said Davis. \"And we insist!\"\n\nTerry felt idiotic. There was enough of a breeze to make it impractical\nsimply to put the batch of bank notes down. They'd blow away. The girl\nlooked at him regretfully.\n\n\"I'm truly sorry,\" she said. \"I planned the way we went after you. You\nare exactly the person we're sure to need. We decided to try to get you\nto join us. We couldn't explain. So we asked what you were like. And\nyou're not the sort of person who can be hired to do what he's told and\nno questions asked. Captain Horta said you were a gentleman. So since we\ncouldn't ask you to volunteer blindly--though I think you would\nvolunteer if you knew what we're about to do--we tried to make you come\nfor the adventure of it. It didn't work. I'm sorry.\"\n\nTerry had the singular conviction that she told the exact truth. And she\nwas a very pretty girl, but she wasn't using her looks to persuade him.\nShe spoke as one person to another. He unwillingly found himself\nmollified.\n\n\"Look!\" he said vexedly. \"I was leaving Manila. I need to be away for a\nwhile. I am coming back. I can do any crazy thing I want for some weeks,\nor even a couple of months. But I don't like to be pushed around! I\ndon't like--\"\n\nThe girl smiled suddenly.\n\n\"All right, I'll keep the money.\"\n\nThe girl smiled more widely and said, \"Mr. Holt, we are off on a cruise.\nWe'll put in at various ports from time to time. We think you would fit\ninto our party. We invite you to come on this cruise as our guest. You\ncan be helpful or not, as you please. And we will _not_ try to pay you\nfor anything!\"\n\nDavis nodded. Terry frowned. Then he spoke painfully.\n\n\"I have a gift for making a fool of myself,\" he said ruefully. \"When\nit's put that way, fine! I'll come along. But I reserve the right to\nmake guesses.\"\n\n\"That's good!\" said Davis warmly. \"If you do find out what we won't tell\nyou, you'll see why we didn't.\"\n\nHe waved to Nick and the tender operator. The parcels came onto the\n_Esperance's_ deck. His baggage followed. He picked up one of the new\ncardboard parcels and examined its markings.\n\n\"This,\" he said more ruefully still, \"has me stymied. I'd have sworn you\ncouldn't get one of these special tubes nearer than Schenectady, New\nYork. But you found one in Manila in minutes! How did you do it?\"\n\nThe girl laughed.\n\n\"Terribly simple!\" she said. \"We'll tell you. But not until we're under\nway, or you might be so disgusted with the simplicity of it that you'd\nwant to go ashore again.\"\n\n\n\n\n_Two_\n\n\nThe edge of the sun touched the horizon and sank below it, out of sight.\nThere were magnificent tints in the sky, and the gently rippling harbor\nwater reflected them in innumerable swirlings of color. The _Esperance_\nswayed very slightly and very gracefully on the low swells. In minutes\ntwo of the dungareed members of the ship's company got the anchor up\nwith professional efficiency. One of them went below, and the\n_Esperance's_ engine began to rumble. Davis casually took the wheel, and\nthe small yacht began to move toward the open sea while Nick played a\nsalt-water hose on the anchor before lashing it fast. The brief twilight\nof the tropics transformed itself swiftly into night. Lights winked and\nglittered ashore and on the water.\n\nTerry felt more than a little absurd. The girl said pleasantly, at his\nside, \"My name's Deirdre, in case you don't know.\"\n\n\"Mine's Terry, but you do know.\"\n\n\"Naturally!\" she said briskly. \"I should explain that I'm the ship's\ncook, and the boys forward aren't professional sailors, and my father\nisn't--\"\n\n\"Isn't in this business for money,\" said Terry. \"It's strictly for\nsomething else. And I don't think it's buried treasure or anything like\nthat.\"\n\n\"Nothing so sensible,\" she agreed. \"Now, if you want to join a watch,\nyou'll do it. If you don't, you won't. The port cabin, the little one,\nis yours. You are our guest. If you want anything, ask for it. I'm going\nbelow to cook dinner.\"\n\nShe left him. He surveyed the deck again, and presently went back to\nwhere Davis sat nonchalantly by the _Esperance's_ wheel. Davis nodded.\n\n\"Now that you've, well, joined up,\" he said meditatively, \"I've been\ntrying to think how to, well, justify all the mystery. Part of it was\nDeirdre's idea. She thought it would make our proposition more\ninteresting, so you'd be more likely to take it up. But when I think\nabout explaining, I bog down immediately.\"\n\nTerry sat down. The _Esperance_ drove on. Her bow lifted and dipped and\nlifted and dipped. The water was no longer nearly smooth. There was the\nbeginning of a land breeze.\n\n\"There's _La Rubia_,\" said Davis uncomfortably. \"You outfitted her with\nunderwater ears and a radar, at least. Was there anything else?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Terry curtly. \"Nothing else.\"\n\n\"She catches the devil of a lot of fish,\" said Davis. He frowned. \"Some\nof them you might call very queer fish. You haven't heard anything about\nthat?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Terry. \"Nothing.\"\n\n\"I think, then,\" said Davis, \"that I'd better not expose myself to\nscorn. I'd like to be able to read her skipper's mind, though. But it's\npossible he simply thinks he's lucky. And it's possible he's right.\"\n\nTerry waited. Davis puffed on his pipe. Then he said abruptly, \"Anyhow\nyou're a good man at making gadgets. We'll let it go at that, for the\ntime being.\"\n\nThe sea became less and less smooth. There were little slapping sounds\nof waves against the yacht's bow. The muted rumble of her engine was not\nintrusive. The breeze increased. Davis gave a definite impression of\nhaving said all he intended to say for the time being. Terry stirred.\n\n\"You want me to build a gadget,\" he said. \"To drive fish. Would you want\nto give me some details?\"\n\nDavis considered. A few drops of spray came over the _Esperance's_ side.\n\n\"N-o-o-o,\" said Davis. \"Not just yet. There's a possibility it will fit\nin. I'd like you to make one, and maybe it will fit in somewhere. But\n_La Rubia's_ the best angle we've got so far. There is one gadget I'd\ngive a lot to have! You know, a depth-finder. It sends a pulse of sound\ndown to the bottom and times the echo coming back. Very much like radar,\nin a way. Both send out a pulse and time its return.\"\n\nTerry nodded. There was no mystery about depth-finders or radars.\n\n\"We've got a depth-finder on board,\" said Davis. \"If I sail a straight\ncourse and keep the depth-finder running, I can make a profile of the\nsea bottom under me. If I had a row of ships doing the same thing, we\ncould get profiles and have a relief map of the bottom.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" agreed Terry.\n\n\"What I'd give a lot for,\" said Davis, \"would be a depth-finder that\nwould send spot-pulses, like radar does. Aimed sound-pulses. And an\narrangement made so it could scan the ocean bottom like radar scans the\nsky. One boat could make a graph of the bottom in depths and heights,\nmapping even hummocks and hills underwater. Could something like that be\ndone?\"\n\n\"Probably,\" Terry told him. \"It might take a good deal of doing,\nthough.\"\n\n\"I wish you'd think about it,\" said Davis. \"I know a place where I'd\nlike to use such a thing. It's in the Luzon Deep. I really would like to\nhave a detailed picture of the bottom at a certain spot there!\"\n\nTerry said nothing. He'd been made angry, then mollified, and now he\nfelt tempted to grow angry again. There was nothing definite in what was\nwanted of him, after elaborate machinations to get him aboard the\n_Esperance_. He was disappointed.\n\n\"Good breeze,\" said Davis in a different voice. \"We might as well hoist\nsail and cut off the engine. Take the wheel?\"\n\nTerry took the wheel. Davis went forward. Four dungareed figures came up\nout of the forecastle. The sails went up and filled. The engine stopped.\nThe motion of the boat changed. More spray came aboard, but the movement\nwas steadier. Davis came back and took the wheel once more.\n\n\"I think,\" he said, \"that we're acting in a way to--hm--be annoying. I\nought to lay my cards on the table. But I can't. For one thing, I\nhaven't drawn a full hand yet. For another, there are some things you'll\nhave to find out for yourself, in a situation like this.\"\n\n\"Such as--\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Davis with a sudden dogged air, \"take those _orejas de\nellos_, for an example. _Ellos_ are supposed to be some sort of beings\nat the bottom of the sea who listen to fish and fishermen. It's a\nsuperstition pure and simple. Suppose I said I was investigating the\npossibility that there were such--beings. You'd think I was crazy,\nwouldn't you?\"\n\nTerry shrugged.\n\n\"What I am interested in,\" said Davis, \"has enough credit behind it for\nme to get some pretty rare electronic parts from the flattop in harbor\nback yonder. Nick called them by short-wave, they sent the parts ashore\nand gave them to Deirdre, and she brought them out to you.\"\n\nTerry blinked. Then he realized. Of course, that was where just about\nany imaginable component for electronic devices would be found--in the\nelectronics stores of a flattop! They needed to have such things at\nhand. They'd carry them in store. Davis said drily, \"They wouldn't\nsupply parts to a civilian who was investigating imaginary gods or\ndevils. So what I'm bothered with isn't a superstition. Right?\"\n\n\"Y-yes,\" agreed Terry.\n\nIt was true. The Navy would not stretch regulations for a crackpot\ncivilian. It was not likely, either, that Horta would have implied so\ndefinitely that the Philippine Government wanted somebody with Terry's\nqualifications to go for a cruise on the _Esperance_.\n\nDeirdre put her head up through the after-cabin hatch.\n\n\"Dinner is served,\" she said cheerfully.\n\n\"The wheel,\" said Davis to Terry.\n\nHe went forward. All four of the non-professional seamen came with him\nwhen he returned.\n\n\"This is the rest of the gang,\" said Davis. \"You met Nick. The others\nare Tony Drake, Jug Bell, and Doug Holmes.\" He made an embracing gesture\nas they shook hands in turn. \"Harvard, Princeton, Yale--and Nick's\nM.I.T. It's your turn at the wheel, Tony.\"\n\nOne of the four took over. The others filed below after Davis and Terry.\nTerry was silent. Davis had wanted to show that he was being\ninformative, and yet he'd said exactly nothing about the interests or\nthe purpose of the _Esperance's_ complement.\n\nDinner in the after-cabin was almost as confusing to Terry. Seen at\nclose range across a table, the four dungareed young men could not\npossibly be anything but college undergraduates. They were respectful to\nDavis as an older man and they tended to be a little cagey about Terry,\nbecause he was slightly older than themselves but not an honorary\ncontemporary. They plainly regarded Deirdre with the warmest possible\napproval.\n\nConversation began, at first cryptic but suddenly only preposterous.\nThere was an argument about the supposed intelligence of porpoises,\nbased on recent studies of their brain structure. Tony observed\nprofoundly that without an opposable thumb intelligence could not lead\nto artefacts, and hence no culture and no great effective intelligence\nwas possible. Jug denied the meaningfulness of brain structure as an\nindication of intellect. Intellect would be useless to a creature which\ncould neither make nor use a tool. Doug argued hotly that the point was\nabsurd. He pointed to spastic children once rated as morons but actually\nhaving high I.Q.'s. They had intellects, though they had been useless\nbecause of their inability to communicate. But Nick asserted that\nwithout tools they'd have nothing to talk about but food, danger, and\nwho went where with whom for what. All of which, he observed, needed no\nbrains.\n\nDavis listened amusedly. Deirdre threw in the suggestion that without\nhands or tools an intelligent creature could compose poetry, and Jug\nprotested that that was nothing to use a brain for--and the talk turned\ninto a violent argument about poetry. Doug insisted vehemently that the\nfinest possible intellects were required for the composition and\nappreciation of true poetry. Then Davis said, \"Tony's still at the\nwheel.\"\n\nThe argument died down and the crew-cuts devoted themselves to eating,\nso one of them could get through and relieve him.\n\nAfterward, Davis settled down below to a delicate short-wave tuning\nprocess to get music from an improbable distance. Deirdre served Tony\nhis meal and talked with him while he ate it. Terry went abovedecks and\npaced back and forth as the _Esperance_ sailed on through the night.\n\nHe couldn't make out anything at all about the crew or the purpose\nbehind the _Esperance's_ chosen task and purpose. He felt dubious about\nthe whole business. Like most technically-minded men, he could become\nabsorbed in a problem, especially if it was a device difficult to design\nor a design that somehow didn't work. Such things fascinated him. But\nthe _Esperance's_ crew was not concerned with a problem like that. There\nwas no pattern in their talk or behavior to match the way a technical\nmind would go about finding a solution. The problem was bafflingly\nvague, yet there _was_ one.\n\n_La Rubia_ was an element in it. Possibly Davis' wistful mention of a\npartial map of the bottom of the Luzon Deep fitted in somewhere. Davis\nhad spoken of _orejas de ellos_ with some familiarity, but certainly no\nNavy ship would cooperate in the investigation of a fisherman's\nsuperstition in which even fishermen didn't believe any longer. The\nPhilippine fishing fleet was modern and efficient. Fishermen used\nsubmarine ears without superstitious fears, and if they referred to\nimaginary _ellos_ it was as an American would say \"knock on wood,\" with\nno actual belief that it meant anything.\n\nWhatever the _Esperance's_ purpose was, there was nothing mystical about\nit--not if a flattop parted with rare and expensive specialized vacuum\ntubes to try to help, and the police department of Manila urged Terry\ntactfully--through Horta--to join the yacht, and no less than a Navy\nCaptain had named him as someone to be recruited.\n\nDeirdre came abovedecks and replaced Tony at the wheel. The _Esperance_\nsailed on. A last-quarter moon was now shining low on the eastern\nhorizon. It seemed larger and nearer to the earth than when seen from\nmore temperate climes. The wake of the yacht glowed in the moonlight.\n\nThe wide expanse of canvas made stark contrast between its moonlit top\nand its shadow on the deck. The only illumination on the ship was the\nbinnacle lights and the red and green running lights. Deirdre kept the\n_Esperance_ on course.\n\nTerry went up to where she sat, beside the wheel.\n\n\"I've been making guesses,\" he told her. \"Your father.... I believe that\nhis curiosity has been aroused by something, and he's resolved to track\nit down. I strongly suspect that at some time or another he's gotten\nbored with making money and decided to have some fun.\"\n\nDeirdre nodded.\n\n\"Very good! Almost completely true. But what he's interested in is a\ngood deal more important than fun.\"\n\nTerry nodded in his turn.\n\n\"I suspected that too. And it's rather likely that you've got a\nvolunteer crew instead of a professional one because these young men\nconsider it a fascinating adventure into the absurd, and because they'll\nkeep their mouths shut if something turns out to be classified\ninformation.\"\n\n\"My father's doing this strictly on his own!\" said Deirdre quickly.\n\"There's nothing official about it. There isn't any classified\ninformation about it. This is a private affair from the beginning!\"\n\n\"But in the end it may turn out to be something else,\" said Terry.\n\n\"Y-yes. We don't know, though. It's impossible to know!\nIt's--ridiculous!\"\n\n\"And my explanation for your being so mysterious with me is that you and\nyour father insist that I find out everything for myself because I'd\nthink it foolish if you told me.\"\n\nDeirdre did not answer for a moment. There was a movement behind Terry,\nand Davis came on deck.\n\n\"That was good music!\" he said pleasedly. \"You missed some very\ninteresting sounds, Deirdre! You too, Holt.\"\n\n\"He's decided,\" said Deirdre, \"that we're a little bit ashamed of our\nenterprise and won't tell him about it for fear he'll simply laugh at\nus.\"\n\nTerry protested, \"Not at all! Nothing like that!\"\n\n\"When some forty-odd people have been killed by something inexplicable\nat one time that we know of,\" said Davis, \"--and we don't know how many\nothers have been killed at other times, or may be killed by it in the\nfuture--I don't think that's a laughing matter.\"\n\nHe surveyed what should be the direction of the land. A light showed\nthere and vanished, then came on again and vanished. A minute later it\nshowed and disappeared, then came on again twice. It was very far away.\nDavis said in a different tone, \"We can change course now, Deirdre. You\nknow the new one.\"\n\nThe _Esperance's_ bowsprit forsook the star at which it had been aiming.\nIt swung to another. Davis moved about, adjusting the sheets alone. On\nthe new heading the yacht heeled over a little more and the water\nrushing past her hull had a different sound. The sky seemed larger and\nmore remote than it ever appears from a city. The yacht's wake streamed\nbehind her in a trail of bluish brightness. Even the moon was strange.\nIt had the cold enormousness of something very near and menacing. It\nlooked as close as when seen through a telescope of moderate power.\n\nThe _Esperance_ seemed very lonely on the immense waste of waters.\n\nNext morning, of course, the sense of loneliness was gone. There was\nneither land nor any ship in sight, but gulls fluttered and squawked\noverhead, and the waves seemed to leap and gambol in the sunshine. Just\nbefore the foremast a metal plate in the decking had been lifted up, and\na new, stubby, extensible mast rose almost as high as the crosstrees. A\ntiny basket-like object rotated monotonously at its upper end. It was a\nradar-bowl, and somehow it was not unusual, except in the manner in\nwhich it was mounted. Yet, such a collapsible radar mast was reasonable\non a sailing yacht with many lines aloft that could be fouled. Anyhow,\nthe radar was concerned with human affairs, and so it was company.\n\nThe housekeeping work on the boat was in progress. Doug and Jug scrubbed\nthe deck. The other crew-cuts gave signs of industry from time to time,\nappearing and vanishing. Davis smoked tranquilly at the wheel. Terry\nfelt useless, as well as puzzled.\n\n\"Can I do anything?\" he asked awkwardly.\n\n\"You're your own boss,\" said Davis.\n\n\"Then I might as well see what can be done about that submarine\nnoisemaker.\"\n\n\"If you feel like it,\" said Davis, \"fine!\"\n\nBut he did not urge. Terry waited a moment. There was a sort of\ncontagion of purposefulness in this eccentric small group on the\n_Esperance_. They had something they were trying to do, and it seemed\nimportant to them. But Terry was an outsider and would remain one until\nhe became active in their joint effort.\n\nHe got out his equipment and materials and spread them out. There was no\nneed to build a recorder, since there was one among the supplies. The\nrest wouldn't be unduly difficult. He established a working space and\nset systematically to work. The task he'd accepted was essentially\nsimple. A submarine ear was to pick up underwater sounds. He had to\nmodify a microphone and enclose it in a water-tight housing, with\ncertain special features that would make it highly directional. The\nrecorder would take the pick-up and register it on magnetic tape, while\nplaying it for simultaneous listening. Then he had to assemble a\nmachine for playing back the taped sounds under water. That required a\nunit for a submarine horn, to broadcast the amplified sound. It isn't\ndifficult to make a sound under water. One can knock two stones together\nunder the surface and a swimmer can hear it a mile or more away. But a\nhorn to reproduce specific sounds is more difficult to build. It needs\nextra power. A sound-truck in a city, competing with all the traffic\nnoises, will turn no more than fifteen watts of electricity into noise.\nBut much more power would be needed to produce a similar volume under\nwater.\n\nTerry modified the mike into a submarine ear--an _orejas de ellos_. Then\nhe began to assemble an audio amplifier to build up the volume of the\nsounds already taped for re-use under the sea. He had the parts. It was\nmostly just finicky labor. He sat cross-legged in the sunshine, not far\nfrom the _Esperance's_ unusual winch.\n\nNick came up from below and went aft. He spoke to Davis. Terry couldn't\nhear what was said, but Davis gave orders.\n\nThe _Esperance_ heeled over; away, away over. The four crew-cuts\nadjusted the sheets for maximum effect of the sails on the new direction\nof motion. The yacht seemed to tear through the water like a racing\nboat. Terry had to rescue some of his smaller parts which started for\nthe scuppers. He looked up. Deirdre said cheerfully, \"Our radar picked\nup a boat that's probably _La Rubia_ on the way back to Manila. We don't\nwant her to see us.\"\n\nTerry blinked.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"We're going to take a look at the spot where we think she catches her\nfish,\" said Deirdre. \"It's strange enough that she catches so many, but\nwhat's even stranger is the kind of fish she catches at times.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\nDeirdre shrugged. Then she said irrelevantly, \"_La Rubia's_ skipper\nwould like to have the only radar in the world, as you've reason to\nknow, and he doesn't think of radars, except his own and possible\ncompetitors. But there are lots of others. We're probably a blip on\nsomebody's radar-screen right now. In fact, we're supposed to be. So\nwhen my father got interested in _La Rubia_ and her--catches, he was\nable to have somebody notice where she goes every time she slips away\nfrom the fishing fleet. And so he was told. It was all quite unofficial,\nof course.\"\n\nTerry bent over his task again while the _Esperance_ sped along over the\noff-shore swells. There was no land in sight anywhere. An albatross\nglided overhead for a time, as if inspecting the _Esperance_ as a\npossible source of food. When Terry looked for it later it was gone.\nOnce there was a flurry in many wave-flanks, and a small school of\nflying fish darted out of the sea with hazy, beating fins, and dived\nback into the sea many yards from where they started.\n\nBut nothing of any consequence happened anywhere. Terry fitted and\nsoldered and tested. By noon he had a rather powerful audio amplifying\nunit, set up to magnify any sound the tape-recorder fed into it. Deirdre\nprepared a meal. The galley of the _Esperance_ was admirably supplied\nwith all kinds of food. After the noon meal the yacht changed course\nagain to a line which would intersect her original morning course at\nsome point.\n\nTerry found himself fuming. He'd set to work to make something that\nDavis apparently wanted, but his most elementary questions still ran\nagainst a blank refusal to answer. Both Davis and Deirdre had spoken of\noddities in the catches of _La Rubia_. There could not possibly be any\nreason for them to refuse to tell him what they were. Terry worked\nhimself into irritability, recalling how he volunteered to come on the\n_Esperance_ but not thinking that he would be treated as someone who\nwasn't allowed to know what everybody else aboard most certainly did.\n\nIn the afternoon there was guitar music down in the forecastle, and Doug\ncame out and settled himself on the bowsprit with a book of poetry.\nPresently Nick sat down close by Terry and watched interestedly as he\nput mysterious-looking electronic elements together into\nincomprehensible groups. When he had finished, Terry did not admire his\nhandiwork. The noisemaking unit came last. The electrical part had to be\nenclosed, water-tight, with a diaphragm exposed to the water on one\nside and its working parts protected from all moisture on the other. The\ndevice looked cobbled, but it worked, and made monstrous sounds in the\nair.\n\nNow he plugged the submarine ear into the recorder. He dropped it\noverside and taped the random noises of the sea: the washings of sea\nwater against the _Esperance's_ hull, frequent splashings, and very\nfaint, chirping noises from who-knew-what.\n\n\"Watch the volume, will you?\" Terry pointed out the Indication that\nshould not be exceeded. Nick nodded. \"I'm going to whack the paddle\noverside and see what we get in the way of noise.\"\n\nNick hesitated. Then he said uneasily, \"Wait a minute.\"\n\nHe went aft to Davis, apparently somnolent at the wheel. Deirdre joined\nthe two of them in a seemingly very serious discussion. Then she walked\nover to Terry.\n\n\"I hate to say it,\" she told him with evident concern, \"but my father\nthinks it would be wiser to try out the paddle in shallow water. Do you\nmind?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" snapped Terry. \"I do mind, since I'm not allowed to know the\nreason for that or anything else.\"\n\nHe put away his tools and the unused parts. He pointed to the machines\nhe had already built.\n\n\"This is what your father wanted, I think. After it's tested I'll ask\nyou to put me ashore.\"\n\nHe went below, where he fretted to himself. But no one came, either to\ninform him of Davis' reasons, or to tell him to do as he pleased. He\nfelt like a child who isn't allowed to play with other children; who is\narbitrarily excluded from the purpose and the excitement of his fellows.\nThinking in such terms did not make him feel any better. His irritation\nincreased. The _Esperance_ was engaged in an enterprise that these\npeople considered very much worth doing. He'd joined them to accomplish\nit, and they wouldn't tell him what it was. He hadn't the temperament to\nbe content with just following blindly. And somehow the fact that\nDeirdre was aboard and a participant in the secret made his exclusion an\ninsult.\n\nHe felt about Deirdre that urgent concern that a man may feel about one\nor two, or at most three girls during his whole lifetime. It wasn't a\nromantic interest, at this stage, but he wanted to look well in her\neyes, and he was enormously interested in anything she said and did. If\nhe left the _Esperance_ and ceased to know her, he knew he'd be nagged\nat by the feeling that he'd made a very bad mistake. He didn't want to\nstop knowing her. But he refused to be patronized.\n\nHe saw an open book on the after-cabin table and glanced restlessly at\nit. There were three or four photographs and a newspaper clipping stuck\ninto its pages. The book itself dealt with physics at post-graduate\nlevels--which meant that it included a good deal about electronics.\n\nStill fuming, Terry glanced at the pictures. The first was of a\nspherical object made of transparent plastic and probably of small size.\nIt had a number of metallic elements clearly visible through the\ntransparent case. It looked as if it might be an electronic device\nitself, but there was no sign of lead-in contacts, and the parts inside\nmade no sense at all. The second and third photographs were of a similar\nyet slightly different object. The fourth photograph was a picture of\nwhat looked like ocean water, taken from a plane. The horizon showed in\none corner. The center of the picture was an irregularly-shaped mass of\nwhite. On close examination it appeared to be foam. But it looked as if\nit were piled up in masses above the surface. If the water around it was\nocean--and it was--and the visible crest-lines were of waves--and they\nwere--that heap of foam must have been hundreds of yards in diameter and\npiled many feet high on the surface. Foam does not form in such masses\nin the open sea. It would not last if it did.\n\nOn the margin of this picture a date had been inked--three days\nbefore--and a position in degrees of latitude and longitude.\n\nTerry turned to the chart rack. He pulled out a chart and looked up the\nposition. Someone had made a pencil-dot there. It was close to Thrawn\nIsland, on the very brink of the Luzon Deep, that incredible submarine\nchasm in which the entire Himalayan chain could be sunk without showing\na single pinnacle above the surface.\n\nHe went back to the clipping. It was dated Manila, two years earlier. It\nwas an obviously skeptical article on a report made by the crewmen of a\nsailing ship that stopped by Manila. Sailing ships are rare enough in\nmodern times. This ship reported that she had sighted another of her own\nkind at sea. The two ships altered course to speak to each other. And\nthe one which came into Manila declared that when the other vessel was\nno more than two miles away, white foam suddenly appeared on the sea\njust in front of her. A geyser of unsubstantial white stuff spouted up\nand spread, shooting up about thirty feet on the water. The bow of the\nother sailing ship entered the foam patch. And suddenly her bow tilted\ndownward, her masts swayed forward, and the entire ship vanished into\nthe white stuff, exactly as if she had sailed over a precipice. She did\nnot sink. She dropped. She \"fell\" under water--under the foam--her sails\nstill spread. One instant she sailed proudly. The next instant she was\ngone.\n\nThe position of such an incredible happening was roughly given. It was\nalmost exactly the same as the position written on the photograph of\nfoam taken from the air. At the margin of the Luzon Deep.\n\nTerry found that his indignation had evaporated. The reason for it still\nremained, but now he wanted to know more about this happening and about\nthe spheres of plastic with those deftly designed but enigmatic\ninclusions. The plastic objects had a purpose. He wanted to know what.\nAnd the news clipping....\n\nHaving announced crossly that he would ask to be set ashore as soon as\nthe fish-driving unit was tested, he was ashamed to take it back. He\nstayed below, now angry at himself again. Nobody came below. Deirdre did\nnot descend to cook. Night fell. Well after nightfall he heard movements\non deck, and presently a voice which sounded oddly distant. The\n_Esperance's_ course changed abruptly. The quality of her motion altered\nonce more.\n\nHe went abovedecks. Twilight was long over, but the moon was not yet up.\nHere and there a wave-tip frothed, and blue luminescence appeared. Here\nand there a streak of dim blue light could be seen under water, where\nsome fish darted. But those dartings were rare. Despite the yacht's\nshining wake and the curling wave-tips, the sea was darker than usual.\n\nNick's voice came from aloft, faint and eerie and seeming to come from\nthe stars.\n\n\"... farther to port.... Two points ...\"\n\nTerry could see the masthead weaving and swaying against the stars, with\na small dark silhouette clinging to it: Nick. The yacht began to swing.\nOn one bearing she pounded heavily. The seas could hit her squarely, and\nthey did. Figures moved swiftly about the deck, loosening sheets or\ntightening them. Nick's voice again, from overhead.\n\n\"Stea-a-a-dy!\"\n\nThe _Esperance_ ceased to turn. Rushing, pounding water sprayed in the\nair. The waves splashed upon the hull of the yacht, which was sweeping\nalong on a quartering wind.\n\nFor a while no one talked. Tony stood at the wheel, with Davis nearby,\nby the binnacle light. Terry could see Davis glancing into the binnacle,\nthen gazing at the horizon ahead, and then aloft, where Nick seemed to\nswing among low-hanging stars.\n\n\"Ri-i-i-ght!\" he called from high overhead. \"Steady as she goes.\"\n\nThe _Esperance_ sailed on, over the surging seas. Waves came out of\nnowhere, leaped beside the yacht and then went by--to nowhere. It was\nhard to believe that the yacht actually moved forward. She seemed to\nstay perpetually in the one spot. But there was a winding, sinuous wake,\nand there was froth under her forefoot.\n\nThen a vague brightness appeared on the sea, at the limit of vision. It\nspread out more widely as the _Esperance_ approached. Presently it was\nclearly visible.\n\nDead ahead, the beam of the headlight suddenly revealed an incredible\nspectacle. Until then there had been just a few flashes in the water,\nwhere some fish darted away from the yacht's bulk. But here the entire\nsurface of the water shone with thousands and thousands of fish. They\nwere packed in a sharply delimited circle about a mile wide. When the\n_Esperance_ got close enough, she hauled up into the wind to look.\n\nFrom a spot fifty yards ahead, the sea was alive with a million frantic\ndartings of swimming things. They were crowded, packed almost\nfin-to-fin. And it was not a surface phenomenon only. From the yacht's\ndeck the streaks of light were visible deep down, as far as the clear\nwater would let them be seen. They formed a column of glittering chaos.\nThe vast circle, to an indefinite depth, was packed solid with agitated\nfish. At that edge of brightness the thronging creatures were splashing\nin a mad frenzy. Solid shining shapes leaped crazily from the water.\nSome leaped again and again, until they reached the spot where the\nflashes were thickest, and got lost in the multitude of their fellows. A\nfew escaped to the darker surrounding sea. They seemed to run away in\nstark terror. But those were only a few. The greatest mass of fish\nmilled crazily inside the circle. There were even porpoises, darting\nabout as if frightened beyond all normal behavior, not even trying to\nfeed on the equally fear-maddened creatures all about them.\n\n\n\n\n_Three_\n\n\nTerry stared incredulously. Someone moved beside him. It was Davis. He\nspoke in a dry voice.\n\n\"I would think,\" he said detachedly, \"that _La Rubia_ could catch a\nboatload of fish in that water with a single haul of her nets. Certainly\nwith two.\"\n\nTerry turned his head.\n\n\"But what is it? What makes these fish gather like this?\"\n\n\"An interesting question,\" said Davis. \"We'll try to find out how it\nhappens. Even more interesting, I'd like to know why.\"\n\nHe moved away along the deck. Terry went close to the side rail. A few\nminutes later the startling glare of one of the side searchlights smote\nupon the water away from the incredible scene. It moved slowly back and\nforth. Where the light struck, the sea seemed totally commonplace. No\nfish could be seen. Then the white beam swept here and there in jerky\nleapings. There was nothing unusual on the surface, nothing beyond the\nlimit of brightness, where the sea turned dark.\n\nDeirdre said at Terry's side, \"We didn't really expect this! I'm going\nto get a sample of the water, Terry. Want to help?\"\n\nShe ignored his haughty withdrawal of the afternoon, and he could not\nstand on his dignity in the presence of such an incredible phenomenon.\nShe got a water bucket from the nearby rack. A wave sprung up as she\ntried to fill the bucket overside. It touched her hand and she cried\nout. Terry jerked her back by the shoulder. The bucket bumped against\nthe _Esperance's_ side, hanging on the line attached to the rail.\n\n\"What's the matter?\"\n\n\"It stung! The water stung! Like a nettle!\" Shaking a little, Deirdre\nrubbed her wet hand with the other. \"It doesn't hurt now, but it was\nlike a stinging nettle--or an electric shock!\"\n\nTerry hauled in the bucket and set it down. He leaned far over the rail.\nHe plunged his hand into a lifting pinnacle of the sea. Instantly, his\nskin felt as if pricked by ten thousand needles. But his muscles did not\ncontract as they would in an electric shock. The sensation was on the\nsurface of his skin alone.\n\nHe shook his head impatiently. He put his finger in the bucket he'd\nlifted to the deck. There was no unusual sensation. He dipped overside\nagain. Again acute and startling hurt, from the mere contact with the\nwater.\n\nDeirdre still rubbed her hand. She said in a queer, surprised voice,\n\n\"Like pins and needles. It's like--like the fish-driving paddle! But\nworse! Much worse!\"\n\nTerry looked again at the sea glittering with the swarms of fish in\nhopeless, panicked agitation, confined in a specific narrow compass by\nsomething unguessable. The searchlight continued to flick here and\nthere. The _Esperance_ drifted away from the edge of brightness. Terry\nput his hand overside once more, and once more he felt the stinging,\nnettle-like sensation. He got a fresh bucket of water from overside. On\ndeck, there was no strange sensation when he dipped his hand in it.\n\nThe searchlight went out abruptly and only a faint and quickly dimming\nreddish glow came from it. That too died.\n\nDavis' voice gave orders. Terry said sharply, \"Wait a minute!\" He began\nto explain about the stinging of the water. But then he said, \"Deirdre,\nyou tell him! I'm going to put a submarine ear overboard. At the least\nwe'll get fish noises on a new scale. But I've got an idea ... don't\nsail into the bright circle yet.\"\n\nHe got out the submarine ear and the recorder he'd made ready that\nafternoon. He started the recorder. Then he trailed the microphone\noverside. The sounds would be heard live through the speaker and they\nwould be taped at the same time. At first, a blaring, confused sound\ncame through. Terry turned down the volume.\n\nHe heard gruntings and chirpings and rustlings. Fish made those\nnoises--not all fish, but certain species. These shrill, squeaking\nnoises were the protests of frightened porpoises. But under and through\nall other sounds, a steady, unvarying hum could be easily detected.\nTerry had never heard anything quite like it. Its pitch was the same as\nthat of a sixty-cycle frequency, but its tone quality was somehow\nsardonic and snarling. The word that came into Terry's mind was \"nasty.\"\nYes, it was a nasty sound. One didn't like it. One would want to get\naway from it. In the air the same unpleasant sensation is produced by\nnoises that make one's flesh crawl.\n\nTerry straightened up from where the recorder played upon the wet deck.\nDavis and Deirdre had come to listen, in the strange darkness under the\nsails of the _Esperance_.\n\n\"I've got a sort of hunch,\" said Terry slowly. \"Let's sail across the\nbright patch. I'll record the sea noises all the way. I've a feeling\nthat that hum means something.\"\n\n\"It's not what you'd call an ordinary sound,\" said Davis.\n\nHe raised his voice. One of the crew-cuts was at the schooner's wheel.\nHe spun it. The sails filled, and the rattling of flapping canvas died\naway. The _Esperance_ gathered way and moved swiftly from the glittering\ncircle, came about, and sailed again toward the shining area. She got\ncloser and closer to the boundary.\n\nThe recorder continued to give out the confused and frightened noises of\nthe sea creatures, but under and through their sounds there remained the\nnasty and sardonic hum. It grew louder and more unpleasant--much louder\nin proportion to the fish sounds. At the very boundary of the bright\nspace it was loudest of all.\n\nBut as the yacht went on, the hum dimmed. At the very center of the\ncircle where the glitterings were brightest, the humming sound was\noverwhelmed by the submarine tumult of senseless fish voices. Terry\ndipped his hand here. The tingling was almost tolerable, but not quite.\n\nDavis hauled more buckets of water to the deck. In two of them he found\nsome fish, so dense was the finny multitude. Then the yacht neared the\nfarthest limit of the bright circle. The hum from the recording\ninstrument grew progressively louder. Again, at the very edge of the\nshining water, it was loudest.\n\nThe _Esperance_ sailed across the live boundary and into the dark sea.\nAs the boat went on, the sound dimmed....\n\n\"Definitely loudest,\" said Terry absorbedly, \"at the edge of the circle\nof fish. At the line the fish couldn't cross to escape. It is if there\nwere an electric fence in the sea. It felt like that, too. But there\nisn't any fence.\"\n\nDavis asked evenly, \"Question: what holds them crowded?\"\n\nTerry said again, groping in his mind, \"They act like fish in a closing\nnet. I've seen something like this once, when a purse-seine was hauled.\nThose fish were frantic because they couldn't get away. Just like\nthese.\"\n\n\"Why can't they get away?\" asked Davis grimly. \"We haven't seen anything\nholding them.\"\n\n\"But we heard something,\" pointed out Deirdre. \"The hum. That may be\nwhat closes them in.\"\n\nHer father made a grunting noise. \"We'll see about that.\"\n\nHe moved away, back to the stern. In moments, the _Esperance_ was\nbeating upwind. Presently, she headed back toward her previous position,\nbut outside the brightness. Terry could see dark silhouettes moving\nabout near the yacht's wheel. Then he saw another brightness at the\neastern horizon, but that was in the sky. Almost as soon as he noticed\nit, the moon peered over the edge of the world, and climbed slowly to\nfull view, and then swam up among the lower-hanging stars.\n\nImmediately, the look of the sea was different. The waves no longer\nseemed to race the darkness with only star glitters on their flanks. The\nfigures at the _Esperance's_ stern were now quite distinct in the\nmoonlight.\n\n\"You said a very sensible thing, Deirdre,\" said Terry. \"I thought of the\nfish-driving paddle and its effects, but I was ashamed to mention it. I\nthought it would sound foolish. But when you said it, it didn't.\"\n\n\"I have a talent,\" said Deirdre, \"for making foolish things sound\nsensible. Or perhaps the reverse. I'm going to say a sensible thing now.\nWe haven't had dinner. I'm going to fix something to eat.\"\n\n\"You won't get anybody to go belowdecks right now!\" said Terry.\n\n\"I thought of that,\" she told him. \"Sandwiches.\"\n\nShe went below. Terry continued to watch, while figures at the stern of\nthe schooner went through an involved process of visual measurement. It\nwas not simple to determine the dimensions of a patch of shimmering\nlight flashes from a boat in motion. But presently, Davis came toward\nhim.\n\n\"It's thirteen hundred yards across,\" he told Terry. \"Plus or minus\ntwenty.\"\n\n\"I didn't expect all this,\" Davis said, frowning. \"I've been making\nguesses and hoping fervently that I was wrong. And I have been, but each\ntime the proof that I was wrong has led to new guesses, and I'm afraid\nto think those guesses may be right.\"\n\n\"I can't begin to guess yet,\" said Terry.\n\n\"You will!\" Davis assured him. \"You will! You try to add up things.... A\nhalf-mile-wide patch of foam that piles up thirty feet above the\nsea....\"\n\n\"And into which,\" Terry interrupted, \"a sailing ship does not sink but\ndrops out of sight as if there were a hole in the sea.\"\n\nDavis turned sharply toward him.\n\n\"There were some photographs and a newspaper clipping on the cabin\ntable,\" explained Terry. \"I suspected they might have been put there for\nme to see.\"\n\n\"Deirdre, perhaps,\" said Davis. \"She's resolved to involve you in this.\nYou've got scruples, so she suspects you of having brains. Yes. You'll\nadd those things up. You'll include the remarkable success of a fishing\nboat named _La Rubia_ and the fact that she sometimes brings in very\nstrange fish ... And then you'll add ...\"\n\nHis eyes flickered aloft. A shooting star streaked across one-third of\nthe sky leaving a trail of light behind it. Then it went out.\n\n\"You'll even be tempted,\" said Davis, \"to include something like that in\nyour guesses! And then you'll try to come up with a total for the lot.\nThen you'll be as troubled as I am.\"\n\nHe paused a moment.\n\n\"You said you wanted to be put ashore as soon as the gadget you made\ntoday was tested. I hope you've changed your mind, or will. That\ntape-recording may mean something to somebody. We wouldn't have heard\nthat very singular noise but for you.\"\n\n\"I withdraw the business of going ashore,\" said Terry uncomfortably.\n\"I'm going to ask another question. What are those little spheres that I\nsaw in the photographs on the cabin table? Were they found fastened to\nthe fish?\"\n\n\"So I'm told,\" said Davis. \"They are made of plastic. One was on a fish\ncaught by a chief petty officer of the United States Navy. Four have\nbeen found on fish brought into the market by _La Rubia_. They could\nconceivably be a joke, but it's very elaborate! Somebody tried to cut\none open and it burst to hell-and-gone. Terrific pressure inside. The\nmetal parts inside were iridium. The others haven't been cut open.\nThey're--\" Davis' tone was dry. \"They're being studied.\"\n\nA figure came out of the forecastle and walked aft. It was Nick. He\nstopped to say, \"I called Manila and got a loran fix on us. We're right\nat the place _La Rubia_ heads for every time she sneaks away from the\nrest of the fishing fleet. It seems that she hauls her nets yonder.\"\n\nHe nodded toward the circular area of luminosity on the sea. \"It looks\nsmaller than when I went below deck.\"\n\nDavis stared. He seemed to stiffen.\n\n\"It does. We'll make sure.\"\n\nHe went aft. Deirdre came up with sandwiches. Terry took the tray from\nher and followed her toward the others.\n\n\"Cigars, cigarettes, candy, sandwiches?\" she asked cheerfully.\n\nDavis was back at the task of measuring the angle subtended by the patch\nof shining sea, and then closely estimating its distance from the\n_Esperance_. He said, \"It _is_ smaller. Eleven hundred yards, now.\"\n\n\"When _La Rubia_ was here today,\" said Terry, \"it might have been a\ncouple of miles across. Even that would be a terrific concentration of\nfish! They're not all at the surface.\"\n\nDavis said with impatience, seemingly directed against himself, \"It's\nnarrowed two hundred yards in the past half-hour. It must be tending\ntoward something! There has to be a conclusion to it! Something must be\nabout to happen!\"\n\nDeirdre said slowly, \"If it's the equivalent of a seine being hauled,\nwith a hum instead of a net, what's going to happen when it's time for\nthe fish to be boated?\"\n\nDavis ignored her for a moment. Then he said irritably, \"Everyone seems\nto have more brains than I do! Tony, break out those gun-cameras. Nick,\nget back and report if the bright spot's getting any smaller. I wish you\nweren't here, Deirdre!\"\n\nThe two crew-cuts moved to obey. Terry, alone, had no specific duty\nassigned to him on the yacht, unless tending to the recorder was it. He\nbent over the instrument which was playing in the air anything that a\ntrailing microphone picked up under water. He raised the volume a\ntrifle. He could still hear the singular noises of the agitated fish\nmixed in with the thin, strangely offensive humming sound. He heard\nsmall thumpings, and realized that they were the footfalls of his\ncompanions on the deck of the _Esperance_, transmitted to the water. He\nheard ...\n\nTony came abovedecks with an armful of mysterious-looking objects which\ncould not be seen quite clearly in the slanting moonlight. He put two of\nthem down by the wheel and passed out the others. He silently left one\nfor Terry and another for Deirdre, while Terry adjusted tone and volume\non the recorder for maximum clarity.\n\n\"What are those?\" asked Terry.\n\n\"Cameras,\" said Deirdre. \"Mounted on rifle stocks, with flashbulbs in\nthe reflectors. You aim, pull the trigger, and the shutter opens as the\nflashbulb goes off. So you get a picture of whatever you aim at, night\nor day.\"\n\n\"Why ...\"\n\n\"There was a time when my father thought they might be useful,\" said\nDeirdre. \"Then it looked like they wouldn't. Now it looks like they\nmay.\"\n\nTerry was tempted to say, \"Useful for what?\" But Davis' vague talk of\nunpleasant wrong guesses which led to even less pleasant ones had\nalready been an admission that no convincing answer could be given him.\nDavis came over to him.\n\n\"This has me worried,\" he said in a frustrated tone of indecision. \"We\nmust be near the end of some process that I didn't suspect, and the\nconclusion of which I can't guess. I don't know what it is, and I don't\nknow what it's for. I only know what it's tied in with.\"\n\nTerry said absorbedly, \"Two or three times I've picked up some new kinds\nof sounds. You might call them mooing noises. They're very faint, as if\nthey were far away, and there are long intervals between them. I don't\nthink they come from the surface.\"\n\nDavis made an irresolute gesture. He seemed to hesitate over something\nhe was inclined to accept. Deirdre protested before he could speak. \"I\ndon't think what you're thinking is right!\" she said firmly. \"Not a bit\nof it! Whatever happens will be connected with the fish. _La Rubia_ has\nbeen around this sort of thing over and over again! We haven't been\nrunning the engine and we haven't been making any specific noises in the\nwater to arouse curiosity! If anything were going to happen to us, it\nwould have happened to _La Rubia_ before now! It would be ridiculous to\nrun away just because I'm on board!\"\n\nTerry, bent intently over the recorder, suddenly felt a cold chill run\nup and down his spine. His mind told him it was ridiculous to associate\ndistant mooing sounds, underwater, with a completely unprecedented,\nfrantic gathering of fish into one small area, and come up with the\nthought that something monstrous and plaintive was coming blindly to\nfeed upon fellow creatures of the sea. There was nothing to justify the\nthought. It was out of all reason. But his spine crawled, just the same.\n\n\"The circle's only eight hundred yards across, now,\" said Davis,\nuneasily. \"The fish can't crowd together any closer! But Doug went\noverboard with diving goggles, and he says there's a column of\nbrightness as far down as he can make out.\"\n\nTerry looked up.\n\n\"He went overboard? Didn't he tingle?\"\n\n\"He said it was like baby nettles all over,\" Davis protested, as if it\nwere someone's fault. \"But he didn't sting after he came out. It must\nbe ...\"\n\nA mooing sound came out of the recorder. It was fainter than the other\nsounds and very far away. It must have been of terrific volume where it\noriginated. It lasted for many seconds, then stopped.\n\n\"I should have been recording,\" said Terry. \"That sound comes up about\nevery five minutes. I'll catch it next time.\"\n\nDavis went away, as if he wanted to miss the noise and the decision it\nwould force upon him. Yet Terry told himself obstinately that there was\nno reason to connect the mooing sound with the crazed fish herd half a\nmile away. But somehow he couldn't help thinking there might be a\nconnection.\n\nThe ship's clock sounded seven bells. Deirdre said, \"The brightness is\nreally smaller now!\" The patch of flashes was no more than half its\noriginal size. Terry pressed the recording button and straightened up to\nlook more closely. Right then Deirdre said sharply, \"Listen!\"\n\nSomething new and quite unlike the mooing noise now came out of the\nrecorder.\n\n\"Get your father,\" commanded Terry. \"Something's coming from somewhere!\"\n\nDeirdre ran across the heaving deck. Terry shifted position so he could\nmanipulate the microphone hanging over the yacht's side into the water.\nDavis arrived. His voice was suddenly strained and grim. \"Something's\ncoming?\" he demanded. \"Can you hear any engine noise?\"\n\n\"Listen to it,\" said Terry. \"I'm trying to get its bearing.\"\n\nHe turned the wire by which the submarine ear hung from the rail. The\nchirpings and squealings and squeakings changed volume as the microphone\nturned. But the new sound, of something rushing at high speed through\nthe water--that did not change. Terry rotated the mike through a full\ncircle. The fish noises dwindled to almost nothing, and then increased\nagain. The volume of the steady hum changed with them. But the rushing\nsound remained steady. Rather, it grew in loudness, as if approaching.\nBut the directional microphone didn't register any difference, whether\nit received sound from the north, east, south, or west.\n\nIt was a booming sound. It was a rushing sound. It was the sound of an\nobject moving at terrific speed through the water. There was no engine\nnoise, but something thrust furiously through the sea, and the sound\ngrew louder and louder.\n\n\"It's not coming from any compass course,\" said Terry shortly. \"How deep\nis the water here?\"\n\n\"We're just over the edge of the Luzon Deep,\" said Davis. \"Four thousand\nfathoms. Five. Maybe six.\"\n\n\"Then it can only be coming from one direction,\" said Terry. \"It's\ncoming from below. And it's coming up.\"\n\nFor three heartbeats Davis stood perfectly still. Then he said, with\nextreme grimness, \"Since you mention it, that would be where it's coming\nfrom.\"\n\nHe turned away and shouted a few orders. The crewmen scurried swiftly.\nThe yacht's head fell away from the wind. Terry listened again to the\nrushing sound. There seemed to be regular throbbings in it, but still no\nengine noise. It was a steady drone.\n\n\"Bazooka shells ought to discourage anything,\" Davis said in an icy\nvoice. \"If it attacks, let go at it. But try to use the gun-cameras\nfirst.\"\n\nThe _Esperance_ rolled and wallowed. Her bows lifted and fell. Her sails\nwere black against the starry sky overhead. Two of the crew-cuts settled\nthemselves at the starboard rail. They had long tubes in their hands,\ntubes whose details could not be seen. The wind hummed and thuttered in\nthe rigging. Reef-points pattered. Near the port rail the recorder\npoured out the amplified sounds its microphone picked up from the sea.\nThe sound of the coming thing became louder than all the other noises\ncombined. It was literally a booming noise. The water started to bubble\nfuriously as it parted to let something rise to the surface from\nunthinkable depths.\n\nDoug put two magazine-rifles beside Terry and Deirdre, then he moved\naway. Deirdre had a clumsy object in her hands. It had a rifle-stock and\na trigger. What should have been the barrel was huge--six inches or more\nin diameter--but very short. That was the flashbulb reflector. The\nactual camera was small and on top, like a sight.\n\n\"We'll aim these at anything we see,\" said Deirdre composedly, \"and pull\nthe trigger. Then we'll pick up the real rifles and see if we must\nshoot. Is that all right?\"\n\nShe faced the shining patch of ocean. Davis and the crew-cut at the\nwheel faced that way. Tony and Jug stood with the clumsy tubes of\nbazookas facing the same direction. Doug had taken a post forward, with\na camera-gun and a magazine rifle. He had the camera in hand, to use\nfirst.\n\nIt seemed that hours passed, but it must have been just a few minutes.\nNothing out of the ordinary seemed to be taking place anywhere. The moon\nnow shone down from a sky in which a few thin wisps of cloud glowed\namong the stars. Sharp-peaked waves came from one horizon and sped\nbusily toward the other. The yacht pitched and rolled, its company\nstrangely armed and expectant. The recorder gave out a droning, booming,\nrushing sound which grew louder with ever-increasing rapidity. Now the\nsound reached a climax.\n\nFrom the very center of the glinting circle of sea, there was a\nmonstrous splashing sound. A phosphorescent column rose furiously from\nthe waves. It leaped. Water fell back and ... something soared into the\nair. Sharp, stabbing flashes of almost intolerably white light flared\nup. The gun-cameras fired their flashbulbs without a sound.\n\nIt was then that Terry saw it--in mid-air. He swung the gun-camera, and\na flash from another gun showed him that he would miss. He jerked the\ngun to bear and pulled the trigger. The flash illuminated _it_ vividly.\nThen night again.\n\nIt was torpedo-shaped and excessively slender but very long. It could\nhave been a living thing, frozen by the instantaneous flash. It could\nhave been something made of metal. It leaped a full fifty feet clear of\nthe waves and then tumbled back into the ocean with a colossal splash.\nThen there was silence, except for the sounds of the sea. Terry had the\nmagazine-rifle still in his hands. Tony and Jug waited with their\nbazookas ready. It occurred to Terry that yachts are not customarily\narmed with bazookas.\n\n\"That--wasn't a whale,\" said Deirdre unsteadily.\n\nThe recorder bellowed suddenly. It was the hum that had been heard\nbefore: the nasty, sixty-cycle hum that surrounded the captive fish. But\nit was ten, twenty, fifty times as loud as before.\n\nThe fish in the bright-sea area went mad. The entire surface whipped\nitself to spray, as fish leaped frenziedly to get out of the water,\nwhich stung and burned where it touched.\n\nThen, very strangely, the splashing stopped. The brightness of the sea\ndecreased. A while later the enormous snarling sound was noticeably less\nloud than it had been at that first horrible moment.\n\nThe wind blew. The waves raced. The _Esperance's_ bow lifted and dipped.\nThe noise from the loudspeaker system--the noise from the sea--decreased\neven more. One could hear the squeakings and chitterings of fish again.\nBut they were very much fainter. Presently the humming was no louder\nthan before the strange apparition. By that time the fish-sound had died\naway altogether. The nearer normal noises remained. The hum was\nreceding. Downward.\n\nDavis came to Terry, where he stood by the recording instrument.\n\n\"The fish have gone,\" he said in a flat voice, \"they've gone away. They\ndidn't scatter. We'd have seen it. Do you realize where they went?\"\n\nTerry nodded.\n\n\"Straight down. Do you want to hear an impossible explanation?\"\n\n\"I've thought of several,\" said Davis.\n\nDoug came and picked up the gun-cameras that Terry and Deirdre had used\nand went away with them.\n\n\"There's a kind of sound,\" said Terry, \"that fish don't like. They won't\ngo where it is. They try to get away from it.\"\n\nDeirdre said quietly, \"I would too, if I were swimming.\"\n\n\"Sound,\" said Terry, \"in water as in air, can be reflected and directed,\njust as light can be. A megaphone turns out one's voice in a cone of\nnoise, like a reflector on a light. It should be possible to project it.\nOne can project a hollow cone of light. Why not a hollow cone of sound,\nin water?\"\n\nDavis said with an unconvincingly ironic and skeptical air, \"Indeed, why\nnot?\"\n\n\"If such a thing were done,\" said Terry, \"then when the cone of sound\nwas turned on, the fish inside it would be captured as if by a conical\nnet. They couldn't swim through the walls of sound. And then one can\nimagine the cone made smaller; the walls drawn closer together. The fish\nwould be crowded together in what was increasingly like a vertical,\nconical net, but with walls of unbearable noise instead of cord. It\nwould be as if the sea were electrified and the fish were shocked when\nthey tried to pass a given spot.\"\n\n\"Preposterous, of course,\" said Davis. But his tone was not at all\nunbelieving.\n\n\"Then suppose something were sent up to the top of the cone, and it\nprojected some kind of a cover of sound on the top of the cone and\nimprisoned the fish with a lid of sound they couldn't endure. And then\nsuppose that thing sank into the water again. The fish couldn't swim\nthrough the walls of noise around them. They couldn't swim through the\nlid of sound above them. They'd have to swim downward, just as if a hood\nwere closing on them from above.\"\n\n\"Very neat,\" said Davis. \"But of course you don't believe anything of\nthe sort.\"\n\n\"I can't imagine what would produce that sound in that way and send up a\ncork of sound to take the fish below. And I can't imagine why it would\nbe done. So I can't say I believe it.\"\n\nDavis said slowly, \"I think we begin to understand each other. We'll\nstay as close to this place as we can until dawn, when we will find\nnothing to show that anything out of the ordinary happened here.\"\n\n\"Still less,\" said Terry, \"to hint at its meaning. I've been doing sums\nin my head. That bright water was almost solid with fish. I'd say there\nwas at least a pound of fish to every cubic foot of sea.\"\n\n\"An underestimate,\" said Davis judicially.\n\n\"When the bright patch was a thousand yards across--and it was even\nmore--there'd have been four hundred tons of fish in the top three-foot\nlayer.\"\n\nDavis seemed to start. But it was true. Terry added, \"The water was\nclear. We could see that the packing went on down a long way. Say fifty\nyards at least.\"\n\n\"Y-yes,\" agreed Davis. \"All of that.\"\n\n\"So in the top fifty yards, at one time, there were at least twenty\nthousand tons of fish gathered together. Probably very much more. What\n_La Rubia_ carried away couldn't be noticed. All those thousands of tons\nof fish were pushed straight down. Tell me,\" said Terry, \"what would be\nthe point in all those fish being dragged to the bottom? I can't ask who\nor what did it, or even why. I'm asking, what results from it?\"\n\nDavis grunted.\n\n\"My mind stalls on who or what and why. And I'd rather not mention my\nguesses. I.... No!\"\n\nHe moved abruptly away.\n\nThe _Esperance_ remained under sail near the patch of sea that had\nglittered earlier and now looked exactly like any other square mile of\nocean. The recorder verified the position by giving out, faintly, the\nsame unpleasant humming noise, either louder or fainter. A soft warm\nwind blew across the waters. The land was somewhere below the horizon.\nThe reel of recorder-tape ran out. It was notable that there were very\nfew fish sounds to be heard, now. Very few. But the hum continued.\n\nToward morning it stopped abruptly. Then there was nothing out of the\nordinary to be observed anywhere.\n\nThe sun rose in magnificent colorings. The sky was clear of clouds.\nAgain the waves looked like living, leaping, joyous things. Gulls were\nsquawking.\n\nDoug came up from belowdecks. He carried some photographic prints in his\nhand. He'd developed and printed what the gun-cameras had photographed\nwhen the mysterious object, or beast, leaped clear of the sea. There\nwere seven different pictures. Four showed flashbulb-lighted sections of\nempty ocean. One showed a column of sea water rising at fantastic height\nfrom the sea. Another one showed the edge of something at the very edge\nof the film.\n\nThe seventh picture Terry recognized. It was what he'd seen when the\nflashbulb of his gun-camera went off. The focus was not sharp. But it\nwas neither a whale nor a blackfish--not even a small one--nor was it a\nshark. It was not a squid. It was not even a giant manta. The picture\nwas a blurry representation of something unreal made for an unimaginable\npurpose, under abnormal conditions.\n\nDeirdre looked at it over his shoulder. It could be a living creature.\nIt could be ... anything.\n\n\"You said you didn't like mysteries,\" commented Deirdre. \"Are you sorry\nyou came?\"\n\n\n\n\n_Four_\n\n\nThe next morning the _Esperance_ headed southeast over a sunlit sea.\nFirst, of course, the crew examined the sea's surface for miles around.\nAs expected, there was nothing remarkable to be observed. Davis did\npoint out that there were no fish jumping, which was an indication that\nthere were not as many fish as usual in this part of the ocean. But it\nwas hard to be sure. There is no normal number of times when fish will\nbe seen to jump. They usually jump to escape larger fish that want to\neat them. The number is pure chance. But there seemed to be almost no\njumps at all this morning.\n\nIt was not discussed at length, however. All the ship's company was\ncuriously reluctant to refer to the events of the previous night. In\nbroad daylight, a detached review was simply impractical. With gulls\nsquawking all about, with seas glinting in the sunshine, with decks to\nbe washed and breakfast to be eaten, and commonplace, routine\nship-keeping to be done, the adventure of the patch of shining sea\nseemed highly improbable. Terry felt that it couldn't really have\nhappened. To discuss it seriously would be like a daylight ghost tale.\nOne was unable to believe it in daylight. It was better ignored.\n\nTerry, though, did get out his tools to make a minor modification in the\nunderwater microphone. It had been designed to be directional, so that\nthe sound of surf or fish could be located by turning the mike, but he\nhadn't been able to point it vertically downward, and last night that\nhad been the key direction--right under the yacht's keel. So now he\nimprovised gimbals for the microphone, and a mounting for it similar to\nthat of a compass, so it could tilt in any desired direction, as well as\nturn.\n\nWhich, of course, was a tacit admission that something peculiar had\nhappened. Presently, Deirdre came and watched him.\n\n\"What's that for?\" she asked, when he fitted the gimbals in place.\n\nHe told her. She said hesitantly, \"Yesterday, when I asked you not to\ntry the paddle until we got to shallow water, you got angry and said\nyou'd ask to be put ashore. We're headed for Barca now. Someone there is\nbuilding something for my father, the same thing I had asked you to\nbuild--a fish-driving instrument. If you still want to go, you can get a\nbus from there to Manila. But I hope you have changed your mind.\"\n\n\"I have,\" said Terry dourly. \"I told your father so. I was irritated\nbecause I couldn't get any answers to the questions I asked. Now I've\ngot some questions your father wants answers to. And I'm going to try to\nfind them out.\"\n\nDeirdre sighed, perhaps in relief.\n\n\"I put some pictures and a clipping in a book on the cabin table,\" she\nsaid. \"Did you see them?\"\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"What did you think?\"\n\n\"That you put them for me to see,\" he said.\n\n\"It was to make you realize that we can't answer every question, which\nyou know now.\"\n\n\"I still think you could answer a few more than you have,\" he observed.\n\"But let it go. Is the Barca harbor shallow?\"\n\n\"Ten, fifteen feet at low tide,\" she informed him. \"We're having a sort\nof dredge made there. Something to go down into the sea, take pictures,\nget samples of the bottom, and then come up again. There's an\noceanographic ship due in Manila shortly, by the way. It will have a\nbathyscaphe on board. Maybe that will help find out some answers.\" Then\nshe said uncomfortably, \"I have a feeling the bathyscaphe isn't ...\nsafe.\"\n\nHe glanced up.\n\n\"_Ellos?_\" He grinned as she looked sharply at him. Then he said, \"This\ndredge: isn't it pretty ambitious for a boat this size to try to dredge\nsome thousands of fathoms down?\"\n\n\"It's a free dredge,\" she said. \"It will sink by itself and come up by\nitself. There's no cable. What are you doing now?\"\n\nHe'd put away the submarine microphone he'd just altered and was now\ntaking out the still untested underwater horn.\n\n\"I'm going to try to make this directional, too,\" he said. \"In fact, I'm\ngoing to try to make it project sound in a beam shaped like a fan. A\nhollow cone may come later.\"\n\nShe was silent. The _Esperance_ sailed on.\n\n\"Ever talk to the skipper of _La Rubia_?\" he asked presently.\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n\"You should. He's a stupendous, self-confident liar,\" said Terry. \"He\nlies automatically. Gratuitously. A completely amiable man, but he can't\ntell the truth without stopping to think.\"\n\n\"We found that out,\" said Deirdre. \"I didn't. Someone else.\"\n\n\"Is this another censored subject, or can I ask what happened?\"\n\n\"I'd better see about lunch,\" said Deirdre quickly.\n\nShe got up and left. Terry shrugged. The day before yesterday, or even\nyesterday, he'd have been indignant. But then he'd known these people\nhad secrets in which he had no share. Today he was beginning to share\nthose secrets, and he had fabulously nonsensical material on which to\nwork on his own. He had strange ideas about the event of last night. He\ndid not quite believe them, but he thought he had devised some ways to\nsee how much of truth they contained, if any. Deirdre could keep her\nsecrets, so long as he did not have to disclose his own wildly\nimaginative ideas.\n\nThe routine of the yacht went on. It was in a way a very casual routine.\nDavis gave orders when the need arose, but there was no formal\ndiscipline; there was co-operation. Terry heard one of the crew-cuts ask\nDeirdre a question using her first name. It would have been highly\nimprobable in a paid crew, but it was reasonable enough in a volunteer\nexpedition. He heard Deirdre say, \"Why don't you ask him?\"\n\nThe crew-cut, Tony, came to the part of the deck where Terry worked.\n\n\"We got into an argument,\" he said without preface. \"We were talking\nabout that ... 'whale' last night.\"\n\nTerry nodded. The use of the term \"whale\" was a deliberate pretense that\nthe previous night's events were natural and normal.\n\n\"How fast do you think it was traveling when it broached?\" asked Tony.\n\"I know a whale can jump clear of the water. I've seen it in the movies.\nBut that one jumped awfully high!\"\n\n\"I hadn't tried to estimate it,\" said Terry.\n\n\"You've got a tape of the noise,\" said Tony. \"Could you time the\ninterval between the sound when it left the water, and the splash when\nit fell back?\"\n\n\"Mmm. Yes,\" said Terry. He looked up. \"Of course.\"\n\n\"It would be interesting to do it,\" said Tony, semicasually. Then he\nadded hastily, \"I've read somewhere that whales have been clocked at\npretty high speeds. If we can find out how long its leap lasted, we\ncould know how fast it was going.\"\n\nTerry considered for a moment, and then got out the recorder. He played\nthe tape for a moment, and skipped forward to later parts of the record\nuntil he came to the place where the unpleasant humming sound was loud,\nand finally reached the beginning of the rushing noise. That, in turn,\nhad preceded the leap of the object photographed by the gun-cameras.\n\nTerry glanced at his watch when the rushing started. He timed the period\nof ascent of the noise, while it grew louder and louder and became a\nbooming sound, which was at its loudest the instant before it ceased. At\nthat moment the mysterious object had leaped out of the sea. The splash\nof its re-entry came long seconds later.\n\nTony timed the leap. When the splash came he made his calculations\nabsorbedly, while Terry switched off the recorder.\n\n\"It would take the same amount of time going up as it does coming down,\"\nsaid Tony, scribbling numbers. \"Since we know how fast things fall, when\nwe know how long they fall we can tell how fast they were traveling when\nthey landed, and therefore when they leaped.\"\n\nHe multiplied and divided.\n\n\"Sixty miles an hour, roughly,\" he pronounced. \"The whale was going\nsixty miles an hour straight up when it left the water! What can swim\nthat fast?\"\n\n\"That's your question,\" said Terry. \"Here's one of mine. We heard it\ncoming for five minutes ten seconds. How deep is the water where we\nwere?\"\n\n\"About forty-five hundred fathoms.\"\n\n\"If we assume that it came from the bottom, it must have been traveling\nat least sixty miles an hour when it broke surface,\" said Terry.\n\n\"But can a whale swim sixty miles an hour?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Terry.\n\nTony hesitated, opened his mouth, closed it, and went away.\n\nTerry returned to the changing of the submarine horn. Sound has its own\ntricks underwater. If you know something about them you can produce some\nremarkable results. A deliberately made underwater signal can be heard\nthrough an unbelievable number of thousands of miles of seawater. But,\nexcept through a yet untested fish-driving paddle, Terry had never heard\nof fish being herded by sound. Still, fish can be stunned or killed by\nconcussions. They have been known to be made unconscious by the noise\nof a very near submarine bell. It wasn't unreasonable that a specific\nloud noise could make a barrier no fish would try to cross. But there\nwere still some parts of last night's events that did not fit into any\nrational explanation.\n\nDavis came over to Terry.\n\n\"I think,\" he said, \"that we may have missed a lot of information by not\nhaving submarine ears before. There may have been all sorts of noises we\ncould have heard.\"\n\n\"Possibly,\" agreed Terry.\n\n\"We're more or less in the position of savages faced with phenomena they\ndon't understand,\" said Davis vexedly. \"The simple problems of savages\nrange from what produces thunder to what makes people die of disease.\nSavages come up with ideas of gods or devils doing such things for\nreasons of their own. We can't accept ideas of that sort, of course!\"\n\n\"No,\" agreed Terry, \"we can't.\"\n\n\"But what happened last night,\" said Davis, \"is almost as mysterious to\nus as thunder to a savage. A savage would blame it on devils or\nwhatnot.\"\n\n\"Or on _ellos_,\" said Terry.\n\n\"He'd imagine a personality behind it, yes,\" said Davis. \"He does things\nbecause he wants to, so he thinks all natural phenomena occur because\nsomebody wants them to. He has no idea of natural law, so he tries to\nimagine what kind of person--what kind of god or devil--does the things\nhe notices. It's a natural way to think.\"\n\n\"Very likely,\" admitted Terry. \"But the point?\"\n\n\"Is that we mustn't fall into a savage's way of thinking about last\nnight's affair.\"\n\nTerry said, \"I couldn't agree with you more. But just what are you\ndriving at?\"\n\n\"There's a dredge being made for me in Barca. I'm afraid you may suspect\nthat I'm trying to--stir up something with it. To poke something we\n_know_ is somewhere but can't identify. I didn't want you to try the\nfish-paddle in deep water, that's true. But....\"\n\n\"You're explaining,\" said Terry, \"that you didn't want me to whack a\nfish-driving paddle overside in deep water.\"\n\nDavis hesitated, and then nodded.\n\n\"The phenomena you're interested in are under water?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Davis. \"They are in the Luzon Deep area.\"\n\n\"Then, to be co-operative, I'll test this contrivance in ten to fifteen\nfeet of water in the Barca harbor. And I will not get temperamental\nabout your suggestions that I should not mess up your deep-water\ninquiries.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" said Davis.\n\nHe went forward to meet Nick, just coming abovedecks with a slip of\npaper in his hand. It occurred to Terry, suddenly, that somebody went\nbelow down the forecastle hatch just about every hour on the hour. They\nmust be in short-wave communication with Manila. It had been mentioned\nlast night--a loran fix on the _Esperance's_ position. There were\napparently frequent reports to somebody somewhere.\n\nThe afternoon went by. A tree-lined shore appeared to the eastward just\nwhen the gaudy colorings of a beautiful sunset filled all the western\nsky. The _Esperance_ changed course and followed the coast line, some\nmiles out. Night fell. The yacht sailed with a fine smooth motion over\nthe ocean swells.\n\nAfter dinner Davis was below, fiddling with the knobs to pick up\nshort-wave music from San Francisco, and the muted sound of an argument\ncame occasionally from the forecastle where the four crew-cuts resided.\nTerry and Deirdre went on deck.\n\n\"My father,\" said Deirdre, \"says you understand each other better, now.\nHe doesn't think you're going to feel offended with us, and he's really\npleased. He says your mind doesn't work like his, but you come to more\nor less the same conclusions, which makes it likely the conclusions are\nright.\"\n\nTerry grimaced.\n\n\"My conclusion,\" he observed, \"is that I haven't enough facts yet to\ncome to any conclusion.\"\n\n\"Of course!\" said Deirdre. \"Just like my father!\"\n\nThey sat in silence. It was not exactly a tranquil stillness. It was\npleasant enough to be here on the slanting deck of a beautiful yacht,\ndriving competently through dark seas under a canopy of stars. But now\nTerry realized he was constantly aware of Deirdre. He liked her. But\nhe'd liked other people, male and female, without being continually\nconscious of their existence. Girls are usually more conscious of such\nthings than men. At least ninety-nine per cent of the time, a man does\nnot modify his behavior because of the age, sex, and marital status of\nthe people he comes in contact with. It isn't relevant to most of what\nhe says and does. But a girl frequently modifies her actions in just\nsuch circumstances. Deirdre was well aware of the slightly uneasy,\nextremely interested state of Terry's mind. There was silence for a long\ntime. Then a shooting star went across the sky. It went out.\n\n\"Would you like to hear something really wild?\" asked Deirdre, ruefully.\n\"That shooting star, just then. It used to be true that more\nmeteorites--shooting stars--had fallen and been recovered in Kansas than\nany other place in the world. But it would be ridiculous to think they\naimed for Kansas, wouldn't it?\"\n\nTerry nodded, not following at all.\n\n\"At Thrawn Island,\" said Deirdre, \"since the satellite-tracking station\nhas been built, space-radars have picked up more bolides--big\nmeteors--coming in to fall in the Luzon Deep than ever in Kansas or\nanywhere else. I think my father frets over that, simply because he's so\nconcerned about the Luzon Deep.\"\n\nTerry heard himself saying irrelevantly, \"I'd like to ask you a few\nstrictly personal questions, Deirdre. What's your favorite food? What\nmusic do you like? Where would you like best to live? When....\"\n\nDeirdre turned her head to smile at him.\n\n\"I've been wondering,\" she said, \"if you thought of me only as a fellow\nresearcher or whether you'd noticed that I'm a person, too. Hmmmmm.\nThere's a restaurant in Manila where they still cut their steaks along\nthe muscle instead of across it, but where they make some unheard-of\ndishes. That place has some of my favorite foods. And....\"\n\n\"Next time we're in Manila we'll try it,\" said Terry. \"Now, I know a\nplace....\"\n\nThe _Esperance_ went on. Presently, the moon rose and moonlight glinted\non the waves while the stars looked cynically down on the small yacht\nupon the sea. And two people talked comfortably and absorbedly about\nthings nobody else would have thought very interesting.\n\nWhen Terry turned in for the night he realized pleasantly that he was\nvery glad he'd let himself be persuaded to join the _Esperance's_\ncompany.\n\nDawn came. Terry was already on deck when the _Esperance_ threaded her\nway into a small harbor. There were palm trees along the shore, and\nthere was a Philippine town with edifices ranging from burnt brick to\nstucco to mere nipa huts on its outskirts. Two-man fishing boats were\nmaking their way out from the shore on which they'd been beached. From\nsomewhere came the staccato, back-firing noise of an old\nautomobile-engine being warmed up for the day's work. It would\nundoubtedly be the bus for Manila. But it was not thinkable that Terry\nshould take it, now.\n\nThe yacht dropped anchor and lay indolently at rest while her crew\nbreakfasted and the morning deck routine was being performed. Then\nDeirdre appeared in shore-going clothes of extreme femininity. Davis too\nwas dressed otherwise than as usual.\n\n\"We're going ashore to the shipyard,\" he told Terry. \"If you'd like to\ncome--\"\n\n\"I've something to do here,\" said Terry.\n\nTwo of the crew-cuts got a boat overside and headed it for the shore.\nTerry got out the recorder and the submarine ear and horn. He set up his\napparatus for a test. Tony came from belowdecks and watched. Then he\ncame closer.\n\n\"If I can help,\" he said tentatively.\n\n\"You can,\" Terry told him. \"But let's listen to what the fish are\nsaying, first.\"\n\nHe dropped over the submarine ear and started the recorder to play what\nit picked up, but without recording it. Sounds from underwater came out\nof the speakers. The slappings of tiny harbor-waves against the yacht's\nplanking; the chunking, rhythmic sound of oars from a fishing boat which\nwas rowing after the half-dozen that had gone out earlier; grunting\nsounds. Those were fish.\n\nTerry listened critically, and Tony with interest. Then Terry brought\nout the fish-driving paddle. He turned on the tape, now, to have a\nrecord of the sound the paddle made.\n\n\"Whack this on the water,\" he suggested, \"and we'll hear how it sounds.\"\n\nTony went down the ladder and gave the water surface a few resounding\nwhacks. There were tiny, violent swirlings. For thirty or forty feet\nfrom the _Esperance's_ side there were isolated, minute turmoils in the\nwater. Three or four fish actually leaped clear of the surface.\n\n\"Not bad!\" said Tony. \"Shall I whack some more?\"\n\nTerry reeled back a few feet of the tape which contained the whacking\nsounds. He re-played them, listening critically as before. Tony had\nreturned to the deck. The whackings, as heard underwater, were not\nmerely impacts. There was a resonance to them. Almost a hum. Rather\ngrimly, Terry substituted this tape-reel with the recording he'd made\nthe night before. He started the instrument and found the exact spot\nwhere the object from the depths had fallen back into the sea. He\nstopped the recorder right there. He hauled up the submarine ear and\nplugged in the horn to the audio-amplifier, as yet untested, which\nshould multiply the volume of sound from the tape. Then he put the horn\noverside.\n\nHe switched on the recorder again. The tape-reel began to spin. The\nsound went out underwater from the horn. Underwater it was much louder\nthan when it had been received by the _Esperance's_ microphone. Here it\nwas confined by the surface above and the harbor-bottom beneath. It must\nhave been the equivalent of a loud shout in a closed room--only worse.\n\nThe fish in the harbor of Barca went mad. All the harbor-surface turned\nto spray. Creatures of all sizes leaped crazily above the surface, their\nfins flapping, only to leap again, more frantically still, when they\nfell back. A totally unsuspected school of very small flying fish\nflashed upward in such frenzied haste that some tried to climb too\nsteeply and fell back and instantly flung themselves into the air again.\n\nTerry turned off the playing recorder. The disorder at the top of the\nwater ceased immediately. But he heard shrill outcries. Children had\nbeen wading at the edge of the shore. They stampeded for solid ground,\nshrieking. Where their feet and legs had been underwater they felt as if\na million pins and needles had pricked them.\n\nSomething flapped heavily on the _Esperance's_ deck. Tony went to see.\nIt was a three-pound fish which had leaped clear of the water and over\nthe yacht's rail to the deck.\n\nTony threw it back into the water.\n\n\"I guess there's not much doubt,\" he said painfully.\n\n\"Of what?\" demanded Terry.\n\n\"Of what ... I had guessed,\" said Tony.\n\n\"And what did you guess?\"\n\nTony hesitated.\n\n\"I guess,\" he said unhappily, \"that I'd better not say.\"\n\nHe watched with a startled, uneasy expression on his face as Tony put\nthe apparatus away.\n\nTime passed. Davis and Deirdre had been ashore over an hour. Then Terry\nsaw the small boat leave the shore and approach. It came deftly\nalongside, the two passengers climbed up to the deck, and all four\ncrew-cuts hauled the boat back inboard and lashed it fast.\n\n\"Our dredge isn't ready yet,\" said Davis. \"It looks good, but there'll\nbe a delay of a few days.\"\n\nDeirdre examined Terry's expression.\n\n\"Something's happened. What?\"\n\nTerry told her. Davis listened. Tony added what he'd seen, including the\nfish that had leaped high enough out of the water to land on the\n_Esperance's_ deck.\n\n\"After the fact,\" said Davis, \"I can see how it could happen. But....\"\nHe hesitated for a long time and then said, \"This is another case where\nI've been making guesses and hoping I was wrong. And like the others,\nproof that my early guess was wrong makes another guess necessary. And I\ndislike the later guess much more than the first.\"\n\nHe moved restlessly.\n\n\"I'm glad you only tried it once, here,\" he said unhappily. \"We're due\nup at Thrawn Island anyhow. You can work this trick out in the lagoon up\nthere. If there's no reaction to the dredge when we try it, we can try\nthis. But it might be a very violent poke at something we don't quite\nbelieve in. I'd rather try a gentle poke first.\"\n\nHe turned away. In minutes Nick was belowdecks starting the yacht's\nengine, two others of the crew-cuts were hauling up the anchor, and the\nfourth was at the wheel. Without haste, but with celerity, the\n_Esperance_ headed for the harbor-mouth and the open sea.\n\nThey had their midday meal heading north by west. Late in the afternoon\nDeirdre found occasion to talk to Terry about Thrawn Island.\n\n\"It's the China Sea tracking station for satellites,\" she told him.\n\"Some of the staff are friends of my father's. It's right on the edge of\nthe Luzon Deep, and the island's actually an underwater mountain that\njust barely protrudes above the surface. There are some hills, a coral\nreef and a lagoon. It's also terrifically steep, and you can use the\nfish-driving device as much as you please without startling any Filipino\nfishermen.\"\n\n\"You've been there before,\" said Terry.\n\n\"Oh, yes! I told you a fish wearing a plastic object was caught in the\nlagoon there. That was when the station was being built. The men at the\ntracking station fish in the lagoon for fun, and now they're naturally\nwatching out for more ... oddities.\"\n\nThe _Esperance_ sailed on. The crew-cuts went about their various chores\nand talked endlessly, among themselves and with Deirdre, when she joined\nin. Terry felt useless. He trailed the submarine ear overboard and set\nthe recorder to work as an amplifier only. At low volume it played the\nsounds of things below. He kept half an ear cocked toward it for the\nmooing sound he'd picked up at the place where the ocean glittered. He\nheard it again now, and again found it difficult to imagine any cause\nfor it. The sounds uttered by noisemaking fish are usually produced in\ntheir swim-bladders. The purpose of fish cries is as obscure as the\nreason for some insect stridulations, or the song of many birds. But a\nlong-continued fish noise would involve a swim-bladder of large size. At\ngreat depths, if a considerable cavity were filled with gas, under\npressures running into tons to the square inch.... Terry could not\nquite believe it.\n\nHe did not hear the mooing sound any more, as the yacht went on its way.\nOther underwater sounds became commonplace, and he tended not to hear\nthem. From the deck around him, though, he heard arguments about wave\nmechanics, prospects in the World Series, the virtues of Dixieland jazz,\nichthyology, Copeland's contribution to modern music, the possibility of\nlife on other planets, and kindred topics. The crew-cuts were taking\ntheir summer vacations as able seamen on board the _Esperance_, but they\nhad as many and as voluble opinions as any other undergraduates. They\naired them on each other.\n\nThe afternoon passed. Night fell, and dinner was a session of learned\ndiscussion of different subjects, always vehemently argued. Later Terry\ntook the yacht's wheel, Deirdre sat comfortably nearby, and they\ndiscussed matters suitable to their more mature status. They were much\nless intellectual than the crew-cuts. In a few days they developed an\ninterest in each other, but each of them believed this was just a very\npleasant friendship.\n\nEventually, the moon rose. It was close to midnight when Nick bobbed\nbelowdecks and came up with a report that they'd been picked up by the\nThrawn Island radar and were proceeding exactly on course. Half an hour\nlater a tiny light appeared at the edge of the sea. The _Esperance_\nheaded for it, and presently there were breakers to port and starboard,\nthe engine rumbled, down below, and the yacht lifted and fell more\nviolently than ordinary. Then once more she was in glassy-smooth water;\nthe air was very heavy with the smell of green vegetation. Certain\nrectangles of light became visible. They were the windows of the Thrawn\nIsland satellite-tracking installation.\n\nThe _Esperance's_ sails were lowered and she moved toward the lights on\nengine power only. There was no movement ashore, though Nick had talked\nwith the island on short-wave.\n\nAfter a little while the searchlight was put in operation and began to\nreach out like a pencil of brilliant white light. It darted here and\nthere and found a wharf reaching out from the shore to deep water. The\n_Esperance_ floated toward it, her engine barely turning over. There was\nstill no sign of activity, except for the lighted windows.\n\nThe engine stopped, then reversed, and the yacht drifted gently until it\ncontacted the wharfs snubber-pilings. Jug and Tony jumped ashore with\nlines to fasten the yacht. Still no sign of life.\n\n\"Queer,\" said Davis, staring ashore. \"They knew we were coming!\"\n\nA moving light suddenly appeared in the sky. A fireball, which is an\nunusually lurid type of shooting star. It came over the tree-tops and\ncrossed the zenith, leaving a trail of light behind it. It went on and\non, seemingly slowing down, which meant that it was descending from a\nvery high altitude. Its brilliance became more and more intense, then it\ndimmed. At this point the fireball seemed to plunge downward. Then its\nflame went out and only a faint, dull-red speck in motion could be seen.\n\nIt plunged down beyond the trees on the far side of the lagoon. Or so it\nseemed. Actually, it might have plunged into the sea, miles away. Then\nthere was a faint noise which was something between a rumble and a hiss.\nThe sound went back across the sky along the path the fireball had\nfollowed. It died away.\n\nThere was silence. Shooting stars as bright as this one are rare. Most\nmeteors are very small, but they are visible because of the attrition\nproduced by their falling bodies in the atmosphere that sets them on\nfire. They usually appear at around a seventy-mile height, but\nfrequently they are vaporized before they have descended more than\nthirty miles. Sometimes they explode in mid-air and strew the earth with\nfragments. Sometimes they strike ground, leaving monstrous craters where\nthey have fallen. Most meteors fall in the sea. But a meteor has to be\nat least down to twenty miles from sea level before its sound can be\nheard.\n\nSomeone came out of a building and moved toward the wharf, an electric\nlantern bobbing in his hand. Halfway out to the yacht he called,\n\"Davis?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Davis. \"What's happened?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" said the man ashore. \"We were watching for that bolide. It\nwas picked up by space radar a couple of hours ago, but then we figured\nit to land farther on than it did.\"\n\nIt was an educated voice, a scholarly voice.\n\n\"Big?\" asked Davis as the light drew nearer.\n\n\"We've seen them bigger, but not much.\" The man with the lantern reached\nthe end of the wharf. \"Glad to see you. We've got some fish for you, by\nthe way. We caught them in the lagoon. They're waiting for you in the\ndeep-freeze. There's a _Macrourus violaceus_, if we read the books\nright, and a _Gonostoma polypus_. They match the pictures, anyhow. What\ndo you make of that?\"\n\n\"You haven't got them!\" said Davis incredulously. \"You can't have them!\nI'm no fish specialist, but those are abyssal fish! They can only be\ncaught at a depth of two or more miles!\"\n\n\"We caught 'em,\" said the man cheerfully, \"on a hook and line, in the\nlagoon, at night. Come ashore! Everybody'll be glad to see you.\"\n\nDavis protested, \"I won't believe you've got that kind of fish until I\nsee them!\"\n\nThe man with the lantern stepped down to the yacht's deck.\n\n\"All you've got to do is look in the mess hall deep-freeze. The cook's\ncomplaining that they take up space. Nobody wants to find out if they're\ngood to eat. Most unwholesome-looking creatures! And how are you, young\nlady?\" he asked Deirdre. \"We've missed you. Tony, Nick, Jug....\"\n\nDeirdre introduced Terry.\n\n\"Ha!\" said the man. \"They got you enlisted, eh? They were talking about\nit a month ago. You've solved the problem by now, I daresay. Including\nhow these very queer fish happen to be in our lagoon instead of miles\ndown in the Luzon Deep. When you find time, tell me!\"\n\n\"I'll try,\" said Terry reservedly.\n\nThe man went down into the after-cabin and Davis followed him. Deirdre\nsaid amusedly:\n\n\"Dr. Morton's a dear! Don't take him seriously, Terry! He loves to\ntease. He'll hound you to tell him how deep-sea fish got up here and\ninto a shallow lagoon. Please don't mind!\"\n\n\"I won't,\" said Terry. \"I'll tell him tomorrow, I think. I believe now I\nknow how it happened, but I want to check it first.\"\n\n\n\n\n_Five_\n\n\nWhen Terry awoke, next morning, the reflections of sunlight on water\ncame in through the porthole of his cabin. He watched the shimmering\ncontortions of the light spots on the wall. His thoughts went instantly\nback to the subject they'd dwelt on before he went to sleep. The man\nwith the spectacles--Dr. Morton, but his doctorate was in astronomy\ninstead of medicine--had said that Deirdre and his father had discussed\nenlisting him in the _Esperance's_ company a month ago. Deirdre'd come\ninto the shop of Jimenez y C\u00eda. only four days before. Some of the delay\ncould have been caused by time spent in simple sailing from one place to\nanother, mostly on wholly futile errands. They'd gotten a fish-driving\npaddle at Alua. That'd take some days of sailing each way. Apparently,\nthey'd been fumbling at some vague idea of trying to find out what would\nproduce the facts they'd noted. 'Very queer fish,' Davis had said of\nsome of the catches _La Rubia_ had made. The abyssal fish mentioned last\nnight would be very queer fish to catch in a lagoon. Yes....\n\nHe lay still, surveying other aspects of the situation. Davis had called\non an aircraft carrier for electronic items, and the _Esperance_ was in\nconstant touch with somebody by short-wave radio. It might be the same\ncarrier. The Manila police department was on very cordial terms with\nDavis, and the staff of a satellite-tracking installation saved odd\nspecimens of fish for him.\n\nThe _Esperance's_ enterprise was plainly not a brand-new adventure. It\nhad been carried on for some time. They had had technical aid of the\nvery highest caliber, but they hadn't gotten anywhere yet. It did\nappear that Terry had added a minor specialty to the arsenal of\ninvestigative techniques. Without the data gathered on recorder-tape,\ntheir idea of the events of two nights before would be very different.\nThe sea would have seemed very bright, then the glowing area would have\nbeen noted to have grown smaller, and something resembling a whale would\nhave been seen leaping high above the water. Then the brightness would\nhave faded out. It would have been mysterious enough, but an entire\naspect of the phenomenon would have gone unnoticed. There was still no\nanswer to any of the far-reaching questions Terry had asked himself, but\nmost of them had never been asked before. Sea noises had proved to be\nclosely connected to whatever had to be found out. What was known about\nthem was due to his findings. He'd established a new frame of reference.\n\nAnd he'd discovered the solution of a minor problem before the problem\nwas even stated. He had only to prove it. Then, of course, there would\nbe other problems arising from it.\n\nHe got up, put on swimming trunks, and duck trousers over them. He\nslipped into a sweat shirt and went upon deck. Deirdre hailed him.\n\n\"Good morning! Everybody's over at the tracking station, arguing about\nthe bolide that went over last night. According to the radar, it plunged\ninto the sea, miles and miles away.\"\n\n\"What should it have done?\" asked Terry. \"I'm not familiar with\nmeteorites. Are they planning to dive for it?\"\n\n\"Hardly!\" Deirdre laughed. \"It landed in the Luzon Deep.\" She waved a\nhand in an inclusive gesture. \"This island's on the brink of it. A\nbathyscaphe might go down there--in fact, I think it's scheduled; you\nknow, the one I said was coming to Manila on the oceanographic ship? A\nbathyscaphe can go that deep, but it's not likely to hunt for\nmeteorites.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Terry judicially. \"Then what difference does it make where it\nhit?\"\n\n\"It didn't fall the way it should have,\" said Deirdre. \"It was spotted\nby space radar away out, and they tried to compute its path, but they\nfigured it wrong. Now they're trying to make it come out right by\nallowing for the effect of the earth's magnetic field on a metal\nmeteorite. They're arguing and waving equations at each other.\"\n\n\"Let them,\" said Terry. \"I have trouble enough with fish. Do you think I\ncould borrow a boat?\"\n\n\"We've always been able to,\" said Deirdre. Then she added, \"I've kept\nyour breakfast hot. While you eat it I'll get a boat.\"\n\nShe went below, and instants later was up again.\n\n\"I have a feeling,\" she said, \"that something interesting is going to\nhappen. I'll be back.\"\n\nShe swung lightly to the wharf and headed for land. Terry went below, to\nfind his breakfast laid out on the cabin table. He settled down to it,\nbut first pulled a book from the shelves. It was a volume on\noceanography, and its pages showed that it had often been referred to.\nHe found the Luzon Deep described. Its area was relatively small, a mere\nninety-mile-long chasm in the sea-bed. But it was second only to the\nMindanao Deep in its soundings, and a close second at that. Its maximum\ndepth was measured at twenty-seven thousand feet. Over five miles. There\nwas a mention of Thrawn Island as being on the very edge of the Deep.\nAccording to the book, the island was the peak of one of the most\nprecipitous and tallest submarine mountains in the world. Three miles\nfrom where Thrawn Island lay, there were soundings of twenty-eight\nthousand feet and upward. This depth extended as a trench....\n\nThe staccato roaring of an outboard motor sounded some distance away. It\nbellowed toward the yacht, swung about, and cut off. Terry gulped down\nhis coffee and went abovedecks, just as Deirdre was fastening the small\ncraft alongside the yacht.\n\n\"Taxi?\" she asked amiably. \"I got the boat. Where to?\"\n\nTerry swung down and took the steering grip. He headed the boat away.\nThere was a box for bait, a few fishing lines, and even two highly\nprofessional fish-spears on board. Fishing was not necessarily a\nsedentary pastime here.\n\n\"We try the lagoon entrance,\" he said. \"I've an idea. I noticed\nsomething last night, when we came in.\"\n\n\"Do you want to brief me?\"\n\n\"I'd rather not,\" he admitted.\n\nDeirdre shrugged without resentment. The little craft went sturdily\ntoward the passageway to the open sea. She formed an arrowhead of waves\nas she moved. She neared the points of land at the ends of the coral\nformation enclosing the lagoon. Thrawn Island was not an atoll. But the\nbeaches were made of snow-white coral sand. Outside there was clear\nwater for a space and then a reef on which the seas broke.\n\nTerry headed the boat toward the open sea. Almost immediately after,\nthere was nothing but the reef and the sea between the boat and the\nhorizon. He slowed the boat almost to a stop, well within the reef's\ntumult. She swayed and rolled on the surging water.\n\n\"Stay here,\" he commanded. \"I want to swim out and back.\"\n\nHe pulled the sweat shirt over his head. He jumped overboard, leaving\nDeirdre in charge of the boat.\n\nThe world looked strange to him when waves rolled by higher than his\nhead. A few times the sky narrowed to the space between wave-crests.\nOther times he was lifted upon a wave-peak, and the sky was illimitably\nhigh and large, and the breaking seas on the nearby reef merely roared\nand grumbled to themselves.\n\nHe swam out, away from the land. Suddenly his body began to tingle. He\nstopped and paddled, analyzing the sensation. One side of his body felt\nas if the most minute of electric currents entered his skin. It was not\nan unpleasant sensation. Deirdre, in the small boat, was fifty yards\nbehind, watching him. As he swam on, the tingling grew stronger. He\ndived. The tingling did not vary with depth. He came up, and he was\nfarther out than he'd realized.\n\nHe suddenly knew that he'd been incautious. There are currents which\nflow in and out of lagoons. A barrier of reef affects them, too. Terry\nfound himself swimming in an outward-bound current, which pushed him out\nand away from the island.\n\nWithin seconds the sensation in his body changed from a mere tingling\nto torment. For a moment it was just very much stronger and slightly\npainful, but a moment later it felt as if he swam among flames. It was\nunbearable. His muscles were not contracted, as if by an electric shock,\nbut he couldn't control their reflexes. He found himself splashing\ncrazily, trying to fight his way out of the anguish which engulfed him.\n\nHe went under. His body had taken complete control over his mind, and he\nfound himself swimming frantically, underwater. He couldn't reach the\nsurface. His body tried to escape the intolerable agony in which it was\nimmersed but couldn't.\n\nHe heard a roaring sound, but it meant nothing. The roaring grew louder.\nFinally, he did break surface for a few seconds, and he gasped horribly,\nbut then he went under. The roaring grew thunderous, and he broke\nsurface again....\n\nSomething seized his flailing arm and pulled him up. The arm ceased to\nexperience the horrible sensation of being in boiling oil. His hand\nrecognized a gunwale. He swarmed up the solid object with hands helping\nhim, and found himself in the boat, gasping and shivering, and cringing\nat the bare memory of the suffering he'd undergone.\n\nDeirdre stared at him, frightened. She swung the boat's bow shoreward.\nThe outboard motor roared, and the boat raced past the gap in the reef\nand rushed toward the lagoon opening.\n\n\"Are you all right? What happened? You were swimming and suddenly....\"\n\nHe swallowed. His hands quivered. He shook his head and then said\nunsteadily, \"I meant to ... check the reason those queer fish stay in\nthe lagoon. I thought that if they belonged in the depths and were\nsomehow carried out of them, they would try to get back. I found out!\"\n\nHe felt an unreasonable relief when the lagoon entrance was behind the\nboat. The glassy water was reassuring. The _Esperance_ looked like\nsafety itself.\n\n\"I think I know how they got here, now,\" he added. \"We underestimated\nwhat we're trying to understand. I'll be all right in a minute.\"\n\nIt was less than a minute before he shook himself and managed to grin\nwryly at Deirdre.\n\n\"Was there a hum in the water?\" asked Deirdre, still staring at him. \"I\nthought I heard it on the bottom of the boat. Was that the trouble?\"\n\n\"Yes. I wouldn't call it a hum,\" Terry admitted. \"Not any longer. Now I\nknow what a slow fire feels like.\"\n\n\"You frightened me,\" said Deirdre, \"the way you splashed....\"\n\n\"I heard the humming sound,\" said Terry, \"last night when the yacht came\nup to the island. We were perhaps a half-mile off-shore. It was very\nfaint, but I had the amplifier turned down low. The hum was at its\nloudest just before we passed the reef, but nobody else noticed. When\nDr. Morton said there were abyssal fish in the lagoon, I knew why they'd\nbe there. I made a guess at what might drive them there. I went to find\nout if I was right. I found out!\"\n\n\"The hum?\" asked Deirdre again. When he nodded, she said: \"What are you\ngoing to do now? What do you think makes the hum?\"\n\n\"I'm trying hard not to guess what makes the hum,\" Terry told her.\n\"Insufficient data. I need more. I think I'll ask what other odd\nphenomena have turned up in this neighborhood. Foam-patches on the sea?\nI can't imagine a connection, but still....\"\n\nHe swung the little boat alongside the docked _Esperance_ and held out\nhis hand to help Deirdre to the dock. His hand was wholly steady again.\nShe accepted the help.\n\n\"We'll go to the tracking station?\"\n\n\"Yes. Everybody seems to be there,\" said Terry.\n\nThey heard a babble of voices coming from the satellite-tracking\nstation. As they approached the buildings, Terry looked around. Off at\none side there was the very peculiar aerial system by which tiny\nartificial moons circling the earth could be detected by their own\nsignals. Minute spheres and cylinders and spiky objects and\nfoolish-looking paddle-wheels, whirling in their man-appointed rounds,\nsent down signals with powers of mere fractions of a watt. This system\nof aerials picked up those miniature broadcasts and extracted\nremarkable amounts of information from them. It was possible to\ndetermine the satellites' distance more accurately, by a comparison of\nphase-changes in their signals, than if steel tape measures were\nstretched up to make physical contact with them. The accuracy was of the\norder of inches at hundreds of miles. Floating where the stars were\nbright and unwinking lights against blackness and the sun was a disk\nwith writhing arms of fire, the small objects sent back information that\nmen had never possessed before and did not wholly know what to do with\nnow that they did. And there were other objects in the heavens, too.\nThere were satellites which no longer signaled back to earth. Some had\ntheir equipment worn out. Some objects were satellites which had failed\nto function from the beginning. Some were mysteries.\n\nThe bolide of the night before was a mystery. As Terry and Deirdre\nentered the wide verandah of the recreation building for the station's\npersonnel, they heard Dr. Morton protesting, \"But that's out of the\nquestion! I agree that we never know any more about what the Russians\nthrow out to space than what we find out for ourselves. That's true! But\nthis wasn't a terrestrial object! If it was a satellite that wasn't\nlaunched right, it had to be sent up from Russian territory. It wasn't.\nThat's positive! If we assume it was a satellite that had already made\nseveral orbital turns, we must admit it would be an impossible shift in\napogee for it to come down at the angle it did!\"\n\nDeirdre and Terry sat down as someone else said hotly, \"Our observations\nwere wrong. They had to be! The earth's magnetic field couldn't affect\nthe speed of an object _outside_ the atmosphere! Our observations say it\nslowed down. It couldn't!\"\n\nDavis lifted a hand in greeting. The argument stopped for a moment.\nDeirdre was known, but Terry had to be introduced. He was sitting beside\na bald young man who explained in a low tone, as the argument resumed.\n\"They're having fun. They argued for days when our radar picked up an\nempty second stage in orbit. They're still ready to dispute for hours\nabout a supposed retrograde satellite that was spotted last year, was\nwatched for four turns, and then disappeared. Beer?\"\n\n\"Too early,\" said Terry. \"Thanks just the same.\"\n\nDavis said earnestly, at the other side of the room, \"I'd feel a lot\nbetter if that thing last night hadn't splashed where it did.\"\n\n\"The bolide,\" said a voice humorously, \"is a free animal.\"\n\nThe discussion went on. Terry saw Deirdre talking to a middle-aged woman\nwith a splendid sun-tan and a placid expression on her face. Doug and\nTony sat watchfully on the side lines, listening. Doug had been offered,\nand had accepted, a sandwich. He ate it methodically.\n\nTerry had a sudden feeling of unreality. Less than half an hour before\nhe'd been in torment and, but for Deirdre, on his way to death. On the\n_Esperance_ there'd been so much that was absorbing in the way of fish\nbehavior that he'd forgotten some people were interested in other\nthings. Here a dozen people squabbled over the behavior of a meteorite.\nNothing could be of less consequence to the outside world. But in the\noutside world, people argued about baseball, or golf, or politics....\n\nDoug excused himself and slipped outside. Terry joined him there a\nlittle later. Doug was smoking a cigarette, looking at the sky and the\npalms.\n\n\"Pretty heavy discussion,\" said Terry.\n\n\"It's over my head,\" said Doug. \"I got lonesome. It made me think of my\ngirl. She likes to talk like this. That's why ...\"\n\nHe stopped.\n\n\"Is there an aqualung outfit on the _Esperance_?\" asked Terry.\n\n\"Sure! Two or three of them. Mr. Davis had an idea they'd be useful.\nUsed one of them last week to look at the _Esperance's_ bottom-planks.\nWhy?\"\n\n\"I'd like to poke around the bottom of the lagoon a little,\" said Terry,\nwith unconscious grimness. \"Would you help?\"\n\n\"Sure!\" said Doug.\n\nThey went back to the _Esperance_. Doug got out two aqualung outfits.\nThey checked the valves and tanks and connections. Doug brought out two\nspring guns. In half an hour they were in the outboard, headed for what\nDoug said was the deepest part of the lagoon.\n\nArrived there, Terry tested the water with his finger and then went\noverside. Instead of a spring gun, he used one of the fish spears that\nseemed to be standard equipment for fishing, here. Doug stayed in the\nboat to watch.\n\nTerry'd guessed that what he looked for would be in the deepest part of\nthe lagoon. He was right. Within half an hour he'd speared five fish of\ntypes that had no business being within two thousand fathoms of the\nsurface. He ignored the lagoon's normal inhabitants. He picked on fish\nof a dark-red color, which is predominant in the depths but not\nelsewhere. When the fish had extremely small eyes or extremely large\nones, he hunted them determinedly, knowing they were deep-sea fish. He\ncaught five, which was a good haul, even considering his previous\nsuspicions.\n\nDoug inspected the catch as the outboard went back to the yacht. Terry\nreplaced his spear under the gunwale.\n\n\"They're queer fish,\" observed Doug. \"I wouldn't want to eat them.\"\n\n\"Neither would I,\" agreed Terry. \"But I feel a certain sympathy for\nthem. I think we've shared an experience.\"\n\nHe did. Fish so far from their normal environment would not have\nmigrated unless they'd been forced to. So these fish must have been\ndriven up from the blissful utter blackness of the abyss, which was\ntheir habitat. He had a vivid memory of the kind of urging they'd\nreceived, because of his recent swim outside the reef opening. That was\nthe experience he believed they shared.\n\nHe got his catch onto the _Esperance's_ deck and found some sharp knives\nin the galley, while Doug put the aqualungs away. When Doug came\nabovedecks again, he looked distastefully at the work Terry had\nundertaken.\n\n\"Do you like to do that sort of thing?\" he asked.\n\n\"Hardly!\" said Terry. \"But I want to get it done.\"\n\nDoug watched for a moment or two.\n\n\"I'm pretty keen about poetry. Sometimes I feel I've got to sweat over\na poem that I need to get written. It's hard work. There's no real sense\nto it. But I feel it's got to be done. I guess that's the way you feel\nnow.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Terry.\n\nIt wouldn't have occurred to him to liken the writing of verses to the\ndissection of dead deep-sea fish, but Doug had a point. He went away\npresently, and Terry completed the highly unpleasant task. He had just\nfinished flushing the deck clean when Deirdre came back from the\ntracking station. He was already at work on the recorder when she\nstepped onto the deck.\n\n\"You didn't stay,\" said Deirdre. \"I was waiting for a chance to tell my\nfather about the hum outside the lagoon, but he was as deep in the\nmeteor argument as any of them. I still haven't told him.\"\n\n\"There's something else to tell him now,\" Terry remarked. \"I went down\nwith an aqualung. Doug was standing by,\" he added at her gesture of\nprotest, \"and speared some fish that don't belong here. I've dissected\nthem. Their swim bladders had been very skillfully punctured, so if they\nwent or were driven into lesser pressure, they'd leak instead of\nbursting. That's how they survived coming up from the depths. But the\nmain thing is this.\"\n\nHe held out a small plastic object in his hand. It was about an inch in\ndiameter and two in length, and there were inclusions in the clear\nmaterial. There were plates and threads of metal. They had that look of\nmysterious purpose that highly-developed technical devices have.\n\n\"This was fastened to the fin of a fish that belongs as far down as a\nfish can go,\" he said. \"I've found out one of its purposes. When it is\nin the water, it makes a sound more acute than a whistle every time\nanother sound strikes it. Try that on your piano!\"\n\nDeirdre stared.\n\n\"I'm saying,\" he repeated, \"that it takes in one sound and gives out\nanother. It's ... it could be a relay. What is that for? What's it all\nabout? What does it mean? And I ask just those questions because I don't\ndare ask who and why!\"\n\n\"What ... what will you do?\" asked Deirdre absurdly.\n\n\"I've no idea,\" Terry told her. \"I've got a feeling that the wise thing\nto do would be to settle down somewhere and buy a shop, and forget all\nthis. If I don't think about it, maybe it'll go away.\"\n\n\"I'll get my father and see what he says.\"\n\n\"Tell him,\" commanded Terry, \"that I want to try out my fish-driving\nhorn. I'd like to have witnesses. If this foolishness has to be reported\nto somebody, we need evidence of the facts. I want to drive fish and see\nhow many deep-sea ones there are in this lagoon, and how many of them\nhave spy-devices on them.\"\n\nDeirdre turned away. Then she turned back.\n\n\"Spy-dev--\"\n\n\"I slipped,\" said Terry. \"I shouldn't have said that. Forget it. Just\ntell your father I have an extremely urgent impulse to drive fish, and\nwould he come and help.\"\n\nDeirdre looked at him strangely, and went onto the wharf to search for\nher father.\n\nTerry paced back and forth on the _Esperance's_ deck. In a few minutes\nDavis and the crew-cuts appeared with Deirdre. But they were not alone.\nStraggling behind them came nearly all the personnel of the tracking\nstation. There would be somebody on official duty, of course. But here\nwas the bespectacled Dr. Morton; the bald young man who'd offered Terry\nbeer; and the installation cook; a typist, and specialists in radar and\nother abstruse subjects.\n\nDeirdre said, \"I told them about the fish-driving business and they want\nto see. They stopped arguing about last night's bolide to take ringside\nseats. All right?\"\n\nTerry shrugged. He had the recorder already set up. He'd taken a section\nof the tape made where the sea was bright, at the place where the\nloudest of the unpleasant humming noise was recorded. He'd made a loop\nof it so it would play over and over.\n\nHe played the much-amplified sound through the underwater horn held in\nthe air. The result was a raucous bellowing noise. He lowered it into\nthe water. The horn touched the surface and went under.\n\nInstantly, the fish of the lagoon seemed to go crazy. All the surface\nbroke and writhed and splashed. There was an incredible number of fish.\nTerry turned the horn on one side. In this way, not all the water was\nfilled with the intolerable noise, but only a net-like beam of it raced\nacross the water. Within that line the fish continued to leap\nfrenziedly. The rest of the lagoon suddenly quieted down. In a little\nwhile the beam's space, also, grew quiet. But that was because the fish\nthat had been previously caught in it had escaped.\n\n\"I'm afraid,\" said Terry, \"that this isn't going to be very\nentertaining. I'm going to sweep the beam across the lagoon, pushing the\nfish ahead of it, until I should have them all in one small area.\"\n\nIt was curious that he felt uncomfortable as he set about his task. But\nhe'd experienced the sensation this sound produced. And it was not very\npleasant.\n\nHe turned the beam around, slightly. Again, there were sudden\nsplashings. They died away. He turned the beam again. It was a nasty,\nsnarling vibration in the water. So far as fish were concerned, it was\nmore like a wall than a net, because not even the tiniest living\ncreature could penetrate it. Not only fish fled before it. Shrimps and\ncrabs and all types of crustaceans jerked and crawled and swam ahead of\nits motion. Jellyfish writhed when it touched them. Sea cucumbers\ncontorted themselves. Everything that lived in the lagoon and could swim\nor crawl or writhe moved before the invisible barrier. Presently, the\neffect of crowding could be seen, and fish began to leap out of water.\n\n\"This is a great advance in civilization,\" said Dr. Morton. \"Men\ninvented guns and destroyed the buffalo and the passenger pigeon! You\nmay have made it possible to depopulate the sea!\"\n\nTerry did not answer. The morning sun shone brightly, a gentle breeze\nmade ripplings on the lagoon, the palms waved their fronds in languid\ngestures, and the surf could be heard booming and splashing on the outer\nreef. And about two dozen people stood on the wharf or on the\n_Esperance's_ deck and watched a spliced section of recorder-tape go\nthrough and through a recorder, which was set to make a sound underwater\nthat could not be heard by the people above.\n\nThe fish of the lagoon had crowded themselves into a minor embayment of\nthe shore. There were innumerable leapings there.\n\n\"There should be plenty of fish collected now,\" said Terry\ndistastefully. \"I certainly can't herd them ashore.\"\n\nThe outboard boat pushed away from the yacht, its motor roaring. It\nreached the area in which the water seemed to seethe and surge with the\nmotion of densely-crowded swimming creatures. The people in the boat\nexamined the surrounding water, then the boat came back at top speed.\n\n\"They're there!\" called Davis. \"And thick enough to walk on! I clearly\nsaw some freaks that must come up from the bottom! We want to collect\nthem!\"\n\n\"I speared five just now,\" Terry told him, \"and one of them was wearing\nthis.\"\n\nHe held up the plastic object he'd found. There was silence for a\nmoment. Then Dr. Morton said briskly, \"We'll want fish spears. We'll\ntake all the boats and go after some more of these piscatory oddities.\nWho's best with a spear?\"\n\nDavis would go. He could use the two fish spears that were standard\nequipment for the outboard. The staff of the tracking station scattered\nto launch other boats. Only Terry and Deirdre remained on the\n_Esperance_. It was necessary for someone to stand by the recorder.\n\nBoats moved away across the water. One stout member of the island's\nstaff trudged along the shore.\n\n\"You're driving them,\" said Deirdre. \"You are right.\"\n\n\"I wish I weren't,\" said Terry.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"You know how these weird fish got here,\" he said impatiently. \"They\nwere driven here. You know how they've been kept here. I experienced\nthat! I told you why they didn't die when they came up from thousands of\nfathoms! Now, what's the only possible purpose for their being here? Put\nit more scientifically! What is the consequence of these happenings, so\nthat to some biological entity it would be a favorable happening?\" His\ntone was sardonic, at the end.\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"I hope I don't either,\" said Terry dourly.\n\nHe was in no amiable mood. He'd made too many guesses like those Davis\nhad mentioned. He was beginning to have less and less hope that they\nwere untrue. Each new development made any imaginable cause of these\nevents just so much more appalling to think about.\n\nIn an hour, three boats came back from the small bay into which all the\nfish of the lagoon had been crowded. Terry turned off the underwater\nhorn. A stout man walked slowly along the shore with a heavy burden of\nknown edible fish. He was the island's cook, and he had speared them\nfrom the beach. The boats, altogether, had speared and captured not less\nthan sixty specimens of fish normally found only many thousand feet\nbelow the ocean's surface. Upon inspection, all of them were found to\nhave deftly punctured swim bladders, punctured with so slender a barb\nthat the opening would close by itself, except when serving for the\nrelease of intolerably expanding gas.\n\nBefore noon, seven more plastic objects had been found among the\ndeep-sea fish. Three seemed identical to the one Terry had found. Two\nothers were identical to each other but of a different kind, and the\nlast two were of two different types altogether. Only those like the one\ntested by Terry seemed sensitive to sounds, which they changed into\nother sounds at a twenty-thousand-cycle frequency, or higher. The rest\ndid nothing that could be detected.\n\nDuring the afternoon, news came to distract the absorption of the\ntracking station staff in the lagoon's fish. The short-wave operator\ncame running to the wharf, waving a written message. The deck of the\n_Esperance_ was not a pretty sight, just then, with the dissection that\nhad been taking place on it. Jug was beginning to flush the debris\noverside.\n\nThe short-wave operator arrived. Dr. Morton read the message. He raised\nhis voice.\n\n\"Here's a fancy one!\" he told the assembled company. \"Space-radar's\npicked up a new object coming in from nowhere. It will probably orbit\nonce before it hits the air and burns. By the line of motion it should\npass nearly overhead here. We're alerted to get it under observation\nand watch it!\" He waved the message in a large gesture. \"We've got to\nget ourselves set up! The argument on the path of last night's bolide\nand why it fell where it did is again in order. We'll see what we can do\nabout computing the fall-point of this!\"\n\nHe headed for the shore. The staff followed, babbling. Somebody's\nmathematics would be verified, and with it his views on the possible\neffects of terrestrial magnetism on objects approaching the earth.\n\n\"We ought to get these plastic things to Manila,\" Davis said slowly.\n\"They need to be compared to others. But I think we'll wait and see this\nbolide first.\"\n\nA heated argument started in the tracking station staff. From Dr. Morton\ndownward, almost to the station's cook, the most varied predictions were\nmade. The official computation from Washington, made from the observed\ncourse and height and speed, predicted that the bolide would land\nsomewhere in the South Pacific. Dr. Morton predicted a fall in the China\nSea, within a certain precisely stated number of miles from Thrawn\nIsland. Other predictions varied.\n\nAt exactly fourteen minutes after eight--a time way ahead of the\nofficial schedule but exactly as Dr. Morton had predicted--the bolide\npassed overhead. It was an amazing spectacle. It left a trail of flame\nbehind, across thirty degrees of sky. It went on and on....\n\nLess than ten minutes later the short-wave radio informed the island\nthat the shooting star had been seen to fall in the sea. It had been\nobserved by a plane which was then circling over the area in which the\n_Esperance_ had encountered the circle of shining sea. The plane was\nthere to see if the phenomenon would occur again. It didn't.\n\nBut the plane saw the bolide as it struck the sea, and huge masses of\nsteam and spray arose. The bolide was not white-hot, then, as when it\npassed over Thrawn Island. It was barely of dull-red brightness. It hit\nthe sea and sank, leaving steam behind.\n\nThe water was forty-five hundred fathoms deep at that point.\n\n\n\n\n_Six_\n\n\nFourteen hours later the _Esperance_ made ready to sail from Thrawn\nIsland. Her purpose was to carry the plastic objects to Manila, where\nthey would be turned over to specialized laboratories to be studied.\nFive such objects had been found before: one in the Thrawn Island\nlagoon, while the satellite-tracking station was under construction, and\nfour attached to exotic fish brought to market by the commercial fishing\nboat _La Rubia_. Now there were eight more, of four different kinds. To\nthe laboratories would go Terry's observation that one kind of these\nobjects absorbed sound at audible frequencies and retransmitted it at\nmuch higher ones, but only under water. All this was very interesting\nand very puzzling.\n\nBut a serious disturbance had arisen at the tracking station.\n\nDr. Morton came to the _Esperance_ before her departure. He had a\nproblem. He'd predicted to the minute, and almost to the mile, the\nlanding of the bolide of the night before. That was the first accurate\nprediction of the kind in history. But his forecast stood alone in its\nprecision. Nobody else had even come near being right. Now he was being\ninsistently queried by astronomers the world over. They wanted to know\nhow he'd done it. In particular, they wanted to know how he'd figured\nthat the bolide would lose just so many feet per second velocity,\nneither more nor less, in a three-quarter orbit around the world. Nobody\nelse had such a figure in his equation for the landing spot. Dr. Morton\nhad. His prediction had been exact. Where did he get that necessary but\ninexplicable figure?\n\nHe beckoned Davis and Terry to go below with him, in the _Esperance's_\nafter cabin. Terry hesitated.\n\n\"You may as well hear my troubles,\" said Morton vexedly. \"You're largely\nresponsible for them.\"\n\nTerry followed uneasily. He didn't see how Dr. Morton could hold them\nresponsible. He had guarded his own guesses about the _Esperance's_\ndiscoveries against even the slightest expression. He couldn't let\nhimself believe in their correctness, but he was appalled at the\ninadequacy of all other explanations of past events.\n\n\"In sixteen months,\" said Morton annoyedly, down below, \"we've spotted\nsix bolides coming in to land in the Luzon Deep. That's out of all\nreason! Of course, it could be a mathematical series of wildly unlikely\ncoincidences, such as probability says may happen sometimes. Up to last\nnight that seemed to be a possible explanation.\"\n\nDavis nodded. His expression was odd.\n\n\"But now,\" said Morton somehow indignantly, \"that's ruled out! It's\nruled out by last night's bolide, and yesterday's fishing experiment,\nand that business of the shining sea, plus those damned plastic gadgets\nand deep sea fish thriving in shallow water! There's no reasonable\nexplanation for such things, and they're not mere coincidences!\"\n\n\"I'm afraid,\" admitted Davis, \"that they're not.\"\n\n\"The obvious explanation,\" said Morton doggedly, \"I refuse to name or\nconsider. But nevertheless the question is not whether a theory or an\nexplanation is unlikely or not. The question is whether it's true!\"\n\nDavis nodded. Terry had to agree. But the way people are trained in\nmodern times puts a great emphasis on reason, often at the expense of\nfact. Terry felt the customary civilized reluctance to accept a\nstatistically improbable idea.\n\n\"I'm on a spot,\" fumed Morton. \"I calculated that the damned bolide\nwould slow after it went into orbit around the earth. I calculated that\nit would slow exactly so much. Do you want to know how I figured how\nmuch it should slow down? I'll tell you! I calculated exactly how much\nit would have to slow to be able to fall into the Luzon Deep! It did\nslow. It did fall there. But how am I going to explain that to\nWashington?\"\n\nTerry suddenly felt a warm sympathy for Morton. It is bad enough to\ndispute with oneself when something incredible happens. But Dr. Morton\nhad gone out on a limb. He'd been caught psychologically naked telling\nthe truth, and now he was asked to explain it. And he couldn't.\n\n\"This thing has got to come to a head!\" he said angrily. \"Sooner or\nlater they'll find out that I don't calculate where it'll land by its\nbehavior in space but by its landing spot! Davis, you've talked about\nstirring something up. For Heaven's sake, do it! You may save my\nreputation! And you....\"\n\n\"I'll try to think of something,\" said Davis reservedly.\n\n\"I've got to have proof that my suspicions are right or wrong before I'm\nruined. I know what you're planning to do. Do it! Is there anything that\ncan be done here to help?\"\n\nDavis spread out his hands helplessly. But Terry said, \"Yes. Send a boat\nevery so often to listen at the gap in the reef. Put an oar overboard\nand put your ear to the handle. You should hear the underwater hum, if\nit's still there. It was there this morning.\"\n\nMorton looked at him suspiciously.\n\n\"Why check on it? Should it change?\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Terry. \"We've speared most of the deep-sea fish in the\nlagoon. Maybe we've interfered with ... the reports from the plastic\nobjects, telling what was happening up here. There may be a reaction. If\nso, most likely the humming will stop, and after a longer or shorter\ntime begin again. And then, if my guess is right, there'll be more\ndeep-sea creatures in the lagoon.\"\n\n\"Ha,\" said Morton. \"I think you and I have the same kind of delusions!\nAll right. I'll see that that's done. You two do the rest.\"\n\nHe went abovedecks. When Terry got on deck, Dr. Morton's angular figure\nwas already marching along the wharf to the shore.\n\nThere was no ceremony of departure. The _Esperance_ cast off and her\nengine started. She moved toward the lagoon entrance under power only,\nbut her sails were hoisted as she floated on, and Jug Bell was trimming\nthe jib when she cleared the opening to the sea.\n\nThe humming in the water was still audible to the submarine ear, close\nto the land. It occurred to Terry to take a bearing on the source of the\nsound, noting both the compass direction and the vertical angle from\nthe reef. If his vertical-angle reading was accurate, a line from the\nreef to the source of the sound would touch the bottom at twenty-seven\nthousand feet down, between four and five miles away.\n\nThe _Esperance_ sailed on. The humming duly faded away. Terry left the\nrecorder picking up undersea sounds, without recording them. It relayed\nthe underwater sounds to the people on deck. It was in Terry's mind to\nkeep at least half an ear cocked to it, in case the mooing sounds, heard\nand recorded elsewhere, should come again.\n\nThey did not. The _Esperance_ went methodically on her way, headed south\nby east, under sail. A slowly swaying horizon of unbroken sea was all\nabout. There was nothing in the least unusual or mysterious to be seen\nanywhere.\n\nPresently, Terry found himself in conversation with Deirdre, and the\nworld seemed so blatantly normal that their talk dodged all unusual\ntrends. They talked about their childhoods, about things they had done\nand places they had seen.\n\nAt about four in the afternoon Nick bellowed, \"_Thar she blows!_\" in a\nfine attempt at proper whaling ship style, and all the _Esperance's_\ncompany joined to watch a spouting far ahead. The yacht changed course a\nlittle, and presently reached a pod of sperm whales at the surface. The\nhuge dark bodies moved leisurely through the water. Jud displayed great\nerudition on the subject and explained in detail how their spouting\nproved them to be sperm whales. Deirdre pointed out a baby whale close\nbeside a larger one.\n\nThey sailed on, leaving the whales behind. The crew-cuts, inevitably,\nargued about them. They canvassed all the information and misinformation\nthey possessed and came up with a heated discussion about whales, how\nthey can swim down to the enormous depths without suffering from the\nbends on rising again. Then the conversation turned to the food they\neat. Whalers, in the old days, had found snouts of squids and undigested\nsections of squids' tentacles in the stomachs of harpooned sperm whales.\nThere were reports of sections of tentacles four feet thick, implying a\nstartling total size, all of which proved that the whales had been at\nthe bottom of the ocean, where such gigantic squids can be found. These\nwere the reports of reliable whaling skippers. Certainly the scars made\nby the tentacular arms of huge squids, indicating battle, have been\nfound on the skin of sperm whales, and there have been reports of\nbattles on the surface between whales and squids of sizes most\nnaturalists would be unwilling to certify. In such cases it was assumed\nthat the squids had been attacked at the bottom of the sea and had\nfollowed the whale to the surface when it came up in need of air.\nCertainly only an enormous squid would be able to sustain a battle with\na whale.\n\nTerry listened to the discussion. Everybody had his own opinion.\n\n\"You'd never settle the argument, unless you could put a camera and a\nflash gun on a whale and get an instrument-report from it.\"\n\nWhich was not a new idea, of course. But it was curious that the thought\nof sending self-reporting instruments down to the bottom of the sea had\nbeen suggested by his own suspicion that similar instruments had been\nsent up from below. Sounding lines had been lowered with thermometers\nand nets and sampling machines. Core-takers had been dropped to get\nsamplings of abyssal mud. But tethered instrumentation is never more\nthan so useful.\n\nDeirdre said something. Terry realized that she'd repeated it. He'd\nbecome absorbed in the possibilities of instrument-reporting from the\nsurface to the depths and back again.\n\n\"You're not listening,\" protested Deirdre. \"I'm talking about the\nbathyscaphe that ought to be in Manila any day now.\"\n\n\"I'm trying to picture myself going down in a bathyscaphe,\" said Terry\nhastily. \"I don't think I'd like it.\"\n\nA bathyscaphe is a metal sphere with walls and windows of enormous\nthickness, hung from a metal balloon filled with gasoline for flotation.\nIt is lowered to appalling depths with the help of heavy ballast, and is\nequipped with electric motors for independent motion. It carries\npowerful electric reflectors which allow as much as thirty or forty feet\nof visibility. It rises to the surface again when its ballast is\ndumped. There are only three such undersea exploring devices in the\nwhole world.\n\n\"I'm not at all sure you wouldn't like it,\" said Deirdre.\n\nTerry scowled at his own thoughts. There are opinions a man holds firmly\nwithout ever being aware of them, unless they are challenged, and if\nthat happens, he is deeply suspicious of the challenge because it\nsuggests that his opinion needs to be re-examined. Terry had been\ngathering scraps of information here, and unquestionable items there,\nresisting a conclusion all the while.\n\nIt seemed fantastic to think that the plastic objects carried by\ndeep-sea fish out of their natural environment were actually man-made\ninstruments--telemetering apparatus closely comparable to the devices\nused to transmit information from outer space. It was wildly imaginative\nto suppose that they transmitted information from the water surface to\nthe depths of the ocean; that fish had been driven up from the abyss in\norder to report what went on at the surface. Report to whom? It was the\nmost fantastic of fantasies to think that there was curiosity, in the\nLuzon Deep, about the manners and customs of the inhabitants of the\nsurface waters and of those areas not covered by the sea.\n\nBut Terry stopped short. There were limits to the ideas he would allow\nhis brain to think about.\n\nDeirdre walked away, and he assured himself he never thought of anything\nso ridiculous as the conclusions he had just reached. Presently, dinner\nwas served, and Terry painstakingly acted like a perfectly rational\nperson. After dinner Davis, as usual, settled himself down to enjoy a\nprogram of symphonic music from San Francisco, many thousands of miles\naway. And Deirdre vanished from sight again.\n\nLater on Terry found himself alone on the _Esperance's_ deck, except for\nNick at the wheel--a mere dark figure seen only by the light of the\nbinnacle lamp. There was a diffused, faint glow coming from the\nafter-cabin hatch. Up forward, one of the crew-cuts plucked a guitar,\nand Terry could imagine Doug dourly trying to read poetry despite the\nnoise. The sails were black against the sky. The deck was darker than\nthe sea.\n\nTerry's guesses haunted him. He assured himself that he did not\nentertain them even for an instant. They were absurd! A part of his mind\nargued speciously that if they were absurd there was no reason not to\ntest them. If he was afraid to try, it would imply that at least part of\nhim believed them.\n\nHe picked up one of the plastic objects, and moved the recorder close to\nthe lee rail. It still transmitted faithfully, at minimum volume, the\nwashing of the waves as heard from beneath, and occasional small sounds\nfrom living creatures, generally far away in the sea. Heeled over as the\n_Esperance_ was, his hand could reach down into the rushing waters\noverside.\n\nHe came to a resolution. He felt foolish, but by now he was determined\nto try an experiment. Tiny light-blue sparks flashed where the water\nraced past the yacht's planking. When he dipped his hand, water piled up\nagainst his wrist and a streak of brightness trailed away behind.\n\nHe tapped the plastic object against the hull. One tap, two taps, three\ntaps, four taps. Then five, six, seven, eight. He went back to one. One\ntap, two, and three and four. Five and six and seven and eight.\n\nThe recorder gave out the tappings the underwater microphone had picked\nup. It seemed to Terry that the loudspeaker struggled to emit the\nshrillest imaginable sounds in strict synchrony with the tappings.\n\nThen Deirdre's voice came quietly, very near.\n\n\"I don't think,\" she said evenly, \"that that's a fair thing to do.\"\n\nHe'd been bent over the rail in an awkward position. He straightened up,\nguiltily.\n\n\"I know it's nonsense, but I was ... ashamed to admit ...\"\n\n\"To admit,\" Deirdre concluded for him, \"that by tapping numbers with a\nplastic spy-device, you hoped to say to whom it might concern that we've\nfound a communicator, and we know what it is, and we're trying to get in\ntouch with the intelligent creatures who made it.\"\n\nTo hear his own self-denied guesses spoken aloud was appalling. Terry\ninstantly disbelieved them entirely.\n\n\"It's ridiculous, of course,\" he protested. \"It's childish....\"\n\n\"But it could be true,\" said Deirdre. \"And, if true, it could be\ndangerous. Suppose whatever put those plastic gadgets on the fish\ndoesn't want to be communicated with? Suppose it feels that it should\ndefend the secret of its existence by killing those who suspect it? I\nwasn't spying on you,\" she added. \"I heard the tappings down below.\"\n\nThen she was gone. He saw the interruption in the light from the\nafter-cabin hatch as she went below.\n\nHe was suddenly filled with horror at the idea that if his guesses did\nprove to be right, he might have endangered Deirdre. And then he ceased\nto feel foolish. He felt like a criminal instead.\n\nFor a long, long time he listened with desperate intensity to the\nrecorder, lest he hear some reply to his signals.\n\nBut no answer came. The sounds from undersea remained utterly\ncommonplace.\n\nWhen morning arrived he was in a state of desperate gloom. At breakfast\nDeirdre acted as if she considered the incident closed. And, such being\nthe nature of men, Terry felt worse than before.\n\nHe was not wholly at ease again, even when that afternoon the\n_Esperance_ sailed in past Cavite and Corregidor and into Manila Bay. A\nnew ship was at anchor in the harbor. It was a stubby, stocky ship which\nDavis regarded with interest.\n\n\"That's the _Pelorus_,\" he told Terry as the yacht passed within a mile,\non the way to her former anchorage. \"She's the hydrographic ship with\nthe bathyscaphe on board. We'll visit her. I'll get Nick to call her on\nshort-wave.\"\n\nHe went forward, where Nick was making ready to drop the anchor. Davis\ntook over the chore, and Nick went below.\n\n\"Are you going ashore?\" asked Deirdre.\n\nTerry shrugged. \"I've no reason to.\"\n\nShe looked relieved. \"Then you'll stay with the _Esperance_\nuntil--things are settled one way or another? I mean, you're really\nenlisted?\"\n\n\"Until there are no more ways left for me to blunder,\" said Terry\ndistastefully. \"I'm about through the list, though.\"\n\n\"Not at all!\" protested Deirdre. \"Tapping numbers was really a very good\nidea. I was horrible! I scolded because you'd kept it a secret from me.\nI'd have been proud if I'd thought of it first!\"\n\nNick came back and spoke to Davis. Davis came aft.\n\n\"The _Pelorus_ will send a boat as soon as we've anchored,\" he told\nthem. \"They've heard something and want to see the plastic objects.\"\n\n\"I'd like the long end of a bet that they don't believe in them, or us,\"\nTerry said abruptly. \"They're established authorities on the ocean\nbottom. They know a lot. They probably know so much they can't really\nbelieve there's anything more to know than what they're busy finding out\nnow.\"\n\nDavis shook his head. He was confident. The _Esperance_ anchored, almost\nexactly where she'd been when Terry first came on board. Within half an\nhour a boat arrived from the _Pelorus_. Terry repeated his refusal to go\nalong. Deirdre went along with her father.\n\nThey came back a little over an hour later. At first Davis was almost\nspeechless with fury. Then he told Terry, choking on his rage,\n\"According to them, the plastic objects are a hoax. The hum is a school\nof fish. We aren't trained observers. At Thrawn Island they're\nastronomers and they simply don't know anything about biology. And we\nshould realize that it's starkly impossible for intelligence to develop\nwhere the oxygen supply is limited. It's unthinkable that abyssal fish\nshould have their swim bladders punctured so they won't explode from\nrelease of pressure when they come to the surface. Those in the lagoon\naren't abyssal fish, just unfamiliar species!\"\n\n\"Well?\" Terry asked.\n\n\"Oh, they're going to make a bathyscaphe dive!\" said Davis as angrily as\nbefore. \"As a matter of courtesy to somebody--not us. They'll make it\nwhere we found fish packed in a circle. That happens to be the deepest\npart of the Luzon Deep, in any case. They don't object to our sending\nour dredge down first. They will be politely interested if it comes back\nup.\"\n\n\"I,\" announced Deirdre, \"I am so mad I could spit!\"\n\n\"There's no use in our staying here,\" said Davis, seething. \"Our dredge\nshould be ready. We'll go up to Barca and tow it to the point we want to\nsend it down.\"\n\nHe ordered Nick to get ready to lift anchor.\n\n\"One question,\" Terry said finally. \"Did you mention the bolides?\"\n\n\"No!\" snapped Davis. \"Would I want them to think I was crazy?\"\n\nHe stamped away.\n\nThe _Esperance_ put to sea again. She sailed north along the coast. At\ndinner everybody was quiet. It was the only meal, since Terry's joining,\nthat had not been enlivened by an elaborate argument on some subject or\nother. Davis was still in an abominable mood. He knew it, and held\nhimself to silence.\n\nLater, Terry and Deirdre talked together. They refrained tacitly from\nspeaking of marine biology or any reasons for tapping plastic objects\nagainst the _Esperance's_ hull. They discussed only trivia, but somehow\nTerry found any subject absorbing, when he was with Deirdre.\n\nAfter a while she went below, and he stayed abovedecks, smoking. The\nmoon had not yet risen when he turned in.\n\nThey sailed into the small harbor of Barca at ten in the morning. By\ntwelve, local boatmen had towed out an ungainly object some thirty-two\nfeet long. They tethered it to bitts at the _Esperance's_ stern. By one\no'clock they had loaded on her deck a large, folded sack of sailcloth\nand half a dozen specially-cast concrete blocks with eyed iron rods\ncemented in them. At half-past one Deirdre, who had gone ashore in one\nof the yacht's own boats, came back with innumerable supplies she'd\nbought. At two o'clock the _Esperance_ went out to sea again.\n\nThe towed object was a construction around a central wooden spar with an\niron tube at its top end and half a dozen lesser spars linked loosely to\nits bottom. A mass of fishnet was fastened to the smaller spars and\nheavy ropes were holding the spars and the net in place during its tow.\nThere was a hook for attaching the main spar to the concrete sinkers.\n\n\"It opens like an umbrella,\" explained Deirdre. \"We'll hoist it upright\nbarely out of the water, and fasten on the weights. The canvas bag fits\non that iron pipe. When you let it go, it sinks like an umbrella that's\ntightly closed, but when it touches bottom the weights spread it out and\nan explosive charge automatically goes off in that iron tube. It's\nspecial explosive. The gas it makes inflates the canvas bag, which can't\nburn underwater, and that floats the whole thing back up with the ribs\nof the umbrella stretched out and spreading the net between them. It\nshould catch anything it encounters as it rises. As the pressure lowers,\nthe excess gas can escape through a relief-valve. This dredge is\nexperimental. If it works, it can be modified to do lots of things.\"\n\n\"Such as poking at things we don't believe in,\" said Terry drily. \"That\nexplosion ought to stir up anything in its neighborhood. It'll be much\nmore disturbing and audible than a few light taps against the\n_Esperance's_ hull!\"\n\nDeirdre grinned ruefully and did not answer.\n\nThe bulky tow slowed the yacht. She did not reach the position of the\nfish-filled circle until after nightfall, and it was necessary to have\nplenty of light by which to locate the inflated bag when it came to the\nsurface, so nothing could be tried until the following morning. A short\nwhile before daybreak, lights appeared at the horizon. Red and green\nsidelights, and white central lights. It was a steamer. It came closer\nand closer. Presently, it turned and headed upwind and went dead slow,\nbarely keeping steerage. It was the _Pelorus_.\n\nDawn arrived in a golden radiance which thrust aside the night. The\n_Pelorus_ shone brightly in the first rays of the sun. A large object\nwas hoisted out of her hold. Its shape was that of a gravid goldfish,\nwith a smaller sphere hanging beneath it. It went overside, slowly, and\nthere it floated, rolling wildly on the waves. For a very long time\nnothing seemed to happen. Then the water-level of the float sank a\nlittle. It was being filled with gasoline, which is lighter than water\nand practically incompressible.\n\nOn the _Esperance_, the tow had been pulled alongside and the yacht's\npowerful winch hauled it upright. The yacht heeled over from the weight.\nThe crew-cuts fastened the canvas sack in place, and Davis loaded the\nexplosive charge into the iron tube. The crew-cuts cleared the nets.\nThis preliminary operation seemed promising, and it was quite likely\nthat the dredge would operate as it was designed to do.\n\nThe _Pelorus_ whistled impatiently. Nick abandoned his job and went\nbelow to the short-wave set. He returned shortly after.\n\n\"The _Pelorus_ says she'll be ready to send the bathyscaphe down for a\ntest dive in two hours,\" he reported. \"She says she will object if our\ngadget is floating free at the time, on the chance that it might\ninterfere with the bathyscaphe. She asks if you can send our dredge down\nright away and get it over with.\"\n\n\"Tell them yes,\" said Davis. \"In five minutes.\"\n\nHe compressed his lips. The _Esperance's_ device, though clumsy, was\nfundamentally simple. Five minutes later the top of the central spar was\nlevel with the water. \"Cut away,\" said Davis.\n\nDoug slashed the single rope holding the dredge. It sank immediately.\n\nThe recorder gave off the sound of waves. Occasionally, very\noccasionally, a chirping or a grunt could be heard. Twenty minutes.\nThirty.\n\nThere was a \"crump!\" from the loudspeaker which reported underwater\nevents. The sound seemed to come from very far below. Even a small\namount of explosive makes a very considerable concussion when it goes\noff so far down, and the shock travels in all directions instead of\nmerely upward. The recorder picked up that concussion as a deep-bass\nsound.\n\nThe sun shone. The wind increased. Waves marched in serried ranks from\nhere to there.\n\nA long, long time later the inflated canvas bag came up and was floating\non top of the waves. The _Pelorus_ whistled. Nick went below. A few\nminutes later he came up again to report.\n\n\"The _Pelorus_ says not to cast our dredge adrift. They're sending the\nbathyscaphe down unmanned, to test all apparatus before a manned dive.\nThey don't want any debris in the sea.\"\n\n\"Tell them we send them a kiss,\" snapped Davis, \"and they needn't\nworry!\"\n\nThe _Esperance_ approached the floating bag. Jug swung out on the\nlifting boom and hooked it. The winch hauled it out of the water. The\nconcrete weights were gone. What the nets had captured was not pretty to\nsee. A dead fish with foliated appendages had come up from far below, to\njudge by what its unpunctured swim bladder had done to it in\nuncontrolled expansion. Davis said curtly it was _Linophrine arborifer_,\nbelonging two thousand fathoms below. An angry-looking creature,\nsimilarly dead, was _Opisthoproctus grimaldi_. It belonged deeper than\nthe other. There were other specimens. A _genostoma_ of a species the\nbooks didn't picture; a _Myctophum_; and various other creatures, mostly\nas grotesque as their scientific names. All were abyssal fish. They had\ndied while rising from a pressure of several tons per square inch to\nsurface-pressure only.\n\n\"It worked,\" said Davis curtly. \"I almost wish it hadn't. Let it down\ninto the water again. We'll jettison it when the _Pelorus_ gives us\npermission.\"\n\nTime passed. More time. Still more. The bathyscaphe was now in the\nwater, practically awash. Only a small conning tower showed above the\nwaves. Men swarmed around it.\n\nThere came a query from the _Pelorus_. The _Esperance_ gave assurance\nthat the deep-sea dredge had returned to the surface and would be kept\nthere.\n\nThe bathyscaphe was allowed to sink.\n\nThe recorder on the yacht began to pick up deep-toned mooing sounds from\nthe depths.\n\nPresently, the mooing sounds ceased.\n\nTwo hours later, waves broke over an object completely awash on the\nocean. The _Pelorus_ steamed cautiously toward it. Boats went down from\nher sides and surrounded the float.\n\nAfter a long time the _Pelorus_ got alongside and men quickly fastened\nthe huge buoy to the ship. Then the down-wind sea changed its\nappearance. A reek of gasoline reached the _Esperance_.\n\n\"Something happened,\" said Davis dourly. \"They're dumping the\ngasoline--not even pumping it aboard. Let's get out of the stink.\"\n\nThe _Esperance_ beat to windward. The _Pelorus_ began to lift something\nlarge and ungainly out of the water. The _Esperance_ went down-wind to\ntake a look at it.\n\nThe yacht went past no more than fifty yards away, just as the\nbathyscaphe left the water and swung clear.\n\nThe bathyscaphe's conning-tower was gone. It had been torn away by brute\nforce. The three-inch-thick steel globe.... Half of it was gone. The\nrest was crushed. The sphere, which had been designed to resist a\ncrushing pressure of ten tons per square inch, had been ripped in half!\nIt had been bitten through. Bitten!\n\nThere was no comment by anybody on the _Esperance_.\n\nHalf a mile from the oceanographic ship, Davis said in a peculiarly flat\nvoice, \"Cut away the dredge. We won't try to use it again.\"\n\nSomeone slashed the inflated canvas bag. It collapsed. Somebody cut away\na rope. The free dredge sank, slowly. It would never come up again.\n\nThe _Esperance_ changed course. She headed north by west. There was\nstill no conversation at all. The yacht seemed to tiptoe away from the\nscene of the bathyscaphe's destruction.\n\nA long time later, Deirdre said tentatively, \"Have you been making\nguesses, Terry?\"\n\n\"Guesses, yes,\" he admitted.\n\n\"Such as?\"\n\n\"Your father denied that the dredge was designed to stir up whatever\ngathered the fish together and then carried them down to the bottom of\nthe sea. I was right there with him in the denial, but that's what we\nintended, just the same. We said we didn't believe there was anything\nthere, so it couldn't do any harm to poke it. We poked, all right! Our\ndredge, and then the bathyscaphe....\"\n\n\"But what ...\"\n\n\"And a bolide fell right there a couple of nights ago,\" said Terry\nirrelevantly. \"I wonder what the entity on the ocean-bottom thought of\nthe bolide. Hm.\" He paused. \"I wonder, too, what the bolide thought of\nwhat it found down there. Is that too crazy for a sane man to think,\nDeirdre?\"\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n\"Why is my father working on this business?\" she asked. \"And why are the\nboys helping, and why do radar stations tell us what they find out, and\nwhy did the Philippine Government ask the _Pelorus_ to make a\nbathyscaphe dive at just that spot?\"\n\nTerry blinked at her.\n\n\"Too crazy for official notice, eh?\" he said, \"but too dangerous not to\ncheck up on! Is it absolutely certain that the bolides are bolides?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" said Terry. He pursed his lips as if to whistle. \"I've been\nthinking of this thing as a puzzle. But it isn't. I'm very much afraid\nit's a threat!\" He paused. \"Y-y-es. I've just made a new guess. It adds\neverything together. I do hope it's wrong, Deirdre! I've got cold chills\nrunning up and down my spine!\"\n\n\n\n\n_Seven_\n\n\nAs the _Esperance_ sailed northward, she looked almost unreal. From a\ndistance she might have been an artist's picture of an imaginary yacht\nheeled over in the wind, sailing splendidly over a non-existent ocean.\nThe sky was a speckless blue, the sun was high.\n\nBut she was real enough, and the China Sea around her was genuine, and\nwhat had taken place where the _Pelorus_ lay now hull-down, stowing a\nruined bathyscaphe in her hold, had unquestionably taken place.\n\nSomething monstrous and terrible was hidden in the dark abyss below the\nyacht. The ferocity of its attack on the bathyscaphe was daunting. And\nferocity has always, somehow, a suggestion of madness about it. But the\nhumming sound in the sea was not the product of madness. It was a\ntechnical achievement. And plastic objects with metal inclusions....\n\nDavis joined Deirdre and Terry. Before Davis could speak she said, \"I\ncan't imagine any guess that will add everything together, Terry.\"\n\nDavis made a jerky gesture.\n\n\"Today's business is beyond all reason,\" he said unhappily, \"and if\nthere ever was an understatement, that's it! If there can be any\nconceivable motive for the plastic objects, which the _Pelorus dismisses\nas hoaxes, the motive is to use them to find out_ something about\nsurface conditions; that is, for surface conditions to be reported back.\nAnd that's not easy to imagine. But try to think of something easier!\nAnd yet, such mindless ferocity as attacked the bathyscaphe ... that\nwouldn't be curious about the surface!\"\n\n\"No-o-o-o,\" agreed Terry. \"It wouldn't. But we'd set off a bomb down\nbelow to stir things up. A couple of hours later the bathyscaphe went\ndown. A stupid and merely ferocious thing of the depths wouldn't\nassociate a bomb that exploded with a bathyscaphe that came down two\nhours later. It took intelligence to make the association of two falling\nobjects with danger.\"\n\nDeirdre beamed suddenly.\n\n\"Of course! That's it! Go on!\"\n\n\"Curiosity implies intelligence,\" said Terry carefully, \"and\nintelligence is a substitute for teeth or claws. We don't assume that\nthe fish that carry the plastic gadgets made them. Why assume that\nwhatever attacked the bathyscaphe did it of its own accord? We believe\nthat something else makes the deep-sea fish come up into the Thrawn\nIsland lagoon, don't we? Or do we?\"\n\n\"We pretend we don't,\" said Deirdre.\n\nDavis nodded reluctantly.\n\n\"Yes, we pretend we don't,\" he agreed. \"But if intelligence is involved,\nI find myself getting frightened! We humans are always terrified of\nstrange types of intelligence, anyhow. If it's intelligence that isn't\nhuman ...\"\n\nNick came up from below.\n\n\"Thrawn Island calling,\" he reported. \"They say the hum at the lagoon\nopening stopped for some forty-odd hours and then started again. They\nask if we're coming. I said we were on the way. They're standing by.\nAnything we should tell them?\"\n\n\"We'll get there some time after sunset,\" said Davis. \"And maybe you\nshould tell them about the _Pelorus_ and the bathyscaphe.\"\n\nNick grinned briefly. \"I did. And the guy on Thrawn Island said 'Hooray'\nand then explained that he said that because he couldn't think of\nanything that fitted the idea of something biting holes in three-inch\nsteel.\" He added, \"I can't think of a proper comment, either.\"\n\n\"We'll get to Thrawn Island after sunset,\" repeated Davis. \"Then we'll\nsee what we find in the lagoon--if anything.\"\n\nNick started back toward the bow. He stopped.\n\n\"Oh, yes! It wasn't a scientific guy talking, just the short-wave\noperator. The science staff is all busy. He said they heard an hour ago\nthat another possible bolide's been spotted by a space-radar back in the\nUS. It was picked up farther out than one's ever been spotted before.\nFive thousand miles high.\"\n\nDavis nodded without comment. Nick went forward and disappeared below.\n\nA school of porpoises appeared astern. They caught up with the\n_Esperance_. They went rocketing past, leaping exuberantly for no reason\nwhatever. They cut across the yacht's bow and zestfully played around\nher two or three times, then went on, toward a faraway horizon. They\nmanaged somehow to give the impression of creatures who have done\nsomething they consider important.\n\n\"It's said,\" said Terry, \"that porpoises have brains as good as men's. I\nwish I could get one or two to talk! They might answer everything! I'm\ngetting obsessed by this infernal business!\"\n\n\"I've been at it for months,\" said Davis. \"In the past week, though,\nwith you on board, I have found out more things I don't understand than\nI believed existed!\"\n\nHe walked away. Deirdre smiled at Terry.\n\n\"My father paid you a tribute,\" she said. \"I think we've been wasting\ntime, you and I. We do a lot of talking to each other, but we haven't\nbeen applying our massive brains to matters of real importance.\"\n\n\"Such as what?\" asked Terry dourly.\n\n\"Foam,\" said Deirdre. \"Big masses of foam seen to be floating on the\nsea. Always over the Luzon Deep. Photographed by a plane less than a\nmonth ago. Reported by fishermen much more often than you'd suspect. At\nleast once a ship sailed into a foam-patch and dropped out of sight,\nexactly as if there were a hole in the sea there. Let's talk about\nthat.\"\n\nThey settled down on the after-cabin roof and began a discussion on the\nfoam-patches, for which there was no hint of an explanation. Then\nDeirdre mentioned that when she was a little girl she'd always been\nfascinated by the sight of her father shaving. The foam--the\nlather--entranced her. And somehow that led to something else, and that\nto something else still. A full hour later they were talking enjoyably\nabout matters of no conceivable relationship to large patches of foam\nseen floating on the ocean's surface where the water was forty-five\nhundred fathoms deep.\n\nDavis came to a halt beside them.\n\n\"Morton's just been talking to me from Thrawn Island,\" he said abruptly.\n\"He's very much upset. It's about that prospective bolide that was\nspotted from Palomar. It's been right there for two hours.\"\n\nTerry waited.\n\n\"Morton,\" said Davis, \"would like us to try to photograph it when it\ncomes in, back where the _Pelorus_ was this morning.\"\n\nTerry stared. Shooting stars are not rare. On an average summer night\nanybody can see at least three in an hour's watch of any one quarter of\nthe sky. Bolides are a rare kind of shooting star. Still, many people\nhave seen one or two in their lifetime. But nobody plans ahead of time\nto observe a bolide, and still less does anybody ever plan in advance to\nwatch a meteorite arrive on the earth's surface, whether on land or sea.\nIt is simply not thinkable.\n\n\"We'll go back and try,\" said Davis. He seemed embarrassed. \"Morton says\nthere's no sense to it at all, and that if we do get photographs they'll\nbe considered fakes. He's really wrought up. But he asked if I thought I\ncould get a plane out from Manila to watch it fall--if it comes. I'm\ngoing to try that too.\" He added, more embarrassed still, \"Of course\nnobody'd pay attention if I explained why the plane should go there.\nI'll have to say that I'm just looking for something else peculiar to\nhappen at that spot. The _Pelorus_ must have already reported that one\npeculiar thing has happened.\"\n\nTerry opened his mouth, and closed it again. Davis went away.\n\n\"You had an idea,\" said Deirdre accusingly. \"What?\"\n\n\"I was thinking of Horta,\" said Terry. \"Police Captain Horta. A very\nhonest man with no scientific knowledge at all. Nobody with a scientific\neducation would pay any attention, but I could get him to tell a few\nothers who know as little as he does, and if the damned thing does turn\nup, there'll be proof it was foretold. If it doesn't arrive--\" Terry\nshrugged, \"I've no scientific reputation to lose.\"\n\n\"Wonderful!\" said Deirdre warmly. \"But you wouldn't have proposed it but\nfor me! I'll put things in motion!\"\n\nShe vanished. Within minutes the _Esperance_ came about in a wide\nsemicircle and headed in the direction from which she had just come.\nDeirdre stayed out of sight for a long while. When she came up it was to\ntell Terry that Nick was calling on the short-wave set. He'd raised the\nflattop in Manila Bay. The flattop had raised the shore. Telephone calls\nwere being made to here and there and everywhere to get Horta to a\nshort-wave station to take a call from Terry.\n\nIt was near sunset when the complicated call was ready and Horta's voice\ncame into a pair of headphones Terry was wearing in the _Esperance's_\nradio room.\n\n\"I need,\" said Terry slowly, \"to have a number of people in Manila know\nnow of something that's going to happen out at sea tonight. They'll be\nneeded to testify that they knew of the prediction before the event. Can\nyou arrange it?\"\n\n\"_Por supuesto_,\" said Horta's voice cheerfully. \"Are we not _amigos_?\nWhat is the prediction and who should know?\"\n\n\"The prediction,\" said Terry doggedly, anticipating disbelief and\nprotest, \"is that at twelve minutes after nine o'clock tonight a large\nmeteorite will fall into the sea where--hmm--where _La Rubia_ catches\nher fish. No, you'd better not locate it that way. I'll give you the\nposition.\"\n\nDavis, standing by, wrote the position in latitude and longitude and\nhanded it to him. He read it into the transmitter.\n\n\"Have you got it?\" he demanded. \"Is it written down?\"\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" said Horta tranquilly. \"I will see that they make a\nmemorandum of the matter. Shall I tell three or four persons, or more? I\nhave news for you also. Jimenez....\"\n\n\"Look here!\" said Terry sharply. \"I want this thing to be past all\ndoubt! Everybody who's ever been worried about _La Rubia_ should know\nabout this! There should be no possible doubt about it! But there should\nbe disbelief, so people who don't believe will try to verify that it\ndidn't happen, so they can crow over the people who thought it would, or\nmight.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Horta. \"You wish you stick out the neck! It is serious! Now\ntell me again!\"\n\n\"At twelve minutes after nine tonight,\" said Terry doggedly, \"A shooting\nstar will fall into the sea at....\" He named the latitude and longitude\nDavis had given him. \"That is where _La Rubia_ catches her fish.\"\n\n\"A shooting star will fall there?\" protested Horta. \"But who knows where\nthey fall?\"\n\n\"You do,\" said Terry. \"This one, anyhow. Now, will you see that a number\nof people know about it?\"\n\n\"It is cr-azy!\" objected Horta. Then he said, \"I will do it.\"\n\nThe short-wave call ended, with Horta too much disturbed to refer again\nto Jimenez.\n\nBy sunset Doug had gotten out the gun-cameras. Doug held an impromptu\nclass on deck, showing the other crew-cuts exactly how to aim the\ncameras and expose the films, and what button to press to change film\nautomatically between shots. He was unhappy because he did not know how\nbright the object to be photographed would be, for his lens-settings. He\nwas even more unhappy because the bolide might travel at practically any\nangular velocity, so he didn't know how to set the shutters. But the\nfocus would be infinity, and if he used the fastest possible film, he\ncould stop most motion with a hundredth second exposure.\n\nInstead of reaching Thrawn Island shortly after sunset, then, the\n_Esperance_ was back above the place where the dredge had been dropped\nand the bathyscaphe wrecked. The _Pelorus_ was gone. The people on board\nthat ship must have been very upset. The bathyscaphe had cost more money\nthan is usually allotted to most scientific researchers, and now it was\nsmashed. How would they justify themselves? They could hardly blame the\n_Esperance_.\n\nThe yacht sailed in a closed pattern over this area of the Luzon Deep.\nDeirdre served dinner on deck. Stars shone down almost instantly after a\nsunset of unusual magnificence, even for the China Sea. Tony brought his\nguitar aft, and a contagious feeling of exhilaration spread about the\n_Esperance_ and an improvised party took place on deck. Maybe the mood\nfor festivity arose from the realization that at least nine-tenths of\nthe world's population would have graded them as lunatics, had it known\ntheir project for the evening.\n\nIt would have been unjust, of course. Terry reflected that it had not\nbeen their idea to make an appointment with a shooting star. They were\ndoing it out of some sort of professional courtesy, \"from one set of\ncrackpots to another,\" Terry phrased it in his own mind. It was a wild\nattempt to secure proof of the starkly impossible. So there was chatter,\nsinging, and some dancing. The high spot was perhaps the time when Jug\nbashfully serenaded the rigging and the stars above it with howling\nmelodies he'd learned in college.\n\nEventually, Nick went down to the short-wave set. Doug passed out the\ngun-cameras again, after checking each one. Nick popped his head out of\nthe hatch.\n\n\"Dr. Morton's been calling like crazy,\" he reported. \"The bolide's made\nfour orbital turns, coming in all the while. It ought to touch the\natmosphere next time around. ETO is nine-twelve-seventeen-seconds. I\ntold him we're all set.\"\n\nHis head disappeared.\n\n\"Don't forget!\" Doug said anxiously. \"The cameras will feel like\nshotguns but don't lead your target! And don't forget to press the\nfilm-changer!\"\n\nTerry lifted his gun-camera experimentally. It did feel like a shotgun.\nAnd then, suddenly, he disbelieved everything: the purpose of the\n_Esperance's_ original investigation; the phenomena that had been\nobserved; the guesses that had been made. It was pure insanity! He felt\na quick impatience with himself for becoming entangled in anything so\nridiculous.\n\nDeirdre leaned toward him and whispered forlornly, \"Terry! It's\ndreadful! I've just had an attack of common sense! What are we doing\nhere? We're crazy!\"\n\nHe put his hand consolingly over hers. The act was unpremeditated and\nthe sensation was startling. He found that they were staring at each\nother intently in the starlight.\n\n\"I think ...\" said Terry, unsteadily, \"that it's very sensible to be\ncrazy. We've got to ... talk this over.\"\n\nDeirdre smiled at him shakily.\n\n\"Y-yes, we will.\"\n\nThen Davis pointed out positions for the camera operators. The bolide's\ncourse should be three hundred fifty degrees, not quite on a north-south\nline. It might land short of, or beyond, the _Esperance_. Or it might\npass many miles to the east or west. Dr. Morton needed as many pictures\nof it against recognizable stars as could possibly be secured.\n\nSuddenly, there was a faint, dull rumbling in the heavens. It grew\nlouder. Presently, cruising lights appeared in the sky. They maintained\na fixed relationship to each other. They looked like moving stars,\nflying in formation from star-cluster to star-cluster.\n\nNick popped abovedecks again.\n\n\"The planes just called us,\" he reported. \"They've just had a Loran\nposition-check and they're on the mark. They've got orders to observe\nany unusual phenomena occurring around nine-twelve P.M., Manila time.\nUsing civilian terminology, it sounds like they're saying the Philippine\nGovernment asked them to come out and take a look.\"\n\n\"It's five after nine now,\" said Davis.\n\nThe _Esperance_ headed into the wind. Her bow rose and fell. Waves\nwashed past, and roarings trundled about under the stars overhead, and\nvery tiny lights moved in a compact group across the firmament.\n\nTime passed.\n\nAt twenty-two seconds after nine-twelve--which is to say at twenty-one\nhours, twelve minutes, twenty-two seconds--a light appeared in the sky\nfrom the north. It grew steadily brighter. It suddenly flared very\nbrightly indeed, then dimmed, and continued to rise above the horizon.\nSeconds later it flared again, very briefly.\n\nTerry found himself aiming the gun-camera. He pulled trigger and changed\nfilm and pulled trigger and changed film.\n\nThe bright light ceased to climb. It grew steadily brighter and\nbrighter, and then it flared for the third time--Terry's mind asked\nskeptically, 'Braking rockets?'--and the light was so intense that the\ncracks in the yacht's deck-planking could be seen. Then the extra\nbrilliance vanished, and suddenly the moving light was no longer white,\nbut reddish.\n\nTerry aimed again and fired the gun-camera.\n\nThe light passed almost directly overhead. Terry had the impression that\nhe felt its heat upon his skin.\n\nIt plunged into the sea two miles beyond the _Esperance_. The shock-wave\ncaused by the impact tapped on the yacht's side-planking a few seconds\nlater. Starlight shone upon a plume of steam.\n\nThen there was nothing but the noise of the circling planes above. Then\na sound, as of thunder. It disappeared northward. It was the sound of\nthe bolide's passage, arriving after the object itself had dived into\nthe sea.\n\nThe people on the _Esperance_ were dumfounded. Nick went below and came\nup again a few minutes latter.\n\n\"The planes were calling,\" he reported. \"They say they noted the unusual\nphenomenon. They ask if they should stay around for something else.\"\n\n\"I think,\" said Davis caustically, \"that that's all that's scheduled\njust now. Tell them so.\"\n\nThe _Esperance_ went on steadily again, a trifle west of north. Davis\nwas below, talking via radio to Dr. Morton at the satellite tracking\nbase.\n\nTerry and Deirdre went to look for a place where they could talk over\nsomething privately. It was of enormous importance to them, but it was\nnot connected with fish or meteorites or plastic objects or anything at\nall but the two of them. And to them the yacht seemed crowded with\npeople, even though there was nobody else abovedecks but one of the\ncrew-cuts at the wheel.\n\nWhen the _Esperance_ entered the lagoon the next morning, though, their\nprivate talk had evidently come to a satisfactory conclusion. Deirdre\nsmiled at Terry without any reason whatever, and he looked at once smug\nand embarrassed and uneasy, as if he possessed a new status to which he\nwas still unaccustomed.\n\nThe recorder, trailing a submarine ear overboard, had duly reported the\npresence of the hum in the water, just outside the lagoon. It had not\nbeen operating for forty hours or thereabouts. During that time the fish\ninside could go out of the lagoon, if they chose. And other fish could\ncome in. Terry said suddenly, as the yacht went under power toward the\ntracking station wharf, \"Suppose there was a cone of noise just outside\nthe lagoon, and the flanks of the submarine mountain under us were\nincluded in the cone? And suppose the cone grew smaller, like the other\none. What would happen?\"\n\nDeirdre shook her head, smiling at him.\n\n\"The fish,\" said Terry, \"could escape into the lagoon.\"\n\n\"Probably,\" agreed Deirdre.\n\n\"And if fish could be driven downward along a certain path,\" said Terry,\n\"the way we saw it happen, why, fish could be driven up in a certain\npath, too.\"\n\n\"Obviously,\" said Deirdre.\n\n\"So if something wanted to replace the fish in the lagoon, or to add to\ntheir number, why, it would puncture their swim bladders far, far down,\nand then drive them up to the surface and into the lagoon, and then keep\nthe noise going to keep them inside.\"\n\n\"Is this a new idea?\" asked Deirdre.\n\n\"N-n-o,\" admitted Terry. \"I've had it for some time.\"\n\n\"So,\" said Deirdre, \"have I.\"\n\nThe _Esperance's_ engine stopped, and she floated to gentle contact with\nthe wharf. Members of the tracking station staff made the yacht fast.\nWith others, Dr. Morton came on board. His expression was the picture of\nunrelieved gloom.\n\n\"I'm in a nice spot!\" he told Davis. \"I predicted a second bolide\ncorrectly! I had to use a different retardation factor to make the math\ncome out right. Now I'm asked to explain that! How can I tell them I\nknew where it would fall, and only had to compute when?\"\n\n\"Come below and look at the pictures we got,\" said Davis.\n\nThey disappeared down the after-cabin hatch. Terry knew about the\npictures. Doug had developed them with sweating care, developing each\nnegative separately and adjusting the development-time to the varying\nexposures of the bright object.\n\nThere was a total of twenty reasonably good pictures of the bolide, from\nits first appearance to its plunge into the ocean, two miles from the\n_Esperance_. Doug had enlarged some of them. There were distinct\nstar-patterns in most. In nearly all, though, the object was more or\nless blurred by its own motion. In those taken when it flared most\nbrightly, the blurriness was especially marked. There was only one\npicture of professional, if accidental, quality, and it was the least\nconvincing of all. It showed the fore-part of a conical shape traveling\npoint-first. Nobody would conceivably believe that it was a meteorite.\nIt looked artificial.\n\nTerry and Deirdre, as it happened, stayed on deck. The people of the\ntracking station made a babbling uproar. It appeared that the most\nimportant event in history, as history was viewed on Thrawn Island, had\ntaken place the night before. It was revealed--Terry had not suspected\nhis own success--that in asking Horta to see that there was\nforeknowledge of a meteoric fall, Terry had arranged for the matter to\nbe taken immediately to high Philippine Government officials. The\nAmerican flattop, at their request, had sent planes to the place of the\nfall, with orders which were enigmatic only until the descending object\nappeared. Then every man in every plane knew that he'd been sent there\nto see it.\n\nSo there could be no question but that Dr. Morton had predicted it. That\nmeant that he knew more about meteoric objects than anybody else in the\nworld. What he had to say was of vast importance, and Thrawn Island\nshared in his achievement. But it was a strictly professional triumph.\nThe news would not break in the newspapers. No ordinary reader would\nbelieve in it. And nobody anywhere would believe in Morton's knowledge\nof the place of the fall before he began to calculate.\n\nTerry observed that the people of Thrawn Island were definitely no\nlonger interested in fish. They'd kept their eyes open for oddities\nbecause a deep-sea fish with a plastic object attached had been caught\nin the lagoon a long while before. They'd been intensely interested when\nTerry herded all the lagoon fish into one small inner bay, and they\nspeared sixty fish that had no business being at the surface. They'd\nfound eight more plastic objects. Such things had been interesting, if\nnot important. But now the head of the Thrawn Island staff had computed\nthe place and time of arrival of a meteoric mass from space! And he did\nit when that mass was five thousand miles out! From a professional\nstandpoint, this was stupendous! They tried to make Terry see how\nimportant it was.\n\nDavis and Morton came up from below. They headed for the shore. The\ncrew-cuts trailed off to the land with most of the visitors. Only\nDeirdre and Terry remained on the yacht, with a mere short-wave operator\nfrom the island.\n\n\"We're going to have a fancy lunch, with champagne and speeches,\" the\noperator said hopefully. \"You'll come?\"\n\n\"Naturally!\" said Terry. \"But first we're going swimming. We haven't had\na chance to be overboard since the last time we were here.\"\n\n\"We'll be back in time for lunch,\" Deirdre assured the operator, \"but\nswimming here is so wonderful! We've been talking about it for days!\"\n\nShe went below to change. The operator shrugged. After a further attempt\nto interest Terry in the celebration of an astronomical first, he went\nashore. Terry went with him to get the outboard motorboat he and Deirdre\nhad used before. He was already wearing swimming trunks.\n\nA little later the small boat putt-putted away from the _Esperance_ upon\nthe glassy-rippled waters of the lagoon.\n\nThere was a very great tranquillity everywhere. The booming roar of the\nsurf came from unseen rollers on the reef outside. Seabirds squawked.\nPalms along the edge of the lagoon waved their fronds very, very gently.\n\n\"How far will you go before we swim?\" asked Deirdre. \"All the lagoon's\nperfect. One place is as good as another.\"\n\nHe cut off the motor.\n\n\"Hmmm. There's a deep place yonder,\" he observed. \"That's where I went\nwith the aqualung and speared the freak fish. Stay away from it.\"\n\nShe jumped over in a clean dive. He joined her in the water. She came\nup, blowing bubbles.\n\n\"All right, Terry. What are your troubles?\"\n\n\"That bolide bothers me,\" he told her. \"It had a specific destination!\nIt was meant to hit the water over the Luzon Deep!\"\n\nShe dived again. This time Terry followed her. The underwater world was\nbeautifully bright, with ripplings making everything seem to shimmer\nbecause of the changing light. When they came up again Deirdre said,\n\"Funny!\"\n\n\"It had a purpose!\" insisted Terry. \"There were others before it, and\nthey had a purpose too! That's not funny!\"\n\n\"I didn't mean that,\" said Deirdre. \"I meant ... just now, under the\nwater.... What's that?\"\n\nThere was a swirling at the surface, some tens of yards away. It was not\nthe curling eddy made by a fish about to break surface. It was too big a\ndisturbance for that. It looked as if something stirred, barely\nsubmerged, but something very large. Terry, staring, thought of a\nporpoise cavorting just below the ripples. Or perhaps a shark. But\nsharks and porpoises are too small to have made this eddying. It\nreappeared.\n\n\"Get in the boat!\" snapped Terry. \"Quick!\"\n\nWhile she climbed in he let himself sink, his eyes open. There was a\nclouding of the water underneath, where the surface-disturbance had\nbeen. It was mud from the bottom which had been stirred up. He could see\nnothing clearly through it, though nearby and around him he could easily\nsee the colorings of coral and fan sponges, and he could see small fish\ndarting here and there.\n\nHe broke surface. Deirdre bent anxiously over the gunwale.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" he said curtly. \"But give me a fish spear.\"\n\n\"You won't....\"\n\n\"I just want to have something in my hand,\" he told her impatiently,\n\"while I look.\"\n\nHe took the spear she handed him, and sank once more. Again something\nmoved in the deeper part of the lagoon. It was a fretful motion, as if a\ncreature or creatures tried to burrow away from the light shining\nthrough the water. Whatever moved, a thick cloud of debris from the\nbottom floated all the way up to the surface.\n\nTerry came up for air.\n\n\"There's something queer there,\" he said shortly. \"I don't know what.\"\n\nHe went under and swam cautiously nearer to the disturbance. He was\nwithin a few feet of the curling cloud of obscurity when something like\na gigantic worm came out of it. Or maybe it was like an elephant's\ntrunk, only no elephant ever had a trunk so huge. It was a dull and\nglistening writhing object. Its end was rounded. The tip of the\nworm-like thing must have been a foot in diameter, and it came out of\nthe mud cloud for four feet, then six, then, fifteen feet. It thickened\nonly slightly in that length. It groped blindly in the brightness.\n\nTerry swam back quickly, and the object reared up and made a groping\nsweep through the clear water. Some peculiar white disks suddenly\nappeared on the underside of the long tentacle. They looked like\nsucker-disks, able to grip anything at all. The monstrous tentacle\nfumbled for Terry, as if guided by the pressure-waves his movements\ngenerated.\n\nTerry froze. Deirdre moved in the boat almost directly overhead.\nSomething clanked in the boat and he heard it. The boat was probably\nrocking, making the pressure-waves that a creature from the abyss would\ndepend upon for guidance where eyes would not serve at all.\n\nThe thick, bulging tentacle reached toward the sound at the surface, now\nignoring Terry, though he was nearer. He was still. The white\nsucker-disks on its under side had several rings of a horny, tooth-like\nsubstance at their rims. The smallest were about four inches wide. The\nfumbling object felt blindly in the water. Deirdre stirred again in the\nboat. The visible portion of the groping monstrosity was already longer\nthan the boat. The whole creature would be enormous! If this groping arm\nrested upon the gunwale of the boat, it could easily swamp it.\n\nIt groped for the boat, coming horribly out of a cloud of mud. It\nreached out. In another instant it would touch....\n\nTerry plunged his fish spear into the worm. It jerked violently. There\nwere enormous thrashings. Other similar white-disked arms thrust into\nview, fumbling somehow angrily for the creature--Terry--which had dared\nto attack it.\n\nHe darted for the surface. Something unspeakably horrible touched him,\nbut it was the smooth and not the suckered side of the groping worm.\nTerry's head was now above water. He grasped the gunwale to pull himself\nin, in a fever of haste. But the thing that had touched him before came\nback. It grazed his leg, for just a second. Where it touched, his flesh\nburned like fire.\n\n\"Start ... motor!\" gasped Terry. \"Get away!\"\n\nSomething touched the stern-board of the boat. Deirdre pulled the\nstarter of the motor.\n\n\"Get in!\" she said tensely. \"Quickly!\"\n\nShe saw him, straining every muscle by pure, agonized instinct against\nthe irresistible force of whatever clung to his skin. The horrible\ntentacle stretched, and part of its length took a new grip. It crawled\nupon him.... Deirdre saw the look on his face.\n\nShe snatched up the second spear and stabbed past him, into the crawling\nbeast. There was a most violent jerking. She stabbed again. She panted.\nShe gasped. She stabbed and stabbed, sobbing with fear and horror. And\nTerry tumbled in over the gunwale, released. As soon as he fell onto the\nfloor-boards he painfully dragged himself toward the motor at the stern.\nSomething bumped the boat underneath. Terry pulled the starter and the\nmotor suddenly roared. But the boat didn't start immediately, and it\njerked once more. The whirling propeller-blades had touched one of the\ngroping tentacles and cut it. Tumult arose.\n\nThe boat surged into motion and Terry, with clenched teeth, sent it into\na crazy, skidding turn to avoid a surface swirl, and then another\nfrantic swerve when something showed momentarily above the surface. The\nboat zig-zagged along. A grisly, writhing object rose above the water,\nflailing, a fish-spear sticking in it. The small, skimming boat dodged\nand twisted at its topmost speed.... It suddenly straightened out and\nalmost flew across the water toward the land.\n\n\n\n\n_Eight_\n\n\nEchoes of the outboard's roaring motor came back from the trunks of palm\ntrees that lined the lagoon's shore as the tiny boat raced across the\nwater. Deirdre was ashen-white. She turned her eyes from the water, and\nthey fell on the round raw places on Terry's leg where the sucker-disks\nhad bruised it horribly. She shuddered. She still had the sensation of\nbeing pursued by the monster. Back where Deirdre's spear had finally\nliberated Terry, startled and convulsive motions continued, followed by\na final gigantic splash. Terry drove the boat on at top speed.\n\nThe monster sank again in the spot where the lagoon was deepest. It had\ncome from depths where there was no light; from an abyss where blackness\nwas absolute. Now, having lost its victim, it returned peevishly to such\ndarkness as it could secure.\n\nTerry said curtly, as the small boat raced for the _Esperance_ and the\nwharf, \"That creature was driven up from the Luzon Deep into the lagoon\nto replace the gadget-carrying fish we speared!\"\n\nDeirdre stammered a little.\n\n\"Your l-leg.... You're bleeding....\"\n\n\"I'm pretty well skinned in a couple of places,\" he said shortly.\n\"That's all.\"\n\n\"Could it be poisonous?\"\n\n\"Poison,\" said Terry, \"is a weapon for the weak. This thing's not weak!\nI'm all right. And I'm lucky!\"\n\n\"I'd have jumped over with my spear, if ...\"\n\n\"Idiot!\" said Terry gently. \"Never think of such a thing! Never! Never!\"\n\n\"I wouldn't want to l-live--\"\n\nA new reverberating quality came into the echoes from the shore. The\npilings of the wharf were nearby, now. They multiplied the sounds they\nreturned. The _Esperance_ loomed up. Terry cut off the motor, the little\nboat drifted to contact, and Deirdre scrambled to the yacht's deck, and\nthen took the bow line and fastened it. This was absurdly commonplace.\nIt was exactly what would have been done on the return from any usual\nride.\n\n\"Go tell the others what we found,\" said Terry. \"I'm going to see if\nthere's more than one of those things around.\"\n\n\"Not ...\"\n\n\"No,\" he assured her. \"I'm only going to use the fish-driving horn.\"\n\nDeirdre looked at him in distress.\n\n\"Be careful! Please!\" She kissed him suddenly, scrambled to the wharf,\nand set off at a run toward the shore. Terry stared hungrily after her.\nThey'd come to a highly personal decision the night before on the\n_Esperance_, but it still seemed unbelievable to him that Deirdre felt\nabout him the way he felt about her.\n\nHe went forward to set up the fish-driving combination. One part of him\nthought vividly of Deirdre. The other faced the consequences that might\nfollow if the bolides were not bolides, and if the plastic gadgets and\nthe nasty-sounding underwater hums were products of an intelligence\nwhich could make bolides change their velocity in space; which made them\nfall in the Luzon Deep in the China Sea and nowhere else.\n\nHe set up the recorder with its loop of fish-driving hum. He put the\nhorn overboard, carefully oriented to spread its sound through all the\nenclosed shallow water of the lagoon. He turned the extra amplifier to\nmaximum output, to increase the effectiveness of the noise, and turned\non the apparatus.\n\nThe glassy look of the lagoon-water vanished immediately. Fish leaped\ncrazily everywhere, from half-inch midgets to lean-flanked predators a\nyard and more in length. There was no square foot in all the shallows\nwhere a creature didn't struggle to escape the sensation of pins and\nneedles all over its body. And these pins and needles pricked deep.\n\nFlying-fish soared crazily, and they were the most fortunate because so\nlong as they flew, the tormenting water-sound did not reach them. But\nmany of them landed on the beach, and even among the palms.\n\nIn the spot where blind and snakelike arms had tried to destroy Terry\nand Deirdre, the lashing and swirling was of a different kind. Something\nthere used enormous strength to offer battle to a noise. The water was\nwhipped to froth. Twice Terry saw those rope-like arms rise above the\nwater and flail it.\n\nThis particular sort of tumult, however, appeared only in one spot. So\nthere was only one such creature in the lagoon.\n\nWhen Davis and the others came down from the tracking station, Terry\nturned off the horn. He was applying soothing ointment to the raw flesh\nof his leg.\n\n\"There's a monstrous creature out there,\" he said evenly when a\nwhite-faced Davis demanded information. \"Heaven knows how big it is, but\nit's something like a huge squid. It may be the kind that sperm whales\nfeed on, down in the depths.\"\n\nOthers from the tracking station arrived, panting.\n\n\"Oh! I'm tired of being conservative!\" added Terry fiercely. \"I'm going\nto say what all of us think! There's something intelligent down at the\nbottom of the sea, five miles down!\"\n\nHe glared challengingly around him.\n\n\"Who doesn't believe that?\" he demanded. \"Well, the reporting gadgets\ndon't report any more. We killed the fish that carried them. So that\nwhatever-it-is down on the sea-bed has very cleverly sent up something\nwe ignorant savages wouldn't dare to meddle with! We would be terrified.\nBut we'll show _it_ what men are like!\"\n\nDr. Morton said gently, \"Perhaps we should notify the _Pelorus_. The\nbiologists on board there....\"\n\n\"No!\" said Terry grimly. \"I have a private quarrel with this monster. It\nmight have killed Deirdre! And Davis already tried to tell those\nbiologists something! Tell them about this, and they'll want proofs they\nwouldn't look at anyhow. We'll handle this ourselves! It's too important\nfor them!\"\n\n\"Much too important,\" said Deirdre firmly. \"The shooting stars aren't\nshooting stars and there's something down in the depths just like Terry\nsays. He's right that we can't consider sharing our world with--beings\nthat come down from the sky, even if they only want our oceans and don't\ncare about the land. He says that we wouldn't get along with creatures\nthat know more than we do, and we would especially resent any space\nships coming uninvited to start colonies on our world while we're not\nadvanced enough to stop them! If that's what they're doing, they have to\nbe fought from the very first instant to the very last moment there's\none of them hiding in our seas! Terry's right!\"\n\n\"I haven't heard him say any of those things, young lady,\" said Morton\ndrily, \"but they're true. And I don't like the idea of a sea monster\nbeing in the lagoon anyhow. Especially one that tries to kill people.\nStill, fighting it....\"\n\n\"There are a couple of bazookas on the _Esperance_,\" said Terry sharply.\nHe looked at Davis. \"If you're willing to risk the yacht, we can drive\nthe beast aground, or at least to shallow water, with the submarine\nhorn. Then the bazookas should be able to destroy it. Will you take the\nrisk?\"\n\n\"Of course you'll use the _Esperance_,\" said Davis. \"Of course!\"\n\n\"Then I'll want,\" said Terry, unconsciously taking command, \"somebody at\nthe engine and somebody at the wheel. I'll run the horn. But, frankly,\nif that monster lays one sucker-arm on the _Esperance_, it may be\ngood-bye. Any volunteers?\"\n\nIn minutes the _Esperance_, her engine rumbling, pulled away from the\ndock. She had on board all her original company except Deirdre--firmly\nleft ashore by her father and Terry--and in addition she carried Dr.\nMorton and the most enthusiastic amateur photographer of the tracking\nstation staff. He was shaky but resolute, and was hanging about with an\nimposing array of cameras, for both still and motion pictures. The\n_Esperance's_ sails were furled and she went into battle under bare\npoles. Davis was busy manufacturing improvised hand grenades for himself\nand Morton.\n\nThe sun was nearly overhead. Terry asked Morton questions about the\nlagoon. They finally chose a minor inlet as the place to which the\ncreature must be driven, if possible. There it could be immobilized by\nthe intolerable sound from the recorder. There it could be destroyed.\n\n\"I wonder,\" said Morton wryly, \"if I can present a dead giant squid as\npart of the explanation for my computed orbits for the last two\nbolides!\"\n\nThe _Esperance_ moved steadily toward the place where Terry had nearly\nbeen killed.\n\nThe enterprise was risky. The _Esperance_ was sixty-five feet long. The\ncreature it was to attack was much larger, and if one of its kind had\ncrushed the bathyscaphe, it had sufficient strength and ferocity to make\na battle cruiser a much more suitable antagonist. But the true folly of\nthe effort was its purpose.\n\nIt all started when a fishing boat--_La Rubia_--went to sea and caught\nremarkable quantities of fish, of which four specimens had had plastic\nartefacts fastened to them. Then Terry began checking on certain noises\nhe heard in the sea which provoked an incomprehensible crowding of\nmillions of fish into a small area, from which they swam down to depths\nwhere they could not survive. Now the killing of this squid was supposed\nto cast a light on the mystery of the nine bolides which had fallen into\na particular part of the ocean.\n\nTerry had the undersea horn turned vertically so that it would transmit\na blade of sound wherever he aimed it, instead of spreading all through\nthe lagoon. He turned it on.\n\nThe water before the _Esperance_ suddenly speckled and splashed from the\nmaddened leaps of fish of every possible size. He turned it off. He\naimed it where the ripples showed the presence of something huge beneath\nthe surface. He turned it on again.\n\nThere were convulsive writhings. A long tentacle emerged briefly and\nthen splashed under again. The writhings continued. Terry adjusted his\naim. Crazy leapings of smaller creatures showed the line of the\nsound-beam, as tracer-bullets show the paths of bullets from a machine\ngun. He cut off the sound for an instant and turned it on again at full\nvolume, pointed where the monster must be. There was explosive tumult\nunderwater. Huge arms flailed above the surface. But once again the\ncreature fled.\n\nThe _Esperance_ followed slowly, now. The monster had reacted to the\nstinging sound-beam as if cowed. But it was a deep-sea creature. It did\nnot know how to move when squeezed into a shallow water which hampered\nits movements. It seemed frightened to discover itself trapped between\nthe lagoon-bottom and the surface. And it was dazzled by the brightness\nto which it had been driven. Left unattacked, even for an instant, it\ntried to burrow away from the light, and again it made a dense cloud of\nmud from the bottom. Then it became quiet, as if hiding.\n\nGrimly, Terry lanced it with the painful noise. The water frothed.\nMonstrous tentacles appeared and disappeared, and once part of the\ncreature's body itself emerged. It was cornered into a minor inlet, and\nthere the water grew more shallow and the monster did not want to go to\nwhere its motions would be even more confined.\n\nIt seemed to flow into the deepest part of the miniature bay. It was as\nif it felt certain of a haven there. When the tormenting noise-beam\nstruck again, the abyssal monster flung itself about crazily. A\nterrible, frustrated rage filled it. Its arms fumbled here and there,\nabove water and below. It hauled itself upright so that a part of its\ntorpedo-shaped body broke through the surface. The monster was mad with\nfury. It plunged toward the _Esperance_, not swimming now, but crawling\nwith all its eight legs in water too shallow to submerge it. Its effort\nwas desperate. It lifted everything from the water, and splashed\neverything down again, all the while crawling toward its enemy.\n\nTerry saw Nick and Jug steady the aim of their bazookas. Davis ran\ntoward the bow with hand grenades. The huge squid came crawling, and\nwith every foot of advance the pain-noise grew more unendurable.\nSuddenly the creature uttered a mooing cry and retreated. The cry was\nlike the mooing noise Terry had picked up from the depths.\n\nIt went aground. It struggled to climb ashore, to do anything to escape\nits tormentors. It foamed and splashed....\n\nDespairing, it turned to face its tormentors. Its body reared almost\nentirely out of the water, now. It sagged flabbily. It reeled as its\narms strained. Its eyes rose above the surface, blinded by the light.\nThey were huge eyes. Squids alone, among the invertebrates, have eyes\nlike those of land beasts. They flamed demoniac hatred. A beak appeared,\nnot unlike a parrot's, but capable of rending steel plates. The beak\nopened and closed with clicking sounds that were singularly horrifying.\nIt snapped at the yacht, which was beyond reach. One of the tentacles\nwrenched violently at something. It gave. The arm rose above the water.\nA thorny mass of branched coral flew through the air and splashed close\nbeside the _Esperance_.\n\n\"Shoot!\" said Terry, somehow sickened. \"Dammit, shoot!\"\n\nNick and Tony aimed closely. The bazookas made their peculiar,\ninadequate sounds. The bazooka-shells, like small rocket-missiles, sped\nthrough the short distance. They struck. Their shaped charges detonated,\nagain with inadequate loudness. They did not explode in a fashion to\ntear the creature to bits. Instead, they sent lancing flames a thousand\ntimes more deadly than bullets into the squid's flesh.\n\nIt fought insanely. It uttered shrill cries. Its arms tore at its own\nwounds, at the water, at the lagoon-bed as if it would rend and shatter\nall the universe in its rage.\n\nThe bazookas fired again and again.\n\nIt was the eighth missile from the bazooka which ended the battle. Then\nthe enormous body went limp. Its horny beak ceased to try to crush all\ncreation. But the long, thick, sucker-disked arms thrashed aimlessly for\na long time. Even when they ceased to throw themselves about, they\nquivered and rippled for a considerable period more. And when it seemed\nthat all life had left the gigantic beast, and the men from the\nsatellite-tracking station stepped on the monstrous body, it suddenly\njerked once more, in a last attempt to murder.\n\nThe squid's body, without the tentacles, was thirty-five feet long. The\nlargest squid, the Atlantic variety, captured before had a mantle no\nlonger than twenty feet. That relatively familiar creature,\n_Architeuthis princeps_, came to a maximum total length of fifty-two\nfeet. Counting the two longest arms of this one, it reached eighty. It\ncould not possibly swim in water less than six yards deep. It did not\nbelong in a coral lagoon, but it was there.\n\nIt was close to sunset when the last tremors of the great mass of flesh\nwere stilled. Terry was in no mood for eating, afterward. He skipped the\nevening meal altogether, and paced up and down the veranda of the dining\nhall, at the satellite-tracking station. Inside, there was a clatter of\ndishes and a humming of voices. Outside, there was a soft, warm, starlit\nnight. The surf boomed on the reef outside the lagoon.\n\nDeirdre came out and walked quickly into Terry's arms. She kissed him\nand then drew back.\n\n\"Darling!\" she said softly. Her voice changed. \"How is your leg? Does it\nstill hurt?\"\n\n\"It's nothing to worry about,\" said Terry. \"I'm worried about something\nelse. Two things, in fact.\"\n\n\"Name one!\" said Deirdre, smiling.\n\n\"I'd like to get married soon,\" said Terry ruefully.\n\n\"To whom?\" she asked, jokingly.\n\n\"But I have to have a business or an income first. I think, though, that\nwith a little hard work I can start up my _especialidades electr\u00f3nicas y\nf\u00edsicas_ again, and if you don't mind skimping a little ...\"\n\n\"I'll adore it,\" said Deirdre enthusiastically. \"What else would I\nwant? What's the other thing you worry about?\"\n\n\"That monster,\" said Terry with some grimness.\n\n\"Pouf!\" said Deirdre. \"You've killed it!\"\n\n\"I don't mean that one,\" said Terry more grimly. \"I mean the one that\nsent it. I wish I knew what it is and what it intends to do!\"\n\n\"You've already found out more than anybody else even dared to guess!\"\nshe protested.\n\n\"But not enough. We've stirred it up. It sent small fish in the lagoon\nhere and elsewhere to report back to it. We can't guess what the fish\nreported, but we know some of it was about human beings. Whatever is\ndown at the bottom of the sea must be interested in men. Remember? It\nmade a patch of foam that swallowed up one ship and all its crew. It's\ninterested in men, all right!\"\n\n\"True, but....\"\n\n\"We dropped the dredge, which implied that we were interested in it. The\nbathyscaphe indicated more interest on our part. To discourage that\ninterest--or perhaps in self-defense--it wrecked the bathyscaphe.\"\n\n\"It, Terry?\" asked Deirdre. \"Or _ellos_, they?\"\n\n\"They,\" he corrected himself coldly. \"We killed the fish that were\nreporting men's doings from here. That was insolence on our part. So the\nhum at the lagoon entrance went off and, after two nights, started\nagain--and then this huge squid was found in the lagoon. It should have\nbeen able to defend itself against us. It was sent up here because it\nwas capable of defending itself! But we've killed it just the same. So\nnow what will come up out of the depths? And what will it do?\"\n\nDeirdre said firmly, \"You'll be ready for it when it comes!\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" said Terry. \"Your father once mentioned an instrument he'd like\nto have to take a relief map of the ocean bottom. Changed around a\nlittle, it might be something we need very badly indeed. The horn we've\ngot is good, but not good enough. I'll talk to the electronics men\nhere.\"\n\nThere was a noise of scraping chairs, inside the dining hall. People\ncame out, talking cheerfully. There was much to talk about on Thrawn\nIsland today. The killing of a giant squid had been preceded by a\nspecific guess that linked it to meteoric falls in the Luzon Deep.\nLogically, the excitement had grown.\n\nTerry found his electronics specialists, and explained to them the type\nof apparatus he was interested in. He asked if it was included in the\nisland's technical stores. He wanted to assemble something capable of\nemitting underwater noises of special quality and unprecedented power.\nThere is not much power involved in sound through the air. A cornet\nplayer manages with much effort to convert four-tenths of a watt of\npower into music. A public-address system for a large area may give out\nfifteen watts of noise. Terry described a device which could use a small\namount of power, serving as a sonar or a depth-finding unit, and then,\nwith the throw of a switch, turn kilowatts into vibrations underneath\nthe sea. If powerful and shrill enough, such vibrations could be lethal.\n\nA technical argument ensued. Terry's demands were toned down to fit the\nequipment at hand. Then three men went with him to the island's\nworkshop. They took off their coats and set to work.\n\nThree hours later someone noticed an unknown vessel making its way into\nthe lagoon. She was stubby and small, and had short thick masts with\nheavy booms tilted up at steep angles. Her Diesel engines boomed\nhollowly, louder than the surf. As she entered the lagoon, a searchlight\nwinked on and flicked here and there. It finally found the wharf where\nthe _Esperance_ was moored.\n\nMen of the tracking station staff went down to the wharf to meet the\nsmall row boat that was now coming ashore.\n\nA short, stout, irate fishing boat skipper waved his arms and shouted\nangrily. What had _los americanos_ done to keep _La Rubia_ from catching\nfish? Why had they changed the arrangement by which the starving wives\nand children of _La Rubia's_ crew were fed? He would protest to the\nPhilippine Government! He would expose the villainy of _los americanos_\nto the world! He demanded that now, instantly, the original state of\naffairs be restored!\n\nA fish leaped out of the water nearby. Where it leaped, and where it\nfell back, bright specks of luminosity appeared. Even the ripples of the\nsplashes glowed faintly as they spread outward. The skipper of _La\nRubia_ stared. And now the people of the island realized that the look\nof the water was not altogether commonplace. Little bluish flames under\nthe surface showed that many fish darted there. There were more fish\nthan usual in the lagoon. Many more. The lagoon had suddenly become a\nfine place to catch fish. Some care would be needed, of course. There\nwere doubtless coral heads in plenty. But still ...\n\nThe skipper of _La Rubia_ abruptly returned to his fury and his\nprotests. _La Rubia_ had gone to the place where she always found fish.\nAlways! There was a humming in the water there, and fish were to be\nfound in quantity. But yesterday the American ship had been there, and\nalso this very yacht! _La Rubia_ stayed out of sight lest the\n_americanos_ learn her fishing secrets. But it was useless. When the two\nAmerican ships were gone, there was no longer a humming in the sea and\nno more fish for the crew of _La Rubia_ to capture for their hungry\nwives and children. And therefore he, Capit\u00e1n Saavedra, demanded that\nthe _americanos_ restore the previous state of affairs.\n\nDavis would have intervened, but the chubby skipper erupted into wilder\nand more theatrical accusations still.\n\nLet them not deny what they had done! Fish were always to be found where\nthere was a humming in the sea that _las orejas de ellos_ heard and\nreported to him. But that humming was not in its former place. It was\nhere! At the entrance of the lagoon! The fish were here, also! _Los\namericanos_ had moved the fish so the crewmen of _La Rubia_ could not\nfeed their wives and children. _Los americanos_ wished to take all the\nfish for themselves! But fish were the property of all men, especially\nfishermen with starving wives and children. So he, Capit\u00e1n Saavedra,\nwould fish in this lagoon, and he defied anyone to stop him.\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Terry. \"_Seguramente!_\" He added in Spanish: \"We'll\nlend you a short-wave contact with Manila to make any complaints you\nplease. I'm sure all the other fishing boats will be glad to hear where\nyou've been catching fish, and where you've found the fish have moved\nto! Calm yourself, Capit\u00e1n, and help yourself to the fish of the lagoon,\nand any time you want to call Manila we'll arrange it!\"\n\nHe moved away. He went back to the electronics shop, while Morton and\nDavis and the others talked encouragingly to Capit\u00e1n Saavedra. Presently\nthey suggested that he accept their hospitality, and the Capit\u00e1n and his\noarsmen went up to the dining hall, where they were served dinner, and a\nmore friendly mood developed. In time the Capit\u00e1n said happily that he\nwould wait till sunrise to lower his nets, because he didn't want to\nrisk losing them on the coral heads. A few drinks later the Capit\u00e1n\nboasted about his own system of fishing, as practised by _La Rubia_. The\nstarving condition of his crew's wives and children ceased to be\nmentioned.\n\nIn the presence of so accomplished a liar, nobody of the tracking\nstation staff mentioned a giant squid hauled partly, but only partly,\nout of the water. They suspected that he would not believe it. They were\nsure that he would top their real feat by an imaginary one. So the four\ncrew-cuts listened politely, and fed him more drinks, and learned much.\n\nIn the workshop the most unlikely device Terry'd described took form. In\neffect, it was an underwater horn which was much more powerful than it\nlooked. Submerged, and with power from a group of amplifiers in\nparallel, it would create a tremendous volume of underwater noise. That\nsound would run through a tube shaped like a gun-barrel. It would travel\nin a straight line, spreading only a little.\n\nThe same projection tube could also send out the tentative\nbeep-beep-beep of sonar gear, or the peculiar noise a depth-finder\nmakes. So the instrument could search out a distance or find a target,\nand then fling at it a beam of humming torment equal to bullets from a\nmachine gun.\n\nIt would have taken Terry, alone, a long time to build. But he had\nthree assistants, two of whom were very competent. By dawn, they had it\nready to be mounted upon the _Esperance_. It was placed hanging from the\nbow, mounted on gimbals, so that it could point in any direction. It was\nfirmly fixed to the yacht's planking.\n\nThere was plenty of activity on _La Rubia_, too, at daybreak. That squat\nand capable fishing boat prepared to harvest the fish in the lagoon. She\ngot her nets over. She essayed to haul them. Some got caught on the\ncoral heads rising from the lagoon's bottom toward the surface. Capit\u00e1n\nSaavedra swore, and untangled them. He tried again. Again coral heads\nbaulked the enterprise. The nets tore.\n\nA helicopter came rattling into view from the south. It grew in size and\nloudness, and presently hovered over the tracking station. Then it made\na wide, deliberate circuit of the lagoon. At the inlet where the squid\nlay almost entirely in the water--but fastened by ropes lest it drift\naway--above that spot, the helicopter hovered for a long time. It must\nhave been taking photographs. Presently, it lowered one man by a line to\nthe ground. Obviously, the man could not endure any delay in getting at\nso desirable a biological specimen. Then the helicopter went droning and\nrattling to the tracking station, and landed with an air of weariness.\n\n_La Rubia_ continued to try to catch fish. They were here in plenty. But\nthe coral heads were everywhere. Nets tore. Ropes parted. Capit\u00e1n\nSaavedra waved his arms and swore.\n\nThe _Esperance_ rumbled and circled away from the wharf, and headed for\nthe lagoon entrance. The singular contrivance built during the night was\nin place at her bow. She passed _La Rubia_, on whose deck men\nfrantically mended nets.\n\nThe _Esperance_ passed between the small capes and the first of the\nocean swells raised her bow and rocked her. She proceeded beyond the\nreef. The bottom of the sea dropped out of sight. Terry switched on the\nsubmarine ear and listened. The humming sound was to be expected here.\n\nIt had stopped. It was present yesterday, and even during the night,\nwhen _La Rubia_ came into the lagoon. But now the sea held no sound\nother than the multitudinous random noises of fish and the washing,\nroaring, booming of the surf.\n\nDeirdre was aboard, of course. She watched Terry's face. He turned to\nthe new instrument, and then dropped his hand.\n\n\"I think,\" he said carefully to Davis, \"that I'd like to make a sort of\nsweep out to sea. It's just possible we'll find the hum farther out.\"\n\nDeirdre said quickly, \"I think I know what you're up to. You want to\nsurvey a large area of the ocean while something comes up. Then you can\ndirect that \"something\" to the lagoon mouth by using your sound device,\nso the ... whatever-it-is has to take refuge in the lagoon. Since we've\nkilled the squid....\"\n\n\"That's it,\" said Terry. \"Something like that happened when we speared\nthe fish. The squid took their place. Now we've killed the squid. Just\npossibly....\"\n\nThey found the humming sound in the water four miles off-shore. They\ntraced it through part of a circle. If something were being driven\nupward, it could not pass through that wall of humming sound.\n\n\"That proves your point,\" Davis said. \"Now what?\"\n\nWithout realizing it, he'd yielded direction of the enterprise to Terry,\nwho had unconsciously assumed it.\n\n\"Let's go back to the island,\" said Terry thoughtfully. \"I've got a\ncrazy idea--really crazy! I want to be where we can duck into shallow\nwater when we try the new projector.\"\n\nThe _Esperance_ swung about and headed back toward the island. The sea\nand the distant island looked comfortingly normal and beautiful in the\nsunshine. Under so blue a sky it did not seem reasonable to worry about\nanything. Events or schemes at the bottom of the sea seemed certainly\nthe last things to be likely to matter to anyone.\n\nTerry had the _Esperance_ almost between the reefs before he tried the\nnew contrivance. If it worked, it should be possible to make a relief\nmap of the ocean bottom with every height and depth on the sea-bed\nplotted with precision.\n\nHe started to operate the new instrument. First he traced the steep\ndescent from the flanks of the submarine mountain whose tip was Thrawn\nIsland. He traced them down to the abyss which was the Luzon Deep. Then\nhe began to trace the ocean bottom at its extreme depth, on what should\nhave been submarine plains at the foot of the submerged mountain. The\ninstrument began to give extraordinary readings. The bottom, in a\ncertain spot, read forty-five hundred fathoms down. But suddenly there\nwas a reading of twenty-five hundred. There was a huge obstruction,\ntwelve thousand feet above the bottom of the sea, more than twenty\nthousand feet below the surface. The instrument scanned the area.\nSomething else was found eighteen hundred fathoms up. These were objects\nof enormous size, floating, or perhaps swimming in the blackness. They\nwere not whales. Whales are air-breathers. They cannot stay too long in\ndeep waters, motionless between the top and the bottom of the sea.\n\nThe instrument picked up more and more such objects. Some were\ntwenty-five hundred fathoms from the bottom, and two thousand from the\nsurface. Some were twenty-two hundred up, and twenty-three hundred down.\nThere were eighteen hundred-fathom readings, and twenty-one, and\ntwenty-four, and nineteen. The readings were of objects bigger than\nwhales. They rose very slowly, and appeared to rest, then rose some\nmore, and rested....\n\nBlank faces turned to Terry. He licked his lips and looked for Deirdre.\nThen he said evenly, \"We go into the lagoon. And if we come out\nagain--if!--we leave Deirdre ashore, unless these readings have been\ncleared up. There are chances I'm not willing to take.\"\n\nThe _Esperance_ headed in. It was not possible for the new instrument to\ntell what the large objects were. They could be monstrous living\ncreatures, perhaps squids, and one could only guess that their errand\nwas to deal with the surface-creatures--men--who speared fish and giant\nsquids and set off explosions in the Luzon Deep.\n\nOr the rising objects could be, say, bolides which had dived into the\nDeep from outer space and were now coming to the surface to make sure\nthat the natives of the earth did not again disturb the depths taken\nover by beings from another planet.\n\n\n\n\n_Nine_\n\n\nThe sun rose high in the sky as the _Esperance_ returned to the wharf.\nDavis went ashore and held lengthy conversations with Manila by\nshort-wave radio. The biologists essayed to investigate the squid. _La\nRubia_ still attempted to catch fish. All efforts seemed to tend toward\nfrustration.\n\nWhen Terry walked over to see his victim at close range, he found the\nbiologists balked by the mere huge size of the squid. There were\nliterally tens of tons of flesh to be handled. Squid have no backbone,\nbut a modified internal shell is important to biologists for study. The\nbiologists wanted it. The gills needed to be examined, and their\nposition under the mantle noted, and their filaments counted. The\nnervous system of the huge creature must have its oddities. But the\nactual preservation of the squid was out of the question. The mere\nhandling of so large an object was an engineering problem.\n\nTerry consulted the frenziedly swearing Capit\u00e1n Saavedra, who was ready\nto weep with sheer rage as he contemplated torn nets, and fish he could\nnot capture. Squids were an article of commerce. Terry took the Capit\u00e1n\nto view this one. His crew would help the biologists get at the\nscientifically important items, and for reward they would have the rest\nof the giant--more than they could load upon _La Rubia_. This would make\ntheir voyage profitable, and the Capit\u00e1n would have the opportunity to\ntell the most stupendous story of his capture and killing of the giant.\nWith the evidence he'd have, people might believe him.\n\nPresently, the crewmen of _La Rubia_ clambered over the monster, huge\nknives at work under the direction of the men from Manila. There was\nbitter dispute with the tracking station cook, who objected to the use\nof his refrigeration space to freeze biological material before it was\nsent to Manila by helicopter.\n\nIn mid-afternoon the _Esperance_ left the lagoon again. The\nsonar-depth-finder probed the depths delicately. The objects in mid-sea,\nit appeared, had been rising steadily. Their previous position had\naveraged twenty-five hundred fathoms deep. They were now less than two\nthousand fathoms down, and there were many of them. Unfortunately, the\n_Esperance_ was not a steady enough platform for the instrument. But a\nfairly accurate calculation was made, and if the unidentified objects\ncontinued their ascent at their present rate, they would surface not\nlong after sunrise. Then what?\n\nIncreasingly urgent queries came by short-wave, asking for Dr. Morton's\nexplanation of how he had computed the landing place and time of the\nlatest bolide. His accuracy was not disputed. But astronomers and\nphysicists wanted to be able to do it themselves. How had he done it?\n\nTerry came upon him sitting gloomily before a cup of coffee in the\ntracking station. Davis was there too.\n\n\"I wish I hadn't done it,\" Morton confided. \"It's one of those things\nthat shouldn't happen. It's bad enough to have a giant squid to account\nfor. They tell me it's a new species, by the way. Never found or even\ndescribed before. One of the _Pelorus_ men tells me it's an immature\nspecimen, too. It's not full-grown! What will a grown-up one be like?\"\n\n\"I have a hunch we'll find out when those submerged giants reach the\nsurface,\" said Davis unhappily.\n\nTerry said, \"The one we killed couldn't get out of the water. I wonder\nif the adult forms can walk over the land!\"\n\nDavis stared. \"Should we send Deirdre to safety on the _Esperance_?\"\n\n\"Safety?\" asked Terry. \"On a boat? When a mass of bubbles from undersea\ncould provoke such a turmoil in the water that no ship could stay\nafloat? That's how one ship disappeared. It might be the _Esperance's_\nturn next. Who knows?\" Then he added, \"There's no limit to the size of a\nswimming creature!\"\n\nA bald-headed member of the tracking station staff walked in. He\ncarried an object of clear plastic. It was a foot and a half long, about\nsix inches in diameter. There was an infinite complexity of metallic\nparts enclosed in the plastic.\n\n\"I caught one of the fishermen making off with this,\" he said in a flat\nvoice. \"It was fastened to one of the squid's shorter arms. The\nfishermen didn't want to give it up. The skipper claimed it as\ntreasure-trove.\"\n\nHe put it down on the table. Davis, Terry and Morton looked at it. Then\nMorton shrugged his shoulders, almost up to his ears.\n\n\"The intelligent being that made it,\" said Davis, \"apparently came down\nfrom the sky in a bolide. That's easier to believe than that a submarine\ncivilization of earthly origin lives down in the depths. But why would\nanybody prefer the bottom of the sea to--anywhere else on earth? Where\nwould such a creature come from?\"\n\nDeirdre walked in and stood by the table, watching Terry's face. The\nbald-headed man said, \"I could believe some pretty strange things, but\nyou can't make me believe that a creature can develop intelligence\nwithout plenty of oxygen. There's not much free oxygen at the bottom of\nthe sea.\"\n\n\"But there's something intelligent down there,\" said Davis doggedly. \"If\nit has to have free oxygen, you've only raised the question of where it\ngets it. Maybe it brings it.\"\n\nDeirdre shook her head. \"Foam,\" she said.\n\nThe four men stared at her. Then Terry said sharply, \"That's it! On the\n_Esperance_ there's a picture of a huge mass of foam on the sea. A ship\ndropped right out of sight right into it. Deirdre found the answer!\nSomething down below needs free oxygen. In quantity. Why not get it from\nthe water? What to do with the hydrogen that is left? Let it loose!\nIt'll come to the surface, make a foam-patch....\"\n\nDr. Morton said with a sort of mirthless geniality, \"I add a stroke of\npure genius! Davis just asked what would be the origin of a creature\nwhich preferred the depths of the sea to any other place on earth.\nWhat's to be found down there that's missing everywhere else? Cold? No.\nMoisture? No. Just two things! Darkness and pressure! At the bottom of\nthe Luzon Deep the pressure is over seven tons to the square inch.\nThere's no light--I repeat, none--below three hundred fathoms. Down at\nthe sea-bottom it's black, black, black! Now, where in the universe\ncould there be creatures capable of riding down here in a bolide, and in\nneed of an environment like that?\"\n\nTerry shook his head. He remembered seeing a book on the solar planets,\nin the after-cabin of the _Esperance_. He hadn't read it. The others on\nthe yacht must have.\n\n\"How about Jupiter?\" asked Deirdre. \"The gravity's four times the\nearth's, and the atmosphere is thousands of miles thick. The pressure at\nthe surface should be tons to the square inch.\"\n\nMorton nodded. With the same false geniality he added, \"And there'll be\nno light. Sunlight will never get through that muggy thick atmosphere!\nSo we consider ourselves to be rational beings and guess that the\nbolides come from Jupiter! But I must admit that the last bolide was\nheaded inward toward the sun, and from the general direction of Jupiter.\nSo-o-o-o, do we warn the world that creatures from Jupiter are\ndescending in space ships and are settling down under water, at a depth\nof forty-five hundred fathoms? Like hell we do!\"\n\nHe got up and walked abruptly away.\n\n\"I ...\" said the bald-headed man, shaking his head incredulously, \"will\nput this gadget away and go back to carve some more squid.\"\n\n\"I'll talk to Manila,\" said Davis drearily. \"Something is coming up from\nbelow. There shouldn't be any ships allowed to come this way until we\nfind out what's happening.\"\n\nDeirdre smiled at Terry, now that they were alone.\n\n\"Have you anything very important to do just now?\"\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"If the things that are coming up are--space ships, we can't fight them.\nIf they're anything else, they can't very well fight us. If we wanted to\nattack something at the bottom of the sea we'd have to fumble at the\njob. We wouldn't know where to begin. So maybe, if a submarine power\nwants to attack at the surface of the sea, it may find it difficult,\ntoo.\"\n\nHe frowned. Deirdre said, \"Let's go look at the sea and think things\nover!\"\n\nShe very formally took his arm and they walked out. Presently, they\nstood on the white coral beach on the outer shore, and talked. Terry's\nmind came back, now and then, to how inadequate his previous guesses\nabout the impending menace had been. It seemed now that the menace must\nbe much worse than he had imagined. But there were many things he wanted\nto say to Deirdre.\n\nAs they talked, they were disturbed. The helicopter, which had left\nbefore noon loaded down with biological material for Manila, was\napproaching again. It landed by the tracking station. Then they were\nalone again.\n\nWhen night fell, they were astonished at how quickly time had passed.\nThey went back to the station. The helicopter was on the ground. The\nbiologists had stopped their work, exhausted but very excited by their\ndiscovery of a new species of squid, of which an immature specimen\nmeasured eighty feet. It had offered extremely interesting phylogenic\nmaterial for the Cephalopoda in general. The photographs they'd taken\nwere invaluable, from a scientific viewpoint.\n\nThe crew of _La Rubia_ had returned to their boat. The _Esperance_ had\nbeen out beyond the reef once more. The unidentified objects were still\nrising. They had risen to less than a thousand fathoms from the surface,\nwell before sundown. At this same rate of rise, they should reach the\nsurface some time after midnight. What would happen after that?\n\n\"What will happen depends,\" said Terry, \"on how accurate their\ninformation about us is. It depends on their instruments, really. I\nsuspect their ideas about us are weird. I find I haven't any ideas about\nthem.\"\n\nAt dinner, Davis said worriedly, \"I talked to Manila. The mine layer\nthat was in the Bay left harbor yesterday. The flattop picked it up by\nradio and they're both going to come on here tomorrow. I had to talk\nabout the foam. They weren't impressed. The squid does impress them, but\nthe foam--no. I hate,\" he said indignantly, \"to try to convince people\nof things I couldn't possibly be convinced of myself!\"\n\nThey talked leisurely. Somebody mentioned _La Rubia_. It had been more\nor less expected that her skipper would turn up for drinks and\nconversation again. But he hadn't. The conversation turned to the\nplastic objects. They might or might not pick up sounds. It was not\nlikely they'd respond to light. Certainly, complete images would be\nmeaningless to creatures who had evolved in blackness and without a\nsense of sight. They might respond to pressure-waves, such as are known\nto be picked up by fish when something struggles in the water, even\nthough man-made instruments have not yet detected them. They might\nfurnish data of a sensory kind that is meaningless to humans, as\npictures would be to Jovians. _If_ there were such things....\n\n\"Why argue only for Jupiter?\" asked Deirdre. \"Venus is supposed to be\nmostly ocean. There could be abyssal life there.\"\n\nThe crew-cuts joined in the argument, but tentatively, because there\nwere many experts present.\n\nMidnight came. The open sea outside the reef showed nothing unusual. The\nwaves glittered palely at their tips. There were little flashings in the\nwater where an occasional surface fish darted. The stars shone. The moon\nwas not yet risen.\n\nTwo o'clock came. The _Esperance_ people were divided. Terry and Davis\nwere too apprehensive to sleep. Deirdre'd gone confidently to the yacht\nto turn in. The crew-cuts slept peacefully, too. Davis said uneasily,\n\"I've got a feeling that the ... objects are at the surface, or very\nclose to it, but that they simply aren't showing themselves. I think\nthey're lying in ambush. The squid that was killed must have had trouble\ngetting into the lagoon. They probably won't try to get the big ones in.\nThey'll wait....\"\n\nTerry shook his head.\n\n\"We killed that little one--save the mark!--and its death was probably\nreported in some fashion. So maybe they'll use the big ones on the\nsurface as bait for another kind of weapon. Foam, for example. We know\nhow a ship simply dropped out of sight, as if into a hole.\"\n\n\"I know!\" said Davis drearily. \"I told the flattop about that. But I\ndon't think they really believe it.\"\n\nAt two-thirty Davis and Terry went down to the yacht. They stood on the\ndeck. They kept watch by mere instinct. There was no activity anywhere.\nFaint noises were coming from _La Rubia_. Maybe her crew was repacking\nthe hastily loaded masses of squid-flesh. The last-quarter moon rose at\nlong last, and shone upon the glassy-rippled water of the lagoon.\nStar-images danced beside its reflection.\n\nA little after three, quite abruptly, the Diesels of _La Rubia_ rumbled\nand boomed. The dark silhouette of the ship headed across the lagoon\ntoward its opening. Terry swore.\n\n\"She lifted her anchor without making a noise,\" he said angrily. \"Her\nskipper wants to get to Manila with his catch before it spoils!\nDamnation! I told him not to leave without warning. Anything could be\nwaiting outside!\"\n\nHe raced for the shore and the outboard motorboat. Davis shouted down\nthe forecastle and pelted after him. Terry had the outboard in the water\nby the time Davis arrived. He jumped in and pulled the starter. The\nmotor caught.\n\nThe outboard went rushing across the water. Its wake was a brilliant\nbluish luminescence.\n\nThe booming of the Diesels grew louder. Capit\u00e1n Saavedra thought he had\nput over a fast one on _los americanos_, who had moved the fish from\nwhere he regularly captured them in vast quantities and gathered them in\na lagoon where his nets tore. They had given him most of a monster\nsquid, true, but they had reserved certain parts for themselves. They\nwere undoubtedly the most valuable parts. So when labor officially\nceased at sundown, _La Rubia's_ skipper only pretended to accept the\nidea. In the last hour his crew had quietly completed loading _La Rubia_\nwith squid. They'd been carefully silent. They'd lifted anchor without\nnoise. Now _La Rubia_ headed for the lagoon entrance, heavy in the water\nbut with precise information about what coral heads needed to be dodged.\nShe had on board a cargo history had no parallel for. Her skipper\nexpected to be rewarded with fame, as well as cash.\n\nWhen the outboard motor rushed toward _La Rubia_, Capit\u00e1n Saavedra\nzestfully gave his engines full throttle. When the racketing, roaring\nmotorboat arrived beside his ship, and Terry shouted to him to stop, he\nchuckled and drove on. In fact, he left _La Rubia's_ pilot-house to wave\ncheerfully at the two men. They frantically ran close and shouted to him\nabove the rat-tat-tatting of their own motor and the rumble of his\nDiesels.\n\n_La Rubia_ reached the lagoon entrance with the smaller boat close at\nher side, and Terry still shouting.\n\nBut Capit\u00e1n Saavedra did not believe. Maybe he did not understand.\nCertainly he did not obey. Ocean swells lifted and tossed the motorboat.\nIt became necessary to slow down, for safety. But _La Rubia_ went\ngrandly on, into the open sea.\n\n\"We can't force him to stop,\" said Davis in a despairing voice. \"He\nwon't. I only hope we're wrong, and he gets through!\"\n\nThe outboard stayed where it was, and swells tossed it haphazardly. _La\nRubia_ switched on her navigation lights. She drove zestfully to the\nsouthward. She sailed on, dwindling in size, as the drone of her Diesels\ndiminished in volume.\n\nLooking back, Terry saw the _Esperance_ approaching from the lagoon,\ndark figures on her deck. Terry shouted, cries answered him, and the\n_Esperance_ came to a stop as the motorboat drew alongside.\n\nTerry and Davis scrambled to her deck while one of the crew-cuts led the\nsmaller boat astern and tethered it.\n\n\"We're safe enough here,\" Terry said bitterly, \"and since you've come,\nwe can stay and watch if anything happens. If only she keeps on\ngoing....\"\n\nBut _La Rubia_ did not. Her lights showed that she had changed course.\nShe changed course again. Her masthead light began to waver from side to\nside. She wallowed in such a way that it was clear she was neither on\ncourse nor in motion any longer.\n\nNobody gave orders, but the _Esperance's_ engine roared. The action from\nthis point on became an automatic and quick response to an emergency.\n\nThe schooner-yacht plunged ahead at top speed. Terry switched on the\nrecorder and the ultrapowerful sound projector. Davis bent over the\nsearchlight. Two of the crew-cuts readied the bazookas.\n\nSuddenly, a flare went off on _La Rubia's_ deck. Her stubby masts and\nspars became startlingly bright. Screams came across the waves, even\nabove the growling of the surf and above the noise of the _Esperance's_\nengine.\n\nThe flare shot through the air. It arched in a high parabola, bright in\nthe sky, and fell into the sea. Another flare was ignited.\n\nThe _Esperance's_ searchlight flicked on. A long pencil of light reached\nacross the waves as she raced on. More screamings were heard. Another\nflare burned. It arched overside. The _Esperance_ plunged on,\nshouldering aside the heavier waves of open water.\n\nA half-mile. A quarter-mile. _La Rubia_ wallowed crazily, and more\nshrieks came from her deck. Then the fishing boat seemed to swing.\nBeyond her, a conical, glistening and utterly horrifying monster\nemerged, a mere few yards from her rail. Enormous eyes glittered in the\nsearchlight rays. A monstrous tentacle with a row of innumerable\nsucker-disks reached over the stern of _La Rubia_.\n\nAnother flare swept from the fishing boat's deck in the direction of the\ngiant squid. It fell upon wetted, shining flesh. The monster jerked, and\n_La Rubia_ was shaken from stem to stern. Hurriedly, Terry pressed the\npower-feed button, and the sound projector was on. Its effect was\ninstantaneous. The monster began to writhe convulsively. It was\ngigantic. It was twice, three times the size of the squid captured in\nthe lagoon. Terry heard his own voice cry out, \"Bazookas! Use 'em! Use\n'em!\"\n\nFlaring rocket missiles sped toward the giant. Davis flung one of the\nhand grenades he'd manufactured. The yacht plunged on toward the\nclutched, half-sunk fishing boat. The hand grenade exploded against the\nmonster's flesh. Simultaneously, the bazooka-missiles hit their target\nand flung living, incandescent flame deep into the creature's body.\nThose flames would melt steel. They bored deeply into the squid, and\nthey were infinitely more damaging than bullets.\n\nThe creature leaped from the water, as chunks of its flesh exploded. It\nwas a mountainous horror risen from the sea. As it leaped, it had\nsquirted the inky substance which is the squid's ultimate weapon of\ndefense. But, unlike small squid, this beast of the depths squirted\nphosphorescent ink.\n\nThe beast splashed back into the sea, and the wave of its descent swept\nover the deck of _La Rubia_. The fishing boat nearly capsized. But the\nmonster had not escaped the anguish of its wounds. It fought the injured\nspots as though an enemy still gnawed there. It was a struggling madness\nin the sea.\n\nThe _Esperance_ swung to approach the half-sunken trawler, and Terry\nkept the searchlight on the turmoil. The beast knew panic. It was\nwounded, and the abyss is not a place where the weak or wounded can long\nsurvive. Its fellows would be coming....\n\nThey did. Something enormous moved swiftly under the sea toward the\nwounded monster. It could be seen by the phosphorescence its motion\ncreated, as it approached the surface. There was a jar, a jolt. Some\npart of it actually touched the _Esperance's_ keel. The huge monster\nmoved ahead, but a trailing tentacle flicked up to what it had touched a\nmoment before.\n\nThe ugly tentacle trailed over the yacht's rail. The rail shattered. The\nforecastle hatch was wiped out. The bowsprit became mere debris which\ndangled foolishly from the standing rigging.\n\nThe _Esperance_ bucked wildly at this fleeting contact. Nick fired a\nbazooka-shell, but it missed. Holding fast, Davis flung a grenade. It\ndetonated uselessly. It was then that Deirdre screamed.\n\nTerry froze for an instant. There had simply been no time for him to\nthink that Deirdre might be aboard. It was inexcusable, but nothing\ncould be done now.\n\nTony had been knocked overside by the shock of the contact with the\ngiant, and was swimming desperately trying to follow the yacht and climb\nback on board. Terry flashed the searchlight about. He found Tony,\nsplashing. The _Esperance_ swung in her own length while Terry kept the\nsearchlight beam focused. More shrieks came from _La Rubia_. Davis threw\na rope and Tony caught it. They hauled him aboard, and the _Esperance_\nturned again to pluck away the trawler's crewmen.\n\nThere were unbelievable splashings off to port. Terry flung the\nlightbeam in that direction. It fell upon unimaginable conflict. The\nmonster that had passed under the yacht now battled the wounded squid.\nThey fought on the surface, horribly. A maze of intertwining tentacles\nglistened in the light, and their revolting bodies appeared now and\nagain as the battered creature fought to protect itself, and the other\nto devour. Other enormous squids came hurrying to the scene. They flung\nthemselves into the gruesome fight, tearing at the dying monster and at\neach other. There were still others on the way....\n\nThe sea resounded with desperate mooing sounds.\n\nThe _Esperance_ bumped against _La Rubia_. Frantic, hysterically\nfrightened men clambered up from the deck of the sinking trawler to the\nyacht. As soon as they were aboard they implored their rescuers to head\nfor land, immediately.\n\n\"Get 'em all off!\" bellowed Terry, in command by simple virtue of having\nclear ideas of what had to be done. \"Get 'em all off!\"\n\nThe stout skipper of _La Rubia_ jumped over the yacht's rail. Without\norders, the yacht's engine bellowed. The _Esperance_ turned toward the\nshore, which now seemed very far away.\n\nSomething splashed to starboard. The sea glowed all around it. Terry\npoured the pain-sound exactly in that direction. The monster went into\nconvulsions. The yacht swerved away to keep its distance. She raced on,\npast the spot where the giant flailed its tentacles insanely about. It\nmooed.\n\nThe _Esperance_ raced at full speed toward the island. About a mile\nahead, the surf roared and foamed on the coral reef almost awash.\n\nBack at the scene of the battle of monsters, there was a sudden break in\nthe conflict. One of the wounded giants broke free. It may have been the\none the _Esperance_ had first attacked; perhaps it was another, which\nmight have been partly devoured while still fighting.\n\nIn any case, one of them broke loose and fled, with the hellish pack\nafter it. It is the instinct of squids, if injured, to try to find some\nsubmarine cavern in which to hide. The monster dived, and the others\npursued it. There was no opening in the reef barrier--not underwater.\nBut there was an opening on the surface. The crippled beast had to find\na refuge, or be torn to bits. It may have been guided by instinct, or\nperhaps the current flowing into or out of the lagoon furnished the\nclue. In any case, the fleeing creature darted crazily into the channel\nused by the _Esperance_ for passage. For a little way, it proceeded\nunderwater. Then it grounded itself. Hopelessly.\n\nAnd the pursuing pack arrived.\n\nThe sight from the _Esperance's_ deck was straight out of the worst\npossible nightmare. Glistening serpentine tentacles writhed and flailed\nthe seas. They tore the swells to froth. The pursuers had flung\nthemselves savagely upon the helpless one. The gap in the reef was\nclosed by the battling giants. They slavered. They gripped. They tore.\nThey rent each other....\n\nTerry saw a tentacle as thick as a barrel which had been haggled half\nthrough and dangled futilely as its stump still tried to fight.\n\nAnd more giants came. Terry shouted, and the _Esperance_ turned. He\ncould see large patches of phosphorescence under the surface. And\nsuddenly, he noticed that a few of them had swerved toward the\n_Esperance_. As they approached the sound-horn stung them. They went\ninto convulsive struggling, as the sound played upon them, and they\npassed the _Esperance_ by.\n\nDavis found Terry beside the sound-weapon's controls watching the sea\nwith desperate intensity.\n\n\"Listen,\" said Davis fiercely, \"we're out at sea and we can't get back\ninto the lagoon! We'd better get away from here!\"\n\n\"Across deep water?\" demanded Terry. \"That dangerous foam can come up\nfrom deep water, but maybe not from shallow water. We've got to stay\nclose to the reef until the flattop comes and bombs these creatures--if\nit will ever come!\"\n\nDavis made a helpless gesture. Terry said crisply, \"Get the 'copter to\nhang over the reef and report on the fighting there. Tell it to report\nto the flattop. They may not believe us, but they may send a plane\nanyway. And if the ships come, they'll have to believe about the foam!\nTell them to listen for it underwater. They've got sonar gear.\"\n\nDavis stumbled away. Presently, the dark figure of Nick lowered himself\nthrough what had been the forecastle hatch. Davis followed him.\n\nDeirdre came over to Terry.\n\n\"Terry ...\"\n\n\"I'm going to beat in the heads,\" said Terry, \"of those idiots who came\nafter your father and me without throwing you on the wharf first!\"\n\n\"They'd have wasted precious time,\" said Deirdre calmly. \"I wouldn't\nhave let them. Do you think I want to be ashore when you ...\"\n\nThere was the faintest of palings of the horizon to the east. Terry said\ngrimly, \"I'm going to try to find a passage through the surf, to get you\nashore. I'm keeping the _Esperance_ in shallow water--inside the\nhundred-fathom line--but I don't trust it. Certainly I don't trust a\nship to make you safer!\"\n\n\"It's going to be daybreak soon,\" she protested. \"Then....\"\n\n\"Then we won't be able to see what goes on underwater,\" he told her.\n\"Those ... creatures down below are smart!\"\n\nThere was a racketing, rumbling roar from the island. A light rose above\nthe tree-tops. Presently a parachute-flare lit up. Then there was\nanother, as if the men in the helicopter did not believe what they saw\nthe first time.\n\n\"Terry,\" said Deirdre shakily, \"I'm ... glad we found each other, no\nmatter what happens....\"\n\nDavis came up from below.\n\n\"The flattop's only a few miles away. They're now proceeding at top\nspeed. The mine layer's following. They'll be here by sunrise.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFar away to the east, some brightness entered into the paling of the\nsky. A drab, colorless light spread over the sea. The ocean was a dark,\nslate blue. Swells flattened abruptly about a quarter-mile away. Terry\naimed the sound-weapon and pressed the button. Something gigantic\nstarted up, and the top of a huge squid's mantle pierced the surface.\nThe giant leaped convulsively, high above the water, save for trailing\ntentacles. It was larger than a whale. It fell back into the sea with a\nloud splash, and moved away quickly.\n\nColor came into the sky. The sun's upper rim appeared. Flecks of gold\nspread upon the sea.\n\nFar, far away at the horizon a dark speck appeared. As the sun climbed\nup over the edge of the world, the speck turned golden. There was a mist\nof smoke above it. A plane took off from the ship. Another plane\nfollowed.\n\nFighter planes flashed toward the island. One of them zoomed sharply,\nlike a bird astonished at something it has seen below. It whirled and\ncame back over that spot. There was the rasping whine of a machine gun.\nSomething like a giant snake reared up and fell back again. And now more\nplanes appeared.\n\nSunrise was suddenly complete. Terry stared out over the sea. And he\ncould not believe his eyes, accustomed as he was to the highly unlikely,\nnow. Giant squids were afloat at the surface. He saw one here, and\nanother there, and another, and another.... They were emerging by tens,\nby scores.\n\n\"They've been sent up,\" said Terry very grimly, \"by an entity that\ndidn't evolve on the earth. They're ... domesticated, in a way. They're\nwatchdogs for whatever arrives in bolides that fall in the Luzon Deep.\nThey are the reason for the shining circle of sea from which thousands\nof tons of living fish were drawn down into the abyss. The\ncreatures--the ... _ellos_ who listen to what fish and fishermen\nsay--they keep these things as domestic animals. And they have to feed\nthem. Those mooings were the ... cries of these things waiting to be\nfed. Try to imagine that, Deirdre! In the blackness of the pit, in the\nabyss at the bottom of the sea....\"\n\nA tentacle broke surface. Terry swung the sound-beam. A mantle reared\nabove the waves. A bazooka-shell hit it. Something huge and stupid and\nmonstrous fought the impalpable thing that hurt it....\n\nDavis approached.\n\n\"These,\" he said absurdly, \"aren't the creatures who made the plastic\nobjects. Maybe we ought to try to open communication with their masters.\nWhy should we fight? If we prove we can defend ourselves....\"\n\n\"I suspect,\" said Terry, \"that all intelligent beings think the same\nway, intelligently. If we landed on another planet, on some part of that\nplanet that the natives didn't use but we could, it wouldn't be sensible\nfor those natives to welcome us! Trade with us, perhaps. But let us\nsettle down, no!\"\n\nThere was a bomb explosion out at sea. A plane had dropped a\nhundred-pound bomb on a monster at the surface. The flattop was now\ndistinct. Golden, almost horizontal sunlight struck upon it. Off to the\nwest a plane dived steeply, something dropped from it, and the plane\nlevelled off. A three-hundred-foot fountain erupted from the surface.\nThen there came absolute proof that intelligence lay behind all this. It\nwas not human intelligence, to be sure. Men are tool-using creatures\nnowadays. They imagine robots for fighting, and nowadays they make them,\nbut many centuries ago men ceased to try to use animals as combatants in\nwar.\n\nThe creatures under the sea had not. They'd send up giant squids to do\nbattle with men, as men once sent elephants against the Macedonian army.\nIt was na\u00efve. But the generals, the tacticians, the strategists of the\nDeep did not remain wedded to the one weapon. Already, they saw that\nbeasts could be fought by men. So their instruments of battle changed.\nDoubtless, orders were given, and five miles under the sea\nsomething--something men could not have duplicated--began the\ntransformation of seawater into gas, in quantities past imagining. Tiny,\ntiny bubbles were produced by some unguessable engine, and rose toward\nthe surface, in a steady stream. At the bottom they were under a\npressure of tons to the square inch. But the pressure lessened as they\nrose, and as they rose they swelled. A bubble which was pinhead-size at\nthe sea-bed grew to be the size of a basketball a half-mile up, and\nwould have been the size of a house a mile up, except that then it\nseparated into smaller ones. They rose and rose and expanded and\nseparated. Five miles up from their origin, at little more than\natmospheric pressure, they made a rising column of insubstantiality. At\nthe surface they became foam. But under the foam there was more foam,\nand under that still more. A ship sailing from normal ocean water into\nsuch airy stuff would drop like a stone into the miles-long cone of\nsemi-nothingness. Nothing solid could float there. Nothing substantial\ncould rest its weight upon such rushing thistledown.\n\nAnd the first of the bubble-weapons appeared at the surface in the form\nof a patch of foam. Its source--and hence the place of its\nappearance--could be moved. It could be shifted under any ship, though\nthere would be a time-interval, always, before the foam at the surface\nwas exactly above the gas-generating engine below. It could be moved to\nanticipate the movements of a ship. But there was always that time-lag.\n\nThe _Esperance_ headed back toward the heap of monsters at the break in\nthe reef. Other giant squids emerged and joined the pack. A plane came\nover and bombed it. The _Esperance_ turned away. The mine layer from\nManila appeared at the horizon. The flattop made a sudden violent turn,\nand more foam appeared upon the water. It curled and writhed and piled\nup to be ten--twenty--thirty yards in height.\n\nThe flattop fired a shell into it. There was a gigantic flash and flame,\nand for an instant there was no foam, but only peculiarly pock-marked\nocean surface, instantly covered by more foam which piled up as before.\n\n\"Gas,\" said Terry grimly. \"Hydrogen. You guessed right, Deirdre!\"\n\nNow the flattop shot off plane after plane, as if they were projectiles.\nThey swung in the air and flew low to drop bombs in the now wabbling,\nmoving, sweeping patch of white stuff. It was a huge discoloration of\nthe ocean surface. It was almost in diameter as the flattop's length.\nNow the carrier dodged it warily.\n\nThere were dull concussions everywhere. Giant squids writhed in\ndeath-agonies. White foam-patches appeared here and there--but somehow\nhaphazardly--as if fumbling for the ships. One patch swept close to _La\nRubia_, and that small derelict seemed to tremble. And then the fishing\nboat touched the very edge of the white stuff, and was engulfed in it.\nShe vanished instantly, as if she had fallen into a hole in the sea.\nWhen the foam-patch passed on, the sea was empty.\n\nThe effect of the foam, actually, was that of a gigantic, slavering,\nblind gullet straining to devour. It moved erratically over the surface.\nTerry called to Deirdre, \"Have Nick tell the flattop that the foam only\ncomes up from deep water. If they can get inside the hundred-fathom\ncurve they're safe! Maybe even five hundred. Maybe more. But the foam\nonly comes up from deep water!\"\n\nThe mine layer came on from the horizon at topmost speed. Apparently,\nthey had received warning from the carrier, because the ship suddenly\nbegan to zig-zag. The carrier itself adopted the unpredictable\nchange-of-course system which had been originally designed to frustrate\nsubmarines lying in wait. Both ships adopted it just in time. A ravening\narea of foam appeared directly before the mine layer's bow just as she\nturned aside. The mine layer dumped a mine. Terry saw it go overboard.\nBut it would have five miles to sink before it hit bottom.\n\nTerry called Davis and jerkily explained that the mines would have to be\narmed when they went overboard--set so that they would explode when they\nhit bottom. He explained that depth-bombs might be useful against\nsquids, but if they went off at a fixed depth they would be harmless\nagainst the enemy which deployed the squids.\n\nThe carrier, in the middle of a ninety-degree zig-zag turn, found her\nbow projecting into a foam-patch. The bow sank deep. The carrier's\npropellers were out of the water as her bow pointed downward. Had the\nfoam stayed still for two seconds, the carrier would have slid into the\ncolumn of gigantic ascending bubbles and plunged to destruction. But the\nfoam swerved sidewise.\n\nThe carrier escaped, and was infinitely cautious after that. She made\nshort, swift, unpredictable dashes this way and that.... Her\nanti-aircraft guns rumbled and rattled at things upon the surface.\nPresently, her depth-finder discovered an underwater extension of the\nisland's mountain-foundation, and the ship took refuge where the water\nwas less than a hundred fathoms deep. There she lay, shooting off planes\nand retrieving them, her guns flashing at whatever targets appeared.\n\nTwice, as it happened, snaky, monstrous arms flung themselves up and\nheaved at the flattop as if the giant squids hoped to overturn even an\naircraft carrier by their weight. But those arms were blasted to\nnothingness. The only damage they did was that a twenty-foot section of\ntentacle--writhing independently on the flight-deck--broke the\nlanding-gear of a returning plane which collided with it.\n\nThe mine layer ploughed across the sea. From time to time she heaved\nsomething overboard. Nothing seemed to happen. But each mine was,\nnevertheless, so adjusted that it could explode any time it touched\nsomething underwater. They did not allow the usual time so that the mine\nlayer could get away. The mine layer had ample time, because the mines\nhad to go slowly spinning down five long miles to the bottom of the\nLuzon Deep.\n\nTwenty mines went down before the first one detonated. The concussion\nwas felt on the _Esperance_, twenty-seven thousand feet up and in\nshallow water. Then another, and another, and another. The mine layer\ncontinued to sow her destructive seed. Far behind her, a monstrous\nspouting of gas and spume rose up hundreds of feet. There was another\nconcussion, and another....\n\nThe _Esperance_ quivered, and Terry said grimly to Deirdre, \"We set off\nfive pounds of explosive down the Deep, and the bathyscaphe returned all\nsmashed. What will the creature do now? I wish we could get some mines\ndown to the bottom there!\"\n\nDavis came up, beaming--but shaking.\n\n\"The carrier's sending some planes down to drop eggs at the spot where\nthe fish were dragged down!\" he said zestfully.\n\nGigantic, terrifying masses of gas leaped skyward where the gases\nreleased by the exploding mines finally reached the surface. The mine\nlayer zig-zagged, and dropped a mine. She zig-zagged again, and dropped\nanother. Presently, she took refuge beside the carrier. The _Esperance_\ndrove over and came to a stop between the two armed vessels. Someone\nshouted down by megaphone from the carrier's deck, \"What happened to\nyou? What hit your bowsprit?\"\n\nTerry shouted back, \"You shot those beasts. We've been wrestling with\n'em!\"\n\nAn enormous eruption of gas.... Then the underwater ear began to emit an\nunprecedented sound. It was a rushing sound, but it was only vaguely\nlike the noise of whatever had come up from the depths last Tuesday\nnight. This was powerful beyond imagining.\n\n\"Something's coming up!\" roared Terry. \"Better alert for a real fight\nnow!\"\n\nDeirdre said with a little gasp, \"The real creatures are coming up!\nTerry! The ... things that come in the bolides....\"\n\nHe said savagely, \"They've been shaken up badly by the concussions\nunderwater. They resented five pounds of explosive! There's been four\nhundred pounds in every mine! If they try to fight after what they've\ntaken down below....\"\n\nThe rushing sound from underwater was a loud, throbbing hum which had no\nrelationship with the humming sound that drove fish. Two spoutings of\ngas from mine-explosions shot up. There were more concussions in the\nwater.\n\nThen something broke surface. It was huge, and looked like a rocket. It\nleaped. No, it dashed upward, toward the sky. It flashed skyward,\naccelerating as it rose. Something else broke the surface and headed for\nthe heavens. This one was globular.\n\nThere were dull concussions coming from far underwater, and more rockets\nbroke surface and shot skyward.\n\nAnti-aircraft guns were fired. Shell-bursts came close, but not close\nenough. Not less than twenty enormous rockets leaped out of the water\nand shot up toward the sky. Some observers claimed there were more than\nthirty. Down to southward, where the bathyscaphe had been crushed, the\nplanes that were dropping mines reported that four other objects broke\nloose from the ocean and fled for empty space at speeds too great to be\nestimated.\n\nTerry looked suddenly astonished.\n\n\"But ... of course!\" he told Deirdre. \"When you need high pressure, of\ncourse you've got a weakness. You can't take concussions! Anything\nunderwater is completely vulnerable to bombs! Whatever was down there\nhas found out that the natives--we aborigines--have a weapon they can't\nface. Primitive stuff. Explosives! Chemical explosives! And creatures\nthat can travel between planets and undoubtedly have atomic power\nand--who knows what else--can't fight back if we drop submarine mines on\nthem!\"\n\nA last object broke surface and hurtled skyward. Behind it, deep, deep\ndown, there was a titanic explosion.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Terry. \"That was a time-bomb! They've gone home for good!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA task force of a private yacht, a fishing boat, a satellite-tracking\nstation, an airplane carrier and a mine layer had driven off an invasion\nof earth. But the public could not be told that the earth had been\ninvaded. The people who had been involved in this secret adventure had\nto be satisfied with the realization that they had saved mankind.\n\nAfter a jubilant dinner Terry and Deirdre sat in the veranda.\n\nDavis came out. He blinked at the night.\n\n\"Deirdre? Terry?\"\n\n\"Here,\" said Terry.\n\nDavis joined them. They had drawn apart a little.\n\n\"Good news by short-wave,\" said Davis. \"Those rockets were picked up by\nradar. They divided into two groups. One headed sunward. The other\nheaded for deep space. My guess is Venus for one group and Jupiter for\nthe other. They couldn't have come from Mars. But they've gone home.\nBoth groups.\"\n\nTerry paused, and then said wryly, \"Two races! Some of the bolides were\nbullet-shaped and some were globular. That figures. But two races\ncapable of space travel and both in our own solar system!\"\n\nDavis grimaced. \"We've been talking about it. Our guess is that the\nVenus race developed in deep water, and therefore at high pressure. And\nanything that developed on the solid surface of Jupiter would also be\naccustomed to extremely high pressure.\"\n\nTerry nodded. He was not exactly absorbed in what Davis had to say. But\nhe said suddenly, \"I make a guess. They didn't want to start a colony\nhere. The sea-bottom here is too cold to be comfortable for the beings\nfrom Venus, and far too hot to suit those from Jupiter. But both needed\nterrific pressure. In order to keep contact with each other, in order to\ndo business, they could have set up a trading post here. To meet and\ntrade. Neither one could take over the earth. When you think of it, we\ncouldn't take over Venus or Jupiter! Maybe that's the answer!\"\n\n\"Eh?\" said Davis.\n\n\"We won't have to fight as planets,\" said Terry, \"when we have\nspace-ships like they do. We couldn't gain anything by fighting. All we\ncan gain by is trade. They'll be pleased. It must have been horribly\ninconvenient to have to set up a trading post here on earth. There were\nalways the natives, you know. Lately, they've noticed that we've been\ngetting restless. We have been. I imagine that now they'll wait for us\nto make space-ships and start up interplanetary trade.\"\n\nDavis said, \"Very true. There's going to be the devil of a mess, though.\nMorton will still have to explain the accuracy of his prediction about\nthe bolides' landings. I suspect he'll be censured for assuming anything\nas unlikely as the truth has turned out to be.\"\n\nTerry did not answer. Deirdre was saying something, and he did not hear\nat all.\n\n\"There are still loose ends,\" added Davis. \"For instance, how do you\nsuppose they controlled those squids down below? What did they use for\neyesight? How the devil would Jovians and Venusians agree on a meeting\nplace in our oceans?\"\n\nTerry answered what Deirdre'd said. She smiled at him. They'd forgotten\nthat Davis was there.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Creatures of the Abyss, by Murray Leinster\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK CREATURES OF THE ABYSS ***\n\n***** This file should be named 42901-8.txt or 42901-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/4/2/9/0/42901/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
