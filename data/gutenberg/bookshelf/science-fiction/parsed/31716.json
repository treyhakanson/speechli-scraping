In this story we at last see\n  such a brat meet Things from Alien Space.\n\n\n\n\njimsy and the monsters\n\nby ... Walt Sheldon\n\n  Hollywood could handle just about anything--until Mildume's\n  machine brought in two real aliens.\n\n\nMr. Maximilian Untz regarded the monsters with a critical eye. Script\ngirls, cameramen, sometimes even stars quailed under Mr. Untz's\ncritical eye--but not these monsters. The first had a globelike head\nand several spidery legs. The second was willowy and long-clawed. The\nthird was covered with hair. The prop department had outdone itself.\n\n\"Get Jimsy,\" said Mr. Untz, snapping his fingers.\n\nA young earnest assistant producer with a crew cut turned and relayed\nthe summons. \"Jimsy--Jimsy LaRoche!\" Down the line of cables and\ncameras it went. _Jimsy_ ... _Jimsy_....\n\nA few moments later, from behind the wall flat where he had been\nplaying canasta with the electricians, emerged Jimsy LaRoche, the\neleven-year-old sensation. He took his time. He wore powder-blue\nslacks and a sports shirt and his golden hair was carefully ringleted.\nHe was frowning. He had been interrupted with a meld of a hundred and\ntwenty.\n\n\"Okay, so what is it now?\" he said, coming up to Mr. Untz.\n\nMr. Untz turned and glared down at the youth. Jimsy returned the\nglare. There was a sort of cold war between Mr. Untz and Master Jimsy\nLaRoche, the sort you could almost hear hotting up. Mr. Untz pointed\nto the monsters. \"Look, Jimsy. Look at them. What do you think?\" He\nwatched the boy's expression carefully.\n\nJimsy said, \"To use one of your own expressions, Max--_pfui_. They\nwouldn't scare a mouse.\" And then Jimsy shrugged and walked away.\n\nMr. Untz turned to his assistant. \"Harold,\" he said in an injured\ntone. \"You saw it. You heard it. You see what I've got to put up\nwith.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said Harold Potter sympathetically. He had mixed feelings\ntoward Mr. Untz. He admired the producer's occasional flashes of\ngenius, he deplored his more frequent flashes of stupidity. On the\nwhole, however, he regarded himself as being on Mr. Untz's side in the\nwar between Mr. Untz and the world and Hollywood. He knew Mr. Untz's\nmain trouble.\n\nSome years ago Maximilian Untz had been brought to Hollywood heralded\nas Vienna's greatest producer of musicals. So far he had been assigned\nto westerns, detectives, documentaries, a fantasy of the future--but\nno musicals. And now it was a psychological thriller. Jimsy played the\nkiller as a boy and there was to be a dream sequence, a nightmare full\nof monsters. Mr. Untz was determined it should be the most terrifying\ndream sequence ever filmed.\n\nOnly up to now he wasn't doing so good.\n\n\"I would give,\" said Mr. Untz to Harold Potter, \"my right eye for\nsome _really_ horrible monsters.\" He gestured at the world in\ngeneral. \"Think of it, Harold. We got atom bombs and B-29's, both\nvitamins and airplanes, and stuff to cure you of everything from\nbroken legs to dropsy. A whole world of modern science--but nobody\ncan make a fake monster. It looks anything but fake and wouldn't scare\nan eleven-year-old boy.\"\n\n\"It's a thought,\" agreed Harold Potter. He had a feeling for things\nscientific; he had taken a B.S. in college but had drifted into\nphotography and thence into movie production. He had a wife and a\nspaniel and a collection of pipes and a house in Santa Monica with a\nworkshop basement.\n\n\"I got to do some thinking,\" Mr. Untz said. \"I believe I will change\nmy clothes and take a shower. Come along to the cottage, Harold.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" said Harold. He never liked to say yes for fear of being\ntagged a yes-man. Anyway, he enjoyed relaxing in the office-cottage\nwhile Mr. Untz showered and changed, which Mr. Untz did some three or\nfour times a day. When he got there Mr. Untz disappeared into the\ndressing-room and Harold picked up a magazine.\n\nThere was a knock on the door.\n\nHarold got up and crossed the soft cream-colored carpet and opened the\ndoor and saw a goat-like person.\n\n\"Yes?\" said Harold.\n\n\"Mildume,\" said the goat-like person. \"Dr. John Mildume. Don't ask a\nlot of questions about how I got in. Had a hard enough time as it was.\nFortunately I have several relatives connected with the studio. That's\nhow I heard of your problem as a matter of fact.\"\n\n\"My problem?\" said Harold.\n\nDr. Mildume pushed right in. He was no more than five feet five but\nhad a normal sized head. It was domelike. Wisps of tarnished white\nhair curled about his ears and crown. He had an out-thrust underjaw\nwith a small white beard on its prow. He was dressed in moderately\nshabby tweeds. He moved across the room in an energetic hopping walk\nand took the place on the sofa Harold had vacated.\n\n\"Now, then, Mr. Untz,\" he said, \"the first thing we must do is come to\nterms.\"\n\n\"Just a minute,\" said Harold. \"I'm Mr. Untz's assistant, Harold\nPotter. Mr. Untz is in the shower. Was he expecting you?\"\n\nDr. Mildume blinked. \"No, not exactly. But he can't afford _not_ to\nsee me. I know all about it.\"\n\n\"All about what?\" asked Harold.\n\n\"The beasts,\" the doctor said.\n\n\"The _which_?\"\n\n\"Beasts, Potter,\" snapped the goat-like man. \"The nightmare monsters.\nGet with it, lad. And what is a dream sequence without them? Ha!\"\n\n\"Uh--yes,\" said Harold a little uncertainly.\n\nMildume's finger shot out. \"You fellows understand that I'm no\ndreamy-eyed impractical scientist. Let's face it--it takes money to\ncarry on experiments like mine. Good old-fashioned money. I'll need at\nleast ten thousand dollars.\"\n\nHarold raised his eyebrows. \"Just what, Dr. Mildume, do you propose to\ngive us for ten thousand dollars?\"\n\n\"Beasts,\" said Mildume. \"_Real_ monsters.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon?\" said Harold. He began to work out strategies in\nhis mind. Maybe he could casually walk over to the phone and pick it\nup quickly and call the studio police. Maybe he could get the jump on\nthis madman before he pulled a knife. The thing to do was to humor him\nmeanwhile....\n\nDr. Mildume said, \"I will not deal with underlings. I demand to see\nMr. Untz himself.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Harold, \"you understand that Mr. Untz is a busy man. It's\nmy job to check propositions people have for him. Suppose you tell me\nabout these beasts of yours.\"\n\nMildume shrugged. \"Doubt if you'll understand it any better than Untz\nwill. But it's no more complicated than television when you boil it\nright down. You're familiar, I take it, with the basic principle of\ntelevision?\"\n\n\"Oh, sure,\" said Harold, brightening. \"Keep things moving. Have a\nmaster of ceremonies who keeps jumping in and out of the act. Give\nsomething away to the audience, if possible, to make them feel ashamed\nnot to tune in.\"\n\n\"No, no, no, no, _no_!\" said Mildume. \"I mean the technical\nprinciples. A photo-electric beam scans the subject, translates light\nand dark into electrical impulses, which eventually alter a cathode\nray played upon a fluorescent screen. Hence, the image. You grasp that\nroughly, I take it?\"\n\n\"Roughly,\" said Harold.\n\n\"Well,\" continued Mildume, \"just as spots of light and dark are the\nbuilding blocks of an image, so sub-atomic particles are the building\nblocks of matter. Once we recognize this the teleportation theory\nbecomes relatively simple. There are engineering difficulties, of\ncourse.\n\n\"We must go back to Faraday's three laws of electrolysis--and\nChadwick's establishment in nineteen thirty-one of the fact that\nradiation is merely the movement of particles of proton mass without\nproton charge. Neutrons, you see. Also that atomic weights are close\nintegers, when hydrogen is one point zero zero eight. Thus I use\nhydrogen as a basis. Simple, isn't it?\"\n\nHarold frowned. \"Wait a minute. What's this you're talking\nabout--_teleportation_? You mean a way of moving matter through space,\njust as television moves an image through space?\"\n\n\"Well, not precisely,\" said Mildume. \"It's more a duplication of\nmatter. My Mildume beam--really another expression of the quanta or\nlight energy absorbed by atoms--scans and analyzes matter. The wave\nvariations are retranslated into form, or formulae, at a distant\npoint--the receiving point.\"\n\nHarold lowered one eyebrow. \"And this really works?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Mildume. \"Oh, it's still crude. It doesn't work all\nthe time. It works only along vast distances. I won't announce it\nuntil I perfect it further. Meanwhile I need more money to carry\non and when, through certain relatives, I heard of Mr. Untz's\nproblem--well, it was simply too much to resist. You see, I've\nmanaged to teleport a couple of frightful monsters from somewhere\nout of space. I was wondering what on earth to do with them.\"\n\n\"Where--where are they?\" asked Harold.\n\n\"In my back yard,\" said Dr. Mildume.\n\nAt that point Mr. Maximilian Untz abruptly reappeared. He smelled of\nlotion and he was now dressed in a relatively conservative gabardine\nof forest green with a lavender shirt and a black knitted tie.\n\n\"Hello,\" he said. He looked at Mildume. \"So who is this?\"\n\n\"He says he has monsters for the dream sequence in his back yard,\"\nexplained Harold. \"_Real_ ones.\"\n\n\"Look,\" said Mr. Untz, \"kindly ask the gentleman to get lost, will\nyou, Harold?\"\n\n\"No, wait,\" Harold said. \"He may have something. He explained some of\nit to me. It sounds almost possible. We can't lose much by taking a\nlook.\"\n\n\"Only a few thousand dollars a minute,\" said Mr. Untz.\n\n\"_Bah--money!_\" said Dr. Mildume. \"Which reminds me--these monsters of\nmine are going to cost you. Let's have that understood, right now.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMr. Untz's eyebrows went up. This kind of talk he understood. He\nreached into the side pocket of the gabardine for his cigarette case.\nHe kept a separate gold case in each suit.\n\n\"_Yeeeeow!_\" said Mr. Untz.\n\nHis hand came out of the pocket with a small green snake in it.\n\n\"Drop it! Stand back!\" said Harold, being cool.\n\n\"Don't worry about it,\" said Dr. Mildume in a calmer voice. He was\nblinking mildly at the snake. \"It's merely an ordinary species of\ngarden snake, sometimes erroneously called garter snake. Curious it\nshould be there.\"\n\nHarold looked at Dr. Mildume sharply. \"This teleportation of yours\nwouldn't have anything to do with it by any chance?\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" snapped Mildume.\n\n\"_I_ know how it got here!\" said Mr. Untz, his jowls trembling. He had\nalready dropped the snake. \"A certain child star whose initials are\nJimsy LaRoche! Last week he gives me a hotfoot. Monday a wet\nseat--soaked newspapers in my chair under one thin dry one. Yesterday\na big frog in my shower. I should take that brat over my knee and\nspank him to his face!\"\n\n\"Mm--ah--of course,\" said Dr. Mildume without much interest in the\ntopic. \"Shall we go to inspect the monsters now?\"\n\nMr. Untz thought it over, only long enough to keep himself within the\ntime limits of a Man of Decision. Then he said, \"Okay, so we'll go\nnow.\"\n\nThey passed Jimsy LaRoche on the way out. He was drinking pineapple\njuice and sitting with his tutor, studying his lines. He smirked as\nMr. Untz passed. Mr. Untz scowled back but didn't say anything. In\nJovian silence he led the way to his car.\n\nIt turned out to be a longer ride than they had expected. Dr. Mildume\nlived in Twenty-nine Palms and, as Mr. Untz explained it, this was too\nshort for an airplane and too long for an automobile. Mr. Untz was\nnot in his best humor when they stopped before Dr. Mildume's stucco\nand tile-roof house.\n\nMildume directed them immediately to a walled-in patio in the rear of\nthe place. A shed-roof covered one side of the patio and under it were\nracks of equipment. Harold recognized banks of relays, power\namplifiers, oscillographs and some other familiar devices. There were\nalso some strange ones.\n\nMildume waved his long fingers at all of it. \"My teleportation set-up\nis entirely too bulky so far for practical use, as you can see.\"\n\n\"Nph,\" said Mr. Untz, eyeing it. During the drive Dr. Mildume and\nHarold had explained more to him about teleportation and the monsters\nand he was more doubtful than ever about the whole thing. \"So let's\nsee the monsters,\" he said now. \"Time is fleeing.\"\n\nMildume went in his hopping step across the patio to a huge tarpaulin\nthat covered something square and bulky. He worried the tarpaulin\naway. Two steel cages stood there.\n\n\"Sacred carp!\" said Mr. Untz.\n\nTwo _somethings_ were in the steel cages.\n\nThey were both iridescent greenish-gray in color, they had globular\nbodies, no discernible heads and eyes on stalks growing from their\nbodies. Three eyes apiece. If they _were_ eyes--anyway, they looked\nlike eyes. Sweeping fibrillae came down to the ground and seemed to\nserve as feet. Great saw-toothed red gashes in the middle of each body\nmight have been mouths.\n\n\"They're--they're _real_. They're _alive_!\" said Harold Potter\nhoarsely. That was the thing about them. They had the elusive quality\nof life about them--and of course they were thus infinitely more\nterrifying than the prop department's fake monsters.\n\n\"They're alive all right,\" said Dr. Mildume chattily. \"Took me quite a\nbit of experimenting to discover what to feed them. They like\nglass--broken glass. They're evidently a silicon rather than a carbon\nform of life.\"\n\n\"This I'll buy,\" said Mr. Untz, still staring.\n\n\"Of course,\" said Mildume. \"I knew you would. They will cost you\nexactly ten thousand dollars per day. Per twenty-four hour period.\"\n\n\"Profiteer--burglar!\" said Mr. Untz, glaring at Mildume.\n\nMildume shrugged.\n\nThere was an abrupt, high-pitched squeak. Harold stared at the\nmonsters. The smaller one was quivering.\n\n\"They do that when they're angry,\" Dr. Mildume said. \"Some sort of\nskin vibration. This smaller one here seems to take the initiative in\nthings. Must be a male. Unless there's female dominance, as in birds\nof prey, wherever these things come from. I've--uh--been unable to\nascertain which is which, if any.\"\n\nMr. Untz frowned suddenly. \"Look--just how dangerous are these\nthings?\"\n\n\"Don't know _exactly_,\" said Dr. Mildume. \"A pigeon got too near the\ncages the other day. They seemed to enjoy it. Although, as I say,\ntheir staple appears to be silicon forms. I carelessly set a Weston\nanalyzer too near them the other day and they had it for lunch.\"\n\n\"If they're too dangerous ...\" began Mr. Untz.\n\n\"What if they are?\" said Mildume. \"You make pictures with wild lions\nand tigers and alligators, don't you? Seems to me you can find a way.\nI don't recommend letting them out of the cage however.\"\n\nMr. Untz nodded and said, \"Well, maybe we can get Etienne Flaubert to\ndo something with them. He's the animal trainer we call on. Anyway\nUntz always figures something out. Only that's why I like musicals\nbetter. There isn't so much to figure out and you can play Victor\nHerbert backwards and get new tunes out of him. So anyway, we'll get a\ntruck and get these monsters to the studio right away.\"\n\nIt was arranged. It was arranged with utmost secrecy too. There were\nother studios, after all, and in spite of their wealth of creative\ntalent it was easier to steal an idea than cook up a new one. Atom\nbomb secrecy descended upon the Crusader Pictures lot and most\nespecially upon Sound Stage Six, where the dream sequence for the\npsychological thriller, \"Jolt!\" was being filmed.\n\nEven Jimsy LaRoche, the star of the picture, was excluded from the big\nbarn-like stage. Mr. Untz prepared to get his first stock shots of the\nbeasts.\n\nThere were gasps and much popping of eyebrows when Dr. Mildume--who\nhad come along as technical adviser--removed the tarpaulins from the\ncages. The cameramen, the grips, the electricians, the sound men--all\nstared unbelievingly. The script girl grabbed Mr. Untz's hand and dug\nher fingernails into it. The makeup stylist clutched the lapels of his\nmauve jacket and fainted.\n\n\"Nothing to be afraid of,\" Mr. Untz said to everybody. He was sort of\nconvincing himself too. \"Dr. Mildume here knows all about the\nmonsters. He's got everything under control. So tell everybody about\nthem, Doctor.\"\n\nMildume nodded, bobbing his short white beard. He thrust his hands\ninto his tweed jacket, looked all around for a moment, then said, \"I\ndon't know exactly where the monsters are from. I had my Q-beam\npointed into space, and I was focussing it, intending to put it on\nMars at the time of proper conjunction. All very complicated. However\nthe beam must have worked prematurely. These monsters began to form in\nthe hydrogen chamber.\"\n\nSeveral of the listeners looked at other listeners with unmistakable\ndoubt. Unruffled, Dr. Mildume went on, \"Now, we can make certain rough\nassumptions from the form and structure of these monsters. You will\nnotice that except for their appendages they are globularly formed.\nAny engineer can tell you that the arch and hemisphere sustain the\ngreatest weight for their mass.\n\n\"We may concede that they come from a planet of very strong gravity.\nTheir skin, for instance, is tough and rigid compared with ours. They\nhave difficulty staying rooted to earth--often a simple multipod\nmovement will send them bouncing to the top of the cage. There is one\nother factor--the smaller of these creatures seems the more\ndominant--suggesting that on their home planet smaller beings are more\nagile and therefore better able to take care of themselves.\"\n\n\"There, you see?\" interrupted Mr. Untz, slipping into a pause. \"That's\nall there is to it. So now let us please get down to business.\"\n\nSo they got down to business. And it was not easy business,\nphotographing these monsters. Keeping the cage wires out of focus\nrequired a critical distance for each lens but whenever a camera came\ntoo near a fibrilla would shoot forward--at the glass, no doubt--and\nscare the wits out of the cameramen.\n\nThe shorter lenses got too much of the surrounding area into the\npicture. The crew tried and tried. One technician muttered darkly that\nthe organization contract didn't cover this sort of thing. Mr. Untz\npleaded and cajoled and heckled and moved about and tried to keep\nthings going. Somehow, anyhow.\n\nEddie Tamoto, the chief cameraman, finally came up to him and said,\n\"It's no use, Max. These cages simply don't allow us to do anything.\nWhy don't we put them in the cages they use for jungle pictures?\nThey're big and camouflaged, and the mesh size is right.\"\n\n\"So maybe we'll have to do that,\" said Mr. Untz.\n\nDr. Mildume dipped his head. \"I don't know. I'd like to see these\nother cages first.\"\n\n\"Look,\" said Mr. Untz. \"Don't worry about it. If they hold lions they\nwill hold your whatever-you-call-thems. I'll get the animal trainer,\nFlaubert, to stand by. He practically talks to animals--except horses,\nwhich is his hard luck.\"\n\nThe jungle cages were duly summoned and so was Etienne Flaubert of the\nGolden West Animal Education Studios on Sunset Boulevard. While they\nwaited Mr. Untz stood aside with Harold Potter. He mopped his brow--he\ngestured at the whole group. \"This,\" he said, \"is the story of my\nlife.\"\n\n\"It is?\" asked Harold.\n\nMr. Untz nodded. \"Me, I am an expert on musicals. Musicals I can do\nwith my left hand. But ever since I am in Hollywood I do everything\n_but_ a musical. And always something gets fouled up. Always there is\ntrouble. You will not believe this, Harold, but I am an unhappy man.\"\n\n\"I believe it,\" said Harold.\n\nMr. Untz looked at him sharply and said, \"You don't have to believe it\nso quickly. You could give me a chance to explain.\"\n\n\"Look,\" said Harold--now being truly interested and forgetting some of\nthe first principles of buttering-up one's boss, \"take the scientific\nattitude. Everything is _relative_.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Untz, \"In Hollywood everything is relatives, believe\nme.\"\n\n\"No, no--I wasn't referring to nepotism,\" said Harold. \"I was thinking\nthat you and many others, of course, prefer musicals. But there are\nvast other groups who prefer westerns, detectives, comedies or what\nhave you. One man's meat is another's poison.\n\n\"But nourishment stays the same in principle. The artistic demands\nstill hold and a good picture is a picture, whatever its field. Now,\nif you, as a producer, can shift to the other fellow's viewpoint--find\nout why the thing that terrifies you amuses him--or vice versa.\"\n\n\"Harold,\" said Mr. Untz, not without suspicion, \"are you an assistant\nproducer or a philosopher?\"\n\n\"Sometimes to be the one,\" sighed Harold, \"you have to be the other.\"\n\nThe big jungle cage arrived presently. While it was being set up\nanother assistant came to Mr. Untz and said, \"Jimsy LaRoche is\noutside, yelling to get in, Mr. Untz.\"\n\nMr. Untz whirled on the assistant and said, \"Tell that overpaid\nbrat--who I personally didn't want in my picture in the first\nplace--tell him in the second place the President of the United States\ncould not get in here this afternoon. No, wait a minute, that wouldn't\nmean anything to him--he makes more money than the President. Just\ntell him no.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said the assistant. He left.\n\nAbout then the animal trainer, Etienne Flaubert, was admitted. He\nwalked right up to Mr. Untz. Flaubert was nearly seven feet tall. He\nhad tremendous shoulders and none of it was coat padding. He had a\nchest one might have gone over Niagara Falls in. He had a huge golden\nbeard. When he spoke it sounded like the bass viol section of the Los\nAngeles Symphony tuning up.\n\nHe said to Mr. Untz, \"Where are these monsters I hear about? I'd like\nto see the monster that isn't just a big kitty, like all the rest. Big\nkitties, that's all they are. You gotta know how to handle them.\"\n\nMr. Untz led Flaubert to the cage and said, \"There.\"\n\nFlaubert gasped. Then he steadied himself. The monsters had been\nmaneuvered into the bigger cage by now--Dr. Mildume had enticed them\nwith broken electric light bulbs and slammed the drop-doors behind\nthem by a remote-control rope. They had finished their meal of glass.\nThey were curled in a corner of the cage now, tentacles wrapped about\neach other, squeaking contentedly.\n\nFlaubert recovered a bit.\n\n\"Kitties, just big kitties,\" he growled.\n\nEddie Tamoto called, \"Hey, Max, we'd like to get 'em in the center of\nthe cage for a shot.\" He was gesturing from the camera boom seat.\n\"Only moving around. You know--looking fierce.\"\n\n\"Can you do it, Flaubert?\" said Mr. Untz, turning to the big trainer.\n\n\"Just big kitties,\" said Flaubert.\n\nHe had brought his own whip and blank cartridge pistol. His assistant\nstood by with a .30-30 rifle. Dr. Mildume opened the door quickly and\nFlaubert slipped into the cage.\n\n\"Okay--get set, everybody!\" yelled Mr. Untz. People scurried. An\nattendant switched on the warning light and rocker arm that warned\npeople outside of the stage not to barge in. \"Quiet!\" yelled Mr. Untz.\n\"Quiet--_quiet_!\" yelled several assistants. The order went down the\nline. Through channels.\n\nAnd there stood Etienne Flaubert, huge and more or less unafraid, in\nthe middle of the cage. The monsters in the corner began slowly to\nuncoil their tentacles from about each other. Their eye-stalks rose\nand began to wave slowly. Their red saw-toothed mouths worked into\npouts, gapes and grins.\n\nThe smaller of the two suddenly shuddered all over. Its angry\nchirping noise shrilled through the sound stage. Its tough skin\nvibrated--blurred. It sprang suddenly to its multipods and charged\nFlaubert.\n\nFlaubert screamed an unholy scream. He threw the chair and the whip\nand the gun at the monster and dove from the exit. Dr. Mildume opened\nthe cage door with his rope and Flaubert went through it--himself a\nblur. The monster, in his wake, slammed into the door and stayed\nthere, trembling, still chirping its rage.\n\n\"Hully gee, what kitties!\" said Flaubert, pale and sweating.\n\nMr. Untz groaned.\n\n\"I got some of it!\" yelled Eddie Tamoto from his camera. \"It was\nterrific! But we need more!\"\n\nThen--simultaneously--there were several loud screams of alarm. Mr.\nUntz looked at the cage again. The smaller monster had found a crack,\nand was moving the cage door and squeezing through.\n\n\"Harold!\" shouted Mr. Untz. \"_Do something!_\"\n\nHarold stepped forward. \"Back everybody,\" he said in his best calm\nvoice. \"Walk--do not run--to the nearest exit.\"\n\nThe second monster was already vibrating across the cage and the\nsmaller one was holding the door open for it. Dr. Mildume had tried to\nmaneuver the control ropes to close the door again, but hadn't been\nable to work them--and now he had left his post.\n\nHarold pointed to the man with the rifle and said, \"Fire!\"\n\nThe rifleman fired.\n\nNothing--nothing at all happened. He fired several times more. The\nmonsters didn't even jerk when the bullets hit them.\n\n\"They're--they're impervious yet!\" cried Mr. Untz.\n\nAfter that it was every man for himself.\n\nMoments later Harold found himself outside of the sound stage and on\nthe studio street, bunched with the others and staring at the thick\nclosed door. Nobody spoke. Everybody just thrummed silently with the\nknowledge that two alien monsters were in there, wreaking heaven knew\nwhat damage....\n\nAnd then, as they stared, the thick door began to open again. \"It\nisn't locked!\" breathed Mr. Untz. \"Nobody remembered to lock it\nagain!\"\n\nA tentacle peeked out of the crack of the door.\n\nEverybody scattered a second time.\n\nHarold never remembered the order in which things happened amidst the\nconfusion that followed. It seemed he and Mr. Untz ran blindly, side\nby side, down the studio street for awhile. It seemed all kinds of\npeople were also running, in all kinds of directions.\n\nBells were ringing--sirens blew--a blue studio police car took a\ncorner on two wheels and barely missed them. Harold had a glimpse of\nuniformed men with drawn pistols.\n\nThey ended up somehow at Mr. Untz's office-cottage. They went inside\nand Mr. Untz locked the door and slammed his back to it. He leaned\nthere, panting. He said, \"Trouble, trouble, trouble. I should have\nstayed in Vienna. And in Vienna I should have stood in bed.\"\n\nThe door of the shower and dressing-room opened and Jimsy LaRoche came\nout. He had a number of snails in his out-stretched hand and he coolly\nkept them there, making no attempt to conceal his obvious purpose in\nthe shower. He looked directly at Mr. Untz with his dark disconcerting\neleven-year-old eyes and said, \"Well, Max, what goof-off did you pull\nthis time?\"\n\n\"_You!_\" roared Mr. Untz, whirling and shooting a finger at the child\nstar. A focusing point for all his troubles, at last. His jowls shook.\n\"You, Jimsy LaRoche,\" he said, \"are going to get your first old\nfashioned spanking on the bottom! From me, personally!\" He advanced\ntoward the boy, who backed away hastily.\n\nJimsy began to look a little frightened.\n\n\"Now wait a minute, Max,\" said Harold, stepping forward. \"We've got\nenough _big_ monsters to think about without worrying about this\n_little_ monster too.\"\n\nMr. Untz stared at Harold queerly. Suddenly he said, \"Why didn't I\nthink of it before?\"\n\n\"Think of what?\" asked Harold.\n\nBut Mr. Untz had already grabbed Jimsy LaRoche's hand and dragged him\nthrough the door.\n\nThere were several reasons why Harold Potter did not immediately\npursue. For one thing he stood there for several moments stupified\nwith surprise. Then, when he did recover, he plunged forward and\npromptly tripped on the cream-colored carpet and fell flat on his\nface. He tripped again going over the step to the cottage door. He\nbumped into a studio policeman rounding the next corner. He snagged\nhis coat on a fence picket going around the corner after that. But he\nkept Mr. Untz and the dragged youngster in sight.\n\nEventually he came to the door of Sound Stage Six.\n\nSpeaking from a police standpoint all laymen had disappeared. A ring\nof studio police and firemen, along with some policemen and detectives\nfrom the outside, had been drawn around the monsters and everybody and\nhis brother was shooting off pistols and rifles at them. With no\nresult, of course. Nor did anyone dare get too close.\n\nHarold caught up with Mr. Untz about the time a man he recognized as a\nreporter did. The reporter was stout, freckled and bespectacled.\n\n\"_Untz!_\" barked the reporter, with all the power of the press in his\nvoice, \"do you realize this is a national danger? If those monsters\ncan't be stopped by bullets, what will stop them? Where will it all\nend? Where did they come from?\"\n\n\"Look in tomorrow's paper!\" growled Mr. Untz, brushing the reporter\naside. He kept Jimsy's arm in a firm grip. Jimsy was bawling at the\ntop of his lungs now. Mr. Untz breasted the police cordon, broke\nthrough.\n\n\"Max! _Stop!_\" shouted Harold. \"Max--have you gone mad?\"\n\nMax evidently had. He moved so swiftly that everyone was too surprised\nto stop him. He burst into the small human-walled arena where the two\nbewildered monsters squatted and he thrust little Jimsy LaRoche out\nbefore him--right at the monsters.\n\nAn extraordinary thing happened. The monsters suddenly began to quiver\nand squeak again but this time--it was clear to the ear somehow--not\nwith rage, but with _fear_. Pure and terrible fear. They trained their\neye-stalks on Jimsy LaRoche, they paled to a lighter shade of brown\nand green, then slowly they began to back away.\n\n\"Hold your fire, men!\" called a police captain, probably just to get\ninto the act.\n\nDr. Mildume appeared again from somewhere. So did Etienne Flaubert. So\ndid Eddie Tamoto and some of the other technicians. They gaped and\nstared.\n\nSlowly, inexorably, using Jimsy LaRoche as his threat, Mr. Untz backed\nthe two monsters into the studio, and gradually to the cage. Dr.\nMildume leaped forward to shut them in once more.\n\nAnd through it all Jimsy LaRoche continued to bawl at the top of his\nlungs.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLater, in Mr. Untz's office-cottage, Harold read the newspaper\naccounts. He read every word while Mr. Untz was in the other room\ntaking a shower. He had to admit that Max had even thrown a little\ncredit his way. \"My assistant, Mr. Potter,\" Untz was quoted as saying,\n\"indirectly gave me the idea when he said that one man's meat was\nanother man's poison.\n\n\"Dr. Mildume had already explained that the monsters came from a\nhigh-gravity planet--that the smaller of the species evidently seemed\nthe more capable, and therefore the dominant one.\" Harold was sure now\nthat the statement had been polished up a bit by the publicity\ndepartment.\n\n\"The only logical assumption, then,\" the statement continued, \"was\nthat small stature would dominate these life forms, rather than large\nstature, as in the environment we know. They were, in other words,\nterrified by tiny Jimsy LaRoche--whose latest picture, 'The Atomic\nFissionist and the Waif,' is now at your local theatre, by the way--as\nan Earth-being might have been terrified by a giant!\"\n\nMr. Untz came out of the shower at that point. He was radiant in a\ncanary-colored rayon sharkskin. He was rubbing his hands. He was\nbeaming.\n\n\"Harold,\" he said, \"they're putting me on a musical next. I got them\ntwined around my little finger. Life is good. I think that screwy Dr.\nMildume was smart to send those things back out into space before they\ncould get to him. Otherwise we might have _had_ to put them in\npictures and with contracts yet.\"\n\n\"Max,\" said Harold, staring at him quietly.\n\n\"Yes, Harold?\"\n\n\"Just answer me one thing truthfully. I swear I'll never repeat it--or\neven blame you. But for my own curiosity I've got to know.\"\n\n\"Why certainly, Harold, what is it?\"\n\nHarold Potter swallowed hard. \"Did you,\" he asked, \"_really_ figure\nout that Jimsy would scare the beasts--or were you about to _throw_\nthe little brat to them?\"\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber Notes\n\nThis etext was produced from Fantastic Universe, January 1954.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\ncopyright on this publication has been renewed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Jimsy and the Monsters, by Walt Sheldon\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK JIMSY AND THE MONSTERS ***\n\n***** This file should be named 31716.txt or 31716.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/1/7/1/31716/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Katherine Ward and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
