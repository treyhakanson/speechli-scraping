E. SMITH\n\n\n    They were four of the greatest minds in the Universe:\n    Two men, two women, lost in an experimental spaceship\n    billions of parsecs from home. And as they mentally\n    charted the Cosmos to find their way back to earth,\n    their own loves and hates were as startling as the worlds\n    they encountered. Here is E. E. Smith's great new novel....\n\n\n    [Illustration:\n\n    The guardian struggled to immobilize the beast's\n    gigantic talons as the frightened girl leaped to the\n    safety of Garlock's arms.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\n\nHer hair was a brilliant green. So was her spectacularly filled halter.\nSo were her tight short-shorts, her lipstick, and the lacquer on her\nfinger-and toe-nails. As she strolled into the Main of the starship,\nfollowed hesitantly by the other girl, she drove a mental probe at the\nblack-haired, powerfully-built man seated at the instrument-banked\nconsole.\n\nBlocked.\n\nThen at the other, slenderer man who was rising to his feet from the\npilot's bucket seat. His guard was partially down; he was telepathing a\npleasant, if somewhat reserved greeting to both newcomers.\n\nShe turned to her companion and spoke aloud. \"So _these_ are the\nsystem's best.\" The emphasis was somewhere between condescension and\nsneer. \"Not much to choose between, I'd say ... 'port me a tenth-piece,\nClee? Heads, I take the tow-head.\"\n\nShe flipped the coin dexterously. \"Heads it is, Lola, so I get\nJim--James James James the Ninth himself. You have the honor of pairing\nwith Clee--or should I say His Learnedness Right the Honorable Director\nDoctor Cleander Simmsworth Garlock, Doctor of Philosophy, Doctor of\nScience, Prime Operator, President and First Fellow of the Galaxian\nSociety, First Fellow of the Gunther Society, Fellow of the Institute of\nParaphysics, of the Institute of Nuclear Physics, of the College of\nMathematics, of the Congress of Psionicists, and of all the other\ntop-bracket brain-gangs you ever heard of? Also, for your information,\nhis men have given him a couple of informal degrees--P.D.Q. and S.O.B.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nThe big psionicist's expression of saturnine, almost contemptuous\namusement had not changed; his voice came flat and cold. \"The less you\nsay, Doctor Bellamy, the better. Obstinate, swell-headed women give me\nan acute rectal pain. Pitching your curves over all the vizzies in space\ngot you aboard, but it won't get you a thing from here on. And for your\ninformation, Doctor Bellamy, one more crack like that and I take you\nover my knee and blister your fanny.\"\n\n\"Try it, you big, clumsy, muscle-bound gorilla!\" she jeered. \"_That_ I\nwant to see! Any time you want to get both arms broken at the elbows,\njust try it!\"\n\n\"Now's as good a time as any. I like your spirit, babe, but I can't say\na thing for your judgment.\" He got up and started purposefully toward\nher, but both non-combatants came between.\n\n\"Jet back, Clee!\" James protested, both hands against the heavier man's\nchest. \"What the hell kind of show is _that_ to put on?\" And,\nsimultaneously:\n\n\"Belle! Shame on you! Picking a fight already, and with nobody knows how\nmany million people looking on! You know as well as I do that we may\nhave to spend the rest of our lives together, so act like civilized\nbeings--please--both of you! And don't....\"\n\n\"Nobody's watching this but us,\" Garlock interrupted. \"When pussy there\nstarted using her claws I cut the gun.\"\n\n\"That's what _you_ think,\" James said sharply, \"but Fatso and his number\none girl friend are coming in on the tight beam.\"\n\n\"Oh?\" Garlock whirled toward the hitherto dark and silent\nthree-dimensional communications instrument. The face of a bossy-looking\nwoman was already bright.\n\n\"Garlock! How _dare_ you try to cut Chancellor Ferber off?\" she\ndemanded. Her voice was deep-pitched, blatant with authority. \"Here you\nare, sir.\"\n\nThe woman's face shifted to one side and a man's appeared--a face to\njustify in full the nickname \"Fatso.\"\n\n\"'Fatso', eh?\" Chancellor Ferber snarled. Pale eyes glared from the fat\nface. \"That costs you exactly one thousand credits, James.\"\n\n\"How much will this cost me, Fatso?\" Garlock asked.\n\n\"Five thousand--and, since nobody can call me that deliberately,\ndemotion three grades and probation for three years. Make a note, Miss\nFoster.\"\n\n\"Noted, sir.\"\n\n\"Still sure we aren't going anywhere,\" Garlock said. \"_What_ a brain!\"\n\n\"Sure I'm sure!\" Ferber gloated. \"In a couple of hours I'm going to buy\nyour precious starship in as junk. In the meantime, whether you like it\nor not, I'm going to watch your expression while you push all those\npretty buttons and nothing happens.\"\n\n\"The trouble with you, Fatso,\" Garlock said dispassionately, as he\nopened a drawer and took out a pair of cutting pliers, \"is that all your\nstrength is in your glands and none in your alleged brain. There are a\nlot of things--including a lot of tests--you know nothing about. How\nmuch will you see after I've cut one wire?\"\n\n\"You wouldn't dare!\" the fat man shouted. \"I'd fire you--blacklist you\nall over the sys....\"\n\nVoice and images died away and Garlock turned to the two women in the\nMain. He began to smile, but his mental shield did not weaken.\n\n\"You've got a point there, Lola,\" he said, going on as though Ferber's\ninterruption had not occurred. \"Not that I blame either Belle or myself.\nIf anything was ever calculated to drive a man nuts, this farce was. As\nthe only female Prime in the system, Belle should have been in\nautomatically--she had no competition. And to anybody with three brain\ncells working the other place lay between you, Lola, and the other three\nfemale Ops in the age group.\n\n\"But no. Ferber and the rest of the Board--stupidity _uber\nalles_!--think all us Ops and Primes are psycho and that the ship will\nnever even lift. So they made a Grand Circus of it. But they succeeded\nin one thing--with such abysmal stupidity so rampant I'm getting more\nand more reconciled to the idea of our not getting back--at least, for a\nlong, long time.\"\n\n\"Why, they said we had a very good chance....\" Lola began.\n\n\"Yeah, and they said a lot of even bigger damn lies than that one. Have\nyou read any of my papers?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry. I'm not a mathematician.\"\n\n\"Our motion will be purely at random. If it isn't, I'll eat this whole\nship. We won't get back until Jim and I work out something to steer us\nwith. But they must be wondering no end, outside, what the score is, so\nI'm willing to call it a draw--temporarily--and let 'em in again. How\nabout it, Belle?\"\n\n\"A draw it is--temporarily.\" Neither, however, even offered to shake\nhands.\n\n\"Smile pretty, everybody,\" Garlock said, and pressed a stud.\n\n\"... the matter? What's the matter? Oh....\" the worried voice of the\nSystem's ace newscaster came in. \"Power failure _already_?\"\n\n\"No,\" Garlock replied. \"I figured we had a couple of minutes of privacy\ncoming, if you can understand the meaning of the word. Now all four of\nus tell everybody who is watching or listening _au revoir_ or good-bye,\nwhichever it may turn out to be.\" He reached for the switch.\n\n\"Wait a minute!\" the newscaster demanded. \"Leave it on until the last\nposs....\" His voice broke off sharply.\n\n\"Turn it back on!\" Belle ordered.\n\n\"Nix.\"\n\n\"Scared?\" she sneered.\n\n\"You chirped it, bird-brain. I'm scared purple. So would you be, if you\nhad three brain cells working in that glory-hound's head of yours. Get\nset, everybody, and we'll take off.\"\n\n\"Stop it, both of you!\" Lola exclaimed. \"Where do you want us to sit,\nand do we strap down?\"\n\n\"You sit here; Belle at that plate beside Jim. Yes, strap down. There\nprobably won't be any shock, and we should land right side up, but\nthere's no sense in taking chances. Sure your stuff's all aboard?\"\n\n\"Yes, it's in our rooms.\"\n\nThe four secured themselves; the two men checked, for the dozenth time,\ntheir instruments. The pilot donned his scanner. The ship lifted\neffortlessly, noiselessly. Through the atmosphere; through and far\nbeyond the stratosphere. It stopped.\n\n\"Ready, Clee?\" James licked his lips.\n\n\"As ready as I ever will be, I guess. Shoot!\"\n\nThe pilot's right hand, forefinger outstretched, moved\nunenthusiastically toward a red button on his panel ... slowed ...\nstopped. He stared into his scanner at the Earth so far below.\n\n\"Hit it, Jim!\" Garlock snapped. \"_Hit_ it, for goodness sake, before we\n_all_ lose our nerve!\"\n\nJames stabbed convulsively at the button, and in the very instant of\ncontact--instantaneously; without a fractional microsecond of\ntime-lapse--their familiar surroundings disappeared. Or, rather, and\nwithout any sensation of motion, of displacement, or of the passage of\nany time whatsoever, the planet beneath them was no longer their\nfamiliar Earth. The plates showed no familiar stars nor patterns of\nheavenly bodies. The brightly-shining sun was very evidently not their\nfamiliar Sol.\n\n\"Well--we went _somewhere_ ... but not to Alpha Centauri, not much to\nour surprise.\" James gulped twice; then went on, speaking almost\njauntily now that the attempt had been made and had failed. \"So now it's\nup to you, Clee, as Director of Project Gunther and captain of the good\nship _Pleiades_, to boss the more-or-less simple--more, I hope--job of\ngetting us back to Tellus.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nScience, both physical and paraphysical, had done its best. Gunther's\nTheorems, which define the electromagnetic and electrogravitic\nparameters pertaining to the annihilation of distance, had been studied,\ntested, and applied to the full. So had the Psionic Corollaries; which,\nwhile not having the status of paraphysical laws, do allow computation\nof the qualities and magnitudes of the stresses required for any given\napplication of the Gunther Effect.\n\nThe planning of the starship _Pleiades_ had been difficult in the\nextreme; its construction almost impossible. While it was practically a\nforegone conclusion that any man of the requisite caliber would already\nbe a member of the Galaxian Society, the three planets and eight\nsatellites were screened, psionicist by psionicist, to select the two\nstrongest and most versatile of their breed.\n\nThese two, Garlock and James, were heads of departments of, and under\niron-clad contract to, vast Solar System Enterprises, Inc., the only\nconcern able and willing to attempt the building of the first starship.\n\nAlonzo P. Ferber, Chancellor of SSE, however, would not risk a\ntenth-piece of the company's money on such a bird-brained scheme.\nHimself a Gunther First, he believed implicitly that Firsts were in fact\ntops in Gunther ability; that these few self-styled \"Operators\" and\n\"Prime Operators\" were either charlatans or self-deluded crackpots.\nSince he could not feel that so-called \"Operator Field,\" no such thing\ndid or could exist. No Gunther starship could ever, possibly, work.\n\nHe did loan Garlock and James to the Galaxians, but that was as far as\nhe would go. For salaries and for labor, for research and material, for\ntrials and for errors; the Society paid and paid and paid.\n\nThus the starship _Pleiades_ had cost the Galaxian Society almost a\nthousand million credits.\n\nGarlock and James had worked on the ship since its inception. They were\nto be of the crew; for over a year it had been taken for granted that\nwould be its only crew.\n\n        *           *           *\n\nAs the _Pleiades_ neared completion, however, it became clearer and\nclearer that the displacement-control presented an unsolved, and quite\npossibly an insoluble, problem. It was mathematically certain that, when\nthe Gunther field went on, the ship would be displaced instantaneously\nto some location in space having precisely the Gunther coordinates\nrequired by that particular field. One impeccably rigorous analysis\nshowed that the ship would shift into the nearest solar system\npossessing an Earth-type planet; which was believed to be Alpha Centauri\nand which was close enough to Sol so that orientation would be automatic\nand the return to Earth a simple matter.\n\nSince the Gunther Effect did in fact annihilate distance, however,\nanother group of mathematicians, led by Garlock and James, proved with\nequal rigor that the point of destination was no more likely to be any\none given Gunther point than any other one of the myriads of billions of\nequiguntherial points undoubtedly existent throughout the length,\nbreadth, and thickness of our entire normal space-time continuum.\n\nThe two men would go anyway, of course. Carefully-calculated pressures\nwould make them go. It was neither necessary nor desirable, however, for\nthem to go alone.\n\nWherefore the planets and satellites were combed again; this time to\nselect two women--the two most highly-gifted psionicists in the\neighteen-to-twenty-five age group. Thus, if the _Pleiades_ returned\nsuccessfully to Earth, well and good. If she did not, the four selectees\nwould found, upon some far-off world, a race much abler than the\nhumanity of Earth; since eighty-three percent of Earth's dwellers had\npsionic grades lower than Four.\n\nThis search, with its attendant fanfare and studiedly blatant publicity,\nwas so planned and engineered that two selected women did not arrive at\nthe spaceport until a bare fifteen minutes before the scheduled time of\ntake-off. Thus it made no difference whether the women liked the men or\nnot, or vice versa; or whether or not any of them really wanted to make\nthe trip. Pressures were such that each of them had to go, whether he or\nshe wanted to or not.\n\n        *           *           *\n\n\"Cut the rope, Jim, and let the old bucket drop,\" Garlock said. \"Not too\nclose. Before we make any kind of contact we'll have to do some\norganizing. These instruments,\" he waved at his console, \"show that ours\nis the only Operator Field in this whole region of space. Hence, there\nare no Operators and no Primes. That means that from now until we get\nback to Tellus....\"\n\n\"_If_ we get back to Tellus,\" Belle corrected, sweetly.\n\n\"_Until_ we get back to Tellus there will be no Gunthering aboard this\nship....\"\n\n\"_What?_\" Belle broke in again. \"Have you lost your mind?\"\n\n\"There will be little if any lepping, and nothing else at all. At the\ntable, if we want sugar, we will reach for it or have it passed. We will\npick up things, such as cigarettes, with our fingers. We will carry\nlighters and use them. When we go from place to place, we will walk. Is\nthat clear?\"\n\n\"You seem to be talking English,\" Belle sneered, \"but the words don't\nmake sense.\"\n\n\"I didn't think you were that stupid.\" Eyes locked and held. Then\nGarlock grinned savagely. \"Okay. You tell her, Lola, in words of as few\nsyllables as possible.\"\n\n\"Why, to get used to it, of course,\" Lola explained, while Belle glared\nat Garlock in frustrated anger. \"So as not to reveal anything we don't\nhave to.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Miss Montandon, you may go to the head of the class. All\nmonosyllables except two. That should make it clear, even to Miss\nBellamy.\"\n\n\"You ... you _beast_!\" Belle drove a tight-beamed thought. \"I was never\nso insulted in my life!\"\n\n\"You asked for it. Keep on asking for it and you'll keep on getting it.\"\nThen, aloud, to all three, \"In emergencies, of course, anything goes. We\nwill now proceed with business.\" He paused, then went on, bitingly, \"If\npossible.\"\n\n\"One minute, please!\" Belle snapped. \"Just why, Captain Garlock, are you\ninsisting on oral communication, when lepping is so much faster and\nbetter? It's stupid--reactionary. Don't you ever lep?\"\n\n\"With Jim, on business, yes; with women, no more than I have to. What I\nthink is nobody's business but mine.\"\n\n\"What a way to run a ship! Or a project!\"\n\n\"Running this project is my business, not yours; and if there's any one\nthing in the entire universe it does _not_ need, it's a female\nexhibitionist. Besides your obvious qualifications to be one of the Eves\nin case of Ultimate Contingency....\" he broke off and stared at her, his\ncontemptuous gaze traveling slowly, dissectingly, from her toes to the\ntopmost wave of her hair-do.\n\n\"Forty-two, twenty, forty?\" he sneered.\n\n\"You flatter me.\" Her glare was an almost tangible force; her voice was\ncontrolled fury.\n\n\"Thirty-nine, twenty-two, thirty-five. Five seven. One thirty-five. If\nany of it's any of your business, which it isn't. You should be\ndiscussing brains and ability, not vital statistics.\"\n\n\"Brains? You? No, I'll take that back. As a Prime, you _have_ got a\nbrain--one that really works. What do _you_ think you're good for on\nthis project? What can you do?\"\n\n\"I can do anything any man ever born can do, and do it better!\"\n\n\"Okay. Compute a Gunther field that will put us two hundred thousand\nfeet directly above the peak of that mountain.\"\n\n\"That isn't fair--not that I expected fairness from you--and you know\nit. That doesn't take either brains or ability....\"\n\n\"Oh, no?\"\n\n\"No. Merely highly specialized training that you know I haven't had.\nGive me a five-tape course on it and I'll come closer than either you or\nJames; for a hundred credits a shot.\"\n\n\"I'll do just that. Something you _are_ supposed to know, then. How\nwould you go about making first contact?\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\n\"Well, I wouldn't do it the way _you_ would--by knocking down the first\nnative I saw, putting my foot on his face, and yelling 'Bow down, you\nstupid, ignorant beasts, and worship me, the Supreme God of the\nMacrocosmic Universe'!\"\n\n\"Try again, Belle, that one missed me by....\"\n\n\"Hold it, both of you!\" James broke in. \"What the hell are you trying to\nprove? How about cutting out this cat-and-dog act and getting some work\ndone?\"\n\n\"You've got a point there,\" Garlock admitted, holding his temper by a\nvisible effort. \"Sorry, Jim. Belle, what were you briefed for?\"\n\n\"To understudy you.\" She, too, fought her temper down. \"To learn\neverything about Project Gunther. I have a whole box of tapes in my\nroom, including advanced Gunther math and first-contact techniques. I'm\nto study them during all my on-watch time unless you assign other\nduties.\"\n\n\"No matter what your duties may be, you'll have to have time to study.\nIf you don't find what you want in your own tapes--and you probably\nwon't, since Ferber and his Miss Foster ran the selections--use our\nlibrary. It's good--designed to carry on our civilization. Miss\nMontandon? No, that's silly, the way we're fixed. Lola?\"\n\n\"I'm to learn how to be Doctor James'....\"\n\n\"Jim, please, Lola,\" James said. \"And call him Clee.\"\n\n\"I'd like that.\" She smiled winningly. \"And my friends call me\n'Brownie'.\"\n\n\"I see why they would. It fits like a coat of lacquer.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nIt did. Her hair was a dark, lustrous brown, as were her eyebrows. Her\neyes were brown. Her skin, too--her dark red playsuit left little to the\nimagination--was a rich and even brown. Originally fairly dark, it had\nbeen tanned to a more-than-fashionable depth of color by naked\nsun-bathing and by practically-naked outdoor sports. A couple of inches\nshorter than the green-haired girl, she too had a figure to make any\nsculptor drool.\n\n\"I'm to be Dr. Jim's assistant. I have a thousand tapes, more or less,\nto study, too. It'll be quite a while, I'm afraid, before I can be of\nmuch use, but I'll do the best I can.\"\n\n\"If we had hit Alpha Centauri that arrangement would have been good, but\nas we are, it isn't.\" Garlock frowned in thought, his heavy black\neyebrows almost meeting above his finely-chiseled aquiline nose. \"Since\nneither Jim nor I need an assistant any more than we need tails, it was\ndesigned to give you girls something to do. But out here, lost, there's\nwork for a dozen trained specialists and there are only four of us. So\nwe shouldn't duplicate effort. Right? You first, Belle.\"\n\n\"Are you asking me or telling me?\" she asked. \"And that's a fair\nquestion. Don't read anything into it that isn't there. With your\nattitude, I want information.\"\n\n\"I am asking you,\" he replied, carefully. \"For your information, when I\nknow what should be done, I give orders. When I don't know, as now, I\nask advice. If I like it, I follow it. Fair enough?\"\n\n\"Fair enough. We're apt to need any number of specialists.\"\n\n\"Lola?\"\n\n\"Of course we shouldn't duplicate. What shall I study?\"\n\n\"That's what we must figure out. We can't do it exactly, of course; all\nwe can do now is to set up a rough scheme. Jim's job is the only one\nthat's definite. He'll have to work full time on nebular configurations.\nIf we hit inhabited planets he'll have to add their star-charts to his\nown. That leaves three of us to do all the other work of a survey.\nIdeally, we would cover all the factors that would be of use in getting\nus back to Tellus, but since we don't know what those factors are....\nFound out anything yet, Jim?\"\n\n\"A little. Tellus-type planet, apparently strictly so. Oceans and\ncontinents. Lots of inhabitants--farms, villages, all sizes of cities.\nNot close enough to say definitely, but inhabitants seem to be humanoid,\nif not human.\"\n\n\"Hold her here. Besides astronomy, which is all yours, what do we need\nmost?\"\n\n\"We should have enough to classify planets and inhabitants, so as to\nchart a space-trend if there is any. I'd say the most important ones\nwould be geology, stratigraphy, paleontology, oceanography, xenology,\nanthropology, ethnology, vertebrate biology, botany, and at least some\necology.\"\n\n\"That's about the list I was afraid of. But there are only three of us.\nThe fields you mention number much more.\"\n\n\"Each of you will have to be a lot of specialists in one, then. I'd say\nthe best split would be planetology, xenology, and anthropology--each,\nof course, stretched all out of shape to cover dozens of related and\nnon-related specialties.\"\n\n\"Good enough. Xenology, of course, is mine. Contacts, liaison, politics,\ncorrelation, and so on, as well as studying the non-human life\nforms--including as many lower animals and plants as possible. I'll make\na stab at it. Now, Belle, since you're a Prime and Lola's an Operator,\nyou get the next toughest job. Planetography.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" Belle smiled and began to act as one of the party. \"All I\nknow about it is a hazy idea of what the word means, but I'll start\nstudying as soon as we get squared away.\"\n\n\"Thanks. That leaves anthropology to you, Lola. Besides, that's your\nline, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes. Sociological Anthropology. I have my M.S. in it, and am--was, I\nmean--working for my Ph.D. But as Jim said, it isn't only the one\nspecialty. You want me, I take it, to cover humanoid races, too?\"\n\n\"Check. You and Jim both, then, will know what you're doing, while Belle\nand I are trying to play ours by ear.\"\n\n\"Where do we draw the line between humanoid and non-human?\"\n\n\"In case of doubt we'll confer. That covers it as much as we can, I\nthink. Take us down, Jim--and be on your toes to take evasive action\nfast.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nThe ship dropped rapidly toward an airport just outside a fairly large\ncity. Fifty thousand--forty thousand--thirty thousand feet.\n\n\"Calling strange spaceship--you must be a spaceship, in spite of your\ntremendous, hitherto-considered-impossible mass--\" a thought impinged on\nall four Tellurian minds, \"do you read me?\"\n\n\"I read you clearly. This is the Tellurian spaceship _Pleiades_, Captain\nGarlock commanding, asking permission to land and information as to\nlanding conventions.\" He did not have to tell James to stop the ship;\nJames had already done so.\n\n\"I was about to ask you to hold position; I thank you for having done\nso. Hold for inspection and type-test, please. We will not blast unless\nyou fire first. A few minutes, please.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nA group of twelve jet fighters took off practically vertically upward\nand climbed with fantastic speed. They leveled off a thousand feet below\nthe _Pleiades_ and made a flying circle. Up and into the ring thus\nformed there lumbered a large, clumsy-looking helicopter.\n\n\"We have no record of any planet named 'Tellus'; nor of any such ship as\nyours. Of such incredible mass and with no visible or detectable means\nof support or of propulsion. Not from this part of the galaxy, certainly\n... could it be that intergalactic travel is actually possible? But\nexcuse me, Captain Garlock, none of that is any of my business; which is\nto determine whether or not you four Tellurian human beings are\ncompatible with, and thus acceptable to, our humanity of Hodell ... but\nyou do not seem to have a standard televideo testing-box aboard.\"\n\n\"No, sir; only our own tri-di and teevee.\"\n\n\"You must be examined by means of a standard box. I will rise to your\nlevel and teleport one across to you. It is self-powered and fully\nautomatic.\"\n\n\"You needn't rise, sir. Just toss the box out of your 'copter into the\nair. We'll take it from there.\" Then, to James, \"Take it, Jim.\"\n\n\"Oh? You can lift large masses against much gravity?\" The alien was all\nattention. \"I have not known that such power existed. I will observe\nwith keen interest.\"\n\n\"I have it,\" James said. \"Here it is.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" Garlock said to the alien. Then, to Lola: \"You've been\nreading these--these Hodellians?\"\n\n\"The officer in the helicopter and those in the fighters, yes. Most of\nthem are Gunther Firsts.\"\n\n\"Good girl. The set's coming to life--watch it.\"\n\nThe likeness of the alien being became clear upon the alien screen;\nvisible from the waist up. While humanoid, the creature was very far\nindeed from being human. He--at least, it had masculine rudimentary\nnipples--had double shoulders and four arms. His skin was a vividly\nintense cobalt blue. His ears were black, long, and highly dirigible.\nHis eyes, a flaming red in color, were large and vertically-slitted,\nlike a cat's. He had no hair at all. His nose was large and Roman; his\njaw was square, almost jutting; his bright-yellow teeth were clean and\nsharp.\n\nAfter a minute of study the alien said: \"Although your vessel is so\nentirely alien that nothing even remotely like it is on record, you four\nare completely human and, if of compatible type, acceptable. Are there\nany other living beings aboard with you?\"\n\n\"Excepting micro-organisms, none.\"\n\n\"Such life is of no importance. Approach, please, one of you, and grasp\nwith a hand the projecting metal knob.\"\n\nWith a little trepidation, Garlock did so. He felt no unusual sensation\nat the contact.\n\n\"All four of you are compatible and we accept you. This finding is\nsurprising in the extreme, as you are the first human beings of record\nwho grade higher than what you call Gunther Two ... or Gunther Second?\"\n\n\"Either one; the terms are interchangeable.\"\n\n\"You have minds of tremendous development and power; definitely superior\neven to my own. However, there is no doubt that physically you are\nperfectly compatible with our humanity. Your blood will be of great\nbenefit to it. You may land. Goodbye.\"\n\n\"Wait, please. How about landing conventions? And visiting restrictions\nand so on? And may we keep this box? We will be glad to trade you\nsomething for it, if we have anything you would like to have?\"\n\n\"Ah, I should have realized that your customs would be widely different\nfrom ours. Since you have been examined and accepted, there are no\nrestrictions. You will not act against humanity's good. Land where you\nplease, go where you please, do what you please as long as you please.\nTake up permanent residence or leave as soon as you please. Marry if you\nlike, or simply breed--your unions with this planet's humanity will be\nfertile. Keep the box without payment. As Guardians of Humanity we\nArpalones do whatever small favors we can. Have I made myself clear?\"\n\n\"Abundantly so. Thank you, sir.\"\n\n\"Now I really must go. Goodbye.\"\n\nGarlock glanced into his plate. The jets had disappeared, the helicopter\nwas falling rapidly away. He wiped his brow.\n\n\"Well, I'll be damned,\" he said.\n\n        *           *           *\n\nWhen his amazement subsided he turned to the business at hand. \"Lola, do\nyou check me that this planet is named Hodell, that it is populated by\ncreatures exactly like us? Arpalones?\"\n\n\"Exactly, except they aren't 'creatures'. They are humanoids, and very\nfine people.\"\n\n\"You'd think so, of course ... correction accepted. Well, let's take\nadvantage of their extraordinarily hospitable invitation and go down.\nCut the rope, Jim.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nThe airport was very large, and was divided into several sections, each\nof which was equipped with runways and/or other landing facilities to\nsuit one class of craft--propellor jobs, jets, or helicopters. There\nwere even a few structures that looked like rocket pits.\n\n\"Where are you going to sit down, Jim? With the 'copters or over by the\nblast-pits?\"\n\n\"With the 'copters, I think. Since I can place her to within a couple of\ninches. I'll put her squarely into that far corner, where she'll be out\nof everybody's way.\"\n\n\"No concrete out there,\" Garlock said. \"But the ground seems good and\nsolid.\"\n\n\"We'd better not land on concrete,\" James grinned. \"Unless it's terrific\nstuff we'd smash it. On bare ground, the worst we can do is sink in a\nfoot or so, and that won't hurt anything.\"\n\n\"Check. A few tons to the square foot, is all. Shall we strap down and\nhang onto our teeth?\"\n\n\"Who do you think you're kidding, boss? Even though I've got to do this\non manual, I won't tip over a half-piece standing on edge.\"\n\nJames stopped talking, pulled out his scanner, stuck his face into it.\nThe immense starship settled downward toward the selected corner. There\nwas no noise, no blast, no flame, no slightest visible or detectable\nsign of whatever force it was that was braking the thousands of tons of\nthe vessel's mass in its miles-long, almost-vertical plunge to ground.\n\nWhen the _Pleiades_ struck ground the impact was scarcely to be felt.\nWhen she came to rest, after settling into the ground her allotted \"foot\nor so,\" there was no jar at all.\n\n\"Atmosphere, temperature, and so on, approximately Earth-normal,\"\nGarlock said. \"Just as our friend said it would be.\"\n\nJames scanned the city and the field. \"Our visit is kicking up a lot of\nexcitement. Shall we go out?\"\n\n\"Not yet!\" Belle exclaimed. \"I want to see how the women are dressed,\nfirst.\"\n\n\"So do I,\" Lola added, \"and some other things besides.\"\n\nBoth women--Lola through her Operator's scanner; Belle by manipulating\nthe ship's tremendous Operator Field by the sheer power of her Prime\nOperator's mind--stared eagerly at the crowd of people now beginning to\nstream across the field.\n\n\"As an anthropologist,\" Lola announced, \"I'm not only surprised. I am\nshocked, annoyed, and disgruntled. Why, they're _exactly_ like white\nTellurian human beings!\"\n\n\"But _look_ at their _clothes_!\" Belle insisted. \"They're wearing\nanything and everything, from bikinis to coveralls!\"\n\n\"Yes, but notice.\" This was the anthropological scientist speaking now.\n\"Breasts and loins, covered. Faces, uncovered. Heads and feet and hands,\neither bare or covered. Ditto for legs up to there, backs, arms, necks\nand shoulders down to here, and torsos clear down to there. We'll not\nviolate any conventions by going out as we are. Not even you, Belle. You\nfirst, Chief. Yours the high honor of setting first foot--the biggest\nfoot we've got, too--on alien soil.\"\n\n\"To hell with that. We'll go out together.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" Lola went on. \"There's a funny-looking automobile just\ncoming through the gate. The Press. Three men and two women. Two\ncameras, one walkie-talkie, and two microphones. The photog in the\npurple shirt is really a sharpie at lepping. Class Three, at\nleast--possibly a Two.\"\n\n\"How about screens down enough to lep, boss?\" Belle suggested. \"Faster.\nWe may need it.\"\n\n\"Check. I'm too busy to record, anyway--I'll log this stuff up tonight,\"\nand thoughts flew.\n\n\"Check me, Jim,\" Garlock flashed. \"Telepathy, very good. On Gunther, the\nguy was right--no signs at all of any First activity, and very few\nSeconds.\"\n\n\"Check,\" James agreed.\n\n\"And Lola, those 'Guardians' out there. I thought they were the same as\nthe Arpalone we talked to. They aren't. Not even telepathic. Same color\nscheme, is all.\"\n\n\"Right. Much more brutish. Much flatter cranium. Long, tearing canine\nteeth. Carnivorous. I'll call them just 'guardians' until we find out\nwhat they really are.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nThe press car arrived and the Tellurians disembarked--and, accidentally\nor not, it was Belle's green slipper that first touched ground. There\nwas a terrific babel of thought, worse, even, than voices in similar\ncase, in being so much faster. The reporters, all of them, wanted to\nknow everything at once. How, what, where, when, and why. Also who. And\nall about Tellus and the Tellurian solar system. How did the visitors\nlike Hodell? And all about Belle's green hair. And the photographers\nwere prodigal of film, shooting everything from all possible angles.\n\n\"Hold it!\" Garlock loosed a blast of thought that \"silenced\" almost the\nwhole field. \"We will have order, please. Lola Montandon, our\nanthropologist, will take charge. Keep it orderly, Lola, if you have to\nthrow half of them off the field. I'm going over to Administration and\ncheck in. One of you reporters can come with me, if you like.\"\n\nThe man in the purple shirt got his bid in first. As the two men walked\naway together, Garlock noted that the man was in fact a Second--his flow\nof lucid, cogent thought did not interfere at all with the steady stream\nof speech going into his portable recorder. Garlock also noticed that in\nany group of more than a dozen people there was always at least one\nguardian. They paid no attention whatever to the people, who in turn\nignored them completely. Garlock wondered briefly. Guardians? The\nArpalones, out in space, yes. But these creatures, naked and unarmed on\nthe ground? The Arpalones were non-human people. These things\nwere--what?\n\nAt the door of the Field Office the reporter, after turning\nGarlock over to a startlingly beautiful, leggy, breasty, blonde\nreceptionist-usherette, hurried away.\n\n        *           *           *\n\nHe flecked a feeler at her mind and stiffened. How could a Two--a high\nTwo, at that--be working as an usher? And with her guard down clear to\nthe floor? He probed--and saw.\n\n\"Lola!\" He flashed a tight-beamed thought. \"You aren't putting out\nanything about our sexual customs, family life, and so on.\"\n\n\"Of course not. We must know their mores first.\"\n\n\"Good girl. Keep your shield up.\"\n\n\"Oh, we're so glad to see you, Captain Garlock, sir!\" The blonde, who\nwas dressed little more heavily than the cigarette girls in Venusberg's\nCartier Room, seized his left hand in both of hers and held it\nconsiderably longer than was necessary. Her dazzling smile, her laughing\neyes, her flashing white teeth, the many exposed inches of her skin, and\nher completely unshielded mind; all waved banners of welcome.\n\n\"Captain Garlock, sir, Governor Atterlin has been most anxious to see\nyou ever since you were first detected. This way, please, sir.\" She\nturned, brushing her bare hip against his leg in the process, and led\nhim by the hand along a hallway. Her thoughts flowed. \"I have been, too,\nsir, and I'm simply delighted to see you close up, and I hope to see a\nlot more of you. You're a wonderfully pleasant surprise, sir; I've never\nseen a man like you before. I don't think Hodell ever saw a man like you\nbefore, sir. With such a really terrific mind and yet so big and strong\nand well-built and handsome and clean-looking and blackish. You're\nwonderful, Captain Garlock, sir. You'll be here a long time, I hope?\nHere we are, sir.\"\n\nShe opened a door, walked across the room, sat down in an overstuffed\nchair, and crossed her legs meticulously. Then, still smiling happily,\nshe followed with eager eyes and mind Garlock's every move.\n\nGarlock had been reading Governor Atterlin; knew why it was the governor\nwho was in that office instead of the port manager. He knew that\nAtterlin had been reading him--as much as he had allowed. They had\nalready discussed many things, and were still discussing.\n\nThe room was much more like a library than an office. The governor, a\nmiddle-aged, red-headed man a trifle inclined to portliness, had been\nseated in a huge reclining chair facing a teevee screen, but got up to\nshake hands.\n\n\"Welcome, friend Captain Garlock. Now, to continue. As to exchange. Many\nships visiting us have nothing we need or can use. For such, all\nservices are free--or rather, are paid by the city. Our currency is\nbased upon platinum, but gold, silver, and copper are valuable. Certain\njewels, also....\"\n\n\"That's far enough. We will pay our way--we have plenty of metal. What\nare your ratios of value for the four metals here on Hodell?\"\n\n\"Today's quotations are....\" He glanced at a screen, and his fingers\nflashed over the keys of a computer beside his chair. \"One weight of\nplatinum is equal in value to seven point three four six....\"\n\n\"Decimals are not necessary, sir.\"\n\n\"Seven plus, then, weights of gold. One of gold to eleven of silver. One\nof silver to four of copper.\"\n\n\"Thank you. We'll use platinum. I'll bring some bullion tomorrow morning\nand exchange it for your currency. Shall I bring it here, or to a bank\nin the city?\"\n\n\"Either. Or we can have an armored truck visit your ship.\"\n\n\"That would be better yet. Have them bring about five thousand tanes.\nThank you very much, Governor Atterlin, and good afternoon to you, sir.\"\n\n\"And good afternoon to you, sir. Until tomorrow, then.\"\n\nGarlock turned to leave.\n\n\"Oh, may I go with you to your ship, sir, to take just a little look at\nit?\" the girl asked, winningly.\n\n\"Of course, Grand Lady Neldine, I'd like to have your company.\"\n\nShe seized his elbow and hugged it quickly against her breast. Then,\ntaking his hand, she walked--almost skipped--along beside him. \"And I\nwant to see Pilot James close up, too, sir--he's not nearly as wonderful\nas you are, sir--and I wonder why Planetographer Bellamy's hair is\ngreen? Very striking, of course, sir, but I don't think I'd care for it\nmuch on me--unless you'd think I should, sir?\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nBelle knew, of course, that they were coming; and Garlock knew that\nBelle's hackles were very much on the rise. She could not read him,\nexcept very superficially, but she was reading the strange girl like a\nbook and was not liking anything she read. Wherefore, when Garlock and\nhis joyous companion reached the great spaceship--\n\n\"How come you picked up _that_ little man-eating shark?\" she sent,\nvenomously, on a tight band.\n\n\"It wasn't a case of picking her up.\" Garlock grinned. \"I haven't been\nable to find any urbane way of scraping her off. First Contact, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"She wants altogether too much Contact for a First--I'll scrape her off,\neven if she is one of the nobler class on this world....\" Belle changed\nher tactics even before Garlock began his reprimand. \"I shouldn't have\nsaid that, Clee, of course.\" She laughed lightly. \"It was just the\nshock; there wasn't anything in any of my First Contact tapes covering\nwhat to do about beautiful and enticing girls who try to seduce our men.\nShe doesn't know, though, of course, that she's supposed to be a\nbug-eyed monster and not human at all. Won't Xenology be in for a rough\nride when we check in? Wow!\"\n\n\"You can play _that_ in spades, sister.\" And for the rest of the day\nBelle played flawlessly the role of perfect hostess.\n\nIt was full dark before the Hodellians could be persuaded to leave the\n_Pleiades_ and the locks were closed.\n\n        *           *           *\n\n\"I have refused one hundred seventy-eight invitations,\" Lola reported\nthen. \"All of us, individually and collectively, have been invited to\neat everything, everywhere in town. To see shows in a dozen different\ntheaters and eighteen night spots. To dance all night in twenty-one\ndifferent places, ranging from dives to strictly soup-and-fish. I was\nnice about it, of course--just begged off because we were dead from our\nbelts both ways from our long, hard trip. My thought, of course, is that\nwe'd better eat our own food and take it slowly at first. Check, Clee?\"\n\n\"On the beam, dead center. And you weren't lying much, either. I feel as\nthough I'd done a day's work. After supper there's a thing I've got to\ndiscuss with all three of you.\"\n\nSupper was soon over. Then:\n\n\"We've got to make a mighty important decision,\" Garlock began,\nabruptly. \"Grand Lady Neldine--that title isn't exact, but\nclose--wondered why I didn't respond at all, either way. However, she\ndidn't make a point of it, and I let her wonder; but we'll have to\ndecide by tomorrow morning what to do, and it'll have to be airtight.\nThese Hodellians expect Jim and me to impregnate as many as possible of\ntheir highest-rated women before we leave. By their Code it's mandatory,\nsince we can't hide the fact that we rate much higher than they\ndo--their highest rating is only Grade Two by our standards--and all the\nplanets hereabouts up-grade themselves with the highest-grade new blood\nthey can find. Ordinarily, they'd expect you two girls to become\npregnant by your choices of the top men of the planet; but they know you\nwouldn't breed down and don't expect you to. But how in all hell can Jim\nand I refuse to breed them up without dealing out the deadliest insult\nthey know?\"\n\nThere was a minute of silence. \"We can't,\" James said then. A grin began\nto spread over his face. \"It might not be too bad an idea, at that, come\nto think of it. That ball of fire they picked out for you would be a\nblue-ribbon dish in anybody's cook-book. And Grand Lady Lemphi--\" He\nkissed the tips of two fingers and waved them in the air. \"Strictly Big\nLeague Material; in capital letters.\"\n\n\"Is that nice, you back-alley tomcat?\" Belle asked, plaintively; then\npaused in thought and went on slowly, \"I won't pretend to like it, but I\nwon't do any public screaming about it.\"\n\n\"Any anthropologist would say you'll have to,\" Lola declared without\nhesitation. \"I don't like it, either. I think it's horrible; but it's\nexcellent genetics and we cannot and must not violate systems-wide\nmores.\"\n\n\"You're all missing the point!\" Garlock snapped. He got up, jammed his\nhands into his pockets, and began to pace the floor. \"I didn't think any\none of you was _that_ stupid! If _that_ was all there were to it we'd do\nit as a matter of course. But _think_, damn it! There's nothing higher\nthan Gunther Two in the humanity of this planet. Telepathy is the only\nESP they have. High Gunther uses hitherto unused portions of the brain.\nIt's transmitted through genes, which are dominant, cumulative, and\nself-multiplying by interaction. Jim and I carry more, stronger, and\nhigher Gunther genes than any other two men known to live. Can\nwe--_dare_ we--plant such genes where none have ever been known before?\"\n\nTwo full minutes of silence.\n\n\"That one has _really_ got a bone in it,\" James said, unhelpfully.\n\n        *           *           *\n\nThree minutes more of silence.\n\n\"It's up to you, Lola,\" Garlock said then. \"It's your field.\"\n\n\"I was afraid of that. There's a way. Personally, I like it less even\nthan the other, but it's the only one I've been able to think up. First,\nare you absolutely sure that our refusal--Belle's and mine, I mean--to\nbreed down will be valid with them?\"\n\n\"Positive.\"\n\n\"Then the whole society from which we come will have to be strictly\nmonogamous, in the narrowest, most literal sense of the term. No\nexceptions whatever. Adultery, anything illicit, has always been not\nonly unimaginable, but in fact impossible. We pair--or marry, or\nwhatever they do here--once only. For life. Desire and potency can exist\nonly within the pair; never outside it. Like eagles. If a man's wife\ndies, even, he loses all desire and all potency. That would make it\nphysically impossible for you two to follow the Hodellian Code. You'd\nboth be completely impotent with any women whatever except your\nmates--Belle and me.\"\n\n\"That will work,\" Belle said. \"_How_ it will work!\" She paused. Then,\nsuddenly, she whistled; the loud, full-bodied, ear-piercing,\ntongue-and-teeth whistle which so few women ever master. Her eyes\nsparkled and she began to laugh with unrestrained glee. \"But do you know\nwhat you've done, Lola?\"\n\n\"Nothing, except to suggest a solution. What's so funny about that?\"\n\n\"You're wonderful, Lola--simply priceless! You've created something\nbrand-new to science--an impotent tomcat! And the more I think about\nit....\" Belle was rocking back and forth with laughter. She could not\npossibly talk, but her thought flowed on, \"I just love you all to\npieces! An _impotent tomcat_, and he'll _have_ to stay true to me--Oh,\nthis is simply _killing_ me--I'll _never_ live through it!\"\n\n\"It _does_ put us on the spot--especially Jim,\" came Garlock's thought.\n\n        *           *           *\n\nHe, too, began to laugh; and Lola, as soon as she stopped thinking about\nthe thing only as a problem in anthropology, joined in. James, however,\ndid not think it was very funny.\n\n\"And that's less than half of it!\" Belle went on, still unable to talk.\n\"Think of Clee, Lola. Six two--over two hundred--hard as nails--a\nperfect hunk of hard red meat--telling this whole damn cockeyed region\nof space that he's impotent, too! And with a perfectly straight face!\nAnd it ties in so _beautifully_ with his making no response, yes or no,\nwhen she propositioned him. The poor, innocent, impotent lamb just\nsimply didn't have even the faintest inkling of what she meant! Oh,\nmy....\"\n\n\"Listen--_listen_--_listen_!\" James managed finally to break in. \"Not\nthat I want to be promiscuous, but....\"\n\n\"There, there, my precious little impotent tomcat,\" Belle soothed him\naloud, between giggles and snorts. \"Us Earth-girls will take care of our\nlover-boys, see if we don't. You won't need any nasty little....\" Belle\ncould not hold the pose, but went off again into whoops of laughter.\n\"_What_ a brain you've got, Lola! I thought I could imagine _anything_,\nbut to make these two guys of ours--the two absolute tops of the whole\nSolar System--it's a stroke of genius....\"\n\n\"Shut up, will you, you human hyena, and _listen_!\" James roared aloud.\n\"There ought to be _some_ better way than that.\"\n\n\"Better? Than sheer perfection?\" Belle was still laughing but could now\ntalk coherently.\n\n\"If you can think of another way, Jim, the meeting is still open.\"\nGarlock was wiping his eyes. \"But it'll have to be a dilly. I'm not\nexactly enamored of Lola's idea, either, but as the answer it's one\nhundred percent to as many decimal places as you want to take time to\nwrite zeroes.\"\n\nThere was more talk, but no improvement could be made upon Lola's idea.\n\n\"Well, we've got until morning,\" Garlock said, finally. \"If anybody\ncomes up with anything by then, let me know. If not, it goes into effect\nthe minute we open the locks. The meeting is adjourned.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nBelle and James left the room; and, a few minutes later, Garlock went\nout. Lola followed him into his room and closed the door behind her. She\nsat down on the edge of a chair, lighted a cigarette, and began to smoke\nin short, nervous puffs. She opened her mouth to say something, but shut\nit without making a sound.\n\n\"You're afraid of me, Lola?\" he asked, quietly.\n\n\"Oh, I don't.... Well, that is....\" She wouldn't lie, and she wouldn't\nadmit the truth. \"You see, I've never ... I mean, I haven't had very\nmuch experience.\"\n\n\"You needn't be afraid of me at all. I'm not going to pair with you.\"\n\n\"You're not?\" Her mouth dropped open and the cigarette fell out of it.\nShe took a few seconds to recover it. \"Why not? Don't you think I could\ndo a good enough job?\"\n\nShe stood up and stretched, to show her splendid figure to its best\nadvantage.\n\nGarlock laughed. \"Nothing like that, Lola; you have plenty of sex\nappeal. It's just that I don't like the conditions. I never have paired.\nI never have had much to do with women, and that little has been urbane,\nlogical, and strictly _en passant_; on the level of mutual physical\ndesire. Thus, I have never taken a virgin. Pairing with one is very\ndefinitely not my idea of urbanity and there's altogether too much\nobligation to suit me. For all of which good reasons I am not going to\npair with you, now or ever.\"\n\n\"How do you know whether I'm a virgin or not? You've never read me that\ndeep. Nobody can. Not even you, unless I let you.\"\n\n\"Reading isn't necessary--you flaunt it like a banner.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you mean.... I certainly don't do it intentionally.\nBut I ought to pair with you, Clee!\" Lola had lost all of her\nnervousness, most of her fear. \"It's part of the job I was chosen for.\nIf I'd known, I'd've gone out and got some experience. Really I would\nhave.\"\n\n\"I believe that. I think you would have been silly enough to have done\njust that. And you have a very high regard for your virginity, too,\ndon't you?\"\n\n\"Well, I ... I used to. But we'd better go ahead with it. I've _got_\nto.\"\n\n\"No such thing. Permissible, but not obligatory.\"\n\n\"But it was assumed. As a matter of course. Anyway ... well, when that\ngirl started making passes at you, I thought you could have just as much\nfun, or even more--she's charming; a real darling, isn't she?--without\npairing with me, and then I had to open my big mouth and be the one to\nkeep you from playing games with _anyone except_ me, and I certainly am\nnot going to let you suffer....\"\n\n\"Bunk!\" Garlock snorted. \"Sheer flapdoodle! Pure psychological\nprop-wash, started and maintained by men who are either too weak to\ndirect and control their drives or who haven't any real work to occupy\ntheir minds. It applies to many men, of course, possibly to most. It\ndoes not, however, apply to all, and, it lacks one whole hell of a lot\nof applying to me. Does that make you feel better?\"\n\n\"Oh, it does ... it does. Thanks, Clee. You know, I like you, a lot.\"\n\n\"Do you? Kiss me.\"\n\nShe did so.\n\n\"See?\"\n\n\"You _tricked_ me!\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\n\"I did not. I want you to see the truth and face it. Your idealism is\nadmirable, permanent, and shatter-proof; but your starry-eyed\nschoolgirl's mawkishness is none of the three. You'll have to grow up,\nsome day. In my opinion, forcing yourself to give up one of your\nhardest-held ideals--virginity--merely because of the utter bilge that\nthose idiot head-shrinkers stuffed you with, is sheer, plain idiocy. I\nsuppose that makes you like me even less, but I'm laying it right on the\nline.\"\n\n\"No ... more. I'll argue with you, when we have time, about some of your\npoints, but the last one--if it's valid--has tremendous force. I didn't\nknow men felt that way. But no matter what my feeling for you really is,\nI'm really grateful to you for the reprieve ... and you know, Clee, I'm\npretty sure you're going to get us back home. If anyone can, you can.\"\n\n\"I'm going to try to. Even if I can't, it will be Belle, not you, that\nI'll take for the long pull. And not because you'd rather have\nJim--which you would, of course....\"\n\n\"To be honest, I think I would.\"\n\n\"Certainly. He's your type. You're not mine; Belle is. Well, that\nbuttons it up, Brownie, except for one thing. To Jim and Belle and\neveryone else, we're paired.\"\n\n\"Of course. Urbanity, as well as to present a united front to any and\nall worlds.\"\n\n\"Check. So watch your shield.\"\n\n\"I always do. That stuff is 'way, 'way down. I'm awfully glad you called\nme 'Brownie,' Clee. I didn't think you ever would.\"\n\n\"I didn't expect to--but I never talked to a woman this way before,\neither. Maybe it had a mellowing effect.\"\n\n\"You don't _need_ mellowing--I do like you a lot, just exactly as you\nare.\"\n\n\"If true, I'm very glad of it. But don't strain yourself; and I mean\nthat literally, not as sarcasm.\"\n\n\"I know. I'm not straining a bit, and this'll prove it.\"\n\nShe kissed him again, and this time it was a production.\n\n\"That was an eminently convincing demonstration, Brownie, but don't do\nit too often.\"\n\n\"I won't.\" She laughed, gayly and happily. \"If there's any next time,\nyou'll have to kiss me first.\"\n\nShe paused and sobered. \"But remember. If you should change your mind,\nany time you really want to ... to kiss me, come right in. I won't be as\nsilly and nervous and afraid as I was just now. That's a promise. Good\nnight, Clee.\"\n\n\"Good night, Brownie.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\n\nNext morning, Garlock was the last one, by a fraction of a minute, into\nthe Main. \"Good morning, all,\" he said, with a slight smile.\n\n\"Huh? How come?\" James demanded, as all four started toward the dining\nnook.\n\nGarlock's smile widened. \"Lola. She brought me a pot of coffee and\nwouldn't let me out until I drank it.\"\n\n\"_Brought?_\"\n\n\"Yeah. They haven't read their room-tapes yet, so they don't know that\nroom-service is practically unlimited.\"\n\n\"Why didn't I think of that coffee business a couple of years ago?\"\n\n\"Well, why didn't I think of it myself, ten years ago?\"\n\nBelle's eyes had been going from one, man to the other. \"Just _what_ are\nyou two talking about? If it's anybody's business except your own?\"\n\n\"He is an early-morning grouch,\" James explained, as they sat down at\nthe table. \"Not fit to associate with man or beast--not even his own\ndog, if he had one--when he first gets up. How come you were smart\nenough to get the answer so quick, Brownie?\"\n\n\"Oh, the pattern isn't too rare.\" She shrugged daintily, sweeping the\ncompliment aside. \"Especially among men on big jobs who work under\ntremendous pressure.\"\n\n\"Then how about Jim?\" Belle asked.\n\n\"Clee's the Big Brain, not me,\" James said.\n\n\"You're a lot Bigger Brain than any of the men Lola's talking about,\"\nBelle insisted.\n\n\"That's true,\" Lola agreed, \"but Jim probably is--must be--an icebox\nraider. Eats in the middle of the night. Clee probably doesn't. It's a\ngood bet that he doesn't nibble between meals at all. Check, Clee?\"\n\n\"Check. But what has an empty stomach got to do with the case?\"\n\n\"Everything. Nobody knows how. Lots of theories--enzymes, blood sugar,\nendocrine balance, what have you--but no proof. It isn't always true.\nHowever, six or seven hours of empty stomach, in a man who takes his job\nto bed with him, is very apt to uglify his pre-breakfast disposition.\"\n\nBreakfast over and out in the Main:\n\n\"But when a man's disposition is ugly all the time, how can you tell the\ndifference?\" Belle asked, innocently.\n\n\"I'll let that pass,\" Garlock's smile disappeared, \"because we've got\nwork to do. Have any of you thought of any improvement on Lola's\nmonogamous society?\"\n\nNo one had. In fact--\n\n\"There may be a loop-hole in it,\" Lola said, thoughtfully. \"Did any of\nyou happen to notice whether they know anything about artificial\ninsemination?\"\n\n\"D'you think I'd stand for _that_?\" Belle blazed, before Garlock could\nbegin to search his mind. \"I'd scratch anybody's eyes out--if you'd\nthought of that idea as a woman instead of as a near-Ph.D. in\nanthropology you'd've thrown it into the converter before it even\nhatched!\"\n\n\"Invasion of privacy? That covers it, of course, but I didn't think it\nwould bother you a bit.\" Lola paused, studying the other girl intently.\n\"You're quite a problem yourself. Callous--utterly savage humor--yet\nvery sensitive in some ways--fastidious....\"\n\n\"I'm not on the table for dissection!\" Belle snapped. \"Study me all you\nplease, but keep the notes in your notebook. I'd suggest you study\nClee.\"\n\n\"Oh, I have been. He baffles me, too. I'm not very good yet, you....\"\n\n\"That's the unders....\"\n\n\"_Cut_ it!\" Garlock ordered, sharply. \"I said we had work to do. Jim,\nyou're hunting up the nearest observatory.\"\n\n\"How about transportation? No teleportation?\"\n\n\"Out. Rent a car or hire a plane, or both. Fill your wallet--better have\ntoo much money than not enough. If you're too far away tonight to make\nit feasible to come back here, send me a flash. Brownie, you'll work\nthis town first. Belle and I will have to work in the library for a\nwhile. We'll all want to compare notes tonight....\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" James said into the pause, \"I could tune in remote, but I don't\nknow where I'll be, so it might not be so good.\"\n\n\"Check. You can 'port, but be _damn_ sure nobody sees or senses you\ndoing it. That buttons it up, I guess.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nJames and Lola left the ship; Garlock and Belle went into the library.\n\n\"If I didn't know you were impotent, Clee,\" Belle shivered affectedly\nand began to laugh, \"I'd be scared to death to be alone with you in this\ngreat big spaceship. Lola hasn't realized yet what she really hatched\nout--the screamingest screamer ever pulled on anybody!\"\n\n\"It isn't _that_ funny. You have got a savage sense of humor.\"\n\n\"Perhaps.\" She shrugged her shoulders. \"But you were on the receiving\nend, which makes a big difference. She's a peculiar sort of duck.\nBrainy, but impersonal--academic. She knows all the words and all their\nmeanings, all the questions and all the answers, but she doesn't apply\nany of them to herself. She's always the observer, never the\nparticipant. Pure egg-head ... pure? _That's_ it. She looks, acts,\ntalks, and thinks like a _virgin_.... Well, if that's all, she isn't\nany--or is she? Even though you've started calling her 'Brownie,' like\nmy now-tamed tomcat, you might not....\" She stared at him.\n\n\"Go ahead. Probe.\"\n\n\"Why waste energy trying to crack a Prime's shield? But just out of\ncuriosity, are you two pairing, or not?\"\n\n\"Tut-tut; don't be inurbane. Let's talk about Jim instead. I thought\nhe'd be gibbering.\"\n\n\"No, I'm working under double wraps--full dampers. I don't want him in\nlove with me. You want to know why?\"\n\n\"I think I know why.\"\n\n\"Because having him mooning around underfoot would weaken the team and I\nwant to get back to Tellus.\"\n\n\"I was wrong, then. I thought you were out after bigger game.\"\n\nBelle's face went stiff and still. \"What do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"Plain enough, I would think. Wherever you are, you've got to be the\nBoss. You've never been in any kind of a party for fifteen minutes\nwithout taking it over. When you snap the whip everybody jumps--or\nelse--and you swing a wicked knife. For your information I don't jump, I\nam familiar with knives, and you will never run this project or any part\nof it.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nBelle's face set; her eyes hardened. \"While we're putting out\ninformation, take note that I'm just as good with actual knives as with\nfigurative ones. If you're still thinking of blistering my fanny, don't\ntry it. You'll find a rawhide haft sticking up out of one of those\nmuscles you're so proud of--clear enough Mr. Garlock.\"\n\n\"Why don't you talk sense, instead of such yak-yak?\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"I know you're a Prime, too, but don't let it go to your head. I've got\nmore stuff than you have, so you can't Gunther me. You weigh one\nthirty-five to my two seventeen. I'm harder, stronger, and faster than\nyou are. You're probably a bit limberer--not too much--but I've\nforgotten more judo than you ever will know. So what's the answer?\"\n\nBelle was breathing hard. \"Then why don't you do it right now?\"\n\n\"Several reasons. I couldn't brag much about licking anybody I outweigh\nby eighty-two pounds. I can't figure out your logic--if any--but I'm\npretty sure now it wouldn't do either of us any good. Just the\nopposite.\"\n\n\"From your standpoint, would that be bad?\"\n\n\"What a _hell_ of a logic! You have got the finest brain of any woman\nliving. You're stronger than Jim is by a lot more than the\nPrime-to-Operator ratio--you've got more initiative, more drive, more\nguts. You know as well as I do what your brain may mean before we get\nback. Why in all hell don't you start _using_ it?\"\n\n\"_You_ are complimenting _me_?\"\n\n\"No. It's the truth, isn't it?\"\n\n\"What difference does that make? Clee Garlock, I simply can't understand\nyou at all.\"\n\n\"That makes it mutual. I can't understand a geometry in which the\ncrookedest line between any two given points is the best line. Let's get\nto work, shall we?\"\n\n\"Uh-huh, let's. One more bit of information, though, first. Any such\nidea as taking the Project away from you simply _never_ entered my\nmind!\" She gave him a warm and friendly smile as she walked over to the\nfile-cabinets.\n\nFor hours, then, they worked; each scanning tape after tape. At mid-day\nthey ate a light lunch. Shortly thereafter, Garlock put away his reader\nand all his loose tapes. \"Are you getting anywhere, Belle? I'm not\nmaking any progress.\"\n\n\"Yes, but of course planets are probably pretty much the same\neverywhere--Tellus-type ones, I mean, of course. Is all the Xenology as\ncockeyed as I'm afraid it must be?\"\n\n\"Check. The one basic assumption was that there are no human beings\nother than Tellurians. From that they derive the secondary assumption\nthat humanoid types will be scarce. From there they scatter out in all\ndirections. So I'll have to roll my own. I've got to see Atterlin,\nanyway. I'll be back for supper. So long.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nAt the Port Office, Grand Lady Neldine met him even more\nenthusiastically than before; taking both his hands and pressing them\nagainst her firm, almost-bare breasts. She tried to hold back as Garlock\nled her along the corridor.\n\n\"I have an explanation, and in a sense an apology, for you, Grand Lady\nNeldine, and for you, Governor Atterlin,\" he thought carefully. \"I would\nhave explained yesterday, but I had no understanding of the situation\nhere until our anthropologist, Lola Montandon, elucidated it very\nlaboriously to me. She herself, a scientist highly trained in that\nspecialty, could grasp it only by referring back to somewhat similar\nsituations which may have existed in the remote past--so remote a past\nthat the concept is known only to specialists and is more than half\nmythical, even to them.\"\n\nHe went on to give in detail the sexual customs, obligations, and\nlimitations of Lola's purely imaginary civilization.\n\n\"Then it isn't that you don't want to, but you _can't_?\" the lady asked,\nincredulously.\n\n\"Mentally, I can have no desire. Physically, the act is impossible,\" he\nassured her.\n\n\"What a shame!\" Her thought was a peculiar mixture of disappointment and\nrelief: disappointment in that she was not to bear this man's\nsuper-child; relief in that, after all, she had not personally\nfailed--if she couldn't have this perfectly wonderful man herself, no\nother woman except his wife could ever have him, either. But what a\nshame to waste such a man as that on _any_ one woman! It was really too\nbad.\n\n\"I see ... I see--wonderful!\" Atterlin's thought was not at all\nincredulous, but vastly awed. \"It is of course logical that as the power\nof mind increases, physical matters become less and less important. But\nyou will have much to give us; we may perhaps have some small things to\ngive you. If we could visit your Tellus, perhaps...?\"\n\n\"That also is impossible. We four in the _Pleiades_ are lost in space.\nThis is the first planet we have visited on our first trial of a new\nmethod--new to us, at least--of interstellar travel. We missed our\nobjective, probably by many millions of parsecs, and it is quite\npossible that we four will never be able to find our way back. We are\ntrying now, by charting the galaxies throughout billions of cubic\nparsecs of space, to find merely the direction in which our own galaxy\nlies.\"\n\n\"What a concept! What stupendous minds! But such immense distances, sir\n... what can you possibly be using for a space-drive?\"\n\n\"None, as you understand the term. We travel by instantaneous\ntranslation, by means of something we call 'Gunther'.... I am not at all\nsure that I can explain it to you satisfactorily, but I will try to do\nso, if you wish.\"\n\n\"Please do so, sir, by all means.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nGarlock opened the highest Gunther cells of his mind. There was nothing\nas elementary as telepathy, teleportation, telekinesis, or the like; it\nwas the pure, raw Gunther of the Gunther Drive, which even he himself\nmade no pretense of understanding fully. He opened those cells and\npushed that knowledge at the two Hodellian minds.\n\nThe result was just as instantaneous and just as catastrophic as Garlock\nhad expected. Both blocks went up almost instantly.\n\n\"Oh, no!\" Atterlin exclaimed, his face turning white.\n\nThe girl shrieked once, covered her face with her hands, and collapsed\non the floor.\n\n\"Oh, I'm _so_ sorry ... excuse my ignorance, please!\" Garlock implored,\nas he picked the girl up, carried her across the room to a sofa, and\nassured himself that she had not been really hurt. She recovered\nquickly. \"I'm very sorry, Grand Lady Neldine and Governor Atterlin, but\nI didn't know ... that is, I didn't realize....\"\n\n\"You are trying to break it gently.\" Atterlin was both shocked and\ndespondent. \"This being the first planet you have visited, you simply\ndid not realize how feeble our minds really are.\"\n\n\"Oh, not at all, really, sir and lady.\" Garlock began deftly to repair\nthe morale he had shattered. \"Merely younger. With your system of\ngenetics, so much more logical and efficient than our strict monogamy,\nyour race will undoubtedly make more progress in a few centuries than we\nmade in many millennia. And in a few centuries more you will pass\nus--will master this only partially-known Gunther Drive.\n\n\"Esthetically, Lady Neldine, I would like very much to father you a\nchild.\" He allowed his coldly unmoved gaze to survey her charms. \"I am\nsorry indeed that it cannot be. I trust that you, Governor Atterlin,\nwill be kind enough to spread word of our physical shortcomings, and so\nspare us further embarrassment?\"\n\n\"Not shortcomings, sir, and, I truly hope, no embarrassment,\" Atterlin\nprotested. \"We are immensely glad to have seen you, since your very\nexistence gives us so much hope for the future. I will spread word, and\nevery Hodellian will do whatever he can to help you in your quest.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir and lady,\" and Garlock took his leave.\n\n\"What an act, my male-looking but impotent darling!\" came Belle's clear,\nincisive thought, bubbling with unrestrained merriment. \"For our Doctor\nGarlock, the Prime Exponent and First Disciple of Truth, _what_ an act!\n_Esthetically_, he'd like to father her a child, it says here in fine\nprint--Boy, if she only knew! One tiny grain of truth and she'd chase\nyou from here to Andromeda! Clee, I _swear_ this thing is going to kill\nme yet!\"\n\n\"Anything that would do that I'm very much in favor of!\" Garlock growled\nthe thought and snapped up his shield.\n\nThis one was, quite definitely, Belle's round.\n\n        *           *           *\n\nGarlock took the Hodellian equivalent of a bus to the center of the\ncity, then set out aimlessly to walk. The buildings and their\narrangement, he noted--not much to his surprise now--were not too\ndifferent from those of the cities of Earth.\n\nWith his guard down to about the sixth level, highly receptive but not\nat all selective, he strolled up one street and down another. He was not\nattentive to detail yet; he was trying to get the broad aspects, the\n\"feel\" of this hitherto unknown civilization.\n\nThe ether was practically saturated with thought. Apparently this was\nthe afternoon rush hour, as the sidewalks were crowded with people and\nthe streets were full of cars. It did not seem as though anyone, whether\nin the buildings, on the sidewalks, or in the cars, was doing any\nblocking at all. If there were any such things as secrets on Hodell,\nthey were scarce. Each person, man, woman, or child, went about his own\nbusiness, radiating full blast. No one paid any attention to the\nthoughts of anyone else except in the case of couples or groups, the\nunits of which were engaged in conversation. It reminded Garlock of a\nbig Tellurian party when the punch-bowls were running low--everybody\ntalking at the top of his voice and nobody listening.\n\nThis whole gale of thought was blowing over Garlock's receptors like a\nGreat Plains wind over miles-wide fields of corn. He did not address\nanyone directly; no one addressed him. At first, quite a few young\nwomen, at sight of his unusual physique, had sent out tentative feelers\nof thought; and some men had wondered, in the same tentative and\nindirect fashion, who he was and where he came from. However, when the\ninformation he had given Atterlin spread throughout the city--and it did\nnot take long--no one paid any more attention to him than they did to\neach other.\n\nProbing into and through various buildings, he learned that groups of\npeople were quitting work at intervals of about fifteen minutes. There\nwere thoughts of tidying up desks; of letting the rest of this junk go\nuntil tomorrow; of putting away and/or covering up office machines of\nvarious sorts. There were thoughts of powdering noses and of repairing\nmake-up.\n\nHe pulled in his receptors and scanned the crowded ways for\nguardians--he'd have to call them that until either he or Lola found out\ntheir real name. Same as at the airport--the more people, the more\nguardians. What were they? How? And why?\n\n        *           *           *\n\nHe probed; carefully but thoroughly. When he had talked to the Arpalone\nhe had read him easily enough, but here there was nothing whatever to\nread. The creature simply was not thinking at all. But that didn't make\nsense! Garlock tuned, first down, then up; and finally, at the very top\nof his range, he found something, but he did not at first know what it\nwas. It seemed to be a mass-detector ... no, two of them, paired and\nbalanced. Oh, that was it! One tuned to humanity, one to the other\nguardians--balanced across a sort of bridge--_that_ was how they kept\nthe ratio so constant! But why? There seemed to be some wide-range\nreceptors there, too, but nothing seemed to be coming in....\n\nWhile he was still studying and still baffled, some kind of stimulus,\nwhich was so high and so faint and so alien that he could neither\nidentify nor interpret it, touched the Arpalone's far-flung receptors.\nInstantly the creature jumped, his powerful, widely-bowed legs sending\nhim high above the heads of the crowd and, it seemed to Garlock,\ndirectly toward him. Simultaneously there was an insistent, low-pitched,\nwhistling scream, somewhat like the noise made by an airplane in a\nno-power dive; and Garlock saw, out of the corner of one eye, a\nyellowish something flashing downward through the air.\n\nAt the same moment the woman immediately in front of Garlock stifled a\nscream and jumped backward, bumping into him and almost knocking him\ndown. He staggered, caught his balance, and automatically put his arm\naround his assailant, to keep her from falling to the sidewalk.\n\n        *           *           *\n\nIn the meantime the guardian, having landed very close to the spot the\nwoman had occupied a moment before, leaped again; this time vertically\nupward. The thing, whatever it was, was now braking frantically with\nwings, tail, and body; trying madly to get away. Too late. There was a\nbone-crushing impact as the two bodies came together in mid-air; a\njarring thud as the two creatures, inextricably intertwined, struck the\npavement as one.\n\nThe thing varied in color, Garlock now saw, shading from bright orange\nat the head to pale yellow at the tail. It had a savagely-tearing curved\nbeak; tremendously powerful wings; its short, thick legs ended in\nhawk-like talons.\n\nThe guardian's bowed legs had already immobilized the yellow wings by\nclamping them solidly against the yellow body. His two lower arms were\nholding the frightful talons out of action. His third hand gripped the\norange throat, his fourth was exerting tremendous force against the\njointure of neck and body. The neck, originally short, was beginning to\nstretch.\n\nFor several seconds Garlock had been half-conscious that his accidental\ncompanion was trying, with more and more energy, to disengage his\nencircling left arm from her waist. He wrenched his attention away from\nthe spectacular fight--to which no one else, not even the near-victim,\nhad paid the slightest attention--and now saw that he had his arm around\nthe bare waist of a statuesque matron whose entire costume would have\nmade perhaps half of a Tellurian sun-suit. He dropped his arm with a\nquick and abject apology.\n\n\"I should apologize to you instead, Captain Garlock,\" she thought, with\na wide and friendly smile, \"for knocking you down, and I thank you for\ncatching me before I fell. I should not have been startled, of course. I\nwould not have been, except that this is the first time that I,\npersonally, have been attacked.\"\n\n\"But what _are_ they?\" Garlock blurted.\n\n\"I don't know.\" The woman turned her head and glanced, in complete\ndisinterest, at the two furiously-battling creatures. Garlock knew now\nthat this was the first time, except for that instantly-dismissed thrill\nof surprise at being the actual target of an attack, that she had\nthought of either of them. \"Orange-yellow? It could be a ... a fumapty,\nperhaps, but I've no idea, really. You see, such things are none of our\nbusiness.\"\n\nShe thought at him, a half-shrug, half-grimace of mild distaste--not at\nthe personal contact with the man nor at the savage duel; but at even\nthinking of either the guardian or the yellow monster--and walked away\ninto the crowd.\n\nGarlock's attention flashed back to the fighters. The yellow thing's\nneck had been stretched to twice its natural length and the guardian had\n_eaten_ almost through it. There was a terrific crunch, a couple of\nsmacking, gobbling swallows, and head parted from body. The orange beak\nstill clashed open and shut, however, and the body still thrashed\nviolently.\n\nShifting his grips, the guardian proceeded to tear a hole into his\nvictim's body, just below its breast-bone. Thrusting two arms into the\nopening, he yanked out two organs--one of which, Garlock thought, could\nhave been the heart--and ate them both; if not with extreme gusto, at\nleast in a workmanlike and thoroughly competent fashion. He then picked\nup the head in one hand, grabbed the tip of a wing with another, and\nmarched up the street for half a block, dragging the body behind him.\n\nHe lifted a manhole cover with his two unoccupied hands, dropped the\nremains down the hole thus exposed, and let the cover slam back into\nplace. He then squatted down, licked himself meticulously clean with a\nlong, black, extremely agile tongue, and went on about his enigmatic\nbusiness quite as though nothing had happened.\n\nGarlock strolled around a few minutes longer, but could not recapture\nany interest in the doings of the human beings around him. He had filed\naway every detail of what had just happened, and it had so many bizarre\naspects that he could not think of anything else. Wherefore he flagged\ndown a \"taxi\" and was taken out to the _Pleiades_. Belle and Lola were\nin the Main.\n\n        *           *           *\n\n\"I saw the _damndest_ thing, Clee!\" Lola exclaimed. \"I've been gnawing\nmy fingernails off up to the knuckles, waiting for you!\"\n\nLola's experience had been very similar to Garlock's own, except in that\nher monster was an intense green in color and looked something like a\nbat about four feet long, with six-inch canine teeth and several\nstingers....\n\n\"Did you find out the name of the thing?\" Garlock asked.\n\n\"No. I asked half-a-dozen people, but nobody would even listen to me\nexcept one half-grown boy, and the best he could do was that it might be\nsomething he had heard another boy say somebody had told him might be a\n'lemart.' And as to those lower-case Arpalones, the best I could dig out\nof anybody was just 'guardians.' Did you do any better?\"\n\n\"No, I didn't do as well,\" and he told the girls about his own\nexperience.\n\n\"But I didn't find any detectors or receptors, Clee,\" Lola frowned.\n\"Where were they?\"\n\n\"'Way up--up here,\" he showed her. \"I'll make a full tape tonight on\neverything I found out about the guardians and the Arpalones--besides my\nregular report, I mean--since they're yours, and you can make me one\nabout your friend the green bat....\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\n\"Hey, I _like_ that!\" Belle broke in. \"That _could_ be taken amiss, you\nknow, by such a sensitive soul as I!\"\n\n\"Check.\" Garlock chuckled. \"I'll have to file that one, in case I want\nto use it sometime. How're you coming, Belle?\"\n\n\"Nice!\" Belle's voracious mind had been so busy absorbing new\nknowledge that she had temporarily forgotten about her fight with\nher captain. \"I'm just about done here. I'll be ready tomorrow, I\nthink, to visit their library and tape up some planetological and\nplanetographical--notice how insouciantly I toss off those two-credit\nwords?--data on this here planet Hodell.\"\n\n\"Good going. You've been listening to this stuff Lola and I were chewing\non--does any of it make sense to you?\"\n\n\"It does not. I never heard anything to compare with it.\"\n\n\"Excuse me for changing the subject,\" Lola put in, plaintively, \"but\nwhen, if ever, do we eat? Do we _have_ to wait until that confounded\nJames boy gets back from wherever it was he went?\"\n\n\"If you're hungry, we'll eat now.\"\n\n\"_Hungry?_ Look!\" Lola turned herself sidewise, placed one hand in the\nsmall of her back, and pressed hard with the other her flat, taut belly.\n\"See? Only a couple of inches from belt-buckle to backbone--dangerously\nclose to the point of utter collapse.\"\n\n\"You poor, abused little thing!\" Garlock laughed and all three crossed\nthe room to the dining alcove. While they were still ordering, James\nappeared beside them.\n\n\"Find out anything?\" Garlock asked.\n\n\"Yes and no. Yes, in that they have an excellent observatory, with a\nhundred-eighty-inch reflector, on a mountain only seventy-five miles\nfrom here. No, in that I didn't find any duplication of nebulary\nconfigurations with the stuff I had with me. However, it was relatively\ncoarse. Tomorrow I'll take a lot of fine stuff along. It'll take some\ntime--a full day, at least.\"\n\n\"I expected that. Good going, Jim!\"\n\nAll four ate heartily, and, after eating, they taped up the day's\nreports. Then, tired from their first real day's work in weeks, all went\nto their rooms.\n\n        *           *           *\n\nA few minutes later, Garlock tapped lightly at Lola's door.\n\n\"Come in.\" She stiffened involuntarily, then relaxed and smiled. \"Oh,\nyes, Clee: of course. You're....\"\n\n\"No, I'm not. I've been doing a lot of thinking about you since last\nnight, and I may have come up with an answer or two. Also, Belle knows\nwe aren't pairing, and if we don't hide behind a screen at least once in\na while, she'll know we aren't going to.\"\n\n\"Screen?\"\n\n\"Screen. Didn't you know these four private rooms are solid? Haven't you\nread your house-tape yet?\"\n\n\"No. But do you think Belle would actually peek?\"\n\n\"Do you think she wouldn't?\"\n\n\"Well, I don't like her very much, but I wouldn't think she would do\nanything like that, Clee. It isn't urbane.\"\n\n\"She isn't urbane, either, whenever she thinks it might be advantageous\nnot to be.\"\n\n\"What a _terrible_ thing to say!\"\n\n\"Take it from me, if Belle Bellamy doesn't know everything that goes on\nit isn't from lack of trying. You wouldn't know about room service,\neither, then--better scan that tape before you go to sleep\ntonight--what'll you have in the line of a drink to while away enough\ntime so she will know we've been playing games?\"\n\n\"Ginger ale, please.\"\n\n\"I'll have ginger beer. You do it like so.\" He slid a panel aside, his\nfingers played briefly on a typewriter-like keyboard. Drinks and ice\nappeared. \"Anything you want--details of the tape.\"\n\nHe lighted two cigarettes, handed her one, stirred his drink. \"Now, fair\nlady--or should I say beauteous dark lady?--we will follow the precept\nof that immortal Chinese philosopher, Chin On.\"\n\n\"You _are_ a Prime Operator, aren't you?\" She laughed, but sobered\nquickly. \"I'm worried. You said I flaunted virginity like a banner, and\nnow Belle.... What am I doing wrong?\"\n\n\"There's a lot wrong. Not so much what you're doing as what you aren't\ndoing. You're too aloof--detached--egg-headish. You know the score,\nwords and music, but you don't sing. All you do is listen. Belle thinks\nyou're not only a physical virgin, but a psychic-blocked prude. I know\nbetter. You're so full of conflict between what you want to do--what you\nknow is right--and what those three-cell-brained nincompoops made you\nthink you ought to do that you have got no more degrees of freedom than\na piston-rod. You haven't been yourself for a minute since you came\naboard. Check?\"\n\n\"You _have_ been thinking, haven't you? You may be right; except that\nit's been longer than that ... ever since the first preliminaries, I\nthink. But what can I _do_ about it, Clee?\"\n\n\"Contact. Three-quarters full, say; enough for me to give you what I\nthink is the truth.\"\n\n\"But you said you _never_ went screens down with a woman?\"\n\n\"There's a first time for everything. Come in.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nShe did so, held contact for almost a minute, then pulled herself loose.\n\n\"Ug-gh-gh.\" She shivered. \"I'm glad I haven't got a mind like that.\"\n\n\"And the same from me to you. Of course the real truth may lie somewhere\nin between. I may be as far off the beam on one side as you are on the\nother.\"\n\n\"I hope so. But it cleared things up no end--it untied a million knots.\nEven that other thing--brotherly love? It's a very nice concept--you\nsee, I never had any brothers.\"\n\n\"That's probably one thing that was the matter with you. Nothing warmer\nthan that, certainly, and never will be.\"\n\n\"And I suppose you got the thought--it must have jumped up and smacked\nyou--\" Lola's hot blush was visible even through her heavy tan, \"how\nmany times I've felt like running my fingers up and down your ribs and\ngrabbing a handful of those terrific muscles of yours, just to see if\nthey're as hard as they look?\"\n\n\"I'm glad you brought that up; I don't know whether I would have dared\nto or not. You've got to stop acting like a Third instead of an\nOperator; and you've got to stop acting as though you had never been\nwithin ten feet of me. Now's as good a time as any.\" He took off his\nshirt and struck a strong-man's pose. \"Come ahead.\"\n\n\"By golly, I'm _going_ to!\" Then, a moment later, \"Why, they're even\n_harder_! How do you, a scientist, psionicist, and scholar, keep in such\nhard shape as that?\"\n\n\"An hour a day in the gym, three hundred sixty-five days a year. Many\nare better--but a hell of a lot are worse.\"\n\n\"I'll say.\" She finished her ginger ale, sat down in her chair, leaned\nback and put her legs up on the bed. \"That was a relief of tension if\nthere ever was one. I haven't felt so good since they picked me as\nhome-town candidate--and that was a mighty small town and eight months\nago. Bring on your dragons, Clee, and I'll slay 'em far and wide. But I\ncan't actually _be_ like she is....\"\n\n\"Thank God for that. Deliver me from _two_ such pretzel-benders aboard\none ship.\"\n\n\"... but I could have been a pretty good actress, I think.\"\n\n\"Correction, please. 'Outstanding' is the word.\"\n\n\"Thank you, kind sir. And women--men, too, of course--do bring up\ncertain memories, to ... to....\"\n\n\"To roll 'em around on their tongues and give their taste-buds a treat.\"\n\n\"Exactly. So where I don't have any appropriate actual memories to bring\nup, I'll make like an actress. Check?\"\n\n\"Good girl! Now you're rolling--we're in like Flynn. Well, we've been in\nscreen long enough, I guess. Fare thee well, little sister Brownie,\nuntil we meet again.\" He tossed the remains of their refreshments, trays\nand all, into the chute, picked up his shirt, and started out.\n\n\"Put it _on_, Clee!\" she whispered, intensely.\n\n\"Why?\" He grinned cheerfully. \"It'd look still better if I peeled down\nto the altogether.\"\n\n\"You're incorrigible,\" she said, but her answering grin was wide and\nperfectly natural. \"You know, if I had had a brother something like you\nit would have saved me a lot of wear and tear. I'll see you in the\nmorning before breakfast.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nAnd she did. They strolled together to breakfast; not holding hands, but\nwith hip almost touching hip. Relaxed, friendly, on very cordial and\nsatisfactory terms. Lola punched breakfast orders for them both. Belle\ndrove a probe, which bounced--Lola's screen was tight, although her\nbrown eyes were innocent and bland.\n\nBut during the meal, in response to a double-edged, wickedly-barbed\nremark of Belle's, a memory flashed into being above Lola's shield. It\nwas the veriest flash, instantly suppressed. Her eyes held clear and\nsteady; if she blushed at all it did not show.\n\nBelle caught it, of course, and winked triumphantly at Garlock.\nShe knew, now, what she had wanted to know. And, Prime Operator\nthough he was, it was all he could do to make no sign; for that\nfleetingly-revealed memory was a perfect job. He would not have--_could_\nnot have--questioned it himself, except for one highly startling fact.\nIt was of an event that had not happened and never would!\n\nAnd after breakfast, at some distance from the others, \"That is my girl,\nBrownie! You're firing on all forty barrels. You're an Operator, all\nright; and it takes a damn good one to lie like that with her mind!\"\n\n\"Thanks to you, Clee. And thanks a million, really. I'm me again--I\nthink.\"\n\nThen, since Belle was looking, she took him by both ears, pulled his\nhead down, and kissed him lightly on the lips. The spontaneity and\ntenderness were perfect at that moment. Clee's appreciation was obvious.\n\n\"I know I said you'd have to kiss me next time,\" Lola said, very low,\n\"but this act needs just this much of an extra touch. Anyway, such\nlittle, tiny, sisterly ones as this, and out in public, don't count.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\n\nLola and Garlock went to town in the same taxi. As they were about to\nseparate, Garlock said:\n\n\"I don't like those hell-divers, yellow, green, or any other color; and\nyou, Brownie, are very definitely not expendable. Are you any good at\nmind-bombing?\"\n\n\"Why, I never heard of such a thing.\"\n\n\"You isolate a little energy in the Op field, remembering of course,\nthat you're handling a hundred thousand gunts. Transpose it into\nplatinum or uranium--anything good and heavy. For one of these monsters\nyou'd need two or three micrograms. For a battleship, up to maybe a gram\nor so. 'Port it to the exact place you want it to detonate. Reconvert\nand release instantaneously. One-hundred-percent-conversion atomic bomb,\ntailored exactly to fit the job. Very effective.\"\n\n\"It would be. My God, Clee, can _you_ do _that_?\"\n\n\"Sure--so can you. Any Operator can.\"\n\n\"Well, I _won't_. I _never_ will. Besides, I'd probably kill too many\npeople, besides the monster. No, I'll 'port back to the Main if anything\nattacks me. I'm chain lightning at that.\"\n\n\"Do that, then. And if anything very unusual happens give me a flash.\"\n\n\"I'll do that. 'Bye, Clee.\" She turned to the left. He walked straight\non, toward the business center, to resume his study at the point where\nhe had left off the evening before.\n\nFor over an hour he wandered aimlessly about the city; receiving,\nclassifying, and filing away information. He saw several duels between\nguardians and yellow and green-bat monsters, to none of which he paid\nany more attention than did the people around him. Then a third kind of\nenemy appeared--two of them at once, flying wing-and-wing--and Garlock\nstopped and watched.\n\nVivid, clear-cut stripes of red and black, even on the tremendously\nlong, strong wings. Distinctly feline as to heads, teeth, and claws.\nWhile they did not at all closely resemble flying saber-toothed tigers,\nthat was the first impression that leaped into Garlock's mind.\n\nTwo bow-legged guardians came leaping as usual, but one of them was a\nfraction of a second too late. That fraction was enough. While the first\nguardian was still high in air, grappling with one tiger, the other\nswung on a dime--the blast of air from his right wing blowing people in\nthe crowd below thither and yon and knocking four of them flat--and took\nthe guardian's head off his body with one savage swipe of a\nfrightfully-armed paw. Disregarding the carcass both attackers whirled\nsharply at the second guardian, meeting him in such fashion that he\ncould not come to firm grips with either of them, and that battle was\nvery brief indeed. More and more guardians were leaping in from all\ndirections, however, and the two tigers were forced to the ground and\nslaughtered.\n\nSince six guardians had been killed, eight guardians marched up the\nstreet, dragging grisly loads. Eight bodies, friend and foe alike, were\ndumped into a manhole; eight creatures squatted down and cleaned\nthemselves meticulously before resuming their various patrols.\n\n        *           *           *\n\nTen or fifteen minutes later, Garlock felt Lola's half-excited,\nhalf-frightened thought. \"Clee, do you read me?\"\n\n\"Loud and clear.\"\n\n\"There's something coming that's certainly none of my business--maybe\nnot even yours.\"\n\n\"Coming,\" and with the thought he was there. \"Where?\"\n\nShe pointed a thought, he followed it. Far away yet, but coming fast,\nwas an immense flock of flying tigers!\n\nLola licked her lips. \"I'm going home, if you don't mind.\"\n\n\"Beat it.\"\n\nShe disappeared.\n\n\"Jim!\" Garlock thought. \"Where are you?\"\n\n\"Observatory. Need me?\"\n\n\"Yes. Bombing. Two point four microgram loads. Focus spot on my\nright--teleport in.\"\n\n\"Coming in on your right.\"\n\n\"And I on your left!\" Belle's thought drove in as he had never before\nfelt it driven. Being a Prime, she did not need a focus spot and\nappeared the veriest instant later than did James.\n\n\"Can you bomb?\" Garlock snapped.\n\n\"What do _you_ think?\" she snapped back.\n\nA moment of flashing thought and the three Tellurians disappeared,\nmaterializing five hundred feet in air, two hundred feet ahead of the\nvan of that horrible flight of monsters, drifting before it.\n\nBelle got in the first shot. Not only did the victim disappear--a couple\nof dozen around it were torn to fragments and the force of the blast\nstaggered all three Tellurians.\n\n\"Damn it, Belle, cut down or get to hell out!\" Garlock yelped. \"I said\ntwo point four _micrograms_, not milligrams. Just kill 'em, don't\nscatter 'em all over hell's half acre--less mess to clean up and I\n_don't_ want you to kill people down below. Especially I don't want you\nto kill us--not even yourself.\"\n\n\"'Scuse, please, I guess I was a bit enthusiastic in my weighing.\"\n\nThere began a series of muffled explosions along the front; each\nfollowed by the plunge of a tiger-striped body to the ground. Faster and\nfaster the explosions came as the Operator and the Primes learned the\nroutine and the rhythm of the job.\n\nNor were they long alone. The roaring, screaming howl of jets came up\nfrom behind them; four Arpalones appeared at their left, strung out\nalong the front. Each held an extraordinarily heavy-duty blaster in each\nof his four hands; sixteen terrific weapons were hurling death into the\nflying horde.\n\n\"Slide over, Terrestrials,\" came a calm thought. \"You three take their\nleft front, we'll take their right and center.\"\n\nAs they obeyed the instructions, \"_They_ don't give a damn where the\npieces fly!\" Belle protested. \"Why should we be fussy about their\nstreet-cleaning department? _I'm_ starting to use fives.\"\n\n\"Okay. We'll have to hit 'em harder, anyway, to keep up. Five or maybe\nsix--just be damn sure not to knock us or the Arpalones out of the air.\"\n\nCarnage went on. The battle-front, while inside the city limits, was now\nalmost stationary.\n\n\"Ha! Help--I hear footsteps approaching on jet-back,\" Garlock announced.\n\"Give 'em hell, boys--shovel on the coal!\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nA flight of fighter-planes, eight abreast and wing-tips almost touching,\nhowled close overhead and along the line of invasion. They could not\nfire, of course, until they reached the city limits. There they opened\nup as one, and the air below became literally filled with falling\nmonsters. Some had only broken wings; some were dead, but more or less\nwhole; many were blown to unrecognizable bits and scraps of flesh.\n\nAnother flight screamed into place immediately behind the first; then\nanother and another and another until six flights had passed. Then came\nfour helicopters, darting and hovering, whose gunners picked off\nindividually whatever survivors had managed to escape all six waves of\nfighters.\n\n\"That's better,\" came a thought from the Arpalone nearest Garlock.\n\"Situation under control, thanks to you Tellurians. Supposed to be two\nsquads of us gunners, but the other squad was busy on another job.\nWithout you, this could have developed into a fairly nasty little\ninfection. I don't know what you're doing or how you're doing it--we\nwere told that you weren't like any other humans, and how true _that_\nis--but I'm in favor of it. I thought there were four of you?\"\n\n\"One of us is not a fighter.\"\n\n\"Oh. You can knock off now, if you like. We'll polish off. Thanks much.\"\n\n\"But don't the boys on the ground need some help?\"\n\n\"The Arpales? Those idiots you have been thinking of as 'guardians'?\nWhich they are, of course. Uh-uh. Besides, we're air-fighters. Ground\nwork is none of our business. Also, these guns would raise altogether\ntoo much hell down there. Bound to hit some humans.\"\n\n\"Check. Those Arpales aren't very intelligent, you Arpalones are\nextremely so. Any connection?\"\n\n\"'Way back, they say. Common ancestry, and doing two parts of the same\njob. Killing these fumapties and lemarts and sencors and what-have-you.\nI don't know what humanity's job is and don't give a damn. Probably\nfairly important, some way or other, though, since it's our job to see\nthat the silly, gutless things keep on living. We have nothing to do\nwith 'em, ever. The only reason I'm talking to you is you're not really\nhuman at all. You're a fighter, too, and a damn good one.\"\n\n\"I know what you mean,\" and the three Tellurians turned their attention\ndownward to the scene on the ground.\n\n        *           *           *\n\nThe heaviest fighting had been over a large park at the city's edge,\nwhich was now literally a shambles. Very few people were to be seen, and\nthose few more moving unconcernedly away from the center of violence.\nAll over the park thousands of Arpales were fighting furiously and\nhundreds of them were dying. For hundreds of the sencors had suffered\nonly wing injuries, the long fall to ground had not harmed them further,\nand their tremendous fighting ability had been lessened very little if\nat all.\n\n\"But I'd think, just for efficiency if nothing else,\" Garlock argued,\n\"you'd support the Arpales _some_ way. Lighter guns or something. Why,\nthousands of them must have been killed, just in this last hour or so.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but that's their business. They breed fast and die fast.\nEverything has to balance, you know.\"\n\n\"Perhaps so.\" Garlock was silenced, if not convinced. \"Well, it's about\nover. What happens to the bodies they're dumping down manholes? They\ncan't go down a sewer that way?\"\n\n\"Oh, you didn't know? Food.\"\n\n\"Food? For what?\"\n\n\"The Arpales and us, of course.\"\n\n\"What? You don't mean--you _can't_ mean that they--and by your thought,\nyou Arpalones, too--are cannibals!\"\n\n\"Cannibals? Explain, please? Oh, eaters-of-our-own-species. Of\ncourse--certainly. Why not?\"\n\n\"Why, self-respect ... common decency ... respect for one's fellow-man\n... family ties....\" Garlock was floundering; to be called upon to\nexplain his ingrained antipathy to such a custom was new to his\nexperience.\n\n\"You are silly. Worse, squeamish. Worst, supremely illogical.\" The\nArpalone paused, then went on as though trying to educate a hopelessly\nillogical inferior, \"While we do not kill Arpales purposely--except when\nthey over-breed--why waste good meat as fertilizer? If a diet is\nwholesome, nutritious, well-balanced, and tasty, what shred of\ndifference can it _possibly_ make what its ingredients once were?\"\n\n\"Well, I'll be damned.\" Garlock quit.\n\nBelle agreed. \"This whole deal makes me sick at the stomach and I think\nmy face is turning green too. But I'm devilishly and gleefully glad,\nClee, that I was here to hear _somebody_ give you cards, spaces, and big\ncasino and still beat the lights and liver out of you at your own game\nof cold-blooded logic!\"\n\n\"We gunners must go now. Would you like to come along with us and see\nthe end of this particular breeding-hole of sencors?\"\n\nAt high speed the seven flew back along the line of advance of the\nflying-tiger horde; across a barren valley, toward and to the side of a\nmountain.\n\n        *           *           *\n\nAn area almost a mile square of that mountain's side was a burned,\nblasted, churned, pocked, cratered and flaming waste; and the four\nhelicopters were still working on it. High-energy beams blasted, fairly\nvolatilizing the ground as they struck in as deep as they could be\ndriven. High-explosive shells bored deep and detonated, hurling\nshattered rock and soil and yellow smoke far and wide; establishing new\ncraters by destroying the ones existing a moment before.\n\nWhile it seemed incredible that any living thing larger than a microbe\ncould emerge under its own power from such a hell of energy, many flying\ntigers did; apparently being blown aloft along with the hitherto\nundisturbed volume of soil in which the creatures had been. Most of them\nwere not fully grown; some were so immature as to be unrecognizable to\nan untrained eye; but from all four helicopters hand-guns snapped and\ncracked. Nothing--but _nothing_--was leaving that field of carnage\nalive.\n\n\"What are you gunners supposed to be doing here?\" Garlock asked.\n\n\"Oh, the 'copters will be leaving pretty soon--they've got other places\nto go. But they won't get them all--some of the hatches are too deep--so\nus four gunners will stick around for two-three days to kill the\nlate-hatchers as they come out.\"\n\n\"I see,\" and Garlock probed. \"There are four cells they won't reach.\nShall I bomb 'em out?\"\n\n\"I'll ask.\" The slitted red eyes widened and he sent a call. \"Commander\nKnahr, can you hop over here a minute? I want you to meet these things\nwe've been hearing about. They look human, but they really aren't.\nThey're killers, with more stuff and more brains than any of us ever\nheard of.\"\n\nAnother Arpalone appeared, indistinguishable to Tellurian eyes from any\none of the others.\n\n\"But why do you want to mix into something that's none of your\nbusiness?\" Knahr was neither officious nor condemnatory. He simply could\nnot understand.\n\n\"Since you have no concept of our quality of curiosity, just call it\neducation. The question is, do or do you not want those four\ndeeply-buried cells blasted out of existence?\"\n\n\"Of course I do.\"\n\n\"Okay. You've got all of 'em you're going to get. Tell your 'copters to\ngive us about five miles clearance, and we'll all fall back, too.\"\n\nThey drew back, and there were four closely-spaced explosions of such\nviolence that one raggedly mushroom-shaped cloud went into the\nstratosphere and one huge, ragged crater yawned where once churned\nground had been.\n\n\"But that's _atomic_!\" Knahr gasped the thought. \"Fall-out!\"\n\n\"No fall-out. Complete conversion. Have you got a counter?\"\n\nThey had. They tested. There was nothing except the usual background\ncount.\n\n\"There's no life left underground, so you needn't keep this squad of\ngunners tied up here,\" Garlock told the commander. \"Before we go, I want\nto ask a question. You have visitors once in a while from other solar\nsystems, so you must have a faster-than-light drive. Can you tell me\nanything about it?\"\n\n\"No. Nothing like that would be any of my business.\" Knahr and the four\ngunners disappeared; the helicopters began to lumber away.\n\n\"Well, _that_ helps--I don't think,\" Garlock thought, glumly. \"_What_ a\nworld! Back to the Main?\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nIn the Main, after a long and fruitless discussion, Garlock called\nGovernor Atterlin, who did not know anything about a faster-than-light\ndrive, either. There was one, of course, since it took only a few days\nor a few weeks to go from one system to another; but Hodell didn't have\nany such ships. No ordinary planet did. They were owned and operated by\npeople who called themselves \"Engineers.\" He had no idea where the\nEngineers came from; they didn't say.\n\nGarlock then tried to get in touch with the Arpalone Inspector who had\nchecked the _Pleiades_ in, and could not find out even who it had been.\nThe Inspector then on duty neither knew or cared anything about either\nfaster-than-light drives or Engineers. Such things were none of his\nbusiness.\n\n\"What difference would it make, anyway?\" James asked. \"No drive that\ntakes 'a few weeks' for an intra-galaxy hop is ever going to get us back\nto Tellus.\"\n\n\"True enough; but if there is such a thing I want to know how it works.\nHow are you coming with your calculations?\"\n\n\"I'll finish up tomorrow easily enough.\"\n\nTomorrow came, and James finished up, but he did not find any familiar\npattern of Galactic arrangement. The other three watched James set up\nfor another try for Earth.\n\n\"You don't think we'll ever get back, do you, Clee?\" Belle asked.\n\n\"Right away, no. Some day, yes. I've got the germ of an idea. Maybe\nthree or four more hops will give me something to work on.\"\n\n\"I hope so,\" James said, \"because here goes nothing,\" and he snapped the\nred switch.\n\n        *           *           *\n\nIt was not nothing. Number Two was another guardian Inspector and\nanother planet very much like Hodell. It proved to be so far from both\nEarth and Hodell, however, that no useful similarities were found in any\ntwo of the three sets of charts.\n\nNumber Three was equally unproductive of helpful results. James did,\nhowever, improve his technique of making galactic charts; and he and\nGarlock designed and built a high-speed comparator. Thus the time\nrequired per stop was reduced from days to hours.\n\nNumber Four produced a surprise. When Garlock touched the knob of the\ntesting-box he yanked his hand away before it had really made contact.\nIt was like touching a high-voltage wire.\n\n\"You are incompatible with our humanity and must not land,\" the\nInspector ruled.\n\n\"Suppose we blast you and your jets out of the air and land anyway?\"\nGarlock asked.\n\n\"That is perhaps possible,\" the Inspector agreed, equably enough. \"We\nare not invincible. However, it would do you no good. If any one of you\nfour leaves that so-heavily-insulated vessel in the atmosphere of this\nplanet you will die. Not quickly, but slowly and with difficulty.\"\n\n\"But you haven't tested _me_!\" Belle said. \"Do you mean they'll attack\nus on sight?\"\n\n\"There is no need to test more than one. Anyone who could live near any\nof you could not live on this planet. Nor will they attack you. Don't\nyou know what the thought 'incompatible' means?\"\n\n\"With us it does not mean death.\"\n\n\"Here it does, since it refers to life forces. The types are mutually,\nirreconcilably antagonistic. Your life forces are very strong. Thus, no\nmatter how peaceable your intentions may be, many of our human beings\nwould die before you would, but you will not live to get back to your\nship if you land it and leave its protective insulation.\"\n\n\"Why? What is it? How does it work?\" Belle demanded.\n\n\"It is not my business to know; only to tell. I have told. You will go\naway now.\"\n\nGarlock's eyes narrowed in concentration. \"Belle, can you blast? I mean,\ncould you if you wanted to?\"\n\n\"Certainly ... why, I don't _want_ to, Clee!\"\n\n\"I don't, either--and I'll file that one away to chew on when I'm hungry\nsome night, too. Take her up, Jim, and try another shot.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nNumbers Five to Nine, inclusive, were neither productive nor eventful.\nAll were, like the others, Hodell all over again, in everything\nfundamental. One was so far advanced that almost all of its humanity\nwere Seconds; one so backward--or so much younger--that its strongest\ntelepaths were only Fours. The Tellurians became acquainted with, and\nupon occasion fought with, various types of man-sized monsters in\naddition to the three varieties they had seen on Hodell.\n\nEvery planet they visited had Arpalones and Arpales. Not by those names,\nof course. Local names for planets, guardians, nations, cities, and\npersons went into the starship's tapes, but that welter of names need\nnot be given here; this is not a catalogue. Every planet they visited\nwas peopled by _Homo Sapiens_; capable of inter-breeding with the\nTellurians and eager to do so--especially with the Tellurian men. Their\nstrict monogamy was really tested more than once; but it held. Each had\nbeen visited repeatedly by starships; but all Garlock could find out\nabout them was that they probably came from a world somewhere that was\ninhabited by compatible human beings of Grade Two. He could learn\nnothing about the faster-than-light drive.\n\nNumber Ten was another queer--the Tellurians were found incompatible.\n\n\"Let's go down anyway.\" Belle suggested. \"Overcome this unwillingness of\nours and find out. What do you think they've got down there, Clee\nGarlock, that could possibly handle you and me both?\"\n\n\"I don't think it's a case of 'handling' at all. I don't know what it\nis, but I believe it's fatal. We won't go down.\"\n\n\"But it doesn't make sense!\" Belle protested.\n\n\"Not yet, no; but it's a datum. Enough data and we'll be able to\nformulate a theory.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\n\"You and your theories! I wish we could get some _facts_!\"\n\n\"You can call that a fact. But I want you and Jim to do some\nmath. We know that we're making mighty long jumps. Assuming that they're\nat perfect random, and of approximately the same length, the probability\nis greater than one-half that we're getting farther and farther away\nfrom Tellus. Is there a jump number, N, at which the probability is\none-half that we land nearer Tellus instead of farther away? My\njump-at-conclusions guess is that there isn't. That the first jump set\nup a bias.\"\n\n\"Ouch. _That_ isn't in any of the books,\" James said. \"In other words,\ndo we or do we not attain a maximum? You're making some bum assumptions;\namong others that space isn't curved and that the dimensions of the\nuniverse are very large compared to the length of our jumps. I'll see if\nI can put it into shape to feed to Compy. You've always held that these\ngenerators work at random--the rest of those assumptions are based on\nyour theory?\"\n\n\"Check. I'm not getting anywhere studying my alleged Xenology, so I'm\ngoing to work full time on designing a generator that will steer.\"\n\n\"You tried to before. So did everybody else.\"\n\n\"I know it, but I've got a lot more data now. And I'm not promising,\njust trying. Okay? Worth a try?\"\n\n\"Sure--I'm in favor of anything that has any chance at all of working.\"\n\nJumping went on; and Garlock, instead of going abroad on the planets,\nstayed in the _Pleiades_ and worked.\n\n        *           *           *\n\nAt Number Forty-three, their reception was of a new kind. They were\ncompatible with the people of this world, but the Inspector advised them\nagainst landing.\n\n\"I do not forbid you,\" he explained, carefully. \"Our humans are about to\ndestroy themselves with fission and fusion bombs. They send missiles,\nwithout warning, against visitors. Thus, the last starship to visit us\nhere disregarded my warning and sent down a sensing device as\nusual--Engineers do not land on non-telepathic worlds, you know--and it\nwas destroyed.\"\n\n\"You're a Guardian of Humanity,\" Garlock said. \"Can't you straighten\npeople out?\"\n\n\"Of course not!\" The Arpalone was outraged. \"We guard humanity against\nincompatibles and non-humans; but it is not our business to interfere\nwith humanity if it wishes to destroy itself. That is its privilege and\nits own business!\"\n\nGarlock probed down. \"No telepathy, even--not even a Seven. This planet\n_is_ backward--back to Year One. And nothing but firecrackers--we're\ngoing down, aren't we?\"\n\n\"I'll say we are!\" Belle said. \"This will break the monotony, at least,\"\nand the others agreed.\n\n\"You won't object, I take it,\" Garlock said to the Inspector, \"if we try\nto straighten them out. We can postpone the blow-up a few years, at\nleast.\"\n\n\"No objections, of course. In fact, I can say that we Guardians of\nHumanity would approve such action.\"\n\nDown the _Pleiades_ went, into the air of the nation known as the\n\"Allied Republican Democracies of the World,\" and an atomic-warheaded\nrocket came flaming up.\n\n\"Hm ... m ... m. Ingenious little gadget, at that,\" James reported,\nafter studying it thoroughly. \"Filthy thing for fall-out, though, if it\ngoes off. Where'll I flip it, Clee? One of their moons?\"\n\n\"Check. Third one out--no chance of any contamination from there.\"\n\nThe missile vanished; and had any astronomer been looking at that\nworld's third and outermost moon at the moment, he might have seen a\ntremendous flash of light, a cloud of dust, and the formation of a new\nand different crater among the hundreds already there.\n\n\"No use waiting for 'em, Jim. All three of you toss everything they've\ngot out onto that same moon, being sure not to hurt anybody--yet. I'll\nstart asking questions.\"\n\nThe captain who had fired the first missile appeared in the Main. He\nreached for his pistol, to find that he did not have one. He tensed his\nmuscles to leap at Garlock, to find that he could not move.\n\nGarlock drove his probe. \"Who is your superior officer?\" and before the\nman could formulate a denial, that superior stood helpless beside him.\n\n        *           *           *\n\nThen three--and four. At the fifth:\n\n\"Oh, you are the man I want. Prime Minister--euphemism for\nDictator--Sovig. Missile launching stations and missile storage? You\ndon't know? Who does?\"\n\nAnother man appeared, and for twenty minutes the _Pleiades_ darted about\nthe continent.\n\n\"Now submarines, atomic and otherwise, and all surface vessels capable\nof launching missiles.\" Another man appeared.\n\nThis job took a little longer, since the crew of each vessel had to be\nteleported back to their bases. An immense scrap-pile, probably visible\nwith a telescope of even moderate power, built up rapidly on the third\nmoon.\n\n\"Now a complete list of your uranium-refining plants, your military\nreactors, heavy-water and heavy-hydrogen plants, and so on.\" Another man\nappeared, but the starship did not move.\n\n\"Here is a list of plants,\" and Garlock named them, coldly. \"You will\nremember them. I will return you to your office, and you may--or may\nnot, as you please--order them evacuated. Look at your watch. We start\ndestroying them in exactly seventy-two of your hours from this moment.\nAny and all persons on the properties will be killed; any within a\nradius of ten of your miles may be killed. Our explosives are extremely\npowerful, but there is no radioactivity and no danger from the fall-out.\nThe danger is from flash-blindness, flash-burn, sheer heat, shock-wave,\nconcussion, and flying debris of all kinds.\"\n\nThe officer vanished and Garlock turned back to the Prime Minister.\n\n\"You have an ally, a nation known as the 'Brotherhood of People's\nRepublics.' Where is its capital? Slide us over there, Jim. Now, Prime\nMinister Sovig, you and your ally, the second and first most populous\nnations of your world, are combining to destroy--a pincers movement, let\nus say?--the third largest nation, or rather, group of nations--the\nNations of the North.... Oh, I see. Third only in population, but first\nin productive capacity and technology. They should be destroyed because\ntheir ideology does not agree with yours. They are too idealistic to\nstrike first, so you will. After you strike, they will not be able to.\nWhereupon you, personally, will rule the world. I will add to that\nsomething you are not thinking, but should: You will rule it until one\nof your friends puts his pistol to the back of your neck and blows your\nbrains out.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nThey were now over the ally's capitol; which launched five missiles\ninstead of one. Garlock collected four more men and studied them.\n\n\"Just as bad--if possible, worse. Who, Lingonor, is the leader of your\nopposition, if any?\" Another man, very evidently of the same race,\nappeared.\n\n\"Idealistic, in a way, but spineless and corrupt,\" Garlock announced to\nall. \"His administration was one of the most corrupt ever known on this\nworld. We'll disarm them, too.\"\n\nThey did. The operation did not take very long; as this nation--or\ngroup, it was not very clear exactly what it was--while very high in\nmanpower, was very low in technology.\n\nThe starship moved to a station high above the Capitol Building of the\nNations of the North and moved slowly downward until it hung poised one\nscant mile over the building. Missiles, jets, and heavy guns were set\nand ready, but no attack was made. Therefore Garlock introduced himself\nto various personages and invited them aboard instead of snatching them;\nnor did he immobilize them after they had been teleported aboard.\n\n\"The president, the chief of staff, the Chief Justice, the most eminent\nscientist, the head of a church, the leaders of the legislative body and\nfour political bosses, the biggest business man, biggest labor leader,\nand biggest gangster. Fourteen men.\" As Garlock studied them his face\nhardened. \"I thought to leave your Nations armed, to entrust this\nworld's future to you, but no. Only two of you are really concerned\nabout the welfare of your peoples, and one of those two is very weak.\nMost of you are of no higher motivation than are the two dictators and\nyour gangster Clyden. You are much better than those we have already\ndisarmed, but you are not good enough.\"\n\nGarlock's hard eyes swept over the group for two minutes before he went\non:\n\n\"I am opening all of your minds, friend and foe alike, to each other, so\nthat you may all see for yourselves what depths of rottenness exist\nthere and just how unfit your world is to associate with the decent\nworlds of this or any other galaxy. It would take God Himself to do\nanything with such material, and I am not God. Therefore, when we have\nrid this world of atomics we will leave and you will start all over\nagain. If you really try, you can not only kill all animal life on your\nplanet, but make it absolutely uninhabitable for....\"\n\n\"Stop it, Clee!\" Lola jumped up, her eyes flashing. Garlock dropped the\ntuned group, but Belle took it over. Everyone there understood every\nthought. \"Don't you _see_, you've done enough? That now you're going too\nfar? That these twenty-odd men, having had their minds opened and having\nbeen given insight into what is possible, will go forward instead of\nbackward?\"\n\n\"Forward? With such people as the Prime Ministers, the labor and\nbusiness leaders, the bosses and the gangsters to cope with? Do you\nthink they've got spines stiff enough for the job?\"\n\n\"I'm sure of it. Our world did it with no better. Millions and millions\nof other worlds did it. Why can't this one do it? Of course it can.\"\n\n\"May I ask a couple of questions?\" This thought came from the tall,\ntrim, soldierly Chief of Staff.\n\n\"Of course, General Cordeen.\"\n\n\"We have all been taking it for granted that you four belong to some\nsuper-human race; some kind or other of _Homo Superior_. Do I understand\ncorrectly your thought that your race is _Homo Sapiens_, the same as\nours?\"\n\n\"Why, of course it is,\" Lola answered in surprise. \"The only difference\nis that we are a few thousand years older than you are.\"\n\n\"You said also that there were 'millions and millions' of worlds that\nhave solved the problems facing us. Were all these worlds also peopled\nby _Homo Sapiens_? It seems incredible.\"\n\n\"True, nevertheless. On any and every world of this type humanity is\nidentical physically; and the mental differences are due only to their\nbeing in different stages of development. In fact, every planet we have\nvisited except this one makes a regular custom of breeding its best\nblood with the best blood of other solar systems. And as to the\n'millions and millions,' I meant only a very large but indefinite\nnumber. As far as I know, not even a rough estimate has ever been\nmade--has there, Clee?\"\n\n\"No, but it will probably turn out to be millions _of_ millions, instead\nof millions _and_ millions; and squared and then cubed at that. My guess\nis that it'll take another ten thousand years of preliminary surveying\nsuch as we're doing, by all the crews the various Galaxian Societies can\nput out, before even the roughest kind of an estimate can be made as to\nhow many planets are inhabited by mutually fertile human peoples.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nFor a moment the group was stunned. Then:\n\n\"Do you mean to say,\" asked the merchant prince, \"that you Galaxians are\nnot the only ones who have interstellar travel?\"\n\n\"Far from it. In fact, yours is the only world we have seen that does\nnot have it, in one form or another.\"\n\n\"Oh? More than one way? That makes it still worse. Would you be willing\nto sell us plans, or lease us ships...?\"\n\n\"So that you could exploit other planets? We will not. You would get\nnowhere, even if you had an interstellar drive right now. You,\npersonally, are a perfect example of what is wrong with this planet.\nRapacious, insatiable; you violate every concept of ethics, common\ndecency, and social responsibility. Your world's technology is so far\nahead of its sociology that you not only should be, but actually are\nbeing, held in quarantine.\"\n\n\"_What?_\"\n\n\"Exactly. One race I know of has been inspecting you regularly for\nseveral hundreds of your years. They will not make contact with you, or\nallow you to leave your own world, until you grow up to something beyond\nthe irresponsible-baby stage. Thus, about two and one-half of your years\nago, a starship of that race sent down a sensing element--unmanned, of\ncourse--to check your state of development. Brother Sovig volatilized it\nwith an atomic missile.\"\n\n\"We did not do it,\" the dictator declared. \"It was the war-mongering\ncapitalists.\"\n\n\"You brainless, mindless, contemptible idiot,\" Garlock sneered. \"Are\neven you actually stupid enough to try to lie with your mind? To minds\nlinked to your own and to mine?\"\n\n\"We did do it, then, but it was only a flying saucer.\"\n\n\"Just as this ship was, to you, only a flying saucer, I suppose. So\nhere's something else for you to think about, Brother Sovig, with\nwhatever power your alleged brain is able to generate. When you shot\ndown that sensor, the starship did not retaliate, but went on without\ntaking any notice of you. When you tried to shoot _us_ down, we took\nsome slight action, but did not kill anyone and are now discussing the\nsituation. Listen carefully now, and remember--it is very possible that\nthe next craft you attack in such utterly idiotic fashion will, without\nany more warning than you gave, blow this whole planet into a ball of\nincandescent gas.\"\n\n\"Can that actually be done?\" the scientist asked. For the first time, he\nbecame really interested in the proceedings.\n\n\"Very easily, Doctor Cheswick,\" Garlock replied. \"We could do it\nourselves with scarcely any effort and at very small cost. You are\nfamiliar, I suppose, with the phenomenon of ball lightning?\"\n\n\"Somewhat. Its mechanism has never been elucidated in any very\nsatisfactory mathematics.\"\n\n\"Well, we have at our disposal a field some....\"\n\n\"Hold it, Clee,\" James warned. \"Do you want to put out that kind of\nstuff around here?\"\n\n\"Um ... m ... m. What do you think?\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nJames studied Cheswick's mind. \"Better than I thought,\" he decided. \"He\nhas made two really worthwhile intuitions--a genius type. He's been\nworking on what amounts almost to the Coupler Theory for ten years. He's\nalmost got it, but you know intuitions of that caliber can't be\nscheduled. He might get it tomorrow--or never. I'd say push him over the\nhump.\"\n\n\"Okay with me. We'll take a vote--one blackball kills it. Brownie? Just\nthe link, of course. A few hints, perhaps, at application, but no\ntechnological data.\"\n\n\"I say give it to him. He's earned it. Besides, he isn't young and may\ndie before he gets it, and that would lose them two or three hundred\nyears.\"\n\n\"Belle?\"\n\n\"In favor. Shall I drop the linkage? No,\" she answered her own question.\n\"No other minds here will have any idea of what it means, and it may do\nsome of them a bit of good to see one of their own minds firing on more\nthan one barrel.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Galaxians.\" The scientist's mind had been quivering with\neagerness. \"I am inexpressibly glad that you have found me worthy of so\nmuch help.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nGarlock entered Cheswick's mind. First he impressed, indelibly, six\nsymbols and their meanings. Second, a long and intricate equation; which\nthe scientist studied avidly.\n\nDuring the ensuing pause, Garlock cut the President and Chief of Staff\nout of the linkage. \"We have just given Cheswick a basic formula. In a\ncouple of hundred years it will give you full telepathy, and then you\nwill begin really to go up. There's nothing secret about it--in fact,\nI'd advise full publication--but even so it might be a smart idea to\ngive him both protection and good working conditions. Brains like his\nare apt to be centuries apart on any world.\"\n\n\"But this is ... it could be ... it _must_ be!\" Cheswick exclaimed. \"I\n_never_ would have formulated _that_! It isn't quite implicit, of\ncourse, but from this there derives the existence of, and the necessity\nfor, electrogravitics! An entirely new field of reality and experiment\nin science!\"\n\n\"There does indeed,\" Garlock admitted, \"and it is far indeed from being\nimplicit. You leaped a tremendous gap. And yes, the resultant is more\nhumanistic than technological.\"\n\nBelle's ear-splitting whistle resounded throughout the Main. \"How do you\nlike _them_ tid-bits, Clee?\" she asked. \"Two hundred years in\nseventy-eight seconds? You folks will have telepathy by the time your\npresent crop of babies grows up. Clee, aren't you sorry you got mad and\nblew your top and wanted to pick up your marbles and go home? _Three_\nsuch intuitions in one man's lifetime beats par, even for the genius\ncourse.\"\n\n\"It sure does,\" Garlock admitted, ruefully. \"I should have studied these\nminds--particularly his--before jumping at conclusions.\"\n\n\"May I say a few words?\" the president asked.\n\n\"You may indeed, sir. I was hoping you would.\"\n\n\"We have been discouraged; faced with an insoluble problem. Sovig and\nLingonor, knowing that their own lives were forfeit anyway, were\nperfectly willing to destroy all the life on this world to make us\nyield. Now, however, with the insight and the encouragement you\nGalaxians have given us, the situation has changed. Reduced to ordinary\nhigh explosives, they cannot conquer us....\"\n\n\"Especially without an airforce,\" Lola put in. \"I, personally, will see\nto it that every bomber and fighter plane they now have goes to the\nthird moon. It will be your responsibility to see to it that they do not\nrebuild.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Miss Montandon. We will see to it. As for our internal\ndifficulties--I think, under certain conditions, they can be handled.\nOur lawless element,\" he glanced at the gangster, \"can be made impotent.\nThe corrupt practices of both capital and labor can be stopped. We have\nlaws,\" here he looked at the members of Congress and the judge, \"which\ncan be enforced. The conditions I mentioned would be difficult at the\nmoment, since so few of us are here and it is manifest that few if any\nof our people will believe that such people as you Galaxians really\nexist. Would it be possible for you, Miss Montandon, to spend a few\ndays--or whatever time you can spare--in showing our Congress, and as\nmany other groups as possible, what humanity may hope to become?\"\n\n\"Of course, sir. I was planning on it.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid that is impossible,\" the Chief of Staff said.\n\n\"Why, General Cardeen?\" Lola asked.\n\n\"Because you'd be shot,\" Cardeen said, bluntly. \"We have a very good\nSecret Service, it is true, and we would give you every protection\npossible; but such an all-out effort as would be made to assassinate you\nwould almost certainly succeed.\"\n\n\"Shot?\" Garlock asked in surprise. \"What with? You haven't anything that\ncould even begin to crack an Operator's Shield.\"\n\n\"With this, sir.\" Cardeen held out his automatic pistol for inspection.\n\n\"Oh, I hadn't studied it ... a pellet-projector....\"\n\n\"_Pellet!_ Do you call a four-seventy-five slug a pellet?\"\n\n\"Not much of that, really ... it shoots eight times--shoot all eight of\nthem at her. None of them will touch her.\"\n\n\"_What?_ I _will_ not! One of those slugs will go through three women\nlike her, front to back in line.\"\n\n\"I will, then.\" The pistol leaped into Garlock's hand. \"Hold up one\nhand, Brownie, and catch 'em. Don't let 'em splash--no deformation, so\nhe can recognize his own pellets.\"\n\nHolding the unfamiliar weapon in a clumsy, highly unorthodox\ngrip--something like a schoolgirl's first attempt--Garlock glanced once\nat Lola's upraised palm and eight shots roared out as fast as the gases\nof explosion could operate the mechanism. The pistol's barrel remained\nrigidly motionless under all the stress of ultra-rapid fire. Lola's\nslim, deeply-tanned arm did not even quiver under the impact of that\nstorm of heavy bullets against her apparently unsupported hand. No one\nsaw those bullets strike that gently-curved right palm, but everyone saw\nthem drop into her cupped left hand, like drops of water dripping\nrapidly from the end of an icicle into a bowl.\n\n\"Here are your pellets, General Cardeen.\" Lola handed them to him with a\nsmile.\n\n\"Holy--Jumping--Snakes!\" the general said, and:\n\n\"Wotta torpedo!\" came the gangster's envious thought.\n\n\"You see, I am perfectly safe from being 'shot,' as you call it,\" Lola\nsaid. \"So I'll come down and work with you. You might have your news\nservices put out a bulletin, though. I never have killed anyone, and am\nnot going to here, but anyone who tries to shoot me or bomb me or\nanything will lose both hands at the wrists just before he fires. That\nwould keep them from killing anyone standing near me, don't you think?\"\n\n\"I should _think_ it would,\" General Cordeen thought, and a pall of awe\ncovered the linked minds. The implications of the naively frank remark\njust uttered by this apparently inoffensive and defenseless young woman\nwere simply too overwhelming to be discussed.\n\n\"Anything else on the agenda, Clee?\" Lola asked.\n\nThere was not, and the starship's guests were returned, each to his own\nhome place.\n\nAnd not one of them, it may be said, was exactly the same as he had\nbeen.\n\n    [Illustration:\n\n    The deepest Gunther block was at last penetrated and\n    Belle became conscious of a heretofore unknown mental\n    alignment with the ship.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\n\n\"I think I'll come along with you and bodyguard you, Lola,\" Belle said,\nthe following morning after breakfast. \"Clee's going to be seven\nthousand miles deep in mathematics and Jim's doing his stuff at the\nobservatory, and I can't help either of 'em at the moment. You'd do a\nbetter job, wouldn't you, if you could concentrate on it?\"\n\n\"Of course. Thanks, Belle. But remember, it's already been announced--no\ndeath. Just hands. I can't really believe that I'll be attacked, but\nthey seem pretty sure of it.\"\n\n\"I'd like to separate anyone like that from his head instead of his\nhands, but as it is published so it will be performed.\"\n\n\"How about wearing some kind of half-way-comfortable shoes instead of\nthose slippers?\" Garlock asked. \"That could turn out to be a long, tough\nbrawl, and your dogs'll be begging for mercy before you get back here.\"\n\n\"Uh-uh. Very comfortable and a perfect fit. Besides, if I have to suffer\njust a little bit for good appearance's sake in a matter of\nintergalactic amity....\"\n\n\"A matter of showing off, you mean.\"\n\n\"Why, Clee!\" Belle widened her eyes at him. \"How you talk! But they're\nready, Lola--let's go.\"\n\nThe two girls disappeared from the Main, to appear on the speakers'\nstand in front of the Capitol Building. President Benton was there, with\nhis cabinet and certain other personages. General Cordeen and his staff.\nAnd many others.\n\n\"Oh, Miss Bellamy, too? I'm _very_ glad you are here,\" Benton said, as\nhe shook hands cordially with both.\n\n\"Thank you. I came along as bodyguard. May I meet your Secret Service\nChief, please?\"\n\n\"Why, of course. Miss Bellamy, may I present Mr. Avengord?\"\n\n\"You have the hospital room ready?... Where is it, please?\"\n\n\"Back of us, in the wing....\"\n\n\"Just think of it, please, and I will follow your thought.... Ah, yes,\nthere it is. I hope it will not be used. You agree with General Cordeen\nthat there will be one or more attempts at assassination?\"\n\n\"I'm very much afraid so. This town is literally riddled with enemy\nagents, and of course we don't know all of them--especially the best\nones. They know that if these meetings go through, they're sunk; so\nthey're desperate. We've got this whole area covered like dew--we've\narrested sixteen suspects already this morning--but all the advantage is\ntheirs,\" Avengord finished glumly.\n\n\"Not all of it, sir,\" Belle smiled at him cheerfully. \"You have me, and\nI am a Prime Operator. That is, a wielder of power of no small ability.\nOh, you are right. There is an attempt now being prepared.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nWhile Belle had been greeting and conversing, she had also been\nscanning. Her range, her sensitivity, and her power were immensely\ngreater than Lola's; were probably equal to Garlock's own. She scanned\nby miles against the scant yards covered by the Secret Service.\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Give me your thought.\" The Secret Service man did not know what she\nmeant--telepathy was of course new to him--so she seized his attention\nand directed it to a certain window in a building a couple of miles away\non a hill.\n\n\"But they couldn't, from there!\"\n\n\"But they can. They have a quite efficient engine of destruction--a\n'rifle' is their thought. Large, and long, with a very good telescope on\nit--with crosshairs. If I scan their minds more precisely you may know\nthe weapon.... Ah, they think of it as a 'Buford Mark Forty\nAnti-Aircraft Rifle'.\"\n\n\"A Buford! My God, they can hit any button on her clothes--get her away,\nquick!\" He tried to jump, but could not move.\n\n\"As you were,\" she directed. \"There was another Buford there, and\nanother over there.\" She guided his thought. \"Two men to each Buford.\nThere are now six handless men in your hospital room. If you will send\nmen to those three places you will find the Bufords and the hands. Your\nsurgeon will have no difficulty in matching the hands to the men. If any\nseek to remove either Bufords or hands before your men get there, I will\nde-hand them, also.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nTo say that the Secret Service man was flabbergasted is to put it very\nmildly indeed. Cordeen had told him, with much pounding on his desk and\nin searing, air-blueing language, what to expect-or, rather, to expect\n_anything_, no matter what and with no limits whatever--but he hadn't\nbelieved it then and simply could not believe it now. Goddamn it, such\nthings _couldn't_ happen. And this beautiful, beautifully-stacked,\nhalf-naked woman--girl, rather, she couldn't be a day over\ntwenty-five--even if it had been their black-browed, toplofty leader,\nCaptain Garlock himself....\n\n\"I am twenty-three of your years old, not twenty-five,\" she informed\nhim, coldly, \"and I will permit no distinction of sex. In your primitive\nculture the women may still be allowing you men to believe in the\nfallacy of the superiority of the male, but know right now that I can do\nanything any man ever born can do and do it better.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm ... I'm sure ... certainly....\" Avengord's thought was\nincoherent.\n\n\"If you want me to work with you you had better start believing right\nnow that there are a lot of things you don't know,\" Belle went on\nrelentlessly. \"Stop believing that just because a thing has not already\nhappened on this primitive, backward, mudball planet of yours, it can't\nhappen anywhere or anywhen. You do believe, however, whether you want to\nor not, things you see with your own eyes?\"\n\n\"Yes. I can _not_ be hypnotized.\"\n\n\"I'm very glad you believe that much.\" Avengord did not notice that she\nneither confirmed nor denied the truth of his statement. \"To that end\nyou will go now into the hospital room and see the bandaging going on.\nYou will see and hear the news broadcast going out as I prepared it.\"\n\nHe went, and came back a badly shaken man.\n\n\"But they're sending it out exactly as it happened!\" he protested.\n\"They'll all scatter out so fast and so far we'll _never_ catch them!\"\n\n\"By no means. You see, the amputees didn't believe that they would lose\ntheir hands. Their superiors didn't believe it, either; they assured\neach other and their underlings that it was just capitalistic bluff and\nnonsense. And since they are all even more materialistic and hidebound\nand unbelieving than you are, they all are now highly confused--at a\ncomplete loss.\"\n\n\"You can say _that_ again. If I, working with you and having you\npounding it into my head, couldn't more than half believe it....\"\n\n\"So they are now very frightened, as well as confused, and the director\nof their whole spy system is now violating rule and precedent by sending\nout messengers to summon certain high agents to confer with him in his\nsecret place.\"\n\n\"If you'll tell me where, I'll get over to my office....\"\n\n\"No. We'll both be in your office in plenty of time. We'll watch Lola\nget started. It will be highly instructive for you to watch a really\ncapable Operator at work.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nPresident Benton had been introduced; had in turn finished introducing\nLola. The crowd, many thousands strong, was cheering. Lola was stepping\ninto the carefully marked speaker's place.\n\n\"You may disconnect these,\" she waved a hand at the battery of\nmicrophones, \"since I do not use speech. Not only do I not know any of\nyour various languages, but no one language would suffice. My thought\nwill go to every person on this, your world.\"\n\n\"World?\" the President asked in surprise. \"Surely not behind the\nCurtains? They will jam you, I'm afraid.\"\n\n\"My thought, as I shall drive it, will not be stopped,\" Lola assured\nhim. \"Since this world has no telepathy, it has no mind-blocks and I can\ncover the planet as easily as one mind. Nor does it matter whether it be\nday or night, or whether anyone is awake or asleep. All will receive my\nmessage. Since you wish a record, the cameras may run, although they are\nneither necessary nor desirable for me. Everyone will see me in his\nmind, much better than on the surface of any teevee tube.\"\n\n\"And I was going to have her address _Congress_!\" the President\nwhispered, aside, to General Cordeen.\n\nThen Lola put her whole fine personality into a smile, directed\napparently not only at each separate individual within sight, but also\nindividually at every person on the globe; and when Brownie Montandon\nset out to make a production of a smile, it had the impact of a\npile-driver. Then came her smooth, gently-flowing, friendly thought:\n\n\"My name, friends of this world Ormolan, is Lola Montandon. Those of you\nwho are now looking at teevee screens can see my imaged likeness. All of\nyou can see me very much better within your own minds.\n\n\"I am not here as an invader in any sense, but only as a citizen of the\nFirst Galaxy of this, our common universe. I have attuned my mind to\neach of yours in order to give you a message from the United Galaxian\nSocieties.\n\n\"There are four of us Galaxians in this Exploration Team. As Galaxians\nit is our purpose here and our duty here to open your minds to certain\nbasic truths, to be of help to you in clearing your minds of fallacies,\nof lies, and of undefensible prejudices; to the end that you will more\nrapidly become Galaxians yourselves....\"\n\n\"Okay. This will go on and on. That's enough to give you an idea of what\na trained and polished performer can do. What do you think of _them_\ncomfits, Chief?\" Belle deliberately knocked the Secret Service man out\nof his Lola-induced mood.\n\n\"Huh? Oh, yes.\" Avengord was still groggy. \"She's phenomenal--good--I\ndon't mean goody-goody, but sincere and really....\"\n\n\"Yeah, but don't fall in love with her. Everybody does and it doesn't do\nany of them a bit of good. That's her specialty and she's _very_ good at\nit. I told you she's a smooth, smooth worker.\"\n\n\"You can say _that_ again.\" Avengord did not know that he was repeating\nhimself. \"But it isn't an act. She means it and it's true.\"\n\n\"Of course she means it and of course it's true. Otherwise even she,\nwith all her training, couldn't sell such a big bill of goods.\" Then, in\nanswer to the man's unspoken question, \"Yes, we're all different. She's\nthe contactor, the spreader of the good old oil, the shining example of\npurity and sweetness and light--in short, the Greaser of the Ways. I'm a\nfighter, myself. Do you think she could actually have de-handed those\nmen? Uh-uh. At the last minute she would have weakened and brought them\nin whole. My job in this operation is to knock hell out of the ones Lola\ncan't convince, such as those spies you and I are going to interview\npretty quick.\"\n\n\"Even they ought to be convinced. I don't see how anybody could help but\nbe.\"\n\n\"Uh-uh. It'll bounce off like hailstones off of a tin roof. The only\nthing to do to that kind of scum is kill them. If you'll give me a\nthought as to where your office is we'll hop over and....\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nBelle and Avengord disappeared from the stand; and, such was Lola's\nhold, no one on the platform or in the throng even noticed that they\nwere gone. They materialized in Avengord's private office; he sitting as\nusual at his desk, she reclining in legs-crossed ease in a big leather\nchair.\n\n\"... get to work.\" Belle's thought had not been interrupted by any\npassage of time whatever. \"What do you want to do first?\"\n\n\"But I thought you were covering Miss Montandon?\"\n\n\"I am. Like a blanket. Just as well here as anywhere. I will be, until\nshe gets back to the _Pleiades_. What first?\"\n\n\"Oh. Well, since I don't know what your limits are--if you have any--you\nmight as well do whatever you think best and I'll watch you do it.\"\n\n\"That's the way to talk. You're going to get a shock when you see who\nthe Head Man is. George T. Basil.\"\n\n\"_Basil_! I'll say it's a shock!\" Avengord steadied, frowned in\nconcentration. \"Could be, though. _He_ would _never_ be suspected--but\nthey're very good at that.\"\n\n\"Yeah. His name used to be Baslovkowitz. He was trained for years, then\nplanted. None of this can be proved, as his record is perfect. Born\ncitizen, highest standing in business and social circles. Unlimited\nentry and top security clearance. Right?\"\n\n\"Right ... and getting enough evidence, in such cases as that, is pure,\nunadulterated hell.\"\n\n\"I suppose I could kill him, after we've recorded everything he knows,\"\nBelle suggested.\n\n\"No!\" He snapped. \"Too many people think of us as a strong-arm squad\nnow. Anyway, I'd rather kill him myself than wish the job off onto--you\ndon't _like_ killing, do you?\"\n\n\"That's the understatement of the century. No civilized person does. In\na hot fight, yes; but killing anyone who is helpless to fight back--in\ncold blood--ugh! It makes me sick in my stomach even to think of it.\"\n\n\"With the way you can read minds, we can get evidence enough to send\nthem all to jail, and that we'll have to do.\"\n\n\"How about this?\" Belle grinned as another solution came to mind. \"From\nthose first eight top men, we'll find out a lot of others lower down,\nand so on, until we have 'em all locked up here. We'll announce that\nexactly so many spies and agents--giving names, addresses, and facts, of\ncourse--got panicky after Lola's address. They fired up their hidden\nplanes and flew back behind the Curtain. Then, when we've scanned their\nminds and recorded everything you want, I'll pack them all, very snugly\nand carefully, into Sovig's private office. With the world situation\nwhat it then will be, he won't dare kill them--he simply won't know what\nto do when faced with it.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nAvengord agreed happily. He reached out and flipped the switch of his\nintercom. \"Miss Kimling, come in, please.\"\n\nThe door burst open. \"Why, it _is_ you! But you were on the rostrum just\na minute.... Oh!\" She saw Belle, and backed, eyes wide, toward the door\nshe had just entered. \"_She_ was there, too, and it's fifteen\n_miles_....\"\n\n\"Steady, Fram. I'd like to present you to Prime Operator Belle Bellamy,\nwho is cleaning out the entire Curtain organization for us.\"\n\n\"But how did you....\"\n\n\"Never mind that. Teleportation. It took her half an hour to pound it\ninto me, and we can't take time to explain anything now. I'll tell\neverybody everything I know as soon as I can. In the meantime, don't be\nsurprised at anything that happens, and by that I mean _anything_. Such\nas solid people appearing on this carpet--on that spot right\nthere--instantaneously. I want you to pay close attention to everything\nyour mind receives, put your phenomenal memory into high gear, listen to\neverything I record, stop me any time I'm wrong, and be _sure_ I get\neverything we need.\"\n\n\"I don't know exactly what you're talking about, sir, but I'll try.\"\n\n\"Frankly, I don't, either--we'll just have to roll it as we go along.\nWe're ready for George T. Basil now, Miss Bellamy--I hope. Don't jump,\nFram.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nBasil appeared and Fram jumped. She did not scream, however, and did not\nrun out of the office. The master spy was a big, self-assured, affluent\ntype. He had not the slightest idea of how he had been spirited out of\nhis ultra-secret sub-basement and into this room; but he knew where he\nwas and, after one glance at Belle, he knew why. He decided instantly\nwhat to do about it.\n\n\"This is an outrage!\" he bellowed, hammering with his fist on Avengord's\ndesk. \"A stupid, high-handed violation of the rights....\"\n\nBelle silenced him and straightened him up.\n\n\"High-handed? Yes,\" she admitted quite seriously. \"However, from the\nGalaxian standpoint, you have no rights at all and you are going to be\nextremely surprised at just how high-handed I am going to be. I am going\nto read your mind to its very bottom--layer by layer, like peeling an\nonion--and everything you know and everything you think is going down in\nMr. Avengord's Big Black Book.\"\n\nBelle linked all four minds together and directed the search, making\nsure that no item, however small, was missed. Avengord recorded every\npertinent item. Fram Kimling memorized and correlated and\ndouble-checked.\n\nSoon it was done, and Basil, shouting even louder about this last and\nworst violation of his rights--those of his own private mind--was led\naway by two men and \"put away where he would keep.\"\n\n\"But this _is_ a flagrant violation of law....\" Miss Kimling began.\n\n\"You can say _that_ again!\" her boss gloated. \"And if you only knew how\ntickled I am to do it, after the way they've been kicking _me_ around!\n\n\"But I wonder ... are you sure we can get away with it?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" Belle put in. \"We Galaxians are doing it, not your\ngovernment or your Secret Service. We'll start you clean--but it'll be\nup to you to keep it clean, and that will be no easy job.\"\n\n\"No, it won't; but we'll do it. Come around again, say in five or six\nyears, and see.\"\n\n\"You know, I might take you up on that? Maybe not this same team, but\nI've got a notion to tape a recommendation for a re-visit, just to see\nhow you get along. It'd be interesting.\"\n\n\"I wish you would. It might help, too, if everybody thought you'd come\nback to check. Suppose you could?\"\n\n\"I've no idea, really. I'd like to, though, and I'll see what I can do.\nBut let's get on with the job. They're all in what you call the 'tank'\nnow. Which one do you want next?\"\n\nThe work went on. That evening there was of course a reception; and then\na ball. And Belle's feet did hurt when she got back to the _Pleiades_,\nbut of course she would not admit the fact--most especially not to\nGarlock.\n\nExactly at the expiration of the stipulated seventy-two hours, the\nGalaxians began to destroy military atomic plants; and, shortly\nthereafter, the starship's crew was again ready to go.\n\nAnd James rammed home the red button that would send them--all four\nwondered--_where_?\n\nIt turned out to be another Hodell-type world; and, even with the\nhigh-speed comparator, it took longer to check the charts than it did to\nmake them.\n\n        *           *           *\n\nThe next planet was similar. So was the next, and the next. The time\nrequired for checking grew longer and longer.\n\n\"How about cutting out this checking entirely, Clee?\" James asked then.\n\"What good does it do? Even if we find a similarity, what could we do\nabout it? We've got enough stuff now to keep a crew of astronomers busy\nfor five years making a tank of it.\"\n\n\"Okay. We probably are so far away now, anyway, that the chance of\nfinding a similarity is vanishingly small. Keep on taking the shots,\nthough; they'll prove, I think, that the universe is one whole hell of a\nlot bigger than anybody has ever thought it was. That reminds me--are\nyou getting anywhere on that N-problem? I'm not.\"\n\n\"I'm getting nowhere, fast. You should have been a math prof in a grad\nschool, Clee. You could flunk every advanced student you had with that\none. Belle and I together can't feed it to Compy in such shape as to get\na definite answer. We think, though, that your guess was right--if we\never stabilize anywhere it will probably be relative to Hodell, not to\nTellus. But the cold fact of how far away we must be by this time just\nscares the pants off of me.\"\n\n\"You and me both, my ripe and old. We're a _long_ ways from home.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nJumping went on; and, two or three planets later, they encountered an\nArpalone Inspector who did not test them for compatibility with the\nhumanity of his world.\n\n\"Do not land,\" the creature said, mournfully. \"This world is dying, and\nif you leave the protection of your ship, you too will die.\"\n\n\"But _worlds_ don't die, surely?\" Garlock protested. \"People, yes--but\nworlds?\"\n\n\"Worlds die. It is the Dilipic. The humans die, too, of course, but it\nis the world itself that is attacked, not the people. Some of them, in\nfact, will live through it.\"\n\nGarlock drove his attention downward and scanned.\n\n\"You Arpalones are doing what looks like a mighty good job of fighting.\nCan't you win?\"\n\n\"No, it is too late. It was already too late when they first appeared,\ntwo days ago. When the Dilipics strike in such small force that none of\ntheir--agents?--devices?--whatever they are?--can land against our\nbeaming, a world can be saved; but such cases are very few.\"\n\n\"But this thought, 'Dilipic'?\" Garlock asked, impatiently. \"It is merely\na symbol--it doesn't _mean_ anything--to me, at least. What are they?\nWhere do they come from?\"\n\n\"No one knows anything about them,\" came the surprising answer. \"Not\neven their physical shape--if they have any. Nor where they come from,\nor how they do what they do.\"\n\n\"They can't be very common,\" Garlock pondered. \"We have never heard of\nthem before.\"\n\n\"Fortunately, they are not,\" the Inspector agreed. \"Scarcely one world\nin five hundred is ever attacked by them--this is the first Dilipic\ninvasion I have seen.\"\n\n\"Oh, you Arpalones don't die with your worlds, then?\" Lola asked. She\nwas badly shaken. \"But I suppose the Arpales do, of course.\"\n\n\"Practically all of the Arpales will die, of course. Most of us\nArpalones will also die, in the battles now going on. Those of us who\nsurvive, however, will stay aloft until the rehabilitation fleet\narrives, then we will continue our regular work.\"\n\n\"Rehab?\" Belle exclaimed. \"You mean you can _restore_ planets so badly\nruined that all the people die?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. It is a long and difficult work, but the planet is always\nre-peopled.\"\n\n\"Let's go down,\" Garlock said. \"I want to get all of this on tape.\"\n\nThey went down, over what had been one of that world's largest cities.\nThe air, the stratosphere, and all nearby space were full of battling\nvessels of all shapes and sizes; ranging from the tremendous globular\nspaceships of the invaders down to the tiny, one-man jet-fighters of the\nArpalones.\n\n        *           *           *\n\nThe Dilipics were using projectile weapons only--ranging in size,\nwith the size of the vessels, from heavy machine guns up to\nseventy-five-millimeter quick-firing rifles. They were also launching\nthousands of guided missiles of fantastic speed and of tremendous\nexplosive power.\n\nThe Arpalones were not using anything solid at all. Each defending\nvessel, depending upon its type and class, carried from four up to a\nhundred or so burnished-metal reflectors some four feet in diameter;\neach with a small black device at its optical center and each pouring\nout a tight beam of highly effective energy. It was at these reflectors,\nand particularly at these tiny devices, that the small-arms fire was\ndirected, and the marksmanship of the Dilipics was very good indeed.\nHowever, each projector was oscillating irregularly and each\nfighter-plane was taking evasive action; and, since a few bullet-holes\nin any reflector did not reduce its efficiency very much, and since the\ncentral mechanisms were so small and were moving so erratically, a good\nthree-quarters of the Arpalonian beams were still in action.\n\n        *           *           *\n\nThere was no doubt at all that those beams were highly effective.\nInvisible for the most part, whenever one struck a Dilipic ship or plane\neverything in its path flared almost instantly into vapor and the beam\nglared incandescently, blindingly white or violet or high blue--never\nanything lower than blue. Almost everything material, that is; for guns,\nammunition, and missiles were not affected. They did not even explode.\nWhen whatever fabric it was that supported them was blasted away, all\nsuch things simply dropped; simply fell through thousands or hundreds of\nthousands of feet of air to crash unheeded upon whatever happened to be\nbelow.\n\nThe invading task force was arranged in a whirling, swirling, almost\ncylindrical cone, more or less like an Earthly tornado. The largest\nvessels were high above the stratosphere; the smallest fighters were\nhedge-hoppingly close to ground. Each Dilipic unit seemed madly,\nsuicidally determined that nothing would get through that furious wall\nto interfere with whatever it was that was coming down from space to the\nground through--along?--the relatively quiet \"eye\" of the\npseudo-hurricane.\n\nOn the other hand, the Arpalones were madly, suicidally determined to\nbreak through that vortex wall, to get into the \"eye,\" to wreak all\npossible damage there. Group after group after group of five\njet-fighters each came driving in; and, occasionally, the combined\nblasts of all five made enough of opening in the wall so that the center\nfighter could get through. Once inside, each pilot stood his little,\nstubby-winged craft squarely on her tail, opened his projectors to\nabsolute maximum of power and of spread, and climbed straight up the\nspout until he was shot down.\n\nAnd the Arpalones were winning the battle. Larger and larger gaps were\nbeing opened in the vortex wall; gaps which it became increasingly\ndifficult for the Dilipics to fill. More and more Arpalone fighters were\ngetting inside. They were lasting longer and doing more damage all the\ntime. The tube was growing narrower and narrower.\n\nAll four Galaxians perceived all this in seconds. Garlock weighed out\nand detonated a terrific matter-conversion bomb in the exact center of\none of the largest vessels of the attacking fleet. It had no effect.\nThen a larger one. Then another, still heavier. Finally, at over a\nhundred megatons equivalent, he did get results--of a sort. The\ninvaders' guns, ammunition, and missiles were blown out of the ship and\nscattered outward for miles in all directions; but the structure of the\nDilipic ship itself was not harmed.\n\nBelle had been studying, analyzing, probing the things that were coming\ndown through that hellish tube.\n\n\"Clee!\" She drove a thought. \"Cut out the monkey-business with those\ndamn firecrackers of yours and look here--pure, solid force, like ball\nlightning or our Op field, but entirely different--see if you can\nanalyze the stuff!\"\n\n\"Alive?\" Garlock asked, as he drove a probe into one of the things--they\nwere furiously-radiating spheres some seven feet in diameter--and began\nto tune to it.\n\n\"I don't know--don't think so--if they are, they're a form of life that\nno sane human being could even imagine!\"\n\n\"Let's see what they actually do,\" Garlock suggested, still trying to\ntune in with the thing, whatever it was, and still following it down.\n\nThis particular force-ball happened to hit the top of a six-story\nbuilding. It was not going very fast--fifteen or twenty miles an\nhour--but when it struck the roof it did not even slow down. Without any\neffort at all, apparently, it continued downward through the concrete\nand steel and glass of the building; and everything in its path became\nmonstrously, sickeningly, revoltingly changed.\n\n\"I simply can't stand any more of this,\" Lola gasped. \"If you don't\nmind, I'm going to my room, set all the Gunther blocks it has, and bury\nmy head under a pillow.\"\n\n\"Go ahead, Brownie,\" James said. \"This is too tough for _anybody_ to\nwatch. I'd do the same, except I've got to run these cameras.\"\n\nLola disappeared.\n\n        *           *           *\n\nGarlock and Belle kept on studying. Neither had paid any attention at\nall to either Lola or James.\n\nInstead of the structural material it had once been, the bore that the\nthing had traversed was now full of a sparkling, bubbling, writhing,\npartly-fluid-partly-viscous, obscenely repulsive mass of something\nunknown and unknowable on Earth; a something which, Garlock now\nrecalled, had been thought of by the Arpalone Inspector as \"golop.\"\n\nAs that unstoppable globe descended through office after office, it\nneither sought out people nor avoided them. Walls, doors, windows,\nceilings, floors and rugs, office furniture and office personnel; all\nalike were absorbed into and made a part of that indescribably horrid\nbrew.\n\nNor did the track of that hellishly wanton globe remain a bore. Instead,\nit spread. That devil's brew ate into and dissolved everything it\ntouched like a stream of boiling water being poured into a\nloosely-heaped pile of granulated sugar. By the time the ravening sphere\nhad reached the second floor, the entire roof of the building was gone\nand the writhing, racing flood of corruption had flowed down the outer\nwalls and across the street, engulfing and transforming sidewalks,\npeople, pavement, poles, wires, automobiles, people-anything and\neverything it touched.\n\n        *           *           *\n\nThe globe went on down, through basement and sub-basement, until it\nreached solid, natural ground. Then, with its top a few inches below the\nlevel of natural ground, it came to a full stop and--apparently--did\nnothing at all. By this time, the ravening flood outside had eaten far\ninto the lower floors of the buildings across the street, as well as\nalong all four sides of the block, and tremendous masses of masonry and\nsteel, their supporting structures devoured, were subsiding, crumbling,\nand crashing down into the noisome flood of golop--and were being\ntransformed almost as fast as they could fall.\n\nOne tremendous mass, weighing hundreds or perhaps thousands of tons,\ntoppled almost as a whole; splashing the stuff in all directions for\nhundreds of yards. Wherever each splash struck, however, a new center of\nattack came into being, and the peculiarly disgusting, abhorrent\nliquidation went on.\n\n\"Can you do anything with it, Clee?\" Belle demanded.\n\n\"Not too much--it's a mess,\" Garlock replied. \"Besides, it wouldn't get\nus far, I don't think. It'll be more productive to analyze the beams the\nArpalones are using to break them up, don't you think?\"\n\nThen, for twenty solid minutes, the two Prime Operators worked on those\nenigmatic beams.\n\n\"We can't assemble _that_ kind of stuff with our minds,\" Belle decided\nthen.\n\n\"I'll say we can't,\" Garlock agreed. \"Ten megacycles, and cycling only\ntwenty per second.\" He whistled raucously through his teeth. \"My guess\nis it'd take four months to design and build a generator to put out that\nkind of stuff. It's worse than our Op field.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure I could _ever_ design one,\" Belle said, thoughtfully, \"but\nof course I'm not the engineer you are....\" Then, she could not help\nadding, \"... yet.\"\n\n\"No, and you never will be,\" he said, flatly.\n\n\"No? That's what _you_ think!\" Even in such circumstances as those,\nBelle Bellamy was eager to carry on her warfare with her Project Chief.\n\n\"That's _exactly_ what I think--and I'm so close to knowing it for a\nfact that the difference is indetectible.\"\n\nBelle almost--but not quite--blew up. \"Well, what _are_ you going to\ndo?\"\n\n\"Unless and until I can figure out something effective to do, I'm not\ngoing to try to do anything. If you, with your vaunted and flaunted\nbelief in the inherent superiority of the female over the male, can dope\nout something useful before I do, I'll eat crow and help you do it. As\nfor arguing with you, I'm all done for the moment.\"\n\nBelle gritted her teeth, flounced away, and plumped herself down into a\nchair. She shut her eyes and put every iota of her mind to work on the\nproblem of finding something--_anything_--that could be done to help\nthis doomed world and to show that big, overbearing jerk of a Garlock\nthat she was a better man than he was. Which of the two objectives\nloomed more important, she herself could not have told, to save her\nlife.\n\nAnd Garlock looked around. The air and the sky over the now-vanished\ncity were both clear of Dilipic craft. The surviving Arpalone fighters\nand other small craft were making no attempt to land, anywhere on the\nworld's surface. Instead, they were flying upward toward, and were being\ndrawn one by one into the bowels of, huge Arpalonian space-freighters.\nWhen each such vessel was filled to capacity, it flew upward and set\nitself into a more-or-less-circular orbit around the planet.\n\nAround and around and around the ruined world the _Pleiades_ went;\nrecording, observing, charting. Fifty-eight of those atrocious Dilipic\nvortices had been driven to ground. Every large land-mass surrounded by\nlarge bodies of water had been struck once, and only once; from the\ntremendous area of the largest continent down to the relatively tiny\nexpanses of the largest islands. One land-mass, one vortex. One only.\n\n\"What d'you suppose _that_ means?\" James asked. \"Afraid of water?\"\n\n\"Damfino. Could be. Let's check ... mountains, too. Skip us back to\nwhere we started--oceans and mountains both fairly close there.\"\n\nThe city had disappeared long since; for hundreds of almost-level square\nmiles there extended a sparkling, seething, writhing expanse of--of\nwhat? The edge of that devouring flood had almost reached the\nfoot-hills, and over that gnawing, dissolving edge the _Pleiades_\npaused.\n\n        *           *           *\n\nSmall lakes and ordinary rivers bothered the golop very little if at\nall. There was perhaps a slightly increased sparkling, a slight\nstiffening, a little darkening, some freezing and breaking off of solid\nblocks; but the thing's forward motion was not noticeably slowed down.\nIt drank a fairly large river and a lake one mile wide by ten miles long\nwhile the two men watched.\n\nThe golop made no attempt to climb either foot-hills or mountains. It\nleveled them. It ate into their bases at its own level; the undermined\nmasses, small and large, collapsed into the foul, corrosive semi-liquid\nand were consumed. Nor was there much raising of the golop's level, even\nwhen the highest mountains were reached and miles-high masses of solid\nrock broke off and toppled. There was some raising, of course; but the\nstuff was fluid enough so that its slope was not apparent to the eye.\n\n        *           *           *\n\nThen the _Pleiades_ went back, over the place where the city had been\nand on to what had once been an ocean beach. The original wave of\ndegradation had reached that shore long since, had attacked its sands\nout into deep water, and there it had been stopped. The corrupt flood\nwas now being reinforced, however, by an ever-rising tide of material\nthat had once been mountains. And the slope, which had not been even\nnoticeable at the mountains or over the plain, was here very evident.\n\nAs the rapidly-flowing golop struck water, the water shivered, came to a\nweirdly unforgettable cold boil, and exploded into drops and streamers\nand jagged-edged chunks of something that was neither water nor land; or\nrock or soil or sand or Satan's unholy brew. Nevertheless, the water\nwon. There was _so_ much of it! Each barrel of water that was destroyed\nwas replaced instantly and enthusiastically; with no lowering of level\nor of pressure.\n\nAnd when water struck the golop, the golop also shivered violently, then\nsparkled even more violently, then stopped sparkling and turned dark,\nthen froze solid. The frozen surface, however, was neither thick enough\nnor strong enough to form an effective wall.\n\nAgain and again the wave of golop built up high enough to crack and to\nshatter that feeble wall; again and again golop and water met in\nultimately furious, if insensate, battle. Inch by inch the ocean's\nshoreline was driven backward toward ocean's depths; but every inch the\nocean lost was to its tactical advantage, since the advancing front was\nby now practically filled with hard, solid, dead blocks of its own\nsubstance which it could neither assimilate nor remove from the scene of\nconflict.\n\nHence the wall grew ever thicker and solider; the advance became slower\nand slower.\n\nThen, finally, ocean waves of ever-increasing height and violence rolled\nin against the new-formed shore. What caused those tremendous\nwaves--earthquakes, perhaps, due to the shifting of the mountains'\nmasses?--no Tellurian ever surely knew. Whatever the cause, however,\nthose waves operated to pin the golop down. Whenever and wherever one of\nthose monstrous waves whitecapped in, hurling hundreds of thousands of\ntons of water inland for hundreds of yards, the battle-front stabilized\nthen and there.\n\nAll over that world the story was the same. Wherever there was water\nenough, the water won. And the total quantity of water in that world's\noceans remained practically unchanged.\n\n\"Good. A lot of people escaped,\" James said, expelling a long-held\nbreath. \"Everybody who lives on or could be flown to all the islands\nsmaller than the biggest ones ... if they can find enough to eat and if\nthe air isn't poisoned.\"\n\n\"Air's okay--so's the water--and they'll get food,\" Garlock said. \"The\nArpalones will handle things, including distribution. What I'm thinking\nabout is how they're going to rehabilitate it. That, as an engineering\nproject, is a feat to end all feats.\"\n\n\"_Brother!_ You can play _that_ in spades!\" James agreed. \"Except that\nit'll take too many months before they can even start the job, I'd like\nto stick around and see how they go about it. How does this kind of\nstuff fit into that theory you're not admitting is a theory?\"\n\n\"Not worth a damn. However, it's a datum--and, as I've said before and\nmay say again, if we can get _enough_ data we can build a theory out of\nit.\"\n\nThen it began to rain. For many minutes the clouds had been piling\nup--black, far-flung, thick and high. Immense bolts of lightning flashed\nand snapped and crackled; thunder crashed and rolled and rumbled; rain\nfell, and continued to fall, like a cloud-burst in Colorado. And shortly\nthereafter--first by square feet and then by acres and then by square\nmiles--the surface of the golop began to die. To die, that is, if it had\never been even partially alive. At least it stopped sparkling, darkened,\nand froze into thick skins; which broke up into blocks; which in turn\nsank--thus exposing an ever-renewed surface to the driving, pelting,\nrelentlessly cascading rain.\n\n\"Well, I don't know that there's anything to hold us here any longer,\"\nGarlock said, finally. \"Shall we go?\"\n\nThey went; but it was several days before any of the wanderers really\nfelt like smiling; and Lola did not recover from her depression for over\na week.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5\n\n\nSupper was over, but the four were still at the table, sipping coffee\nand smoking. During a pause in the casual conversation, James suddenly\nstraightened up.\n\n\"I want an official decision, Clee,\" he said, abruptly. \"While we're out\nof touch with United Worlds you, as captain of the ship and director of\nthe project, are Boss, with a capital B. The Lord of Justice, High and\nLow. The Works. Check?\"\n\n\"On paper, yes; with my decisions subject to appeal and/or review when\nwe get back to Base. In practice, I didn't expect to have to make any\nvery gravid rulings.\"\n\n\"I never thought you'd have to, either, but Belle fed me one with a bone\nin it, so....\"\n\n\"Just a minute. How official do you want it? Full formal, screens down\nand recorded?\"\n\n\"Not unless we have to. Let's explore it first. As of right now, are we\nunder the Code or not?\"\n\n\"Of course we are.\"\n\n\"Not necessarily,\" Belle put in, sharply. \"Not slavishly to the letter.\nWe're so far away and our chance of getting back is so slight that it\nshould be interpreted in the light of common sense.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nGarlock stared at Belle and she stared back, her eyes as clear and\ninnocent as a baby's.\n\n\"The Code is neither long enough nor complicated enough to require\ninterpretation,\" Garlock stated, finally. \"It either applies in full and\nexactly or not at all. My ruling is that the Code applies, strictly,\nuntil I declare the state of Ultimate Contingency. Are you ready, Belle,\nto abandon the project, find an uninhabited Tellurian world, and begin\nto populate it?\"\n\n\"Well, not quite, perhaps.\"\n\n\"Yes or no, please.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"We are under the Code, then. Go ahead, Jim.\"\n\n\"I broke pairing with Belle and she refused to confirm.\"\n\n\"Certainly I refused. He had no reason to break with me.\"\n\n\"I had plenty of reason!\" James snapped. \"I'm fed up to here--\" he drew\nhis right forefinger across his forehead, \"--with making so-called love\nto a woman who can never think of anything except cutting another man's\nthroat. She's a heartless conniver.\"\n\n\"You both know that reasons are unnecessary and are not discussed in\npublic,\" Garlock said, flatly. \"Now as to confirmation of a break. In\nsimple pairing there is no marriage, no registration, no declaration of\nintent or of permanence. Thus, legally or logically, there is no\nobligation. Morally, however, there is always some obligation. Hence, as\na matter of urbanity, in cases where no injury exists except as concerns\nchastity, the Code calls for agreement without rancor. If either party\npersists in refusal to confirm, and cannot show injury, that party's\nbehavior is declared inurbane. Confirmation is declared and the\noffending party is ignored.\"\n\n\"Just how would you go about ignoring Prime Operator Belle Bellamy?\"\n\n\"You've got a point there, Jim. However, she hasn't persisted very long\nin her refusal. As a matter of information, Belle, why did you take Jim\nin the first place?\"\n\n\"I didn't.\" She shrugged her shoulders. \"It was pure chance. You saw me\nflip the tenth-piece.\"\n\n\"Am I to ignore the fact that you are one of the best telekineticists\nliving?\"\n\n\"I don't _have_ to control things unless I want to!\" She stamped her\nfoot. \"Can't you conceive of me flipping a coin honestly?\"\n\n\"No. However, since this is not a screens-down inquiry, I'll give\nyou--orally, at least--the benefit of the doubt. The next step, I\npresume, is for Lola to break with me. Lola?\"\n\n\"Well ... I hate to say this, Clee.... I thought that mutual consent\nwould be better, but....\" Lola paused, flushing in embarrassment.\n\n\"She feels,\" James said, steadily, \"as I do, that there should be much\nmore to the sexual relation than merely releasing the biological\ntensions of two pieces of human machinery. That's hardly civilized.\"\n\n\"I confirm, Lola, of course,\" Garlock said; then went on, partly\nthinking aloud, partly addressing the group at large. \"Ha. Reasons\nagain, and very well put--not off the cuff. Evasions. Flat lies.\nSomething very unfunny here--as queer as a nine-credit bill. In sum,\nindefensible actions based upon unwarranted conclusions drawn from\nerroneous assumptions. The pattern is not clear ... but I won't order\nscreens down until I have to ... if the reason had come from Belle....\"\n\n\"_Me_?\" Belle flared. \"Why from me?\"\n\n\"... instead of Jim....\" Ignoring Belle's interruption, Garlock frowned\nin thought. After a minute or so his face cleared.\n\n\"Jim,\" he said, sharply, \"have you been consciously aware of Belle's\nmanipulation?\"\n\n\"Why, no, of course not. She _couldn't_!\"\n\n\"That's _really_ a brainstorm, Clee,\" Belle sneered. \"You'd better turn\nyourself in for an overhaul.\"\n\n\"Nice scheme, Belle,\" Garlock said. \"I underestimated--at least, didn't\nconsider carefully enough--your power; and overestimated your ethics and\nurbanity.\"\n\n\"What are you talking about, Chief?\" James asked. \"You lost me ten\nparsecs back.\"\n\n\"Just this. Belle is behind this whole operation; working under a\nperfectly beautiful smokescreen.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid the boss is cracking up, kids,\" Belle said. \"Listen to him,\nif you like, but use your own judgment.\"\n\n\"But nobody could make Jim and me really love each other,\" Lola argued,\n\"and we really do. It's real love.\"\n\n\"Admitted,\" Garlock said. \"But she could have helped it along; and she's\nall set to take every possible advantage of the situation thus created.\"\n\n\"I still don't see it,\" James objected. \"Why, she wouldn't even confirm\nour break. She hasn't yet.\"\n\n\"She would have, at the exactly correct psychological moment; after\nholding out long enough to put you both under obligation to her. There\nwould have, also, been certain strings attached. Her plan was, after\nswitching the pairings....\"\n\n\"I wouldn't pair with you,\" Belle broke in viciously, \"if you were the\nonly man left in the macrocosmic universe!\"\n\n\"Part of the smokescreen,\" Garlock explained. \"The re-pairings would\ngive her two lines of attack on me, to be used simultaneously. First, to\nwork on me in bed....\"\n\n\"See?\" Belle interrupted. \"He doesn't think I've got any heart at all.\"\n\n\"Oh, you may have one, but it's no softer than your head, and that could\nscratch a diamond. Second, to work on you two, with no holds barred, to\nform a three-unit team against me. Her charges that I am losing my grip\nmade a very smart opening lead.\"\n\n\"Do you think I'd _let_ her work on me?\" James demanded.\n\n\"She's a Prime--you wouldn't know anything about it. However, nothing\nwill happen. Nor am I going to let her confuse the real issue. Belle,\nyou are either inside the Code or a free agent outside it. Which?\"\n\n\"I have made my position clear.\"\n\n\"To me, yes. To Jim and Lola, decidedly unclear.\"\n\n\"Unclear, then. You can _not_ coerce me!\"\n\n\"If you follow the Code, no. If you don't, I can and will. If you make\nany kind of a pass at Jim James from now on, I'll lock you into your\nroom with a Gunther block.\"\n\n\"_You wouldn't dare_!\" she breathed. \"Besides, you couldn't, not to\nanother prime.\"\n\n\"Don't bet on it,\" he advised.\n\nAfter a full minute of silence Garlock's attitude changed suddenly to\nhis usual one of casual friendliness. \"Why not let this one drop right\nhere, Belle? I can marry them, with all the official trimmings. Why not\nlet 'em really enjoy their honeymoon?\"\n\n\"Why not?\" Belle's manner changed to match Garlock's and she smiled\nwarmly. \"I confirm, Jim. You two are really serious, aren't you?\nMarriage, declarations, registration, and everything? I wish--I\nsincerely and really wish you--every happiness possible.\"\n\n\"We really _are_ serious,\" James said, putting his arm around Lola's\nwaist. \"And you won't ... won't interfere?\"\n\n\"Not a bit. I couldn't, now, even if I wanted to.\" Belle grinned wryly.\n\"You see, you kids missed the main feature of the show, since you can't\nknow exactly what a Prime Operator is. Especially you can't know what\nCleander Simmsworth Garlock really is--he's an out-and-out tiger on\nwheels. The three of us could have smacked him bow-legged, but of course\nall chance of that blew up just now. So if you two want to take the big\njump you can do it with my blessing as well as Clee's. I'll clear the\ntable.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nThat small chore taken care of--a quick folding-up of everything into\nthe tablecloth and a heave into the chute did it--Belle set up the\nrecorder.\n\n\"Are you both fully certain that you want the full treatment?\" Garlock\nasked.\n\nBoth were certain, and Garlock read the brief but solemn marriage lines.\n\nAs the newlyweds left the room, Belle turned to Garlock with a quizzical\nsmile. \"Are you going to ask me to pair with you, Clee?\"\n\n\"I certainly am.\" He grinned back at her. \"I owe you that much revenge,\nat least. But seriously, I'd like it immensely and we fit like Grace and\nPoise. Look at that mirror. Did you ever see a better-matched couple?\nWill you give me a try, Belle?\"\n\n\"I will not,\" she said, emphatically. I'll take back what I said a while\nago--if you were really the only man left, I would--but as it is, the\nanswer is a definite, resounding, and final '_No_'.\"\n\n\"'Definite' and 'resounding,' yes. 'Final,' I won't accept. I'll wait.\"\n\n\"You'll wait a long time, Buster. My door will be locked from now on.\nGood night, Doctor Garlock, I'm going to bed.\"\n\n\"So am I.\" He walked with her along the corridor to their rooms, the\ndoors of which were opposite each other. \"In view of the Code, locking\nyour door is a meaningless gesture. Mine will remain unlocked. I invite\nyou to come in whenever you like, and assure you formally that no such\nentry will be regarded as an invasion of privacy.\"\n\nWithout a word she went into her room and closed the door with a\nfirmness just short of violence. Her lock clicked sharply.\n\n        *           *           *\n\nThe next morning, after breakfast, James followed Garlock into his room\nand shut the door.\n\n\"Clee, I want to tell you.... I don't want to get sloppy but....\"\n\n\"Want to lep it?\"\n\n\"Hell, no!\"\n\n\"It's about Brownie, then.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh. I've always liked you immensely. Admired you. Hero, sort\nof....\"\n\n\"Yeah. I quote. 'Harder than Pharaoh's heart.' 'Colder than frozen\nhelium,' and all the rest. But this thing about Brownie....\" He reached\nout; two hard hands met in a crushing grip. \"How could you possibly lay\noff? Just the strain, if nothing else.\"\n\n\"A little strain doesn't hurt a man unless he lets it. I've done without\nfor months at a stretch, with it running around loose on all sides of\nme.\"\n\n\"But she's so ... she's got _everything_!\"\n\n\"There speaketh the ensorcelled bridegroom. For my taste, she hasn't.\nShe told you, I suppose, when explaining a certain fact, that I told her\nshe wasn't my type?\"\n\n\"Yes, but....\"\n\n\"She still isn't. She's a very fine person, with a very fine\npersonality. She is one of the two most nearly perfect young women of\nher race. Her face is beautiful. Her body is an artist's dream. Her mind\nis one of the very best. Besides all that, she's a very good egg and a\nmighty tasty dish. But put yourself in my place.\n\n        *           *           *\n\n\"Here's this paragon we have just described. She has extremely high\nideals and she's a virgin; never really aroused. Also, she's so full of\nthis sickening crap they've been pouring into us--propaganda,\nrocket-oil, prop-wash, and psychological gobbledygook--that it's running\nout of her ears. She's so stuffed with it that she's going to pair with\nyou, ideals and virginity be damned, even if it kills her; even though\nshe's shaking, clear down to her shoes--scared yellow. Also, she is and\nalways will be scared half to death of you--she thinks you're some kind\nof robot. She's a starry-eyed, soft-headed sissy. A sapadilla. A sucker\nfor a smooth line of balloon-juice and flapdoodle. No spine; no bottom.\nA gutless doll-baby. Strictly a pet--you could no more love her, ever,\nthan you could a half-grown kitten....\"\n\n\"That's a _hell_ of a picture!\" James broke in savagely. \"Even with your\ncold-blooded reputation.\"\n\n\"People in love can't be objective, is all. If I saw her through the\nsame set of filters you do, I'd be in love with her, too. So let's see\nif you can use your brain instead of your outraged sensibilities to\nanswer a hypothetical question. If the foregoing were true, what would\n_you_ do, Junior?\"\n\n\"I'd pass, I guess. I'd have to, if I wanted to look at myself in the\nmirror next morning. But that's such an _ungodly_ cockeyed picture,\nClee.... But if that's actually your picture of Brownie--and you're no\npart of a liar--just what kind of a woman could you love? If any?\"\n\n\"Belle.\"\n\n\"_Belle_! Belle _Bellamy_? Hell's flaming furies! That iceberg? That\negomaniac? That Jezebel? She's the hardest-boiled babe that ever went\nunhung.\"\n\n\"Right, on all counts. Also she's crooked and treacherous. She's a\nground-and-lofty liar by instinct and training. I could add a lot more.\nBut she's got brains, ability, and guts--guts enough to supply the\nWomen's Army Corps. She's got the spine and the bottom and the drive. So\njust imagine her thawed out and really shoveling on the coal--blasting\nwide open on all forty torches. Back to back with you when you're\nsurrounded; she wouldn't cave and she wouldn't give. Or wing and\nwing--holding the beam come hell or space-warps. Roll that one around on\nyour tongue, Jim, and give your taste-buds a treat.\"\n\n\"Well, maybe ... if I've got that much imagination ... that's a tough\nblueprint to read. I can't quite visualize the finished article.\nHowever, you're as hard as she is--even harder. You've got more of what\nit takes. Maybe _you_ can make a Christian out of her. If so, you might\nhave something; but I'm damned if I can see exactly what. Whatever it\nturned out to be, I wouldn't care for any part of it. You could have it\nall.\"\n\n\"Exactly; and you can have your Brownie.\"\n\n\"I'm beginning to see. I didn't think you had anything like that in your\nchilled-steel carcass. And I want to apolo....\"\n\n\"Don't do it, boy. If the time ever comes when _you_ go so soft on me as\nto quit laying it on the line and start sifting out your language....\"\nGarlock paused. For one of the very few times in his life, he was at a\nloss for words. He thrust his hands into his pockets and shrugged his\nshoulders. \"Hell, I don't want to get maudlin, either ... so ... well,\nhow many men, do you think, could have gone the route with me on this\nhellish job without killing me or me killing them?\"\n\n\"Oh, that's not....\"\n\n\"Lay it on the line, Jim. I know what I am. Just one. You. One man in\nsix thousand million. Okay; how many women could live with me for a year\nwithout going crazy?\"\n\n\"Lots of 'em; but, being masochists, they'd probably drive _you_ nuts.\nAnd you can't stand 'stupidity'; which, by definition, lets _everybody_\nout. Nope, it's a tough order to fill.\"\n\n\"Check. She'd have to be strong enough and hard enough not to be afraid\nof me, by any trace. Able and eager to stand up to me and slug it out.\nTo pin my ears back flat against my skull whenever she thinks I'm off\nthe beam. Do it with skill and precision and nicety, with power and\ncontrol; yet without doing herself any damage and without changing her\nbasic feeling for me. In short, a female Jim James Nine.\"\n\n\"Huh? Hell's blowtorches! You think _I'm_ like Belle Bellamy?\"\n\n\"Not by nine thousand megacycles. Like Belle Bellamy could be and should\nbe. Like I hope she will be. I'd have to give, too, of course--maybe we\ncan make Christians out of each other. It's quite a dream, I admit, but\nit'll be Belle or nobody. But I'm not used to slopping over this\nway--let's go.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you did, big fellow--once in a lifetime is good for the soul.\nI'd say you were in love with her right now--except that if you were,\nyou couldn't possibly dissect her like a specimen on the table, the way\nyou've just been doing. Are you or aren't you?\"\n\n\"I'll be damned if I know. You and Brownie believe that the poets'\nconcept of love is valid. In fact, you make a case for its validity. I\nnever have, and don't now ... but under certain conditions ... I simply\ndon't know. Ask me again sometime; say in about a month?\"\n\n\"That's the surest thing you know. Oh, _brother! This_ is a thing I'm\ngoing to watch with my eyes out on stalks!\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nFor the next week, Belle locked her door every night. For another few\nnights, she did not lock it. Then, one night, she left it ajar. The\nfollowing evening, the two again walked together to their doors.\n\n\"I left my door open last night.\"\n\n\"I know you did.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"And have you scream to high heaven that I opened it? And put me on a\ntape for willful inurbanity? For deliberate intersexual invasion of\nprivacy?\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\n\"Blast and damn! You know perfectly well, Clee Garlock, I wouldn't pull\nsuch a dirty, lousy trick as that.\"\n\n\"Maybe I should apologize, then, but as a matter of fact I have no idea\nwhatever as to what you wouldn't do.\" He stared at her, his face hard in\nthought. \"As you probably know, I have had very little to do with women.\nThat little has always been on a logical level. You are such a\ncompletely new experience that I can't figure out what makes you tick.\"\n\n\"So you're afraid of me,\" she sneered. \"Is that it?\"\n\n\"Close enough.\"\n\n\"And I suppose it's you that cartoonist what's-his-name is using as a\nmodel for 'Timorous Timmy'?\"\n\n\"Since you've guessed it, yes.\"\n\n\"You ... you _weasel_!\" She took three quick steps up the corridor, then\nback. \"You say my logic is cockeyed. What system are you using now?\"\n\n\"I'm trying to develop one to match yours.\"\n\n\"Oh ... I invited that one, I guess, since I know you aren't afraid of\nGod, man, woman, or devil ... and you're big enough so you don't have to\nbe proving it all the time.\" She laughed suddenly, her face softening\nmarkedly. \"Listen, you big lug. Why don't you ever knock me into an\noutside loop? If I were you and you were me, I'd've busted me loose from\nmy front teeth long ago.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure whether I know better or am afraid to. Anyway, I'm not\nrocking any boat so far from shore.\"\n\n\"Says you. You're wonderful, Clee--simply priceless. Do you know you're\nthe only man I ever met that I couldn't make fall for me like a rock\nfalling down a cliff? And that the falling is altogether too apt to be\nthe other way?\"\n\n\"The first, I have suspected. The second is chemically-pure rocket-oil.\"\n\n\"I _hope_ it is.... I wish I could be as certain of it as you are....\nYou see, Clee, I really expected you to come in, last night, and there\nreally _wasn't_ any bone in it. Surely, you don't think I'm going to\n_invite_ you into my room, do you?\"\n\n\"I can't see why not. However, since no valid system of logic seems to\napply, I accept your decision as a fact. By the same reasoning--however\ninvalid--if I ask you again you will again refuse. So all that's left, I\nguess, is for me to drag you into my room by force.\"\n\nHe put his left arm around her and applied a tiny pressure against her\nside; under which she began to move slowly toward his door.\n\n\"You admit that you're using force?\" she asked. Her face was unreadable;\nher mental block was at its fullest force. \"That I'm being coerced?\nDefinitely?\"\n\n\"Definitely,\" he agreed. \"At least ten dynes of sheer brute force. Not\nenough to affect a tape, but enough, I hope, to affect you. If it isn't,\nI'll use more.\"\n\n\"Oh, ten dynes is enough. Just so it's force.\"\n\nShe raised her face toward his and threw both arms around his neck. His\nright arm went into action with his left, and Cleander Garlock forgot\nall about dynes and tapes.\n\nAfter a time she disengaged one arm; reached out; opened his door. He\ngathered her up and, lips still locked to lips, carried her over the\nthreshold.\n\n        *           *           *\n\nA few jumps later they met their first really old Arpalone. This\nInspector was so old that his skin, instead of the usual bright, clear\ncobalt blue, was dull and tending toward gray. The old fellow was\nstrangely garrulous, for a Guardian; he wanted them to pause a while and\ngossip.\n\n\"Yes, I am lonesome,\" he admitted. \"It has been a long time since I\nexchanged thoughts with anyone. You see, nobody has visited this\nplanet--Groobe, its name is--since almost all our humanity was killed, a\nfew periods ago....\"\n\n\"Killed? How?\" Garlock asked sharply. \"Not Dilipic?\"\n\n\"Oh, you have seen them? I never have, myself. No, nothing nearly that\nbad. Merely the Ozobes. The world itself was scarcely harmed at all.\nRehabilitation will be a simple matter, so there's no real reason why\nsome of those Engineers....\"\n\n\"The beast!\" Lola shot a tight-beam thought at her husband. \"Who cares\nanything about the rock and dirt of a _planet_? It's the people that\ncount and his are dead and he's perfectly _complaisant_ about it--just\n_lonesome_!\"\n\n\"Don't let it throw you, pet,\" James soothed. \"He's an Arpalone, you\nknow; not a sociological anthropologist.\"\n\n\"... shouldn't come out here and spend a few hours once in a while, but\nthey don't. Too busy with their own business, they say. But while you\nare physically human, mentally you are not. You're all too ... too ... I\ncan't put my thought exactly on it, but ... more as though you were\nhuman fighters, if such a thing could be possible.\"\n\n\"We are fighters. Where we come from, most human beings are fighters.\"\n\n\"Oh? I never heard of such a thing. Where can you be from?\"\n\nThis took much explanation, since the Arpalone had never heard of\ninter-galactic travel. \"You are willing, then, to fight side by side\nwith us Arpalones against the enemies of humanity? You have actually\ndone so, at times, and won?\"\n\n\"We certainly have.\"\n\n\"I am glad. I am expecting a call for help any time now. Will you please\ngive me enough of your mental pattern, Doctor Garlock, so that I can\ncall you in case of need? Thank you.\"\n\n\"What makes you think you're going to get an S.O.S. so soon? Where\nfrom?\"\n\n\"Because these Ozobe invasions come in cycles, years apart, but there\nare always several planets attacked at very nearly the same time. We\nwere the first, this time; so there will be one or two others very\nshortly.\"\n\n\"Do they always ... kill all the people?\" Lola asked.\n\n\"Oh, no. Scarcely half of the time. Depends on how many fighters the\nplanet has, and how much outside help can get there soon enough.\"\n\n\"Your call could come from any of the other solar systems in this\nneighborhood, then?\" Garlock asked.\n\n\"Yes. There are fifteen inhabited planets within about six light-years\nof us, and we form a close-knit group.\"\n\n\"What are these Ozobes?\"\n\n\"Animals. Warm-blooded, but egg-layers, not mammals. Like this,\" and the\nInspector spread in their minds a picture of a creature somewhat like\nthe flying tigers of Hodell, except that the color was black, shading\noff to iridescent green at the extremities. Also, it was armed with a\nshort and heavy, but very sharp, sting.\n\n\"They say that they come from space, but I don't believe it,\" the old\nfellow went on. \"What would a warm-blood be doing out in space? Besides,\nthey couldn't find anybody to lay their eggs in out there. No, sir, I\nthink they live right here on Groobe somewhere, maybe holed up in caves\nor something for ten or thirteen years ... but that wouldn't make sense,\neither, would it? I just don't know....\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nGarlock finally broke away from the lonesome Inspector and the\n_Pleiades_ started down.\n\n\"That's the most utterly _horrible_ thing I ever heard of in my life!\"\nLola burst out. \"Like wasps--only worse--_people_ aren't bugs! Why don't\nall the planets get together and develop something to kill every Ozobe\nin every system of the group?\"\n\n\"That one has got too many bones in it for me to answer,\" James said.\n\n\"I'm going to get hold of that Engineer as soon as we land,\" Lola said,\ndarkly, \"and stick a pin into him.\"\n\nThey found the Engineering Office easily enough, in a snug camp well\noutside a large city. They grounded the starship and went out on foot;\nenjoying contact with solid ground. The Head Engineer was an Arpalone,\ntoo--Engineers were not a separate race, but dwellers on a planet of\nextremely high technology--but he did know anything about space-drives.\nHis specialty was rehabilitation; he was top boss of a rehab crew....\n\n        *           *           *\n\nThen Lola pushed Garlock aside. Yes, the Ozobes came from space. He was\nsure of it. Yes, they laid eggs in human bodies. Yes, they probably\nstayed alive quite a while--or might, except for the rehab crew. No, he\ndidn't _know_ what would hatch out--he'd never let one live that long,\nbut what the hell else _could_ hatch except Ozobes? No, not one. Not one\nsingle damn one. If just one ever did, on any world where he bossed the\njob, he'd lose his job as boss and go to the mines for half a year....\n\n\"Ridiculous!\" Lola snapped. \"If Ozobes hatched, they couldn't possibly\nhave come from space. If they _did_ come from space, the adult form\nwould have to be something able to get back into space, some way or\nother. _That_ is simple elementary biology. Don't you see that?\"\n\nHe didn't see it. He didn't give a damn, either. It was none of his\nbusiness; he was a rehab man.\n\nLola ran back to the ship in disgust.\n\n\"Something else is even more ridiculous, and _is_ your business,\" James\ntold the Head Engineer. \"Garlock and I are both engineers--top ones. We\nknow definitely that a one-hundred-percent clean-up on such a job as\nthis--millions--simply can't be done. Ever. Under any conditions. Are\nyou lying in your teeth or are you dumb enough to believe it yourself?\"\n\n\"Neither one,\" the Engineer insisted, stubbornly. \"I've wondered,\nmyself, at how I could get 'em all, but I always do--every time so far.\nThat's why they give me the big job. I'm good at it.\"\n\n\"Oh--Lola's right, Jim,\" Garlock said. \"It's the adult form that\nhatches; something so different they don't even recognize it. Something\nable to get into space. Enough survivors to produce the next\ngeneration.\"\n\n\"Sure. I'll tell Brownie--she'll be tickled.\"\n\n\"She'll be more than tickled--she'll want to hunt up somebody around\nhere with three brain cells working and give 'em an earful.\" Then, to\nthe Engineer, \"Do you know how they rehab a planet that's been leveled\nflat by the golop?\"\n\n\"You've _seen_ one? I never have, but of course I've studied it. Slow,\nbut not too difficult. After killing, the stuff weathers down in a few\nyears--wonderful soil it makes--what makes it slow is that you have to\nwait fifty or a hundred years for the mountains to get built up again\nand for the earthquakes to quit....\"\n\n\"Excuse me, please--I've got a call--we have to leave, right now.\"\n\nThe call was from the Inspector. The nearest planet, Clamer, was being\ninvaded by the Ozobes and needed all the help they could get.\n\n        *           *           *\n\nIn seconds the _Pleiades_ was at the Port of Entry.\n\n\"Where is this Clamer?\" Garlock asked.\n\nThe Inspector pointed a thought; all four followed it.\n\n\"Let's go, Jim. Maybe....\"\n\n\"Just a minute!\" Lola snapped. She was breathing hard, her eyes were\nalmost shooting sparks as she turned to the old Arpalone and drove a\nthought so forcibly that he winced.\n\n\"Do you so-called 'Guardians of Humanity' care at all about the humanity\nyou're supposed to be protecting?\" she demanded viciously, the thought\nboring in and twisting, \"or are you just loafing on the job and doing as\nlittle as you possibly can without getting fired?\"\n\nBelle and Garlock looked at each other and grinned. James was surprised\nand shocked. This woman blowing her top was no Brownie Montandon any of\nthem knew.\n\n\"We do everything we possibly can,\" the Inspector was not only shocked,\nbut injured and abused. \"If there's any one possible thing we haven't\ndone, even the tiniest....\"\n\n\"There's plenty!\" she snapped. \"Plain, dumb stupidity, then, it must be.\nThere must be _somebody_ around here who has been at least exposed to\nelementary biology! You should have exterminated these Ozobe vermin ages\nago. All you have to do is find out what its life cycle is. How many\nstages and what they are. How the adults get into space and where they\ngo,\" and she went on, in flashing thoughts, to explain in full detail.\n\n\"Are you smart enough to understand that?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. Your thought may be the truth, at that.\"\n\n\"And are you interested enough to find out whose business it would be,\nand follow through on it?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course. If it works, I'll be quite famous for suggesting it.\nI'll give you part of the credit....\"\n\n\"Keep the credit--just see to it that it gets _done_!\" She whirled on\nJames. \"This loss of human life is so _appallingly_ unnecessary! This\ntime we're going to Clamer, and nowhere else. Push the button, Jim.\"\n\n\"All I can do is set up for it, pet. Whether we....\"\n\n\"We'll get there!\" she blazed. \"It's high time we got a break. _Punch_\nit! _This_ time the ship's going to _Clamer_, if we have to all get out\nand _push_ it there! Now punch that button!\"\n\nJames pushed the button, glanced into his scanner, and froze; eyes\nstaring. He did not even whistle. Belle, however, did; with\near-shattering volume. Garlock's mouth fell open in the biggest surprise\nof his life. They were in the same galaxy!\n\nAll three had studied charts of nebular configurations so long and so\nintensely that recognition of a full-sphere identity was automatic and\ninstantaneous.\n\nLola, head buried in scanner, had already checked in with the Port\nInspector.\n\n\"It _is_ Clamer!\" she shrieked aloud. \"I _told_ you it was time for our\nluck to change, if we pulled hard enough! They are being invaded by\nOzobes and they did call for help and they didn't think we could\npossibly get here this fast and we don't need to be inspected because\nwe're compatible or we couldn't have landed on Groobe!\"\n\nFor five long minutes Garlock held the starship motionless while he\nstudied the entire situation. Then he drove a probe through the mental\nshield of the general in charge of the whole defense operation.\n\n\"Battle-Cruiser _Pleiades_, Captain Garlock commanding, reporting for\nduty in response to your S.O.S. received on Groobe.\"\n\nThe general, furiously busy as he was, dropped all other business. \"But\nyou're _human_! You can't fight!\"\n\n\"Watch us. You don't know, apparently, that the Ozobe bases are on the\nfar side of your moon. They're bringing their fighters in most of the\nway in transports.\"\n\n\"Why, they can't be! They're coming in from all directions from deep\nspace!\"\n\n\"That's what they want you to think. They're built to stand many hours\nof zero pressure and almost absolute zero cold. Question: if we destroy\nall their transport, say in three hours, can you handle all the fighters\nwho will be in the air or in nearby space at that time?\"\n\n\"Very easily. They've hardly started yet. I appoint you Admiral-pro-tem\nGarlock, in command of Space Operations, and will refer to you any other\nspace-fighters who may come. I thank you, sir. Good luck.\"\n\nThe general returned his attention to his boiling office. His mind was\nseething with questions as to what these not-human beings were, how or\nif they knew so much, and so on; but he forced them out of his mind and\nwent, fast and efficient, back to work. James shot the _Pleiades_ up to\nwithin a thousand miles or so of the moon.\n\n\"How long does it take to learn this bombing business, Jim?\" Lola asked.\n\n\"About fifteen seconds. All you have to do is _want_ to. Do you,\nreally?\"\n\n\"I really do. If I don't do something to help these people,\" it did not\noccur to her that she had already done a tremendous job, \"I'll never\nforgive myself.\"\n\nJames showed her; and, much to her surprise, she found it very easy to\ndo.\n\n        *           *           *\n\nThe vessels transporting the invading forces were huge, spherical shells\nequipped with short-range drives--and with nothing else. No\naccommodations, no facilities, no food, no water, not even any air. Each\ntransport, when filled to the bursting-point with as-yet-docile cargo,\ndarted away; swinging around to approach Clamer from some\npreviously-assigned direction. It did not, however, approach the\nplanet's surface. At about two thousand miles out, great ports opened\nand the load was dumped out into space, to fall the rest of the way by\ngravity. Then the empty shell, with only its one pilot aboard, rushed\nback for another load.\n\n\"How heavy shots, Clee?\" James asked. He and Lola were getting into\ntheir scanners. \"Wouldn't take as much as a kiloton equivalent, would\nit?\"\n\n\"Half a kilo is plenty, but no use being too fussy about precision out\nhere.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nGarlock and Belle were already bombing; James and Lola began. Slow and\nawkward at first, Lola soon picked up the technique and was firing blast\nfor blast with the others. No more loaded transport vessels left the\nmoon. No empty one, returning toward the moon, reached there. In much\nless than the three hours Garlock had mentioned, every Ozobian transport\ncraft had been destroyed.\n\n\"And now the real job begins,\" Garlock said, as James dropped the\nstarship down to within a few miles of the moon's surface.\n\nThat surface was cratered and jagged, exactly like that of the half\nalways facing Clamer. No sign of activity could be seen by eye, nor\nanything unusual. Even the immense trap-doors, all closed now, matched\nexactly their surroundings. Underground, however, activity was violently\nintense; and, now, confused in the extreme.\n\n\"Why, there isn't a single adult anywhere!\" Lola exclaimed. \"I thought\nthe whole place would be full of 'em!\"\n\n\"So did I,\" Belle said. \"However, by hindsight, it's plain enough. Their\njob done, they were killed and eaten. Last meal, perhaps.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid so. Whatever they were, they had hands and brains. Just\n_look_ at those shops and machines!\"\n\n\"What do we do, boss?\" James asked. \"Run a search pattern first?\"\n\n\"We'll have to, I guess, before we can lay the job out.\"\n\nIt was run and Garlock frowned in thought. \"Almost half the moon\ncovered--honeycombed. We'll have to fine-tooth it. Around the periphery\nfirst, then spiral into the center. This moon isn't very big, but even\nso this is going to be a hell of a long job. Any suggestions, anybody?\nJim?\"\n\n\"The only way, I guess. You can't do it hit-or-miss. I'm _damn_ glad\nwe've got plenty of stuff in our Op field and plenty of hydride for the\nengines. The horses will all know they've been at work before they get\nthe field filled up again.\"\n\n\"So will you, Junior, believe me.... Ready, all? Start blasting.\"\n\nThen, for three hours, the _Pleiades_ moved slowly--for her--along a\nplotted and automatically-controlled course. It was very easy to tell\nwhere she had been; the sharply-cut, evenly-spaced, symmetrical pits\nleft by the Galaxian's full-conversion blasts were entirely different\nfrom the irregularly-cratered, ages-old original surface.\n\n\"Knock off, Brownie,\" Garlock said then. \"Go eat all you can hold and\nget some sleep. Come back in three hours. Jim, cut our speed to\nseventy-five percent.\"\n\nLola shed her scanner, heaved a tremendous sigh of relief, and\ndisappeared.\n\nThree silent hours later--all three were too intensely busy to think of\nanything except the work in hand--Lola came back.\n\n\"Take Belle's swath, Brownie. Okay, Belle, you can lay off. Three\nhours.\"\n\n\"I'll stay,\" Belle declared. \"Go yourself; or send Jim.\"\n\n\"Don't be any more of a damn fool than you have to. I said beat it.\"\n\n\"And I said I wouldn't. I'm just as good....\"\n\n\"Chop it off!\" Garlock snapped. \"It isn't a case of being just as good\nas. It's a matter of physical reserves. Jim and I have more to draw on\nfor the long shifts than you have. So get the hell out of here or I'll\nstop the ship and slap you even sillier than you are now.\"\n\nBelle threw up her head, tossing her shoulder-length green mop in her\ncharacteristic gesture of defiance; but after holding Garlock's hard\nstare for a moment she relaxed and smiled.\n\n\"Okay, Clee--and thanks for the kind words.\"\n\nShe disappeared and the work went on.\n\nAnd finally, when all four were so groggy that they could scarcely\nthink, the job was done and checked. Clamer's moon was as devoid of life\nas any moon had ever been.\n\n        *           *           *\n\nLola pitched her scanner at its rack and threw herself face-down on a\ndavenport, sobbing uncontrollably. James sat down beside her and soothed\nher until she quieted down.\n\n\"You'd better eat something, sweetheart, and then for a good, long\nsleep.\"\n\n\"Eat? Why, I couldn't, Jim, not possibly.\"\n\n\"Let her sleep first, I think, Jim,\" Belle said, and followed with her\neyes as Jim picked his wife up and carried her into the corridor.\n\n\"We'd better eat _something_, I suppose,\" Belle said, thoughtfully. \"I\ndon't feel like eating, either, but I never realized until this minute\njust how much this has taken out of me and I'd better start putting it\nback in.... She did a wonderful job, Clee, even if she couldn't take it\nfull shift toward the last.\"\n\n\"I'll say she did. I hated like the devil to let her work that way, but\n... you knew I was scared witless every second until we topped off.\"\n\nExhausted and haggard as she was, Belle laughed. \"I know damn-blasted\nwell you weren't; but I know what you mean. Fighting something you don't\nknow anything about, and can't guess what may happen next, is tough.\nSeconds count.\" Side by side, they strolled toward the alcove.\n\n\"I simply didn't think she had it in her,\" Belle marveled.\n\n\"She didn't. She hasn't. It'll take her a week to get back into shape.\"\n\n\"Right. She was going on pure nerve at the last--nothing else ... but\nshe did a job, and she's so sweet and fine.... I wonder, Clee, if ... if\nI've been missing the boat....\"\n\n\"You have not.\" Garlock sent the thought so solidly that Belle jumped.\n\"If you'd just let yourself be, you'd be worth a million of her, just as\nyou stand.\"\n\n\"Yes? You lie in your teeth, Cleander, but I love it.... Oh, I don't\nknow what I want to eat--if anything.\"\n\n\"I'll think up yours, too, along with mine.\"\n\n\"Please. Something light, and just a little.\"\n\n\"Yeah. Sit down. Just a light snack--a two-pound steak, rare; a bowl of\nmushrooms fried in butter; French fries, french dips, salad, and a quart\nof coffee. The same for me, except more of each. Here we are.\"\n\n\"Why, Clee, I couldn't _possibly_ eat half of that....\" Then, after a\nquarter of it was gone, \"I _am_ hungry, at that--simply ravenous. I\ncould eat a horse and saddle, and chase the rider.\"\n\n\"That's what I thought. I knew I could, and figured you accordingly.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nThey ate those tremendous meals slowly, enjoying every bite and sip; in\nan atmosphere of friendliness and good fellowship; chatting on a wide\nvariety of subjects as they ate. Neither was aware of the fact that this\nwas the first time they had ever been on _really_ friendly terms. And\nfinally every dish and container was empty, almost polished clean.\n\n\"One hundred percent capacity--can chew but can't swallow,\" Garlock said\nthen, lighting two cigarettes and giving Belle one. \"How's that for a\nmasterly job of calibration?\"\n\n\"Me, too. It'll pass.\" Belle sighed in repletion. \"Your ability to\nestimate the exact capacity of containers is exceeded only by your good\nlooks and by the size of your feet. And now to hit the good old sack for\nan indefinite but very long period of time.\"\n\n\"You chirped it, birdie.\" Still eminently friendly, the two walked\ntogether to their doors. Belle put up a solid block and paused,\nirresolute, twisting the toe of one slipper into the carpet.\n\n\"Clee, I ... I wonder ... if....\" Her voice died away.\n\n\"I know what you mean.\" He put his arms around her gently, tenderly, and\nlooked deep into her eyes. \"I want to tell you something, Belle. You're\na woman, not in seven thousand million women, but in that many planets\nfull of women. What it takes, you very definitely and very abundantly\nhave got. And you aren't the only one that's pooped. I don't need\ncompany tonight, either. I'm going to sleep until I wake up, if it takes\nall day. Or say, if you wake up first, why not punch me and we'll have\nbreakfast together?\"\n\n\"That's a thought. Do the same for me. Good night, Clee.\"\n\n\"Good night, ace.\" He kissed her, as gently as he had been holding her,\nopened her door, closed it after her, and stepped across the corridor\ninto his own room.\n\n\"_What_ a man!\" Belle breathed to herself, behind the solid screens of\nher room. \"He thought I was too tired, not just scared to death too.\nWhat a _man_! Belle Bellamy, you ought to be kicked from here to\nTellus....\" Then she threw back her head, drove a hard little fist into\na pillow, and spoke aloud through clenched teeth. \"No, damn and blast\nit, I _won't_ give in. I _won't_ love him. I'll take the Project away\nfrom him if it's the last thing I ever do in this life!\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nShe woke up the next morning--not morning, either, since it was well\nafter noon--a little before Garlock did, but not much. When she went\ninto his room he was shaved and fully dressed except for one shoe, which\nhe was putting on.\n\n\"Hi, boss! Better we eat, huh? Not only am I starving by inches, but if\nwe don't eat pretty quick we'll get only one meal today instead of\nthree. Did you eat your candy bar?\"\n\n\"I sure did, ace.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm still 'ace'? You can kiss me, then,\" and she raised her face\ntoward his.\n\nHe kissed her, still tenderly, and they strolled to and through the Main\nand into the alcove. James and Lola, the latter looking terribly\nstrained and worn, had already eaten, but joined them in their\nafter-breakfast coffee and cigarettes.\n\n\"You've checked, of course,\" Garlock said. \"Everything on the beam?\"\n\n\"Dead center. Even to Lola and her biologists. Everybody's full of joy\nand gratitude and stuff--as well as information. And we managed to pry\nourselves loose without waking you two trumpet-of-doom sleepers up. So\nwe're ready to jump again. I wonder where in _hell_ we'll wind up _this_\ntime.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you said that, Jim.\" Garlock said. \"It gives me the nerve to\nspring a thing on you that I've been mulling around in my mind ever\nsince we landed here.\"\n\n\"Nerve? You?\" James asked, incredulously. \"Pass the coffee-pot around\nagain, Brownie. If that character there said what I heard him say,\nthis'll make your hair stand straight up on end.\"\n\n\"On our jumps we've had altogether too much power and no control\nwhatever....\" Garlock paused in thought.\n\n\"Like a rookie pitcher,\" Belle suggested.\n\n\"Uh-uh,\" Lola objected. \"It _couldn't_ be that wild. He'd have to stand\nwith his back to the plate and pitch the ball over the center-field\nstands and seven blocks down-town.\"\n\n\"Cut the persiflage, you two,\" Garlock ordered. \"Consider three things.\nFirst, as you all know, I've been trying to figure out a generator that\nwould give us intrinsic control, but I haven't got any farther with it\nthan we did back on Tellus. Second, consider all the jumps we've made\nexcept this last one. Every time we've taken off, none of us has had his\nshield really up. You, Jim, were concentrating on the drive, and so were\nwide open to it. The rest of us were at least thinking about it, and so\nwere more or less open to it. Not one of us has ever ordered it to take\nus to any definite place; in fact, I don't believe that anyone of us has\never even suggested a destination. Each one of us has been thinking, at\nthe instant of energization of the fields, exactly what you just said,\nand with exactly the same emphasis.\n\n\"Third, consider this last jump all by itself. It's the first time we've\never stayed in the same galaxy. It's the first time we've ever gone\nwhere we wanted to. And it's the first time--here's the crux, as I see\nit--that any of us has been concentrating on any destination at the\nmoment of firing the charge. Brownie was willing the _Pleiades_ to this\nplanet so hard that we all could taste it. The rest of us, if not really\npushing to get here, were at least not opposed to the idea. Check?\"\n\n\"Check.\" \"That's right.\" \"Yes, I was pushing with all my might,\" came\nfrom the three listeners, and James went on:\n\n\"Are you saying the damn thing's _alive_?\"\n\n\"No. I'm saying I don't believe in miracles. I don't believe in\ncoincidence--that concept is as meaningless as that of paradox. I\ncertainly do _not_ believe that we hit this planet by chance against\nodds of almost infinity to one. So I've been looking for a reason. I\nfound one. It goes against my grain--against everything I've ever\nbelieved--but, since it's the only possible explanation, it must be\ntrue. The only possible director of the Gunther Drive _must_ be the\nmind.\"\n\n\"Hell's blowtorches--Now you're _insisting_ that the damn thing's\nalive.\"\n\n\"Far from it. It's Brownie who's alive. It was Brownie who got us here.\nNothing else--repeat, _nothing_ else--makes sense.\"\n\nJames pondered for a full minute. \"I wouldn't buy it except for one\nthing. If you, the hardest-boiled skeptic that ever went unhung, can\nfeed yourself the whole bowl of such a mess as that, I can at least take\na taste of it. Shoot.\"\n\n\"Okay. You know that we don't know anything really fundamental about\neither teleportation or the drive. I'm sure now that the drive is simply\nmechanical teleportation. If you tried to 'port yourself without any\nidea of where you wanted to go, where do you think you'd land?\"\n\n\"You might scatter yourself all over space--no, you wouldn't. You\nwouldn't move, because it wouldn't be teleportation at all. Destination\nis an integral part of the concept.\"\n\n\"Exactly so--but only because you've been conditioned to it all your\nlife. This thing hasn't been conditioned to anything.\"\n\n\"Like a new-born baby,\" Lola suggested.\n\n\"Life again,\" James said. \"I can't see it--too many bones in it. Pure\nluck, even at those odds, makes a lot more sense.\"\n\n\"And to make matters worse,\" Garlock went on as though neither of them\nhad spoken. \"Just suppose that a man had four minds instead of one and\nthey weren't working together. Then where would he go?\"\n\nThis time, James simply whistled; the girls stared, speechless.\n\n\"I think we've proved that my school of mathematics was right--the thing\nwas built to operate purely at random. Fotheringham was wrong. However,\nI missed the point that if control is possible, the controller must be a\nmind. Such a possibility never occurred to me or anyone working with me.\nOr to Fotheringham or to anybody else.\"\n\n\"I can't say I'm sold, but it's easy to test and the results can't be\nany worse. Let's go.\"\n\n\"How would you test it?\"\n\n\"Same way you would. Only way. First, each one of us alone. Then pairs\nand threes. Then all four together. Fifteen tests in all. No. Three\ndestinations for each set-up; near, medium, and far. Except Tellus, of\ncourse; we'd better save that shot until we learn all we can find out.\nEverybody not in the set should screen up as solidly as they can set\ntheir blocks--eyes shut, even, and concentrating on something else.\nCheck?\"\n\nJames did not express the thought that Tellus must by now be so far away\nthat no possible effort could reach it; but he could not repress the\nimplication.\n\n\"Check. I'll concentrate on a series of transfinite numbers. Belle, you\nwork on the possible number of shades of the color green. Lola, on how\nmany different perfumes you can identify by smell. Jim, hit the button.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6\n\n\nSince the tests took much time, and were strictly routine in nature,\nthere is no need to go into them in detail. At their conclusion, Garlock\nsaid:\n\n\"First: either Jim alone, or Lola alone, or Jim and Lola together, can\nhit any destination within any galaxy, but can't go from one galaxy to\nanother.\n\n\"Second: either Belle or I, or any combination containing either of us\nwithout the other, has no control at all.\n\n\"Third: Belle and I together, or any combination containing both of us,\ncan go intergalactic under control.\n\n\"In spite of confession being supposed to be good for the soul, I don't\nlike to admit that we've put gravel in the gear-box--do you, Belle?\"\nGarlock's smile was both rueful and forced.\n\n\"You can play _that_ in spades.\" Belle licked her lips; for the first\ntime since boarding the starship she was acutely embarrassed. \"We'll\nhave to, of course. It was all my fault--it makes me look like a damned\nstupid juvenile delinquent.\"\n\n\"Not by nineteen thousand kilocycles, since neither of us had any idea.\nI'll be glad to settle for half the blame.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\n\"Will you please stop talking Sanskrit?\" James asked. \"Or lep it, so we\ntwo innocent bystanders can understand it?\"\n\n\"Will do,\" and Garlock went on in thought. \"Remember what I said about\nthis drive not being conditioned to anything? I was wrong. Belle and I\nhave conditioned it, but badly. We've been fighting so much that\nsomething or other in that mess down there has become conditioned to\nher; something else to me. My part will play along with anyone except\nBelle; hers with anybody except me. Anti-conditioning, you might call\nit. Anyway, they lay back their ears and balk.\"\n\n\"Oh, hell!\" James snorted. \"Talk about gobbledygook! You are still\nsaying that that conglomeration of copper and silver and steel and\ninsulation that we built ourselves has got intelligence, and I still\nwon't buy it.\"\n\n\"By no means. Remember, Jim, that this concept of mechanical\nteleportation, and that the mind is the only possible controller, are\nabsolutely new. We've got to throw out all previous ideas and start new\nfrom scratch. I postulate, as a working hypothesis drawn from original\ndata as modified by these tests, that that particular conglomeration of\nmaterials generates at least two fields about the properties of which we\nknow nothing at all. That one of those properties is the tendency to\nbecome preferentially resonant with one mind and preferentially\nnon-resonant with another. Clear so far?\"\n\n\"As mud. It's a mighty tough blueprint to read.\" James scowled in\nthought. \"However, it's no harder to swallow than Sanderson's Theory of\nTeleportation. Or, for that matter, the actual basic coupling between\nmind and ordinary muscular action. Does that mean we'll have to rebuild\nhalf a million credits' worth of ... no, you and Belle can work it,\ntogether.\"\n\n\"I don't know.\" Garlock paced the floor. \"I simply can't see any\n_possible_. mechanism of coupling.\"\n\n\"Subconscious, perhaps,\" Belle suggested.\n\n\"For my money that whole concept is invalid,\" Garlock said. \"It merely\nchanges 'I don't know' to 'I can't know' and I don't want any part of\nthat. However, 'unconscious' could be the answer ... if so, we may have\na lever.... Belle, are you willing to bury your hatchet for about five\nminutes--work with me like a partner ought to?\"\n\n\"I certainly am, Clee. Honestly. Screens down flat, if you say so.\"\n\n\"Half-way's enough, I think--you'll know when we get down there.\" Her\nmind joined his and he went on, \"Ignore the machines themselves\ncompletely. Consider only the fields. Feel around with me--keep\ntuned!--see if there's anything at all here that we can grab hold of and\nmanipulate, like an Op field except probably very much finer. I'll be\ncompletely damned if I can see how this type of Gunther generator can\nput out a manipulable field, but it must. That's the only--O-W-R-C-H-H!\"\n\nThis last was a yell of pure mental agony. Both hands flew to his head,\nhis face turned white, sweat poured, and he slumped down unconscious.\n\nHe came to, however, as the other three were stretching him out on a\ndavenport. Belle was mopping his face with a handkerchief.\n\n\"What happened, Clee?\" All three were exclaiming at once.\n\n\"I found my manipulable field, but a bomb went off in my brain when I\nstraightened it out.\" He searched his mind anxiously, then smiled. \"But\nno damage done--just the opposite. It opened up a Gunther cell I didn't\nknow I had. Didn't it sock you, too, Belle?\"\n\n\"Uh-uh,\" she said, more than half bitterly. \"I must not have one. That\nmakes you a Super-Prime, if I may name a new classification.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! Of course you've got it. Unconscious, of course, like me, but\nwithout it you couldn't have conditioned the field. But why.... Oh, what\nbit me was the one conditioned to me.\"\n\n\"Oh, nice!\" Belle exclaimed. \"Come on, Clee--let's go get mine!\"\n\n\"Do you want a bit of knowledge _that_ badly, Belle?\" Lola asked.\n\"Besides, wait, he isn't strong enough yet.\"\n\n\"Of course he's strong enough. A little knock like that? _Want_ it! I'd\ngive my right leg and ... and almost _anything_ for it. It didn't kill\nhim, so it won't kill me.\"\n\n\"There may be an easier way,\" Garlock said. \"I wouldn't wish a jolt like\nthat onto my worst enemy. But that had two hundred kilovolts and four\nhundred kilogunts behind it. Since I know now where and what the cell\nis, I think I can open it up for you without being quite so rough.\"\n\n\"Oh, lovely. Come in, quick! I'm ready now.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nGarlock went in; and wrought. It took longer--half an hour, in fact--but\nit was very much easier to take.\n\n\"What did it feel like, Belle?\" Lola asked, eagerly. \"You winced like he\nwas drilling teeth and struck a couple of nerves.\"\n\n\"Uh-uh. More like being stretched all out of shape. Like having a child,\nmaybe, in a small way. Let's go, Clee!\"\n\nThey joined up and went.\n\n\"Ha, _there_ you are, you cantankerous little fabrication of nothings!\"\nBelle said aloud, in a low, throaty, gloating voice. \"Take _that_--and\n_that_! And now behave yourself. If you don't, mama spank--but _good_!\"\nThen, breaking connection, \"Thanks a million, Clee; you're tall, solid\ngold. Do you want to run some more tests, to see which of us is the\nintergalactic transporter?\"\n\n\"Not unless you do.\"\n\n\"Who, me? I'll be tickled to death not to; just like I'd swallowed an\nostrich feather. Back to Tellus, then?\"\n\n\"Tellus, here we come,\" Garlock said. \"Jim, what are the Tellurian\nfigures for exactly five hundred miles up?\"\n\n\"I'll punch 'em--got 'em in my head.\" James did so. \"Shall Brownie and I\nset our blocks?\"\n\n\"No,\" Belle said. \"Nothing can interfere with us now.\"\n\n\"Ready.\" Garlock sat down in the pilot's seat. \"Cluster 'round, chum.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nBelle leaned against the back of the chair and put both arms around\nGarlock's neck. \"I'm clustered.\"\n\n\"The spot we're shooting at is exactly over the exact center of the\nmiddle blast-pit at Port Gunther. In sync?\"\n\n\"To a skillionth of a whillionth of a microphase. I'm _exactly_ on and\nlocked. Shoot.\"\n\n\"Now, you sheet-iron bucket of nuts and bolts, _jump_!\" and Garlock\nsnapped the red switch.\n\nEarth lay beneath them. So did Port Gunther.\n\n\"Hu-u-u-uh!\" Garlock's huge sigh held much more of relief than of\ntriumph.\n\n\"They did it! We're home!\" Lola shrieked; and, breaking into unashamed\nand unrestrained tears, went into her husband's extended arms.\n\n\"Cry ahead, sweet. I'd bawl myself if Garlock wasn't looking. Maybe I\nwill, anyway,\" James said. Then, extending his right arm to Garlock and\nto Belle, \"I was scared to death you couldn't make it except by back\ntracking. Good going, you two Primes,\" but his thoughts said vastly more\nthan his words.\n\nBelle's eyes, too, were wet; Garlock's own were not quite dry.\n\n\"You weren't as sure as you looked, then, that we could do it the hard\nway,\" Belle said. \"All inside, I was one quivering mass of jelly.\"\n\n\"Afterward, you mean. You were solid as Gibraltar when I fired the\ncharge. You're the kind of woman a man wants with him when the going's\ntough. Slide around here a little, so I can get hold of you.\"\n\nGarlock released Belle--finally--and turned to the pilot, who was just\npulling a data-sheet from Compy the Computer. \"How far did we miss\ntarget, Jim?\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nJames held up his right hand, thumb and forefinger forming a circle.\n\"You're one point eight seven inches high, and off center point five\nthree inches to the north northeast by east. I hereby award each of you\nthe bronze medal of Marksman First. Shall I take her down now or do you\nwant to check in from here first?\"\n\n\"Neither ... I think. What do you think, Belle?\"\n\n\"Right. Not until you-know-what.\"\n\n\"Check. Until we decide whether or not to let them know just yet that we\ncan handle the ship. If we do, how many of our taped reports we turn in\nand how many we toss down the chute.\"\n\n\"I get it!\" James exclaimed, with a spreading grin. \"_That_, my dear\npeople, is something I never expected to live long enough to see--our\nstraight-laced Doctor Garlock applying the Bugger Factor to a research\nproblem!\"\n\n\"I prefer the term 'Monk's Coefficient,' myself,\" Garlock said, \"from\nthe standpoint of mathematical rigor.\"\n\n\"At Polytech we called it 'Finagle's Formula',\" Belle commented. \"The\nmost widely applicable operator known.\"\n\n\"Have you three lost your minds?\" Lola demanded. \"That's nothing to joke\nabout--you wouldn't destroy official reports! All that astronomy and\nanthropology that nobody ever even dreamed of before? You _couldn't_!\nNot _possibly_!\"\n\n\"Each of us knows just as well as you do how much data we have, exactly\nhow new and startling it is; but we've thought ahead farther than you\nhave. None of us likes the idea of destroying it a bit better than you\ndo. We won't, either, without your full, unreserved, wholehearted\nconsent, nor without your fixed, iron-clad, unshakable determination\nnever to reveal any least bit of it.\"\n\n\"That language is far too strong for me. I'd like to be able to go along\nwith you, but on those terms, I simply can't.\"\n\n\"I think you can, when you've thought it through. You've met Alonzo P.\nFerber, haven't you? Read him?\"\n\n\"One glimpse; that was all I could stand. He pawed me mentally and\nwanted to paw me physically, the first time I ever saw him.\"\n\n\"Check. So I'm going to ask you two questions, which you may answer as\nan anthropologist, as Lola Montandon, as Mrs. James James James the\nNinth, as a member of our team, or as any other character you choose to\nassume. Remembering that Ferber's a Gunther First--and pretends to be an\nOperator whenever he can get away with it--should he, or anyone like\nhim, _ever_ be allowed to visit Hodell? Second question: if there is any\npossible way for him to get there, can he be made to stay away?\"\n\n\"Oh ... Grand Lady Neldine and that perfectly stunning Grand Lady Lemphi\nthey picked out for Jim ... they're such _nice_ people ... and the\nGunther genes....\" As Lola thought on, her expressive face showed a\nvariety of conflicting emotions before it hardened into decision. \"The\nanswer to both questions--the only possible answer--is no. I subscribe;\non the exact terms you stipulated. And you don't believe, Clee, that my\nthesis had anything to do with my holding out at first?\"\n\n\"Certainly I don't. Besides....\"\n\n\"What thesis?\" Belle asked.\n\n        *           *           *\n\n\"For my Ph.D. in anthropology. I thought I had it made, but it just went\ndown the chute. And I don't know if any of you realize just how nearly\nimpossible it is to make a really worthwhile original contribution to\nscience in that field.\"\n\n\"As I started to tell you, Brownie,\" Garlock said, \"I don't think you've\nlost a thing. There's a bigger and better one coming up.\"\n\n\"_What_?\"\n\n\"Sh-h-h-h,\" Belle stage-whispered. \"He's got a theory--such a weirdie\nthat he won't talk about it to anybody.\"\n\n\"It isn't a theory yet--at least, not ripe enough to pick--but it's\nsomething more than a hunch,\" Garlock said.\n\n\"But what could _possibly_ make as good a thesis as those extra-galactic\ntapes?\" Lola wailed. \"They would have made my thesis a summer breeze.\"\n\n\"More like a hurricane--the hottest thing since doctorate disputations\nfirst started,\" Garlock said. \"However, as I started to say twice\nbefore, it still will be. Intra-galactic tapes will be just as good. In\nthis case, better.\"\n\n\"W-e-l-l ... possibly. But we haven't any.\"\n\n\"That is what this conference is about. We can't destroy the stuff we\nhave unless we can replace it with something better. My idea is that we\nshould visit a few--say fifty--Tellus-type planets in this galaxy; the\nones closest to Tellus. I'm pretty sure they'll be inhabited by _Homo\nSapiens_. There's a chance, of course, that they'll be like Hodell and\nthe others we've seen; in which case I don't see how we can keep Gunther\ngenes confined to Earth. However, I'm pretty sure in my own mind that\nwe'll find them all very much like Tellus, Gunther and all. What would\nyou think of _that_ for a thesis, Lola?\"\n\n\"Oh, wonderful!\"\n\n\"Okay. Now to get back to whether we want to check in or not. I don't\nlike to duck out without letting them know we can handle this\nheap--after a fashion, that is; they don't need to know we can really\nhandle it--but we've got nothing we can report and Fatso will blow his\nstack--Oh-oh! Should've remembered Tellus isn't Hodell; the tri-di's\nsetting up! Belle, you take it. She'd give me Fatso, because he wants to\nchew me out, but she won't put him on for you. Cut her throat, but good!\nBrownie, hide somewhere! Jim, set up for Beta Centauri--not Alpha, but\nBeta--and fast! Give her hell, Belle!\" Garlock sent this last thought\nfrom behind a davenport, from which hiding-place he could see the tri-di\nscreen and both Belle and James; but anyone on the screen could not see\nhim.\n\n        *           *           *\n\nMiss Foster's likeness appeared upon the screen. Chancellor Ferber's\nsecretary was a big woman, but not fat; middle-aged, gray-haired,\nwearing consciously the aura and the domineering, overbearing expression\nof a woman who has great power and an even greater drive to exert her\nauthority.\n\n\"Why haven't you reported in?\" Miss Foster snapped, with a glare that\nwas pure frost. \"You arrived thirteen minutes ago. Such delay is\ninexcusable. Get Garlock.\"\n\n\"Captain Garlock is off-watch; asleep. I, Commander Bellamy, am in\ncommand.\" Standing stiffly at attention, Belle paused to exchange glares\nwith the woman across the big desk. If Miss Foster's was frost,\nCommander Bellamy's was helium ice.\n\n\"Ready to go, Jim?\" Belle flashed the thought.\n\n\"Half a minute yet.\"\n\n\"Any time after I sign off. Pick your own spot.\" Then aloud into the\nscreen: \"I will report to Chancellor Ferber. I will not report to\nChancellor Ferber's secretary.\"\n\n\"Doctor James!\" Miss Foster's voice was neither as cold nor as steady as\nit had been. \"Bring that ship down at once!\"\n\nJames made no sign that he had heard the order. Belle stood changelessly\nstiff. She had not for an instant taken her coldly competent eyes from\nthose of the woman on the ground. Her emotionless, ultra-refrigerated\nvoice went, as ever, directly into the screen.\n\n\"I trust that this conversation is being recorded?\"\n\n\"It certainly is!\"\n\n\"Good. I want it on record that we, the personnel of the starship\n_Pleiades_, are not subject to the verbal orders of the Chancellor's\nsecretary. You will now connect me with Chancellor Ferber, please.\"\n\n\"The Chancellor is in conference and is not to be disturbed. I _have_\nauthority to act for him. You will report to me, and do it right now.\"\nFoster's voice rose almost to a scream.\n\n\"That ground has been covered. Since you have taken it upon yourself to\nexceed your authority to such an extent as to refuse to connect the\nofficer in command of the _Pleiades_ with the Chancellor, I cannot\nreport to him either the reasons why we are not landing at this time or\nwhen we expect to return to Tellus. You are advised that we may leave at\nany instant, just like that!\" Belle snapped her finger under the imaged\nnose. \"You may inform the Chancellor, or not inform him if you prefer,\nthat our control of the starship _Pleiades_ is something less than\nperfect. I do not know exactly how many seconds longer we will be here.\nCommander Bellamy signing off. Over and out.\"\n\n\"_Commander_ Bellamy, indeed! Commander my left foot!\" Miss Foster was\nscreaming now, in thwarted fury. \"You're no more a commander than my\nlowest office-girl is! Just wait 'till you get down here, you\ngreen-haired hussy, you shameless notor....\" The set went\ninstantaneously from full volume to zero sound as James drove the red\nbutton home.\n\n\"Belle, you honey!\" Garlock scrambled out from behind the davenport,\nseized her around the waist, and swung her, feet high in air, through\nfour full circles before he let her down and kissed her vigorously. \"You\nlittle _sweetheart_! You're the first living human being ever to really\npull Foster's cork!\"\n\n\"_What_ a goat-getting!\" James applauded. \"That will go down in history\nas the star-spangled act of the century.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nBelle was, however, unusually diffident. \"I stuck my neck out a\nmile--worse, Clee's. I'm sorry, Clee. I had to have some weight to throw\naround, and I had only a second to think, and that was the first thing I\nthought of, and after half a minute she made me so _damn_ mad that I\nwent entirely too far.\"\n\n\"Uh-uh. Just far enough. That was a _perfect_ job.\"\n\n\"But she'll never forget that, and she'll crucify you, as well as me,\nwhen we land. She knows I'm not a commander.\"\n\n\"She just thinks you ain't. The official log will show, though, that\nafter only one day out I discovered that we should all be officers--one\ncaptain and three commanders--with pay and perquisites of rank. I'll\nthink up good and sufficient reasons for it between now and when I make\nup the log.\"\n\n\"But you can't! Or can you, really?\"\n\n\"Well, nobody told me I couldn't, so I assumed the right. Besides, you\ndidn't tell her commander of what, so I'll make it stick, too--see if I\ndon't. Or else I'll tear two or three offices apart finding out why I\ncan't. You can be sure of that.\"\n\n\"All that may not be necessary,\" Lola said. \"That tape will never be\nheard. I'll bet she's erased it already.\"\n\n\"Perhaps; but ours isn't going to be erased--it will be heard exactly\nwhere it will do the most good.\"\n\n\"I'm awfully glad you don't think we're on the hook. All that's left,\nthen, is that second-in-command business. Both of you know, of course,\nthat that was just window-dressing.\"\n\n\"You were telling the truth and didn't know it,\" James said, cheerfully.\n\"You have actually been second-in-command ever since the drive tests.\"\n\n\"I haven't, and I won't. Surely you don't think I'm enough of a heel,\nJim, to step on your toes like that?\"\n\n\"Nothing like that involved. You tell her, Clee.\"\n\n\"Gunther ability is what counts. You're a Prime, Jim's an Operator; so,\nnow that we can handle the heap, you'll have to be second-in-command\nwhether you like it or not. Any time you can out-Gunther me we'll trade\nplaces. And you won't have to take the job away from me--I'll give it to\nyou.\"\n\n\"But ... no hard feelings, Jim? No reservations? Screens down?\"\n\n\"None whatever. In fact, I'm relieved. I'm Gunthered for this board\nhere--for that one I'm not. Come in and look; and shake on it.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nBelle looked; and while they were shaking hands, she flashed a thought\nat Lola. \"Do you know that we've got two of the finest men that ever\nlived?\"\n\n\"I've known that for a long time,\" Lola flashed back, \"but you've hardly\nstarted to realize what they _really_ are.\"\n\n\"Well, shall we start earning our pay and perquisites by getting to work\non this planet, that we haven't even looked--wait a minute! We're just\nabout to open up the galaxy, aren't we?\"\n\nThey were.\n\n\"Then there'll have to be some kind of a unifying and correlating\nauthority--a Galactic Council or something--and the quicker it's set up\nthe better; the less confusion and turmoil and jockeying-for-position\nthere will be. Question: should this authority be political?\"\n\n\"It should _not_!\" James declared. \"It takes United Worlds seven solid\ndays of debate to decide whether or not to buy one lead pencil.\"\n\n\"Military--or naval, I suppose it'd be--that's what Clee's driving at,\"\nBelle said. \"You're wonderful, Clee--simply priceless! We're officers of\nthe brand-new Galactic Navy. Subject to civilian control, of course, but\nthe civilians will be the United Galaxian Societies of the Galaxy, and\nnobody else. _Beautiful_, Clee! There are ten Operators, Jim. Right?\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\n\"Check. Brownie and I are here; the other eight are running the Galaxian\nSociety under Clee. And the whole Society eats out of his hand.\"\n\n\"I don't know about that, but Belle and I together could swing it, I\nthink.\"\n\n\"I'll say we could,\" Belle breathed. \"And I simply can't wait to see you\nkick Fatso's teeth in with _this_ one!\"\n\n\"I don't like the word 'Navy',\" Garlock said. \"It's tied definitely to\nwarfare. How about calling it the 'Galactic Service'? Applicable to\neither war or peace. Brass Hats will think of us in terms of war, even\nthough we will actually work for peace. Any objections?\"\n\nThere were no objections.\n\n\"About the uniforms,\" Lola said, eagerly. \"Space-black and star-white,\nwith chromium comets and things on the shoulders....\"\n\n\"To hell with uniforms,\" Garlock broke in. \"Why do women have to go off\nthe deep end on clothes?\"\n\n\"She's right--you're wrong, Clee,\" James said. \"Without a uniform you\nwon't get off the ground, not even with the Society. And you'll be\ntalking to Top Planetary Brass. Also, they're Gunthered plenty--you can\nfeel their Op field clear out here.\"\n\n\"Could be,\" Garlock conceded. \"Okay, you girls dope it out to suit\nyourselves. But think you can stand it, Belle, to wear more than twelve\nsquare inches of clothes?\"\n\n\"Wait 'til you see it, chum. I've been designing a uniform for myself\nfor positively _years_.\"\n\n\"I can't wait. And you're a captain, of course.\"\n\n\"Huh? You can't have two cap.... Oh, I see. Primes. I appreciate that,\nClee. Thanks.\"\n\n\"Hold on, both of you,\" James said. \"You haven't thought this through\nfar enough. Suppose we meet forces already organized? Better start high\nthan low. You've got to be top admiral, Clee.\"\n\n\"Rocket-oil! Suppose we don't find anything at all?\"\n\n\"You're right, Jim,\" Belle said. \"Clee, you talk like a man with a paper\nnose. It's _you_ who's been yowling for two solid years about being\nready for _anything_. We've got to do just that.\"\n\n\"Correction accepted. Brief me.\"\n\n\"Ranks should be different from those of United Worlds. They should be\ndescriptive, but impressive. Tops could be Galactic Admiral. That's you.\nVice Galactic Admiral; me....\"\n\n\"Galactic Vice Admiral would be better,\" Lola said.\n\n\"Accepted. Those two we'll make stick come hell or space-warps. Right?\"\n\nGarlock did not reply immediately. \"Up to either one of two points,\" he\nagreed, finally.\n\n\"What points?\"\n\n\"War, or being out-Gunthered. Top Gunther takes top place; man, woman,\nbird, beast, fish, or bug-eyed monster.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" Belle was staggered for a moment. \"No war, of course. As to the\nother ... I hadn't thought of that.\"\n\n\"There are a lot of things none of us has thought of, but as amended\nI'll buy it.\"\n\n\"Then several Regional Admirals, each with his Regional Vice Admiral.\nThen System Admirals and Vices, and World or Planetary--naming the\nplanet, you know--Admirals and Vices. Let the various Galaxian Societies\ntake over from there down. How do you like _them_ potatoes, Buster?\"\n\n\"Nice. And formal address, intra-ship, will be Mister and Miss. Jim and\nBrownie?\"\n\nThey liked it. \"Where do we fit in?\" James asked.\n\n\"Pick your own spots,\" Garlock said.\n\n\"If we stick to the Solar System we aren't so apt to get bumped by\nPrimes. So make me Solar System Admiral and Brownie my Vice.\"\n\n\"Okay. How long will it take you, Belle, to materialize those uniforms?\"\n\n\"Fifteen seconds longer than it takes the converter to scan us. Lola's\ncolor scheme is right, and I've got everything else down to the last\ncurlicue of chrome. Let's go.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nThey went: and came back into the Main in uniform. Belle had really done\na job.\n\nThat of the men, while something on the spectacular side, was more or\nless conventional, with stiff-visored, screened, heavily-chromed caps;\nbut the women's! Slippers, overseas caps, shorts and jackets--but what\njackets!\n\n\"Well....\" Garlock said, after examining the two girls speechlessly for\na good half minute. \"It doesn't look _exactly_ like a spray-on job; but\nif you ever take a deep breath it'll split from here to there. Fly\noff--leave you naked as a jay-bird.\"\n\n\"Oh, no. The fabric stretches a little. See? Nothing like a sweater, but\na similar effect--perhaps a bit more so.\"\n\n\"Quite a bit more so, I'd say. However, since Operators and Primes are\nautomatically stacked like Tennick Towers, I don't suppose your recruits\nwill be unduly perturbed at, or will squawk too much about,\noverexposure. Are we finally ready to go down and get to work?\"\n\n\"I am,\" James said. \"How do you want to handle it?\"\n\n\"Run a search pattern. Belle and I will center their Op field and check\non Ops and Primes. You two probe at will.\"\n\nAround and around the planet, in brief bursts of completely\nincomprehensible speed, the huge ship darted; the biggest, solidest, yet\nmost elusive and fantastic \"flying saucer\" ever to visit that world. The\ntremendous oceans and six great continents were traversed; the ice-caps;\nthe frigid, the temperate, and the torrid zones. Wherever she went,\npowerful and efficient radar scanned and tracked her; wherever she went,\nexcitement seethed.\n\n\"Beta Centauri Five,\" Garlock reported, after a few minutes. \"Margonia,\nthey call it. Biggest continent and nation named Nargoda. Capital city\nMargon; Margon Base on coast nearby. Lots of Gunther Firsts. All the\nreal Gunther, though, is clear across the continent. They're building a\nstarship. Fourteen Ops and two Primes--man and woman. Deggi Delcamp's a\nbig bruiser, with a God-awful lot of stuff. Ugly as hell, though. He's a\nbossy type.\"\n\n\"I'm amazed,\" James played it straight. \"I thought all male Primes would\nbe just like you. Timorous Timmies.\"\n\n\"Huh? Oh....\" Garlock was taken slightly aback, but went on quickly,\n\"What do you think of your opposite number, Belle?\" He whistled a\nwolf-call and made hour-glass motions with his hands. \"I'd thought of\ntrading you in on a new model, but Fao Talaho is no bargain, either--and\n_nobody's_ push-over.\"\n\n\"_Trade_! You _tomcat_!\" Belle's nostrils flared. \"You know what that\nbleached-blonde tried to do? High-hat _me!_\"\n\n\"I noticed. When we four get down to business, face to face, there\nshould be some interesting by-products.\"\n\n\"You chirped it, boss. Primes seem to be such _nice_ people.\" James\nrolled his eyes upward and steepled his hands. \"If you've got all the\ndope, no use finishing this search pattern.\"\n\n\"Go ahead. Window dressing. The Brass hasn't any idea of what's going\non, any more than ours did.\"\n\nThe search went on until, \"This is it,\" James reported. \"Where? Over\nMargon Base?\"\n\n\"Check. Kick us over there, ten or twelve hundred miles up.\"\n\n\"On the way, boss. Looks like your theory is about ready to pick.\"\n\n\"It isn't much of a theory yet; just that cultural and evolutionary\npatterns should be more or less homogeneous within galaxies. Until it\ncan explain why so many out-galaxies are just alike it doesn't amount to\nmuch. By the way, I'm glad you people insisted on organization and rank\nand uniforms. The Brass is going to take a certain amount of convincing.\nTake over, Brownie--this is your dish.\"\n\n\"I was afraid of that.\"\n\nThe others watched Lola drive her probe--a diamond-clear, razor-sharp\nbolt of thought that no Gunther First could possibly either wield or\nstop--down into the innermost private office of that immense and\nfar-flung base. Through Lola's inner eyes they saw a tall, trim,\nhandsome, fiftyish man in a resplendent uniform of purple and gold; they\nwatched her brush aside that officer's hard-held mental block.\n\n        *           *           *\n\n\"I greet you, Supreme Grand Marshal Entlore, Highest Commander of the\nArmed Forces of Nargoda. This is the starship _Pleiades_, of System Sol,\nPlanet Tellus. I am Sol-System Vice-Admiral Lola Montandon. I have with\nme as guests three of my superior officers of the Galactic Service,\nincluding the Galactic Admiral himself. We are making a good-will tour\nof the Tellus-Type planets of this region of space. I request permission\nto land and information as to your landing conventions. The landing\npad--bottom--of the _Pleiades_ is flat; sixty feet wide by one hundred\ntwenty feet long. Area loading is approximately eight tons per square\nfoot. Solid, dry ground is perfectly satisfactory. While we land\nvertically, with little or no shock impact, I prefer not to risk\ndamaging your pavement.\"\n\nThey all felt the Marshal's thoughts race. \"Starship! Tellus--Sol, that\ninsignificant Type G dwarf! Interstellar travel a commonplace! A ship\n_that_ size and weight--an organized, uniformed, functioning Galaxy-wide\nNavy and they don't want to _damage_ my _pavement_! My God!\"\n\n\"Good going, Brownie! Kiss her for me, Jim.\" Garlock flashed the\nthought.\n\nEntlore, realizing that his every thought was being read, pulled himself\ntogether. \"I admit that I was shocked, Admiral Montandon. But\nlanding--really, I have nothing to do with landings. They are handled\nby....\"\n\n\"I realize that, sir; but you realize that no underling could possibly\nauthorize my landing. That is why I always start at the top. Besides, I\ndo not like to waste time on officers of much lower rank than my own,\nand,\" Lola allowed a strong tinge of good humor to creep into her\nthought, \"the bigger they are, the less apt they are to pass the\nwell-known buck.\"\n\n\"You have had experience, I see,\" the Marshal laughed. He _did_ have a\nsense of humor. \"While landing here is forbidden--top secret, you\nknow--would my refusal mean much to you?\"\n\n\"Having made satisfactory contact, I introduce you to Galactic Admiral\nGarlock. Take over, sir, please.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nEntlore winced, for the probe Garlock used then compared to Lola's very\nmuch as a diamond drill compares to a piece of soft brass pipe.\n\n\"It would mean everything to us,\" Garlock assured him. \"Our mission is a\nperfectly friendly one. We will have a friendly visit or none. If you do\nnot care for our friendship, another nation will.\"\n\n\"That wouldn't do, either, of course.\" Entlore paused in thought. \"It\nboils down to this: I must either welcome you or destroy you.\"\n\n\"You may try.\" Garlock grinned in frankly self-satisfied amusement.\n\"However, the best you can do is lithium-hydride fusion missiles in the\nhundreds-of-megatons range. Firecrackers. Every once in a while a planet\nhas to try a few such things on us before it will believe that we are\npowerful as well as friendly. Would you like to test our defenses? If\nso, I will neither take offense nor retaliate.\"\n\nSupreme Grand Marshal Entlore was floored. \"Why ... er ... not at all. I\nread in your mind....\" He broke off, to quell an invasion into his own\nprivate office. \"Damn it, keep _still_!\" all four \"heard\" him yell. \"I\nknow they ran a search pattern. I know _that_, too. I know _everything_\nabout it, I tell you! I'm in full rapport with their Supreme Grand\nAdmiral. There's only the one ship, they're friendly, and I'm inviting\nthem to land here on Margon Base. Give that to the press. Say also that\nentrance restrictions to Margon Base will not be relaxed at present.\nGrand Marshal Holson and ComOff Flurnoy, stay here and tune in. The rest\nof you get out and _stay_ out! Throw all reports about any alien vessel\nor flying saucer or what-have-you into the waste-basket!\"\n\n\"Resume command, please, Miss Montandon,\" Garlock directed; and withdrew\nhis probe from Entlore's mind.\n\n\"I thank you, Supreme Grand Marshal Entlore, for your welcome,\" Lola\nsent. \"I'm sorry that our visits cause so much disturbance, but I\nsuppose it can't be helped. Our Gunther blocks are down. Would you and\nyour two assistants like to teleport out here to us, and con us down\nyourselves?\" Lola knew instantly that they could not, and covered deftly\nfor them. \"But of course you can't, without knowing a focus spot here in\nthe Main. Shall I teleport you aboard?\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nComOff Flurnoy's face--she was an attractive, nicely-built red-head\nwearing throat-mike, earphone, and recorder--turned so pale that a faint\nline of freckles stood out across the bridge of her nose. She very\nevidently wanted to scream a protest, but would not. Both men, strangely\nenough, were eager to go. Instantly all three were standing in line on\nthe deep-piled rug of the Main, facing the four Tellurians. Seven bodies\ncame rigidly to attention, seven right hands snapped into two varieties\nof formal salute. Standing thus, each party studied the other for a\ncouple of seconds.\n\nThere was no doubt at all as to which two of the visitors the two\nNargodian men were studying; but neither of them could quite make up his\nmind as to which of the black-and-white-clad women to study first or\nmost. The red-head's glance, too, flickered between Belle and\nGarlock--incredulous envy and equally incredulous admiration lit her\neyes.\n\n\"At rest, please, fellow-officers,\" Garlock said, and Lola performed the\nnecessary introductions, adding, \"We do not, however, use titles aboard\nship. Mister and Miss are customary and sufficient.\"\n\nBehind each row of officers a long davenport appeared; between them a\ntable loaded with sandwiches, olives, pickles, relishes, fruits, nuts,\nsoft drinks, cigars, and cigarettes.\n\n\"Help yourselves,\" Garlock invited. \"We serve neither intoxicants nor\ndrugs, but you should find something there to your taste.\"\n\n\"Indeed we shall, and thank you,\" Entlore said. \"Is there any objection,\nMr. Garlock, to Miss Flurnoy transmitting information of this meeting\nand of this ship to our base?\"\n\n\"None whatever. Send as you please, Miss Flurnoy, or as Mr. Entlore\ndirects.\"\n\n\"I'm glad I didn't quite scare myself out of coming up here,\" the\nCommunications Officer said. \"This is the biggest and nicest thrill I\never had. Such a thrill that I don't know just where to begin.\" She\ncocked an eyebrow at her commanding officer.\n\n\"As usual. Whatever you think should be sent.\" Entlore sent her a\nsteadying thought. Then, as the girl settled back with a sandwich in one\nhand and a tall glass of ginger-ale in the other, he went on, to\nGarlock, \"She is a very fine and very strong telepath--by our standards,\nat least.\"\n\n\"By galactic standards also.\" Garlock had of course been checking.\n\"Accurate, sharp, wide-range, clear-thinking, and fast. Not one of us\nfour could do it any better.\"\n\n\"I thank you, Mr. Garlock,\" the girl said, with a blush of pleasure--and\nwith scarcely a perceptible pause in her work.\n\n        *           *           *\n\nA tour of the ship followed; and as it progressed, the more confused and\ndismayed the two Nargodian commanders became.\n\n\"But no crew at _all_?\" Holson demanded incredulously. \"How can a thing\nlike this _possibly_ work?\"\n\n\"It's fully Gunthered,\" Lola explained. \"It works itself. That is,\nalmost all the time. Whenever we land on any planet for the first time,\none of us has to control it. Or for any other special job not in its\nmemory banks. When you're ready for us to land I'll show you--it's my\nturn to work.\"\n\n\"Miss Flurnoy, have they cleared the air over Pylon Six?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. Clearance came through five minutes ago. They are holding it\nclear for us.\"\n\n\"Thank you. Miss Montandon, you may land at your convenience.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir.\" Lola took the pilot's chair. \"This is the scanner. I\npull it over my face and head, so. Since I am always in tune with the\nfield....\"\n\n\"What does _that_ mean?\" Entlore asked, dark foreboding in his mind.\n\n\"I was afraid of that. You can't feel an Operator Field. I'm sorry, sir,\nbut that means you can't handle these forces and never will be able to.\nCertain Gunther areas of your brain are inoperative. On our scale you\nare a Gunther First....\"\n\n\"On ours, I'm an Esper Ten, the highest rating in the world--except for\na few theoretical crackpots who.... Excuse me, please, I shouldn't have\nsaid that, in view of what I see happening here.\"\n\n\"No offense taken, sir. Those who developed the Gunther Drive were\ncrackpots until they got the first starship out into space. But with\nthis scanner on, I think of where I want to look and I can see it. I\nthen think the ship a few miles sidewise--so--and we are now directly\nover your Pylon Six. I'm starting down, but I won't go into free fall.\"\n\nApparent weight grew less and less, until: \"This is about enough for\nyou, Miss Flurnoy?\"\n\n\"Just,\" the ComOff agreed, with a gulp. \"One pound less and I'm afraid\nI'll upchuck that lovely lunch I just ate.\"\n\n\"We're going fast enough now. Everyone sitting down? Brace yourselves,\nplease. You'll be about fifty percent overweight for a while.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nAs bodies settled deeper into cushions Entlore sent Garlock a\nthought. \"We three weigh about five hundred pounds. You lifted\nus--instantaneously or nearly so, but I'll pass the question of\nacceleration for the moment--eleven hundred miles straight up. How did\nyou repeal the Law of Conservation?\"\n\n\"We didn't. We have fusion engines of twenty million horsepower. Our\nOperator Field, which has a radius of fifteen thousand miles and is\ncharged to an electrogravitic potential of one hundred thousand gunts,\nstores energy. Its action is not exactly like that of an electrical\ncondenser or of a storage battery, but is more or less analogous to\nboth. Thus, the energy required to lift you three came from the field,\nbut the amount was so small that it did not lower the potential of the\nfield by any measurable amount. Setting this ship down--call it sixty\nthousand tons for a thousand miles at one gravity--will increase the\nfield's potential by approximately one-tenth of one gunt. Have you\nstudied paraphysics?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"It wasn't practical, eh?\" Garlock smiled. \"Then I can't make even a\nstab at explaining instantaneous translation to you. I'll just say that\nthere is no acceleration involved, no time lapse. There is no violation\nof the Law of Conservation since departure and arrival points are\nequi-Guntherial. But what I am really interested in is that small group\nof high espers you mentioned.\"\n\n\"Yes, I inferred that from Miss Montandon's comments.\" Entlore fell\nsilent and Garlock watched his somber thoughts picture Margon Base and\nhis nation's capital being attacked and destroyed by a fleet of\ninvincible and invulnerable starships like this _Pleiades_.\n\n\"You are wrong, sir,\" Garlock put in, quietly. \"The Galactic Service has\nnot had, does not and will not have, anything to do with intra-planetary\naffairs. We have no connection with, and no responsibility to, any world\nor any group of worlds. We are an arm of the United Galaxian Societies\nof the Galaxy. Our function is to control space. To forbid, to prevent,\nto rectify any interplanetary or interstellar aggression. Above all, to\nprevent, by means of procedures up to and including total destruction of\nplanets if necessary, any attempt whatever to form any multi-world\nempire.\"\n\nThe three Nargodians gasped as one, as much at the scope of the thing as\nat the calmly cold certainty of ability carried by the thought.\n\n\"You are transmitting this precisely, Miss Flurnoy?\" Entlore asked.\n\n\"Precisely, sir; including background, fringes, connotations, and\nimplications; just as he is giving it to us.\"\n\n\"Let us assume that your Nargodian government decides to conquer all the\nother nations of your planet Margonia. Assume farther that it succeeds.\nWe will not object; in fact, we will, as a usual thing, not even be\ninformed of it. If then, however, your government decides that one world\nis not enough for it to rule and prepares to conquer, or take aggressive\naction against, any other world, we will be informed and we will step\nin. First, warning will be given. Second, any and all vessels dispatched\non such a mission will be annihilated. Third, if the offense is\ncontinued or repeated, trial will be held before the Galactic Council\nand any sentence imposed will be carried out.\"\n\nIn spite of Garlock's manner and message, both marshals were highly\nrelieved. \"You're in plenty of time, with us, sir,\" Entlore said. \"We\nhave just sent our first rocket to our nearer moon ... that is, unless\nthat group of--of espers gets their ship off the ground.\"\n\n\"How far along are they?\"\n\n\"The ship itself is built, but they are having trouble with their drive.\nThe hull is spherical, and much smaller than this one. It has atomic\nengines, but no blasts or ion-plates ... but neither has this one!\"\n\n\"Exactly; they may be pretty well along. I'd like to get in touch with\nthem as soon as possible. May I borrow a 'talker' like Miss Flurnoy for\na few days? You have others, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Yes, but I'll let you have her; it is of the essence that you have the\nbest one available. Miss Flurnoy?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir?\" Besides reporting, she had been conversing busily with James\nand Belle.\n\n\"Would you like to be assigned to Mr. Garlock for the duration of his\nstay on Margonia?\"\n\n\"Oh, _yes_, sir!\" she replied, excitedly.\n\n\"You are so assigned. Take orders from him or from any designate as\nthough I myself were issuing them.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir ... but what limits? And do I transmit to and/or record\nfor you, sir?\"\n\n\"No limit. These four Galaxians are hereby granted nation-wide top\nclearance. Transmit as usual whatever is permitted.\"\n\n\"Full reporting is not only permitted, but urged,\" Garlock said. \"There\nis nothing secret about our mission.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nAs the _Pleiades_ landed: \"If you will give us your focus spot, Mr.\nEntlore, we can all 'port to your office and save calling staff cars.\"\n\n\"And cause a revolution?\" Entlore laughed. \"Apparently you haven't been\nchecking outside.\"\n\n\"Afraid I haven't. I've been thinking.\"\n\n\"Take a look. I got orders from the Cabinet to put guards wherever\npeople absolutely must not go, and open everything else to the public. I\n_hope_ there are enough guards to keep a lane open for us, but I\nwouldn't bet on it.\" Garlock was very glad that the military men's stiff\nformality had disappeared. \"You Galaxians took this whole planet by\nstorm while you were still above the stratosphere.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nThere is no need to go into detail concerning the reception and\ncelebration. On Earth, one inauguration of a president and one\ncoronation of a monarch were each almost as well covered by\nbroadcasters, if not as turbulently and enthusiastically prolonged. From\nthe _Pleiades_ they went to the Administration Building, where an\ninformal reception was held. Thence to the Capitol, where the reception\nwas very formal indeed. Thence to the Grand Ballroom of the city's\nlargest hotel, where a tremendous--and long-winded--banquet was served.\n\nAt Garlock's request, all sixteen members of the \"crackpot\" group--the\nmost active members of the Deep Space Club--had been invited to the\nbanquet. And, even though Garlock was a very busy man, his talker tuned\nin to each one of the sixteen, tuned them all to the Galactic Admiral,\nand in odd moments a great deal of business was done.\n\nAfter being told most of the story--in tight-beamed thoughts that ComOff\nFlurnoy could not receive--the whole group was wildly enthusiastic. They\nwould change the name of their club forthwith to The Galaxian Society Of\nMargonia. They laid plans for a world-wide organization which would have\ntremendous prestige and tremendous income. They already had a\nfield--Garlock knew about their ship--they wanted the _Pleiades_ to move\nover to it as soon as possible--Yes, Garlock thought he could do it the\nfollowing day--if not, as soon as he could....\n\n        *           *           *\n\nThe _Pleiades_ had landed at ten o'clock in the forenoon, local time;\nthe banquet did not come to an end until long after midnight. Throughout\nall this time the four Galaxians carried on, without a slip, the act\nthat all this was, to them, old stuff.\n\nIt was just a little before daylight when they returned, exhausted, to\nthe ship. ComOff Flurnoy went with them. She was still agog at the\nwonder of it all as Belle and Brownie showed her to her quarters.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 7\n\n\nSince everyone, including the ebullient ComOff, slept late the following\nmorning, they all had brunch instead of breakfast and lunch. All during\nthe meal Garlock was preoccupied and stern.\n\n\"Hold everything for a while, Jim,\" he said, when everyone had eaten.\n\"Before we move, Belle and I have got to have a conference.\"\n\n\"Not a Fatso Ferber nine-o'clock type, I hope.\" James frowned in mock\nreproach and ComOff Flurnoy cocked an eyebrow in surprise.\n\"Monkey-business on company time is only for Big Shots like him; not for\nsmall fry such as you.\"\n\n\"Well, it won't be exclusively monkey-business, anyway. While we're gone\nyou might clear with the control tower and take us up into take-off\nposition. Come on, Belle.\" He took her by one elbow and led her away.\n\n\"Why, _Doctor Garlock_.\" Mincing along beside him, pretending high\nreluctance, she looked up at him wide-eyed. \"I'm _surprised_, I really\nam. I'm _shocked_, too. I'm _not_ that kind of a _girl_, and if I wasn't\n_afraid_ of losing my _job_ I would _scream_. I _never_ even _suspected_\nthat _you_ would use your _position_ as my _boss_ to _force_ your\n_unwelcome attentions_ on a _poor_ and _young_ and _innocent_ and\n_suffering_....\"\n\n    [Illustration:\n\n    In an unparalleled blast of Gunther power the primes of\n    many worlds head toward the meeting on Tellus.]\n\nInside his room Garlock, who had been grinning, sobered down and checked\nevery Gunther block--a most unusual proceeding.\n\n        *           *           *\n\nBelle stopped joking in the middle of the sentence.\n\n\"Yeah, _how_ you suffer,\" he said. \"I was just checking to be sure we're\nprime-proof. I'm not ready for Deggi Delcamp yet. That guy, Belle, as\nyou probably noticed, has got one God-awful load of stuff.\"\n\n\"Not as much as you have, Clee. Nor as much push behind what he has got.\nAnd his shield wouldn't make patches for yours.\"\n\n\"Huh? How sure are you of that?\"\n\n\"I'm positive. I'm the one who is going to get bumped, I'm afraid. That\nFao Talaho is a hard-hitting, hard-boiled hellcat on wheels.\"\n\n\"I'll be damned. You're wrong. I checked her from stem to gudgeon and\nyou lay over her like a circus tent. What's the answer?\"\n\n\"Oh? Do I? I'm mighty glad ... funny, both of us being wrong ... it must\nbe, Clee, that it's sex-based differences. We're used to each other, but\nneither of us has ever felt a Prime of the same sex before, and there\nmust be more difference between Ops and Primes than we realized.\nSuppose?\"\n\n\"Could be--I hope. But that doesn't change the fact that we aren't\nready. We haven't got enough data. If we start out with this grandiose\nGalactic Service thing and find only two or three planets Gunthered, we\nmake jackasses of ourselves. On the other hand, if we start out with a\nsmall organization or none, and find a lot of planets, it'll be one\ncontinuous cat-fight. On the third hand....\"\n\n\"Three hands, Clee? What are you, an octopussy or an Arpalone?\"\n\n\"Keep your beautiful trap shut a minute. On the third hand, we've _got_\nto start somewhere. Any ideas?\"\n\n\"I never thought of it that way.... Hm-m-m-m ... I see.\" She thought for\na minute, then went on, \"We'll have to start without starting, then ...\nquite a trick.... But how about this? Suppose we take a fast tour, with\nyou and I taking quick peeks, without the peekees ever knowing we've\nbeen peeking?\"\n\n\"That's using the brain, Belle. Let's go.\" Then, out in the Main, \"Jim,\nwe want to hit a few high spots, as far out as you can reach without\nlosing orientation. Beta Centauri here is pretty bright, Rigel and\nCanopus are real lanterns. With those three as a grid, you could reach\nfifteen hundred or two thousand light-years, couldn't you?\"\n\n\"More than that. That many parsecs, at least.\"\n\n\"Good. Belle and I want to make a fast, random-sampling check of Primes\nand Ops around here. We'll need five minutes at each planet--quite a\nways out. So set up as big a globe as you can and still be dead sure of\nyour locations; then sample it.\"\n\n\"Not enough data. How many samples do you want?\"\n\n\"As many as we can get in the rest of today. Six or seven hours,\nsay--eight hours max.\"\n\n\"Call it seven.... Brownie on the guns, me on Compy.... Five minutes for\nyou.... I should be able to lock down the next shot in five ... one\nminute extra, say, for safety factor ... that'd be ten an hour. Seventy\nplanets enough?\"\n\n\"That'll be fine.\"\n\n\"Okay. We're practically at Number One now,\" and James and Lola donned\ntheir scanners, ready for the job.\n\n        *           *           *\n\n\"Miss Flurnoy,\" Garlock said, \"you might tell Mr. Entlore that\nwe're....\"\n\n\"Oh, I already have, sir.\"\n\n\"You don't have to come along, of course, if you'd rather stay here.\"\n\n\"Stay here, sir? Why, he'd _kill_ me! I'm off the air for a minute,\"\nthis last thought was a conspiratorial whisper. \"Besides, do you think\nI'd miss a chance to be the first person--and just a girl, too--of a\nwhole world to see other planets of other suns? Unless, of course, you\ninvite Mr. Entlore and Mr. Holson along. They're both simply dying to\ngo, I know, but of course won't admit it.\"\n\n\"You'd be just as well pleased if I didn't?\"\n\n\"What do you think, sir?\"\n\n\"We'll be working at top speed and they'd be very much in the way, so\nthey'll get theirs later--after you've licked the cream off the top of\nthe....\"\n\n\"Ready to roll, Clee,\" James announced.\n\n\"Roll.\"\n\n\"Why, I lost contact!\" Miss Flurnoy exclaimed.\n\n\"Naturally,\" Garlock said. \"Did you expect to cover a distance it takes\nlight thousands of years to cross? You can record anything you see in\nthe plates. You can talk to Jim or Lola any time they'll let you. Don't\nbother Miss Bellamy or me from now on.\"\n\nGarlock and Belle went to work. All four Galaxians worked all day, with\nhalf an hour off for lunch. They visited seventy planets and got back to\nMargonia in time for a very late dinner. ComOff Flurnoy had less than a\nquarter of one roll of recorder-tape left unused, and the Primes had\nenough information to start the project they had in mind.\n\nAnd shortly after dinner, all five retired.\n\n\"In one way, Clee, I'm relieved,\" Belle pondered, \"but I can't figure\nout why all the Primes--the grown-up ones, I mean--on all the worlds are\njust about the same cantankerous, you-be-damned, out-and-out stinkers as\nyou and I are. How does _that_ fit into your theory?\"\n\n\"It doesn't. Too fine a detail. My guess is--at least it seems to me to\nmake sense--it's because we haven't had any competition strong enough to\nsmack us down and make Christians out of us. I don't know what a\npsychologist would say....\"\n\n\"And I know _exactly_ what you'd think of whatever he did say, so you\ndon't need to tell me.\" Belle laughed and presented her lips to be\nkissed. \"Good night, Clee.\"\n\n\"Good night, ace.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nAnd the next morning, early, Garlock and Belle teleported themselves--by\narrangement and appointment, of course--across almost the full width of\na nation and into the private office in which Deggi Delcamp and Fao\nTalaho awaited them.\n\nFor a time which would not have been considered polite in Tellurian\nsocial circles the four Primes stood still, each couple facing the other\nwith blocks set tight, studying each other with their eyes. Delcamp was,\nas Garlock had said, a big bruiser. He was shorter and heavier than the\nTellurian. Heavily muscled, splendidly proportioned, he was a man of\ntremendous physical as well as mental strength. His hair, clipped close\nall over his head, was blonde; his eyes were a clear, keen, cold dark\nblue.\n\nFao Talaho was a couple of inches shorter than Belle; and a good fifteen\npounds heavier. She was in no sense fat, however, or even\nplump--actually, she was almost lean. She was wider and thicker than was\nthe Earthwoman; with heavier bones forming a wider and deeper frame.\nShe, too, was beautifully--yes, spectacularly--built. Her hair, fully as\nthick as Belle's own and worn in a free-falling bob three or four inches\nlonger than Belle's, was bleached almost white. Her eyes were not really\nspeckled, nor really mottled, but were regularly _patterned_ in lighter\nand darker shades of hazel. She was, Garlock decided, a really\nremarkable hunk of woman.\n\nBoth Nargodians wore sandals without either socks or stockings. Both\nwere dressed--insofar as they were dressed at all--in yellow. Fao's\nsingle garment was of a thin, closely-knitted fabric, elastic and sleek.\nAbove the waist it was neckless, backless, and almost frontless; below,\nit was a very short, very tight and clinging skirt. Delcamp wore a\nsleeveless jersey and a pair of almost legless shorts.\n\nGarlock lowered his shield enough to send and to receive a thin layer of\nsuperficial thought; Delcamp did the same.\n\n\"So far, I like what I see,\" Garlock said then. \"We are well ahead of\nyou, hence I can help you a lot if you want me to and if you want to be\nfriendly about it. If you don't, on either count, we leave now. Fair\nenough?\"\n\n\"Fair enough. I, too, like what I have seen so far. We need help, and I\nappreciate your offer. Thanks, immensely. I can promise full cooperation\nand friendship for myself and for most of our group; and I assure you\nthat I can and will handle any non-cooperation that may come up.\"\n\n\"Nicely put, Deggi.\" Garlock smiled broadly and let his guard down to a\ncomfortable lepping level. \"I was going to bring that up--the faster\nit's cleared the better. Belle and I are paired. Some day--unless we\nkill each other first--we may marry. However, I'm no bargain and she's\none-third wildcat, one-third vixen, and one-third cobra. How do you two\nstand?\"\n\n\"You took the thought right out of my own mind. Your custom of pairing\nis not what you call 'urbane' on this world. Nevertheless, Fao and I are\npaired. We had to. No one else has ever interested either of us; no one\nelse ever will. We should not fight, but we do, furiously. But no matter\nhow vigorously we fly apart, we inevitably fly together again just as\nfast. No one understands it, but you two are pretty much the same.\"\n\n\"Check. Just one more condition, then, and we can pull those women of\nours apart.\" Belle and Fao were still staring at each other, both still\nsealed tight. \"The first time Fao Talaho starts throwing her weight at\nme, I'm not going to wait for you to take care of her--I'm going to give\nher the surprise of her life.\"\n\n\"It'd tickle me silly if it could be done,\" Delcamp smiled and was\nperfectly frank, \"But the man doesn't live that can do it. How would you\ngo about trying it?\"\n\n\"Set your block solid.\"\n\nDelcamp did so, and through that block--the supposedly impenetrable\nshield of a Prime Operator--Garlock insinuated a probe. He did not crack\nthe screen or break it down by force; he neutralized and counter-phased,\npainlessly and almost imperceptibly, its every component and layer.\n\n        *           *           *\n\n\"Like this,\" Garlock said, in the depths of the Margonian's mind.\n\n\"My God! You can do _that_?\"\n\n\"If I tell her, this deep, to play ball or else, do you think she'd need\ntwo treatments?\"\n\n\"She certainly oughtn't to. This makes you Galactic Admiral, no\nquestion. I'd thought, of course, of trying you out for Top Gunther, but\nthis settles that. We will support you, sir, wholeheartedly--and my\nheartfelt thanks for coming here.\"\n\n\"I have your permission, then, to give Fao a little discipline when she\nstarts rocking the boat?\"\n\n\"I wish you would, sir. I'm not too easy to get along with, I admit, but\nI've tried to meet her a lot more than half-way. She's just too damned\ncocky for _anybody's_ good.\"\n\n\"Check. I wish somebody would come along who could knock hell out of\nBelle.\" Then, aloud, \"Belle, Delcamp and I have the thing going. Do you\nwant in on it?\"\n\nDelcamp spoke to Fao, and the two women slowly, reluctantly, lowered\ntheir shields to match those of the men.\n\n\"Your Galaxian shaking of the hands--handshake, I mean--is very good,\"\nDelcamp said, and he and Garlock shook vigorously.\n\nThen the crossed pairs, and lastly the two girls--although neither put\nmuch effort into the gesture.\n\n\"Snap out of it, Belle!\" Garlock sent a tight-beamed thought. \"She isn't\ngoing to bite you!\"\n\n\"She's been trying to, damn her, and I'm going to bite her right\nback--see if I don't.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nGarlock called the meeting to order and all four sat down. The\nTellurians lighted cigarettes and the others--who, to the Earthlings'\nsurprise, also smoked--assembled and lit two peculiar-looking things\nhalf-way between pipe and cigarette. And both pairs of smokers, after a\nfew tentative tests, agreed in not liking at all the other's taste in\ntobacco.\n\n\"You know, of course, of the trip we took yesterday?\" Garlock asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Delcamp admitted. \"We read ComOff Flurnoy. We know of the seventy\nplanets, but nothing of what you found.\"\n\n\"Okay. Of the seventy planets, all have Op fields and all have two or\nmore Operators; one planet has forty-four of them. Only sixty-one of the\nplanets, however, have Primes old enough for us to detect. Each of these\nworlds has two, and only two, Primes--one male and one female--and on\neach world the two Primes are of approximately the same age. On fifteen\nof these worlds the Primes are not yet adult. On the forty-six remaining\nworlds, the Primes are young adults, from pretty much like us four down\nto considerably younger. None of these couples is married-for-family.\nNone of the girls has as yet had a child or is now pregnant.\n\n\"Now as to the information circulating all over this planet about us.\nPart of it is false. Part of it is misleading--to impress the military\nmind. Thus, the fact is that the _Pleiades_, as far as we know, is the\nonly starship in the whole galaxy. Also, the information is very\nincomplete, especially as to the all-important fact that we were lost in\nspace for some time before we discovered that the only possible\ncontroller of the Gunther Drive is the human mind....\"\n\n\"_What!!!!_\" and argument raged until Garlock stopped it by declaring\nthat he would prove it in the Margonians' own ship.\n\nThen Garlock and Belle together went on to explain and to describe--not\neven hinting, of course, that they had ever been outside the galaxy or\nhad even thought of trying to do so--their concept of what the Galaxian\nSocieties of the Galaxy would and should do; or what the Galaxian\nService could, should, and _would_ become--the Service to which they\nboth intended to devote their lives. It wasn't even in existence yet, of\ncourse. Fao and Deggi were the only other Primes they had ever talked to\nin their lives. That was why they were so eager to help the Margonians\nget their ship built. The more starships there were at work, the faster\nthe Service would grow into a really tremendous....\n\n\"_Fao's getting ready to blow her top_,\" Delcamp flashed Garlock a\ntight-beamed thought. \"_If I were doing it I'd have to start right\nnow._\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\n\"_I'll let her work up a full head of steam, then smack her\nbow-legged._\"\n\n\"_Cheers, brother! I hope you can handle her!_\"\n\n... organization. Then, when enough ships were working and enough\nGalaxian Societies were rolling, there would be the Regional\norganizations and the Galactic Council....\n\n\"So, on a one-planet basis and right out of your own little fat head,\"\nFao sneered, \"you have set yourself up as Grand High Chief Mogul, and\nall the rest of us are to crawl up to you on our bellies and kiss your\nfeet?\"\n\n\"If that's the way you want to express it, yes. However, I don't know\nhow long I personally will be in the pilot's bucket. As I told you, I\nwill enforce the basic tenet that top Gunther is top boss--man, woman,\nsnake, fish, or monster.\"\n\n\"Top Gunther be damned!\" Fao blazed. \"I don't and won't take orders from\n_any_ man--in hell or in heaven or on this Earth or on any planet of\nany....\"\n\n\"Fao!\" Delcamp exclaimed, \"Please keep still--_please_!\"\n\n\"Let her rave,\" Garlock said, coldly. \"This is just a three-year-old\nbaby's tantrum. If she keeps it up, I'll give her the damnedest jolt she\never got in all her spoiled life.\"\n\nBelle whistled sharply to call Fao's attention, then tight-beamed a\nthought. \"If you've got any part of a brain, slick chick, you'd better\nstart using it. The boy friend not only plays rough, but he doesn't\nbluff.\"\n\n\"To hell with all that!\" Fao rushed on. \"We don't have anything to do\nwith your organization--go on back home or anywhere else you want to.\nWe'll finish our own ship and build our own organization and run it to\nsuit ourselves. We'll....\"\n\n\"That's enough of that.\" Garlock penetrated her shield as easily as he\nhad the man's, and held her in lock. \"You are _not_ going to wreck this\nproject. You will start behaving yourself right now or I'll spread your\nmind wide open for Belle and Deggi to look at and see exactly what kind\nof a half-baked jerk you are. If that doesn't work, I'll put you into a\nGunther-blocked cell aboard the _Pleiades_ and keep you there until the\nship is finished and we leave Margonia. How do you want it?\"\n\nFao was shocked as she had never been shocked before. At first she tried\nviciously to fight; but, finding that useless against the appalling\npower of the mind holding hers, she stopped struggling and began really\nto think.\n\n\"That's better. You've got what it takes to think with. Go ahead and do\nit.\"\n\nAnd Fao Talaho did have it. Plenty of it. She learned.\n\n\"I'll be good,\" she said, finally. \"Honestly. I'm ashamed, really, but\nafter I got started I couldn't stop. But I can now, I'm sure.\"\n\n\"I'm sure you can, too. I know exactly how it is. All us Primes have to\nget hell knocked out of us before we amount to a whoop in Hades. Deggi\ngot his one way, I got mine another, you got yours this way. No, neither\nof the others knows anything about this conversation and they won't.\nThis is strictly between you and me.\"\n\n\"I'm awfully glad of that. And I think I ... yes, damn you, thanks!\"\n\nGarlock released her and, after a few sobs, a couple of gulps, and a\ndabbing at her eyes with an inadequate handkerchief, she said: \"I'm\nsorry, Deggi, and you, too, Belle. I'll try not to act like such a fool\nany more.\"\n\nDelcamp and Belle both stared at Garlock; Belle licked her lips.\n\n\"No comment,\" he thought at the man; and, to Belle, \"She just took a\nbeating. Will you sheathe your claws and take a lot of pains to be extra\nnice to her the rest of the day?\"\n\n\"Why, surely. I'm _always_ nice to anybody who is nice to me.\"\n\n\"Says you,\" Garlock replied, skeptically, and all four went to work as\nthough nothing had happened.\n\n        *           *           *\n\nThey went through the shops and the almost-finished ship. They studied\nblueprints. They met all the Operators and discussed generators and\nfields of force and mathematics and paraphysics and Guntherics. They\nargued so hotly about mental control that Garlock had James bring the\n_Pleiades_ over to new-christened Galaxian Field so that he could prove\nhis point then and there.\n\nEntlore and Holson came along this time, as well as the ComOff; and all\nthree were nonplussed and surprised to see each member of the \"crackpot\"\ngroup hurl the huge starship from one solar system to any other one\ndesired, apparently merely by thinking about it. And the \"crackpots\"\nwere extremely surprised to find themselves hopelessly lost in uncharted\ngalactic wildernesses every time they did not think, definitely and\npositively, of one specific destination. Then Garlock took a chance. He\nhad to take it sometime; he might just as well do it now.\n\n\"See if you can hit Andromeda, Deggi,\" he suggested.\n\nWhile Belle, James, and Lola held their breaths, Delcamp tried. The\nstarship went toward the huge nebula, but stopped at the last suitable\nplanet on the galaxy's rim.\n\n\"Can _you_ hit Andromeda?\" Delcamp asked, more than half jealously, and\nBelle tensed her muscles.\n\n\"Never tried it,\" Garlock said, easily. \"I suppose, though, since you\ncouldn't kick the old girl out of our good old home galaxy, she'll just\nsit right here for me, too.\"\n\nHe went through the motions and the _Pleiades_ did sit right\nthere--which was exactly what he had told her to do. And everybody--even\nthe \"crackpots\"--breathed more easily.\n\n        *           *           *\n\nAnd Belle was \"nice\" to Fao; she didn't use her claws, even once, all\nday. And, just before quitting time--\n\n\"Does he ... I mean, did he ever ... well, sort of knock you around?\"\nFao asked.\n\n\"I'll say he hasn't!\" Belle's nostrils flared slightly at the mere\nthought. \"I'd stick a knife into him, the big jerk.\"\n\n\"Oh, I didn't mean physically....\"\n\n\"Through my blocks? A _Prime's_ blocks? Don't be ridiculous, Fao!\"\n\n\"What do you mean, 'ridiculous'?\" Fao snapped. \"You tried _my_ blocks.\nWhat did they feel like to you--mosquito netting? What I thought was....\nOh, all he really said was that all Primes had to have hell knocked out\nof them before they could be any good. That he had had it one way, Deggi\nanother, and me a third. I see--you haven't had yours yet.\"\n\n\"I certainly haven't. And if he ever tries it, I'll....\"\n\n\"Oh, he won't. He couldn't, very well, because after you're married, it\nwould....\"\n\n\"Did the big lug tell you I was going to marry him?\"\n\n\"Of course not. No fringes, even. But who else are you going to marry?\nIf the whole universe was clear full of the finest men imaginable--pure\ndreamboats, no less--can you even conceive of you marrying any one of\nthem except him?\"\n\n\"I'm not going to marry anybody. Ever.\"\n\n\"No? You, with your Prime's mind and your Prime's body, not have any\nchildren? And you tell _me_ not to be ridiculous?\"\n\nThat stopped Belle cold, but she wouldn't admit it. Instead--\"I don't\nget it. What did he _do_ to you, anyway?\"\n\nFao's block set itself so tight that it took her a full minute to soften\nit down enough for even the thinnest thought to get through. \"That's\nsomething nobody will ever know. But anyway, unless ... unless you find\nanother Prime as strong as Clee is--and I don't really think there are\nany, do you?\"\n\n\"Of course there aren't. There's only one of his class, anywhere. He's\nit,\" Belle said, with profound conviction.\n\n\"That makes it tough for you. You'll have the toughest job imaginable.\nThe _very_ toughest. I know.\"\n\n\"Huh? What job?\"\n\n\"Since Clee won't do it for you, and since nobody else can, you'll have\nto just simply knock hell out of yourself.\"\n\nAnd in Garlock's room that night, getting ready for bed, Belle asked\nsuddenly, \"Clee, what in hell did you do to Fao Talaho?\"\n\n\"Nothing much. She's a mighty good egg, really.\"\n\n\"Could you do it, whatever it was, to me?\"\n\n\"I don't know; I never tried it.\"\n\n\"_Would_ you, then, if I asked you to?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Answer that yourself.\"\n\n\"And it was 'nothing much,' it says here in fine print. But I think I\nknow just about what it was. Don't I?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't be surprised.\"\n\n\"You knocked hell out of yourself, didn't you?\"\n\n\"I lied to her about that. I'm still trying to.\"\n\n\"So I've got to do it to myself. And I haven't started yet?\"\n\n\"Check. But you're several years younger than I am, you know.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nBelle thought it over for a minute, then stubbed out her cigarette and\nshrugged her shoulders. \"No sale. Put it back on the shelf. I like me\nbetter the way I am. That is, I _think_ I do.... In a way, though, I'm\nsorry, Clee darling.\"\n\n\"Darling? Something new has been added. I wish you really meant that,\nace.\"\n\n\"I'm still 'ace' after what I just said? I'm glad, Clee. 'Ace' is ever\nso much nicer than 'chum.'\"\n\n\"Ace. The top of the deck. You are, and always will be.\"\n\n\"As for meaning it, I wish I didn't.\" Ready for bed, Belle was much more\ncompletely and much less revealingly dressed than during her working\nhours. She slid into bed beside him, pulled the covers up to her chin,\nand turned off the light by glancing at the switch. \"If I thought\nanything could ever come of it, though, I'd do it if I had to pound\nmyself unconscious with a club. But I wouldn't be here, then,\neither--I'd scoot into my own room so fast my head would spin.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't have to. You wouldn't be here.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't, at that. That's one of the things I like so much about you.\nBut honestly, Clee--seriously, screens-down honestly--can you see any\npossible future in it?\"\n\n\"No. Neither of us would give that much. Neither of us can. And there's\nnothing one-sided about it; I'm no more fit to be a husband than you are\nto be a wife. And God help our children--they'd certainly need it.\"\n\n\"We'd never have any. I can't picture us living in marriage for nine\nmonths without committing at least mayhem. Why, in just the little time\nwe've been paired, how many times have you thrown me out of this very\nroom, with the fervent hope that I'd drown in deep space before you ever\nsaw me again?\"\n\n\"At a guess, about the same number of times as you have stormed out\nunder your own power, slamming the door so hard it sprung half the seams\nof the ship and swearing you'd slice me up into sandwich meat if I ever\nso much as looked at you again.\"\n\n\"That's what I mean. But how come we got off on _this_ subject, I\nwonder? Because when we aren't fighting, like now, it's purely\nwonderful. So I'll say it again. Good night, Clee, darling.\"\n\n\"Good night, ace.\" In the dark his lips sought hers and found them.\n\nThe fervor of her kiss was not only much more intense than any he had\never felt before. It was much, very much more intense than Belle Bellamy\nhad either wanted it or intended it to be.\n\n        *           *           *\n\nNext morning, at the workman's hour of eight o'clock, the four\nTellurians appeared in the office of Margonia's Galaxian Field.\n\n\"The first thing to do, Deggi, is to go over in detail your blueprints\nfor the generators and the drive,\" Garlock said.\n\n\"I suppose so. The funny pictures, eh?\" Delcamp had learned much, the\nprevious day; his own performance with the _Pleiades_ had humbled him\nmarkedly.\n\n\"By no means, my friend,\" Garlock said, cheerfully. \"While your stuff\nisn't exactly like ours--it couldn't be, hardly; the field is so big and\nso new--that alone is no reason for it not to work. James can tell you.\nHe's the Solar System's top engineer. What do you think, Jim?\"\n\n\"What I saw in the ship yesterday will work. What few of the prints I\nsaw yesterday will fabricate, and the fabrications will work. The main\ntrouble with this project, it seems to me, is that nobody's building the\nship.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by _that_ crack?\" Fao blazed.\n\n\"Just that. You're a bunch of prima donnas; each doing exactly as he\npleases. So some of the stuff is getting done three or four times, in\nthree or four different ways, while a lot of it isn't getting done at\nall.\"\n\n\"Such as?\" Delcamp demanded, and--\n\n\"Well, if you don't like the way we are doing things you can....\" Fao\nbegan.\n\n\"Just a minute, everybody.\" Lola came in, with a disarming grin. \"How\nmuch of that is hindsight, Jim? You've built one, you know--and from all\naccounts, progress wasn't nearly as smooth as your story can be taken to\nindicate.\"\n\n\"You've got a point there, Lola,\" Garlock agreed. \"We slid back two\nsteps for every three we took forward.\"\n\n\"Well ... maybe,\" James admitted.\n\n\"So why don't you, Fao and Deggi, put Jim in charge of construction?\"\n\nFao threw back her silvery head and glared, but Delcamp jumped at the\nchance. \"Would you, Jim?\"\n\n\"Sure--unless Miss Talaho objects.\"\n\n\"She won't.\" Delcamp's eyes locked with Fao's, and Fao kept still.\n\"Thanks immensely, Jim. And I know what you mean.\" He went over to a\ncabinet of wide, flat drawers and brought back a sheaf of drawings. Not\nblueprints, but original drawings in pencil. \"Such as this. I haven't\neven got it designed yet, to say nothing of building it.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nJames began to leaf through the stack of drawings. They were full of\nerasures, re-drawings, and such notations as \"See sheets 17-B, 21-A, and\n27-F.\" Halfway through the pile he paused, turned backward three sheets,\nand studied for minutes. Then, holding that one sheet by a corner, he\nwent rapidly through the rest of the stack.\n\n\"This is it,\" he said then, pulling the one sheet out and spreading it\nflat. \"What we call Unit Eight--the heart of the drive.\" Then,\ntight-beamed to Garlock:\n\n\"This is the thing that you designed _in toto_ and that I never could\nunderstand any part of. All I did was build it. It must generate those\nPrime fields.\"\n\n\"Probably,\" Garlock flashed back. \"I didn't understand it any too well\nmyself. How does it look?\"\n\n\"He isn't even close. He's got only half of the constants down, and half\nof the ones he has got down are wrong. Look at this mess here....\"\n\n\"I'll take your word for it. I haven't your affinity for blueprints, you\nknow, or your eidetic memory for them.\"\n\n\"Do you want me to give him the whole works?\"\n\n\"We'll have to, I think. Or the ship might not work at all.\"\n\n\"Could be--but how about intergalactic hops?\"\n\n\"He couldn't do it with the _Pleiades_, so he won't be able to with\nthis. Besides, if we change it in any particular he _might_. You see, I\ndon't know very much more about Unit Eight than you do.\"\n\n\"_That_ could be, too.\" Then, as though just emerging from his\nconcentration on the drawings, James thought at Delcamp and Fao, but on\nthe open, general band.\n\n\"A good many errors and a lot of blanks, but in general you're on the\nright track. I can finish up this drawing in a couple of hours, and we\ncan build the unit in a couple of days. With that in place, the rest of\nthe ship will go fast.\n\n\"_If_ Miss Talaho wants me to,\" he concluded, pointedly.\n\n\"Oh, I do, Jim--really I do!\" At long last, stiff-backed Fao softened\nand bent. She seized both his hands. \"If you can, it'd be too wonderful\nfor words!\"\n\n\"Okay. One question. Why are you building your ship so small?\"\n\n\"Why, it's plenty big enough for two,\" Delcamp said. \"For four, in a\npinch. Why did you make yours so big? Your Main is big enough almost for\na convention hall.\"\n\n\"That's what we figured it might have to be, at times,\" Garlock said.\n\"But that's a very minor point. With yours so nearly ready to flit, no\nchange in size is indicated now. But Belle and I have got to have\nanother conference with the legal eagle. So if you and Brownie, Jim,\nwill 'port whatever you need out of the _Pleiades_, we'll be on our way.\n\n\"So long--see you in a few days,\" he added, and the _Pleiades_ vanished;\nto appear instantaneously high above the stratosphere over what was to\nbecome the Galaxian Field of Earth.\n\n        *           *           *\n\n\"Got a minute, Gene?\" he sent a thought.\n\n\"For you two Primes, as many as you like. We haven't started building or\nfencing yet, as you suggested, but we have bought all the real estate.\nSo land the ship anywhere out there and I'll send a jeep out after you.\"\n\n\"Thanks, but no jeep. Nobody but you knows that we've really got control\nof the _Pleiades_, and I want everybody else to keep on thinking it's\nstrictly for the birds. We'll 'port in to your office whenever you say.\"\n\n\"I say now.\"\n\nIn no time at all the two Primes were seated in the private office of\nEugene Evans, Head of the Legal Department of the newly re-incorporated\nGalaxian Society of Sol, Inc. Evans was a tall man, slightly thin,\nslightly stooped, whose thick tri-focals did nothing whatever to hide\nthe keenness of his steel-gray eyes.\n\n\"The first thing, Gene,\" Garlock said, \"is this employment contract\nthing. Have you figured out a way to break it?\"\n\n\"It can't be broken.\" The lawyer shook his head.\n\n\"Huh? I thought you top-bracket legal eagles could break anything, if\nyou really tried.\"\n\n\"A good many things, yes, especially if they're long and complicated.\nThe Standard Employment Contract, however, is short, explicit, and\niron-clad. The employer can discharge the employee for any one of a\nnumber of offenses, including insubordination; which, as a matter of\nfact, the employer himself is allowed to define. On the other hand, the\nemployee cannot quit except for some such fantastic reason as the\nnon-tendering--not non-payment, mind you, but non-_tendering_--of\nsalary.\"\n\n\"I didn't expect that--it kicks us in the teeth before we get started.\"\nGarlock got up, lighted a cigarette, and prowled about the big room.\n\"Okay. Jim and I will have to get ourselves fired, then.\"\n\n\"Fired!\" Belle snorted. \"Clee, you talk like a man with a paper nose!\nWho else could run the Project? That is,\" her whole manner changed; \"he\ndoesn't know I can run it as well as you can--or better--but I could\ntell him--and maybe you think I wouldn't!\"\n\n\"You won't have to. Gene, you can start spreading the news that Belle\nBellamy is a real, honest-to-God Prime Operator in every respect. That\nshe knows more about Project Gunther than I do and could run it better.\nFerber undoubtedly knows that Belle and I have been at loggerheads ever\nsince we first met--spread it thick that we're fighting worse than ever.\nWhich, by the way, is the truth.\"\n\n\"Fighting? Why, you seemed friendly enough....\"\n\n\"Yeah, we can be friendly for about fifteen minutes if we try real hard,\nas now. The cold fact is, though, that she's just as much three-quarters\nhellcat and one-quarter potassium cyanide as she....\"\n\n\"I like _that!_\" Belle stormed. She leaped to her feet, her eyes\nshooting sparks. \"All _my_ fault! Why, you self-centered, egotistical,\ndomineering jerk, I could write a book....\"\n\n\"That's enough--let it go--_please!_\" Evans pleaded. He jumped up, took\neach of the combatants by a shoulder, sat them down into the chairs they\nhad vacated, and resumed his own seat. \"The demonstration was eminently\nsuccessful. I will spread the word, through several channels. Chancellor\nFerber will get it all, rest assured.\"\n\n\"And _I'll_ get the job!\" Belle snapped. \"And maybe you think I won't\ntake it!\"\n\n\"Yeah?\" came Garlock's searing thought. \"You'd do anything to get it and\nto keep it. Yeah. I _do_ think.\"\n\n\"Oh?\" Belle's body stiffened, her face hardened. \"I've heard stories, of\ncourse, but I couldn't quite ... but surely, he can't be _that_\nstupid--to think he can buy me like so many pounds of calf-liver?\"\n\n\"He surely is. He does. And it works. That is, if he's ever missed,\nnobody ever heard of it.\"\n\n\"But how could a man in such a big job _possibly_ get away with such\nfoul stuff as that?\"\n\n\"Because all the SSE is interested in is money, and Alonzo P. Ferber is\na tremendously able top executive. In the big black-and-red money books\nhe's always 'way, 'way up in the black, and nobody cares about his\nconduct.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nBelle, even though she was already convinced, glanced questioningly at\nEvans.\n\n\"That's it, Miss Bellamy. That's it, in a precise, if somewhat crude,\nnutshell.\"\n\n\"That's that, then. But just how, Clee--if he's as smart as you say he\nis--do you think you can make him fire you?\"\n\n\"I don't know--haven't thought about it yet. But I could be pretty\ninsubordinate if I really tried.\"\n\n\"That's the understatement of the century.\"\n\n\"I'll devote the imponderable force of the intellect to the problem and\ncheck with you later. Now, Gene, about the proposed Galactic Service,\nthe Council, and so on. What is the reaction? Yours, personally, and\nothers?\"\n\n\"My personal reaction is immensely favorable; I think it the greatest\nadvance that humanity has ever made. I have been very cautious, of\ncourse, in discussing, or even mentioning the matter, but the reaction\nof everyone I have sounded--good men; big men in their respective\nfields--has been as enthusiastic as my own.\"\n\n\"Good. It won't surprise you, probably, to be told that you are to be\nthis system's councillor and--if we can swing it and I think we can--the\nfirst President of the Galactic Council?\"\n\nEvans was so surprised that it was almost a minute before he could reply\ncoherently. Then: \"I _am_ surprised--very much so. I thought, of course,\nthat you yourself would....\"\n\n\"Far from it!\" Garlock said, positively. \"I'm not the type. You are.\nYou're better than anyone else of the Galaxians--which means than anyone\nelse period. With the possible exception of Lola, and she fits better on\nour exploration team. Check, Belle?\"\n\n\"Check. For once, I agree with you without reservation. _That's_ a job\nwe can work at all the rest of our lives, and scarcely start it.\"\n\n\"True--indubitably true. I appreciate your confidence in me, and if the\nvote so falls I will do whatever I can.\"\n\n\"We know you will, and thank _you_. How long will it take to organize? A\ncouple of weeks? And is there anything else we have to cover now?\"\n\n\"A couple of _weeks!_\" Evans was shocked. \"You are naive indeed, young\nman, to think anything of this magnitude can even be started in such a\nshort time as that. And yes, there are dozens of matters--hundreds--that\nshould be discussed before I can even start to work intelligently.\"\n\nHence discussions went on and on and on. It was three days before\nGarlock and Belle 'ported themselves up into the _Pleiades_ and the\nstarship displaced itself instantaneously to Margonia.\n\n        *           *           *\n\nMeanwhile, on Margonia, James James James the Ninth went directly to the\nheart of his job by leading Lola and Fao into Delcamp's office and\nsetting up its Gunther blocks.\n\n\"You said you want me to build your starship. Okay, but I want you\nboth--Fao especially--to realize exactly what that means. I know what to\ndo and how to do it. I can handle your Operators and get the job done.\nHowever, I can't handle either of you, since you both out-Gunther me,\nand I'm not going to try to. But there can't be two bosses on any one\njob, to say nothing of three or seventeen. So either I run the job or I\ndon't. If either of you steps in, I step out and don't come back in. And\nremember that you're not doing us any favors--it's strictly vice versa.\"\n\n\"Jim!\" Lola protested. Fao's hackles were very evidently on the rise;\nDelcamp's face was hardening. \"Don't be so rough, Jim, _please_. That's\nno way to....\"\n\n\"If you can pretty this up, pet, I'll be glad to have you say it for me.\nHere's what you have to work on. If I do the job they'll have their\nstarship in a few weeks. The way they've been going, they won't have it\nin twenty-five years. And the only way to get that bunch out there to\nreally work is to tell each one of them to cooperate or else--and\nenforce the 'or else.'\"\n\n\"But they'd quit!\" Delcamp protested. \"They'll _all_ quit!\"\n\n\"With suspension or expulsion from the Society the consequences?\nHardly.\" James said.\n\n\"But you wouldn't do that--you couldn't.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't?\"\n\n\"Of course he wouldn't,\" Lola put in, soothingly, \"except as a very last\nresort. And, even at worst, Jim could build it almost as easily with\ncommon labor. You Primes don't really _have_ to have any Operators at\nall, you know; but all your Operators together would be perfectly\nhelpless without at least one Prime.\"\n\n\"How come?\" and \"In what way?\" Delcamp and Fao demanded together.\n\n\"Oh, didn't you know? After the ship is built and the fields are charged\nand so on, everything has to be activated--the hundred and one things\nthat make it so nearly alive--and that is strictly a Prime's job. Even\nJim can't do it.\"\n\n\"I see ... or, rather, I don't see at all,\" Fao said, thoughtfully. She\nwas no longer either excited or angry. \"A few weeks against twenty-five\nyears ... what do you think of his time estimate, Deg my dear?\"\n\n\"I hadn't thought it would take nearly that long; but this 'activation'\nthing scares me. Nothing in my theory even hints at any such thing.\nSo--if there's so much I don't know yet, even in theory, it would take a\nlong time. Maybe I'd never get it.\"\n\n\"Well, anyway, I want our _Celestial Queen_ done in weeks, not years,\"\nFao said, extending her hand to James and shaking his vigorously. \"So I\npromise not to interfere a bit. If I feel any such urge coming on, I'll\ndash home and lock myself up in a closet until it dies. Fair enough?\"\n\nSince Fao really meant it, that was fair enough.\n\n        *           *           *\n\nFor a whole day James did nothing except study blueprints; going over in\ndetail and practically memorizing every drawing that had been made. He\nthen went over the ship, studying minutely every part, plate, member,\nmachine and instrument that had been installed. He noted what each man\nand woman was doing and what they intended to do. He went over material\non hand and material on order, paying particular attention to times of\ndelivery. He then sent a few--surprisingly few--telegrams.\n\nFinally he called all fourteen Operators together. He told them exactly\nwhat the revised situation was and exactly what he was going to do about\nit. He invited comments.\n\nThere was of course a riot of protest; but--in view of what James had\nsaid anent suspensions and expulsions from the Galaxian Society--not one\nof them actually did quit. Four of them, however, did appeal to Delcamp,\nconsiderably to his surprise, to oust the interloper and to put things\nback where they had been; but they did not get much satisfaction.\n\n\"James says that he can finish building this starship in a few weeks,\"\nDelcamp told them, flatly. \"Specifically, three weeks, if we can get the\nspecial stuff made fast enough. Fao and I believe him. Therefore, we\nhave put him in full charge. He will remain in charge unless and until\nhe fails in performance. You are all good friends of Fao's and mine, and\nwe hope that all of you will stay with the project. If, however, we must\nchoose now between you--any one of you or all of you--and James, there\nis no need to tell you what the choice will be.\"\n\nWherefore all fourteen went back to work; grudgingly at first and\ndragging their feet. In a very few hours, however, it became evident to\nall that James did in fact know what he was doing and that the work was\ngoing faster and smoother than ever before; whereupon all opposition and\nall malingering disappeared. They were Operators, and they were all\nintensely interested in their ship. Morale was at a high.\n\nThus, when the _Pleiades_ landed beside the now seething _Celestial\nQueen_, Garlock found James with feet on desk, hands in pockets, and\nscanner on head; doing--apparently--nothing at all. Nevertheless, he was\na very busy man.\n\n\"Hey, Jim!\" A soprano shriek of thought emanated from a gorgeous\nseventeen-year-old blonde. \"I can't read this funny-picture, it's been\nfolded too many times. Where does this lead go to?\"\n\n\"Data insufficient. Careful, Vingie; I'd hate to have to send you back\nto school.\"\n\n\"'Scuse, please, Junior. Unit Six, Sub-Assembly Tee Dash Ni-yun.\nTerminal Fo-wer. From said terminal, there's a lead--Bee Sub\nsomething-or-other--goes somewhere. Where?\"\n\n\"B sub Four. It goes to Unit Seven, Sub-Assembly Q dash Three, Terminal\nTwo. And watch your insulation--that's a mighty hot lead.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh, I got that. Double Sink Mill Mill; Class Albert Dog Kittens.\nThanks, boss!\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\n\"Hi, Jim,\" Garlock said. Then, to Delcamp. \"I see you're rolling.\"\n\n\"_He's_ rolling, you mean.\" Delcamp had not yet recovered fully from a\nstate of near-shock. \"So _that's_ what an eidetic memory is? He knows\nevery nut, bolt, lead, and coil in the ship!\"\n\n\"More than that. He's checking every move everybody makes. When they're\ndone, you won't have to just hope everything was put together\nright--you'll _know_ it was.\"\n\nJim was their man.\n\n        *           *           *\n\nAnd Fao sidled over toward Belle. There was something new about the\nsilver-haired girl, Belle decided instantly. The difference was\nslight--Belle couldn't put her finger on it at first. She\nseemed--quieter? Softer? More subdued? No, definitely. More feminine?\nNo; that would be impossible. More ... more adult? Belle hated to admit\nit, even to herself, but that was what it was.\n\n\"Deg and I got married day before yesterday,\" Fao confided, via tight\nbeam.\n\n\"Oh--so you're _pregnant!_\"\n\n\"Of course. I saw to that the first thing. I knew you'd want to be the\nfirst one to know. Oh, isn't it _wonderful_?\" She seized Belle's arm and\nhugged it ecstatically against her side. \"Just too perfectly marvelous\nfor _anything_?\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm sure it is; and I'm so happy for you, Fao!\" And it would have\ntaken the mind of a Garlock to perceive anything either false or forced\nin thought or bearing.\n\nNevertheless, when Belle went into Garlock's room that night, storm\nsignals were flying high in her almost-topaz eyes.\n\n\"Fao Talaho-Delcamp is _pregnant_!\" she stormed, \"and it's all _your_\nfault!\"\n\n\"Uh-huh,\" he demurred, trying to snap her out of her obviously savage\nmood. \"Not me, ace. Not a chance in the world. It was Deggi.\"\n\n\"You ... you _weasel_! You know very well, Clee Garlock, what I meant.\nIf you hadn't given her that treatment she'd have kept on fighting with\nhim and they wouldn't have been married and had any children for\npositively _years_. So now she'll have the first double-Prime baby and\nit ought to be _mine_. I'm older than she is--our group is 'way ahead of\ntheirs--we have the first and _only_ starship--and then you do _that_.\nAnd you wouldn't give _me_ that treatment. Oh, no--just to _her_, that\nbleached-blonde! I'd like to strangle you to death with my own bare\nhands!\"\n\n\"What a hell of a logic!\" Garlock had been trying to keep his own temper\nin leash, but the leash was slipping. \"Assume I tried to work on\nyou--assume I succeeded--what would you be? What would I have? What age\ndo you think this is--that of the Vikings? When SOP in getting a wife\nwas to beat her unconscious with a club and drag her into the longboat\nby her hair? Hardly! I do not want and will not have a conquered woman.\nNor a spoiled-rotten, mentally-retarded brat....\"\n\n\"You unbearable, conceited, overbearing jerk! Why, I'd rather....\"\n\n\"Get out! And _this_ time, _stay_ out!\"\n\nBelle got out--and if door and frame had not been built of super-steel,\nboth would have been wrecked by the blast of energy she loosed in\nclosing the door behind her.\n\nIn her own room, with Gunther blocks full on, she threw herself face\ndown on the bed and cried as she had not cried since she was a child.\n\nAnd finally, without even taking off her clothes, she cried herself to\nsleep.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 8\n\n\nNext morning, early, Belle tapped lightly on Garlock's door.\n\n\"Come in.\"\n\nShe did so. \"Have you had your coffee?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"So have I.\"\n\nNeither Belle nor Garlock had recovered; both faces showed strain and\ndrain.\n\n\"I think we'd better break this up,\" Belle said, quietly.\n\n\"Check. We'll have to, if we expect to get any work done.\"\n\nBelle could not conceal her surprise.\n\n\"Oh, not for the reason you think,\" Garlock went on, quickly. \"Your\nrecord as a man-killer is still one hundred point zero zero zero\npercent. I've been in love with you ever since we paired. Before that,\neven.\"\n\n\"Flapdoodle!\" she snorted, inelegantly. \"Why, I....\"\n\n\"Keep still a minute. And I'm not going to fight with you again. Ever.\nI'm not going to touch you again until I can control myself a lot better\nthan I could last night.\"\n\n\"Oh? That was mostly my fault, of course. But in love? Uh-uh, I've seen\nmen in love. You aren't. I couldn't make you be, not with the best I\ncould do. Not even in bed. You aren't, Clee--if you are, I'm an\nAustralian bushman.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I'm an atypical case. I'm not raving about your perfect\nbody--you know what that is like already. Nor about your mind, which is\nthe only one I know of as good as my own. Maybe I'm in love with what I\nthink you ought to be ... or what I hope you will be. Anyway, I'm in\nlove with _something_ connected with you--and with no other woman alive.\nShall we go eat?\"\n\n\"Uh-huh--let's.\"\n\nThey joined Lola and James at the table; and if Lola noticed anything\nout of the ordinary, she made no sign.\n\nAnd after breakfast, in the Main--\n\n\"About three weeks, Jim, you think?\" Garlock asked.\n\n\"Give or take a couple of days, yes.\"\n\n\"And Belle and I would just be in the way--at least until time to show\nDeggi about the activation ... and all those Primes to organize ... we'd\nbetter leave you here, don't you think, and get going?\"\n\n\"I'll buy that. We'll finish as soon as possible.\"\n\nLola and James moved a few personal belongings planetside; Garlock and\nBelle shot the _Pleiades_ across a vast gulf of space to one of the\nplanets they had scanned so fleetingly on their preliminary survey. Its\nname was, both remembered, Lizoria; its two Primes were named Rezdo\nSemolo and Mirea Mitala--male and female, respectively.\n\nAfter sending down a very brief and perfunctory request for\naudience--which was in effect a declaration of intent and nothing\nelse--Garlock and Belle teleported themselves down into Semolo's office,\nwhere both Lizorian Primes were.\n\nBoth got up out of peculiar-looking chairs to face their visitors. Both\nwere tall; both were peculiarly thin. Not the thinness of emaciation,\nbut that of bodily structure.\n\n\"On them it looks good,\" Belle tight-beamed a thought to Garlock.\n\nBoth moved fast and with exquisite control; both were extraordinarily\ngraceful. \"Snaky\" was Belle's thought of the woman; \"sinuous\" was\nGarlock's of the man. Both were completely hairless, of body and of\nhead--not by nature, but via electric-shaver clipping. Both wore\nsandals. The man wore shorts and a shirt-like garment of nylon or its\nlike; the woman wore just enough ribbons and bands to hold a hundred\nthousand credits' worth of jewels in place. She appeared to be about\ntwenty years--Tellurian equivalent--old; he was probably twenty-three or\ntwenty-four.\n\n\"We did not invite you in and we do not want you here,\" Semolo said,\ncoldly. \"So get out, both of you. If you don't, when I count three I'll\nthrow you out, and I won't be too careful about how many of your bones I\nbreak. One.... Two....\"\n\n\"Pipe down, Rezdo!\" the girl exclaimed. \"They have something we haven't,\nor they wouldn't be here. Whatever it is, we want it.\"\n\n\"Oh, let him try, Miss Mitala,\" Garlock said, through her hard-held\nblock, in the depth of her mind. \"He won't hurt us a bit and it may do\nhim some good. While he's wasting effort I'll compare notes with my\npartner here, Galactic Vice-Admiral Belle Bellamy. I'm glad to see that\none of you has at least a part of a brain.\"\n\n\"... Three!\" Semolo did his best, with everything he had, without even\nattracting Garlock's attention. He then tried to leap at the intruder\nphysically, despite the latter's tremendous advantage in weight and\nmuscle, but found that he could not move.\n\nThen, through Belle's solidly-set blocks, \"How are you doing, ace?\nGetting anywhere?\"\n\n\"My God!\" came Belle's mental shriek. \"What--how can--but no, you\n_didn't_ give _that_ to Fao, surely!\"\n\n\"I'll say I didn't--nor to Delcamp. But you're going to need it, I'm\nthinking.\"\n\n\"But _can_ you? Even if you _would_--and I'm just beginning to realize\nhow big a man you really are--can that kind of stuff be taught? I\nprobably haven't got the brain-cells it takes to handle it.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure, but I've reworked our Prime Fields into one and made a\ncouple of other changes. Theoretically, it ought to work. Shall I come\nin and try it?\"\n\n\"Don't be an idiot, darling. _Of course!_\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nAs impersonally as a surgeon exploring an organ, Garlock went into\nBelle's mind. \"Tune to the field ... that's it--fine! Then--I'll do it\nreal slow, and watch me close--you do like so ... get it?\"\n\n\"Uh-huh!\" Belle breathed, excitedly. \"Got it!\"\n\n\"Then this ... and this ... and there you are. You can try it on me, if\nyou like.\"\n\n\"Uh-uh. No sale. I don't need practice and I'd like to preserve the\nbeautiful illusion that maybe I _could_ crack your shield if I wanted\nto. I'll work on Miss Snake-Hips here, the serpentine charmer--but say,\nI'll bet there's a bone in it. _You_ can block it, can't you?\"\n\n\"Yes. It goes like this.\" He showed her. \"It takes full mastery of the\nPrime Field, but you've got that.\"\n\n\"Oh, wonderful! Thanks, Clee darling. But do you mean to actually say I\ncan now completely block you or any other Prime out?\"\n\n\"You're going too far, ace. Me, yes--but don't forget that there very\nwell may be people--or things--as far ahead of us as we are ahead of\npointer pups.\"\n\n\"Huh! Balloon-juice and prop-wash! I just _know_, Clee, that you're the\nabsolute tops of the whole, entire, macrocosmic universe.\"\n\n\"Well, we can dream, of course.\" Garlock withdrew his mind from Belle's\nand turned his attention to the now quiet Semolo. \"Well, my\nover-confident and contumacious young squirt; are you done horsing\naround or do you want to keep it up until you addle completely what few\nbrains you have?\"\n\nThe Lizorian made no reply; but merely glared.\n\n\"The trouble with you half-baked, juvenile--I almost added 'delinquent'\nto that, and perhaps I should have--Primes is that you know too damned\nmuch that isn't true. As an old Tellurian saying hath it, 'you're\naltogether too big for your britches.'\n\n\"Thus, simply because you have lived a few years on one single planet\nand haven't encountered anyone able to stand up to you, you've sold\nyourself on the idea that there's nobody, anywhere, who can. You're\nwrong--you couldn't be more so if you had an army to help you.\n\n\"What, actually, have you done? What, actually, have you got?\nPractically nothing. You haven't even started a starship; you've\nscarcely started making plans. You realize dimly that the theory is not\nin any of the books, that you'll have to slug it out for yourself, but\nthat is _work_. So you're still just posing and throwing your weight\naround.\n\n\"As a matter of fact, you're merely a drop in a lake. There are\nthousands of millions of planets, and thousands of millions of Prime\nOperators. Most of them are probably a lot stronger than you are; many\nof them may be stronger than my partner and I are. I am not at all\ncertain that you will pass even the first screening; but since you are\nwithout question a Prime Operator, I will deliver the message we came to\ndeliver. Miss Mitala, do you want to listen or shall we drive it into\nyou, too?\"\n\n\"I want to listen to anyone or anything who has a working starship and\nwho can do what you have just done.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" and Garlock told the general-distribution version of the\nstory of the Galactic Service.\n\n\"Quite interesting,\" Semolo said loftily, at its end. \"Whether or not I\nwould be interested depends, of course, on whether there's a position\nhigh enough for....\"\n\n\"I doubt very much if there's one low enough,\" Garlock cut in sharply.\n\"However, since it's part of my job, I'll get in touch with you later.\nOkay, Belle.\"\n\nAnd in the Main--\"What a jerk!\" Belle exclaimed. \"What a half-cooked,\nhalf-digested _pill_! I simply marvel at your forbearance, Clee. You\nshould have turned him inside out and hung him up to dry--especially\nbehind the ears!\" Then, suddenly, she giggled. \"But do you know what I\ndid?\"\n\n\"I can guess. A couple of shots in the arm?\"\n\n\"Uh-huh. Next time he pitches into her she'll slap his ears right off.\nOh, _brother_!\"\n\n\"Check and double-check. But let's hop to Number Two.... Here it is.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" came a smooth, clear, diamond-sharp thought in reply to\nGarlock's introductory call. \"This world, as you have perceived, is\nFalne. I am indeed Baver 14WD27, my companion Prime is indeed Glarre\n12WD91. You are, we perceive, Bearers of the Truth; of great skill and\nof high advancement. Your visit here will, I am sure, be of immense\nbenefit to us and possibly, I hope, of some small benefit to you. We\nwill both be delighted to have you both 'port yourselves to us at once.\"\n\nThe Tellurians did so--and in the very instant of appearance Garlock was\nmet by a blast of force the like of which he had never even imagined.\nThe two Falnian Primes, capable operators both, had built up their\nhighest possible potentials and had launched both terrific bolts without\nany hint of warning.\n\nBelle's mind, however, was already fused with Garlock's. Their combined\nblocks were instantaneous in action; their counter-thrust was nearly so.\nBoth Falnians staggered backward until they were stopped by the room's\nwall.\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" Garlock said, then. \"You are indeed, in a small and feeble\nway, Seekers after the Truth; of which we are indeed Bearers. Lesser\nBearers, perhaps, but still Bearers. You will indeed profit greatly from\nour visit. You err, however, in thinking that we may in any respect\nprofit from you. You have nothing whatever that we have not had for\nlong. Now let us, if you please, take a few seconds of time to get\nacquainted, each with the other.\"\n\n\"That, indeed, is the logical and seemly thing to do.\" Both Falnians\nstraightened up and stepped forward; neither arrogantly nor\napologetically, but simply as though nothing at all out of the ordinary\nhad taken place.\n\nEach pair studied the other. Physically, the two pairs were surprisingly\nalike. Baver was almost as big as Garlock; almost as heavily muscled.\nGlarre could have been cast in Belle's own mold.\n\n        *           *           *\n\nWith that, however, all resemblance ceased.\n\nBoth Falnians were naked. The man wore only a belt and pouch in lieu of\npockets; the woman only a leather carryall slung from one shoulder--big\nenough, Garlock thought, to hold a week's supplies for an Explorer\nScout.\n\nHis hair was thick, bushy, unkempt; sun-bleached to a nondescript blend\nof pale colors. Hers--long, heavy, meticulously middle-parted and\ndressed--was a startling two-tone job. To the right of the part it was a\nsearingly brilliant red; to the left, an equally brilliant royal blue.\n\nHis skin was deeply tanned. The color of hers was completely masked by a\nbizarrely spectacular overlay of designs done in semi-indelible,\nmulti-colored dyes.\n\n\"Ah, you are worthy indeed of receiving an increment of Truth. Hear,\nthen, the message we bring,\" and again Garlock told the story.\n\n\"We thank you, sir and madam, from our hearts. We will accept with joy\nyour help in finishing our ship; we will do all that in us lies to\nfurther the cause of the Galactic Service. Until a day, then?\"\n\n\"Until a day.\" Then, to Belle, \"Okay, ace. Ready? Go!\"\n\nAnd up in the Main--\"Sweet Sin!\" Belle exclaimed. \"What a pair _they_\nturned out to be! Clee, that simply scared me witless.\"\n\n\"You can play that in spades.\" Garlock jammed his hands into his pockets\nand prowled about the room, his face a black scowl of concentration.\n\nUntil, finally, he pulled himself out of the brown study and said: \"I've\nbeen trying to think if there's any other thing, however slight, that I\nhave and you haven't. There isn't. You've got it all. You're just as\nfast as I am, just as sharp and as accurate--and, since we now draw on\nthe same field, just as strong.\"\n\n\"Why Clee! You're worrying about _me_? You've done altogether too much\nfor me, already.\"\n\n\"Anything I can do, I've got to do ... well, shall we go?\"\n\n\"We shall.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nThey visited four more planets that day. And after supper that night,\nstanding in the corridor between their doors, Belle began to soften her\nshield, as though to send a thought. Almost instantly, however, she\nchanged her mind and snapped it back to full on.\n\n\"Good night, Clee,\" she said.\n\n\"Good night, Belle,\" and each went into his own room.\n\nThe next day they worked nine planets, and the day after that they\nworked ten. They ate supper in friendly fashion; then strolled together\nacross the Main, to a davenport.\n\n\"It's funny,\" Belle said thoughtfully, \"having this tremendous ship all\nto ourselves. To have a private conference right out here in the Main\n... or is it?\"\n\nHe triggered the shields, she watched him do it. \"It is now,\" he assured\nher.\n\n\"Prime-proof? Not ordinary Gunther blocks?\"\n\n\"Uh-huh. Two hundred kilovolts and four hundred kilogunts. Backed by\nall the force of the Prime and Op fields and the full power of the\nengines. I told you I'd made some changes in the set-up.\"\n\n\"Private enough, I guess ... what a mess those Primes are! And we'll\nhave to make the rounds twice more--when we alert 'em and when we pick\n'em up.\"\n\n\"Not necessarily. This new set-up ought to give us a galaxy-wide reach.\nLet's try Semolo, on Lizoria, shall we?\"\n\n\"Uh-huh--Let's.\"\n\n\"Tune in, then ace.\"\n\n\"_Ace_, darling?\"\n\n\"Ace, _Darling_?\"\n\n\"Darling. You said you weren't going to fight with me any more.\nOkay--I'm not going to try any more to lick you until after I've licked\nmyself. I'm tuned--you may fire when ready, Gridley.\"\n\nThey fired--and hit the mark dead center. Top-lofty and arrogant and\nbelligerent as ever, the Lizorian Prime took the call. \"I thought all\nthe time you wanted something. Well, I neither want nor need....\"\n\n\"Cut it, you unlicked cub, until you can begin to use that half-liter of\ngolop you call a brain,\" Garlock said, harshly. \"We're just trying out a\nnew ultra-communicator. Thanks for your help.\"\n\nOn the fourth day they worked eleven planets; the fifth day saw the\nforty-sixth planet done and the immediate job finished. All during\nsupper, it was very evident that Belle had something on her mind.\n\nAfter eating, she went out into the Main and slumped down on a\ndavenport. Garlock followed her. A cigarette leaped out of a closed box\nand into place between her lips. It came alight. She smoked it slowly,\nwithout relish; almost as though she did not know that she was smoking.\n\n\"Might as well get it out of your system, Belle,\" Garlock said aloud.\n\"What are you thinking about at the moment?\"\n\nBelle exhaled; the half-smoked butt vanished. \"At the moment I was\nthinking about Gunther blocks. Specifically, their total inability to\ncope with that new Prime probe of yours.\" She stared at him,\nnarrow-eyed. \"It goes through them just like nothing at all.\" She\npaused; eyed him questioningly.\n\n\"No comment.\"\n\n\"And yet you gave it to me. Freely, of your own accord. Even before I\nneeded it. Why?\"\n\n\"Still no comment.\"\n\n\"You'd better comment, Buster, before I blow my top.\"\n\n\"There is such a thing as urbanity.\"\n\n\"I've heard of it, yes; even though you never did believe I ever had\nany. You _talk_ a good game of urbanity, but your brand of it would\nnever carry you _that_ far....\"\n\nShe paused. He remained silent. She went on.\n\n\"Of course, it does put a lot of pressure on me to develop myself.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you used the word 'develop' instead of 'treat.'\"\n\n\"Oh, sometimes--at rare intervals--I'm not exactly dumb. But you\nknew--you _must_ have known--what a horrible risk you took in making me\nas tremendously powerful as you are.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\n\"Some, perhaps, but very definitely less risky than not doing it.\"\n\n\"Getting information out of you is harder than pulling teeth. Clee\nGarlock, I want you to tell me _why!_\"\n\n\"Very well.\" Garlock's jaw set. \"You've had it in mind all along that\nthis is some kind of a lark; that you and I are Gunther Tops of the\nuniverse. Or did that belief weaken a bit when we met Baver 14WD27?\"\n\n\"Well, perhaps--a little. However, the probability is becoming greater\nwith every planet we visit. After all, _some_ race has to be tops. Why\n_shouldn't_ it be us?\"\n\n\"_What_ a logic--excuse me, skip it....\"\n\n\"Oh, you really _meant_ it when you said you weren't going to fight with\nme any more?\"\n\n\"I'm going to try not to. Now, remembering that I don't consider your\npremise valid, just suppose that when we visit some planet some day, you\nget your mind burned out and I don't--solely because I had something I\ncould have given you and wouldn't. What then?\"\n\n\"Oh. I thought that was what you ... but suppose I can't....\"\n\n\"We won't suppose anything of the kind. But that wasn't all that was on\nyour mind. Nor most.\"\n\n\"How true. Those Primes. The women. Honestly, Clee, I never saw--never\nimagined--such a bunch of exhibitionistic, obstreperous, obnoxious,\nswell-headed, hussies in my whole life. And every day it was borne in on\nme more and more that I was--am--exactly like the rest of them.\"\n\nGarlock was wise enough to say nothing, and Belle went on: \"I've been\ntalking a good game of licking myself, but this time I'm going to _do_\nit.\"\n\nShe jumped up and doubled her fists. \"If you can do it, I can,\" she\ndeclared. \"Like the ancient ballad--'Anything you can do I can do\nbetter.'\" She tried to be jaunty, but the jauntiness did not ring quite\ntrue.\n\n\"That's an unfortunate quotation, I'm afraid. The trouble is, I\nhaven't.\"\n\n\"Huh? Don't be an idiot, Clee. You certainly have--what else do _you_\nsuppose put me so far down into the dumps?\"\n\n\"In that case, you _certainly_ will. So come on up out of the dumps.\"\n\n\"Wilco--and I certainly will. But for a woman who has been talking so\nbig, I feel low in my mind. A good-night kiss, Clee, darling? Just\none--and just a little one, at that?\"\n\n\"Sweetheart!\"\n\nThere were more than one, and none of them was little. Eventually,\nhowever, the two stood, arms still around each other, in the corridor\nbetween their doors.\n\n\"But kissing's as far as it goes, isn't it,\" Belle said. The remark was\nnot a question; nor was it quite a statement.\n\n\"That's right.\"\n\n\"So good night, darling.\"\n\n\"Good night, ace.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nAnd when they next saw each other, at the breakfast table, Belle was\napparently her usual dauntless self.\n\n\"Hi, darling--sit down,\" she said, gaily. \"Your breakfast is on the\ntable. Bacon, eggs, toast, strawberry jam, and a liter of coffee.\"\n\n\"Nice! Thanks, ace.\"\n\nThey ate in silence for a few minutes; then her hand crept tentatively\nacross the table. He pressed it warmly. \"You look a million, Belle. Out\nof the dumps?\"\n\n\"Pretty much--in most ways. One way, though, I'm in deeper than ever.\nYou see, I know exactly what you did to Fao Talaho; and why neither you\nor anybody else could do it to me. Or if they could, what would happen\nif they did.\"\n\n\"I was hoping you would. I couldn't very well tell you, before, but....\"\n\n\"Of course not. I see that.\"\n\n\"... the fact is that Fao, and all the others we've met, are young\nenough, unformed enough--plastic enough--yes, damn it, _weak_ enough--to\nbend. But you are tremendously strong, and twelve Rockwell numbers\nharder than a diamond. You wouldn't bend. If enough stress could be\napplied--and that's decidedly questionable--you wouldn't bend. You'd\nbreak, and I can't figure it. You're a little older, of course, but not\nenough to....\"\n\n\"How about the fact that I've been banging myself for eight years\nagainst Cleander Garlock, the top Prime of the universe and the hardest?\nThat might have something to do with it, don't you think?\"\n\nGarlock said, \"Indefensible conclusions drawn from insufficient data.\nThat's just what I've been talking about. No matter how we got the way\nwe are, though, the fact is that you and I have got to fight our own\nbattles and bury our own dead.\"\n\n\"Check. Like having a baby, but worse. There's nothing anybody else can\ndo--even you--except maybe hold my hand, like now.\"\n\n\"That's about it. But speaking of holding hands, would it help if we\npaired again?\"\n\nBelle studied the question for two full minutes; her fine eyes clouded.\n\"No,\" she said, finally. \"I would enjoy it too much, and you'd ... well,\nyou wouldn't....\"\n\n\"Huh?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Oh, physically, of course; but that isn't enough, or good enough, now.\nYou see, I know what your personal code is. It's unbelievable, almost--I\nnever heard of one like it, except maybe a priest or two--but I admire\nyou tremendously for it. You would never, willingly, pair with a woman\nyou really loved. That was why you were so glad to break ours off. You\ncan't deny it.\"\n\n\"I won't try to deny it. But you can't bluff me, Belle, so please quit\ntrying. Basically, your code is the same as mine. Why else did you\ninitiate our break?\"\n\nBelle's block went solid, and Garlock said hastily, aloud, \"Excuse it,\nplease. Cancel. I've just said, and know as an empirical fact, that\nyou've got to do the job alone--but I can't seem to help putting my big,\nflat foot in it by blundering in anyway. Let's get to work, shall we?\"\n\n\"What at? Interview the Primes, I'd say--tell them to hold themselves in\nreadiness to attend....\"\n\n\"On very short notice....\"\n\n\"Yes. To attend the big meeting on Tellus. We'll have to make a\nschedule. It shouldn't be held until after Fao and Deggi get their ship\nbuilt--it _can't_ be held, of course, until after you and Jim are out of\nSSE. Have you got _that_ figured out yet?\"\n\n\"Pretty much.\" He told her his plan.\n\nBelle giggled, then burst into laughter. \"So _I'm_ in it, too?\n_Wonderful!_\"\n\n\"You have to be. If we make him mad enough, he'll fire you, too.\"\n\n\"Without hiring me first? He couldn't.\"\n\n\"He could, very easily. He doesn't know one-tenth of one percent of his\npeople. If we work it right he'll assume that you're one of us\nwage-slaves, too. Lola, too, for that matter.\"\n\n\"Careful, Clee. You and I think this is funny, but Lola wouldn't. She'd\nbe shocked to her sweet little core, and she'd louse up the whole deal.\nSo be very sure she doesn't get in on it.\"\n\n\"I guess you're right ... well, shall we go out and insult our touchy\nyoung friend Semolo? Ready.... Go!\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\n\"Oh, it's _you_ again. I tell you....\" the Lizorian began.\n\n\"You will tell me nothing. You will listen. Link your mind to Mitala's,\"\nand the linked Tellurian minds enforced the order. \"In about two weeks\nthe Primes of many worlds will meet in person on Tellus. Arrange your\naffairs so that on ten minutes' notice you both can leave Lizoria for\nTellus aboard our starship, the _Pleiades_. That is all.\"\n\n\"He'll come, too,\" Belle chortled. \"He'll writhe and scream, but he'll\ncome.\"\n\n\"You couldn't keep him away,\" Garlock agreed.\n\nOn the next planet, Falne, the procedure was a little different. The\ninformation was the same, but--\"One word of warning,\" Garlock added. \"It\nis to be a meeting of minds; not a contest to set up a pecking-order. If\nyou try any such business you will be disciplined; sharply and in\npublic.\"\n\n\"Suppose that, under such conditions, we refuse to attend the meeting?\"\n\n\"That is your right. There is no coercion whatever. Whether or not you\ncome will depend upon whether or not you two are in reality Seekers\nafter Truth. Until a day.\"\n\nAnd so it went. Planet after planet. On not one of those worlds had any\nPrime changed his thinking. Not one was really interested in the\nGalactic Service as an instrument for the good of all mankind. There\nwere almost as many attitudes as there were Primes; but all were\nessentially self-centered and selfish.\n\n\"That tears it, Belle--busts it wide open. I can--I mean we together can\ndo either job. That is, either be top boss and run the thing or put in\nfull time beating some sense into those hard skulls. We can't do both.\"\n\n\"On paper, we should,\" Belle said, thoughtfully. \"You're Galactic\nAdmiral; I'm your Vice. One job apiece. But we're _not_ going to be\nseparated. Besides....\"\n\n\"Two (minds) (brains) are much better than one,\" both said, except for\none word, in unison.\n\nBelle laughed. \"That settles that. The Garlock-Bellamy fusion is\nGalactic Admiral--so we need a good Vice. Who? Deggi and Fao? They're\ncooperative and idealistic enough, but.... Oh, I don't know exactly what\nit is they lack. Do you?\"\n\n\"No; I can't put it into words or thoughts. Probably the concept is too\nnew for pigeon-holing. It isn't exactly strength or hardness or\ntoughness or resilience or brisance--maybe a combination of all five.\nWhat we need is a pair like us but better.\"\n\n\"There _aren't_ any.\"\n\n\"Don't be too sure.\" Belle glanced at him in surprise and he went on:\n\"Not that we've seen, no. But each of those worlds centers a volume of\nspace containing thousands of planets. Including the Tellurian and the\nMargonian, we now have forty-eight regions defined. Let's run a very\nfast search-pattern of Region Forty-nine and see what we come up with.\"\n\n\"All right ... but suppose we do find somebody who out-Gunthers us?\"\n\n\"I'd a lot rather have it that way than the way it is now. I'll do the\nhopping, you the checking. Here's the first one--what do you read?\"\n\n\"N. G.\"\n\n\"And this one?\"\n\n\"The same.\"\n\n\"And this?\"\n\n\"Ditto.\"\n\nUntil, finally: \"Clee, just how long are you going to keep this up?\"\n\n\"Until we find something or run out of time for the meeting. Belle, I\nreally _want_ to find somebody who amounts to something.\"\n\n\"So do I, really, so go ahead.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nBut they did not run out of time. At planet number four-hundred-something,\nBelle suddenly emitted a shriek--vocally as well as mentally. \"Clee!\nHold it! Here's something, I think!\"\n\n\"I'm sure there is, and I'm gladder to see you two people than can\npossibly be expressed.\"\n\nBelle whirled; so did Garlock. A man stood in the middle of the Main; a\nman shaped very much like Garlock, but with long, badly-tousled hair and\na bushy wilderness of fiery-red whiskers.\n\n\"Please excuse this intrusion, Admiral--or should it be plural? Improper\naddress, I'm sure, but your joint tenure is a concept so new and so vast\nthat I am not yet able to grasp it fully--but you are working at such\nhigh speed that I had to do something drastic. You will, I trust, remain\nhere long enough to discuss certain matters with my wife and me?\"\n\n\"We'll be very glad to.\"\n\n\"Thank you. I will return, then, more decorously, and bring her. One\nmoment.\" He disappeared.\n\n\"_Wife!_\" Belle exclaimed, more than half in dismay. \"They must be,\nthen....\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" The thought of a wife did not bother Garlock at all. \"Talk about\n_power!_ And _speed!_ To get all that stuff and 'port up here in the\nmillisecond or so we had the screens open? Baby Doll, there's a guy who\nis what a Prime Operator _ought_ to be!\"\n\nIn less than a minute the man reappeared, accompanied by a woman who was\nvery obviously pregnant--eight months or so. Like the man, she was\ndressed in tight-fitting coveralls. Her hair, however--it was a natural\nred, too--was cut to a uniform length of eight inches, and each hair\nindividually stood out, perfectly straight and perfectly perpendicular\nto the element of the scalp from which it sprang.\n\n\"Friends Belle and Clee of Tellus, I present Therea, my wife; and\nAlsyne, myself; of this planet Thaker. We have numbers, too, but they\nare never used among friends.\"\n\nAcknowledgments were made and a few minutes of conversation ensued,\nduring which the two couples studied each other.\n\n\"This looks mighty good to me,\" Garlock said then. \"Shall we go screens\nhalf-down, Alsyne, and cry in each other's beer?\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nIn thirty seconds of flashing communication each became thoroughly\ninformed. Those minds could send, and could receive, an incredibly vast\namount of information in an incredibly brief space of time.\n\n\"Your ship should work and doesn't,\" Garlock said. \"Show me; in detail.\"\n\nAlsyne showed him.\n\n\"Oh, I see. You didn't work out quite all the theory. It has to be\nactivated. Like this....\" Garlock showed Alsyne.\n\n\"I see. Thanks.\" Alsyne disappeared and was gone for some ten minutes.\nHe reappeared, grinning hugely behind his flaming wilderness of beard.\n\"It works perfectly; for which our heartfelt thanks. And now that my\nmind is at complete peace with the universe, we will consider the\nutterly fascinating subject of your proposed Galactic Service. You two\nTellurians, immature although you are, have made two tremendous\ncontributions to the advancement of the Scheme of Things--three, if you\ncount the starship, which is comparatively unimportant--each of such\nimport that no human mind can foresee any fraction of its consequences.\nFirst, your Prime Field, the probe and its screen....\"\n\n\"Clee!\" Belle drove the thought. \"You _didn't_ give him _that_, surely!\"\n\n\"Tut-tut, my child,\" Therea soothed her. \"You are alarming yourself\nabout nothing.\"\n\n\"The only trouble with you two youngsters is that you aren't quite--very\nnearly, of course, but very definitely not quite--grown up.\" Alsyne\nsmiled again; not only with mouth and eyes, but with his whole hairy\nface. \"To the mature mind there is no such thing as status. Each knows\nwhat he can do best and does it as a matter of course. Rank is not\nnecessary.\n\n\"Second, the unimaginably important contribution of the ability to\ncombine two dissimilar but intimately compatible minds into one\ntremendously effective fusion. While Therea and I have had only a few\nmoments to play with it, we realize some of its possibilities. Thus,\nsince she is a Doctor of Humanities....\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Belle interrupted. \"_That's_ why you knew what I was thinking\nabout, even though I tight-beamed the thought and my screens were\ntight?\"\n\n\"Exactly so. But to continue. With her sympathy and empathy, and my\ndriving force and so on, the job of licking these young Primes into\nshape is, as your idiom has it, 'strictly our dish.' It is a truly\ndelicious thought.\n\n\"You two, on the other hand, have much that we lack. Breadth and depth\nand scope of imagination and of vision; yet almost incredible will-power\nand stamina and resolve....\"\n\n\"_That's the word I was trying to think of--will-power_,\" Belle flashed\na thought at Garlock.\n\n\"... qualities virtually always mutually exclusive; but the combination\nof which makes your fusion uniquely qualified to lead and direct this\nnew and magnificent movement. But Therea and I have been idle and\nfrustrated far too long. We can be of most use, at the moment, on\nMargonia; working with the Fao-Deggi unit. Therefore, with renewed deep\nthanks, we go.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nMan and wife disappeared; and, ten seconds later, the Thakern starship\nvanished from its world.\n\n\"Well, _what_ do you think of _that_?\" Belle gasped. \"I was actually\nafraid to think, even behind a Prime screen. I don't know _yet_ whether\nI want to kiss 'em or kill 'em.\"\n\n\"I do. That guy is really a Prime, Belle. He's older, bigger, and a lot\nbetter than I am.\"\n\n\"Uh-uh,\" she demurred, positively. \"Older, yes. More mature--you _baby_,\nyou!\" She snickered gleefully. \"If he hadn't included you in that crack\nI'd've stabbed him, so help me, even though it wasn't true. He said\nhimself it's _you_ who has got what it takes to lead and direct, not\nhim.\"\n\n\"Us. We, I mean,\" he corrected, absently.\n\n\"Uh-huh; us-we. One, now and forever. Hot Dog! Anyway, he wants us to\nand we want to so everything's lovely and so let's get to work on Fatso\nand his Foster. I think we ought to have some fun for a change and\nthat'll be a lot. When do we want to hit him?\"\n\n\"Any day Monday through Friday. Nine-fifteen A.M. Eastern Daylight time.\nPlus or minus one minute.\"\n\n\"Nice! Catch him _in flagrante delicto_. Lovely--shovel on the coal, my\nintrepid engineer!\"\n\nOn a Wednesday morning, then, at twelve minutes past nine EDT, the\n_Pleiades_ hung poised, high over the Chancellery of Solar System\nEnterprises, Incorporated.\n\n\"Remember, Belle!\" Garlock was pacing the Main. \"To keep 'em staggering\nwe'll have to land slugging and beat 'em to every punch. You did a\nwonderful job on her last time, and it's been eating on her ever since.\nShe's probably been rehearsing in front of a mirror just how she's going\nto tear you apart next time and just how she's going to spit out the\npieces. Last time, you were cold, stiff, rigidly formal, and polite. So\nthis time it'll be me, and I'll be hot and bothered, dirty, low, coarse,\nlewd, and very, very rough.\"\n\nBelle threw back her head and laughed. \"Rough? Yes. Vicious,\ncontemptuous, or ugly; yes. A master of fluent, biting, and pyrotechnic\nprofanity; yes. But low or dirty or coarse or lewd, Clee? Or any one of\nthe four, to say nothing of them all? Uh-uh. Ferber's a filthy beast, of\ncourse; but even he knows you're one of the cleanest men that ever\nlived. They'd _know_ it was an act.\"\n\n\"Not unless I give 'em time to think--or unless you do, before he fires\nJim--in which case we'll lose the game anyway. But how about you? If I\ncan knock 'em too groggy to think, will you carry on and keep 'em that\nway?\"\n\n\"Watch my blasts!\" Belle giggled gleefully. \"I never tried anything like\nthat--any more than you have--but I'll guarantee to be just as low,\ndirty, coarse, lewd, and crude as you are. Probably more so, because in\nthis particular case it'll be fun. You see, you're a man--you can't\npossibly despise and detest that slimy stinker either in the same way or\nas much as I do.\"\n\n\"This ought to be good. Cut the rope, Jim.\"\n\nEven before the starship came to rest, Garlock drove a probe into the\n_sanctum sanctorum_ of the Chancellery--an utterly unheard-of act of\ninsolence.\n\n\"Foster! This is the _Pleiades_ coming in. Garlock calling. Hot up the\ntri-di and the recorder, Toots. Put Fatso on, and snap into it.... I\nsaid shake a leg!\"\n\n\"Why, I.... You....\"\n\n\"Stop stuttering and come to life, you half-witted bag! Gimme Ferber and\nhurry it up--this ship's tricky.\"\n\n\"Why, you ... I never....\" Ferber's outraged First Secretary could\nscarcely talk. \"He ... he is....\"\n\n\"I know, Babe, I know--I could set that to music and sing it, with\ngestures. 'Chancellor Ferber is in conference and cannot be disturbed,'\"\nhe mimicked, savagely. \"Put him on now--but _quick_!\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nThe tri-di tank brightened up; Chancellor Ferber's image appeared. He\nwas disheveled, surprised and angry, but Garlock gave him no chance to\nspeak.\n\n\"Well, Fatso--at last! Where the _hell_ have you been all morning? I\nwant some stuff, just as fast as God will let you get it together,\" and\nhe began to read off, as fast as he could talk, a long list of highly\ntechnical items.\n\nFerber tried for many seconds to break in, and Garlock finally allowed\nhim to do so.\n\n\"Are you crazy, Garlock?\" he shouted. \"What in hell's name are you\nbothering _me_ with _that_ stuff for? You know better than that--make\nout your requisitions and send them through channels!\"\n\n\"Channels, hell!\" Garlock shouted back. \"Hasn't it got through your\nfour-inch-thick skull into your idiot's brain yet that I'm in a hurry? I\ndon't want this stuff today; I want it day before yesterday--this damned\njunk-heap is apt to fall apart any minute. So quit goggling and\nslobbering at me, you wall-eyed, slimy, fat toad. Get that three hundred\nweight of suet into action. _Hump_ yourself!\"\n\n\"You ... you ... Why, I was never so insulted....\"\n\n\"Insulted? You?\" Garlock out-roared him. \"Listen, Fatso. If I ever set\nout to really insult you, you'll know it--it'll blister all the paint\noff the walls. All I'm trying to do now is get you off that fat butt of\nyours and get some action.\"\n\nFerber became purple and pounded his desk in consuming anger.\n\nGarlock yelled louder and pounded harder. \"Start rounding up this\nstuff--but _fast_--or I'll come down there and take your job away from\nyou and do it myself--and for your own greasy hide's sake you'd better\nbelieve I'm not just chomping my choppers, either.\"\n\n\"You'll _What?_\" Ferber screamed. \"_You're fired!_\"\n\n\"_You_ fire _me_?\" Garlock mimicked the scream. \"And make it stick?\nYou'd better write that one up for the funnies. Why, you lard-brain, you\ncouldn't fire a cap-pistol.\"\n\n\"Foster!\" Ferber yelled. \"Terminate Garlock as of now. Insubordination,\nand misconduct, abuse of position, incompetence, malfeasance--everything\nelse you can think of. Blacklist him all over the System!\"\n\nAt the word \"fired\" Belle, had leaped to her feet and had stopped\nlaughing.\n\n\"Miss Bellamy!\" Ferber snapped.\n\n\"Yes, sir?\" she answered, sweetly.\n\n\"You are hereby promoted to be Head of the....\"\n\n\"Oh, yeah?\" Belle sneered, her voice cutting like a knife. \"You\nunprincipled, lascivious, lecherous _Hitler!_ Have you got the\nunmitigated gall to take _me_ for a floozie? To think you can add _me_\nto your collection of bootlicking, round-heeled tramps?\"\n\n\"You're fired and blacklisted too!\"\n\n\"How nice! You know, I don't know of _anything_ I'd rather have happen\nto me?\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\n\"Get James on there--you, James....\"\n\n\"You don't need to fire me, you fat-headed old goat,\" James said,\ncontemptuously. \"I've already quit--the exact second you fired Clee.\"\n\n\"No you didn't!\" Ferber screamed. \"Resignation not accepted. You're\n_Fired_! Dishonorably discharged--blacklisted everywhere--you'll _never_\nget another job--_anywhere_! And here's your slip, too!\" Miss Foster was\nvery fast on the machines.\n\nJames 'ported his slip up into the _Pleiades_, just as Garlock and Belle\nhad done with theirs, and disappeared with it as they had; reappearing\nalmost instantly.\n\n\"Montandon!\"\n\n\"Chancellor Ferber, are you completely out of your mind? You can't\ndischarge either Miss Bellamy or me.\"\n\n\"I can't?\" he gloated. \"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because neither of us is employed. By anybody.\"\n\n\"That's right, Fatso,\" Belle said. \"We just came along. Just to keep the\nboys company. It's lonesome, you know, 'way out in deep space.\"\n\nMiss Foster ripped a half-filled-out termination form out of her machine\nand hurled it into a waste-basket. Ferber's jaw dropped and his eyes\nstared glassily, but he rallied quickly.\n\n\"I can blacklist her, though, and maybe you think I won't. Belle Bellamy\nwill never get another job in this whole solar system as long as she\nlives, except through me! Maybe I'll hire her some day, for something,\nand maybe I won't. Are you listening, Bellamy?\"\n\n\"Not only listening, I'm reveling in every word.\" Belle laughed\nderisively. \"I hate to shatter such wonderful dreams--or do I? You see,\nthe _Pleiades_ really works, and the Galaxians own her; lock, stock, and\nbarrel. You wouldn't have any part of her, remember? Insisted on payment\nfor every nut, wire, and service? Now, they want to hire us four for a\nbig operation with this starship. Since you only loaned Garlock and\nJames to them, you might have made some legal trouble on that score, but\nnow that you've fired them both--and in such _conclusive_\nlanguage!--we're all set. So when you blacklist us with the Society,\n_please_ let me know--I want to take a tri-di in technicolor of you\ndoing it. How do you like _them_ parsnips, Your Royal Fatness?\"\n\n\"I'll see about that!\" Ferber stormed. \"We'll have an injunction out in\nan hour!\"\n\n\"Go ahead,\" Garlock said, with a wide grin. \"Have fun--the Galaxians\nhave legal eagles too, you know. One thing Belle forgot. Just in case\nyou recover consciousness some time and want to steal our termination\npapers back--especially Belle's; what a howler _that_ was!--don't try\nit. They're in a Gunther-blocked safe.\"\n\nThen, as comprehension began to dawn on Ferber's face:\n\n\"S-u-c-k-e-r,\" Garlock drawled.\n\nThe _Pleiades_ disappeared.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 9\n\n\nThe _Pleiades_ landed on Margonia's Galaxian Field, where the Tellurians\nfound the project running smoothly, a little ahead of schedule. Delcamp\nand Fao were working at their fast and efficient pace, but the hairy\npair from Thaker seemed to be, literally, everywhere at once.\n\n\"Hi, Belle.\" Fao 'ported up and shook hands warmly. \"I thought I was\ngoing to have the first double-Prime baby, until _she_ appeared on the\nscene.\"\n\n\"Didn't it make you mad? I'd've been furious.\"\n\n\"Maybe a little at first, but not after I'd talked with her for half a\nminute. She'd never even thought of that angle. Besides, she thinks the\nwhole galaxy is fairly crawling with double-Primes.\"\n\n\"That's funny--so does Clee. But there are other things--strictly not\nangles--that she hasn't thought of, too. If those coveralls were half an\ninch tighter they'd choke her to death. You'd think she'd....\"\n\n\"Huh?\" Fao interrupted. \"_You_ should scream--oh, that ridiculous\nTellurian prud....\"\n\n\"It _isn't_ ridiculous!\" Belle snapped. \"And it isn't prudishness,\neither--not with me, anyway. It's just that,\" she ran an indicative\nglance over Fao's lean, trim flanks and hard, flat abdomen, \"it spoils\nyour figure. It's only temporary, of course, but....\"\n\n\"_Spoils_ it! Why, how _utterly_ idiotic! Why, it's magnificent! Just as\nsoon as it starts to show on me, Belle, I'm going to start wearing only\nhalf as many clothes as I've got on now.\"\n\n\"You couldn't.\" Belle eyed the other girl's bathing-suit-like garment.\nExcept for being blue instead of yellow, it was the same as the one she\nhad worn before. \"Not without the League for Public Decency sending the\nwagon out after you.\"\n\n\"Oh, Miss Experience? Well, three-quarters, maybe....\"\n\n\"Hey, you two!\" came Delcamp's hail. \"How about cutting the gab and\ngetting some work done?\"\n\n\"Coming, boss! 'Scuse it, please!\" and two fast and skillful women went\nefficiently to work.\n\n        *           *           *\n\nWith six Prime Operators on the job the work went on very rapidly, yet\nwithout error. The _Celestial Queen_ was finished, tested, and found\nperfect, one full day ahead of James' most optimistic estimate for\nconstruction alone. The six Primes conferred.\n\n\"Do you want us to help you pick up the other Primes?\" Delcamp asked.\n\"Your Main, big as it is, will be crowded, and we have three ships here\nnow instead of one.\"\n\n\"I don't think so ... no,\" Garlock decided. \"We told 'em we'd do it, and\nin the _Pleiades_, so we'd better. Unless, Alsyne, you don't agree?\"\n\n\"I agree. The point, while of course minor, is very well taken. We and\nour Operators--we brought six along; experts in their various\nfields--can serve best by working on Tellus with its Galaxian Society in\ngetting ready for the meeting.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course,\" Fao said. \"Probably Deg and I should do the same\nthing?\"\n\n\"That would be our thought.\" The two Thakerns were thinking--and\nlepping--in fusion. \"However,\" they went on carefully, \"it must not be\nand is not our intent to sway you in any action or decision. While not\nall of you four, perhaps, are as yet fully mature, not one of you should\nbe subjected to any additional exterior stresses.\"\n\n\"I hope you don't think that way about _all_ Primes,\" Garlock said,\ngrimly. \"I'm going to smack some of those kids down so hard that their\nshirt-tails will roll up their backs like window shades.\"\n\n\"If you find such action either necessary or desirable, we will join you\nquite happily in it. We go.\"\n\nThe four remaining Primes looked at each other in puzzled surprise.\n\n\"_What_ do you think about _that_?\" Garlock asked finally, of no one in\nparticular.\n\n\"I don't understand them,\" Fao said, \"but they're mighty nice people.\"\n\n\"Do you suppose, Clee,\" Belle nibbled at her lower lip, \"that we're\ngetting off on the wrong foot with uniforms and admirals and things?\nThat with really adult Primes running things the Galactic Service would\nrun itself? No bosses or anything?\"\n\n\"Umnngk.\" Garlock grunted as though Belle had slugged him. \"I hope not.\nOr do I? Anyway, not enough data yet to make speculation profitable. But\nI wonder, Miss Bellamy, if it would be considered an unjustifiable\nattempt to sway you in any action or decision if I were to suggest--Oh,\never so diffidently!--that if we're going to saddle up our bronks and\nride out on roundup tomorrow morning we ought to be logging some\nsack-time right now?\"\n\n\"Considering the source, as well as and/or in connection with the\nadmittedly extreme provocation,\" Belle straightened up into a regal\npose, \"You may say, Mister Garlock, without fear of successful\ncontradiction, that in this instance no umbrage will be taken, at least\nfor the moment.\" She broke the pose and giggled infectiously. \"'Night,\nyou two lovely people!\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nBelle was still sunny and gay when the _Pleiades_ reached Lizoria;\nGarlock was inwardly happy and outwardly content. Semolo, however, was\nhis usual intransigent self. In fact, if it had not been for Mirea\nMitala, and the fact that she--metaphorically--did pin Semolo's ears\nback, Garlock would not have taken him aboard at all.\n\nThus, after loading on only one pair of Primes, that\nauspiciously-beginning day had lost some of its luster; and as the day\nwore on it got no better fast. Baver of Falne had not learned anything,\neither--only Garlock's intervention saved the cocky and obstreperous\nSemolo from a mental blast that would have knocked him out cold.\n\nThen there were Onthave and Lerthe of Crenna; Korl and Kirl of Gleer;\nParleof and Ginseona of Pasquerone; Atnim and Sotara of Flandoon, and\neighty others. Very few of them were as bad as Semolo; some of them,\nparticularly the Pasqueronians and the Gleerans, were almost as good as\nDelcamp and Fao.\n\nThis was the first time that any pair of them had ever come physically\nclose to any other Prime. Many of them had not really believed that any\nPrimes abler than themselves existed. The _Pleiades_ was crowded, and\nGarlock and Belle were not giving to any of them the deference and\nconsideration and submissive respect which each considered his unique\ndue.\n\nWherefore the undertaking was neither easy nor pleasant; and both\nTellurians were tremendously relieved when, the last pair picked up,\nthey flashed the starship back to Tellus and Delcamp, Fao, and the\nThakerns 'ported themselves aboard.\n\n\"Give me your attention, please,\" Garlock said, crisply. Then, after a\nmoment, \"Any and all who are not tuned to me in five seconds will be\nreturned immediately to their home planets and will lose all contact\nwith this group....\n\n\"That's better. For some of you this has been a very long day. For all\nof you it has been a very trying day. You were all informed previously\nas to what we had in mind. However, since you are young and callow, and\nwere thoroughly convinced of your own omniscience and omnipotence, it is\nnatural enough that you derived little or no benefit from that\ninformation. You are now facing reality, not your own fantasies.\n\n\"Each pair of you has been assigned a suite of rooms in Galaxian Hall.\nEach suite is furnished appropriately; each is fully Gunthered for\nself-service.\n\n\"This meeting has not been announced to the public and, at least for the\npresent, will not be. Therefore none of you will attempt to communicate\nwith anyone outside Galaxian Hall. Anyone making any such attempt will\nbe surprised.\n\n\"The meeting will open at eight o'clock tomorrow morning in the\nauditorium. The Thakerns and the Margonians will now inform you as to\nyour quarters.\" There was a moment of flashing thought. \"Dismissed.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nAt one second before eight o'clock the auditorium was empty. At eight\no'clock, ninety-eight human beings appeared in it; six on the stage, the\nrest occupying the first few rows of seats.\n\n\"Good morning, everybody,\" Garlock said, pleasantly. \"Everyone being\nrested, fed, and having had some time in which to consider the changed\nreality faced by us all, I hope and am inclined to believe that we can\nattain friendship and accord. We will spend the next hour in becoming\nacquainted with each other. We will walk around, not teleport. We will\nmeet each other physically, as well as mentally. We will learn each\nother's forms of greeting and we will use them. This meeting is\nadjourned until nine o'clock--or, rather, the meeting will begin then.\"\n\nFor several minutes no one moved. All blocks were locked at maximum.\nEach Prime used only his eyes.\n\nPhysically, it was a scene of almost overpowering perfection. The men\nwere, without exception, handsome, strong, and magnificently male. The\nwomen, from heroically-framed Fao Talaho up--or down?--to surprisingly\nslender Mirea Mitala, all were arrestingly beautiful; breathtakingly\nproportioned; spectacularly female.\n\nClothing varied from complete absence to almost complete coverage, with\na bewildering variety of intermediate conditions. Color was rampant.\n\n        *           *           *\n\nHair--or lack of it--was also an individual and highly variant matter.\nSome of the women, like Belle and Fao, were content with one solid but\nunnatural shade. One shaven head--Mirea Mitala's--was deeply tanned, but\nunadorned, even though the rest of her body was almost covered by\nprecious stones. Another was decorated with geometrical and esoteric\ndesigns in eye-searing colors. A third supported a structure--it could\nnot possibly be called a hat--of spun metal and gems.\n\nAmong the medium-and long-hairs there were two-, three-, and multi-toned\njobs galore. Some of the color-combinations were harmonious; some were\nsharply contrasting, such as black and white; some looked as though\ntheir wearers had used the most violently-clashing colors they could\nfind.\n\nThe prize-winner, however, was Therea of Thaker's enormous, inexplicable\nmop; and it was that phenomenon that first broke the ice.\n\nThe girl with the decorated scalp had been glancing questioningly at\nneighbor after neighbor, only to be met by uncompromising stares.\nFinally, however, her gaze met another, as interested as her own. This\nsecond girl, whose coiffure was a high-piled confection of black, white,\nyellow, red, blue, and green, half-masted her screen and said:\n\n\"Oh, thanks, Jethay of Lodie-Yann. I'm glad everybody isn't going to\nstay locked up all day. I'm Ginseona of Pasquerone. They call me 'Jin'\nwhenever they want to call me anything printable. And _this_,\" she dug a\nknuckle into her companion's short ribs, whereupon he jumped, whirled\naround, lowered his screen, and grinned, \"is my ... the boy friend,\nParleof. Also of Pasquerone, of course. Par, both Jethay and I....\"\n\n\"Call me 'Jet'--everybody does,\" Jethay said: almost shyly, for a Prime.\n\n\"Both Jet and I have been wondering about that woman's hair--over there.\nHow could you _possibly_ give a head of hair a static charge of fifty or\na hundred kilovolts and not have it leak off?\"\n\n\"You couldn't, unless it was a perfectly-insulated wig ... but it looks\nas though she did, at that....\" and Parleof paused in thought.\n\n\"Maybe Byuk would have an idea or two,\" and Jet uttered aloud a dozen or\nso crackling syllables that sounded as though they could have been\nladylike profanity. Whatever they were, Byuk jumped, too, and tuned in\nwith the other three.\n\n\"Oh, it's quite easy, really,\" Therea said then. \"Look.\" Her mass of\nhair cascaded gracefully down around her neck and shoulders. \"Look\nagain.\" Each hair stood fiercely out all by itself, exactly as before.\n\"All you young people will learn much more difficult and much more\nimportant things before this meeting is over. I cannot tell you how glad\nI am that so many of you are here.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nAnd so it went, all over the auditorium. Once cracked, the ice broke up\nfast.\n\nFao and Delcamp worked hard; so did Belle and Garlock. Alsyne was a\npotent force indeed--his abounding vitality and his tremendous smile\nbroke down barriers that logic could not affect. And Therea worked\nnear-miracles; did more than the other five combined. Her sympathy, her\nempathy, her understanding and feeling, were as great as Lola's own; her\noperative ability was as much greater than Lola's as Lola's was greater\nthan that of a bobby-soxed babysitter.\n\nThus, when half of the hour was gone, Garlock heaved a profound sigh of\nrelief. He wouldn't have half the trouble he had expected--it was not\ngoing to be a riot. And when he called the meeting to order he was\npleasanter and friendlier than Belle had ever before seen him.\n\n\"While I am calling this meeting to order, it is only in the widest\npossible sense that I am its presiding officer, for we have as yet no\norganization by the delegated authority of which any man or any woman\nhas any right to preside. Yesterday I ruled by force; simply because I\nam stronger than any one of you or any pair of you. Today, in the light\nof the developments of the last hour, that rule is done; except,\nperhaps, for one or two isolated and non-representative cases which may\ndevelop today. By this time tomorrow, I hope that we will be forever\ndone with the law of claw and fang. For, as a much abler man has\nsaid--'To the really mature mind, the concept of status is completely\ninvalid.'\"\n\n\"_He's putting that as a direct quote, Alsyne, and it isn't._\" Belle\nlanced the thought.\n\n\"_He thinks it is_,\" Alsyne flashed back. \"_That is the way his\nmathematician's mind recorded it._\"\n\n\"This meeting is informal, preliminary and exploratory. A meeting of\nminds from which, we hope, a useful and workable organization can be\ndeveloped. Since you all know what we think it basically should be,\nthere is no need to repeat it.\n\n\"I must now say something that a few of you will construe as a threat.\nYou are all Prime Operators. Each pair of you is the highest development\nof a planet, perhaps of a solar system. You can learn if you will. You\ncan cooperate if you will. Any couple here who refuses to learn, and\nhence to cooperate, will be returned to its native planet and will have\nno further contact with this group.\n\n\"I now turn this meeting over to our first moderators, Alsyne and Therea\nof Thaker; the oldest and ablest Prime Operators of us all.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Garlock of Tellus. One correction, however, if you please. I\nwho speak am neither this man nor this woman standing here, but both. I\nam the Prime Unit of Thaker. For brevity, and for the purposes of this\nmeeting only, I could be called simply 'Thaker.' Before calling for\ngeneral discussion I wish to call particular attention to two points,\nneither of which has been sufficiently emphasized.\n\n\"First, the purpose of a Prime Operator is to serve, not to rule. Thus,\nno Prime should be or will be 'boss' of anything, except possibly of his\nown starship.\n\n\"Second, since we have no data we do not know what form the proposed\nGalactic Service will assume. One thing, however, is sure. Whatever\npower of enforcement or of punishment it may have will derive, not from\nits Primes, but from the fact that it will be an arm of the Galactic\nCouncil, which will be composed of Operators only. No Prime will be\neligible for membership.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nThaker went on to explain how each pair could obtain instruction and\nassistance in many projects, including starships. How each pair would,\nwhen they were mature enough, be coached in the use of certain abilities\nthey did not as yet have. He suggested procedures and techniques to be\nemployed in the opening up of each pair's volume of space. He then asked\nfor questions and comments.\n\nSemolo was the first. \"If I'm a good little boy,\" he sneered, \"and do\nexactly as I'm told, and take over the region you tell me to and not the\none I want to, what assurance have I that some other Prime, just because\nhe's a year older than I am, won't come along and take it away from me?\"\n\n\"Your question is meaningless,\" Thaker replied. \"Since you will not\n'take over,' or 'have,' or 'own,' any region, it cannot be 'taken away\nfrom you.'\"\n\n\"Then I will....\" Semolo began.\n\n\"You will keep still!\" came a clear, incisive thought, just as Garlock\nwas getting ready to intervene. Miss Mitala then switched from thought,\nwhich everyone there could understand, and launched a ten-second blast\nof furious speech. Semolo wilted and the girl went on in thought: \"He'll\nbe good--or else.\"\n\nA girl demanded recognition and got it. \"Semolo's right. What's the use\nof being Primes if we can't get any good out of it? We're the strongest\npeople of our respective worlds. I say we're bosses and should keep on\nbeing bosses.\"\n\nGarlock got ready to shut her up, then paused; holding his fire.\n\n\"Ah, yes, friend Garlock, you are maturing fast,\" came Thaker's thought\nand, in answer to Garlock's surprise, it went on, \"This situation will,\nI think, be self-adjusting; just as will be those in the as yet\nunexplored regions of space.\"\n\nThe girl kept on. \"I, at least, am going to keep on bossing my own\nplanet, milking it just as I....\"\n\nHer companion had been trying to crack her shield. Failing in that, he\nstepped in close and tapped her--solidly, but with carefully-measured\nforce--behind the ear. Before she could fall, he 'ported her back up\ninto their quarters. \"This happens all the time,\" he explained to the\ngroup at large. \"Carry on.\"\n\nDiscussion went on, with less and less acrimony, all the rest of the\nday. And the next day, and the next. Then, argument having reached the\npoint of diminishing returns, the three starships took the forty-six\ncouples home.\n\n        *           *           *\n\nThe six Primes went into Evans' office, where the lawyer was deeply\nengaged with Gerald Banks, the Galaxians' Public Relations Chief. Banks\nwas holding his head in both hands.\n\n\"Garlock, maybe _you_ can tell me,\" Banks demanded. \"How much of this\nstuff, if any, can I publish? And if so, _how_?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" Garlock said, flatly.\n\n\"What do you think, Thaker?\" Belle asked. \"You're smarter than we are.\"\n\n\"What Thaker thinks has no bearing,\" Garlock said.\n\nBelle, Fao, and Delcamp all began to protest at once, but they were\nsilenced by Thaker himself.\n\n\"Garlock is right. My people are not your people; I know not at all how\nyour people think or what they will or will not believe. I go.\"\n\n\"That lets Deg and me out too; then, double-plus,\" Fao said with a grin,\n\"so we'll leave that baby on your laps. We go, too.\"\n\n\"Well, little Miss Weisenheimer,\" Garlock smiled quizzically at Belle,\n\"You grabbed the ball--what are you going to do with it?\"\n\n\"Nothing, I guess....\" Belle thought for a minute. \"We couldn't stuff\nany part of that down the throat of a simple-minded six-year-old. We\nhaven't really _got_ anything, anyway. Time enough, I think, when we\nhave six or seven hundred planets in each region, instead of only one\nplanet. Maybe we'll know something by then. Does that make sense?\"\n\n\"It does to me,\" Garlock said, and the others agreed.\n\n\"That Thakern 'we go' business sounds rough at first, but it's\ncontagious. Fao and Deggi caught it, and I feel like I'm coming down\nwith it myself. How about you, Clee?\"\n\n\"We go,\" Belle and Garlock said in unison, and vanished.\n\n        *           *           *\n\nAboard the _Pleiades_, the next few days passed quietly enough. James\nset up, in the starship's memory banks, a sequence to mass-produce\ninstruction tapes and blueprints. Garlock and Belle began systematically\nto explore the Tellurian Region. Now, however, their technique was\ndifferent. If either Prime of any world was not enthusiastic about the\nproject--\n\n\"Very well. Think it over,\" they would say. \"We will get in touch with\nyou again in about a year,\" and the starship would go on to the next\nplanet.\n\nOn Earth, however, things became less and less tranquil with every day\nthat passed. For, in deciding not to publish anything, Garlock had not\nconsidered at all the basic function and the tremendous ability, power,\nand scope of _The Press_. And Galaxian Hall had never before been closed\nto the public; not for any hour of any day of any year of its existence.\nA non-profit organization, dependent upon the public for its tremendous\nincome, the Galaxian Society had always courted that public in every\npossible ethical way.\n\nThus, in the first hour of closure, a bored reporter came out, read the\nsmoothly-phrased notice, and lepped it in to the desk. It might be\nworth, he thought, half an inch.\n\nLater in the day, however, the world's most sensitive news-nose began to\nitch. Did, or did not, this quiet, unannounced closing smell\never-so-slightly of cheese? Wherefore, Benjamin Bundy, the newscaster\nwho had covered the starship's maiden flight, went out himself to look\nthe thing over. He found the whole field closed. Not only closed, but\nGunther-blocked impenetrably tight. He studied the announcement, his\nsixth sense--the born newsman's sense for news--probing every word.\n\n\"Regret ... research ... of such extreme delicacy ... vibration ...\ntemperature control ... one one-hundredth of one degree Centigrade....\"\n\nHe sought out his long-time acquaintance Banks; finding him in a\ntemporary office half a block away from the Hall. \"What's the story,\nJerry?\" he asked. \"The _real_ story, I mean?\"\n\n\"You know, as much about it as I do, Ben. Garlock and James don't waste\ntime trying to detail me on that kind of business, you know.\"\n\nThis should have satisfied any newshawk, but Bundy's nose still itched.\nHe mulled things over for a minute, then probed, finding that he could\nread nothing except Banks' outermost, most superficial thoughts.\n\n\"Well ... maybe ... but....\" Then Bundy plunged. \"All you have to do,\nJerry, is tell me screens-half-down that your damn story is true.\"\n\n\"And that's the one thing I can't do,\" Banks admitted; and Bundy could\nnot detect that any part of his sheepishness was feigned. \"You're just\ntoo damned smart, Ben.\"\n\n\"Oh--one of _those_ things? So that's it?\"\n\n\"Yup. I told Evans it might not work.\"\n\nThat should have satisfied the reporter, but it didn't. \"Now it doesn't\nsmell just a trifle cheesy; it stinks like rotten fish. You won't go\nscreens down on that one, either.\"\n\n\"No comment.\"\n\n\"Oh, joy!\" Bundy exulted. \"So big that Gerald Banks, the top press-agent\nof all time, actually doesn't _want_ publicity! The starship works--this\nlack-of-control stuff is the bunk--from here to another star in nothing\nflat--Garlock's back, and he's brought--what _have_ you got in there,\nJerry?\"\n\n\"The only way I can tell you is in confidence, for Evans' release. I'd\nlike to, Ben, believe me, but I can't.\"\n\n\"Confidence, hell! Do you think we won't get it?\"\n\n\"In that case, no comment.\" The interview ended and the siege began.\n\n        *           *           *\n\nNewshounds and detectives questioned and peered and probed. They dug\ninto morgues, tabulating and classifying. They recalled and taped and\nsifted all the gossip they had heard. They got a picture of sorts, but\nit was maddeningly confusing and incomplete. And, since it was certain\nthat inter-systemic matters were involved, they could not\nextrapolate--any guess was far too apt to be wrong. Thus nothing went on\nthe air or appeared in print; and, although the surface remained calm,\nall newsdom seethed to its depths.\n\nWherefore haggard Banks and harried Evans greeted Garlock with shouts of\njoy when the four wanderers came back to spend the week end on Earth.\n\n\"I'll talk to 'em,\" Garlock decided, after the long story had been told.\n\"Have somebody get hold of Bundy and ask him to come out.\"\n\n\"Get _hold_ of him!\" Banks snorted. \"He's here. Twenty-four hours a day.\nEating sandwiches and cat-napping on chairs in the lobby. All you have\nto do is unseal that door.\"\n\nGarlock flung the door wide. Bundy rushed in, followed by a more-or-less\nsteady stream of some fifty other top-bracket newspeople, both men and\nwomen.\n\n\"Well, Garlock, perhaps _you_ will give us some screens-down facts?\"\nBundy asked, angrily.\n\n\"I'll give you _all_ the screens-down....\"\n\n\"Clee!\" \"You're crazy!\" \"You can't!\" \"Don't!\" Belle and all the\nOperators protested at once.\n\n        *           *           *\n\nIgnoring the objections, Garlock cut his shield to half and gave the\nwhole group a true account of everything that had happened in the\ngalaxy. Then, while they were all too stunned to speak, a grin of\nsaturnine amusement spread over his dark, five-o'clock-shadowed face.\n\n\"You pestiferous gnats insisted on grabbing the ball,\" he sneered. \"Now\nlet's see you run with it.\"\n\nBundy came out of his trance. \"_What_ a story!\" he yelled. \"We'll\nplaster it....\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Garlock said, dryly. \"_What_ a story. Exactly.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" Bundy deflated suddenly. \"You'll have to prove it--demonstrate\nit--of course.\"\n\n\"Of course? You tickle me. Not only do I not have to prove it, I won't.\nI won't even confirm it.\"\n\nBundy glared at Garlock, then whirled on Banks. \"If you don't give me\nthis in shape to use, you'll never get another line or mention\nanywhere!\"\n\n\"Oh, no?\" For the first time in his professional life Banks gloated,\nopenly and avidly. \"From now on, my friend, who is in the saddle? Who is\ngoing to come to whom? Oh, _brother_!\"\n\nWhen the fuming newsmen had gone, Garlock said, \"It'll leak, of course.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Banks agreed. \"'It is rumored ...' 'from a usually reliable\nsource ...' and so on. Nothing definite, but each one of them will want\nto put out the first and biggest.\"\n\n\"That's what I figured. It'll have to break sometime and I thought\neasing it out would be best ... but wait a minute....\" he thought for\ntwo solid minutes. \"But we're going to need a lot of money, and we're\njust about broke, aren't we?\" This thought was addressed to Frank Macey,\nthe Galaxians' treasurer.\n\n\"Worse than broke--much worse.\"\n\n\"I could loan you a couple of credits, Frank,\" Belle said, brightly.\n\"But go ahead, Clee.\"\n\n\"People like to be sidewalk superintendents. Suppose they could watch\nthe construction of an outpost so far away that nobody ever dreamed of\never getting there. Could you do anything with that, Jerry?\"\n\n\"_Could I! Just!_\" and Banks, went into a rhapsody.\n\n\"That's the first good idea any one of you crackpots has had for five\nyears,\" Macey said, suddenly. \"But wouldn't transportation of material\nand so on present problems?\"\n\n\"No; just buying it,\" Garlock said, soberly. \"Oh, rather, paying for\nit.\"\n\n\"No trouble there....\"\n\n\"What?\" Belle exclaimed. \"'No trouble,' it says here in fine print? How\nthe old skinflint has changed--instead of screaming his head off about\nspending money he's actually _offering_ to. Frank, I'll loan you _three_\ncredits!\"\n\n\"Hush, honey-chile, the men-folks are talking man-business. Look, Clee.\nWe'll use the _Pleiades_ at first, while we're building a regular\ntransport. A hundred passengers per trip, one thousand credits one\nway....\"\n\n\"Wow!\" Belle put in. \"Our ex-skinflint is now a bare-faced,\nlegally-protected robber.\"\n\n\"By no means, Belle,\" Evans said. \"How much would that be per mile?\"\n\n\"Say ten round trips per day. That would be twenty million a day gross\nfor a small ship not intended for passenger service. When we get ships\nbuilt ... and the extras....\" The money-man went into a financial revel\nof his own.\n\n\"Lots of extras,\" Banks agreed. \"And oh, _brother_, what a\npublic-relations dream of heaven!\"\n\n\"Maybe I'm dumb,\" Garlock broke in, \"but just what are you going to use\nfor money to get started?\"\n\n\"The minute we confirm any part of the story, the credit of the Galaxian\nSociety will jump from X-O to AA-A1.\"\n\n\"Oh. So Belle and I will have to lose our _Pleiades_ for a while. I\ndon't like that, but we do need the money ... but we can have her for\nthis coming week?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"So maybe we'd better break the story now, instead of letting it leak.\"\n\n\"Can you, after what you just told them?\"\n\n\"Sure I can.\" He set his mind and searched. \"Bundy, this is Garlock....\"\n\n\"So what am I supposed to do--burst into tears of joy?\"\n\n\"Save it. I changed my mind. You can break it as fast and as hard as you\nlike. I'll play along.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\n\"Yeah? Why the switch? What's the angle?\"\n\n\"Strictly commercial. Get it from Banks.\"\n\n\"And you'll--personally--go on my hour with it?\"\n\n\"Yes. Also, we'll demonstrate--take you to any star-system in the\ngalaxy. You and all the rest of the newshawks who were here and any\nfifty VIP's you want to invite. Tomorrow morning all right with you?\"\n\n\"You, personally, in the _Pleiades_?\" Bundy insisted.\n\n\"Better than that. The other two starships, too. You've got\nthem--particularly those four Primes--clearly in mind?\"\n\n\"Not exactly, there was so much of it. Spread it on me now, huh?\"\nGarlock did so. \"Thanks, pal, for the scoop. I'll crash it right now,\nand follow up with Banks. 'Bye!\"\n\n\"Think you can deliver on that, Clee?\" Banks asked.\n\n\"Sure. Both Deggi and Alsyne will need a lot of extra money, fast.\nThey'll play along.\"\n\nThey did; and that three-starship tour--which visited twenty solar\nsystems instead of one--was the most sensational thing old Earth had\never spawned.\n\nBelle and Garlock did not spend that week end on Earth. \"We go,\" they\nsaid, as soon as the _Pleiades_ was empty of pressmen, and they took\nJames and Lola along. \"If we _never_ see another such brawl as this is\ngoing to be,\" Belle told Banks, who was basking in glory and entreating\nthem to stay on for the show, \"it will be exactly twenty minutes too\nsoon.\"\n\nThus it came about that Earth's first four deep-spacemen were completely\nout of reach when unexpected developments began.\n\n        *           *           *\n\nAlonzo P. Ferber was one of the VIP's on Bundy's personally-conducted\ntour of the stars. As has been said, he was a very able executive. He\nhad an extremely keen profit-sense. This new thing smelled--simply\nreeked--of money. SSE would _have_ to get in on it.\n\nFerber was not thin-skinned; where money was concerned it would never\neven occur to him to cherish grudges or to retain animosities. Wherefore\nSSE's purchasing department suggested to the Galaxian Society that\nnegotiations be opened concerning licenses, franchises, royalties, and\nso on. These suggestions were politely but firmly brushed off. Then\nemissaries were sent, of ever-increasing caliber and weight. Next,\nFerber himself tried the tri-di; and finally, he came in person.\n\nRebuffed, he made such legally-sound threats that Evans and Macey agreed\nto a meeting; stating flatly, however, that no commitments could\npossibly be made without the knowledge and approval of the Society's\npresident, Cleander Garlock. Thus, at the meeting, the Galaxians made\nonly two statements that were even approximately definite. One was that\nGarlock would probably return to Earth during the afternoon or evening\nof the following Friday; the other that they would take the matter up\nwith Garlock as soon as they could.\n\nAfter that meeting Macey was unperturbed, but Evans was a deeply worried\nman.\n\n\"You see,\" he explained, \"the real crux was not even mentioned.\"\n\n\"No? What is it, then?\"\n\n\"Operators, Primes, and the practically non-existent laws pertaining to\ntheir ... what? Labor? Skill? Genius? For instance, could Garlock be\nforced to do whatever it is that he does? On the other hand, if Ferber\noffered Belle Bellamy five million credits a year to 'work' for SSE, is\nthere anything we could do about it?\"\n\n\"Oh. I thought all there was to it was that you'd delay 'em for a year\nor so and that'd be it.\"\n\n\"Far from it. To date I have listed fifty-eight points for which, as far\nas we can learn, there are no precedents,\" and the lawyer called a\nmeeting of his staff.\n\nFor Belle and Garlock, the week went fast. On Friday afternoon, high\nabove Earth's Galaxian Field, Garlock said, more than half regretfully,\n\"No more fun. Back to the desk. Back to the salt-mines.\"\n\n\"I weep for you,\" Belle snickered. \"Sob, sob. Shed him a tear, Lola.\"\n\n\"One tear coming up. Oh, woe; oh, woe....\"\n\n\"Oh, whoa!\" James snorted. \"Why the sob-and-moan routine, Clee, from a\nguy who's going to be monarch of all he surveys?\"\n\n\"His conscience aches him,\" Belle explained. \"This monarching business\nis tough if you haven't thought about how to monarch, and he hasn't.\nHave you, Clee?\"\n\n\"Not a lick.\" Garlock smiled slightly. \"I been busy.\"\n\n\"You better start to,\" she advised, darkly. \"You aren't busy now and we\nhave an hour. We better confer--I'll make like a slave-driver.\"\n\nThey 'ported into his room and he set the blocks. His attitude changed\ninstantly. \"Nice act, Belle. What was it all about?\"\n\n\"That theory of yours. Your predictions are too uncannily accurate to be\nguesswork, and the more times you dead-center the bullseye the worse\nscared I get. I really want to know, Clee.\"\n\n\"Okay. It isn't complete--I need a lot more data--but I'll show you what\nI have. It's fairly strong medicine and it comes in big chunks.\"\n\n\"It would have to--it covers the whole macrocosmic universe, doesn't\nit?\"\n\n\"Yes. I'll start with the striking fact that, on every out-galaxy planet\nwe visited, the human beings were _Homo sapiens_ to N decimal places.\nFertile with each other and, according to expert testimony, with us. All\nplanets had humanoid 'guardians,' the Arpalones and Arpales. Some, but\nnot all, had one or more non-human, more-or-less-intelligent races, such\nas the Fumapties, the Lemarts, the Sencors, and so on. These other races\nnever seemed to fight each other, but both races of Guardians fought any\nand all of them, on sight and to the death. What do those facts mean to\nyou?\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\n\"Nothing beyond face value. I've thought about them but I haven't been\nable to come up with anything.\"\n\n\"I have.\" He unrolled a sheet of drafting paper covered with diagrams,\nsymbols, and equations. \"But before I go into this stuff, consider the\nhuman body. How many red cells are there in your blood stream?\"\n\n\"Billions, I suppose.\"\n\n\"And there are billions of human beings on billions of planets; each\nhaving red blood cells identical, as far as we know, with yours and\nmine. Also white cells. Also, sometimes, various kinds of pathogenic\nmicro-organisms, such as staphs, streps, viruses, spiros, and so on.\n\n\"Okay. My thought is that the Lemarts, Ozobes, and the like are\nanalogous to disease-producing organisms. We saw the full range of\neffects--from none at all up to death itself.\"\n\n\"But they--the Ozobes and so on--died, too.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\n\"How long do disease germs live in a human body after they've killed\nit?\"\n\n\"But that horrible Dilipic--the golop. They don't seem to fit.\"\n\n\"Try that on for size as cancer. Also, the Arpalones typed us before\nthey'd let us land on any planet. Why didn't we blast them out of the\nway and land anyway?\"\n\n\"Why, we didn't want to. It wasn't worth while.\"\n\n\"We couldn't. Psychic block. And if we had, we would have died.\nDifferent blood-types don't mix.\"\n\n\"So you and I are merely two red cells in the bloodstream of a\nsuper-dooper-galactic super-monster? Phooie!\" she jeered. \"That chestnut\nwas propounded a thousand years ago. Are you trying to take me for a\nride on _that_ old sawhorse?\"\n\n\"That's the attitude I had at first. So now we're ready for the chart.\"\nHe pointed to a group of symbols. \"We start with symbolic logic;\nmanipulating like so to get this.\" There was a long mathematical\ndissertation; a mind-to-mind, rigorous, point-by-point proof.\n\n\"Q. E. D.\" Garlock concluded.\n\n\"I see your math, and if I believed half of it I'd be scared witless.\nThose few pieces fit, but they're scattered around in vast areas of\nblankness and you're jumping around like the Swiss miss leaping from Alp\nto Alp. And how about our own galaxy, the most important piece of all?\nIt's different, and we're different, mentally. That wrecks your whole\ntheory.\"\n\n\"No. I told you I need a lot more data. Also, beyond a certain point the\nanalogy appears to get looser.\"\n\n\"_Appears_ to! It's as loose as a goose!\"\n\n\"Think a minute. Is it actually loose, or are we getting up into\nconcepts that no human mind can grasp? That might be the case, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"Oh.... You're quite a salesman, Clee, but I'm still not buying.\"\n\n\"Our galaxy is a bit of specialized tissue--part of a ganglion, maybe.\nOver here, see? I'll have to leave it dangling until we find some more\nlike it.\"\n\n\"I see. But anyway, you haven't a tenth's worth of real material on that\nwhole sheet. Feed everything you have there into a computer and it'd\njust laugh at you.\"\n\n\"Sure it would. The great advantage of the human brain is its ability to\narrive at valid conclusions from incomplete data. For instance, what\nwould your computer do with the figures you shot at me the day we\nstarted out? 'Thirty-nine, twenty-two, thirty-nine. Five seven. One\nthirty-five.' Yet they're completely informative.\"\n\n\"To anyone interested in that kind of figures, yes.\"\n\n\"Which includes practically all adults. Then take the figure three point\none four one five nine. Compy would still be baffled; but, unlike the\nfirst set, most people would be, too.\"\n\n\"Yes. Perhaps two out of ten would get your message.\"\n\n\"Now take something really new, like the original work on gravitation or\nrelativity. No possible computer would be of any use. That takes a\n_brain_!\"\n\n\"The brain of a Newton or an Einstein, yes.\" Belle thought for a minute,\nthen grinned at him impishly. \"Now watch the brain of a Bellamy perform.\nGet into high gear, brain.... I wish I knew something about biochemical\nembryology; but I read somewhere that ova are sterile, so our galaxy is\nan ovum. Therefore our super-galooper is a gal--which incontrovertible\nfact accounts for and explains rigorously the long-known truth that\nwomen always have been, are now, and always will be vastly superior to\nmen in every quality, aspect, and....\"\n\n\"Hold it!\" Garlock snapped. His face hardened into intense\nconcentration. Then: \"Do you think you're kidding, Belle?\"\n\n\"Why, of _course_ I'm kidding, you big....\"\n\n\"Look here, then.\" He picked up a pencil and filled in blank after blank\nafter blank. \"I'm making one unjustifiable assumption--that the\n_Pleiades_ is the first intergalactic starship. The super-being is a\nfemale, and she is just becoming pregnant....\"\n\n\"Flapdoodle! There are no blood cells in a sperm, and I don't think\nthere are any in an ovum.\"\n\n\"I didn't mention either sperm or ovum. The analogy is so loose here\nthat it holds only in the broadest, most general terms. The actual\nprocess of reproduction is unknowable. But wherever we went, we changed\nthings. Not only by what we actually did, but also as a\ncatalyst--no....\"\n\n\"No, not a catalyst. A hormone.\"\n\n\"Exactly. Each of these changes would cause others, and so on. An\ninfinite series. Calling the first three terms alpha, beta, and gamma,\nwe operate like this....\" Garlock's pencil was flying now. \"Following\nme?\"\n\n\"On your tail.\" Belle was breathing hard; as the blank spaces became\nfewer and fewer her face began to turn white.\n\n\"From this we get that ... and _that_ makes the whole bracket tie into\nthe same conclusion I had before. So, except for that one assumption,\nit's solid.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\n\"My Lord, Clee!\" Belle studied the chart. \"I mentioned Newton and\nEinstein ... add to that 'the brain of a Garlock, better than either.'\"\nThen, seeing his reaction, \"You're blushing. I didn't think....\"\n\n\"Cut the comedy. You know I couldn't carry either of their hats to a\ndog-fight.\"\n\n\"And I would _never_ have believed that you are basically modest.\"\n\n\"I said cut out the kidding, Belle.\"\n\n\"I'm deadly serious. A brain that could do _that_,\" she waved at the\nchart, \"... well, even I am not enough of a heel to belittle one of the\nmost tremendous intuitions ever achieved by man. Not that I like it.\nIt's horrible. It denies mankind everything that made him come up from\nthe slime--everything that made him man.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\n\"Not at all. Nothing is changed, in man's own frame of reference. It\nmerely takes our thinking one step farther. That step, of course, isn't\neasy.\"\n\n\"_That_ is the understatement of all time. What it will _do_, though, is\nset up an inferiority complex that would wipe out the whole human race.\"\n\n\"There might be some slight tendency. Also, since my basic assumption\ncan't be justified, the whole thing may be fallacious. So I'm not going\nto publish it.\" He glanced at the chart and it vanished.\n\n\"Clee!\" Belle stared, almost goggle-eyed. \"With your name? The\ntremendous splash ... I see. You're really grown up.\"\n\n\"Not all the way, probably; but pretty nearly--I hope.\"\n\n\"But some of the ... not exactly corollaries, but....\" Belle's face,\nwhich had regained some of its color, began again to pale.\n\n\"Which one of the many?\"\n\n\"The most shattering one, to me, concerns intelligence. If it is true\nthat our vaunted mentality is only that of one blood cell compared to\nthat of a whole brain ... and that intelligence is banked, level upon\nlevel ... well, it's simply mind-wrecking. I've been trying madly not to\nthink of that concept, at all, but I can't put it off much longer.\"\n\n\"Now's as good a time as any. I'll hold your hand.\"\n\n\"You'd better hold more of me than that, I think.\"\n\n\"I'll do even that, in a good cause.\" He put his arms around her; held\nher close. \"Go ahead. Face it. All the way down and all the way up.\nYou've got what it takes. You'll come back sane and it'll never bother\nyou again.\"\n\nShe closed her eyes, put her head on his shoulder. Her every muscle went\ntense.\n\nNeither of them ever knew how long they stood there, close-clasped and\nmotionless in silence; but finally her muscles loosened. She lifted her\nhead; raised her brimming eyes.\n\n\"All the way down?\" he asked.\n\n\"To almost a geometrical point.\"\n\n\"And all the way up?\"\n\n\"I touched the fringe of infinity.\"\n\n\"Intelligence all the way?\"\n\n\"All the way. I couldn't understand any of them, of course, but I looked\neach one squarely in the eye.\"\n\n\"Good girl. And you're still sane.\"\n\n\"As much so as ever ... more so, maybe.\" She disengaged herself, sat\ndown on the bed, lighted a cigarette, and smoked half of it. Then she\nstood up. \"Clee, if anything in the whole universe ever knocked hell out\nof anything, that did out of me. I'm going to do something that will\ntake about ten minutes. Will you wait right here?\"\n\n\"Of course. Take all the time you want.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nWhen she came back Garlock leaped to his feet and stared speechlessly.\nHe could not even whistle. Belle's hair was now its natural deep, rich\nchestnut, her lipstick was red, her nails were bare, and she wore a\nwhite shirt and an almost-knee-length crimson skirt.\n\n\"Here's what I'm going to do,\" she said, quietly. \"I'm going to be a\nplain, ordinary brownette. I'm going to marry you as soon as we land;\nregistered permanent family. I'm going to have six kids and spoil them\nrotten. In short, I have grown up--partly up, at least--too.\"\n\n\"Plain?\" he managed, finally. \"Ordinary? You? Yes--like a super-nova\ngoing off under a man's feet!\" With a visible effort, Garlock pulled\nhimself together. \"I don't need to tell you what a surprise this is, and\ncan't tell you what it means to me. But you never have said you love me.\nHadn't you better?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid to. Our next kiss will be different. I'd spoil all this nice\nnew make-up.\" She tried to grin in her old-time fashion, but failed. She\nsobered, then, and went on with a completely new intensity. \"Listen,\nClee. I'm all done--forever--lying and pretending to you. I love you so\nmuch that ... well, there simply aren't any thoughts. And when I think\nof how I acted, it hurts--Lord, how it hurts! I don't see how you can\nlove me at all. It'd take a miracle.\"\n\n\"Miracles happen, then.\" He put both arms around her, very gently. \"For\nthe first time in my life I'm cutting my screens to zero. Come in.\"\n\n\"What?\" For a moment she was unable to believe the thought. Then,\ncutting her own shield, she went fully into his mind. \"Oh, I didn't dare\nhope you could _possibly_ feel.... Oh, this is wonderful, Clee--simply\n_wonderful_!\"\n\nAs the two fully-opened minds met and joined she threw both arms around\nhim and their embrace tightened as though their bodies were trying to\nbecome as nearly one as were their minds. Finally she pulled herself\naway and put up a solid block.\n\n\"What a mess!\" she said, shakily. \"Lipstick all _over_ you.\"\n\n\"Why words, sweetheart? That was perfect.\"\n\n\"Oh, it was ... but wide open, with such a mind as yours....\" she\npaused, then came back to normal almost with a snap. \"... but say; I'll\nbet that's what Therea and Alsyne were doing. That 'fusion' thing. We'll\npractise it tonight.\"\n\nHe pondered briefly. \"Sure it was.\"\n\n\"But he said they learned it from us. How could he have, when we.... Oh,\nwe did, of course, in moments of high stress ... but we didn't actually\n_know_ it....\" She paused.\n\n\"We wouldn't admit it, you mean, even to ourselves.\"\n\n\"Maybe; and of course it never occurred to us--callow youngsters we were\nthen, weren't we?--that it could be done for more than a microsecond at\na time. Or that two people could ever, possibly, _live_ that way.\"\n\n\"Or what a life it would be. So let's chop this and get back to you and\nme.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh, let's,\" she agreed, but in a severely practical tone. \"You've\ngot lipstick even on your shirt. So change it and I'll go put on a new\nface and bring over some stuff and clean you up.\"\n\nWhile she cleaned, she talked. \"I told you our next kiss would be\ndifferent, but I had no idea ... wow! _That_ will be as much different,\ntoo, I'm sure.... Hm-h-h-nh?\" Again she pressed herself against him;\nthis time in a somewhat different fashion.\n\n\"Stop that, you little devil, or I'll....\" His arms came up of\nthemselves, but he forced them back down. \"... No, I won't. We'll save\nthat for tonight, too.\"\n\n\"I'll behave myself!\" She laughed, pure joy in voice, eyes, and smile.\n\"I bet myself you wouldn't and I won! You're tall, solid gold, Clee\ndarling--the absolute top.\"\n\n\"Thanks, sweetheart. I wish that were true,\" he said, soberly. \"But I\ncan't help wondering if two such hellions as you and I are can make a go\nof marriage--no, cancel that. We'll do it--all we have to figure out is\nhow.\"\n\n\"I know what you mean. Not at first--it'll be purely wonderful then.\nAfter five years, say, when the glamor has worn off and I've had three\nof our six children and two of them are in bed with the epizootic and\nI'm all frazzled out and you're strung up tight as a bowstring with\noverwork and....\"\n\n\"Hold it! Uh-uh. No. If we can live together six months--or even six\nweeks--without killing each other, we'll have it made. It's at first\nthat it'll be rugged. No matter how rugged it gets, though, we'll know\none thing for certain sure. We _couldn't_ live apart. That'll give us\nenough leverage. Check?\"\n\n\"And double check.\" She giggled sunnily. \"I'll take care of any and all\nsituations, whatever they are, that arise in the first six months.\nYou'll be responsible for the next sixty years. That's a perfectly fair\nand equitable division of responsibility. Now kiss me and we'll go.\"\n\n        *           *           *\n\nWhen Garlock cut the Gunther blocks, however, James' thought came\ninstantly in. \"Been trying to get you for twenty minutes,\" and in a\ncouple of seconds he brought Garlock and Belle up to date. \"So Fatso's\nbeen waiting in Evans' office. He's throwing fits all over the place and\nEvans and Macey are going quietly mad.\"\n\n\"He'll have to wait,\" Garlock decided instantly. \"No matter how many\nfits he has, no such decision is going to be made until there's enough\nof a Galactic Council to make it.\"\n\n\"Well, you'll have to tell him that yourself. In person.\"\n\n\"I'll do just that, and tell him so he'll stay told.\"\n\n\"Okay, but shake a....\"\n\nBelle and Garlock 'ported out into the Main, arms around each other like\na couple of college freshmen.\n\n\"... leg-g--ug--gug....\" James gurgled.\n\n\"_Belle!_\" Lola shrieked. \"_Why--Belle--Bellamy!_\"\n\n\"_What_ goes _on_ here?\" James demanded.\n\n\"Nothing much,\" Garlock replied, although he blushed almost as deeply as\nBelle did. \"We just decided to quit fighting, is all. Cut the rope,\nJunior, and let the old bucket drop.\"\n\n\n    THE END\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Galaxy Primes, by Edward Elmer Smith\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE GALAXY PRIMES ***\n\n***** This file should be named 20898.txt or 20898.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/0/8/9/20898/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, V.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n"}
