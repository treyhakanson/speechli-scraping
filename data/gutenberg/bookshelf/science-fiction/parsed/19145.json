In height he might have been\na little above average, but not enough to make him noticeable. His brown\nhair was cropped conservatively; his unlined boy's face was not one to\nbe remembered--unless one was observant enough to note those light-gray\neyes and catch a chilling, measuring expression showing now and then for\nan instant in their depths.\n\nNeatly and inconspicuously dressed, in this last quarter of the\ntwentieth century his like was to be found on any street of the city ten\nfloors below--to all outward appearances. But that other person under\nthe protective coloring so assiduously cultivated could touch heights of\nencased and controlled fury which Murdock himself did not understand and\nwas only just learning to use as a weapon against a world he had always\nfound hostile.\n\nHe was aware, though he gave no sign of it, that a guard was watching\nhim. The cop on duty was an old hand--he probably expected some reaction\nother than passive acceptance from the prisoner. But he was not going\nto get it. The law had Ross sewed up tight this time. Why didn't they\nget about the business of shipping him off? Why had he had that\nafternoon session with the skull thumper? Ross had been on the defensive\nthen, and he had not liked it. He had given to the other's questions all\nthe attention his shrewd mind could muster, but a faint, very faint,\napprehension still clung to the memory of that meeting.\n\nThe door of the detention room opened. Ross did not turn his head, but\nthe guard cleared his throat as if their hour of mutual silence had\ndried his vocal cords. \"On your feet, Murdock! The judge wants to see\nyou.\"\n\nRoss rose smoothly, with every muscle under fluid control. It never paid\nto talk back, to allow any sign of defiance to show. He would go through\nthe motions as if he were a bad little boy who had realized his errors.\nIt was a meek-and-mild act that had paid off more than once in Ross's\ncheckered past. So he faced the man seated behind the desk in the other\nroom with an uncertain, diffident smile, standing with boyish\nawkwardness, respectfully waiting for the other to speak first.\n\nJudge Ord Rawle. It was his rotten luck to pull old Eagle Beak on his\ncase. Well, he would simply have to take it when the old boy dished it\nout. Not that he had to remain stuck with it later....\n\n\"You have a bad record, young man.\"\n\nRoss allowed his smile to fade; his shoulders slumped. But under\nconcealing lids his eyes showed an instant of cold defiance.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" he agreed in a voice carefully cultivated to shake\nconvincingly about the edges. Then suddenly all Ross's pleasure in the\nskill of his act was wiped away. Judge Rawle was not alone; that blasted\nskull thumper was sitting there, watching the prisoner with the same\nkeenness he had shown the other day.\n\n\"A very bad record for the few years you have had to make it.\" Eagle\nBeak was staring at him, too, but without the same look of penetration,\nluckily for Ross. \"By rights, you should be turned over to the new\nRehabilitation Service....\"\n\nRoss froze inside. That was the \"treatment,\" icy rumors of which had\nspread throughout his particular world. For the second time since he had\nentered the room his self-confidence was jarred. Then he clung with a\ndegree of hope to the phrasing of that last sentence.\n\n\"Instead, I have been authorized to offer you a choice, Murdock. One\nwhich I shall state--and on record--I do not in the least approve.\"\n\nRoss's twinge of fear faded. If the judge didn't like it, there must be\nsomething in it to the advantage of Ross Murdock. He'd grab it for sure!\n\n\"There is a government project in need of volunteers. It seems that you\nhave tested out as possible material for this assignment. If you sign\nfor it, the law will consider the time spent on it as part of your\nsentence. Thus you may aid the country which you have heretofore\ndisgraced----\"\n\n\"And if I refuse, I go to this rehabilitation. Is that right, sir?\"\n\n\"I certainly consider you a fit candidate for rehabilitation. Your\nrecord--\" He shuffled through the papers on his desk.\n\n\"I choose to volunteer for the project, sir.\"\n\nThe judge snorted and pushed all the papers into a folder. He spoke to a\nman waiting in the shadows. \"Here then is your volunteer, Major.\"\n\nRoss bottled in his relief. He was over the first hump. And since his\nluck had held so far, he might be about to win all the way....\n\nThe man Judge Rawle called \"Major\" moved into the light. At the first\nglance Ross, to his hidden annoyance, found himself uneasy. To face up\nto Eagle Beak was all part of the game. But somehow he sensed one did\nnot play such games with this man.\n\n\"Thank you, your honor. We will be on our way at once. This weather is\nnot very promising.\"\n\nBefore he realized what was happening, Ross found himself walking meekly\nto the door. He considered trying to give the major the slip when they\nleft the building, losing himself in a storm-darkened city. But they did\nnot take the elevator downstairs. Instead, they climbed two or three\nflights up the emergency stairs. And to his humiliation Ross found\nhimself panting and slowing, while the other man, who must have been a\ngood dozen years his senior, showed no signs of discomfort.\n\nThey came out into the snow on the roof, and the major flashed a torch\nskyward, guiding in a dark shadow which touched down before them. A\nhelicopter! For the first time Ross began to doubt the wisdom of his\nchoice.\n\n\"On your way, Murdock!\" The voice was impersonal enough, but that very\nimpersonality got under one's skin.\n\nBundled into the machine between the silent major and an equally quiet\npilot in uniform, Ross was lifted over the city, whose ways he knew as\nwell as he knew the lines on his own palm, into the unknown he was\nalready beginning to regard dubiously. The lighted streets and\nbuildings, their outlines softened by the soft wet snow, fell out of\nsight. Now they could mark the outer highways. Ross refused to ask any\nquestions. He could take this silent treatment; he _had_ taken a lot of\ntougher things in the past.\n\nThe patches of light disappeared, and the country opened out. The plane\nbanked. Ross, with all the familiar landmarks of his world gone, could\nnot have said if they were headed north or south. But moments later not\neven the thick curtain of snowflakes could blot out the pattern of red\nlights on the ground, and the helicopter settled down.\n\n\"Come on!\"\n\nFor the second time Ross obeyed. He stood shivering, engulfed in a\nminiature blizzard. His clothing, protection enough in the city, did\nlittle good against the push of the wind. A hand gripped his upper arm,\nand he was drawn forward to a low building. A door banged and Ross and\nhis companion came into a region of light and very welcome heat.\n\n\"Sit down--over there!\"\n\nToo bewildered to resent orders, Ross sat. There were other men in the\nroom. One, wearing a queer suit of padded clothing, a bulbous headgear\nhooked over his arm, was reading a paper. The major crossed to speak to\nhim and after they conferred for a moment, the major beckoned Ross with\na crooked finger. Ross trailed the officer into an inner room lined with\nlockers.\n\nFrom one of the lockers the major pulled a suit like the pilot's, and\nbegan to measure it against Ross. \"All right,\" he snapped. \"Climb into\nthis! We haven't all night.\"\n\nRoss climbed into the suit. As soon as he fastened the last zipper his\ncompanion jammed one of the domed helmets on his head. The pilot looked\nin the door. \"We'd better scramble, Kelgarries, or we may be grounded\nfor the duration!\"\n\nThey hurried back to the flying field. If the helicopter had been a\nsurprising mode of travel, this new machine was something straight out\nof the future--a needle-slim ship poised on fins, its sharp nose lifting\nvertically into the heavens. There was a scaffolding along one side,\nwhich the pilot scaled to enter the ship.\n\nUnwillingly, Ross climbed the same ladder and found that he must wedge\nhimself in on his back, his knees hunched up almost under his chin. To\nmake it worse, cramped as those quarters were, he had to share them with\nthe major. A transparent hood snapped down and was secured, sealing them\nin.\n\nDuring his short lifetime Ross had often been afraid, bitterly afraid.\nHe had fought to toughen his mind and body against such fears. But what\nhe experienced now was no ordinary fear; it was panic so strong that it\nmade him feel sick. To be shut in this small place with the knowledge\nthat he had no control over his immediate future brought him face to\nface with every terror he had ever known, all of them combined into one\nhorrible whole.\n\nHow long does a nightmare last? A moment? An hour? Ross could not time\nhis. But at last the weight of a giant hand clamped down on his chest,\nand he fought for breath until the world exploded about him.\n\nHe came back to consciousness slowly. For a second he thought he was\nblind. Then he began to sort out one shade of grayish light from\nanother. Finally, Ross became aware that he no longer rested on his\nback, but was slumped in a seat. The world about him was wrung with a\nvibration that beat in turn through his body.\n\nRoss Murdock had remained at liberty as long as he had because he was\nable to analyze a situation quickly. Seldom in the past five years had\nhe been at a loss to deal with any challenging person or action. Now he\nwas aware that he was on the defensive and was being kept there. He\nstared into the dark and thought hard and furiously. He was convinced\nthat everything that was happening to him this day was designed with\nonly one end in view--to shake his self-confidence and make him pliable.\nWhy?\n\nRoss had an enduring belief in his own abilities and he also possessed\na kind of shrewd understanding seldom granted to one so young. He knew\nthat while Murdock was important to Murdock, he was none too important\nin the scheme of things as a whole. He had a record--a record so bad\nthat Rawle might easily have thrown the book at him. But it differed in\none important way from that of many of his fellows; until now he had\nbeen able to beat most of the raps. Ross believed this was largely\nbecause he had always worked alone and taken pains to plan a job in\nadvance.\n\nWhy now had Ross Murdock become so important to someone that they would\ndo all this to shake him? He was a volunteer--for what? To be a guinea\npig for some bug they wanted to learn how to kill cheaply and easily?\nThey'd been in a big hurry to push him off base. Using the silent\ntreatment, this rushing around in planes, they were really working to\nkeep him groggy. So, all right, he'd give them a groggy boy all set up\nfor their job, whatever it was. Only, was his act good enough to fool\nthe major? Ross had a hunch that it might not be, and that really hurt.\n\nIt was deep night now. Either they had flown out of the path of the\nstorm or were above it. There were stars shining through the cover of\nthe cockpit, but no moon.\n\nRoss's formal education was sketchy, but in his own fashion he had\nacquired a range of knowledge which would have surprised many of the\nauthorities who had had to deal with him. All the wealth of a big city\nlibrary had been his to explore, and he had spent much time there,\nsoaking up facts in many odd branches of learning. Facts were very\nuseful things. On at least three occasions assorted scraps of knowledge\nhad preserved Ross's freedom, once, perhaps his life.\n\nNow he tried to fit together the scattered facts he knew about his\npresent situation into some proper pattern. He was inside some new type\nof super-super atomjet, a machine so advanced in design that it would\nnot have been used for anything that was not an important mission. Which\nmeant that Ross Murdock had become necessary to someone, somewhere.\nKnowing that fact should give him a slight edge in the future, and he\nmight well need such an edge. He'd just have to wait, play dumb, and use\nhis eyes and ears.\n\nAt the rate they were shooting along they ought to be out of the country\nin a couple of hours. Didn't the Government have bases half over the\nworld to keep the \"cold peace\"? Well, there was nothing for it. To be\nplanted abroad someplace might interfere with plans for escape, but he'd\nhandle that detail when he was forced to face it.\n\nThen suddenly Ross was on his back once more, the giant hand digging\ninto his chest and middle. This time there were no lights on the ground\nto guide them in. Ross had no intimation that they had reached their\ndestination until they set down with a jar which snapped his teeth\ntogether.\n\nThe major wriggled out, and Ross was able to stretch his cramped body.\nBut the other's hand was already on his shoulder, urging him along. Ross\ncrawled free and clung dizzily to a ladderlike disembarking structure.\n\nBelow there were no lights, only an expanse of open snow. Men were\nmoving across that blank area, gathering at the foot of the ladder. Ross\nwas hungry and very tired. If the major wanted to play games, he hoped\nthat such action could wait until the next morning.\n\nIn the meantime he must learn where \"here\" was. If he had a chance to\nrun, he wanted to know the surrounding territory. But that hand was on\nhis arm, drawing him along toward a door that stood half-open. As far as\nRoss could see, it led to the interior of a hillock of snow. Either the\nstorm or men had done a very good cover-up job, and somehow Ross knew\nthe camouflage was intentional.\n\nThat was Ross's introduction to the base, and after his arrival his view\nof the installation was extremely limited. One day was spent in\nundergoing the most searching physical he had ever experienced. And\nafter the doctors had poked and pried he was faced by a series of other\ntests no one bothered to explain. Thereafter he was introduced to\nsolitary, that is, confined to his own company in a cell-like room with\na bunk that was more comfortable than it looked and an announcer in a\ncorner of the ceiling. So far he had been told exactly nothing. And so\nfar he had asked no questions, stubbornly keeping up his end of what he\nbelieved to be a tug of wills. At the moment, safely alone and lying\nflat on his bunk he eyed the announcer, a very dangerous young man and\none who refused to yield an inch.\n\n\"Now hear this....\" The voice transmitted through that grill was\nmetallic, but its rasp held overtones of Kelgarries' voice. Ross's lips\ntightened. He had explored every inch of the walls and knew that there\nwas no trace of the door which had admitted him. With only his bare\nhands to work with he could not break out, and his only clothes were the\nshirt, sturdy slacks, and a pair of soft-soled moccasins that they had\ngiven him.\n\n\"... to identify ...\" droned the voice. Ross realized that he must have\nmissed something, not that it mattered. He was almost determined not to\nplay along any more.\n\nThere was a click, signifying that Kelgarries was through braying. But\nthe customary silence did not close in again. Instead, Ross heard a\nclear, sweet trilling which he vaguely associated with a bird. His\nacquaintance with all feathered life was limited to city sparrows and\nplump park pigeons, neither of which raised their voices in song, but\nsurely those sounds were bird notes. Ross glanced from the mike in the\nceiling to the opposite wall and what he saw there made him sit up, with\nthe instant response of an alerted fighter.\n\nFor the wall was no longer there! Instead, there was a sharp slope of\nground cutting down from peaks where the dark green of fir trees ran\nclose to the snow line. Patches of snow clung to the earth in sheltered\nplaces, and the scent of those pines was in Ross's nostrils, real as the\nwind touching him with its chill.\n\nHe shivered as a howl sounded loudly and echoed, bearing the age-old\nwarning of a wolf pack, hungry and a-hunt. Ross had never heard that\nsound before, but his human heritage subconsciously recognized it for\nwhat it was--death on four feet. Similarly, he was able to identify the\ngray shadows slinking about the nearest trees, and his hands balled into\nfists as he looked wildly about him for some weapon.\n\nThe bunk was under him and three of the four walls of the room enclosed\nhim like a cave. But one of those gray skulkers had raised its head and\nwas looking directly at him, its reddish eyes alight. Ross ripped the\ntop blanket off the bunk with a half-formed idea of snapping it at the\nanimal when it sprang.\n\nStiff-legged, the beast advanced, a guttural growl sounding deep in its\nthroat. To Ross the animal, larger than any dog he had even seen and\ntwice as vicious, was a monster. He had the blanket ready before he\nrealized that the wolf was not watching him after all, and that its\nattention was focused on a point out of his line of vision.\n\nThe wolfs muzzle wrinkled in a snarl, revealing long yellow-white teeth.\nThere was a singing twang, and the animal leaped into the air, fell\nback, and rolled on the ground, biting despairingly at a shaft\nprotruding from just behind its ribs. It howled again, and blood broke\nfrom its mouth.\n\nRoss was beyond surprise now. He pulled himself together and got up, to\nwalk steadily toward the dying wolf. And he wasn't in the least amazed\nwhen his outstretched hands flattened against an unseen barrier. Slowly,\nhe swept his hands right and left, sure that he was touching the wall of\nhis cell. Yet his eyes told him he was on a mountain side, and every\nsight, sound, and smell was making it real to him.\n\nPuzzled, he thought a moment and then, finding an explanation that\nsatisfied him, he nodded once and went back to sit at ease on his bunk.\nThis must be some superior form of TV that included odors, the illusion\nof wind, and other fancy touches to make it more vivid. The total effect\nwas so convincing that Ross had to keep reminding himself that it was\nall just a picture.\n\nThe wolf was dead. Its pack mates had fled into the brush, but since the\npicture remained, Ross decided that the show was not yet over. He could\nstill hear a click of sound, and he waited for the next bit of action.\nBut the reason for his viewing it still eluded him.\n\nA man came into view, crossing before Ross. He stooped to examine the\ndead wolf, catching it by the tail and hoisting its hindquarters off the\nground. Comparing the beast's size with the hunter's, Ross saw that he\nhad not been wrong in his estimation of the animal's unusually large\ndimensions. The man shouted over his shoulder, his words distinct\nenough, but unintelligible to Ross.\n\nThe stranger was oddly dressed--too lightly dressed if one judged the\nclimate by the frequent snow patches and the biting cold. A strip of\ncoarse cloth, extending from his armpit to about four inches above the\nknee, was wound about his body and pulled in at the waist by a belt. The\nbelt, far more ornate than the cumbersome wrapping, was made of many\nsmall chains linking metal plates and supported a long dagger which\nhung straight in front. The man also wore a round blue cloak, now swept\nback on his shoulders to free his bare arms, which was fastened by a\nlarge pin under his chin. His footgear, which extended above his calves,\nwas made of animal hide, still bearing patches of shaggy hair. His face\nwas beardless, though a shadowy line along his chin suggested that he\nhad not shaved that particular day. A fur cap concealed most of his\ndark-brown hair.\n\nWas he an Indian? No, for although his skin was tanned, it was as fair\nas Ross's under that weathering. And his clothing did not resemble any\nIndian apparel Ross had ever seen. Yet, in spite of his primitive\ntrappings, the man had such an aura of authority, of self-confidence,\nand competence that it was clear he was top dog in his own section of\nthe world.\n\nSoon another man, dressed much like the first, but with a rust-brown\ncloak, came along, pulling behind him two very reluctant donkeys, whose\neyes rolled fearfully at sight of the dead wolf. Both animals wore packs\nlashed on their backs by ropes of twisted hide. Then another man came\nalong, with another brace of donkeys. Finally, a fourth man, wearing\nskins for covering and with a mat of beard on his cheeks and chin,\nappeared. His uncovered head, a bush of uncombed flaxen hair, shone\nwhitish as he knelt beside the dead beast, a knife with a dull-gray\nblade in his hand, and set to work skinning the wolf with appreciable\nskill. Three more pairs of donkeys, all heavily laden, were led past the\nscene before he finished his task. Finally, he rolled the bloody skin\ninto a bundle and gave the flayed body a kick before he ran lightly\nafter the disappearing train of pack animals.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\n\nRoss, absorbed in the scene before him, was not prepared for the sudden\nand complete darkness which blotted out not only the action but the\nlight in his own room as well.\n\n\"What--?\" His startled voice rang loudly in his ears, too loudly, for\nall sound had been wiped out with the light. The faint swish of the\nventilating system, of which he had not been actively aware until it had\ndisappeared, was also missing. A trace of the same panic he had known in\nthe cockpit of the atomjet tingled along his nerves. But this time he\ncould meet the unknown with action.\n\nRoss slowly moved through the dark, his hands outstretched before him to\nward off contact with the wall. He was determined that somehow he would\ndiscover the hidden door, escape from this dark cell....\n\nThere! His palm struck flat against a smooth surface. He swept out his\nhand--and suddenly it passed over emptiness. Ross explored by touch.\nThere _was_ a door and now it was open. For a moment he hesitated, upset\nby a nagging little fear that if he stepped through he would be out on\nthe hillside with the wolves.\n\n\"That's stupid!\" Again he spoke aloud. And, just because he did feel\nuneasy, he moved. All the frustrations of the past hours built up in him\na raging desire to do something--anything--just so long as it was what\n_he_ wanted to do and not at another's orders.\n\nNevertheless, Ross continued to move slowly, for the space beyond that\nopen door was as deep and dark a pit as the room he left. To squeeze\nalong one wall, using an outstretched arm as a guide, was the best\nprocedure, he decided.\n\nA few feet farther on, his shoulder slipped from the surface and he half\ntumbled into another open door. But there was the wall again, and he\nclung to it thankfully. Another door ... Ross paused, trying to catch\nsome faint sound, the slightest hint that he was not alone in this\nblindman's maze. But without even air currents to stir it, the blackness\nitself took on a thick solidity which encased him as a congealing jelly.\n\nThe wall ended. Ross kept his left hand on it, flailed out with his\nright, and felt his nails scrape across another surface. The space\nseparating the two surfaces was wider than any doorway. Was it a\ncross-corridor? He was about to make a wider arm sweep when he heard a\nsound. He was not alone.\n\nRoss went back to the wall, flattening himself against it, trying to\ncontrol the volume of his own breathing in order to catch the slightest\nwhisper of the other noise. He discovered that lack of sight can confuse\nthe ear. He could not identify those clicks, the wisp of fluttering\nsound that might be air displaced by the opening of another door.\n\nFinally, he detected something moving at floor level. Someone or\nsomething must be creeping, not walking, toward him. Ross pushed back\naround the corner. It never occurred to him to challenge that crawler.\nThere was an element of danger in this strange encounter in the dark; it\nwas not meant to be a meeting between fellow explorers.\n\nThe sound of crawling was not steady. There were long pauses, and Ross\nbecame convinced that each rest was punctuated by heavy breathing as if\nthe crawler was finding progress a great and exhausting effort. He\nfought the picture that persisted in his imagination--that of a wolf\nsnuffling along the blacked-out hall. Caution suggested a quick retreat,\nbut Ross's urge to rebellion held him where he was, crouching, straining\nto see what crept toward him.\n\nSuddenly there was a blinding flare of light, and Ross's hands went to\ncover his dazzled eyes. And he heard a despairing, choked exclamation\nfrom near to floor level. The same steady light that normally filled\nhall and room was bright again. Ross found himself standing at the\njuncture of two corridors--momentarily, he was absurdly pleased that he\nhad deduced that correctly--and the crawler--?\n\nA man--at least the figure was a two-legged, two-armed body reasonably\nhuman in outline--was lying several yards away. But the body was so\nwrapped in bandages and the head so totally muffled, that it lacked all\nidentity. For that reason it was the more startling.\n\nOne of the mittened hands moved slightly, raising the body from the\nground so it could squirm forward an inch or so. Before Ross could move,\na man came running into the corridor from the far end. Murdock\nrecognized Major Kelgarries. He wet his lips as the major went down on\nhis knees beside the creature on the floor.\n\n\"Hardy! Hardy!\" That voice, which carried the snap of command whenever\nit was addressed to Ross, was now warmly human. \"Hardy, man!\" The\nmajor's hands were on the bandaged body, lifting it, easing the head and\nshoulders back against his arm. \"It's all right, Hardy. You're\nback--safe. This is the base, Hardy.\" He spoke slowly, soothingly, with\nthe steadiness one would use to comfort a frightened child.\n\nThose mittened paws which had beat feebly into the air fell onto the\nbandage-wreathed chest. \"Back--safe--\" The voice from behind the face\nmask was a rusty croak.\n\n\"Back, safe,\" the major assured him.\n\n\"Dark--dark all around again--\" protested the croak.\n\n\"Just a power failure, man. Everything's all right now. We'll get you\ninto bed.\"\n\nThe mitten pawed again until it touched Kelgarries' arm; then it flexed\na little as if the hand under it was trying to grip.\n\n\"Safe--?\"\n\n\"You bet you are!\" The major's tone carried firm reassurance. Now\nKelgarries looked up at Ross as if he knew the other had been there all\nthe time.\n\n\"Murdock, get down to the end room. Call Dr. Farrell!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir!\" The \"sir\" came so automatically that Ross had already\nreached the end room before he realized he had used it.\n\nNobody explained matters to Ross Murdock. The bandaged Hardy was claimed\nby the doctor and two attendants and carried away, the major walking\nbeside the stretcher, still holding one of the mittened hands in his.\nRoss hesitated, sure he was not supposed to follow, but not ready either\nto explore farther or return to his own room. The sight of Hardy,\nwhoever he might be, had radically changed Ross's conception of the\nproject he had too speedily volunteered to join.\n\nThat what they did here was important, Ross had never doubted. That it\nwas dangerous, he had early suspected. But his awareness had been an\nabstract concept of danger, not connected with such concrete evidence as\nHardy crawling through the dark. From the first, Ross had nursed vague\nplans for escape; now he knew he must get out of this place lest he end\nup a twin for Hardy.\n\n\"Murdock?\"\n\nHaving heard no warning sound from behind, Ross whirled, ready to use\nhis fists, his only weapons. But he did not face the major, or any of\nthe other taciturn men he knew held positions of authority. The\nnewcomer's brown skin was startling against the neutral shade of the\nwalls. His hair and brows were only a few shades darker; but the general\nsameness of color was relieved by the vivid blue of his eyes.\n\nExpressionless, the dark stranger stood quietly, his arms hanging\nloosely by his sides, studying Ross, as if the younger man was some\nproblem he had been assigned to solve. When he spoke, his voice was a\nmonotone lacking any modulation of feeling.\n\n\"I am Ashe.\" He introduced himself baldly; he might have been saying\n\"This is a table and that is a chair.\"\n\nRoss's quick temper took spark from the other's indifference. \"All\nright--so you're Ashe!\" He strove to make a challenge of it. \"And what\nis that supposed to mean?\"\n\nBut the other did not rise to the bait. He shrugged. \"For the time being\nwe have been partnered----\"\n\n\"Partnered for what?\" demanded Ross, controlling his temper.\n\n\"We work in pairs here. The machine sorts us ...\" he answered briefly\nand consulted his wrist watch. \"Mess call soon.\"\n\nAshe had already turned away, and Ross could not stand the other's lack\nof interest. While Murdock refused to ask questions of the major or any\nothers on that side of the fence, surely he could get some information\nfrom a fellow \"volunteer.\"\n\n\"What is this place, anyway?\" he asked.\n\nThe other glanced back over his shoulder. \"Operation Retrograde.\"\n\nRoss swallowed his anger. \"Okay, but what do they do here? Listen, I\njust saw a fellow who'd been banged up as if he'd been in a concrete\nmixer, creeping along this hall. What sort of work do they do here? And\nwhat do we have to do?\"\n\nTo his amazement Ashe smiled, at least his lips quirked faintly. \"Hardy\ngot under your skin, eh? Well, we have our percentage of failures. They\nare as few as it's humanly possible to make, and they give us every\nadvantage that can be worked out for us----\"\n\n\"Failures at what?\"\n\n\"Operation Retrograde.\"\n\nSomewhere down the hall a buzzer gave a muted whirr.\n\n\"That's mess call. And I'm hungry, even if you're not.\" Ashe walked away\nas if Ross Murdock had ceased to exist.\n\nBut Ross Murdock did exist, and to him that was an important fact. As he\ntrailed along behind Ashe he determined that he was going to continue to\nexist, in one piece and unharmed, Operation Retrograde or no Operation\nRetrograde. And he was going to pry a few enlightening answers out of\nsomebody very soon.\n\nTo his surprise he found Ashe waiting for him at the door of a room from\nwhich came the sound of voices and a subdued clatter of trays and\ntableware.\n\n\"Not many in tonight,\" Ashe commented in a take-it-or-leave-it tone.\n\"It's been a busy week.\"\n\nThe room was rather sparsely occupied. Five tables were empty, while the\nmen gathered at the remaining two. Ross counted ten men, either already\neating or coming back from a serving hatch with well-filled trays. All\nof them were dressed in slacks, shirt, and moccasins like himself--the\noutfit seemed to be a sort of undress uniform--and six of them were\nordinary in physical appearance. The other four differed so radically\nthat Ross could barely conceal his amazement.\n\nSince their fellows accepted them without comment, Ross silently stole\nglances at them as he waited behind Ashe for a tray. One pair were\nclearly Oriental; they were small, lean men with thin brackets of long\nblack mustache on either side of their mobile mouths. Yet he had caught\na word or two of their conversation, and they spoke his own language\nwith the facility of the native born. In addition to the mustaches, each\nwore a blue tattoo mark on the forehead and others of the same design on\nthe backs of their agile hands.\n\nThe second duo were even more fantastic. The color of their flaxen hair\nwas normal, but they wore it in braids long enough to swing across their\npowerful shoulders, a fashion unlike any Ross had ever seen. Yet any\nsuggestion of effeminacy certainly did not survive beyond the first\nglance at their ruggedly masculine features.\n\n\"Gordon!\" One of the braided giants swung halfway around from the table\nto halt Ashe as he came down the aisle with his tray. \"When did you get\nback? And where is Sanford?\"\n\nOne of the Orientals laid down the spoon with which he had been\nvigorously stirring his coffee and asked with real concern, \"Another\nloss?\"\n\nAshe shook his head. \"Just reassignment. Sandy's holding down Outpost\nGog and doing well.\" He grinned and his face came to life with an\nexpression of impish humor Ross would not have believed possible. \"He'll\nend up with a million or two if he doesn't watch out. He takes to trade\nas if he were born with a beaker in his fist.\"\n\nThe Oriental laughed and then glanced at Ross. \"Your new partner, Ashe?\"\n\nSome of the animation disappeared from Ashe's brown face; he was\nnoncommittal again. \"Temporary assignment. This is Murdock.\" The\nintroduction was flat enough to daunt Ross. \"Hodaki, Feng,\" he\nindicated the two Easterners with a nod as he put down his tray.\n\"Jansen, Van Wyke.\" That accounted for the blonds.\n\n\"Ashe!\" A man arose at the other table and came to stand beside theirs.\nThin, with a dark, narrow face and restless eyes, he was much younger\nthan the others, younger and not so well controlled. He might answer\nquestions if there was something in it for him, Ross decided, and filed\nthe thought away.\n\n\"Well, Kurt?\" Ashe's recognition was as dampening as it could be, and\nRoss's estimation of the younger man went up a fraction when the snub\nappeared to have no effect upon him.\n\n\"Did you hear about Hardy?\"\n\nFeng looked as if he were about to speak, and Van Wyke frowned. Ashe\nmade a deliberate process of chewing and swallowing before he replied.\n\"Naturally.\" His tone reduced whatever had happened to Hardy to a\nmatter-of-fact proceeding far removed from Kurt's implied melodrama.\n\n\"He's smashed up ... kaput....\" Kurt's accent, slight in the beginning,\nwas thickening. \"Tortured....\"\n\nAshe regarded him levelly. \"You aren't on Hardy's run, are you?\"\n\nStill Kurt refused to be quashed. \"Of course, I'm not! You know the run\nI am in training for. But that is not saying that such can not happen as\nwell on my run, or yours, or yours!\" He pointed a stabbing finger at\nFeng and then at the blond men.\n\n\"You can fall out of bed and break your neck, too, if your number comes\nup that way,\" observed Jansen. \"Go cry on Millaird's shoulder if it\nhurts you that much. You were told the score at your briefing. You know\nwhy you were picked....\"\n\nRoss caught a faint glance aimed at him by Ashe. He was still totally in\nthe dark, but he would not try to pry any information from this crowd.\nMaybe part of their training was this hush-hush business. He would wait\nand see, until he could get Kurt aside and do a little pumping.\nMeanwhile he ate stolidly and tried to cover up his interest in the\nconversation.\n\n\"Then you are going to keep on saying 'Yes, sir,' 'No, sir,' to every\norder here----?\"\n\nHodaki slammed his tattooed hand on the table. \"Why this foolishness,\nKurt? You well know how and why we are picked for runs. Hardy had the\ndeck stacked against him through no fault of the project. That has\nhappened before; it will happen again----\"\n\n\"Which is what I have been saying! Do you wish it to happen to you?\nPretty games those tribesmen on your run play with their prisoners, do\nthey not?\"\n\n\"Oh, shut up!\" Jansen got to his feet. Since he loomed at least five\ninches above Kurt and probably could have broken him in two over one\nmassive knee, his order was one to be considered. \"If you have any\ncomplaints, go make them to Millaird. And, little man\"--he poked a\nmassive forefinger into Kurt's chest--\"wait until you make that first\nrun of yours before you sound off so loudly. No one is sent out without\nevery ounce of preparation he can take. But we can't set up luck in\nadvance, and Hardy was unlucky. That's that. We got him back, and that\nwas lucky for him. He'd be the first to tell you so.\" He stretched. \"I'm\nfor a game--Ashe? Hodaki?\"\n\n\"Always so energetic,\" murmured Ashe, but he nodded as did the small\nOriental.\n\nFeng smiled at Ross. \"Always these three try to beat each other, and so\nfar all the contests are draws. But we hope ... yes, we have hopes....\"\n\nSo Ross had no chance to speak to Kurt. Instead, he was drawn into the\nknot of men who, having finished their meal, entered a small arena with\na half circle of spectator seats at one side and a space for contestants\nat the other. What followed absorbed Ross as completely as the earlier\nscene of the wolf killing. This too was a fight, but not a physical\nstruggle. All three contenders were not only unlike in body, but as Ross\nspeedily came to understand, they were also unlike in their mental\napproach to any problem.\n\nThey seated themselves crosslegged at the three points of a triangle.\nThen Ashe looked from the tall blond to the small Oriental. \"Territory?\"\nhe asked crisply.\n\n\"Inland plains!\" That came almost in chorus, and each man, looking at\nhis opponent, began to laugh.\n\nAshe himself chuckled. \"Trying to be smart tonight, boys?\" he inquired.\n\"All right, plains it is.\"\n\nHe brought his hand down on the floor before him, and to Ross's\nastonishment the area around the players darkened and the floor became a\nstretch of miniature countryside. Grassy plains rippled under the wind\nof a fair day.\n\n\"Red!\"\n\n\"Blue!\"\n\n\"Yellow!\"\n\nThe choices came quickly from the dusk masking the players. And upon\nthose orders points of the designated color came into being as small\nlights.\n\n\"Red--caravan!\" Ross recognized Jansen's boom.\n\n\"Blue--raiders!\" Hodaki's choice was only an instant behind.\n\n\"Yellow--unknown factor.\"\n\nRoss was sure that sigh came from Jansen. \"Is the unknown factor a\nnatural phenomenon?\"\n\n\"No--tribe on the march.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" Hodaki was considering that. Ross could picture his shrug.\n\nThe game began. Ross had heard of chess, of war games played with\nminiature armies or ships, of games on paper which demand from the\nplayers a quick wit and a trained memory. This game, however, was all\nthose combined, and more. As his imagination came to life the moving\npoints of light were transformed into the raiders, the merchants'\ncaravan, the tribe on the march. There was ingenious deployment, a\nbattle, a retreat, a small victory here, to be followed by a bigger\ndefeat there. The game might have gone on for hours. The men about him\nmuttered, taking sides and arguing heatedly in voices low enough not to\ndrown out the moves called by the players. Ross was thrilled when the\nred traders avoided a very cleverly laid ambush, and indignant when the\ntribe was forced to withdraw or the caravan lost points. It was the most\nfascinating game he had ever seen, and he realized that the three men\nordering those moves were all masters of strategy. Their respective\nskills checkmated each other so equally that an outright win was far\naway.\n\nThen Jansen laughed, and the red line of the caravan gathered in a tight\nknot. \"Camped at a spring,\" he announced, \"but with plenty of sentries\nout.\" Red sparks showed briefly beyond that center core. \"And they'll\nhave to stay there for all of me. We could keep this up till doomsday,\nand nobody would crack.\"\n\n\"No\"--Hodaki contradicted him--\"someday one of you will make a little\nmistake and then----\"\n\n\"And then whatever bully boys you're running will clobber us?\" asked\nJansen. \"That'll be the day! Anyway, truce for now.\"\n\n\"Granted!\"\n\nThe lights of the arena went on and the plains vanished into a dark,\ntiled floor. \"Any time you want a return engagement it'll be fine with\nme,\" said Ashe, getting up.\n\nJansen grinned. \"Put that off for a month or so, Gordon. We push into\ntime tomorrow. Take care of yourselves, you two. I don't want to have to\nbreak in another set of players when I come back.\"\n\nRoss, finding it difficult to shake off the illusion which had held him\nentranced, felt a slight touch on his shoulder and glanced up. Kurt\nstood behind him, apparently intent upon Jansen and Hodaki as they\nargued over some point of the game.\n\n\"See you tonight.\" The boy's lips hardly moved, a trick Ross knew from\nhis own past. Yes, he _would_ see Kurt tonight, or whenever he could. He\nwas going to learn what it was this odd company seemed determined to\nkeep as their own private secret.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\n\nRoss stood cautiously against the wall of his darkened room, his head\nturned toward the slightly open door. A slight shuffling sound had\nawakened him, and he was now as ready as a cat before her spring. But he\ndid not hurl himself at the figure now easing the door farther open. He\nwaited until the visitor was approaching the bunk before he slid along\nthe wall, closing the door and putting his shoulders against it.\n\n\"What's the pitch?\" Ross demanded in a whisper.\n\nThere was a ragged breath, maybe two, then a little laugh out of the\ndark. \"You are ready?\" The visitor's accent left no doubt as to his\nidentity. Kurt was paying him the promised visit.\n\n\"Did you think that I wouldn't be?\"\n\n\"No.\" The dim figure sat without invitation on the edge of the bunk. \"I\nwould not be here otherwise, Murdock. You are plenty ... have plenty on\nthe ball. You see, I have heard things about you. Like me, you were\ntricked into this game. Tell me, is it not true that you saw Hardy\ntonight.\"\n\n\"You hear a lot, don't you?\" Ross was noncommittal.\n\n\"I hear, I see, I learn more than these big mouths, like the major with\nall his do's and don'ts. That I can tell you! You saw Hardy. Do _you_\nwant to be a Hardy?\"\n\n\"Is there any danger of that?\"\n\n\"Danger!\" Kurt snorted. \"Danger--you have not yet known the meaning of\ndanger, little man. Not until now. I ask you again, do you want to end\nlike Hardy? They have not yet looped you in with all their big talk.\nThat is why I came here tonight. If you know what is good for you,\nMurdock, you will make a break before they tape you----\"\n\n\"Tape me?\"\n\nKurt's laugh was full of anger, not amusement. \"Oh, yes. They have many\ntricks here. They are big brains, eggheads, all of them with their\nfavorite gadgets. They put you through a machine to get you registered\non a tape. Then, my boy, you cannot get outside the base without ringing\nall the alarms! Neat, eh? So if you want to make a break, you must try\nit before they tape you.\"\n\nRoss did not trust Kurt, but he was listening to him attentively. The\nother's argument sounded convincing to one whose general ignorance of\nscience led him to be as fearful of the whole field as his ancestors had\nbeen of black magic. As all his generation, he was conditioned to\nbelieve that all kinds of weird inventions were entirely possible and\nprobable--usually to be produced in some dim future, but perhaps today.\n\n\"They must have you taped,\" Ross pointed out.\n\nKurt laughed again, but this time he was amused. \"They believe that they\nhave. Only they are not as smart as they believe, the major and the\nrest, including Millaird! No, I have a fighting chance to get out of\nthis place, only I cannot do it alone. That is why I have been waiting\nfor them to bring in a new guy I could get to before they had him pinned\ndown for good. You are tough, Murdock. I saw your record, and I'm\nbetting that you did not come here with the intention of staying.\nSo--here is your chance to go along with one who knows the ropes. You\nwill not have such a good one again.\"\n\nThe longer Kurt talked, the more convincing he was. Ross lost a few of\nhis suspicions. It was true that he had come prepared to run at the\nfirst possible opportunity, and if Kurt had everything planned, so much\nthe better. Of course, it was possible that Kurt was a stool pigeon,\nleading him on as a test. But that was a chance Ross would have to take.\n\n\"Look here, Murdock, maybe you think it's easy to break out of here. Do\nyou know where we are, boy? We're near enough to the North Pole as makes\nno difference! Are you going to leg it back some hundreds of miles\nthrough thick ice and snow? A nice jaunt if you make it. I do not think\nthat you can--not without plans and a partner who knows what he is\nabout.\"\n\n\"And how _do_ we go? Steal one of those atomjets? I'm no pilot--are\nyou?\"\n\n\"They have other things besides a-j's here. This place is strictly\nhush-hush. Even the a-j's do not set down too often for fear they will\nbe tracked by radar. Where have you been, boy? Don't you know the Reds\nare circling around up here? These fellows watch for Red activity, and\nthe Reds watch them. They play it under the table on both sides. We get\nour supplies overland by cats----\"\n\n\"Cats?\"\n\n\"Snow sleds, like tractors,\" the other answered impatiently. \"Our stuff\nis dumped miles to the south, and the cats go down once a month to bring\nit back. There's no trick to driving a cat, and they tear off the\nmiles----\"\n\n\"How many miles to the south?\" inquired Ross skeptically. Granted Kurt\nwas speaking the truth, travel over an arctic wilderness in a stolen\nmachine was risky, to say the least. Ross had only a very vague idea of\nthe polar regions, but he was sure that they could easily swallow up the\nunwary forever.\n\n\"Maybe only a hundred or so, boy. But I have more than one plan, and I'm\nwilling to risk _my_ neck. Do you think I intend to start out blind?\"\n\nThere was that, of course. Ross had early sized up his visitor as one\nwho was first of all interested in his own welfare. He wouldn't risk his\nneck without a definite plan in mind.\n\n\"Well, what do you say, Murdock? Are you with me or not?\"\n\n\"I'll take some time to chew it over----\"\n\n\"Time is what you do not have, boy. Tomorrow they will tape you.\nThen--no over the wall for you.\"\n\n\"Suppose you tell me your trick for fooling the tape,\" Ross countered.\n\n\"That I cannot do, seeing as how it lies in the way my brain is put\ntogether. Do you think I can break open my skull and hand you a piece of\nwhat is inside? No, you jump with me tonight or else I must wait to grab\nthe next one who lands here.\"\n\nKurt stood up. His last words were spoken matter-of-factly, and Ross\nbelieved he meant exactly what he said. But Ross hesitated. He wanted to\ntry for freedom, a desire fed by his suspicions of what was going on\nhere. He neither liked nor trusted Kurt, but he thought he understood\nhim--better than he understood Ashe or the others. Also, with Kurt he\nwas sure he could hold his own; it would be the kind of struggle he had\nexperienced before.\n\n\"Tonight....\" he repeated slowly.\n\n\"Yes, tonight!\" There was new eagerness in Kurt's voice, for he sensed\nthat the other was wavering. \"I have been preparing for a long time, but\nthere must be two of us. We have to take turns driving the cat. There\ncan be no rest until we are far to the south. I tell you it will be\neasy. There are food caches arranged along the route for emergencies. I\nhave a map marked to show where they are. Are you coming?\"\n\nWhen Ross did not answer at once the other moved closer to him.\n\n\"Remember Hardy? He was not the first, and he will not be the last. They\nuse us up fast here. That is why they brought you so quickly. I tell\nyou, it is better to take your chance with me than on a run.\"\n\n\"And what is a run?\"\n\n\"So they have not yet briefed you? Well, a run is a little jaunt back\ninto history--not nice comfortable history such as you learned out of a\nbook when you were a little kid. No, you are dropped back into some\nsavage time before history----\"\n\n\"That's impossible!\"\n\n\"Yes? You saw those two big blond boys tonight, did you not? Why do you\nsuppose they sport those braids? Because they are taking a little trip\ninto the time when he-men wore braids, and carried axes big enough to\ncrack a man open! And Hodaki and his partner.... Ever hear of the\nTartars? Maybe you have not, but once they nearly overran most of\nEurope.\"\n\nRoss swallowed. He now knew where he had seen braids pictured on\nwarriors--the Vikings! And Tartars, yes, that movie about someone named\nKhan, Genghis Khan! But to return into the past was impossible.\n\nYet, he remembered the picture he had watched today with the wolf slayer\nand the shaggy-haired man who wore skins. Neither of these was of his\nown world! Could Kurt be telling the truth? Ross's vivid memory of the\nscene he had witnessed made Kurt's story more convincing.\n\n\"Suppose you get sent back to a time where they do not like strangers,\"\nKurt continued. \"Then you are in for it. That is what happened to Hardy.\nAnd it is not good--not good at all!\"\n\n\"But why?\"\n\nKurt snorted. \"_That_ they do not tell you until just before you take\nyour first run. I do not want to know why. But I do know that I am not\ngoing to be sent into any wilderness where a savage may run a spear\nthrough me just to prove something or other for Major John Kelgarries,\nor for Millaird either. I will try my plan first.\"\n\nThe urgency in Kurt's protest carried Ross past the wavering point. He,\ntoo, would try the cat. He was only familiar with this time and world;\nhe had no desire to be sent into another one.\n\nOnce Ross had made his decision, Kurt hurried him into action. Kurt's\nknowledge of the secret procedures at the base proved excellent. Twice\nthey were halted by locked doors, but only momentarily, for Kurt had a\ntiny gadget, concealed in the palm of his hand, which had only to be\nheld over a latch to open a recalcitrant door.\n\nThere was enough light in the corridors to give them easy passage, but\nthe rooms were dark, and twice Kurt had to lead Ross by the hand,\navoiding furniture or installations with the surety of one who had\npracticed that same route often. Murdock's opinion of his companion's\nability underwent several upward revisions during that tour, and he\nbegan to believe that he was really in luck to have found such a\npartner.\n\nIn the last room, Ross willingly followed Kurt's orders to put on the\nfur clothing Kurt passed to him. The fit was not exact, but he surmised\nthat Kurt had chosen as well as possible. A final door opened, and they\nstepped out into the polar night of winter. Kurt's mittened hand grasped\nRoss's, pulling him along. Together, they pushed back the door of a\nhangar shed to get at their escape vehicle.\n\nThe cat was a strange machine, but Ross was given no time to study it.\nHe was shoved into the cockpit, a bubble covering settled down over\nthem, closing them in, and the engine came to life under Kurt's urging.\nThe cat must be traveling at its best pace, Ross thought. Yet the crawl\nwhich took them away from the mounded snow covering the base seemed\nhardly better than a man could make afoot.\n\nFor a short time Kurt headed straight away from the starting point, but\nRoss soon heard him counting slowly to himself as if he were timing\nsomething. At the count of twenty the cat swung to the right and made a\nwide half circle which was copied at the next count of twenty by a\nsimilar sweep in the opposite direction. After this pattern had been\nrepeated for six turns, Ross found it difficult to guess whether they\nhad ever returned to their first course. When Kurt stopped counting he\nasked, \"Why the dance pattern?\"\n\n\"Would you rather be scattered in little pieces all over the landscape?\"\nthe other snapped. \"The base doesn't need fences two miles high to keep\nus in, or others out; they take other precautions. You should thank\nfortune we got through that first mine field without blowing....\"\n\nRoss swallowed, but he refused to let Kurt know that he was rattled. \"So\nit isn't as easy to get away as you said?\"\n\n\"Shut up!\" Kurt began counting again, and Ross had some cold\napprehensive moments in which to reflect upon the folly of quick\ndecisions and wonder bleakly why he had not thought things through\nbefore he leaped.\n\nAgain they sketched a weaving pattern in the snow, but this time the\narcs formed acute angles. Ross glanced now and then at the intent man at\nthe wheel. How had Kurt managed to memorize this route? His urge to\nescape the base must certainly be a strong one.\n\nBack and forth they crawled, gaining only a few yards in each of those\nangled strikes to right or left.\n\n\"Good thing these cats are atomic powered,\" Kurt commented during one of\nthe intervals between mine fields. \"We'd run out of fuel otherwise.\"\n\nRoss fought down the impulse to move his feet away from any possible\ncontact point with the engine. These machines must be safe to ride in,\nbut the bogy of radiation was frightening. Luckily, Kurt was now back to\na straight track, with no more weaving.\n\n\"We are out!\" Kurt said with exultation. But he added no more than just\nthe reassurance of their escape.\n\nThe cat crawled on. To Ross's eyes there was no trail to follow, no\nguideposts, yet Kurt steered ahead with confidence. A little later he\npulled to a stop and said to Ross, \"We have to drive turn and turn\nabout--your turn.\"\n\nRoss was dubious. \"Well, I can drive a car--but this----\"\n\n\"Is fool proof.\" Kurt caught him up. \"The worst was getting through the\nmine fields, and we are out of that now. See here--\" his hand made a\nshadow on the lighted instrument panel, \"this will keep you straight. If\nyou can steer a car, you can steer this. Watch!\" He started up again and\nonce more swung the cat to the left.\n\nA light on the panel began to blink at a rate which increased rapidly as\nthey veered farther away from their original course.\n\n\"See? You keep that light steady, and you are on course. If it begins to\nblink, you cast about until it steadies again. Simple enough for a baby.\nTake over and see.\"\n\nIt was hard to change places in the sealed cabin of the cat, but they\nwere successful, and Ross took the wheel gingerly. Following Kurt's\ndirections, he started ahead, his eyes focused on the light rather than\nthe white expanse before him. And after a few minutes of strain he\ncaught the hang of it. As Kurt had promised, it was very simple. After\nwatching him for a while, his instructor gave a grunt of satisfaction\nand settled down for a nap.\n\nOnce the first excitement of driving the cat wore off, the operation\ntended to become monotonous. Ross caught himself yawning, but he kept at\nhis post with dogged stubbornness. This had been Kurt's game all the way\nthrough--so far--and he was certainly not going to resign his first\nchance to show that he could be of use also. If there had only been some\nbreak in the eternal snow, some passing light or goal to be seen ahead,\nit would not have been so bad. Finally, every now and then, Ross had to\njiggle off course just enough so that the warning blink of light would\nalert him and keep him from falling asleep. He was unaware that Kurt had\nawakened during one of those maneuvers until the other spoke. \"Your own\nprivate alarm clock, Murdock? Okay, I do not quarrel with anyone who\nuses his head. But you had better get some shut-eye, or we will not keep\nrolling.\"\n\nRoss was too tired to protest. They changed places, and he curled up as\nbest he could on his small share of seat. Only now that he was free to\nsleep, he realized he no longer wanted to. Kurt must have thought Ross\nhad fallen asleep, for after perhaps two miles of steady grinding along,\nhe moved cautiously behind the wheel. Ross saw by the trace of light\nfrom the instrument panel that his companion was digging into the breast\nof his parka to bring out a small object which he held against the wheel\nof the cat with one hand, while with the other he tapped out an\nirregular rhythm.\n\nTo Ross the action made no sense. But he did not miss the other's sigh\nof relief as he restored his treasure to hiding once more, as if some\ndifficult task was now behind him. Shortly afterward the cat ground to\na stop, and Ross sat up, rubbing his eyes. \"What's the matter? Engine\ntrouble?\"\n\nKurt had folded his arms across the wheel. \"No. It is just that we are\nto wait here----\"\n\n\"Wait? For what? Kelgarries to come along and pick us up?\"\n\nKurt laughed. \"The major? How I wish that he _would_ arrive presently.\nWhat a surprise he would receive! Not two little mice to be put back\ninto their cages, but the tiger cat, all claws and fangs!\"\n\nRoss sat up straighter. This now had the bad smell of a frame, a frame\nwith himself planted right in the middle. He figured out the\npossibilities and came up with an answer which would smear Ross Murdock\nall over any map. If Kurt were waiting to meet friends out here, they\ncould only be of one brand.\n\nFor most of his short life Ross had been engaged in a private war\nagainst the restrictions imposed upon him by a set of legal rules to\nwhich something within him would not conform. And he had, during those\nsame years filled with attacks, retreats, and strategic maneuvering,\nformulated a code of rules by which to play his dangerous game. He had\nnot murdered, and he would never follow the path Kurt took. To one who\nwas supremely impatient of restraint, the methods and aims of Kurt's\nemployers were not only impossibly fantastic and illogical--they were to\nbe opposed to the last ounce of any man's energy.\n\n\"Your friends late?\" He tried to sound casual.\n\n\"Not yet, and if you now plan to play the hero, Murdock, think better of\nit!\" Kurt's tone held the crack of an order--that note Ross had so much\ndisliked in the major's voice. \"This is an operation which has been most\ncarefully planned and upon which a great deal depends. No one shall\nspoil it for us now----\"\n\n\"The Reds planted you on the project, eh?\" Ross wanted to keep the other\ntalking to give himself a chance to think. And this was one time he had\nto think, clearly and with speed.\n\n\"There is no need for me to tell you the sad tale of my life, Murdock.\nAnd you would doubtless find much of it boring. If you wish to continue\nto live--for a while, at least--you will remain quiet and do as you are\ntold.\"\n\nKurt must be armed, for he would not be so confident unless he had a\nweapon he could now turn on Ross. On the other hand, if what Ross\nguessed were true, this _was_ the time to play the hero--when there was\nonly Kurt to handle. Better to be a dead hero than a live captive in the\nhands of Kurt's dear friends across the pole.\n\nWithout warning, Ross threw his body to the left, striving to pin Kurt\nagainst the driver's side of the cabin, his hands clawing at the fur\nruff bordering the other's hood, trying for a throat hold. Perhaps it\nwas Kurt's over-confidence which betrayed him and left him open to a\nsurprise attack. He struggled hard to bring up his arm, but both his\nweight and Ross's held him tight. Ross caught at his wrist, noticing a\ngleam of metal.\n\nThey threshed about, the bulkiness of the fur clothing hampering them.\nRoss wondered fleetingly why the other had not made sure of him earlier.\nAs it was he fought with all his vigor to keep Kurt immobile, to try and\nknock him out with a lucky blow.\n\nIn the end Kurt aided in his own defeat. When Ross relaxed somewhat, the\nother pushed against him, only to have Ross flinch to one side. Kurt\ncould not stop himself, and his head cracked against the wheel of the\ncat. He went limp.\n\nRoss made the most of the next few moments. He brought his belt from\nunder his parka, twisting it around Kurt's wrists with no gentleness.\nThen he wriggled about, changing places with the unconscious man.\n\nHe had no idea of where to go, but he was sure he was going to get\naway--at the cat's top speed--from that point. And with that in mind and\nonly a limited knowledge of how to manage the machine, Ross started up\nand turned in a wide circle until he was sure the cat was headed in the\nopposite direction.\n\nThe light which had guided them was still on. Would reversing its\nprocess take him back to the base? Lost in the immensity of the cold\nwilderness, he made the only choice possible and gunned the cat again.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\n\nOnce again Ross sat waiting for others to decide his future. He was as\noutwardly composed as he had been in Judge Rawle's chambers, but\ninwardly he was far more apprehensive. Out in the wilderness of the\npolar night he had had no chance for escape. Heading away from Kurt's\nrendezvous, Ross had run straight into the search party from the base,\nhad seen in action that mechanical hound that Kurt had said they would\nput on the fugitives' trail--the thing which would have gone on hunting\nthem until its metal rusted into powder. Kurt's boasted immunity to that\ntracker had not been as good as he had believed, though it had won them\na start.\n\nRoss did not know just how much it might count in his favor that he had\nbeen on his way back, with Kurt a prisoner in the cat. As his waiting\nhours wore on he began to think it might mean very little indeed. This\ntime there was no show on the wall of his cell, nothing but time to\nthink--too much of that--and no pleasant things to think about.\n\nBut he had learned one valuable lesson on that cold expedition.\nKelgarries and the others at the base were the most formidable\nopponents he had ever met, and all the balance of luck and equipment lay\non their side of the scales. Ross was now convinced that there could be\nno escape from this base. He had been impressed by Kurt's preparations,\nknowing that some of them were far beyond anything he himself could have\ndevised. He did not doubt that Kurt had come here fully prepared with\nevery ingenious device the Reds could supply.\n\nAt least Kurt's friends had had a rude welcome when they did arrive at\nthe meeting place. Kelgarries had heard Ross out and then had sent ahead\na team. Before Ross's party had reached the base there had been a blast\nwhich split the arctic night wide open. And Kurt, conscious by then, had\nshown his only sign of emotion when he realized what it meant.\n\nThe door to Ross's cell room clicked, and he swung his feet to the\nfloor, sitting up on his bunk to face his future. This time he made no\nattempt to put on an act. He was not in the least sorry he had tried to\nget away. Had Kurt been on the level, it would have been a bright play.\nThat Kurt was not, was just plain bad luck.\n\nKelgarries and Ashe entered, and at the sight of Ashe the taut feeling\nin Ross's middle loosened a bit. The major might come by himself to pass\nsentence, but he would not bring Ashe along if the sentence was a really\nharsh one.\n\n\"You got off to a bad start here, Murdock.\" The major sat down on the\nedge of the wall shelf which doubled as a table. \"You're going to have a\nsecond chance, so consider yourself lucky. We know you aren't another\nplant of our enemies, a fact that saves your neck. Do you have anything\nto add to your story?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\" He was not adding that \"sir\" to curry any favor; it came\nnaturally when one answered Kelgarries.\n\n\"But you have some questions?\"\n\nRoss met that with the truth. \"A lot of them.\"\n\n\"Why don't you ask them?\"\n\nRoss smiled thinly, an expression far removed and years older than his\nbashful boy's grin of the shy act. \"A wise guy doesn't spill his\nignorance. He uses his eyes and ears and keeps his trap shut----\"\n\n\"And goes off half cocked as a result...\" the major added. \"I don't\nthink you would have enjoyed the company of Kurt's paymaster.\"\n\n\"I didn't know about him then--not when I left here.\"\n\n\"Yes, and when you discovered the truth, you took steps. Why?\" For the\nfirst time there was a trace of feeling in the major's voice.\n\n\"Because I don't like the line-up on his side of the fence.\"'\n\n\"That single fact has saved your neck this time, Murdock. Step out of\nline once more, and nothing will help you. But just so we won't have to\nworry about that, suppose you ask a few of those questions.\"\n\n\"How much of what Kurt fed me is the truth?\" Ross blurted out. \"I mean\nall that stuff about shooting back in time.\"\n\n\"All of it.\" The major said it so quietly that it carried complete\nconviction.\n\n\"But why--how--?\"\n\n\"You have us on a spot, Murdock. Because of your little expedition, we\nhave to tell you more now than we tell any of our men before the final\nbriefing. Listen, and then forget all of it except what applies to the\njob at hand.\n\n\"The Reds shot up Sputnik and then Muttnik.... When--? Twenty-five years\nago. We got up our answers a little later. There were a couple of\nspectacular crashes on the moon, then that space station that didn't\nstay in orbit, after that--stalemate. In the past quarter century we've\nhad no voyages into space, nothing that was prophesied. Too many bugs,\ntoo many costly failures. Finally we began to get hints of something\nbig, bigger than any football roaming the heavens.\n\n\"Any discovery in science comes about by steps. It can be traced back\nthrough those steps by another scientist. But suppose you were\nconfronted by a result which apparently had been produced without any\npreliminaries. What would be your guess concerning it?\"\n\nRoss stared at the major. Although he didn't see what all this had to do\nwith time-jumping, he sensed that Kelgarries was waiting for a serious\nanswer, that somehow Ross would be judged by his reply.\n\n\"Either that the steps were kept strictly secret,\" he said slowly, \"or\nthat the result didn't rightfully belong to the man who said he\ndiscovered it.\"\n\nFor the first time the major regarded him with approval. \"Suppose this\ndiscovery was vital to your life--what would you do?\"\n\n\"Try to find the source!\"\n\n\"There you have it! Within the past five years our friends across the\nway have come up with three such discoveries. One we were able to trace,\nduplicate, and use, with a few refinements of our own. The other two\nremain rootless; yet they are linked with the first. We are now\nattempting to solve that problem, and the time grows late. For some\nreason, though the Reds now have their super, super gadgets, they are\nnot yet ready to use them. Sometimes the things work, and sometimes they\nfail. Everything points to the fact that the Reds are now experimenting\nwith discoveries which are not basically their own----\"\n\n\"Where did they get them? From another world?\" Ross's imagination came\nto life. Had a successful space voyage been kept secret? Had there been\ncontact made with another intelligent race?\n\n\"In a way it's another world, but the world of time--not space. Seven\nyears ago we got a man out of East Berlin. He was almost dead, but he\nlived long enough to record on tape some amazing data, so wild it was\nalmost dismissed as the ravings of delirium. But that was after Sputnik,\nand we didn't dare disregard any hints from the other side of the Iron\nCurtain. So the recording was turned over to our scientists, who proved\nit had a core of truth.\n\n\"Time travel has been written up in fiction; it has been discussed\notherwise as an impossibility. Then we discover that the Reds have it\nworking----\"\n\n\"You mean, they go into the future and bring back machines to use now.\"\n\nThe major shook his head. \"Not the future, the past.\"\n\nWas this an elaborate joke? Somewhat heatedly Ross snapped out the\nanswer to that. \"Look here, I know I haven't the education of your big\nbrains, but I do know that the farther back you go into history the\nsimpler things are. We ride in cars; only a hundred years ago men drove\nhorses. We have guns; go back a little and you'll find them waving\nswords and shooting guys with bows and arrows--those that don't wear tin\nplate on them to stop being punctured----\"\n\n\"Only they were, after all,\" commented Ashe. \"Look at Agincourt, m'lad,\nand remember what arrows did to the French knights in armor.\"\n\nRoss disregarded the interruption. \"Anyway\"--he stuck doggedly to his\npoint--\"the farther back you go, the simpler things are. How are the\nReds going to find anything in history we can't beat today?\"\n\n\"That is a point which has baffled us for several years now,\" the major\nreturned. \"Only it is not _how_ they are going to find it, but _where_.\nBecause somewhere in the past of this world they have contacted a\ncivilization able to produce weapons and ideas so advanced as to baffle\nour experts. We have to find that source and either mine it ourselves or\nclose it off. As yet we're still trying to find it.\"\n\nRoss shook his head. \"It must be a long way back. Those guys who\ndiscover tombs and dig up old cities--couldn't they give you some hints?\nWouldn't a civilization like that have left something we could find\ntoday?\"\n\n\"It depends,\" Ashe remarked, \"upon the type of civilization. The\nEgyptians built in stone, grandly. They used tools and weapons of\ncopper, bronze, and stone, and they were considerate enough to operate\nin a dry climate which preserved relics well. The cities of the Fertile\nCrescent built in mud brick and used stone, copper, and bronze tools.\nThey also chose a portion of the world where climate was a factor in\nkeeping their memory green.\n\n\"The Greeks built in stone, wrote their books, kept their history to\nbequeath it to their successors, and so did the Romans. And on this side\nof the ocean the Incas, the Mayas, the unknown races before them, and\nthe Aztecs of Mexico all built in stone and worked in metal. And stone\nand metal survive. But what if there had been an early people who used\nplastics and brittle alloys, who had no desire to build permanent\nbuildings, whose tools and artifacts were meant to wear out quickly,\nperhaps for economic reasons? What would they leave us--considering,\nperhaps, that an ice age had intervened between their time and ours,\nwith glaciers to grind into dust what little they did possess?\n\n\"There is evidence that the poles of our world have changed and that\nthis northern region was once close to being tropical. Any catastrophe\nviolent enough to bring about a switch in the poles of this planet might\nwell have wiped out all traces of a civilization, no matter how\nsuperior. We have good reason to believe that such a people must have\nexisted, but we must find them.\n\n\"And Ashe is a convert from the skeptics--\" the major slipped down from\nhis perch on the wall shelf--\"he is an archaeologist, one of your tomb\ndiscoverers, and knows what he is talking about. We must do our hunting\nin time earlier than the first pyramid, earlier than the first group of\nfarmers who settled by the Tigris River. But we have to let the enemy\nguide us to it. That's where you come in.\"\n\n\"Why me?\"\n\n\"That is a question to which our psychologists are still trying to find\nthe answer, my young friend. It seems that the majority of the people of\nthe several nations linked together in this project have become too\ncivilized. The reactions of most men to given sets of circumstances have\nbecome set in regular patterns and they cannot break that conditioning,\nor if personal danger forces them to change those patterns, they are\nafterward so adrift they cannot function at their highest potential.\nTeach a man to kill, as in war, and then you have to recondition him\nlater.\n\n\"But during these same wars we also develop another type. He is the born\ncommando, the secret agent, the expendable man who lives on action.\nThere are not many of this kind, and they are potent weapons. In\npeacetime that particular collection of emotions, nerve, and skills\nbecomes a menace to the very society he has fought to preserve during a\nwar. He is pressured by the peaceful environment into becoming a\ncriminal or a misfit.\n\n\"The men we send out from here to explore the past are not only given\nthe best training we can possibly supply for them, but they are all of\nthe type once heralded as the frontiersman. History is sentimental about\nthat type--when he is safely dead--but the present finds him difficult\nto live with. Our time agents are misfits in the modern world because\ntheir inherited abilities are born out of season now. They must be young\nenough and possess a certain brand of intelligence to take the stiff\ntraining and to adapt, and they must pass our tests. Do you understand?\"\n\nRoss nodded. \"You want crooks because they are crooks----\"\n\n\"No, not because they are crooks, but because they are misfits in their\ntime and place. Don't, I beg of you, Murdock, think that we are\noperating a penal institution here. You would never have been recruited\nif you hadn't tested out to suit us. But the man who may be labeled\nmurderer in his own period might rank as a hero in another, an extreme\nexample, but true. When we train a man he not only can survive in the\nperiod to which he is sent, but he can also pass as a native born in\nthat era----\"\n\n\"What about Hardy?\"\n\nThe major gazed into space. \"There is no operation which is foolproof.\nWe have never said that we don't run into trouble or that there is no\ndanger in this. We have to deal with both natives of different times,\nand if we are lucky and hit a hot run, with the Reds. They suspect that\nwe are casting about, hunting their trail. They managed to plant Kurt\nVogel on us. He had an almost perfect cover and conditioning. Now you\nhave it straight, Murdock. You satisfy our tests, and you'll be given a\nchance to say yes or no before your first run. If you say no and refuse\nduty, it means you must become an exile and stay here. No man who has\ngone through our training can return to normal life; there is too much\nchance of his being picked up and sweated by the opposition.\"\n\n\"Never?\"\n\nThe major shrugged. \"This may be a long-term operation. We hope not, but\nthere is no way of telling now. You will be in exile until we either\nfind what we want or fail entirely. That is the last card I have to lay\non the table.\" He stretched. \"You're slated for training tomorrow. Think\nit over and then let us know your answer when the time comes. Meanwhile,\nyou are to be teamed with Ashe, who will see to putting you through the\ncourse.\"\n\nIt was a big hunk to swallow, but once down, Ross found it digestible.\nThe training opened up a whole new world to him. Judo and wrestling were\neasy enough to absorb, and he thoroughly enjoyed the workouts. But the\npatient hours of archery practice, the strict instruction in the use of\na long-bladed bronze dagger were more demanding. The mastering of one\nnew language and then another, the intensive drill in unfamiliar social\ncustoms, the memorizing of strict taboos and ethics were difficult. Ross\nlearned to keep records in knots on hide thongs and was inducted into\nthe art of primitive bargaining and trade. He came to understand the\nworth of a cross-shaped tin ingot compared to a string of amber beads\nand some well-cured white furs. He now understood why he had been shown\na traders' caravan during that first encounter with the purpose behind\nOperation Retrograde.\n\nDuring the training days his feeling toward Ashe changed materially. A\nman could not work so closely with another and continue to resent his\nattitude; either he blew up entirely, or he learned to adjust. His awe\nat Ashe's vast amount of practical knowledge, freely offered to serve\nhis own blundering ignorance, created a respect for the man which might\nhave become friendship, had Ashe ever relaxed his own shield of\nimpersonal efficiency. Ross did not try to breach the barrier between\nthem mainly because he was sure that the reason for it was the fact\nthat he was a \"volunteer.\" It gave him an odd new feeling he avoided\ntrying to analyze. He had always had a kind of pride in his record; now\nhe had begun to wish sometimes that it was a record of a different type.\n\nMen came and went. Hodaki and his partner disappeared, as did Jansen and\nhis. One lost track of time within that underground warren which was the\nbase. Ross gradually discovered that the whole establishment covered a\nlarge area under an external crust of ice and snow. There were\nlaboratories, a well-appointed hospital, armories which stocked weapons\nusually seen only in museums, but which here were free of any signs of\nage, and ready for use. There were libraries with mile upon mile of tape\nrecordings as well as films. Ross could not understand everything he\nheard and saw, but he soaked up all he could so that once or twice, when\ndrifting off to sleep at night, he thought of himself as a sponge which\nhad nearly reached its total limit of absorption.\n\nHe learned to wear naturally the clumsy kilt-tunic he had seen on the\nwolf slayer, to shave with practiced assurance, using a leaf-shaped\nbronze razor, to eat strange food until he relished the taste. Making\nlesson time serve a double duty, he lay under sunlamps while listening\nto tape recordings, until his skin darkened to a weathered hue\nresembling Ashe's. There was always talk to listen to, important talk\nwhich he was afraid to miss.\n\n\"Bronze.\" Ashe weighed a dagger in his hand one day. Its hilt, made of\ndark horn studded with an intricate pattern of tiny golden nail heads,\nhad a gleam not unlike that of the blade. \"Do you know, Murdock, that\nbronze can be tougher than steel? If it wasn't that iron is so much more\nplentiful and easier to work, we might never have come out of the Bronze\nAge? Iron is cheaper and easier found, and when the first smith learned\nto work it, an end came to one way of life, a beginning to another.\n\n\"Yes, bronze is important to us here, and so are the men who worked it.\nSmiths were sacred in the old days. We know that they made a secret of\ntheir trade which overrode the bounds of district, tribe, and race. A\nsmith was welcome in any village, his person safe on the road. In fact,\nthe roads themselves were under the protection of the gods; there was\npeace on them for all wayfarers. The land was wide then, and it was\nempty. The tribes were few and small, and there was plenty of room for\nthe hunter, the farmer, the trader. Life was not such a scramble of man\nagainst man, but rather of man against nature----\"\n\n\"No wars?\" asked Ross. \"Then why the bow-and-dagger drill?\"\n\n\"Wars were small affairs, disputes between family clans or tribes. As\nfor the bow, there were formidable things in the forests--giant animals,\nwolves, wild boars----\"\n\n\"Cave bears?\"\n\nAshe sighed with weary patience. \"Get it through your head, Murdock,\nthat history is much longer than you seem to think. Cave bears and the\nuse of bronze weapons do not overlap. No, you will have to go back maybe\nseveral thousand years earlier and then hunt your bear with a\nflint-tipped spear in your hand if you are fool enough to try it.\"\n\n\"Or take a rifle with you.\" Ross made a suggestion he had longed to\nvoice for some time.\n\nAshe rounded on him swiftly, and Ross knew him well enough now to\nrealize that he was seriously displeased.\n\n\"That is just what you don't do, Murdock, not from this base, as you\nwell know by now. You take no weapon from here which is not designed for\nthe period in which your run lies. Just as you do not become embroiled\nwhile on that run in any action which might influence the course of\nhistory.\"\n\nRoss went on polishing the blade he held. \"What would happen if someone\ndid break that rule?\"\n\nAshe put down the dagger he had been playing with. \"We don't know--we\njust don't know. So far we have operated in the fringe territory,\nkeeping away from any district with a history which we can trace\naccurately. Maybe some day--\" his eyes were on a wall of weapon racks he\nplainly did not see--\"maybe some day we can stand and watch the rise of\nthe pyramids, witness the march of Alexander's armies.... But not yet.\nWe stay away from history, and we are sure that the Reds are doing the\nsame. It has become the old problem once presented by the atom bomb.\nNobody wants to upset the balance and take the consequences. Let us find\ntheir outpost and we'll withdraw our men from all the other runs at\nonce.\"\n\n\"What makes everyone so sure that they have an outpost somewhere?\nCouldn't they be working right at the main source, sir?\"\n\n\"They could, but for some reason they are not. As for how we know that\nmuch, it's information received.\" Ashe smiled thinly. \"No, the source is\nmuch farther back in time than their halfway post. But if we find that,\nthen we can trail them. So we plant men in suitable eras and hope for\nthe best. That's a good weapon you have there, Murdock. Are you willing\nto wear it in earnest?\"\n\nThe inflection in that question caught Ross's full attention. His gray\neyes met those blue ones. This was it--at long last.\n\n\"Right away?\"\n\nAshe picked up a belt of bronze plates strung together with chains, a\ntwin to that Ross had seen worn by the wolf slayer. He held it out to\nthe younger man. \"You can take your trial run any time--tomorrow.\"\n\nRoss drew a deeper breath. \"Where--to when?\"\n\n\"An island which will later be Britain. When? About two thousand B.C.\nBeaker traders were beginning to open their stations there. This is your\ngraduation exercise, Murdock.\"\n\nRoss fitted the blade he had been polishing into the wooden sheath on\nthe belt. \"If you say I can do it, I'm willing to try.\"\n\nHe caught that glance Ashe shot at him, but he could not read its\nmeaning. Annoyance? Impatience? He was still puzzling over it when the\nother turned abruptly and left him alone.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5\n\n\nHe might have said yes, but that didn't mean, Ross discovered, that he\nwas to be shipped off at once to early Britain. Ashe's \"tomorrow\" proved\nto be several days later. The cover was that of a Beaker trader, and\nRoss's impersonation was checked again and again by experts, making sure\nthat the last detail was correct and that no suspicion of a tribesman,\nno mistake on Ross's part would betray him.\n\nThe Beaker people were an excellent choice for infiltration. They were\nnot a closely knit clan, suspicious of strangers and alert to any\ndeviation from the norm, as more race-conscious tribes might be. For\nthey lived by trade, leaving to Ross's own time the mark of their\nfar-flung \"empire\" in the beakers found in graves scattered in clusters\nof a handful or so from the Rhineland to Spain, and from the Balkans to\nBritain.\n\nThey did not depend only upon the taboo of the trade road for their\nsafety, for the Beakermen were master bowmen. A roving people, they\npushed into new territory to establish posts, living amicably among\npeoples with far different customs--the Downs farmers, horse herders,\nshore-side fisherfolk.\n\nWith Ashe, Ross passed a last inspection. Their hair had not grown long\nenough to require braiding, but they did have enough to hold it back\nfrom their faces with hide headbands. The kilt-tunics of coarse\nmaterial, duplicating samples brought from the past, were harsh to the\nskin and poorly fitting. But the workmanship of their link-and-plate\nbronze belts, the sleek bow guards strapped to their wrists, and the\nbows themselves approached fine art. Ashe's round cloak was the blue of\na master trader, and he wore wealth in a necklace of polished wolf's\nteeth alternating with amber beads. Ross's more modest position in the\ntribe was indicated not only by his red-brown cloak, but by the fact\nthat his personal jewelry consisted only of a copper bracelet and a\ncloak pin with a jet head.\n\nHe had no idea how the time transition was to be made, nor how one might\nstep from the polar regions of the Western Hemisphere to the island of\nBritain lying off the Eastern. And it was a complicated business as he\ndiscovered.\n\nThe transition itself was a fairly simple, though disturbing, process.\nOne walked a short corridor and stood for an instant on a plate while\nthe light centered there curled about in a solid core, shutting one off\nfrom floor and wall. Ross gasped for breath as the air was sucked out of\nhis lungs. He experienced a moment of deathly sickness with the\nsensation of being lost in nothingness. Then he breathed again and\nlooked through the dying wall of light to where Ashe waited.\n\nQuick and easy as the trip through time had been, the journey to Britain\nwas something else. There could be only one transfer point if the secret\nwas to be preserved. But men from that point must be moved swiftly and\nsecretly to their appointed stations. Ross, knowing the strict rules\nconcerning the transportation of objects from one time to another,\nwondered how that travel could be effected. After all, they could not\nspend months, or even years, getting across continents and seas.\n\nThe answer was ingenious. Three days after they had stepped through the\nbarrier of time at the outpost, Ross and Ashe balanced on the rounded\nback of a whale. It was a whale which would deceive anyone who did not\ntest its hide with a harpoon, and whalers with harpoons large enough to\ntrouble such a monster were yet well in the future.\n\nAshe slid a dugout into the water, and Ross climbed into that unsteady\ncraft, holding it against the side of the disguised sub until his\npartner joined him. The day, misty and drizzling, made the shore they\naimed for a half-seen line across the water. With a shiver born of more\nthan cold, Ross dipped his paddle and helped Ashe send their crude boat\ntoward that half-hidden strip of land.\n\nThere was no real dawn; the sky lightened somewhat, but the drizzle\ncontinued. Green patches showed among the winter-denuded trees back from\nthe beach, but the countryside facing them gave an impression of untamed\nwilderness. Ross knew from his briefing that the whole of Britain was as\nyet only sparsely settled. The first wave of hunter-fishers to establish\nvillages had been joined by other invaders who built massive tombs and\nhad an elaborate religion. Small village-forts had been linked from hill\nto hill by trackways. There were \"factories,\" which turned out in bulk\nsuch fine flint weapons and tools that a thriving industry was in full\noperation, not yet having been superseded by the metal imported by the\nBeaker merchants. Bronze was still so rare and costly that only the head\nman of a village could hope to own one of the long daggers. Even the\narrowheads in Ross's quiver were chipped of flint.\n\nThey drew the dugout well up onto the shore and ran it into a shallow\ndepression in the bank, heaping stones and brush about for its\nconcealment. Then Ashe intently surveyed the surrounding country,\nseeking a landmark.\n\n\"Inland from here....\" Ashe used the language of the Beakermen, and Ross\nknew that from now on he must not only live as a trader, but also think\nas one. All other memories must be buried under the false one he had\nlearned; he must be interested in the present rate of exchange and the\nchance for profit. The two men were on their way to Outpost Gog, where\nAshe's first partner, the redoubtable Sanford, was playing his role so\nwell.\n\nThe rain squished in their hide boots, made sodden strings of their\ncloaks, plastered their woven caps to their thick mats of hair. Yet Ashe\nbore steadily on across the land with the certainty of one following a\nmarked trail. His self-confidence was rewarded within the first half\nmile when they came out upon one of the link trackways, its beaten\nsurface testifying to constant use.\n\nHere Ashe turned eastward, stepping up the pace to a ground-covering\ntrot. The peace of the road held--at least by day. By night only the\nmost hardened and desperate outlaws would brave the harmful spirits\nroving in the dark.\n\nAll the lore that had been pounded into him at the base began to make\nsome sense to Ross as he followed his guide, sniffing strange wet smells\nfrom the brush, the trees, and the damp earth; piecing together in his\nmind what he had been taught and what he now saw for himself, until it\nmade a tight pattern.\n\nThe track they were following sloped slightly upward, and a change in\nthe wind brought to them a sour odor, blanking out all normal scents.\nAshe halted so suddenly that Ross almost plowed into him. But he was\nalerted by the older man's attitude.\n\nSomething had been burned! Ross drew in a deep lungful of the smell and\nthen wished that he had not. It was wood--burned wood--and something\nelse. Since this was not possibly normal, he was prepared for the way\nAshe melted into cover in the brush.\n\nThey worked their way, sometimes crawling on their bellies, through the\nwet stands of dead grass, taking full advantage of all cover. They\ncrouched at the top of the hill while Ashe parted the prickly branches\nof an evergreen bush to make them a window.\n\nThe black patch left by the fire, which had come from a ruin above, had\nspread downhill on the opposite side of the valley. Charred posts still\nstood like lone teeth in a skull to mark what must have once been one of\nthe stockade walls of a post. But all they now guarded was a desolation\nfrom which came that overpowering stench.\n\n\"Our post?\" Ross asked in a whisper.\n\nAshe nodded. He was studying the scene with an intent absorption which,\nRoss knew, would impress every important detail upon his mind. That the\nplace had been burned was clear from the first. But why and by whom was\na problem vital to the two lurking in the brush.\n\nIt took them almost an hour to cross the valley--an hour of hiding,\ncasting about, searching. They had made a complete circle of the\ndestroyed post and Ashe stood in the shadow of a copse, rubbing clots of\nmud from his hands and frowning up at the charred posts.\n\n\"They weren't rushed. Or if they were, the attackers covered their trail\nafterward--\" Ross ventured.\n\nThe older man shook his head. \"Tribesmen would not have muddled a trail\nif they had won. No, this was no regular attack. There have been no\nsigns of a war party coming or leaving.\"\n\n\"Then what?\" demanded Ross.\n\n\"Lightning for one thing--and we'd better hope it was that. Or--\"\nAshe's blue eyes were very cold and bleak, as cold and bleak as the\ncountryside about them.\n\n\"Or--?\" Ross dared to prompt him.\n\n\"Or we have made contact with the Reds in the wrong way!\"\n\nRoss's hand instinctively went to the dagger at his belt. Little help a\ndagger would be in an unequal struggle like this! They were only two in\na thin web of men strung out through centuries of time with orders to\nseek out that which did not fit properly into the pattern of the past:\nto locate the enemy wherever in history or prehistory he had gone to\nearth. Had the Reds been searching, too, and was this first disaster\ntheir victory?\n\nThe time traders had their evidence when they at last ventured into what\nhad been the heart of Outpost Gog. Ross, inexperienced as he was in such\nmatters, could not mistake the signs of the explosion. There was a\ncrater on the crown of the hill, and Ashe stood apart from it, eying the\nfragments about them--scorched wood, blackened stone.\n\n\"The Reds?\"\n\n\"It must have been. This damage was done by explosives.\"\n\nIt was clear why Outpost Gog could not report the disaster. The attack\nhad destroyed their one link with the post on this time level; the\nconcealed communicator had gone up with the blast.\n\n\"Eleven--\" Ashe's finger tapped on the ornate buckle of his wide belt.\n\"We have about ten days to stick it out,\" he added, \"and it seems we may\nbe able to use them to better advantage than just letting you learn how\nit feels to walk about some four thousand years before you were born. We\nhave to find out--if we can--what happened here and why!\"\n\nRoss gazed at the mess. \"Dig?\" he asked.\n\n\"Some digging is indicated.\"\n\nSo they dug. Finally, black with charcoal smudges and sick with the\nevidences of death they had chanced upon, they collapsed on the cleanest\nspot they could find.\n\n\"They must have hit at night,\" Ashe said slowly. \"Only at that time\nwould they find everyone here. Men don't trust a night filled with\nghosts, and our agents conform to local custom as usual. All of the post\npeople could be erased with one bomb at night.\"\n\nAll except two of them had been true Beaker traders, including women and\nchildren. No Beaker trading post was large, and this one was unusually\nsmall. The attacker had wiped out some twenty people, eighteen of them\ninnocent victims.\n\n\"How long ago?\" Ross wanted to know.\n\n\"Maybe two days. And this attack came without any warning, or Sandy\nwould have sent a message. He had no suspicions at all; his last reports\nwere all routine, which means that if they were on to him--and they must\nhave been, judging by the results--he was not even aware of it.\"\n\n\"What do we do now?\"\n\nAshe looked at him. \"We wash--no--\" he corrected himself--\"we don't! We\ngo to Nodren's village. We are frightened, grief-stricken. We have found\nour kinsmen dead under strange circumstances. We ask questions of one to\nwhom I am known as an inhabitant of this post.\"\n\nSo, covered with dirt, they walked along the trackway toward the\nneighboring village with a weariness they did not have to counterfeit.\n\nThe dog sighted or perhaps scented them first. It was a rough-coated\nbeast, showing its fangs with a wolflike ferocity. But it was smaller\nthan a wolf, and it barked between its warning snarls. Ashe brought his\nbow from beneath the shelter of his cloak and held it ready.\n\n\"Ho, one comes to speak with Nodren--Nodren of the Hill!\"\n\nOnly the dog snapped and snarled. Ashe rubbed his forearm across his\nface, the gesture of a weary and heartsick man, smearing the ash and\ngrime into an awesome mask.\n\n\"Who speaks to Nodren--?\" There was a different twist to the\npronunciation of some words, but Ross was able to understand.\n\n\"One who has hunted with him and feasted with him. The one who gave into\nhis hand the friendship gift of the ever-sharp knife. It is Assha of the\ntraders----\"\n\n\"Go far from us, man of ill luck. You who are hunted by the evil\nspirits.\" The last was a shrill cry.\n\nAshe remained where he was, facing into the bushes which hid the\ntribesman.\n\n\"Who speaks for Nodren yet not with the voice of Nodren?\" he demanded.\n\"This is Assha who asks. We have drunk blood together and faced the\nwhite wolf and the wild boar in their fury. Nodren lets not others speak\nfor him, for Nodren is a man and a chief!\"\n\n\"And you are cursed!\" A stone flew through the air, striking a rain pool\nand spattering mud on Ashe's boots. \"Go and take your evil with you!\"\n\n\"Is it from the hand of Nodren or Nodren's young men that doom came upon\nthose of my blood? Have war arrows passed between the place of the\ntraders and the town of Nodren? Is that why you hide in the shadows so\nthat I, Assha, cannot look upon the face of one who speaks boldly and\nthrows stones?\"\n\n\"No war arrows between us, trader. _We_ do not provoke the spirits of\nthe hills. No fire comes from the sky at night to eat us up with a noise\nof many thunders. Lurgha speaks in such thunders; Lurgha's hand smites\nwith such fire. You have the Wrath of Lurgha upon you, trader! Keep\naway from us lest Lurgha's wrath fall upon us also.\"\n\nLurgha was the local storm god, Ross recalled. The sound of thunder and\nfire coming out of the sky at night--the bomb! Perhaps the very method\nof attack on the post would defeat Ashe's attempt to learn anything from\nthese neighbors. The superstitions of the people would lead them to shun\nboth the site of the post and Ashe himself as cursed and taboo.\n\n\"If the Wrath of Lurgha had struck at Assha, would Assha still live to\nwalk upon this road?\" Ashe prodded the ground with the tip of his\nbowstave. \"Yet Assha walks, as you see him; Assha talks, as you hear\nhim. It is ridiculous to answer him with the nonsense of little\nchildren----\"\n\n\"Spirits so walk and talk to unlucky men,\" retorted the man in hiding.\n\"It may be the spirit of Assha who does so now--\"\n\nAshe made a sudden leap. There was a flurry of action behind the bush\nscreen and he reappeared, dragging into the gray light of the rainy day\na wriggling captive, whom he bumped without ceremony onto the beaten\nearth of the road.\n\nThe man was bearded, wearing his thick mop of black hair in a round\ntopknot secured by a hide loop. He wore a skin tunic, now in\nconsiderable disarray, which was held in place with a woven, tasseled\nbelt.\n\n\"Ho, so it is Lal of the Quick Tongue who speaks so loudly of spirits\nand the Wrath of Lurgha!\" Ashe studied his captive. \"Now, Lal, since you\nspeak for Nodren--which I believe will greatly surprise him--you will\ncontinue to tell me of this Wrath of Lurgha from the night skies and\nwhat has happened to Sanfra, who was my brother, and those others of my\nkin. I am Assha, and you know of the wrath of Assha and how it ate up\nTwist-tooth, the outlaw, when he came in with his evil men. The Wrath of\nLurgha is hot, but so too is the wrath of Assha.\" Ashe contorted his\nface in such a way that Lal squirmed and looked away. When the tribesman\nspoke, all his former authority and bluster had gone.\n\n\"Assha knows that I am as his dog. Let him not turn upon me his\nswift-cutting big knife, nor the arrows from his lightning bow. It was\nthe Wrath of Lurgha which smote the place on the hill, first the thunder\nof his fist meeting the earth, and then the fire which he breathed upon\nthose whom he would slay----\"\n\n\"And this you saw with your own eyes, Lal?\"\n\nThe shaggy head shook an emphatic negative. \"Assha knows that Lal is no\nchief who can stand and look upon the wonders of Lurgha's might and keep\nhis eyes in his head. Nodren himself saw this wonder----\"\n\n\"And if Lurgha came in the night, when all men keep to their homes and\nleave the outer world to the restless spirits, how did Nodren see his\ncoming?\"\n\nLal crouched lower to the ground, his eyes darting to the bushes and the\nfreedom they promised, then back to Ashe's firmly planted boots.\n\n\"I am not a chief, Assha. How could I know in what way or for what\nreason Nodren saw the coming of Lurgha----?\"\n\n\"Fool!\" A second voice, that of a woman, spat the word from the brush\nwhich fringed the roadway. \"Speak to Assha with a straight tongue. If he\nis a spirit, he will know that you do not tell him the truth. And if he\nhas been spared by Lurgha....\" She showed her wonderment with a hiss of\nindrawn breath.\n\nSo urged, Lal mumbled sullenly, \"It is said that there came a message\nfor one to witness the Wrath of Lurgha in its descent upon the\noutlanders so that Nodren and the men of Nodren would truly know that\nthe traders were cursed, and should be put to the spear should they\ncome here again----\"\n\n\"This message--how was it brought? Did the voice of Lurgha sound in\nNodren's ear alone, or came it by the tongue of some man?\"\n\n\"Ahee!\" Lal lay flat on the ground, his hands over his ears.\n\n\"Lal is a fool and fears his own shadow as it skips before him on a\nsunny day!\" Out of the bushes stepped a young woman, obviously of some\nimportance in her own group. Walking with a proud stride, her eyes\nboldly met Ashe's. A shining disk hung about her neck on a thong, and\nanother decorated the woven belt of her cloth tunic. Her hair was bound\nin a thread net fastened with jet pins.\n\n\"I greet Cassca, who is the First Sower.\" There was a formal note in\nAshe's voice. \"But why should Cassca hide from Assha?\"\n\n\"There has been death on your hill, Assha--\" she sniffed--\"you smell of\nit now--Lurgha's death. Those who come from that hill may well be some\nwho no longer walk in their bodies.\" Cassca placed her fingers\nmomentarily on Ashe's outstretched palm before she nodded. \"No spirit\nare you, Assha, for all know that a spirit is solid to the eye, but not\nto the touch. So it would seem that you were not burned up by Lurgha,\nafter all.\"\n\n\"This matter of a message from Lurgha--\" he prompted.\n\n\"It came out of the empty air in the hearing not only of Nodren, but\nalso of Hangor, Effar, and myself, Cassca. For we stood at that time\nnear the Old Place....\" She made a curious gesture with the fingers of\nher right hand. \"It will soon be the time of sowing, and though Lurgha\nbrings sun and rain to feed the grain, yet it is in the Great Mother\nthat the seed lies. Upon her business only women may go into the Inner\nCircle.\" She gestured again. \"But as we met to make the first sacrifice\nthere came music out of the air such as we have never heard, voices\nsinging like birds in a strange tongue.\" Her face assumed an awesome\nexpression. \"Afterward a voice said that Lurgha was angered with the\nhill of the men-from-afar and that in the night he would send his Wrath\nagainst them, and that Nodren must witness this thing so that he could\nsee what Lurgha did to those he would punish. So it was done by Nodren.\nAnd there was a sound in the air----\"\n\n\"What kind of a sound?\" Ashe asked quietly.\n\n\"Nodren said it was a hum and there was the dark shadow of Lurgha's bird\nbetween him and the stars. Then came the smiting of the hill with\nthunder and lightning, and Nodren fled, for the Wrath of Lurgha is a\nfearsome thing. Now do the people come to the Great Mother's Place with\nmany fine offerings that she may stand between them and that Wrath.\"\n\n\"Assha thanks Cassca, who is the handmaiden of the Great Mother. May the\nsowing prosper and the reaping be good this year!\" Ashe said finally,\nignoring Lal, who still groveled on the road.\n\n\"You go from this place, Assha?\" she asked. \"For though I stand under\nthe protecting hand of the Mother and so do not fear, yet there are\nothers who will raise their spears against you for the honor of Lurgha.\"\n\n\"We go, and again thanks be to you, Cassca.\"\n\nHe turned back the way they had come, and Ross fell in beside him as the\nwoman watched them out of sight.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6\n\n\n\"That bird of Lurgha's--\" said Ross, once they were out of sight of\nCassca and Lal, \"could it have been a plane?\"\n\n\"Sounds like it,\" snapped his companion. \"If the Reds have done their\nwork efficiently, and there's no reason to suppose otherwise, then there\nis no use in contacting either Dorhta's town or Munga's. The same\nannouncement concerning the Wrath of Lurgha was probably made there--to\ntheir good purpose, not ours.\"\n\n\"Cassca didn't seem to be overly impressed with Lurgha's curse, not as\nmuch as the man was.\"\n\n\"She is the closest thing to a priestess that this tribe knows, and she\nserves a goddess older and more powerful than Lurgha--the Mother Earth,\nthe Great Mother, goddess of fertility and growth. Nodren's people\nbelieve that unless Cassca performs her mysteries and sows part of the\nfirst field in the spring there won't be any harvest. Consequently, she\nis secure in her office and doesn't fear the Wrath of Lurgha too much.\nThese people are now changing from one type of worship to another, but\nsome of Cassca's beliefs will persist clear down to our day, taking on\nthe coating of 'magic' and a lot of other enameling along the way.\"\n\nAshe had been talking as a man talks to cover up furious thinking. Now\nhe paused again and turned toward the sea. \"We have to stick it out\nsomewhere until the sub comes to pick us up. We'll need shelter.\"\n\n\"Will the tribesmen be after us?\"\n\n\"They may well be. Let the right men get to talking up a holy\nextermination of those upon whom the Wrath of Lurgha has fallen and we\ncould be in for plenty of trouble. Some of those men are trained hunters\nand trackers, and the Reds may have planted an agent to report the\nreturn of anyone to our post. Just now we're about the most important\ntime travelers out, for we know the Reds have appeared on this line.\nThey must have a large post here, too, or they couldn't have sent a\nplane on that raid. You can't build a time transport large enough to\ntake through a considerable amount of material. Everything used by us in\nthis age has to be assembled on this side, and the use of all machines\nis limited to where they can not be seen by any natives. Luckily large\nsections of this world are mostly wilderness and unpopulated in the\nareas where we operate the base posts. So if the Reds have a plane, it\nwas put together here, and that means a big post somewhere.\" Again Ashe\nwas thinking aloud as he pushed ahead of Ross into the fringes of a\nwood. \"Sandy and I scouted this territory pretty well last spring. There\nis a cave about half a mile to the west; it will shelter us for\ntonight.\"\n\nAshe's plans would probably have been easily accomplished if the cave\nhad been unoccupied. Without incident they came down into a hollow\nthrough which trickled a small stream, its banks laced with a thin\nedging of ice. Under Ashe's direction Ross collected an armload of\nfirewood. He was no woodsman and his prolonged exposure to the chilling\ndrizzle made him eager for even the very rough shelter of a cave, so\neager that he plunged forward carelessly. His foot came down on a\nslippery patch of mud, sending him sprawling on his face. There was a\ngrowl, and a white bulk rushed him. The cloak, rucked up about his\nthroat and shoulders, then saved his life, for only stout cloth was\ncaught between those fangs.\n\nWith a startled cry, Ross rolled as he might have to escape a man's\nattack, struggling to unsheath his dagger. A white-hot flash of pain\nscored his upper arm. The breath was driven out of him as a fight raged\nover his prone body; he heard grunts, snarls, and was severely pommeled.\nThen he was free as the bodies broke away. Shaken, he got to his knees.\nA short distance away the fight was still in progress. He saw Ashe\nstraddle the body of a huge white wolf, his legs clamped about the\nanimal's haunches, his hooked arm under the beast's head, forcing it up\nand back while his dagger rose and sank twice in the underparts of the\nheaving body.\n\nRoss held his own weapon ready. He leaped from a half crouch, and his\ndagger sank cleanly home behind the short ribs. One of their blows must\nhave reached the animal's heart. With an almost human cry the wolf\nstiffened convulsively. Then it was still. Ashe squatted near it,\nmethodically driving his dagger into the moist soil to clean the blade.\n\nA red rivulet trickled down his thigh where the lower edge of his\nkilt-tunic had been ripped up to the link belt. He was breathing hard,\nbut otherwise he was as composed as always. \"These sometimes hunt in\npairs at this season,\" he observed. \"Be ready with your bow--\"\n\nRoss strung his with the cord he had been keeping dry within the breast\nfolds of his tunic. He fitted an arrow to the string, grateful to be a\npassable marksman. The slash on his arm smarted in protest as he moved,\nand he noted that Ashe did not try to get up.\n\n\"A bad one?\" Ross indicated the blood now thickening into a stream along\nAshe's thigh.\n\nAshe pulled away the torn tunic and exposed a nasty looking gash on the\noutside of his hip. He pressed his palm against the gaping wound and\nmotioned Ross to scout ahead. \"See if the cave is clear. We can't do\nanything until we know that.\"\n\nReluctantly Ross followed the stream until he found the cave, a\nsnug-looking place with an overhang to keep it dry. The unpleasant smell\nof a lair hung about its mouth. He chose a stone from the stream,\nchucked it into the dark opening, and waited. The stone rattled as it\nstruck an inner wall, but there was no other sound. A second stone from\na different angle followed the first, with the same results. Ross was\nnow certain that the cave was unoccupied. Once they were inside with a\nfire going at the entrance, they could hope to keep it free of\nintruders. A little heartened, he cast about a bit upstream and then\nturned back to where he had left Ashe.\n\n\"No male?\" the other greeted him. \"This is a female, and she was close\nto whelping--\" He nudged the white wolf with his toe. His hands held a\npad of rags against his hip, and his face was shaded with pain.\n\n\"Nothing in the cave anyway. Let's see about this....\" Ross laid aside\nthe bow and kneeled to examine Ashe's thigh wound. His own slash was\nmore of a smarting graze, but this tear was deep and ugly.\n\n\"Second plate--belt--\" Ashe got the words out between set teeth, and\nRoss clicked open the hidden recess in the other's bronze belt to bring\nout a small packet. Ashe made a wry face as he swallowed three of the\npills within. Ross mashed another pill onto the bandage he prepared,\nand when the last cumbersome fold was secure Ashe relaxed.\n\n\"Let us hope that works,\" he commented a little bleakly. \"Now come here\nwhere I can get my hands on you and let me see your scratch. Animal\nbites can be a nasty business.\"\n\nBandaged in turn, with the bitterness of the anti-septo pill on his\ntongue, Ross helped Ashe limp upstream to the cave. He left the older\nman outside while he cleaned up the floor of the cave and then made his\ncompanion as comfortable as he could on a bed of bracken. The fire Ross\nhad longed for was built. They stripped off their sodden clothing and\nhung it to dry. Ross wrapped a bird he had shot in clay and tucked it\nunder the hot coals to be roasted.\n\nThey had surely had bad luck, he thought, but they were now undercover,\nhad a fire, and food of a sort. His arm ached, sharp pain shooting from\nfingers to elbow when he moved it. Though Ashe made no complaint, Ross\ngauged that the older man's discomfort was far worse than his own, and\nhe carefully hid all signs of his own twinges.\n\nThey ate the bird, saltless, and with their fingers. Ross savored each\ngreasy bite, licking his hands clean afterward while Ashe lay back on\nthe improvised bed, his face gaunt in the half light of the fire.\n\n\"We are about five miles from the sea here. There is no way of raising\nour base now that Sandy's installation is gone. I'll have to lay up,\nsince I can't risk any more loss of blood. And you're not too good in\nthe woods--\"\n\nRoss accepted that valuation with a new humbleness. He was only too well\naware that if it had not been for Ashe, he and not the white wolf would\nhave died down in the valley. Yet a strange shyness kept him from trying\nto put his thanks into words. The only kind of amends he could make for\nthe other's hurt was to provide hands, feet, and strength for the man\nwho did know what to do and how to do it.\n\n\"We'll have to hunt--\" he ventured.\n\n\"Deer,\" Ashe caught him up. \"But the marsh at the mouth of this stream\nprovides a better hunting ground than inland. If the wolf laired here\nvery long, she has already frightened away any large game. It isn't the\nmatter of food which bothers me----\"\n\n\"It is being tied up here,\" Ross filled in for him with some daring.\n\"But look here, I'll take orders. This is your territory, and I'm green\nat the game. You tell me what to do, and I'll do it the best that I\ncan.\" He glanced up to find Ashe surveying him intently, but as usual\nthere was no readable expression on the other's brown face.\n\n\"The first thing to do is get the wolf's hide,\" Ashe said briskly. \"Then\nbury the carcass. You'd better drag it up here to work on it. If her\nmate is hanging around, he might try to jump you.\"\n\nWhy Ashe should think it necessary to acquire the wolf skin puzzled\nRoss, but he asked no questions. His skinning task took four times as\nlong and was far from being the neat job the shock-haired man of the\nrecord tape had accomplished. Ross had to wash himself off in the stream\nbefore piling stones over the corpse in temporary burial. When he pulled\nhis bloody burden back to the cave, Ashe lay with his eyes closed. Ross\nthankfully sat on his own pile of bracken and tried not to notice the\nthrobbing ache in his arm.\n\nHe must have fallen asleep, for when he roused it was to see Ashe crawl\nover to mend the dying fire from their store of wood. Ross, angry at\nhimself, beat the other to the task.\n\n\"Get back,\" he said roughly. \"This is my job. I didn't mean to fail.\"\n\nSurprisingly, Ashe settled back without a word, leaving Ross to sit by\nthe fire, a fire he was very glad to have a moment or so later when a\nwailing howl sounded down-wind. If this was not the white wolf's mate,\nthen it was another of her kin who prowled the upper reaches of the\nsmall valley.\n\nThe next day, having provided Ashe with a supply of firewood, Ross went\nto try his luck in the marsh. The thick drizzle which had hung over the\nland the day before was gone, and he faced a clear, bright morning,\nthough the breeze had an icy snap. But it was a good morning to be alive\nand out in the open, and Ross's spirits rose.\n\nHe tried to put to use all the woodlore he had learned at the base. But\nit was one thing to learn something academically and another to put that\nlearning into practice. He was uncomfortably certain that Ashe would not\nhave found his showing very good.\n\nThe marsh was a series of pools between rank growths of leafless willows\nand coarse tufts of grass, with hillocks of firmer soil rising like\nislands. Ross, approaching with caution, was glad of it, for from one of\nthose hillocks arose a trail of white smoke, and he saw a black blot\nwhich was probably a rude hut. Why one should choose to live in the\nmidst of such country he could not guess, though it might be merely the\ntemporary camp of some hunter.\n\nRoss also saw thousands of birds feeding greedily on the dried seed of\nthe marsh grasses, paddling in the pools, and setting up a clamor to\ndrive a man mad. They did not seem in the least disturbed by that\ndistant camper.\n\nRoss had reason to be proud of his marksmanship that morning. He had in\nhis quiver perhaps half a dozen of the lighter shafts made for shooting\nbirds. In place of the finely chipped and wickedly barbed flint points\nused for heavier game, these were tipped with needle-sharp, light bone\nheads. He had a string of four birds looped together by their feet\nwithin almost as many minutes. For the flocks rose in their first alarm\nonly to settle again to feast.\n\nThen he knocked over a hare--a fat giant of its race--that stared at him\nbrazenly from a tussock. The hare kicked back into a pool in its death\nstruggle, however, and Ross was forced to leave cover to retrieve its\nbody. But he was alert and he stood up, dagger out and ready, to greet\nthe man who parted the bushes to watch him.\n\nFor a long minute gray eyes stared into brown ones, and then Ross noted\nthe other's bedraggled and tattered dress. The kilt-tunic smudged with\nmud, scorched and charred along one edge, was styled like his own. The\nfellow wore his hair fastened back with a band, unlike the topknot of\nthe local tribesman.\n\nRoss, his dagger still ready, broke the silence first. \"I am a believer\nin the fire and the fashioned metal, the climbing sun, and the moving\nwater.\" He repeated the recognition speech of the Beakermen.\n\n\"The fire warms by the grace of Tulden, the metal is fashioned by the\nmystery of the smith, the sun climbs without our aid, and who can stop\nthe water from running?\" The stranger's voice was hoarse. Now that Ross\nhad time to examine him more closely he saw the dark bruise on his\nexposed shoulder, the raw red mark of a burn running across the man's\nbroad chest. He dared to test his surmise concerning the other.\n\n\"I am of the kin of Assha. We returned to the hill----\"\n\n\"Ashe!\"\n\nNot \"Assha\" but \"Ashe!\" Ross, though sure of that pronunciation, was\nstill cautious. \"You are from the hill place, where Lurgha smote with\nthunder and fire?\"\n\nThe man slid his long legs across the log which had been his shelter.\nThe burn across his chest was not his only brand, for Ross noticed\nanother red stripe, puffed and fiery looking, which swelled the calf of\none leg. The man studied Ross closely, and then his fingers moved in a\nsign which to the uninitiated native might have been one for the warding\noff of evil, but which to Ross was the \"thumbs up\" of his own age.\n\n\"Sanford?\"\n\nAt that name the man shook his head. \"McNeil,\" he named himself. \"Where\nis Ashe?\"\n\nHe might really be what he seemed, but on the other hand, he could be a\nRed spy. Ross had not forgotten Kurt. \"What happened?\" he parried one\nquestion with another.\n\n\"Bomb. The Reds must have spotted us, and we didn't have a chance. We\nweren't expecting any trouble. I'd been down to see about a missing\nburden donkey and was about halfway back up the hill when she hit. When\nI came to I was all the way down the hill with part of the fort on top\nof me. The rest.... Well, you saw the place, didn't you?\"\n\nRoss nodded. \"What are you doing here?\"\n\nMcNeil spread his hands in a tired little gesture. \"I tried to talk to\nNodren, but they stoned me away. I knew that Ashe was coming through and\nhoped to reach him when he hit the beach, but I was too late. Then I\nfigured he would pass here to make contact with the sub, so I was\nwaiting it out until I saw you. Where is Ashe?\"\n\nIt all sounded logical enough. Still, with Ashe injured, Ross was taking\nno chances. He pushed his dagger back into its sheath and picked up the\nhare. \"Stay here,\" he told McNeil, \"I'll be back----\"\n\n\"But--wait! Where's Ashe, you young fool? We have to get together.\"\n\nRoss went on. He was sure that the stranger was in no shape to race\nafter him, and he would lay a muddled trail before he returned to the\ncave valley. If this man was a Red plant, he would have to reckon with\none who had already met Kurt Vogel.\n\nThe laying of that muddled trail took time. It was past midday when Ross\ncame back to Ashe, who was sitting up by the mouth of the cave at the\nfire, using his dagger to fashion a crutch out of a length of sapling.\nHe surveyed Ross's burden with approval, but lost interest in the\npromise of food as soon as the other reported his meeting in the marsh.\n\n\"McNeil--chap with brown hair, brown eyes, a right eyebrow which quirks\nup toward his hairline when he smiles?\"\n\n\"Brown hair and eyes, okay--and he didn't smile any.\"\n\n\"Chip broken off a front tooth--upper right?\"\n\nRoss shut his eyes to visualize the stranger. Yes, there had been a\nsmall break on a front tooth. He nodded.\n\n\"That's McNeil. Not that you didn't do right not to bring him here\nwithout being sure. What made you so watchful? Kurt?\"\n\nAgain Ross nodded. \"And what you said about the Reds' planting someone\nhere to wait for us.\"\n\nAshe scratched the bristles on his chin. \"Never underrate them--we don't\ndare do that. But the man you met is McNeil, and we'd better get him\nhere. Can you bring him?\"\n\n\"I think he's able to get about, in spite of that leg. From his story\nhe's been stirring around.\"\n\nAshe bit absent-mindedly into a piece of hare and swore mildly when he\nburned his tongue. \"Odd that Cassca didn't tell us about him. Unless she\nthought there was no use causing trouble by admitting they had driven\nhim away. You going now?\"\n\nRoss moved around the fire. \"Might as well. He didn't look too\ncomfortable. And I'll bet he's hungry.\"\n\nHe took the direct route back to the marsh, but this time no thread of\nsmoke spiraled into the air. Ross hesitated. That shelter on the small\nisland was surely the place where McNeil had holed up. Should he try to\nwork his way out to it now? Or had something happened to the man while\nhe was gone?\n\nAgain that sixth sense of impending disaster, which is perhaps bred into\nsome men, alerted Ross. Why he turned suddenly and backed against a\nbushy willow, he could not have explained. However, because he did so\nthe loop of hide rope meant for his throat hit his shoulder harmlessly.\nIt fell to the ground, and he stamped one boot down on it. Then it was\nthe work of seconds to grasp it and give it a quick jerk. The surprised\nman who held the other end was brought sprawling into the open.\n\nRoss had seen that round face before. \"Lal of the town of Nodren.\" He\nfound words to greet the ropeman even as his knee came up against the\nfellow's jaw, jarring Lal so that he dropped a flint knife. Ross kicked\nit into the willows. \"What do you hunt here, Lal?\"\n\n\"Traders!\" The voice was weak, but it held heat.\n\nThe tribesman did not try to struggle against Ross's hold, and Ross,\ngripping him by the nape of the neck, moved through a screen of brush to\na hollow. Luckily there was no water cupped there, for McNeil lay in the\nbottom of that dip, his arms tied tightly behind him and his ankles\nlashed together with no thought for the pain of his burned leg.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 7\n\n\nRoss whirled the rope which had been meant to bring him down around Lal.\nHe lashed the tribesman's arms tight to his body before he knelt to cut\nloose his fellow time traveler. Lal now huddled against the far wall of\nthe cup, fear in every line of his small body. So apparent was this fear\nthat Ross felt no satisfaction at turning the tables on him. Instead he\nfelt increasingly uneasy.\n\n\"What is this all about?\" he asked McNeil as he stripped off his bonds\nand helped him up.\n\nMcNeil massaged his wrists, took a step or two, and grimaced with pain.\n\"Our friend seeks to be an obedient servant of Lurgha.\"\n\nRoss picked up his bow. \"The tribe is out to hunt us?\"\n\n\"Lurgha has ordered--out of thin air again--that any traders who escaped\nare to be brought in and introduced to him personally at the sacrifice\nfor the enrichment of the fields!\"\n\nThe old, old gift of blood and life at the spring sowing. Ross recalled\ngrisly details from his cram lessons. Any wandering stranger or enemy\ntribesman taken in a raid before that day would meet such a fate. On\nunlucky years when people were not available a deer or wolf might serve.\nBut the best sacrifice of all was a man. So Lurgha had decreed--from the\nair--that traders were his meat? What of Ashe? Let any hunter from the\nvillage track him down.\n\n\"We have to move fast,\" Ross told McNeil as he took up the rope which\nmade a leading cord for Lal. Ashe would want to question the tribesman\nabout this second order from Lurgha.\n\nImpatient as Ross was, he had to mend his pace to accommodate McNeil.\nThe man from the hill post was close to the end of his strength. He had\nstarted off bravely enough, but now he wavered. Ross sent Lal ahead with\na sharp push, ordering him to stay there, while he went to McNeil's aid.\nIt was well into the afternoon before they came up the stream and saw\nthe fire before the cave.\n\n\"Macna!\" Ashe hailed Ross's companion with the native version of his\nname. \"And Lal. But what do you here, Lal of Nodren's town?\"\n\n\"Mischief.\" Ross helped McNeil within the cave and to the pile of brush\nwhich was his own bed. \"He was hunting traders as a present for Lurgha.\"\n\n\"So--\" Ashe turned upon the tribesman--\"and by whose word did you go\nhunting my kinsman, Lal? Was it Nodren's? Has he forgotten the blood\nbond between us? For it was in the name of Lurgha himself that that bond\nwas made----\"\n\n\"Aaaah--\" The tribesman squatted down against the wall where Ross had\nshoved him. Unable to hide his head in his arms, he brought his face\ndown upon his knees so that only his shaggy topknot of hair was exposed.\nRoss realized, with stupefaction, that the little man was crying like a\nchild, his hunched shoulders rising and falling with the force of his\nsobs. \"Aaaah--\" he wailed.\n\nAshe allowed him a moment or two of noisy grief and then limped over to\ngrasp his topknot and pull up his head. Lal's eyes were screwed tightly\nshut, but there were tears on his cheeks, and his mouth twisted in\nanother wail.\n\n\"Be quiet!\" Ashe shook him, but not too harshly. \"Have you yet felt the\nbite of my sharp knife? Has an arrow holed your skin? You are alive, and\nyou could be dead. Show that you are glad you live and continue to\nbreathe by telling us what you know, Lal.\"\n\nThe woman Cassca had displayed a measure of intelligence and ease at\ntheir meeting upon the road. But it was very plain that Lal was of\ndifferent stuff, a simple man in whose head few ideas could find house\nroom at one time. And to him the present was all black. Little by little\nthey dragged the story out of him.\n\nLal was poor, so poor that he had never dared dream of owning for\nhimself some of the precious things the hill traders displayed to the\nwealthy of Nodren's town. But he was also a follower of the Great\nMother's, rather than one who made sacrifices to Lurgha. Lurgha was the\ngod for warriors and great men; he was too high to concern himself with\nsuch as Lal.\n\nSo when Nodren reported the end of the hill post under the storm fist of\nLurgha, Lal had been impressed only to a point. He was still convinced\nit was none of his concern, and instead he began thinking of the\ntreasures which might lie hidden in the destroyed buildings. It occurred\nto him that Lurgha's Wrath had been laid upon the men who had owned\nthem, but perhaps it would not stretch to the fine things themselves. So\nhe had gone secretly to the hill to explore.\n\nWhat he had seen there had utterly converted him to a belief in the fury\nof Lurgha and he had been frightened out of his simple wits, fleeing\nwithout making the search he had intended. But Lurgha had seen him\nthere, had read his impious thoughts....\n\nAt that point Ashe interrupted the stream of Lal's story. How had Lurgha\nseen Lal?\n\nBecause--Lal shuddered, began to cry again, and spoke the next few\nsentences haltingly--that very morning when he had gone out to hunt wild\nfowl in the marshes Lurgha had spoken to _him_, to Lal, who was less\nthan a flea creeping upon a worn-out fur rug.\n\nAnd how had Lurgha spoken? Ashe's voice was softer, gentle.\n\nOut of the air, even as he had spoken to Nodren, who was a chief. He\nsaid that he had seen Lal in the hill post, and so Lal was his meat. But\nnot yet would he eat him, not if Lal served him in other ways. And he,\nLal, had lain flat on the ground before the bodiless voice of Lurgha and\nhad sworn that he would serve Lurgha to the end of his life.\n\nThen Lurgha had told him to hunt down one of the evil traders who was\nhiding in the marshes, and bind him with ropes. Then he was to call the\nmen of the village and together they would carry the prisoner to the\nhill where Lurgha had loosed his wrath, and there they would leave him.\nLater they might return and take what they found there and use it to\nbless the fields at sowing time, and all would be well with Nodren's\nvillage. And Lal had sworn that he would do as Lurgha bade, but now he\ncould not. So Lurgha would eat him up--he was a man without hope.\n\n\"Yet,\" Ashe said even more gently, \"have you not served the Great Mother\nall these years, giving to her a portion of the first fruits even when\nthe yield of your one field was small?\"\n\nLal stared at him, his woebegone face still smeared with tears. It took\na second or two for the question to penetrate his fear-clouded mind.\nThen he nodded timidly.\n\n\"Has she not dealt with you well in return, Lal? You are a poor man,\nthat is true. But you are not gaunt of belly, even though this is the\nthin season when men fast before the coming of the new harvest. The\nGreat Mother watches over her own. And it is she who has brought you to\nus now. For this I say to you, Lal, and I, Assha of the traders, speak\nwith a straight tongue. The Lurgha who struck our post, who spoke to you\nfrom the air, means you no good----\"\n\n\"Aaaah!\" wailed Lal. \"So do I know, Assha. He is of the blackness and\nthe wandering spirits of the dark!\"\n\n\"Just so. Thus he is no kin to the mother, for she is of the light and\nof good things, of the new grain, and the newborn lambs for your flocks,\nof the maids who wed with men and bring forth sons to lift their\nfathers' spears, daughters to spin by the hearth and sow the yellow\ngrain in the furrows. Lurgha's quarrel lies with us, Lal, not with\nNodren nor with you. And we take upon us that quarrel.\" He limped into\nthe outer air where the shadows of evening were beginning to creep\nacross the ground.\n\n\"Hear me, Lurgha,\" he called into the coming night, \"I am Assha of the\ntraders, and upon myself I take your hate. Not upon Lal, nor upon\nNodren, nor upon the people who live in Nodren's town, shall your wrath\nlie. Thus do I say it!\"\n\nRoss, noticing that Ashe concealed from Lal a wave of his hand, was\nprepared for some display meant to impress the tribesman. It came in a\nspectacular burst of green fire beyond the stream. Lal wailed again, but\nwhen that fire was followed by no other manifestation he ventured to\nraise his head once more.\n\n\"You have seen how Lurgha answered me, Lal. Toward me only will his\nwrath be turned. Now--\" Ashe limped back and dragged out the white wolf\nskin, dropping it before Lal--\"this you will give to Cassca that she may\nmake a curtain for the Mother's home. See, it is white and so rare that\nthe Mother will be pleased with such a fine gift. And you will tell her\nall that has chanced and how you believe in her powers over the powers\nof Lurgha, and the Mother will be well pleased with you. But you shall\nsay nothing to the men of the village, for this quarrel is between\nLurgha and Assha now and not for the meddling of others.\"\n\nHe unfastened the rope which bound Lal's arms. Lal reached out a hand to\nthe wolf skin, his eyes filled with wonderment. \"This is a fine thing\nyou give me, Assha, and the Mother will be pleased, for in many years\nshe has not had such a curtain for her secret place. Also, I am but a\nlittle man; the quarrels of great ones are not for me. Since Lurgha has\naccepted your words this is none of my affair. Yet I will not go back to\nthe village for a while--with your permission, Assha. For I am a man of\nloose and wagging tongue and oftentimes I speak what I do not really\nwish to say. So if I am asked questions, I answer. If I am not there to\nbe asked such questions, I cannot answer.\"\n\nMcNeil laughed, and Ashe smiled. \"Well enough, Lal. Perhaps you are a\nwiser man than you think. But also I do not believe you should stay\nhere.\"\n\nThe tribesman was already nodding. \"That do I say, too, Assha. You are\nnow facing the Wrath of Lurgha, and with that I wish no part. Thus I\nshall go into the marsh for a while. There are birds and hares to hunt,\nand I shall work upon this fine skin so that when I take it to the\nMother it shall indeed be a gift worth her smiles. Now, Assha, I would\ngo before the night comes if it pleases you.\"\n\n\"Go with good fortune, Lal.\" Ashe stood apart while the tribesman ducked\nhis head in a shy, awkward farewell to the others, pattering out into\nthe valley.\n\n\"What if they pick him up?\" McNeil asked wearily.\n\n\"I don't think they can,\" Ashe returned. \"And what would you do--keep\nhim here? If we tried that, he'd scheme to escape and try to turn the\ntables on us. Now he'll keep away from Nodren's village and out of sight\nfor the time being. Lal's not too bright in some ways, but he's a good\nhunter. If he has reason for hiding out, it'll take a better hunter to\ntrack him. At least we know now that the Reds are afraid they did not\nmake a clean sweep here. What happened, McNeil?\"\n\nWhile he was telling his story in more detail both Ashe and Ross worked\non his burns, making him comfortable. Then Ashe sat back as Ross\nprepared food.\n\n\"How did they spot the post?\" Ashe rubbed his chin and frowned at the\nfire.\n\n\"Only way I can guess is that they picked up our post signal and\npinpointed the source. That means they must have been hunting us for\nsome time.\"\n\n\"No strangers about lately?\"\n\nMcNeil shook his head. \"Our cover wasn't broken that way. Sanford was a\nwonder. If I hadn't known better, I would have sworn he was born one of\nthe Beaker folk. He had a network of informants running all the way from\nhere into Brittany. Amazing how he was able to work without arousing any\nsuspicions. I suppose his being a member of the smiths' guild was a big\nhelp. He could pick up a lot of news from any village where there was\none at work. And I tell you,\" McNeil propped himself up on his elbow to\nexclaim more vehemently--\"there wasn't a whisper of trouble from here\nclear across the channel and pretty far to the north. We were already\nsure the south was clean before we ever took cover as Beakers,\nespecially since their clans are thick in Spain.\"\n\nAshe chewed a broiled wing reflectively. \"Their permanent base with the\ntransport _has_ to be somewhere within the bounds of the territory they\nhold in our own time.\"\n\n\"They could plant it in Siberia and laugh at us,\" McNeil exploded. \"No\nhope of our getting in there----\"\n\n\"No.\" Ashe threw the stripped bone into the fire and licked grease from\nhis fingers. \"Then they would be faced with the old problem of distance.\nIf what they are exploiting lay within their modern boundaries, we would\nnever have tumbled to the thing in the first place. What the Reds want\nmust lie outside their twentieth century holdings, a slender point in\nour favor. Therefore they will plant their shift point as close to it as\nthey can. Our transportation problem is more difficult than theirs will\never be.\n\n\"You know why we chose the arctic for our base; it lies in a section of\nthe world never populated by other than roving hunters. But I'll wager\nanything you want to name that their point is somewhere in Europe where\nthey have people to contend with. If they are using a plane, they can't\nrisk its being seen----\"\n\n\"I don't see why not,\" Ross broke in. \"These people couldn't possibly\nknow what it was--Lurgha's bird--magic--\"\n\nAshe shook his head. \"They must have the interference-with-history worry\nas much as we have. Anything of our own time has to be hidden or\ndisguised in such a way that the native who may stumble upon it will\nnever know it is man-made. Our sub is a whale to all appearances.\nPossibly their plane is a bird, but neither can bear too close an\nexamination. We don't know what could result from a leak of real\nknowledge in this or any primitive time ... how it might change\nhistory----\"\n\n\"But,\" Ross advanced what he believed to be the best argument against\nthat reasoning, \"suppose I handed Lal a gun and taught him to use it. He\ncouldn't duplicate the weapon--the technology required lies so far\nbeyond this age. These people couldn't reproduce such a thing.\"\n\n\"True enough. On the other hand, don't belittle the ingenuity of the\nsmiths or the native intelligence of men in any era. These tribesmen\nmight not be able to reproduce your gun, but it would set them thinking\nalong new lines. We might find that they would think our time right out\nof being. No, we dare not play tricks with the past. This is the same\nsituation we faced immediately after the discovery of the atom bomb.\nEverybody raced to produce that new weapon and then sat around and\nshivered for fear we'd be crazy enough to use it on each other.\n\n\"The Reds have made new discoveries which we have to match, or we will\ngo under. But back in time we have to be careful, both of us, or perhaps\ndestroy the world we do live in.\"\n\n\"What do we do now?\" McNeil wanted to know.\n\n\"Murdock and I came here only for a trial run. It's his test. The sub is\nto call for us about nine days from now.\"\n\n\"So if we sit tight--if we _can_ sit tight--\" McNeil lay down\nagain--\"they will take us out. Meanwhile we have nine days.\"\n\nThey spent three more days in the cave. McNeil was on his feet and\nimpatient to leave before Ashe was able to hobble well enough to travel.\nThough Ross and McNeil took turns at hunting and guard duty, they saw no\nsigns that the tribesmen were tracking them. Apparently Lal had done as\nhe promised, withdrawing to the marsh and hiding there apart from his\npeople.\n\nIn the gray of pre-dawn on the fourth day Ashe wakened Ross. Their fire\nhad been buried with earth, and already the cave seemed bleak. They ate\nvenison roasted the night before and went out into the chill of a fog. A\nlittle way down the valley McNeil joined them out of the mist from his\nguard post. Keeping their pace to one which favored Ashe's healing\nwound, they made their way inland in the direction of the track linking\nthe villages.\n\nCrossing that road they continued northward, the land beginning to rise\nunder them. Far away they heard the blatting of sheep, the bark of a\ndog. In the fog, Ross stumbled in a shallow ditch beyond which lay a\nstubbled field. Ashe paused to look about him, his nostrils expanding as\nif he were a hound smelling out their trail.\n\nThe three went on, crossing a whole series of small, irregular fields.\nRoss was sure that the yield from any of these cleared strips must be\nscanty. The fog was thickening. Ashe pressed the pace, using his\nhandmade crutch carefully. He gave an audible sigh of relief when they\nwere faced at last by two stone monoliths rising like pillars. A third\nstone lay across them, forming a rude arch through which they saw a\nnarrow valley running back into the hills.\n\nThrough the fog Ross could sense the eerie strangeness of the valley\nbeyond the massive gate. He would have said that he was not\nsuperstitious, that he had merely studied these tribal beliefs as\nlessons; he had not accepted them. Yet now, if he had been alone, he\nwould have avoided that place and turned aside from the valley, for that\nwhich waited within was not for him. To his secret relief Ashe paused by\nthe arch to wait.\n\nThe older man gestured the other two into cover. Ross obeyed willingly,\nthough the dank drops of condensing fog dripped on his cloak and wet his\nface as he brushed against prickly-leafed shrubs. Here were walls of\nevergreen plants and dwarfed pines almost as if this tunnel of\nyear-round greenery had been planted with some purpose in mind. Once his\ncompanions had concealed themselves, Ashe called, shrill but sweetly,\nwith a bird's rising notes. Three times he made that sound before a\nfigure moved in the fog, the rough gray-white of its long cloak melting\nin the wisps of mist.\n\nDown that green tunnel, out of the heart of the valley, the other came,\na loop of cloak concealing the entire figure. It halted right in back of\nthe arch and Ashe, making a gesture to the others to stay where they\nwere, faced the muffled stranger.\n\n\"Hands and feet of the Mother, she who sows what may be reaped----\"\n\n\"Outland stranger who is under the Wrath of Lurgha,\" the other mocked\nhim in the voice of Cassca. \"What do you want, outlander, that you dare\nto come here where no man may enter?\"\n\n\"That which you know. For on the night when Lurgha came you also\nsaw----\"\n\nRoss heard the hiss of a sharply drawn breath. \"How knew you that,\noutlander?\"\n\n\"Because you serve the Mother and you are jealous for her and her\nservice. If Lurgha is a mighty god, you wanted to see his acts with your\nown eyes.\"\n\nWhen she finally answered, there was anger as well as frustration in her\nvoice. \"And you know of my shame then, Assha. For Lurgha came--on a bird\nhe came, and he did even as he said he would. So now the village will\nmake offerings to Lurgha and beg his favor, and the Mother will no more\nhave those to harken to her words and offer her the first fruits----\"\n\n\"But from whence came this bird which was Lurgha, can you tell me that,\nshe who waits upon the Mother?\"\n\n\"What difference does it make from what direction Lurgha came? That does\nnot add nor take from his power.\" Cassca moved beneath the arch. \"Or\ndoes it in some strange way, Assha?\"\n\n\"Perhaps it does. Only tell me.\"\n\nShe turned slowly and pointed over her right shoulder. \"From that way he\ncame, Assha. Well did I watch, knowing that I was the Mother's and that\neven Lurgha's thunderbolts could not eat me up. Does knowing that make\nLurgha smaller in your eyes, Assha? When he has eaten up all that is\nyours and your kin with it?\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" Assha repeated. \"I do not think Lurgha will come so again.\"\n\nShe shrugged, and the heavy cloak flapped. \"That shall be as it shall\nbe, Assha. Now go, for it is not good that any man come hither.\"\n\nCassca paced back into the heart of the green tunnel, and Ross and\nMcNeil came out of concealment. McNeil faced in the direction she had\npointed. \"Northeast--\" he commented thoughtfully, \"the Baltic lies in\nthat quarter.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 8\n\n\n\"... and that is about all.\" Ten days later Ashe, a dressing on his leg\nand a few of the pain lines smoothed from his face, sat on a bunk in the\narctic time post nursing a mug of coffee in his hands and smiling, a\nlittle crookedly, at Nelson Millaird.\n\nMillaird, Kelgarries, Dr. Webb, all the top brass of the project had not\nonly come through the transfer point to meet the three from Britain but\nwere now crammed into the room, nearly pushing Ross and McNeil through\nthe wall. Because this was it! What they had hunted for\nmonths--years--now lay almost within their grasp.\n\nOnly Millaird, the director, did not seem so confident. A big man with a\nbushy thatch of coarse graying hair and a heavy, fleshy face, he did not\nlook like a brain. Yet Ross had been on the roster long enough to know\nthat it was Millaird's thick and hairy hands that gathered together all\nthe loose threads of Operation Retrograde and deftly wove them into a\nworkable pattern. Now the director leaned back in a chair which was too\nsmall for his bulk, chewing thoughtfully on a toothpick.\n\n\"So we have the first whiff of a trail,\" he commented without elation.\n\n\"A pretty strong lead!\" Kelgarries broke in. Too excited to sit still,\nthe major stood with his back against the door, as alert as if he were\nabout to turn and face the enemy. \"The Reds wouldn't have moved against\nGog if they did not consider it a menace to them. Their big base must be\nin this time sector!\"\n\n\"_A_ big base,\" Millaird corrected. \"The one we are after, no. And right\nnow they may be switching times. Do you think they will sit here and\nwait for us to show up in force?\" But Millaird's tone, intended to\ndeflate, had no effect on the major.\n\n\"And just how long would it take them to dismantle a big base?\" that\nofficer countered. \"At least a month. If we shoot a team in there in a\nhurry--\"\n\nMillaird folded his huge hands over his barrel-shaped body and laughed,\nwithout a trace of humor. \"Just where do we send that team, Kelgarries?\nNortheast of a coastal point in Britain is a rather vague direction, to\nsay the least. Not,\" he spoke to Ashe now, \"that you didn't do all you\ncould, Ashe. And you, McNeil, nothing to add?\"\n\n\"No, sir. They jumped us out of the blue when Sandy thought he had every\npossible line tapped, every safeguard working. I don't know how they\ncaught on to us, unless they located our beam to this post. If so, they\nmust have been deliberately hunting us for some time, because we only\nused the beam as scheduled----\"\n\n\"The Reds have patience and brains and probably some more of their\nsurprise gadgets to help them. We have the patience and the brains, but\nnot the gadgets. And time is against us. Get anything out of this,\nWebb?\" Millaird asked the hitherto silent third member of his ruling\ncommittee.\n\nThe quiet man adjusted his glasses on the bridge of his nose, a\nflattish nose which did not support them very well. \"Just another point\nto add to our surmises. I would say that they are located somewhere near\nthe Baltic Sea. There are old trade routes there, and in our own time it\nis a territory closed to us. We never did know too much about that\nsection of Europe. Their installation may be close to the Finnish\nborder. They could disguise their modern station under half a dozen\ncovers; that is strange country.\"\n\nMillaird's hands unfolded and he produced a notebook and pen from a\nshirt pocket. \"Won't hurt to stir up some of the present-day agents of\nthe M.I. and the rest. They might just come up with a useful hint. So\nyou'd say the Baltic. But that is a big slice of country.\"\n\nWebb nodded. \"We have one advantage--the old trade routes. In the Beaker\nperiod they are pretty well marked. The major one into that section was\nestablished for the amber trade. The country is forested, but not so\nheavily as it was in an earlier period. The native tribes are mostly\nroving hunters, and fishermen along the coast. But they have had contact\nwith traders.\" He shoved his glasses back into place with a nervous\ngesture. \"The Reds may run into trouble themselves there at this\ntime----\"\n\n\"How?\" Kelgarries demanded.\n\n\"Invasion of the ax people. If they have not yet arrived, they are due\nvery soon. They formed one of the big waves of migratory people, who\nflooded the country, settled there. Eventually they became the Norse or\nCeltic stock. We don't know whether they stamped out the native tribes\nthey found there or assimilated them.\"\n\n\"That might be a nice point to have settled more definitely,\" McNeil\ncommented. \"It could mean the difference between getting your skull\nsplit and continuing to breathe.\"\n\n\"I don't think they would tangle with the traders. Evidence found today\nsuggests that the Beaker folk simply went on about their business in\nspite of a change in customers,\" Webb returned.\n\n\"Unless they were pushed into violence.\" Ashe handed his empty mug to\nRoss. \"Don't forget Lurgha's Wrath. From now on our enemies might take a\nvery dim view of any Beaker trade posts near their property.\"\n\nWebb shook his head slowly. \"A wholesale attack on Beaker establishments\nwould constitute a shift in history. The Reds won't dare that, not just\non general suspicion. Remember, they are not any more eager to tinker\nwith history than we are. No, they will watch for us. We will have to\nstop communication by radio----\"\n\n\"We can't!\" snapped Millaird vehemently. \"We can cut it down, but I\nwon't send the boys out without some means of quick communication. You\nlab boys put your brains to work and see what you can turn out in the\nway of talk boxes that they can't snoop. Time!\" He drummed on his knee\nwith his thick fingers. \"It all comes back to a question of time.\"\n\n\"Which we do not have,\" Ashe observed in his usual quiet voice. \"If the\nReds are afraid they have been spotted, they must be dismantling their\npost right now, working around the clock. We'll never again have such a\ngood chance to nail them. We must move now.\"\n\nMillaird's lids drooped almost shut; he might have been napping.\nKelgarries stirred restlessly by the door, and Webb's round face had\nsettled into what looked like permanent lines of disapproval.\n\n\"Doc,\" Millaird spoke over his shoulder to the fourth man of his\nfollowing, \"what is your report?\"\n\n\"Ashe must be under treatment for at least five days. McNeil's burns\naren't too bad, and Murdock's slash is almost healed.\"\n\n\"Five days--\" Millaird droned, and then flashed a glance at the major.\n\"Personnel. We're tied down without any useful personnel. Who in\nprocessing could be switched without tangling them up entirely?\"\n\n\"No one. I can recall Jansen and Van Wyke. These ax people might be a\ngood cover for them.\" The momentary light in Kelgarries' eyes faded.\n\"No, we have no proper briefing and can't get it until the tribe does\nappear on the map. I won't send any men in cold. Their blunders would\nnot only endanger them but might menace the whole project.\"\n\n\"So that leaves us with you three,\" Millaird said. \"We'll recall what\nmen we can and brief them again as fast as possible. But you know how\nlong that will take. In the meantime----\"\n\nAshe spoke directly to Webb. \"You can't pinpoint the region closer than\njust the Baltic?\"\n\n\"We can do this much,\" the other answered him slowly, and with obvious\nreluctance. \"We can send the sub cruising offshore there for the next\nfive days. If there is any radio activity--any communication--we should\nbe able to trace the beams. It all depends upon whether the Reds have\nany parties operating from their post. Flimsy----\"\n\n\"But something!\" Kelgarries seized upon it with the relief of one who\nneeded action.\n\n\"And they will be waiting for just such a move on our part,\" Webb\ncontinued deliberately.\n\n\"All right, so they'll be watching!\" the major said, about to lose his\ntemper, \"but it is about the only move we can make to back up the boys\nwhen they do go in.\"\n\nHe whipped around the door and was gone. Webb got up slowly. \"I will\nwork over the maps again,\" he told Ashe. \"We haven't scouted that area,\nand we don't dare send a photo-plane over it now. Any trip in will be a\nstab in the dark.\"\n\n\"When you have only one road, you take it,\" Ashe replied. \"I'll be glad\nto see anything you can show me, Miles.\"\n\nIf Ross had believed that his pre-trial-run cramming had been a rigorous\nbusiness, he was soon to laugh at that estimation. Since the burden of\nthe next jump would rest on only three of them--Ashe, McNeil, and\nhimself--they were plunged into a whirlwind of instruction, until Ross,\ndazed and too tired to sleep on the third night, believed that he was\nmore completely bewildered than indoctrinated. He said as much sourly to\nMcNeil.\n\n\"Base has pulled back three other teams,\" McNeil replied. \"But the men\nhave to go to school again, and they won't be ready to come on for maybe\nthree, four weeks. To change runs means unlearning stuff as well as\nlearning it----\"\n\n\"What about new men?\"\n\n\"Don't think Kelgarries isn't out now beating the bushes for some! Only,\nwe have to be fitted to the physical type we are supposed to represent.\nFor instance, set a small, dark-headed pugnose among your Norse sea\nrovers, and he's going to be noticed--maybe remembered too well. We\ncan't afford to take that chance. So Kelgarries had to discover men who\nnot only look the part but are also temperamentally fitted for this job.\nYou can't plant a fellow who thinks as a seaman--not a seaman, you\nunderstand, but one whose mind works in that pattern--among a wandering\ntribe of cattle herders. The protection for the man and the project lies\nin his being fitted into the right spot at the right time.\"\n\nRoss had never really thought of that point before. Now he realized that\nhe and Ashe and McNeil were of a common mold. All about the same\nheight, they shared brown hair and light eyes--Ashe's blue, his own\ngray, and McNeil's hazel--and they were of similar build, small-boned,\nlean, and quick-moving. He had not seen any of the true Beakermen except\non the films. But now, recalling those, he could see that the three time\ntraders were of the same general physical type as the far-roving people\nthey used as a cover.\n\nIt was on the morning of the fifth day while the three were studying a\nmap Webb had produced that Kelgarries, followed at his own weighty pace\nby Millaird, burst in upon them.\n\n\"We have it! This time _we_ have the luck! The Reds slipped. Oh, how\nthey slipped!\"\n\nWebb watched the major, a thin little smile pulling at his pursed mouth.\n\"Miracles sometimes do happen,\" he remarked. \"I suppose the sub has a\nfix for us.\"\n\nKelgarries passed over the flimsy strip of paper he had been waving as a\nbanner of triumph. Webb read the notation on it and bent over the map,\nmaking a mark with one of those needle-sharp pencils which seemed to\ngrow in his breast pocket, ready for use. Then he made a second mark.\n\n\"Well, it narrows it a bit,\" he conceded. Ashe looked in turn and\nlaughed.\n\n\"I would like to hear your definition of 'narrow' sometime, Miles.\nRemember we have to cover this on foot, and a difference of twenty miles\ncan mean a lot.\"\n\n\"That mark is quite a bit in from the sea.\" McNeil offered his own\nprotest when he saw the marking. \"We don't know that country--\"\n\nWebb shoved his glasses back for the hundredth time that morning. \"I\nsuppose we could consider this critical, condition red,\" he said in such\na dubious tone that he might have been begging someone to protest his\nstatement. But no one did. Millaird was busy with the map.\n\n\"I think we do, Miles!\" He looked to Ashe. \"You'll parachute in. The\npacks with which you will be equipped are special stuff. Once you have\nthem off sprinkle them with a powder Miles will provide and in ten\nminutes there won't be enough of them left for anyone to identify. We\nhaven't but a dozen of these, and we can't throw them away except in a\ncrisis. Find the base and rig up the detector. Your fix in this time\nwill be easy--but it is the other end of the line we must have. Until\nyou locate that, stick to the job. Don't communicate with us until you\nhave it!\"\n\n\"There is the possibility,\" Ashe pointed out, \"the Reds may have more\nthan one intermediate post. They probably have played it smart and set\nup a series of them to spoil a direct trace, as each would lead only to\nanother farther back in time----\"\n\n\"All right. If that proves true, just get us the next one back,\"\nMillaird returned. \"From that we can trace them along if we must send in\nsome of the boys wearing dinosaur skins later. We _have_ to find their\nprimary base, and if that hunt goes the hard way, well, we do it the\nhard way.\"\n\n\"How did you get the fix?\" McNeil asked.\n\n\"One of their field parties ran into trouble and yelled for help.\"\n\n\"Did they get it?\"\n\nThe major grinned. \"What do you think? You know the rules--and the ones\nthe Reds play by are twice as tough on their own men.\"\n\n\"What kind of trouble?\" Ashe wanted to know.\n\n\"Some kind of a local religious dispute. We do our best with their code,\nbut we're not a hundred per cent perfect in reading it. I gather they\nwere playing with a local god and got their fingers burned.\"\n\n\"Lurgha again, eh?\" Ashe smiled.\n\n\"Foolish,\" Webb said impatiently. \"That is a silly thing to do. You were\nalmost over the edge of prudence yourself, Gordon, with that Lurgha\nbusiness. To use the Great Mother was a ticklish thing to try, and you\nwere lucky to get out of it so easily.\"\n\n\"Once was enough,\" Ashe agreed. \"Though using it may have saved our\nlives. But I assure you I am not starting a holy war or setting up as a\nprophet.\"\n\nRoss had been taught something of map reading, but mentally he could not\nmake what he saw on paper resemble the countryside. A few landmarks, if\nthere were any outstanding ones, were all he could hope to impress upon\nhis memory until he was actually on the ground.\n\nLanding there according to Millaird's instruction was another experience\nhe would not have chosen of his own accord. To jump was a matter of\ntiming, and in the dark with a measure of rain thrown in, the action was\nanything but pleasant. Leaving the plane in a blind, follow-the-leader\nfashion, Ross found the descent into darkness one of the worst trials he\nhad yet faced. But he did not make too bad a landing in the small\nparklike expanse they had chosen for their target.\n\nRoss pulled loose his harness and chute, dragging them to what he judged\nto be the center of the clearing. Hearing a plaintive bray from the air,\nhe dodged as one of the two burden asses sent to join them landed and\nbegan to kick at its trappings. The animals they had chosen were the\nmost docile available and they had been given sedation before the jump\nso that now, feeling Ross's hands, the donkey stood quietly while Ross\nstripped it of its hanging straps.\n\n\"Rossa--\" The sound of his Beaker name called through the dark brought\nRoss facing in the other direction.\n\n\"Here, and I have one of the donkeys.\"\n\n\"And I the other!\" That was McNeil.\n\nTheir eyes adjusted to a gloom which was not as thick as it would be in\nthe forest and they worked fast. Then they dragged the parachutes\ntogether in a heap. The rain would, Webb had assured them, add to the\nrapid destruction wrought by the chemical he had provided. Ashe shook it\nover the pile, and there was a faint greenish glow. Then they moved away\nto the woodland and made camp for the balance of the night.\n\nSo much of their whole exploit depended upon luck, and this small part\nhad been successful. Unless some agent had been stationed to watch for\ntheir arrival Ross believed they could not be spotted.\n\nThe rest of their plan was elastic. Posing as traders who had come to\nopen a new station, they were to stay near a river which drained a lake\nand then angled southward to the distant sea. They knew this section was\nonly sparsely settled by small tribes, hardly larger than family clans.\nThese people were generations behind the civilized level of the\nvillagers of Britain--roving hunters who followed the sweep of game\nnorth or south with the seasons.\n\nAlong the seashore the fishermen had established more permanent holdings\nwhich were slowly becoming towns. There were perhaps a few hardy pioneer\nfarmers on the southern fringes of the district, but the principle\nreason traders came to this region was to get amber and furs. The Beaker\npeople dealt in both.\n\nNow as the three sheltered under the wide branches of a towering pine\nAshe fumbled with a pack and brought out the \"beaker\" which was the\nidentifying mark of his adopted people. He measured into it a portion of\nthe sour, stimulating drink which the traders introduced wherever they\nwent. The cup passed from hand to hand, its taste unpleasant on the\ntongue, but comfortingly warm to one's middle.\n\nThey took turns keeping the watch until the gray of false dawn became\nthe clearer light of morning. After breakfasting on flat cakes of meal,\nthey packed the donkeys, using the same knots and cross lashing which\nwere the mark of real Beaker traders. Their bows protected from dampness\nunder their cloaks, they set out to find the river and their path\nsouthward.\n\nAshe led, Ross towed the donkeys, and McNeil brought up the rear. In the\nabsence of a path they had to set a ragged course, keeping to the edge\nof the clearing until they saw the end of the lake.\n\n\"Woodsmoke,\" Ashe commented when they had completed two thirds of their\njourney. Ross sniffed and was able to smell it too. Nodding to Ashe,\nMcNeil oozed into nothingness between the trees with an ease Murdock\nenvied. As they waited for him to return, Ross became conscious of\nanother life about them, one busy with its own concerns, which were in\nno way those of human beings, except that food and perhaps shelter were\nto be reckoned among them.\n\nIn Britain, Ross had known there were others of his kind about, but this\nwas different. Here, he could have believed it if he had been told he\nwas the first man to walk this way.\n\nA squirrel ran out on a tree limb and surveyed the two men with curious\nbeady eyes, then clung head down on the tree trunk to see them better.\nOne of the donkeys tossed its head, and the squirrel was gone with a\nflirt of its tail. Although it was quiet, there was a hum underneath the\nsurface which Ross tried to analyze, to identify the many small sounds\nwhich went into its making.\n\nPerhaps because he was trying so hard, he noted the faint noise. His\nhand touched Ashe's arm and a slight movement of his head indicated the\ndirection of the sound. Then, as fluidly as he had melted into the\nwoods, McNeil returned. \"Company,\" he said in a soft voice.\n\n\"What kind?\"\n\n\"Tribesmen, but wilder than any I've seen, even on the tapes. We are\ncertainly out on the fringes now. These people look about cave level. I\ndon't think they've ever heard of traders.\"\n\n\"How many?\"\n\n\"Three, maybe four families. Most of the males must be out hunting, but\nthere're about ten children and six or seven women. I don't think\nthey've had good luck lately by the look of them.\"\n\n\"Maybe their luck and ours are going to turn together,\" Ashe said,\nmotioning Ross forward with the donkeys. \"We will circle about them to\nthe river and then try bartering later. But I do want to establish\ncontact.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 9\n\n\n\"Not to be too hopeful--\" McNeil rubbed his arm across his hot face--\"so\nfar, so good.\" After kicking from his path some of the branches Ross had\nlopped from the trees they had been felling, he went to help his\ncompanion roll another small log up to a shelter which was no longer\ntemporary. If there had been any eyes other than the woodland hunters'\nto spy upon them, they would have seen only the usual procedure of the\nBeaker traders, busily constructing one of their posts.\n\nThat they were being watched by the hunters, all three were certain.\nThat there might be other spies in the forest, they had to assume for\ntheir own safety. They might prowl at night, but in the daytime all of\nthe time agents kept within the bounds of the roles they were acting.\n\nBarter with the head men of the hunting clan had brought those shy\npeople into the camp of the strangers who had such wonders to exchange\nfor tanned deer hides and better furs. The news of the traders' arrival\nspread quickly during the short time they had been here, so that two\nother clans had sent men to watch the proceedings.\n\nWith the trade came news which the agents sifted and studied. Each of\nthem had a list of questions to insert into their conversations with the\ntribesmen if and when that was possible. Although they did not share a\ncommon speech with the forest men, signs were informative and certain\nnouns could be quickly learned. In the meantime Ashe became friendly\nwith the nearest and first of the clan groups they discovered, going\nhunting with the men as an excuse to penetrate the unknown section they\nmust quarter in their search for the Red base.\n\nRoss drank river water and mopped his own hot face. \"If the Reds aren't\ntraders,\" he mused aloud, \"what _is_ their cover?\"\n\nMcNeil shrugged. \"A hunting tribe--fishermen--\"\n\n\"Where would they get the women and children?\"\n\n\"The same way they get their men--recruit them in our own time. Or in\nthe way lots of tribes grew during periods of stress.\"\n\nRoss set down the water jug. \"You mean, kill off the men, take over\ntheir families?\" This was a cold-bloodedness he found sickening.\nAlthough he had always prided himself on his toughness, several times\nduring his training at the project he had been confronted by things\nwhich shook his belief in his own strong stomach and nerve.\n\n\"It has been done,\" McNeil remarked bleakly, \"hundreds of times by\ninvaders. In this setup--small family clans, widely scattered--that move\nwould be very easy.\"\n\n\"They would have to pose as farmers, not hunters,\" Ross pointed out.\n\"They couldn't move a base around with them.\"\n\n\"All right, so they set up a farming village. Oh, I see what you\nmean--there isn't any village around here. Yet they are here, maybe\nunderground.\"\n\nHow right their guesses were they learned that night when Ashe returned,\na deer's haunch on his shoulder. Ross knew him well enough by now to\nsense his preoccupation. \"You found something?\"\n\n\"A new set of ghosts,\" Ashe replied with a strange little smile.\n\n\"Ghosts!\" McNeil pounced upon that. \"The Reds like to play the\nsupernatural angle, don't they? First the voice of Lurgha and now\nghosts. What do these ghosts do?\"\n\n\"They inhabit a bit of mountainous territory southeast of here, a\nstretch strictly taboo for all hunters. We were following a bison track\nuntil the beast headed for the ghost country. Then Ulffa called us off\nin a hurry. It seems that the hunter who goes in there after his quarry\nnever reappears, or if he does, it's in a damaged condition, blown upon\nby ghosts and burned to death! That's one point.\"\n\nHe sat down by the fire and stretched his arms wearily. \"The second is a\nlittle more disturbing for us. A Beaker camp about twenty miles south of\nhere, as far as I can judge, was exterminated just a week ago. The\nmessage was passed to me because I was thought to be a kinsman of the\nslain----\"\n\nMcNeil sat up. \"Done because they were hunting us?\"\n\n\"Might well be. On the other hand, the affair may have been just one of\ngeneral precaution.\"\n\n\"The ghosts did it?\" Ross wanted to know.\n\n\"I asked that. No, it seems that strange tribesmen overran it at night.\"\n\n\"At night?\" McNeil whistled.\n\n\"Just so.\" Ashe's tone was dry. \"The tribes do not fight that way.\nEither someone slipped up in his briefing, or the Reds are overconfident\nand don't care about the rules. But it was the work of tribesmen, or\ntheir counterfeits. There is also a nasty rumor speeding about that the\nghosts do not relish traders and that they might protest intrusions of\nsuch with penalties all around----\"\n\n\"Like the Wrath of Lurgha,\" supplied Ross.\n\n\"There is a certain repetition in this which suggests a lot to the\nsuspicious mind,\" Ashe agreed.\n\n\"I'd say no more hunting expeditions for the present,\" McNeil said. \"It\nis too easy to mistake a friend for a deer and weep over his grave\nafterward.\"\n\n\"That is a thought which entered my mind several times this afternoon,\"\nAshe agreed. \"These people are deceptively simple on the surface, but\ntheir minds do not work along the same patterns as ours. We try to\noutwit them, but it takes only one slip to make it fatal. In the\nmeantime, I think we'd better make this place a little more snug, and it\nmight be well to post sentries as unobtrusively as possible.\"\n\n\"How about faking some signs of a ruined camp and heading into the blue\nourselves?\" McNeil asked. \"We could strike for the ghost mountains,\ntraveling by night, and Ulffa's crowd would think we were finished off.\"\n\n\"An idea to keep in mind. The point against it would be the missing\nbodies. It seems that the tribesmen who raided the Beaker camp left some\nvery distasteful evidence of what happened to the camp's personnel. And\nthose we can't produce to cover our trail.\"\n\nMcNeil was not yet convinced. \"We might be able to fake something along\nthat line, too----\"\n\n\"We may have to fake nothing,\" Ross cut in softly. He was standing close\nto the edge of the clearing where they were building their hut, his hand\non one of the saplings in the palisade they had set up so laboriously\nthat day. Ashe was beside him in an instant.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\nRoss's hours of listening to the sounds of the wilderness were his\nmeasuring gauge now. \"That bird has never called from inland before. It\nis the blue one we've seen fishing for frogs along the river.\"\n\nAshe, not even glancing at the forest, went for the water jug. \"Get your\ntrail supplies,\" he ordered.\n\nTheir leather pouches which held enough iron rations to keep them going\nwere always at hand. McNeil gathered them from behind the fur curtain\nfronting their half-finished cabin. Again the bird called, its cry\npiercing and covering a long distance. Ross could understand why a\ncareless man would select it for the signal. He crossed the clearing to\nthe donkeys' shelter, slashing through their nose halters. Probably the\npatient little beasts would swiftly fall victims to some forest\nprowlers, but at least they would have their chance to escape.\n\nMcNeil, his cloak slung about him to conceal the ration bags, picked up\nthe leather bucket as if he were merely going down to the river for\nwater, and came to join Ross. They believed that they were carrying it\noff well, that the camp must appear normal to any lurkers in the woods.\nBut either they had made some slip or the enemy was impatient. An arrow\nsped out of the night to flash across the fire, and Ashe escaped death\nonly because he had leaned forward to feed the flames. His arm swung out\nand sent the water in the jar hissing onto the blaze as he himself\nrolled in the other direction.\n\nRoss plunged for the brush with McNeil. Lying flat on the half-frozen\nground, they started to work their way to the river bank where the open\narea would make surprise less possible.\n\n\"Ashe?\" he whispered and felt McNeil's warm breath on his cheek as he\nreplied:\n\n\"He'll make it the other way! He's the best we have for this sort of\njob.\"\n\nThey made a worm's progress, twice lying, with dagger in hand, while\nthey listened to a faint rustle which betrayed the passing of one of the\nattackers. Both times Ross was tempted to rise and try to cut off the\nstranger, but he fought down the impulse. He had learned a control of\nhimself that would have been impossible for him a few months earlier.\n\nThe glimmer of the river was pale through the clumps of bushes which\nsometimes grew into the flood. In this country winter still clung\ntenaciously in shadowy places with cups of leftover snow, and there was\na bite in the wind and water. Ross rose to his knees with an involuntary\ngasp as a scream cut through the night. He wrenched around toward the\ncamp, only to feel McNeil's hand clamp on his forearm.\n\n\"That was a donkey,\" whispered McNeil urgently. \"Come on, let's go down\nto that ford we discovered!\"\n\nThey turned south, daring now to trot, half bent to the ground. The\nriver was swollen with spring floods which were only now beginning to\nsubside, but two days earlier they had noticed a sandbar at one spot. By\ncrossing that shelf across the bed, they might hope to put water between\nthem and the unknown enemy tonight. It would give them a breathing\nspace, even though Ross privately shrank from the thought of plowing\ninto the stream. He had seen good-sized trees swirling along in the\ncurrent only yesterday. And to make such a dash in the dark....\n\nFrom McNeil's throat burst a startling sound which Ross had last heard\nin Britain--the questing howl of a hunting wolf. The cry was answered\nseconds later from downstream.\n\n\"Ashe!\"\n\nThey worked their way along the edge of the water with continued care,\nuntil they came upon Ashe at last, so much a part of his background that\nRoss started when the lump he had taken for a bush hunched forward to\njoin them. Together they made the river crossing and turned south again\nto head for the mountains. It was then that disaster struck.\n\nRoss heard no birdcall warning this time. Though he was on guard, he\nnever sensed the approach of the man who struck him down from behind.\nOne moment he had been trailing McNeil and Ashe; the next moment was\nblack nothingness.\n\nHe was aware of a throb of pain which carried throughout his body and\nthen localized in his head. Forcing open his eyes, the dazzle of light\nwas like a spear point striking directly into his head, intensifying his\npain to agony. He brought his hand up to his face and felt stickiness\nthere.\n\n\"Assha--\" He believed he called that aloud, but he did not even hear his\nown voice. They were in a valley; a wolf had attacked him out of the\nbushes. Wolf? No, the wolf was dead, but then it came alive again to\nhowl on a river bank.\n\nRoss forced his eyes open once more, enduring the pain of beams he\nrecognized as sunshine. He turned his head to avoid the glare. It was\nhard to focus, but he fought to steady himself. There was some reason\nwhy it was necessary to move, to get away. But away from what and where?\nWhen Ross tried to think he could only see muddled pictures which had no\nconnection.\n\nThen a moving object crossed his very narrow field of vision, passing\nbetween him and a thing he knew was a tree trunk. A four-footed creature\nwith a red tongue hanging from its jaws. It came toward him\nstiff-legged, growling low in its throat, and sniffed at his body before\nbarking in short excited bursts of sound.\n\nThe noise hurt his head so much that Ross closed his eyes. Then a shock\nof icy liquid thrown into his face aroused him to make a feeble protest\nand he saw, hanging over him in a strange upside-down way, a bearded\nface which he knew from the past.\n\nHands were laid on him and the roughness with which he was moved sent\nRoss spiraling back into the dark once again. When he aroused for the\nsecond time it was night and the pain in his head was dulled. He put out\nhis hands and discovered that he lay on a pile of fur robes, and was\ncovered by one.\n\n\"Assha--\" Again he tried that name. But it was not Assha who came in\nanswer to his feeble call. The woman who knelt beside him with a horn\ncup in her hand had neatly braided hair in which gray strands showed\nsilver by firelight. Ross knew he had seen her before, but again where\nand when eluded him. She slipped a sturdy arm under his head and raised\nhim while the world whirled about. The edge of the horn cup was pressed\nto his lips, and he drank bitter stuff which burned in his throat and\nlit a fire in his insides. Then he was left to himself once again and in\nspite of his pain and bewilderment he slept.\n\nHow many days he lay in the camp of Ulffa, tended by the chief's head\nwife, Ross found it hard to reckon. It was Frigga who had argued the\ntribe into caring for a man they believed almost dead when they found\nhim, and who nursed Ross back to life with knowledge acquired through\nhalf a hundred exchanges between those wise women who were the doctors\nand priestesses of these roaming peoples.\n\nWhy Frigga had bothered with the injured stranger at all Ross learned\nwhen he was able to sit up and marshal his bewildered thoughts into some\nsort of order. The matriarch of the tribe thirsted for knowledge. That\nsame urge which had led her to certain experiments with herbs, had made\nher consider Ross a challenge to her healing skill. When she knew that\nhe would live she determined to learn from him all he had to give.\n\nUlffa and the men of the tribe might have eyed the metal weapons of the\ntraders with awe and avid desire, but Frigga wanted more than trade\ngoods. She wanted the secret of the making of such cloth as the\nstrangers wore, everything she could learn of their lives and the lands\nthrough which they had come. She plied Ross with endless questions which\nhe answered as best he could, for he lay in an odd dreamy state where\nonly the present had any reality. The past was dim and far away, and\nwhile he was now and then dimly aware that he had something to do, he\nforgot it easily.\n\nThe chief and his men prowled the half-built station after the attackers\nhad withdrawn, bringing back with them a handful of loot--a bronze\nrazor, two skinning knives, some fishhooks, a length of cloth which\nFrigga appropriated. Ross eyed this spoil indifferently, making no claim\nupon it. His interest in everything about him was often blanked out by\nheadaches which kept him limp on his bed, uncaring and stupid for hours\nor even full days.\n\nHe gathered that the tribe had been living in fear of an attack from the\nsame raiders who had wiped out the trading post. But at last their\nscouts returned with the information that the enemy had gone south.\n\nThere was one change of which Ross was not aware but which might have\nstartled both Ashe and McNeil. Ross Murdock had indeed died under that\nblow which had left him unconscious beside the river. The young man whom\nFrigga had drawn back to sense and a slow recovery was Rossa of the\nBeaker people. This same Rossa nursed a hot desire for vengeance against\nthose who had struck him down and captured his kinsmen, a feeling which\nthe family tribe who had rescued him could well understand.\n\nThere was the same old urgency pushing him to try his strength now, to\nkeep to his feet even when they were unsteady. His bow was gone, but\nRoss spent hours fashioning another, and he traded his copper bracelet\nfor the best dozen arrows in Ulffa's camp. The jet pin from his cloak he\npresented to Frigga with all his gratitude.\n\nNow that his strength was coming back he could not rest easy in the\ncamp. He was ready to leave, even though the gashes on his head were\nstill tender to the touch. Ulffa indulgently planned a hunt southward,\nand Rossa took the trail with the tribesmen.\n\nHe broke with the clan hunters when they turned aside at the beginning\nof the taboo land. Ross, his own mind submerged and taken over by his\nBeaker cover, hesitated too. Yet he could not give up, and the others\nleft him there, his eyes on the forbidden heights, unhappy and tormented\nby more than the headaches which still came and went with painful\nregularity. In the mountains lay what he sought--a hidden something\nwithin his brain told him that over and over--but the mountains were\ntaboo, and he should not venture into them.\n\nHow long he might have hesitated there if he had not come upon the\ntrail, Ross did not know. But on the day after the hunters of Ulffa's\nclan left, a glint of sunlight striking between two trees pointed out a\nwoodsman's blaze on a third tree trunk. The two halves of Ross's memory\nclicked together for an instant as he examined that cut. He knew that it\nmarked a trace and he pushed on, hunting a second cut and then a third.\nConvinced that these would lead him into the unknown territory, Ross's\ndesire to explore overcame the grafted superstitions of his briefing.\n\nThere were other signs that this was an often-traveled route: a spring\ncleared of leaves and walled with stone, a couple of steps cut in the\nturf on a steep slope. Ross moved warily, alert to any sound. He might\nnot be an expert woodsman, but he was learning fast, perhaps the faster\nbecause his false memories now supplanted the real ones.\n\nThat night he built no fire, crawling instead into the heart of a rotted\nlog to sleep, awakening once to the call of a wolf and another time at\nthe distant crash of a dead tree yielding to wind.\n\nIn the morning he was about to climb back to the trail he had prudently\nleft the night before when he saw five bearded, fur-clad men looking\nmuch the same as Ulffa's people. Ross hugged the earth and watched them\npass out of sight before he followed.\n\nAll that day he wove an up-and-down trail behind the small band,\nsometimes catching sight of them as they topped a rise well ahead or\nstopped to eat. It was late afternoon when he crept cautiously to the\ntop of a ridge and gazed down into a valley.\n\nThere was a town in that valley, sturdy houses of logs behind a\nstockade. He had seen towns vaguely like it before, yet it had a\ndreamlike quality as if it were not as real as it appeared.\n\nRoss rested his chin on his arms and watched that town and the people\nmoving in it. Some were fur-clad hunters, but others dressed quite\ndifferently. He started up with a little cry at the sight of one of the\nmen who had walked so swiftly from one house to the next; surely he was\na Beaker trader!\n\nHis unease grew stronger with every moment he watched, but it was the\noddness he sensed in that town which bothered him and not any warning\nthat he, himself, was in danger. He had gotten to his knees to see\nbetter when out of nowhere a rope sang through the air, settling about\nhis chest with a vicious jerk which not only drove the air from his\nlungs but pinioned his arms tight to his body.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 10\n\n\nHaving been cuffed and battered into submission more quickly than would\nhave been possible three weeks earlier, Murdock now stood sullenly\nsurveying the man who, though he dressed like a Beaker trader, persisted\nin using a language Ross did not know.\n\n\"We do not play as children here.\" At last the man spoke words Ross\ncould understand. \"You will answer me or else others shall ask the\nquestions, and less gently. I say to you now--who are you and from where\ndo you come?\"\n\nFor a moment Ross glowered across the table at him, his inbred\nantagonism to authority aroused by that contemptuous demand, but then\ncommon sense cautioned. His initial introduction to this village had\nleft him bruised and with one of his headaches. There was no reason to\nlet them beat him until he was in no shape to make a break for freedom\nwhen and if there was an opportunity.\n\n\"I am Rossa of the traders,\" he returned, eying the man with a carefully\nmeasured stare. \"I came into this land in search of my kinsmen who were\ntaken by raiders in the night.\"\n\nThe man, who sat on a stool by the table, smiled slowly. Again he spoke\nin the strange tongue, and Ross merely stared stolidly back. His words\nwere short and explosive sounding, and the man's smile faded; his\nannoyance grew as he continued to speak.\n\nOne of Ross's two guards ventured to interrupt, using the Beaker\nlanguage. \"From where did you come?\" He was a quiet-faced, slender man,\nnot like his companion, who had roped Murdock from behind and was of the\nbully breed, able to subdue Ross's wildcat resistance in a very short\nstruggle.\n\n\"I came to this land from the south,\" Ross answered, \"after the manner\nof my people. This is a new land with furs and the golden tears of the\nsun to be gathered and bartered. The traders move in peace, and their\nhands are raised against no man. Yet in the darkness there came those\nwho would slay without profit, for what reason I have no knowing.\"\n\nThe quiet man continued the questioning and Ross answered fully with\ndetails of the past of one Rossa, a Beaker merchant. Yes, he was from\nthe south. His father was Gurdi, who had a trading post in the warm\nlands along the big river. This was Rossa's first trip to open new\nterritory. He had come with his father's blood brother, Assha, who was a\nnoted far voyager, and it was an honor to be chosen as donkey-leader for\nsuch a one as Assha. With Assha had been Macna, one who was also a far\ntrader, though not as noted as Assha.\n\nOf a certainty, Assha was of his own race! Ross blinked at that\nquestion. One need only to look upon him to know that he was of trader\nblood and no uncivilized woodsrunner. How long had he known Assha? Ross\nshrugged. Assha had come to his father's post the winter before and had\nstayed with them through the cold season. Gurdi and Assha had mingled\nblood after he pulled Gurdi free from the river in flood. Assha had\nlost his boat and trade goods in that rescue, so Gurdi had made good his\nloss this year. Detail by detail he gave the story. In spite of the fact\nthat he provided these details glibly, sure that they were true, Ross\ncontinued to be haunted by an odd feeling that he was indeed reciting a\ntale of adventure which had happened long ago and to someone else.\nPerhaps that pain in his head made him think of these events as very\ncolorless and far away.\n\n\"It would seem\"--the quiet man turned to the one behind the table--\"that\nthis is indeed one Rossa, a Beaker trader.\"\n\nBut the man looked impatient, angry. He made a sign to the other guard,\nwho turned Ross around roughly and sent him toward the door with a\nshove. Once again the leader gave an order in his own language, adding a\nfew words more with a stinging snap that might have been a threat or a\nwarning.\n\nRoss was thrust into a small room with a hard floor and not even a skin\nrug to serve as a bed. Since the quiet man had ordered the removal of\nthe ropes from Ross's arms, he leaned against the wall, rubbing the pain\nof returning circulation away from his wrists and trying to understand\nwhat had happened to him and where he was. Having spied upon it from the\nheights, he knew it wasn't an ordinary trading station, and he wanted to\nknow what they did here. Also, somewhere in this village he hoped to\nfind Assha and Macna.\n\nAt the end of the day his captors opened the door only long enough to\npush inside a bowl and a small jug. He felt for those in the dusk,\ndipping his fingers into a lukewarm mush of meal and drinking the water\nfrom the jug avidly. His headache dulled, and from experience Ross knew\nthat this bout was almost over. If he slept, he would waken with a\nclearer mind and no pain. Knowing he was very tired, he took the\nprecaution of curling up directly in front of the door so that no one\ncould enter without arousing him.\n\nIt was still dark when he awoke with a curious urgency remaining from a\ndream he could not remember. Ross sat up, flexing his arms and shoulders\nto combat the stiffness which had come with his cramped sleep. He could\nnot rid himself of a feeling that there was something to be done and\nthat time was his enemy.\n\nAssha! Gratefully he seized on that. He must find Assha and Macna, for\nthe three of them could surely discover a way to get out of this\nvillage. That was what was so important!\n\nHe had been handled none too gently, and they were holding him a\nprisoner. But Ross believed that this was not the worst which could\nhappen to him here, and he must be free before the worst did come. The\nquestion was, How could he escape? His bow and dagger were gone, and he\ndid not even have his long cloak pin for a weapon, since he had given\nthat to Frigga.\n\nRunning his hands over his body, Ross inventoried what remained of his\nclothing and possessions. He unfastened the bronze chain-belt still\nbuckled in his kilt tunic, swinging the length speculatively in one\nhand. A masterpiece of craftsmanship, it consisted of patterned plates\nlinked together with a series of five finely wrought chains and a front\nbuckle in the form of a lion's head, its protruding tongue serving as a\nhook to support a dagger sheath. Its weight promised a weapon of sorts,\nwhich when added to the element of surprise might free him.\n\nBy rights they would be expecting him to produce some opposition,\nhowever. It was well known that only the best fighters, the shrewdest\nminds, followed the traders' roads. It was a proud thing to be a trader\nin the wilderness, a thought that warmed Ross now as he waited in the\ndark for what luck and Ba-Bal of the Bright Horns would send. Were he\never to return to Gurdi's post, Ba-Bal, whose boat rode across the sky\nfrom dawn to dusk, would have a fine ox, jars of the first brewing, and\nsweet-smelling amber laid upon his altar.\n\nRoss had patience which he had learned from the mixed heritage of his\ntwo pasts, the real and the false graft. He could wait as he had waited\nmany times before--quiet, and with outward ease--for the right moment to\ncome. It came now with footsteps ringing sharply, halting before his\ncell door.\n\nWith the noiseless speed of a hunting cat, Ross flung himself from\nbehind the door to a wall, where he would be hidden from the newcomer\nfor that necessary instant or two. If his attack was to be successful,\nit must occur inside the room. He heard the sound of a bar being slid\nout of its brackets, and he poised himself, the belt rippling from his\nright hand.\n\nThe door was opening inward, and a man stood silhouetted against the\nouter light. He muttered, looking toward the corner where Ross had\nthrown his single garment in a roll which might just resemble, for the\nneeded second or two, a man curled in slumber. The man in the doorway\ntook the bait, coming forward far enough for Ross to send the door\nslamming shut as he himself sprang with the belt aimed for the other's\nhead.\n\nThere was a startled cry, cut off in the middle as the belt plates met\nflesh and bone in a crushing force. Luck was with him! Ross caught up\nhis kilt and belted it around him after he had made a hurried\nexamination of the body now lying at his feet. He was not sure that the\nman was dead, but at any rate he was completely unconscious. Ross\nstripped off the man's cloak, located his dagger, freed it from the belt\nhook, and snapped it on his own.\n\nThen inch by inch Ross edged open the door, peering through the crack.\nAs far as he could see, the hall was empty, so he jerked the portal\nopen, and dagger in hand, sprang out, ready for attack. He closed the\ndoor, slipping the bar back into its brackets. If the man inside revived\nand pounded for attention, his own friends might think it was Ross and\ndelay investigating.\n\nBut the escape from the cell was the easiest part of what he planned to\ndo, as Ross well knew. To find Assha and Macna in this maze of rooms\noccupied by the enemy was far more difficult. Although he had no idea in\nwhich of the village buildings they might be confined, this one was the\nlargest and seemed to be the headquarters of the chief men, which meant\nit could also serve as their prison.\n\nLight came from a torch in a bracket halfway down the hall. The wood\nburned smokily, giving off a resinous odor, and to Ross the glow was\nsufficient illumination. He slipped along as close to the wall as he\ncould, ready to freeze at the slightest sound. But this portion of the\nbuilding might well have been deserted, for he saw or heard no one. He\ntried the only two doors opening out of the hall, but they were secured\non the other side. Then he came to a bend in the corridor, and stopped\nshort, hearing a murmur of low voices.\n\nIf he had used a hunter's tricks of silent tread and vigilant wariness\nbefore, Ross was doubly on guard now as he wriggled to a point from\nwhich he could see beyond that turn. Mere luck prevented him from giving\nhimself away a moment later.\n\nAssha! Assha, alive, well, apparently under no restraint, was just\nturning away from the same quiet man who had had a part in Ross's\ninterrogation. That was surely Assha's brown hair, his slender wiry body\ndraped with a Beaker's kilt. A familiar tilt of the head convinced Ross,\nthough he could not see the man's face. The quiet man went down the\nhall, leaving Assha before a door. As he passed through it Ross sped\nforward and followed him inside.\n\nAssha had crossed the bare room and was standing on a glowing plate in\nthe floor. Ross, aroused to desperate action by some fear he did not\nunderstand, leaped after him. His left hand fell upon Assha's shoulder,\nturning the man half around as Ross, too, stepped upon the patch of\nluminescence.\n\nMurdock had only an instant to realize that he was staring into the face\nof an astonished stranger. His hand flashed up in an edgewise blow which\ncaught the other on the side of the throat, and then the world came\napart about them. There was a churning, whirling sickness which griped\nand bent Ross almost double across the crumpled body of his victim. He\nheld his head lest it be torn from his shoulders by the spinning thing\nwhich seemed based behind his eyes.\n\nThe sickness endured only for a moment, and some buried part of Ross's\nmind accepted it as a phenomenon he had experienced before. He came out\nof it gasping, to focus his attention once more on the man at his feet.\n\nThe stranger was still breathing. Ross stooped to drag him from the\nplate and began binding and gagging him with lengths torn from his kilt.\nOnly when his captive was secure did he begin looking about him\ncuriously.\n\nThe room was bare of any furnishings and now, as he glanced at the\nfloor, Ross saw that the plate had lost its glow. The Beaker trader\nRossa rubbed sweating palms on his kilt and thought fleetingly of forest\nghosts and other mysteries. Not that the traders bowed to those ghosts\nwhich were the plague of lesser men and tribes, but anything which\nsuddenly appeared and then disappeared without any logical explanation,\nneeded thinking on. Murdock pulled the prisoner, who was now reviving,\nto the far end of the room and then went back to the plate with the\npersistence of a man who refused to treat with ghosts and wanted\nsomething concrete to explain the unexplainable. Though he rubbed his\nhands across the smooth surface of the plate, it did not light up\nagain.\n\nHis captive having writhed himself half out of the corner of the room,\nRoss debated the wisdom of another silencing--say a tap on the skull\nwith the heavy hilt of his dagger. Deciding against it because he might\nneed a guide, he freed the victim's ankle bonds and pulled him to his\nfeet, holding the dagger ready where the man could see it. Were there\nany more surprises to be encountered in this place, Assha's double would\ntest them first.\n\nThe door did not lead to the same corridor, or even the same kind of\ncorridor Ross had passed through moments earlier. Instead they entered a\nshort passage with walls of some smooth stuff which had almost the sheen\nof polished metal and were sleek and cold to the touch. In fact, the\nwhole place was chill, chill as river water in the spring.\n\nStill herding the prisoner before him, Ross came to the nearest door and\nlooked within, to be faced by incomprehensible frames of metal rods and\nboxes. Rossa of the traders marveled and stared, but again, he realized\nthat what he saw was not altogether strange. Part of one wall was a\nboard on which small lights flashed and died, to flash again in winks of\nbright color. A mysterious object made of wire and disks hung across the\nback of a chair standing near-by.\n\nThe bound man lurched for the chair and fell, rolling toward the wall.\nRoss pushed him on until he was hidden behind one of the metal boxes.\nThen he made the rounds of the room, touching nothing, but studying what\nhe could not understand. Puffs of warm air came in through grills near\nthe floor, but the room had the same general chill as the hall outside.\n\nMeanwhile the lights on the board had become more active, flashing on\nand off in complex patterns. Ross now heard a buzzing, as if a swarm of\nangry insects were gathered for an attack. Crouching beside his captive,\nRoss watched the lights, trying to discover the source of the sound.\n\nThe buzz grew shriller, almost demanding. Ross heard the tramp of heavy\nfootgear in the corridor, and a man entered the room, crossing\npurposefully to the chair. He sat down and drew the wire-and-disk frame\nover his head. His hands moved under the lights, but Ross could not\nguess what he was doing.\n\nThe captive at Murdock's side tried to stir, but Ross's hand pinned him\nquiet. The shrill noise which had originally summoned the man at the\nlights was interrupted by a sharp pattern of long-and-short sounds, and\nhis hands flew even more quickly while Ross took in every detail of the\nother's clothing and equipment. He was neither a shaggy tribesman nor a\ntrader. He wore a dull-green outer garment cut in one piece to cover his\narms and legs as well as his body, and his hair was so short that his\nround skull might have been shaven. Ross rubbed the back of his wrist\nacross his eyes, experiencing again that dim other memory. Odd as this\nman looked, Murdock had seen his like before somewhere, yet the\nbackground had not been Gurdi's post on the southern river. Where and\nwhen had he, Rossa, ever been with such strange beings? And why could he\nnot remember it all more clearly?\n\nBoots sounded once more in the hall, and another figure strode in. This\none wore furs, but he, too, was no woods hunter, Ross realized as he\nstudied the newcomer in detail. The loose overshirt of thick fur with\nits hood thrown back, the high boots, and all the rest were not of any\nprimitive fashioning. And the man had four eyes! One pair were placed\nnormally on either side of his nose, and the other two, black-rimmed and\nmurky, were set above on his forehead.\n\nThe fur-clad man tapped the one seated at the board. He freed his head\npartially from the wire cage so that they could talk together in a\nstrange language while lights continued to flash and the buzzing died\naway. Ross's captive wriggled with renewed vigor and at last thrashed\nfree a foot to kick at one of the metal installations. The resulting\nclang brought both men around. The one at the board tore his head cage\noff as he jumped to his feet, while the other brought out a gun.\n\nGun? One little fraction of Ross's mind wondered at his recognition of\nthat black thing and of the danger it promised, even as he prepared for\nbattle. He pushed his captive across the path of the man in fur and\nthrew himself in the other direction. There was a blast to make a\ntorment in his head as he hurled toward the door.\n\nSo intent was Ross upon escape that he did not glance behind but skidded\nout on his hands and knees, thus fortunately presenting a poor target to\nthe third man coming down the hall. Ross's shoulder hit the newcomer at\nthigh level, and they tangled in a struggling mass which saved Ross's\nlife as the others burst out behind them.\n\nRoss fought grimly, his hands and feet moving in blows he was not\nconscious of planning. His opponent was no easy match and at last Ross\nwas flattened, in spite of his desperate efforts. He was whirled over,\nhis arms jerked behind him, and cold metal rings snapped about his\nwrists. Then he was rolled back, to lie blinking up at his enemies.\n\nAll three men gathered over him, barking questions which he could not\nunderstand. One of them disappeared and returned with Ross's former\ncaptive, his mouth a straight line and a light in his eyes Ross\nunderstood far better than words.\n\n\"You are the trader prisoner?\" The man who looked like Assha leaned over\nMurdock, patches of red on his tanned skin where the gag and wrist bonds\nhad been.\n\n\"I am Rossa, son of Gurdi, of the traders,\" Ross returned, meeting what\nhe read in the other's expression with a ready defiance. \"I was a\nprisoner, yes. But you did not keep me one for long then, nor shall you\nnow.\"\n\nThe man's thin upper lip lifted. \"You have done yourself ill, my young\nfriend. We have a better prison here for you, one from which you shall\nnot escape.\"\n\nHe spoke to the other men, and there was the ring of an order in his\nvoice. They pulled Ross to his feet, pushing him ahead of them. During\nthe short march Ross used his eyes, noticing things he could not\nidentify in the rooms through which they passed. Men called questions\nand at last they paused long enough, Ross firmly in the hold of the\nfur-clad guard, for the other two to put on similar garments.\n\nRoss had lost his cloak in the fight, but no fur shirt was given him. He\nshivered more and more as the chill which clung to that warren of rooms\nand halls bit into his half-clad body. He was certain of only one thing\nabout this place; he could not possibly be in the crude buildings of the\nvalley village. However, he was unable to guess where he was and how he\nhad come there.\n\nFinally, they went down a narrow room filled with bulky metal objects of\nbright scarlet or violet that gleamed weirdly and were equipped with\nrods along which all the colors of the rainbow ringed. Here was a round\ndoor, and when one of the guards used both hands to tug it open, the\ncold that swept in at them was a frigid breath that burned as it touched\nbare skin.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 11\n\n\nIt took Ross a while to learn that the dirty-white walls of this tunnel\nwhich were almost entirely opaque, with dark objects showing dimly\nthrough them here and there, were of solid ice. A black wire was hooked\noverhead and at regular intervals hung with lights which did nothing to\nbreak the sensation of glacial cold about them.\n\nRoss shuddered. Every breath he drew stung in his lungs; his bare\nshoulders and arms and the exposed section of thigh between kilt and\nboot were numb. He could only move on stiffly, pushed ahead by his\nguards when he faltered. He guessed that were he to lose his footing\nhere and surrender to the cold, he would forfeit the battle entirely and\nwith it his life.\n\nHe had no way of measuring the length of the boring through the solid\nice, but they were at last fronted by another opening, a ragged one\nwhich might have been hacked with an ax. They emerged from it into the\nwildest scene Ross had ever seen. Of course, he was familiar with ice\nand snow, but here was a world surrendered completely to the brutal\nforce of winter in a strange, abnormal way. It was a still, dead\nwhite-gray world in which nothing moved save the wind which curled the\ndrifts.\n\nHis guards covered their eyes with the murky lenses they had worn pushed\nup on their foreheads within the shelter, for above them sunlight\ndazzled on the ice crest. Ross, his eyes smarting, kept his gaze\ncentered on his feet. He was given no time to look about. A rope was\nproduced, a loop of it flipped in a noose about his throat, and he was\ntowed along like a leashed dog. Before them was a path worn in the snow,\nnot only by the passing of booted feet, but with more deeply scored\nmarks as if heavy objects had been sledded there. Ross slipped and\nstumbled in the ruts, fearing to fall lest he be dragged. The numbness\nof his body reached into his head. He was dizzy, the world about him\nmisting over now and again with a haze which arose from the long\nstretches of unbroken snow fields.\n\nTripping in a rut, he went down upon one knee, his flesh too numbed now\nto feel the additional cold of the snow, snow so hard that its crust\ndelivered a knife's cut. Unemotionally, he watched a thin line of red\ntrickle in a sluggish drop or two down the blue skin of his leg. The\nrope jerked him forward, and Ross scrambled awkwardly until one of his\ncaptors hooked a fur mitten in his belt and heaved him to his feet once\nmore.\n\nThe purpose of that trek through the snow was obscure to Ross. In fact,\nhe no longer cared, save that a hard rebel core deep inside him would\nnot let him give up as long as his legs could move and he had a scrap of\nconscious will left in him. It was more difficult to walk now. He\nskidded and went down twice more. Then, the last time he slipped, he\nsledded past the man who led him, sliding down the slope of a\nglass-slick slope. He lay at the foot, unable to get up. Through the\nhaze and deadening blanket of the cold he knew that he was being pulled\nabout, shaken, generally mishandled; but this time he could not respond.\nSomeone snapped open the rings about his wrists.\n\nThere was a call, echoing eerily across the ice. The fumbling about his\nbody changed to a tugging and once more he was sent rolling down the\nslope. But the rope was now gone from his throat, and his arms were\nfree. This time when he brought up hard against an obstruction he was\nnot followed.\n\nRoss's conscious mind--that portion of him that was Rossa, the\ntrader--was content to lie there, to yield to the lethargy born of the\nfrigid world about him. But the subconscious Ross Murdock of the Project\nprodded at him. He had always had a certain cold hatred which could\ncrystalize and become a spur. Once it had been hatred of circumstances\nand authority; now it became hatred for those who had led him into this\nwilderness with the purpose, as he knew now, of leaving him to freeze\nand die.\n\nRoss pulled his hands under him. Though there was no feeling in them,\nthey obeyed his will clumsily. He levered himself up and looked around.\nHe lay in a narrow crevicelike cut, partly walled in by earth so frozen\nas to resemble steel. Crusted over it in long streaks from above were\ntongues of ice. To remain here was to serve his captors' purpose.\n\nRoss inched his way to his feet. This opening, which was intended as his\ngrave, was not so deep as the men had thought it in their hurry to be\nrid of him. He believed that he could climb out if he could make his\nbody answer to his determination.\n\nSomehow Ross made that supreme effort and came again to the rutted path\nfrom which they had tumbled him. Even if he could, there was no sense in\ngoing along that rutted trail, for it led back to the ice-encased\nbuilding from which he had been brought. They had thrust him out to\ndie; they would not take him in.\n\nBut a road so well marked must have some goal, and in hopes that he\nmight find shelter at the other end, Ross turned to the left. The trace\ncontinued down the slope. Now the towering walls of ice and snow were\nbroken by rocky teeth as if they had bitten deep upon this land, only to\nbe gnawed in return. Rounding one of those rock fangs, Ross looked at a\nstretch of level ground. Snow lay here, but the beaten-down trail led\nstraight through it to the rounded side of a huge globe half buried in\nthe ground, a globe of dark material which could only be man-made.\n\nRoss was past caution. He must get to warmth and shelter or he was done\nfor, and he knew it. Wavering and weaving, he went on, his attention\nfixed on the door ahead--a closed oval door. With a sob of exhausted\neffort, Ross threw himself against it. The barrier gave, letting him\nfall forward into a queer glimmering radiance of bluish light.\n\nThe light rousing him because it promised more, he crawled on past\nanother door which was flattened back against the inner wall. It was\nlike making one's way down a tube. Ross paused, pressing his lifeless\nhands against his bare chest under the edge of his tunic, suddenly\nrealizing that there was warmth here. His breath did not puff out in\nfrosty streamers before him, nor did the air sear his lungs when he\nventured to draw in more than shallow gulps.\n\nWith that realization a measure of animal caution returned to him. To\nremain where he was, just inside the entrance, was to court disaster. He\nmust find a hiding place before he collapsed, for he sensed he was very\nnear the end of his ability to struggle. Hope had given him a flash of\nfalse strength, the impetus to move, and he must make the most of that\ngift.\n\nHis path ended at a wide ladder, coiling in slow curves into gloom below\nand shadows above. He sensed that he was in a building of some size. He\nwas afraid to go down, for even looking in that direction almost\nfinished his sense of balance, so he climbed up.\n\nStep by step, Ross made that painful journey, passing levels from which\nthree or four hallways ran out like the radii of a spider's web. He was\nclose to the end of his endurance when he heard a sound, echoed,\nmagnified, from below. It was someone moving. He dragged his body into\nthe fourth level where the light was very faint, hoping to crawl far\nenough into one of the passages to remain unseen from the stair. But he\nhad gone only part-way down his chosen road when he collapsed, panting,\nand fell back against the wall. His hands pawed vainly against that\nsleek surface. He was falling through it!\n\nRoss had a second, perhaps two, of stupefied wonder. Lying on a soft\nsurface, he was enfolded by a warmth which eased his bruised and frozen\nbody. There was a sharp prick in his thigh, another in his arm, and the\nworld was a hazy dream until he finally slept in the depths of\nexhaustion.\n\nThere were dreams, detailed ones, and Ross stirred uneasily as his sleep\nthinned to waking. He lay with his eyes closed, fitting together odd\nbits of--dreams? No, he was certain that they were memories. Rossa of\nthe Beaker traders and Ross Murdock of the project were again fused into\none and the same person. How it had happened he did not know, but it was\ntrue.\n\nOpening his eyes, he noticed a curved ceiling of soft blue which misted\nat the edges into gray. The restful color acted on his troubled, waking\nmind like a soothing word. For the first time since he had been struck\ndown in the night his headache was gone. He raised his hand to explore\nthat old hurt near his hairline that had been so tender only yesterday\nthat it could not bear pressure. There remained only a thin, rough line\nlike a long-healed scar, that was all.\n\nRoss lifted his head to look about him. His body lay supported in a\ncradlelike arrangement of metal, almost entirely immersed in a red\ngelatinous substance with a clean, aromatic odor. Just as he was no\nlonger cold, neither was he hungry. He felt as fit as he ever had in his\nlife. Sitting up in the cradle, he stroked the jelly away from his\nshoulders and chest. It fell from him cleanly, leaving no trace of\ngrease or dampness on his skin.\n\nThere were other fixtures in the small cylinderlike chamber besides that\nodd bed in which he had lain. Two bucket-shaped seats were placed at the\nnarrow fore part of the room and before those seats was a system of\ncontrols he could not comprehend.\n\nAs Ross swung his feet to the floor there was a click from the side\nwhich brought him around, ready for trouble. But the noise had been\ncaused by the opening of a door into a small cupboard. Inside the\ncupboard lay a fat package. Obviously this was an invitation to\ninvestigate the offering.\n\nThe package contained a much folded article of fabric, compressed and\nsealed in a transparent bag which he fumbled twice before he succeeded\nin releasing its fastening. Ross shook out a garment of material such as\nhe had never seen before. Its sheen and satin-smooth surface suggested\nmetal, but its stuff was as supple as fine silk. Color rippled across it\nwith every twist and turn he gave to the length--dark blue fading to\npale violet, accented with wavering streaks of vivid and startling\ngreen.\n\nRoss experimented with a row of small, brilliant-green studs which made\na transverse line from the right shoulder to the left hip, and they\ncame apart. As he climbed into the suit the stuff modeled to his body in\na tight but perfect fit. Across the shoulders were bands of green to\nmatch the studs, and the stockinglike tights were soled with a thick\nsubstance which formed a cushion for his feet.\n\nHe pressed the studs together, felt them lock, and then stood smoothing\nthat strange, beautiful fabric, unable to account for either it or his\nsurroundings. His head was clear; he could remember every detail of his\nflight up to the time he had fallen through the wall. And he was certain\nthat he had passed through not only one, but two, of the Red time posts.\nCould this be the third? If so, was he still a captive? Why would they\nleave him to freeze in the open country one moment and then treat him\nthis way later?\n\nHe could not connect the ice-encased building from which the Reds had\ntaken him with this one. At the sound of another soft noise Ross glanced\nover his shoulder just in time to see the cradle of jelly, from which he\nhad emerged, close in upon itself until its bulk was a third of its\nformer size. Compact as a box, it folded up against the wall.\n\nRoss, his cushioned feet making no sound, advanced to the bucket-chairs.\nBut lowering his body into one of them for a better look at what vaguely\nresembled the control of a helicopter--like the one in which he had\ntaken the first stage of his fantastic journey across space and time--he\ndid not find it comfortable. He realized that it had not been\nconstructed to accommodate a body shaped precisely like his own.\n\nA body like his own.... That jelly bath or bed or whatever it was....\nThe clothing which adapted so skillfully to his measurements....\n\nRoss leaned forward to study the devices on the control board,\nconfirming his suspicions. He had made the final jump of them all! He\nwas now in some building of that alien race upon whose existence\nMillaird and Kelgarries had staked the entire project. This was the\nsource, or one of the sources, from which the Reds were getting the\nknowledge which fitted no modern pattern.\n\nA world encased in ice and a building with strange machinery. This\nthing--a cylinder with a pilot's seat and a set of controls. Was it an\nalien place? But the jelly bath--and the rest of it.... Had his presence\nactivated that cupboard to supply him with clothing? And what had become\nof the tunic he was wearing when he entered?\n\nRoss got up to search the chamber. The bed-bath was folded against the\nwall, but there was no sign of his Beaker clothing, his belt, the hide\nboots. He could not understand his own state of well being, the lack of\nhunger and thirst.\n\nThere were two possible explanations for it all. One was that the aliens\nstill lived here and for some reason had come to his aid. The other was\nthat he stood in a place where robot machinery worked, though those who\nhad set it up were no longer there. It was difficult to separate his\nmemory of the half-buried globe he had seen from his sickness of that\nmoment. Yet he knew that he had climbed and crawled through emptiness,\nneither seeing nor hearing any other life. Now Ross restlessly paced up\nand down, seeking the door through which he must have come, but there\nwas not even a line to betray such an opening.\n\n\"I want out,\" he said aloud, standing in the center of the cramped room,\nhis fists planted on his hips, his eyes still searching for the vanished\ndoor. He had tapped, he had pushed, he had tried every possible way to\nfind it. If he could only remember how he had come in! But all he could\nrecall was leaning against a wall which moved inward and allowed him to\nfall. But where had he fallen? Into that jelly bath?\n\nRoss, stung by a sudden idea, glanced at the ceiling. It was low enough\nso that by standing on tiptoes he could drum his fingers on its surface.\nNow he moved to the place directly above where the cradle had swung\nbefore it had folded itself away.\n\nRapping and poking, his efforts were rewarded at last. The blue curve\ngave under his assault. He pushed now, rising on his toes, though in\nthat position he could exert little pressure. Then as if some faulty\ncatch had been released, the ceiling swung up so that he lost his\nfooting and would have fallen had he not caught the back of one of the\nbucket-seats.\n\nHe jumped and by hooking his hands over the edge of the opening, was\nable to work his way up and out, to face a small line of light. His\nfingers worked at that, and he opened a second door, entering a familiar\ncorridor.\n\nHolding the door open, Ross looked back, his eyes widening at what he\nsaw. For it was plain now that he had just climbed out of a machine with\nthe unmistakable outline of a snub-nosed rocket. The small flyer--or a\njet, or whatever it was--had been fitted into a pocket in the side of\nthe big structure as a ship into a berth, and it must have been set\nthere to shoot from that enclosing chamber as a bullet is shot from a\nrifle barrel. But why?\n\nRoss's imagination jumped from fact to theory. The torpedo craft could\nbe an atomic jet. All right, he had been in bad shape when he fell into\nit by chance and the bed machine had caught him as if it had been\ncreated for just such a duty. What kind of a small plane would be\nequipped with a restorative apparatus? Only one intended to handle\nemergencies, to transport badly injured living things who had to leave\nthe building in a hurry.\n\nIn other words, a lifeboat!\n\nBut why would a building need a lifeboat? That would be rather standard\nequipment for a ship. Ross stepped into the corridor and stared about\nhim with open and incredulous wonder. Could this be some form of ship,\ngrounded here, deserted and derelict, and now being plundered by the\nReds? The facts fitted! They fitted so well with all he had been able to\ndiscover that Ross was sure it was true. But he determined to prove it\nbeyond all doubt.\n\nHe closed the door leading to the lifeboat berth, but not so securely\nthat he could not open it again. That was too good a hiding place. On\nhis cushioned feet he padded back to the stairway, and he stood there\nlistening. Far below were sounds, a rasp of metal against metal, a low\nmurmur of muted voices. But from above there was nothing, so he would\nexplore above before he ventured into that other danger zone.\n\nRoss climbed, passing two more levels, to come out into a vast room with\na curving roof which must fill the whole crown of the globe. Here was\nsuch a wealth of machines, controls, things he could not understand that\nhe stood bewildered, content for the moment merely to look. There\nwere--he counted slowly--five control boards like those he had seen in\nthe small escape ship. Each of these was faced by two or three of the\nbucket-seats, only these swung in webbing. He put his hand on one, and\nit bobbed elastically.\n\nThe control boards were so complicated that the one in the lifeboat\nmight have been a child's toy in comparison. The air in the ship had\nbeen good; in the lifeboat it had held the pleasant odor of the jelly;\nbut here Ross sniffed a faint but persistent hint of corruption, of an\nold malodor.\n\nHe left the vantage point by the stairs and paced between the control\nboards and their empty swinging seats. This was the main control room,\nof that he was certain. From this point all the vast bulk beneath him\nhad been set in motion, sailed here and there. Had it been on the sea,\nor through the air? The globe shape suggested an air-borne craft. But a\ncivilization so advanced as this would surely have left some remains.\nRoss was willing to believe that he could be much farther back in time\nthan 2000 B.C., but he was still sure that traces of those who could\nbuild a thing like this would have existed in the twentieth century A.D.\n\nMaybe that was how the Reds had found this. Something they had turned up\nwithin their country--say, in Siberia, or some of the forgotten corners\nof Asia--had been a clue.\n\nHaving had little schooling other than the intensive cramming at the\nbase and his own informal education, the idea of the race who had\ncreated this ship overawed Ross more than he would admit. If the project\ncould find this, turn loose on it the guys who knew about such things....\nBut that was just what they were striving for, and he was the only\nproject man to have found the prize. Somehow, someway, he had to get\nback--out of this half-buried ship and its icebound world--back to where\nhe could find his own people. Perhaps the job was impossible, but he had\nto try. His survival was considered impossible by the men who had thrown\nhim into the crevice, but here he was. Thanks to the men who had built\nthis ship, he was alive and well.\n\nRoss sat down in one of the uncomfortable seats to think and thus\navoided immediate disaster, for he was hidden from the stairs on which\nsounded the tap of boots. A climber, maybe two, were on their way up,\nand there was no other exit from the control cabin.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 12\n\n\nRoss dropped from the web-slung chair to the floor and made himself as\nsmall as possible under the platform at the front of the cabin. Here,\nwhere there was a smaller control board and two seats placed closely\ntogether, the odd, unpleasant odor clung and became stronger to Ross's\nsenses as he waited tensely for the climbers to appear. Though he had\nsearched, there was nothing in sight even faintly resembling a weapon.\nIn a last desperate bid for freedom he crept back to the stairwell.\n\nHe had been taught a blow during his training period, one which required\na precise delivery and, he had been warned, was often fatal. He would\nuse it now. The climber was very close. A cropped head arose through the\nfloor opening, and Ross struck, knowing as his hand chopped against the\nfolds of a fur hood that he had failed.\n\nBut the impetus of that unexpected blow saved him after all. With a\nchoked cry the man disappeared, crashing down upon the one following\nhim. A scream and shouts were heard from below, and a shot ripped up the\nwell as Ross scrambled away from it. He might have delayed the final\nbattle, but they had him cornered. He faced that fact bleakly. They need\nonly sit below and let nature take its course. His session in the\nlifeboat had restored his strength, but a man could not live forever\nwithout food and water.\n\nHowever, he had bought himself perhaps a yard of time which must be put\nto work. Turning to examine the seats, Ross discovered that they could\nbe unhooked from their webbing swings. Freeing all of them, he dragged\ntheir weight to the stairwell and jammed them together to make a\nbarricade. It could not hold long against any determined push from\nbelow, but, he hoped, it would deflect bullets if some sharpshooter\ntried to wing him by ricochet. Every so often there was the crash of a\nshot and some shouting, but Ross was not going to be drawn out of cover\nby that.\n\nHe paced around the control cabin, still hunting for a weapon. The\nsymbols on the levers and buttons were meaningless to him. They made him\nfeel frustrated because he imagined that among that countless array were\nsome that might help him out of the trap if he could only guess their\nuse.\n\nOnce more he stood by the platform thinking. This was the point from\nwhich the ship had been sailed--in the air or on some now frozen sea.\nThese control boards must have given the ship's master the means not\nonly of propelling the vast bulk, but of unloading and loading cargo,\nlighting, heating, ventilation, and perhaps defense! Of course, every\ncontrol might be dead now, but he remembered that in the lifeboat the\nmachines had worked successfully, fulfilled expertly the duty for which\nthey had been constructed.\n\nThe only step remaining was to try his luck. Having made his decision,\nRoss simply shut his eyes as he had in a very short and almost forgotten\nchildhood, turned around three times, and pointed. Then he looked to\nsee where luck had directed him.\n\nHis finger indicated a board before which there had been three seats,\nand he crossed to it slowly, with a sense that once he touched the\ncontrols he might inaugurate a chain of events he could not stop. The\ncrash of a shot underlined the fact that he had no other recourse.\n\nSince the symbols meant nothing, Ross concentrated on the shapes of the\nvarious devices and chose one which vaguely resembled the type of light\nswitch he had always known. Since it was up, he pressed it down,\ncounting to twenty slowly as he waited for a reaction. Below the switch\nwas an oval button marked with two wiggles and a double dot in red. Ross\nsnapped it level with the panel, and when it did not snap back, he felt\nsomehow encouraged. When the two levers flanking that button did not\npush in or move up and down, Ross pulled them out without even waiting\nto count off.\n\nThis time he had results! A crackling of noise with a singsong rhythm,\nthe volume of which, low at first, arose to a drone filled the cabin.\nRoss, deafened by the din, twisted first one lever and then the other\nuntil he had brought the sound to a less piercing howl. But he needed\naction, not just noise; he moved from behind the first chair to the next\none. Here were five oval buttons, marked in the same vivid green as that\nwhich trimmed his clothing--two wiggles, a dot, a double bar, a pair of\nentwined circles, and a crosshatch.\n\nWhy make a choice? Recklessness bubbled to the surface, and Ross pushed\nall the buttons in rapid succession. The results were, in a measure,\nspectacular. Out of the top of the control board rose a triangle of\nscreen which steadied and stood firm while across it played a rippling\nwave of color. Meanwhile the singsong became an angry squawking as if in\nprotest.\n\nWell, he had something, even if he didn't know what it was! And he had\nalso proved that the ship was alive. However, Ross wanted more than a\nsquawk of exasperation, which was exactly what the noise had become. It\nalmost sounded, Ross decided as he listened, as if he were being\nexpertly chewed out in another language. Yes, he wanted more than a\nseries of squawks and a fanciful display of light waves on a screen.\n\nAt the section of board before the third and last seat there was less\nchoice--only two switches. As Ross flicked up the first the pattern on\nthe screen dwindled into a brown color shot with cream in which there\nwas a suggestion of a picture. Suppose one didn't put the switch all the\nway up? Ross examined the slot in which the bar moved and now noted a\nseries of tiny point marks along it. Selective? It would not do any harm\nto see. First he hurried back to the cork of chairs he had jammed into\nthe stairwell. The squawks were now coming only at intervals, and Ross\ncould hear nothing to suggest that his barrier was being forced.\n\nHe returned to the lever and moved it back two notches, standing\nopen-mouthed at the immediate result. The cream-and-brown streaks were\nmaking a picture! Moving another notch down caused the picture to\nskitter back and forth on the screen. With memories of TV tuning to\nguide him, Ross brought the other lever down to a matching position, and\nthe dim and shadowy images leaped into clear and complete focus. But the\ncolor was still brown, not the black and white he had expected.\n\nOnly, he was also looking into a face! Ross swallowed, his hand grasping\none of the strings of chair webbing for support. Perhaps because in some\nways it did resemble his own, that face was more preposterously\nnonhuman. The visage on the screen was sharply triangular with a small,\nsharply pointed chin and a jaw line running at an angle from a broad\nupper face. The skin was dark, covered largely with a soft and silky\ndown, out of which hooked a curved and shining nose set between two\nlarge round eyes. On top of that astonishing head the down rose to a\npeak not unlike a cockatoo's crest. Yet there was no mistaking the\nintelligence in those eyes, nor the other's amazement at sight of Ross.\nThey might have been staring at each other through a window.\n\nSquawk ... squeek ... squawk.... The creature in the mirror--on the\nvision plate--or outside the window--moved its absurdly small mouth in\ntime to those sounds. Ross swallowed again and automatically made\nanswer.\n\n\"Hello.\" His voice was a weak whistle, and perhaps it did not reach the\nfurry-faced one, for he continued his questions if questions they were.\nMeanwhile Ross, over his first stupefaction, tried to see something of\nthe creature's background. Though the objects were slightly out of\nfocus, he was sure he recognized fittings similar to those about him. He\nmust be in communication with another ship of the same type and one\nwhich was not deserted!\n\nFurry-face had turned his head away to squawk rapidly over his shoulder,\na shoulder which was crossed by a belt or sash with an elaborate\npattern. Then he got up from his seat and stood aside to make room for\nthe one he had summoned.\n\nIf Furry-face had been a startling surprise, Ross was now to have\nanother. The man who now faced him on the screen was totally different.\nHis skin registered as pale--cream-colored--and his face was far more\nhuman in shape, though it was hairless as was the smooth dome of his\nskull. When one became accustomed to that egg slickness, the stranger\nwas not bad-looking, and he was wearing a suit which matched the one\nRoss had taken from the lifeboat.\n\nThis one did not attempt to say anything. Instead, he stared at Ross\nlong and measuringly, his eyes growing colder and less friendly with\nevery second of that examination. Ross had resented Kelgarries back at\nthe project, but the major could not match Baldy for the sheer weight of\nunpleasant warning he could pack into a look. Ross might have been\nstartled by Furry-face, but now his stubborn streak arose to meet this\nimplied challenge. He found himself breathing hard and glaring back with\nan intensity which he hoped would get across and prove to Baldy that he\nwould not have everything his own way if he proposed to tangle with\nRoss.\n\nHis preoccupation with the stranger on the screen betrayed Ross into the\nhands of those from below. He heard their attack on the barricade too\nlate. By the time he turned around, the cork of seats was heaved up and\na gun was pointing at his middle. His hands went up in small reluctant\njerks as that threat held him where he was. Two of the fur-clad Reds\nclimbed into the control chamber.\n\nRoss recognized the leader as Ashe's double, the man he had followed\nacross time. He blinked for just an instant as he faced Ross and then\nshouted an order at his companion. The other spun Murdock around,\nbringing his hands down behind him to clamp his wrists together. Once\nagain Ross fronted the screen and saw Baldy watching the whole scene\nwith an expression suggesting that he had been shocked out of his\ncomplacent superiority.\n\n\"Ah....\" Ross's captors were staring at the screen and the unearthly man\nthere. Then one flung himself at the control panel and his hands whipped\nback and forth, restoring to utter silence both screen and room.\n\n\"What are you?\" The man who might have been Ashe spoke slowly in the\nBeaker tongue, drilling Ross with his stare as if by the force of his\nwill alone he could pull the truth out of his prisoner.\n\n\"What do you think I am?\" Ross countered. He was wearing the uniform of\nBaldy, and he had clearly established contact with the time owners of\nthis ship. Let that worry the Red!\n\nBut they did not try to answer him. At a signal he was led to the stair.\nTo descend that ladder with his hands behind him was almost impossible,\nand they had to pause at the next level to unclasp the handcuffs and let\nhim go free. Keeping a gun on him carefully, they hurried along, trying\nto push the pace while Ross delayed all he could. He realized that in\nhis recognition of the power of the gun back in the control chamber, his\nsurrender to its threat, he had betrayed his real origin. So he must\ncontinue to confuse the trail to the project in every possible way left\nto him. He was sure that this time they would not leave him in the first\nconvenient crevice.\n\nHe knew he was right when they covered him with a fur parka at the\nentrance to the ship, once more manacling his hands and dropping a noose\nleash on him.\n\nSo, they were taking him back to their post here. Well, in the post was\nthe time transporter which could return him to his own kind. It would\nbe, it must be possible to get to that! He gave his captors no more\ntrouble but trudged, outwardly dispirited, along the rutted way through\nthe snow up the slope and out of the valley.\n\nHe did manage to catch a good look at the globe-ship. More than half of\nit, he judged, was below the surface of the ground. To be so buried it\nmust either have lain there a long time or, if it were an air vessel,\ncrashed hard enough to dig itself that partial grave. Yet Ross had\nestablished contact with another ship like it, and neither of the\ncreatures he had seen were human, at least not human in any way he\nknew.\n\nRoss chewed on that as he walked. He believed that those with him were\nlooting the ship of its cargo, and by its size, that cargo must be a\nlarge one. But cargo from where? Made by what hands, what _kind_ of\nhands? Enroute to what port? And how had the Reds located the ship in\nthe first place? There were plenty of questions and very few answers.\nRoss clung to the hope that somehow he had endangered the Reds' job here\nby activating the communication system of the derelict and calling the\nattention of its probable owners to its fate.\n\nHe also believed that the owners might take steps to regain their\nproperty. Baldy had impressed him deeply during those few moments of\nsilent appraisal, and he knew he would not like to be on the receiving\nend of any retaliation from the other. Well, now he had only one chance,\nto keep the Reds guessing as long as he could and hope for some turn of\nfate which would allow him to try for the time transport. How the plate\noperated he did not know, but he had been transferred here from the\nBeaker age and if he could return to that time, escape might be\npossible. He had only to reach the river and follow it down to the sea\nwhere the sub was to make rendezvous at intervals. The odds were\noverwhelmingly against him, and Ross knew it. But there was no reason,\nhe decided, to lie down and roll over dead to please the Reds.\n\nAs they approached the post Ross realized how much skill had gone into\nits construction. It looked as if they were merely coming up to the\nouter edge of a glacier tongue. Had it not been for the track in the\nsnow, there would have been no reason to suspect that the ice covered\nanything but a thick core of its own substance. Ross was shoved through\nthe white-walled tunnel to the building beyond.\n\nHe was hurried through the chain of rooms to a door and thrust through,\nhis hands still fastened. It was dark in the cubby and colder than it\nhad been outside. Ross stood still, waiting for his eyes to adjust to\nthe gloom. It was several moments after the door had slammed shut that\nhe caught a faint thud, a dull and hollow sound.\n\n\"Who is here?\" he used the Beaker speech, determining to keep to the\nrags of his cover, which probably was a cover no longer. There was no\nreply, but after a pause that distant beat began again. Ross stepped\ncautiously forward, and by the simple method of running fullface into\nthe walls, discovered that he was in a bare cell. He also discovered\nthat the noise lay behind the left-hand wall, and he stood with his ear\nflat against it, listening. The sound did not have the regular rhythm of\na machine in use--there were odd pauses between some blows, others came\nin a quick rain. It was as if someone were digging!\n\nWere the Reds engaged in enlarging their icebound headquarters? Having\nlistened for a considerable time, Ross doubted that, for the sound was\ntoo irregular. It seemed almost as if the longer pauses were used to\ncheck up on the result of labor--was it the extent of the excavation or\nthe continued preservation of secrecy?\n\nRoss slipped down along the wall, his shoulders still resting against\nit, and rested with his head twisted so he could hear the tapping.\nMeanwhile he flexed his wrists inside the hoops which confined them, and\nfolding his hands as small as possible, tried to slip them through the\nrings. The only result was that he chafed his skin raw to no advantage.\nThey had not taken off his parka, and in spite of the chill about him,\nhe was too warm. Only that part of his body covered by the suit he had\ntaken from the ship was comfortable; he could almost believe that it\npossessed some built-in conditioning device.\n\nWith no hope of relief Ross rubbed his hands back and forth against the\nwall, scraping the hoops on his wrists. The distant pounding had ceased,\nand this time the pause lengthened into so long a period that Ross fell\nasleep, his head falling forward on his chest, his raw wrists still\npushed against the surface behind him.\n\nHe was hungry when he awoke, and with that hunger his rebellion sparked\ninto flame. Awkwardly he got to his feet and lurched along to the door\nthrough which he had been thrown, where he proceeded to kick at the\nbarrier. The cushiony stuff forming the soles of his tights muffled most\nof the force of those blows, but some noise was heard outside, for the\ndoor opened and Ross faced one of the guards.\n\n\"Food! I want to eat!\" He put into the Beaker language all the\nresentment boiling in him.\n\nThe fellow ignoring him, reached in a long arm, and nearly tossing the\nprisoner off balance, dragged him out of the cell. Ross was marched into\nanother room to face what appeared to be a tribunal. Two of the men\nthere he knew--Ashe's double and the quiet man who had questioned him\nback in the other time station. The third, clearly one of greater\nauthority, regarded Ross bleakly.\n\n\"Who are you?\" the quiet man asked.\n\n\"Rossa, son of Gurdi. And I would eat before I make talk with you. I\nhave not done any wrong that you should treat me as a barbarian who has\nstolen salt from the trading post----\"\n\n\"You are an agent,\" the leader corrected him dispassionately, \"of whom\nyou will tell us in due time. But first you shall speak of the ship, of\nwhat you found there, and why you meddled with the controls.... Wait a\nmoment before you refuse, my young friend.\" He raised his hand from his\nlap, and once again Ross faced an automatic. \"Ah, I see that you know\nwhat I hold--odd knowledge for an innocent Bronze Age trader. And\nplease have no doubts about my hesitation to use this. I shall not kill\nyou, naturally,\" the man continued, \"but there are certain wounds which\nsupply a maximum of pain and little serious damage. Remove his parka,\nKirschov.\"\n\nOnce more Ross was unmanacled, the fur stripped from him. His questioner\ncarefully studied the suit he wore under it. \"Now you will tell us\nexactly what we wish to hear.\"\n\nThere was a confidence in that statement which chilled Ross; Major\nKelgarries had displayed its like. Ashe had it in another degree, and\ncertainly it had been present in Baldy. There was no doubt that the\nspeaker meant exactly what he said. He had at his command methods which\nwould wring from his captive the full sum of what he wanted, and there\nwould be no consideration for that captive during the process.\n\nHis implied threat struck as cold as the glacial air, and Ross tried to\nmeet it with an outward show of uncracked defenses. He decided to pick\nand choose from his information, feeding them scraps to stave off the\ninevitable. Hope dies very hard, and Ross having been pushed into\ncorners long before his work at the project, had had considerable\ntraining in verbal fencing with hostile authority. He would volunteer\nnothing.... Let it be pulled from him reluctant word by word! He would\nspin it out as long as he could and hope that time might fight for him.\n\n\"You are an agent....\"\n\nRoss accepted this statement as one he would neither affirm nor deny.\n\n\"You came to spy under the cover of a barbarian trader,\" smoothly,\nwithout pause, the man changed language in mid-sentence, slipping from\nthe Beaker speech into English.\n\nBut long experience in meeting the dangerous with an expression of\ncomplete lack of comprehension was Ross's weapon now. He stared somewhat\nstupidly at his interrogator with that bewildered, boyish look he had\nso long cultivated to bemuse enemies in his past.\n\nWhether he could have held out long against the other's skill--for Ross\npossessed no illusions concerning the type of examiner he now faced--he\nwas never to know. Perhaps the drastic interruption that occurred the\nnext moment saved for Ross a measure of self-esteem.\n\nThere was a distant boom, hollow and thunderous. Underneath and around\nthem the floor, walls, and ceiling of the room moved as if they had been\npried from their setting of ice and were being rolled about by the\nexploring thumb and forefinger of some impatient giant.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 13\n\n\nRoss swayed against a guard, was fended off, and bounced against the\nwall as the man shouted words Ross could not understand. A determined\nroar from the leader brought a semblance of order, but it was plain that\nthey had not been expecting this. Ross was hustled out of the room back\nto his cell. His guards were opening the cell door when a second shock\nwas felt and he was thrust into safekeeping with no ceremony.\n\nHe half crouched against the questionable security of the wall, waiting\nthrough two more twisting earth waves, both of which were accompanied or\npreceded by dull sounds. Bombing! That last wrench was really bad. Ross\nfound himself lying on the floor, feeling tremors rippling along the\nearth. His stomach knotted convulsively with a fear unlike any he had\nknown before. It was as if the very security of the world had been\njerked from under him.\n\nBut that last explosion--if it was an explosion--appeared to be the end.\nRoss sat up gingerly after several long moments during which no more\nshocks moved the floor and walls. A line of light marked the door,\nshowing cracks where none had previously existed. Ross, not yet ready to\ntry standing erect, was heading toward it on his hands and knees when a\nsharp noise behind him brought him to a stop.\n\nThere was no light to see by, but he was certain that the scrape of\nmetal against metal sounded from the far side of the wall. He crawled\nback and put his ear to the surface. Now he heard not only that\nscraping, but an undercurrent of clicks, chippings....\n\nUnder his exploring hands the surface remained as smooth as ever,\nhowever. Then suddenly, perhaps a foot from his head, there sounded a\nrip of metal. The wall was being holed from the other side! Ross caught\na flicker of very weak light, and moving in it was the point of a tool\npulling at the smooth surface of the wall. It broke away with a brittle\nsound, and a hand holding a light reached through the aperture.\n\nRoss wondered if he should catch that wrist, but the hope that the\ndigger might just possibly be an ally kept him motionless. After the\nhand with the light whipped back beyond the wall, a wide section gave\naway and a hunched figure crawled through, followed by a second. In the\nlimited glow he saw the first tunneler clearly enough.\n\n\"Assha!\"\n\nRoss was unprepared for what followed his cry. The lean brown man moved\nwith a panther's striking speed, and Ross was forced back. A hand like a\nsteel ring on his throat shut the breath away from his bursting lungs;\nthe other's muscular body held him flat in spite of his struggles. The\nlight of the small flash glowed inches beyond his eyes as he fought to\nfill his lungs. Then the hand on his throat was gone and he gasped, a\nlittle dizzy.\n\n\"Murdock! What are you doing--?\" Ashe's clipped voice was muffled by\nanother sudden explosion. This time the earth tremors not only hurled\nthem from their feet, but seemed to run along the walls and across the\nceiling. Ross, burying his face in the crook of his arm, could not rid\nhimself of the fear that the building was being slowly twisted into\nscrap. When the shock was over he raised his head.\n\n\"What's going on?\" He heard McNeil ask.\n\n\"Attack.\" That was Ashe. \"But why, and by whom--don't ask me! You are a\nprisoner, I suppose, Murdock?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\" Ross was glad that his voice sounded normal enough.\n\nHe heard someone sigh and guessed it was McNeil. \"Another digging\nparty.\" There was tired disgust in that.\n\n\"I don't understand,\" Ross appealed to that section of the dark where\nAshe had been. \"Have you been here all the time? Are you trying to dig\nyour way out? I don't see how you can cut out of this glacier that we're\nparked under----\"\n\n\"Glacier!\" Ashe's exclamation was as explosive as the tremors. \"So we're\ninside a glacier! That explains it. Yes, we've been here--\"\n\n\"On ice!\" McNeil commented and then laughed. \"Glacier--ice--that's\nright, isn't it?\"\n\n\"We're collaborating,\" Ashe continued. \"Supplying our dear friends with\na lot of information they already have and some flights of fancy they\nnever dreamed about. However, they didn't know we had a few surprise\npackets of our own strewn about. It's amazing what the boys back at the\nproject can pack away in a belt, or between layers of hide in a boot. So\nwe've been engaged in some research of our own----\"\n\n\"But I didn't have any escape gadgets.\" Ross was struck by the\nunfairness of that.\n\n\"No,\" Ashe agreed, his voice even and cold, \"they are not entrusted to\nfirst-run men. You might slip up and use them at the wrong moment.\nHowever, you appear to have done fairly well....\"\n\nThe heat of Ross's rising anger was chilled by the noise which cracked\nover their heads, ground to them through the walls, flattened and\nthreatened them. He had thought those first shocks the end of this ice\nburrow and the world; he knew that this one was.\n\nAnd the silence that followed was as threatening in its way as the\nclamor had been. Then there was a shout, a shriek. The space of light\nnear the cell door was widening as that barrier, broken from its lock,\nswung open slowly. The fear of being trapped sent the men in that\ndirection.\n\n\"Out!\"\n\nRoss was ready enough to respond to that order, but they were stopped by\na crackle of sound that could be only one thing--rapid-fire guns.\nSomewhere in this warren a fight was in progress. Ross, remembering the\narrogant face of the bald ship's officer, wondered if this was not an\nattack in force--the aliens against the looting Reds. If so, would the\nship people distinguish between those found here. He feared not.\n\nThe room outside was clear, but not for long. As they lay watching, two\nmen backed in, then whirled to stare at each other. A voice roared from\nbeyond as if ordering them back to some post. One of them took a step\nforward in reluctant obedience, but the other grabbed his arm and pulled\nhim away. They turned to run, and an automatic cracked.\n\nThe man nearest Ross gave a queer little cough and folded forward to his\nknees, sprawling on his face. His companion stared at him wildly for an\ninstant, and then skidded into the passage beyond, escaping by inches a\nshot which clipped the door as he lunged through it.\n\nNo one followed, for outside there was a crescendo of noise--shouting,\ncries of pain, an unidentifiable hissing. Ashe darted into the room,\ntaking cover by the body. Then he came back, the fellow's gun in his\nhand, and with a jerk of his head summoned the other two. He motioned\nthem on in a direction away from the sounds of battle.\n\n\"I don't get all this,\" McNeil commented as they reached the next\npassage. \"What's going on? Mutiny? Or have our boys gotten through?\"\n\n\"It must be the ship people,\" Ross answered.\n\n\"What ship?\" Ashe caught him up swiftly.\n\n\"The big one the Reds have been looting----\"\n\n\"Ship?\" echoed McNeil. \"And _where_ did you get that rig?\" In the bright\nlight it was easy to see Ross's alien dress. McNeil fingered the elastic\nmaterial wonderingly.\n\n\"From the ship,\" Ross returned impatiently. \"But if the ship people are\nattacking, I don't think they will notice any difference between us and\nthe Reds....\"\n\nThere was a burst of ear-splitting sound. For the third time Ross was\nthrown from his feet. This time the burrow lights flickered, dimmed, and\nwent out.\n\n\"Oh, fine,\" commented McNeil bitterly out of the dark. \"I never did care\nfor blindman's buff.\"\n\n\"The transfer plate--\" Ross clung to his own plan of escape--\"if we can\nreach that--\"\n\nThe light which had served Ashe and McNeil in their tunneling clicked\non. Since the earth shocks appeared to be over for a while, they moved\non, with Ashe in the lead and McNeil bringing up the rear. Ross hoped\nAshe knew the way. The sound of fighting had died out, so one side or\nthe other must have gained the victory. They might have only a few\nmoments left to pass undetected.\n\nRoss's sense of direction was fairly acute, but he could not have gone\nso unerringly to what he sought as Ashe did. Only he did not lead them\nto the room with the glowing plate, and Ross stifled a protest as they\ncame instead to a small record room.\n\nOn a table were three spools of tape which Ashe caught up avidly,\nthrusting two in the front of his baggy tunic, passing the third to\nMcNeil. Then he sped about trying the cupboards on the walls, but all\nwere locked. His hand falling from the last latch, Ashe came back to the\ndoor where Ross waited.\n\n\"To the plate!\" Ross urged.\n\nAshe surveyed the cupboards once more regretfully. \"If we could have\njust ten minutes here----\"\n\nMcNeil snorted. \"Listen, you may yearn to be the filling in an ice\nsandwich, but I don't! Another shock and we'll be buried so deep even a\ndrill couldn't find us. Let's get out now. The kid is right about\nthat--if we still can.\"\n\nOnce more Ashe took the lead and they wove through ghostly rooms to what\nmust have been the heart of the post--the transfer point. To Ross's\nunvoiced relief the plate was glowing. He had been nagged by the fear\nthat when the lights blew out the transfer plate might also have been\naffected. He jumped for the plate.\n\nNeither Ashe nor McNeil wasted time in joining him there. As they clung\ntogether there was a cry from behind them, underlined by a shot. Ross,\nfeeling Ashe sag against him, caught him in his arms. By the reflected\nglow of the plate he saw the Red leader of the post and behind him, his\nhairless face hanging oddly bodiless in the gloom, was the alien. Were\nthose two now allies? Before Ross could be sure that he had really seen\nthem, the wracking of space time caught him and the rest of the room\nfaded away.\n\n\"... free. Get a move on!\"\n\nRoss glanced across Ashe's bowed shoulders to McNeil's excited face. The\nother was pulling at Ashe, who was only half-conscious. A stream of\nblood from a hole in his bare shoulder soaked the upper edge of his\nBeaker tunic, but as they steadied him between them, he gained some\nmeasure of awareness and moved his feet as they pulled him off the\nplate.\n\nWell, they were free if only for a few seconds, and there was no\nreception committee waiting for them. Ross gave thanks silently for\nthose two small favors. But if they were now returned to the Bronze Age\nvillage, they were still in enemy territory. With Ashe wounded, the odds\nagainst them were so high it was almost hopeless.\n\nWorking hurriedly with strips torn from McNeil's kilt, they managed to\nstop the flow of blood from Ashe's wound. Although he was still groggy,\nhe was fighting, driven by the fear which whipped them all--time was one\nof their foremost enemies. Ross, Ashe's gun in hand, kept watch on the\ntransfer plate, ready to shoot at anything appearing there.\n\n\"That will have to do!\" Ashe pulled free from McNeil. \"We must move.\" He\nhesitated, and then pulling the spools of tape from his bloodstained\ntunic, passed them to McNeil. \"You'd better carry these.\"\n\n\"All right,\" the other answered almost absently.\n\n\"Move!\" The force of that order from Ashe sent them into the corridor\nbeyond. \"The plate....\"\n\nBut the plate remained clear. And Ross noted that they must have\nreturned to the proper time, for the walls about them were the logs and\nstone of the village he remembered.\n\n\"Someone coming through?\"\n\n\"Should be--soon.\"\n\nThey fled, the hide boots of the other two making only the faintest\nwhisper of sound, Ross's foam-soled feet none at all. He could not have\nfound the door to the outer world, but again Ashe guided them, and only\nonce did they have to seek cover. At last they faced a barred door. Ashe\nleaned against the wall, McNeil supporting him, as Ross pulled free the\nlocking beam. They let themselves out into the night.\n\n\"Which way?\" McNeil asked.\n\nTo Ross's surprise Ashe did not turn to the gate in the outer stockade.\nInstead he gestured at the mountain wall in the opposite direction.\n\"They'll expect us to try for the valley pass. So we had better go up\nthe slope there.\"\n\n\"That has the look of a tough climb,\" ventured McNeil.\n\nAshe stirred. \"When it becomes too tough for me\"--his voice was dry--\"I\nshall say so, never fear.\"\n\nHe started out with some of his old ease of movement, but his companions\nclosed in on either side, ready to offer aid. Ross often wondered later\nif they could have won free of the village on their own efforts that\nnight. He was sure their resolution would have been equal to the\nattempt, but their escape would have depended upon a fabulous run of\nluck such as men seldom encounter.\n\nAs it was, they had just reached a pool of shadow beside a small hut\nsome two buildings away from the one they had fled, when the fireworks\nbegan. As if on signal the three fugitives threw themselves flat. From\nthe roof of the building at the center of the village a pencil of\nbrilliant-green light pointed straight up into the sky, and around that\nspear of radiance the roof sprouted tongues of more natural\nred-and-yellow flames. Figures shot from doors as the fire lapped down\nthe peak of the roof.\n\n\"Now!\" In spite of the rising clamor, Ashe's voice carried to his two\ncompanions.\n\nThe three sprinted for the palisade, mingling with bewildered men who\nran out of the other cabins. The waves of fire washed on, providing\nlight, too much light. Ashe and McNeil could pass as part of the crowd,\nbut Ross's unusual clothing might be easily marked.\n\nOthers were running for the wall. Ross and McNeil boosted Ashe to the\ntop, saw him over in safety. McNeil followed. Ross was just reaching to\ndraw himself up when he was enveloped in a beam of light.\n\nA high, screeching call, unlike any shout he had heard, split the\nclamor. Frantically Ross tried for a hold, knowing that he was\npresenting a perfect target for those behind. He gained the top of the\nstockade, looked down into a black block of shadow, not knowing whether\nAshe and McNeil were waiting for him or had gone ahead. Hearing that\nstrange cry again, Ross leaped blindly out into the darkness.\n\nHe landed badly, hitting hard enough to bruise, but thanks to the skill\nhe had learned for parachuting, he broke no bones. He got to his feet\nand blundered on in the general direction of the mountain Ashe had\npicked as their goal. There were others coming over the wall of the\nvillage and moving through the shadows, so he dared not call out for\nfear of alerting the enemy.\n\nThe village had been set in the widest part of the valley. Behind its\nstockade the open ground narrowed swiftly, like the point of a funnel,\nand all fugitives from the settlement had to pass through that channel\nto escape. Ross's worst fear was that he had lost contact with Ashe and\nMcNeil, and that he would never be able to pick up their trail in the\nwilderness ahead.\n\nThankful for the dark suit he wore which was protective covering in the\nnight, he twice ducked into the brush to allow parties of refugees to\npass him. Hearing them speak the guttural clicking speech he had learned\nfrom Ulffa's people, Ross deduced that they were innocent of the\nvillage's real purpose. These people were convinced they had been\nattacked by night demons. Perhaps there had only been a handful of Reds\nin that hidden retreat.\n\nRoss pulled himself up a hard climb, and pausing to catch his breath,\nlooked back. He was not overly surprised to see figures moving leisurely\nabout the village examining the cabins, perhaps in search of the\ninhabitants. Each of those searchers was clad in a form-fitting suit\nthat matched his own, and their bulbous hairless heads gleamed white in\nthe firelight. Ross was astonished to see that they passed straight\nthrough walls of flame, apparently unconcerned and unsinged by the heat.\n\nThe human beings trapped in the town wailed and ran, or lay and beat\ntheir heads and hands on the ground, supine before the invaders. Each\ncaptive was dragged back to a knot of aliens near the main building.\nSome were hurled out again into the dark, unharmed; a few others were\nretained. A sorting of prisoners was plainly in progress. There was no\nquestion that the ship people had followed through into this time, and\nthat they had their own arrangements for the Reds.\n\nRoss had no desire to learn the particulars. He started climbing again,\nfinding the pass at last. Beyond, the ground fell away again, and Ross\nwent forward into the full darkness of the night with a vast surge of\nthankfulness.\n\nFinally, he stopped simply because he was too weary, too hungry, to keep\non his feet without stumbling, and a fall in the dark on these heights\ncould be costly. Ross discovered a small hollow behind a stunted tree\nand crept into it as best he could, his heart laboring against his ribs,\na hot stab of pain cutting into his side with every breath he drew.\n\nHe awoke all at once with the snap of a fighting man who is alert to\never present danger. A hand lay warm and hard over his mouth, and above\nit his eyes met McNeil's. When he saw that Ross was awake McNeil\nwithdraw his hand. The morning sunlight was warm about them. Moving\nclumsily because of his stiff, bruised body, Ross crawled out of the\nhollow. He looked around, but McNeil stood there alone. \"Ashe?\" Ross\nquestioned him.\n\nMcNeil, showing a haggard face covered with several days' growth of\nrusty-brown beard, nodded his head toward the slope. Fumbling inside his\nkilt, he brought out something clenched in his fist and offered it to\nRoss. The latter held out his palm and McNeil covered it with a handful\nof coarse-ground grain. Just to look at the stuff made Ross long for a\ndrink, but he mouthed it and chewed, getting up to follow McNeil down\ninto the tree-grown lower slopes.\n\n\"It's not good.\" McNeil spoke jerkily, using Beaker speech. \"Ashe is out\nof his head some of the time. That hole in his shoulder is worse than we\nthought it was, and there's always the threat of infection. This whole\nwood is full of people flushed out of that blasted village! Most of\nthem--all I've seen--are natives. But they have it firmly planted in\ntheir minds now that there are devils after them. If they see you\nwearing that suit----\"\n\n\"I know, and I'd strip if I could,\" Ross agreed. \"But I'll have to get\nother clothing first; I can't run bare in this cold.\"\n\n\"That might be safer,\" McNeil growled. \"I don't know just what happened\nback there, but it certainly must have been plenty!\"\n\nRoss swallowed a very dry mouthful of grain and then stooped to scoop up\nsome leftover snow in the shadow of a tree root. It was not as\nrefreshing as a real drink, but it helped. \"You said Ashe is out of his\nhead. What do we do for him, and what are your plans?\"\n\n\"We have to reach the river, somehow. It drains to the sea, and at its\nmouth we are supposed to make contact with the sub.\"\n\nThe proposal sounded impossible to Ross, but so many impossible things\nhad happened lately he was willing to go along with the idea--as long as\nhe could. Gathering up more snow, he stuffed it into his mouth before he\nfollowed the already disappearing McNeil.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 14\n\n\n\"... that's my half of it. The rest of it you know.\" Ross held his hands\nclose to the small fire sheltered in the pit he had helped dig and\nflexed his cold-numbed fingers in the warmth.\n\nFrom across the handful of flames Ashe's eyes, too bright in a\nfever-flushed face, watched him demandingly. The fugitives had taken\ncover in an angle where the massed remains of an old avalanche provided\na cave-pocket. McNeil was off scouting in the gray drizzle of the day,\nand their escape from the village was now some forty-eight hours behind\nthem.\n\n\"So the crackpots were right, after all. They only had their times\nmixed.\" Ashe shifted on the bed of brush and leaves they had raked\ntogether for his comfort.\n\n\"I don't understand----\"\n\n\"Flying saucers,\" Ashe returned with an odd little laugh. \"It was a wild\npossibility, but it was on the books from the start. This certainly will\nmake Kelgarries turn red----\"\n\n\"Flying saucers?\"\n\nAshe must be out of his head from the fever, Ross supposed. He wondered\nwhat he should do if Ashe tried to get up and walk away. He could not\ntackle a man with a bad hole in his shoulder, nor was he certain he\ncould wrestle Ashe down in a real fight.\n\n\"That globe-ship was never built on this world. Use your head, Murdock.\nThink about your furry-faced friend and the baldy with him. Did either\nlook like normal Terrans to you?\"\n\n\"But--a spaceship!\" It was something that had so long been laughed to\nscorn. When men had failed to break into space after the initial\nexcitement of the satellite launchings, space flight had become a matter\nfor jeers. On the other hand, there was the evidence collected by his\nown eyes and ears, his own experience. The services of the lifeboat had\nbeen techniques outside of his experience.\n\n\"This was insinuated once\"--Ashe was lying flat now, gazing\nspeculatively up at the projection of logs and earth which made them a\npartial roof--\"along with a lot of other bright ideas, by a gentleman\nnamed Charles Fort, who took a lot of pleasure in pricking what he\nconsidered to be vastly over-inflated scientific pomposity. He gathered\ntogether four book loads of reported incidents of unexplainable\nhappenings which he dared the scientists of his day to explain. And one\nof his bright suggestions was that such phenomena as the vast artificial\nearthworks found in Ohio and Indiana were originally thrown up by space\ncastaways to serve as S O S signals. An intriguing idea, and now perhaps\nwe may prove it true.\"\n\n\"But if such spaceships were wrecked on this world, I still don't see\nwhy we didn't find traces of them in our own time.\"\n\n\"Because that wreck you explored was bedded in a glacial era. Do you\nhave any idea how long ago that was, counting from our own time? There\nwere at least three glacial periods--and we don't know in which one the\nReds went visiting. That age began about a million years before we were\nborn, and the last of the ice ebbed out of New York State some\nthirty-eight thousand years ago, boy. That was the early Stone Age,\nreckoning it by the scale of human development, with an extremely thin\npopulation of the first real types of man clinging to a few warmer\nfringes of wilderness.\n\n\"Climatic changes, geographical changes, all altered the face of our\ncontinents. There was a sea in Kansas; England was part of Europe. So,\neven though as many as fifty such ships were lost here, they could all\nhave been ground to bits by the ice flow, buried miles deep in quakes,\nor rusted away generations before the first really intelligent man\narrived to wonder at them. Certainly there couldn't be too many such\nwrecks to be found. What do you think this planet was, a flypaper to\nattract them?\"\n\n\"But if ships crashed here once, why didn't they later when men were\nbetter able to understand them?\" Ross countered.\n\n\"For several reasons--all of them possible and able to be fitted into\nthe fabric of history as we know it on this world. Civilizations rise,\nexist, and fall, each taking with it into the limbo of forgotten things\nsome of the discoveries which made it great. How did the Indian\ncivilizations of the New World learn to harden gold into a useable point\nfor a cutting weapon? What was the secret of building possessed by the\nancient Egyptians? Today you will find plenty of men to argue these\nproblems and half a hundred others.\n\n\"The Egyptians once had a well-traveled trade route to India. Bronze Age\ntraders opened up roads down into Africa. The Romans knew China. Then\ncame an end to each of these empires, and those trade routes were\nforgotten. To our European ancestors of the Middle Ages, China was\nalmost a legend, and the fact that the Egyptians had successfully sailed\naround the Cape of Good Hope was unknown. Suppose our space voyagers\nrepresented some star-born confederacy or empire which lived, rose to\nits highest point, and fell again into planet-bound barbarism all before\nthe first of our species painted pictures on a cave wall?\n\n\"Or take it that this world was an unlucky reef on which too many ships\nand cargoes were lost, so that our whole solar system was posted, and\nskippers of star ships thereafter avoided it? Or they might even have\nhad some rule that when a planet developed a primitive race of its own,\nit was to be left strictly alone until it discovered space flight for\nitself.\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Every one of Ashe's suppositions made good sense, and Ross was\nable to believe them. It was easier to think that both Furry-face and\nBaldy were inhabitants of another world than to think their kind existed\non this planet before his own species was born. \"But how did the Reds\nlocate that ship?\"\n\n\"Unless that information is on the tapes we were able to bring along, we\nshall probably never know,\" Ashe said drowsily. \"I might make one\nguess--the Reds have been making an all-out effort for the past hundred\nyears to open up Siberia. In some sections of that huge country there\nhave been great climatic changes almost overnight in the far past.\nMammoths have been discovered frozen in the ice with half-digested\ntropical plants in their stomach. It's as if the beasts were given some\ndeep-freeze treatment instantaneously. If in their excavations the Reds\ncame across the remains of a spaceship, remains well enough preserved\nfor them to realize what they had discovered, they might start questing\nback in time to find a better one intact at an earlier date. That theory\nfits everything we know now.\"\n\n\"But why would the aliens attack the Reds now?\"\n\n\"No ship's officers ever thought gently of pirates.\" Ashe's eyes closed.\n\nThere were questions, a flood of them, that Ross wanted to ask. He\nsmoothed the fabric on his arm, that stuff which clung so tightly to his\nskin yet kept him warm without any need for more covering. If Ashe were\nright, on what world, what kind of world, had that material been woven,\nand how far had it been brought that he could wear it now?\n\nSuddenly McNeil slid into their shelter and dropped two hares at the\nedge of the fire.\n\n\"How goes it?\" he said, as Ross began to clean them.\n\n\"Reasonably well,\" Ashe, his eyes still closed, replied to that before\nRoss could. \"How far are we from the river? And do we have company?\"\n\n\"About five miles--if we had wings.\" McNeil answered in a dry tone. \"And\nwe have company all right, lots of it!\"\n\nThat brought Ashe up, leaning forward on his good elbow. \"What kind?\"\n\n\"Not from the village.\" McNeil frowned at the fire which he fed with\neconomic handfuls of sticks. \"Something's happening on this side of the\nmountains. It looks as if there's a mass migration in progress. I\ncounted five family clans on their way west--all in just this one\nmorning.\"\n\n\"The village refugees' stories about devils might send them packing,\"\nAshe mused.\n\n\"Maybe.\" But McNeil did not sound convinced. \"The sooner we head\ndownstream, the better. And I hope the boys will have that sub waiting\nwhere they promised. We do possess one thing in our favor--the spring\nfloods are subsiding.\"\n\n\"And the high water should have plenty of raft material.\" Ashe lay back\nagain. \"We'll make those five miles tomorrow.\"\n\nMcNeil stirred uneasily and Ross, having cleaned and spitted the hares,\nswung them over the flames to broil. \"Five miles in this country,\" the\nyounger man observed, \"is a pretty good day's march\"--he did not add as\nhe wanted to--\"for a well man.\"\n\n\"I will make it,\" Ashe promised, and both listeners knew that as long as\nhis body would obey him he meant to keep that promise. They also knew\nthe futility of argument.\n\nAshe proved to be a prophet to be honored on two counts. They did make\nthe trek to the river the next day, and there was a wealth of raft\nmaterial marking the high-water level of the spring flood. The\nmigrations McNeil had reported were still in progress, and the three men\nhid twice to watch the passing of small family clans. Once a respectably\nsized tribe, including wounded men, marched across their route, seeking\na ford at the river.\n\n\"They've been badly mauled,\" McNeil whispered as they watched the people\nhuddled along the water's edge while scouts cast upstream and down,\nsearching for a ford. When they returned with the news that there was no\nford to be found, the tribesmen then sullenly went to work with flint\naxes and knives to make rafts.\n\n\"Pressure--they are on the run.\" Ashe rested his chin on his good\nforearm and studied the busy scene. \"These are not from the village.\nNotice the dress and the red paint on their faces. They're not like\nUlffa's kin either. I wouldn't say they were local at all.\"\n\n\"Reminds me of something I saw once--animals running before a forest\nfire. They can't all be looking for new hunting territory,\" McNeil\nreturned.\n\n\"Reds sweeping them out,\" Ross suggested. \"Or could the ship people--?\"\n\nAshe started to shake his head and then winced. \"I wonder....\" The\ncrease between his level brows deepened. \"The ax people!\" His voice was\nstill a whisper, but it carried a note of triumph as if he had fitted\nsome stubborn jigsaw piece into its proper place.\n\n\"Ax people?\"\n\n\"Invasion of another people from the east. They turned up in prehistory\nabout this period. Remember, Webb spoke of them. They used axes for\nweapons and tamed horses.\"\n\n\"Tartars\"--McNeil was puzzled--\"This far west?\"\n\n\"Not Tartars, no. You needn't expect those to come boiling out of middle\nAsia for some thousands of years yet. We don't know too much about the\nax people, save that they moved west from the interior plains.\nEventually they crossed to Britain; perhaps they were the ancestors of\nthe Celts who loved horses too. But in their time they were a tidal\nwave.\"\n\n\"The sooner we head downstream, the better.\" McNeil stirred restlessly,\nbut they knew that they must keep to cover until the tribesmen below\nwere gone. So they lay in hiding another night, witnessing on the next\nmorning the arrival of a smaller party of the red-painted men, again\nwith wounded among them. At the coming of this rear guard the activity\non the river bank rose close to frenzy.\n\nThe three men out of time were doubly uneasy. It was not for them to\nmerely cross the river. They had to build a raft which would be\nwater-worthy enough to take them downstream--to the sea if they were\nlucky. And to build such a sturdy raft would take time, time they did\nnot have now.\n\nIn fact, McNeil waited only until the last tribal raft was out of bow\nshot before he plunged down to the shore, Ross at his heels. Since they\nlacked even the stone tools of the tribesmen, they were at a\ndisadvantage, and Ross found he was hands and feet for Ashe, working\nunder the other's close direction. Before night closed in they had a\ngood beginning and two sets of blistered hands, as well as aching backs.\n\nWhen it was too dark to work any longer, Ashe pointed back over the\ntrack they had followed. Marking the mountain pass was a light. It\nlooked like fire, and if it was, it must be a big one for them to be\nable to sight it across this distance.\n\n\"Camp?\" McNeil wondered.\n\n\"Must be,\" Ashe agreed. \"Those who built that blaze are in such numbers\nthat they don't have to take precautions.\"\n\n\"Will they be here by tomorrow?\"\n\n\"Their scouts might, but this is early spring, and forage can't have\nbeen too good on the march. If I were the chief of that tribe, I'd turn\naside into the meadow land we skirted yesterday and let the herds graze\nfor a day, maybe more. On the other hand, if they need water----\"\n\n\"They will come straight ahead!\" McNeil finished grimly. \"And we can't\nbe here when they arrive.\"\n\nRoss stretched, grimacing at the twinge of pain in his shoulders. His\nhands smarted and throbbed, and this was just the beginning of their\ntask. If Ashe had been fit, they might have trusted to logs for support\nand swum downstream to hunt a safer place for their shipbuilding\nproject. But he knew that Ashe could not stand such an effort.\n\nRoss slept that night mainly because his body was too exhausted to let\nhim lie awake and worry. Roused in the earliest dawn by McNeil, they\nboth crawled down to the water's edge and struggled to bind stubbornly\nresisting saplings together with cords twisted from bark. They\nreinforced them at crucial points with some strings torn from their\nkilts, and strips of rabbit hide saved from their kills of the past few\ndays. They worked with hunger gnawing at them, having no time now to\nhunt. When the sun was well westward they had a clumsy craft which\nfloated sluggishly. Whether it would answer to either pole or improvised\npaddle, they could not know until they tried it.\n\nAshe, his face flushed and his skin hot to the touch, crawled on board\nand lay in the middle, on the thin heap of bedding they had put there\nfor him. He eagerly drank the water they carried to him in cupped hands\nand gave a little sigh of relief as Ross wiped his face with wet grass,\nmuttering something about Kelgarries which neither of his companions\nunderstood.\n\nMcNeil shoved off and the bobbing craft spun around dizzily as the\ncurrent pulled it free from the shore. They made a brave start, but luck\ndeserted them before they had gotten out of sight of the spot where they\nembarked.\n\nStriving to keep them in mid-current, McNeil poled furiously, but there\nwere too many rocks and snagged trees projecting from the banks. Sharing\nthat sweep of water with them, and coming up fast, was a full-sized\ntree. Twice its mat of branches caught on some snag, holding it back,\nand Ross breathed a little more freely, but it soon tore free again and\nrolled on, as menacing as a battering ram.\n\n\"Get closer to shore!\" Ross shouted the warning. Those great, twisted\nroots seemed aimed straight at the raft, and he was sure if that mass\nstruck them fairly, they would not have a chance. He dug in with his own\npole, but his hasty push did not meet bottom; the stake in his hands\nplunged into some pothole in the hidden river bed. He heard McNeil cry\nout as he toppled into the water, gasping as the murky liquid flooded\nhis mouth, choking him.\n\nHalf dazed by the shock, Ross struck out instinctively. The training at\nthe base had included swimming, but to fight water in a pool under\ncontrolled conditions was far different from fighting death in a river\nof icy water when one had already swallowed a sizable quantity of that\nflood.\n\nRoss had a half glimpse of a dark shadow. Was it the edge of the raft?\nHe caught at it desperately, skinning his hands on rough bark, dragged\non by it. The tree! He blinked his eyes to clear them of water, to try\nto see. But he could not pull his exhausted body high enough out of the\nwater to see past the screen of roots; he could only cling to the small\nsafety he had won and hope that he could rejoin the raft somewhere\ndownstream.\n\nAfter what seemed like a very long time he wedged one arm between two\nwater-washed roots, sure that the support would hold his head above the\nsurface. The chill of the stream struck at his hands and head, but the\nprotection of the alien clothing was still effective, and the rest of\nhis body was not cold. He was simply too tired to wrest himself free and\ntrust again to the haphazard chance of making shore through the\ngathering dusk.\n\nSuddenly a shock jarred his body and strained the arm he had thrust\namong the roots, wringing a cry out of him. He swung around and brushed\nfooting under the water; the tree had caught on a shore snag. Pulling\nloose from the roots, he floundered on his hands and knees, falling\nafoul of a mass of reeds whose roots were covered with stale-smelling\nmud. Like a wounded animal he dragged himself through the ooze to higher\nland, coming out upon an open meadow flooded with moonlight.\n\nFor a while he lay there, his cold, sore hands under him, plastered with\nmud and too tired to move. The sound of a sharp barking aroused him--an\nimperative, summoning bark, neither belonging to a wolf nor a hunting\nfox. He listened to it dully and then, through the ground upon which he\nlay, Ross felt as well as heard the pounding of hoofs.\n\nHoofs--horses! Horses from over the mountains--horses which might mean\ndanger. His mind seemed as dull and numb as his hands, and it took quite\na long time for him to fully realize the menace horses might bring.\n\nGetting up, Ross noticed a winged shape sweeping across the disk of the\nmoon like a silent dart. There was a single despairing squeak out of the\ngrass about a hundred feet away, and the winged shape arose again with\nits prey. Then the barking sound once more--eager, excited barking.\n\nRoss crouched back on his heels and saw a smoky brand of light moving\nalong the edge of the meadow where the band of trees began. Could it be\na herd guard? Ross knew he had to head back toward the river, but he had\nto force himself on the path, for he did not know whether he dared enter\nthe stream again. But what would happen if they hunted him with the dog?\nConfused memories of how water spoiled scent spurred him on.\n\nHaving reached the rising bank he had climbed so laboriously before,\nRoss miscalculated and tumbled back, rolling down into the mud of the\nreed bed. Mechanically he wiped the slime from his face. The tree was\nstill anchored there; by some freak the current had rammed its rooted\nend up on a sand spit.\n\nAbove in the meadow the barking sounded very close, and now it was\nanswered by a second canine belling. Ross wormed his way back through\nthe reeds to the patch of water between the tree and the bank. His few\npoor efforts at escape were almost half-consciously taken; he was too\ntired to really care now.\n\nSoon he saw a four-footed shape running along the top of the bank,\ngiving tongue. It was then joined by a larger and even more vocal\ncompanion. The dogs drew even with Ross, who wondered dully if the\nanimals could sight him in the shadows below, or whether they only\nscented his presence. Had he been able, he would have climbed over the\nlog and taken his chances in the open water, but now he could only lie\nwhere he was--the tangle of roots between him and the bank serving as a\nscreen, which would be little enough protection when men came with\ntorches.\n\nRoss was mistaken, however, for his worm's progress across the reed bed\nhad liberally besmeared his dark clothing and masked the skin of his\nface and hands, giving him better cover than any he could have\nwittingly devised. Though he felt naked and defenseless, the men who\ntrailed the hounds to the river bank, thrusting out the torch over the\nedge to light the sand spit, saw nothing but the trunk of the tree\nwedged against a mound of mud.\n\nRoss heard a confused murmur of voices broken by the clamor of the dogs.\nThen the torch was raised out of line of his dazzled eyes. He saw one of\nthe indistinct figures above cuff away a dog and move off, calling the\nhounds after it. Reluctantly, still barking, the animals went. Ross,\nwith a little sob, subsided limply in the uncomfortable net of roots,\nstill undiscovered.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 15\n\n\nIt was such a small thing, a tag of ragged stuff looped about a length\nof splintered sapling. Ross climbed stiffly over the welter of drift\ncaught on the sand spit and pulled it loose, recognizing the string even\nbefore he touched it. That square knot was of McNeil's tying, and as\nMurdock sat down weakly in the sand and mud, nervously fingering the\ntwisted cord, staring vacantly at the river, his last small hope died.\nThe raft must have broken up, and neither Ashe nor McNeil could have\nsurvived the ultimate disaster.\n\nRoss Murdock was alone, marooned in a time which was not his own, with\nlittle promise of escape. That one thought blanked out his mind with its\nown darkness. What was the use of getting up again, of trying to find\nfood for his empty stomach, or warmth and shelter?\n\nHe had always prided himself on being able to go it alone, had thought\nhimself secure in that calculated loneliness. Now that belief had been\nwashed away in the river along with most of the will power which had\nkept him going these past days. Before, there had always been some goal,\nno matter how remote. Now, he had nothing. Even if he managed to reach\nthe mouth of the river, he had no idea of where or how to summon the sub\nfrom the overseas post. All three of the time travelers might already\nhave been written off the rolls, since they had not reported in.\n\nRoss pulled the rag free from the sapling and wreathed it in a tight\nbracelet about his grimed wrist for some unexplainable reason. Worn and\ntired, he tried to think ahead. There was no chance of again contacting\nUlffa's tribe. Along with all the other woodland hunters they must have\nfled before the advance of the horsemen. No, there was no reason to go\nback, and why make the effort to advance?\n\nThe sun was hot. This was one of those spring days which foretell the\nripeness of summer. Insects buzzed in the reed banks where a green sheen\nshowed. Birds wheeled and circled in the sky, some flock disturbed,\ntheir cries reaching Ross in hoarse calls of warning.\n\nHe was still plastered with patches of dried mud and slime, the reek of\nit thick in his nostrils. Now Ross brushed at a splotch on his knee,\npicking loose flakes to expose the alien cloth of his suit underneath,\nseemingly unbefouled. All at once it became necessary to be clean again\nat least.\n\nRoss waded into the stream, stooping to splash the brown water over his\nbody and then rubbing away the resulting mud. In the sunlight the fabric\nhad a brilliant glow, as if it not only drew the light but reflected it.\nWading farther out into the water, he began to swim, not with any goal\nin view, but because it was easier than crawling back to land once more.\n\nUsing the downstream current to supplement his skill, he watched both\nbanks. He could not really hope to see either the raft or indications\nthat its passengers had won to shore, but somewhere deep inside him he\nhad not yet accepted the probable.\n\nThe effort of swimming broke through that fog of inertia which had held\nhim since he had awakened that morning. It was with a somewhat healthier\ninterest in life that Ross came ashore again on an arm of what was a bay\nor inlet angling back into the land. Here the banks of the river were\nwell above his head, and believing that he was well sheltered, he\nstripped, hanging his suit in the sunlight and letting the unusual heat\nof the day soothe his body.\n\nA raw fish, cornered in the shallows and scooped out, furnished one of\nthe best meals he had ever tasted. He had reached for the suit draped\nover a willow limb when the first and only warning that his fortunes had\nonce again changed came, swiftly, silently, and with deadly promise.\n\nOne moment the willows had moved gently in the breeze, and then a spear\nsuddenly set them all quivering. Ross, clutching the suit to him with a\nfrantic grab, skated about in the sand, going to one knee in his haste.\n\nHe found himself completely at the mercy of the two men standing on the\nbank well above him. Unlike Ulffa's people or the Beaker traders, they\nwere very tall, with heavy braids of light or sun-bleached hair swinging\nforward on their wide chests. Their leather tunics hung to mid-thigh\nabove leggings which were bound to their limbs with painted straps. Cuff\nbracelets of copper ringed their forearms, and necklaces of animal teeth\nand beads displayed their personal wealth. Ross could not remember\nhaving seen their like on any of the briefing tapes at the base.\n\nOne spear had been a warning, but a second was held ready, so Ross made\nthe age-old signal of surrender, reluctantly dropping his suit and\nraising his hands palm out and shoulder high.\n\n\"Friend?\" Ross asked in the Beaker tongue. The traders ranged far, and\nperhaps there was a chance they had had contact with this tribe.\n\nThe spear twirled, and the younger stranger effortlessly leaped down the\nbank, paddling over to Ross to pick up the suit he had dropped, holding\nit up while he made some comment to his companion. He seemed fascinated\nby the fabric, pulling and smoothing it between his hands, and Ross\nwondered if there was a chance of trading it for his own freedom.\n\nBoth men were armed, not only with the long-bladed daggers favored by\nthe Beaker folk, but also with axes. When Ross made a slight effort to\nlower his hands the man before him reached to his belt ax, growling what\nwas plainly a warning. Ross blinked, realizing that they might well\nknock him out and leave him behind, taking the suit with them.\n\nFinally, they decided in favor of including him in their loot. Throwing\nthe suit over one arm, the stranger caught Ross by the shoulder and\npushed him forward roughly. The pebbled beach was painful to Ross's\nfeet, and the breeze which whipped about him as he reached the top of\nthe bank reminded him only too forcibly of his ordeal in the glacial\nworld.\n\nMurdock was tempted to make a sudden dash out on the point of the bank\nand dive into the river, but it was already too late. The man who was\nholding the spear had moved behind him, and Ross's wrist, held in a vise\ngrip at the small of his back, kept him prisoner as he was pushed on\ninto the meadow. There three shaggy horses grazed, their nose ropes\ngathered into the hands of a third man.\n\nA sharp stone half buried in the ground changed the pattern of the day.\nRoss's heel scraped against it, and the resulting pain triggered his\nrebellion into explosion. He threw himself backward, his bruised heel\nsliding between the feet of his captor, bringing them both to the ground\nwith himself on top. The other expelled air from his lungs in a grunt\nof surprise, and Ross whipped over, one hand grasping the hilt of the\ntribesman's dagger while the other, free of that prisoning wrist-lock,\nchopped at the fellow's throat.\n\nDagger out and ready, Ross faced the men in a half crouch as he had been\ndrilled. They stared at him in open-mouthed amazement, then too late the\nspears went up. Ross placed the point of his looted weapon at the throat\nof the now quiet man by whom he knelt, and he spoke the language he had\nlearned from Ulffa's people.\n\n\"You strike--this one dies.\"\n\nThey must have read the determined purpose in his eyes, for slowly,\nreluctantly, the spears went down. Having gained so much of a victory,\nRoss dared more. \"Take--\" he motioned to the waiting horses--\"take and\ngo!\"\n\nFor a moment he thought that this time they would meet his challenge,\nbut he continued to hold the dagger above the brown throat of the man\nwho was now moaning faintly. His threat continued to register, for the\nother man shrugged the suit from his arm, left it lying on the ground,\nand retreated. Holding the nose rope of his horse, he mounted, waved the\nherder up also, and both of them rode slowly away.\n\nThe prisoner was slowly coming around, so Ross only had time to pull on\nthe suit; he had not even fastened the breast studs before those blue\neyes opened. A sunburned hand flashed to a belt, but the dagger and ax\nwhich had once hung there were now in Ross's possession. He watched the\ntribesman carefully as he finished dressing.\n\n\"What you do?\" The words were in the speech of the forest people,\ndistorted by a new accent.\n\n\"You go--\" Ross pointed to the third horse the others had left\nbehind--\"I go--\" he indicated the river--\"I take these\"--he patted the\ndagger and the ax. The other scowled.\n\n\"Not good....\"\n\nRoss laughed, a little hysterically. \"Not good you,\" he agreed,\n\"good--me!\"\n\nTo his surprise the tribesman's stiff face relaxed, and the fellow gave\na bark of laughter. He sat up, rubbing at his throat, a big grin pulling\nat the corners of his mouth.\n\n\"You--hunter?\" The man pointed northeast to the woodlands fringing the\nmountains.\n\nRoss shook his head. \"Trader, me.\"\n\n\"Trader,\" the other repeated. Then he tapped one of the wide metal cuffs\nat his wrist. \"Trade--this?\"\n\n\"That. More things.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\nRoss pointed downstream. \"By bitter water--trade there.\"\n\nThe man appeared puzzled. \"Why you here?\"\n\n\"Ride river water, like you ride,\" he said, pointing to the horse. \"Ride\non trees--many trees tied together. Trees break apart--I come here.\"\n\nThe conception of a raft voyage apparently got across, for the tribesman\nwas nodding. Getting to his feet, he walked across to take up the nose\nrope of the waiting horse. \"You come camp--Foscar. Foscar chief. He like\nyou show trick how you take Tulka, make him sleep--hold his ax, knife.\"\n\nRoss hesitated. This Tulka seemed friendly now, but would that\nfriendliness last? He shook his head. \"I go to bitter water. My chief\nthere.\"\n\nTulka was scowling again. \"You speak crooked words--your chief there!\"\nHe pointed eastward with a dramatic stretch of the arm. \"Your chief\nspeak Foscar. Say he give much these--\" he touched his copper\ncuffs--\"good knives, axes--get you back.\"\n\nRoss stared at him without understanding. Ashe? Ashe in this Foscar's\ncamp offering a reward for him? But how could that be?\n\n\"How you know my chief?\"\n\nTulka laughed, this time derisively. \"You wear shining skin--your chief\nwear shiny skin. He say find other shiny skin--give many good things to\nman who bring you back.\"\n\nShiny skin! The suit from the alien ship! Was it the ship people? Ross\nremembered the light on him as he climbed out of the Red village. He\nmust have been sighted by one of the spacemen. But why were they\nsearching for him, alerting the natives in an effort to scoop him up?\nWhat made Ross Murdock so important that they must have him? He only\nknew that he was not going to be taken if he could help it, that he had\nno desire to meet this \"chief\" who had offered treasure for his capture.\n\n\"You will come!\" Tulka went into action, his mount flashing forward\nalmost in a running leap at Ross, who stumbled back when horse and rider\nloomed over him. He swung up the ax, but it was a weapon with which he\nhad had no training, too heavy for him.\n\nAs his blow met only thin air the shoulder of the mount hit him, and\nRoss went down, avoiding by less than a finger's breadth the thud of an\nunshod hoof against his skull. Then the rider landed on him, crushing\nhim flat. A fist connected with his jaw, and for Ross the sun went out.\n\nHe found himself hanging across a support which moved with a rocking\ngait, whose pounding hurt his head, keeping him half dazed. Ross tried\nto move, but he realized that his arms were behind his back, fastened\nwrist to wrist, and a warm weight centered in the small of his spine to\nhold him face down on a horse. He could do nothing except endure the\ndiscomfort as best he could and hope for a speedy end to the gallop.\n\nOver his head passed the cackle of speech. He caught short glimpses of\nanother horse matching pace to the one that carried him. Then they swept\ninto a noisy place where the shouting of many men made a din. The horse\nstopped and Ross was pulled from its back and dropped to the trodden\ndust, to lie blinking up dizzily, trying to focus on the scene about\nhim.\n\nThey had arrived at the camp of the horsemen, whose hide tents served as\na backdrop for the fair long-haired giants and the tall women hovering\nabout to view the captive. The circle about him then broke, and men\nstood aside for a newcomer. Ross had believed that his original captors\nwere physically imposing, but this one was their master. Lying on the\nground at the chieftain's feet, Ross felt like a small and helpless\nchild.\n\nFoscar, if Foscar this was, could not yet have entered middle age, and\nthe muscles which moved along his arms and across his shoulders as he\nleaned over to study Tulka's prize made him bear-strong. Ross glared up\nat him, that same hot rage which had led to his attack on Tulka now\nurging him to the only defiance he had left--words.\n\n\"Look well, Foscar. Free me, and I would do more than _look_ at you,\" he\nsaid in the speech of the woods hunters.\n\nFoscar's blue eyes widened and he lowered a fist which could have\nswallowed in its grasp both of Ross's hands, linking those great fingers\nin the stuff of the suit and drawing the captive to his feet, with no\nsign that his act had required any effort. Even standing, Ross was a\ngood eight inches shorter than the chieftain. Yet he put up his chin and\neyed the other squarely, without giving ground.\n\n\"So--yet still my hands are tied.\" He put into that all the taunting\ninflection he could summon. His reception by Tulka had given him one\nfaint clue to the character of these people; they might be brought to\nacknowledge the worth of one who stood up to them.\n\n\"Child--\" The fist shifted from its grip on the fabric covering Ross's\nchest to his shoulder, and now under its compulsion Ross swayed back and\nforth.\n\n\"Child?\" From somewhere Ross raised that short laugh. \"Ask Tulka. I be\nno child, Foscar. Tulka's ax, Tulka's knife--they were in my hand. A\nhorse Tulka had to use to bring me down.\"\n\nFoscar regarded him intently and then grinned. \"Sharp tongue,\" he\ncommented. \"Tulka lost knife--ax? So! Ennar,\" he called over his\nshoulder, and one of the men stepped out a pace beyond his fellows.\n\nHe was shorter and much younger than his chief, with a boy's rangy\nslimness and an open, good-looking face, his eyes bright on Foscar with\na kind of eager excitement. Like the other tribesmen he was armed with\nbelt dagger and ax, and since he wore two necklaces and both cuff\nbracelets and upper armlets as did Foscar, Ross thought he must be a\nrelative of the older man.\n\n\"Child!\" Foscar clapped his hand on Ross's shoulder and then withdrew\nthe hold. \"Child!\" He indicated Ennar, who reddened. \"You take from\nEnnar ax, knife,\" Foscar ordered, \"as you took from Tulka.\" He made a\nsign, and someone cut the thongs about Ross's wrists.\n\nRoss rubbed one numbed hand against the other, setting his jaw. Foscar\nhad stung his young follower with that contemptuous \"child,\" so the boy\nwould be eager to match all his skill against the prisoner. This would\nnot be as easy as his taking Tulka by surprise. But if he refused,\nFoscar might well order him killed out of hand. He had chosen to be\ndefiant; he would have to do his best.\n\n\"Take--ax, knife--\" Foscar stepped back, waving at his men to open out a\nring encircling the two young men.\n\nRoss felt a little sick as he watched Ennar's hand go to the haft of the\nax. Nothing had been said about Ennar's not using his weapons in\ndefense, but Ross discovered that there was some sense of sportmanship\nin the tribesmen, after all. It was Tulka who pushed to the chief's side\nand said something which made Foscar roar bull-voiced at his youthful\nchampion.\n\nEnnar's hand came away from the ax hilt as if that polished wood were\nwhite-hot, and he transferred his discomfiture to Ross as the other\nunderstood. Ennar had to win now for his own pride's sake, and Ross felt\n_he_ had to win for his life. They circled warily, Ross watching his\nopponent's eyes rather than those half-closed hands held at waist level.\n\nBack at the base he had been matched with Ashe, and before Ashe with the\ntough-bodied, skilled, and merciless trainers in unarmed combat. He had\nhad beaten into his bruised flesh knowledge of holds and blows intended\nto save his skin in just such an encounter. But then he had been\nwell-fed, alert, prepared. He had not been knocked silly and then\ntransported for miles slung across a horse after days of exposure and\nhard usage. It remained to be learned--was Ross Murdock as tough as he\nalways thought himself to be? Tough or not, he was in this until he\nwon--or dropped.\n\nComments from the crowd aroused Ennar to the first definite action. He\ncharged, stooping low in a wrestler's stance, but Ross squatted even\nlower. One hand flicked to the churned dust of the ground and snapped up\nagain, sending a cloud of grit into the tribesman's face. Then their\nbodies met with a shock, and Ennar sailed over Ross's shoulder to skid\nalong the earth.\n\nHad Ross been fresh, the contest would have ended there and then in his\nfavor. But when he tried to whirl and throw himself on his opponent he\nwas too slow. Ennar was not waiting to be pinned flat, and it was Ross's\nturn to be caught at a disadvantage.\n\nA hand shot out to catch his leg just above the ankle, and once again\nRoss obeyed his teaching, falling easily at that pull, to land across\nhis opponent. Ennar, disconcerted by the too-quick success of his\nattack, was unprepared for this. Ross rolled, trying to escape\nsteel-fingered hands, his own chopping out in edgewise blows, striving\nto serve Ennar as he had Tulka.\n\nHe had to take a lot of punishment, though he managed to elude the\npowerful bear's hug in which he knew the other was laboring to engulf\nhim, a hold which would speedily crush him into submission. Clinging to\nthe methods he had been taught, he fought on, only now he knew, with a\ngrowing panic, that his best was not good enough. He was too spent to\nmake an end. Unless he had some piece of great good luck, he could only\ndelay his own defeat.\n\nFingers clawed viciously at his eyes, and Ross did what he had never\nthought to do in any fight--he snapped wolfishly, his teeth closing on\nflesh as he brought up his knee and drove it home into the body\nwriggling on his. There was a gasp of hot breath in his face as Ross\ncalled upon the last few rags of his strength, tearing loose from the\nother's slackened hold. He scrambled to one knee. Ennar was also on his\nknees, crouching like a four-legged beast ready to spring. Ross risked\neverything on a last gamble. Clasping his hands together, he raised them\nas high as he could and brought them down on the nape of the other's\nneck. Ennar sprawled forward face-down in the dust where seconds later\nRoss joined him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 16\n\n\nMurdock lay on his back, gazing up at the laced hides which stretched to\nmake the tent roofing. Having been battered just enough to feel all one\naching bruise, Ross had lost interest in the future. Only the present\nmattered, and it was a dark one. He might have fought Ennar to a\nstandstill, but in the eyes of the horsemen he had also been beaten, and\nhe had not impressed them as he had hoped. That he still lived was a\nminor wonder, but he deduced that he continued to breathe only because\nthey wanted to exchange him for the reward offered by the aliens from\nout of time, an unpleasant prospect to contemplate.\n\nHis wrists were lashed over his head to a peg driven deeply into the\nground; his ankles were bound to another. He could turn his head from\nside to side, but any further movement was impossible. He ate only bits\nof food dropped into his mouth by a dirty-fingered slave, a cowed hunter\ncaptured from a tribe overwhelmed in the migration of the horsemen.\n\n\"Ho--taker of axes!\" A toe jarred into his ribs, and Ross bit back the\ngrunt of pain which answered that rude bid for his attention. He saw in\nthe dim light Ennar's face and was savagely glad to note the\ndiscolorations about the right eye and along the jaw line, the\nsignatures left by his own skinned knuckles.\n\n\"Ho--warrior!\" Ross returned hoarsely, trying to lade that title with\nall the scorn he could summon.\n\nEnnar's hand, holding a knife, swung into his limited range of vision.\n\"To clip a sharp tongue is a good thing!\" The young tribesman grinned as\nhe knelt down beside the helpless prisoner.\n\nRoss knew a thrill of fear worse than any pain. Ennar might be about to\ndo just what he hinted! Instead, the knife swung up and Ross felt the\nsawing at the cords about his wrists, enduring the pain in the raw\ngouges they had cut in his flesh with gratitude that it was not\nmutilation which had brought Ennar to him. He knew that his arms were\nfree, but to draw them down from over his head was almost more than he\ncould do, and he lay quiet as Ennar loosed his feet.\n\n\"Up!\"\n\nWithout Ennar's hands pulling at him, Ross could not have reached his\nfeet. Nor did he stay erect once he had been raised, crashing forward on\nhis face as the other let him go, hot anger eating at him because of his\nown helplessness.\n\nIn the end, Ennar summoned two slaves who dragged Ross into the open\nwhere a council assembled about a fire. A debate was in progress,\nsometimes so heated that the speakers fingered their knife or ax hilts\nwhen they shouted their arguments. Ross could not understand their\nlanguage, but he was certain that he was the subject under discussion\nand that Foscar had the deciding vote and had not yet given the nod to\neither side.\n\nRoss sat where the slaves had dumped him, rubbing his smarting wrists,\nso deathly weary in mind and beaten in body that he was not really\ninterested in the fate they were planning for him. He was content merely\nto be free of his bonds, a small favor, but one he savored dully.\n\nHe did not know how long the debate lasted, but at length Ennar came to\nstand over him with a message. \"Your chief--he give many good things for\nyou. Foscar take you to him.\"\n\n\"My chief is not here,\" Ross repeated wearily, making a protest he knew\nthey would not heed. \"My chief sits by the bitter water and waits. He\nwill be angry if I do not come. Let Foscar fear his anger----\"\n\nEnnar laughed. \"You run from your chief. He will be happy with Foscar\nwhen you lie again under his hand. You will not like that--I think it\nso!\"\n\n\"I think so, too,\" Ross agreed silently.\n\nHe spent the rest of that night lying between the watchful Ennar and\nanother guard, though they had the humanity not to bind him again. In\nthe morning he was allowed to feed himself, and he fished chunks of\nvenison out of a stew with his unwashed fingers. But in spite of the\nmessiness, it was the best food he had eaten in days.\n\nThe trip, however, was not to be a comfortable one. He was mounted on\none of the shaggy horses, a rope run under the animal's belly to loop\none foot to the other. Fortunately, his hands were bound so he was able\nto grasp the coarse, wiry mane and keep his seat after a fashion. The\nnose rope of his mount was passed to Tulka, and Ennar rode beside him\nwith only half an eye for the path of his own horse and the balance of\nhis attention for the prisoner.\n\nThey headed northeast, with the mountains as a sharp green-and-white\ngoal against the morning sky. Though Ross's sense of direction was not\ntoo acute, he was certain that they were making for the general vicinity\nof the hidden village, which he believed the ship people had destroyed.\nHe tried to discover something of the nature of the contact which had\nbeen made between the aliens and the horsemen.\n\n\"How find other chief?\" he asked Ennar.\n\nThe young man tossed one of his braids back across his shoulder and\nturned his head to face Ross squarely. \"Your chief come our camp. Talk\nwith Foscar--two--four sleeps ago.\"\n\n\"How talk with Foscar? With hunter talk?\"\n\nFor the first time Ennar did not appear altogether certain. He scowled\nand then snapped, \"He talk--Foscar, us. We hear right words--not woods\ncreeper talk. He speak to us good.\"\n\nRoss was puzzled. How could the alien out of time speak the proper\nlanguage of a primitive tribe some thousands of years removed from his\nown era? Were the ship people also familiar with time travel? Did they\nhave their own stations of transfer? Yet their fury with the Reds had\nbeen hot. This was a complete mystery.\n\n\"This chief--he look like me?\"\n\nAgain Ennar appeared at a loss. \"He wear covering like you.\"\n\n\"But was he like me?\" persisted Ross. He didn't know what he was trying\nto learn, only that it seemed important at that moment to press home to\nat least one of the tribesmen that he _was_ different from the man who\nhad put a price on his head and to whom he was to be sold.\n\n\"Not like!\" Tulka spoke over his shoulder. \"You look like hunter\npeople--hair, eyes--Strange chief no hair on head, eyes not like----\"\n\n\"You saw him too?\" Ross demanded eagerly.\n\n\"I saw. I ride to camp--they come so. Stand on rock, call to Foscar.\nMake magic with fire--it jump up!\" He pointed his arm stiffly at a bush\nbefore them on the trail. \"They point little, little spear--fire come\nout of the ground and burn. They say burn our camp if we do not give\nthem man. We say--not have man. Then they say many good things for us if\nwe find and bring man----\"\n\n\"But they are not my people,\" Ross cut in. \"You see, I have hair, I am\nnot like them. They are bad----\"\n\n\"You may be taken in war by them--chief's slave.\" Ennar had a reply to\nthat which was logical according to the customs of his own tribe. \"They\nwant slave back--it is so.\"\n\n\"My people strong too, much magic,\" Ross pushed. \"Take me to bitter\nwater and they pay much--more than stranger chief!\"\n\nBoth tribesmen were amused. \"Where bitter water?\" asked Tulka.\n\nRoss jerked his head to the west. \"Some sleeps away----\"\n\n\"Some sleeps!\" repeated Ennar jeeringly. \"We ride some sleeps, maybe\nmany sleeps where we know not the trails--maybe no people there, maybe\nno bitter water--all things you say with split tongue so that we not\ngive you back to master. We go this way not even one sleep--find chief,\nget good things. Why we do hard thing when we can do easy?\"\n\nWhat argument could Ross offer in rebuttal to the simple logic of his\ncaptors? For a moment he raged inwardly at his own helplessness. But\nlong ago he had learned that giving away to hot fury was no good unless\none did it deliberately to impress, and then only when one had the upper\nhand. Now Ross had no hand at all.\n\nFor the most part they kept to the open, whereas Ross and the other two\nagents had skulked in wooded areas on their flight through this same\nterritory. So they approached the mountains from a different angle, and\nthough he tried, Ross could pick out no familiar landmarks. If by some\nmiracle he was able to free himself from his captors, he could only head\ndue west and hope to strike the river.\n\nAt midday their party made camp in a grove of trees by a spring. The\nweather was as unseasonably warm as it had been the day before, and\nflies, brought out of cold-weather hiding, attacked the stamping horses\nand crawled over Ross. He tried to keep them off with swings of his\nbound hands, for their bites drew blood.\n\nHaving been tumbled from his mount, he remained fastened to a tree with\na noose about his neck while the horsemen built a fire and broiled\nstrips of deer meat.\n\nIt would seem that Foscar was in no hurry to get on, since after they\nhad eaten, the men continued to lounge at ease, some even dropping off\nto sleep. When Ross counted faces he learned that Tulka and another had\nboth disappeared, possibly to contact and warn the aliens they were\ncoming.\n\nIt was midafternoon before the scouts reappeared, as unobtrusively as\nthey had gone. They went before Foscar with a report which brought the\nchief over to Ross. \"We go. Your chief waits--\"\n\nRoss raised his swollen, bitten face and made his usual protest. \"Not my\nchief!\"\n\nFoscar shrugged. \"He say so. He give good things to get you back under\nhis hand. So--he your chief!\"\n\nOnce again Ross was boosted on his mount, and bound. But this time the\nparty split into two groups as they rode off. He was with Ennar again,\njust behind Foscar, with two other guards bringing up the rear. The rest\nof the men, leading their mounts, melted into the trees. Ross watched\nthat quiet withdrawal speculatively. It argued that Foscar did not trust\nthose he was about to do business with, that he was taking certain\nprecautions of his own. Only Ross could not see how that distrust, which\nmight be only ordinary prudence on Foscar's part, could in any way be an\nadvantage for him.\n\nThey rode at a pace hardly above a walk into a small open meadow\nnarrowing at the east. Then for the first time Ross was able to place\nhimself. They were at the entrance to the valley of the village, about\na mile away from the narrow throat above which Ross had lain to spy and\nhad been captured, for he had come from the north over the spurs of\nrising ridges.\n\nRoss's horse was pulled up as Foscar drove his heel into the ribs of his\nown mount, sending it at a brisker pace toward the neck of the valley.\nThere was a blot of blue there--more than one of the aliens were\nwaiting. Ross caught his lip between his teeth and bit down on it hard.\nHe had stood up to the Reds, to Foscar's tribesmen, but he shrank from\nmeeting those strangers with an odd fear that the worst the men of his\nown species could do would be but a pale shadow to the treatment he\nmight meet at their hands.\n\nFoscar was now a toy man astride a toy horse. He halted his galloping\nmount to sit facing the handful of strangers. Ross counted four of them.\nThey seemed to be talking, though there was still a good distance\nseparating the mounted man and the blue suits.\n\nMinutes passed before Foscar's arm raised in a wave to summon the party\nguarding Ross. Ennar kicked his horse to a trot, towing Ross's mount\nbehind, the other two men thudding along more discreetly. Ross noted\nthat they were both armed with spears which they carried to the fore as\nthey rode.\n\nThey were perhaps three quarters of the way to join Foscar, and Ross\ncould see plainly the bald heads of the aliens as their faces turned in\nhis direction. Then the strangers struck. One of them raised a weapon\nshaped similarly to the automatic Ross knew, except that it was longer\nin the barrel.\n\nRoss did not know why he cried out, except that Foscar had only an ax\nand dagger which were both still sheathed at his belt. The chief sat\nvery still, and then his horse gave a swift sidewise swerve as if in\nfright. Foscar collapsed, limp, bonelessly, to the trodden turf, to lie\nunmoving face down.\n\nEnnar whooped, a cry combining defiance and despair in one. He reined up\nwith violence enough to set his horse rearing. Then, dropping his hold\non the leading rope of Ross's mount, he whirled and set off in a wild\ndash for the trees to the left. A spear lanced across Ross's shoulder,\nripping at the blue fabric, but his horse whirled to follow the other,\ntaking him out of danger of a second thrust. Having lost his\nopportunity, the man who had wielded the spear dashed by at Ennar's\nback.\n\nRoss clung to the mane with both hands. His greatest fear was that he\nmight slip from the saddle pad and since he was tied by his feet, lie\nunprotected and helpless under those dashing hoofs. Somehow he managed\nto cling to the horse's neck, his face lashed by the rough mane while\nthe animal pounded on. Had Ross been able to grasp the dangling nose\nrope, he might have had a faint chance of controlling that run, but as\nit was he could only hold fast and hope.\n\nHe had only broken glimpses of what lay ahead. Then a brilliant fire, as\nvivid as the flames which had eaten up the Red village, burst from the\nground a few yards ahead, sending the horse wild. There was more fire\nand the horse changed course through the rising smoke. Ross realized\nthat the aliens were trying to cut him off from the thin safety of the\nwoodlands. Why they didn't just shoot him as they had Foscar he could\nnot understand.\n\nThe smoke of the burning grass was thick, cutting between him and the\nwoods. Might it also provide a curtain behind which he could hope to\nescape both parties? The fire was sending the horse back toward the\nwaiting ship people. Ross could hear a confused shouting in the smoke.\nThen his mount made a miscalculation, and a tongue of red licked too\nclose. The animal screamed, dashing on blindly straight between two of\nthe blazes and away from the blue-clad men.\n\nRoss coughed, almost choking, his eyes watering as the stench of singed\nhair thickened the smoke. But he had been carried out of the fire circle\nand was shooting back into the meadowland. Mount and unwilling rider\nwere well away from the upper end of that cleared space when another\nhorse cut in from the left, matching speed to the uncontrolled animal to\nwhich Ross clung. It was one of the tribesmen riding easily.\n\nThe trick worked, for the wild race slowed to a gallop and the other\nrider, in a feat of horsemanship at which Ross marveled, leaned from his\nseat to catch the dangling nose rope, bringing the runaway against his\nown steady steed. Ross shaken, still coughing from the smoke and unable\nto sit upright, held to the mane. The gallop slowed to a rocking pace\nand finally came to a halt, both horses blowing, white-foam patches on\ntheir chests and their riders' legs.\n\nHaving made his capture, the tribesman seemed indifferent to Ross,\nlooking back instead at the wide curtain of grass smoke, frowning as he\nstudied the swift spread of the fire. Muttering to himself, he pulled\nthe lead rope and brought Ross's horse to follow in the direction from\nwhich Ennar had brought the captive less than a half hour earlier.\n\nRoss tried to think. The unexpected death of their chief might well mean\nhis own, should the tribe's desire for vengeance now be aroused. On the\nother hand, there was a faint chance that he could now better impress\nthem with the thought that he was indeed of another clan and that to aid\nhim would be to work against a common enemy.\n\nBut it was hard to plan clearly, though wits alone could save him now.\nThe parley which had ended with Foscar's murder had brought Ross a small\nmeasure of time. He was still a captive, even though of the tribesmen\nand not the unearthly strangers. Perhaps to the ship people these\nprimitives were hardly higher in scale than the forest animals.\n\nRoss did not try to talk to his present guard, who towed him into the\nwestern sun of late afternoon. They halted at last in that same small\ngrove where they had rested at noon. The tribesman fastened the mounts\nand then walked around to inspect the animal Ross had ridden. With a\ngrunt he loosened the prisoner and spilled him unceremoniously on the\nground while he examined the horse. Ross levered himself up to sight the\nmark of the burn across that roan hide where the fire had blistered the\nskin.\n\nThick handfuls of mud from the side of the spring were brought and\nplastered over the seared strip. Then, having rubbed down both animals\nwith twists of grass, the man came over to Ross, pushed him back to the\nground, and studied his left leg.\n\nRoss understood. By rights, his thigh should also have been scorched\nwhere the flame had hit, yet he had felt no pain. Now as the tribesman\nexamined him for a burn, he could not see even the faintest\ndiscoloration of the strange fabric. He remembered how the aliens had\nstrolled unconcerned through the burning village. As the suit had\ninsulated him against the cold of the ice, so it would seem that it had\nalso protected him against the fire, for which he was duly thankful. His\nescape from injury was a puzzle to the tribesman, who, failing to find\nany trace of burn on him, left Ross alone and went to sit well away from\nhis prisoner as if he feared him.\n\nThey did not have long to wait. One by one, those who had ridden in\nFoscar's company gathered at the grove. The very last to come were Ennar\nand Tulka, carrying the body of their chief. The faces of both men were\nsmeared with dust and when the others sighted the body they, too, rubbed\ndust into their cheeks, reciting a string of words and going one by one\nto touch the dead chieftain's right hand.\n\nEnnar, resigning his burden to the others, slid from his tired horse\nand stood for a long moment, his head bowed. Then he gazed straight at\nRoss and came across the tiny clearing to stand over the man of a later\ntime. The boyishness which had been a part of him when he had fought at\nFoscar's command was gone. His eyes were merciless as he leaned down to\nspeak, shaping each word with slow care so that Ross could understand\nthe promise--that frightful promise:\n\n\"Woods rat, Foscar goes to his burial fire. And he shall take a slave\nwith him to serve him beyond the sky--a slave to run at his voice, to\nshake when he thunders. Slave-dog, you shall run for Foscar beyond the\nsky, and he shall have you forever to walk upon as a man walks upon the\nearth. I, Ennar, swear that Foscar shall be sent to the chiefs in the\nsky in all honor. And that you, dog-one, shall lie at his feet in that\ngoing!\"\n\nHe did not touch Ross, but there was no doubt in Ross's mind that he\nmeant every word he spoke.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 17\n\n\nThe preparations for Foscar's funeral went on through the night. A\nwooden structure, made up of tied fagots dragged in from the woodland,\ngrew taller beyond the big tribal camp. The constant crooning wail of\nthe women in the tents produced a minor murmur of sound, enough to drive\na man to the edge of madness. Ross had been left under guard where he\ncould watch it all, a refinement of torture which he would earlier have\nbelieved too subtle for Ennar. Though the older men carried minor\ncommands among the horsemen, because Ennar was the closest of blood kin\namong the adult males, he was in charge of the coming ceremony.\n\nThe pick of the horse herd, a roan stallion, was brought in to be\npicketed near Ross as sacrifice number two, and two of the hounds were\nin turn leashed close by. Foscar, his best weapons to hand and a red\ncloak lapped about him, lay waiting on a bier. Near-by squatted the\ntribal wizard, shaking his thunder rattle and chanting in a voice which\napproached a shriek. This wild activity might have been a scene lifted\ndirectly from some tape stored at the project base. It was very\ndifficult for Ross to remember that this was reality, that he was to be\none of the main actors in the coming event, with no timely aid from\nOperation Retrograde to snatch him to safety.\n\nSometime during that nightmare he slept, his weariness of body\novercoming him. He awoke, dazed, to find a hand clutching his mop of\nhair, pulling his head up.\n\n\"You sleep--you do not fear, Foscar's dog-one?\"\n\nGroggily Ross blinked up. Fear? Sure, he was afraid. Fear, he realized\nwith a clear thrust of consciousness such as he had seldom experienced\nbefore, had always stalked beside him, slept in his bed. But he had\nnever surrendered to it, and he would not now if he could help it.\n\n\"I do not fear!\" He threw that creed into Ennar's face in one hot boast.\nHe _would_ not fear!\n\n\"We shall see if you speak so loudly when the fire bites you!\" The other\nspat, yet in that oath there was a reluctant recognition of Ross's\ncourage.\n\n\"When the fire bites....\" That sang in Ross's head. There was something\nelse--if he could only remember! Up to that moment he had kept a poor\nlittle shadow of hope. It is always impossible--he was conscious again\nwith that strange clarity of mind--for a man to face his own death\nhonestly. A man always continues to believe to the last moment of his\nlife that something will intervene to save him.\n\nThe men led the horse to the mound of fagots which was now crowned with\nFoscar's bier. The stallion went quietly, until a tall tribesman struck\ntrue with an ax, and the animal fell. The hounds were also killed and\nlaid at their dead master's feet.\n\nBut Ross was not to fare so easily. The wizard danced about him, a\nhideous figure in a beast mask, a curled fringe of dried snakeskins\nswaying from his belt. Shaking his rattle, he squawked like an angry\ncat as they pulled Ross to the stacked wood.\n\nFire--there was something about fire--if he could only remember! Ross\nstumbled and nearly fell across one leg of the dead horse they were\npropping into place. Then he remembered that tongue of flame in the\nmeadow grass which had burned the horse but not the rider. His hands and\nhis head would have no protection, but the rest of his body was covered\nwith the flame-resistant fabric of the alien suit. Could he do it? There\nwas such a slight chance, and they were already pushing him onto that\nmound, his hands tied. Ennar stooped, and bound his ankles, securing him\nto the brush.\n\nSo fastened, they left him. The tribe ringed around the pyre at a safe\ndistance, Ennar and five other men approaching from different\ndirections, torches aflame. Ross watched those blazing knots thrust into\nthe brush and heard the crackle of the fire. His eyes, hard and\nmeasuring, studied the flash of flame from dried brush to seasoned wood.\n\nA tongue of yellow-red flame licked up at him. Ross hardly dared to\nbreathe as it wreathed about his foot, his hide fetters smoldering. The\ninsulation of the suit did not cut all the heat, but it allowed him to\nstay put for the few seconds he needed to make his escape spectacular.\n\nThe flame had eaten through his foot bonds, and yet the burning\nsensation on his feet and legs was no greater than it would have been\nfrom the direct rays of a bright summer sun. Ross moistened his lips\nwith his tongue. The impact of heat on his hands and his face was\ndifferent. He leaned down, held his wrists to the flame, taking in\nstoical silence the burns which freed him.\n\nThen, as the fire curled up so that he seemed to stand in a frame of\nwrithing red banners, Ross leaped through that curtain, protecting his\nbowed head with his arms as best he could. But to the onlookers it\nseemed he passed unhurt through the heart of a roaring fire.\n\nHe kept his footing and stood facing that part of the tribal ring\ndirectly before him. He heard a cry, perhaps of fear, and a blazing\ntorch flew through the air and struck his hip. Although he felt the\nforce of the blow, the burning bits of the head merely slid down his\nthigh and leg, leaving no mark on the smooth blue fabric.\n\n\"Ahhhhhhh!\"\n\nNow the wizard capered before him, shaking his rattle to make a\ndeafening din. Ross struck out, slapping the sorcerer out of his path,\nand stooped to pick up the smoldering brand which had been thrown at\nhim. Whirling it about his head, though every movement was torture to\nhis scorched hands, he set it flaming once more. Holding it in front of\nhim as a weapon, he stalked directly at the men and women before him.\n\nThe torch was a poor enough defense against spears and axes, but Ross\ndid not care--he put into this last gamble all the determination he\ncould summon. Nor did he realize what a figure he presented to the\ntribesmen. A man who had crossed a curtain of fire without apparent\nhurt, who appeared to wash in tongues of flame without harm, and who now\ncalled upon fire in turn as a weapon, was no man but a demon!\n\nThe wall of people wavered and broke. Women screamed and ran; men\nshouted. But no one threw a spear or struck with an ax. Ross walked on,\na man possessed, looking neither to the right or left. He was in the\ncamp now, stalking toward the fire burning before Foscar's tent. He did\nnot turn aside for that either, but holding the torch high, strode\nthrough the heart of the flames, risking further burns for the sake of\ninsuring his ultimate safety.\n\nThe tribesmen melted away as he approached the last line of tents, with\nthe open land beyond. The horses of the herd, which had been driven to\nthis side to avoid the funeral pyre, were shifting nervously, the scent\nof burning making them uneasy.\n\nOnce more Ross whirled the dying torch about his head. Recalling how the\naliens had sent his horse mad, he tossed it behind him into the grass\nbetween the tents and the herd. The tinder-dry stuff caught immediately.\nNow if the men tried to ride after him, they would have trouble.\n\nWithout hindrance he walked across the meadow at the same even pace,\nnever turning to look behind. His hands were two separate worlds of\nsmarting pain; his hair and eyebrows were singed, and a finger of burn\nran along the angle of his jaw. But he was free, and he did not believe\nthat Foscar's men would be in any haste to pursue him. Somewhere before\nhim lay the river, the river which ran to the sea. Ross walked on in the\nsunny morning while behind him black smoke raised a dark beacon to the\nsky.\n\nAfterward he guessed that he must have been lightheaded for several\ndays, remembering little save the pain in his hands and the fact that it\nwas necessary to keep moving. Once he fell to his knees and buried both\nhands in the cool, moist earth where a thread of stream trickled from a\npool. The muck seemed to draw out a little of the agony while he drank\nwith a fever thirst.\n\nRoss seemed to move through a haze which lifted at intervals during\nwhich he noted his surroundings, was able to recall a little of what lay\nbehind him, and to keep to the correct route. However, the gaps of time\nin between were forever lost to him. He stumbled along the banks of a\nriver and fronted a bear fishing. The massive beast rose on its hind\nlegs, growled, and Ross walked by it uncaring, unmenaced by the puzzled\nanimal.\n\nSometimes he slept through the dark periods which marked the nights, or\nhe stumbled along under the moon, nursing his hands against his breast,\nwhimpering a little when his foot slipped and the jar of that mishap ran\nthrough his body. Once he heard singing, only to realize that it was\nhimself who sang hoarsely a melody which would be popular thousands of\nyears later in the world through which he wavered. But always Ross knew\nthat he must go on, using that thick stream of running water as a guide\nto his final goal, the sea.\n\nAfter a long while those spaces of mental clarity grew longer, appearing\ncloser together. He dug small shelled things from under stones along the\nriver and ate them avidly. Once he clubbed a rabbit and feasted. He\nsucked birds' eggs from a nest hidden among some reeds--just enough to\nkeep his gaunt body going, though his gray eyes were now set in what was\nalmost a death's-head.\n\nRoss did not know just when he realized that he was again being hunted.\nIt started with an uneasiness which differed from his previous\nfever-bred hallucinations. This was an inner pulling, a growing\ncompulsion to turn and retrace his way back toward the mountains to meet\nsomething, or someone, waiting for him on the backward path.\n\nBut Ross kept on, fearing sleep now and fighting it. For once he had\nlain down to rest and had wakened on his feet, heading back as if that\ncompulsion had the power to take over his body when his waking will was\noff guard.\n\nSo he rested, but he dared not sleep, the desire constantly tearing at\nhis will, striving to take over his weakened body and draw it back.\nPerhaps against all reason he believed that it was the aliens who were\ntrying to control him. Ross did not even venture to guess why they were\nso determined to get him. If there were tribesmen on his trail as well,\nhe did not know, but he was sure that this was now purely a war of\nwills.\n\nAs the banks of the river were giving way to marshes, he had to wade\nthrough mud and water, detouring the boggy sections. Great clouds of\nbirds whirled and shrieked their protests at his coming, and sleek water\nanimals paddled and poked curious heads out of the water as this\ntwo-legged thing walked mechanically through their green land. Always\nthat pull was with him, until Ross was more aware of fighting it than of\ntraveling.\n\nWhy did they want him to return? Why did they not follow him? Or were\nthey afraid to venture too far from where they had come through the\ntransfer? Yet the unseen rope which was tugging at him did not grow less\ntenuous as he put more distance between himself and the mountain valley.\nRoss could understand neither their motives nor their methods, but he\ncould continue to fight.\n\nThe bog was endless. He found an island and lashed himself with his suit\nbelt to the single willow which grew there, knowing that he must have\nsleep, or he could not hope to last through the next day. Then he slept,\nonly to waken cold, shaking, and afraid. Shoulder deep in a pool, he was\naware that in his sleep he must have opened the belt buckle and freed\nhimself, and only the mishap of falling into the water had brought him\naround to sanity.\n\nSomehow he got back to the tree, rehooked the buckle and twisted the\nbelt around the branches so that he was sure he could not work it free\nuntil daybreak. He lapsed into a deepening doze, and awoke, still safely\nanchored, with the morning cries of the birds. Ross considered the suit\nas he untangled the belt. Could the strange clothing be the tie by which\nthe aliens held to him? If he were to strip, leaving the garment behind,\nwould he be safe?\n\nHe tried to force open the studs across his chest, but they would not\nyield to the slight pressure which was all his seared fingers could\nexert, and when he pulled at the fabric, he was unable to tear it. So,\nstill wearing the livery of the off-world men, Ross continued on his\nway, hardly caring where he went or how. The mud plastered on him by his\nfrequent falls was some protection against the swarm of insect life his\npassing stirred into attack. However, he was able to endure a swollen\nface and slitted eyes, being far more conscious of the wrenching feeling\nwithin him than the misery of his body.\n\nThe character of the marsh began to change once more. The river was\nsplitting into a dozen smaller streams, shaping out fanlike. Looking\ndown at this from one of the marsh hillocks, Ross knew a faint surge of\nrelief. Such a place had been on the map Ashe had made them memorize. He\nwas close to the sea at last, and for the moment that was enough.\n\nA salt-sharpened wind cut at him with the force of a fist in the face.\nIn the absence of sunlight the leaden clouds overhead set a winterlike\ngloom across the countryside. To the constant sound of birdcalls Ross\ntramped heavily through small pools, beating a path through tangles of\nmarsh grass. He stole eggs from nests, sucking his nourishment eagerly\nwith no dislike for the fishy flavor, and drinking from stagnant,\nbrackish ponds.\n\nSuddenly Ross halted, at first thinking that the continuous roll of\nsound he heard was thunder. Yet the clouds overhead were massed no more\nthan before and there was no sign of lightning. Continuing on, he\nrealized that the mysterious sound was the pounding of surf--he was near\nthe sea!\n\nWilling his body to run, he weaved forward at a reeling trot, pitting\nall his energy against the incessant pull from behind. His feet skidded\nout of marsh mud into sand. Ahead of him were dark rocks surrounded by\nthe white lace of spray.\n\nRoss headed straight toward that spray until he stood knee-deep in the\ncurling, foam-edged water and felt its tug on his body almost as strong\nas that other tug upon his mind. He knelt, letting the salt water sting\nto life every cut, every burn, sputtering as it filled his mouth and\nnostrils, washing from him the slime of the bog lands. It was cold and\nbitter, but it was the sea! He had made it!\n\nRoss Murdock staggered back and sat down suddenly in the sand. Glancing\nabout, he saw that his refuge was a rough triangle between two of the\nsmall river arms, littered with the debris of the spring floods which\nhad grounded here after rejection by the sea. Although there was plenty\nof material for a fire, he had no means of kindling a flame, having lost\nthe flint all Beaker traders carried for such a purpose.\n\nThis was the sea, and against all odds he had reached it. He lay back,\nhis self-confidence restored to the point where he dared once more to\nconsider the future. He watched the swooping flight of gulls drawing\npatterns under the clouds above. For the moment he wanted nothing more\nthan to lie here and rest.\n\nBut he did not surrender to this first demand of his over-driven body\nfor long. Hungry and cold, sure that a storm was coming, he knew he had\nto build a fire--a fire on shore could provide him with the means of\nsignaling the sub. Hardly knowing why--because one part of the coastline\nwas as good as another--Ross began to walk again, threading a path in\nand out among the rocky outcrops.\n\nSo he found it, a hollow between two such windbreaks within which was a\nblackened circle of small stones holding charred wood, with some empty\nshells piled near-by. Here was unmistakable evidence of a camp! Ross\nplunged forward, thrusting a hand impetuously into the black mass of the\ndead fire. To his astonishment, he touched warmth!\n\nHardly daring to disturb those precious bits of charcoal, he dug around\nthem, then carefully blew into what appeared to be dead ashes. There was\nan answering glow! He could not have just imagined it.\n\nFrom a pile of wood that had been left behind, Ross snatched a small\ntwig, poking it at the coal after he had rubbed it into a brush on the\nrough rock. He watched, all one ache of hope. The twig caught!\n\nWith his stiff fingers so clumsy, he had to be very careful, but Ross\nhad learned patience in a hard school. Bit by bit he fed that tiny blaze\nuntil he had a real fire. Then, leaning back against the rock, he\nwatched it.\n\nIt was now obvious that the placement of the original fire had been\nchosen with care, for the outcrops gave it wind shelter. They also\nprovided a dark backdrop, partially hiding the flames on the landward\nside but undoubtedly making them more visible from the sea. The site\nseemed just right for a signal fire--but to what?\n\nRoss's hands shook slightly as he fed the blaze. It was only too clear\nwhy anyone would make a signal on this shore. McNeil--or perhaps both he\nand Ashe--had survived the breakup of the raft, after all. They had\nreached this point--abandoned no earlier than this morning, judging by\nthe life remaining in the coals--and put up the signal. Then, just as\narranged, they had been collected by the sub, by now on its way back to\nthe hidden North American post. There was no hope of any pickup for him\nnow. Just as he had believed them dead after he had found that rag on\nthe sapling, so they must have thought him finished after his fall in\nthe river. He was just a few hours too late!\n\nRoss folded his arms across his hunched knees and rested his head on\nthem. There was no possible way he could ever reach the post or his own\nkind--ever again. Thousands of miles lay between him and the temporary\ninstallation in this time.\n\nHe was so sunk in his own complete despair that he was long unaware of\nfinally being free of the pressure to turn back which had so long\nhaunted him. But as he roused to feed the fire he got to wondering. Had\nthose who hunted him given up the chase? Since he had lost his own race\nwith time, he did not really care. What did it matter?\n\nThe pile of wood was getting low, but he decided that did not matter\neither. Even so, Ross got to his feet, moving over to the drifts of\nstorm wrack to gather more. Why should he stay here by a useless beacon?\nBut somehow he could not force himself to move on, as futile as his\nvigil seemed.\n\nDragging the sun-dried, bleached limbs of long-dead trees to his half\nshelter, he piled them up, working until he laughed at the barricade he\nhad built. \"A siege!\" For the first time in days he spoke aloud. \"I\nmight be ready for a siege....\" He pulled over another branch, added it\nto his pile, and kneeled down once more by the flames.\n\nThere were fisherfolk to be found along this coast, and tomorrow when he\nwas rested he would strike south and try to find one of their primitive\nvillages. Traders would be coming into this territory now that the\nRed-inspired raiders were gone. If he could contact them....\n\nBut that spark of interest in the future died almost as soon as it was\nborn. To be a Beaker trader as an agent for the project was one thing,\nto live the role for the rest of his life was something else.\n\nRoss stood by his fire, staring out to sea for a sign he knew he would\nnever see again as long as he lived. Then, as if a spear had struck\nbetween his shoulder blades, he was attacked.\n\nThe blow was not physical, but came instead as a tearing, red pain in\nhis head, a pressure so terrible he could not move. He knew instantly\nthat behind him now lurked the ultimate danger.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 18\n\n\nRoss fought to break that hold, to turn his head, to face the peril\nwhich crept upon him now. Unlike anything he had ever met before in his\nshort lifetime, it could only have come from some alien source. This\nstrange encounter was a battle of will against will! The same rebellion\nagainst authority which had ruled his boyhood, which had pushed him into\nthe orbit of the project, stiffened him to meet this attack.\n\nHe was going to turn his head; he was going to see who stood there. He\n_was_! Inch by inch, Ross's head came around, though sweat stung his\nseared and bitten flesh, and every breath was an effort. He caught a\nhalf glimpse of the beach behind the rocks, and the stretch of sand was\nempty. Overhead the birds were gone--as if they had never existed. Or,\nas if they had been swept away by some impatient fighter, who wanted no\ndistractions from the purpose at hand.\n\nHaving successfully turned his head, Ross decided to turn his body. His\nleft hand went out, slowly, as if it moved some great weight. His palm\ngritted painfully on the rock and he savored that pain, for it pierced\nthrough the dead blanket of compulsion that was being used against him.\nDeliberately he ground his blistered skin against the stone,\nconcentrating on the sharp torment in his hand as the agony shot up his\narm. While he focused his attention on the physical pain, he could feel\nthe pressure against him weaken. Summoning all his strength, Ross swung\naround in a movement which was only a shadow of his former feline grace.\n\nThe beach was still empty, except for the piles of driftwood, the rocks,\nand the other things he had originally found there. Yet he knew that\nsomething was waiting to pounce. Having discovered that for him pain was\na defense weapon, he had that one resource. If they took him, it would\nbe after besting him in a fight.\n\nEven as he made this decision, Ross was conscious of a curious weakening\nof the force bent upon him. It was as if his opponents had been\nsurprised, either at his simple actions of the past few seconds or at\nhis determination. Ross leaped upon that surprise, adding it to his\nstock of unseen weapons.\n\nHe leaned forward, still grinding his torn hand against the rock as a\nsteadying influence, took up a length of dried wood, and thrust its end\ninto the fire. Having once used fire to save himself, he was ready and\nwilling to do it again, although at the same time, another part of him\nshrank from what he intended.\n\nHolding his improvised torch breast-high, Ross stared across it,\nsearching the land for the faintest sign of his enemies. In spite of the\nfire and the light he held before him, the dusk prevented him from\nseeing too far. Behind him the crash of the surf could have covered the\nnoise of a marching army.\n\n\"Come and get me!\"\n\nHe whirled his brand into bursting life and then hurled it straight into\nthe drift among the dunes. He was grabbing for a second brand almost\nbefore the blazing head of the first had fallen into the twisted,\nbleached roots of a dead tree.\n\nHe stood tense, a second torch now kindled in his hand. The sharp vise\nof another's will which had nipped him so tightly a moment ago was\neasing, slowly disappearing as water might trickle away. Yet he could\nnot believe that this small act of defiance had so daunted his unseen\nopponent as to make him give up the struggle this easily. It was more\nlikely the pause of a wrestler seeking for a deadlier grip.\n\nThe brand in his hand--Ross's second line of defense--was a weapon he\nwas loath to use, but would use if he were forced to it. He kept his\nhand mercilessly flat against the rock as a reminder and a spur.\n\nFire twisted and crackled among the driftwood where the first torch had\nlodged, providing a flickering light yards from where he stood. He was\ngrateful for it in the gloom of the gathering storm. If they would only\ncome to open war before the rain struck....\n\nRoss sheltered his torch with his body as spray, driven inward from the\nsea, spattered his shoulders and his back. If it rained, he would lose\nwhat small advantage the fire gave him, but then he would find some\nother way to meet them. They would neither break him nor take him, even\nif he had to wade into the sea and swim out into the lash of the cold\nnorthern waves until he could not move his tired limbs any longer.\n\nOnce again that steel-edge will struck at Ross, probing his\nstubbornness, assaulting his mind. He whirled the torch, brought the\nscorching breath of the flame across the hand resting on the rock.\nUnable to control his own cry of protest, he was not sure he had the\nfortitude to repeat such an act.\n\nHe had won again! The pressure had fallen away in a flick, almost as if\nsome current had been snapped off. Through the red curtain of his\ntorment Ross sensed a surprise and disbelief. He was unaware that in\nthis queer duel he was using both a power of will and a depth of\nperception he had never known he possessed. Because of his daring, he\nhad shaken his opponents as no physical attack could have affected them.\n\n\"Come and get me!\" He shouted again at the barren shoreline where the\nfire ate at the drift and nothing stirred, yet something very much alive\nand conscious lay hidden. This time there was more than simple challenge\nin Ross's demand--there was a note of triumph.\n\nThe spray whipped by him, striking at his fire, at the brand he held.\nLet the sea water put both out! He would find another way of fighting.\nHe was certain of that, and he sensed that those out there knew it too\nand were troubled.\n\nThe fire was being driven by the wind along the crisscross lines of\nbone-white wood left high on the beach, forming a wall of flame between\nhim and the interior, not, however, an insurmountable barrier to\nwhatever lurked there.\n\nAgain Ross leaned against the rock, studying the length of beach. Had he\nbeen wrong in thinking that they were within the range of his voice? The\npower they had used might carry over a greater distance.\n\n\"Yahhhh--\" Instead of a demand, he now voiced a taunting cry, screaming\nhis defiance. Some wild madness had been transmitted to him by the\nwinds, the roaring sea, his own pain. Ready to face the worst they could\nsend against him, he tried to hurl that thought back at them as they had\nstruck with their united will at him. No answer came to his challenge,\nno rise to counter-attack.\n\nMoving away from the rock, Ross began to walk forward toward the burning\ndrift, his torch ready in his hand. \"I am here!\" he shouted into the\nwind. \"Come out--face me!\"\n\nIt was then that he saw those who had tracked him. Two tall thin\nfigures, wearing dark clothes, were standing quietly watching him, their\neyes dark holes in the white ovals of their faces.\n\nRoss halted. Though they were separated by yards of sand and rock and a\nburning barrier, he could feel the force they wielded. The nature of\nthat force had changed, however. Once it had struck with a vigorous\nspear point; now it formed a shield of protection. Ross could not break\nthrough that shield, and they dared not drop it. A stalemate existed\nbetween them in this strange battle, the like of which Ross's world had\nnot known before.\n\nHe watched those expressionless white faces, trying to find some reply\nto the deadlock. There flashed into his mind the certainty that while he\nlived and moved, and they lived and moved, this struggle, this unending\npursuit, would continue. For some mysterious reason they wanted to have\nhim under their control, but that was never going to happen if they all\nhad to remain here on this strip of water-washed sand until they starved\nto death! Ross tried to drive that thought across to them.\n\n\"Murrrrdock!\" That croaking cry borne out of the sea by the wind might\nalmost have come from the bill of a sea bird.\n\n\"Murrrrdock!\"\n\nRoss spun around. Visibility had been drastically curtailed by the\nlowering clouds and the dashing spray, but he could see a round dark\nthing bobbing on the waves. The sub? A raft?\n\nSensing a movement behind him, Ross wheeled about as one of the alien\nfigures leaped the blazing drift, heedless of the flames, and ran\nlight-footedly toward him in what could only be an all-out attempt at\ncapture. The man had ready a weapon like the one that had felled Foscar.\nRoss threw himself at his opponent in a reckless dive, falling on him\nwith a smashing impact.\n\nIn Ross's grasp the alien's body was fragile, but he moved fluidly as\nMurdock fought to break his grip on the hand weapon and pin him to the\nsand. Ross was too intent upon his own part of the struggle to heed the\nsounds of a shot over his head and a thin, wailing cry. He slammed his\nopponent's hand against a stone, and the white face, inches away from\nhis own, twisted silently with pain.\n\nFumbling for a better hold, Ross was sent rolling. He came down on his\nleft hand with a force which brought tears to his eyes and stopped him\njust long enough for the other to regain his feet.\n\nThe blue-suited man sprinted back to the body of his fellow where it lay\nby the drift. He slung his unconscious comrade over the barrier with\nmore ease than Ross would have believed possible and vaulted the barrier\nafter him. Ross, half crouched on the sand, felt unusually light and\nempty. The strange tie which had drawn and held him to the strangers had\nbeen broken.\n\n\"Murdock!\"\n\nA rubber raft rode in on the waves, two men aboard it. Ross got up,\npulling at the studs of his suit with his right hand. He could believe\nin what he saw now--the sub had not left, after all. The two men running\ntoward him through the dusk were of his own kind.\n\n\"Murdock!\"\n\nIt did not seem at all strange that Kelgarries reached him first. Ross,\ncaught up in this dream, appealed to the major for aid with the studs.\nIf the strangers from the ship did trace him by the suit, they were not\ngoing to follow the sub back to the post and serve the project as they\nhad the Reds.\n\n\"Got--to--get--this--off--\" He pulled the words out one by one, tugging\nfrantically at the stubborn studs. \"They can trace this and follow\nus--\"\n\nKelgarries needed no better explanation. Ripping loose the fastenings,\nhe pulled the clinging fabric from Ross, sending him reeling with pain\nas he pulled the left sleeve down the younger man's arm.\n\nThe wind and spray were ice on his body as they dragged him down to the\nraft, bundling him aboard. He did not at all remember their arrival on\nboard the sub. He was lying in the vibrating heart of the undersea ship\nwhen he opened his eyes to see Kelgarries regarding him intently. Ashe,\na coat of bandage about his shoulder and chest, lay on a neighboring\nbunk. McNeil stood watching a medical corpsman lay out supplies.\n\n\"He needs a shot,\" the medic was saying as Ross blinked at the major.\n\n\"You left the suit--back there?\" Ross demanded.\n\n\"We did. What's this about them tracing you by it? Who was tracing you?\"\n\n\"Men from the space ship. That's the only way they could have trailed me\ndown the river.\" He was finding it difficult to talk, and the protesting\nmedic kept waving a needle in his direction, but somehow in bursts of\nhalf-finished sentences Ross got out his story--Foscar's death, his own\nescape from the chief's funeral pyre, and the weird duel of wills back\non the beach. Even as he poured it out he thought how unlikely most of\nit must sound. Yet Kelgarries appeared to accept every word, and there\nwas no expression of disbelief on Ashe's face.\n\n\"So that's how you got those burns,\" said the major slowly when Ross had\nfinished his story. \"Deliberately searing your hand in the fire to break\ntheir hold--\" He crashed his fist against the wall of the tiny cabin and\nthen, when Ross winced at the jar, he hurriedly uncurled those fingers\nto press Ross's shoulder with a surprisingly warm and gentle touch. \"Put\nhim to sleep,\" he ordered the medic. \"He deserves about a month of it,\nI should judge. I think he has brought us a bigger slice of the future\nthan we had hoped for....\"\n\nRoss felt the prick of the needle and then nothing more. Even when he\nwas carried ashore at the post and later when he was transported into\nhis proper time, he did not awaken. He only approached a strange dreamy\nstate in which he ate and drowsed, not caring for the world beyond his\nown bunk.\n\nBut there came a day when he did care, sitting up to demand food with a\ngreat deal of his old self-assertion. The doctor looked him over,\npermitting him to get out of bed and try out his legs. They were\nexceedingly uncooperative at first, and Ross was glad he had tried to\nmove only from his bunk to a waiting chair.\n\n\"Visitors welcome?\"\n\nRoss looked up eagerly and then smiled, somewhat hesitatingly, at Ashe.\nThe older man wore his arm in a sling but otherwise seemed his usual\nimperturbable self.\n\n\"Ashe, tell me what happened. Are we back at the main base? What about\nthe Reds? We weren't traced by the ship people, were we?\"\n\nAshe laughed. \"Did Doc just wind you up to let you spin, Ross? Yes, this\nis home, sweet home. As for the rest--well, it is a long story, and we\nare still picking up pieces of it here and there.\"\n\nRoss pointed to the bunk in invitation. \"Can you tell me what is known?\"\nHe was still somewhat at a loss, his old secret awe of Ashe tempering\nhis outward show of eagerness. Ross still feared one of those snubs the\nother so well knew how to deliver to the bumptious. But Ashe did come in\nand sit down, none of his old formality now in evidence.\n\n\"You have been a surprise package, Murdock.\" His observation had some\nof the ring of the old Ashe, but there was no withdrawal behind the\nwords. \"Rather a busy lad, weren't you, after you were bumped off into\nthat river?\"\n\nRoss's reply was a grimace. \"You heard all about that!\" He had no time\nfor his own adventures, already receding into a past which made them\nboth dim and unimportant. \"What happened to you--and to the\nproject--and----\"\n\n\"One thing at a time, and don't rush your fences.\" Ashe was surveying\nhim with an odd intentness which Ross could not understand. He continued\nto explain in his \"instructor\" voice. \"We made it down the river--how,\ndon't ask me. That was something of a 'project' in itself,\" he laughed.\n\"The raft came apart piece by piece, and we waded most of the last\ncouple of miles, I think. I'm none too clear on the details; you'll have\nto get those out of McNeil, who was still among those present then.\nOther than that, we cannot compete with your adventures. We built a\nsignal fire and sat by it toasting our shins for a few days, until the\nsub came to collect us----\"\n\n\"And took you off.\" Ross experienced a fleeting return of that hollow\nfeeling he had known on the shore when the still-warm coals of the\nsignal fire had told him the story of his too-late arrival.\n\n\"And took us off. But Kelgarries agreed to spin out our waiting period\nfor another twenty-four hours, in case you did manage to survive that\ntoss you took into the river. Then we sighted your spectacular display\nof fireworks on the beach, and the rest was easy.\"\n\n\"The ship people didn't trace us back to post?\"\n\n\"Not that we know of. Anyway, we've closed down the post on that time\nlevel. You might be interested in a very peculiar tale our modern agents\nhave picked up, floating over and under the iron curtain. A blast went\noff in the Baltic region of this time, wiping some installation clean\noff the map. The Reds have kept quiet as to the nature of the explosion\nand the exact place where it occurred.\"\n\n\"The aliens followed _them_ all the way up to this time!\"--Ross half\nrose from the chair--\"But why? And why did they trail me?\"\n\n\"That we can only guess. But I don't believe that they were moved by any\nprivate vengeance for the looting of their derelict. There is some more\nimperative reason why they don't want us to find or use anything from\none of their cargoes----\"\n\n\"But they were in power thousands of years ago. Maybe they and their\nworlds are gone now. Why should things we do today matter to them?\"\n\n\"Well, it does matter, and in some very important way. And we have to\nlearn that reason.\"\n\n\"How?\" Ross looked down at his left hand, encased in a mitten of bandage\nunder which he very gingerly tried to stretch a finger. Maybe he should\nhave been eager to welcome another meeting with the ship people, but if\nhe were truly honest, he had to admit that he did not. He glanced up,\nsure that Ashe had read all that hesitation and scorned him for it. But\nthere was no sign that his discomfiture had been noticed.\n\n\"By doing some looting of our own,\" Ashe answered. \"Those tapes we\nbrought back are going to be a big help. More than one derelict was\nlocated. We were right in our surmise that the Reds first discovered the\nremains of one in Siberia, but it was in no condition to be explored.\nThey already had the basic idea of the time traveler, so they applied it\nto the hunting down of other ships, with several way stops to throw\npeople like us off the scent. So they found an intact ship, and also\nseveral others. At least three are on _this_ side of the Atlantic where\nthey couldn't get at them very well. Those we can deal with now----\"\n\n\"Won't the aliens be waiting for us to try that?\"\n\n\"As far as we can discover they don't know where any of these ships\ncrashed. Either there were no survivors, or passengers and crew took off\nin lifeboats while they were still in space. They might never have known\nof the Reds' activities if you hadn't triggered that communicator on the\nderelict.\"\n\nRoss was reduced to a small boy who badly needed an alibi for some piece\nof juvenile mischief. \"I didn't mean to.\" That excuse sounded so feeble\nthat he was surprised into a laugh, only to see Ashe grinning back at\nhim.\n\n\"Seeing as how your action also put a very effective spike in the\nopposition's wheel, you are freely forgiven. Anyway, you have also\nprovided us with a pretty good idea of what we may be up against with\nthe aliens, and we'll be prepared for that next time.\"\n\n\"Then there will be a next time?\"\n\n\"We are calling in all time agents, concentrating our forces in the\nright period. Yes, there will be a next time. We have to learn just what\nthey are trying so hard to protect.\"\n\n\"What do you think it is?\"\n\n\"Space!\" Ashe spoke the word softly as if he relished the promise it\nheld.\n\n\"Space?\"\n\n\"That ship you explored was a derelict from a galactic fleet, but it was\na ship and it used the principle of space flight. Do you understand now?\nIn these lost ships lies the secret which will make us free of all the\nstars! We must claim it.\"\n\n\"Can we----?\"\n\n\"Can _we_?\" Ashe was laughing at Ross again with his eyes, though his\nface remained sober. \"Then _you_ still want to be counted in on this\ngame?\"\n\nRoss looked down again at his bandaged hand and remembered swiftly so\nmany things--the coast of Britain on a misty morning, the excitement of\nprowling the alien ship, the fight with Ennar, even the long nightmare\nof his flight down the river, and lastly, the exultation he had tasted\nwhen he had faced the alien and had locked wills--to hold steady. He\nknew that he could not, would not, give up what he had found here in the\nservice of the project as long as it was in his power to cling to it.\n\n\"Yes.\" It was a very simple answer, but when his eyes met Ashe's, Ross\nknew that it would serve better than any solemn oath.\n\n\n\n\nSECOND PRINTING $3.00\n\nThe Time Traders\n\nby ANDRE NORTON\n\n\nIf it is possible to conquer space, then perhaps it is also possible to\nconquer time. At least that was the theory American scientists were\nexploring in an effort to explain the new sources of knowledge the\nRussians possessed. Perhaps Russian scientists had discovered how to\ntransport themselves back in time in order to learn long-forgotten\nsecrets of the past.\n\nThat was why young Ross Murdock, above average in intelligence but a\nbelligerently independent nonconformist, found himself on a \"hush-hush\"\ngovernment project at a secret base in the Arctic. The very qualities\nthat made him a menace in civilized society were valuable traits in a\nman who must successfully act the part of a merchant trader of the\nBeaker people during the Bronze Age.\n\nFor once they were transferred by time machine to the remote Baltic\nregion where the Russian post was located, Ross and his partner Ashe\nwere swept into a fantastic action-filled adventure involving Russians,\nsuperstitious prehistoric men, and the aliens of a lost galactic\ncivilization that demanded every ounce of courage the Americans\npossessed.\n\nAndre Norton's earlier books, _Star Born_ and _The Stars Are Ours!_,\nhave made this author one of the most popular writers in the\nscience-fiction field.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n*** END: FULL LICENSE ***\n"}
