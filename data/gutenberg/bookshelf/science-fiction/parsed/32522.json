Extensive research did not uncover\n    any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was\n    renewed.\n\n\n\n\n    A human brain-controlled spacecraft would mean mechanical\n    perfection. This was accomplished, and something unforeseen: a\n    strange entity called--\n\n\n\n\nMr. Spaceship\n\n\n_By_\n\n\n_Philip K. Dick_\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nKramer leaned back. \"You can see the situation. How can we deal with a\nfactor like this? The perfect variable.\"\n\n\"Perfect? Prediction should still be possible. A living thing still\nacts from necessity, the same as inanimate material. But the\ncause-effect chain is more subtle; there are more factors to be\nconsidered. The difference is quantitative, I think. The reaction of\nthe living organism parallels natural causation, but with greater\ncomplexity.\"\n\nGross and Kramer looked up at the board plates, suspended on the wall,\nstill dripping, the images hardening into place. Kramer traced a line\nwith his pencil.\n\n\"See that? It's a pseudopodium. They're alive, and so far, a weapon we\ncan't beat. No mechanical system can compete with that, simple or\nintricate. We'll have to scrap the Johnson Control and find something\nelse.\"\n\n\"Meanwhile the war continues as it is. Stalemate. Checkmate. They\ncan't get to us, and we can't get through their living minefield.\"\n\nKramer nodded. \"It's a perfect defense, for them. But there still\nmight be one answer.\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"Wait a minute.\" Kramer turned to his rocket expert, sitting with the\ncharts and files. \"The heavy cruiser that returned this week. It\ndidn't actually touch, did it? It came close but there was no\ncontact.\"\n\n\"Correct.\" The expert nodded. \"The mine was twenty miles off. The\ncruiser was in space-drive, moving directly toward Proxima,\nline-straight, using the Johnson Control, of course. It had deflected\na quarter of an hour earlier for reasons unknown. Later it resumed its\ncourse. That was when they got it.\"\n\n\"It shifted,\" Kramer said. \"But not enough. The mine was coming along\nafter it, trailing it. It's the same old story, but I wonder about the\ncontact.\"\n\n\"Here's our theory,\" the expert said. \"We keep looking for contact, a\ntrigger in the pseudopodium. But more likely we're witnessing a\npsychological phenomena, a decision without any physical correlative.\nWe're watching for something that isn't there. The mine _decides_ to\nblow up. It sees our ship, approaches, and then decides.\"\n\n\"Thanks.\" Kramer turned to Gross. \"Well, that confirms what I'm\nsaying. How can a ship guided by automatic relays escape a mine that\ndecides to explode? The whole theory of mine penetration is that you\nmust avoid tripping the trigger. But here the trigger is a state of\nmind in a complicated, developed life-form.\"\n\n\"The belt is fifty thousand miles deep,\" Gross added. \"It solves\nanother problem for them, repair and maintenance. The damn things\nreproduce, fill up the spaces by spawning into them. I wonder what\nthey feed on?\"\n\n\"Probably the remains of our first-line. The big cruisers must be a\ndelicacy. It's a game of wits, between a living creature and a ship\npiloted by automatic relays. The ship always loses.\" Kramer opened a\nfolder. \"I'll tell you what I suggest.\"\n\n\"Go on,\" Gross said. \"I've already heard ten solutions today. What's\nyours?\"\n\n\"Mine is very simple. These creatures are superior to any mechanical\nsystem, but only because they're alive. Almost any other life-form\ncould compete with them, any higher life-form. If the yuks can put out\nliving mines to protect their planets, we ought to be able to harness\nsome of our own life-forms in a similar way. Let's make use of the\nsame weapon ourselves.\"\n\n\"Which life-form do you propose to use?\"\n\n\"I think the human brain is the most agile of known living forms. Do\nyou know of any better?\"\n\n\"But no human being can withstand outspace travel. A human pilot would\nbe dead of heart failure long before the ship got anywhere near\nProxima.\"\n\n\"But we don't need the whole body,\" Kramer said. \"We need only the\nbrain.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"The problem is to find a person of high intelligence who would\ncontribute, in the same manner that eyes and arms are volunteered.\"\n\n\"But a brain....\"\n\n\"Technically, it could be done. Brains have been transferred several\ntimes, when body destruction made it necessary. Of course, to a\nspaceship, to a heavy outspace cruiser, instead of an artificial body,\nthat's new.\"\n\nThe room was silent.\n\n\"It's quite an idea,\" Gross said slowly. His heavy square face\ntwisted. \"But even supposing it might work, the big question is\n_whose_ brain?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was all very confusing, the reasons for the war, the nature of the\nenemy. The Yucconae had been contacted on one of the outlying planets\nof Proxima Centauri. At the approach of the Terran ship, a host of\ndark slim pencils had lifted abruptly and shot off into the distance.\nThe first real encounter came between three of the yuk pencils and a\nsingle exploration ship from Terra. No Terrans survived. After that it\nwas all out war, with no holds barred.\n\nBoth sides feverishly constructed defense rings around their systems.\nOf the two, the Yucconae belt was the better. The ring around Proxima\nwas a living ring, superior to anything Terra could throw against it.\nThe standard equipment by which Terran ships were guided in outspace,\nthe Johnson Control, was not adequate. Something more was needed.\nAutomatic relays were not good enough.\n\n--Not good at all, Kramer thought to himself, as he stood looking down\nthe hillside at the work going on below him. A warm wind blew along\nthe hill, rustling the weeds and grass. At the bottom, in the valley,\nthe mechanics had almost finished; the last elements of the reflex\nsystem had been removed from the ship and crated up.\n\nAll that was needed now was the new core, the new central key that\nwould take the place of the mechanical system. A human brain, the\nbrain of an intelligent, wary human being. But would the human being\npart with it? That was the problem.\n\nKramer turned. Two people were approaching him along the road, a man\nand a woman. The man was Gross, expressionless, heavy-set, walking\nwith dignity. The woman was--He stared in surprise and growing\nannoyance. It was Dolores, his wife. Since they'd separated he had\nseen little of her....\n\n\"Kramer,\" Gross said. \"Look who I ran into. Come back down with us.\nWe're going into town.\"\n\n\"Hello, Phil,\" Dolores said. \"Well, aren't you glad to see me?\"\n\nHe nodded. \"How have you been? You're looking fine.\" She was still\npretty and slender in her uniform, the blue-grey of Internal Security,\nGross' organization.\n\n\"Thanks.\" She smiled. \"You seem to be doing all right, too. Commander\nGross tells me that you're responsible for this project, Operation\nHead, as they call it. Whose head have you decided on?\"\n\n\"That's the problem.\" Kramer lit a cigarette. \"This ship is to be\nequipped with a human brain instead of the Johnson system. We've\nconstructed special draining baths for the brain, electronic relays to\ncatch the impulses and magnify them, a continual feeding duct that\nsupplies the living cells with everything they need. But--\"\n\n\"But we still haven't got the brain itself,\" Gross finished. They\nbegan to walk back toward the car. \"If we can get that we'll be ready\nfor the tests.\"\n\n\"Will the brain remain alive?\" Dolores asked. \"Is it actually going to\nlive as part of the ship?\"\n\n\"It will be alive, but not conscious. Very little life is actually\nconscious. Animals, trees, insects are quick in their responses, but\nthey aren't conscious. In this process of ours the individual\npersonality, the ego, will cease. We only need the response ability,\nnothing more.\"\n\nDolores shuddered. \"How terrible!\"\n\n\"In time of war everything must be tried,\" Kramer said absently. \"If\none life sacrificed will end the war it's worth it. This ship might\nget through. A couple more like it and there wouldn't be any more\nwar.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey got into the car. As they drove down the road, Gross said, \"Have\nyou thought of anyone yet?\"\n\nKramer shook his head. \"That's out of my line.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I'm an engineer. It's not in my department.\"\n\n\"But all this was your idea.\"\n\n\"My work ends there.\"\n\nGross was staring at him oddly. Kramer shifted uneasily.\n\n\"Then who is supposed to do it?\" Gross said. \"I can have my\norganization prepare examinations of various kinds, to determine\nfitness, that kind of thing--\"\n\n\"Listen, Phil,\" Dolores said suddenly.\n\n\"What?\"\n\nShe turned toward him. \"I have an idea. Do you remember that professor\nwe had in college. Michael Thomas?\"\n\nKramer nodded.\n\n\"I wonder if he's still alive.\" Dolores frowned. \"If he is he must be\nawfully old.\"\n\n\"Why, Dolores?\" Gross asked.\n\n\"Perhaps an old person who didn't have much time left, but whose mind\nwas still clear and sharp--\"\n\n\"Professor Thomas.\" Kramer rubbed his jaw. \"He certainly was a wise\nold duck. But could he still be alive? He must have been seventy,\nthen.\"\n\n\"We could find that out,\" Gross said. \"I could make a routine check.\"\n\n\"What do you think?\" Dolores said. \"If any human mind could outwit\nthose creatures--\"\n\n\"I don't like the idea,\" Kramer said. In his mind an image had\nappeared, the image of an old man sitting behind a desk, his bright\ngentle eyes moving about the classroom. The old man leaning forward, a\nthin hand raised--\n\n\"Keep him out of this,\" Kramer said.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Gross looked at him curiously.\n\n\"It's because _I_ suggested it,\" Dolores said.\n\n\"No.\" Kramer shook his head. \"It's not that. I didn't expect anything\nlike this, somebody I knew, a man I studied under. I remember him very\nclearly. He was a very distinct personality.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Gross said. \"He sounds fine.\"\n\n\"We can't do it. We're asking his death!\"\n\n\"This is war,\" Gross said, \"and war doesn't wait on the needs of the\nindividual. You said that yourself. Surely he'll volunteer; we can\nkeep it on that basis.\"\n\n\"He may already be dead,\" Dolores murmured.\n\n\"We'll find that out,\" Gross said speeding up the car. They drove the\nrest of the way in silence.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor a long time the two of them stood studying the small wood house,\novergrown with ivy, set back on the lot behind an enormous oak. The\nlittle town was silent and sleepy; once in awhile a car moved slowly\nalong the distant highway, but that was all.\n\n\"This is the place,\" Gross said to Kramer. He folded his arms. \"Quite\na quaint little house.\"\n\nKramer said nothing. The two Security Agents behind them were\nexpressionless.\n\nGross started toward the gate. \"Let's go. According to the check he's\nstill alive, but very sick. His mind is agile, however. That seems to\nbe certain. It's said he doesn't leave the house. A woman takes care\nof his needs. He's very frail.\"\n\nThey went down the stone walk and up onto the porch. Gross rang the\nbell. They waited. After a time they heard slow footsteps. The door\nopened. An elderly woman in a shapeless wrapper studied them\nimpassively.\n\n\"Security,\" Gross said, showing his card. \"We wish to see Professor\nThomas.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Government business.\" He glanced at Kramer.\n\nKramer stepped forward. \"I was a pupil of the Professor's,\" he said.\n\"I'm sure he won't mind seeing us.\"\n\nThe woman hesitated uncertainly. Gross stepped into the doorway. \"All\nright, mother. This is war time. We can't stand out here.\"\n\nThe two Security agents followed him, and Kramer came reluctantly\nbehind, closing the door. Gross stalked down the hall until he came to\nan open door. He stopped, looking in. Kramer could see the white\ncorner of a bed, a wooden post and the edge of a dresser.\n\nHe joined Gross.\n\nIn the dark room a withered old man lay, propped up on endless\npillows. At first it seemed as if he were asleep; there was no motion\nor sign of life. But after a time Kramer saw with a faint shock that\nthe old man was watching them intently, his eyes fixed on them,\nunmoving, unwinking.\n\n\"Professor Thomas?\" Gross said. \"I'm Commander Gross of Security. This\nman with me is perhaps known to you--\"\n\nThe faded eyes fixed on Kramer.\n\n\"I know him. Philip Kramer.... You've grown heavier, boy.\" The voice\nwas feeble, the rustle of dry ashes. \"Is it true you're married now?\"\n\n\"Yes. I married Dolores French. You remember her.\" Kramer came toward\nthe bed. \"But we're separated. It didn't work out very well. Our\ncareers--\"\n\n\"What we came here about, Professor,\" Gross began, but Kramer cut him\noff with an impatient wave.\n\n\"Let me talk. Can't you and your men get out of here long enough to\nlet me talk to him?\"\n\nGross swallowed. \"All right, Kramer.\" He nodded to the two men. The\nthree of them left the room, going out into the hall and closing the\ndoor after them.\n\nThe old man in the bed watched Kramer silently. \"I don't think much of\nhim,\" he said at last. \"I've seen his type before. What's he want?\"\n\n\"Nothing. He just came along. Can I sit down?\" Kramer found a stiff\nupright chair beside the bed. \"If I'm bothering you--\"\n\n\"No. I'm glad to see you again, Philip. After so long. I'm sorry your\nmarriage didn't work out.\"\n\n\"How have you been?\"\n\n\"I've been very ill. I'm afraid that my moment on the world's stage\nhas almost ended.\" The ancient eyes studied the younger man\nreflectively. \"You look as if you have been doing well. Like everyone\nelse I thought highly of. You've gone to the top in this society.\"\n\nKramer smiled. Then he became serious. \"Professor, there's a project\nwe're working on that I want to talk to you about. It's the first ray\nof hope we've had in this whole war. If it works, we may be able to\ncrack the yuk defenses, get some ships into their system. If we can do\nthat the war might be brought to an end.\"\n\n\"Go on. Tell me about it, if you wish.\"\n\n\"It's a long shot, this project. It may not work at all, but we have\nto give it a try.\"\n\n\"It's obvious that you came here because of it,\" Professor Thomas\nmurmured. \"I'm becoming curious. Go on.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter Kramer finished the old man lay back in the bed without\nspeaking. At last he sighed.\n\n\"I understand. A human mind, taken out of a human body.\" He sat up a\nlittle, looking at Kramer. \"I suppose you're thinking of me.\"\n\nKramer said nothing.\n\n\"Before I make my decision I want to see the papers on this, the\ntheory and outline of construction. I'm not sure I like it.--For\nreasons of my own, I mean. But I want to look at the material. If\nyou'll do that--\"\n\n\"Certainly.\" Kramer stood up and went to the door. Gross and the two\nSecurity Agents were standing outside, waiting tensely. \"Gross, come\ninside.\"\n\nThey filed into the room.\n\n\"Give the Professor the papers,\" Kramer said. \"He wants to study them\nbefore deciding.\"\n\nGross brought the file out of his coat pocket, a manila envelope. He\nhanded it to the old man on the bed. \"Here it is, Professor. You're\nwelcome to examine it. Will you give us your answer as soon as\npossible? We're very anxious to begin, of course.\"\n\n\"I'll give you my answer when I've decided.\" He took the envelope with\na thin, trembling hand. \"My decision depends on what I find out from\nthese papers. If I don't like what I find, then I will not become\ninvolved with this work in any shape or form.\" He opened the envelope\nwith shaking hands. \"I'm looking for one thing.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" Gross said.\n\n\"That's my affair. Leave me a number by which I can reach you when\nI've decided.\"\n\nSilently, Gross put his card down on the dresser. As they went out\nProfessor Thomas was already reading the first of the papers, the\noutline of the theory.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKramer sat across from Dale Winter, his second in line. \"What then?\"\nWinter said.\n\n\"He's going to contact us.\" Kramer scratched with a drawing pen on\nsome paper. \"I don't know what to think.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Winter's good-natured face was puzzled.\n\n\"Look.\" Kramer stood up, pacing back and forth, his hands in his\nuniform pockets. \"He was my teacher in college. I respected him as a\nman, as well as a teacher. He was more than a voice, a talking book.\nHe was a person, a calm, kindly person I could look up to. I always\nwanted to be like him, someday. Now look at me.\"\n\n\"So?\"\n\n\"Look at what I'm asking. I'm asking for his life, as if he were some\nkind of laboratory animal kept around in a cage, not a man, a teacher\nat all.\"\n\n\"Do you think he'll do it?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\" Kramer went to the window. He stood looking out. \"In a\nway, I hope not.\"\n\n\"But if he doesn't--\"\n\n\"Then we'll have to find somebody else. I know. There would be\nsomebody else. Why did Dolores have to--\"\n\nThe vidphone rang. Kramer pressed the button.\n\n\"This is Gross.\" The heavy features formed. \"The old man called me.\nProfessor Thomas.\"\n\n\"What did he say?\" He knew; he could tell already, by the sound of\nGross' voice.\n\n\"He said he'd do it. I was a little surprised myself, but apparently\nhe means it. We've already made arrangements for his admission to the\nhospital. His lawyer is drawing up the statement of liability.\"\n\nKramer only half heard. He nodded wearily. \"All right. I'm glad. I\nsuppose we can go ahead, then.\"\n\n\"You don't sound very glad.\"\n\n\"I wonder why he decided to go ahead with it.\"\n\n\"He was very certain about it.\" Gross sounded pleased. \"He called me\nquite early. I was still in bed. You know, this calls for a\ncelebration.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Kramer said. \"It sure does.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nToward the middle of August the project neared completion. They stood\noutside in the hot autumn heat, looking up at the sleek metal sides of\nthe ship.\n\nGross thumped the metal with his hand. \"Well, it won't be long. We can\nbegin the test any time.\"\n\n\"Tell us more about this,\" an officer in gold braid said. \"It's such\nan unusual concept.\"\n\n\"Is there really a human brain inside the ship?\" a dignitary asked, a\nsmall man in a rumpled suit. \"And the brain is actually alive?\"\n\n\"Gentlemen, this ship is guided by a living brain instead of the usual\nJohnson relay-control system. But the brain is not conscious. It will\nfunction by reflex only. The practical difference between it and the\nJohnson system is this: a human brain is far more intricate than any\nman-made structure, and its ability to adapt itself to a situation, to\nrespond to danger, is far beyond anything that could be artificially\nbuilt.\"\n\nGross paused, cocking his ear. The turbines of the ship were beginning\nto rumble, shaking the ground under them with a deep vibration. Kramer\nwas standing a short distance away from the others, his arms folded,\nwatching silently. At the sound of the turbines he walked quickly\naround the ship to the other side. A few workmen were clearing away\nthe last of the waste, the scraps of wiring and scaffolding. They\nglanced up at him and went on hurriedly with their work. Kramer\nmounted the ramp and entered the control cabin of the ship. Winter was\nsitting at the controls with a Pilot from Space-transport.\n\n\"How's it look?\" Kramer asked.\n\n\"All right.\" Winter got up. \"He tells me that it would be best to take\noff manually. The robot controls--\" Winter hesitated. \"I mean, the\nbuilt-in controls, can take over later on in space.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" the Pilot said. \"It's customary with the Johnson\nsystem, and so in this case we should--\"\n\n\"Can you tell anything yet?\" Kramer asked.\n\n\"No,\" the Pilot said slowly. \"I don't think so. I've been going over\neverything. It seems to be in good order. There's only one thing I\nwanted to ask you about.\" He put his hand on the control board. \"There\nare some changes here I don't understand.\"\n\n\"Changes?\"\n\n\"Alterations from the original design. I wonder what the purpose is.\"\n\nKramer took a set of the plans from his coat. \"Let me look.\" He turned\nthe pages over. The Pilot watched carefully over his shoulder.\n\n\"The changes aren't indicated on your copy,\" the Pilot said. \"I\nwonder--\" He stopped. Commander Gross had entered the control cabin.\n\n\"Gross, who authorized alterations?\" Kramer said. \"Some of the wiring\nhas been changed.\"\n\n\"Why, your old friend.\" Gross signaled to the field tower through the\nwindow.\n\n\"My old friend?\"\n\n\"The Professor. He took quite an active interest.\" Gross turned to the\nPilot. \"Let's get going. We have to take this out past gravity for the\ntest they tell me. Well, perhaps it's for the best. Are you ready?\"\n\n\"Sure.\" The Pilot sat down and moved some of the controls around.\n\"Anytime.\"\n\n\"Go ahead, then,\" Gross said.\n\n\"The Professor--\" Kramer began, but at that moment there was a\ntremendous roar and the ship leaped under him. He grasped one of the\nwall holds and hung on as best he could. The cabin was filling with a\nsteady throbbing, the raging of the jet turbines underneath them.\n\nThe ship leaped. Kramer closed his eyes and held his breath. They were\nmoving out into space, gaining speed each moment.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Well, what do you think?\" Winter said nervously. \"Is it time yet?\"\n\n\"A little longer,\" Kramer said. He was sitting on the floor of the\ncabin, down by the control wiring. He had removed the metal\ncovering-plate, exposing the complicated maze of relay wiring. He was\nstudying it, comparing it to the wiring diagrams.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" Gross said.\n\n\"These changes. I can't figure out what they're for. The only pattern\nI can make out is that for some reason--\"\n\n\"Let me look,\" the Pilot said. He squatted down beside Kramer. \"You\nwere saying?\"\n\n\"See this lead here? Originally it was switch controlled. It closed\nand opened automatically, according to temperature change. Now it's\nwired so that the central control system operates it. The same with\nthe others. A lot of this was still mechanical, worked by pressure,\ntemperature, stress. Now it's under the central master.\"\n\n\"The brain?\" Gross said. \"You mean it's been altered so that the brain\nmanipulates it?\"\n\nKramer nodded. \"Maybe Professor Thomas felt that no mechanical relays\ncould be trusted. Maybe he thought that things would be happening too\nfast. But some of these could close in a split second. The brake\nrockets could go on as quickly as--\"\n\n\"Hey,\" Winter said from the control seat. \"We're getting near the moon\nstations. What'll I do?\"\n\nThey looked out the port. The corroded surface of the moon gleamed up\nat them, a corrupt and sickening sight. They were moving swiftly toward\nit.\n\n\"I'll take it,\" the Pilot said. He eased Winter out of the way and\nstrapped himself in place. The ship began to move away from the moon\nas he manipulated the controls. Down below them they could see the\nobservation stations dotting the surface, and the tiny squares that\nwere the openings of the underground factories and hangars. A red\nblinker winked up at them and the Pilot's fingers moved on the board\nin answer.\n\n\"We're past the moon,\" the Pilot said, after a time. The moon had\nfallen behind them; the ship was heading into outer space. \"Well, we\ncan go ahead with it.\"\n\nKramer did not answer.\n\n\"Mr. Kramer, we can go ahead any time.\"\n\nKramer started. \"Sorry. I was thinking. All right, thanks.\" He\nfrowned, deep in thought.\n\n\"What is it?\" Gross asked.\n\n\"The wiring changes. Did you understand the reason for them when you\ngave the okay to the workmen?\"\n\nGross flushed. \"You know I know nothing about technical material. I'm\nin Security.\"\n\n\"Then you should have consulted me.\"\n\n\"What does it matter?\" Gross grinned wryly. \"We're going to have to\nstart putting our faith in the old man sooner or later.\"\n\nThe Pilot stepped back from the board. His face was pale and set.\n\"Well, it's done,\" he said. \"That's it.\"\n\n\"What's done?\" Kramer said.\n\n\"We're on automatic. The brain. I turned the board over to it--to him,\nI mean. The Old Man.\" The Pilot lit a cigarette and puffed nervously.\n\"Let's keep our fingers crossed.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe ship was coasting evenly, in the hands of its invisible pilot. Far\ndown inside the ship, carefully armoured and protected, a soft human\nbrain lay in a tank of liquid, a thousand minute electric charges\nplaying over its surface. As the charges rose they were picked up and\namplified, fed into relay systems, advanced, carried on through the\nentire ship--\n\nGross wiped his forehead nervously. \"So _he_ is running it, now. I\nhope he knows what he's doing.\"\n\nKramer nodded enigmatically. \"I think he does.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\" Kramer walked to the port. \"I see we're still moving in a\nstraight line.\" He picked up the microphone. \"We can instruct the\nbrain orally, through this.\" He blew against the microphone\nexperimentally.\n\n\"Go on,\" Winter said.\n\n\"Bring the ship around half-right,\" Kramer said. \"Decrease speed.\"\n\nThey waited. Time passed. Gross looked at Kramer. \"No change.\nNothing.\"\n\n\"Wait.\"\n\nSlowly, the ship was beginning to turn. The turbines missed, reducing\ntheir steady beat. The ship was taking up its new course, adjusting\nitself. Nearby some space debris rushed past, incinerating in the\nblasts of the turbine jets.\n\n\"So far so good,\" Gross said.\n\nThey began to breathe more easily. The invisible pilot had taken\ncontrol smoothly, calmly. The ship was in good hands. Kramer spoke a\nfew more words into the microphone, and they swung again. Now they\nwere moving back the way they had come, toward the moon.\n\n\"Let's see what he does when we enter the moon's pull,\" Kramer said.\n\"He was a good mathematician, the old man. He could handle any kind of\nproblem.\"\n\nThe ship veered, turning away from the moon. The great eaten-away\nglobe fell behind them.\n\nGross breathed a sigh of relief. \"That's that.\"\n\n\"One more thing.\" Kramer picked up the microphone. \"Return to the moon\nand land the ship at the first space field,\" he said into it.\n\n\"Good Lord,\" Winter murmured. \"Why are you--\"\n\n\"Be quiet.\" Kramer stood, listening. The turbines gasped and roared as\nthe ship swung full around, gaining speed. They were moving back, back\ntoward the moon again. The ship dipped down, heading toward the great\nglobe below.\n\n\"We're going a little fast,\" the Pilot said. \"I don't see how he can\nput down at this velocity.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe port filled up, as the globe swelled rapidly. The Pilot hurried\ntoward the board, reaching for the controls. All at once the ship\njerked. The nose lifted and the ship shot out into space, away from\nthe moon, turning at an oblique angle. The men were thrown to the\nfloor by the sudden change in course. They got to their feet again,\nspeechless, staring at each other.\n\nThe Pilot gazed down at the board. \"It wasn't me! I didn't touch a\nthing. I didn't even get to it.\"\n\nThe ship was gaining speed each moment. Kramer hesitated. \"Maybe you\nbetter switch it back to manual.\"\n\nThe Pilot closed the switch. He took hold of the steering controls and\nmoved them experimentally. \"Nothing.\" He turned around. \"Nothing. It\ndoesn't respond.\"\n\nNo one spoke.\n\n\"You can see what has happened,\" Kramer said calmly. \"The old man\nwon't let go of it, now that he has it. I was afraid of this when I\nsaw the wiring changes. Everything in this ship is centrally\ncontrolled, even the cooling system, the hatches, the garbage release.\nWe're helpless.\"\n\n\"Nonsense.\" Gross strode to the board. He took hold of the wheel and\nturned it. The ship continued on its course, moving away from the\nmoon, leaving it behind.\n\n\"Release!\" Kramer said into the microphone. \"Let go of the controls!\nWe'll take it back. Release.\"\n\n\"No good,\" the Pilot said. \"Nothing.\" He spun the useless wheel. \"It's\ndead, completely dead.\"\n\n\"And we're still heading out,\" Winter said, grinning foolishly. \"We'll\nbe going through the first-line defense belt in a few minutes. If they\ndon't shoot us down--\"\n\n\"We better radio back.\" The Pilot clicked the radio to _send_. \"I'll\ncontact the main bases, one of the observation stations.\"\n\n\"Better get the defense belt, at the speed we're going. We'll be into\nit in a minute.\"\n\n\"And after that,\" Kramer said, \"we'll be in outer space. He's moving\nus toward outspace velocity. Is this ship equipped with baths?\"\n\n\"Baths?\" Gross said.\n\n\"The sleep tanks. For space-drive. We may need them if we go much\nfaster.\"\n\n\"But good God, where are we going?\" Gross said. \"Where--where's he\ntaking us?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Pilot obtained contact. \"This is Dwight, on ship,\" he said. \"We're\nentering the defense zone at high velocity. Don't fire on us.\"\n\n\"Turn back,\" the impersonal voice came through the speaker. \"You're\nnot allowed in the defense zone.\"\n\n\"We can't. We've lost control.\"\n\n\"Lost control?\"\n\n\"This is an experimental ship.\"\n\nGross took the radio. \"This is Commander Gross, Security. We're being\ncarried into outer space. There's nothing we can do. Is there any way\nthat we can be removed from this ship?\"\n\nA hesitation. \"We have some fast pursuit ships that could pick you up\nif you wanted to jump. The chances are good they'd find you. Do you\nhave space flares?\"\n\n\"We do,\" the Pilot said. \"Let's try it.\"\n\n\"Abandon ship?\" Kramer said. \"If we leave now we'll never see it\nagain.\"\n\n\"What else can we do? We're gaining speed all the time. Do you propose\nthat we stay here?\"\n\n\"No.\" Kramer shook his head. \"Damn it, there ought to be a better\nsolution.\"\n\n\"Could you contact _him_?\" Winter asked. \"The Old Man? Try to reason\nwith him?\"\n\n\"It's worth a chance,\" Gross said. \"Try it.\"\n\n\"All right.\" Kramer took the microphone. He paused a moment. \"Listen!\nCan you hear me? This is Phil Kramer. Can you hear me, Professor. Can\nyou hear me? I want you to release the controls.\"\n\nThere was silence.\n\n\"This is Kramer, Professor. Can you hear me? Do you remember who I am?\nDo you understand who this is?\"\n\nAbove the control panel the wall speaker made a sound, a sputtering\nstatic. They looked up.\n\n\"Can you hear me, Professor. This is Philip Kramer. I want you to give\nthe ship back to us. If you can hear me, release the controls! Let go,\nProfessor. Let go!\"\n\nStatic. A rushing sound, like the wind. They gazed at each other.\nThere was silence for a moment.\n\n\"It's a waste of time,\" Gross said.\n\n\"No--listen!\"\n\nThe sputter came again. Then, mixed with the sputter, almost lost in\nit, a voice came, toneless, without inflection, a mechanical, lifeless\nvoice from the metal speaker in the wall, above their heads.\n\n\"... Is it you, Philip? I can't make you out. Darkness.... Who's\nthere? With you....\"\n\n\"It's me, Kramer.\" His fingers tightened against the microphone\nhandle. \"You must release the controls, Professor. We have to get back\nto Terra. You must.\"\n\nSilence. Then the faint, faltering voice came again, a little stronger\nthan before. \"Kramer. Everything so strange. I was right, though.\nConsciousness result of thinking. Necessary result. Cognito ergo sum.\nRetain conceptual ability. Can you hear me?\"\n\n\"Yes, Professor--\"\n\n\"I altered the wiring. Control. I was fairly certain.... I wonder if I\ncan do it. Try....\"\n\nSuddenly the air-conditioning snapped into operation. It snapped\nabruptly off again. Down the corridor a door slammed. Something\nthudded. The men stood listening. Sounds came from all sides of them,\nswitches shutting, opening. The lights blinked off; they were in\ndarkness. The lights came back on, and at the same time the heating\ncoils dimmed and faded.\n\n\"Good God!\" Winter said.\n\nWater poured down on them, the emergency fire-fighting system. There\nwas a screaming rush of air. One of the escape hatches had slid back,\nand the air was roaring frantically out into space.\n\nThe hatch banged closed. The ship subsided into silence. The heating\ncoils glowed into life. As suddenly as it had begun the weird\nexhibition ceased.\n\n\"I can do--everything,\" the dry, toneless voice came from the wall\nspeaker. \"It is all controlled. Kramer, I wish to talk to you. I've\nbeen--been thinking. I haven't seen you in many years. A lot to\ndiscuss. You've changed, boy. We have much to discuss. Your wife--\"\n\nThe Pilot grabbed Kramer's arm. \"There's a ship standing off our bow.\nLook.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey ran to the port. A slender pale craft was moving along with them,\nkeeping pace with them. It was signal-blinking.\n\n\"A Terran pursuit ship,\" the Pilot said. \"Let's jump. They'll pick us\nup. Suits--\"\n\nHe ran to a supply cupboard and turned the handle. The door opened and\nhe pulled the suits out onto the floor.\n\n\"Hurry,\" Gross said. A panic seized them. They dressed frantically,\npulling the heavy garments over them. Winter staggered to the escape\nhatch and stood by it, waiting for the others. They joined him, one by\none.\n\n\"Let's go!\" Gross said. \"Open the hatch.\"\n\nWinter tugged at the hatch. \"Help me.\"\n\nThey grabbed hold, tugging together. Nothing happened. The hatch\nrefused to budge.\n\n\"Get a crowbar,\" the Pilot said.\n\n\"Hasn't anyone got a blaster?\" Gross looked frantically around. \"Damn\nit, blast it open!\"\n\n\"Pull,\" Kramer grated. \"Pull together.\"\n\n\"Are you at the hatch?\" the toneless voice came, drifting and eddying\nthrough the corridors of the ship. They looked up, staring around\nthem. \"I sense something nearby, outside. A ship? You are leaving, all\nof you? Kramer, you are leaving, too? Very unfortunate. I had hoped we\ncould talk. Perhaps at some other time you might be induced to\nremain.\"\n\n\"Open the hatch!\" Kramer said, staring up at the impersonal walls of\nthe ship. \"For God's sake, open it!\"\n\nThere was silence, an endless pause. Then, very slowly, the hatch slid\nback. The air screamed out, rushing past them into space.\n\nOne by one they leaped, one after the other, propelled away by the\nrepulsive material of the suits. A few minutes later they were being\nhauled aboard the pursuit ship. As the last one of them was lifted\nthrough the port, their own ship pointed itself suddenly upward and\nshot off at tremendous speed. It disappeared.\n\nKramer removed his helmet, gasping. Two sailors held onto him and\nbegan to wrap him in blankets. Gross sipped a mug of coffee,\nshivering.\n\n\"It's gone,\" Kramer murmured.\n\n\"I'll have an alarm sent out,\" Gross said.\n\n\"What's happened to your ship?\" a sailor asked curiously. \"It sure\ntook off in a hurry. Who's on it?\"\n\n\"We'll have to have it destroyed,\" Gross went on, his face grim. \"It's\ngot to be destroyed. There's no telling what it--what _he_ has in\nmind.\" Gross sat down weakly on a metal bench. \"What a close call for\nus. We were so damn trusting.\"\n\n\"What could he be planning,\" Kramer said, half to himself. \"It doesn't\nmake sense. I don't get it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs the ship sped back toward the moon base they sat around the table\nin the dining room, sipping hot coffee and thinking, not saying very\nmuch.\n\n\"Look here,\" Gross said at last. \"What kind of man was Professor\nThomas? What do you remember about him?\"\n\nKramer put his coffee mug down. \"It was ten years ago. I don't\nremember much. It's vague.\"\n\nHe let his mind run back over the years. He and Dolores had been at\nHunt College together, in physics and the life sciences. The College\nwas small and set back away from the momentum of modern life. He had\ngone there because it was his home town, and his father had gone there\nbefore him.\n\nProfessor Thomas had been at the College a long time, as long as\nanyone could remember. He was a strange old man, keeping to himself\nmost of the time. There were many things that he disapproved of, but\nhe seldom said what they were.\n\n\"Do you recall anything that might help us?\" Gross asked. \"Anything\nthat would give us a clue as to what he might have in mind?\"\n\nKramer nodded slowly. \"I remember one thing....\"\n\nOne day he and the Professor had been sitting together in the school\nchapel, talking leisurely.\n\n\"Well, you'll be out of school, soon,\" the Professor had said. \"What\nare you going to do?\"\n\n\"Do? Work at one of the Government Research Projects, I suppose.\"\n\n\"And eventually? What's your ultimate goal?\"\n\nKramer had smiled. \"The question is unscientific. It presupposes such\nthings as ultimate ends.\"\n\n\"Suppose instead along these lines, then: What if there were no war\nand no Government Research Projects? What would you do, then?\"\n\n\"I don't know. But how can I imagine a hypothetical situation like\nthat? There's been war as long as I can remember. We're geared for\nwar. I don't know what I'd do. I suppose I'd adjust, get used to it.\"\n\nThe Professor had stared at him. \"Oh, you do think you'd get\naccustomed to it, eh? Well, I'm glad of that. And you think you could\nfind something to do?\"\n\nGross listened intently. \"What do you infer from this, Kramer?\"\n\n\"Not much. Except that he was against war.\"\n\n\"We're all against war,\" Gross pointed out.\n\n\"True. But he was withdrawn, set apart. He lived very simply, cooking\nhis own meals. His wife died many years ago. He was born in Europe, in\nItaly. He changed his name when he came to the United States. He used\nto read Dante and Milton. He even had a Bible.\"\n\n\"Very anachronistic, don't you think?\"\n\n\"Yes, he lived quite a lot in the past. He found an old phonograph and\nrecords, and he listened to the old music. You saw his house, how\nold-fashioned it was.\"\n\n\"Did he have a file?\" Winter asked Gross.\n\n\"With Security? No, none at all. As far as we could tell he never\nengaged in political work, never joined anything or even seemed to\nhave strong political convictions.\"\n\n\"No,\" Kramer, agreed. \"About all he ever did was walk through the\nhills. He liked nature.\"\n\n\"Nature can be of great use to a scientist,\" Gross said. \"There\nwouldn't be any science without it.\"\n\n\"Kramer, what do you think his plan is, taking control of the ship and\ndisappearing?\" Winter said.\n\n\"Maybe the transfer made him insane,\" the Pilot said. \"Maybe there's\nno plan, nothing rational at all.\"\n\n\"But he had the ship rewired, and he had made sure that he would\nretain consciousness and memory before he even agreed to the\noperation. He must have had something planned from the start. But\nwhat?\"\n\n\"Perhaps he just wanted to stay alive longer,\" Kramer said. \"He was\nold and about to die. Or--\"\n\n\"Or what?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\" Kramer stood up. \"I think as soon as we get to the moon\nbase I'll make a vidcall to earth. I want to talk to somebody about\nthis.\"\n\n\"Who's that?\" Gross asked.\n\n\"Dolores. Maybe she remembers something.\"\n\n\"That's a good idea,\" Gross said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Where are you calling from?\" Dolores asked, when he succeeded in\nreaching her.\n\n\"From the moon base.\"\n\n\"All kinds of rumors are running around. Why didn't the ship come\nback? What happened?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid he ran off with it.\"\n\n\"He?\"\n\n\"The Old Man. Professor Thomas.\" Kramer explained what had happened.\n\nDolores listened intently. \"How strange. And you think he planned it\nall in advance, from the start?\"\n\n\"I'm certain. He asked for the plans of construction and the\ntheoretical diagrams at once.\"\n\n\"But why? What for?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Look, Dolores. What do you remember about him? Is there\nanything that might give a clue to all this?\"\n\n\"Like what?\"\n\n\"I don't know. That's the trouble.\"\n\nOn the vidscreen Dolores knitted her brow. \"I remember he raised\nchickens in his back yard, and once he had a goat.\" She smiled. \"Do\nyou remember the day the goat got loose and wandered down the main\nstreet of town? Nobody could figure out where it came from.\"\n\n\"Anything else?\"\n\n\"No.\" He watched her struggling, trying to remember. \"He wanted to\nhave a farm, sometime, I know.\"\n\n\"All right. Thanks.\" Kramer touched the switch. \"When I get back to\nTerra maybe I'll stop and see you.\"\n\n\"Let me know how it works out.\"\n\nHe cut the line and the picture dimmed and faded. He walked slowly\nback to where Gross and some officers of the Military were sitting at\na chart table, talking.\n\n\"Any luck?\" Gross said, looking up.\n\n\"No. All she remembers is that he kept a goat.\"\n\n\"Come over and look at this detail chart.\" Gross motioned him around\nto his side. \"Watch!\"\n\nKramer saw the record tabs moving furiously, the little white dots\nracing back and forth.\n\n\"What's happening?\" he asked.\n\n\"A squadron outside the defense zone has finally managed to contact\nthe ship. They're maneuvering now, for position. Watch.\"\n\nThe white counters were forming a barrel formation around a black dot\nthat was moving steadily across the board, away from the central\nposition. As they watched, the white dots constricted around it.\n\n\"They're ready to open fire,\" a technician at the board said.\n\"Commander, what shall we tell them to do?\"\n\nGross hesitated. \"I hate to be the one who makes the decision. When it\ncomes right down to it--\"\n\n\"It's not just a ship,\" Kramer said. \"It's a man, a living person. A\nhuman being is up there, moving through space. I wish we knew what--\"\n\n\"But the order has to be given. We can't take any chances. Suppose he\nwent over to them, to the yuks.\"\n\nKramer's jaw dropped. \"My God, he wouldn't do that.\"\n\n\"Are you sure? Do you know what he'll do?\"\n\n\"He wouldn't do that.\"\n\nGross turned to the technician. \"Tell them to go ahead.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, sir, but now the ship has gotten away. Look down at the\nboard.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGross stared down, Kramer over his shoulder. The black dot had slipped\nthrough the white dots and had moved off at an abrupt angle. The white\ndots were broken up, dispersing in confusion.\n\n\"He's an unusual strategist,\" one of the officers said. He traced the\nline. \"It's an ancient maneuver, an old Prussian device, but it\nworked.\"\n\nThe white dots were turning back. \"Too many yuk ships out that far,\"\nGross said. \"Well, that's what you get when you don't act quickly.\" He\nlooked up coldly at Kramer. \"We should have done it when we had him.\nLook at him go!\" He jabbed a finger at the rapidly moving black dot.\nThe dot came to the edge of the board and stopped. It had reached the\nlimit of the chartered area. \"See?\"\n\n--Now what? Kramer thought, watching. So the Old Man had escaped the\ncruisers and gotten away. He was alert, all right; there was nothing\nwrong with his mind. Or with his ability to control his new body.\n\nBody--The ship was a new body for him. He had traded in the old dying\nbody, withered and frail, for this hulking frame of metal and plastic,\nturbines and rocket jets. He was strong, now. Strong and big. The new\nbody was more powerful than a thousand human bodies. But how long\nwould it last him? The average life of a cruiser was only ten years.\nWith careful handling he might get twenty out of it, before some\nessential part failed and there was no way to replace it.\n\nAnd then, what then? What would he do, when something failed and there\nwas no one to fix it for him? That would be the end. Someplace, far\nout in the cold darkness of space, the ship would slow down, silent\nand lifeless, to exhaust its last heat into the eternal timelessness\nof outer space. Or perhaps it would crash on some barren asteroid,\nburst into a million fragments.\n\nIt was only a question of time.\n\n\"Your wife didn't remember anything?\" Gross said.\n\n\"I told you. Only that he kept a goat, once.\"\n\n\"A hell of a lot of help that is.\"\n\nKramer shrugged. \"It's not my fault.\"\n\n\"I wonder if we'll ever see him again.\" Gross stared down at the\nindicator dot, still hanging at the edge of the board. \"I wonder if\nhe'll ever move back this way.\"\n\n\"I wonder, too,\" Kramer said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat night Kramer lay in bed, tossing from side to side, unable to\nsleep. The moon gravity, even artificially increased, was unfamiliar\nto him and it made him uncomfortable. A thousand thoughts wandered\nloose in his head as he lay, fully awake.\n\nWhat did it all mean? What was the Professor's plan? Maybe they would\nnever know. Maybe the ship was gone for good; the Old Man had left\nforever, shooting into outer space. They might never find out why he\nhad done it, what purpose--if any--had been in his mind.\n\nKramer sat up in bed. He turned on the light and lit a cigarette. His\nquarters were small, a metal-lined bunk room, part of the moon station\nbase.\n\nThe Old Man had wanted to talk to him. He had wanted to discuss\nthings, hold a conversation, but in the hysteria and confusion all\nthey had been able to think of was getting away. The ship was rushing\noff with them, carrying them into outer space. Kramer set his jaw.\nCould they be blamed for jumping? They had no idea where they were\nbeing taken, or why. They were helpless, caught in their own ship, and\nthe pursuit ship standing by waiting to pick them up was their only\nchance. Another half hour and it would have been too late.\n\nBut what had the Old Man wanted to say? What had he intended to tell\nhim, in those first confusing moments when the ship around them had\ncome alive, each metal strut and wire suddenly animate, the body of a\nliving creature, a vast metal organism?\n\nIt was weird, unnerving. He could not forget it, even now. He looked\naround the small room uneasily. What did it signify, the coming to\nlife of metal and plastic? All at once they had found themselves\ninside a _living_ creature, in its stomach, like Jonah inside the\nwhale.\n\nIt had been alive, and it had talked to them, talked calmly and\nrationally, as it rushed them off, faster and faster into outer space.\nThe wall speaker and circuit had become the vocal cords and mouth, the\nwiring the spinal cord and nerves, the hatches and relays and circuit\nbreakers the muscles.\n\nThey had been helpless, completely helpless. The ship had, in a brief\nsecond, stolen their power away from them and left them defenseless,\npractically at its mercy. It was not right; it made him uneasy. All\nhis life he had controlled machines, bent nature and the forces of\nnature to man and man's needs. The human race had slowly evolved until\nit was in a position to operate things, run them as it saw fit. Now\nall at once it had been plunged back down the ladder again, prostrate\nbefore a Power against which they were children.\n\nKramer got out of bed. He put on his bathrobe and began to search for\na cigarette. While he was searching, the vidphone rang.\n\nHe snapped the vidphone on.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\nThe face of the immediate monitor appeared. \"A call from Terra, Mr.\nKramer. An emergency call.\"\n\n\"Emergency call? For me? Put it through.\" Kramer came awake, brushing\nhis hair back out of his eyes. Alarm plucked at him.\n\nFrom the speaker a strange voice came. \"Philip Kramer? Is this\nKramer?\"\n\n\"Yes. Go on.\"\n\n\"This is General Hospital, New York City, Terra. Mr. Kramer, your wife\nis here. She has been critically injured in an accident. Your name was\ngiven to us to call. Is it possible for you to--\"\n\n\"How badly?\" Kramer gripped the vidphone stand. \"Is it serious?\"\n\n\"Yes, it's serious, Mr. Kramer. Are you able to come here? The quicker\nyou can come the better.\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Kramer nodded. \"I'll come. Thanks.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe screen died as the connection was broken. Kramer waited a moment.\nThen he tapped the button. The screen relit again. \"Yes, sir,\" the\nmonitor said.\n\n\"Can I get a ship to Terra at once? It's an emergency. My wife--\"\n\n\"There's no ship leaving the moon for eight hours. You'll have to wait\nuntil the next period.\"\n\n\"Isn't there anything I can do?\"\n\n\"We can broadcast a general request to all ships passing through this\narea. Sometimes cruisers pass by here returning to Terra for repairs.\"\n\n\"Will you broadcast that for me? I'll come down to the field.\"\n\n\"Yes sir. But there may be no ship in the area for awhile. It's a\ngamble.\" The screen died.\n\nKramer dressed quickly. He put on his coat and hurried to the lift. A\nmoment later he was running across the general receiving lobby, past\nthe rows of vacant desks and conference tables. At the door the\nsentries stepped aside and he went outside, onto the great concrete\nsteps.\n\nThe face of the moon was in shadow. Below him the field stretched out\nin total darkness, a black void, endless, without form. He made his\nway carefully down the steps and along the ramp along the side of the\nfield, to the control tower. A faint row of red lights showed him the\nway.\n\nTwo soldiers challenged him at the foot of the tower, standing in the\nshadows, their guns ready.\n\n\"Kramer?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" A light was flashed in his face.\n\n\"Your call has been sent out already.\"\n\n\"Any luck?\" Kramer asked.\n\n\"There's a cruiser nearby that has made contact with us. It has an\ninjured jet and is moving slowly back toward Terra, away from the\nline.\"\n\n\"Good.\" Kramer nodded, a flood of relief rushing through him. He lit a\ncigarette and gave one to each of the soldiers. The soldiers lit up.\n\n\"Sir,\" one of them asked, \"is it true about the experimental ship?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"It came to life and ran off?\"\n\n\"No, not exactly,\" Kramer said. \"It had a new type of control system\ninstead of the Johnson units. It wasn't properly tested.\"\n\n\"But sir, one of the cruisers that was there got up close to it, and a\nbuddy of mine says this ship acted funny. He never saw anything like\nit. It was like when he was fishing once on Terra, in Washington\nState, fishing for bass. The fish were smart, going this way and\nthat--\"\n\n\"Here's your cruiser,\" the other soldier said. \"Look!\"\n\nAn enormous vague shape was setting slowly down onto the field. They\ncould make nothing out but its row of tiny green blinkers. Kramer\nstared at the shape.\n\n\"Better hurry, sir,\" the soldiers said. \"They don't stick around here\nvery long.\"\n\n\"Thanks.\" Kramer loped across the field, toward the black shape that\nrose up above him, extended across the width of the field. The ramp\nwas down from the side of the cruiser and he caught hold of it. The\nramp rose, and a moment later Kramer was inside the hold of the ship.\nThe hatch slid shut behind him.\n\nAs he made his way up the stairs to the main deck the turbines roared\nup from the moon, out into space.\n\nKramer opened the door to the main deck. He stopped suddenly, staring\naround him in surprise. There was nobody in sight. The ship was\ndeserted.\n\n\"Good God,\" he said. Realization swept over him, numbing him. He sat\ndown on a bench, his head swimming. \"Good God.\"\n\nThe ship roared out into space leaving the moon and Terra farther\nbehind each moment.\n\nAnd there was nothing he could do.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"So it was you who put the call through,\" he said at last. \"It was you\nwho called me on the vidphone, not any hospital on Terra. It was all\npart of the plan.\" He looked up and around him. \"And Dolores is\nreally--\"\n\n\"Your wife is fine,\" the wall speaker above him said tonelessly. \"It\nwas a fraud. I am sorry to trick you that way, Philip, but it was all\nI could think of. Another day and you would have been back on Terra. I\ndon't want to remain in this area any longer than necessary. They have\nbeen so certain of finding me out in deep space that I have been able\nto stay here without too much danger. But even the purloined letter\nwas found eventually.\"\n\nKramer smoked his cigarette nervously. \"What are you going to do?\nWhere are we going?\"\n\n\"First, I want to talk to you. I have many things to discuss. I was\nvery disappointed when you left me, along with the others. I had hoped\nthat you would remain.\" The dry voice chuckled. \"Remember how we used\nto talk in the old days, you and I? That was a long time ago.\"\n\nThe ship was gaining speed. It plunged through space at tremendous\nspeed, rushing through the last of the defense zone and out beyond. A\nrush of nausea made Kramer bend over for a moment.\n\nWhen he straightened up the voice from the wall went on, \"I'm sorry to\nstep it up so quickly, but we are still in danger. Another few moments\nand we'll be free.\"\n\n\"How about yuk ships? Aren't they out here?\"\n\n\"I've already slipped away from several of them. They're quite curious\nabout me.\"\n\n\"Curious?\"\n\n\"They sense that I'm different, more like their own organic mines.\nThey don't like it. I believe they will begin to withdraw from this\narea, soon. Apparently they don't want to get involved with me.\nThey're an odd race, Philip. I would have liked to study them closely,\ntry to learn something about them. I'm of the opinion that they use no\ninert material. All their equipment and instruments are alive, in some\nform or other. They don't construct or build at all. The idea of\n_making_ is foreign to them. They utilize existing forms. Even their\nships--\"\n\n\"Where are we going?\" Kramer said. \"I want to know where you are\ntaking me.\"\n\n\"Frankly, I'm not certain.\"\n\n\"You're not certain?\"\n\n\"I haven't worked some details out. There are a few vague spots in my\nprogram, still. But I think that in a short while I'll have them\nironed out.\"\n\n\"What is your program?\" Kramer said.\n\n\"It's really very simple. But don't you want to come into the control\nroom and sit? The seats are much more comfortable than that metal\nbench.\"\n\nKramer went into the control room and sat down at the control board.\nLooking at the useless apparatus made him feel strange.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" the speaker above the board rasped.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKramer gestured helplessly. \"I'm--powerless. I can't do anything. And\nI don't like it. Do you blame me?\"\n\n\"No. No, I don't blame you. But you'll get your control back, soon.\nDon't worry. This is only a temporary expedient, taking you off this\nway. It was something I didn't contemplate. I forgot that orders would\nbe given out to shoot me on sight.\"\n\n\"It was Gross' idea.\"\n\n\"I don't doubt that. My conception, my plan, came to me as soon as you\nbegan to describe your project, that day at my house. I saw at once\nthat you were wrong; you people have no understanding of the mind at\nall. I realized that the transfer of a human brain from an organic\nbody to a complex artificial space ship would not involve the loss of\nthe intellectualization faculty of the mind. When a man thinks, he\n_is_.\n\n\"When I realized that, I saw the possibility of an age-old dream\nbecoming real. I was quite elderly when I first met you, Philip. Even\nthen my life-span had come pretty much to its end. I could look ahead\nto nothing but death, and with it the extinction of all my ideas. I\nhad made no mark on the world, none at all. My students, one by one,\npassed from me into the world, to take up jobs in the great Research\nProject, the search for better and bigger weapons of war.\n\n\"The world has been fighting for a long time, first with itself, then\nwith the Martians, then with these beings from Proxima Centauri, whom\nwe know nothing about. The human society has evolved war as a cultural\ninstitution, like the science of astronomy, or mathematics. War is a\npart of our lives, a career, a respected vocation. Bright, alert young\nmen and women move into it, putting their shoulders to the wheel as\nthey did in the time of Nebuchadnezzar. It has always been so.\n\n\"But is it innate in mankind? I don't think so. No social custom is\ninnate. There were many human groups that did not go to war; the\nEskimos never grasped the idea at all, and the American Indians never\ntook to it well.\n\n\"But these dissenters were wiped out, and a cultural pattern was\nestablished that became the standard for the whole planet. Now it has\nbecome ingrained in us.\n\n\"But if someplace along the line some other way of settling problems\nhad arisen and taken hold, something different than the massing of men\nand material to--\"\n\n\"What's your plan?\" Kramer said. \"I know the theory. It was part of\none of your lectures.\"\n\n\"Yes, buried in a lecture on plant selection, as I recall. When you\ncame to me with this proposition I realized that perhaps my conception\ncould be brought to life, after all. If my theory were right that war\nis only a habit, not an instinct, a society built up apart from Terra\nwith a minimum of cultural roots might develop differently. If it\nfailed to absorb our outlook, if it could start out on another foot,\nit might not arrive at the same point to which we have come: a dead\nend, with nothing but greater and greater wars in sight, until nothing\nis left but ruin and destruction everywhere.\n\n\"Of course, there would have to be a Watcher to guide the experiment,\nat first. A crisis would undoubtedly come very quickly, probably in\nthe second generation. Cain would arise almost at once.\n\n\"You see, Kramer, I estimate that if I remain at rest most of the\ntime, on some small planet or moon, I may be able to keep functioning\nfor almost a hundred years. That would be time enough, sufficient to\nsee the direction of the new colony. After that--Well, after that it\nwould be up to the colony itself.\n\n\"Which is just as well, of course. Man must take control eventually,\non his own. One hundred years, and after that they will have control\nof their own destiny. Perhaps I am wrong, perhaps war is more than a\nhabit. Perhaps it is a law of the universe, that things can only\nsurvive as groups by group violence.\n\n\"But I'm going ahead and taking the chance that it is only a habit,\nthat I'm right, that war is something we're so accustomed to that we\ndon't realize it is a very unnatural thing. Now as to the place! I'm\nstill a little vague about that. We must find the place, still.\n\n\"That's what we're doing now. You and I are going to inspect a few\nsystems off the beaten path, planets where the trading prospects are\nlow enough to keep Terran ships away. I know of one planet that might\nbe a good place. It was reported by the Fairchild Expedition in their\noriginal manual. We may look into that, for a start.\"\n\nThe ship was silent.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKramer sat for a time, staring down at the metal floor under him. The\nfloor throbbed dully with the motion of the turbines. At last he\nlooked up.\n\n\"You might be right. Maybe our outlook is only a habit.\" Kramer got to\nhis feet. \"But I wonder if something has occurred to you?\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"If it's such a deeply ingrained habit, going back thousands of years,\nhow are you going to get your colonists to make the break, leave Terra\nand Terran customs? How about _this_ generation, the first ones, the\npeople who found the colony? I think you're right that the next\ngeneration would be free of all this, if there were an--\" He grinned.\n\"--An Old Man Above to teach them something else instead.\"\n\nKramer looked up at the wall speaker. \"How are you going to get the\npeople to leave Terra and come with you, if by your own theory, this\ngeneration can't be saved, it all has to start with the next?\"\n\nThe wall speaker was silent. Then it made a sound, the faint dry\nchuckle.\n\n\"I'm surprised at you, Philip. Settlers can be found. We won't need\nmany, just a few.\" The speaker chuckled again. \"I'll acquaint you with\nmy solution.\"\n\nAt the far end of the corridor a door slid open. There was sound, a\nhesitant sound. Kramer turned.\n\n\"Dolores!\"\n\nDolores Kramer stood uncertainly, looking into the control room. She\nblinked in amazement. \"Phil! What are you doing here? What's going\non?\"\n\nThey stared at each other.\n\n\"What's happening?\" Dolores said. \"I received a vidcall that you had\nbeen hurt in a lunar explosion--\"\n\nThe wall speaker rasped into life. \"You see, Philip, that problem is\nalready solved. We don't really need so many people; even a single\ncouple might do.\"\n\nKramer nodded slowly. \"I see,\" he murmured thickly. \"Just one couple.\nOne man and woman.\"\n\n\"They might make it all right, if there were someone to watch and see\nthat things went as they should. There will be quite a few things I\ncan help you with, Philip. Quite a few. We'll get along very well, I\nthink.\"\n\nKramer grinned wryly. \"You could even help us name the animals,\" he\nsaid. \"I understand that's the first step.\"\n\n\"I'll be glad to,\" the toneless, impersonal voice said. \"As I recall,\nmy part will be to bring them to you, one by one. Then you can do the\nactual naming.\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" Dolores faltered. \"What does he mean, Phil?\nNaming animals. What kind of animals? Where are we going?\"\n\nKramer walked slowly over to the port and stood staring silently out,\nhis arms folded. Beyond the ship a myriad fragments of light gleamed,\ncountless coals glowing in the dark void. Stars, suns, systems.\nEndless, without number. A universe of worlds. An infinity of planets,\nwaiting for them, gleaming and winking from the darkness.\n\nHe turned back, away from the port. \"Where are we going?\" He smiled at\nhis wife, standing nervous and frightened, her large eyes full of\nalarm. \"I don't know where we are going,\" he said. \"But somehow that\ndoesn't seem too important right now.... I'm beginning to see the\nProfessor's point, it's the result that counts.\"\n\nAnd for the first time in many months he put his arm around Dolores.\nAt first she stiffened, the fright and nervousness still in her eyes.\nBut then suddenly she relaxed against him and there were tears wetting\nher cheeks.\n\n\"Phil ... do you really think we can start over again--you and I?\"\n\nHe kissed her tenderly, then passionately.\n\nAnd the spaceship shot swiftly through the endless, trackless eternity\nof the void....\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Mr. Spaceship, by Philip K.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
