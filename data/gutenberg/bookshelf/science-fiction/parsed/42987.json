Two such stories were Murray Leinster's_\n    The Mad Planet _and_ Red Dust. _Originally published in 1923, they\n    have been reprinted frequently both here and abroad. They are now\n    scheduled for book publication. Especially for this magazine, Murray\n    Leinster has written the final story in the series. It is not\n    necessary to have read the previous stories to enjoy this one. Once\n    again, Burl experiences magnificent adventures against a colorful\n    background, but to the whole the author has added philosophical and\n    psychological observations that give this story a flavor seldom\n    achieved in science-fiction._\n\n    Under his real name of Will Fitzgerald Jenkins, the author has sold\n    to _The Saturday Evening Post_, _Colliers'_, _Today's Woman_, in\n    fact every important publication in America. He has had over 1200\n    stories published, 15 books and 35 science-fiction stories\n    anthologized. His writing earned him a listing in _Who's Who in\n    America_.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nThe Directory-ship _Tethys_ made the first landing on the planet,\nL216^{12}. It was a goodly world, with an ample atmosphere and many\nseas, which the nearby sun warmed so lavishly that a perpetual\ncloud-bank hid them and all the solid ground from view. It had mountains\nand islands and high plateaus. It had day and night and rain. It had an\nequable climate, rather on the tropical side. But it possessed no life.\n\nNo animals roamed its solid surface. No vegetation grew from its rocks.\nNot even bacteria struggled with the stones to turn them into soil. No\nliving thing, however small, swam in its oceans. It was one of that\ndisappointing vast majority of otherwise admirable worlds which was\nunsuited for colonization solely because it had not been colonized\nbefore. It could be used for biological experiments in a completely\ngerm-free environment, or ships could land upon it for water and\nsupplies of air. The water was pure and the air breathable, but it had\nno other present utility. Such was the case with an overwhelming number\nof Earth-type planets when first discovered in the exploration of the\ngalaxy. Life simply hadn't started there.\n\nSo the ship which first landed upon it made due note for the Galactic\nDirectory and went away, and no other ship came near the planet for\neight hundred years.\n\nBut nearly a millennium later, the Seed-Ship _Orana_ arrived. It landed\nand carefully seeded the useless world. It circled endlessly above the\nclouds, dribbling out a fine dust comprised of the spores of every\nconceivable microorganism that could break down rock to powder and turn\nthe powder to organic matter. It also seeded with moulds and fungi and\nlichens, and everything that could turn powdery primitive soil into\nstuff on which higher forms of life could grow. The _Orana_ seeded the\nseas with plankton. Then it, too, went away.\n\nCenturies passed. Then the Ecological Preparation Ship _Ludred_ swam to\nthe planet from space. It was a gigantic ship of highly improbable\nconstruction and purpose. It found the previous seeding successful. Now\nthere was soil which swarmed with minute living things. There were fungi\nwhich throve monstrously. The seas stank of teeming minuscule\nlife-forms. There were even some novelties on land, developed by\nstrictly local conditions. There were, for example, _paramecium_ as big\nas grapes, and yeasts had increased in size so that they bore flowers\nvisible to the naked eye. The life on the planet was not aboriginal,\nthough. It had all been planted by the seed-ship of centuries before.\n\nThe _Ludred_ released insects, it dumped fish into the seas. It\nscattered plant-seeds over the continents. It treated the planet to a\nsort of Russell's Mixture of living things. The real Russell's Mixture\nis that blend of simple elements in the proportions found in suns. This\nwas a blend of living creatures, of whom some should certainly survive\nby consuming the now habituated flora, and others which should survive\nby preying on the first. The planet was stocked, in effect, with\neverything it could be hoped might live there.\n\nBut at the time of the _Ludred's_ visit of course no creature needing\nparental care had any chance of survival. Everything had to be able to\ncare for itself the instant it burst its egg. So there were no birds or\nmammals. Trees and plants of divers sorts, and fish and crustaceans and\ninsects could be planted. Nothing else.\n\nThe _Ludred_ swam away through emptiness.\n\nThere should have been another planting, centuries later still, but it\nwas never made. When the Ecological Preparation Service was moved to\nAlgol IV, a file was upset. The cards in it were picked up and replaced,\nbut one was missed. So that planet was forgotten. It circled its sun in\nemptiness. Cloud-banks covered it from pole to pole. There were hazy\nmarkings in certain places, where high plateaus penetrated the clouds.\nBut from space the planet was featureless. Seen from afar, it was merely\na round white ball--white from its cloud-banks and nothing else.\n\nBut on its surface, in its lowlands it was nightmare.\n\nEspecially was it nightmare--after some centuries--for the descendants\nof the human beings from the space-liner _Icarus_, wrecked there some\nforty-odd generations ago. Naturally, nobody anywhere else thought of\nthe _Icarus_ any more. It was not even remembered by the descendants of\nits human cargo, who now inhabited the planet. The wreckage of the ship\nwas long since hidden under the seething, furiously striving fungi of\nthe boil. The human beings on the planet had forgotten not only the ship\nbut very nearly everything--how they came to this world, the use of\nmetals, the existence of fire, and even the fact that there was such a\nthing as sunlight. They lived in the lowlands, deep under the\ncloud-bank, amid surroundings which were riotous, swarming, frenzied\nhorror. They had become savages. They were less than savages. They had\nforgotten their high destiny as men.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n[Illustration]\n\nDawn came. Grayness appeared overhead and increased. That was all. The\nsky was a blank, colorless pall, merely mottled where the clouds\nclustered a little thicker or a little thinner, as clouds do. But the\nlandscape was variegated enough! Where the little group of people\nhuddled together, there was a wide valley. Its walls rose up and up into\nthe very clouds. The people had never climbed those hillsides.\n\nThey had not even traditions of what might lie above them, and their\nlives had been much too occupied to allow of speculations on cosmology.\nBy day they were utterly absorbed in two problems which filled every\nwaking minute. One was the securing of food to eat, under the conditions\nof the second problem, which was that of merely staying alive.\n\nThere was only one of their number who sometimes thought of other\nmatters, and he did so because he had become lost from his group of\nhumans once, and had found his way back to it. His name was Burl, and\nhis becoming lost was pure fantastic accident, and his utilization of a\nfully inherited power to think was the result of extraordinary events.\nBut he still had not the actual habit of thinking. This morning he was\nlike his fellows.\n\nAll of them were soaked with wetness. During the night--every night--the\nsky dripped slow, spaced, solemn water-drops during the whole of the\ndark hours. This was customary. But normally the humans hid in the\nmushroom-forests, sheltered by the toadstools which now grew to three\nman-heights. They denned in small openings in the tangled mass of\nparasitic growths which flourished in such thickets. But this last night\nthey had camped in the open. They had no proper habitations of their\nown. Caves would have been desirable, but insects made use of caves, and\nthe descendants of insects introduced untold centuries before had shared\nin the size-increase of _paramecium_ and yeasts and the few true plants\nwhich had been able to hold their own. Mining-wasps were two yards long,\nand bumble-bees were nearly as huge, and there were other armored\nmonstrosities which also preferred caves for their own purposes. And of\ncourse the humans could not build habitations, because anything men\nbuilt to serve the purpose of a cave would instantly be preempted by\ncreatures who would automatically destroy any previous occupants.\n\nThe humans had no fixed dens at any time. Now they had not even shelter.\nThey lacked other things, also. They had no tools save salvaged scraps\nof insect-armor--great sawtoothed mandibles or razor-pointed\nleg-shells--which they used to pry apart the edible fungi on which they\nlived, or to get at the morsels of meat left behind when the brainless\nlords of this planet devoured each other. They had not even any useful\nknowledge, except desperately accurate special knowledge of the manners\nand customs of the insects they could not defy. And on this special\nmorning they concluded that they were doomed. They were going to be\nkilled. They stood shivering in the open, waiting for it to happen.\n\nIt was not exactly news. They had had warning days ago, but they could\ndo nothing about it. Their home valley, to be sure, would have made any\ncivilized human being shudder merely to look at it, but they had\nconsidered it almost paradise. It was many miles long, and a fair number\nwide, and a stream ran down its middle. At the lower end of the valley\nthere was a vast swamp, from which at nightfall the thunderously\ndeep-bass croaking of giant frogs could be heard. But that swamp had\nkept out the more terrifying creatures of that world. The thirty-foot\ncentipedes could not cross it or did not choose to. The mastodon-sized\ntarantulas which ravaged so much of the planet would not cross it save\nin pursuit of prey. So the valley was nearly a haven of safety.\n\nTrue, there was one clotho spider in its ogre's castle nearby, and there\nwas a labyrinth spider in a minor valley which nobody had ever ventured\ninto, and there were some--not many--praying-mantises as tall as\ngiraffes. They wandered terribly here and there. But most members of\ninsect life here were absorbed in their own affairs and ignored the\nhumans. There was an ant-city, whose foot-long warriors competed with\nthe humans as scavengers. There were the bees, trying to eke out a\nlivelihood from the great, cruciform flowers of the giant cabbage-plants\nand the milkweeds when water-lilies in the swamps did not bear their\nfour-foot blooms. Wasps sought their own prey. Flies were consumers of\ncorruption, but even the flies two feet in length would shy away from a\nman who waved his arms at it. So this valley had seemed to these people\nto be a truly admirable place.\n\nBut a fiend had entered it. As the gray light grew stronger the\nshivering folk looked terrifiedly about them. There were only twenty of\nthe people now. Two weeks before there had been thirty. In a matter of\ndays or less, there would be none. Because the valley had been invaded\nby a great gray furry spider!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a stirring, not far from where the man-folk trembled. Small,\ninquisitive antennae popped into view among a mass of large-sized\npebbles. There was a violent stirring, and gravel disappeared. Small\nblack things thrust upward into view and scurried anxiously about. They\nreturned to the spot from which they had emerged. They were ants,\nopening the shaft of their city after scouting for danger outside. They\nscratched and pulled and tugged at the plug of stones. They opened the\nant-city's artery of commerce. Strings of small black things came\npouring out. They averaged a foot in length, and they marched off in\ngroups upon their divers errands. Presently a group of huge-jawed\nsoldier-ants appeared, picking their way stolidly out of the opening.\nThey waited stupidly for the workers they were to guard. The workers\ncame, each carrying a faintly greenish blob of living matter. The\ncaravan moved off. The humans knew exactly what it was. The green blobs\nwere aphids--plant lice: ant-cows--small creatures sheltered and guarded\nby the ants and daily carried to nearby vegetation to feed upon its sap\nand yield inestimable honeydew.\n\nSomething reared up two hundred yards away, where the thin mist that lay\neverywhere just barely began to fade all colorings before it dimmed all\noutlines. The object was slender. It had a curiously humanlike head. It\nheld out horrible sawtoothed arms in a gesture as of benediction--which\nwas purest mockery. Something smaller was drawing near to it. The\ncolossal praying mantis held its pose, immovable. Presently it struck\ndownward with lightning speed. There was a cry. The mantis rose erect\nagain, its great arms holding something that stirred and struggled\nhelplessly, and repented its unconsonanted outcry. The mantis ate it\ndaintily as it struggled and screamed.\n\nThe humans did not watch this tragedy. The mantis would eat a man, of\ncourse. It had. The only creatures immune to its menace were ants, which\nfor some reason it would not touch. But it was a mantis' custom after\nspotting its prey to wait immobile for the unlucky creature to come\nwithin its reach. It preferred to make its captures that way. Only if a\nthing fled did the mantis pursue with deadly ferocity. Even then it\ndined with monstrous deliberation as this one dined now. Still, mantises\ncould be seen from a distance and hidden from. They were not the terror\nwhich had driven the humans even from their hiding-places.\n\nIt had been two weeks since the giant hunting-spider had come through a\nmountain pass into this valley to prey upon the life within it. It was\ngigantic even of its kind. It was deadliness beyond compare. The first\nhuman to see it froze in terror. It was disaster itself. Its legs\nspanned yards. Its fangs were needle-sharp and feet in length--and\npoisoned. Its eyes glittered with insatiable, insane blood-lust. Its\ncoming was ten times more deadly to the unarmed folk than a Bengal tiger\nloose in the valley would have been.\n\nIt killed a man the very first day it was in the valley, leaving his\nsucked-dry carcass, and going on to destroy a rhinoceros-beetle and a\ncricket--whose deep-bass cries were horrible--and proceeded down the\nvalley, leaving only death behind it. It had killed other men and women\nsince. It had caught four children. But even that was not the worst. It\ncarried worse, more deadly, more inevitable disaster with it.\n\nBecause, bumping and bouncing behind its abdomen as it moved, fastened\nto its body with cables of coarse and discolored silk, the\nhunting-spider dragged a burden which was its own ferocity many times\nmultiplied. It dragged an egg-bag. The bag was larger than its body,\nfour feet in diameter. The female spider would carry this\nburden--cherishing it--until the eggs hatched. Then there would be four\nto five hundred small monsters at large in the valley. And from the\ninstant of their hatching they would be just such demoniac creatures as\ntheir parents. They would be small, to be sure. Their legs would span no\nmore than a foot. Their bodies would be the size of a man's fist. But\nthey could leap two yards, instantly they reached the open air, and\ntheir inch-long fangs would be no less envenomed, and their ferocity\nwould be in madness, in insanity and in stark maniacal horror equal the\ngreat gray fiend which had begot them.\n\nThe eggs had hatched. Today--now--this morning--they were abroad. The\nlittle group of humans no longer hid in the mushroom-forests because the\nsmall hunting-spiders sought frenziedly there for things to kill.\nHundreds of small lunatic demons roamed the valley. They swarmed among\nthe huge toadstools, killing and devouring all living things large and\nsmall. When they encountered each other they fought in slavering,\npanting fury, and the survivors of such duels dined upon their brothers.\nSmall truffle-beetles died, clicking futilely. Infinitesimal grubs,\nnewly hatched from butterfly eggs and barely six inches long, furnished\nthem with tidbits. But they would kill anything and feast upon it.\n\nA woman had died yesterday, and two small gray devils battled\nmurderously above her corpse.\n\nJust before darkness a huge yellow butterfly had flung itself agonizedly\naloft, with these small dark horrors clinging to its body, feasting upon\nthe juices of the body their poison had not yet done to death.\n\nAnd now, at daybreak, the humans looked about despairingly for their own\ndeaths to come to them. They had spent the night in the open lest they\nbe trapped in the very forests that had been their protection. Now they\nremained in clear view of the large gray murderer should it pass that\nway. They did not dare to hide because of that ogreish creature's young,\nwho panted in their blood-lust as they scurried here and there and\neverywhere.\n\nAs the day became established, the clouds were gray--gray only. The\nnight-mist thinned. One of the younger women of the tribe--a girl called\nSaya--saw the huge thing far away. She cried out, choking. The others\nsaw the monster as it leaped upon and murdered a vividly colored\ncaterpillar on a milkweed near the limit of vision. The milkweed was the\nsize of a tree. The caterpillar was four yards long. While the enormous\nvictim writhed as it died, not one of the humans looked away. Presently\nall was still. The hunting-spider crouched over its victim in obscene\nabsorption. Having been madness incarnate, it now was the very exemplar\nof a horrid gluttony.\n\nAgain the humans shivered. They were without shelter. They were without\neven the concept of arms. But it was morning, and they were alive, and\ntherefore they were hungry. Their desperation was absolute, but\ndesperation to some degree was part of their lives. Yet they shivered\nand suffered. There were edible mushrooms nearby, but with the deadly\nsmall replicas of the hunting-spider giant roaming everywhere, any\nmovement was as likely to be deadly as standing still to be found and\nkilled. The humans murmured to one another, fearfully.\n\nBut there was the young man called Burl, who had been lost from his\ntribe and had found it again. The experience had changed him. He had\nfelt stirrings of atavistic impulses in recent weeks--the more\nespecially when the young girl Saya looked at him. It was not normal, in\nhumans conditioned to survive by flight, that Burl should feel\npreviously unimagined hunger for fury--a longing to hate and do battle.\nOf course men sometimes fought for a particular woman's favor, but not\nwhen there were deadly insects about. The carnivorous insects were not\nonly peril, but horror unfaceable. So Burl's sensations were very\nstrange. On this planet a courtship did not usually involve displays of\nvalor. A man who was a more skillful forager than the foot-long ants was\nan acceptable husband. Warriors did not exist.\n\nBurl did not even know what a warrior was. Yet today the sullen,\nunreasonable impulses to conduct what he could not quite imagine were\nvery strong. He knew all the despairing terror the others felt. But he\nalso was hungry. The sheer doom that was upon his group did not change\nthe fact that he wanted to eat, nor did it change the fact that he felt\nqueer when the girl Saya looked at him. Because she was terrified, the\nsame sort of atavistic process was at work in her. She looked to Burl.\nMen no longer served as protectors against enemies so irresistible as\ngiant spiders. It was not possible. But when Burl realized her regard\nhis chest swelled. He felt a half-formed impulse to beat upon it. His\nnew-found reasoning processes told him that this particular fear was\ndifferent in some fashion from the terrors men normally experienced. It\nwas. This was a different sort of emergency. Most dangers were sudden\nand either immediately fatal or somehow avoidable. This was different.\nThere was time to savor its meaning and its hopelessness. It seemed as\nif it should be possible to do something about it. But Burl was not\nable, as yet, to think what to do. The bare idea of doing anything was\nunusual, now. Because of it, though, Burl was able to disregard his\nterror when Saya regarded him yearningly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe other men muttered to each other of the sudden death in the mushroom\nthickets. No less certain death now feasted on the dead yellow\ncaterpillar. But Burl abruptly pushed his way clear of the small crowd\nand scowled for Saya to see. He moved toward the nearest fungus-thicket.\nAn edible mushroom grew at its very edge. He marched toward it,\nswaggering. Men did not often swagger on this planet.\n\nBut then he ceased to swagger. His approach to the mingled mass of\ntoadstools and lesser monstrosities grew slower. His feet dragged. He\ncame to a halt. His impulse to combat conflicted with the facts of here\nand now. His flesh crawled at the thought of the grisly small beasts\nwhich now might be within yards. These thickets had been men's safest\nhiding-places. Now they were places of surest disaster.\n\nHe stopped, with a coldness at the pit of his stomach. But as it was a\nnew experience to be able to have danger come in a form which could be\nforeseen, so Burl now had a new experience in that he was ashamed to be\nafraid. Somehow, having tacitly undertaken to get food for his\ncompanions, he could not bring himself to draw back while they watched.\nBut he did want desperately to get the food in a hurry and get away from\nthere.\n\nHe saw a gruesome fragment of a tragedy of days before. It was the\nemptied, scraped, hollow leg-shell of a beetle. It was horrendously\nbarbed. Great, knife-edged spines lined its edge. They were six inches\nin length. And men did not have weapons any more, but they sometimes\nused just such objects as this to dismember defenseless giant slugs they\ncame upon.\n\nBurl picked up the hollow shell of the leg-joint. He shook it free of\nclinging moulds--and small things an inch or two in length dropped from\nit and scurried frantically into hiding. He moved hesitantly toward the\nedible mushroom which would be food for Saya and the rest. He was four\nyards from the thicket. Three. Two. He needed to move only six feet, and\nthen slice at the flabby mushroom-head, and he would be at least an\nadmirable person in the eyes of Saya.\n\nThen he cried out thinly. Something small, with insane eyes, leaped upon\nhim from the edge of a giant toadstool.\n\nIt was, of course, one of the small beasts which had hatched from the\nhunting-spider's egg-bag. It had grown. Its legs now spanned sixteen\ninches. Its body was as large as Burl's two fists together. It was big\nenough to enclose his head in a cage of loathesomeness formed by its\nlegs, while its fangs tore at his scalp. Or it could cover his chest\nwith its abominableness while its poison filled his veins, and while it\nfeasted upon him afterward....\n\nHe flung up his hands in a paralytic, horror-stricken attempt to ward it\noff. But they were clenched. His right hand did not let go of the\nleg-section with its razor-sharp barbs.\n\nThe spider struck the beetle-leg. He felt the impact. Then he heard\ngaspings and bubblings of fury. He heard an indescribable cry which was\nmadness itself. The chitinous object he had picked up now shook and\nquivered of itself.\n\nThe spider was impaled. Two of its legs were severed and twitched upon\nthe ground before him. Its body was slashed nearly in half. It writhed\nand struggled and made beastly sounds. Thin, colored fluids dripped from\nit. A disgusting musky smell filled the air. It strove to reach and kill\nhim as it died. Its eyes looked like flames.\n\nBurl's arm shook convulsively. The small thing dropped to the ground.\nIts remaining legs moved frantically but without purpose.\n\nIt died, though its leg continued to twitch and stir and quiver.\n\nBurl remained frozen, for seconds. It was an acquired instinct; a\nconditioned reflex which humans had to develop on this world. When\ndanger was past, one stayed desperately still lest it return. But Burl's\nthoughts were now not of horror but a vast astonishment. He had killed a\nspider! He had killed a thing which would have killed him! He was still\nalive!\n\nAnd then, being a savage, and an animal, as well as a human being, he\nacted according to that highly complicated nature. As a savage, he knew\nwith strict practicality that it was improbable that there was another\nbaby spider nearby. If there had been, they would have fought each\nother. As an animal, he was again hungry. As a human being, he was vain.\n\nSo he moved closer to the toadstool-thicket and put his hand out and\nbroke off a great mass of the one edible mushroom at the edge. A\nnoisesome broth poured out and little maggots dropped to the ground and\nwrithed there in it. But most of what he had broken off was sound. He\nturned to take it to Saya. Then he saw the dropped weapon and the\nspider. He picked up the weapon.\n\nThe spider's legs still twitched, though futilely. He spiked the small\nbody on the beetle-leg's spines. He strode back to the remnant of his\ntribe with a peculiar gait that even he had not often practiced.\n\nIt was rather more pronounced than a swagger. It was a strut.\n\nThey trembled when they saw the dead creature he had killed. He gave\nSaya the food. She took it, looking at him with bright and intense eyes.\nHe took a part of the mushroom for himself and ate it, scowling.\nThoughts were struggling to form in his mind. He was not accustomed to\nthinking, but he had done more of it than any other of the pitiful group\nabout him.\n\nHe felt eyes watching him. There were five adult men in this group\nbesides himself, and six women. The rest were children, from gangling\nadolescents to one mere infant in arms. They were a remarkably colorful\ngroup at the moment, had he only known it. The men wore\nyellow-and-gold-brown loin-cloths of caterpillar-fur, stripped from the\ndrained carcasses of creatures that the formerly resident clothed spider\nhad killed. The women wore cloaks of butterfly-wing, similarly salvaged\nfrom the remnants of a meal left unfinished by a finicky or engorged\npraying mantis. The stuff was thick and leathery, but it was\nmagnificently tinted in purples and yellows.\n\nTime passed. The mushroom Burl had brought was finished. Some eyes\nalways explored the clear ground around this group. But other eyes fixed\nthemselves upon Burl. It was not a consciously questioning gaze. It was\nsurely not a hopeful one. But men and women and children looked at him.\nThey marveled at him. He had dared to go and get food! He had been\nattacked by one of the creatures who doomed them all, but he was not\ndead! Instead, he had killed the spider! It was marvelous! It was\nunparalleled that a man should kill anything that attacked him!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe doomed small group regarded Burl with wondering eyes. He brushed his\nhands together. He looked at Saya. He wished to be alone with her. He\nwished to know what she thought when she looked at him. Why she looked\nat him. What she felt when she looked at him.\n\nHe stood up and said dourly:\n\n\"Come!\"\n\nShe moved timidly and gave him her hand. He moved away. There was but\none way that any human being on this planet would think to move, from\nthis particular spot just now--away from the still-feasting gigantic\nhorror whose offspring he had killed. The folk shivered near the edge of\nthe first upward slope of the valley wall. Burl moved in that direction.\nToward the slope. Saya went with him.\n\nBefore they had gone ten yards a man spoke to his wife. They followed\nBurl, with their three children. Five yards more, and two of the\nremaining three adult men were hustling their families in his wake also.\nIn seconds the last was in motion.\n\nBurl moved on, unconscious of any who followed him, aware only of Saya.\nThe procession, absurd as it was, continued in his wake simply because\nit had begun to do so. A skinny, half-grown boy regarded Burl's stained\nweapon. He saw something half-buried in the soil and moved aside to tug\nat it. It was part of the armor of a former rhinoceros-beetle. He went\non, rather awkwardly holding a weapon which might have been called a\ndagger, eighteen inches long, except that no dagger would have a\nhand-guard nearly its own length in diameter.\n\nThey passed a struggling milkweed plant, no more than twenty feet high\nand already scabrous with scale and rusts upon its lower parts. Ants\nmarched up and down its stalk in a steady, single file, placing aphids\nfrom the ant-city on suitable spots to feed, and to multiply as only\nparthenogenic aphids can do. But already on the far side of the\nmilkweed, an ant-lion climbed up to do murder among them. The ant-lion\nwas the larval form the lace-wing fly, of course. Aphids were its\npredestined prey.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nBurl continued to march, holding Saya's hand. The reek of formic acid\ncame to his nostrils. But that was only ants. The slope grew steeper.\nMassacre began behind him on the tree-sized milkweed. The ant-lion which\neven when it was but half an inch long, on Earth, could bite through the\nskin of a man--the ant-lion reached the pasturing cows. It plunged into\nslaughter. It was demoniac. It was such ghastly ferocity that the eggs\nfrom which its kind hatched were equipped, each one, with a plastic\ncolumn to hold it well away from the object on which the clutch of eggs\nwere laid. But for this precaution by the maternal lace-wing fly, the\nfirst of her brood to hatch would devour its unhatched brothers and\nsisters. This ant-lion charged into the placidly feeding aphids on the\nmilkweed plant. It seized one and crushed it, holding it aloft so that\nthe juices of its body would pour into the ant-lion's mouth. Almost\ninstantly, it seemed, the mild-eyed aphid was a shrunken empty sack. The\nant-lion seized another. The remaining aphids fed placidly while their\nenemy did vast slaughter among them.\n\nClickings and a shrill stridulation sounded. Warrior-ants climbed with\nstupid ferocity to offer battle.\n\nBurl moved on to a minor eminence. He reached its top and looked sharply\nabout him with the caution that was the price of existence on this\nworld. Two hundred feet away, a small scurrying horror raged and\nsearched among the rough-edged layers of what on other worlds was called\npaper-mould or rock-tripe. Here it was thick as quilting, and\ninfinitesimal creatures denned under it. The sixteen-inch spider\ndevoured them, making gluttonous sounds. But it was busy, and all\nspiders are relatively short-sighted.\n\nBurl turned to Saya--and realized that all the human folk had followed\nhim. One of the adults was reaching fearfully for part of a discarded\ncricket-shell in the ground. He tore free an emptied, sickle-shaped jaw.\nIt was curved and sharp and deadly if properly wielded. The man had seen\nBurl kill something. He tried vaguely to imagine killing something\nhimself. He was not too successful. Another man tugged at the ground.\nThe skinny boy was practicing thrusts with his giant dagger.\n\nTwo of the adults were armed, without any clear idea of what to do with\ntheir arms. But Burl knew, now.\n\nHe regarded them angrily. He had not meant to desert them, or even to\ntake Saya permanently from among them. Humans had little enough of\nsatisfaction on this planet. The scared company of their kind was one of\nthe most important. So Burl did not resent that they had followed him.\nHe did resent that they were near when he wanted to talk to Saya in what\nhe did not yet think of as lover-like seclusion.\n\nThey halted, regarding him humbly. They had been hungry, and he had\nfound food for them. They had been paralyzed by terror, and he had dared\nto move. So they moved with him. They might have followed anybody else,\nbut only Burl had initiative--so far. They trustfully waited to follow\nand to imitate him for so long as panic numbed their ability to think\nfor themselves.\n\nBurl opened his mouth to shout furiously at them. But it was not a good\nidea for humans to draw attention. Spiders did not hunt by scent, but\nsound sometimes drew them. Burl closed his mouth again, in a taut\nstraight line. The men looked at him supplicatingly. They had never been\nlost, and so had never learned to think even a little. Burl had learned\nto think in a rudimentary fashion and now he suddenly perceived that it\nwas pleasing to have all the tribe regard him so worshipfully, even if\nnot in quite the same fashion as Saya. He was suddenly aware that even\nas Saya had obeyed him when he told her to come with him, they would\nobey. He had, at the moment, no commands to give, but he immediately\ninvented one for the pleasure of seeing it carried out.\n\n\"_I carry sharp things_,\" he said sternly. \"I killed a spider. Go find\n_sharp things_ to carry.\"\n\nThey were a meek and abject folk, and they were desperately in need of\nsomething to do to take their minds from the uselessness of doing\nanything at all.\n\nThey moved to obey. Saya would have loosened her hand and obeyed, too,\nbut Burl held her beside him. One of the women, with a child three years\nold, laid the child down by Burl's feet while she went fearfully to seek\nsome fragment of a dead creature, that would meet Burl's specification\nof sharpness.\n\nBurl heard a stifled scream. A ten-year-old boy stood paralyzed, staring\nin an agony of horror at something which had stepped from behind a\nmisshapen fungoid object.\n\nIt was a pallidly greenish creature with a small head and enormous eyes.\nIt was a very few inches taller than a man. Its abdomen swelled\ngracefully into a pleasing, leaf-like shape. The boy faced it, paralyzed\nby horror, and it stood stock-still. Its great, hideously spiny arms\nwere spread out in a pose of pious benediction.\n\n[Illustration: \"_The boy faced it, paralyzed by horror._\"]\n\nIt was a partly-grown praying mantis, not very long hatched. It stood\nrigid, waiting benignly for the boy to come closer. If he fled, it would\nfling itself after him with ferocity beside which the fury of a tiger\nwould seem kittenish. If he approached, its fanged arms would flash\ndown, pierce his body, and hold him inextricably fast by the spikes that\nwere worse than trap-claws. And of course it would not wait for him to\ndie before it began its meal.\n\nThe small party of humans stood frozen. They were filled with horror\nfor the boy. They were cast into a deep abyss of despair by the\nsight of a half-grown mantis, because if there was one such miniature\ninsect-dinosaur in the valley, there would be many others. Hundreds of\nothers. This meant there had been a hatching of them. And they were as\ndeadly as spiders.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut Burl did not think in such terms just now. Vanity filled him. He had\ncommanded, and he had been obeyed. But now obedience was forgotten\nbecause there was this young praying mantis. If men had ever thought of\nfighting such a creature, it could have destroyed any number of them by\npure ferocity and superiority of armament. But Burl raged. He ran toward\nthe spot. Even mantises were sometimes frightened by the unexpected.\nBurl seized a lumpish object barely protruding from the ground. It\nlooked like a rock. It was actually a flattened ball-fungus, feeding on\nthe soil through thin white threads beneath it. Burl wrenched it free\nand hurled it furiously at the young monster.\n\nInsects simply do not think. Something came swiftly at it, and the\nmantis flashed its ghastly arms to seize and kill its attacker. The\nball-fungus was heavy. It literally knocked the mantis backward. The boy\nfled frantically. The insect fought crazily against the thing it thought\nhad assailed it.\n\nThe humans gathered around Burl hundreds of yards away--again uphill.\nThe slope of the mountain-flank was marked here. They gathered about\nBurl because of an example set by the woman who had left her\nthree-year-old child behind. Saya, in the unfailing instinct of a girl\nfor a small child, had snatched it up when Burl left her. Then she had\njoined him because the instinct which had made her obey him in starting\noff--it was not quite the same instinct which moved the others--also\nbade her follow him wherever he went. The mother of the child went to\nretrieve her deposit. Other figures moved cautiously toward him. The\ntribe was reconvened.\n\nThe floor of the valley seemed a trifle obscured. The mist that hung\nalways in the air made it seem less distinct; less actual; not quite as\nreal as it had been.\n\nBurl gulped and said sternly:\n\n\"Where are the sharp things?\"\n\nThe men looked at one another, numbly. Then one spoke despairingly,\nignoring Burl's question. \"Now,\" said the man dully, \"there was not only\nthe hunting-spider in the valley, but its young. And not only the young\nof the hunting-spider, but the young of a mantis ... It was hard to stay\nalive at the best of times. Now it had become impossible ...\"\n\nBurl glared at him. It was neither courage nor resolution. He had come\nto realize what a splendid sensation it was to be admired by one's\nfellows. The more he was admired, the better. He was enraged that people\nthought to despair.\n\n\"I,\" said Burl haughtily, \"am _not_ going to stay here. I go to a place\nwhere there are neither spiders nor mantises. Come!\"\n\nHe held out his hand to Saya. She gave the child to its mother and look\nhis hand. Burl stalked haughtily away, and she went with him. He went\nuphill. Naturally. He knew there were spiders and mantises in the\nvalley. So many that to stay there was to die. So he went away from\nwhere they were.\n\nBurl had found out that adulation was enjoyable and authority\ndelectable. He had found that it was pleasant to be a dictator. And then\nhe had been disregarded. So he marched furiously away from his folk, in\nexactly the fashion of a spoiled child refusing to play any longer. He\nhappened to march up the mountainside toward the cloud-bank that he\nconsidered the sky. He had no conscious intent to climb the mountain. He\ndid not intend to lead the others. He meant to sulk, by punishing them\nthrough the removal of his own admirable person from their society. But\nthey followed him.\n\nSo he led his people upward. It has happened on other planets, in other\nmanners. Most human achievements come about through the daring of those\nwho strive.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe sun was very near. It shone upon the top of the cloud-bank and the\nclouds glowed with a marvelous whiteness. It shone upon the\nmountain-peaks where they penetrated the clouds, and the peaks were\nwarmed, and there was no snow anywhere despite the height. There were\nwinds here where the sun shone. The sky was very blue. At the edge of\nthe plateau where the cloud-bank lay below, the mountainsides seemed to\ndescend into a sea of milk. Great undulations in the mist had the\nseeming of waves, which moved with great deliberation toward the shores.\nThey seemed sometimes to break against the mountain-wall where it was\ncliff-like, and sometimes they seemed to flow up gentler inclinations\nlike water flowing up a beach.\n\nAll this was in the slowest of slow motion, because the cloud-waves were\nsometimes miles from crest to crest.\n\nThe look of things was different on the plateau, too. This part of the\nunnamed world, no less than the lowlands, had been seeded with life on\ntwo separate occasions. Once with bacteria and moulds and lichens to\nbreak up the rocks and make soil of them, and once with seeds and\ninsects-eggs and such living things as might sustain themselves\nimmediately upon hatching. But here on the heights the conditions were\ndrastically unlike the lowland tropic moisture. Different things had\nthriven, and in quite different fashion.\n\nHere moulds and yeasts and rusts were stunted by the sunlight. Grasses\nand weeds and trees survived, instead. This was an ideal environment for\nplants that needed sunlight to form chlorophyll, and chlorophyll to\nmake use of the soil that had been formed. So here was vegetation that\nwas nearly Earth-like. And there was a remarkable side-effect on the\nfauna which had been introduced at the same time and in the same manner\nas down below. In coolness which amounted to a temperate climate there\ncould be no such frenzy of life as formed the nightmare-jungles in the\nlowlands. Plants grew at a slower tempo than fungi, and less\nluxuriantly. There was no adequate food-supply for large-sized\nplant-eaters. Insects which were to survive in sunshine could not grow\nto be monsters. Moreover, the nights were chill. Many insects grow\ntorpid in the cool of a temperate-zone night, but warm up to activity\nsoon after sunrise. But a large creature, made torpid by cold, will not\nrevive so quickly. If large enough, it will not become fully active\nuntil close to dusk. On the plateau, the lowland monsters would starve\nin any case. But more--they would have only a fraction of a day of full\nactivity.\n\nThere was a necessary limit then, to the size of the insects that lived\nabove the clouds. The life on the plateau would not have seemed\nhorrifying at all to humans living on other planets. Save for the\nabsence of birds to sing and lack of a variety of small mammals, the\nuntouched sunlit plateau with its warm days and briskly chill nights\nwould have impressed most men as an ideal habitation.\n\nBut Burl and his companions were hardly prepared to see it that way at\nfirst glimpse. Certainly if told about it beforehand, they would have\nviewed it with despair.\n\nBut they did not know beforehand. They toiled upward, their leader moved\nby such ridiculous motives as have sometimes caused men to achieve\ngreatness throughout all history. Back on Earth, two great continents\nwere discovered by a man trying to get spices to conceal the gamey\nflavor of half-spoiled meat. The power that drives mile-long\nspace-craft, and that lights and runs the cities of the galaxy, was\nfirst developed because it could be used in bombs to kill other men.\nThere were precedents for Burl leading his fellows into sunshine merely\nbecause he was angered that they ceased to admire him.\n\nThe trudging, climbing folk were high above the valley, now. The thin\nmist that was never absent anywhere had hidden their former home, little\nby little. They climbed a steeply slanting mountain-flank. The stone was\nmostly covered by ragged, bluish-green rock-tripe in partly overlapping\nsheets. Such stuff is always close behind the bacteria which first\nattack a rock-face. On a slope, it clings while soil is washed downward\nas fast as it forms. The people never ate it. It produced frightening\ncramps. In time they would learn that if thoroughly dried it can he\nsoaked to pliability again and cooked to a reasonable palatability. But\nso far they knew neither dryness nor fire.\n\nNor had they ever known such surroundings as presently enveloped them. A\nslanting, stony mountainside which stretched up frighteningly to the\nvery sky. Grayness overhead. Grayness, also, to one side--the side away\nfrom the mountain. And equal grayness below. The valley in which they\nlived could no longer be seen at all. Trudging and scrambling up the\ninterminable incline, the people of Burl's personal following gradually\nrealized the strangeness of their surroundings. As one result, they grew\nsick and dizzy. To them it seemed that the solid earth had tilted, and\nmight presently tilt further. There was no horizon, but they had never\nseen a horizon. So they felt that what had been _down_ was now partly\n_behind_, and they feared lest a turning universe let them fall\nultimately toward the grayness they considered sky.\n\nIn this frightening strangeness, their only consolation was the company\nof their fellows. To stop would be to be abandoned in this place where\nall values were turned topsy-turvy. To go back--but none of them could\nimagine descending again to be devoured as one-third of their number\nalready had been. If Burl had stopped, his followers would have squatted\ndown and shivered together miserably, and waited for death. They had no\nthought of adventure nor any hope of safety. The only goodnesses they\ncould imagine were food and the nearness of other humans. They clung\ntogether, obsessed by the dread of being left alone.\n\nBurl's motivation was no longer noble. He had started uphill in a fit of\nsulks, and he was ashamed to stop.\n\nThey came to a place where the mountain-flank sank inward. There was a\nflat area, and behind it there was a winding ca\u00f1on of sorts, like a vast\ncrack in the mountain's substance. Burl breasted the curving edge, and\nwalked on level ground. Then he stopped short.\n\nThe mouth of the ca\u00f1on was perhaps fifty yards from the lip of the\ndownward slope. There was this level space, and on it there were\ntoadstools and milkweed, and there was food. It was a small, isolated\nasylum for life such as they were used to. It could have been that here\nthey could have found safety. But it wasn't that way.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey saw the web at once. It was slung from between the opposite\ncliff-walls by cables two hundred feet long. Its radiating cables\nreached down to anchorages on stone. The snare-threads, winding out and\nout in that logarithmic spiral which men on other planets had noted\nthousands of years before--the snare-threads were a yard apart. The web\nwas set for giant game. It was empty now, but Burl searched keenly and\nsaw the tight-rope-cable leading from the very center of the web to a\nrocky shelf some fifty feet above the ca\u00f1on's floor. At its end he saw\nthe spider. It waited there, almost invisible against the stone, with\none furry leg touching the cable that led to its waiting-place so that\nthe slightest touch on any part of the web would warn it instantly.\n\nBurl's followers accumulated behind him. They stared. They knew, of\ncourse, that a web-spider will not leave its snare under any normal\ncircumstances. They were not afraid of that. But they looked at the\nground between the web and themselves.\n\nIt was a charnel-house of murdered creatures. Half-inch-thick wing-cases\nof dead beetles. The cleaned-out carcasses of other giants. The\novipositor of an ichneumon-fly--six feet of slender, springy,\ndeadly-pointed tube--and abdomen-plates of bees and draggled antennae of\nmoths and butterflies.\n\nSomething very terrible lived in this small place. The mountainsides\nwere barren of food for big flying things. Anything which did fly so\nhigh for any reason would never land on sloping, foodless stone. It\nwould land here. And very obviously it would die. Because\nsomething--something--killed them as they came. It denned back in the\nca\u00f1on where they could not see. It dined here.\n\nThe humans looked and shivered. All but Burl. He deliberately chose for\nhimself a magnificent lance grown by one dead creature for its own\ndefense. He pulled it out of the ground and cleaned it with his hands.\nHe seemed absorbed, but he was terribly aware of the inner depths of the\nca\u00f1on. He was actually pretending, for the sake of what he believed his\ndignity.\n\nFearfully, the other humans imitated him in choosing weapons from the\narmory of the devoured. Then Burl stalked grandly to one side and began\nto climb again. His people followed him in numbed silence. They were\nfilled with dread, but it was not quite terror. Insects do not stalk\ntheir prey. The deadly unseen monster of the ca\u00f1on had not attacked\nthem. Therefore, it did not know they were there. And therefore they\nwere safe from it until it appeared. But none of them desired to stay.\n\nThe slope lessened here, and half a mile further on there was a small\nthicket of mushrooms. From within it came the cheerful loud clicking of\nsome small beetle, arrived at this spot nobody could possibly know how,\nbut happily ensconced in a twenty-yard patch of jungle above a hollow\nthat had gathered soil through the centuries. There were edible\nmushrooms in the thicket.\n\nThe humans ate. Naturally. And here they realized that they were no\nlonger doomed by the creatures in the valley. Since their climb began\nthey had seen no dangerous thing except the one gigantic, motionless\nweb-spider. They had left the valley and its particular dangers behind.\n\nA man exclaimed in na\u00efve astonishment. He was eating raw mushroom at the\nmoment, and his mouth was full. But abruptly it occurred to him that\ntheir doom was lifted. He mentioned the fact in a sort of startled\nwonder.\n\n\"We will stay here,\" he added happily. \"There is food.\"\n\nAnd Burl regarded him with knitted brows. Burl was well on the way to\nbecoming spoiled. He had tasted power over his folk, and he found\nhimself jealous of any decision by anybody else.\n\n\"I go on,\" he said haughtily. \"Now! You may stay behind if you\nwish--alone!\"\n\nHe broke off food for the journey. He held out his hand to Saya. He went\non. And again he went upward because to go back was to go to the ca\u00f1on\nof the unknown killer. And his folk docilely followed him. They did not\nreally reason about it. To follow him had become a pattern, more or less\nprecarious. In time it could become a habit. Over a period of years it\ncould even become a tradition.\n\nThe procession marched on and up. Burl noticed that the air seemed\nclearer, here. It was not the misty, quasi-transparent stuff of the\nvalley. He could see for miles to right and left, and the curvatures of\nthe mountain-face. But he could not see the valley.\n\nThen he realized that the cloud-bank he saw was finite--an object. He\nhad never thought of it specifically before. To him it had seemed simply\nthe sky.\n\nNow he saw an indefinite lower surface which yet definitely hid the\nheights toward which he moved. He and his followers were less than a\nthousand feet below it. It appeared to Burl that presently he would run\ninto an obstacle that would simply keep him from going any further. But\nuntil that happened he obstinately continued to climb.\n\nThe thing which was the sky appeared to stir. It moved. A little higher,\nand he could see that there were parts of it which were lower than he\nwas. They moved also. But they did not approach him. And he had no\nexperience of anything inimical which did not plunge upon its victims.\nTherefore he was not afraid.\n\nIn fact, a little later he observed that the whiteness retreated before\nhim, and he was pleased. Weak things such as humans fled aside when\npredators approached. Here was something which fled aside at his\napproach. His followers undoubtedly observed the same phenomenon. He had\nkilled a spider. He was a remarkable person. This unknown white stuff\nwas afraid of him.\n\nBurl, with bland conceit, marched confidently through the cloud-bank,\never climbing. At its thickest, he could see only feet in each\ndirection, but always when he advanced threateningly upon opacity, it\ncleared before him.\n\nPresently the gray light grew brighter. Burl and his folk were\naccustomed to a shadowless illumination such as fungi could endure--the\nequivalent of a heavily overcast day on an Earth-type planet. Now the\nmist about him took on a luminosity which was of a different kind.\nSuddenly he noticed the silence. He had never known even comparative\nsilence before in all his life. His ears had been assailed every minute\nsince he had been born by a din which was the noise of creatures. By\nstridulations, by chirpings, by screams, or at the least by the clicking\nof armor or the deep-toned pulsations of wings. He had always lived in\nthe uproar of frenzied struggle. Now, that hellish chorus of shrieks and\ncries and mating-calls was cut off. The lower surface of the cloud-bank\nreflected it. Burl and his people moved upward through an unparalleled\nstillness.\n\nThey fell silent, marveling. They heard each other's movements. They\ncould hear each other's voices. But they moved in a vast quietness over\nstones which here were not even lichen-covered, but glistened with wet.\nAnd all about them a golden glow hung in the very air. Stillness, and\nquietude, and golden light which grew stronger and stronger and\nstronger....\n\nIt was very remarkable when they came up through the sea of mist upon a\nshore of sunshine, and saw blue sky and sunlight for the first time. The\nlight smote upon their pink skins and brilliantly colored furry\ngarments. It glinted in changing, ever-more-colorful flashes upon the\ncloaks made of butterfly wings. It sparkled upon the great lance carried\nby Burl in the lead, and the quite preposterous weapons borne by his\nfollowers.\n\nThe little party of twenty humans waded ashore through the last of the\nthinning white stuff which was cloud. They gazed about them with\nblinking, wondering, astounded eyes. The sky was blue. There was green\ngrass. And there was sound. The sound was of wind blowing in the trees\nand sunshine.\n\nThey heard insects, too, but they did not know what it was they heard.\nThe shrill, small musical whirrings, the high-pitched small cries which\nmade up a strange new elfin melody, were totally strange. All things\nwere novel to their eyes, and an enormous exultation filled them. From\ndeep-buried ancestral memories, they knew that this was somehow right,\nwas somehow normal. And they breathed clean air for the first time in\nmany generations.\n\nBurl even shouted, in triumph, and his voice rang echoing among rocks.\n\nThe plateau rang with the shouting of a man in triumph!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey had enough food for days. They had brought it from the isolated\nthicket not too far beneath the clouds. Had they found other food\nimmediately, they would have settled down comfortably, in the fashion\nnormal to creatures whose idea of bliss is a secure hiding-place and\nfood on hand. Somehow they believed that this high place was secure. But\nit was not a hiding-place. And though they did accept, with the\nsimplicity of children and savages, that they had no enemies here, their\nfirst quest, nevertheless, was for a place in which they could conceal\nthemselves.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThey found a cave. It was small to hold all of them, so that they would\nbe crowded in it, but, as it turned out, that was fortunate.\n\nAt some time it had been occupied by some other creature, but the dirt\nwhich floored it had settled flat and there were no recent tracks. It\nretained faint traces of an odor which was unfamiliar but not\nunpleasant. It had no connotation of danger.\n\nAnts stank of formic acid plus the musky odor of their particular city\nand kind. One could tell not only the kind of ant but what hill they\ncame from, from a mere sniff at a well-traveled ant-trail. Spiders had\ntheir own hair-raising odor. The smell of a praying-mantis was acrid,\nand of beetles decay, and of course those bugs whose main defense was\nsmell gave off an effluvium which tended to strangle all but themselves.\n\nThe cave's smell was quite different. The humans thought vaguely that it\nmight be another kind of man. Actually, it _was_ the smell of a\nwarm-blooded animal. But Burl and his fellows knew of no warm-blooded\ncreatures but themselves.\n\nThey had come above the clouds a bare two hours before sunset--of which\nthey knew nothing. For an hour they marveled, staying close together.\nThey were astounded by the sun, more particularly since they could not\nlook at it. But presently, being savages, they accepted it with the\nmatter-of-factness of children.\n\nThey could not cease to wonder at the vegetation about them. They were\naccustomed only to gigantic fungi, and a few feverishly growing plants\nstriving to flower and bear seed before being devoured. Here they saw\nmany plants, and at first no insects at all. However, they looked only\nfor the large things they were accustomed to.\n\nThey were astounded by the slenderness of the plants. Grass fascinated\nthem, and weeds. A large part of their courage came from the absence of\ndebris upon the ground. In the valley, the habitation of a trapdoor\nspider was marked by grisly trophies--armor emptied of all meat but not\nyet rotted by the highly specialized bacteria which flourished upon\nchitin. The hunting-ground of even a mantis was marked by discarded,\ntransparent beetle-wings and sharp spiny bits of armor, and mandibles\nnot tasty enough to be consumed. Here, in the first hour of their\nexploration, they saw no sign that any insect from the lowlands had ever\ncome to this place at all. But they interpreted the fact quite correctly\nas rarity, rather than complete absence of huge creatures blundering up\ninto the sunlight.\n\nThey were relieved that they had found a cave. There was no thicket of\ntrees close-growing enough to shelter them. They were ludicrously amazed\nwhen they found that trees were hard and solid, because the fungi they\nknew were easily cut by sawtoothed tools. They found nothing to eat, but\nthey were not yet hungry. They did not worry about it while they still\nhad bits of edible mushroom from their climb.\n\nWhen the sun sank low and the crimson colorings filled the western\nhorizon, they shivered. They watched the glory of their first sunset\nwith scared, incredulous eyes. Yellows and reds and purples reared\ntoward the zenith. It became possible to look and gaze directly at the\nsun. They saw it descend behind something they could not guess at. Then\nthere was dark.\n\nThe fact stunned them. So night came like this!\n\nThen they saw the stars as they winked singly into being. And the folk\nfrom the lowland crowded frantically into the cave with its faint odor\nof having once been occupied. They filled the cave tightly. But Burl was\nsomewhat reluctant to admit his fear, and Saya lingered close to him.\nThey were the last to enter.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNothing happened. Nothing. The sounds of evening continued. They were\nstrange but infinitely soothing and somehow what night-sounds ought to\nbe. Burl and the others could not possibly analyze it, but for the first\ntime in many generations they were in an environment really similar to\nthat intended for their race. It had a rightness and a goodness about it\nwhich was perceptible for all its novelty. And because Burl had once\nbeen lost from his tribe, he was capable of estimating novelties a\nlittle better than the rest.\n\nHe listened to the night-noises from close by the cave's small entrance.\nHe heard the breathing of his tribesmen. He felt the heat of their\nbodies, keeping the crowded enclosure warm enough for all. Saya was\nclose beside him. She held fast to his arm for reassurance. He was\nwakeful, and thinking very busily and very painfully.\n\nSaya was filled with a tumult that was combined fear of the unknown and\nrelief from much greater fear of the familiar ... and warm, proud\nmemories of the sight of Burl leading and commanding the others, and\nmemories of the look and feel of sunshine, and pictures of sky and\ngrass and trees which she had never seen before. Emotion-filled memories\nof Burl as he killed a spider! Flinging a ball-fungus at a hatchling\nmantis, saving a young boy. Grandly leading the others up the\nmountainside which it had never occurred to anybody else to climb.\nKeeping onward sternly when it seemed that the solid ground had twisted\nand would drop them into a misplaced sky. And now, between her and the\ndoorway to the strange and very beautiful night outside.\n\nSaya felt an absorbed, impassioned, delectable disquiet from the touch\nof Burl's arm beneath her fingers.\n\nHe stirred. She whispered a question.\n\n\"I am going out,\" he murmured in her ear. \"I wish to see the lights. To\nsee if they come nearer, or move.\"\n\nIt had occurred to him that the first few stars they had seen glowed in\ndarkness like the giant fireflies of the valley. They were comparable in\nsize to all the enlarged insect kingdom. They were a yard and more in\nlength, and sometimes at night they soared and wheeled above the lowland\nfungus jungles, and the segmented larval females of their kind, which\nnever grew wings, grew frantic at the sight. They climbed recklessly\nupon the flat tops of toadstools and waved their dimmer twinned lanterns\nat the flying males.\n\nBut this was not the lowland. Burl freed his arm from Saya's fingers. He\ncrept through the constricted opening of the cave, carrying his lance\nbefore him. He already had a vague idea that it should be not only an\ninstrument but a weapon. He imagined stabbing enemy creatures with\nit--but only vaguely, as yet.\n\nHe stood upright in the open air. There was coolness. Night had fallen,\nbut only a little while since. There were smells in the air such as Burl\nhad never smelled before--green things growing, and the peculiar clean\nodor of wind that has been bathed in sunshine, and the peculiarly\nsatisfying fragrance of coniferous trees.\n\nBut Burl raised his eyes to the heavens. He saw the stars in all their\nglory, and he was the first man in at least forty generations to look at\nthem from this planet. There were myriads upon myriads of them, varying\nin brightness from stabbing lights to infinitesimal twinklings. They\nwere of every possible color. They hung in the sky above him, immobile\nand unthreatening. They had not come nearer. They were very beautiful.\n\n[Illustration: \"_... he was the first man in ... forty generations to\nlook at them._\"]\n\nBurl stared. And then he noticed that he was breathing deeply, with a\nnew zest. He was filling his lungs with clean, cool, fragrant air such\nas men were intended to breathe from the beginning, and of which Burl\nand many others had been deprived. It was almost intoxicating to feel so\nsplendidly alive and unafraid.\n\nThere was a rustling. Saya stood beside him, trembling a little. To\nleave the others had required great courage. But she had come to realize\nthat if any danger befell Burl she wished to share it. So she had come.\nThey shared the starlight.\n\nThey heard the nightwind and the orchestra of night-singers. They\nwandered aside from the cave-mouth, and Saya found completely primitive\nand wholly atavistic pride in the courage of Burl, who was actually not\nafraid of the dark! Her own uneasiness became merely something to give\nmore savor to her pride in him. She stayed close beside him, not only\nfor reassurance but also for joy in being close to him.\n\nPresently they heard a new sound in the night. It was very far away and\nnot in the least like any sound they had ever heard before. It changed\nin pitch. Insect-cries do not. It was a baying, yelping sound. It rose\nin pitch, and held the higher note, and abruptly dropped in pitch before\nit ceased. Minutes later it came again.\n\nSaya shivered, but Burl said thoughtfully:\n\n\"That is a good sound.\"\n\nHe didn't know why. Saya shivered once more. She said reluctantly:\n\n\"I am cold.\"\n\nIt had been a rare sensation in the lowlands. It came only after one of\nthe infrequent thunderstorms, when wetted human bodies were exposed to\nthe gusty winds that otherwise rarely blew there. But here the nights\ngrew cold, after sundown. The heat in the ground radiated to outer space\nat night, not being trapped by a layer of clouds. Before dawn, the\ntemperature would be close to freezing, though anything worse than a\nlight fleeting hoar-frost would be rare on this plateau.\n\nThe two of them went back to the cave. It was warm there. The cave was\nso packed with humans that their body-heat kept the air from growing\nchill. Burl and Saya crouched among the rest, and became drowsy and\ncomfortable. Presently Saya dropped off to sleep, her hand trustfully in\nBurl's.\n\nBut he remained awake for a long time, blinking. He thought of the\nstars, but they were too strange. He thought of the trees and grass. But\nmost of the impressions of this upper world were so remote from previous\nknowledge that he could only accept them as they were and defer\nreflection upon them until later. But he did feel an enormous\ncomplacency, what with having brought his followers to an effective\nparadise of safety, and having arrived at a completely satisfactory\nemotional status with Saya.\n\nBut the last thing he actually thought about, before his eyes blinked\nshut in sleep, was that yelping noise he had heard in the night. It was\ntotally novel in kind, yet there was something buried among his racial\nheritages that told him it was good.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBurl was first awake of all the tribesmen and he looked out into a cold\nand pallid grayness. He saw trees. One side of the cluster was brightly\nlighted, the other side was dark. He heard tiny singing noises of the\ncreatures of this place. Presently he crawled out of the cave to scout\nfor danger.\n\nThe air was biting in its chill. It was an excellent reason why giant\ninsects could not survive here, but it was particularly invigorating as\nhe breathed it in. Then he summoned courage to move to where he could\npeer at the source of this strange light.\n\nHe saw the top of the sun as it peered above the eastern cloud-bank. The\nsky grew lighter. He blinked at the sun and saw it rise more fully into\nview. He thought to look upward, and the stars that had bewildered him\nwere nearly gone.\n\nHe ran to call Saya.\n\nThe rest of the tribe waked as he roused her. One by one they followed,\nto watch their first sunrise. The men and women gaped at the sun as it\nfilled the east with colorings and rose above the seemingly steaming\nlayer of clouds and then appeared to spring free of the horizon and swim\non upward.\n\nThe children blinked and shivered and crept to their mothers for warmth.\nThe women enclosed them in their cloaks, and they thawed and peered out\nonce more at the glory of sunshine and the day. Soon, though, they\nrealized that warmth came from the glaring body in the sky. The\nchildren presently discovered a game. It was the first game they had\never played, and it consisted simply of running into a shaded place\nuntil they shivered, and then of running out into the sunshine again\nwhere they were warm. Until this dawning they had never been free enough\nfrom fear to play at all. But this discovery of the nightly chill and of\nthe utility of cloaks for warmth up here as well as it had been against\nthe nightly rain of the lowlands, was a specific suggestion of the value\nof clothing. Which was to have another significance, a short time later.\n\nIn this first dawn of their experience, the tribesmen ate of the edible\nmushroom they had brought up the mountain-flank. But there was not an\nindefinite amount of food left. Burl shared the meal Saya brought him.\nShe touched him fondly. But he regarded his happy fellows with something\nlike a scowl. They were quite contented, and they had for the moment no\nneed of his guidance. They did not look to him for orders. And Burl\nwanted attention.\n\nHe spoke abruptly.\n\n\"We do not want to go back to the place we came from,\" he said sternly.\n\"We must look for food here, so we can stay for always. Today we look\nfor food.\"\n\nIt was a seizure of the initiative. It was the linking of what the folk\nmost craved with obedience to Burl. It was the instinct of a leader. The\neating men murmured agreement. There was a certain definite idea of\ngoodness--not moral virtue, but of the desirable--becoming associated\nwith what Burl did and what Burl commanded. His tribe was becoming a\ngroup of which he was the leader, rather than only a loose association\nheld together only by the fear of solitude.\n\nHe led them exploring as soon as they had eaten. All of them, of course.\nNone had yet become confident enough to be left behind. They straggled\nirregularly behind Burl and Saya. They came to a brook and regarded it\nwith amazement. There were no leeches. No fungus. No swiftly drifting\nislands of scum. It was clear. Greatly daring, Burl tasted it and it was\nwater, but such as he had never tasted before. It was clean, fresh,\nsparkling water, not fouled by drainage through mould or rust.\n\nThe rest of the tribe tasted. A child slipped on a muddy place and sat\ndown hard on white stuff that yielded and almost splashed. The child\nhowled. Saya picked it up. Then she looked where it had been for spines\nor small stinging things.\n\nShe stared blankly.\n\nShe went to Burl with a tiny white thing in her hand. It was a mushroom.\nBut it was a _tiny_, clean, appetizing object. Saya had no words for it.\nShe was amazed.\n\nBurl smelled it carefully. He tasted it. And it was actually no more and\nno less than a normal mushroom, growing in a shaded place upon\nenormously rich soil. It had been protected from sunlight, but it had\nnot the means nor the stimulus to become a monster.\n\nBurl ate it. He carefully composed his features. Then he announced the\nfind to his followers.\n\nThere was food here, he told them. But in this splendid world to which\nhe had led them, food was small. There would be no great enemies here,\nbut the food would have to be sought in small objects rather than great\nones. They must look at this place and seek others like it, where food\nwould be found....\n\nThe tribesmen were doubtful. But they plucked mushrooms--whole\nones!--instead of merely breaking off parts of their tops. In deep\nastonishment they recognized miniatures of what they had known only in\ngigantic forms. They tasted. The tiny mushrooms had the same savor, but\nthey were not coarse or stringy or tough like the giants. They melted in\nthe mouth! Life in this place to which Burl had led them was delectable!\nTruly the doings of Burl were astonishing!\n\nWhen a child found a beetle on a leaf, and they recognized it, they were\nentranced, for instead of being bigger than a man and a thing to flee\nfrom, it was less than an inch in size and helpless against them. From\nthat moment on, they would follow Burl anywhere and obey him in any\nmatter, in the happy conviction that he could do nothing that was not\ndesirable in all respects.\n\nThe belief, of course, was not quite accurate. Tender tiny mushrooms as\na staple, instead of the tough and chewy provender they were used to, in\ntime would cause them to have toothaches. But they could not anticipate\nit, and it was actually very far away in time.\n\nThey struggled after Burl through vast patches of bushes with thorns on\nthem. They were not used to thorns, and they deeply distrusted the\nbushes and even the glistening fruit on them, which eventually they\nwould know were blackberries. Near midday they heard noises in the\ndistance.\n\nThe sounds were made up of cries of varying pitch, some of which were\nsharp and abrupt, and others longer and less loud. The people did not\nunderstand them in the least. They could have been the cries of human\nbeings, but they were assuredly not cries of pain. Also they were not\nlanguage. They seemed to convey an impression of enormous, zestful\nexcitement. They had no overtone of horror. And Burl and his folk had\nknown of no excitement among insects except the frenzy of ferocity. They\nwere unable to imagine even the nature of the tumult.\n\nTo Burl the cries seemed to have somewhat the timbre of the yelping\nsounds he had heard the night before. And he had felt instinctively\ndrawn to that sound. He liked it.\n\nHe led the way boldly in the direction of the noise. And presently he\ncame out of breast-high weeds with Saya close behind him and the others\ntrailing. He emerged upon a space of bare stone, a little upraised. He\nlooked down into a small and grassy amphitheater. The tumult came from\nits center.\n\nA pack of dogs were joyously attacking something that Burl could not see\nclearly. They _were dogs_. They barked zestfully, and they yelped and\nsnarled and yapped in a dozen different voices, and they darted at the\nunseen something and darted away, and they were having a thoroughly\nenjoyable time, though it might not be so good for the thing they\nattacked.\n\nOne of them saw the humans and stopped stock-still and barked. The\nothers whirled and saw the humans as they came out into view. The tumult\nceased entirely.\n\nThere was silence. The men for the first time saw creatures with only\nfour legs. They had never before seen any moving thing with fewer than\nsix--except men. Spiders had eight. The dogs did not have mandibles.\nThey did not act like insects.\n\nAnd the dogs saw men, whom they had never seen before. Much more\nimportant, they smelled men. And the difference between man-smell and\nthat of insects was vast. Through many generations the dogs had not\nsmelled anything with warm blood save their own kind. The difference in\nsmell between insect and man was so great that the dogs did not react\nwith suspicion, but with curiosity. This was an unparalleled smell. It\nwas even a good smell.\n\nThe dogs regarded the men with their heads on one side, sniffing them in\nthe deepest possible amazement--amazement so intense that they could not\nfeel hostility. One of them whined a little because he did not\nunderstand.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPeculiarly enough, it was a matter of topography. The plateau which\nreached above the clouds rose with a steep slope from the valley in\nwhich Burl and the others had lived. To westward, however, the highland\nwas subject to an indentation which almost severed it. No more than\ntwenty miles from where Burl's group had climbed to sunshine, there was\na much more gradual slope downward. There, mushroom-forests grew almost\nto the cloud-layer. From there, giant insects strayed up and onto the\nplateau itself. They could not live on the plateau, of course. There was\nno food for their insatiable hunger. Especially at night, there was no\nwarmth to keep them active. But they did stray from their normal\nenvironment, and some of them reached the sunshine, and perhaps some of\nthem blundered back down to their mushroom-forests again. But those that\ndid not find their way back were chilled to torpor during their first\nnight on the highland. They were only partly active on the second day\nif, indeed, they were active at all. And few or none recovered from the\nsecond night of cold. Certainly none kept their full ferocity and\ndeadliness. And this was how the dogs survived.\n\nUnquestionably the dogs were descended from dogs on the wrecked\nship--name now unknown--which had landed on this planet some forty-odd\nhuman generations since. The humans had no memories of that ship, and\nthe dogs had surely no traditions. But perhaps because those early dogs\nhad less of intellect, they had possessed more useful instincts. Perhaps\ndogs were bred by the first desperate generations of humans, to warn\nthem against dangers. But no human civilization could survive the\nenvironment of the lowlands. The humans inevitably reverted to the\nprimitive. The environment was not one in which dogs could survive, so\nsomehow they took to the heights. Perhaps dogs survived their masters.\nPerhaps some were abandoned or driven away. But dogs had reached the\nheights. And they did survive because of the simple fact that giant\ninsects blundered up after them--and could not survive the proper\nenvironment for dogs and men.\n\nThere was even a reason why they had not multiplied excessively. The\nfood-supply was limited. When there were too many dogs, their attacks on\nstumbling insects were more desperate, and made earlier before ferocity\nof the insects was lessened. And more dogs died. So there was a specific\nadjustment of the dog population to the food-supply. There was also a\nselection of those intelligent enough not to attack foolishly, but not\nof those whose cowardice left them out of conflict altogether.\n\nThese dogs who regarded men with their heads cocked on one side were\nexcellent dogs. Intelligent dogs. They did not attack anything\nimprudently, and they knew it was not necessary to be more than wary of\ninsects in general. Even spiders, unless they were very newly arrived\nfrom the lowlands. So the attitude of men and dogs was that of\nastonished curiosity rather than that of instant fear or rage. Burl knew\nthat the shaggy, bright-eyed creatures were unlike insects. Actually,\nthey behaved strikingly like men. They were estimating these strange\nbeings, men. Insects never estimated. Those that were not carnivorous\nhad no interest in anything but food, and those that were carnivorous\nlumbered insanely into battle the instant any prey came to their notice.\nThe dogs did neither. They sniffed. They considered. They were amazed.\n\nBurl said harshly to his group:\n\n\"Stay here!\"\n\nHe walked slowly down into the amphitheater. Saya, disregarding his\norder, followed him instantly. The dogs moved warily aside. But they\nraised their noses and sniffed--long, luxurious sniffs. The smell of\nhumankind was a good smell. Dogs had gone hundreds of generations\nwithout having it in their nostrils. But before that there were\nthousands of generations of dogs to whom that smell was a fulfillment.\n\nBurl reached the object the dogs had been attacking. It lay on the\ngrass, throbbing painfully. It had come up from the world below. It was\nthe larva of an azure-blue moth which spread ten-foot wings at\nnightfall. The time for its metamorphosis was near, and it had gone\nblindly in search of a place where it could spin its cocoon safely and\nchange to its winged form. It had come to another world--the world above\nthe clouds. It could find no proper place. Its stores of fat had\nprotected it a little from the chill. But the dogs had found it.\n\nBurl considered. It was the custom of wasps to sting creatures like this\nwithin a certain special spot--marked for them apparently by a tuft of\ndark fur.\n\nBurl thrust his lance into that particular spot. The creature died\nquickly and without agony. The thought to kill was an inspiration, which\nwas the result of continued adventuring. Burl cut off meat for his\ntribesmen. The dogs offered no objection. They were well-fed enough.\nBurl and Saya, together, carried the meat back to the blinking\ntribesfolk. On the way they passed within two yards of a dog which\nregarded them with extreme intent and almost a wistful expression. Their\nsmell did not mean game. It meant--something the dog struggled dumbly to\nremember.\n\n\"I have killed the thing,\" said Burl, in the tone of one speaking to an\nequal. \"You can go and eat it now. I took only part of it.\"\n\nThe dog wagged its tail--and then backed away as if in confusion. After\nall, matters had not yet progressed to cordiality.\n\nThe humans consumed what Burl had brought them. Most of the dogs went to\nthe feast Burl had left. Presently they were back. They had no reason to\nbe hostile. They were fed. The humans offered them no injury. The humans\nsmelled good. The dogs were fascinated by their smell.\n\nPresently they were close about the humans. They were not insects. They\nwere interested. The humans were extremely interested in anything which\nwas interested in them. It was a wholly novel experience. It was the\nfeeling Burl had felt in becoming the tribal leader. Now every human\nfelt a little of it, in the intent regard of the dogs. And everything\nelse was so strange that it was possible to accept anything without\nquestion. Even the possible friendliness of unparalleled creatures which\nassuredly were not of a kind with past enemies.\n\nA similar state of \"mind\" existed among the dogs.\n\nSaya had more meat than she desired. She looked about among the humans.\nAll were well supplied. She tossed it to a dog. He jerked away alertly,\nand then sniffed at the meat where it had dropped. A dog can always eat.\nHe ate it.\n\n\"I wish you would talk to us,\" said Saya hopefully.\n\nThe dog wagged his tail.\n\n\"You do not look like us,\" said Saya interestedly, \"but you act as we\ndo. Not as the--monsters!\"\n\nThe dog looked at meat in Burl's hand. Burl tossed it. The dog caught it\nwith a quick snap, swallowed it, wagged his tail briefly and came\ncloser. It was a completely incredible action, but dogs and men were\nblood-kin on this planet. Besides, there was subconscious racial-memory\ninstinct in friendship between man and dog. It was not overlaid by any\npast experience of either. They were the only warm-blooded creatures on\nthis world. It was kinship felt by both.\n\nBurl stood up and spoke politely to the dog. He addressed him with the\nsame respect he would have given to another man. In all his life he had\nnever felt equal to an insect, but he felt no arrogance toward this dog.\n\nHe felt superior only to other men.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"We are going back to our cave,\" he said politely. \"Maybe we will meet\nagain.\"\n\nHe led his tribe back to the cave in which they had spent the previous\nnight. The dogs followed, ranging on either side. They were well-fed,\nwith no memory of hostility to any creature which smelled like men. They\nhad instinct and intelligence. The latter part of the return to the\ncave--if anybody had been qualified to notice--was remarkably like a\ngroup of dogs taking a walk with a group of people. It was\ncompanionable. It felt remarkably right.\n\nThat night Burl left the cave, as before, to look at the stars. This\ntime Saya went with him, gladly. But as they emerged from the\ncave-entrance there was a stirring. A dog rose and stretched itself\nelaborately, yawning the while. When Burl and Saya walked aside from the\ncave, the dog trotted amiably with them.\n\nThey talked to it, embarrassed. And the dog seemed pleased. It wagged\nits tail.\n\nWhen morning came the dogs were still waiting hopefully for the humans\nto come out. They appeared to expect the humans to take another nice\nlong walk, on which they would accompany them. It was a brand-new\nsatisfaction they did not wish to miss. After all, from a dog's\nstandpoint, humans were made to take long walks with, among other\nthings. The dogs greeted the humans with tail-waggings and cordiality.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe friendship of the dogs assured the humans' new status in life. They\nhad ceased to be fugitive game for any insect murderer. They had hoped\nto be unpursued foragers. But, joined to the dogs, they were raised to\nthe estate of hunters. The men did not domesticate the dogs. They made\nfriends with them. The dogs did not subjugate themselves to the men.\nThey joined them, at first tentatively and then with worshipful\nenthusiasm. And the partnership was so inherently right that within a\nmonth it was as if it had been always. And indeed, except for a few\ncenturies, for them, it had.\n\nThe humans had made a permanent encampment by then. There were a few\ncaves at an appropriate distance from the slope up which most wanderers\nfrom the lowlands came. The humans moved into the caves. A child found\nthe chrysalis of a giant butterfly, whose caterpillar form had so\noffensive an odor that the dogs had not attacked it. But when it\nemerged from the chrysalis, humans and dogs together assailed it before\nit could take flight. They ended with warm approval of each other. The\nhumans had great wings with which to make cloaks. And men wore cloaks\nnow--shorter than the women's--but cloaks. They were very useful against\nthe evening chill. When one dawning a vast outcry of dogs awoke the\nhumans, Burl led the rush to the spot, and his great lance did execution\nwhich the dogs appeared to admire. Burl wore a moth's feathery antennae,\nnow, bound to his forehead like a knight's plumes. They were very\nsplendid.\n\nIn a single month their entire way of life went through a revolution.\nThe ground was often thorny. A man pierced his foot, and bandaged it\nwith a strip of wing-fabric so he could walk. The injured foot was more\ncomfortable to walk with than the well one. Within a week women were\nbusily contriving divers forms of footgear, to achieve the greatest\ncomfort. One day Saya admired glistening red berries and tried to pluck\nthem, and they stained her fingers. She licked the fingers--and berries\nwere added to the tribe's menu. A veritable orgy of experimentation\nbegan. And this was a state of affairs which is very, very rare among\nhuman beings. A tribe with an established culture and tradition cannot\nchange without disaster. But men who have abandoned their old ways and\nare seeking new ones can go far.\n\nAlready the dogs were established as sentries and watchmen and friends\nto every one of the humans. By now mothers did not feel alarmed if a\nchild wandered out of sight. There would be dogs along. No danger could\napproach a child without vociferous warning from the dogs. Men went\nhunting, now, with zestful tail-wagging dogs as companions in the chase.\nBy the time a stray monster from the lowlands reached this area, it was\ndazed and half-numbed by at least one night of bitter cold. Even spiders\ncould not find energy to leap. They fought like fiends, but sluggishly.\nMen could kill them while dogs kept their attention. Burl killed one\nthe third week on the plateau. He was nerved to the deed by a peculiar\nfeeling that he must be worthy of the courage of the dogs with him at\nthe time.\n\nAnd presently, while their way of life was still fluid, the permanent\npattern of civilization on the nightmare planet was settled. Burl and\nSaya went out early one morning with the dogs, to hunt for meat for the\nvillage. Hunting was easiest in the morning while creatures strayed up\nthe night before were still numbed. Often, hunting was merely butchery\nof an enfeebled monster to whom any sort of movement was enormous\neffort.\n\nThis morning the humans moved briskly. The dogs roamed exuberantly\nthrough the brush before them. They were five miles from the village\nwhen the dogs bayed game some distance ahead. And Burl and Saya ran to\nthe spot hand in hand--which was something of a change from their former\nactions at the thought of a giant creature of the insect kind--and found\nthe dogs dancing and barking around one of the most ferocious and most\nghastly of the carnivorous beetles. It was not too large, to be sure.\nIts body might have been four feet long, but its horrid mandibles added\nthree feet more.\n\nThose scythe-like objects gaped wide--opening sidewise as a beetle's\njaws do--and snapped hideously, swinging about as the dogs dashed at\nthem. The legs were spurred and spiked and armed with dagger-like\nspines. Burl plunged into the fight.\n\n[Illustration: \"_Those scythe-like objects gaped wide ... as the dogs\ndashed at them._\"]\n\nThe great gaping mandibles clicked and clashed. They were capable of\ndisemboweling a man or snapping a dog's body in half without effort.\nThere were whistling noises as the beetle breathed through its abdominal\nspiracles. It fought furiously, making frantic plunges at the dogs who\ndashed in and out to torment and bewilder it while they created the most\nzestfully excited of uproars.\n\nThere was something beside this conflict that Burl and Saya should have\nnoticed, but they were instantly intent. The other thing was quite\nunparalleled. There had been nothing else like it on this planet in many\nhundreds of years. It moved slowly above the plateau as if examining it.\nIt was half a dozen miles away and perhaps a mile higher when Burl and\nSaya prepared to intervene professionally on behalf of the dogs. Then it\nswerved and moved directly toward them. It moved swiftly.\n\nBut it was silent, and they did not know at all. Burl leaped in with a\nlance-thrust at the tough integument where an armored leg joined the\nbody. He missed, and the monster whirled. Then Saya flashed her cloak\nbefore the beetle, so that it seemed a larger and nearer antagonist. As\nthe creature whirled again, Burl thrust once more and a hind-leg\ncrumpled.\n\nInstantly the thing limped crazily. A beetle does not use its legs like\nfour-legged creatures. It moves the two end legs on one side with the\ncenter leg on the other, so that always it is braced on an adjustable\ntripod. But it cannot adjust readily to crippling.\n\nA dog snatched at a spiny lower leg and crunched and darted away. The\nexpressionless, machine-like horror uttered a formless, deep-bass cry\nand was spurred to all possible ferocity. The fight became a thing of\nfurious movement and uproar, with Burl striking once at a multiple eye\nso the pain would deflect it from a charge on Saya, and Saya again\ndeflecting it with her cloak and once breathlessly trying to strike it\nwith her shorter spear.\n\nThen the beetle sank to the ground, all three legs on one side crippled.\nThe remaining three thrust and thrust and struggled terribly and\nsuddenly it was on its back, still striking its gigantic jaws\nfrantically in the hope of murder. But Burl stabbed home between two\narmor-plates where a ganglion was almost exposed. A thrust killed it\ninstantly.\n\nBurl and Saya smiled at each other. There was a monstrous sound of\nsplintering trees. They whirled. The dogs pricked up their ears. One of\nthem barked defiantly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSomething huge--truly huge!--settled to the ground a bare hundred yards\naway. It was metal, and there were ports, and it was utterly beyond\nexperience, because, of course, there had been no spaceship landings on\nthis planet in forty-odd human generations. But as Burl and Saya stared\nblankly at it, a port opened, and men came out, and they waved hopefully\nto the two barbarically attired figures who had been seen fighting a\nmonster with the help of dogs. Which meant some sort of civilization.\n\nThe dogs confirmed it. They sniffed. These, also, were men. And Burl and\nhis tribe had this smell, and were friends. So the dogs trotted forward\nwith the self-confident cordiality of dogs on excellent terms with\nmen--and there was no question of friendship. None at all. The men came\nforward joyously to talk to Burl and Saya.\n\nThere were difficulties, of course. But Burl and Saya had the calm\ncomposure of savages, and the alertness of people who are changing the\npattern of their lives of their own volition--and finding it very\npleasant--and things went swimmingly. There was, on the spaceship, an\n\"educator.\" They invited Burl to put it on his head. He obliged. And\nvery shortly he understood a new language, and was equipped with a very\nconsiderable fund of general information. Among the items of information\nwas the fact that presently he would have a splitting headache--he\ndid--and that the making of records for an educator was so different\nthat it required generations to get all the facts and knowledge for a\nsingle type of education down in permanent form.\n\nAll of which fitted admirably into the arrangements that the men on the\nspaceship were anxious to make, and Burl was enthusiastically willing to\naccede to. He and his folk knew the creatures of the lowlands as nobody\nelse could possibly know them. No electronic educator could possibly\nmake a record making available that knowledge in less than two\ngenerations--maybe three. Therefore--\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe nightmare world swims in space about its nearby sun. It has a name\nnow, but it does not matter. It has a city on it, which probably matters\nless. It is a curious city, though. The people in it wear gorgeous\ncolored fur, and cloaks of butterfly wings. The least of the people in\nthat city wear garments which would fetch fortunes on other inhabited\nworlds. In fact, such garments do. But it is most practical for Burl,\nand Saya, and their followers to wear such garments. There is no day but\nthat a small, winged flying craft rises from the city to go silently\nover the plateau until it reaches the space above the cloud-bank, and\nthen dives down into it. It is wise for the occupants and the operators\nof such small craft to wear garments like the other humans on this\nplanet. They are recognized, that way, when garments such as most\nplanets find suitable would make them seem strange.\n\nThey want to be recognized, in the jungles and the noisesome valleys of\nthe lowlands. There are other humans down there. The people of the city,\nof course, bring their fellows out as fast as they can find them. There\nis a session with an educator--and a splitting headache afterward--and\nvery soon the folk who have hidden from monsters all their lives are\nzestfully hunting them with dogs. Presently they are hunting them with\nflying machines.\n\nIt is a nice arrangement. The search for more people in the lowlands is\na prosperous business even when it is unsuccessful. The wings of white\nmorph butterflies bring the highest price, but even a common\nswallow-tail is riches enough. And the fur of caterpillars--duly\nprocessed--goes into the holds of the regular spaceliners with the same\ncare given elsewhere to jewels and platinum.\n\nBut the nightmare planet has not become a merely sordid place of\nbusiness. What comforts and what luxuries spaceships can bring are\navailable enough, to be sure. But the city on the plateau, and the homes\nof the barbarically clad inhabitants are not places to which invitations\nare coveted for the luxury of them. The planet is a sportman's paradise.\n\nNot long since, the Planet President of _Surmor III_ was a guest in\nBurl's dwelling. Burl is all hard muscle, despite his graying hair, and\nhe and Saya have fitted very beautifully into the sort of civilization\nthat turned out to be congenial to them. They have grown children now,\nand their home is quite fit to entertain a World President in its\nrichness. But it is small--the size they want it to be.\n\nThe atmosphere is oddly informal. There are self-respecting and amiable\ndogs nearly everywhere. The World President of _Surmor III_ was inclined\nto be stand-offish at first. But he is a sportsman, like Burl. And since\nthe last hunting trip, he is very respectful. After all, there are few\nplanet leaders who will, as they do, for pure sporting joy of the hunt,\nfight the mastodon-sized tarantula of the lowlands with nothing but a\nspear--and win.\n\nBut Burl does.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Nightmare Planet, by Murray Leinster\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK NIGHTMARE PLANET ***\n\n***** This file should be named 42987-8.txt or 42987-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/4/2/9/8/42987/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Denny Lien, Mary Meehan and the\nOnline Distributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.  Email\ncontact links and up to date contact information can be found at the\nFoundation's web site and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
