GALLUN\n\n\n                        Illustrated by KOSSIN\n\n\n     _It's a funny thing, but most monsters seem to be of the\n      opinion that it's men who are the monsters. You know, they\n      have a point._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nTen minutes after the crackup, somebody phoned for the Army. That\nmeant us. The black smoke of the fire, and the oily residues, which\nwere later analyzed, proved the presence of a probable petroleum\nderivative. The oil was heavily tainted with radioactivity. Most\nlikely it was fuel from the odd, conchlike reaction-motors, the exact\nprinciples of which died, as far as we were concerned, with the\ncrash.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe craft was mainly of aluminum, magnesium and a kind of stainless\nsteel, proving that, confronted with problems similar to ones we had\nencountered, aliens might solve them in similar ways. From the\ncrumpled-up wreckage which we dug out of that Missouri hillside, Klein\neven noticed a familiar method of making girders and braces lighter.\nCircular holes were punched out of them at spaced intervals.\n\nI kept hunting conviction by telling myself that, for the first time\nin all remembered history, we were peeking behind the veil of another\nplanet. This should be the beginning of a new era, one of immensely\nwidened horizons, and of high romance--but with a dark side, too. The\nsky was no longer a limit. There were things beyond it that would have\nto be reckoned with. And how does unknown meet unknown? Suppose one\nhas no hand to shake?\n\nThe mass of that wreck reeked like a hot cinder-pile and a burning\ngarbage dump combined. It oozed blackened goo. There were crushed\npieces of calcined material that looked like cuttlebone. The thin\nplates of charred stuff might almost have been pressed cardboard.\nFoot-long tubes of thin, tin-coated iron contained combined chemicals\nidentifiable as proteins, carbohydrates and fats. Food, we decided.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNaturally, we figured that here was a wonderful clue to the plant and\nanimal life of another world. Take a can of ordinary beef goulash; you\ncan see the fibrous muscle and fat structure of the meat, and the\ncellular components of the vegetables. And here it was true, too, to a\nlesser degree. There were thin flakes and small, segmented cylinders\nwhich must have been parts of plants. But most was a homogeneous mush\nlike gelatin.\n\nEvidently there had been three occupants of the craft. But the crash\nand the fire had almost destroyed their forms. Craig, our biologist,\nmade careful slides of the remains, tagging this as horny epidermis,\nthis as nerve or brain tissue, this as skeletal substance, and this as\nmuscle from a tactile member--the original had been as thin as\nspaghetti, and dark-blooded.\n\nUnder the microscope, muscle cells proved to be very long and thin.\nNerve cells were large and extremely complex. Yet you could say that\nNature, starting from scratch in another place, and working through\nother and perhaps more numerous millions of years, had arrived at\nsomewhat the same results as it had achieved on Earth.\n\nI wonder how an other-world entity, ignorant of humans, would explain\na shaving-kit or a lipstick. Probably for like reasons, much of the\nstuff mashed into that wreck had to remain incomprehensible to us.\nWrenches and screwdrivers, however, we could make sense of, even\nthough the grips of those tools were not _hand_-grips. We saw screws\nand bolts, too. One device we found had been a simple crystal\ndiaphragm with metal details--a radio. There were also queer rifles.\nLord knows how many people have wondered what the extraterrestrial\nequivalents of common human devices would look like. Well, here were\nsome answers.\n\nA few of the instruments even had dials with pointers. And the numeral\n_1_ used on them was a vertical bar, almost like our own. But zero was\na plus sign. And they counted by twelves, not tens.\n\nBut all these parallels with our own culture seemed canceled by the\nfact that, even when this ship was in its original undamaged state, no\nman could have gotten inside it. The difficulty was less a matter of\nhuman size than of shape and physical behavior. The craft seemed to\nhave been circular, with compartmentation in spiral form, like a\nchambered nautilus.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis complete divergence from things we knew sent frost imps racing up\nand down my spine.\n\nAnd it prompted Blaine to say: \"I suppose that emotions, drives, and\npurposes among off-Earth intelligences must be utterly inconceivable\nto us.\"\n\nWe were assembled in the big trailer that had been brought out for us\nto live in, while we made a preliminary survey of the wreck.\n\n\"Only about halfway, Blaine,\" Miller answered. \"Granting that the\nlife-chemistry of those intelligences is the same as ours--the need\nfor food creates the drive of hunger. Awareness of death is balanced\nby the urge to avoid it. There you have fear and combativeness. And is\nit so hard to tack on the drives of curiosity, invention, and\nambition, especially when you know that these beings made a spaceship?\nCast an intelligence in any outward form, anywhere, it ought to come\nout much the same. Still, there are bound to be wide differences of\ndetail--with wide variations of viewpoint. They could be horrible to\nus. And most likely it's mutual.\"\n\nI felt that Miller was right. The duplication of a human race on other\nworlds by another chain of evolution was highly improbable. And to\nsuppose that we might get along with other entities on a human basis\nseemed pitifully naive.\n\nWith all our scientific thoroughness, when it came to examining,\nphotographing and recording everything in the wreck, there was no\nbetter evidence of the clumsy way we were investigating unknown things\nthan the fact that at first we neglected our supreme find almost\nentirely.\n\nIt was a round lump of dried red mud, the size of a soft baseball.\nWhen Craig finally did get around to X-raying it, indications of a\nless dense interior and feathery markings suggesting a soft bone\nstructure showed up on the plate. Not entirely sure that it was the\nright thing to do, he opened the shell carefully.\n\nThink of an artichoke ... but not a vegetable. Dusky pink, with thin,\ntranslucent mouth-flaps moving feebly. The blood in the tiny arteries\nwas very red--rich in hemoglobin, for a rare atmosphere.\n\nAs a youngster, I had once opened a chicken egg, when it was ten days\nshort of hatching. The memory came back now.\n\n\"It looks like a growing embryo of some kind,\" Klein stated.\n\n\"Close the lump again, Craig,\" Miller ordered softly.\n\nThe biologist obeyed.\n\n\"A highly intelligent race of beings wouldn't encase their developing\nyoung in mud, would they?\" Klein almost whispered.\n\n\"You're judging by a human esthetic standard,\" Craig offered.\n\"Actually, mud can be as sterile as the cleanest surgical gauze.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe discussion was developing unspoken and shadowy ramifications. The\nthing in the dusty red lump--whether the young of a dominant species,\nor merely a lower animal--had been born, hatched, started in life\nprobably during the weeks or months of a vast space journey. Nobody\nwould know anything about its true nature until, and if, it manifested\nitself. And we had no idea of what that manifestation might be. The\ncreature might emerge an infant or an adult. Friendly or malevolent.\nOr even deadly.\n\nBlaine shrugged. Something scared and half-savage showed in his face.\n\"What'll we do with the thing?\" he asked. \"Keep it safe and see what\nhappens. Yet it might be best to get rid of it fast--with chloroform,\ncyanide or the back of a shovel.\"\n\nMiller's smile was very gentle. \"Could be you're right, Blaine.\"\n\nI'd never known Miller to pull rank on any of the bunch. Only\ndeliberate thought would remind us that he was a colonel. But he\nwasn't really a military man; he was a scientist whom the Army had\ncalled in to keep a finger on a possibility that they had long known\nmight be realized. Yes--space travel. And Miller was the right guy for\nthe job. He had the dream even in the wrinkles around his deep-set\ngray eyes.\n\nBlaine wasn't the right guy. He was a fine technician, good at\nmachinery, radar--anything of the sort. And a nice fellow. Maybe he'd\njust blown off steam--uncertainty, tension. I knew that no paper\nrelating to him would be marked, \"Psychologically unsuited for task in\nhand.\" But I knew just as surely that he would be quietly transferred.\nIn a big thing like this, Miller would surround himself only with men\nwho saw things his way.\n\nThat night we moved everything to our labs on the outskirts of St.\nLouis. Every particle of that extraterrestrial wreck had been packed\nand crated with utmost care. Klein and Craig went to work to build a\nspecial refuge for that mud lump and what was in it. They were top\nmen. But I had got tied up with Miller more or less by chance, and I\nfigured I'd be replaced by an expert. I can say that I was a college\nman, but that's nothing.\n\nI guess you can't give up participation in high romance without some\nregret. Yet I wasn't too sorry. I liked things the way they'd always\nbeen. My beer. My Saturday night dates with Alice. On the job, the\natmosphere was getting a bit too rich and futuristic.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLater that evening, Miller drew me aside. \"You've handled carrier\npigeons and you've trained dogs, Nolan,\" he said. \"You were good at\nboth.\"\n\n\"Here I go, back to the farm-yard.\"\n\n\"In a way. But you expand your operations, Nolan. You specialize as\nnurse for a piece of off-the-Earth animal life.\"\n\n\"Look, Miller,\" I pointed out. \"Ten thousand professors are a million\ntimes better qualified, and rarin' to go.\"\n\n\"They're liable to _think_ they're well qualified, when no man could\nbe--yet. That's bad, Nolan. The one who does it has to be humble\nenough to be wary--ready for whatever _might_ happen. I think a knack\nwith animals might help. That's the best I can do, Nolan.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Miller.\" I felt proud--and a little like a damn fool.\n\n\"I haven't finished talking yet,\" Miller said. \"We know that real\ncontact between our kind and the inhabitants of another world can't be\nfar off. Either they'll send another ship or we'll build one on Earth.\nI like the idea, Nolan, but it also scares the hell out of me. Men\nhave had plenty of trouble with other ethnic groups of their own\nspecies, through prejudice, misunderstanding, honest suspicion. How\nwill it be at the first critical meeting of two kinds of things that\nwill look like hallucinations to each other? I suspect an awful and\ninevitable feeling of separateness that nothing can bridge--except\nmaybe an impulse to do murder.\n\n\"It could be a real menace. But it doesn't have to be. So we've got to\nfind out what we're up against, if we can. We've got to prepare and\nscheme. Otherwise, even if intentions on that other world are okay,\nthere's liable to be an incident at that first meeting that can spoil\na contact across space for all time, and make interplanetary travel\nnot the success it ought to be, but a constant danger. So do you see\nour main objective, Nolan?\"\n\nI told Miller that I understood.\n\nThat same night, Klein and Craig put the lump of mud in a small glass\ncase from which two-thirds of the air had been exhausted. The\nremainder was kept dehydrated and chilled. It was guess work, backed\nup by evidence: The rusty red of that mud; the high hemoglobin content\nof the alien blood we had seen; the dead-air cells--resistant to\ncold--in the shreds of rough skin that we had examined. And then there\nwas the fair proximity of Mars and Earth in their orbits at the time.\n\nMy job didn't really begin till the following evening, when Craig and\nKlein had completed a much larger glass cage, to which my\noutlandish--or, rather, outworldish--ward was transferred. Miller\nprovided me with a wire-braced, airtight costume and oxygen helmet,\nthe kind fliers use at extreme altitudes. Okay, call it a spacesuit.\nHe also gave me a small tear-gas pistol, an automatic, and a knife.\n\nAll there was to pit such armament against was a seemingly helpless\nlump of protoplasm, two inches in diameter. Still, here was an\nillustration of how cautiously you are prompted to treat so unknown a\nquantity. You are unable to gauge its powers, or lack of them, for you\nhave nothing on which to base a judgment.\n\nI became like a monk--my pressure armor was my robe; the chilly\nsemi-vacuum inside that glass cage, my cell. Nights out with Alice\nwere going to be far between.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the third evening, that lump of mud, resting in dried-out soil\nsimilar to itself, split along the line where Craig had originally cut\nit. Out onto the cage floor crept what the records designated as\n_E.T.L._--Extra-Terrestrial-Life. It was finished with the mud shell\nthat had enabled it to survive a crash and fire.\n\nCraig, Klein, Miller and a lot of news reporters stared into the glass\ncage from outside. There was nothing for me to do just then except\nwatch that tiny monster, and try to read, in its every clumsy,\ndragging movement, some fragmentary unveiling of many riddles.\n\nAlthough it might have shrunk a bit since I had last seen it, it\nlooked more complete. The dusky pink of its wrinkled integument was\ndarker. It had dozens of short tendrils, hardly thicker than\nhorsehair, with which it pulled itself along. It had lost some\nleaflike pieces of skin. Laterally, two eyes gleamed, clear and\nslit-pupiled. Its jaws, hinged on a horizontal plane, opened and\nclosed between fleshy flaps. Through the thin plastic of my oxygen\nhelmet, I heard a querulous \"chip-chip-chip,\" which reminded me of the\nsqueaking of an infant bat.\n\nThe E.T.L. crept in a small looping course on the cage floor, back to\none half of the mud shell that had encased it. It tried to mount this,\nperhaps to gain a vantage point for better observation. But it fell\nand turned over. Its ventral surface was ceiling-ward; its tendrils\nwrithed furiously as it tried to right itself. I thought of a\nhorseshoe crab, stranded on its back and kicking helplessly. But this\nthing's form and movement were even more alien.\n\nAfter a moment, I followed an impulse which was part duty to my job\nand part pity. I tipped the little horror back on its bottom, glad\nthat there was a glove between me and it. Then I did the same thing I\nwould do with a pet puppy or kitten. I set a dish of food--chemically\nprepared to duplicate the contents of the tubes we had found in the\nwreck--right down in front of the E.T.L.\n\nIt fumbled at the stuff and, possibly because of a gravity\ntwo-and-a-half times as great as it was made for, it almost got itself\nstuck in the mess. But it freed itself. Its mouth-flaps began to make\nlapping movements as it sucked the nourishment.\n\nI felt prematurely relieved. This was no potentially dominant wizard\nin a strange body, I told myself. This was pure animal.\n\nOver my helmet radiophone--there was a mike outside the cage, so they\ncould communicate with me when I was inside--I heard Miller say to the\nreporters:\n\n\"The feeding instinct. They've got it, too. Now we know for sure....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI think that the E.T.L. had colic from that first meal, though, like\nany half-smart puppy trainer, I tried not to let it eat too much. It\nwrithed for a while, as if in pain. And I was on pins. How was I\nsupposed to know just what was best to feed the thing, so it would\nsurvive? Everything was guesswork, varying formulas cautiously,\ngroping. And it wasn't only the food. There was the searching for the\ntemperature, the air-pressure and the degree of dryness at which the\nE.T.L. seemed most comfortable. And there was also the fiddling around\nwith light-composition and intensities, variable in the sun lamps, to\nfind what seemed best.\n\nWe seemed to have figured things out right--or else the monster was\njust rugged. It shed several skins, thrived and grew active. Its size\nincreased steadily. And other things began to grow in that cage. Odd,\nhard-shelled, bluish-green weeds; lichenous patches, dry as dust;\ninvisible, un-Earthly bacteria--all were harmless, possibly even\nbeneficial, to my charge.\n\nHow did all this stuff come into being? Miller and Craig had examined\nthe dried clay of the E.T.L.'s discarded casing with microscopes. They\nscraped dust from every fragment of the wreck that hadn't been blasted\ntoo much with fire, and made cultures. They were looking for spores\nand seeds and microbes. And it wasn't long before they had classified\nquite a list of other-world biological forms. The most common of these\nthey transplanted into the cage.\n\nOften I even slept inside the cage, clad in my armor. That's devotion\nto a purpose for you. In a way, it was like living on a little piece\nof Mars. Often enough I was bored stiff.\n\nBut plenty did happen. From the start Etl--we began calling the thing\nthat--showed an almost electrically intense curiosity for everything.\nSome of the habits of its kind were written in its instincts. It\nbasked in strong light, but it liked dark corners, too. At night--when\nwe turned the sun lamps off, that is--it would bury itself in the\ndusty soil. Protection against nocturnal cold might have been the\nreason for that.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen he was a month and two days out of his clay shell, Etl tried to\nrear up vertically on his tendrils. He kept toppling over. Maybe he\nwas trying to \"walk.\" But there were no bones in those tendrils and,\nof course, the strong Earth gravity defeated him.\n\nLots of times I tried to see what he could do. A real scientist would\ncall this \"making tests.\" I just called it fooling around. I made him\nclimb a stool for his food. He seemed to make a careful survey first,\neying each rung; then he drew himself up in one motion.\n\nDuring one of my rare nights in town--to get a refresher from\noutlandish stuff in Alice's company--I bought some toys. When I came\nback to relieve Craig, who had taken care of Etl during my absence, I\nsaid: \"Etl, here's a rubber ball. Let's play.\"\n\nHe caught it on the second try, in those swift, dextrous tendrils.\nThere was a savagery in the way he did it. I thought of a dog snapping\na bumblebee out of the air. Yet my idea that Etl was just an animal\nhad almost vanished by then.\n\nI got into the habit of talking to him the way you do to a pup. Sort\nof crooning. \"Good fella, Etl. Smart. You learn fast, don't you?\"\n\nStuff like that. And I'd coax him to climb up the front of my\nspacesuit. There were fine, barb-like prongs along the length of his\nmany tentacles; I could feel them pulling in the tough, rubberized\nfabric, like the claws of a climbing kitten. And he would make a kind\nof contented chirping that might have had affection in it.\n\nBut then there was the time when he bit me. I don't know the reason,\nunless it was that I had held onto his ball too long. He got my\nfinger, through the glove, with his snaggy, chalk-hued mandibles,\nwhile he made a thin hissing noise.\n\nPretty soon my hand swelled up to twice its size, and I felt sick.\nKlein had to relieve me in the cage for a while. The bite turned out\nto be mildly venomous. Before that, I'd had a rash on my arms. An\nallergy, probably; maybe some substance from those Martian plants had\ngotten inside my spacesuit and rubbed onto my skin. Who knows? Perhaps\nEarthly flesh can sense alien life, and reddens to fight it off. And\nthere you have one of the potential disadvantages of contact with\nunknown worlds.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat poisoned bite was one thing. But Etl's show of rage was\nanother--a sign of the mixed nature of all his kind, emerging a bit\nfrom the shadows of enigma. Here revealed was the emotion on which\nthings like murder are based. These creatures had it, just as we did.\nMaybe it's necessary for any kind of thing that can progress upward\nfrom nothing. Still, people did not find it reassuring when they heard\nabout it on the newscast.\n\nAfter that, popular opinion insisted that the cage be constantly\nsurrounded by four manned machine-guns pointing inward. And tanks of\ncyanogen were so arranged that the poison gas could be sent gushing\ninto the cage at any time.\n\nPart of my mind felt these precautions were completely exaggerated.\nThere is a certain, ever-present segment of any public, whose jittery\nimagination is a constant fuse-cap for panic. Such cowardice angered\nme.\n\nBut the rest of me went along with Miller when he said: \"We're in the\ndark, Nolan. For all we know, we might be up against very swift\nmaturity and inherited memory. And we've got to go on testing Etl ...\nwith toys, psychological apparatus and tools and devices made by his\nown people. Suppose he 'remembers' skills from his ancestors, and can\nbuild dangerous new devices, or make old ones work again? If his kind\nare bent on being enemies, we'd better find it out as soon as\npossible, too, hadn't we? No, I don't truly expect any serious\ndevelopments, Nolan. Still--just for insurance--eh?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA year passed without great mishap--unless I should mention that Alice\nand I got married. But it didn't spoil anything, and it raised my\nmorale. We got a bungalow right on the lab grounds.\n\nA lot had been accomplished, otherwise. Once I let Etl play with my\ngun, minus cartridges. He was avidly interested; but he paid no\nattention to the Hopalong cap pistol that I left in its place when I\ntook the gun back. He figured out how to grip simple Martian tools,\nthreading his tactile members through the holes in their handles; but\ncomplicated devices of the same origin seemed more of a puzzle to him\nthan to the rest of us. So our inherited-memory idea faded out.\n\nEtl liked to work with those slender tendrils of his. The dexterity\nand speed with which he soon learned to build many things with a\nconstruction set seemed to prove a race background of perhaps ages of\nsuch activities. I made a tower or a bridge, while he watched. Then he\nwas ready to try it on his own, using screwdrivers that Klein had made\nwith special grips.\n\nOf course we tried dozens of intelligence tests on Etl, mostly of the\npuzzle variety, like fitting odd-shaped pieces of plastic together to\nform a sphere or a cube. He was hard to rate on any common human I.Q.\nscale. Even for an Earthian, an I.Q. rating is pretty much of a\nmakeshift proposition. There are too many scattered factors that can't\nbe touched.\n\nWith Etl, it was even tougher. But at the end of that first year\nMiller had him pegged at about 120, judging him on the same basis as a\nfive-year-old child. This score scared people a lot, because it seemed\nto hint at a race of super-beings.\n\nBut Miller wasn't jumping to conclusions. He pointed out to the\nreporters that Etl's kind seemed to grow up very rapidly; 120 was\nonly twenty points above the norm--not uncommon among Earth\nyoungsters, especially those from more gifted families. Etl seemed to\nhave sprung from corresponding parentage, he said, for it seemed clear\nthat they had been of the kind that does big things. They'd made a\npioneering voyage across space, hadn't they?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEtl could make chirps and squeaks and weird animal cries. Human\nspeech, however, was beyond his vocal powers, though I knew that he\ncould understand simple orders. He had a large tympanic membrane or\n\"ear\" on his ventral surface. Of course we wondered how his kind\ncommunicated with one another. The way he groped at my fingers with\ncertain of his tentacles gave us a clue. There were tiny, nerve-like\nthreads at their extremities. Seeing them prompted Miller to do\nsomething as brave as it was foolhardy.\n\nHe called in a surgeon and had a nerve in his arm bared. It must have\nhurt like the devil, but he let Etl clutch it with those thread-like\nmembers.\n\nI was cockeyed enough to follow Miller's example and found out how\nmuch it really hurt. The idea was to establish a nerve channel, brain\nto brain, along which thoughts might pass. But nothing came through\nexcept a vague and restless questioning, mixed with the pain of our\nexperiment.\n\n\"It doesn't work with us, Nolan,\" Miller said regretfully. \"Our\nnervous systems aren't hooked up right for this sort of stunt, or\nEtl's nerve cells are too different from ours.\"\n\nSo we had to fall back on simpler methods of communication with Etl.\nWe tried teaching him sign language, but it didn't work too well,\nbecause tentacles aren't hands. Klein's inventive ability, plus some\npointers from me about how Etl used his tendrils, finally solved the\nproblem.\n\nKlein made a cylindrical apparatus with a tonal buzzer, operated by\nelectricity, at one end. It had dozens of stops and controls, their\ngrips in the shape of tiny metal rings, along the sides of the\ncylinder.\n\nFirst I had to learn a little about how to work that instrument with\nmy big fingers. The trick was to mold the sounds of the buzzer, as\nhuman lips and tongue mold and shape tones of the vocal cords, so that\nthey became syllables and words.\n\n\"Hell-oh-g-g-Et-t-l-l.... Chee-s-s-ee-whad-d I-ee got-t?\"\n\nIt was tougher for me than learning to play a saxophone is for a boy\nof ten. And the noises were almost as bad.\n\nI turned the apparatus over to Etl as soon as I could. Let him figure\nout how to use it. I'd just give him the words, the ideas. Of course\nhe had to get educated, learn his cat, dog and rat, and his\narithmetic, the same as a human kid, even if he was from another\nworld. In a way, it was the law. You can't let a youngster, capable of\nlearning, stay home from school.\n\nAnd I was Etl's tutor. I thought what a crazy situation we had here;\nan entity from one planet being brought up on another, without any\nreal knowledge of his own folks, and unable to be very close to those\nentities by whom he was being reared. It was strange and sad and a\nlittle comic.\n\nFor a while I thought I had a stammering parrot on my hands:\n\"Hel-l-l-l-o ... Hell-oh-g-o ... N-n-ol-l-an-n-n ... Hell-lo-oh.\"\n\nEtl never lost that habit of repetition. But he made progress in his\nstudies.\n\n\"One, two, t'ree, fo', fibe, siss ... One time one ee one, toot time\none ee two....\"\n\nPicture it the way it was--I, clad in a spacesuit, crouching beside\nEtl in the cold, thin air inside that cage, tracing numbers and words\nin the dusty soil on the floor, while he read aloud with his voice\ntube or copied my words and figures with a sharp stick. Outside the\ntransparent cage, the television cameras would be watching. And I\nwould think that maybe in a way Etl was like Tarzan, being raised by\napes.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFour more years went by. I had offspring of my own. Patty and Ron.\nGood-looking, lovable brats. But Etl was my job--and maybe a little\nmore than that.\n\nAt the end of two years, he stopped growing. He weighed fifty-two\npounds and he was the ugliest-looking, elongated, gray-pink, leathery\novoid that you could imagine. But with his voice tube clutched in his\ntendrils, he could talk like a man.\n\nHe could take the finest watch, apart, repair and clean it in\njig-time--and this was just one skill among scores. Toward the end of\nthe four years, a Professor Jonas was coming in regularly and getting\ninto a spacesuit to give him lessons in physics, chemistry, college\nmath, astronomy and biology. Etl was having his troubles with\ncalculus.\n\nAnd Etl could at least ape the outward aspects of the thoughts and\nfeelings of men. There were things he said to me that were\ncharacteristic, though they came out of apparent sullenness that, for\nall I knew, had seeds of murder in it: \"You're my pal, Nolan. Sort of\nmy uncle. I won't say my father; you wouldn't like that.\"\n\nNice, embarrassing sentiment, on the surface. Maybe it was just cool\nmimicry--a keen mind adding up human ways from observation of me and\nmy kids, and making up something that sounded the same, without being\nthe same at all. Yet somehow I hoped that Etl was sincere.\n\nAlmost from the building of the cage, of course, we'd kept photographs\nand drawings of Mars inside for Etl to see.\n\nHundreds of times I had said to him things like: \"It's a ninety-nine\nand ninety-nine hundredths per cent probability that your race lives\non that world, Etl. Before the ship that brought you crashed on Earth,\nwe weren't at all sure that it was inhabited, and it's still an awful\nmystery. I guess maybe you'll want to go there. Maybe you'll help us\nmake contact and establish amicable relations with the inhabitants--if\nthere's any way we can do that.\"\n\nDuring those five years, no more ships came to Earth from space, as\nfar as we knew. I guessed that the Martians understood how supremely\nhard it would be to make friendly contact between the peoples of two\nworlds that had always been separate. There was difference of form,\nand certainly difference of esthetic concepts. Of custom, nothing\ncould be the same. We didn't have even an inkling of what the Martian\ncivilization would be like.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOne thing happened during the third year of Etl's existence. And his\npresence on Earth was responsible. Enough serious interest in space\ntravel was built up to overcome the human inertia that had\ncounteracted the long-standing knowledge that such things were\npossible. A hydrogen-fusion reaction motor was built into a rocket,\nwhich was then hurled to the moon.\n\nMiller went along, ostensibly to help establish the first Army\nexperimental station there, but mostly to acquire the practical\nexperience for a far longer leap.\n\nIn a way, I wished I could have gone, too; but, after all, the shadows\nin Etl's background were far more intriguing than the dead and airless\ncraters and plains of the lunar surface.\n\nBefore Miller and the other moon-voyagers even returned, Detroit was\nbusy forging, casting and machining the parts for a better, larger and\nmuch longer-range rocket, to be assembled in White Sands, New Mexico.\n\nWhen Miller got back, he was too eager and busy to say much about the\nmoon. For the next two and a half years, he was mostly out in White\nSands.\n\nBut during the first of our now infrequent meetings, he said to Craig\nand Klein and me: \"When I go out to Mars, I'd like to keep my old\nbunch as crew. I need men I'm used to working with, those who\nunderstand the problems we're up against. I have a plan that makes\nsense. The trouble is, to join this expedition, a man has to be part\ndamn-fool.\"\n\nKlein chuckled. \"I'll sell you some of mine.\"\n\nI just nodded my way in. I'd never thought of backing out.\n\nCraig grabbed Miller's hand and shook it.\n\nMiller gave Etl a chance to say no. \"You can stay on Earth if you want\nto, Etl.\"\n\nBut the creature said: \"I have lived all my life with the idea of\ngoing, Miller. Thank you.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMiller briefed us about his plan. Then he, Klein, Craig and I all took\na lot of psych tests--trick questioning and so forth to reveal defects\nof conviction and control. But we were all pretty well indoctrinated\nand steady. Etl had taken so many tests already that, if there were\nany flaws still hidden in him, they would probably never be found.\n\nMars and Earth were approaching closer to each other again in their\norbital positions. A month before takeoff time, Craig, Klein and I\ntook Etl, in a small air-conditioned cage, to White Sands. The ship\ntowered there, silvery, already completed. We knew its structure and\nthe function of its machinery intimately from study of its blueprints.\nBut our acquaintance with it had to be actual, too. So we went over it\nagain and again, under Miller's tutelage.\n\nMiller wrote a last message, to be handed to the newscast boys after\nour departure:\n\n\"_If by Martian action, we fail to return, don't blame the Martians\ntoo quickly, because there is a difference and a doubt. Contact\nbetween worlds is worth more than the poison of a grudge...._\"\n\nI said good-by to Alice and the kids, who had come out to see me off.\nI felt pretty punk. Maybe I was a stinker, going off like that. But,\non the other hand, that wasn't entirely the right way to look at\nthings, because Patty's and Ron's faces fairly glowed with pride for\ntheir pa. The tough part, then, was for Alice, who knew what it was\nall about. Yet she looked proud, too. And she didn't go damp.\n\n\"If it weren't for the kids, I'd be trying to go along, Louie,\" she\ntold me. \"Take care of yourself.\"\n\nShe knew that a guy has to do what's in his heart. I think that the\nbasic and initial motive of exploration is that richest of human\ncommodities--high romance. The metallic ores and other commercial\nstuff that get involved later are only cheap by-products. To make the\ndream of space travel a reality was one of our purposes. But to try to\nforestall the danger behind it was at least as important.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe blasted off in a rush of fire that must have knocked down some\nself-operating television cameras. We endured the strangling thrust of\nacceleration, and then the weightlessness of just coasting on our\nbuilt-up velocity. We saw the stars and the black sky of space. We saw\nthe Earth dwindle away behind us.\n\nBut the journey itself, though it lasted ninety days, was no real\nadventure--comparatively speaking. There was nothing unpredictable in\nit. Space conditions were known. We even knew about the tension of\nnostalgia. But we understood, too, the mental attitudes that could\nlessen the strain. Crossing space to another world under the\ntremendous power of atomic fusion, and under the precise guidance of\nmathematics and piloting devices, reduces the process almost to a\nformula. If things go right, you get where you're going; if not, there\nisn't much you can do. Anyway, we had the feeling that the technical\nside of interplanetary travel was the simplest part.\n\nThere is a marking near the Martian equator shaped like the funnel of\na gigantic tornado. It is the red planet's most conspicuous feature\nand it includes probably the least arid territory of a cold, arid\nworld. Syrtis Major, it is called. Astronomers had always supposed it\nto be an ancient sea-bottom. That was where our piloting devices were\nset to take us.\n\nOver it, our retarding fore-jets blazed for the last time. Our\nretractable wings slid from their sockets and took hold of the thin\natmosphere with a thump and a soft rustle. On great rubber-tired\nwheels, our ship--horizontal now, like a plane--landed in a broad\nvalley that must have been cleared of boulders by Martian engineers\ncountless ages before.\n\nOur craft stopped rumbling. We peered from the windows of our cabin,\nsaw the deep blue of the sky and the smaller but brilliant Sun. We saw\nlittle dusty whirlwinds, carven monoliths that were weathering away,\nstrange blue-green vegetation, some of which we could recognize. To\nthe east, a metal tower glinted. And a mile beyond it there was a\ntremendous flat structure. An expanse of glassy roof shone. What might\nhave been a highway curved like a white ribbon into the distance.\n\nThe scene was quiet, beautiful and sad. You could feel that here maybe\na hundred civilizations had risen, and had sunk back into the dust.\nMars was no older than the Earth; but it was smaller, had cooled\nfaster and must have borne life sooner. Perhaps some of those earlier\ncultures had achieved space travel. But, if so, it had been forgotten\nuntil recent years. Very soon now its result would be tested. The\nmeeting of alien entity with alien entity was at hand.\n\nI looked at Etl, still in his air-conditioned cage. His stalked eyes\nhad a glow and they swayed nervously. Here was the home-planet that he\nhad never seen. Was he eager or frightened, or both?\n\nHis education and experience were Earthly. He knew no more of Mars\nthan we did. Yet, now that he was here and probably at home, did\ndifference of physical structure and emotion make him feel that the\nrest of us were enemies, forever too different for friendly contact?\nMy hide began to pucker.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHigh in the sky, some kind of aircraft glistened. On the distant\nturnpike there were the shining specks of vehicles that vanished from\nsight behind a ridge shaggy with vegetation.\n\nMiller had a tight, nervous smile. \"Remember, men,\" he said.\n\"Passivity. Three men can't afford to get into a fight with a whole\nplanet.\"\n\nWe put on spacesuits, which we'd need if someone damaged our rocket.\nIt had been known for years that Martian air was too thin and far too\npoor in oxygen for human lungs. Even Etl, in his cage, had an oxygen\nmask that Klein had made for him. We had provided him with this\nbecause the Martian atmosphere, drifting away through the ages, might\nbe even leaner than the mixture we'd given Etl on Earth. That had been\nbased on spectroscopic analyses at 40 to 60 million miles' distance,\nwhich isn't close enough for any certainty.\n\nNow all we could do was wait and see what would happen. I know that\nsome jerks, trying to make contact with the inhabitants of an unknown\nworld, would just barge in and take over. Maybe they'd wave a few\ntimes and grin. If instead of being met like brothers, they were shot\nat, they'd be inclined to start shooting. If they got out alive, their\nhatred would be everlasting. We had more sense.\n\nYet _passivity_ was a word that I didn't entirely like. It sounded\nspineless. The art of balancing naive trust exactly against hard\ncynicism, to try to produce something that makes a little sense, isn't\nalways easy. Though we knew something of Martians, we didn't know\nnearly enough. Our plan might be wrong; we might turn out to be dead\nidiots in a short time. Still, it was the best thing that we could\nthink of.\n\nThe afternoon wore on. With the dropping temperature, a cold pearly\nhaze began to form around the horizon. The landscape around us was too\nquiet. And there was plenty of vegetation at hand to provide cover.\nMaybe it had been a mistake to land here. But we couldn't see that an\narid place would be any good either. We had needed to come to a region\nthat was probably inhabited.\n\nWe saw a Martian only once--scampering across an open glade, holding\nhimself high on his stiffened tentacles. Here, where the gravity was\nonly thirty-eight percent of the terrestrial, that was possible. It\nlessened the eeriness a lot to know beforehand what a Martian looked\nlike. He looked like Etl.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLater, something pinged savagely against the flank of our rocket. So\nthere were trigger-happy individuals here, too. But I remembered how,\non Earth, Etl's cage had been surrounded by machine-guns and cyanogen\ntanks, rigged to kill him quickly if it became necessary. That hadn't\nbeen malice, only sensible precaution against the unpredictable. And\nwasn't our being surrounded by weapons here only the same thing, from\nanother viewpoint? Yet it didn't feel pleasant, sensible or not.\n\nThere were no more shots for half an hour. But our tension mounted\nwith the waiting.\n\nFinally Klein said through his helmet phone: \"Maybe Etl ought to go\nout and scout around now.\"\n\nEtl was naturally the only one of us who had much chance for success.\n\n\"Go only if you really want to, Etl,\" Miller said. \"It could be\ndangerous even for you.\"\n\nBut Etl had already put on his oxygen mask. Air hissed into his cage\nfrom the greater pressure outside as he turned a valve. Then he\nunlatched the cage-door. He wouldn't be harmed by the brief exposure\nto atmosphere of Earth-density while he moved to our rocket's airlock.\nNow he was getting around high on his tendrils. Like a true Martian.\n\nHe left his specially built pistol behind, according to plan. We had\nweapons, but we didn't mean to use them unless everything went dead\nwrong.\n\nEtl's tendrils touched the dusty surface of Mars. A minute later, he\ndisappeared behind some scrub growths. Then, for ten minutes, the\npendant silence was heavy. It was broken by the sound of a shot,\ncoming back to us thinly through the rarefied air.\n\n\"Maybe they got him,\" Craig said anxiously.\n\nNobody answered. I thought of an old story I'd read about a boy being\nbrought up by wolves. His ways were so like an animal's that hunters\nhad shot him. He had come back to civilization dead. Perhaps there was\nno other way.\n\nBy sundown, Etl had not returned. So three things seemed possible: He\nhad been murdered. He had been captured. Or else he had deserted to\nhis own kind. I began to wonder. What if we were complete fools? What\nif there were more than differences of body and background, plus the\ndread of newness, between Earthmen and Martians, preventing their\nfriendship?\n\nWhat if Martians were basically malevolent?\n\nBut speculation was useless now. We were committed to a line of\naction. We had to follow it through.\n\nWe ate a meager supper. The brief dusk changed to a night blazing with\nfrigid stars. But the darkness on the ground remained until the jagged\nlump of light that was Phobos, the nearer moon, arose out of the west.\nThen we saw two shapes rushing toward our ship to find cover closer to\nit. As they hid themselves behind a clump of cactiform shrubs, I had\nonly the memory of how I had seen them for a moment, their odd masks\nand accoutrements glinting, their supporting tendrils looking like\ntattered rags come alive in the dim moonlight.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe'd turned the light out in our cabin, so we couldn't be seen through\nthe windows. But now we heard soft, scraping sounds against the outer\nskin of our rocket. Probably they meant that the Martians were trying\nto get in. I began to sweat all over, because I knew what Miller meant\nto do. Here was a situation that we had visualized beforehand.\n\n\"We could shut them out till dawn, Miller,\" I whispered hoarsely.\n\"We'd all feel better if the meeting took place in day-light. And\nthere'd be less chance of things going wrong.\"\n\nBut Miller said, \"We can't tell what they'd be doing in the dark\nmeanwhile, Nolan. Maybe fixing to blow us up. So we'd better get this\nthing over with now.\"\n\nI knew he was right. Active resistance to the Martians could never\nsave us, if they intended to destroy us. We might have taken the\nrocket off the ground like a plane, seeking safety in the upper air\nfor a while, if we could get it launched that way from the rough\nterrain. But using our jets might kill some of the Martians just\noutside. They could interpret it as a hostile act.\n\nWe didn't matter much, except to ourselves. And our primary objective\nwas to make friendly contact with the beings of this planet, without\nfriction, if it could be done. If we failed, space travel might become\na genuine menace to Earth.\n\nAt Miller's order, Craig turned on our cabin lights. Miller pressed\nthe controls of our ship's airlock. While its outer valve remained\nwide, the inner valve unsealed itself and swung slowly toward us. Our\nair whooshed out.\n\nThe opening of that inner valve meant we were letting horror in. We\nkept out of line of possible fire through the open door.\n\nOur idea was to control our instinctive reactions to strangeness, to\nremain passive, giving the Martians a chance to get over their own\nprobable terror of us by finding out that we meant no harm. Otherwise\nwe might be murdering each other.\n\nThe long wait was agony. In spite of the dehumidifying unit of my\nspacesuit, I could feel the sweat from my body collecting in puddles\nin the bottoms of my boots. A dozen times there were soft rustles and\nscrapes at the airlock; then sounds of hurried retreat.\n\nBut at last a mass of gray-pink tendrils intruded over the threshold.\nAnd we saw the stalked eyes, faintly luminous in the shadowy interior\nof the lock. Grotesquely up-ended on its tentacles, the monster seemed\nto flow into the cabin. Over its mouth-palps was the cup of what must\nhave been its oxygen mask.\n\nWhat was clearly the muzzle of some kind of pistol, smoothly machined,\nwas held ready by a mass of tendrils that suggested Gorgon hair.\nBehind the first monster was a second, similarly armed. Behind him was\na third. After that I lost count, as the horde, impelled by fear to\ngrab control in one savage rush, spilled into the cabin with a\ndry-leaf rustle.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll my instincts urged me to yank my automatic out of my belt and let\ngo at that flood of horror. Yes, that was in me, although I'd been in\nintimate association with Etl for four years. Psychologists say that\nno will power could keep a man's reflexes from withdrawing his hand\nfrom a hot stove for very long. And going for my gun seemed almost a\nreflex action.\n\nThere was plenty of sound logic to back up the urge to shoot. In the\npresence of the unfathomable, how could you replace the tried defenses\nof instinct with intellectual ideas of good will?\n\n[Illustration]\n\nOn the other hand, to shoot now would be suicide and ruin our hopes,\nbesides. So maybe there'd have to be human sacrifices to faith between\nthe planets. If we succeeded in following the plan, our faith would\nbe proven either right or wrong. If we didn't act passively, the\nfailure would be partly our fault. In any case, if we didn't get back\nto Earth, hatred and fear of the Martians would inevitably arise\nthere, whether it had been the Martians' fault or ours. The message\nthat Miller had left for newscast might only give people the\nself-righteous attitude that Earthly intentions had been good. If\nanother expedition ever came to Mars, it might shoot any inhabitants\non sight, and maybe get wiped out itself.\n\nStill, how could we know that the Martians weren't preparing the kind\nof invasion of Earth that has been imagined so often? It was a corny\nnotion, but the basis for it remained sound. Mars was a dying world.\nCouldn't the Martians still want a new planet to move to?\n\nAll these old thoughts popped back into my head during that very bad\nmoment. And if I was almost going for my pistol, how much worse was it\nfor Craig, Klein and Miller, who hadn't been as friendly with Etl as I\nhad been? Maybe we should have put our weapons out of our own reach,\nin preparation for this incident. Then there would have been no danger\nof our using them.\n\nBut any freedom of action was swiftly wrested from us. The Martians\nrolled over us in a wave. Thousands of dark tendrils with fine,\nsawlike spines latched onto our bodies. I was glad that I wore a\nspacesuit, as much from the revulsion I felt at a direct contact as\nfor the small protection it gave against injury.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI am sure that there was panic behind that wild Martian rush. To get\nus pinned down and helpless quickly, they drove themselves in spite of\ntheir own fear of the horrid human forms. For did I feel a tremor in\nthose tendrils, a tendency to recoil from me? I was trembling and\nsweating. Still, my impressions were vivid. Those monsters held us\ndown as if they were Malay beaters holding down trapped pythons. Maybe\nthey had known beforehand what men looked like--from previous, secret\nexpeditions to Earth. Just as we had known about Martians from Etl.\nBut it wouldn't have made any difference.\n\nOr perhaps they weren't even aware that we were from the neighboring\nplanet. But it would be obvious that we were from another world;\nnothing from their own planet could be so strange.\n\nOur own reactions to the situation differed a little. Craig gasped\ncurses through his helmet phones. Miller said, \"Easy, men! Easy!\" It\nwas as if he were trying to build up his own morale, too. I couldn't\nutter a sound.\n\nIt wasn't hard for our captors to recognize our weapons. We were\ndisarmed. They carried us out into the night and around a hill. We\nwere piled onto a flat metallic surface. A vehicle under us began to\nthrob and move; you could have called it a truck. The nature of its\nmechanism was hinted at only by a small, frosty wisp of steam or vapor\nup front. Perhaps it came from a leak. The Martians continued to hold\nus down as savagely as ever. Now and then a pair of them would join\nthe nerve-ends of tendrils, perhaps to converse. Others would chirp or\nhoot for no reason that I could understand.\n\nThe highway rolled away behind us, under the light of Phobos.\nBuildings passed, vague as buildings along a road usually are at\nnight. It was the same with the clumps of vegetation. Lights, which\nmight have been electrical, flashed into my eyes and passed by. In a\ndeep valley through which we moved in part of our short trip, a dense,\nstratified fog arose between the lights and me. I noticed with an odd\ndetachment that the fog was composed of minute ice crystals, which\nglinted in the glow of the strange lamps. I tried to remember our\ncourse. I knew that it was generally east. Off in the night there were\nclangings and hisses that might have been factory noises.\n\nOnce Miller asked, \"Is everybody okay?\"\n\nKlein's and Craig's responses were gruff and unsteady in the phones.\n\n\"Sure....\"\n\n\"More or less--if heart-failure doesn't get me.\"\n\n\"I guess our skins are still intact,\" I said.\n\nWe didn't talk after that.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt last we entered a long, downward-slanting tunnel, full of soft\nluminescence that seemed to come out of the white-tiled walls\nthemselves. My attention grew a little vague. It could be that my mind\nturned in on itself, like a turtle drawing in its head for protection.\nIn that state of semiconsciousness, I experienced a phantasm. I\nimagined I was a helpless grub being dragged down into the depths of\nan ant-hill.\n\nBut such a grub belongs in an ant-hill a lot more than a man belonged\nwhere I was going. This became plainer when the large tunnel ended,\nand we were dragged and carried along winding burrows, never more than\nthree feet in diameter. Mostly they were tiled, but often their walls\nwere of bare rock or soil. Twice we passed through air-locks.\n\nI couldn't describe too much of what I saw or the noises I heard in\nthose warrens. In one place, incandescence glowed and wheels turned.\nIn a great low-ceilinged chamber full of artificial sun-rays there was\na garden with strange blooms. The architecture of the city was not\naltogether utilitarian and it was not unpleasing. I saw a lot more.\nBut my mind was somewhat fuzzy, probably from shock and fatigue.\n\nI know we traversed another chamber, where trays full of round lumps\nof soil were set in frames. A Martian nursery, no doubt.\n\nSome minutes later, my companions and I were left in a small room,\nhigh enough so that we could stand erect in it. Here the Martians let\ngo of us. We sprawled on the floor, faces down. We'd had a busy day.\nOur nerve-energy was burned out.\n\nHopelessness warped all of my thoughts. I must have slipped into the\ncoma of exhaustion. I had jangled dreams about Alice and the kids and\nhome, and almost imagined I was there.\n\nHalf awake again, I had a cursing spree, calling myself fifty kinds of\na numbskull. Be passive before the people of other worlds! Reassure\nthem! How did we ever think up that one? We'd been crazy. Why didn't\nwe at least use our guns when we'd had the chance? It wouldn't have\nmade any difference to be killed right away.\n\nNow we were sacrificial lambs on the altar of a featherbrained idea\nthat the inhabitants of worlds that had always been separate from the\nbeginning should become friends, learn to swap and to benefit from the\ndiverse phases of each other's cultures. How could Martians who\nhatched out of lumps of mud be like humans at all?\n\nKlein, Craig, Miller and I were alone in that room. There were\ncrystal-glazed spy-windows in the walls. Perhaps we were still being\nobserved.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhile I was sleeping, the exit had been sealed with a circular piece\nof glassy stuff. Near the floor there were vents through which air was\nbeing forced into the room. Hidden pumps, which must have been hastily\nrigged for our reception, throbbed steadily.\n\nMiller, beside me, had removed his oxygen helmet. His grin was\nslightly warped as he said to me: \"Well, Nolan, here's another\nparallel with what we've known before. We had to keep Etl alive in a\ncage. Now the same thing is being done to us.\"\n\nThis could be regarded as a service, a favor. Yet I was more inclined\nto feel that I was like something locked up in a zoo. Maybe Etl's\ncase was a little different. For the first thing he had known in life\nwas his cage.\n\nI removed my oxygen helmet, too, mainly to conserve its air-purifier\nunit, which I hoped I might need sometime soon--in an escape.\n\n\"Don't look so glum, Nolan,\" Miller told me. \"Here we have just what\nwe need, a chance to observe and learn and know the Martians better.\nAnd it's the same for them in relation to us. It's the best situation\npossible for both worlds.\"\n\nI was thinking mostly--belatedly--of my wife and kids. Right then,\nMiller was a crackpot to me, a monomaniac, a guy whose philosophical\nviewpoint went way beyond the healthy norm. And I soon found that\nCraig and Klein agreed with me now. Something in our attitude had\nshifted.\n\nI don't know how long we were in that sealed room. A week, perhaps. We\ncouldn't see the day-light. Our watches had vanished along with our\nweapons. Sometimes there were sounds of much movement in the tunnels\naround us; sometimes little. But the variation was too irregular to\nindicate a change based on night and day.\n\nLots of things happened to us. The air we breathed had a chemical\nsmell. And the Martians kept changing its composition and density\nconstantly--experimenting, no doubt. Now it would be oppressively\nheavy and humid; now it would be so dry and thin that we began to feel\nfaint. They also varied the temperature, from below freezing to\nEarthly desert heat. And I suspected that at times there was a drug in\nthe air.\n\nFood was lowered to us in metal containers from a circular airlock in\nthe ceiling. It was the same kind of gelatinous stuff that we had\nfound in the wreck of the ship that had brought the infant Etl to\nEarth. We knew that it was nourishing. Its bland sweetishness was not\nto our taste, but we had to eat.\n\nVarious apparatus was also lowered to us. There were odd mechanical\npuzzles that made me think how grotesquely Earthly Martian scientific\nattitudes were. And there was s little globe on a wire, the purpose of\nwhich we never figured out, though Miller got an electric shock from\nit.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI kept looking for Etl among the Martians at the spy-windows, hoping\nthat he'd turn up again. I had noticed that Martians showed variations\nof appearance, like humans--longer or shorter eye-stalks, lighter or\ndarker tendrils.... I figured I'd recognize Etl. But I didn't see him.\n\nWe were none of us quite ourselves. Not even Miller, whose scientific\ninterest in the things around him sustained him even in captivity.\nMine had worn out. And Klein and Craig were no better off. I was\ndesperately homesick, and I felt a little ill, besides.\n\nI managed to loosen the metal heel-plate from one of my boots, and\nwith this, when I thought that no Martian was watching, I started to\ndig the gummy cement from around the circular glassy disc with which\nthe main exit of our quarters had been sealed. Craig, Klein and I\nworked at it in brief and sporadic shifts. We didn't really hope that\nwe could escape. It was just something to do.\n\n\"We're going to try to get to the ship, Miller, if it's still there,\"\nI whispered once. \"Probably it won't work. Want to join up with the\nrest of us?\"\n\nI just didn't think of him as being in command now. And he seemed to\nagree, because he didn't protest against my high-handed way of\ntalking. Also, he didn't argue against a projected rashness that could\neasily get us killed. Apparently he understood that our lives weren't\nworth much to us as things were.\n\nHe smiled a little. \"I'll stick around, Nolan. If you do manage to get\nback to Earth, don't make the Martians sound too bad.\"\n\n\"I won't,\" I answered, troubled by an odd sense of regret.\n\nLoosening that exit disc proved in the end to be no special trick.\nThen we just waited for a lull in the activity in the tunnels around\nus. We all put on our oxygen helmets, Miller included, for the\nair-pressure here in our \"cage\" would drop as soon as the loosened\ndisc was dislodged. We put our shoulders against it and pushed. It\npopped outward. Then the three of us, with Miller staying behind,\nscrambled on hands and knees through the tunnel that lay before us.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA crazy kind of luck seemed to be with us. For one thing, we didn't\nhave to retrace our way along the complicated route by which we had\nbeen brought down to our prison. In a minute we reached a wide tunnel\nthat slanted upward. A glassy rotary airlock worked by a simple\nlever--for, of course, most of the city's air would be pressurized to\nsome extent for the Martians--led into it.\n\nThe main passage wasn't exactly deserted, but we traversed it in leaps\nand bounds, taking advantage of the weak Martian gravity. Shapes\nscattered before us, chirping and squeaking.\n\nWe reached the surface quickly. It was frigid night. We stumbled away\ninto it, taking cover under some lichenous bushes, while we looked\nfor the highway. It was there, plain to see, in the light of Phobos.\nWe dashed on toward it, across what seemed to be a planted field. A\nwhite layer of ice-crystal mist flowed between and over those tough\ncold-endured growths. For a minute, just as two shots rang out behind\nus, we were concealed by it completely.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nI thought to myself that, to the Martians, we were like escaped tigers\nor leopards--only worse. For a moment I felt that we had jumped from\nthe frying pan into the fire. But, as we reached the highway, my\nspirits began to soar. Perhaps--only perhaps--I'd see my family again\nbefore too long. There was traffic on the road, trains of great\nsoft-tired wagons, pulled by powered vehicles ahead. I wondered if,\nlike on Earth, much freight was moved at night to avoid congestion.\n\n\"When I was a college kid, I used to hitchhike sometimes,\" Craig\nremarked.\n\n\"I don't guess we had better try that here,\" Klein said. \"What we can\ndo is more of a hobo stunt.\"\n\nWe found the westerly direction we needed easily enough from the\nstars. The constellations naturally looked the same as they did at\nhome. We hid behind some rustling leaves, dry as paper, and waited for\nthe next truck train to pass. When one came, we used the agility which\nMartian gravity gave us and rushed for the tail-end wagon and\nscrambled aboard. There we hid ourselves under a kind of\ncoarse-fibered tarpaulin.\n\nPeering past boxes and bales, we kept cautious watch of the road. We\nsaw strange placques, which might have served as highway signs. Again\nwe saw buildings and passing lights.\n\nWe were dopes, of course, ever to think that we were going to get away\nwith this. Our overwrought nerves had urged us to unreasoning\nrebellion, and we had yielded to them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOur last hope was punctured when at last we saw the flood-lights that\nbathed our ship. The taste on my tongue was suddenly bitter. There\nwere roughly three things we could do now, and none of the choices was\nespecially attractive.\n\nWe could go back where we had come from. We could try to keep\nconcealed in the countryside, until we were finally hunted down, or\nuntil our helmet air-purifiers wore out and we smothered. Or we could\nproceed to our rocket, which was now surrounded by a horde of\nMartians. Whichever one we chose, it looked as if the end would be the\nsame--death.\n\n\"I'm for going on to the ship,\" Klein said in a harsh whisper.\n\n\"The same with me,\" Craig agreed. \"It's where we want to go. If\nthey're going to kill or capture us, it might as well be there.\"\n\nSuddenly, for no good reason, I thought of something. No special\nsafeguards had been set up around that sealed room in the city.\n\nEscape had been easy. What did that mean?\n\n\"Okay,\" I said. \"Maybe you've both got the same hunch I just got. We\nwalk very slowly toward our rocket. We get into the light as soon as\npossible. Does that sound right to you? We'd be going back to the\nplan. And, it could be, to common sense.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Klein answered.\n\n\"We'll give it a whirl,\" Craig agreed.\n\nWe jumped off that freight wagon at the proper moment and moved toward\nthe rocket. Nothing that we'd done on Mars--not even making our first\nacquaintance with the inhabitants--was as ticklish an act.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nStep after slow step, we approached the floodlighted area, keeping\nclose together before that horde which still looked horrible to us.\nOne thing in our favor was that the Martians here had probably been\nwarned of our escape by whatever means of communication they used. And\nthey could certainly guess that our first objective would be our ship.\nHence they would not be startled into violence by our sudden\nappearance.\n\nOne of them fired a shot which passed over our heads. But we kept on\ngoing, making our movements as unfrightening as we could to counteract\nthe dread of us that they must have still felt.\n\nPanic and the instinctive fear of the strange were balanced in our\nminds against reason. We got to the nose of our ship, then to the open\ndoors of its airlock. The horde kept moving back before us and we\nclambered inside. Martian eyes remained wary, but no more action was\ntaken against us.\n\nOur cabin had been ransacked. Most of the loose stuff had been removed ...\neven my picture of Alice, and our two kids.\n\n\"Who cares about trifles?\" I muttered. \"Rap on wood, guys--I think\nwe've won. So have the local people.\"\n\n\"You're right,\" Klein breathed. \"What other reason can there be for\ntheir not jumping us? Miller's passive strategy must've worked the\nfirst time. The story that we meant no harm must have gotten around.\nThey don't want to make trouble, either. And who, with any sense\ndoes?\"\n\nI felt good--maybe too good. I wondered if the Martians felt the same\neager fascination for the enigmas of space that we felt, in spite of\nthe same fear of the nameless that we too could feel. My guess was\nthat they did. Undoubtedly they also wanted interplanetary relations\nto be smooth. They could control their instinctive doubts to help\nattain this objective. If they coveted Earth's resources, it was still\nfar away, and could defend itself. Besides, they were not built to\nlive in comfort under the raw conditions of its strange environment.\nCommerce was the only answer.\n\nSuddenly Mars was no longer a hostile region to me, out in the reaches\nof space. Again it was full of endless, intriguing mysteries. It was\nbeautiful. And knowledge of that beauty and mystery had been won, in\nspite of some blundering. The scheme that we had practiced, and that\nMiller had stuck to, had paid off. It had broken down that first\ninevitable barrier of alienness between Earthmen and Martians enough\nso that they now had a chance to start looking for the countless\nsimilarities between us.\n\nA fraction of our food stores aboard the rocket had been taken,\nprobably for analysis. But there was plenty more. We closed the\nairlock, repressurized the cabin from air-tanks, and cooked ourselves\na meal. Then we slept in shifts, one of us always awake as guard.\n\nAt dawn, Miller hammered at a window. He'd been brought out from the\ncity. We weren't too surprised by then.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEtl turned up at noon. He came in a kind of plane, which landed right\nbeside our rocket, making quite a noise. I recognized him easily\nenough; I'd know those eye-stalks anywhere. Besides, as he came out of\nthe plane, he was carrying the speech-tube that Klein had made for\nhim.\n\nWe let him into the cabin. \"Hello, gang,\" he said, manipulating the\ntube with his tendrils. \"I see you passed your tests almost as well as\nI did on those weird things you were always making me take on Earth.\"\n\n\"So they were tests,\" I said.\n\n\"Sure. Otherwise, why do you think I didn't come to you before? They\nsaid you had to solve your own problems.\"\n\n\"How did they treat you?\" Miller wanted to know.\n\n\"Mostly my people were nice to me. They took me to a great desert\ncity, far away. Sort of the capital of Mars. It's in an 'oasis' where\na network of 'canals' join. The canals fit an old theory of your\nastronomers. They're ribbons of irrigated vegetation. But the water is\npiped underground. I spoke to my people in the way that you once\nthought I would, trying to convince them that you were okay. But I\nguess that you did most of the job yourselves.\"\n\n\"In spite of a lot of blunders, maybe we did, Etl,\" I replied dryly.\n\"What are your plans? Going to stay here now? Or will you come back\nwith us?\"\n\nI sensed that he would stay. It was natural. Maybe I even sensed a\nremoteness in him, a kind of withdrawal. Not unfriendly, but ... we\nboth knew it was the parting of the ways.\n\n\"It's best for what we're trying to accomplish, Nolan,\" he said. \"I\ncan tell my people about Earth; you can tell yours about Mars.\nBesides, I like it here. But I'll be back on Earth some time. Just so\nyou'll come here again. Thanks to you guys for everything.\"\n\n\"I'd like to stay too, Nolan,\" Miller said, smiling. \"If they'll have\nme. Under Etl's instructions, they might improve my quarters.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSo that much was settled. I felt a certain longing myself now. But I'm\na family man, with home still in my blood. Klein and Craig weren't\ntied as I was, but they had a lot to hold them to Earth. Besides,\nsomebody had to report back.\n\nWe were on Mars two days longer, though we didn't go any farther than\nback to the neighboring city. We took thousands of photographs. We\nwere given samples of common Martian apparatus, pieces of jade that\nwere covered with queer, beautiful carvings made millions of years\nbefore, bars of radioactive metal.\n\nEarth was still near enough in its orbit to be reached without too\nmuch trouble. We jacked our rocket into a vertical position, from\nwhich an interplanetary takeoff could best be made. The cabin,\nswinging on its universal joints, stayed level. Martians watched,\ninterested, but still obviously not quite ready to cast aside their\ndeeper suspicions. Yet, when we blasted clear, we knew that a ship of\ntheirs, halfway around the planet, was doing the same and would follow\nus back to Earth. Ambassadors, of course, and commercial attach\u00e9s.\n\nI'd lost my picture of Alice, Patty and Ron to some local souvenir\nhunter. But I knew that I was going to see them....\n\nThe friendly contact between Earth and Mars can still be queered by\nsomebody's silly blunder, of course. Human or Martian. You have to be\ncareful. But a beginning has been made.\n\n                                                    --RAYMOND Z.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
